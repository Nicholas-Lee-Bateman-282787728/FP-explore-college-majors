1544350,4,B00005JNTU,"People in my theater actually clapped and cheered when this film ended and that alone is a rare thing. It is a lot of fun and I almost didn't see it due to the harsh critical pounding this movie has been taking. It isn't as good as X-Men 2 or Batman Begins, but I prefer it over Hulk and the Spiderman films. The acting and special effects are good, but both are lacking at times. Jessica Alba is one of the hottest women on the planet and is a nice visual treat that makes up for her decent acting skills. The Human Torch and The Thing were both great in the acting department (loved the back and forth trash talk) and were the best characters in my opinion. Mr. Fantastic was a boring nerd, but that is what his part called for and he played it well. Dr. Doom was much better than expected and I liked the fact that the actor didn't overact the part to the degree that we are use to in comic book films. Go see this film with low expectations and you will be surprised big time. This is a worthy addition to the Marvel movie franchise.",1120780800,5,1037,4.138613861386139
1544351,4,B00005JNTU,"I was very unhappy with the fact that the previews gave you what the whole movie was! I hate when that happens. It was good though, but I wish there was more to the movie that wasn't seen in the trailers. The special affects where great and the acting was good. It was more of a goofy marvel movie. Kids laughed in the theater and I even giggled a bit. I will say it is a family movie. I will buy when it comes out on dvd.",1120780800,3,422,3.8620689655172415
1544352,2,B00005JNTU,"I can't remember the film, but I'd seen an old movie once about a screenwriter who was complaining about the way the studio treated his little script about kids playing ball in the park. Once it was written and sold, the piece was later turned into a war film, ruing any care, attention or real labor that the writer had put into an otherwise fetching story. To say that this is what could have happened to the Fantastic Four is just an assumption. But, somewhere along the line, between writing the script and casting the film, somebody who didn't know a damn thing about Marvel's finest hero group took control and warped it into one of the stupidest pieces of cinema this side of SuperGirl. Either they didn't know or they didn't care. Take your pick.

When I heard who was cast as Ben Grimm, the Thing, I was really excited. I had never even once thought of Michael Chiklis, but there could not have been anyone better for the role. Hyped up, I learned about who would take the role of the Human Torch. Whatever, I'd never even heard of this kid. Then, Jessica Alba, and I said, ""Oh no."" Not as the....Invisible Woman??? How can it be worse!?! Then, it got worse with some guy who's name I couldn't even pronounce as Mr. Fantastic, with gray dye on his temples. Not even looking anywhere near the real age of Reed Richards, this guy meant doom. But not all by himself. No, the real doom would come from the smug actor, Something Whatisname, who would destroy the character of Dr. Doom forever. Not only did this guy look like he couldn't play Doom but he played him in a really stupid plot device. Here...

Reed and his ilk want to go out into space for a science mission. I halfway believed him as a smart guy, but never are we made to believe that he is a genius. Victor Von Doom is the billionaire who finances the project and tags along - with Sue Storm as his girlfriend (!) and Johnny and Ben to tag along as pilots. Now, what is wrong with this story?

FIRST: Reed and Doom were friends in college until Doom blew up his own face in a science mistake and blamed it on Reed, hating him forever. This was waaaaay before Reed even knew the Storms.

SECOND: Johnny Storm was much younger in the comic book, at least by three or four years. AT LEAST. How he unbelievably managed to take the trip into space at that age, I will never know, so it's good that they fixed that part.

THIRD: I don't think Sue was a scientist in the book - in fact, I'm positive of it. Either way, Jessica Alba, being a major hottie, gets away with her hotness when being in ANY movie. But she will never get away with playing a scientist.

FOURTH: Doom never went into space with Reed and his ilk and he sure as heck wasn't dating Sue.

FIFTH: Ben Grimm ROCKS! Can't diss that part.

So, there. Before the film even starts, not only do they manage to smartly create a timely story about their origin which manages to incorporate Doom, but they DO IT BADLY AND STUPIDLY! Trying to crunch in the important themes was a good idea but it was left in the hands of bad, bad, bad storytellers. Doom ends up getting zapped in space with the rest of them and that's why he has armor? BECAUSE IT'S HIS SKIN? LAME!!!!

I won't go into much more of my personal hatreds, but I will tell you that I despise the director, Tim Story of ""Barbershop"" fame. Not only is he not competent enough to take on a story like this one, but he doesn't know enough about it to care. With a name like his, I half expected at least a good visual ""story."" Instead, we seemed to get just a pile of smoking junk, as if he didn't know a good story if it bit him in the butt. Now, some directors just do what they do because it's payday or because they don't have the clout to flex any muscles. If he were Spielberg, he would probably have said, ""NO! TAKE THIS GARBAGE BACK AND LET WHEN KNOW WHEN YOU HIRE SOME REAL SCREENWRITERS!"" (this from the guy who made ""Jurassic Park"" - which only floated thanks to CGI. But CLOUT reigns supreme) But, Story is not Spielberg, he's the guy from ""Barbershop."" But the film just reeks of not even trying. If he was powerless and had to succumb to the studio's demands, I take it all back. The studio should have backed off, not him.

Ben's latext skin was good, but it really should have been better with a little CGI touch-ups. There were times when I cringed at how obviously fake his orange suit was. Still, Chiklis handled the job really well, but the scene where Ben's wife leaves him was totally laughable. Still, not his fault. Furthermore, not that I'm hating, but I could have sworn that Ben's blind girlfriend in the comic book was white.

Sue Storm and Reed Richards sucked almost as bad as Doctor Doom. Doom is a super-intimidating figure and it did not play out here well enough. He said some mean things, smacked some people around, but he was by no means the insane mastermind from paper pictures. Sue's powers looked super-cool but Reed's seemed a bit silly at times. But during the BIG FIGHT SCENE, I forgave a lot and just enjoyed myself. For a few minutes there, it was totally FANTASTIC FOUR material.

The Human Torch could not have been better. Not how I imagined him, but he surpassed all my expectations and actually proved me wrong in some places. He is cocky and arrogant and, like Dash from THE INCREDIBLES, seemed to be the only one to relish the idea of having super powers. Nice change of pace, differing from Batman, Blade and Spiderman, who do what they have to do like it's a curse or a reason to be bummed out all the time.

If I were to rate it from one to ten, I would give it a four. One because it's a superhero movie. Two, because Alba is hot. Three, because I loved Grimm and Johnny and their constant bickering. And four, because some of the effects, like the Human Torch's fire, were top notch. Keep one thing in mind though, after the ""Incredibles"" came out and everyone saw how cool a person with stretch powers could be, rumor has it that the FANTASTIC FOUR went back and shot ""better"" scenes of Reed stretching around. Still....no competition. Not even enough competition for a cartoon.",1120780800,87,6119,4.3664323374340945
1544353,3,B00005JNTU,"While an obvious improvement over the infamous (and excremental) 1994 version, this take on the story of the FANTASTIC FOUR just isn't all that fantastic. This movie is a suitable summer superhero flick, but after the recent and truly fantastic BATMAN, SPIDER-MAN, and X-MEN offerings, FF comes off as a merely adequate film that would have been more satisfying prior to the year 2000, before the bar had been raised. The action and the top-notch SFX are the film's selling points, and while this affable summer blockbuster dishes of plenty of bangs, it doesn't quite click the way previous MARVEL offerings did. Of course, you should see it on the big screen for the stunning big-scale visuals and kinetic zest, but these days you need to put everything you have on the screen, or they'll just walk out and watch the Adam Sandler movie playing in the next cinema.

Each actor brings just enough life into each role and not an ounce more. There's more personality retread than human exposition, and character development is left to a loop of traits. Johnny Storm/The Human Torch is a cocky thrill seeker and impatient daredevil, Ben Grimm/The Thing is grumpy over Johnny's antics and his physical transformation, and Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic is a hopeless nerd who keeps snuffing the flame between himself and Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Together, the Fantastic Four face off against Dr. Victor Von Doom, a power-hungry millionaire with convenient menace. Don't worry about short-term memory loss; the film doesn't miss an opportunity to remind the audience how one-note each character.

After a bridge accident that quickly and conveniently escalates in order to give each of the Four a chance to showcase their talents, the plot meanders around with the group dynamic before climaxing in a showdown with Von Doom that once again provides the opportunity for each hero to shine once more. Thankfully, the plot keeps moving, but director Tim Story (BARBERSHOP, TAXI) is a strange choice for helming FF. His lack of experience shows here, and that's the film's biggest flaw. Nevertheless, who cares really? Go see it on a Friday night with a big box of popcorn and some good friends and you'll be guaranteed an entertaining comic book flick. But next time round, should a sequel be green-lit, the script should be put before spectacle.",1120780800,7,2340,5.012853470437018

1544355,5,B00005JNTU,"This movie is going to be SO awesome!  Whether your a Marvel fan or not, you will love this movie.  The plot is pretty much an origin story.  Cosmic rays hit the 5 of them in outer space causing the creation of the Fantastic Four:  Reed Richards is Mr. Fantastic and can stretch his body in any way he wants becoming a human elastic.  Susan Storm is the Invisible Girl who can turn herself and objects she wishes invisible while also being able to create forcefields.  Ben Grim is the Thing...he's as tough as the Hulk and a super intense character with a rock body.  Johnny Storm is the Human Torch who can control his body while bursting into flame...he can fly and control the flame in every way.  The villain is the one and only Doctor Doom who gets some nasty scars on his face and ends up wearing a mask that gives the character his look.  This movie is a must see and will be just as good as the Spiderman movies...if not better.

Pros: Entertaining Superhero Flick

Cons: It doesn't have a high rewatchability rating

the story

 In this sequel to Fantastic Four, we find the four new superheroes riding high on their recent defeat of their first arch enemy Dr. Doom. Johnny is getting endorsements up the wahzoo, Ben has found love despite his rocky appearance, and Dr. Reed Richards is going to marry the hottest babe in the world, The Invisible Woman. The engaged couple makes a vow to each other to go through with this wedding without any interruptions or emergency-like diversions. So, it must be something really big to stop this wedding. How about the threat of the end of the world for starters?

 The four must quickly shift into hero mode, and discover the cause behind the looming threat, and then stop it. They discover - The Silver Surfer, and that every time he visits a different planet, eight days later - the planet dies. They need to somehow capture the very elusive Silver Surfer, and so the army general decides to ask for the help of Victor Von Doom, aka Dr. Doom. Needless to say, the FF are shocked to find that he's still alive, but reluctantly agree to work with Doom in order to stop the Surfer. When they catch the Surfer, they discover through questioning that he is a slave to an entity called Galactus, the swallower of worlds.

 How in the world are the Fantastic Four going to stop this catastrophe from happening? Will Dr. Doom turn over a new leaf or is he still up to his old tricks? Is the end of planet Earth? Find out when you view Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.

the breakdown

 This sequel is pretty much just more of the same from the first movie. Now it seems the odds of a victory are much slimmer than they were in the first film, as they face a large unseen force that threatens to swallow the earth. Speaking of Galactus, Im not sure why he is represented here as a space cloud instead of the definitive shape that he is inside the comics. I for one don't mind it too much, this way it shortens the movie to a more watchable hour and a half instead of giving a back-story and paying an actor to play Galactus. Yet Im sure the purists aren't too happy with what they did to this powerful Marvel enemy. Speaking of Marvel, Stan Lee had his usual pop-in cameo, and this time much more humorous as he finds that he is not on the guest list to the private wedding ceremony of Reed and Susans wedding. For those of you who are not familiar with the F4, let me quickly brief you about their super powers. Dr Richards is capable of stretching any part of his body to just about any length, his fiance Susan can go invisible and she also creates force feilds, her brother Johnny is capable of flight and creating body heat that goes up to super nova, and Ben the assistant is now made of rock and is possesses super strength.

 Yet, like I said  not much has changed from the first installment. Dr Richards (Ioan Grufford - Black Hawk Down, Titanic) is still an egghead, Susan is still extremely hot, and Johnny (Chris Evans - The Nanny Diaries, TMNT) and Ben (Michael Chiklis  The Three Stooges, The Shield) still get on each others nerves. Yet there are a couple of new developments, like when Johnny comes into contact with the Silver Surfer for the first time it changes his molecular structure so that whenever he comes into contact with one of the other members of the Fantastic Four, they switch powers. This of course gets Jessica Alba (Good Luck Chuck, Sin City) naked in public again, when the fire burns off all of her clothes on a busy NYC street.

 Not only is the film derivative of itself, but its also kind of predictable. I cant really hold that as a fault though because as far as superhero movies go, you pretty much know who is going to wind up in which predicament. I still found the movie fun to watch, with some laughs, some great CGI animation, and some action packed superhero style thrills.

 The main trouble I had with this movie had to do with the Blu-Ray. The audio kept cutting out on my BD-P1500 Samsung model, and when I switched players to the BD-P1200, the second generation player I have had good audio but there was a ghost image of the main menu on the screen. I hope this is because of the disc and not my players. I recommend this movie for the whole family, but maybe you should try it on DVD.

Solid special effects & action sequences, & love the inclusion of the Silver Surfer & really feel that Tim Story successfully captured in 92 minutes the spirit of Marvel's first family. This sequel is a rather fast set up with a wonderful blend of action, humor, & drama that brings me back to cult classics like Swamp Thing or The Rocketeer. Seeing at last the Silver Surfer get the big screen treatment is just awesome & I totally love all the scenes with him & Laurence Fishburne's voice works perfectly with the character too. Despite Galactus being reduced to a giant smog cloud in this adaptation, it doesn't take away from the awesome cast, even the more hammy Julian McMahon's Dr. Doom is watchable. Say what you will about this movie but its far more enjoyable than over-hyped flicks like Suicide Squad, X-Men Apocalypse, & the sadly, severely missed opportunity of Josh Trank's 2015 FF movie.",1490400000,,1047,4.60427807486631

1544833,5,B00005JNTU,"An incredibly entertaining comic book movie! While the character development in the first installment was better, I rate this movie a little higher. This is because the Silver Surfer is one of the greatest comic book characters ever. This is a perfect example of CGI done right. CGI has to be done for a purpose and add to the story. The Silver Surfer/Galactus tale is the best story in the FF legend. The surfer looks great on screen and his chase scene with the Human Torch is the greatest scene in the history of comic book movies. (That is until the airport scene in Captain America: Civil War came along). The chase scene was a masterpiece of CGI. The musical score in that scene was epic as well. The movie is definitely worth watching just for that scene alone. I rewind and watch it over and over again, due to its awesomeness!

Dr. Doom is the greatest villain in the Marvel universe, and I like the choice of Julian McMahon to play Doom. He has the right look and persona, but I wish he had gotten into his character more, like Heath Ledger did, and really become the personification of evil. He could have made Doom like Darth Vader if he really wanted to. This is a great movie for kids and I'm glad they made it without bad language, which goes to show you don't need foul language to make a great movie.",1484352000,,1317,4.397540983606557

Can't stand the humor, the team costumes' conceit, the absolutely silly abandonment of the laws of physics way too many times, and, frankly all these ""powers"" just keep getting more and more dated as the actors get fatter and older but are not written as evolving.  And:  the love story was empty.  Yeah, I said it; sue me. The general's disdain for the crew was unmerited and seemed to have just been put into the plot by a writer who should have been able to say ""no,"" to Stan Lee about the amount of side-carnage in the film.  Truth be told any gang with these powers would be totally obeyed by today's military, because they'd know that the veritable secrets of the laws of nature were ""in hand,"" and that kind of power is what the military is willing to surrender to -- until they figure out how to ""do it too.""

1545239,3,B00005JNTU,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out.  There was a lot of hype and publicity for it and previews all over the place.  Fantastic 4 Rise of the Silver Surfer, should have been a great high octane Marvel movie.  But the film gave away all the best parts of the movie in the 4 different previews they had out promoting the movie.  If you are going to give away the whole movie why should we even bother to go see it.  That is pretty much the sum of the movie itself.  The movie had great looking effects but no real story or purpose to drive those effects.  No Silver Surfer backstory why he is fighting the Fantastic 4 in the first place, or what his goal was on planet Earth.  Like Darth Maul we get maybe 1 sentence of dialog the entire movie, thats it.  We don't get to see any of his own people or dire circumstances so why should the audience care.  All 3 of the Fantastic 4 movies have been average to mediocre movies.  They are kind of like the bastard stepchildren of the Marvel movies far behind Spider Man and X-men franchises.  I was hoping for so much more from this movie which ultimately was a disappointment and just another Summer popcorn film.

Ultimately this movie is all flash and little substance.  I would rate it probably 2  to a low 3 stars.  It is not terrible or even a bad movie but the previews promised so much more than what the film ended up being.  The cast was pretty decent as the Fantastic 4 members they did seem to have some chemistry and a 3rd film could have been interesting.  Instead the studios decided to reboot the whole thing and make an even worse origin story.",1462838400,,1622,4.245098039215686

1545340,3,B00005JNTU,"Released in 2007, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer continues the adventures of the Fantastic Four with Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue (Jessica Alba) getting married, but their wedding is interrupted by a literal herald of global destruction, the Silver Surfer (voiced by none other than Laurence Fishburne). Michael Chiklis, Chris Evans and Julian McMahon return as The Thing, the Human Torch and Dr. Doom respectively, not to mention Kerry Washington as Alicia Masters. Andre Braugher and Beau Garrett are on hand as General Hager and Capt. Frankie Raye.

Ive been a fan of the Fantastic Four since my childhood and felt that the 2005 movie was a very good set-up for the series despite fumbling the ball with Dr. Doom and a mediocre action climax. With the presence of the Silver Surfer and Galactus I was expecting a great sequel, but it was not to be. The first half is quite good, however, with the main cast comfortable in their roles and obviously having a good time. But something goes awry in the second half where the proceedings get dull. Its hard to pinpoint the problem, but clearly they needed to work some kinks out in the script. On the positive side, Dr. Doom is better portrayed than in the first film. Despite my criticisms, theres enough good here to give Rise of the Silver Surfer a lukewarm thumbs up, just don't expect greatness.

The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in British Columbia, California, New York City, Germany (The Black Forest), China, Japan and Greenland.

It's far from perfect and it abounds in cheesiness, corny acting and dialog and goofy special effects but at it's heart its just a fun comic book movie, and mostly safe for all-ages (a couple creepy scenes and a couple suggestive ones but fairly tame.) Ioan Gruffund does a fine job as Mister Fantastic - perhaps not as brainy as the comic book version but he works. It's also funny to see Chris Evans as a goofier, non-Captain America character (and makes you wonder how they could ever have a Fantastic Four/Captain America cross-over).  Julian McMahon, however, totally does not work as Doctor Doom, and just seems bored and out of place in the film.

1545698,3,B00005JNTU,"In wake of 2015's Fantastic 4 reboot, it's nice to come back to its predecessor from ten years before and marvel just how fun it still is. Make no mistake, Fantastic 4 is first and foremost interested in being a fun, action-packed movie, putting entertainment first and foremost. It surprisingly succeeds very well at that, and I find it very watchable on repeated runs.

Down-on-his-luck scientist Reed Richards is reduced to asking his rival Victor Von Doom for funding to study his latest findings on solar phenomena. Von Doom gleefully agrees, if just to see his rival grovelling at his feet. What with Von Doom's current girlfriend being Reed's former flame, and her brother not being the easiest guy on the planet to work with, you could say the atmosphere is somewhat tense. Not least when the space mission made to study the solar phenomena goes horribly, horribly wrong.

There is an air of lightheartedness, as said, about this story. The scenes where the characters individually discover their new, space-given powers are very entertaining. Reed's partner Ben Grimm seems to get the worst deal, what with getting the biggest exposure and thus turning into a giant rock monster. Of all the characters, Johnny Storm takes the most positive attitude, being genuinely interested in his ability to turn into flame, and being angry at the other characters for only seeing their powers as an illness that needs to be cured. Of course, Von Doom takes the darkest stance to his powers, so these four people find themselves pressed to save the day, whether they like it (and each other) or not.

This movie was a child of its time, but I digress that not all superhero movies are meant to be super-dark and edgy (the stance that DC movies are thoroughly embracing). More could have been made of it, perhaps, but it's definitely worth a view. Ioan Gruffudd is pretty flat as Reed, Jessica Alba is how she is playing Sue Storm, and Michael Chiklis is a bit of a wildcard as the Thing, but he engages our sympathy and our liking. However, it's Chris Evans who steals the movie in his breakthrough role as the braggart, irresponsible Johnny Storm. He seemed to have an absolute blast with the role, and his scenes are the movie's best. It's small wonder that Marvel were impressed with him and wanted him back, and we all know what came of that. It's funny to think that his iconic character would be Captain America, who has the exact opposite personality to that of Johnny Storm.

If you want a fun popcorn movie about superheroes, one where comedy and attitude are the prime sellers, then Fantastic Four is a solid pick.",1439078400,2,2620,4.751648351648352

1545777,4,B00005JNTU,"i've already mentioned that i have a significant pet-peeve about critics dismissing the very concept of escapism. why the hell is adventure for adventure's sake always treated as somehow the least valid genre?
i believe i've also mentioned my theory that many good (or at least not quite lousy) movies end up victims of juggernauts. there are times when it seems like every movie i review - Lt. Robin Crusoe U.S.N., Haunted Honeymoon, The Shadow, Wild Wild West, The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle, The Lone Ranger - should've been hailed as something between a good time and a masterpiece, but was branded for life by misleading rumor.
here, alas, we have another such martyr. yes, it's a cookie-cutter specimen of the burgeoning superhero formula, and yes, that's all it aspires to be, but there's nothing wrong with that, at least nothing major. just because it's unexceptional is no reason to resent it. all in all it's a pleasant enough example of the subgenre. if nothing else, it should be noted that it beats the hell out of this year's convoluted rehash. (even many of the professional critics are saying that the new film makes the much criticized 2005 and 2007 films look like Casablanca and The Godfather.)
i'm not a particular comics aficionado, so i can't really speak for the parts the ""fanboys"" got up in arms about. but i can still recognize certain weaknesses. the principle one being that the cast got only halfway to the title's promise. Ioan Gruffudd and Michael Chiklis are masterstrokes: Gruffudd's Reed Richards is the quintessence of the awkward genius and Chiklis plays The Thing's inherent tragedy like a virtuoso. there being no shortage of chemistry between them doesn't hurt, either.
the Storms, alas, don't find themselves in such capable hands. as Johnny ""The Torch,"" Chris Evans significantly overplays the gung-ho daredevil, not to mention smarmy opportunist, cards(s). (surprising, considering the heart and nobility Evans later displayed as Captain America. well, at least he learned seems to of learned something.)
the true weakest link, though, in both the movie and the team, is Jessica Alba as Sue Storm. Alba could very well be the single most overrated actress of recent decades. she's barely believable as a human being, let alone a scientist, and her characterization is so bland that she makes Steven Wright look like William Shatner. (to say nothing of her not being NEARLY as pretty and/or sexy as the Industry spin-doctors would have you think.) not since Popeye and Olive Oyl has just what a hero sees in a would-be love interest been such an enigma.
so maybe they should've called it ""The Fantastic 2 & Their 2 Hangers-On.""
the villainy of Julian MacMahon is a similarly mixed bag. on the one hand he effortlessly exudes the ego and menace necessary for the job, but even i know he's not quite what the faithful had gotten used to. i was particularly perplexed to note that he didn't speak like a Shakespearean character, as had the Dr. Doom of the cartoons i remember seeing as a youngster. so technically MacMahon does a pretty half-assed job, but at least he has the ""presence"" to command the screen when he is on.
i sometimes wonder if the film didn't disappoint some with it's whimsy. it takes a pretty lighthearted approach which may well of come out of left field after the heavy social commentary of the X-Men and the nerd-angst of the Spider-Man movies. there's quite a bit more humor herein, particularly concerning domestic relations when the team moves in together. Chris Evans manages to make up at least some of what he lacks as a hero in his prickly love/hate relationship with The Thing.
and while the good-vs.-evil angle has it's ups and downs, the ultimate showdown is as spectacular as could be hoped.
so no, not everything about it quite works, but what does is worth the price of admission. it may not be a masterpiece, but it's hardly the rack-&-thumbscrews some would have you think, either.
and yes, the same can be said for the equally maligned sequel.",1434844800,,4029,4.86608442503639

It would be the Fantastic Four. This got life long fans excited for the groups first theaterical release and what was the reaction from people........meh. I really liked this movie, not the best by any means but definately not the worst and very good in my eyes. With a group called the ""Fantastic Four"" and to go along with that th e origin story, I really don't see how serious you could make it that this movie ""didn't accomplish"". Maybe the new reboot this summer will prove me wrong but I thought they handled and did it very well. Dr Doom is a awesome villain, the thing looked great! And I don't see all the criticism Jessica Alba gets, I thought she did alright as invisible woman. This was also before Chris Evans got big with Captain America and he was good too in my opinion. Mr Fantastic was also very well. This is a fun movie, and if your a comic book fan or fan of the past generation Comic book movies, this is a must see.",1423180800,,1099,4.339805825242719
1546061,4,B00005JNTU,"3.5 out of 5

Five people are endowed with superpowers after an accident on a space station. Four become a force for good. One becomes a force for evil. Thats pretty much it.

This is a fun movie and I liked it. It had a solid origin story, some good action, and pretty good SFX. Each character was clearly defined, even stereotypical, but thats the Fantastic Four for you.

A lot of people griped on this movie. It was not bad. Wasnt as cosmic or over-the-top as I wouldve liked, but it wasn't a bad flick by any means. It was a great translation of comic book to screen and carried that vibe with it from beginning to end.

The invisibility effects of the Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba) were awesome, a sweet combination of complete I-cant-see-you-at-all invisibility with the glass-like, transparent humanoid figure so we can see her enough to know what shes doing.

The Human Torch (Chris Evans) looked like a man on fire, which he is, but animated enough so we can make out his actions, his costume, facial expressions and anything else we needed to in a given scene.

Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd): at some points he looked like a real-life stretchy dude, at others the CGI was very clear (i.e. that scene when he stretches his hand under the door to unlock it from the outside).

The Thing (Michael Chiklis), arguably the hardest costume because you didn't want to run the risk of making him look like a cartoon character by going all CGI (as good as the Hulk looks even in The Avengers, theres still an animated quality to it), but you also didn't want bad prosthetics either. The Thing in this movie looked amazing and looked real. Well done.

Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) was fine as is, his costume something like an elaborate cosplay. I wouldve liked more detail in the cloak, some sort of pattern, but the whole how-he-got-his-armor thing was pretty cool.

What worked especially well was the dynamic of family and all the love, bickering and craziness that goes along with having one. There was real chemistry between all the main players and it added a dynamic to the team that made the whole scenario believable.

What also makes the Fantastic Four different is they're public superheroes without secret identities, that is, though they have codenames, everyone knows who they are. While Iron Man did this, too, having a whole family who everyone knows who they are changes the game. Its also different because, unlike Iron Man, they didn't decide, Hey, lets be superheroes, but instead its something that kind of happens and they discover how important it is they use their powers to help people.

For me, Fantastic Four was a good movie that I like popping into the DVD player now and then.",1422835200,,2705,4.685654008438819
1546062,4,B00005JNTU,"Galactus, a giant planet-eating alien, is heading for Earth and he sends the Silver Surfer to scout things out. When the Fantastic Four meet this herald of destruction, all bets are off and its a race to save the planet before Galactus can consume it.

What a great follow up to 2005s Fantastic Four. I remember when news hit that the Silver Surfer would be involved and that Galactus would be the bad guy I was beside myself with fanboy joy. And that trailer? Man, sweet stuff and totally got me stoked. Did this movie live up to the hype? Not completely, but thats not to say it was a terrible movie. It was every bit as good as its predecessor, but more exciting thanks to the Silver Surfer zipping around on his board and the Fantastic Four trying to track him down. That scene where the Human Torch meets the Surfer and the two quickly have it out? Yeah, sweet stuff.

This flick played up all the stuff that made the first one good, which was the family dynamic of the Fantastic Four, the bitter evilness of Dr. Doom, and then upped the ante by bringing in Galactus. Unfortunately, Galactuswhile just fine as a conceptfailed to deliver in terms of execution as comic book fans were really hoping for the giant space man with the purple helmet instead of the big haze of cloud we got. Some would argue that a big man thats larger than planet Earth wouldnt translate to film and a space cloud works better, but I disagree because Galactus is an all-powerful alien, can change size and could work as is if written well.

I totally dug Laurence Fishburne as the voice of the Silver Surfer. The guy can say anything and itll sound cool (i.e. see his dialogue as Morpheus in The Matrix and its sequels; the words themselves are ridiculous but he makes them sound awesome).

The story arc as suggested at in this flick wouldve better been the stuff of a trilogy, starting off with the Silver Surfers origin, how he got involved with Galactus, even a demo of him going ahead of his master to a planet other than Earth, the destruction of that planet then going to Earth, meeting the FF, and the whole planet getting ready to fend off this literally giant threat. So I feel we got the Readers Digest version of such a story in this movie. It still works, but it couldve been expanded upon.

As always, the SFX were great and they tidied up Mr. Fantastics stretching abilities so they weren't as cartoony as in the first movie.

I totally wouldve been up for them to make a third movie, but with Marvels Phase One plan no doubt in the works at the time this flick was released, were basically going to get a Fantastic Four reboot at some point in the future, probably sooner rather than later.

Ill be there because I liked these movies and am eager to see how things will progress from here and if itll be an all-out reboot complete with origin story, or if theyll sort of unofficially acknowledge these movies that came before.",1422748800,,2925,4.45607476635514

The Silver Surfer rides ahead of an all-encompassing/all-devowering cloud of pure sinister.  It's the job of the Surfer and Fantastic Four to stop this before it's too late.

The graphics and special effects have come a long way in the few short years between the team's screen debut to #2 enabling some stunning visualizations.  What once seemed unlikely is now the norm.  What was once hokey beyond belief is taken for granted.

Rise of the Silver Surfer gives viewers a rollercoaster of a ride.  This movie is worth watching.",1415750400,,804,4.992481203007519

Toss in a teen aged mentality, give him the ability to fly and burn stuff and you've got The Human Torch.  Put him up against The Thing and you've got some pretty witty repartee between the two.

(Twentieth Century Fox, 2006)
. . . .

Is it possible that there is actually a Marvel movie worse than the Ben Affleck ""Daredevil""?  Well, maybe... I finally got around to watching the much-reviled 2006 ""Fantastic Four"" film, and it is pretty awful, but there is no way in hell that I'm gonna go back and re-watch the DD fiasco in order to compare and contrast. So, let's just look at FF briefly and say that, yes, it's pretty bad and really not worth watching. The acting and dialog are terrible, the casting is all wrong, the special effects are, um, limited -- and omigod! why did they have to screw up the back-story so badly and shoehorn Doctor Doom into their origin and make him such a super-powered strong-guy, rather than just a brooding, megalomaniacal evil genius, like in the comics? Why do lightning bolts have to come out of his fingertips and flat dialog come out of his mouth?  This movie is just so wrong on so many levels, and also more than just a little bit dull... Hmm. But should I watch the Silver Surfer sequel? Oh God, I just can't help myself!  (Axton)",1405036800,,1095,4.4874371859296485

I really was looking forward to them making a third film with the original cast members, and now with this new reboot, i'm hearing a lot of whining and complaining about the new cast being introduced in the new one. I could care less about this reboot. Plus, i am glad that Chris Evans has finally gotten recognized for his performance in Captain America. Good job Chris, you certainly deserved it.",1398124800,,712,4.435114503816794

I still think they could have cast a natural blonde like Scarlett Johannson and it would have looked better but Alba isn't so bad looking back. Chris Evans steals every scene he is in. The movie could have used more of him and less of the slow scenes of Reed puttering around in his lab or Victor Doom looking in his mirror. It could have used more action period. Ultimately, it starts off good and ends fairly well but has a  whole lot of nothing in the middle. But I like it overall.",1397952000,,660,4.238095238095238

This is incredible effects, graphics, and high adrenaline stories that will satisfy every action and comic book fan out there! This movie is about the first time the Fantastic Four meet Galactus and the Silver Surfer which is before the Silver Surfer became a ""good guy"". Galactus has always been one of the most feared villains in comic history due to his/it's borderline omnipotence(Galactus could beat Odin in a fight by a landslide if at peak; Dr. Doom almost beat the Beyonder, a being of immeasurable power, with Galactus' full powers but not in this movie; that happened in Secret Wars). Dr. Doom steals the Surfer's board and you can guess the mayhem involved with that! The Four combine all of their powers into the Human Torch to form a Super Skrull like being(a being that has all of the Fantastic Four's powers in one) to beat Dr. Doom but wait, what about the Surfer and Galactus?! The Surfer could smash Earth all by himself! Super hero action!",1396656000,2,1094,4.7936507936507935
1547049,5,B00005JNTU,"I like this movie.  I'm 37 years old and not a superhero fanatic or anything, but this movie has a charm that takes it beyond the ordinary bang-zoom superhero thing.  And it's appropriate for my kids, there is no torture, rape, blood, shooting, and very little violence.  As a result, when the villain kills even one person, it's appropriately shocking and sufficient evidence of his evil.  He doesn't have to have a huge body count or level a city.  I am so tired of super-villains smashing New York City.  We had real planes smashing us, people.  It's too soon.  Anyway, the four main characters are refreshingly real, they have feelings and flaws and hopes and dreams, all derailed by their exposure to a weird space storm of some sort.  They slowly begin to realize that they have been altered, and their reactions differ based on what their mutations are and what their personalities are.  Usually in these movies there is one person dealing with their super-mutation alone, but in this case there are four, and they have to learn to work as a team when the fifth mutant decides he wants to get rid of them and, presumably, take over the world.  By the end they have come to terms with their new states, and even the guy who got turned into a rock monster has chosen to continue that way rather than be mutated back.  So, the plot is primarily about the process of discovering and coming to terms with new superpowers, and it's a good metaphor for anyone's coming of age story.  And the progression to superheroes is sufficiently believable, even explaining the practical reasons for their matching suits.  I give it 5 stars because in its human-centric story and lack of violence, it accomplishes what movies like Man of Steel could not, even with all the eye-popping smashing.",1395705600,,1783,4.691318327974277

As the story opens, Sue Storm and Reed Richards prepare for their upcoming, superhero-studded wedding celebration. But Reed cannot stay focused on the nuptials -- he's distracted by wire reports of a bizarre, comet-like object hurtling toward the Earth with tremendous force, triggering brownouts, blackouts, tropical storms, and various other climatological disasters. When the said object hits the island of Manhattan, destroying much of the city in its wake, its identity becomes resoundingly clear. ""It"" is actually a ""he"" the Sentinel of the Spaceways known as The Silver Surfer who intends to destroy much of the Earth, just as he obliterated dozens of planets before it. Feeling compelled to rally their old gang and save the day, Sue and Reed summon Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm to take on the Surfer -- and end up battling not only him, but an obnoxious Army general (Andre Braugher) and the cantankerous Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who has broken out of his icy prison that held him captive at the end of the first movie.

Jessica Alba is nice to look at but she's of absolutely no interest once she opens her mouth.

This is a movie that was made just to make money.

The same casting problems I had in the first movie are still in this one. The only actor who really makes their character pop and work is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm. This  movie makes me realise why he was SO reluctant to take on the role of Captain America.  He easily could have gone into the same sort of parody acting he did in Not Another Teen Movie and still been the best actor in the film, however, he didn't so in comparison with the rest of the cast he just shines.

The writing was very sophomoric both in terms of dialogue and plotting.

The special effects are pretty good. The action sequences suffer from the same writing problems--there isn't really any tension that makes me compelled to keep watching.  The relationship between Sue and Reed just seems convenient.",1388620800,,839,4.480263157894737

1547367,2,B00005JNTU,"This is a movie that just tries to do much and does nothing well. Fans of the comics will recognize many themes: the wedding of Sue Storm and Reed Richards, the coming of Galactus, and Dr. Doom trying to steal the Powers of the Silver Surfer. Unfortunately, they really jumbled togather. The return of Dr. Doom was unnecessary and again highlights how poor a villain the movie Dr. Doom is.

The plot is unfocused and there are some good moments, but it feels like they belong in another film. For example, a General mocks Reed for having not played High School football and Reed delivers a sizzling comeback about how awesome he is and how much respect he should receive which would have been great if obtaining the respect of the military had anything to do with the movie.

The movie is full of stuff that doesn't go anywhere or isn't necessary such as the blatant anti-military message and a portrayal of pointless military torturing of the Silver Surfer. When all this nonsense happens, we're given far too little time to receive a satisfying denoument.

Finally, the heroes often didn't behave heroically: one key incident was arguing during a key battle because Reed and Sue wanted to break up the FF, which would be irrelevant if they didn't complete their mission.  It was stupid as Reed had explained the Earth could come to an end in 8 days if they failed.

1547631,2,B00005JNTU,"Marvel's First Family gets a big screen adaptation that seeks to hew spiritually close to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's original comics, lending a goofy air to the increasingly more serious genre of superhero movies. While this works quite well in the case of Micheal Chicklis's excellent Thing and Chris Evans' Human Torch the central romance of the film between Ioan Gruffund and Jessica Alba is shrill and has the schlocky qualities of a bad romantic comedy. The central villain also is devoid of earned menace, leading to a generic tacked on climax that lacks meaningful stakes. Still, the faithful recreation of the dorky 60's dynamics of the early comics is occasionally quite fun and can feel refreshing next to all of the browbeating seriousness of Nolan's Batman trilogy and the films that would duplicate it. Maybe it's just nice to see a movie that doesn't try so hard to be cool.",1371772800,,887,4.842105263157895

The Silver Surfer shows a vulnerability and yet, an innate heroism while rejecting Dr. Doom and protecting Sue that adds a depth to his character that humanizes him in spite of his silver coloring. All of the 4 seem to be more comfortable with their characters, almost making you believe in the ""love"" between the Invisible Girl and Mr. Fantastic, and the deeper commitment of Johnny Torch is very welcome indeed. Even more appealing is the newly-found happiness of Ben. His constant misery and self-pity in the first movie was wearing on the nerves. This is a terrific movie for us Sci-Fi/comic book fans. Corny?

I did not like what they did to Mr. Fantastic's hair though; it was very distracting: They either cut the sides very short or painted white for some reason and I was trying to figure out which one during the entire movie. I hope they make the 3rd one where Mr. Fantastic and Sue have the super baby.
As far as the amazon.com instant streaming goes: I love the idea of renting movie like this. However, at times the picture quality suffered due to live traffic on the Internet I guess.

I have to admit I've never been a huge fan of the Fantastic 4 but I try to stay open-minded about sci-fi and comic films. No spoiler here but the ending had great effects and made up for a lot of other short-falls.

Unfortunately, the characters are were very one-dimensional in the first film and the second was no different. I'm not sure if I could just chalk it up to bad acting as I think the script just had poor lines and the cinematography was lacking. This would be a great film for younger viewers who don't demand much in the way of character development or solid story-telling but I don't think it cuts the mustard for a more mature audience.

The score seemed appropriately selected but was poorly timed when setting the mood in different scenes. Worse, the score is EXACTLY what you would expect it to be: high orchestra and scary sounds.

Many of us at that time thought that ""the FF"" was THE best superhero comic book, rivaled only by Spider-Man.  So naturally I was interested in seeing how closely the movie tracked the original Fantastic Four story.

The good news is that it tracks the original story with reasonable fidelity.  Where it departs is mostly for the better, at least in my opinion.  I was particularly pleased at the way the film handled Ben Grimm, The Thing.  Very close to the original story.  I thought that the casting was quite good.  Ioan Gruffudd was very good as Reed Richards, and Jessica Alba is stunning as Susan Storm.  (The only dubious part is where Reed Richards is too distracted by science to pursue Susan Storm; I don't care how much of a bookworm you are, she is just too gorgeous and appealing in this film to ignore, and that is the end of it.)

There is actually more of a storyline here than with some other superhero flicks.  I never found my attention wandering during the movie; it held my interest throughout and this is a great film to watch with the family.  Recommended.  RJB.",1355616000,,1172,4.471698113207547

1548242,2,B00005JNTU,"This superhero movie was billed as one of the summer blockbusters of 2007.  Unfortunately, it shares the dominant character traits of summer blockbusters: over-the-top action as a cover-up for a weak script.  The basic premise is that a giant dust cloud from outer space (Galactus) is about to destroy the earth--and ruin Sue Storm and Reed Richards' wedding in the process (I am not kidding).  The Silver Surfer arrives as the forerunner of Galactus, preparing the earth for consumption.  As the Fantastic Four spring into action, they find an unlikely ally in Dr. Doom--or is he?

The acting is mixed.  Chris Evans shines as Johnny Storm, but Jessica Alba was miscast as Sue Storm.  Andre Braugher, normally luminescent, comes off as cranky and one-dimensional in limited screen time.  Laurence Fishburne adds pathos as the voice of the Silver Surfer.  Dr. Doom seems tangential to the plot.  He is dispatched in the most summary fashion at the end.  It seems like the editor could not wait to finish this movie (which runs a short 92 minutes--including credits).  Perhaps a number of scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.

Sadly, not all of the special effects were up-to-par.  The Silver Surfer looked perfect, but the CGI drew attention to itself in other scenes.

The blu-ray transfer is quite good, both audio and visual.  While there is some film grain in interior shots, it is mild.  It is a definite upgrade to the DVD.

Parental Advisory: This movie contains superhero violence, some light profanity, one scene with suggestive dancing and a scene where a female character is presumably naked in public (although nothing can be seen).

The only issue I have with it is the casting of Jessica Alba as the Invisible Woman but now that they have done two films with her I have just dealt with it.

This is the origin of the Fantastic Four and their arch-villain Dr. Doom. The film mostly deals with the four main characters coming to terms with their changes after being exposed to cosmic rays while in space. There are a few side stories like the three way romance between Reed Richards, Sue Storm and Von Doom. There is also a story line dealing with the demise of Von Doom's financial enterprise.

In the end the four main characters must join forces to defeat a power hungry Von Doom who ends up being the bad guy.

As my Amazon review of the movie attests, I generally enjoyed the first ""Fantastic Four"" movie, but found it a little too short and abrupt.  ""Fantastic Four - The Rise of the Silver Surfer"" (hereafter FF2) is also too short and abrupt, but this time it really bothered me.  I guess I was annoyed this time because FF2 was attempting to chronicle the cosmic saga of two of Marvel's most iconic, legendary characters - Galactus and the Silver Surfer in little over an hour and a half.  These two inordinately powerful but mysterious beings deserved a movie of epic length, scope, and gravity.  FF2's rushed tale of our superhuman quartet's encounter with these planetary threats was a considerable disservice to Stan Lee's and Jack Kirby's classic creations.

The Silver Surfer and Galactus were not the only rush jobs in FF2.  The quartet themselves felt rushed.  In the comics, the team took some time to develop their reputation as Earth's Greatest Heroes.  In the first movie, the team was just starting to get public acclaim.  In this sequel, they're already celebrated heroes.  It might have been better to include more scenes - perhaps an intervening movie even - showing the quartet fighting other criminals and villains and establishing their ""street cred"".  Perhaps the sequel should have continued the team's conflict with Doctor Doom and his quest for world domination, or any kind of domination.  Instead, Doc Doom is a bit player and a minor annoyance in FF2.  Also, we have to take it on faith that the team is now one of New York's Finest and so deserve a little time to plan Reed and Sue's wedding.  On the whole, I didn't have trouble with the events leading to Reed and Sue's near-wedding; it was humorous and diverting and even had Stan Lee's cameo unsuccessfully trying to crash the party.  But again, it came too soon; we need to have some serious stuff happen first.

The serious stuff, though late, does arrive.  A silvery entity riding a board interrupts the nuptials and causes city panic.  Soon after, it causes worldwide panic and cataclysmic disasters.  It even temporarily endows the team with the ""power"" to exchange abilities. Working in cooperation with the U.S. army and impatiently demanding general (Andre Braugher), Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) gradually manages to track down the Surfer and figure out what powers he has. The team rushes around the globe trying to stop or at least contain the menace.  This can only be done by (improbably and unforgivably) physically separating the Surfer from his board and leaving him powerless.  Reed accomplishes this and the army imprisons the Surfer.  Sue (Jessica Alba) somehow intuits that the Surfer is benign and invisibly slips in to communicate with him.  She learns what all Surferphiles already know; he is an alien called Norrin Radd who made a Faustian deal with the planet devourer Galactus to become his new herald in exchange for sparing his world.  As a herald, the Surfer scouts out living planets for his master's appetite.  That is why he is on Earth.  Sue somehow dissuades him from this task and with her partners' assistance helps him escape.  However, meanwhile, Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon) slinks in the background and somehow acquires the surfboard and thus the Surfer's abilities.  The impetuous Johnny Storm uses his new-found superpower-sharing abilities to wrest the board from Doom and return it to the Surfer (oops, I forgot, voiced by Larry Fishburne).  Just in time, too, bacause Galactus the funky ominous cloud is coming.  Amazingly, the turncoat surfer checks his erstwhile master's advance and saves the world, but is knocked unconscious and floating in the void (vainly (?) waiting for another sequel).  Reed and Sue finally have their wedding.  What about the Thing/Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis)?  He saves a helicopter from crashing into the wedding party, stops a ferris wheel from collapsing, scares away a bear (don't ask), and some other heroic things.

FF2 is not a total debacle, and I basically did enjoy it (otherwise, I wouldn't have bought the DVD).  The characters do not disgrace themselves, the action is more intense and critical, the special effects were globe-spanning and impressive, and the Silver Surfer is appropriately mysterious, pensive, wise, and extremely powerful.  But again, it happened so fast and ended too quickly.  The Surfer's powers do NOT depend on his board and he would not have been rendered powerless so easily. Doctor Doom should not have claimed the board's power that quickly or been defeated so quickly by Johnny (and by extension, his partners).  Galactus is a gigantic humanoid demigod who is a universal, nigh unstoppable force of nature, not some pushover cloud.

Therefore, I want to leave this message to the members of the Fantastic Four franchise:  You have all the ingredients for making an epic superhero saga.  Just slow down and take your time in employing those ingredients.

Don't rush!",1327449600,,4998,5.02187120291616
1548468,4,B00005JNTU,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

Although I am a reasonably avid Fantastic Four fan, I continually procrastinated in attending a theater viewing because of the negatively vehement disappointment ""professional"" critics and mere mortals have been heaping on it. However,  I finally plucked up enough resolve to go see it. The verdict? My trepidation was basically groundless.

The ""Fantastic Four"" (hereafter FF) possesses and displays most of the ingredients for an engrossing ""superhero"" motion picture: involving story, appealing and sympathetic characters, lavish and largely convincing special effects and set-pieces, an appropriately sinister and amoral antagonist, a complex but nimble plot, and refreshing humor. No, it is not a brooding, tortured, haunted movie in the overwrought ""Batman"" mode.  The FF doesn't roll that way. Apparently Tim Story decided to adhere to the spirit and tone of the original 60's manifestation of the comic book: an exploration of the ultimate nuclear family. The FF's predominant theme is not the power/responsibility inter-dynamic(like Spiderman), or a psychotic obsession with vengeful crimefighting (like Batman). Instead, FF engagingly unites ""Lilo and Stitch""'s and Sister Sledge's themes of ""We are family, where nobody gets left behind.""

Furthermore, despite its light approach, FF is actually a sensible movie. If cosmic storm energy reconfigured your DNA, you wouldn't (or shouldn't) go running off immediately to fight crime. As our colorful quartet, and even Victor von Doom (aka Dr. Doom) wisely do, they medically analyze their new conditions and powers to see if any potentially harmful side effects may occur. For example, even the brash and impulsive Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) observes, and I paraphrase, ""Ben seems to be the only one who can't turn his power on and off. What if that happens to us?"" Of course, such introspection can be taken to an extreme, as the pensive Reed Richards (aka Mr. Fantastic) (Ioan Gruffudd) fully demonstrates in the movie, as he quarantines his partners and himself in a desperate attempt to reverse the storm's effects. But such cerebral caution characterizes Reed. Anyway, the FF movie provides counterpoint to the foursome's seclusion with Johnny's impetuous and successful desire to ""bust out"" and enjoy his incendiary new powers.

The FF movie also plausibly and poignantly details the anguish, frustration, and shocked despair Benjamin Jacob Grimm (aka Thing)(Michael Chiklis) endures. If you found yourself imprisoned in a granite exoskeleton, wouldn't you do what Ben does - literally break out of the hospital facility, conceal your identity, and cautiously attempt to reconnect with your fiance? Wouldn't you swim in sullen self-pity? Ben does these things, but unlike most of us, who would probably go on an insane rampage or attempt to commit suicide, he possesses enough resiliency (Mr. Fantastic isn't the only one) and nobility to try to come to grips with his grotesque fate, even using a little grim (no pun intended) humor to cope. The saving of the bridge jumper's, the trucker's and the New York fire department's lives help illuminate this ""brute""'s soul of gold. Victor's unhinged horror at his own parallel titanium transformation further reflects positively on Ben's tenacity and courage. Chiklis embraces the Thing's character and owns it. A movie with him alone would still definitely be the price of admission.

Admittedly, the FF does deviate from realistic behavior. For example, I would agree that Susan Storm (aka the Invisible Woman) (Jessica Alba) is not a conventional idea of a genetic scientist, but she is no flighty bimbo either. She is an alluring but sweet, shy, and caring individual. As another example, the New York public warm up to the super-powered quartet a little too rapidly and unambiguously. After all, shouldn't they be a bit disturbed at the Brooklyn bridge accident, even if it was accidental? Maybe Ben's rescue of the FDNY firefighters (symbols of 9/11 heroism) helped sway public opinion. Finally, Ben's erstwhile fianc, I don't think, would be so callous as to unceremoniously leave his engagement ring on the bridge after his heroic act. If she really cared for Ben, wouldn't she more discreetly mail it back to him. Finally (spoiler here), how did Ben Grimm, after requiring Victor's electrical boost in the simulation chamber to revert to normal, find the same power in Victor's absence to transform back to the Thing in a -yes- self-sacrificing act to help his friends? It seems a bit too abrupt.

Yet, as my summary indicates, abruptness, as I see it, is the FF movie's only true weakness. The movie is a bit too breezy at times. For example, Ben's encounter with the blind but discerning Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington) could have been developed more at length. Ditto with Reed and Sue's reconciliation. Victor's Anankin-like descent to brooding, Darth Vader-like evil needed a bit more room to grow. Both the bridge sequence and the climactic battle against Doom were a bit truncated. Nevertheless, these are minor criticisms.

The FF is solidly rousing, accessible, uplifting entertainment.  In some ways, the movie compares to the original 1978 movie ""Superman"", which, as you recall, also had its share of adapting to stark social and superpower changes, goofy action sequences, wholesome humor, and broad, cartoonish villains. FF remains faithful to its origins while simultaneously blazing its own comic cinema trail. It has successfully introduced its inimitable clan to the movie world.

Now, in the comic, the FF is not only concerned with family, but also with galactic cosmic concerns, a la Galactus, the Silver Surfer, the Watchers, the Skrulls, et al. The FF sequels, and I hope there are a few, should address some of these universal themes. ""The Trial of Galactus"" storyline would be ideal, and perhaps satisfy the pretentiously persnickety critics who complain that comic themes are too superficial. If FF can correct its ""shortness"" problem in subsequent films, it should dramatically prove those critics wrong.

As Stan Lee (mailman Willie Lumpkin in the movie) would say:

Excelsior!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

P.S.:  I guess somebody listened to my suggestion.  The FF sequel introduces the Silver Surfer and Galactus.  However, to me the sequel was a precipitous disappointment.  But that is for another review.",1327017600,2,6390,5.322420634920635
1548469,3,B00005JNTU,"The truth is I don't expect much from comic book movies: flashy special effects, over-the-top plot lines, sympathetic if simplistic characters, and a decent adrenaline rush. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" fails to provide even that much.

It's not so much a problem of writing or characterization--which are both poor compared to something like Spider-Man 2; the problem is that somehow, the movie lacks dramatic weight. It just didn't make me care about the events or the characters...or even the action. While the various cartoons don't really have any more dramatic weight, they have more humor, and only had to sustain the plot for 30 or 60 minutes.

1548475,4,B00005JNTU,"Very entertaining action flick with very good situations for the Fantastic foursome against Dr. Doom & helped by a galactic creature called the Silver Surfer. You know, when directors and art people of Hollywood get together to make a picture, it's not always for the intention to make a hardcore classic movie.  Some do it for profit, some for sheer fun of movie making.  The superhero genre ranges from supreme classics like Superman-the movie to sheer drop outs like The Incredible Hulk. This lands somewhere in between, with many fine situations like accidental switching's of powers between the heroes. All in all, there are many action sequences, and I kinda wish they would continue to make these sort of non committing entertainment superhero movies with no flair for making a Gone With The Wind masterpiece intention, but just share good times with lovable characters that inter-wind with each other in drama, calamity, and comedy.
I mean, what else do you need with soda and popcorn, anyway! Its like expecting culinary entertainment with junk food. I'll take the hot dog premise any day than some movie that is supposed to drip in hard romance, theory, and moral lesson which I learned back in high school. I just want to have fun at the movies, not dealt hard cards and drama cases by the dozens. The Green Lantern was another issue with this, it was fun and harmless, which to my recollection, was very similar to the fun corny superhero TV shows of yesterday. No kid in their right mind got up on Saturday mornings yearning for a geography lesson, or a tearful lingering drama, they just wanted action and fun, and that is what this movie has, boasts, and follows through with.",1309996800,2,1691,4.8075601374570445
1548535,5,B00005JNTU,What can I say.... as a 58 year old man that read almost all of the Fantastic Four comics when I was young...  And Jessica Alba is SO HOT (forget Johnny Storm when it comes to 'heat' output).,1305331200,,191,4.026315789473684
1548536,5,B00005JNTU,I love the movie and the service was great. The best seller I came across so far. 5 star service will buy again.,1301961600,,112,3.9130434782608696
1548537,3,B00005JNTU,"I'll start by saying I'm a fan of the comics.  When I first heard about this movie, I knew I'd be disappointed.  I'd never been impressed with Jessica Alba and I knew they'd screw up Dr. Doom.  Doom is one of the finest villains in comics; bombastic, powerful, ethically ambiguous and deeply complex.  It's flat-out impossible to give Doom any justice by shoehorning him into the FF's back story.  On my second point, I had been correct; they put Doom on the ship with them, giving him powers Doom never had and truncating him from an eastern European tyrant who's equal parts mad scientist and evil sorcerer twisted more by his perceived need for revenge than by the physical scars that warranted his trademark iron mask into a corrupt corporate executive with a petty grudge.  Also, Julian McMahon, who failed to garner my sympathy or hatred as Cole/Balthazar on Charmed, fails to live up to Doom's larger-than-life presence completely.

The first time I watched it, I thought of Doom as the lynchpin of the story, as he's the catalyst for nearly every plot point, and I didn't like it.  Watching this movie as a fan of the comics doesn't really work.  However, between that and my second watching, I'd considered the perspective that this movie wasn't really intended for me.  It breaks my heart as a comics fan to say this, but superhero comics are not mainstream; even as Batman and Spider-man have reeled in record box office numbers for the last ten years or so, these movies aren't really the gateway to comic books that Batman (1989) was for me.  As such, the FF are not widely known in the mainstream like they once were; no alternate media adaptation of the team has been as popular as the Hannah-Barbera cartoon from the '60s, and Joe Satriani's fondness for the Silver Surfer probably lost its pull in the '70s, so for over thirty years there's been no real opportunity for the Fantastic Four to cross media and attain the mainstream popularity to match the fondness for them we comics fans have.  They're not called ""Comics' first family"" for nothing, nor does their series falsely label itself the ""world's greatest superhero magazine,"" because historically, it has been.  Unfortunately, what makes these characters great is the exact thing that makes them difficult to translate into a movie: they're complicated.  Batman, Superman and Spider-man are simple characters with simple origins; you can easily tell that story and introduce a prominent villain in 90 minutes.  Not so the FF, and certainly not so Dr. Doom.

Identifying that mainstream viewers wouldn't have the love for these characters that my fellow comics fans share, I watched it again, stripped of any comics-based preconceptions I may have.  It doesn't matter that Dr. Doom wasn't on the ship in the comics, because this is not that character.  As an origin story, it's not great.  Maybe the story elements don't age all that well from when Jack Kirby and Stan Lee came up with them, or maybe in more competent hands they would have made it work better.  That said, I felt the four actors -- Ioan Gruffud, Michael Chiklis, Jessica Alba and Chris Evans -- performed their parts well, creating a believable family.  The relationships were strained, but held together with the sort of bonds that come from shared experiences.  It's why Ben Grimm sticks around as long as he does, even as his patience grows thinner and thinner; it's why Johnny Storm is forgiven time and again despite his aching need to be out in the public eye when the rest of the team demands that he stay put; they're a family.  They know each other and they trust each other, and even in the face of irritatingly smug villains and stupid plot points, the movie works as a character piece.

On top of all that, the movie just looks good; the Human Torch effects especially look just great, and Invisible Woman and Mr. Fantastic, while a bit obvious, look pretty good; obvious CG occasionally rears its head, but never when it matters.  Finally, there's the Thing.  Don't get me wrong; the costume and make-up departments did their jobs well.  However, as large as Michael Chiklis is, he's just a big guy, and in the Thing costume, he's huge, but that's not what this character should have been -- I say this both as a fan of the comics and as a viewer -- because the impact of his change on his environment and the people around him suggest that the Thing should be simply monstrous.  I say if they can make the 6'-1"" John Rhys-Davies a 4""-nothing dwarf, they can make the 5'-8"" Michael Chikliss 7""+.  Believability of scale notwithstanding, however, his performance was excellent; the tragedy of becoming a monster, followed by the acceptance of that condition -- in a grand scale; most adaptations have him just accept it, but curing him and having him impose the condition on himself when he's needed makes the character far more noble.

So, if you're a fan of the comics, I offer this piece of advice: ignore Doom.  Pretend he's the Mad Thinker (his performance is a lot closer to him anyway).  Just focus on the FF, and I think you'll enjoy it.  If you're not a fan of the comics... actually, I offer the same advice.  Just ignore Doom.  He's badly cast, sloppily written and clumsily performed; Julian McMahon must have some incriminating photos because he certainly didn't get all the choice roles he's landed by any sort of merit-based method.  Everyone else does a very good job with their parts and together they create something that, while not brilliant, provides the viewer with a good sense of mad sciency fun and superhero awesome, while maintaining the understanding that these are people with feelings and relationships, not just fist delivery systems.",1301788800,2,5720,4.777439024390244
1548538,3,B00005JNTU,"Unhappily, the film fell far short of even my limited expectations.  Having grown up reading the comic book series, I do not recall a single story that was ""campy.""  Besides not taking itself seriously, the film was thin on tension.  The treatment of Dr. Doom was a travesty.  The actors did the best they could with what they were given, but they could not pull this turkey out of the trenches.  Anyone planning a re-boot MUST go back and study the original series drawn by Jack Kirby to gain any kind of appropriate scope for The Fantastic 4.  This was one of Marvel's best-selling titles.

As I watched this wreck I couldn't help but think these are the very last people anyone should entrust with super powers.  Everyone in this movie has an attitude problem (what are the odds?), including the nondescript surfer dude, Andre Braugher, representing the army, and his crabby blonde sidekick.
That they also dug up their old nemesis (Julian McMahon) for another go around, was sad indeed.  With less to do, he's even more of a cipher than he was in the first movie (the only one with even less expression than Julian was the surfer dude).  Silly mask and hooded cape notwithstanding, Julian still can't evoke menace.
As for THE destroyer, MMMM-yeah, big space storm clouds, now that's really scary.  They needed a weather man, not 4 incompetent super heroes to solve this one.

It took just a few minutes into the movie for it to become evident why this was such a major fizzle.  The dialog is corny, delivered by people trying too hard or not hard enough to be hip and funny.  It didn't help that the characters/actors were either extremely obnoxious (Chris Evans) or deadly dull (Ioan Gruffudd).  The relationships were dubious at best (did they hate each other on sight or because of some mysterious history or did they just love to bicker?).  The special effects are hohum, seen them all before.  The story was all about establishing the characters and if, like myself, you didn't like the characters/actors, what was there left to watch?
And as for that lame GQ villain!  He couldn't even muster up a credible snarl.  As villains go he was all costume.

1548626,4,B00005JNTU,"Fantastic Four was better than Daredevil, but not as fantastic as either of the two X-Men. Someone said that, and that sums up the Fantastic Four pretty well. 2 + 2 = 4. Or does it?

Fantastic Four was one of the original Marvel Comics, and it ran the longest. The film version stayed pretty true to the spirit of the original by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, but it was a pretty old fashioned story to begin with. Sure there were little updates here and there, topical references to Dr. Phil, Donald Trump, X-Games, Larry King---wait, Larry King was probably around before the Fantastic Four even began? Anyway, I think that they did a good job, and there were great special effects, but in this day and age, it just doesn't thrill us, because people have become much more cynical and jaded. But let's take a closer look:

First of all, Jessica Alba is a major star. She hasn't been in that many films yet, but somehow she has just arrived on the scene, and you know that she was made to be a movie star. She also seems like she is a down-to-earth and likeable person. In this film, though, her super power as Sue Storm is that she turns invisible, and also has an invisible force field that she throws around. OK, now let's think for a moment. You have someone who looks like Jessica Alba, and she is invisible? That seems like a huge waste.

-----------------------
Susan Storm: [invisible] Look at me!
Reed Richards: I can't.
===================

They play around a bit with having her take her clothes off, because her clothes aren't invisible, and then sometimes she can't control her power so well at first, so she reappears in embarassing situations.

-----------------------
Susan Storm: [stripping off her clothes while trying to escape the mob] I can't believe I'm doing this again!
===================

'Nuff said! Now we have her brother, Johnny Storm. He is kind of a show off, so his power of bursting into flames really suits him. Chris Evans made a great Johnny Storm. Check him out in The Losers, too. He really steals every scene he's in, both in The Losers and in Fantastic Four. Word on the street is that he is also going to be Captain America when that is made into a movie. Johnny and Ben Grimm have a real rapport going. Actually, they don't get along at all.

-----------------------
Ben Grimm: Hey, no more wise cracks about the way I look.
Johnny Storm: Hey, call me Mr. Sensitivity.
Johnny Storm: [walking through the crowd] Okay, wide load coming through! Everybody move! He's huge!
Ben Grimm: Hey! Come here, Mr. Sensitive.
Johnny Storm: Flame on!
Ben Grimm: Show-off!
[Johnny flies into the sky to make a fiery 4]
===================

Johnny is a player, anxious to use his fame and flame to get women, money, and good times. He walks into a bar, walks up to a group of beautiful women, and says ""I need names... and shots. Bartender!"" Wish I could display that kind of bravado. Ben Grimm, on the other hand, feels like no one could ever love him, that he is a hideous monster. Ben Grimm is played by Michael Chiklis, and therein lies his problem: Chiklis = Chick Less. No wonder he's lonely. I guess that Michael Chiklis could really relate to the Ben Grimm character, and that is why he did such an outstanding job.

-----------------------
Susan Storm: We're all in this together, Ben.
Ben Grimm: Together? Susie, look at me. You got no idea what I'd - what I'd give to be invisible.
===================

Against all odds he does hook up, though. Hey, if Bukowski could get women, there's hope for the rest of us. Even Benjamin Grimm. He encounters a black, blind woman in a bar, who is really beautiful. She is played by Kerry Washington.

-----------------------
Alicia Masters: You know, being different isn't always a bad thing.
Ben Grimm: Trust me, this ain't one of them times.
Alicia Masters: Not if you don't want it to be.
===================

They share a moment together, but you wish they would have delved into this relationship a little deeper. Where is this going? Does Alicia Masters appear in the sequel? Stay tuned, same Grimm time, same Grimm channel.

-----------------------
Ben Grimm: You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
Alicia Masters: Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship.
Ben Grimm: [sounding more hopeful than realistic] This ain't permanent. My friend Reed is working on a cure... I think.
Alicia Masters: Bennie... you feel good 'as is'.
===================

Speaking of relationships, there is a kind of triangle between Reed Richards, Sue Storm, and Victor von Doom. Reed was with Sue, but they broke up.

-----------------------
Susan Storm: [to Reed] You're such a dork.
===================

Now Reed, the cerebral sort that he is, thinks that Sue is better off with her boss, the rich and powerful von Doom. She is waiting for Reed to react, to fight for her love, but while he is super intelligent when it comes to physics, he is a wash out with chemistry, namely, he can't see that he and Sue have lots of chemistry together. The actor who plays Reed is all right, but with a name like Ioan Gruffudd he has to be good. It's Welsh, by the way. Now Reed Richards can stretch and bend his body into any shape. You wonder when they are going to get to the question: Any body part? Would they go there? They go there.

-----------------------
X Games Reporter: [about Reed] Is it true what they say about him? That he can expand *any* part of his anatomy?
===================

Not only could he do that, he could also be his own prophylactic. Bada bing bada boom. In spite of his unlimited potential, he gallantly steps aside, until Victor comes out of the closet in full on Dr. Doom drag:

-----------------------
Victor Von Doom: Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts?
Susan Storm: Victor, you *always* thought you were a god. Now back off.
Victor Von Doom: Susan, let's not fight.
Susan Storm: No, let's!
===================

Yes, let's! The Bottom Line is that Fantastic Four is more than adequate, but the story, even with the contemporary updates, is still pretty old fashioned. Jessica Alba is lovely, but we'd like to see more of her. But you can't, because she's invisible. Flame on. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis had a handle on their characters, and both of them really stood out. It's clobberin' time! Ioan Gruffudd and Julian McMahon held down the fort as Mr. Fantastic and Dr. Doom, respectively. The sultry and sensual Kerry Washington showed a lot of potential--let's hope she returns in the sequel. Great special effects. Pow! Bang! Ker-blooey! To recap: Better than Daredevil, but not as fantastic as either of the X-men movies.

-----------------------
X Games Reporter: [referring to Ben] What is that? What do you call that thing?
Johnny Storm: That's it - the Thing. Yeah, you think this is bad, you should have seen him before!
Ben Grimm: Okay. Now I'm gonna go kill him!

Combining juiced-up special effects, trademark Marvel Comics depth of character, and the return of the original acting team, it finds the Fantastic Four--Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud), the Invisible Woman/Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), the Human Torch/Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), and the Thing/Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis)--settled into their roles as popularly-accepted superhero crime-fighters, albeit not without a generous helping of humor, and struggling to find a way to fit Reed and Sue's long-hoped-for wedding in around the obligations of herohood.  Then a series of unexplained cosmic, and earth-scale, phenomena bring the Army to their door in the person of Gen. Hager (Andre Braugher), who wants Reed to investigate.  The disturbances are the work of an enigmatic being who comes to be known as the Silver Surfer (Laurence Fishburne/Doug Jones), and who is in fact a ""herald"" for a planet-eating entity he calls Galactus.  And Earth is slated to be served up as the latter's next meal.  To make matters worse, Hager expects the Four to work with Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon), who has ideas of his own about the whole affair.

Stuff that sucked worse:
Acting
Campy Writing
Galactus
Stuff that Sucked the Same:
Dr. Doom
The Thing
Stuff that Sucked none at all
The Surfer
The Human Torch
The inclusion of Latveria

Ok her is the plot:
Reed and Sue want to get married but cant due to superhero lifestyle, Johnny is a shameless endorsement / media whore, Ben seems ok with his hot blind black girlfriend.
Surfer crashes the wedding and screws up Johnny's DNA. The military enlists the 4 to help smoke the Surfer, they blow it.
Military now enlists the additional help of Doom much to the chagrin of the 4.
Reed builds a gizmo to mess with the surfer, it works, but not before Sue connects with the Surfer and decides he is ""just misunderstood"".
Surfer is tortured, Doom betrays all, Reed says ""I told you so.""
Doom is so super-duper bad now that he has the Surfers board and Johny pretty much turns into a Super-Skrull, just no Thanos chin, pointy ears or galactic domination bent. Johnny beats the jelly out of Doom.
Surfer sacrifices himself to save earth...or does he?

1548633,2,B00005JNTU,"Fan Four 2 is better than the first movie, but the necessity for a reboot has always existed.  Both movies are a hard mediocre instead of good.  Making the Fantastic Four a family franchise proved fruitless for Fox, and now it's time to give the rights back to Marvel.  What Marvel will do is create a franchise that is faithful to the comics while still attracting a large audience.  FF 2 tried to fix the problems in the origin, but ended up trading them in for new ones.

There are a couple things I like about this film that encourage me to give the movie 3 stars.  Don Payne's writing wasn't bad, but a lot of valuable material was cut from the film.  In his commentary he states ""I wrote an explanation for this action in the script, but they cut it out.""  This problem was exposed in numerous points of the films commentary.  For that, I give credit to the writer for at least coming up with a decent story, however butchered it was.  I also enjoy the comedic tone of the film.  It stays in close proximity of the comedy from the first film, so it feels like a connected franchise.

So those few points and the improvement on CGI/Action keep me watching the movie.  There are more numerous problems I have with the movie in contrast.  Doom is shoe-horned and lame.  Silver Surfer's powers are undefined and he did not need Lawrence Fishbourne.  Jessica Alba's hair and contacts make her look like an alien or a mutant.  And lastly, my problem with Tim Story. Story proves his unworthiness to direct a Marvel film throughout this blu-ray disc.  In the behind-the-scenes segments he seems uninterested with the film and more intrigued with the drink after work.  He says things like ""I had to leave this part out explaining why this happens, but due to pacing I had to scrap it.""  He left so many plotholes open, and the result is a mess.  There are so many unexplained things in this film that cause one to lose interest.

Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is without a doubt one of the worst comic book movies, next to its predecessor.  Like LXG it's just fun to look at.  With all the plotholes and distractions, it's hard to like the movie.  The blu-ray disc has great segments to offer us comic book fans, but that becomes the main reason to buy the disc.  Fan Four needs a reboot at the hands of Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios.  Give this ensemble epic to a talented director like Joss Whedon and not some sleepy could-care-less director like Tim Story.",1275436800,2,2472,4.472035794183445

That casting is part of the problem. I thought Chris Evans was funny as Johnny ""Torch."" However, Jessica Alba as a scientist? I'm sorry, that's just casting so against type that it doesn't work. There's also no plot or emotional depth. The film tries to add some morality with Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), but it just seems superficial (an the silly orange costume doesn't help).

The real problem is Julian McMahon as Victor Van Doom. I've always said a good movie needs a compelling villain. Van Doom's just a horrible, superficial villain. His only motive appears to be the lust for more power - so boring and cliche. He also has some of the corniest lines in the movie. For example, during the middle of the climatic fight scene, when zapping Jessica Alba with lightning, he says ""Susan, you're fired!"" That really breaks the mood and tension of the scene.

1548719,2,B00005JNTU,"I was anxious to see this movie happen, but at the same time I doubted that they could get it right.  My suspicions became true when Fantastic Four released and critics bullied the film.  It's really not good.  The special effects don't even make up for its flaws.  I'm suprised to see that it warranted a sequel, even though it disappointed fans as well as general public.  FF2 was better, but the origin is a poor film, that I keep in my library for the sake of collecting comic book movies.

What went wrong: It's mainly targeted for kids.  This = Bad Idea.  Kids didn't really connect with it, because it's older source material that applies to teenagers and adults.  It should have been targeted towards an older audience.

Jessica Alba? No, you are not fooling anyone with that blonde hair.  This idea became a large distraction throughout the film.

All other supporting cast- Ioan Gruffudd was a quiet Mr. Fantastic with no connection to the character.  He felt as if his accent was troubling his performance, therefore he could not feel the shoes he was in.  Julian McMahon was a cheesy Doom.  That villain deserves so much better.

What I happened to like: Humor was spot on.  If you're going to make a F4 film, you have to have the humor between The Thing and Johnny Storm.  None of it felt out of place, they got it right here.

Michael Chiklis as The Thing.  Can you really think of someone who could play it better?

Broad usage of powers.  I liked that they kept layering the powers throughout most of the scenes, because we can't digress from the point of superhero movies.

So it's not good, and you'll only get me to watch it once every 10 blue moons.  I like the sequel much more, even though both of the films are low on the list of good comic book movies.  Hopefully Fox will give the rights back to Marvel, so they can get this film right.  Furthermore, Fox shortchanged us on the Blu-ray release.  Why not put the extended version on blu instead?  The extended cut was much better in my opinion.  All we get on this disc is the theatrical film with one commentary.  If you're planning on getting this for your comic book movie blu-ray collection, get it at a real discount price.  Nothing over ten bucks.",1274659200,2,2227,4.478802992518704
1548720,3,B00005JNTU,"""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is large step up from it's goofy predecessor.

They deliver their lines with so much cheese that the humor and romance seem silly and the drama, action and science-fiction elements seen hokey. It's a shame because this could have been exciting and imaginative. I think that the worst part of the film is that director Tim Story has no sense of how to properly edit an action scene.

1548814,2,B00005JNTU,"Fantastic Four: 4 out of 10 Some comic book heroes don't translate well to film. Daredevil was a case in point. While a blind guy wearing a cherry red leather outfit might work on the panels of a comic book it looks silly on screen. (Not that this excuses the horrible Daredevil movie mind you) Mr. Fantastic (The stretching guy) of the Fantastic Four suffers this same fate. When he stretches it looks either disgusting (hand squeezing under the crack beneath a door) or quite silly (every other time he stretches.) Not that the character is helped by Ioan Gruffud's somnolent performance. He makes up one third of the most sleep inducing love triangle ever filmed.

The lady in question is the Jessica Alba who looks fantastic in and out of her costume (She turns invisible when naked sorry guys. But some dutiful frame by frame DVD action will surprise the patient) but she expresses no emotion about either man (Or for that matter having superpowers. But I guess looking like Jessica Alba is kind of a superpower in itself).

The third part is our pseudo villain Dr. Doom. (I say pseudo because he turns villain sometime around the closing credits in the most truncated villain performance in the history of superhero films) Dr. Doom as written for the comics is the perfect screen super villain. Which begs the question why he is barely in this movie and more importantly why he is a metrosexual evil businessman (Forced to be evil because his IPO went down in price and the bank is pulling out? This shows a remarkable lack of knowledge how IPO's work) When Alba tells Gruffud she never slept with Doom we have to believe her. I have a hard time believing these saccharine characters go the bathroom let alone have sex.

The other two members of the four (Evans and Chiklis) give competent if one note performances. But by the time all the introductions and back-story is completed the movie is over. With no villain, unimaginative action set pieces and some shaky special effects Fantastic Four is more mediocre than fantastic. Though there is that one frame of a not quite invisible Alba that is Fantastic indeed.",1268870400,2,2121,4.727027027027027
1548815,3,B00005JNTU,"In the interest of full disclosure, let me state for the record that I hated the first Fantastic Four movie.  I had once attributed this possible hatred to my projecting issues in my life the day I saw it (i.e. a nasty breakup) onto the movie and this hated it unfairly.  Then when this movie began play on HBO, I decided to give it a second chance.  My final conclusion was that I would have rather found my ex, and had her dump me all over again than watch FF again.  As this is not a review of that movie, I will not go into my VERY long rant about why exactly it represents to me everything that is wrong with the modern comic book movie, so just trust me when I say that it does.

  Having said that, why would I willingly go see the sequel to said load of excrement? There are two reasons.  One, I fricken love the Silver Surfer.  And two, I'm in Cleveland this week doing comedy, and there's really just nothing else to do. Other movies I have seen in Cleveland include School for Scoundrels, Employee of the Month, and the Benchwarmers.

  Is Fantastic Four 2 better than the first one?  Yes.  But that isn't saying much.  I will admit my intense hatred of the first one did cloud my judgement a little.  Especially because I was so annoyed at hearing director Tim Story's comments in articles about the original movie being at a disadvantage because it had to focus on being an origin story.  Really? 'cause Batman Begins spent well over an hour before Batman even appeared on screen, and still managed to be a really good movie. Spiderman dealt with the origins of Peter Parker with finesse and fun.  It's just a lame excuse, in my opinion, and doesn't explain away the true weaknesses of the film.

  So here you go Tim, here was a movie that had no character origins to develop, aside from a quick exposition on the Silver Surfer.  Why then, is it still kind of dull?  I don't know what exactly it is about these two movies but I find myself never ever giving a crap what happens to any of the characters.  The action sequences feel thrill-less and empty, and I still feel like Dr. Doom is being given the short end of the villain stick, and frankly, the attempt at making the obviously-of-latin-descent Jessica Alba look like a blonde-haired, blue-eyed WASP of a girl just makes her look creepy.  The relationship scenes between Sue and Reed made me wish I could stretch myself down the hall and go watch Ocean's 13 instead.  About the only interactions between characters that didn't make me want to slice my own ears off with my movie ticket was the banter between The Thing and Human Torch.

  The Human Torch, AKA Johnny Storm, is given a little more of a conscience in this movie, although there never is really a logical reason for it to happen.  Apparently it stems from a crush he develops on a character he speaks maybe three sentences to throughout the movie.  The love interest exists, I believe, simply because it felt like a love interest should, but it never feels organic or even logical, leading to a payoff with little setup.

  The one thing that part 2 does triumph over the original movie with, is it actually makes the team into heroes.  In the first movie they never really save anyone but themselves, unless it's someone they put in harms way (I'm looking at you, car accident-causing Thing.) In this movie, a threat is established early on and gives them something to actually fight, even if said fighting never amounts to much more than a glorified chase.  But it is still better than spending the entire movie wondering how to get rid of your powers.

  And finally there is one trend I would like to see end it's run in these sort of movies, and I will put a SPOILER SPACE here to give you dear readers a chance to avoid even though I will attempt to be vague about it and not name any actual characters.

  I am sick and tired of the fake death scene.  Enough already.  Stop it.  Stop using that cheap attempt at shocking the audience by giving a character a fatal wound only to miraculously revive them only moments later.  It's not clever storytelling, it's just cliche crap and it reeks of having no real respect for your audience.

1548820,4,B00005JNTU,"I got to see this film again as a rerun on cable, and must say it holds the same charm for me as it did at it's opening.  Reed Richards is a science geek and a dork and Victor is a wise guy who thinks he owns the world, both out to get the love of Sue Storm (played deliciously by Jessica Alba).

With origin stories in comics there is a pretty fast few pages and panels that explain what's going on and it's done.  For a movie though they need to flesh out the characters which I feel they did here.

The space scene where Ben is outside and about to get fried and Victor wants to keep him out there shows who we're dealing with in Victor.  All five get powers from the storm (a deviation from the original comics story but that's fine).

The action scenes include fights with Von Doom and a lot of falling, water, fire and even guided missles in the works.

What works for me in this film are the character development, including the tension of relationships not only between themselves but between themselves and the media.  The media and fans and fads are put into a pretty bright spotlight here.  Not only a comic book  movie but one that relates a message about people as social beings.

Not your usual shoot-em-up sci-fi film.

""Silver Surfer"" was in a lot of ways the better film but we needed Fantastic Four to lay the groundwork.  Hopefully there will be a third film soon.  Great cast.  I especially liked how they handled the blind Alicia (the Thing's girlfriend).

The sequel was directed by Tim Story (""Fantastic Four"" and""Barbershop"") and a screenplay by Don Payne (""My Super Ex-Girfriend"" and ""The Simpsons"") and Mark Frost (""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" and ""Fantastic Four"").  The screenplay is based on a story by Frost and John Turman (""Hulk"" and ""Freedom"") and would feature music by composer John Ottman (""Cellular"", ""X2' and ""Valkyrie"") and cinematography by Larry Blanford (""Eagle Eye"", ""The Kingdom"", ""Night at the Museum"" and ""Smokin' Aces"").

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""FANTASTIC 4 - RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER"" is one of the earlier Blu-ray releases that was able to show off amazing detail with its High Definition 1080p transfer.

The film showcases the detail for the outdoor surroundings.  May it be water or grain of dirt or the green lush forest, detail of these surroundings come alive much more than its DVD counterpart.  Silver Surfer's reflections from the surroundings are reflected through the body and are quite evident and really shine through in HD, Sue Storm (ala Jessica Alba's contacts) showcase her blue eyes, Human Torch's flames come to life and the rocks on Thing's body have more detail.  And there is a high level of vibrancy through the video as colors really come out through the many daylight scenes in the film.  A very awesome transfer from Twentieth Century Fox.

As for audio quality, the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio track sounds quite impressive.  It's one thing to get panning audio directional from the surrounds but to hear the various sound effects through the rear audio was quite nice.  LFE usage is also well-used throughout the film and the overall soundtrack and musical score keeps you immersed throughout the film.  Overall, another impressive audio transfer.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to the ""Fantastic Four"", I suppose you can say that it was a comic book series that I grew up with and absolutely loved (from the John Byrne years to even the 1990's Sue Storm goes sexy  years).

But what many people don't know (who have not read the comic book series) is that the group was never going to be in the same category as X-Men or Spider-Man.  ""Fantastic Four"" has its share of adventure and action but characters such as Reed Richards and even Sue Storm, despite what their characters are put through in the comic book series, they are scientists who have a lot of money and some may seem them as boring while others enjoy Reed's intelligence in constantly saving the world with his inventions.

""Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a film that takes the comic book series and follows the characters similarly and brings one of the coolest characters The Silver Surfer, to the big screen (And hopefully setting up things for an actual Silver Surfer film).

I personally enjoyed this film a lot because you have the group taking on their nemesis Dr. Doom once again but have to go against the planet devourer Galactus. But of course, there are quite a number of problems I have had with the film.

Of course, Galactus is not the large purple and blue behemoth from the comic book series but a big giant cloud that devours planets and has granted a few people with special powers, ala Norrin Radd (The Silver Surfer).  What makes Galactus so menacing is his large presence as this cosmic being and unfortunately, in the film, he is reduced to a huge cloud that devours worlds.  But Director Tim Story did thoroughly explains in his commentary that this was not Galactus per se, that he wanted another director to showcase Galactus in a Silver Surfer film, so showing the behemoth was not his goal in the film.

And Dr. Doom, well, we wanted the dark brooding Dr. Doom but nevertheless Julian McMahon's reprise of the character was fine but his role was quite short.

Since the release of these two films, there have been a lot of discussion about ""Fantastic 4' going through a reboot, new cast and with the success of ""The Dark Knight"", ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" (which did receive a reboot), personally I found the current cast of Fantastic Four to be fine.  But I suppose the reason why this second film didn't resonate so clearly with the fans is the storyline (note: the second film made less than the first).

Even with the comic book series, as much as Fantastic Four was one my favorite comic books, it was clearly no X-Men or the Avengers.  It was a group of family and friends that were not taking on the typical villains that Spider-Man and Captain America were going against most of the time.  This group had to deal with intergalactic villains such as Thanos, Annihilus and were constantly fighting in new worlds.  It was a different style of comic book and the only darkness that was typically found are through relationships between Reed Richards and Sue Storm (or Reed Richards gone missing and She-Hulk having to be part of the group).

But the fact is that audiences for super hero films enjoy the darkness that heroes are put through. To be more serious that comic book-like and the fact is, many films are now going to be compared to the box office hit ""The Dark Knight"" which took superhero films to a new level in storytelling.

But for those who see a Blu-ray copy of ""Fantastic 4 - Rise of the Silver Surfer"", the film is much more enjoyable than the first.  But the picture and audio quality through its HD transfer on Blu-ray is simply amazing.  And as mentioned, there are so many special features included on this Blu-ray disc that simply, if you were a fan of the comic books or the film, you will definitely enjoy what has been included in this release.

Overall, I was entertained by the film but if you are expecting ""The Dark Knight"" type of storyline, you won't find that level of seriousness with this film.",1247702400,2,9872,4.792184724689165

1548900,3,B00005JNTU,"I love the Fantastic Four comic and having followed them for 30 years - it's been a long time coming for many fans to get the FF and the Silver Surfer in one film.  I watched the first film and thought it was a lot better than critics gave it credit for.  However - Rise of the Silver Surfer was supposed to up the ante and in some ways it does, but the characters fail to move beyond their one-dimensional veneer.  I left this film feeling like they were still the bubblegum hollywood manufactured versions of the comic characters, which was disappointing.  Yes, there is a little gee-whiz humour, but  I can't help feeling that the cast is simply too lightweight with the exception of Dr Doom (played by Julian Mcmahon) and Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) - who is meant to be who he portrays - a reckless hot head.

Jessica Alba looks pretty, but pretty like a flower in a vase.  Ioan Gruffudd has never quite cut it for me as Reed Richards in the gravitas department.  The net effect is a lack of real chemistry and I often wonder how casting this whole troupe differently could have made a difference.

The film itself presents an epic storyline that should have really either been just the Silver Surfer, or Galactus, or Dr Doom.  Instead we get a bit of everyone but not quite enough of each supporting villain / character and the result is a lightweight TV show.  Galactus is the most mindblowing FF end of the world scenario - and yet, we don't get that.  Not even close.  The effects are great, and the Silver Surfer looks a lot better than his still picture, but there are so many wasted opportunities here when one considers the myriad of storylines that the producers and writers could have adapted from the comic's amazing history.  Truly wasted.

So, instead of compelling, we get something lighter than Spider Man and nowhere near Iron Man, but still better than the dismal Daredevil.  None of this of course hurt the movie's box office success, but let's see if the future Silver Surfer movie can thrill us more.

Julian should get his own Dr Doom film.  He has the presence and the cool which the other Fantastic Four members desperately need.  Watchable, but what a waste.  LOTR Peter Jackson should take this on.",1241308800,2,2227,4.547738693467337

And if you think he's as sexy in ""Charmed"" as Cole, he's ten times sexier as Dr. Doom. Talk about making you hot and bothered. :D Anyone here who says that he doesn't fit the role or can't act or just says anything to bash my man, should grow a brain and maybe get their eye sight checked because Julian is the only one who can carry this movie and carry it well as the villian. So smug, sexy, malicious and sinister, he's incredible as Doom! No one else could have played the role but him. As for the rest of the story and the scenes that didn't include Victor Von Doom, it was still fun and interesting to watch the rest of them use their powers and bicker with one another. Plus, if you get the extended edition, the movie is ten times better because they add so much to it. Unfortunetly, it's not on blu-ray like the original. While it might get a bit tiring and boring to watch this movie over and over again, no one can honestly get tired of watching Julian McMahon act and play Doom.

What I hate is that they didn't put the extended version and all special features the Blu Ray! Blu Ray is the best picture and sound. Give us all the goodies! Why wouldn't they add everything from the original and extended? I'm glad they at least added the fun cast commentary to the Blu Ray.

RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER

Remember when the first film in this series came out ever one was hyped up about it and although it was a disappointment to most it still made a lot of money. Well part 2 didn't have as much expectations and I believe that helped this movie go over more, plus come on the Silver Surfer. While this is not the greatest super hero movie ever made I must say that it is better then the first Fantastic 4 movie, which wasn't bad for what it was. Sure after the first one I was a little worried that the same thing would happen with this movie, thankfully for the most part this is a much better film.

The movie is all about Reed and Sue trying to deal with their new found celebrity and juggle their responsibilities with the group, public and their wedding all at the same time. Of course while that is happening the U.S. government shows up to inform the group that a strange being is attacking the planet, turns out this guy is their to get the planet ready for an even nastier fellow. So naturally the 4 take this thing on and end up on the losing side to a being known as The Silver Surfer, and this dude is a step above everyone else. At the same time the infamous Dr. Doom is up and moving again and comes in contact with the Surfer and even finds out how to stop him. So an unlikely partnership is forged by Doom, the 4, and the Army to bring the Surfer down, in which case they are successful. But things will not be that easy as Doom has his own motives and steals the Surfer's board and gains its powers. So off we are to take out Doom and try to stop an on coming Galactis, hopefully the heroes think with the help of the surfer.

I have to say while this is not a classic in any sense it is a much better film then the first one I believe, the characters are a little more like the comic versions. Mr. Fantastic has got a lot of confidence in this one and is not afraid to stand up to people unlike the first film, good to see Ioan Gruffudd playing the part a little better this time. Jessica Alba as The invisible woman seems more like a grown mature lady although this one isn't as close to the comic as one would think, but still at least she isn't that love sick little thing from the first film. Ben Grimm aka the Thing is his usual self in this film, at least they kept one of the good things from the first in this one. The only difference is he is happy with his life in this one, and the story isn't about him as much this go round. Michael Chiklis did as great a job this time as he did the last. Chris Evans as the Human Torch is his cocky self from the first one but this is mainly his story this time much like the first was about the Thing. The Surfer was excellent in this film they hit him spot on, and Laurence Fishburne was great as the voice. But the thing I am most excited about is that they got Dr. Doom right this time, and Julian McMahon plays him perfectly just like I knew he could if given the right character. Doom is much like his comic self in this one, a power hungry villain who will play both sides to get what he wants. My only concern with this film is the treatment of Galactis, when did he become a huge cloud?

Director Tim Story does a much better job this time around, and while it is not a perfect movie it is better than the first. Writers Mark Frost, John Turman, and Don Payne wrote a very good and believable adaptation of the Fantastic Four in my opinion. Not only did they try to appeal to the fans of the comic more this go round, but they also stuck with what the studio wanted with a kinda kid friendly movie. Still it isn't perfect, not all is right about this film such as the Galactis thing and is it just me or did this feel short? I did how ever like that they had Stan Lee try to get into the wedding, people talk trash about that part but in the comic that really happened, Stan and Jack Kirby try to go to the wedding.

This is not the best super hero movie ever but hey it is still good enough for a rental, and is at least better then the first one [which was ok]. It makes me think that if this becomes a trilogy they may make a really good Fantastic Four film the next time, here's to hoping.",1231632000,2,4203,4.05294825511432

When this film first came out there was a lot of high hopes for the film, and why not it is one of the most beloved comics of all time. There has been a lot said about this movie some being positive some negative, I think for the most part that both sides are right. This movie is flawed especially if you are a fan of the comic series but if you a casual viewer I see no reason why you would not like this film. I have been a fan of Marvel Comics since I was a little kid, and while this series was not my favorite I still read it. That is why I have mixed feelings about this movie, on one hand I am upset with how it turned out while on the other I enjoyed it.

The story is all about five unlucky people who take a little trip into space to conduct an experiment, of course since this film is based on a comic you know that something goes wrong. After being hit with all kinds of nasty stuff [cosmic rays] the team wakes up a little later back on earth and everything seems fine, at first. But after a while Reed Richards starts to feel a little stretched, Suzanne Storm feels a little invisible, Johnny Storm begins to feel a little hot, Victor Von Doom feels electrified, and poor Ben Grimm feels a little solid. Of course all of you know what I am talking about with each character; four become fantastic while Doom becomes just that, doomed. It is these events that start to set in motion what should be one of the greatest show downs of all time, more on that later. Reluctantly Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch [not so reluctantly] and of course very reluctantly The Thing except who they have become and join up to become the Fantastic Four. That is really what the movie is all about, all of them coming to terms with what they have become. Torch and Doom are really the only ones that like what has happened to them, strangely for similar reasons.

A lot of the fans of the comic have spoken out about this movie saying a whole lot of different things, different reasons why they dislike this movie. One reason and justly so is the fact that the film is not really true to the comic all that much, such as the character story lines like Doom was never with Sue that I can remember. Also weren't Reed and Doom friends in college and became enemies once an experiment went wrong and messed up Victor. There are also some other points to be made about storylines and such but you get the idea of what I am trying to say. Something else that is discussed a lot is the casting of the film, from what I can tell most people disagree with most of it. Ioan Gruffudd is cast as Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic and a lot of people disagree with this casting decision. It is true that Reed was a genius that was full of confidence and never really self doubting like he is in this film, that is true I can't really argue that point. Also Jessica Alba as Sue Storm aka Invisible Woman has had a lot of critics about her being cast in that role, once again rightful criticism since Sue was never that prissy and stuck up and love sick. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm aka Human Torch has had mixed reactions, people say that Torch was never that cocky but I disagree. He may not have been that cocky originally but I do remember this Torch from his guest appearances in the Spiderman comics, maybe not that cocky but pretty close and has far as entertainment purposes I think they went the right way. Michael Chiklis is really the only one that has had the most praise as Ben Grimm aka The Thing, and rightfully so as he portrays his character perfectly and fulfils a childhood dream by being in this film as The Thing. And of course our villain is played by Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom aka Dr. Doom, he has been plagued with criticism as well but I liked him as Doom.

I really believe that all of the actors did great jobs for what they were given, I mean think about it they portrayed characters that were written for them and acted as directed. If there ever was any one to blame it would be director Tim Story and writers Mark Frost and Michael France. They seem to have wanted to make this film more about the characters and drama between them more important then a film about the action. I can understand that decision but they could have balanced both much better just look at the Spiderman films. Also people complain about how they changed the origins and story around, but like Stan Lee said the big screen is much different from the pages, and some times the film needs to be made different to reach a new audience. As a fan I can both understand this and except it but at the same time be upset by it. Still I don't like that the final battle between the Four and Doom is way to short and not as epic as it could have been. Still though Tim and the writers obviously had a certain vision they wanted to go with for the film and they followed through with it. And what you get is what you get take it or leave, am I overly excited by the finished product, no. But I do think that the film is worth a watch, maybe even a purchase.

All the actors did great jobs with what they had written for them, Chris Evans really did a good job adding to his character. His fights with Michael Chiklis  are great entertainment and remind me of the comics, and I think Doom looked cool and Julian McMahon did a great job regardless of whether his character was written for the screen right. Michael Chiklis steals the show in my eyes; his portrayal is great and really heartfelt, that is how I would react if I was turned into that and lost my wife. Ioan Gruffudd is in the same vein as Julian McMahon in that he does a great job with a character that was not written right; same can be said for Alba who does a good job with her character [she is also super hot, really a beautiful woman]. The only thing is that she at times like in the action scenes kinda looks out of place, but that suit fits so right on her so I'll forgive that [sorry but that is the guy in me coming out].

Tim, Mark, and Michael although they did not really stick to what the comic was did an ok job with this new version of the team. Sure I would prefer it a different way but the finished product is still kind of a fun movie, perfect for a lazy Saturday or something. Maybe it is because I am a fan of Marvel [Stan Lee cameos] and that they Ok'd it makes me forgive its short comings, or maybe it is just mindless fun that I think this film is ok. This film will never be my favorite movie or even favorite super hero movie but still it is not unwatchable. Whether you hate this film or not as a fan you should still support what you grew up loving, this is not a film just for the people who came to love the comics. This film at least what I think they were going for is a film that has enough of the old to please the old fans and enough new to reach a new audience. I think it worked kinda because the film made money, and as long as these films make money the more we will get to see them. Even if they are not done correctly I would still rather see these characters being created for new generations, which is really the only way the characters will live on.

The DVD comes with a nice cast commentary with Chiklis, Gruffudd, and Alba; also included are a lot of great behind the scenes extras including a great documentary. Also on a side note, I actually like the first movie from the 90's that was produced by Roger Corman.

1549000,4,B00005JNTU,"Nice comic book adaptation of the Fantastic Four comic which, as a comic book, was always more interesting for its villains than its heroes, and this movie franchise is the same. I didn't see the first film, but I understand that it was marred by a rushed resolution.  In this film, the threat - the Silver Surfer - is identified 30 seconds into the film, so this one is well-designed as an action film.

Quite a bit of soap opera centered around Susan Storm's concern that she won't have  normal life after she marries Reed Richards, boo hoo hoo, but otherwise it's pretty straight forward and not too weepy.  It's a kids movie, more so than any of the other Marvel adaptations, although they do manage to get in some speculation about the Thing's plumbing nonetheless (a perennial question for Marvel Comics fans).

As far as comic book adaptations go, Jessica Alba looks better in  Sin City of course, but who's complaining.  The Silver Surfer is very welcome in this movie, as one of the coolest characters in all of Marvel Comics, and they do interesting things with his surfboard.  One complaint: I don't want to give too much away about the ending, but the producers didn't really introduce Galactus - a character just as fascinating as the Silver Surfer himself - in a very satisfying way in my opinion.  But by the end of the movie you've had so much fun that you don't really care too much if it's well-resolved anyway (so few films are).

Green light for another Fantastic Four movie, as well as a Silver Surfer spin-off.",1230163200,2,1532,4.619926199261992

I realize as movie makers they can't do the comic adaption word for word but if anything was ever begging to go directly from comics to movies it was those three classic issues.

I enjoyed most of the Marvel based movies even though they stray far from the comic but, FF's strength is its' early issues and though you couldn't have corny sixties dialog like ""Now it's time for me, Mr. Fantastic, to handle things for a stretch!"" or ""Hey gang it's Johnny with the Ultimate Nullifier!"" where is the Watcher? Why is Galactus a cloud? Oh yes, he, the ultimate 400 story tall baddie in the Marvel Universe is like a big Sauronesque fume in this movie. To make it worse they have the shadow of his head fly past a planet having fanboys like me salivating.

I hope this spoils things for fans like me who were hoping to see at least a halfway decent adaption of the comic, maybe they won't buy this garbage. This way maybe they'll lose so much money they'll have to do it over like they did with the Hulk.",1226534400,5,1103,4.375609756097561
1549073,4,B00005JNTU,"""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is the second Fantastic Four movie, and first hit  the big screens in 2007.

Two years have passed since the Fantastic Four - Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Ben Grimm and  Johnny Storm - gained their powers. Following a trip into space and a blast of cosmic rays,  Reed became able to bend and stretch like rubber, Susan had the ability to become invisible  while Johnny could transform into a human of living fire. However, where Reed, Sue and Johnny could switch their powers on and off, Ben couldn't : he was permanently stuck as a  creature made of living rock. Despite the superhuman strength, it was something he wasn't - initially - terribly pleased about...although now, he's a little more comfortable with things.

Reed and Sue's wedding is now approaching and - with the team's fame - it's going to be a  big media event. However, it's not about to pass off smoothly; thanks to a mysterious  visitor from space, very strange things are happening to the Earth's climate - snow in Egypt, frozen seas in Japan, even power outages in western USA. There are even mysterious craters appearing at certain points around the Earth and- thanks to the film's opening sequence - you know the Earth's in an awful lot of danger.

It isn't long before the team get called in by the military. A certain General Hager stops by the Baxter Building looking for Reed - although he isn't too happy about sharing any classified information with a civilian scientist. (He particularly dislikes Reed - the pair have something of a history). Unfortunately, he arrives while the boys at enjoying Reed's stag-night...so Sue takes the General and his goons along. (Naturally, events only confirm the General's bad opinion, and land Reed in quite some bother with Sue). The General's looking for some help with explaining the meteorological anomalies and the strange craters. In an effort to impress Sue, Reed officially passes on the assignment - claiming that he wants to focus solely on his forthcoming wedding. Naturally, he works on the project  in secret and finishes things up just before the wedding.

Naturally, things go drastically wrong. The mysterious visitor from space - the Silver Surfer - arrives in New York just before the wedding and knocks out power all over the city.  Johnny goes after him, and is the first person to get a really good look at the Surfer...without realising the extent of the Surfer's powers. Johnny very much comes of second-best, and the encounter also leaves Johnny's powers on the blink - when he touches one of his colleagues, their powers (briefly) switch. (It's something that Ben has a bit of fun with, and gives us another chance to see a scantily-clad Jessica Alba). Even worse, the Surfer's arrival has Dr Doom come back to life...and it isn't long before he starts adding to the planet's woes.

""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a great deal better than the first Fantastic Four movie, and some of the effects are excellent. The fact that there's a half-decent storyline - unlike the first movie - helps a great deal, and Johnny Storm isn't quite the nuisance he was first time around. There are a few flaws - Reed Richards still has the worst superpower ever dreamt up and there was the occasional bout of cheesy dialogue. However, Stan Lee's cameo was the only irritating thing about the movie - as with the first movie, there was just no need for him to be there. A largely fun way to pass a free couple of hours.",1225411200,2,3485,4.7388429752066115

However, that is not enough, as the Silver Surfer's master still wants to destroy Earth for its own survival. The Silver Surfer is persuaded from being bad to being good, and is re-united with his surf-board so that his master's intentions fail.

1549077,1,B00005JNTU,"Sight gags, some decent CGI, and Andre Braugher as a cartoon military cut-out all equal a whole lot of nothing going on.

This is a sequel made for the sake of making a sequel. There's no heart to the monster, no real depth. Impressive as the Silver Surfer looked and as great as some of the score sounded, it never lived up to the trailer. The movie is largely wasted on sight gags involving the Fantastic Four trading powers after Johnny Storm's initial encounter with The Silver Surfer. Whether the effects of that are mitigated by the movie's close after he powers up with all four powers to smack down the 11th hour villainy of Dr. Doom (and for all that he's a complete asshat, I still don't get HOW we're supposed to believe that General Hager actually trusted Doom) whose clever scheme was always to get his hands on the Surfer's board.

There's some standard comic book commentary on the viability of living a ""normal"" life while also being a super hero, a fake out that kills off Sue for all of five seconds, and two wedding sequences, but none of it really rises above affectation. Although I did read a little Fantastic Four in my time, they were never my favorite comic book and the movies (despite the hotness of Jessica Alba and Chris Evans) have yet to do anything to change that. Kerry Washington is WASTED as Ben Grimm's girlfriend, Alicia Masters, acting as a sort of mediator between Grimm and the Torch, and Sue and Reed but without really adding anything to the plot.

Despite Sue's brief one on one with the Surfer where we learn about his mission, his job as herald and his One True Love; the movie is permeated with the sense that there's more backstory. I continually felt that there was something more to know, something about the Surfer and Galactus that just wasn't being addressed. I've never been a Silver Surfer fan, maybe having read one comic a very long time ago, so that's a really bad sign when a non-fan who knows nothing about the franchise gets the feeling that there's something vital missing.

Translating a comic into a movie is really difficult, like with any adaptation there has to be mediation between old and new fans. The Hollywood machine ever in pursuit of a guaranteed dollar has become bloated with remakes and adaptations of previously produced material. Unfortunately, that material is generally suffering for it. Fantastic Four should have been a better movie, but sadly, isn't.",1222214400,2,2434,4.693208430913349

In short, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a good time.  Who knows, maybe we'll still get a third installment, as the movie did pretty well in the international market.

The single-disc version of the movie looks and sounds great and is economically priced, but it doesn't have the entertaining, illuminating extras features of the two-disc special edition.

1549080,4,B00005JNTU,"I'm actually a humongous fan of Marvel Comics Fantastic Four.  From owning a large collection of the comic books to toy hunting for the hard-to-get Invisible Woman action figures.

  But I kept myself away from any coverage, hype regarding the film, so I can enjoy it to the nth degree.

  I have to admit that I felt a bit cautious because although the Fantastic Four have been a staple of Marvel Comics history, it's not the in your face action such as X-Men and even Spider-Man.
  It's one of those series that has to grow on you and you learn to enjoy the characters.

  So,  I imagined that like the first X-Men movie where they had to go through an introduction, the same would have to be done with the first Fantastic Four movie.

  Sure, there will be a lot of action but at the same time, you need to know how the characters are.

  Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) is not your typical lead man.  He's highly intelligent, detached from society somewhat and can be a cold fish.

  Johnny Storm (Human Torch) is the hothead.  Playboy and always seems to get himself into something dangerous.

  Ben Grimm, the man who deals with being the rocky behemoth known as the Thing.
  And Sue Storm, the woman who loves Reed but somehow tries to find ways to get close to him (despite him being a cold and dull fish at times).

  So, needless to say...our heroes have their problems and for some who are looking for the charismatic action hero, they are superheroes but they aren't perfect.

  I happened to enjoy the film.  The pacing was a bit off at times but nevertheless, I enjoyed it and optomistic that the second movie can now be fast-paced and hard hitting.

  The DVD for Fantastic Four was very enjoyable with really cool.  The DVD is offered in two versions (widescreen and fullscreen) and audio quality is offered in 5.1 DTS (which sounds really awesome on my home theater).

  The special features for this DVD doesn't disappoint either as it feature full length audio commentary by the stars of the film, a video diary featuring the stars on their media tour for the film - which was very exciting by the way.  Deleted scenes, making of featurette, casting session, making a scene, music videos, theatrical teaser and trailer and also an inside look for the third X-Men film (which unusually got the top listing for the special features).

  Not everyone is going to enjoy the Fantastic Four film.  Even the comic book is not for everyone but those who stick with it learn to enjoy the characters for what they are.

  If I had any problem, many of us who are faithful to FF, knows that Dr. Doom doesn't go down that easily.  Otherwise Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon do a great job portraying the characters.

  Again, this is just the introductory film.  Hopefully with the second film, things get even better.  As for the DVD, it's fantastic.",1220400000,,2900,4.587426326129666

1549182,2,B00005JNTU,"Of all the superhero movie adaptations released in the last several years, there is one in particular that stands out to me simply because it is so unremarkable. That film is 2005's adaptation of ""The Fantastic 4."" The characters are one dimensional, and the plot is paper thin. I can sum it up as this: 5 scientists go into space and come back with super powers. Four of them decide to become superheroes, and one decides to become a super villain. And then, they fight. That's it. It doesn't even attempt to understand why four people, upon receiving these powers decide they should be super heroes. They do it because that's what people with super powers do, and of course they have a closet full of pre-made superhero costumes that were conveniently written into the plot as being ""next generation astronaut suits."" Yeah, ruddy brilliant guys.

There is a sub plot in there about Ben Grim being unhappy with his monstrous new appearance as ""The Thing,"" but the way the writers chose to resolve it ultimately feels ridiculous. Also, Dr. Doom, who is one of the most prolific recurring villains in the entire Marvel universe, is completely neutered in this movie. Comparing this Dr. Doom to his comic book counterpart is like comparing Chad Vader to his big brother Darth. The movie was obviously made in a boardroom of Fox executives trying to figure out how to get as many teenage boys into the theater as possible, because it is also chock full of frivilous extreme sports footage, special effects shots, and meticulously airbrushed women.

The only good thing I can say about this movie was that it looked good on Blu-Ray, at a time when I barely had anything to watch in HD. If you're looking for a movie to demo your new home theater with though, there are dozens of movies that look just as good if not better in HD, that aren't textbook examples of what happens when movies get made in by business men.",1219968000,2,1912,4.653846153846154

1549184,3,B00005JNTU,"Let me say just one thing...I&nbsp;&nbsp;the FF! I've loved it since the first issue with the Mole Man. But this film, and the woebegone first one are so badly cast and underwhelming, it's awful! Whose bright idea was it to cast Jessica Alba, who looks like she's fourteen, as Sue Storm? Or Ioan Gruiffudd as Reed Richards? NEITHER of these people work in their roles! Reed should be solidly middle aged, about 45-50, with premature grey hair at the temples and a movie star handsome face and an intelligent, fatherly air. Gruiffudd is neither upper-middle aged, professorly or fatherly and is too thin and flutey for the usually huskily drawn Richards. The sad thing is, anybody who COULD have played him is either too old or dead: Keith Andes, William Sylvester, John Forsythe, Dean Jones, Richard Denning, (who Reed was probably based on to begin with,) or Russell Johnson are either retired, WAY too old, (like 70 or 80,) or, sadly, in the grave. They STILL could have done better than Gruiffudd, though! Actually, I could see him and Julian McMahon switching roles. And Dr. Doom isn't supposed to have an American accent anyway! (Not to mention the fact that he isn't supposed to be American to BEGIN with!)

And Alba....Come ON!! She hardly looks PUBESCENT, much less old enough to marry a scientist near retirement age! They should have saved her for Frankie Raye, one of Johnny's many girlfriends, and someone who would eventually supplant the Silver Surfer as a herald of Galactus. I say Joan Allen would have been PERFECT for the role, using someone like Bill Pullman as Reed. And Johnny should be BLOND, not brunette with a crew cut!! J. Storm never had a crew cut in his LIFE in the book!! Heck, I've always had my reservations about the Human Torch as a comic book character to begin with!

However, as usual, they NEVER get Ben Grimm wrong! What's to get wrong, anyway?? All you've got to do is get a burly, middle aged actor who can talk like a New York cab driver and you're home free!

Now, as to the Silver Surfer, though pretentious as ****, he's always been one of my favorite superhero comic supporting players. I like the fact that one of my favorite black actors, Laurence Fishburne, is doing the voice of ol' Norrin! The character, alas, suffers from the USUAL Marvel superhero film ""obvious CGI effect"" problem. What IS it with cheezy Marvel?? Can't they do ANYTHING first class?! This outfit has [always] been tacky as the blazes in their endeavors, since day one. I guess even hitting the big time with the X-Men movies and the first Hulk film can't alleviate their affection for that ""sleaze aspect"". (And when are they going to stop making those ""Punisher"" movies??)

I&nbsp;&nbsp;to get this film due to my love for the Surfer, but I can tell you right now, if I had anything to do with its production, either casting, directing or writing, things would be done differently! Ta-ta, Alba and Gruiffudd, bleach Johnny's hair, make Galactus solid instead of gaseous, and rework the origin where they actually had Doom aboard their near-space probe, acquiring powers, something that never happened in the source material! I HATE it when my favorite superheroes have their origin stories altered significantly in movies or TV...it happened in BOTH first ""Batman"" movies, (Joe Chill killed Bruce's parents, NOT Jack Napier/The Joker, and Ra's Al Ghul came LONG after Bruce Wayne became Batman! He did NOT train him!) The Flash TV show, (Barry Allen was blond, again, not dark-haired like John Wesley Shipp; did NOT live with his parents and had no brother. Iris West was in practically every issue of his magazine, but was only in the pilot episode of the show, (as a punk rocker, yet!) replaced by Tina McGee, a new character...there was no Julio in the book..AND HE NEVER VIBRATED THROUGH WALLS on the show!! [My favorite trick of his!]) The X-Men were originally: Cyclops, The Beast, The Angel, Marvel Girl/Jean Grey, Professor X and Iceman, THEN there was the reboot with Cyclops, Jean Grey/Phoenix, Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Shadowcat and Wolverine. Rogue was a Johnny-come-lately, taken in from an organization that actually was formed to FIGHT the X-Men! She was also much more mature than Anna Pacquin in age and bearing. Their legend from about 1985 on has been too confusing to go into here, but the above is the basic truth. The second animated show and the movies screwed that ALL up, with Iceman being one of the junior students at Xavier's school, Angel a complete stranger, Nightcrawler a latecomer and Kitty and Piotr (Shadowcat and Colossus) VERY peripheral players! (Kitty was a major player in a LOT of the Xmen ""second generation"" stories.) I could go on....Superman and the Kryptonian criminals lifting things with their eyes in the original Salkind ""Superman"" movies, Mary Jane living right next door to Peter Parker in ""Spiderman"", Sandman being a sympathetic character with a dying daughter in Spidey 3, Peter acquiring the black, alien suit while still being on Earth, etc., etc....Suffice it to say that ""Daredevil: The Director's Cut"" is about the ONLY decent, faithful transfer of a superhero to the screen I've ever seen!

1549185,3,B00005JNTU,"""Fantastic Four"" hit the big screens in 2005, and is based on the Marvel comic book.

Reed Richards is, quite possibly, the most gifted scientist to ever have graduated from MIT. Currently researching the human genome, he believes the evolutionary process on Earth may have been triggered a cosmic storm. Luckily, precisely the type of cloud Richards has factored into his work will soon pass close to Earth's orbit. However, to continue his work, he needs help - specifically financial aid and a trip into space. Together with his sidekick, astronaut Ben Grimm, Richards pays a visit to Dr. Victor von Doom - not only an ex-classmate, but also a well-heeled native of Latveria. Where Richards is struggling financially, things are going a little better for von Doom - he is now the head of his own business and has his own very well-shielded space station.

Von Doom agrees to fund the experiment and grants the pair access to the space station - however, the deal is not without its conditions. Victor will take the lion's share of any future profits and his Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm will also be brought on-board. (Ms. Storm also happens to be Reed's ex-girlfriend, though exactly what she ever saw in him is never made clear). Ben had hoped to pilot the shuttle to the space station. Unfortunately, Sue's brother, Johnny, is the company's resident pilot and will be commanding the flight. (Johnny is something of a loose cannon who was thrown out of NASA).

The five travel to the space station together - only to be caught out by the cosmic storm, which arrives ahead of schedule. Ben takes the biggest hit the storm can offer, having been on a spacewalk at the time. Reed, Susan and Johnny were inside, though they had been trying to rescue Ben and weren't protected by the station's strongest shielding. Victor, like a true villain, made sure that he was in the safest part of the station. All five survive - though Reed seems to have been right about the storm's effect on the evolutionary process. Everyone on-board develops new abilities - Reed becomes able to bend and stretch like rubber, Susan can become invisible while Johnny can become a human of living fire, rather than flesh and blood. However, all three can switch their powers on and off and there's no change to their outward appearance. Ben, on the other hand, can't : he has evolved into a creature made of rock. Despite the superhuman strength, it's not something he's terribly pleased about. (Neither is his fiance - who doesn't take long in returning the ring). However, there are bigger problems ahead - specifically Doom and his newly acquired powers.

I found the movie pretty ordinary overall - there wasn't much of a storyline beyond 'this is how we got our powers'. (The point of the film, I'm guessing, was solely to set things up for the planned sequels). I can't say I was too fond of either Reed (limp, dreary and let's face it : he has the world's worst super-power) or Johnny (irritating brat). If it had been the Fantastic Two, I'd have been cheering for Doctor Doom - Julian McMahon does a pretty good job with that role. However, Ben Grimm proves to be a likeable character and - since there's a shot of Jessica Alba in her underwear - I'll give the film my unreserved recommendation.",1218672000,,3293,4.711805555555555
1549186,4,B00005JNTU,"Saw this movie in the big screen but loved and enjoyed it even more in blu ray. Great blu ray transfer, both video & audio. Loved the chase scene between torch and the silver surfer, and of course, Ms. Alba. Worth paying extra for BD!",1218412800,2,234,4.222222222222222
1549187,3,B00005JNTU,"As franchises go, Fantastic Four is relatively unexplored territory. There are probably good reasons for this: one of the characters is a cigar-chomping piece of rock, three members of the team are related to each other, and one of character's claim to fame is his amazing intellect combined with...wait for it...the power of STRETCHING.  Which was pretty funny in the 70s when it was portrayed in cartoons (I can still hear the ""stretching"" sound like a vacuum played backwards) and is a little creepy today.

Given that comics are the new hot property for movies, it was inevitable that the good 'ole FF have their own film.  And thus we have Ioan Gruffud (a less charismatic Jeff Goldblum) as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, the delectable Jessica Alba as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman, gruff Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing, and Chris Evans as the wisecracking pretty boy Johnny Storm/The Human Torch. Our heroic crew assembles in privately funded mission into space to explore...cosmic space gas. Only something goes terribly awry and the mutagenic mist transforms the four astronauts into super powered freaks.

The inherent silliness of the plot and characters has been spoofed so many times that it's difficult for the actual Fantastic Four to keep up.  We've all seen the family squabbles of the Incredibles. But perhaps the most caustic send-up is The Venture Bros., who deftly skewers the FF by casting Reed as an outdated 50s stereotype, Sue as a liberated housewife, and The Thing as a mentally deficient monster.

Perhaps FF can be forgiven for its lack of focus as it tries to walk the tightrope between being superhero silly and deadly serious.  Reed's romance with Sue is in its early stages here, complicated by a rival, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon)...

You!  You in the back with the funny haircut!  Stop laughing!  That's the man's name, all right?  It has nothing to do with his tendency for evil!  Or fancy alliteration.  Or that he happens to be a native of some country you've never heard of...that happens to send him a mask...that he just happens to wear...

Fine.  Fine, yes, this is all a little ridiculous.  But there's angst!  Poor Grimm suffers as he struggles with his identity and his hot wife dumps him (while wearing a negligee in the middle of the street, of course). Will Reed propose to Sue, or will she stick with Doom? Will Johnny ever stop being such a card?  Will Sue ever discover how to turn invisible without taking off her clothes? (!)

And so FF stumbles over itself in an attempt to be both true to the comic book's origins and cram in a plot that's really five stories into one film. Ben Grimm's angst as the unpleasant-looking Thing is diminished by a device that ""cures"" him. A device that didn't work without Doom's special powers, but mysteriously works in reverse without explanation. Alba is too sexy for the role; it's hard to believe the wooden Richards could romance her or that she'd find the stilted Von Doom any more attractive. And Richards' serious scientific efforts are undermined that he's basically a big inflatable balloon.  In fact, much of the fight scenes in this movie involve members of the FF battling each other.

The special effects do a good job of displaying the heroes' powers, but The Thing simply looks like a guy in rubber foam.  Chiklis is big, but he's not a huge man, and the film sometimes remember he's heavy and cumbersome (complete with thudding footfalls and exploding chairs) and then forgets when it's inconvenient (because a wooden bench can surely handle his massive weight, right?).

I think a lot of fans are just happy this film isn't the first attempt (that never saw the light of day but lives on in bootlegs).

1549188,2,B00005JNTU,"There is clearly a reason it took me so long to watch this.  I wanted to see it in the theater, but something did not allow me to go.  I wanted to get the DVD, but I could not do it.  I got the BD because I got it at a decent rice.  After watching it, I walked away with a bad feeling...

My rule on movies is simple.  If it is 90 minutes, it is bound to suck.  It means that no one took the time to write a deep and detailed story, let alone do anything else.  9 times out of 10 this holds to be true.  If a film is an hour and 45 minutes, it is usually decent with a little more time for a complete story and thought out scenes.  Again, this holds true 9 times out of ten.  If a film is 1 hour and 50 minutes or better, it is usually a masterpiece as you can tell that time was given to tell a story and everything else involved.  It shows that it has substance.  I don't have to tell you that the beloved films of all time are at least 2 hours long and the worst are 1 and a half hours or less!

This one is on the level of Elektra and Cat Woman - maybe a little better.  The look was ok, but Sue, Doom and Reed were wrongly cast and I still cannot understand how Alba is playing a white character!  Johnny and Ben were cast well enough.  The story should have been deeper, but maybe before filming began they knew that it was going to be short.  I believe that some directors who never read comicbooks don't take the approach to these films seriously.

Now, the special effects were cheesy and unbelievable in most cases.  Alba looked like a child and not white as Sue is in the comics.  Reed looked like a C list actor and I believe he is the same guy who played in the prototype FF4 movie.  The actor who played Doom was horrible and had no type of feeling.

The writing and/or budget caused a problem with the story.  They get powers, discover them and then they already have them mastered?  Doom starts to change and then for NO REASON at all, he dons a clasic Dr. Doom mask and uniform without any reason given for the mask to exist and for him to have put it on other than the fact that the character wheres it!  He just gets the uniform out of no where and puts it on for what reason?  His face did not even come close to the hideous looks of the comic for him to even think about covering it up.

The writing is EVERYTHING is a movie.  When that is bad, NOTHING can save a movie - NOTHING.  This is only good if you are a Marvel fan.  Now I am off to watch part two.  If that is more fo the same, then maybe The Punisher and The Hulk are not the only other films who need a complete overhaul...",1216425600,,2606,3.91412213740458

While the movie itself is much too focused on the comedic aspects and sight gags in either format, with the extended cut you at least feel like you are getting more for your money.

The major addition to the film is the Ben Grimm and Alicia Masters romance subplot that is just glossed over in the original cut.  Included is a wonderful scene in Alicia's studio where you actually see the romance begin and a real relationship form.  As well as a scene at an Art Show where Ben is embarassed for Alicia to be seen with him and leaves.

The other footage is mostly of Dr. Doom dealing with his transformation, spying on the F4 and meeting with every member other than Reed trying to convince them that Reed doesn't care about them.

Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) and Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) are trying to have a wedding. But fame and Weird Stuff Going On (caused by the arrival of the Silver Surfer) keep interrupting their plans.

The military demands that Reed solve the problem, and Sue demands that he give their wedding all his attention, so he keeps his work on the problem secret from her. Which of course causes more problems than just admitting it.

I have to admit I'm not even remotely familiar with the FF comics, so I'm just along for the ride.

We've got the 4 of them, dealing variously with their fame, which I liked very much.

We've got Reed keeping secrets from Sue and the two of them trying to get married but getting interrupted, which I also liked very much.

We've got a wonderful sequence when the Silver Surfer causes them all to switch powers, that's both funny (Sue gets her brother's fire) and poignant (Ben's temporarily himself again, and not The Thing), which I liked very much.

We've got the return of Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon), who's conned the military, which I liked very much.

And we've got the 4 superheroes fighting--not only the bad guys, but fighting ignorance by being smart and trying to figure out who the Silver Surfer is and why he's doing what he's doing. And I liked that very much as well.

Fun special effects, too.

Of course, any marital bliss to be had is interrupted by the arrival of the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones does the motion work, Laurence Fishburne does the voice), who is only a herald of something much larger, and deadlier, looming towards the planet.  Throw into the mix that the Surfer has essentially turned the FF's powers against them after an encounter with Johnny ""The Human Torch"" Storm (Chris Evans), and a returning Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon) who seeks to use the Surfer's power for his own purposes; and you get a pretty well-paced hour and a half superhero flick that is much more entertaining than the last installment.  Michael Chiklis also returns as Ben ""The Thing"" Grimm, and the film features some great effects work to boot, but there are so many missed opportunities to make something really great here that it is disappointing.  Those hoping for a showdown with Galactus will be disappointed as well, as what we get here from returning director Tim Story is basically all smoke and mirrors (no pun intended).  Not to mention that Jessica Alba resembles a plastic Barbie doll here, and just looks plain unnatural.  Flaws aside though, a majority of the film is pretty entertaining, and seeing the Silver Surfer face off against the FF is a comic geek's dream come true.

The end is simply a colossal disappointment. I can only guess they ran out of special effects funding before the movie was over and had to end quickly and without a grand battle.

Instead of giving the movie goer some background into Galactus or even taking the time to make a decent visual representation of him (he's a giant cloud), the producers felt it was much more important to show slapstick comedy and bad one-liners from our heroes.  Yeah, like I would much rather see Johnny Storm's juvenile attempts at flirting (eyes rolling) or some crummy wedding, than see Galactus and the Surfer interact.  Overall, the movie was pretty boring.  There are way too many distractions from the main plot.  The Surfer is too easily defeated.  Dr. Doom's character is wasted, once again.  The film makers assume you want to see Julian Sands, not Doom in his armor.  The ending was just a joke.  The Fantastic Four get the Surfer on their side and he determines that Earth should be spared.  So, he fights Galactus and easily defeats him (and survives).

1549365,4,B00005JNTU,"If you are like me, somebody who read the Fantastic Four (FF) comics in your youth, then you'd come to a film with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. I found the FF the most human and engaging of the Stan Lee characters, precisely because of the unstable personal dynamics of the personalities. It really was an American family ideal, they even had children, relatives, nannies and Aunt Petunias. They grew up and had history. It was, to be honest, a novelist's achievement that Stan Lee accomplished via comic strip while simultaneously shaking up that entire world.

So, would a film capture the nuances, the personality and of course, the extraordinary powers with which Lee invested these pivotal characters? In a word, yes. In two words, yes nearly. Its a damned good attempt to lift the comic into celluloid, and works as a fabulous parable for many of the early FF stories, as it weaves elements of several together of necessity. (Spiderman does the same with that series.)

The film has levity, pathos and drama in equal measure. The casting is spot on, a crucial factor with this diverse quartet; if anything, the Torch surpasses Lee's characterisation. Its also fun, just like the comic. If you prefer your films serious and hard boiled or cutting edge with philosophical similies, this ain't it.

There is a very clever adaptation of the Reed Richard/ Victor Von Doom relationship that works well even though it is the most significant deviation from the origin. The 'love triangle' (if that does not overstate it) with Sue may be Hollywood but it works and its under control. The Thing (Ben) retains his classic 'tragic monster' status and the welded-on character of his fiancee, Debbie, is more of a symbol of his loss on being transformed and her role is sensibly truncated. Ben's fiery yet clownish relationship with Johnny (the Torch) is also very well captured. He has some great lines...""Susie, look at me, you've no idea what I'd give to be invisible..."" I suppose the new ground the film cuts is with the far more intimate portrayal of Reed and Sue's relationship, which was never so well mined in the comics. And Sue's character is perhaps the one moved on most by the movie scriptwriters, again, fittingly for modern sensibilities.

Doom only latterly becomes inhuman enough to meet Lee's portrait, but he gets there, and with more intellectual coherence than Lee provided for. There are occlusions in the plot or the editing or the direction. Doom's Latvian origins arn't really explained or credible, for example. But these do not detract. They may be spotted by we purists.

The film is a really good realisation of the comic and does not trespass heavily on my affections. The personalities and dynamics work. So does the plot, albeit not an extensive one, and the effects are only now really capable of recognising the weird powers and look of the characters. Stretching your limbs and being made from an orange rock epidermis could have looked naff. It doesn't. You can accept the effects and the adventure is well paced.

In short, its fun film. They pulled it off. But fun is where it stops. For great art, go see something else!",1206144000,,3165,4.8410351201478745

Reed Richards, a brilliant scientist but a terrible businessman (and not too good at relationships either), and his lifelong friend and boyhood bodyguard Ben Grimm are in search of funding with which to prove Reed's hypothesis that a long-ago cosmic storm was responsible for the development of humanity.  To do this, they need to get into space, and NASA has refused them.  But billionaire Victor Von Doom, who has his own space station, doesn't--on condition that they sign over to him 75% of all profits and patents resulting from the experiment, let him go along (and take his science-projects director, Sue Storm, who is Reed's former girlfriend), and pick the pilot (Sue's brother Johnny, who washed out of NASA for his hotdogging and prankstering).  (Interestingly, we see on board the station that the Marvel Universe is definitely scientifically ahead of our own: the facility seems to have artificial gravity.)  While Ben is on a spacewalk, the cosmic storm Reed knew was coming speeds up, and everyone gets a whopping dose of radiation before Doom can close the shields.  At first, back on Earth, it seems they've come through unharmed.  Then Johnny, helicopter-skiing with a nurse he's met, literally starts to burst into flames, and Ben undergoes a transformation into a creature only superficially human.  Soon afterward, Reed realizes that he can extend any portion of his body, and Sue that she can turn invisible when under emotional stress.  (Last to transform is Doom, who slowly turns into a being made of some kind of organic metal.)  Reed wants to try to reverse the process, and Ben, who's dismayed by his new form, is happy to let him.  Even Sue is ambivalent about her new power.  Only Johnny seems to understand that there's more to being the self-named Human Torch than being an idol of millions; ""What if this happened for a reason?"" he insists.  Meanwhile Doom, whose company has tanked from the unfavorable publicity, has resolved to destroy Reed...

With typical Marvel angst, wonderful special effects, and an attractive cast, this is definitely one of the best of the recent crop of Marvel-based films.  One of the most visually stunning sequences is a wild multi-car accident on a New York bridge (begun when Ben tries to save a would-be suicide), climaxing with an ovation for the quartet from drivers, cops, and firefighters alike: unlike Spider-Man, the Fantastic-Four-to-be are obviously accepted from the start by officialdom.  (There's also an almost equally splendid battle with Doom in the midst of the New York street.)  Each of the Four is a clearly marked individual of whom the script makes the most that time will allow, and Doom is a wonderfully smooth and sinister presence even before his ultimate villainy comes into play.

1549433,3,B00005JNTU,"I remember when the ""Fantastic Four"" comic books first appeared in the early `60s and how I enjoyed the breath of fresh air they brought to the genre. Basing a live-action film on a comic book is something else, though, and the attempt is often winceingly unsuccessful. (The ""X-Men"" movie was pretty bad, in my view.) This one isn't too bad, mostly because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Ioan Gruffiudd is pretty good as the nerdy Reed Richards and Jessica Alba is okay as Sue Storm. The show is stolen by the other two members of the team, though -- Chris Evans as the smart-mouthed, narcissistic Johnny Storm, and Michael Chiklis as the anguished Ben Grimm, ""The Thing."" On many levels, of course, it's just another cliched superhero movie, but the writers didn't forgo plot and character development in favor of mindless ""action.""",1203379200,,840,4.840277777777778
1549434,2,B00005JNTU,"Fans of the Fantastic Four fall into two catagories. The first being those who grew up with the comics and the second, the younger generation of movie goers that Hollywood is desperate to grab.
For some reason, Stan Lee of Marvel comics fame, seems to want to re-engineer all the old classic comic stories to gain a young audience, while at the same time just throwing tid-bits to the older generation.
So, you have a Reed Richards that becomes the stereotypical ""nerdy scientist"", an endlessy and tiring cocky Human Torch and a Victor VonDoom who is so miscast that none of the fans like him.

That being said, I am grateful they got the Silver Surfer somewhat on par as to what he was in the original comic.

If you know nothing about this movie and don't mind a comic book story made somewhat silly, then you might enjoy it.

If your an older fan of the comic...you will be shaking your head in disappointment",1203206400,2,912,4.515151515151516

This being is the legendary Silver Surfer and he is preparing Planet Earth to be devoured by the mysterious astrological entity known as Galactus a being that must eat planets to survive.

The Review: Like a lot of people I felt the first movie was very good and highly under-appreciated so I was delighted when I first heard of a sequel. The entire cast are back in this movie and we even get to see THE Dr. Doom return to get revenge against the 4. Special effects wise this film is top notch and to be filmed in the year and a half is spectacular for a film on this scale. Jessica Alba brings her usual sexiness to the mix, and well so does Chris Evans. Michael Chiklis does his thing as ""The Thing"" and Ioan Gruffud returns to reprise his role as Mr. Fantastic. The story is very basic in this one as it was in the first, the team simply have to battle the silver surfer in order to prevent global disaster while trying to deal with the relationship problems of Sue Storm & Reed Richards. It's a very fun and exciting film while being lighthearted at the same time.

1549520,4,B00005JNTU,"With the great commercial success that 20th Century Fox's superhero adaptation ""Fantastic Four"" enjoyed with audiences it was only a matter of time before a sequel would make its way onto the big screen, though much to the dismay of the critics. Essentially all critics, and even some audiences, disliked the more tongue-in-cheek approach to superhero movies that director Tim Story brought with his adaptation of Marvel Comics' first superhero family, but most audiences loved the more light-hearted approach to heroics that is often times missing in these types of films, such as; ""Batman Begins"", ""Daredevil"", and ""X-Men"". Jump forward a couple of years, gather together the cast of the original film, along with director Tim Story, and with the obligatory origin tale out of the way, 20th Century Fox was ready to send Marvel's first family back into the fray in ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"".

""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" begins with the members of the Fantastic Four and the world preparing for the impending nuptials of Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and the Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba). However, this happy time is proving to be anything but that for the members of the FF as the media is constantly meddling into their lives, prompting Sue to wonder if it's at all possible for her and Reed to raise a family and be superheroes at the same time. As the stress builds, Reed and Sue decide to break-up the Fantastic Four after the wedding, a decision that greatly disturbs the Human Torch (Chris Evans) and the ever-lovin', blue eyed Thing (Michael Chiklis), who feel the decision should have been made as a group. Shortly before their wedding date, a man named General Hager (Andre Braugher) alerts the team to an impending threat that could mean the end of the world, as a giant world-eating monstrosity known as Galactus is approaching Earth, and leading the way is its herald the powerful Silver Surfer (voiced by Laurence Fishburne). Now, the Fantastic Four must put aside their differences with not only each other but also with their former nemesis, Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon) who has apparently returned from the dead with knowledge that may possibly save the world or condemn it under his oppressive rule.

As a fan of the first film, ""Fantastic Four"", I was hoping that the sequel would at least equal its predecessor and maybe even surpass it at times, but I have to say that I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit more than the original. Almost everything about ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" was better than the first film, not that the first film was bad. I mean the first film is like most first superhero movies, it was the origin tale which is needed for the audience members that aren't up on the comics to know just what exactly these characters are all about. For an origin movie the original was well done, and captured the feel of the comic rather well, there were a few gripes (the main one being the film wasn't as serious as it should have been, a little less humor would have been nice), but nothing that really took away from the overall enjoyment of the movie. The direction felt much more focused, it seemed like Tim Story was more confident with special effects this time around, which was evident in the more visually exciting action sequences, the camerawork was much more fast-paced and exciting, utilizing more movement with the camera to make the audience have a sense that something was always happening on screen.

Assisting the director in elevating the quality of this sequel was the improved storyline that focused on a much bigger threat than what was featured in the first movie. The drama the team dealt with seemed a little more refined, and it was especially appreciated that we didn't have to deal with anymore sulking moments on the part of the Thing regarding his appearance. Most of the characters had evolved since we last left them in the previous movie, a must for any sequel to be successful, and this is especially true for superhero films, and this film took this rule to heart and the movie was better served because of that. I was surprised that Johnny seemed the least developed from the first film, his character was essentially the same as he was when we last left him, which felt a little strange that he wouldn't have matured at all, but by the end of this movie his character's story arc had matured him into more of a man rather than a hot-headed kid who only looks out for himself 9 times out of 10. I was pleased that the writers took this film into a little bit more of a serious direction than the previous one by balancing the drama and the comedy better than the original had done.

The actors all gave terrific performances, the cast seemed like they were truly enjoying themselves even more so than they did in the first movie. Each actor looked just as confident, maybe even a little more so, with their characters, a benefit of having played the same characters previously so that the actors knew the characters much better and therefore felt more comfortable in their skin. The most improved performance was without a doubt Jessica Alba's, not that she was bad in the first movie, but she seemed much more at ease with her role, delivering a more confident and in control Sue Storm than she had seemed before. The newest members of the cast, primarily Andre Braugher as General Hager and Laurence Fishburne as the voice of the Silver Surfer and actor Doug Jones (previously portrayed Abe Sapien in ""Hellboy"") supplied the physical movements for the character, were welcome additions to the franchise and gave the movie some fresh conflicts to deal with. Braugher did a very good job portraying Hager as a man with an axe to grind with Reed, and it would have been nice to see or at least hear a little bit more of their history to better understand what had occurred between these two characters in the past that causes such obvious animosity. The character of the Silver Surfer was by far the best addition to the franchise, and served as the catalyst for the Fantastic Four's newest threat that they face. The physical movements of Doug Jones that gave the Silver Surfer an air of superiority, combined with the deep, resonating voice of Laurence Fishburne molded the Surfer into a commanding presence, which comic book fans and moviegoers would like to see more of as this film merely piqued the audience's interest.

Lastly, the special effects work on this film, as I briefly mentioned above, was far superior to what had been done in the first movie, so a big thumbs up must go to the talented team at Weta that supplied the effects. The effects for the main members of the Fantastic Four seemed more refined, but the biggest achievements by Weta on this film, were the work done on bringing the Silver Surfer to life and also creating the cloud/machine used by Galactus (the Silver Surfer's master) to drain various worlds of their energies. Both aspects of the film looked excellent, and I'm sure bringing a highly reflective being such as the Silver Surfer to life on the big screen was no easy task, because there's only so much reflecting that you'd want his body to do before there'd be no way of knowing where he ends and the environment around him begins. Kudos must go to Weta on finding the perfect balance of reflectivity for the Surfer, and for giving comic book fans a living, breathing, realistic looking Silver Surfer for us to enjoy.

To sum up, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a highly entertaining sequel that builds upon the already solid story put forth by the first film, and serves to point this franchise in the direction it needs to be heading. Namely bigger and badder foes, more serious conflicts, and more drama in their lives, but without losing some of the lighter moments that make this franchise so entertaining for families who feel that there's not much out there for them to enjoy.

1549629,2,B00005JNTU,"""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a waste of perfectly good plastic.  It is a cinematic version of the classic Marvel meeting of the Silver Surfer and the Fantastic Four (FF).

For those of you that don't read comic books, the Silver Surfer is the herald of Galactus an entity that devours worlds.  In this film we don't see Galactus just a big cloud.  I think their special effects budget was strained by the computer generated surfer (voice by Laurence Fishburne).

Let's get to what I liked about this film, the Fantastic Car.

This film is a tremendous waste of talent also.  You've got Ioan Gruffold as Reed Richards, James Chiklis as Ben Grimm and Jessica Alba as Susan Storm.  Andre Braugher.  What does the film do with them? Nothing!

One thing that irritated me in the first film and continues to irritate me is a blond Jessica Alba.  Her hair does not match her complexion.  Ms. Alba is a truly great beauty, a Texan of Mexican descent.  It's almost as though the producers were attempting to anglicize her appearance.  While a blond Sue Storm is true to the comic book, they also cast a black woman as Alicia Masters.  In the comic book she is blond.

At least they didn't try to dye her hair.....

Andre Braugher is given a flat role as a stereotypical role as Army General.  He is reduced to expressing contempt for Reed Richards professionalism and talent and looking ugly.  His character is narrow-minded and incredibly stupid enough to trust Victor Von Doom.

The cast just went through the motions to collect their paychecks.

Don't buy or pay to see this movie.  If you want to see a real superhero movie, see Spiderman 2.  It doesn't get any better than that.",1199750400,,1692,4.604026845637584

They accept him and with the fantastic four quickly overpower the surfer. Then this villain becomes the surfer and so on till finally the beautiful sweet Jessica Alba convinces the surfer to change sides and save the Earth. Maybe a kid would make sense of it. I did not.

None of the characters were interesting. None acted well.

This movie is unbelievably remarkable. The cast worked very well together to bring forward the same incredible mix that made ""Fantastic Four"" the superb franchise it had been in the first place!

The CGI for Reed Richards worked excellently...this was the area I would have thought they'd botch up on and make to look unfaithful to what was expected, but it was so incredibly ""FF"" from the get-go! Too much fun and true to the character.

Along with Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis all did remarkable jobs with their characters too...and let's not forget Julian MacMahon's sinister performance as Dr. Doom!

1549638,4,B00005JNTU,"It is marvelous how Tim Story did it again with this Marvel Comics team in Fantastic Four-Rise of the Silver Surfer. Like its predecessor, this great movie centers around a development storyline of the beloved Marvel Comics superheroes Mr. Fantastic, The Thing, The Invisible Woman, and The Human Torch, as well as that of the returning adversary, Dr. Doom. Also, we have the introduction of a most interesting character from another world, namely The Silver Surfer, a being whose body is entirely metallic and whose purpose is to find stellar objects and planets for his master, who is known as Galactus, the sole survivor of the universe that existed before this one, to conquer and feed off of, energy-wise. As fate would have it, Earth is the next target; so it is Fantastic Four to the rescue!

As the story develops and the plot thickens, the Fantastic Four confront The Silver Surfer in a way that this cosmic alien has never encountered. For the first time, The Silver Surfer is asked why he is assisting the destruction of solar systems and the billions of lives that were previously at stake. It is upon this sudden reflection after so many millennia of blindly following orders that The Silver Surfer begins to reconsider the path that had been assumed as his destination or only purpose of existence. Feelings of remorse begin to develop within this individual; though his appearance is almost robotlike, you can almost see the facial contortions as he ponders what evils he might have committed for so long.

It is at this moment that a new dimension has been added to the Fantastic Four storyline development. Where the first movie focused upon the interpersonal dynamics that revolved around Reed, Ben, Sue and Johnny, this sequel deals with handling regret as well as atoning for mistakes created in the past. As the motion picture develops toward its climax, Sue, dealing with a seemingly lost and tormented Silver Surfer, who is regretting thus reconsidering his unbounded loyalty to Galactus, tells him, ""You do have a choice"".

Though it seems simple at first, it is in this movie that there is a beautiful reinforcement that despite the wrongs that one might have committed, the past, despite its destructive track records contained, is not enough to keep him or her from choosing the right path for the present and/or future. The redemption element was adequately carried out with The Silver Surfer and largely played out the strengths of the plot and action sequences that I don't  think could have been possible in the first movie, which was so focused upon the development of The Fantastic Four teamup.

All in all, though this is a comic book movie, it should not be relegated to a mere popcorn entertainment motion picture. And one might ask, ""There are differences between The Fantastic Four and Fantastic four-Rise of the Silver Surfer, but what commonalities are there?""

My answer is this: both movies concluded on a good, high note and between the two is a message implicating  that if one is no longer at peace with him/herself, then there is always that glimmer of hope that meaningful change will occur so long as one wants it badly enough.",1198195200,,3175,4.868518518518519
1549739,4,B00005JNTU,"""FF-Rise of the Silver Surfer"" gets four stars (it's probably a three star effort) because it does what ""Spider-Man 3"" failed to do.
It is simply a more entertaining movie.
Now I am the world's biggest Spidey fan...and one of the biggest comic fans ever...so I am predisposed to liking these types of films.
I will always give them the benefit of the doubt, OK?
Having said that, there are parts of ""Spidey 3"" that made me wince, in a bad way (like the whole 'Saturday Night Fever' dance-walk thing).
But there are similar sequences in THIS film that made me wince (like Reed's bachelor party) , but I laughed through it anyways.
It's all about tone, and this film gets it right.

Oh there's SO much wrong in this movie...lame dialogue, impossible plotting, excruciating ""acting"", pedestrian directing...

...but the beauty here is that you don't care AT ALL.

This is just a whole lotta fun to watch!

First of all, I think Chris Evans nails our cinematic Human Torch. That single scene where he's briefly ""Thing-ified"" is a riot.

Chiklis as Ben Grimm is perfect casting. His performance rings true to almost fifty years of comic lore.

Jessica Alba...well, let's just say I am aware of my Y-chromosome, and she is without question one of THE most beautiful women in film today. This is not her grand thespian turn here. She's not given the greatest dialogue to begin with, and she's not someone who can take a dull phrase and liven it up...

...but I don't care. All her dorky hairstyles and odd contact lenses can not change the fact that she is eye candy of the highest order.

Ioan as Reed is another matter. Half the time, he's awful and half the time he's terrific. I wanted to like him...he is ""likable""...so I guess that's why, again, I cut him some slack.

The Silver Surfer is awesome. Seriously. Gushing fan-boy praise awesome. Nuff said.

Yes, I know Galactus as the huge guy with the funky purple outfit and Pope-on-dope headwear. But in order to make that more appropriate for a modern film, it would have required alterations of such magnitude that COMPLETELY changing ""him"" into an ""it"" was really the only way to go. It didn't bother me so much.

Dr. Doom, however, bothers me tremendously. I love Julian McMahon. I love ""Nip/Tuck."" I love Dr. Doom, from the comics.
The problem here?
This isn't Dr. Doom.
This is Dr. Christian Troy wearing a mask. There is nothing enigmatic, exotic, or evil about him, except how he turns a general into a cinder.
Comic book Dr. Doom was epic, sinister and grand.
Who IS this guy?

OK. Minor quibble. Moving on...

Great sets! Nice cameo for Stan Lee. Terrific set pieces (the helicopter crash, the London sinkhole) abound.

With a few adjustments...really, not that many...the next film could be as good as ""Spider-Man 2"" or ""X2"" or ""Batman Begins.""

1549740,3,B00005JNTU,"A resonable start to the fantastic 4 franchise. The movie is directed well but not as good as the Xmen series . The worst thing about this movie is the soundtrack. The theme music is awful for lack of a better word. The direction by Tim Story is not as good as other super hero movie directors Sam Riami (Spiderman1,2,3), Bryan Singer (Xmen1,2) and Brett Ratner (Xmen3). The problem with 4 unlike xmen and spiderman is that this is one marvel series which stretches things quite a bit and requires a lot of tolerant imagination if you want to move it from a comic book to film. Although the idea of a rubber like stretchy man, a rock man (the thing), a human torch man who can go up in flames/travel at mach3 and a woman who becomes invisible lends itself well to the comic book universe, doing this on a movie screen is very tricky. To do so the director must employ a kind of real world seriousness to the movie like done in xmen and spiderman. The movie must take itself very seriously . These super heros are intrinsically slighly tougher for movie medium to be taken seriously and this gets in the way of the film. This one was atleast ok but the next one : rise of the silver surfer was a complete joke. This series is loosing out because the screenplay has to adapt a certain practicality, logic and plausibility when converting it from comic book to movie and that is not happening. You can't lift the comic book as it is without making changes and hope to make it work as a piece of film where you are going to have the non die hard fantastic 4 and the non die hard comic book fans also viewing the movie.

1549745,3,B00005JNTU,"FF - Rise of the Silver Surfer is a considerable improvment on the first film if not quite the finished article. In terms of its action sequences and story it was pretty close to the comic book style, although I thought the on-going relationship problems between the main characters were a little overplayed.

The best part of the film was the Silver Surfer. Unless you have read the comics you will have no idea about his background. So the opening scenes where he first appears, and is chased by the Torch are pretty well done. The later scenes inside the secret military base are probably the highpoint of the film.

However the best scene is a lovely cameo role for Stan Lee, who is turned away from the wedding of Richards and Storm. Lee was the creator of the Fantastic Four and the man behind the Hulk, Spider-man, X-Men and the whole of the Marvel comics universe. Now aged 85 its fitting that he was given screentime, because without him there would be no film.

After the military base scenes I thought it went downhill with the ending being particularly poor. Still if the next film improves as much as this one did over the first it could be a classic. This is worth renting but I would advise caution before buying, unless its very cheap.",1197244800,,1251,4.5265486725663715

Marvel's weakness is that the cinematic feel of their old Kirby/Stan Lee comics were mighty stuff for twelve cents in 1964, but are superficial in 2007 on a big screen. BUT it works here for a dumb, childish faux-epic that owes more to some geek doing computer graphics than complimentary scriptwriting.

Dr Doom is back, but Galactus is some shapeless whatever: BIG disappointment. Jessica Alba looks like a 13 year old in her mommy's makeup; a really awkward choice. Introduces the FF flying fortress: nice work for a classic bit of comic history.

The side-effects of his use of the cosmic power are a bit overdone, and the power exchanging side-effect may not please diehard FF fans - but they help advance the plot and show the Surfer's power.

We've got the return of Von Doom, and as bad guys go he certainly gets your attention and complicates what would otherwise be an overly linear plot.

Galactus is certainly not the way you're used to seeing him in the comics, but I'm not sure that the purple suit of armor would have translated well to the movie screen.

Another example is the Superman series, which peaked with number 2, and progressed downhill with 3 and 4.  In these two cases, fans got two great outings before the franchise went south.  Not with Fantastic Four.  The first one was decent, and this one, number 2, was bad.  In this movie, another being with superpowers shows up on Earth, and brings with him the planet-eating creature known as Galactus.  Once the movie delves into the details, it quickly becomes ridiculous.  First of, the Silver Surfer happens to look exactly like an adult human male, except androgynous in the important areas.  Second, Sue Storm reminds him of his wife, who happens to have a first name and a last name.  What coincidence; an entity from another planet that looks very human, with a first and last name.  Third, in the movie, the Silver Surfer is captured and taken to a secret facility in Siberia by the US military.

I liked the fact that this movie wasn't as dark as some of the Spiderman and Xmen movies are it was something you could take your five year old boy to and not have to cover their eyes. That being said, it was entertaining enough for adults as well.

The action wasn't as good as Spiderman and Xmen but the plot development and story were a little better. The dialoge was a little silly (stupid) at times but liveable. My favorite line was Mrs. Fantastic saying soemthing to the effect after she is forced to be naked for a brief period of time (the movie doesn't show you anything) ""why does this always happen to me?""

1549939,1,B00005JNTU,"I'm pretty critical about most film, but I've never been a snob about genre. I've seen great, visionary work in Action, Sci-Fi, Horror, Comedy, Drama... you name it.

I've also been reading the Fantastic Four comics for 30 years. As a kid, I used to dream about my favorite heroes making the leap to the big screen. This type of film is a complete embarrassment to the comic, which (as a medium) has been so maligned over the years as a lowbrow form of entertainment. If the comics are lowbrow, this celluloid atrocity is NO-brow.

First, let me comment on the cast:

* Ben Grimm (The Thing) is supposed to be a mammoth, imposing creature. NOT an ""aww-shucks"" curmudgeon that constantly stares at his feet and apologizes to anyone he brushes against, or even startles from a distance! I felt like I was watching Shemp!! Pathetic.

* Sue Storm (Invisible Girl) looks like a Volkswagen full of clowns crashed into her face! If you have to put THAT much effort into convincing us that this is a blond-haired, blue-eyed all-American girl-next-door, why bother? They've bastardized the whole thing so badly already; why not just leave Alba as she is? Otherwise, just cast someone who actually FITS the part! It's not like Alba is any great actress. ""Why does this always happen to ME?"" (as opposed to it happening to anyone else) laments the oaken-spoken Invisible girl, after an embarrassing scene wherein she becomes visible just after she loses her clothes? I don't know, Jessica.... Is it because you're the only one who can go from visible to INvisible? If you meant that this SITUATION always happens to you, wouldn't you put the emphasis on ANY OTHER WORD besides ""ME""??? Just awful.

* Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic).... I understand the need to give the stiff-collared, human computer a ""hip"" overhaul for today's young audience... but this schlemiel bears NO resemblance to his comic book namesake. He's about 20 years too young, he's a SHRIMP (Reed should be thin, but tall) and, as an actor, he ranks a notch below Dan Marino! NEXXXTT!!!

* Johnny Storm (Human Torch) is probably the only redeeming interpretation of an FF member in the film. He's cocky, impetuous and a superstar w/ the ladies. His performance caused me no pain. No complaints.

As far as the story and the dialogue go.... UGH. This is where I draw the line. Over 60% of this dog focuses on just how difficult it is for super-heroes to have a wedding. WHO CARES? That is no basis for a whole STORYLINE. The whole mess amounts to incessant, insipid and puerile dialogue that gets ZERO miles to the gallon. If you're going to put these characters under a microscope this way, write some dialogue that doesn't sound like a passage from Goofus & Gallant! The characters, again, were so off-the-mark that I thought I might begin to throw up, and never stop. Reed Richards, with a little prodding, becomes a high-steppin' chick magnet on the dance floor? I needed a double scotch after that one.

Doctor Doom was just a pointless addition, and his character is so far removed from what Doom is all about, they may as well have left his entire screen-time on the cutting-room floor.

This is, perhaps, the most witless script I have ever cringed through. Stan Lee's writing was like TOLSTOY compared to this abortion. As big a fan as I am of the FF comics, I held off on seeing EITHER FF movie in the theatre, and after suffering through this wince-a-thon, I know my decision was justified.

Lastly, the special effects looked like something that Sid & Marty Krofft cobbled together after smoking some Sigmund. The above-referenced sequence featuring our Mr. Fantastic on the disco floor had the most pathetic ""stretch"" effects you can imagine. The Thing looks like a fat brick-layer from Paterson, NJ. He can't comfortably sit on an airplane seat? The Thing would need an entire two ROWS, people. The Silver Surfer looked OK, but the mercurial terminator from Terminator 2 (SIXTEEN YEARS AGO) looked just as good as this. Regardless, if they had spent 40 of the minutes they wasted on the whole wedding nonsense on the Surfer, the film might have been bearable.

Kirby would spin endlessly in his grave, we he aware of how corrupted his creations have become.

They do take rather great liberties with the Galactus character.  The updates and CGI for the surfer and his board are pretty good, and make sense.  On the other hand, the plot is not very crisp.  While nothing was particularly wrong with the movie, it never really grabbed you and engaged you attention.

1550038,3,B00005JNTU,"I went and saw this alone in the theatre, where only about 14 other people were seeing it. (I'd gone to see the first one alone, too.)

Frankly, I liked this movie.

First off, the story is better than the first film. As Reed Richards, Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffud), is preparing to marry Susan Storm, the Invisible Woman (the hot Jessica Alba), strange occurences happen across the globe: lakes freeze into ice instantly, it snows over the Sphinx, electric power goes out, and giant craters begin to appear all over.

The U.S. Army's General Hager approaches Reed for help, and Reed secretly builds a tracker, proving that despite how much he loves Sue, he cannot resist tinkering on a new project. As the wedding commences, power goes out and chaos ensues at the nupitials, as a silvery streak flies through the sky. Reed sends his would-be brother-in-law, Johnny Storm, the Human Torch (Chris Evans), to chase it down. Johnny finally discovers that it is in fact a man who seems to be made of silver, flying at super speeds on a silver surfboard.

After his encounter with the Silver Surfer (Laurence Fishbourne as the voice, Doug Jones as the body, WETA Digital doing SO much...), Johnny discovers that if he comes into physical contact with his cosmic-powered team mates, they will automatically exchange powers. This provides much of the humor for the film.

Reed also makes a startling discovery: the Silver Surfer has visited other planets before, and eight days later, the planet was destroyed. The same fate apparently awaits Earth.

After a failed attempt at stopping the Surfer, Hager brings in a surprise assistant: Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), or Dr. Doom, who was supposedly killed at the end of the first film (although that did end with a suggestion that he wasn't dead at all), now not only alive (the Surfer accidentally ""ressurected"" him by flying over Latveria), but now obviously regenerated back to his former, non-cosmic self.

Finally, the Fantastic 4 successfully capture the Surfer, only to discover that he is not going to destroy Earth, but he is the Herald of the one who will: Galactus, Devourer of Worlds!

Okay, I'll leave you with that, now let's move on to the look of the film...

The way the film looks is superb. However, the Fantastic 4 have changed appearances slightly: the Thing/Ben Grimm (Micheal Chiklis) has had a re-model done on him, and now he bears a closer resemblance to the Thing from the classic Marvel comic. (Still, human Ben is bald, whereas he wasn't in the comics...)

Johnny Storm's hair is lighter than it was in the first film. In the comics, he was a blonde, but Chris Evan's hair is brown. Mr. Fantastic still looks the same... except his white sideburns are more noticeable, but who cares? Most notable is that Jessica Alba, a latin actress, has had makeup, a wig, and bright blue contacts added to her to sell her as Susan Storm. The wig is obviously a wig, and the eyes stand out as fake. Sorry, but that's how it looks.

Julian McMahon looked somewhat different. Apparently, he didn't age gracefully over the 2-year break, and he didn't get nipped or tucked. As for how he looks as Dr. Doom, he has a new outfit now, which is now like a cyber-suit of armor, instead of a metallic skin. (That, my dear friends, was done as reference to the Ultimate Fantastic Four comic series, and obviously didn't go well, so they retconned it.) It looks more like Dr. Doom from the comics, but not quite.

The Silver Surfer looks like he's been polished very much. Any shinier, and the audience would wonder why they couldn't see themselves in it. While the skintight boxers he wears in the comics are not here (but you can't see his ""junk,"" it's a PG-rated movie!), he looks very much like his comic counterpart, except his eyes. The Surfer's eyes never had detail, but here they appear in full detail, just made of silver.

And while we're on the look of the film, there is one item that needs to be dealt with: why so much advertising in so many spots? Some doesn't even make sense. Why is the Dodge Ram logo on the seats of the Fantasticar? (Though, I would WANT that car!) Why is the Thing holding a 7-11 Slurpee when he's obviously been at the Baxter Building the whole time?

And plus, there's Galactus, the Cosmic Vaccuum Cleaner. Not a giant in a freaky purple helmet and armor: a cosmic cloud-like storm that sucks stuff right off of the earth. (Okay, we do see the outline of the helmet in flame inside the cloud...) Dissapointing? Yeah...

The actors are great, but I think often times they don't act right. Several have noted that Johnny and Susan act borderline incestuous, and yeah, it's there.

I think that any future Fantastic Four movies need a new director: drop Tim Story, and let someone else give it a shot.

On that, the story of the film was excellent, but it could have been written so much better. For a third, try a new writer.

Overall, the movie gets closer to the comics than it's predeccessor. A step, but is it enough? There's plenty of untapped potential.

The DVD's special features are great: audio commentary on disc 1, disc 2 with deleted/extended scenes (though it does seem they held some off for an extended cut...), and more featurettes than you really want.

Great DVD, fun, but dissapointing movie.",1194912000,,5298,4.676344086021506
1550039,4,B00005JNTU,"The latest installment of comic book super heroes to jump from ink to the big screen is another big budget action fest. This time out, we find the Fantastic 4 fighting an alien invader, the Silver Surfer. The special effects are no less then great. The story is better then I would have expected from this popcorn film. While it is no citizen Kane, it did do its job; it held my interest and entertained me for 90 plus minutes. I'm not a super big fan of the comic book; I did read it from time to time as a teenager. I can't say if they are being true to the original or not. But if Stan Lee is willing to put his stamp of approval on it, that is good enough for me. Plus I'm not one of those super nerds that has never seen a woman naked so it was ok.
Well, here it is; the bad news. The main down fall is the acting. While not all the performances came up short, Michael Chiklis is great as the thing as is most of the cast. The weak link in the acting chain is Ms. Jessica Alba. Like the rest of the red blooded American male population, I think she is super hot. That said; I have to say she can't act her way out of a bad soap opera. I think in whatever movie she is in next; she should play a mute in a bikini. She is great to look at, but once she opens her mouth to say any thing it obliterates the illusion.
All said; I have to give this film two thumbs up. It was what a pop corn movie should be, entertaining. If you want to lose your self for a little while this is the movie to do it with.

1) The movie
i ended up watching this spectacle via .... (hey i don't ....... but in this case i had to since the BD+ situation caused me grief!)

 I was very much impressed to an extent about the silver surfer. I recall him being not too elaborate around the comics but i always enjoyed the character since SS strikes me as mysterious amongst all the classical characters in the series.  F4 historically had several interactions with other delights from Marvel over the decades such as Spidy, Hulk, and others.  So it was a nice choosing of having SS fly in.

Now the movie carried nicely over to its 2nd installment. The characters seem more confident and sort of grew in this. The plot seemed more human than fantastic powers driven; which is very different from the usual.  Spiderman did well in 2 and messed it up in 3. Lets hope Fan4 does more sensible writing if they do extend the series.

2) The Bluray medium:
i was very much disappointed the handling of this format. Studios and manufactures need to fix this! Adoption rates of HD content is low as it is regardless of formats.  Bad publicity and news travel faster than anything and the consortium who built this standard better have learned from this experience. (please read this months PerfectVision article on [...]

The studios should learn a few things from Apple when it comes to expanding market share. Apple does not penalize and lock-in the user to one license agreement to expand their 10% global market share from MS.  Instead they give it away for cheap!

BD+ has caused more issues than people buying into the format.

1550045,2,B00005JNTU,"In 1961 Stan Lee was about to give up. His line of fantasy/horror comics was going nowhere, and perhaps it was time to get a real job (never mind he'd been in the comic book business since the 40s). Encouraged by his wife, he decided to give it one more shot, by writing a new kind of super-hero comic book his  way. He asked his most experienced and prodigious artist, the legendary Jack Kirby, to come up with some ideas. As it happened, Kirby had ideas coming out of his ears (Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Spider-man, The X-Men, and much, much more, all sprang from his fevered imagination). So Lee had Kirby get to work on some of them, including this story of four compatriots whose physical make-ups are altered on a test rocket flight by cosmic rays, endowing them with strange super-powers. Not exactly new stuff... but it was the treatment that would be different. These ""heroes"" would be complicated. They'd bicker and have real human problems. There'd be pathos, humor, melodrama. They'd inhabit the real world (New York City was home to the Fantastic Four, as opposed to Superman's Metropolis or Batman's Gotham), and the real world would not be immediately impressed (fending off subterranean monsters and inter-galactic warlords can be tough on streets and buildings, for Pete's sake!).

The marriage of Stan Lee's empathy and real-life grounding and Jack Kirby's unbridled imagination was a success. The age of Marvel  Comics was born, and comic books would never be the same. As with most new ideas, the first couple years, while wildly inventive and imbued with an undeniable urgency and power, could be spotty and somewhat primitive. But Marvel Comics found their voice (in Stan Lee, and later Roy Thomas), and Jack Kirby, unfettered by commercial restrictions, was free to let his imagination soar. And soar it did, culminating in perhaps the greatest 2  year arc of audacious story-telling in the medium. Beginning with issue #36 (March, 1965) and continuing through issue #67 (Oct. 1967), Kirby, with words and dialogue by Stan Lee, gave us the Inhumans, the Frightful Four, The Kree Sentry, Warlock, The Black Panther (the world's first African American super-hero), Galactus,  the Silver Surfer, a great arc wherein Dr. Doom steals the Surfers powers and nearly takes over the world, and two great single issue stories filled with Marvel pathos and drama-  ""Behold a Distant Star"" and ""This Man This Monster"".

 Now, after the disappointing first installment of the new Fantastic Four film franchise, comes ""The Fantastic Four- Rise of the Silver Surfer"". If a big imagination were involved I'd say that biting off nearly 10 issues of that mind-blowing 32 issue story arc from the mid-60s (AND the classic ""Marriage of Reed and Sue"" from FF annual #3 for good measure) was admirably ambitious. Unfortunately, it seems the idea was to plunder the material for as many good ideas at once as possible; the filmmakers have very few of their own. The cast is able and, for the most part, somewhat well suited to the iconic characters they've been hired to portray, save the glaringly miscast Jessica Alba as Earth-mother/Invisible Girl (""Woman"" in the film) Susan Storm. I'd be hard pressed to find any similarity between Alba and the character she is playing. Where Sue is warm, Alba is Edgy. Sue is tentative, Alba is aggressive. Sue is a mature woman, Alba is a young hottie. And so it goes. The problem is only minimally exasperated by her horrible blond wigs, which change length much more often than even Judy Garland's did in Oz. Oh well.

 Chris Evans is appropriately smart-allecky and cocky as Johnny Storm, Michael Chiklis is coarse and rugged (if a tad small) as the tragic Ben Grimm, and Ioan Gruffudd, although again, too young, is serviceably reserved and geeky as brainiac Reed Richards. Julian McMahon reprises his role as Dr. Doom, and although they completely ruined the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe with the changes they made to his origin and powers in the 1st film, he is properly egotistical, vain-glorious and pompous for the role.

 So... the Silver Surfer (voiced by Laurence Fishburne  ) arrives to prepare the Earth for it's eminent demise at the hands of the Cosmic eater of planets, Galactus (FF #s 48-50). Tripping radar alarms and causing strange weather phenomena, the Surfer catches the attention of Reed Richards and the U.S. government (amongst others). There is a fun showdown between the Surfer and The Human Torch, which is the action centerpiece of the film. It's no world-beater, but if your expectations are scaled down for the cheesy likeability of this material, it's enjoyable enough. There is a big hunk of screen-time wasted on some irrelevant nonsense about the Army bickering with Richards about how and when and who is going to investigate what. The Army calls in none other than Victor Von Doom. I suppose the point of the nonsense was to justify bringing Dr. Doom into a story he had no real business in anyway- McMahon is probably signed for X number of installments, and therefore must be utilized. Doom, of course, wants the source of the Surfer's power, his board. He gets it, he's defeated (did you expect some other outcome?) That the greatest villain in Marvel Comics history accomplishes absolutely nothing whilst in control of the most powerful force in the universe is an indictment of the unimaginative or unambitious (I have no idea which is worse) minds involved in the creation of this project. And so the great story arc of FF 55-60 is swiped and dispensed with in a mere 20 minutes of screen time. Sigh.

The filmmakers are perfectly happy to ply their trade in standard popcorn cinema conventions, and the Marvel Comics characters they are adapting are just right for plugging into prototypical Hollywood B-film fare. It's interesting to note that the tried and true story-telling methods of classic Hollywood live on in two particular genres: feature animation and comic book super-hero adaptations. It is nice to know our children will be acquainted with the age-old tools of the trade (for a much more satisfying modern example of old-fashioned Hollywood storytelling, be sure to see ""Meet The Robinsons"").  Anyway; as in the Marvel comics, characters complain and wise-crack, they stay true to type, and at the right moments the violins start playing and the characters reach into their hearts, make some tough decisions, deal with some losses, and live to fight another day.

 The ""push the edge of the envelope"" vitality and urgency of the early Marvel comic books has yet to be captured for the silver screen. Back in 1962 Stan Lee and Jack Kirby captured lightning in a bottle and re-invented an art form.  Asking a commercial Hollywood film to live up to that special achievement is probably asking a bit too much.",1194652800,5,6821,4.926829268292683

The script was bloody awful(with lots of inconsistencies like the dance scene in a club with Reed Richards celbrating his bachelor party, wow his sweater and all of his clothes must be made out the same material as his suit! -just dumb) and geared towards a younger audience, but some scenes, were not for children. I had screened it first with hopes of my kids being able to view it. It moved fairly slowly and I did find myself fastforwarding through scenes. My wife didn't last the first 10 minutes and fell asleep after rolling her eyes a few times at the campy banter between the characters.

The Fantastic Four was a great comic book, but the translation to film was a huge disappointment. Especially the translation of Galactus and the Power Cosmic as well as the lack of the ultimate nullifer a huge disappoinment for me.

1550268,2,B00005JNTU,"FANTASTIC 4: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER brings back the same tone from the first movie trying not to take the proceedings too seriously.  The tongue-in-cheek atmosphere along with the comical dysfunctional family overtones are well balanced within the basic plot with guest character from Marvel's stable of super-heroes The Silver Surfer. He's the ""herald"" of a galactic entity called Galactus that devours worlds for energy. The Silver Surfer is scouting Earth as it's next target and the FF4 must stop him. In the comics, Galactus is a giant interplanetary alien being humaniod. In the film he's described as a mist or solar hurricane. Sounds pretty heavy, but the story at only 90 minutes is not treated as an epic story but treated as a small adventure for the FF4. This reviewer seems to remember that the FF4 comic book a lot more serious than what is presented in the two films.  It is nice to see these characters come to life on the live-action big screen, but the movie is again not very memorable as the FF4 have little to do in the film. Chris Evans as the Human Torch/Johnny Storm is once again annoyingly juvenile; Jessica Alba is again eye-candy but totally miscast as the Invisible Girl (er..Woman); and Ioan Gruffud again plays Reed Richards/Mr Fantastic as the absent-minded professor. Michael Chikilis as the Thing/Ben Grimm was great is the first movie which provided some pathos to the storyline, but in this second outing has very little to do apart from giving him a shallow love interest. Julian McMahon's Doctor Doom is as generic a villian as ever with no personality at all.  Andre Braugher as General Hager plays a typical military antagonist that filmgoers have seen hundreds of millions of times in the history of cinema.  The Silver Surfer is the most interesting character of the film and is given a lot more to do than the star characters. Also, he's given the pathos that was missing with the Ben Grimm character. Overall, a film franchise that is not given the serious treatment that was given to the other Marvel Comics characters (i.e. SPIDER-MAN & X-MEN) and given a juvenile tv-movie look.",1194134400,,2128,4.821917808219178

There was enough of it that it started to make an already bad plot worse. When Dr. Richards' lab chariot arrived with a Dodge logo on it, I nearly deleted the movie from disk. This movie didn't pass the ""sniff test"" that I have for all movies. That is, when otherwise smart characters do stupid things to advance the plot of the movie, that tells me the writing is lazy.

Batman Begins and Superman Returns were definitely for adults.  FF42 throws in some awkward jokes about s*x, maybe to try to appeal to adults.

The stakes are much higher, too, as the existence of earth hangs in the balance.

Deep in space, a mysterious, unseen force is devouring planets and the lifeforms which inhabit them.  The stricken world explodes, and a silver streak races through space in search of another planet.  Earth is next for this ""silver surfer"" and his master; known simply as Galactus.

Reed and Sue are currently preparing (for the fourth time) for their wedding day.  The past attempts have become media circuses and all have ended in failure.  But, the two are determined to have their dream wedding.  But once again, these preparations must be put on hold.  Surges of cosmic power have been taking place around the globe, causing dramatic changes in the Earth's climate patterns.  Snow has been falling on the Sphynx in Africa, and harbors in Japan have been freezing over instantaneously.  Giant tunnels have also been appearing.

The military has become aware of these problems, and they have asked Reed to monitor the situation.  All of this is being done without Sue's knowledge.

Reed and Sue make one more attempt to get married, but an unwelcome guest shows up at the wedding-the ""silver surfer"".  Johnny tries to fly after the surfer.  However, Johnny ends up in the clutches of the surfer, and he's dropped.  Johnny plunges to Earth, but he manages to ignite his flame at the last second.

Something happened to Johnny during his encounter with the surfer.  He is now able to switch powers with the other members simply by touching them.

Something else has happened, too.  Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), enemy of the Fantastic Four, has been freed from his personal prison, presumably by the surges of cosmic power created by the surfer.  To make matters even worse, the military has commissioned Doom to work together with the Fantastic Four to develop a plan for stopping the surfer before its too late.  In the course of his study, Reed realizes that the surfer is drawing his power from the board itself.  If the surfer could somehow be separated from the board, his powers would vanish.  Unfortunately, Doom has his own diabolical plan for the board.

Will the Fantastic Four succeed in stopping the surfer before its too late?  Will Galactus destroy the Earth?  Will Reed and Sue ever get married?

This is an excellent movie.  It's great to have all of the original cast members back form the first film.  The special effects are spectacular, and the story line is well-conceived.

I give this movie my highest recommendation.  If you enjoyed the first film, then don't miss this excellent sequel.",1193097600,,2836,4.903157894736842

I am hoping they will make a movie staring Silver Surfer too. It was really a fun take on their first encounter with him. I was also very impressed with the special effects. This movie is not an academy award winner so anyone who criticizes it too harshly needs to remember it is an action hero movie and not intended to be taken too seriously.,1193011200,,515,4.319587628865979

On my player (a Sony BDP-S1 with updated firmware) it takes about 90 seconds for the disc to load. When it finally loads, it starts playing unskippable promos for two other movies. The menu, when it finally appears, is poorly-designed and buggy. I say ""poorly-designed"" because it took me quite a while to figure out how to get back into play mode after I'd selected the director's commentary from the Special Features menu. Maybe it was my fault -- there were subtle visual cues on screen -- but the menu felt more like a puzzle than a user interface. I say ""buggy"" because, on my player, the Set-up menu left two black rectangles on the screen, even when the movie started. Another quirk: if I ever turned on subtitles, I could never fully turn them off again. By selecting ""None,"" I still got Spanish-language subtitles for on-screen text.

When I finally got the movie playing, picture and sound were excellent, but unexceptional.

Let's see...horrible dialog, boring script, unfunny one-liners, wooden acting, sub-par movie. This franchise had SO MUCH potential. It's too bad it was wasted. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis are adequate in their roles but I think there were several casting errors in the original movie, that continued to the sequel. Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd and Julian McMahon were miscast as Sue Storm, Mr. Fantastic and Dr. Doom respectively. They're not superhero/villain material. I just don't believe them.  And their horrible dialog doesn't help.

The saving grace of this movie was the Silver Surfer. Great CGI, modeling and voicing brought this bad boy to life. Like other reviewers said, he stole the show. But he's not in it enough and doesn't do enough in the movie to save it from itself.

Anyways, in summary I suppose this movie doesn't take itself too seriously but honestly, this is at best a superhero B movie. I hope this is the end of the franchise because at this point it's time to cut the losses. I can see that it's supposed to be a fun movie, but you still need some semblance of a plot and good dialog to make a good movie.",1192924800,3,1365,4.581967213114754

1550590,4,B00005JNTU,"We saw the first Fantastic 4 movie back in 2005. My partner thought the story was very weak, as well as the special effects. I also agreed with the summation of this film, but we both thought there was very good chemistry between the actors--especially Johnny Storm, and Michael Chiklis.

Director Tim Story and Marvel Enterprises decided to make a sequel entitled The Rise of the Silver Surfer and guess what, this movie is far superior to the original because of the following: The great special effects, the make up, the story and most importantly--the great chemistry.

Sometimes film critics are wrong. This is one the best sequels for this year 2007 thus far.

Brief Story Intro:
The universe is vast, dark and constantly changing with the death and birth of galaxies, but as our film begins, we view an astonishing cosmic catastrophic event happening to a planet--It is being drained of life by a huge vortex of energy. Moments quickly past and that world explodes and a shooting silver streak of light appears racing across the cosmos in search for another suitable planet--we are next--for one he serves, Galactus.

Currently, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are in the final preparations of getting married but meanwhile, that silver streak that was racing towards our planet has finally arrived. The news media's across the globe and more importantly, our military has taken notice of this cosmic object because it has caused strange phenomena across the globe such as giant sized cylindrical tunnels. The military approaches Reed with their concerns--they want him to build a tracking device to follow his position. He is hesitant at first because he does not want any distractions to get in the way of their wedding, but he soon yields to their wishes--without Sue knowing, the device is built within his laboratory.

As the wedding begins on top of their building, the same silver streaking form that has caused havoc across the world; flies across the skyline of New York City. Reed tells Johnny to flame on and to chase this strange object, but as he catches up to this thing, he notices that it is a being on a surf board--he stops and he is quite amazed but he is even more determined to confront this being. He continues his pursuit, when suddenly this ""Silver Surfer,"" grabs him by the throat and soars off to the upper atmosphere and drops him. Johnny plunges to the Earth below but moments before he strikes the ground he ignites his flame and survives the fall.

When Johnny returns to their headquarters, Reed examines him and discovers that Johnny's DNA has undergone some changes--because of his encounter with the surfer. He is now able to switch or use the powers of the other three by simply touching them.

In the intervening time, the cosmic powers of the Surfer has enabled Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) to be freed his statue external appearance, therefore, he learns of the Surfer and his astonishing powers. He tracks the Surfer to Antarctica where he offers him the chance to join forces with him but the Surfer refuses. However, Doom is not pleased with this and strikes him with his power of electricity--this angers the Surfer--then he strikes back with incredible force sending Doom propelling backwards into the ice. Doom heals from his encounter therefore, returning him back to human form.

The Surfer goes about his business creating more cylindrical tunnels through out the earth but Reed discovers that his board is the source of his powers.

Will Reed and the rest of the group (along with the military) stop the Surfer? If they catch him, will this stop the mighty Galactus from destroying the Earth?

Review:
This movie and the rating of PG will definitely not disappoint the hardcore fan or even the general viewing audience. There is simply no time--during the 90 minutes--for us to be frustrated with story/character, development, special effects, the lack of chemistry, and even the length of the movie. Technically speaking they did a wonderful job in editing because the story had a fast pace--it keeps your attention--and it did not drag like other sequels that we have seen earlier in the year such as Spider-man 3, Shrek the Third, and even Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End.

First off, the story/character development follows a very comic book set-up because it introduces the villains and their plans for destruction (Silver Surfer/Galactus) with total control and power. We also are introduced to the troubles and concerns of the good guys (Fantastic Four), but more importantly with see the friendship and love that they share with one another. Theses attributes create great chemistry. This was somewhat established in the first film, but now it is taken to a whole new level with the leader of the group Reed (Gruffudd) who shows us in some different ways in his acting: He is no longer pushed around or bullied by opposing forces such as Doom or to be more specific his own family. Secondly, he is very un-selfish and more understanding of the needs of the group--especially his new wife, and their wedding. Most importantly, we are giving the opportunity to see this in his confidence as the leader of this team. One of the best examples in the film is where the four are working together to save a Ferris wheel, and of course Johnny dashes off to chase the Surfer. We see all of these leadership qualities exemplified in this particular sequence of the film. Because of these qualities, the chemistry between the actors is outstanding because they reflect--leadership qualities like Reed--in their own mannerisms toward each other and most importantly to the Silver Surfer.

Ok, the audience could be very pleased with all this drama but what about the special effects and makeup--in the first film, we did not see enough of this attribute nor was the makeup or costume design very impressive. What we like is that there is less emphasis on the CGI. The makers of the film combine makeup with the CGI to give a very realistic and theatrical style to our characters. Some examples include; the design and makeup on Dr. Doom who has a more authentic look of a crazed evil villain--mainly because of his wardrobe. The Thing's makeup gives us the realism of rock and the man he once was--a compassionate fellow. Most importantly, the makers of this film captured the true essence of the Surf's personality and powers--like the CGI flying sequences, which illustrate his power of speed and grace. They do this very effectively. The makeup department did an outstanding job with the close-ups. It just conveyed a sense of sadness, solitude, and humanity--which we really do not get a chance to see a lot of in movies today. This movie illustrates superhero realism to the fullest.

The Verdict:
Permission granted when going to see this film, this film has everything a movie wants in a blockbuster sequel; action, drama, special effects, and course a fantastic--no pun intended it--story. This is the best sequel for this year 2007 thus far.",1192838400,2,7033,4.89010067114094

1550592,3,B00005JNTU,"Okay did you ever sit through a movie and think afterwards, did I miss something? Well in this latest installment of Fantastic Four, you miss any real story or character development. You don't feel much in the way of emotions, and although the effects are decent there certainly isn't anything to text home about. Overall watchable, just not what you hoped for from these comic book characters. I personally was not thrilled with the idea of wrapping the main story of Silver Surfer with the wedding of Richards and Storm. I'd be lying if I said I liked it better than the last Spiderman. I would hope there will be a third movie and they will work harder to develop the story and characters. I sure didn't feel much about the Silver Surfer one way or another.",1192579200,,760,4.554744525547445
1550593,4,B00005JNTU,"Fantastic Four: RIse of the Silver Surfer is like an episode to a TV show. Short, and and ""to the point"", as much as to the point that comic book storylines can be. As with the previous movie, the story does not take itself too seriously. Thankfully as before, the characters, while potentially repugnant, are likeable enough to enjoy the movie, provided you are in an expansive, genial mood.

The action in this movie isn't nearly as impressive as action goes in comic book movies, or even as impressive as in the first FF movie. This is one of those sequels where they didn't try to overwhelm you with the EVEN BIGGER BADDER ploy of adding more action. So while the action is a little on the lukewarm side, there are enough interesting elements to keep it alive: such as the Silver Surfer himself, who is very well done. I was never a Silver Surfer fan, but this movie made him interesting. Dr Doom/Victor von Doom is still terrible, Jessica Alba is still distracting and annoying, Ioan Gruffud is himself, Chris Evans is funny/annoying, and Thing is far more bearable now that he has gotten over his transformation.

This is a movie you will like it in spite of it's drawbacks.",1192492800,2,1180,4.587677725118484
1550594,4,B00005JNTU,"I wasn't a fan of the first movie. I wanted to be, but was sorely disappointed by the lack of adventure, lack of plot and too much time spent on establishing character. Thankfully, none of those plague FANTASTIC 4: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER.

After a relatively slow beginning, an entity eventually dubbed the Silver Surfer buzzes the superhero wedding of Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) and Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), disrupting the festivities and hooking the audience into what turns out to be a tightly packed, exciting, frequently dazzling, fun filled ride. The scene that follows as Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) flames on and goes after the Silver Surfer, is an electrifying introduction to the movie at hand and the Silver Surfer himself. As the scene came to a close and Silver Surfer ejected himself into Earth's upper atmosphere... I found myself saying... ""That was awesome.""

FANTASTIC 4: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER knows what it is and makes the most of it. It is supposed to be fun. Sometimes cheesy. Yet, its the dazzling visual effects that push this film over the top. It's nothing ground breaking. In fact, the creators took what looks to be the same effects from TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY and tweaked them to suit their movie.

From a guy that hated the original, I would watch this movie again and again. I mean, you could criticize that it was only 92 minutes long, but it didn't break up all those dazzling action scenes with fluff and stuff like some superhero movies (spiderman3), it kept to the action, and was never boring.",1192406400,3,1545,4.7790262172284645

That said, however, I have to now admit that this was another, thoroughly enjoyable production on a smaller screen (I have a 60-inch Sony A3000 at home).  Picture quality, sound quality, and entertainment value were all first rate.  Chiklis has the Thing down, making him my favorite FF character, though Johnny was the most entertaining character in the first film.  I have a new Sony Blu-ray player that does not yet have the latest upgrade and--except for a slow, initial upload of the disk--I experienced no gliches or problems watching this disk at any time.",1192406400,,847,4.6644295302013425
1550671,4,B00005JNTU,"I grew up a Silver Surfer fan but only followed The Fantastic Four whenever they made crossovers into other Marvil Comic Books.  In the end, I picked up this movie for the Silver Surfer but I found that I enjoyed all aspects of this movie.

One of the things I didn't like so much of the first movie was how the Fantastic Four ""team"" just did not click together.  Sure, they worked together in the end to defeat Doom but all the internal bickering throughout the movie just never clicked with me.  There is a lot of redemption in this film as the four characters seem to come together more fluidly this time around and the four characters seemed to care for each other more.

There are a lot of other movies adapted from comic books that do a better job of fleshing out the characters but I just count this movie as a ""guilty pleasure""... a movie I watch more for the CGI and special effects than drama and tension.  So don't expect another Batman Begins or even an X-Men franchise and you'll enjoy this movie a lot more.

There is a lot to enjoy in this movie, most notably the special effects and any scene involving the Silver Surfer.  Like the original, there is a little bit of humor as well and they stayed closer to circumstantial humor than the slapstick, three-stooges type of humor they employed in the first movie.

I'd recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the first movie and who enjoy most of the comic book driven movies that have come out lately.  Like these other movies there are a lot of deviations from the original comic books so if you are annoyed by this then you better look the other way.  I'm surprised it got a PG rating as there were a couple of scenes I had to fast forward to keep my innocent 10-year-old unscathed.

Silver Surfer was definately the main attraction and you have to understand comic fanboys that in order for spin-offs to happen,Marvel has to cut/slice alot the straight from comics storylines either in half,sped up or incomplete. There's no more X-Men but Wolverine is coming,can't count on Spidey unless Stan Lee decides to use some other characters like Black Cat hell even FireStar to spice some things up a bit. Hulk is going to be a ""do-over"",Iron-Man,Punisher II.

1550674,4,B00005JNTU,"FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER is the second entry in this film franchise, which so far has been less than stellar, and yet cheesily addictive. This time out, a wave of cosmic radiation is causing alarming meteorological anomalies to crop up globally. But, still, the top news headline is the upcoming nuptials of Reed Richards and Susan Storm, this being hailed as the ""Wedding of the Century."" By now the Fantastic Four have more or less become acclimated to the limelight (especially Johnny Storm). However, Susan is concerned that the media hype and the group's superhero lifestyle will prevent her and Reed from having a normal life together. Not to mention, she's fretting about her wedding. But her wedding jitters quickly become moot with the ominous arrival of the Surfer Surfer, herald to Galactus, Devourer of Worlds.

And if that's not enough peril and aggravation, throw also into the pot a resuscitated Victor von Doom who comes to covet the Surfer's board (this plot also from an old Stan Lee tale). There's the rigid, controlling military presence embodied by a forceful Andre Braugher. And a recurring subplot which involves Johnny involuntarily swapping super powers with whomever he touches. I actually thought this was a nice touch.

RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER takes Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's most celebrated Fantastic Four story arc and adapts it to the screen. But I guess it couldn't be helped that their original story got lost in the translation. The most glaring difference lies in the depiction of Galactus, who foregoes his massive purple form and is instead presented as an amorphous entity many times the size of a planet. Simply despicable. Also debuting is Frankie Raye, who in the comic books developed Torch-like abilities and eventually became another herald of Galactus. Here, she's a snooty Army captain.

The first film was worth three stars, so the sequel merits three and a half stars since it improves on the first. It looks like this film franchise is gonna be more of a guilty viewing pleasure than a bonafide cinematic experience. For one thing, despite the huge world-in-peril scenario, this film doesn't quite exude that epic feel. It's a short film, which might have something to do with it. The film does falter in spots, with its hackneyed military plot device, its groan-inducing attempts at humor (which, dammit, I did kind of liked), and its misrepresentation of Doctor Doom (pathetic) and Galactus (shapeless and doesn't live up to his credentials). And then the acting.

The acting is...well, the acting...listen, Gruffudd and Evans are good looking studs, and Alba is hotness on legs. My appreciation of Jessica Alba's looks is in constant war with my feeling that she's miscast as the Invisible Woman. And she had an okay performance. I'll say this about Ioan Gruffudd: this time he comes across as less stiff onscreen. And Evans rightfully plays the Torch as fun-loving, cocky, and materialistic, yet heroic beneath the brashness. He's right for the role. Now two things in particular have cheesed me off about this film franchise from the get-go: one is how the Thing looks (which is latex-y), the other is Doctor Doom. I was appalled with how Doom was portrayed in the first film, and this quibble carries into the sequel. Of all the Fantastic Four's frightening, world-stomping adversaries, the brilliant and tragic Doctor Doom is considered to be, bar none, their arch-nemesis. There always was a grand but flawed, operatic element in Doom's makeup, but the first film ignored this side of Doom and instead reduced him into a rote villain. What an utter letdown! As they say, the hero is only as good as the villain. Accordingly, these films suffer. So, in this sequel, second verse is same as the first. If ever a villain needed to be commanding and majestic and regally self-absorbed, it's Doctor Doom. Julian McMahon just doesn't cut it for me. Also, I would've liked to have seen more of Latveria and Doom playing monarch.

The special effects are in turn ineffectual or awesome. The Thing, although inhabited by gifted actor Michael Chiklis, still looks cheesy. Effort was made to make the Thing's appearance more convincing, but I still can't help thinking that Ben Grimm would've been better served as a full-blown CG depiction. On the other hand, the Silver Surfer is fantastically brought to life. Thanks in large part to Doug Jones and to Laurence Fishburne (who lends his elegant voice), the Surfer cuts a bold and dynamic figure. But it might have been a good thing that the film didn't have the time or the inclination to delve into the Surfer's patented ""Christ on a surfboard"" persona (as someone dubbed it in a bonus segment). Reed, Sue, and Johnny also look convincing when applying their powers. I enjoyed Reed's elastic dancing in his bachelor party.

This sequel does benefit from having a faster pace than its predecessor. The story is bigger, as are the stakes. There's development in the characters' lives, a sense of things progressing. Reed and Sue are getting hitched, Ben's found Alicia. Johnny actually worries that the team might split up. Stan Lee also shows up (but is rebuffed). There's an element introduced into the F.F. pictures which isn't in the other Marvel superhero films. Unlike Spidey, the Hulk, and the X-Men, the Fantastic Four aren't shunned by the public. In fact, the F.F. are idols to millions. Too, this team dispenses with secret identities. As such, they enjoy a certain celebrity status and profit from their own line of toys and other F.F. endorsed products (the bonus disc has a deleted scene which touches a bit on this). Of course, on the down side, the bad guys know exactly where to find them...

This dvd set is the 2-disc Power Cosmic Edition, and it's stacked with special features. Disc 1 has the film presentation in Widescreen and Full Screen, along with 2 audio commentaries (both on side B), one by Director Tim Story and the other by Producer Avi Arad, the screenwriter, and the film editors.

Disc 2 comes with: 9 and a half minutes worth of extended and deleted scenes with Tim Story's optional commentary (watch for the Fan-4-Store); ""Family Bonds"" - the comprehensive 46-minute-long ""Making Of"" featurette; a segment on the Fantasticar; an ""Interactive Fantasticar Experience""; ""The Power Cosmic"" featurette - a CG breakdown of the Surfer; the ""Character Design with Spectral Motion"" featurette - Chiklis drops funny comments as he undergoes his daily Thing make-up routine; the in-depth documentary ""Sentinel of the Spaceways: Comic Book Origins of the Silver Surfer"" (38 minutes long, includes interviews with Surfer writers Stan Lee, Jim Starlin, and Steve Englehart); ""Scoring the Fantastic"" - the musical score featurette; ""Still Galleries: Behind the Scenes, Characters and Concept Art""; and the theatrical trailers. Damn good extras.

I grew up on the F.F., on Lee and Kirby and Byrne, and I do wish that these pictures evoked more of a sense of grandeur. In Marvel comics, the Fantastic Four had the final say in close knit family ties, thrilling adventures, and amazing space opera. On the other hand, I'm glad there are movies about the F.F. out there. The product is what it is - something which falls short of its potential. It's a cheesy, guilty pleasure.

One reviewer on a different product made the remark that some things are bad because of what they are and others are bad because of what they're missing. Same thing applies here: the sequel is better than the first one, sure, but what it does have should've been a whole lot better.

Reed Richards and Sue Storm are trying to get married but constant postpones leave them frustrated. Well bigger things to worry about when a mysterious being from space riding a silver board appears and is causing disturbances and the team, along with Johnny Storm and Ben have to stop him but it's not about stopping the surfer but rather who he works for. Then there's that pesky Victor Von Doom back who always has schemes he'd like to put into action.

The action sequences are a bit more exciting, the CG is getting better (particularly the Silver Surfer, expertly done and helped brought to life by Doug Jones, best known for working with Guillermo Del Toro on Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth) and the actors seem to be getting more comfortable. However it still has a tendency to let characters do one-liners a lot and never really invest in the characters for awhile before someone comes in with an eye on a joke or 2. Sure everything can't be super serious a la Batman Begins but tone down on the comedy guys, this ain't Saturday Night Live.

Another problem is the casting since the actors don't really do bad in their parts (although Julian McMahon still feels wrong for Dr. Doom despite being great on Nip/Tuck) but they don't really excel in their roles either. One notable exception aside from the Surfer is Chris Evans as Johnny who at least is starting to grow up, at least when he's not being goofy.

There's the rare comic book fan that will love this while others will either say it outright sucks or it's good but could've been better. I'm the latter: if only we could reboot this franchise too.",1192060800,,2205,4.61734693877551

The humor was there, the effects were there, and the action was there...HOWEVER...if it had not been for the Silver Sufer and the imminent ""threat"" of Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds. Seeing a live action Silver Surfer was a dream come true, excellently handled via special efx. However, having grown up on the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer comics, I was let down not only by the lack of chemistry between the 4,the return of Dr. Doom, or the overdone comic angle, it's just that I'd never seen an appearance of the Silver Surfer without an appearance of Galactus himself. We're only given a glimpse of what appears to be a shadowy silhouette of his helmet and the hovercraft through which he sucks planets dry...but NOPE...no apocalyptic slugfest between the F4 & Surfer and Galactus here(guess they ran out of money). There is a hint during the credits of what I hop will be a Silver Surfer film...I'm guessing that what we see there is a product of his being exiled and confined to planet earth by Galactus. As far as a F4 pt 3 is concerned...I think Marvel needs to concentrate on Wolverine and the HULK.",1192060800,,1248,4.575892857142857
1550678,3,B00005JNTU,"As a long time superhero and Silver Surfer fan, I was so disappointed in the shallow storyline of this film.  The gadgets and special effects, of course, were wonderful in this movie, but it had no meaning.  I guess it is simply geared to 12-year-olds, which is disappointing to those of us who loved the ideals and meaning in the Silver Surfer original storyline.  A fantastic story already existed involving the Fantastic 4 and the Surfer.  However, instead of using it as a basis and embellishing it for a movie, they changed it completely. Sue Storm never said anything to the Surfer that even resembled what Alicia Masters said in the original story, which made him realize earth and its inhabitants were worth saving and caused him to confront and bargain with Galactus, the result of which left him trapped on earth.  Instead, the Surfer acted because Sue reminded him of Shalla Bal.  That doesn't show him regaining humanity (even though he's not human).  And we learn nothing of his important history other than his name and that he is in Galactus' service to save his own planet.  Even 12-year-olds require more depth than that to become entertained.

Somethings seen in comics don't translate well to film, a giant planet eating man is one of them. Other than that I considered it an enjoyable film, the dancing scene was a bit too much for me, but hey even the Spiderman franchise , which i considered to be the reigning champ of superhero movies, went the way of the cheesy dance, so what can I say...",1192060800,,830,4.161490683229814
1550779,2,B00005JNTU,"I wasn't expecting too much when the first ""Fantastic 4"" film came out. I was pleaseantly surprised. What I expected to be a mindless story filled with cardboard-cutout characters actually ended up being a well-constructed story with REAL characterization. I CARED about the characters and what was happening to them.

Not so, for the sequel. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" was what I was expecting the original film to be like, so I guess the film makers are regressing with this franchise.

This SHORT movie, seems to be in a great big hurry to get from one scene to the next. The pace is so frenetic, it leaves the viewer with the feeling that he (or she) has missed something. It skips the whole ""character development"" thing which brought absolutely nothing new to the main characters that I grew to love so much in the first film. They just seem to be merely observers of the events that happen around them rather than catalysts to the development of the plot, action, and eventual resolution.

Also, it seems as if the director was in such a hurry to get through each scene in order to get to the action, that he omits (or just plain forgets) to explain a few things. Why did Dr. Doom ""come back to life""? Why was the Silver Surfer bound to the servitude of Galactus? How did Reed Richards make his ""civilian"" clothes stretch with his body when he was on the dance floor (a completely REDICULOUS scene, I must add)?

Oh, well. What's done is done. I was really let down with this sequel. If a third film is in the works, I hope the creators return to form. I'm glad I only rented this title. It's definitely not worth owning, in my opinion. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was due to the special effects.

1550781,1,B00005JNTU,"As bad as the first film was (Dr. Doom was a complete joke!), at least that one had some charm to it and was somewhat enjoyable. This time around, things are a little bit different. Having the Silver Surfer in this one seemed like a very redeeming quality. Unfortunately, even the Silver Surfer could not make this garbage watchable. Lawrence Fishbourne (who did a great job as the Surfer's voice) was the best thing about this movie, just to give one an idea of how bad this movie was. Every other casting choice was just horrible. I can't get over how bad the acting is. Galactus should have been the main focus in this movie; instead, we have to deal with pretty boy Dr. Doom again. He's not suppose to sound so nice! He's friggin' Dr. Doom! The only amusing bit was when Stan Lee was trying to get into the wedding and was denied entry (and that was only mere seconds). Other than that, it was just a pain to watch. Just when comic movies where actually starting to get good, you get crap like X-Men 3, Ghost Rider, Spider-Man 3, and now this god-awful film (actually, this came out before SP3). When I was younger, having all these comic movies seemed only a dream; now, it's a bloody nightmare.",1191888000,4,1200,4.4343891402714934
1550782,3,B00005JNTU,"One of the problems this genre of movie has is that if it sticks to its comic book origins (allowing for some updates for the time period), it is criticized for being too ""comic book"" and if it is transformed into a sophisticated Hollywood story it is faulted for leaving its roots and not being true to its origins.  Well, this movie is pretty much a comic book with all its limitations and pretensions.  Being a fan of the Fantastic Four when I was a child, I still have a soft spot in my heart for this group of super heroes.  For me, the Silver Surfer showed up just before I stopped reading comic books, so I never got into what became a long career for that character (I think he had his own comic book title for a time, which I never read).

I do not like how this movie transforms Galactus into a voiceless cloud.  His dialogue with the surfer was part of the fun of the story.  Still, when ""he"" (it?) finally does arrive, it is suitably threatening.  And Dr. Doom coming back after being completely and permanently defeated in the first movie is in the finest comic book tradition.

Decent mindless family entertainment.  Not great by any stretch of the imagination, but watching Reed Richards dance after being coerced into a bachelor party (as much of one as Reed Richards could have) is pretty funny.  And the gimmick of the four transferring their powers to each other is also a deft touch.

The surfer is enigmatic, but could have been more charismatically done.  When he showed up in the comic book, the kids loved him.  I can't imagine too many being drawn to this rather cold and enigmatic creation.  While he does talk briefly about why he helps Galactus, we never really get inside him, he never comes ""alive"".  However, his CGIness does look cool.

1550783,2,B00005JNTU,"One of the most visually impressive and action-packed films of the summer, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is also one of the most lifeless. Proving once again that special effects can't make up for a ridiculous story and ludicrous characters, Tim Story's highly anticipated blockbuster sequel fails to be even as entertaining as the original - which means it shouldn't have been made.

On the brink of the 4th time Reed Richards, aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm, aka The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba) are attempting to get married, a cosmic disturbance causes satellites and tracking systems to go haywire. A mysterious silver humanoid alien has come to Earth to see its destruction at the hands of its master, Galactus, an all-powerful planet-consuming monstrosity (of curiously cloudy special effects). As the military attempts to recruit the Fantastic Four to aid them in capturing the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones), Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) makes a reappearance to suspiciously aid the foursome in saving the world. But allegiances and partnerships are put in check as the pressures surmount for our heroes as well as the super-powerful Surfer, who may end up being the key to preventing the fall of humanity.

Starting up with the usual overwhelming amount of comedy and jokes, the story quickly progresses as the hilariously bizarre Silver Surfer makes an appearance to crash the media-crazed wedding of Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. Everything happens fast in this film, which is understandable considering its 92-minute running time. The group is charged with building complex devices to track the dangerous silver alien, and they have them completely ready to go by the next scene. They jump from location to location in the blink of an eye. And once again the technical jargon is craftily avoided by blatantly refusing to explain anything. The audience doesn't care to know how or why things work anyway, so this saves time. And in a world where people can stretch their body parts to unimaginable lengths or engulf themselves in flames, who really needs an explanation?

So many ridiculous concepts and ideas surface in this film. Dr. Doom returns, this time to help the Fantastic Four catch the Silver Surfer. But his true intentions are so glaringly obvious, it's preposterous to think they would ever go along with the plan. And the government and army are the ones to instigate the reunion as well as mastermind the capture plan. Their leader, General Hager pushes the Fantastic Four around like they're less than human, reminding me of the hatred towards mutants in the X-Men franchise. Why do the humans have any power over these superheroes? And why do they continue to help even when they are imprisoned by the army? Their loyalty to the betterment of mankind is apparently far stronger than the fragile strings that hold the plot together. Jessica Alba looks like she's lost all the curves she had in the first one, and Ben's blind girlfriend Alicia looks like she did Alba's hair. The make-up for The Thing is still fantastic, as are the abundant amount of special effects and nonstop action.

The short running time of the film is probably due to all the money spent on the bells and whistles that make this film so visually stunning. However, those flourishes can't save the humdrum tone of the story or the groan-inducing one-liners that pepper the always diminishing seriousness. With the ever-so-obvious future sequel setup, the overbearing ""love will save the day"" theme, and the ""Hot Party Girl"" cast members conspicuously toward the top of the end credits cast list, this progressively cheesy franchise is looking at another empty film that will undoubtedly make way too much money at the box office.

I'd say the most amazing thing about this movie is the 3-D pop to an absolutely immaculate picture.  Dark scenes, like the starfield and planets in the beginning title sequences and the night skylines of NYC really sparkle.  There is no edge-enhancement or pixelization to be found anywhere in the feature.

Bright outdoors scenes like the wedding, and the F4 battle with the Silver Surfer are pure demo material.

The lossless DTS-HDMA is another showcase soundtrack from Fox.  Although I can only hear the DTS 1.5 mbps core with my current setup, I can hear the music, rear surround and effects in such a rich presentation that it reminded me of my theatrical viewing of this movie.

There is an awful lot of extra content that I have not begun to explore yet, but the Galactus game is interesting.

Some of the other reviewers here mentioned problems playing the movie.  I can understand their frustration, but the insert inside the case clearly advises every viewer to update the software on their Blu-ray player.

I have always known he was the Herald to Galactus, Devourer of Worlds. Galactus was the reason why I wanted this movie in the first place.

Well, apparently Galactus doesn't like to be seen anymore, because last time I checked, he didn't resemble a CLOUD(!). Where's the battle between our heroes and Galactus? Anyone who is familiar with the Fantastic Four should be disgusted with this obvious attempt at cashing in from the first movie. Apparently, there wasn't enough time to write a LONGER screenplay, much less a good one! There was a very weak attempt at batting the Surfer, almost to the point I was getting bored!

I like comic book films to be fun but, it took away the drama in this movie and our heroes seemed to be in no danger. When the Thing gets hurled into Mr. Fantastic and they are imbedded in a wall the Thing's states ""That Smarts""! and peels Reed off the wall like a cartoon!

Although funny, too much of this just made it seem like a parody. The Thing's rocky exterior looks much better this time around and so are the effects.

1550888,2,B00005JNTU,"I love Stan Lee. I love Spider-Man to death. I love Marvel Comics. But, I do not like this movie nor most of the movies that Marvel Studios puts out. While the problems are many, this one seems to sum up most of them. First, they favor style over substance. One of the cooler things about Marvel Comics (and many comics in general) is that they are clearly not puerile. Even noted researcher Steve Krashen has spoken favorably of the power of comic books to unlock reluctant readers and he quotes some writing from a Fantastic Four comic from back in the day to support his claims of high levels of vocabulary, plot, character development, and so on. So why these cheesy movies? Going back to Ghost Rider and Spider-Man 3 before this, you have three bad movies in a row. Given the state of the art currently available, the visual concerns are addressed so that it is believable when super heroes do super things. Unlike super heroes movies of the past which featured horrible special effects, today's movies clearly have solved that issue. So the problem for all three then is the writing.
This movie is full of some ugly dialogue clunkers, some comedy pratfalls that would make the current producers of the new Scooby Doo cartoons (or anything with Jim Belushi) blush, and really dull action sequences. The actors themselves do little more than cliched actions, most offensively Michael Chiklis and the cardboard Barbie doll Jessica Alba, and even a really cool character like The Silver Surfer seems wasted. Why not bring Spider-Man into the mix since they both had comic book episodes together and the tension between the rivals Spider-Man and The Human Torch would make for some good potential. Alas, I fear it would be wasted with corny lines, empty flash, and the supremely embarrassing joke-within-a-joke product endorsement so prevalent in this film. Why not just have the characters do short promos before the film starts? It would be scarcely less subtle.
When a great bad guy like Doctor Doom is rendered as boring and non-threatening as a two-bit street thug, you know you've missed the target by a long shot. Until Marvel can really put together something worthy of the comics from which these movies spawn, I fear more of the same. I wish Stan Lee et al would put as much time into developing the movies of his beloved characters as he did into the comics themselves. That would truly be heroic.",1191628800,6,2409,4.76555023923445

The only glaring weakness I see is that they should've had Galactus as an actual being and not just a puff of smoke! I personally would've had this one end in a cliffhanger and made a third film with the focus being the FF and the Surfer trying to save the planet from Galactus.

I thought the first film was entertaining but in a comedic way rather than an action way. This one is better balanced between comedy and action. Dr. Doom plays a part here as well but something still isn't right with the way Julian McMahon plays him! Jessica Alba has gotten better in her role as Sue Storm-Richards while the man that plays Mr. Fantastic was a little better here too. The other two members were the best things in the first film and they continue that excellence here in the second though The Human Torch DOES get a little meaner and mature towards the end of the film.

Overall, I would recommend this for rental or buy. I am not a family man but I think this one is safe for kids too. I heard only 2 or 3 cuss words in the whole thing and the worst part was actually pretty safe when Sue became visible with her clothes OFF again by accident! LOL!

Check out his other reviews and you will see he only knocks the two recent Blu-ray titles but gives glowing reviews to anything HD-DVD.  It is obvious he doesn't have FF or Day After Tomorrow, that he is just rehashing news to scare away anyone from buying anything Blu-ray.  Very immature.

I am sure a firmware uprade will correct the slowness of the games (and HD-DVD fans are jumping all over this, forgetting, however, the HD-DVD machines they have have had to go through firmware upgrade after upgrade after upgrade) (Let he who is without upgrades cast the first stone).

Loading time for the disc is a bit longer than Pirates of the Caribbean, but that's fine, I am in no hurry.

1550972,5,B00005JNTU,My mom rented this movie from Netflix and wanted me to see the 2nd Sequel that she & my dad so it in Theatres. The 2nd Sequel was pretty good better than the first one. The Silver Surfer comes down to earth do his job to destory the world. He tells Sue that he isn't the one detorying their that he's working for another planet to help destory their world. And the evil Dr. Victor Von Doom comes back to get his revenge on the Fantastic Four to try to take over the world or destory it. My favorite part of the movie when Reed & Sue get married at the end of the movie. I always liked Johnny in the Fantasic Four he cracks me up that he is such a clown. I like to get The Rise of the Silver Surfer on DVD it's like worth the money.,1191542400,,731,3.88
1550973,4,B00005JNTU,This movie is freakin awesome great CG effects. Watching Silver Surfer on the big screen is worth the purchase alone he looks great. If you enjoyed the first movie like I did then you'll like this one.,1191542400,3,201,4.45945945945946
1550974,5,B00005JNTU,"After the overblown, disappointing ""Spider-Man 3"", it's a pleasure to see a superhero film sequel actually improve upon the original, and ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a joy, from beginning to end!

Rooted far more successfully in the 'classic' Fantastic Four comic book mythos (particularly of the 1960s), the film offers terrific FX (the Surfer is beautifully realized, as are the scenes of global-scale destruction), as well as the signature humor that lifted the Marvel series above the DC titles of that era. Stronger characterizations are another plus (Reed Richards, portrayed by likably geeky Ioan Gruffudd, is a standout, as is Michael Chiklis, finally sporting a bit of the famous comic book brow ridge, who steals nearly every scene he's in, as the ever-lovin' Thing), and the return of Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon) actually 'works', without overloading the story (the failure of ""Spider-Man 3""). Is the film 'perfect'? Of course not, but it is still a marvelously entertaining adventure, and has me hoping for ""Fantastic Four 3"", and ""Silver Surfer 2"".

The second-disc DVD extras are pretty impressive, as well; a relaxed, 'warts-and-all' making-of series of features provides a view of not only the problems faced in an insanely short production schedule, but the difficulties in achieving believable effects, with the crew willing to point out the 'tricks' they didn't think worked effectively; a history of the Silver Surfer provides an informative look at one of comics most iconic characters; best of all, Michael Chiklis provides a humorous commentary as a step-by-step application of his ""Thing"" facial make-up is applied (the transformation is remarkable).

As a long-time comic book fan, who grew up on the '60s Fantastic Four adventures, this two-disc collection is a dream come true...If you haven't seen it, yet, don't wait another minute; you're gonna LOVE this set!",1191542400,10,1909,5.2730263157894735
1550975,4,B00005JNTU,"After three previous attempts, Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are finally getting married.  Reed promises that nothing will get in the way this time.

But that's before the weird anomalies start happening.  A bay in Japan freezes over.  It starts snowing in Egypt.  And Los Angeles loses power.

This latest crisis just confirms Sue's fears that the two superheroes will never be able to raise kids and live a normal life.  She and Reed begin to think about leaving the Fantastic Four, which doesn't sit well with the other members, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and Johnny Storm (Chris Evans).

Meanwhile, the threat just keeps growing.  This creature is creating giant holes in the ground.  And he has awakened Dr. Von Doom (Julian McMahon).  Can the Fantastic Four work together to save the day?

When you go to see a super hero film, you expect action and special effects.  This movie has both in spades.  It's like everything in the first movie was just a set up to get to a real story.  Which is a good thing since I felt the first film was rather weak.  And while there is only one real standout action sequence, there are plenty of smaller sequences that were lots of fun.  As you'd expect, the special effects are believable.  And there are lots of funny bits as well, especially when Johnny is around.  And Stan Lee's standard cameo?  Absolutely hilarious.

So, what didn't I enjoy?  The story was rather predictable, and, despite character driven sub-plots, the characters are rather flat.  The actors do what they can, but they don't have much to work with.

Finally, the editing seemed choppy, mainly at the scene breaks.  It was like bits and pieces were cut out.  It was minor, but it did throw me out of the film a couple times.

This isn't great cinema, but it is an enjoyable way to pass a couple hours.  If you love these characters, you should be happy.  And if you thought the first one was weak, give this one a chance.  I'm certainly glad I did.",1191542400,,1998,4.59375

Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) starts the movie intending to marry Sue, but his do-gooder instincts tend to get in the way. The snooty creep of an army general? He gets his comeuppance, a lecture from Dr. Richards and learns the lesson that you should never trust a man named Doom. Then in the end, everyone gets a valuable lesson in the benefits of working as a team.

While I doubt this will get the superlative reviews the ""Batman Begins,"" ""Spiderman 2"" or ""X-Men"" films did, I can safely say I enjoyed this more than the overstuffed ""Spiderman 3.""

Including the forthcoming Iron Man movie with Robert downey Jr. Now fans get their chance.  If you enjoyed the first outing of the fantastic four, you'll will definately enjoy this one.  If you had mixed feelings about the first one, then at least rent RotSS for the silver surfer alone, very cool. The first movie had great special effect, but it was just an introduction to the characters and Dr. Doom.  Besides the special effects there wasn't anything really Fantastic about the first film.  There are a few things going on in this FF: rise of the silver surfer to move it along, such as Reed and susans wedding, Victor Von Doom returning, the Silver surfer wreaking havoc on the Earths Eco System, and preparing for Galactus-the world eater to destroy the planet.
Ben Grimm aka the thing continues to bumble around trying not to be too clumsey with his heavy bulk, and Johnny Torch still borderline Naracistic playboy type relishing in his and the groups popularity.
There were a couple of cheesy parts, like Reed getting down stretchy style at his own bachelor party-Not as cheesy as peter parker getting down with his bad self and showing off his dance fever moves in Spiderman 3.  Some cool parts that they displayed in tv spot previews is that johnny torch touched with cosmic radiation from the surfer is able to switch powers with the other members of the FF, which they show. Pretty cool.  Plot holes aside, inconsistancies abound this movie is entertaining, with a lot of action not only with the military presence trying to capture the Silver Surfer, the big rescue effort by the fantastic four in London, Johnny torch chasing the Surfer half way around the world, and an all in effort from the FF, SS against Dr. Doom. The only thing that disappointed me, and I'm sure many other comic book fans was that Galactus form was in the shape of a great cosmic storm with finger like tendrils to suck planets dry.  I would have liked to see the Colossal humanoid form from the comic book.  Did they leave it open for a sequel?  Why would they not?  However I think I would like to see a stand alone movie for the Silver Surfer.  Fantastic four is interesting, but until they start involving some of the other FF foes, there is only so much they can do with the same recipe.  Lawerence Fishburn does the voice for the Silver Surfer, soon as a I heard the voice, I'm thinking now I know what happened to Morphius.  Kidding aside, the silver surfer on screen was pretty cool including him summoning Galactus from space. Not bad.
Bottom Line....Enjoyable, if not predictable.",1191456000,,2830,4.668008048289739

1551077,5,B00005JNTU,"I saw this movie for the first time in 3-D, using the TV Eyes 3-D glasses I got here on Amazon.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TV-Eyes-3-D-Glasses-Watch-any-movie-in-3-D/dp/B000W9Y294/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TV Eyes 3-D Glasses: Watch any movie in 3-D</a>&nbsp;They turn regular movies 3-D, and boy did this looked gorgeous!  I have been waiting three months to watch this because I missed it at the theaters by one day.  And I was not disappointed.  I really wish I could've seen it on a big-screen because in 3-D this was just amazing.  The opening sequences out in space were beautiful, the moon looked like you could just reach in and poke it.  Anyway, if you get the chance watch this movie with the TV Eyes 3-D glasses, they turn normal movies 3-D  And this one really, really works.

After reading a lot of the other reviews here on Amazon I was a little bit worried that I wouldn't like the new Fantastic Four movie.  Everyone said (well, a lot of people said,) that the Silver Surfer stole the show.  I didn't find that to be true.  I think they balanced out things very, very well.  The Silver Surfer certainly was beautiful eye-candy and wonderful to watch.  It made me wish I had read more of the Silver Surfer comic books as a kid.

But it was the interaction of all the characters that made the movie really fun.  And the way everybody kept trading off powers, either deliberately or accidentally, added a whole new fun twist to the movie.  Johnny and Ben Grimm's teasing was still there.  But we also got to see a bit more of Johnny's vulnerability, and his sort of unwilling jealousy of the others in his team that they were getting something out of life that he hadn't quite figured out yet.  The whole Fantastic Four wedding was kind of funny, because here these two superheroes who are trying so hard to have a normal life, and the normal ceremonies of life, and all these amazing, impossible things keep happening to ruin it for them.

There is a lot of simple common sense wisdom in this movie too.  Even though amazing and terrible and impossible things may be happening all around you that doesn't mean that the little things in life aren't important.  Sometimes all you really need is the touch of a loved one.  Anyway, this had a very good storyline, lots of fun, jokes, japes, and don't forget the FantastiCar!  This movie was a very satisfying experience.  And it's great for both men and women, adults and kids. There is a hint of romance and sentiment for the women, explosions and bangs and flashes and chases for the man and, and lots of beautiful superhero action, space scenes, and just visual beauty - color and landscapes and even the Fantastic Four's headquarters, with all of its chrome and glass and lights in computers and technology - the whole movie was just gorgeous to look at much less watch.  Basically, I would definitely recommend getting this movie.  You're going to want to watch it again and again.  And definitely get a pair of the TV Eyes 3-D glasses to watch it with, it makes a world of difference.

1551083,4,B00005JNTU,"Here's one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original on almost every level.  True, the first FF film didn't set the bar too high, but I felt the lighthearted approach worked pretty well.

In an age of ""dark"" heroes, it's refreshing to see a comic-book based franchise that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Rise of the Silver Surfer won't ever win awards for writing, acting, or even special effects(ooh...liquid metal, never seen THAT before), but the characters are a lot of fun.  Even the seemingly unnecessary return of Julian McMahon's Victor Von Doom doesn't slow this one down.  All the characters get their moments in the spotlight, but Chris Evans' Human Torch benefits the most.  The story allows him to balance his comic-relief moments with some weighty dramatic touches.

With a running time of just an hour and a half, SURFER gets the job done without wearing out its welcome. . .something missing from more successful but flawed and bloated superhero films like Spider-man 3 and Superman Returns.

Finally, as someone who has succumbed to the temptation to buy more than one DVD version of the first FF, as well as Spider-man 2, I'm glad Fox decided to offer the 2-disc deluxe treatment for SURFER up front.

Rise of the Silver Surfer isn't a classic by any means, but it's a refreshing alternative to the increasing number of sub-par hero films out there.",1191196800,6,1380,4.863247863247863

The special effects...outstanding! The way the Surfer's ""suit"" reflects his surroundings is well rendered. The character is enigmatic and has great screen presence.

Don't heed the newspaper reviews; for example, the _Boston Globe_ reviewer panned this as ""unnecessary"" but of course did not mention the Surfer's transition from 2D comics to film (because he obviously never picked up the comic in his life).

1551158,5,B00005JNTU,"I've been a comics fan since the early 1950s.

I was there to see the beginnings of Marvel Comics, and all their wonderful superheroes. I continued to buy Marvel Comics until 1983 when I bought my first computer.

In the Marvel Universe, we're looking at characters that have existed for anywhere between 40 and 70 years (in the case of Captain America, etc.)

With that in mind, it's a real challenge to portray these characters in a movie, in a manner that will appeal to the whole wide spectrum of viewers and fans.

I vaguely remember what these characters were like between the 1960s and 1980s. They went through a multitude of changes in those decades. They've gone through even more changes in the decades since. In fact, the entire Marvel Universe was totally changed at least once, from what I hear.

I think they did a good job with this movie. Many of the stars looked great in their roles.

Dr Doom was wonderfully handsome and menacing.

The actor that played Reed Richards looked great in the role, and the romance between Reed and Sue fit my memories of their early relationship.

The interplay between Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm fit my memories of the story as well.

When I first heard that The Thing would be a suit, I was angry... but he was believable enough.

Ok, talk about being believable... Remember, we're talking about superheros here, who got their powers from a cosmic storm.

This type of movie, and the comics, require Suspension of Disbelief. If you aren't willing to accept the extraordinary stories, you may as well not bother watching the movies.",1190851200,3,1581,4.692028985507246

On the DVD, when you see Mr. Fantastic shove his hand under the door and stretch it up to the door latch, it looks kind of fake, but with these glasses it looked real! It was wonderful. The glasses enhance CGI effects, so all the special effects look better.
Fantastic 4 is the best all-around superhero movie yet. They managed to translate the team from the comics to the movies without losing any of it's charm, yet still make it accessable to people who have never heard of them before.
The relationships worked very well. Especially the way Johnny kept pulling pranks on Ben Grimm, the Thing. That made the whole movie worth watching right there. The dynamic between each pairing of the characters, be it old friends Ben and Reed, or brother and sister, Johnny and Sue, or clueless young lovers Reed and Sue were all portrayed beautifully, but without feeling at all forced.
The special effects for the superpowers were Fantastic. Watching Johnny ""flame on"" for the first time was awesome (especially in 3-D) and his flying scenes were totally gorgeous, managing to bring in the reality of the movie media while also reminding us of the best of the comic book art (which can be very good, trust me.)
The design of the costume for the Thing was inspired. You can really suspend your disbelief and enjoy this gruff, loud, ornery, yet soft hearted guy who just happens to be made out of stone. And Sue Storm is wonderfully snarky as she tries to handle both her new powers, and a brilliant but completely dense boyfriend.
If you ever liked comic books then you have to see this movie. Even if you never see another superhero movie. Fantastic 4 manages to be the best of both worlds, without ever losing it's freshness and charm.

One thing I didn't like was that they failed to show Galactus who is the Silver Surfers's boss.  There is a scene in the end where Galactus is supposed to be in the clouds but that was just plain dumb.

Speaking of dumb, I really hate how they change certain things and events and even people's skin color from the comics that I grew up with.  Some things are ok like having Spiderman shoot webbing from his body rather than from those cartridges that he invented in the comic book.  There is no way those small cartridges could hold enough webbing to go downtown and back let alone make parachutes and other items.  Also there was no way to tell when they were near to empty.  But changing a guys skin color is stupid as in the latest video game Ultimate Avengers, which features Nick Fury as a black guy.  He is white in the comics and should have stayed white (I'm black by the way)I don't know who the next villian will be but I hope they don't pick one of the weak ones (and keep featuring him in subsequent films)like the Goblin in the Spiderman movies.  FFROTSS is a step up from the weak, uninteresting first FF movie and may the next one be even better.",1190764800,34,1253,4.27542372881356
1551161,3,B00005JNTU,"One thing is certain. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is better than the original ""Fantastic Four"" film made two years ago. Because the sequel does not have to tell the introductory story of these four characters and the terrible accident in the space, it has more room for action, humor and romance. Most of us now know what they can do. Considering this advantage and the presence of new characters including ""Silver Surfer,"" however, the sequel could have been better.

I am not saying it is a terrible film. I enjoyed watching ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" and liked it for what it is. It is not trying to be ""Spider-Man"" or ""X-Men."" Its tone is more light-hearted and has more (intentionally) silly moments like the media circus surrounding the wedding ceremony of superhero/heroine celebrities Reed Richards and Sue Storm. It also has the ""bachelor party"" sequence where cool Ioan Gruffudd's Dr. Richards dancing like a top, well, literally, and other dancers going crazy watching it. All the ladies here are dressed decently (it's a family picture), but Jessica Alva's Sue is not happy seeing her future husband doing silly things on stage. Well, you may not be either.

This time humans face the danger of total extinction caused by the titular ""surfer"" coming from the space. We don't have much to say about the story. Silver Surfer's complex character (who returns frequently in the comic book) is reduced to a rather simplistic one. Two female characters Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington) and Captain Frankie Raye (Beau Garrett) could be used more effectively to improve the thin plot that seems globe-trotting without any particular reason. And though specials effects are good, they are not perfect.

After all whether or not you like the film depends on what you want here. One of the writers Don Payne also provided the script for Uma Thurman's ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" and I think that fact would tell you pretty much.",1190505600,,1928,4.926153846153846
1551162,3,B00005JNTU,"I thought this was a pretty good movie and fairly entertaining. I was a fan of the comic and I enjoyed this newest Fantastic 4 movie. It has enought humor in it to keep you cracking up and they did a really good job bringing out how each of the four are and how their characters interact, class, pick on each other and care about each other. I thought the Silver Surfer character was done really well. I have a couple of complaints though. I really didn't see the need to bring Doctor Doom back or to make him such a big part of the story. Seems that most if not all comic movies want to throw as many supervillians into a story as they can and it isn't really needed. They had ample enough material to deal with with The Surfer and Galactus. My second complaint kind of goes with a prop too. I like when Galactus was coming to the planet and they showed a shadow of his famous helmet going across a planet (or was it the moon?) but why not show the big guy and have some interaction there? Instead he comes off looking like kind of a big destructive cloud mixed with the tenticles of the monster in Hellboy that was trying to devour the earth.

1551163,3,B00005JNTU,"What would your favorite Saturday morning cartoon characters look like if they were to be recreated in a live-action feature? The answer is abundantly clear in the sequel to this critically panned, PG-rated, Fantastic Four sequel. Right from the start, it's clear why critics - for the most part - couldn't abide this sequel, or the original for that matter: the plot is paper thin, the acting is over the top, and the CGI, though impressive, is a bit cartoony. The real question with this film though, is whether it's entertaining or not... and any audience member would have to admit that it is.

From the very beginning, viewers have to accept the cartoony, questionable world that the Fab Four live in. Sue Storm, a slightly creepy Jessica Alba with blonde hair and blue eyes, is more concerned about her wedding date than the end of the world, while her fiance, Reed Richards, an unimpressive Ioan Gruffudd, would rather deal with complicated science projects than his relationship with Sue. Meanwhile, Johnny Storm, an even more one-dimensional Chris Evans than in the first Fantastic Four film is starting to realize the importance of settling down... at least according to the plot. And last, and decidedly least, Ben Grimm, a somewhat less interested Michael Chiklis is dealing with... well, nothing actually. These things must all be accepted, or at least jovially enjoyed, or the movie itself is a total bust.

Unlike other recent superhero films, such as Batman Begins, Hellboy, and even the Spiderman trilogy, which have attempted to establish their heroes in some sort of reality-based world, the Fantastic Four films don't even pretend that anything real is happening. Nonetheless, amidst all the overacting and plot contrivances, an enjoyable film emerges. As the Silver Surfer threatens to destroy the entire Earth through some form of CGI-annihilation, the Fantastic Four, of course emerge in some kind of classic comic-book force to be reckoned with. Surprisingly, an engaging, yet ultimately shallow, story-line emerges. Viewers who are prepared to laugh at themselves as well as the film will find the most enjoyment here.

There's too much questionable action happening here to even confront: everything sounds like an episode of any Saturday morning cartoon you could name. But viewers willing to suspend disbelief... and I do mean suspend disbelief... as in allowing a scientist to design a state-of-the-art flying machine in a pristine laboratory with no testing... will find some entertainment. The CGI is cool, the story is fun, and the Silver Surfer is definitely interesting. Viewers just aren't really allowed to think the entire time. Remember that one note, and you're on your way to a night of entertainment.",1190332800,5,2741,5.155056179775281

1551233,4,B00005JNTU,"This review is in regards to the film.
The film with its many downfalls does have one key element for success; an outstanding character! We all know that most of were disappointed with the first FF film, and the second does not do much for the franchise, but sometimes a platform is needed. This may be just that.
The Silver Surfer is one of Marvel's greatest characters, a complex individual that tends to demonstrate more humanity than the humans he comes in contact with. The film depicts this in a very concise nature, which is fine as long as they develop the character and give us more of that in the future. What's great about the film is that it pairs up heroes, which happens alot in comics...I would have liked to have seen a Daredevil Cameo in any of the Spidey films (sans Ben Affleck)or perhaps an Alpha Flight member in any of the X-men films etc. The Surfer is portrayed as he is, a very powerful being, (the scene with the Human Torch in mid air?) For those who might know and those who don't The Silver Surfer is the only Hero to Physically overpower the Hulk EVER!!!

The Film has it's moments of laughter, compassion and of course action. But still leaves us a little empty in the end. There's something not quite right with the whole FF franchise...(on Film) Doom is a great character who is played greatly...the Action sequences and CGI are also good, but the stories need some help if they are to continue to go the movie route, that or more guest characters...Namor anyone? At any rate, the film delivers what it is supposed to, entertainment...this however is due to the Silver Surfer, nothing more, nothing less.",1190073600,2,1637,4.568027210884353

Second, I found this movie to be less derivative than the first movie.  Those who have read my first review know my views on that movie, that it borrowed from other movies (quite possibly unconsciously).  This movie to me is more original, more its own story.

Third, I seem to have a higher opinion of the story than others.  True, the Silver Surfer was a scene stealer, but what else would you expect from the title ""Rise Of The Silver Surfer""?  I found two different instances where I was introduced to a hint of the plot, and then forgot all about it until the time was right; to me, this shows good quality writing.  There are some weaknesses, but you didn't expect this to be the Oscar front runner, did you?  It is fun, though, with plenty of humor added to the plot.

I won't say anymore, because I don't want to spoil the plot, but there are some good lessons on personal relationships.",1189641600,,1107,4.325242718446602

Nice effects on the Surfer and the Board, good voice to go with Norrin Radd.

1551242,3,B00005JNTU,"Whether it is because the first FANTASTIC FOUR movie was so bad that anything else would look great by comparison or because I was just in the mood for a superhero movie or that it actually was pretty decent, I really enjoyed watching this movie.  I suppose it doesn't hold up well when compared with the best of the superhero movies like SPIDER-MAN 2 or HELLBOY or BATMAN BEGINS, but all in all this was a fun movie.  I'm not a comic book fundamentalist (you know, the people who stomp out of a movie because it deviates in the slightest from a plot detail in issue 114 in the series) so I don't get too worked up if a film departs from the traditional depiction.  I will confess that I was afraid that they were going to botch the Silver Surfer.  Anyone who even casually follows the Marvel universe knows that the Silver Surfer is one of the best - if not the best - characters they have ever created.  He is wonderfully complex and manages to be both an enormously sympathetic character while remaining unalterably alien.

The great news about this film is that the Surfer is marvelously done and I personally am very excited about the forthcoming Silver Surfer movie that is due to come hope hopefully in 2009.  Laurence Fishburne voiced the Surfer while his CGI body was performed by Doug Jones, who is building a quite impressive resume.  I'm not quite sure what you call Jones.  Originally he was a mime, but he has carved a career out of performing characters that demand a unique command of their bodily movements.  The earliest role most will know him for is as one of the main Gentlemen in the classic BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER episode ""Hush.""  To this day the Gentlemen remain the most haunting characters to ever appear not merely on BUFFY but on all of TV.  He went on to portray Abe Sapien in HELLBOY and more recently the fawn and the pale monster in PAN'S LABYRINTH.  The CGI was just great and visually the Surfer was as compelling as one could hope.  I think the physical presentation of the Surfer in the movie was, in short, a great success.

The problem in the movie is the Fantastic Four.  There seems to be little or no chemistry between the four comprising the famous quartet.  I love Jessica Alba, but she just doesn't seem quite right for this role.  Am I the only one who finds Jessica with blonde hair and blue eyes in contrast with her dark olive skin to be, well, weird?  With dark hair and her dark eyes I think she is arguably the most beautiful woman in the world today, but I just can't buy her as a blonde.  Ioan Gruffudd is terribly uncharismatic as Reed Richards, but to be honest this isn't entirely his fault.  Richards is hands down one of the most boring of all the Marvel characters.  Michael Chiklis is a great actor and he probably does as good a job as is possible of playing Ben Grimm as is possible, but there simply may not be a way of rendering a prosthetic costume to where it looks completely convincing.  Grimm just looks like a cartoon character under any circumstances.  I don't know if it is Chris Evans fault that he is so unappealing as Johnny Storm or if the problem is with the writing.  As it stands, however, he seems like a knock off of a hundred other celebrity playboys.  I'm not quite sure what they could have done to make him a stronger character, but I think the producers, writers, and director should have been honest enough to admit that Johnny was a terribly one dimensional character either due to writing or casting.  The fundamental problem is that these four simply aren't fantastic.

The story was kept to bare bones specifications.  There is an A plot and two B plots.  The A plot is the Silver Surfer arriving on earth, where due to the demands of Galactus he is forced to drain the planet of all its energy to sate Galactus's needs.  The first B plot is the marriage of Reed and Sue and the second B plot concerns Victor von Doom's inadvertent release by the Surfer and Doom's attempt to capture his board.  There are a couple of C plots but, well, who cares?

Ultimately, the movie is all about the Surfer.  Narratively the movie doesn't break any new ground, but I was satisfied merely that they made one of the greatest Marvel superheroes - in the minds of some perhaps the greatest of all cartoon superheroes - convincingly.  While most of the film failed to be especially interesting, every shot of the Surfer was riveting.  So, regardless of the credits, the real stars of the film were Doug Jones, Laurence Fishburne, and the CGI team that created the Silver Surfer.  At the end of the film I was left feeling that I couldn't care less whether there is ever another Fantastic Four movie, but I'm really, really interested in seeing a Silver Surfer standalone.",1188604800,,4747,4.4906759906759905

1551293,5,B00005JNTU,"I'll admit that when I first watched this movie, I was rather sceptical and even somewhat cynical. I'd heard a lot of the rumblings that it wasn't ""epic"" enough and that they'd made too many changes, etc. However, when I sat down to watch this, it really won me over. Sure it's not the big action/effects blockbuster that it could have been, but that is really where it succeeds. If it had been made in that way, it would've been a lesser film. Allow me to explain. This film really captures the characters (their personalities, quirks and tensions) remarkably well. The emphasis IS on the characters. Not the effects or the action or the spectacle. THE CHARACTERS. The casting here is near-perfect. Jessica Alba probably isn't the right choice for the role, however, that said, she really does radiate a definite charm that won me over. Plus, Reed may not have noticed it (or at least he wasn't admitting it), she does look HOT in that outfit! Julian McMahon makes Doom his own, which more than makes up for the changes they made to his character. Michael Chiklis is perfect as Ben. But the real casting coup here, in my opinion, is Ioan Gruffudd. He is nothing short of perfect as Reed. Intelligent without being boring, confident enough to really convince as team leader. Tim Story really deserves way more credit than he received for making such a fine film. Pure entertainment from start to finish. And you can't ask for more than that.
And to all those who dismiss this DVD version of FF, both the JACK KIRBY: STORYTELLER and THE WORLD'S GREATEST COMIC MAGAZINE documentaries are worth it alone to buy this version. They are hands down some of the best documentaries I have seen regarding comics.

The film's flaws are part and parcel of what is wrong with Hollywood.  You have a beloved brand name with a die-hard fan base. But you make a film that betrays the core principles that made the franchise so beloved.  There is something about the present Hollywood  Movie Meat Grinder that denatures classics, and leaves us with a bunt when we should have had a home run.

This is confusing, considering the large Hollywood budgets.  There is plenty of talent that can be hired, and the fans deserve better.

For example:

SPOILER:  So we have Marvel's most powerful family, and they have the opportunity to fight Galactus, the cosmos's number one villain, and we don't even see the sucker.  We see a vague shadow over Saturn--you can hear the producers giggling to themselves that they included it as an homage to the hard-core fans--but a face to face conflict with this force of nature, no.  We were not gypped; we were denied.

SPOILER: So Johnny Storm is now the Super-Skrull?!

SPOILER: OK, Dr. Doom (this is really Ultimate Dr. Van Damme) would worm his way into things to control the surfer.  They got that right.  But he is so underused, and underplayed.  Maybe it's his rather girly voice. Bring me back the mid-80's Booming Doom, and I'll swallow down HERBIE in a New York Minute.

SPOILER: So the funniest moment is ""Dynamic Duo?""  It almost is, if you remember the Superman joke in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-Full-Screen-Special-Edition/dp/B00006F2TV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man (Full Screen Special Edition)</a>.  Stan Lee is having fun.

Well, they did get some things right--the globetrotting was excellent.  And the friction with family and career is a GREAT, COSMIC, ETERNAL, UNIVERSAL TRUTH that made the movie interesting. But we already beat that dead horse in the first movie.  SPOILER: A much better approach would have been this--after the disaster with the wedding, have Reed walk up to Sue who is sitting down, weeping.  Reed beckons to the minister and we hear a very quite ""I now pronounce you man and wife.""  This is like a battlefront marriage, where of necessity, the niceties are dispensed with.

So what can be done?  I'm not sure--they have used up (and screwed up) Galactus, and you cannot go much higher than that.

 The long awaited big screen debut of the quartet that made Marvel Comics a force to be reckoned with succeeds where other comic book films have failed by being true to its original source. Unlike the ""Batman"" films, which owe as much to Frank Miller's reinvention of the Caped Crusader in the ""Dark Knight"" graphic novels as they do to Bob Kane's original creation, ""The Fantastic Four"" is faithful to the original comic book created by Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby.

 With five major characters to deal with (the incredible foursome of the title and the villainous Doctor Doom), the result isn't head-spinningly impressive, but it has a charm that most comic book films lack. The movie doesn't waste time on exposition. It introduces the characters, well played by an excellent cast, and gets on with the show.

I liked Susan Torm & Johnny Storms Powers the best that Susan can turn invisible & create force fields especially when angry.

1551300,4,B00005JNTU,"I must start this review off by saying that I'm not a comic book fan so I cannot say whether the characters were portrayed accurately (i.e. the way they were depicted in the Marvel comics of the same name).  However, I found this to be an enjoyable, entertaining little film - quite a surprise actually.  Most comic-book heroes brought to cinema tend to have an extremely dark side - requiring a secret identity and so forth.  Not so here - no secret identities, no traumatic events as children or any of that stuff.  (I suppose you *could* call the event that made them into the Fantastic Four 'traumatic' but I didn't see it as such.)

A well-cast film - I especially enjoyed Chris Evans as the irrepressible Johnny Storm/Human Torch (girls call him ""Torch"") who is totally in his element at almost 4,000 degrees (not to mention the fact that even without the flames, the man is HOT)!  Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/the Thing brings both pathos and humor to the role - I especially enjoyed his rapport with the teasing Johnny Storm.  Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd - rounded out the Four perfectly.  And Von Doom was played with the right amount of ruthlessness, cunning, and greed by Julian McMahon - although I was surprised that they didn't melt him into little horseshoes at the end of the film.  Of course, that would mean no sequel, wouldn't it?

Highly recommended - also I believe it is suitable for kids as there is no huge amount of violence nor nudity (unless you count the Invisible Girl...of course she was invisible!)",1185321600,,1529,4.650557620817844
1551380,3,B00005JNTU,"The following review is a copy of a PM I sent to a friend asking me for my opinion of the film. His first question was ""Is Galactus in the movie?""

WARNING !!!! Major Spoilers Ahead !!!

To an unashamed Silver Surfer fan like myself, NO, Galactus was not in the film. At the end they showed this huge dark cloud about to engulf the planet and devour it. To me, this was not Galactus but his Elemental Converter, which he uses to destroy the planet and inhale the energy. This is what the Surfer actually destroys at the end of the movie, NOT Galactus. Any Marvel fan KNOWS that Galactus cannot and MUST NOT be destroyed.

However, if you are not a comics fan and you're sitting there watching this, you have to assume that the cloud is Galactus (because the Surfer says ""He is here"") and that at the end the Surfer destroys both Galactus and himself (""This is the end... for both of us!"") with a huge burst of Cosmic energy (which happens to spare the planet. Doh!)

Right after the end credits begin to roll you can see the Surfer floating in space, separated from his board. A promise of things to come?

 Also, it is NOT Alicia Masters who turns the Surfer to the side of Earth but Susan Storm. A minor quibble.

But the worse thing they did was give the Silver Surfer an Achilles Heel. Hollywood just had to mess that up. Courtesy of Dr Doom, they figure out that if you separate the Surfer from his board then he loses his power!!! What?!?!? This was a major foul up.

Speaking of Doom, there was way too much of him in this film because they tried to meld two different Silver Surfer stories together and in doing so they removed too much of what made the original story so cool.

This movie could have been so much better if they had just stuck to the facts. The effects are there. The Silver Surfer is WAY cool! His first meeting with Johnny Storm is fantastic to watch. His power is just as awesome as in the comics. There just wasn't enough of him because of his supposed ""weakness.""

But there was too much time wasted on the wedding of Reed Richards and Susan Storm, only to have it not happen.

 Too much time wasted on the supposed personal growth of Susan Storm only to have her brush it all aside in the end in the name of ""saving the planet,"" as if she has a choice.

  Too much character building on the part of Johnny Storm, only to tear it all down in the end on a single frame of film... just to get a laugh!!! Why?!?

If you're gonna build up to something then let's see the payoff! Don't brush it aside for a cheap laugh or for a moment of ""patriotism"" or whatever it was Susan discovered in the end.

Sad.

The story is too simple, even with such interesting characters and they waste a lot of time in matters absolutely no important for the story itself. Not to mention all the invented things, a lot of nonsense. And it will be even worst in the next movie.

Stan Lee is just a mercenary the same as Marvel itself, only interested in making money, with no respect at all for their characters or the public. If they want to make a movie with some superheroes, is ok, every one will go to the movies, but just do no kill well known characters in that way (figuratively speaking).

1551385,3,B00005JNTU,"With Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, director Tim Story attempts to step up the story a few notches by actually providing a real threat that our heroes have to thwart. This film is clearly light years ahead of its predecessor, which really isn't saying that much. The original Fantastic Four was just plain boring. Where the battle scene of the climax of that film was an exercise in the senseless, Rise of the Silver Surfer has the fate of the planet hanging in the balance.

At less than 90 minutes, Surfer is short on time-time that could have been used for actually developing something better than the ""Reed and Sue are getting married, so nothing else matters"" subplot. Jessica Alba's portrayal of Sue Storm is actually even more bland than before, which is quite an accomplishment.

To my delight, the Thing (Michael Chiklis) actually has a stable relationship in this fim. His brooding in the last film over the most cardboard wife in film history was just tiresome. His girlfriend, Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington), is probably the strongest female role in the film, which doesn't speak well for Sue, the girl who's power is to make her invisible.

Of course, Story finds time to have Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) take off his shirt during the film since he knows that the girls and gay boys need something to keep them interested. Sadly, it was probably the brightest point of the film.

When the mysterious Silver Surfer comes in to dig monstrous holes into the earth, it spells certain doom. Even Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon) steps up to help, even if he always has a trick up his villainous sleeve. The Surfer (voiced by Laurence Fishburne) gives a warning that ""all you know is at an end."" Alas, the movie didn't actually end until nearly an hour later.

His warning was that Galactus was on its way to devour the earth. Since that's obviously a bad thing, our heroes actually have to postpone their wedding plans. Poor Sue. The inevitable final wedding is reminiscent of the one seen in Spaceballs. All it lacked was the priest saying, ""Good, you're married! Kiss her!""

Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) can probably be awarded ""the dullest hero ever"" award, even though he can stretch himself like silly putty gone horribly wrong. It's a pity that his acting ability has the flexibility of a steel rod encased in concrete. Even still, Rise of the Silver Surfer is far better than its original.

In the end, though, it's just not all that fantastic. Perhaps if we changed the name of the film to ""The Tepid Four, Arrival of that Naked Silver Dude,"" we might have a little more of a truthful title.",1184284800,,2619,4.717724288840262
1551386,5,B00005JNTU,"{Possible Spoilers}

----------------------------------

I saw this movie, like, a month ago and I didn't think to review it because I couldn't think of a way of properly writing one without spoiling the movie entirely (if anyone remembers my lengthy reviews). And while this may be an opinion based upon only seeing this movie once (I.E., opinion subject to change), I've got this review bouncing around in my head and I've gotta get it out of there.

[Review Down Below]:

As comic book movies go, you can only either be promoted to the highest rank or demoted straight down into Fandom Hell, for just being unable to satisfy the general audience (or the fans). With the first Fantastic Four film, it falls into middle rank (3 stars), and it was only expected to fail despite hopes of a better film. After watching the first film several times over, it steadily grew to resonate silliness that causes furious blushing. Thus, I watched it when no one was around and I could grouse openly to myself, ""why I am still watching this?""

The answer was a simple one: Ioan Gruffudd and Mr. Fantastic. I've grown rather fond of both. So when I went to see Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, I was hopefully excited. I mean, the trailers held promise, so I figured the movie couldn't be all that bad. Thankfully, it was twenty times better than the 'origin' movie and reflected everything I love currently about Fantastic Four (Ultimate Universe-Wise anyway.) As straightforward movies go, this is pretty straightforward with its own set of twists, albeit mildly surprising and predictable twists, but twists nonetheless. The storyline is complied into two subplots that converge neatly into one despite the second subplot's late introduction and is completely character driven this time around. Surprisingly enough, its set two years after the first film. That's a new one for me.

""Set two years after the first film, the film begins with Reed Richards and Sue Storm are preparing for their wedding. Elsewhere, a silver object enters Earth's atmosphere, radiating cosmic energy that creates massive molecular fluctuations and causes deep craters at locations across the Earth. The government approaches Reed to build a sensor to track the movements of the object.

As the wedding begins, Reed's sensor detects the phenomenon approaching New York City, causing a massive power blackout. The object destroys the sensor whilst the Fantastic Four protect the crowd. The Human Torch pursues the object, discovering that it is a silver humanoid riding a surfboard-like object. He confronts this ""Silver Surfer,"" only to be dragged into the upper atmosphere. After his flame is extinguished, the Surfer sends Johnny plummeting back down to Earth. With barely seconds to spare he reactivates his powers and survives the fall. Reed's examination reveals that exposure to the Surfer has caused Johnny's molecular structure to flux, allowing him to switch powers with his teammates through physical contact. Tracing the cosmic energy of the Surfer, Reed discovers that a series of planets the alien had visited before Earth have all been destroyed.""

That speaks trouble in many volumes.

The opening sequence was reminiscent of, well, the 1986 ""Transformers"" animated movie, coupled with the ominous coming of a silver streak flying through space towards our solar system. The movie then traverses to the four main characters stuck in the Airport due to the usual Airport complications with their planes (or just their passenger seating). Sue fears that her and Reed's long awaited wedding will be once again, postponed, though Reed reassures her otherwise. The rest of movie from there is spent shifting between Reed's not-so-secret involvement with the Military (unbeknownst to Sue), to track the mysterious anomaly plaguing various areas of the earth --after initially turning them down to prepare for his wedding--, and well, the dysfunctional family aspect with a little dancing sequence thrown in for some laughs.

The acting is surprisingly better and more relaxed than in the first film; Ioan Gruffudd's Reed Richards isn't such a bloody pushover anymore, he actually behaves as though he functions with some sort of confidence in himself and backbone (for example see the 'Jock and Nerd' scene). Jessica Alba's Sue Storm is no longer the spiteful ex-girlfriend who mopes and complains about a past relationship and her beau's inability to see past his complex calculations. She's a more feminine, softer, kinder, character much closer to her Comic-Book carnation, characterization wise. There's even a convincing Brother/Sister relationship between Sue and Johnny, the chemistry's amazingly compelling. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis' performances as Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm improve also, especially when the two characters have a common gripe with their teammates. As promised Kerry Washington's Alicia Masters is also fleshed out into a more compelling character and Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom even makes a memorable comeback (with a better costume). Andre Braugher's role as the tough as nails, no-nonsense, thick-headed General Hager is of worthy note, though the character annoyed me greatly.

But the most enigmatic and compelling character of this film, is without a doubt, The Silver Surfer/Norrin Radd, portrayed by Doug Jones and voiced by the barely recognizable Laurence Fishburne. This duo, along with the CGI Masters of WETA, bring this character to life in such a way, I was not disappointed by him beyond his lack of an on-screen appearances until the end of the film. It's a silly thing to complain about, I know. The CGI and Action Sequences themselves were greatly improved upon, thus, blending in much better with the film and lacking the noticeable cartoonish styled look of the first film. Another much needed welcome was improved Score composed by John Ottman; I was never a fan of his work since X2: X-men United, Fantastic Four, and Superman Returns, but the score for ROTSS just might convince me that there's some merit behind his composing skills after all. It lacked the irritating and overabundant choir that always vibrated in the background in the first soundtrack, and reflected more upon the characters and their present situation rather than their 'fantastic' abilities. I seriously loved the tune used whenever Victor Van Doom was present. The Dialogue was better too. One last thing amongst the positives, I should really note, is the Fantasticar; I dreaded over this little thing ever since it's they gave the announcement that it would be in the film. I'm glad to say that I was very pleased with its overall appearance (squee!). As for Galactus? I wasn't disappointed in what I was given and hopefully no one else was either.

The only problems I had with this movie, was, its length (too short, but it gets its point across), and the fact that the makeup artists decided to slap a wig on Jessica Alba's head, reminiscent of Robin Wright Penn's 'Hippie Hair' from Forest Gump. The contact lenses used to make her eyes blue and the make-up job overall was also done without much respect to the actress in their attempt to make her look more like her comic-book character. Poor Alba truly looked falsified and unnatural. If it weren't for Alba's acting in this film, I would've found myself constantly distracted by these flaws. Gruffudd seemed to be suffering from a bad hair-day and a lack of sleep himself in most scenes. (Either that or his crows-feet are just more noticeable to me, the teenager suffering from a Gruffudd-crush.) I was not too thrilled with the performance of Beau Garrett as stoic Military-Minded Frankie Raye, Johnny's lukewarm love interest, but she wasn't terrible compared to other secondary love-interest characters (Eva Mendes or Jennifer Garner for instance) in comic book movies. Another thing that puzzled me, at first, the most was PG rating. I scratched my head over this deicision for days before finally letting it go. I suppose it isn't so violent that it warrents a PG-13 rating, though my brain says otherwise. Hey, whatever brings in more money.

But all in all, I enjoyed this movie very much and recommend it to anyone looking for a good comic book sequel movie, though I may be biased. --- [a 5 out of 5].",1184284800,,8291,5.083027185892726
1551387,3,B00005JNTU,"This movie was just o.k. Frankly, I don't think there's a whole lot to say, but this time around Sue and Reed are getting married, but they can't seem to get past the overwhelming amount of media hype. Of course, Johnny (the most self-indulgent of the four) doesn't really mind all the attention. For me, this movie is exactly the same as the first one with a few minor exceptions, but all in all there really isn't that much of a difference between these 2 movies in my opinion. Sue is still in love with Reed, Reed is still the very intelligent science freak, Johnny is still the pretty boy who enjoys hogging all the spotlight, he's still extremely selfish, and he still manages to make fun of Ben, Ben is still ""The Thing"", and who's most famous line is ""it's clobbering time"" which is not that impressive, and Von Doom is still interested in world domination (nothing new there). Also, they could've elaborated more on how Von Doom made his return. Don't get me wrong, I know the main focus is suppose to be the ""silver surfer"" but I still wished they would've showed us more about that. The silver surfer's story was a little interesting, and frankly, that's probably the only thing that saved this movie from being a total trainwreck.",1184025600,,1241,4.569506726457399
1551388,4,B00005JNTU,"Is Fantastic Four:  Rise of the Silver Surfer the best movie of the summer?  No.  Is it a fun comic book movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and a guilty pleasure?  Yes!

While FF may not be the best of the superhero genre (Spiderman, X-Men, Batman Begins are much better films), the Fantastic Four ham it up a bit while facing one of the darkest threats the earth has ever known.

The story starts with Sue Storm trying to marry Reed Richards, under the eyes of a relentless media.  Each time the nuptials have been interrupted by some crisis needing intervention by the Fantastic Four and unfortunately this time is no exception.  A strange phenomenon worldwide has caused strange pattern changes in the weather and we see that an alien force is behind the chaos.  Soon, we meet the Silver Surfer, an intergalatic messenger for a dark force, Galactus, that basically ""eats"" planets.  The team must fight to save the planet before it is completely consumed and destroyed.

There are a lot of improvements that can still be made should there be a Fantastic Four 3.  However, overall, I don't think this film was bad---it had some good special effects, humor and the return of the sinister Dr. Doom.  I think my favorite part of the film is when the Human Torch absorbs the power of all 4 and fights Doom---a pretty cool sequence.  And, I think the Silver Surfer was really well done.  Though I know absolutely nothing about this comic book character, I enjoyed his introduction into this franchise.

1551458,3,B00005JNTU,"This sequel to Fantastic Four was ok.  It wasn't anything like X2.  Of course, being a fan of Marvel comics, I never really was a fan of the Fantastic Four.

A planet at a nearby galaxy was destroyed.  It' is Silver Surfer's job, as a servant, to create craters in Earth.  I'm guessing it is to make it easier for his lord, Galactus, a planet-eater, to devour Earth.  With strange weather patterns, the Fantastic Four, in the midst of their wedding, battles the Silver Surfer.  Soon, they learn that the Silver Surfer is only doing his lord's bidding.  However, the Silver Surfer is conflicted once he sees Sue Storm, whom reminds him of his wife on his home planet.  With his guard's down, the Silver Surfer is caught by the military, along with Dr. Doom's hidden agenda.  Now, it's up to the Fantastic Four to save Earth from Galactus.

What really made me not like this movie was the cheesiness, especially the dialogues that Johnny Storm had.  I mean, I get it that Johnny Storm is supposed to be egoistical but he was just cheesy.  In addition, the blonde look on Jessica Alba/Sue Storm was just horrendous.  And I thought that the X-Men's Storm's white wig was bad.  Not anymore!

I just wish there was more action and special effects in regards to the Silver Surfer.  I loved the chase better the Human Torch and the Silver Surfer.  That was just really cool!  I also loved how Galactus was portrayed...to emphasis the greatness of his power.

I won't be surprised if there comes another FF movie.  I just hope that it'll be much better than this sequel.  Just please don't make it cheesy.",1183939200,,1596,4.565371024734982

1551466,4,B00005JNTU,"Of all the sequels we've been fed this summer, I have to admit that ""Fantastic Four:  Rise of the Silver Surfer"" best meets its expectations.  While other major sequels (""Spidey 3"" and ""Pirates 3"") take a decidedly darker tone, ""Surfer"" kicks up the fun a notch.  This should be expected since the previous film and the comic that it is based on is a lot more lighthearted and family-oriented than other films and books of this genre.  In ""Surfer,"" director Tim Story isn't tied down to an origin story.  He is given free reign of the action in the film and does not let anybody down.  All of the original core actors (Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis) have returned (including good ol' Doom, Julian McMahon).  The newest addition to this film is the Silver Surfer, the galactic herald of Galactus, a cloud-like being that consumes planets to stay alive.  I won't go into comic geek mode, but just know that Galactus is not a cloud in the comics.  I do think that the handling of the character in the film, however, is perfect.

When the Surfer arrives on Earth, an Army general (played wonderfully by the underappreciated Andre Braugher) demands that Reed Richards create a sensor to track him and find out what he's doing on Earth.  The only problem is that Richards is helping Sue Storm plan their oft-cancelled wedding, Ben Grimm is heating up his relationship with Alicia and Johnny Storm is trying to get sponsorships and girls.  It all leads up to the return of Victor Von Doom who gladly offers to assist the military in figuring out what the Surfer is all about.

From there, we are given a healthy dose of light comedy and action in the form of a bickering/normal family trying to battle an old foe and figure out if the new guy is a friend or foe.  The special effects, especially those involving the Surfer and Johnny, are wonderful.  The only effects miscue that I noticed was with Mr. Fantastic which, honestly, is passable due to the fast-paced and well plotted storyline.  Scientific terms fly all over this movie in a fun fashion.  Mr. Fantastic steps it up a notch and shows that his confidence is growing.  Ben and Johnny are still at each other's throats and Sue is just trying to prevent them from killing each other.  It's a fun family-oriented film for the most part.

**Spoiler**
However, there is one part in the film where Dr. Doom has his way with a few military men.  One of them is turned into ash.  This part of the film made me think that perhaps the MPAA should have edged this flick up to a PG-13 rating.  Other than that particular part of the film, everything else is fairly PG-oriented.  There's one brief implied nudity scene with Alba.  There's also a little bit of strong language but the characters who attract the most attention from kids, Thing and Torch, have very few curse words to throw around.  I'm just throwing this bit of info in for parents still pondering on whether or not to take their child to this film.  If they're under eight, you might want to preview this film before taking the kiddoes.
**End Spoilers**

Overall, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is the best sequel of the summer.  Is it better than the original film?  Only slightly.  Is it better than the first two ""Spider-man"" flicks?  Probably not, but this is sort of like comparing apples to oranges.  Just rest assured that by viewing ""Surfer,"" you'll be getting an action-packed, fairly family-friendly comic book flick.  The interaction between the fantastic foursome alone is worth the price of a movie ticket or, in a few months, a DVD.  Highly recommended, especially to families with children who love comics and action film fans.",1182988800,20,3678,4.658385093167702

Then in the end, everyone gets a valuable lesson in the benefits of working as a team.

Reed Richards (Iaon Gruffudd, TV's ""Horatio Hornblower"") and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are supposed to get married. They have spent a lot of time planning what will hopefully be Sue's dream wedding, but that is looking less and less likely; each of the previous wedding ceremonies has been canceled due to various emergencies. You know, they are superheroes and when duty calls... And now, the paparazzi are out in force to try to capture the nuptials. Sue's brother, Johnny (Chris Evans, ""Cellular"", the upcoming ""Sunshine"") and Ben (Michael Chiklis, TV's ""The Shield"") are in attendance, ready to give their friends and fellow super-heroes, a grand send-off. But a mysterious force appears and dries up a bay in Japan, causing General Hager (Andre Braugher, having difficulty finding roles worthy of his talent since TV's ""Homicide"") to approach Richards and ask him to build a detection device. They soon learn the force is from another world and going from one planet to the other, robbing it of life force and then moving on, just as the planet self-destructs. This force, who rides a silvery surfboard, prompting the Fantastic Four to name him the Silver Surfer (they're a bright bunch), has set his sights on Earth. Naturally, they can't let that happen. But they don't know what to do. Enter Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon, TV's ""Nip/ Tuck"") who wants in on the action. Will he be able to help the Fantastic Four?

I pretty much hated the original Fantastic Four"". In an era when ""Spiderman"" and ""Batman Begins"" can show how to make a superhero film right, ""Fantastic Four"" seems like a throwback to the bad superhero films of the 70s. Everything is too jokey, too commercial and too fast-paced.

Actually, that last complaint is a blessing in disguise. Each of the two films runs between 90 and 100 minutes. Given the time it takes to establish characters, both good and bad, the running time of these films is very brief. Everything seems rushed and the characters seem cartoonier because of it. We never have any time with the characters to build a real relationship, to watch them build any relationships of meaning. It makes the entire thing seem more than a little shallow.

See Reed.

See Reed in love with Sue.

See Sue in love with Reed.

But given the quality of these films, it is probably just as well that they don't make us sit through an attempt to create something more meaningful, something more interesting.

""Silver Surfer"" has all the same problems that ""Four"" had. Dr. Richards (Gruffudd) is the only one who seems to be an actual scientist. The rest of the group are merely worker bees or assistants. They aren't equals; yet, the film seems to want them to be equals, to use their superpowers as a team. Also, Richards is the only one who ever appears to be serious about his work. For instance, when General Haggard approaches him with the problem, he secretly tries to create the device they will need to help the government. As important as her wedding is, because Sue (Alba) is so concerned about this and only this, it makes her a bit stereotypical. At one point, she even says, ""I just want this wedding to be as I always dreamed it would be."" I expected her to continue on and say `Since I was a little girl' and then pull out her Barbie dolls. Sue is a superhero for goodness sake. Sure, she should have normal wants and desires, but `the perfect wedding'?

Ben ""The Thing"" Grimm (Chiklis) is still in love with his blind girlfriend, Alicia (Kerry Washington) and he still has to put up with Johnny's (Evans) dumb jokes about his size and their relationship. But that is basically the extent of this character.

At one point, Johnny returns to their headquarters holding a superhero outfit that more closely resembles a NASCAR driver's gear; the front and back are covered with endorsements. Johnny is all for it, he wants the endorsements, the fame, the public's adulation. But this is also what he wanted in ""Four"", so his character doesn't really develop.

After General Haggard enters the picture, Johnny makes goo-goo eyes at one of his assistants, a blonde woman who wants to have nothing to do with him. This is amusing for about half a second, but the same joke was played out in ""Four."" Johnny wants fame, he wants girls, and he wants attention. We get it. Is there nothing else we can learn about this character? Is there nothing else we can learn about any of these characters?

When the Silver Surfer first appears, Johnny chases him and tries to stop him. Their interaction causes Johnny to experience some changes; basically if he touches one of the other team members, their powers switch. This leads to an amusing moment, but when they do the joke again. And again. It starts to wear thin.

Another problem with both films is that two of the super heroes are only possible through the use of CGI. Yes, I know Batman and Spiderman are also greatly aided by CGI, but anytime Sue becomes Invisible Woman or Johnny becomes the Human Torch, they are completely animated. Worse yet, the Silver Surfer is never seen in a human form. Therefore, he is always computer generated. We can't feel empathetic for a computer creation. We have to have some link to the human side of these characters for us to feel for them, to make a connection. Because their superhero personas always look like a cartoon, it is difficult to care for them, or feel fear for them.

I don't know who made the decision, but whoever decided to cast Jessica Alba, as the Invisible Woman needs their head examined. Alba is one of the most beautiful women working in film today and you want her to play a character that is largely unseen? And Chris Evans as the Human Torch? Again, a good-looking guy, but anytime he is a superhero, he is covered with animated flames and fire. I did notice that in ""Silver Surfer"", they made more use of Invisible Woman's ability to create force fields, allowing Invisible Woman to stay visible. Also, ""Surfer"" seems to show Johnny in his superhero outfit on more occasions, before he becomes the Human Torch, allowing his fans the opportunity to see him in a skintight outfit.

When Johnny walks in with the NASCAR outfit, Reed and Sue look at him like he is crazy and the corporate sponsorship is dismissed. Yet, as Reed is attempting to build the tracking device, he wants to use a handheld phone unit, providing the filmmakers with many opportunities to show the company's logo. Later, Reed creates a floating car, unveiling it to the rest of the team. Imagine my surprise when I saw the Dodge logo on the front of the vehicle. Dodge helped build this floating car? Did they provide the money? This type of thing is so prevalent in today's films, but when they spend a lot of effort to show these elements, it crosses the line. Anyone who has seen ""Casino Royale"" can probably tell you which cell phone James Bond uses in the film, but it was a passing moment and it wasn't lingered on for so long.

All of this might be more acceptable if we had any idea of the origins or the purpose of the Silver Surfer. He wants to destroy planets by robbing them of their natural resources? Why? During the course of the film, the Surfer (voiced by Laurence Fishburne) provides an enigmatic reason, which only adds to the confusion.

This sequel is not worthy of your time or attention. Let's make sure they don't subject us to ""Fantastic Four: Dr. Doom and Silver Surfer Tie The Knot"". Don't spend your money on a ticket for this film. Don't do it.",1182729600,2,7507,4.653584905660377
1551529,3,B00005JNTU,"The Fantastic Four are back in FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER ...dude.

Slipping back into the latest comic-book-to-film wave, director Tony Scott (of the 2005&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four/dp/B000O77SPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four</a>&nbsp;feature) tries to shoot the tube by giving us another character from the original comics.

And the story goes...

Mr. Fantastic, aka Reed Richards/""Stretch"" (Ioan Gruffudd), and Sue Storm, aka The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba), are trying, once again, to get married. Interruptions have stifled all attempts at matrimonial bliss and this time it comes from another world. The Silver Dude (voiced by Laurence Fishburn,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akeelah-and-the-Bee/dp/B000G1R394/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akeelah and the Bee</a>) has ""surfed"" onto Earth to do his master's bidding (see Destroy Planet Plan 101). Breaking through the planet's mantle, The Silver Surfer prepares each planet he visits for the impending arrival of a cloud of ...um ...stuff known as Galactus (the comic book showed this as a giant robot but apparently Tony Scott refused to have any kind of giant robots in his films).

Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) stars as The Human Torch and the first of the fabulous squad to interrupt The Surfer's wild ride. Energy transfers between Silver-Boy and Torch cause fluctuations in Johnny Storm's abilities to light up. Anyone who touches Johnny, too, gets a touch of this transference and is quite funny when Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) trades powers with him for a few short moments.

Mr. Fantastic has to help the military find a way to disable The Silver Surf all while trying to prepare for his wedding. Time is short for both and when The Surfer shows up near Reed and Sue's hitching place, the waves come crashing down on their celebration (bummer, dude).

Racing to save the planet from The Surfer's seemingly incalculable powers, the military enlists --surprise, surprise!-- Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). You really didn't think he was gone permanently, did you? Victor's able mind and talents help bring Silver-Boy down but oh! you know that ol' Von Doom mind. He's got other plans for The Silver Surfer's powers.

Shortened by nearly 15 minutes from the first film, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer feels lessened in two significant ways. First is that there's almost zero explanation as to how the Silver Surfer became the creature he is. The ""love"" interest between what was Silver-Dude's woman far, far away doesn't explain much and leaves viewers caring little about him. The second is the rushed story focusing on booms! bangs! and gadgetry rather than the substance of the characters. The other issue some may have is that it ends with no resolution as to what happened to Von Doom or The Silver Surfer's all-powerful board (maybe he sent it out for a nice waxing).

Even so, this is a fun, quick watch. It has some hysterically comical moments (almost all of which are thanks to Chris Evans' plucky Human Torch).

Just don't expect much character and you might enjoy certain aspects.",1182729600,2,3201,5.5030549898167
1551530,5,B00005JNTU,"I just got back a few hours ago from watching FANTASTIC FOUR 2:  RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER. My nine-year-old and I are still buzzing about the movie.  Although purists will have problems with the presentation, I loved it as a longtime fan and my son loved it just because it was so darn cool.  He laughed at all the one-liners at about the same time his dad did.  Proving the boy is getting really quick-witted or I'm not as fast as I think I am.  I actually think we're meeting somewhere in the middle, probably at about age seven.

As everyone knows from the title, this movie introduces the Silver Surfer to the movie-going world for the first time. There have been previous incarnations of the character, including guest spots in cartoon series such as Spiderman and the Fantastic Four animated series. There was even a short-lived cartoon series about the Silver Surfer.

It's going to be interesting to see if the movie crowd reacts any differently to the character than the comics fans. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the character back in the 1960s in pretty much the same context as he was used in the movie. When they wrote a comic book series just about the Silver Surfer, it only lasted sixteen issues the first time. Fans loved the character of tormented Norrin Radd when he was exiled by Galactus to be bound to the earth, but it was just too much of a good thing.  They didn't pick up the monthly series.

There have been a couple of comics series runs since then, but even though the character fascination is there, the longevity for the fan base isn't. It's almost like people love stories about people reacting to the Silver Surfer's plight more than watching him deal with it himself.

Although the Silver Surfer's backstory was touched on in the movie, there's not a lot of detail. We know that he's in servitude to Galactus to save his own world and he gave up his love to do that. That was one of the main conceits of the comic book version, that idea of noble self-sacrifice. And the fact that, despite all the power cosmic he had, he could never go home again.

It will be interesting to see, if there is a Fantastic Four 3, if the Silver Surfer is mentioned again.

As for the movie, I feel it could've been ripped from the pages of one of those early comics written by Stan and drawn by Jack. The feel of family was ingrained in every scene. They argued, bickered, misunderstood, hoped for, and loved each other all the way through the movie.  In some ways the movie is very simple. There's no real surprise about how things are going to turn out. There's not supposed to be. This is the Fantastic Four. People who know the characters know what they're gonna get in this film, and it's delivered.

Ioan Gruffudd returns as Mr. Fantastic.  Jessica Alba is the Invisible Woman.  Chris Evans is the Human Torch.  And Michael Chiklis is the Thing.  Julian McMahon returns as Doctor Doom.

Maybe movie purists want deeper plots and characters, maybe the comics fans want an updated version of the team, but I love this version. These are the characters, more or less, that I grew up with. These are the characters, without the John Byrne dark side and without all the soap opera complications of splitting the team up and bringing in She-Hulk, etc., that I want my nine year old son to learn to love too.  Comics scribe Mark Waid's run on the comics series was one of the best to come along in years.  Waid really had a handle on the characters.

The whole idea of Reed and Susan trying to get married while watched by the world, invaded by the media, and dealing with their own shifting pecking order is great. Throw in the threat of a planet-devouring entity and you've got all the ingredients of a successful Fantastic Four movie.

The action sequences were utterly impressive. I believed in each and every one of their superpowers. In the last movie, Johnny Storm's Human Torch abilities blew me away.  But in this movie watching Mr. Fantastic in action was a treat whether it was a serious situation or a comic one. The director (Tim Story) and the scriptwriters (Don Payne and Mark frost) took advantage of Reed's super-stretching abilities for comic relief a lot as well. Watching Reed get loop-legged while thinking about getting married and smashed flat behind the Thing during a fight were absolutely hilarious.

The Silver Surfer, admittedly got short shrift regarding what his powers could truly do, but it was wild watching him sink through the surfboard and remain connected to it while upside down and flying at near full-speed. Movies and special effects have come a long way. Comic books used to be the only place you could go to see that kind of action, but now movies bring it all to the big screen. Of course, comic still beat them because of the monthly frequency they come out.

The shifting loyalties within the story played a big part in keeping me satisfied. There was never a dull moment. Something was always happening to someone somewhere. And despite how tense everything got, there was always a laugh to be had somewhere.

One of the really cool things about the movie is the full-size lobby display that comes with it. I took a picture of my son in front of it, which he thought was totally cool.  You're not going to get that in the DVD box! But we're anxiously awaiting the DVD release because we're ready to see the movie again.

The gang from the first movie are all back for a second go at things, and they seem more comfortable in their roles.  The Surfer is a cool looking character that is more than he seems, and the action is a little more impressive this time around.

What really ruined this film for me was the LAUGHABLE special effects. I can't recall the last time I saw a film with such poor special effects.

More character development, more story, a reference to the Puppet Master and that Herbie robot, but in the end, it felt as though they just Frankensteined this thing together from leftover parts. The scenes with Reed and Sue in the planetarium then again on the bridge being the exact same scene was the worst offender. And the part where Alicia gives Thing a spongebath just felt wrong on so many levels. There were a couple of interesting documentaries and the original version is thoughtfully included on this disc so for those who haven't bought it yet. All in all, worth watching just to see what could've been but it's no improvement over the original.",1182384000,,852,4.6866666666666665
1551534,4,B00005JNTU,"First off, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is much better than its predecessor, balancing the right blend of superhero daring-do with jabs at our celebrity-driven society as well as how resourceful we humans are when faced with impending doom...VICTOR, that is.

Secondly, the moviemakers understood the film's comic book origins and set out to make a respectful and honest adaptation, with some liberties naturally taken, of a decades old classic.

Thirdly, the cast is in on the joke and are perfectly cast unlike other Marvel-based films.

Maybe it's the casting of the other two Marvel franchises that have struck box office gold that makes ""The Fantastic Four"" movies a lot of fun. ""The X-Men"" trilogy has Academy Award winner Halle Berry, Tony winner Hugh Jackman, the knighted SIR Ian McKellan, and ""Captain Picard"" himself, Patrick Stewart among its cast. ""The Spiderman"" series boasts a former favorite of independent and classy films (Tobey Maguire), a Broadway legend (Rosemary Harris), an Academy Award winner (Cliff Robertson), an Oscar nominee (Thomas Hayden Church), other Broadway stars (Alfred Molina and Donna Murphy), and one of the best young actresses in Tinseltown (Kirstin Dunst).

While they may not possess the acting clout of the previously mentioned two series, Ioan Gruffund (Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards) Michael Chiklis (The Thing/Ben Grimm), Jessica Alba (The Invisible Woman/Sue Storm) and Chris Evans (The Human Torch/Johnny Storm) really rise to the occasion and jump into their respective roles with the proper panache and enthusiasm for playing larger than life comic heroes. Julian McMahon returns to spew villainy again as the self-serving Dr. Doom.

These actors have really grown into the characters since the first film and each brings his/her own unique qualities to their respective parts.

It must be noted that it is obvious that Alba and Evans were hired for more than their ""thespian"" skills. Both conveniently get to bare a little of their well-developed skin: Alba in an implied nude scene and Evans wrapped solely in a towel, emerging from a shower.

But, the movie is aimed for an audience of adolescents with their raging hormones.

As far as the remaining cast goes, this film, thankfully, made better use of Andre Braugher than did last year's ""Poseidon."" Even though he plays a pompous Army general, he has a fair amount of screen time and dialogue.

Laurence Fishburne does the James Earl Jones-Darth Vader-thing by supplying the voice of The Silver Surfer, while Doug Jones provides the body of the non-computer-generated version of ""Galactus's herald.""

The special effects are impressive, befitting their state-of-the-art status; only does Mr. Fantastic's ability to stretch come across as not quite as believable.

Because of the film's short running time (92 minutes), it doesn't take long for the action to start and there is much of it in the adventure.

It might not be the best film of the summer, but it is certainly one of the most entertaining...and one doesn't have to be a fan.

And it doesn't take itself as Shakespeare!",1182384000,,3086,5.172690763052209
1551535,5,B00005JNTU,"This movie is like a rocketship that you get on, and then you ride into space and the turbulence doesn't even effect you at all, and it's a very smooth landing either on whatever planet the rocketship lands or on its eventual re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.  Fantastic Four rules the school!

If you've ever seen other comic book movies like Batman or Spiderman or Darkman or Superman or X-Man, you know that they are usually not very good.  But the Fantastic Four are absolutely excellent and every superhero movie should take notes on how great this movie really is.

Fantastic Four is about four friends who have wonderful magical powers.  One guy is super-limber, and another guy can turn into fire, and another guy is really really strong, and there is a girl who can become invisible if she wants to.  Never before and never again have so many different and exciting superpowers been on display, and you will jump out of your chair cheering every time they get to defeat bad guys (which is often).  You may not even want to sit down because you'll be out of your chair that much.  However, if you want to get good exercise, then you will sit down from time to time, because then it will be very good for your quads.

The special effects are thrilling, the actors are dynamic, and the story is just like a rocketship.

I hope you stop reading this review right now and go rent this movie immediately.  And if you are still reading this sentence, why don't you go re-read the last sentence and ask yourself why you're so disobedient?

Be careful: the stretchy man and the fire man may come and get you!!!  Just kidding.

Do yourself and your community a favor and buy many copies of this movie.",1182297600,,1704,4.526143790849673
1551536,3,B00005JNTU,"As a child, I was a Fantastic Four fan for about three or four years.  Some of the best stories were in the first seven years or so in the life of this comic book, and so I caught just the tail end of all of that.  I gave up on the Fantastic Four as the stories got more repetitive and inane, and especially after Jack Kirby's art style mutated, increasingly portraying all of his characters with large square jaws and muscular shoulders, including the women.  This looked great on the guys, but made the women look like East German swimmers on steroids.  Another of Kirby's unfortunate changes in drawing styles was to give the women huge rinds of awful, unnatural looking hair.  Among its many advantages over DC comics, Marvel at that time had some truly gorgeous looking women in its stable (Crystal! Gwen Stacy!), and who can deny that this was one of the reasons that adolescent boys used to read comics?  The changes in Jack Kirby's artwork kind of ruined that aspect of Marvel comics for me.

And so, still on this topic of gorgeous looking women, Jessica Alba managed to really shine in the first Fantastic Four movie.  Imagine my surprise then when Jessica Alba shows up in the very first scene of this new movie looking like she has been sketched by Jack Kirby, with this thick rind of the most unnatural looking orange colored hair you can imagine.  This continued through much of the movie, with only a few scenes where she actually looked good. Her blue contacts were very dark blue this time - since real blue eyes are always light blue or grey blue, but never dark blue, this made her look more like a character out of the ""Dune"" novels - you know, the dark blue eyes of long term exposure to melange.

OK, so we know that Jessica Alba isn't a real blonde. We know she doesn't have real blue eyes.  We know that she's not a melange spice addict.  Somehow or another, though, whoever did her hair and make-up in the first Fantastic Four movie managed to get her blonde hair and blue eyes to come out just right, whereas in this movie, Jessica Alba looks AWFUL.  Somebody should consult the makers of the movie ""Legally Blonde"" about how different lighting and different hair colorings affect the look of blonde hair on people who aren't natural blondes.

As for the rest of the movie, yeah, it was OK.  The Silver Surfer character was very, very well done, the best part of this movie.  Turning Galactus from a giant humanoid god with a ridiculous looking helmet (sort of resembling a bishop's miter with wings/spikes sticking out from the sides) into a giant cloud was a good idea.

Dr. Doom redux was OK.  But, how the heck did he manage to bring in all of his Dr. Doom gear when he walks into the secure chamber with General Hagar to steal the Surfboard?

Whoever wrote the nonsensical dialogue between Reed Richards and Sue Storm should be fired.  Some of the sight gags with Mr. Fantastic getting crushed like Silly Putty (especially by Sue Storm) were quite funny.  The open cockpit jet that the Fantastic Four used was highly unrealistic - if the thing is traveling several hundred miles per hour, the wind speed on the faces of the occupants would have been enough to cause some serious deformation of their facial features.

All in all, a moderately entertaining movie, marred by an uglified Jessica Alba and some bad dialogue writing.",1182211200,18,3359,4.572621035058431

1551606,4,B00005JNTU,"I went to see this film with my 13 year old grandson.  I had very low expectations but was pleasantly surprised because this was a pretty good movie.  The villains were appropriately villainous and the heroes very heroic.  They destroy the bad guys and save the Earth and everyone has a pretty good time in the process.  The Nerdy Science guy is the heroic leader who gives a pretty good speech in support of education over team sports.  The heroine is beautiful even with what appears to be collogen enhanced lips.  This is a comic book brought to life so it has no strong plot or complexity but the whole thing is presented without any pretense of being heavy drama. The ""Torch"" offered good comedy relief with enough quips to keep the whole thing light and fun. I enjoyed it and so did my grandson.

Rise of the Silver Surfer rose to my expectations and then some.  It is exciting, dramatic, sad at times . . . but never, I say again, never does it take itself too seriously.  Johnny and Ben are still feuding, Reed and Sue just can't get married, the great Stan Lee himself has a cameo.  Like the first, there are those who will complain of the liberties taken with the Fantastic Four universe (what Galactus looks like, for example).  Personally, I thought this was an excellent adaption.  I can hardly wait for the next movie (maybe the Skrulls will show up?).",1182124800,,592,4.634615384615385
1551608,4,B00005JNTU,"""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a much better movie than the first attempt.  It benefits from better pacing and more action, and especially profits from a wise decision to delve into the realms of science fiction.  The special effects are excellent, and although liberties are taken with the original concept of ""Galactus"", the movie has a dark enough edge to keep you interested.

Some problems from the original still remain unresolved.  The director, Tim Story, seems unable to decide whether to treat Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) as a sex object, or as a feminist woman.  Alba seems to have mastered the art of uttering ""thank you!"" with conviction, but she still seems like a lightweight character, especially with so much focus on the gloss of her lips. Wasn't Sue Storm a scientist, too, in the comic book?

Then there's Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon).  Initial scenes seem to acknowledge the ravaged Doom's semblance to Darth Vader, and the character is more threatening for it.  But, then Doom is miraculously healed when the Surfer zaps him.  This seems to occur in order to give the handsome McMahon some face time, which is something the movie doesn't really need.  It also doesn't really need Dr. Doom on a surfboard.  For the most part, the slapstick is out of the way early in the movie, but at the climax when Doom was spinning around on the board, I heard some audience members laughing.

All in all, I think this movie does a lot to help make the FF credible.  It's enjoyable and interesting.  At the very least it isn't the overblown and convoluted mess that both X-Men 3 and Spiderman 3 turned out to be.  This franchise may be one that gets progressively better instead of progressively worse.  It's taken a step in the right direction, anyway.",1182124800,4,1774,4.748366013071895
1551609,4,B00005JNTU,"Reading all the critics' reviews I was thinking that this was a bomb worse than The Incredible Hulk.  I don't know what movie they were watching.  This movie was very enjoyable and fun.  The special effects are decent and the acting was just what it should be.  Jessica Alba never looked more gorgeous and they did an excellent job of portraying the Silver Surfer.

There are some hilarious parts - Stan Lee's cameo is priceless and also some of the scenes at Reed's bachelor party.  The Fantastic Four hover car was great and it had a few surprises that I can't remember from the comic book.

As the original story in the comic entailled The Watcher, it would have been overblown if he were present.  Galactus is nothing like the comic version and for all you comic fans, there was no ultimate nullifier copout in the movie.

Well worth seeing!",1182038400,2,845,4.58

Lots of things make it easy to like. It has humor, including a cameo by Stan Lee, longtime Marvel editor and driving force. It has some great effects, including rubbery Reed Richards and the flaming, flying Johnny Storm. Above all, it has Galactus - not the comic-book guy with funny hat, but a masterwork of computer-generated special effects. It has a bad guy, too, and it's not the Surfer. I guess the writers expected people to declare someone the bad guy, one way or another, so set up an easy target. Outside of that, don't expect much.

Jessica Alba is cute, her only apparent talent, and that will satisfy the thirteen year old boys. She keeps her clothes on, which will satisfy the mothers of those boys. Romance is chaste and violence is all ""Bam Pow,"" with no blood or consequences. Outside of the effects, there's not a lot here - but hey, it's a comic book movie, and a fair one at that.

1551613,4,B00005JNTU,"To be honest, I have never been an avid Marvel Comics reader (when I was growing up, it was Superman, the Flash, Green Lantern, and, hey, Jonah Hex was my all time favorite). Oh, I enjoyed Spider-Man and Daredevil, but, for some reason I just couldn't get into 'The Fantastic Four'. So a couple of years ago I went to see the film. Sure enough I started nodding asleep, and I think some of the audience were gazing at their watches. Sure, the film opened to its' obligatory huge opening like so many over-hyped blockbusters today (need I remind anyone of this summer), and then quickly dried up. For a movie to have 'legs', it needs to have more than just special effects and four characters dressed as comic book characters. The film needs to have a good story, snappy dialogue, and a few special effects to send the audience into another world (I remember watching the original 'Superman' with Christopher Reeve back in 1978 - snappy dialogue, a pretty good introduction to the Man of Steel, and a few special effects thrown in to make our jaws drop, and John Williams wonderful score - a perfect combination). 'The Fantastic Four' (just like Marvel's other mistake, 'The Hulk'), the story wasn't interesting, and nobody cared about any of the characters. Not really. Sure, Jessica Alba is pretty to look at, but her Sue Storm wasn't the comic heroine. Ioan Gruffudd was too square to play Reed Richards, who, in the comic book, is rather square, but not boringly square. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm: he's supposed to be the young hot shot. He had absolutely no charisma. And poor Michael Chiklis, stuck in all that make-up, doing his best to portray Ben Grimm, or 'The Thing'. Actually, he was the most watchable of the four. And the villain. Now, usually the villain should be the most interesting. Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom should have been menacing throughout. What a letdown. The original 'Fantastic Four' opened up as a letdown, and ended as a letdown. Some would say that the film was supposed to merely 'introduce' the audience to the characters. Well, luckily for Fox and Marvel Comics, they have somehow got it right (let's hope the folks making the next 'Hulk' with Edward Norton do it right). The director and writers seem to have thrown out the last film entirely (hoping we would forget it) and brought freshness to this Fantastic Four. They are the same actors, but the writers actually came up with snappy dialogue. Reed is square, but he is also kind of fun as he stretches his body every which way (anybody remember the DC character 'Elongated Man?'). Sue is more than just a pretty face. She is smart and heroic and sexy all at the same time. Johnny isn't just hot air. His scenes involving the Silver Surfer and Doom are exciting to watch. And Ben (the Thing) is colorful, sentimental, and always enjoyable. I think the filmmakers back at Fox and Marvel read what people had said about the first movie and paid more attention. I won't write too much about The Silver Surfer as it would give him away, but I will say that his character adds a great deal to the plot (well, he pretty much IS the plot) of the story. One last thing. I will expect them to bring out a third Fantastic Four after this (everything comes in trilogies now), and I will also expect it to be even better than this one. My hopes are high. By the way, how many out there in comic book land would love to see a movie made about 'Jonah Hex'?",1181952000,3,3440,4.558966074313409

I have to admit to being one of only a tiny handful of people who DIDN'T think ""The Fantastic Four"" was a terrible movie.  Frankly, even though I could tell that it wasn't a particularly GOOD movie, still I rather enjoyed its breezy unpretentiousness and lighthearted refusal to take itself too seriously.  However, I'm not really sure that this material was exactly crying out for further amplification, and, indeed, the inevitable sequel, ""Fantastic Four:  Rise of the Silver Surfer,"" is an only sporadically engaging entry in the ever-expanding and now preposterously overcrowded field of comic book superhero movies.

Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben return as the chemically-altered crime fighters, who in between battling evildoers and dodging celebrity-hunting paparazzi, are bent on living as normal a life as their phenomenal superpowers and the demands of their adoring, star struck public will allow.  Achieving such normalcy is easier said than done, however, for on the day when Reed and Sue are finally about to officially tie the knot and utter their ""I do`s,"" in on a celestial surfboard rides a silver-clad gentleman from the farthest reaches of outer space determined to wreak havoc on the planet.

The film may not have much going for it in the plot department, but that Silver Surfer is sure one gnarly dude, and the filmmakers have done a truly ""fantastic"" job bringing him to life on screen.  It's enough to make one wish they would change the quartet to a quintet for the next inevitable go-round.  Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba as Reed and Sue are once again reduced to playing ""straight men"" to Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis' Johnny and Ben, who, in true second-banana fashion, walk off with all the good lines in the film.  The humor is mainly of the schoolyard-banter variety, but there are a few zippy zingers sprinkled in amongst the predictable cluster of clunkers.  The same cannot be said for the ""serious"" dialogue, however, which often drips with maudlin sentimentality and homiletic self-importance.

Director Tim Story has filmed the flying scenes for maximum speed and effectiveness, and the locales have, for the most part, been well-chosen and well-photographed.  The special effects are seamless and even awe-inspiring on occasion, although the shots of Reed expanding his rubberized limbs to enormous lengths do look a bit fake at times.

If nothing else, it's at least a lot shorter than ""Spider-Man 3"" (barely over ninety minutes). Surely, that must count for something.",1181952000,2,2516,5.1048780487804875
1551675,4,B00005JNTU,"First things first, this movie is better than the original movie. The same cast is there, and they all do a wonderful job. However, it's the addition of the new mystery, the constant jokes, and the incredible animation that makes this movie top-notch.

FF: Rise of the Silver Surfer begins innocently enough. The world seems to be buzzing about the oncoming wedding between Sue Storm (Jessica Alba as an incredibly stunning Invisible Woman) and Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic). The two are still madly in love, and having pre-marriage jitters. Reed can't stop working on science long enough to devote his attention to the wedding, and Sue can't think of anything but the wedding. Meanwhile, Johnny Storm (Human Torch) and Ben Grimm (The Thing) continue to play the role of the two bickering children in the backseat. Then all hell breaks loose.

The world starts undergoing radical changes, as if some major climate or volcanic force were rapidly effecting the earth. Bodies of water freeze, others run dry, and massive football field-sized holes start popping up all over the planet. The US military wants Reed Richards to figure out what's going on, and in front of everyone he says that he won't do it; he's got a wedding on which to concentrate. Of course, he builds it anyway, and the cast comes to find out what the viewer already knows: it's the Silver Surfer causing all the havoc.

From there the plot loosely follows the original comic appearance of the Silver Surfer, where he is introduced as the Herald of Galactus, Destroyer of Worlds. He is on a mission to find planets for Galactus to consume, and Earth is the main course.

The FF, along with Victor Von Doom (who was revitalized after being affected by the presence of the Surfer), band together to fight the Surfer. Later, the FF must deal with a Dr. Doom who is still power hungry, and doesn't cooperate - who didn't see that coming? Oh, and they still have to figure out how to stop Galactus from destroying the planet.

Overall, if the viewer has no prior knowledge of the FF comics, or of the Silver Surfer, this movie comes off great. Between the witty dialogue, funny situations, tons of action, incredible CGI, and compelling story line, there's enough there to provide a good time for any viewer. It's hard to pick out a favorite part of the movie, but the cast and crew really did a wonderful job with the small gags here and there. There is a highly comical dance scene, as well as a power-switch routine that constantly provides humorous mooments. For an avid comic book reader, however, there are some problems/inaccuracies.

1) They made the Surfer's power derive from the surfboard. In fact, the Surfer yields the power; it was given to him by Galactus.
2) They made the Surfer far too weak at moments, when in the comics he is nearly invincible. He would not have reacted to a pathetic bolt of electricity from Dr. Doom, nor would he have dodged rocks flying into the movie's portrayal of Galactus. Speaking of which...
3) Galactus is a being, not some spooky, cellestial, rock-storm that places a cloud of debris around a planet and then sucks it dry.
4) There is no way that the Surfer could do battle with Galactus; after all, Galactus gave the Surfer his power.

Like I said, it's a good, if not great movie. I hope they continue the series and the genre. But a comic fan has quite a bit to nitpick if so desired.",1181952000,2,3399,4.664440734557596
1551676,4,B00005JNTU,"Now THIS is more like it, one of rare instances when a film sequel outshines the original in every way possible. Tim Story has finally given us a solid comic book adaptation that's worthy of repeated viewings. The first ""Fantastic Four"" film had its moments here and there, but let's face it: for the most part it was a disappointment. And here is what this sequel offers that the original did not:

-a more involving story
-a more interesting villain (with a nice and unexpected twist regarding who the real villain turns out to be)
-better, more convincing special effects
-more involving and more thrilling action/fight scenes
-a nice twist of events with the 4 heroes being able to swap superpowers
-the Fantastic Four actually *caring* about their powers, and as a result, finally letting we the audience care about them too
-less of the lame and juvenile humour (but still plenty of laughs to go along with the action)
-a better movie overall

I'm not saying that this film is perfect, and it's by no means the best superhero comic book adaptation out there. But when compared to the first film, and even when judged on its own merits, it delivers. More than enough reasons for me to give this one a thumb's up.",1181952000,3,1217,4.655813953488372
1551677,5,B00005JNTU,"I enjoyed the first one. I know there were problems with it. But it was an origin story and there were 5 characters to cover in very little time. I think the second improved on the first because it didn't have to waste any time with all that. By now you know who these people are and what they can do. My only problem with this movie is still Dr Doom who is really weak. I'm not going to soil any thing but...he's still lame. And the actor who plays him is pretty wussy too.

I wish they had left Doom completely out of the movie. He's really more of a distraction and doesn't serve much purpose other than being a minor headache to the F4's bigger problem which is...THE WORLD IS ABOUT TO BE EATEN!!! Which Doom doesn't even care about.

One more negative about this movie is Mr Fantastic dancing at his bachelor party. Wow...that was bad. The special effects here did not work at all.

But aside from that, everything else was fantastic. Dr. Doom, although still cheap, does get to do some really cool destruction. Johnny Storm is even cooler this time around and the Silver Surfer is pretty freaking awesome! Unlike Spider-Man 3, I didn't feel let down by this movie. Maybe because I didn't go into it with such high expectations.

The Fantastic Four isn't supposed to be some epic movie. It's more of some light hearted comic book fun. And it succeeds in doing that.

1551678,4,B00005JNTU,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer isn't going to get the credit it deserves from critics for being the best comic sequel since X-Men 2 or Spiderman 2. Infact it has received some bashing already. But I think that's unfair since this is a really entertaining film with better action and effects than the last film. Sure it's not actually....fantastic but it's still a sequel that isn't a let down. The Silver Surfer is done as good as the trailers have hinted. He looks great and is done well even if we don't get a complete back story of him.

  There's a lot of improvements from the last film. The film has it's goofiness but it's not 90% goofy like the first film. It spends less time with reporters and fans following the Fantastic Four around saying stuff like ""woo hoo, it's Johny Storm!"". Even when the film has those scenes they are less annoying. Hell Tim Story's direction has improved so much that it didn't even seem like him behind the camera this time around. I mean I liked the last film but I still wanted the sequels to be done by someone else. After part 1 and Taxi Tim Story just proved that he should just be doing Scooby Doo sequels instead of comic book movies. His direction and the better script are big improvements however.

  Plus the actors, even if they don't give oscar worthy performances here, they still have better chemestry this time around as well. Also when Jessica Alba trys to reach the Silver Surfer, she sorta convinced me that she can act. I even like how Invisable Girl has learned new ways to use her powers and how she brags about it. Everyone has a better idea of what their character should be like this time around. Chris Evans even has improved a bit so if the film gets bashed as bad as the first film it's really not fair. It deserves a lot of credit for trying to be better than the original and succeeding 100%.",1181865600,3,1872,4.4273255813953485

1551680,3,B00005JNTU,"Like most fans of the Fantastic Four,I went to see this new installment with lowered expectations. The Silver Surfer making his big screen debut had me intrigued and ready for redemption for the first film! Don't get me wrong the first movie was pretty good, but certainly could have been better. What fans must remember is that the Fantastic Four and Spider-man are two completely different comic books. I think trying to make a FF movie too serious would be near impossible. The comic always had a funny side to it and I think the movie got that part right. If I have any problem with this movie is that there wasn't much action. I don't remember the Thing throwing one punch!? If he did it happened too fast to notice. I think we get to see him use his super strength once. The Human Torch gets most of the action and that is the where the problems begin. Why doesn't The Thing have the Yancy Street Gang(or some revised version of them)harassing him? This film needs some pathos and none of the characters are taken seriously. Lets face it, the Thing's story is kind of sad and deserves to have a good portion of the story centering around him and his struggle with this deformity. When he and Mr. Fantastic are crushed by a wall hurled at them, the out come is comical with a cartoon flattened Richards behind Ben Grimm going ""hoo boy that hurt""!? This works sometimes in the movie,but it makes it hard to believe these characters are ever in any real danger. With so many main characters in this film, it is tough to really give each one them the time needed to develop. Another problem is that the FF really don't go around fighting plain old thugs. With Spider-man he fights regular criminals and super villains, spinning his web and capturing them without harm. What regular crook could stand up to being man handled by the Thing or getting toasted by the Human Torch? So this is one of the reasons this is such a hard movie to pull off. They need to set up and explain every villain they're going to meet and that takes time on screen. This leaves very little time for anything else. I did enjoy this movie and there are some intentional laugh out loud moments through out. The Surfer was done well,but Galactus....well I guess a space giant with a purple helmet floating around eating planets would look silly! The movie was certainly worth my money and I will buy it when it comes out on DVD. I would give this movie 3 1/2 stars if I could. It just didn't have enough serious moments. A better mix of pathos,comedy,drama and action could make the next installment the best!",1181865600,3,2585,4.490445859872612
1551681,3,B00005JNTU,"I had some pretty low expectations for FF2. I have been a long time comic book fan and Silver Surfer is high on my list of favorites. I own every comic from the SS series, and many of his appearances from FF (even from the 60's). I know all the stories backwards and forwards.

I would like to point out that I have the potential to be a fanboy that will moan and complain and not have a balanced view. After so many adaptations of comics into movies, I don't expect for any movie to get it ""right."" I really wanted to see SS on screen despite the revised story I would be seeing. I will point out digressions from the comic story in the movie, but these comments will did not stop my enjoyment of the film and won't be the focus of my review.

In FF2, the effects are more polished than last movie, and pretty impressive all and all. SS could have done more, since he has god-like power, but that's fine. Galactus is interesting, but of course disappointing. My friend said he saw a face inside the storm, but I'm sceptical. Dr. Doom does hit a higher point in this movie, but not the greatness of his character in the comic book.

Sure, the acting falls flat like many comic book movies. I am looking at Jessica Alba in particular and Dr. Doom(I don't really care who played him because I don't care for his acting!) But at least the Fanstastic Four team itself has a little more chemistry and their bickering is not only fun but it adds something to the plot this time. The story is simple and that's a strong suit especially to people who aren't comic scholars.

SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:

Mr. Fanstastic and Invisible Woman are trying to get married and keep getting interrupted. Invisible Woman has a hard time dealing with feeling like a combination freak/celebrity and wants a normal life. Around the world atmospheric conditions are changing, and even natural formations (especially water in an impressive way) are changing from bizarre cosmic energy. The Army wants Mr. Fantastic to investigate/track the anomally. This energy is similar to the kind that transformed the hero's and doom. Meanwhile, we see that Doom is alive and well.

SS comes to NY and the Human Torch approaches him. SS flies at amazing speeds and has incredible energy output. His virtually indistructuble and can absorb energy as well. SS almost kills him. This contact with SS has an affect of Torch. Like the landscape, Torch's molecules are now affected. If he touches a team member he will swap powers with them. This is a great plot device and while it isn't in the comic book cannon of stories, it is possible. SS does have power over molecules.

Dr. Doom approaches SS and they have brief fight. This fight shows later in the movie that SS's power is tied to his board. Now this is a little stretch from the comics, but not terrible.

Mr. Fantastic finds a pattern in the SS's travels and comes to the conclusion, based on other planets that are destroyed in nearby galaxies, that the earth will be destroyed as well and SS must be stopped.

Dr. Doom and Mr. Fantastic are enlisted by the army to handle SS. SS and Invisible Woman talk for a bit and make a connection that will be important to the story. SS seems wooden, but his emotions is well hidden, due in part to his outsider status and the duties he has to perform. (destroying planets is not easy, he deals with it through detaching himself from his emotions)

Dr. Doom and Mr. Fantastic create a device to separate SS from his board and now he his pretty weak and is captured by the army and taken to an army base.

The army sides with Doom, the FF is imprisoned and SS is tortured/ questioned. Doom gets access to the board and reeks havoc. The FF find out that SS is just the servant to a greater power and his board will draw the devourer, like beacon. SS serves his master because he wanted to save his own planet.

The FF handled Dr. Doom even with super powers, but I won't say how if you haven't guessed. SS plays savior again at the end of this story, but I won't say how. This plot element is also a huge liberty on the storyline, but it allows for a satifactory ending.

END SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was surprised that this movie was pulled off in a way that would appeal to the general populace and the story wasn't terrible. As a fan, if you accept the altering of mythology, than you will enjoy it. Movies are a little like different comic stories. Each writer make his own rules. The way that powers works is less important to me than the characters themself. If I can view the film objectively for the movie that it is (with my interest in the SS) than anyone can.

FF2 has visuals, decent stories, not a lot of character development, but better inteactions between characters. This is the FF we know and love from the pages of the comic. The only let down is Galactus, but the vision as him as a giant is hard/expensive to translate and might not work for everyone. FF2 is a lot of fun and if you can watch Spider-man 3 or X-men 3 and not grimace too much, you should be able to handle this movie. Much better than the first film, adds a lot to the story. If you haven't seen the first FF movie, you aren't missing much and don't need to see it. If you want to compare the two then see it, but don't let it discourage your viewing of FF2.

If you like the story read the comics sometime. SS's story on earth is reprinted often (just don't read the ultimates! read the real thing)SS is a great dramatic character. (but wait until after you see the film) They portray SS well in the film, but don't get to explore his character fully in only 90 minutes. I don't have a problem with long movies, but a short, contained film is nice treat sometimes.

FF2 is a great popcorn flick: turn of the cynical part of your mind, be a kid again and let this feed your imagination. Comic movies don't have to be serious or gritty to be enjoyable.",1181865600,5,5959,4.462316176470588
1551682,4,B00005JNTU,"Warning- SPOILERS contained--

Fantastic Four:  in the summer of 2005, Marvel Comics ""first family"" superhero team hit the silver screen, and despite mixed reviews (leaning toward the negative) it had a sizably profitable run at the box-office.  Just before its 2007 sequel, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" hits theaters, Fox Home Video has released a two-disc Extended Edition of the first film.  With a running time of approximately 110 minutes, previously excised footage has been spliced into the previous cut, effectively expanding the narrative.
 The film focuses on four astronaut protagonists:  brilliant (but absent-minded) physicist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd); the beautiful (and also brilliant) Susan Storm (Jessica Alba); Reed's former college roommate and Air Force pilot Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis); and Susan's younger, sarcastic pilot brother Johnny (Chris Evans).  As the movie opens, Richards has a proposition for an outer-space-based research project (something involving cosmic radiation's effect on living tissue), but so far all his pitches have been turned down.  His only remaining prospect is with Von Doom Industries, run by his former college rival, Victor Von Doom (who, aside from being a business magnate is something of a physicist himself).  Von Doom has a rep for being ethically dubious, but Reed's colleagues convince him it's worth a try.  Surprisingly, Victor accepts Reed's proposal--but only if he gets to go along for the space trip, and his company gets the patents for whatever useful gets discovered.
 In true comic book fashion, as the experiment begins to take place, something goes terribly wrong.  A literal storm of cosmic radiation comes bearing down on the quintet, and though in the aftermath, nothing seems to be wrong with them at first, fans of the comics will know that a metamorphosis is about to take place.  After setting down on terra firma, each member of the group begins to change in seemingly random ways:  the brainy Reed is now enabled to stretch and bend his body like rubber (Mr. Fantastic); the impulsive Johnny can set his body on fire with no ill-effect (the Human Torch); shy Susan turns invisible when she gets frustrated (Invisible Woman); burly Ben finds himself changed into a man of stone (the Thing).
 For his part, the calculating Victor finds his body slowly being infected with a `techno-organic' virus, effectively changing him to a cyborg, with energy-manipulating powers.  While all parties are duly alarmed at this change of fortune, Reed reluctantly galvanizes his quartet as celebrity superheroes; but Victor broods and casually commits murder in the name of finding a cure for his condition.  This sets in motion a series of events leading to the climax, in which Reed creates a device that can cure the morose Ben of his powers, but Doom sets his sights on using it to basically destroy the team.

Pros:
The actors all bear a good resemblance to their comic book counterparts, with the possible exception of Chiklis' Thing, who in the comics has oversized proportions comparable to the Incredible Hulk.  Here the Thing is much more human-sized, though the film does an impressive job with the makeup to simulate his rocky exterior.  The powers of all the characters are handled well with respect to their four-color origins (Mr. Fantastic can squeeze under doors; the Torch can fly; Invisible Woman can create force-fields; the Thing can uproot street lamps with ease).  The bickering-family interaction featured in the comics gets to be seen often as well.  The comic strip's co-creator Stan Lee cameos as a letter carrier.  The extended cut provides welcome character moments involving all of the primary characters; they include a dinner date with Susan and Victor, Ben having a night on the town with Alicia, and Johnny flaming out while showing off at a nightclub.

Cons:
The film is essentially an extended origin story.  Arguably the biggest plot hurdle to overcome in super-hero films, some of the genre have used abbreviated origins or simply bypassed them entirely, with varying results.  Here, the full origin tale barely works, if only because of the engaging actors, the capable special effects and stunt sequences.  McMahon as Dr. Doom is suitably creepy, but his motivations as a villain are given the short-shrift (comics purists reviled the updated origin, though in fairness it hewed close to the strip's sister publication Ultimate Fantastic Four).  The Internet-heavy complaints about the casting of African-American Kerry Washington in a bit role as the Thing's future girlfriend (and to an extent the multiethnic Alba's casting as WASP-ish Susan) can be chalked up to racial nitpicking.

Extras
The three main documentaries are about the making of the film, about the history of the comic book, and about the career of Jack Kirby are very good additions.  Each of them is substantial in length.  The movie documentary interviews each core cast member as well as select members of the production crew, giving excellent insight on how the film was made.  The comic book documentary offers a decade-by-decade examination of the history of the Fantastic Four comics, interviewing various artists, writers and editors who worked on the series over the years.  It suffers from no interview footage of the late Jack Kirby--and strangely, there are no interviews with 1980's writer/artist John Byrne, whose work is only acknowledged with a dialogue-less montage.  Similarly, the Kirby bio has no archival interviews with `the King'.  The extras also include still photos and production drawings.",1181779200,,5597,5.215642458100558
1551750,4,B00005JNTU,"The pleasant yet undeniably featherweight souffle that was 2005's ""Fantastic Four"" is now, in this extended cut, a pleasant featherweight souffle with perhaps a tad more richness in the batter.  Fans will likely enjoy the extra bit of heft in the proceedings, but will also probably notice that the extra scenes aren't particularly indispensible or brilliant or make the movie a whole lot better.  They're just interesting and fun to see.

Technically, this new cut looks and plays fine.  If seamless branching is employed to add the extra scenes when the extended cut option is selected (both the theatrical cut and the extended cut are offered here), the result is indeed seamless.  I experienced no pauses or other ""bumps"" when watching the extended cut; it played like a regular movie.  And I hardly have state-of-the-art equipment.

But while the new extended cut of the film offers good entertainment value, disc two is the real keeper here.  If the producers annoyed many FF fans by changing a lot of the team's established mythology for the film, it looks like they're trying to win back their love by including extremely generous features about the comic book and its creative forces on the bonus disc.  The extra features are a treasure trove of behind-the-scenes lore about the FF comic book, and alone justify the price of the DVD.",1181606400,5,1343,4.933333333333334

What I will tell you is that the Blu-ray version rocks! The picture is great - so clear you feel like you are right there and the sound is clean, defined, and will shake the foundation of your house on the exciting parts if you crank it up.

Don't even bother with the DVD version, you'll feel like your watching the flick with blur goggles on. Go with Blu-ray and experience the movie the way it was meant to be seen!",1181520000,,567,4.099099099099099
1551752,4,B00005JNTU,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I got it used through [...].  Some comic turned movies, or cartoon turned movies are not that great.  This is well worth the money.  Plus, it has Jessica Alba in it!",1181433600,,208,4.394736842105263
1551753,5,B00005JNTU,"Always wondered how they claimed that they added 20 minutes back into the movie with an original runtime of 106 minutes and only came up with 111 minutes?

Well, wonder no more...the actual runtime is 126 mintues...well, 125:59, so indeed there are 20 minutes of new material.

So what is all this new footage of?  Well, mainly character development moments.  Usually I'm not a big fan of non-action character development moments, but in this case, they worked pretty well.  They helped flesh out the characters' lives better with their transition to being ""superheros"".  Some ""finding themselves"" moments really.  Basically the ""should I go out on my own and be a media superstar"" or ""shall I stay part of the team"" type questions, at least for Johnny Storm.  With Ben Grimm it's more of a ""do I want to get back to normal to deal with regular life wants (like girlfriends)?"" or ""do I stay a rock creature and carry out 'clobberin' times'?""  With Reed and Sue, it's relationship stuff.  There's even more Victor von Doom moments, which are also cool.

In any case, like I said, the extended cut really doesn't add much action back into the film, but the new character moments do help the film breath a bit more, which was the main flaw of the original theatrical cut.

I haven't looked at the second disc yet, but from what I gather just it alone makes this release worth getting.  Also, there's a director's commentary for the film too, so that's always a plus, even though I tend to never listen to them.

So if you liked the original theatrical cut enough, and wouldn't mind seeing more stuff that fleshed out the movie a bit more, and are anticipating the sequel, then don't hesitate and pick up this 2-disc extended cut.",1181347200,5,1726,4.653465346534653
1551754,4,B00005JNTU,"This is an extended e-mail that I sent to a friend who was considering purchasing the DVD...

When the movie was released a couple of years ago, I went to go see it on opening weekend. Despite the film's weak plot and misinterpretations of the characters that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created so long ago, it was fun and action-packed.

I bought the DVD when it was released, and later found an earlier draft of the script online.

When I heard that it was getting an extended cut (after being surprised by finding&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-2-1/dp/B000MTFDBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 2.1</a>&nbsp;at a local Wal-Mart), I considered buying it, and eventually did.

I haven't watched the movie with the deleted scenes back in, but I did see the new scenes on the ""Deleted/Extended Scenes"" special feature.

The disc has both the original theatrical version (as released in the US, it says) and the extended version. Judging from disc space required, how they pulled it off (no double-sided disc), is that the only full cut of the movie that is really on there is the theatrical version. When you play the extended version, it will automatically jump in between the movie and the deleted scenes. This is fine, except sometimes the music gets messed up (though I didn't note any problems here) and, on some, you can't use subtitles, which doesn't help when you can't have surround sound so as not to offend the neighbors. Also, the branching causes a three-second pause each time it jumps inbetween the two bits of footage on the player I use, and will likely do so on some other players, too.

One problem is is that it looks they put back ALL of the deleted scenes! Cool? Yes, except for that scene where Sue makes Reed take a break and they go to a bridge? In an earlier version of the script, it was going to be in a planetarium, and this scene is put into the movie... HOWEVER, so is another scene that is an alternate version of the bridge scene, where instead of elongating his chin when he says, ""I figured that's what you always wanted... a stronger man,"" he does a weird morph into Wolverine! (Both of these were among the few deleted scenes on the DVD's original release.)

I was glad to see more footage building the characters of Ben and Johnny after they get their powers. (These scenes were in the earlier draft of the script that I read.) I especially like the scene in Alicia's sculptor's shop where Ben notices the puppets and asks about them. She tells him they were made by her step father. In the comics (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/44-Years-of-the-Fantastic-Four-Collector-s-Edition-Win-Mac-DVD/dp/B000EDGO2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">44 Years of the Fantastic Four Collector's Edition Win/Mac [DVD</a>]), Alicia's father is the Puppet Master. However, considering that the movies are having the Fantastic Four battle cosmic-powered beings, I'm not expecting him to pop up soon.

The extended cut, I guess, is an overall improvement over the theatrical version.

Other than audio commentaries, only one of which is available for the extended version, the first disc only has an ""Inside Look"" feature about the sequel, which also contains the teaser trailer, instead of the full trailer.

Disc 2 has three documentaries about the comics. (Woot!) Except for ""From Comic Book to Film,"" they are all interesting. ""From Comic Book to
Film"" only shows panels from the comics matched up to clips from the movie, which sometimes only barely resemble each other.

""The World's Greatest Comic Magazine"" is an informative documentary about the comic book series, covering the creation and how the series has progressed over the years.

There is also a documentary about Jack Kirby, the original ""Fantastic Four"" artist, that seems to be well-researched and documented, but I haven't finished watching it.

There are stills and galleries, and two features about the movie, one of which I'd seen before and already had on DVD: ""Heroes are Born: The Making of...,"" Wal-Mart sold it as an exclusive special disc in a two-pack with the original DVD.

""Heroes Are Born"" is not an extreme in-depth documentary. Rather, it covers the leading five actors and the special effects used to create their characters.

""The Baxter Building: Declassified"" doesn't let you know very much. It practically tells you what the Baxter Building is and some of it's design for the film.

If you, to some extent, liked the movie, you should like the extended edition.

And, since I'm reviewing a Fantastic Four product, allow me to reccomend the alternate dramatic Fantastic Four series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four-The-Complete-Animated-Series/dp/B0007US7CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four - The Complete Animated Series</a>&nbsp;from 1994. For some reason, people say these '90s animated series got the characters better than the new movies.

There was also a 1994 ashcan film, and a 1960s cartoon series, but these are not officially on DVD.

This extended DVD is worth the buy, especially as it has a $8.50 gift certificate for a ticket to see the sequel, coming out exactly one week from now!",1181260800,4,5266,5.2850299401197605

The theatrical cut is a good movie but the added footage makes it great. I usually get extended cuts no matter how much is extended. Sometimes you'd be surprised what 8 or so minutes does to a movie. Most of the added footage is great there is only one that seems out of place and a little redundant but it is a good scene. I won't reveal a spoiler but I'll just say it's right before the scene with Sue and Reed.

1551756,3,B00005JNTU,"Okay, the title of the review is deceptive,  My usual bugaboo of rereleasing yet another DVD version of a film already out solely to cash in on it, or its sequel.  Now that that's out of the way....

""Fantastic Four"" was better than what the critics gave it credit for.  That is to say that it wasn't criticized justly.  I grew up on the comics of the Marvel Universe, and I know that certain adjustments have to be made in order to adapt it to the big screen (like any other transferred media), but it was an enjoyable watch.  We got the heart of the story and the heart of the team justly played by great actors (I've always been a HUGE Ioin Griffudd fan).  The special effects were done on the relatively cheap side, yet they were good enough to not be snickered at.  I especially loved the Human Torch.  Even good ol' Ben, the ever-lovin', blue-eyed Thing, came off believable, and comic-origin friendly.  After all, Jack Kirby didn't make him ""classic"" until much later.  Until that time, he was as lumpy as he was here.  By the way, it was a marvelous (sorry) casting choice in giving Ben to Michael Chiklis.  Be's been such a great heavy in ""The Sheild"" that everyone's forgotten how gruff-but-good he can be (doesn anyone but me remember ""The Commish?"").

Where it was week?  I dunno, maybe this is where I'm too much a stickler for comics continuity, but while Doctor doom was well-played by the deliciously slippery Julian McMahon (see him also in ""Nip/Tuck), would it have KILLED the director to give him a believable Mittel-Eurropean accent?  He was as egomaniacal as in the comic book, and wonderfully smarmy for the 21st century, but it would've been great to see him address himself (like the real-life Donald Trump) in the third person (""blast it!  Every time Doom is in the can!"").

Overall, not great when measured with the new classics of the cinematic comic book era, but ""Fantastic Four"" is a great old-fashioned fun time-killer.  Let's hope they do better with ""Rise of the Silver Surfer.""",1180051200,5,2011,4.629943502824859
1551757,5,B00005JNTU,"Listen, I'm not a die-hard fan of 'The Four' like everyone who thought this film sucked. I do know enough about the origins to expect the film to be relatable to the source material, which I thought it was.  ""How dare!"" those who are reading this are saying but hear me out:  A film will always be at a disadvantage to a book, comic or otherwise.  To tell the complex origins of 'The Four' and Doom accurately, would take the entire running time of your average film.  Then, you would have to go into the rest of the movie.  So we're talking what, 3 to 4 hour flick?  Only hardcore fans can sit through a film for that long and frankly, there isn't enough of them to make up the costs of such a movie.

With all of that said, I feel that the 'movie-fied' storyline worked well.  It kept the characters true to the source material which for me is the most important.  Chris Evans is Johnny Storm.  He was funny as hell.  Michael Chiklis doesn't make the line ""It's Clobberin' Time"" so corny as I always thought it was.  Ioan Gruffudd I felt didn't look the part due to his height but he acted the part so I was sold.  Jessica Alba, well even if she would have pulled a Halle Berry and not researched the part and winged Sue Storm I would have liked her.  When she donned those midnight-blue tights for the first time (ahem!),it was bananas.  Her acting was on point regardless of how hot she looked.  Which leaves my boy Julian McMahon as Victor Von DOOM.  Truthfully I like, mello controlled and smooth villians over the maniacal evil genius types.  I mean when he says to Sue ""Call Me Doom"", you could feel the cocky arrogance behind it.  Worked for me but apparently not for everyone else.  So we'll see how he does when the Silver Surfer comes to town.

I bought the movie, without having seen in in the theater (bad word-of-mouth, you know), and I enjoyed it.  But it wasn't anywhere near as good as other Marvel superhero films like the Spider-man or X-Men series.

So what do you get with this new vesion?  Twenty extra minutes of footage edited back into the film.  And it's mostly minor stuff, but most of the scenes do help develop the characters further.  [Spoilers Ahead] An extended scene between Susan Storm and Victor Von Doom is among the best, as it helps to further define Victor's feelings of jealousy toward Reed Richards.  And for longtime fans, there's a subtle cameo from the FIFTH member of the Fantastic Four (from the somewhat lamentable 80's cartoon series).  And if you haven't already heard about the Wolverine gag...well, that one could have stayed on the cutting room floor.

The film is about a team that goes into space to study a unique phenomenon which, in turn, alters their dna and they get special powers.  And the Fantastic Four are born.  Jessica Alba is gorgeous but Flame and Thing/Rock really spice the film up.

The film is not really true to the comic book but it does not really matter as it is entertaining provided that you watch it in a relaxed mood.  There are some flows and the romance outcome is predictable but you will enjoy it. Moreover it sets it self up for more sequels and hopefully they will be as good.

1551832,5,B00005JNTU,"Usually, I'm ""Mr. Instant Gratification"", buying a DVD of the movies that I like asap. BUT, I've come to anticipate that these studios love to make you buy the disks over and over. Well, I usually get the first version and ignore the rest. Spider-man 2.1? Sorry, not getting my money a second time for a few extra minutes.

  But F.F. 1? That's a special case. Fearing that people might think that they're ripping off the Incredibles, they cut some footage out of the Fantastic Four. Unfortunate, considering the F.F. predate the Incredibles by over four decades. Be that as it may, I've waited two years for this extra material, including the Kirby doc, etc.

  This movie was very good and they treated the characters of the F.F. very true to form. the only problem lies with those of us comic fans who know so much about the F.F., that we have trouble accepting the changes in Doc Doom for one thing. The fans get ticked about the total change in Doom's origin and powers. The non-fans don't care and enjoyed him. Tells you something, doesn't it? The hardcore fans usually don't like Sue here because she's not portrayed as the professional hostage or the soccer mom as she is now in the comics. As usual, some of these folks have to open up their mind a bit. This is a younger, single Sue and Alba does a great job. They all do. In fact, I don't think I've ever enjoyed Johnny Storm as much in any incarnation as I did in this film. The interplay between him and Ben is excellent.

  Speaking of Ben, there's also been a lot of complaints about Ben's 'lack of rockiness'. Well, again, this is in the beginning of their careers when Ben WASn'T as rocky. In the trailer for the second film, they've actually made him rockier and he looks even better. As a die hard F.F. fan for the last 30+ years, I initially had to get around some elements that conflicted with the comic book past as well but I did and after seeing it with more of an open mind on HBO awhile back, I enjoyed Doom a lot more, letting this version stand on it's own merits. Once again, they chan ged his origin so he didn't seem like Darth Vader--a man in a suit of armor--while in reality, Lucas (biggest hack of them all) based Vader on Doom in the first place. Not that any star Wars fan would accept that.

  In any case, can't recommend this movie highly enough and especially can't wait for F.F. 2.",1174608000,42,2373,4.380410022779043

I don't think this movie succeeded, unless you count a shot of Jessica Alba in her underwear, or Chris Evans running about for a few minutes with a jacket wrapped around his privates original.

This is an ""introductory"" movie, and in that the superheroes need to change from ordinary people to ""super people"", and we need to see some of the angst that goes along with it. That takes time and grace. The problem here is that there were five people who were changed (including the villain), so that's five psyches that we need to get into. We're only allowed entry into one: Ben Grim. And the only reason he's upset is because he looks like, well, a ""thing"".

We do get a glimpse at Johnny Storm, The Human Torch. He's deeeee-lighted by the changes, and a bit too happy-go-lucky.

I was impressed by some of the minute attention to detail. In the comic strip, Dr. Doom is scarred by Mephisto's touch, and in his incredible vanity dons a mask to hide his scarred visage. We don't meet Mephisto here, but Doom is scarred, and he does pick up a mask to hide it.

However, anyone who knows the FF comic series knows that they are not grand-scale moral/ethical pieces like the aforementioned titles; FF is just good clean sci-fi fun. The script kept in line with the modern comic scripts, maintaining each character's basic vernacular. The group's dynamics were emphasized well and weren't overdone.

After the wonderful treatment they did with Spiderman, I thought this has got to be great!...right?... Wrong! Let me start off by saying I did like this movie, but it could have been better. After seeing the film, I went home and dug out an old FF comic and was surprised how close they came to capturing the essence of the comic.

Jessica Alba who is great to look is the weakest of the foursome and her chemistry with Reed is not truly believable. The Thing and Torch were spot on, with the exception to the Thing missing his signature rock uni-eyebrow! Mr. Fantastic is played well by Ioan Gruffudd, but I was not too impressed with Doctor Doom's look and story change. I guess, like in the ""Spiderman"" films, some characters don't translate well into a live action movie(Green Goblin).

The extended edition is an improvement even though there are a few awkward scenes added with the same dialogue. The new extras on extended edition make the double dip well worth your money.",1173225600,3,1082,4.51530612244898
1551926,5,B00005JNTU,"Let me start with a brief review of the movie before I give my personal thoughts.  I realize those thoughts may or may not be helpful as far as reviewing this project, and if they aren't, they then aren't meant for you.  They're meant for those who are interested in what I'm thinking.

If you like comic book movies with plenty of action and some thought (not unlike the X-Men series, though not as deep), you will enjoy this movie as I did.  It may lack in plot originality, but it makes up for that with enjoyable and likable protagonists.

This movie is one that lives and dies with heroes you enjoy rooting for, a villain (or more) who you love to detest, and special effects that help you believe the unbelievable.  This movie succeeds on all three counts.  Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba are engaging in their roles, and Chris Evans' Tiggerish Johnny Storm plays great with Michael Chiklis as The Thing a.k.a. Eeyore.  Julian McMahon is chilling as Doctor Doom.  (I think it helps that the actors are not household names.)  And the special effects are fantastic, fantastic, fantastic, and fantastic (note my little attempt at humor here?).

Kerry Washington's casting as Alicia Masters is ingenious.  True, she does not resemble the comic book character physically, but neither do the rest of the cast (e.g. the original Johnny Storm is blonde, unlike Evans; the original Ben Grimm has hair, unlike Chiklis).  Having a black Alicia dating a white (okay, orange) Ben Grimm/Thing points out that what matters is not appearance but what is inside the person.

Finally, what about the kiddos?  I didn't notice any bad language (which the latter X-Men movies slipped into), and the violence was comic bookish.  There was no sex, though they managed to show some of Jessica Alba's skin in a couple of scenes.  As I say with all movies and TV shows, parents need to accompany their children if seeing this, but I think children past the age of, let's say seven, can handle this with parental presence and feedback.

This concludes my review of the movie per se.  Allow me to give some thoughts.  If you want to vote on whether this is helpful, please base it on the above, not on the below.  Also, if you don't want to spoil the movie, please stop reading the review at this point, because I will be spoiling some of the story from this point on.

As stated, this movie lacks some originality.  It may be that it borrowed from other sources, or it could be that the similarities between other movies are unintentional.  One example is the similarity between the villainization of Victor Von Doom here and Norman Osborn in the Spiderman movie (though from what I know, the Fantastic Four is more original, without borrowing from the comic books for the climax as Spiderman did).  Also, for those who can remember 24 years back to Superman II, the humanization and back of Ben Grimm may remind you of Superman becoming human and regaining his powers.  Other movie similarities include the pigeon leaving his mark on Ben Grimm and the dog leaving his mark on Dan Ackroyd's Winthrop in ""Trading Places"" or Johnny Storm taking out the heatseeking missles with similar strategies in ""X2"" and ""Blue Thunder"".  This may be laziness and quasi-plagarism (though to plagarize from many sources can also be called research), or this may be either an unconscious copying or thinking of something not knowing it's been done before.

It's obvious there will be a sequel -- in fact, I saw the preview today on a program I taped earlier this week.  I was trying to guess which villain would be next, or if they would bring back Doom.  My guesses of possible new villains were the Puppet Master, the Sub-Mariner, the Frightful Four (introducing the Inhumans, including Johnny's girlfriend Crystal) and the shape changing Skrull.  I forgot all about Galactacus and the Silver Surfer.

Let me now move to lessons learned from this movie.  This movie focuses on related subjects of teamwork and friendship.  Also, as a preacher, I can see the devilish side of Dr. Doom.  I'm speaking specifically of how he deceives Ben Grimm and makes a rift between him and Reed Richards.  The devil does the same thing to divide Christians, for the purpose of achieving his goal, which includes the destruction of the individual Christian, easier to do when they are isolated from their fellow believers.",1172793600,2,4369,4.763297872340425

1551928,5,B00005JNTU,"""Fantastic Four"" was released in 2005 to mostly poor reviews (it eventually chalked up a $330 million worldwide box office gross despite that), with critics labeling it a dull origin movie that spent too much time on character infighting and not enough on action.  While ""Fantastic Four"" is undoubtedly labored by its curious origin story of how four New Yorkers-turned-astronauts suddenly find themselves with staggering elemental powers thanks to a mysterious cosmic storm, the movie as a whole is a fun trip.  It's exactly what a ""comic book movie"" is supposed to be -- harmless, engaging fun, with no gore, nothing overly scary, and no need to engage the inner recesses of the brain to figure out motivations and layers of plot.  Simple is not a bad word in this genre, and ""Fantastic Four"" is an easy, enjoyable romp through the pages of a comic come to life.

I bought a copy of ""Fantastic Four"" on full-screen DVD in February 2007, after watching the trailer for its upcoming sequel in theaters and finding myself intrigued.  The jury is still out on that one, of course, but ""Fantastic Four"" itself features characters that are easy to love, some great laughs, dynamite special effects, and never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously.  I go to the movies to be entertained, and if you do the same, I highly recommend ""Fantastic Four"" for all your high-flying comic book action needs.",1171670400,3,1403,4.849372384937238

1551930,3,B00005JNTU,"I remember seeing this in theaters back in summer 2005. When it ended, I did not think it was so fantastic. Although this film did have its good aspects- great acting, Tim Story proving to be a very competent director, and the AMAZING special effects, It was the shallow story and lack of action in the movie. There were only 2 action sequences and only one of them involved Dr. Doom. Not only that, but the final battle with Doom was like only 2 minutes long.
The plot start off with a financially troubled Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd)and his friend Ben Grimm(Mike Chicklis) visiting an old friend Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). Victor apparently has become very successful business man owning his own corporation. After some speculation, Victor decides he will fund Reeds new experiment. Apparently Reed plans are for a space expedition to study a cosmic storm, hoping it will teach them more about planetary life. His crew consists of himself, Ben, ex-girlfriend Susan Storm(Jessica Alba), her brother Johnny(Chris Evans) and Doom. However as they are up in space, something unexpected happens. Apparently the cosmic storm travelled faster than they anticipated. They all come into contact with the storm and had some very drastic results. That storm had somehow altered their DNA and given each of them different abilities. Reed can stretch far, Susan can become invisible, Johnny can turn into fire and Ben's body has become rock. As Reed tires hard to figure out a way to cure themselves, Ben must cope with the fact that he looks like a monster and Johnny becomes a show-off with his abilities. Soon, they all become celebrities known as the Fantastic Four, each of them with their own name- Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and The Thing. However, Doom too also gone through changes. HIs body is slowly transforming into a metallic compound and he can generate electricity through his body. At first he is hesitant about his changing, but soon he realizes that he can use this power for his own advantage. For his own evil doings. But he must first do one thing-take out the fantastic four.
Basically I think this movie was headed in the right direction but ended up falling short. Usually superhero film deal with the heroes trying to stop the bad guy from fulfilling an evil plan or something like that. This film really did not follow that kind of story. Perhaps it was because Dr. Doom did not really BECOME ""Doom"" until near the end of the film. That made the story and the action lack. Now that Doom is fully developed, there will be more fighting in the sequel.
However, I just watched an UNOFFICIAL FANTASTIC FOUR FILM made in 1994. Apparently the back story with this was that the movie company that had the rights to F4 but did not have much money and were eventually gonna lose the F4 rights. Other big money producers were gonna take interest into F4, all they had to do was wait for the studio to lose the rights. Before they could do that, the movie company decided to make a very cheap, low budget F4 film. Once they did that, no way was anybody going to produce an F4 film (atleast not for a while) since there was one already made. However, that film was never released in theaters or offically on video. I just watched that version on youtube.com, and I must say that has to be one of the biggest piece of trash I have seen. I know it was low budget but it was just terrible. Everything about it was bad-acting, script, lackluster character and ESPECIALLY the special fx. I would like to forget I ever saw that movie. Believe me when I say that if you do not like this film, go to youtube.com and watch the 1994 movie. I think you'll def appreciate this film after that.",1169424000,,3712,4.642857142857143

1551933,4,B00005JNTU,"For once, we are given a comic book adaptation that doesn't ruin the superheroes to make a quick buck.

""The Fantastic Four"" is smart, funny and has terrific effects. The plot is plausible enough to move the story along. An unlikely group fids itself in space to study a mysterious solar phenomenon and finds itself irradiated and physically altered. The group's scientist becomes elastic. His friend and bodyguard turns into a hideous man of stone. A brother and sister duo respectively become human fireball and invisible. The billionaire who sent them into space is turning into an electro-metallic madman.

Sounds farfetched, but the cast keeps the tone light with wisecracks and visual humor. The film also does a nice job of dealing with the group's various reactions to their new powers - embarrassment, wonder, horror and amusement. The effects are terrific. Chris Evans (as human torch Johnny Storm) goes snowboarding with a girlfriend, catches on fire inadvertently, goes careening and melts a tunnel through the snow that he turns into a hot tub for his date. The Thing (Michal Chiklis) alternates between ripping off truck doors (to save a trapped trucker) and apologizing for scaring people. He is the true emotional center of the movie, which is saying something, as he was covered many inches thick in foam and makeup to pay the role.

The DVD extras are few, with a handful of deleted scenes showing alternatives to the sentimental denouement between two characters. The images in the widescreen edition were quite distorted, especially in the first few minutes. But I either got used to them or they got better as the movie progressed.

The effects are much better than I had heard and the film has no pretensions of being especially deep or meaningful (or at least I hope it doesn't). As with most superhero movies, it sets up this particular franchise for potential sequels by telling the origins, throwing in a love story and having the heroes fight their primary nemesis (in this case, Dr. Doom). It jumps right in without providing much unnecessary background, though some of this does come out over the course of the movie since three of the main characters have shared a love triangle history. I find the Thing's story rather touching without being maudlin. His wife is introduced only to show her rejection of him in this new form, though that is all that is needed. None of the background of Johnny and Sue Storm is provided, aside from a brief mention the two are brother and sister. Would showing anything more of them together add anything to the story? In other words, I consider the movie tight and concise, which is positive. Furthermore, the casting is pretty accurate and it was a wise decision to not cast a big name celebrity, which is the norm for superhero movies, as the enemy. It was also an absolutely brilliant decision to cast Jessica Alba as Sue Storm because she is so gorgeous that I could not take my eyes off her. She certainly adds to my enjoyment of the movie.

1552033,3,B00005JNTU,"WOTHWHILE FOR FANS OF THE FANTASTIC FOUR: BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER

FIRST THOUGHTS: IT WASN'T THE X-MEN BUT IT WAS A FUN FILM TO WATCH

As a youngster during the 60s when the Marvel comic and TV animated series were running [Fantastic 4] I found this franchise to be the most interesting and compelling. When the X-Men were produced into two great feature films I was very hopeful as to the disposition of the promised Fantastic Four feature.

IN A NUTSHELL: A FILM ABOUT COPING WITH CHANGE - STRESS & ESTRANGEMENT

The ""Fantastic Four"" feature film took the 'origins of the fantastic four' as the movie's theme. To this extent the film was competent, but nothing out of the ordinary, when compared to the recent X-Men and Spider Man releases. Nevertheless, this film is entertaining and does make sense, although it is not beneath pandering to young men via Jessica Alba's implicit nudity. It is mostly a film about people facing the stress and the estrangement that comes with major unexpected changes in themselves, and how others see and relate to them. This is most coherently portrayed by Ben Grim/'THE THING' [Michael Chiklis] who brings some much needed humanity to this piece in the form a small measure of a 'beauty and the beast' subplot. In essence, Ben Grim has turned into 'The Thing' and unlike the others he can not turn back - he is stuck in his superhero mode and basically feels apart from everything that was in his world, before the accident in Space. Only a blind woman can see that he is not a monster, and this could have been enlarged within the plot to good effect.

THINGS TO MARVEL AT:

The scene on the Brooklyn Bridge is easily the most amazing scene in the film. Ben Grim is on center stage as he confronts a would-be jumper as he ponders the same thoughts [jumping off the bridge]. With a little comedy and special effects, Ben Grim stops a huge truck cold, saves the jumper and creates a debacle on the bridge that ends with the recognition of the 'Fantastic 4' as group of superheros as a breaking headline story on the news.

1552034,2,B00005JNTU,"Normally, I like to spot off ad naseum. For this one, I'll keep it short. To toss this out there, I'm a fan of comics. The Thing is one of my favorite Marvel characters. Now the review-lite:

Michael Chiklas (please forgive my poor spelling) is great as the Thing. He emotes well through the suit, and fits the Ben Grimm role quite well. Ioan Gruffudd is OK as Mr. Fantastic, but could have done more with it. Jessica Alba is a waste of space as Sue (albeit a nice looking one), and Chris Evans got annoying as Torch. Victor von Doom wasn't portrayed with any real gravity, either. Jokes were lame, but a decent attempt to portray the four as a family with their share of rows.

Not a terrible movie, mind you, but not worth watching more than once. A rental at best. Here's hoping the inevitable sequel is better...",1164758400,,816,4.397350993377484
1552035,2,B00005JNTU,"This movie is fairly terrible.  Poorly written one liners, characters bastardized from a great comic into unlikable heros.

What upsets me most is Dr. Doom.  In the comics he was a man who learned magic from his mother, when she died he tried to create a device to communicate with her in a hell dimension.  Reed sabotaged the machine and Doom fled to live with monks in Tibet, who built his armor for him.  Then he goes to Latveria, overthrows their government, and makes himself king.  His three purposes in life: Free his mother from hell, kill Reed Richards, and hostile takeover of the world.  BUT, in the movie he is just a guy exposed to solar radiation, turns into metal and has control over electricity.  Wow, lets forget about the comic when making a comic book movie...sound good?

The only redeeming character is Ben Grimm, played by Michael Chiklis.  He actually emotes, even through a 60 lb latex suit.

Excessive reliance on CGI, poor writing, TERRIBLE casting...every thing the comic movie genre needs to help it earn the bad rep it already has.  Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. starring David Hasselhoff was better than this schlock.  Now they are making a sequel, and like a true fan of the Fantastic Four comics, I hold out hope for a decent movie.

They need to hire one of the decent writers from the comic industry to write a story for these 'normally wonderful' characters.  There is so much potential being wasted.  Rent it if you want, but I wouldn't pay money to own it.",1164412800,,1497,4.634980988593156
1552094,3,B00005JNTU,"I'm really excited that FOX is finally releasing some of it's catalog titles on Blu-Ray.  But these titles are exactly that catalog titles, that are priced higher than most studios day and date releases.  The picture and sound quality are on par with Sony / Warner Bros. / Paramount / Disney, not any better or worse.  The ""extras"" are sorely missing.  I'm really getting tired of certain studios setting up for the ""double dip"" by not including the basic extras from their dvd couterparts.  Yes, I did purchase this movie, but I feel cheated having to pay this much to enjoy the Fantastic Four in Hi-def, when M:I:3 looks a lot better, is packed with features, and costs less.  Come on Sony, Fox, & Disney step up your Hi-def game.",1163548800,6,732,4.592307692307692

1552096,1,B00005JNTU,"Who's idea was it to put Jessica Alba as Sue Storm?  Chris Evans's portrayal of Johnny Storm was somewhat disappointing too, although not as bad as Jessica Alba's portrayal of Sue Storm.  Why do they cast Hollywood big names in these movies just for the sake of having big celebrities in these movies?  They really need to cast people who actually fit the roles and have talent for portraying the characters.  This movie was somewhat good, but it didn't feel all that great.  So far, this movie is just another of Marvel's somewhat disappointing movies along the lines of Elektra, The Incredible Hulk, Xmen 3, Daredevil, and The Punisher.  I was so happy to see Marvel characters getting their own movies, but after seeing what Hollywood does to them, I would rather see Marvel's chracters go back into hiding.  Special effects were good in this movie, and so was the story.  Michael Chiklis as the Thing was great, and his The Thing character makeup was done very well, and he played the character well too, as did Ioan Gruffud with Mr. Fantastic.  Jessica Alba and Chris Evans definitely demoted this movie.",1162771200,,1109,4.7643979057591626
1552097,2,B00005JNTU,"As part of my ongoing quest to catch up on comic book movies that I have missed over the past few years I came across this clunker. I understand, of course, that I am not the target demographic here. Most comic book fans want nothing more out of their movies than authenticity; unfortunately I was looking for an actual cinematic experience. Four scientists go gallivanting around space with some chump named Dr. Von Doom (who wins the award for the Most Obvious Name for a Villain Ever); they run into trouble and are the recipients of super powers (now we're talking) thanks to some chemical filled cloud. What follows is one of the most shameless attempts to buy a box office victory in history. Special effects pile on top of bad special effects as the film is quickly reduced to nothing more than a dull fireworks show. We get The Thing caving in the front of a semi-truck with his shoulder as the money shot, but it comes in the middle of a scene that left me mystified. An entire bridge and just about every car on it are destroyed by these four farting around with their found powers. But since these are the good guys we have to watch as they scramble to save everybody they endangered, and succeed. Destruction for the fans, no consequences for the characters. But why would director Tim Story try anyways? He knows the people are just showing up to ogle at Jessica Alba as she pretends to act. So instead of focusing on the story he focuses on making sure that those dozens and dozens of product placements make it into the frame. He should have just directed a Pepsi commercial with Jessica Alba and saved us the trouble of watching this mess.

The plot is also outwardly defiant in its interest in being even a little entertaining. Instead of watching good fight evil we are stuck watching the superheroes squabble. They aren't even aware that the bad guy is the bad guy until the last fifteen minutes of the movie. They go out, show off their powers (in things like extreme sports, you know, for the kids), and then yell at each other for not being discreet enough. There is also a lackluster love triangle between Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Dr. Von Doom (Julian McMahon). I'm sure it is real nice to believe that someone who looks like Jessica Alba would rather go out with a lowly scientist as opposed to the all powerful, all wealthy Dr. Von Doom. But chances are if you're chasing someone that looks like her she's not interested in your kind demeanor and meaningful career. So why is my rating so high above the zero I've been talking it up to be? Well it is what it is. It didn't put me to sleep as it washes over you fairly harmlessly and quickly. It was fun watching TV actors such as Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon try their luck at a Hollywood blockbuster. And at least it wasn't ""Catwoman."" But what it was was insulting. Beyond the obvious point that nobody would believe Jessica Alba as a scientist lies another that shows just how stupid Story thinks we are. At a newsstand, on the cover of People magazine there is a picture of Sue Storm. Now if Stephen Hawkings can't make it to the cover of People then what chance does this two-bit scientist have? **1/4",1161734400,10,3222,4.517123287671233
1552098,3,B00005JNTU,"This is it, the version of ""Fantastic Four"" that was made with the boat-loads of money the subject deserved, and that the producers actually intended to see the light of day.  So was it worth the wait?  Not quite.

In many respects, ""Fantastic Four"" patterns itself on the far superior and more successful ""Spiderman"" - still the standout among superhero movies and especially Marvel Superhero movies.  In this version, the Four are in space doing experiments for the wealthy Viktor Von Doom.  A vain and narrow-minded megalomaniac in the comic, this Doom is a Doom for the 21st century - he's a vain and narrow-minded CEO and (unlike the comic) he's in space with The Four when those crazy cosmic rays attack.  Back on Earth, it doesn't take long for everybody to realize that they've undergone some major life-change.  Hotheaded Johnny Storm becomes ""The Human Torch"".  The somewhat shy Sue becomes ""Invisible Girl"" (""girl?!"" she asks indignantly when first hearing the name).  Ben Grim morphs into ""The Thing"" while Reed Richards becomes the oddly-named ""Mr. Fantastic"".  Of course, nothing in this movie takes long to happen - before you know it, we've got enough dirt on the characters to see where things are going (Reed & Sue's past romance; Ben's rivalry with Johnny) though little in the story explains why the characters act the way they do.  Before you know it, the final battle's been fought, and we get the obligatory sequel-teaser scene.  Following Spiderman's lead, we've got a major act of superheroism on a bridge, the pivotal superhero-naming occurs in a big-time sporting event (motorcross instead of wrestling), and the villain as a CEO who literally kills his rivals.  FF4 is a movie that fills in the grooves, eager to offend no fans while moderately pleasing the largest audience.  It's fun but by the end, you'll probably doubt it was at all fantastic.",1159142400,4,1876,4.93312101910828
1552099,5,B00005JNTU,"I was really surprised with how much I really enjoyed this movie. I have been a fan of Marvel comics for many years so I was looking forward to seeing this finally, but I have always heard the mixed reviews. Well, I wasn't disappointed and the Fantastic Four, even though the story was different from the comic, was still very fun to watch.

Many jokes were really funny and the characters matched very well to their actors, even thought I think Mr. Fantastic looked like a Jeff Goldblum clone. The story was exciting and kept my attention the entire time. The special effects were excellent, and the costumes were as equally impressive. My only problem with the movie was that the stories weren't the same and I would have prefered if nothing was changed in the story line. By far, this isn't the worst comic book movie to be made, believe me, I have seen some stinkers. Overall, I would really recommend this mvoie to Marvel fans. It isn't terrible, unless you are a hardcore nitpicker who tries to find something wrong with a movie",1158969600,3,1034,4.589189189189189
1552100,4,B00005JNTU,"Based upon the comic book series of the same name, FANTASTIC FOUR is a sci-fi action movie about a group of scientists who gain superpowers from a powerful cosmic ray while aboard a laboratory and observation space station above Earth.  Their powers aren't apparent immediately and are dormant upon re-entry.  However, towards the end of their quarantine upon re-entry the five individuals become aware of changes in their bodies:  Dr. Richard Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) has the ability to stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes and takes on the name of Mr. Fantastic; Susan Storm (Jennifer Alba) is Reed's love interest and brother of Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) finds that she is able to become invisible at will and create force fields and is known as the Invisible Woman; Johnny Storm finds he is capable of turning himself into a living human ball of fire and that he can fly and thus calls himself The Human Torch; Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) becomes the most changed of the group having gained superhuman strength and endurance, but through a growth spurt that not only increased his sized but covered his body in giant orange scales that look like rocks.  Also aboard the station at the time of the accident was the man who financed the project, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon).  Doom doesn't outwardly acknowledge the changes occurring within him, which basically has to do with his body turning metal and some other secret skills, and blames Reed for allowing the accident to happen, even though Doom was the man at fault.  Of course, Doom was courting Sue Storm, so it doesn't help that Reed is the one who ends up winning her heart.  After revealing to the world their powers, the team tries to find a way to reverse the effects of the cosmic ray while Doom secretly plans to take over the world.

FANTASTIC FOUR has some incredible special effects.  Apparently one of the scenes of The Human Torch flying over New York was completely computer generated and took four months to create.  Despite this, the movie is relatively low on action.  There's a major fight sequence at the end, but other than that there's not much.  The reason for this is that the studio behind the film plans on making FANTASTIC FOUR into at least a trilogy and as the first part of the trilogy, this film is intended to set up things that are to come later.

I usually don't mention this, but FANTASTIC FOUR has some amazing makeup.  The Thing was not created using CGI, but instead was brought to life the old-fashioned way, through makeup and costuming.  In a day and age when many films completing ignore traditional ways of doing things, it's nice to see a movie that doesn't do that, especially in one that had so many other CGI created effects to begin with.

I didn't read very many FANTASTIC FOUR comics, but I had read enough to know the general origins and premise.  The movie stays fairly accurate to the original series (some of the action sequences were taken directly from the original comic books), though some things have been altered to make the film more modern and dramatic (e.g. Doom's presence on Shield at the time of the ""collision).  I was a little disappointed by the lack of action, but overall thought the movie was a good adaptation and a fairly exciting comic book action movie.  FANTASTIC FOUR might not quite be on par with SPIDERMAN, but it's a good opening film about a historic comic book fighting team.",1158883200,6,3432,4.709030100334449
1552101,3,B00005JNTU,"When a group of scientists and astronauts become bombarded with radioation during a freak cosmic storm, they become endowed with strange new powers. Four of the scientists band together, and call themselves the ""Fantastic Four"".

As far as the movie goes, it serves as harmless Hollywood fluff. It's an enjoyable, special effects driven, popcorn flick that really doesn't go in depth about the characters. It seems that the writers felt that since their powers match their personas, that should be it. And because of that, the movie strays away from territory that was explored so well in films like the Spider-Man and the first two X-Men films. Although, it could have also been the reason for Hulk's lackluster performance.

I think the saving graces of the film are the performances by Chris Evans (""Johnny Storm/Human Torch"") and Michael Chiklis (""Ben Grimm/The Thing""). Evans played his role with such energy and personality, it commands your attention. And the same can go for Chikils' performance, giving the Thing perhaps the most emotional role in the movie. I don't think the movie really does justice to any of the characters (except for the Thing and the Human Torch). In the comics, the Fantastic Four were reknowned for their bravery and their adventures, but the movie makes them seem like a pale imitation. Throughout most of the movie, they're confined to Mr. Fantastic's lab. However, there is some fun to be had in the movie, but it could've been so much more.

The DVD is pretty good. The special features really don't focus on the characters of the Fantastic Four for some reason. But, they include...

-Feature length commentary by Ioan Gruffudd (""Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic""), Jessica Alba (""Sue Storm/Invisible Woman""), Evans, Chiklis, and Julian McMahon (""Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom"")

-Fantastic Four Video Diary: A look at the cast as they go on a world wide promotional tour for the film in the United States, Austrailia, and Mexico shot by Jessica Alba.

-Deleted Scenes: A rather uninteresting scene featuring Mr. Fantastic testing his machine on a flower. Also, more of his date with the Invisible Woman

-""Making of Fantastic Four"" featurette

-2 Fox Movie Channel Presents featurettes: Casting Session (with an interview with Stan Lee), and Making a Scene (an in depth look at the scene on the Brooklyn Bridge)

-2 Music Videos: ""Everything Burns"" by ex-Evanesance member Ben Moody and Anastacia and ""Come On, Come In"" by Velvet Revolver (I liked this video!)

-An ""Inside Look"" at X-Men: The Last Stand: Basically, its the producer, Avi Arad, talking about the film.

Do not expect the most complex characters in the world, but who cares?  It's a comic book, and the characters are developed to the extent they need to be - that means accessibility to the young audience as well.  I'm not a fan of dumbed down, idealized, censored, D*sney type films, so when I say this movie doesn't need to be ""gritty"" and ""dark"" to achieve its purpose, I mean that from an aesthetic standpoint.  Critics appear to be knee-jerk reacting to the lack of darkness, grit, and non-stop, typically unmotivated action we see in other ""action"" films, and chafing at the presence of (dare I say it) dialogue.

1552190,3,B00005JNTU,"Going into the Fantastic Four movie, I'll admit that I expected something completely abysmal.  However, with so many of the comic to film adaptations trying to be serious and move beyond their source material (i.e. Superman Returns), sometimes it's better to have a comic book movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and just sets out to be something that many films of this type aren't: fun.  And Fantastic Four is certainly mindless fun all the way.  Scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), his ex-girlfriend Sue Storm (a blonde haired and blue contact lens wearing Jessica Alba), her daredevil brother Johnny (Chris Evans), and Reed's longtime friend Ben Grimm (The Shield's Michael Chiklis) are all transformed into the super powered team, who find their hands full with instant celebrity and their evil, super powered nemesis Victor Von Doom (Nip/Tuck's Julian McMahon).  The CGI effects are in full effect, the action is campy, and the cast is game (Chris Evans is a nice pick as the hotshot Human Torch), while the makeup and costume effects for the Thing are very well done.  It's loaded with leaps in logic and plot points which are laughable, but that's part of the film's appeal, and that's always been part of the comic's sense of appeal as well.  It works to a point, and Fantastic Four is a fun trip as long as you don't take it seriously or expect anything such as the lofty heights set by X2: X-Men United or Spider-Man 2.

1552192,2,B00005JNTU,"I watched this movie with low expectations, wanting to clear some of my backlog of movies that I wanted to watch.  There are some great effects here, but that is almost no compliment to make these days.  The characterization was rather flat, pretty predictable, as were the turn-outs of events, but don't think that this is me saying what's wrong with the movie.  As I said, I came in with low expectations, and so it's hard to say that I would have really wanted more.

One thing I WAS disappointed in, however, was a bit of a waste of one of my favorite comic books villains--Dr. Doom.  This movie spends so much time setting up the legend of the Fantastic Four that any kind of meaty conflict ends up getting on the back-burner until the last twenty minutes of the movie, and that felt like a little too long to wait.  Many comic book films have made the mistake of taking a huge amount of time to get to any action and instead wallow in a lot of pale, flat character study (ahem...Hulk?).  Maybe it's to set up sequels and keep the movie machine going, but it tends to make the first installment rather pale, and this one is no exception.",1157414400,4,1142,4.38388625592417
1552193,2,B00005JNTU,"Yes, it's true. The worst complaint about this? Why not call Dr. Doom the Metal Man. Because what they call Dr. Doom in this bears no resemblance to the original. I am not a comic purist who has issues with a movie altering a hero or villain's history for cinematic purposes. See Penguin in Batman Returns for an awesome example of reinvention. As for changing a character's history just to cop out to a plot by plot Hollywood formula? Now we're talking stink. Next, I have no problem with trying something different and lightening the tone of a superhero movie. But please don't do it to such a point that it reaches the level of a sub-standard TV sitcom. Finally, why I would say that Cat Woman was better than this... while that movie had its share of flaws (yet it was nowhere near as bad as it was blasted), I really don't think Halle's performance was bad, let alone Razzie worthy. I cannot say the same for some of the performances in Fantastic Four (knock on wood) (or... oops, were they actors?).",1156636800,3,1005,4.497267759562842

This film succeeds to prove the concept that films can be made without a plot and without caring about the characters.  Unfortunately this film does both.  Of all the actors, only Michael Chiklis manages to create a character.  The rest are terrible but then again there's no script to support them.  The effects are horrible mainly because the scenes offer no energy to support them.  I know it's amazing considering we have a person that catches fire, a person who's stone, a person who creates invisible force fields and a person who's human play dough.  Dr. Doom is entirely butchered.  When he appears in the comic costume I felt like I was watching a Mel Brooks film.  It was that bad.  They made a live action FF film years ago with a $10,000 budget or so.  That was miles about this junk.

  I also complain about the DVD.  You had to wait ten minutes to get to the film being forced to endure endless trailers before the film starts.  FF was what put Marvel on the map.  Stan Lee, who makes a great cameo, and Jack Kirby created an artistic masterpiece about a disfunctional family.

And sometimes a comic book movie franchise can start off well but end terribly - see the Superman and Batman films made circa 1978-1987 and 1989-1997 respectively. Meanwhile, ""Spawn"", ""Steel"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" h ave not done too well.

So far the X-Men and Spider-Man films, while not without their flaws and weak points, have been very successful and popular with both fans and critics, but other Marvel properties such as Captain America, Daredevil, Elektra, the Incredible Hulk and the Punisher, have only run the gamut from noble failure to complete steaming pile of dog crap. But surely the Fantastic Four should have been one of the more dud proof Marvel properties in the hit or miss summer business, and in a way, they were, for this 2005 film did well enough to be considered a hit and garner a sequel despite poor acting, poor plot, and poor direction from Tim Story. Exactly how this extremely bad adaptation of the superhero quartet that not only single handedly saved Marvel in the 1960s but pave the way for a string of heroes who, for better or worse, would go on to outshine and overshadow them in terms of sales and popularity became a hit is a mystery to me. While not as bad as ""Elektra"" or ""Catwoman"" (oh it hurts to even mention that one), the 2005 Fantastic Four is a failure on most levels (I can only imagine how bad the 1994 version was).

Things that are wrong with the film? Well, first of all, the film's biggest weak link is Jessica Alba as Susan 'Sue' Storm, AKA: The Invisible Girl/Woman. Sue Storm is not an ugly, pasty looking Hispanic girl, she is a nice looking Caucasian woman who is at least 30 years old. Adding insult to injury is the fact that Alba is a very bad actress; she couldn't emote to save her life. Whenever she tries to sound tough or passionate or authoritative, she comes across as bland, hollow, dispassionate, and uninspired (it's like watching Natalie Portman in the Star Wars prequel trilogy). When Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) is told he could have any woman in the world but indicates that Sue is very special, it's hard to understand exactly what it is about Sue that he finds so compelling or intriguing or worthy of his evil, twisted lust, since there isn't really much at the core of Sue in this uninspired film translation. And if you think I'm being mean, the British press described Alba's miscasting and poor characterization of Sue as a cross between a whiny, pushy bitch and a hollow lust object - but who in their right mind would find Alba even remotely attractive is beyond me. If they had to go under 30 to cast the Invisible Woman, with the intention of having the Invisible Woman be caught repeatedly with her clothes off, they could have at least hired an actress who was actually good looking, like Amy Smart, Ali Larter or Julia Stiles - Julia Stiles at least projects an Earthiness not seen in most actresses her age. One of the great leading ladies of comic books (alongside Wonder Woman, Lois Lane, Jean Grey and Storm), Sue Storm-Richards deserved better, and so did Ioan Gruffud's Mr. Fantastic.

Alba's male co-stars, the aforementioned Ioan Gruffud as Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards, Chris Evans as her younger brother Johnny Storm/Human Torch and Michael Chikilis as Ben Grimm/the Thing, fair much better than she does. Gruffud is an affable, absent minded Reed, but as with Dr. Doom, it's hard to imagine exactly what it is Reed sees in Alba's Sue. Evans does the cocky yet likable young guy thing as well as any other actor his age can. Michael Chikilis is easily the strongest of the four as the cranky, crotchety Thing. If only he'd have clobbered Tim Story...

Julian McMahon, meanwhile, is a very poor Dr. Doom. McMahon's Doom is very hollow and empty, lacking the powerful presence, malice, charm and evil incarnate necessary to make Doom register as a threat. And this is Dr. Doom for crying out loud, one of the most famous Marvel villains out there! This guy is to the Fantastic Four what Magneto is to the X-Men, and also a rumored inspiration for Darth Vader of the Star Wars films!

A few decent action sequences and a few genuinely funny moments aren't enough to elevate this thing above the garbage that it is. Tim Story, chosen with only the urban comedy ""Barbershop"" as his standout credit, because the Marvel folk wanted to take a change of pace from the gritty, brooding superhero films that dominate so much of today's market, which I can appreciate, but it failed miserably because Story has no knack for subtlety or action sequences. The violence is mildly engaging but hardly exciting, especially since Story failed to properly flesh out the characters enough to make you care as to whether or not they'll survive and save humanity.

Just skip it and stick with the comic books. Or even the 1994-1996 animated version.",1156032000,4,5121,4.684444444444445

He might have looked like the comic character, but to me he looked more like the lovechild of James Woods and Jeff Goldblum.  The others like Thing, and Torch guy, and Dr Nip and Tuck were so bland and one dimensional it seemed like during the whole film I was waiting for the cardboard cutouts to flipping leave and the real people actors to step in. The storyline, basically a soap opera with sparks. Tim Story who directed this has as far as I can see one major film under his belt ""Barbershop"", and he is slated to direct the next Fantastic Four movie, which has the foursome adding a fifth the Silver Surfer being played by Doug Adams who was the fish guy in Hell boy.

Once back on earth, they discover that they have each acquired some strange ""super power"" which allows them to do ""fantastic"" things.  Reed, the leader of the mission and a first class ""commitment-phobe,"" turns into some sort of rubber man, whose limbs can stretch to astronomical lengths; Sue, his ex-girlfriend, becomes the ""invisible woman,"" able to appear and disappear at will; her brother, Johnny, a frat-boy practical jokester, suddenly becomes a human fireball capable of flying all over the city (he thinks that`s really ""cool""); and Ben, Reed's practical assistant, gets the worst of the deal, turning into a Hulk-type creature who faces a life of loneliness and rejection because of his looks.

""The Fantastic Four,"" based on the Marvel Comic of the same name, is a hokey, harmless little time-waster that may appeal to superhero devotees with lax standards when it comes to movies based on such works.  The real problem with the film is that the heroes spend more time talking about their powers than doing anything very interesting with them.  There's a fairly nifty little fight scene at the end, but it takes way too long to get there for it to be really worth the trip.  On the other hand, there's a breezy quality to some of the writing, particularly in the put-down exchanges between Ben and Johnny, which helps to compensate for the rather sappy conversations between the former lovers, Reed and Sue.

Having a special place in my heart for the Fantastic Four, and having been an avid reader of the series since the seventies, I admit that perhaps my bar was set a bit high for this particular adaptation.

But what happened? The X-men and Superman got Bryan Singer as director, Spiderman got Sam Raimi, and the FF gets... Tim Story. After this debacle, I think the only directing job Mr. Story is suited to is television commercials for cleaning supplies. After all, he did make something as inherently thought-provoking and exciting as an FF story look about as stimulating as cleaning the bathroom after a freshman kegger. The fact that a director could reduce this concept to one of less interest or merit than an episode of Sex in the City constitutes criminal behavior.

In fact, after this steaming heap of excremental celluloid wreckage that Story served up, (I literally had to shoo the flies away from the screen as I watched), I seriously think that someone in the entertainment industry should press charges. Perhaps his producer. Or Marvel? Stan Lee? How about a charge of First-degree desecration of cinema? Felony tastelessness? Misdemeanor lack of imagination? Just plain stupid?

Mr. Story can't be held completely accountable, however. Ioan Gruffudd, as Mr. Fantastic, acts just like his name looks. Plainly said, Mr. Gruffudd has all the acting skill and personal charm of a can of Nacho Cheese-Whiz with a face painted on it. And Chris Evans? Let me guess, his father owns a studio? His mother knows someone who owns a studio? Mr. Evans has incriminating photos of someone who owns a studio? All kidding aside, I received a better performance from my family dog in our last vacation video, and the dog was very sick that week.

And speaking of a vomitous mess, shall we discuss Julian McMahon as Doctor Doom? Frankly, I can think of many thousands of actors who could have done more justice to the good Doctor than this scenery chewing slag-pile of anti-acting. How about David Spade? Or Tony Danza? How about Cory Feldman?

I do love Jessica Alba, (Who doesn't? Why don't you turn around right now and go order a copy of 'Sin City'?) and Michael Chiklis truly is great, but neither one of them, even with all their super-powers, was enough to save this movie ... a movie that is to the fine art of film what the Hindenberg was to the fine art of aeronautics.

1552290,2,B00005JNTU,"Usually, when I go into a movie with low expectations, I'm able to come out pleasantly surprised when it turns out to be reasonably entertaining. It worked with the second Matrix film, the X-men movies, and the Da Vinci Code. It didn't work for this one.

The characters in this movie are pretty uniformly unlikable. First there's the Human Torch, whose main personal characteristic is that he's what some might call ""brash"" and what others might more accurately call ""an annoying idiot."" Then there's the Invisible Woman (played vacantly by Jessica Alba) and Mr. Fantastic who spend much of their time having uncomfortable and phony discussions about their failed romance. The Invisible Woman's main complaint with Mr. Fantastic seems to be that she thinks he's a simpering nancy-boy. Consequently, Mr. Fantastic is played as a parody of an uptight nerd. (Mr. F. is the stretchy one. You should be able to guess the super-powers of the other two by their names.)

Then there's The Thing. Basically he's the Hulk, but uglier, and permanent. He's somewhat more likable than the other characters, though he spends most of the movie moping, which is understable since he's, by normal human standards, physically repellant. Fortunatly a blind woman cares for him, her blindness apparantly turning the act of hugging a heap of asphalt into a pleasant experience.

The dialogue in this movie is pretty clumsy. The discussions between The Invisible Woman and Mr. Fantastic are somewhat painful. The characters, except for The Thing, are weirdly blase about their newfound powers. There's a fair smattering of cheese as well, as when crowds gather to applaud the amazing foursome.

The movie is not boring, exactly, but it's not a lot of fun either, never quite escaping a predictable mediocrity. I'll resist the addition of spoilers, though the ones I would've mentioned are only spoilers in the most-technical sense; anyone with a brain could've predicted them anyway.

1552402,1,B00005JNTU,"Even when I went to see this film at the cinema, I had low expectations of this movie. As it turned out, these expectations turned out to be perfectly well founded. It was actually considerably worse than I had expected. Everything about it reeks of mass-marketed garbage, from the hackneyed one-liners dominating the script to the ending which leaves us with the marked impression that the film's budget had run out at an inappropriate moment.

I don't think I really need to re-tell this film's storyline; the radiation, the resulting super-powers, the heroes, the villains, yadda yadda yadda. I'll refrain from labelling it as ""cliched"" as the franchise it was based on was inherently the birth of the cliche to begin with. I am personally inclined to think that execution is more important than originality; thankfully, this is unimportant in this case as The Fantastic Four is incompetent in both areas. The majority of the film is taken up by the four protagonists trying to co-exist under one roof, the antagonist (Dr. Doom) only making a real appearance towards the end. The film's focus resides mainly on Ben Grimm (The Thing) and his angst over his appearance. Vapid though this may seem, it still serves as a welcome substitute for the other three cardboard cut outs passed off as ""characters"". The love interest between Sue and Reed... hold the phone, love interest!? I scarcely noticed. This theme feels so stale and underdeveloped (makes sense, considering the characters involved) that I can't help but wonder why they bothered at all. Johnny Storm is possibly even worse; while he is obviously supposed to be lively and brash, he instead comes across as being an utter arsehole, from the way he treats the other protagonists to how he relentlessly purues fame and fortune. The end result is that you don't really give a f*ck what the four think of each other, so the bad blood between them is wasted. They can all tear each other to shreds for all I care

Of course, the predictable inner conflict amongst the group results in an equally predictable attempt at manipulation from Dr. Doom (who's motivation for doing so, by the way, is basically a paper thin excuse). This brings to light another problem with the film: the pacing is all over the place. With the section about the four co-existing being drawn out over at least an hour, we are hit out of nowhere with the big nasty doctor's assault on them. The film directly translates from its attempts at inner turmoil amongst the group to the final battle against the antagonist; no preparation, no fluid transition, nothing. Don't even get me started on the ""fighting,"" which is amongst the least intense and slowest paced I have ever seen in a film. And of course, there's the ending. For me, who had already put up with all the pointlesness that had come before in the hope of a decent conclusion, this was the death knell. Goddies do something smart with fire and water, baddie loses, and I'm left thinking ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!?"" It's a sickentingly patronising ""happily ever after"" affair from then on, with the four getting on with their stale, hackneyed little existance. Go ahead fellas, I couldn't care less.

And of course there's the issue of the *ahem* ""script."" Well, you know that bit on the trailers? That one, with ""Whoa, you're hot!"" ""Why thank you, so are you."" There you go. Script in a nutshell.

So, I think my point is made. This film gets a big, fat 0/10 on all counts from me. It really kills me that production-line garbage like this gets so much attention.",1151193600,5,3555,4.756888168557537
1552403,5,B00005JNTU,"After a succession of dark and/or self-important comic book adaptations, such as batman, sin city, spiderman and the like, fantastic four makes a very refreshing change. It is very bright, lots of colour, and a fun, light-hearted tone, with a plethora of puns and gags which will have you giggling and groaning at the same time.

It also makes a refreshing change to see them (eventually) embracing their powers as gifts, and using them and not being shy about remaining anonymous, as most other superheroes will do. This perhaps makes the four seem more human - the public know exactly who they really are. Anyway, this also gives a touch of grounding in realism - guys that looked like that, with powers like that - we'd know all about them surely? It's not like a pair of glasses each would make them Joe (or Josephine) regular, a la Clark Kent (how did Lois buy that for so many years anyway?)

But I digress. Ioan Gruffudd manages a competent if rather textbook American accent, and Jessica Alba fulfils her assigned role by being as hot as ever (though why are female scientists always knockouts? They never were in my school!). The stars of the piece though are Michael Chiklis' heartfelt portrayal of the thing, and Julian McMahon camping it up superbly as the villain. Chris Evans (no, not that one!) rounds out the heroic quartet as the arrogant guy who takes full advantage of his fame, cut straight from the template.

The special effects are superb (although that comes almost as standard nowadays), and all of our heroes get chance to fully show off their powers, even if some of them have been amplified from the original comics.

One criticism of the film is that although running at 1 hour 45 minutes the story was too short in itself, and that most of the film seemed to be all about setting up a series of sequels - as if this was merely the first chapter of the full film. Be that as it may, as a franchise launcher, it has certainly whetted the appetite. A sequel will be eagerly anticipated, and will be expected to improve on its predecessor.",1150934400,9,2065,4.603260869565218
1552404,4,B00005JNTU,"Fantastic Four received a lot of criticism for being to campy, corny, not enough action, etc.  Well, guess what?  Fantastic Four is NOT Batman, Superman, or Spider-Man.  I think those who were expecting it to be were the ones who ended up being disappointed.

The Fantastic Four is one of Marvel's oldest comic books.  Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, it was intended to not only be a storyline about superheroes, but a storyline about family.  And that is what much of the Fantastic Four has always been about: family.  This, obviously, largely includes how they interact with each other.

In my opinion, the film actually does a pretty good job bringing these popular characters to life.  Part of the success is in the story.  It's a simple story, and sometimes the simple stories are the most successful.

The Fantastic Four does not have the complexity of Spider-Man's inner battle with his guilt and shame, nor the psychological complexities of Batman.  Perhaps this is one of the main reasons why the Fantastic Four's fan base is among the most diverse.  Not only is it collected by young boys and men, but also women like it for its relationship values.

First of all, the casting is pretty darn good.  They nailed every single one of the characters.  Ioan Gruffud does a good job of playing the highly intellectual, Reed Richards.  Even in the comics, you wonder where Reed's love really lies...with Sue, or science.

Jessica Alba was great as Sue Storm.  I had my reservations, at first, but then she loves to play comic-book icons, and she more than nails this role, bringing out Sue's emotional and maternal instincts as well as her toughness when she has to be.

Chris Evans was a good choice to play the somewhat reckless Johnny Storm.  He brings a lot of energy to the part, which is necessary to play Johnny.

Michael Chiklis is a perfect Ben Grimm.  Apparently, the character was Michael's favorite as a boy.  It's obvious by how accurate he plays the gentle, wounded soul of the Thing who is constantly afflicted his appearance which already robs him of his girlfriend.

The interactions between these four characters is really what make the film work.  The banter between Johnny and Ben is fun, which is also true to the comic book as these two characters are always needling each other, even though it's obvious that they love and care about each other.  There is something sweet and touching in the relationship between Sue and Reed as she tries to break through that intellectual shell that he's always behind. They really do feel like a family.

The only question of casting I have is Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom.  He just doesn't have that presence that Doctor Doom should have.  Doctor Doom without question is one of Marvel's most feared and iconic ""bad guys,"" and you need something more than what Julian is able to bring to play him.

The origin is slightly altered for the film, but it works well.  The only origin that was drastically changed was that of Victor.  In the comic, he wears armor.  He doesn't change into some kind of metallic man.

There are action scenes in the film, but again, it's not along the same lines as what you may be used to seeing in comic book film.  The final showdown with Doom in the streets of New York is well done, and not over-the-top like it could have been.

I think a lot of fans were duped in by the PG-13 rating, thinking that it was going to be more action-packed and grittier than it is.  If they had gotten a PG rating instead (which it should have if a couple of elements were changed) then expectations may not have gotten so badly out of proportioned.

I found this to be a fun and enjoyable film.  I won't lie to you though.  If you're looking for action and grittiness, then the Fantastic Four probably isn't for you, and you might be better off to try something else.

But for Marvel's first family comic book, this movie does them pretty well.",1150761600,4,3931,4.597122302158273

1552406,3,B00005JNTU,"As summer movies go, Fantastic Four is your typical ""popcorn flick"".  This movie is not the excellent superhero movie it could have been. While I agree with Tim Story's decision to turn Fantastic Four into a ""family-oriented"" movie, I feel he missed the mark by appealing to the adult crowd with the adult humor.  Fantastic Four could have been a far better movie if it had been rated PG and geared strictly towards the younger crowd.  The actors, with a few exceptions (Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans), were miscast as well.

The love triangle-between Reed, Sue, and Victor seemed forced and just out of place.  Sue Storm (played by Jessica Alba) was shown MANY times showcasing her body.  From running down the street stripping out of her clothes so she wouldn't be spotted when she turned invisible to Reed walking in on her in the bathroom as she wraps herself in a towel was gratuitous and an obvious attempt at just displaying Jessica's ""talents"".  While I enjoy Jessica as an actress, as well as a beautiful woman, she was completely wrong for the role of Sue Storm.  Johnny had always been Sue's YOUNGER brother while here they looked to be almost the same age.

Ioan Gruffuld as Reed Richards was just plain HORRIBLE.  How did this guy ever get the role?  He can't act.  I can see why someone like Jessica Alba would dump him.  I would have much rather liked to see George Clooney (who I believe WAS considered) as Reed Richards.

Julian McMahon, while a great actor, was just wrong for Dr. Doom.  Dr. Doom is supposed to be from the foreign country Latveria.  Here he was just as much an American as the rest of the cast.  Known for his roles on Charmed and Nip/Tuck, I feel he was brought in for the TV fanbase.  I think someone more like Clive Owen could have been a good Dr. Victor Von Doom.

Next we come to my two favorite casting choices, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis.  Chris played the hot-headed, carefree, goofiness of Johnny to perfection.  I can't think of anyone else who I would have liked as Johnny Storm.  Same goes for Michael as Ben Grimm.  Just downright perfect casting.  I truly believed when I first saw him on screen that he would be The Thing.  Hearing ""It's clobberin' Time"" was so cool.

In the end Fantastic Four, while not fantastic, is a guilty pleasure for some great scenes but overall the movie just wasn't up to par with some other wonderful Marvel movies.  I would only recommend this movie for the die-hard FF fan, but even then I would warn them not to be too impressed.  This could have been better.",1149897600,,2549,4.542857142857143

Rent a pizza, have some friends over, watch it with your wife/grilfriend (she owes you one for watching all of her chick flicks) shut down your brain and have a great time.  It's funny, the story is centered around getting to know the characters and their powers and the last fight is short, but really awesome when they stand side by side to confront Dr. Doom.

The special effects are pretty good, Human Torch is the best.  The Thing's costume is great, Mr. Fantastic's effects could of been a little better, but they work.  A large portion of the film takes place primarily in Reed's lab while they learn the jest of their powers.

The casting could of been a little bit better.  Human Torch/Chris Evans is the best.  The Thing should of been CGI.  Thing is short and stocky, but here he's the smallest out of the four.  He just didn't look big enough in comparison to the comic book Thing.  Julian McMahon is a great choice for Dr. Doom.  I really hated his Doom character so I guess he did his job.  Ioan and Jessica did a good job, not great.  There casting was a bit off.  They don't mesh well onscreen as Reed and Sue.  I just couldn't believe Jessica falling for a guy like Ioan.  Their chemistry just was not there.  If Jessica was cast as Invisible Woman for eye candy and to put some male butts in the seats then it work.  She looks really good in this movie.

It's not one of Marvel's best films, but is better than Elektra and Daredevil PG-13 version.  All cast members seem to understand the comic book film genre and have signed on to return in the sequel.  To me, that is awesome and because of this Fantastic Four is a favorite movie of mine.  I love when actors understand the need for these characters.  I would recommend this film to add in your collection.

1552408,2,B00005JNTU,"OK, it is kinda odd to give a movie two-stars and then state that it wasn't as bad as anticipated, but that is the case here.  Friends on the online TV/movie board I post on had universally panned this as one of the worst movies ever and the critics were equally unkind when it came out.  So, I was expecting something utterly awful.  I only decided to see it after finishing rewatching both seasons of DARK ANGEL for a project I'm involved in and wanting to see how Jessica Alba of last summer compares to the Jessica Alba of four years ago.

The basic problem is that nothing much really happens.  If a super hero movie involving not one but four super heroes and one super villain isn't an action film, I don't know what is.  But the truth is, this is a pretty boring movie.  Much of the story feels rushed, especially the first fifteen, where the leads are all rushed unceremoniously into space to meet the radiation wave that will transform them all into genetically altered creatures.  All of this happens way too quickly and we don't get any real feel for the way their individual transformations affect them.  A lot of the problem is that the run time is just over a hundred minutes, which is simply too little time to stretch out the narrative properly.  I can understand why they didn't properly introduce us to the characters and develop the story about how they became the Fantastic Four:  they wanted to keep the film short enough to guarantee more showings per day per screen in order to maximize profit.  The film needed at least another forty minutes or so, but that would have meant eliminating one or two showings per day.

On various fan boards the remake that is supposed to start filming later this summer is receiving some serious criticism, but I think there is actually a chance that a sequel could be much better than the original.  The group is set up and there is actually a chance now of focusing on a story.  The question is whether they have a decent script.  The Spiderman films, especially the second one, have shown what a good script can mean to a super hero movie.  But Sam Raimi has grasped something that few others working in the genre has:  not special effects but the story is the main thing.  Raimi went out of his way to recruit novelist Michael Chabon (author of THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY, a novel about two comic book writers in the early forties, which won Chabon a Pulitzer Prize) to write the stories for the second and third movies.  Has a similarly strong story been written for the Fantastic Four sequel?  One can hope, but Mark Frost, who wrote the script for this one--and the script was the biggest problem with this film--is writing the sequel.  Frost does not have a good track record.  His lone claim to fame was being co-creator of TWIN PEAKS, but one suspects that the brilliance of that show had more to do with David Lynch than Frost.

In an obvious cost-saving move the producers went with TV actors, who usually command far smaller salaries than established film actors.  I love Jessica Alba, who is not only one of the most perfect looking human beings on planet earth, but who seems to be a genuinely nice person, but she isn't the most capable actress in the world.  I am hoping with her winning personality that she can craft a nice movie career.  On a completely superficial level I'd love to see her go back to her natural hair color.  She actually looks better with very dark hair.  She just looks . . . well, odd, with light hair.  It doesn't fit her skin tone or her huge dark eyes.  On a nonsuperficial level, I think she was an asset to the film and since she has enjoyed a surprising amount of success post-FANTASTIC FOUR she is actually the major star in the film.  Still, when she was signed she had almost no film work behind her and was known almost exclusively for having starred in DARK ANGEL and for being one of the world's most beautiful human beings.  Michael Chiklis has established a reputation for being one of the finest actors in television, but has yet to achieve any kind of success in film.  Still, like Alba his price was low compared to others.  Chris Evans was and is an unknown, while Ioan Gruffudd is known primarily for playing Horatio Hornblower on TV.  Julian McMahon, of course, is another television actor, playing the morally challenged plastic surgeon on NIP/TUCK.  My point is that the producers did a great deal to minimize expenses on the film, both keeping salaries low and keeping per day screenings high.

There were, of course, a vast number of special effects in the movie, but we are way past the point where special effects can carry a film.  Special effects are only (no pun intended) effective when in the service of the story; a story cannot be used as a clothesline upon which you string special effects.

Still, I never found the film impossible or painful to watch.  Mainly I just found myself waiting for the moving to start even as it was coming to an end.  Hopefully they will learn from their mistakes and strive to come up with an interesting story for the sequel.",1148860800,3,5107,4.53056768558952

1552472,4,B00005JNTU,"There are serious SF films then there are entertaining SF films and, as of late, the film industry has seen fit to adapt several comic book SF characters onto the silver screen. Whether or not these are serious or entertaining is often left up to the viewer's discretion. Some have been great (Spiderman) and some not-so-great (Catwoman). Then we have this movie, the FANTASTIC FOUR.

Debuting in 1961 (Marvel Comics), the Fantastic Four hit on new ground: a dysfunctional family of sorts who fight amongst themselves as much as they do against the forces of evil. Unable to decide on costumes, they really had none for several episodes. All of them gained their superpowers from exposure to cosmic rays while visiting a space-station.

Jump to 2005 and we get the entire dysfunctional dynamic rolled into a 105 minute film; not an easy task. But director Tim Story does an admirable job with writers Mark Frost and Michael France's screenplay. The space-station, the problems with costumes, the infighting, it's all there (thus my postive rating).

The beautiful Jessica Alba stars as the sexy, kick-a$$ Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Her powers include the ability to manipulate matter and light. Chris Evans (whom I'd personally give top billing) brings to life the role of  Johnny Storm/The Human Torch, Sue's immature younger brother who can spark up any room with his powers and his wit. And Mr. Evans instills some much needed comedy into the flick by playing pranks on the other three as well as having some great dialogue. Ioan Gruffudd bends the silver screen as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, the flexible rubberman who is the defacto leader of the Fantastic Four (and who's also in love with Sue Storm).  Then we have Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who's increased mass and stone-like structure have given him incredible strength ...and some problems at home. He's uneffectually called The Thing and his wife leaves him posthaste when she discovers his altered physical structure.

The great thing about the film is that it really looks at the issues surrounding being a newly developed superhero and how people might respond to such a thing. For one thing, when Ben Grimm's wife leaves him, she pulls off her wedding ring and Ben/The Thing tries to pick it up but can't because of his bulky hands. It's actually a fairly touching scene and we can feel Ben's frustration. Also there's the lost love between Sue Storm and Reed Richards which is always in the background and causes flare-ups and fights constantly. Then there's Johnny Storm's discovery of his flaming superpowers and his difficulty in controlling them (or lack of wanting to control them). He's a cocky upstart who brings an entirely new dynamic to the group ...which is why I'd give him top billing.

The film's faults are easily seen as we're rushed through certain aspects (how they plan to get back to normal using a machine created by Richard) and several convenient plot twists (not uncommon, though, for comic books).

This is a fun film. It's not at the level of Spiderman, but it's way, way above Catwoman.",1147392000,,3087,4.934489402697495
1552473,2,B00005JNTU,"Somewhere in Hollywood someone at Marvel comics decided to re-write the original Fantastic Four story and make it hip, hot and fresh to appeal to your average 13 year old boy. Their reasoning? Marketing I guess....get the young kids in and maybe they will buy the comics, toys and the dvd.

What, may I ask, was wrong with the original story? Why would you make some three hundred thousand old fans unhappy by taking a decent story and making it cheap? Money I guess.

It IS possible to make a comic book into a good movie. Its been done. This one is not good. How can you destroy such a good story?

First, make Reed Richards a bit of a bumbling blockhead and a stereo typical scientist. Second, make Johnny Storm the lead character so that a younger audience will identify with him. Third, radically alter Dr. Doom's character to fit in with a more modern theme of ""corporate bad guys"".

The only thing they got right was Ben Grimm and Sue Storm.

The movie was fun and entertainment, very good visual effects too.

1552475,4,B00005JNTU,"Another superhero flick. After Spiderman and Batman Begins and The Hulk and...

Not that there's anything wrong with these per se. I thought Batman Begins was a great flick and Spiderman, and especially Spiderman 2, had some great character depth. But it seems like the superhero stories invariably either end up camp and crappy, or they're all about the dark and conflicted side of the hero in question. Fantastic Four had great potential here to fall into the `camp' camp and be truly terrible; not quite as bad as the bad old Batman incarnations, but terminally trivial anyway.

In the event it wasn't like that at all. It was light fare, all right, and the conflicts, such as there were, weren't in the same class of `darkness' as those in the other movies mentioned. But somewhere along the line FF accomplished something none of the others did: it was unmitigated fun, without becoming camp. I found myself chuckling and actually genuinely liking it. Something about its unpretentious simplicity was incredibly appealing. The relationships of the characters worked. A lot of it-well, almost all-was utterly predictable, but in this instance that was a nice thing. Maybe that's the word here: `nice'. Of all the comic adaptations this one here's the only one qualifying as `nice'.

Does it matter? Maybe not. It did for me. Just sit back and enjoy, and don't ask for anything more than it can give. If you do that, you'll get the best value out of it-and that quite of lot of value in this case.

I felt kind of bad for the kid, because he was obviously oblivious to the error and that made him all the sadder. It wasn't a licensed shirt or anything just something he'd probably thought was cool and went to a t-shirt shop to have done. But whose fault was it, did he transpose it or did the t-shirt shop? And if it was the t-shirt shop did they charge him full price? Did they even realize their error? Are they responsible for proof-reading or did they give him a discount for the mistake and the kid just figured he'd wear it and no one would notice the difference? He had this really thin terrier-like mustache that covered the corners of his mouth (it looked like it was all that would grow) that made him look even sillier and these heavily lidded, sleepy eyes.

It would take all of Superman's effort not to glibly chuckle upon hearing one of them have the ability to elongate his arms to fit into tiny crevices. They seem to be stuck in the era of their creation, 1961, when optimum space and combustible fireballs may have been leading issues in science. It is not so fantastic, indeed a little silly, to watch Mr. Fantastic's deformed rubberized ability, a handy trick should you drop your keys down a sewer drain, but hardly the stuff of jumping tall buildings in a single bound. The comic book superhero movie genre has grown a bit tired, and THE FANTASTIC FOUR does little to elevate it's status, with a cramped visual style, a fault in many comic adaptations, using the tall building metropolis backdrop so often, it looks like it never leaves the same city street. Yet, as a kiddie toy movie, the tongue in cheek here, so firmly planted in a fun time, delivers a quick and enjoyable romp of supporting players in the comic book hall of fame. Ioan Goufudd, as Reed, or Mr. Fantastic is remarkably in tune to the bland dynamics of the leading hero, and Michael Chiklis, as The Thing, a sort of cross between The Incredible Hulk, The Michlin Man, and The Adams Family's Uncle Fester, offers a thoughtful, riotously funny interpretation of the reluctant monster.",1145059200,,1383,4.695473251028806

Part of the fun of seeing a comic book made into a movie is seeing how close the filmmakers can get to the original material. But when they get arrogant and think they can do better than the creators ( STAN ""THE MAN"" LEE & JACK ""KING"" KIRBY), that's when comic book movies fall flat on their over-produced asses. Seriously, all the prints of this movie should be tracked down and destroyed. The only things saving it are the very hot, Jessica Alba as Sue Storm and Michael Chiklis (as the THING). The real weak points here are: the story and the acting.

First, there's Doctor Doom. Since when did Doom go into space with the others and get super powers? His power is a combination of science & sorcery. Not cosmic rays. And since when does he have an American accent? Or have a big corporation? He's the tyrannical leader of Latveria. Duh! Most of the acting here is also really bad. As I said, Michael Chiklis is pretty much the only good thing this movie has going for it. This piece of junk ""adaptation"" is just a bunch FX and not much else.

1552565,2,B00005JNTU,"""Fantastic Four"" is a science fiction/fantasy flick based on the comic strip of the same name. When I first heard about this film last summer, I was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't heard anything about the Fantastic Four in more than twenty years and I assumed everyone in Hollywood and elsewhere had forgotten about this comic strip decades ago.

I was never a huge fan of the Fantastic Four comics but I did read them on occasion so I have a good idea what the strip was all about. When I watched this movie, I immediately began to make comparisons between the comics and the film, looking for accuracies, similarities, and things to criticize. From what I saw in the movie, it is mostly an accurate duplication of the comic strip as far as the characters go and the general plot. You have the same basic ""superheroes"" and the same transformation problem/concern. Most of it matches the comic strip, with a few minor differences. This should satisfy those who were old fans of the comic strip since the movie seems to follow the same general path.

I appreciate the director's attention to the comic strip's original premise, but there are several things about Fantastic Four that prevent it from being the entertaining movie it was meant to be. Chief among these is the flat story and even flatter characters. The story is pretty much lifeless and dull, with the Fantastic Four trying to find a way to reverse the effects of the cosmic rays so they can return to normal while Dr. Doom continues his increasingly evil plot. There isn't much more to it than that, and much of it moves along at a slow pace- far less exciting than some of the other comic strip inspired films of late, like Spiderman.

With the characters, Ioan Gruffuth's is boring and forgettable. Jessica Alba seems miscast in this role, but it is easy to understand why she was chosen for the part (to give the film some sex appeal). Chris Evans' character is idiotic and continuously tosses out lame one- liners in an attempt to be funny. The only character that is memorable is that of Ben Grimm, who is played by actor Michael Chiklis. He plays ""The Thing""- the big, super- strong character with a body made of rocks. His character is the only one among the four with even a minimal amount of depth. He is also the only one who cannot transform himself back to his original human form (The others can turn their super power on and off) and he hates the predicament he is in. His bitter, grumpy attitude stands out among the four characters and he is the only one among them that will solicit any type of feeling from the viewer. His girlfriend Debbie- who is played by Laurie Holden- has dumped him all because of his gruesome appearance. A heartbroken Ben is naturally upset, but he does find comfort in another woman named Alicia- who is played by Kerrie Washington. She accepts Ben for what he is, making his life a little more tolerable.

Chiklis' ""The Thing"" character is great for one other reason: The excellent make-up. The people in charge of this part of the film deserve praise for transforming this ordinary actor into a man with a body of stone. He seems just like the character from the comic strip and the attention to detail is amazing. If there is one reason to recommend this film, this would be it. The resemblance to the Thing from the comics is almost creepy.

Another thing this film lacks is sufficient action. There are a few scenes where the Fantastic Four get to flex their muscles, but they are few and far between. For example, the Thing has a scene where he saves a man from getting killed by stopping a truck on a bridge with his bare hands. This is one of a handful of action scenes that are decently made and memorable. But they are not nearly enough, and most of the film drags along.

Overall, this film will appeal most to those who were huge fans of the comic strip who will appreciate the fact that the director kept true to the majority of the comic's premise. Doom is different from the comic strip and other things are slightly different too. But this movie fails for other reasons; namely its slowness, lack of action, the shallowness of most of the cast, and the flatness of the story. It's a generally forgettable film that will erase itself completely from memory (except for the Thing character) a short time after viewing.",1143504000,10,4340,4.579150579150579
1552566,1,B00005JNTU,"Some movies are just made for pure entertainment and I understand that and that is why I rented this movie.

So from that an obvious questions come up:

1. Was I entertained?

Answer is 'bearly', there where times while watching the DVD that i wanted to turn it off... the reason I didn't turn it off was because i wanted to see if it would get much worse or any better (my curiosity got the best of me).

Overall I can watch numerous pictures for special effects, however i do expect some kind of corherent story that's not bombarded with blantent advertising.

The characters where one dementional, bland (or over zealous) and predictible.

The story was forced (understandibly to fit it all in, if that was the case) but the main story was side tracked by lot's of sub-plots which didn't really add to picture as a whole and could have been left out or replaced. Not of mention the TONS of holes in the story that i usually over look if the action film is good enough.

The special effects - pretty good they seemed to take there time using the effects however some effects looked 'cartoony' and some looked more natural. I understand that this film came from a comic so the 'cartoony' effets like (Mr. Fantastic's streatching arm under the door) seem to fit, its just gets me when they try to jump back and forth between the 'realistic' ones and the 'cartoony' ones.

Sound - probably the saving grace of this movie and which allows me to even give it one star. The sound design was superb which enabled me to believe and engage in the action scenes.

I understand a lot of people liked this movie and it does have some re-deeming features but overall it is a bad movie and should be rated as such to not fool other people who are depending on a honest review.",1143331200,,1764,4.436532507739938

But, when compared to the 1994 version which was eighty percent done and then scraped; you have to enjoy this version for it's special effects and for a collection of comic characters that stick together like a dysfunctional famliy struggling to get along. It was about average, I say. What I did like is the fact that they didn't make the THING all CGI becuase that would have been a total downer for me. I've only read a few fantastic four comics but not enough to get me, exucse the ill-timed pun, fired up about any of the stories. However, this movie holds the attention of many people who never read the comics but creates a rough patch to the giant masses of FANTASTIC FOUR followers. They complain that Doctor Doom was portrayed wrongly in this feature. I'd say that at least they didn't get the wrong man for the job.

1552638,1,B00005JNTU,"As a quick idea of where this movie ranks with me, if I had the choice of sitting in a room with nothing to do but scratch my butt and twiddle my thumbs or watching this monstrosity again; I would gladly walk into the room knowing it would be less of a waste of time.  Anyways, for the review.  I knew when I saw this movie's previews that it was just going to be another dumb action ""blockbuster"" (read: absolute waste of the last 75 million spent). But, since I worked at a movie theatre, I figured I may as well see it for free and simply set my expectations very very low.

  Well, somehow this movie did not even meet those.  If there had been even a trace of a cast that interacted well, or plot that was more than threadbare, or maybe even if it was just lots of great special effects and good action I would have been happy. Instead I saw plenty of effects, but for what? As we all found out with the star wars prequels, cgi doesnt ensure a great movie.  And this one was no different. F4 made an attempt to latch on to a few sub-plots (who wins the girl wonder, how their super powers affected their loved ones, and who the bigger science genius is) all of them were quite boring and unconvincing as the rest of the flick.  At one point, on a big action scene on a bridge, there is a giant car wreck and only our heros can save them! Oh... but wait, it seems that a group of cop cars have teleported themselves IN FRONT of all the congested traffic. Man, I wish my car could skip mile long traffic jams! Suspension of disbelief falls apart when I am forced to use it so long there is nothing TO believe. Well, my favorite character is the flame.

To start the special effects are pretty bad and don't compare to any other movies of it's type. The cast at first glance seems to be acceptable, Chikilis and the guy from Nip/Tuck Jessica Alba is the only flaw i don't care she may be hot but her acting skill is comparable to Paul Walker. But the script is pretty terrible even the good actors struggle to make anything out of thier lines. The story is stupid and about 75% of the movie is a snorefest and the final act is just cliche and stupid in every way.

1552737,4,B00005JNTU,"I've been reading comics for over 40 years. I have a complete run of the Fantastic Four, including two copies of issue number 1. It's been my favorite comic book since I started reading them. I've been disappointed in some of the Marvel franchise movies, such as Hulk, Daredevil, and Electra. I've also been very pleased with some of them, Spider-Man and X-Men in particular. I think the FF adaptation was very good. Much better than DD, Hulk and Electra, and maybe one notch below Spider-Man and X-Men.

The movie changed, somewhat, the origin of the FF, but essentially they were true to its spirit. The FF was one of the first comic book's to give its characters 3 dimensional personalities and real-life problems. This was novel in the 1960's when the premiere comic books were the ""cartoony"" Superman and Batman. The personality development has always been an integral part of the FF franchise. I think the movie captured the personalities very well.

The special effects were very good, perhaps not awesome, but very good - again, better than some, not quite as good as others. There have been some complaints about the costume of the Thing. I thought the costume was great. And the special effects for the Torch were also great.

I'm hoping that the movie generated enough revenue for a sequel. I think both the Spider-man and X-Men sequels were better than the originals. I'm hoping the same will be true of the FF. The producers have to spend a lot of time introducing characters in the first movie because many movie-goers will not be familiar with the comic book. Once the introductions are made, the sequels have more time for other developments. Overall, I rate this movie B+",1141689600,4,1688,4.773972602739726

  Briefly, something goes wrong in space. The five principals are over exposed to radiation causing them to mutate. Each aquires a super power. The villian, Victor von Doom (really) is turning into metal & aquiring magnetic powers. Jessica Alba, is Susan Storm can become invisible & create a force field. Reed, is the leader, a genius & has aquired extreme flexibility, i.e. ""rubber man"". He's in love with Susan & is basically a dork. Michael Chiklis is Ben, ""the thing"" is really built, has super-human strength & a wry sense of humor. Johnny Storm is Susan's younger brother & enjoys being the  ""human torch"" & learning how to fly. He is horny & juvenile. On that note, I don't agree with the PG-13 rating. This is a kid movie. Jessica strips down to her skivvies once but that is actually funny not erotic. She has to take her clothes off because they do not become invisible. You don't see anything else because she is ah... invisible. Reed works in a lab to return them back to normal. Von Doom doesn't cooperate, as he enjoys his power & being a freak. So the good guys fight him & have adventures in New York City. They defeat him but don't kill him. He is merely neutralized to reappear, in the sequel of course. It's not as good as Spiderman or Batman but it's not trying to be. It's just what you see & no more & that's okay.",1141171200,4,1603,4.501718213058419

Usually these films are sequels that just play off of old jokes or old themes (Scary Movie 3 for instance).  However, the Fantastic Four is not a sequel, but it does suck the life away from the superhero genre.  Everything in this movie feels so tired and so overdone that I could not be entertained by this movie.  The acting is bad, the special effects are cheesey, and I agree with Richard Roeper: who the hell's idea was it to make Jessica Alba the Invisible Girl?  I want to see her at all times.  That's the point of sex appeal.  Put Tilda Swinton (not to dog her acting talent) in this role.  The characters seem like they have already been done (for instance the Thing looks quite a bit like the Incredible Hulk, except a little less green).  After movies like Batman Begins and Spiderman 2, you really should read the script and cast better actors before making a film as bad as this.  This is one of the worst superhero movies ever made, and definitely one of the worst movies of the year.  Chris Evans was showing so much potential when he did Cellular, and this movie just sets him back thirty years.  Jessica Alba has never done a good movie, Gruffudd should stick to lesser roles that require less talent, and Chiklis shouls stick with The Shield.

1552744,1,B00005JNTU,"This movie was just bad.  Reaaaally bad.  It wasn't even bad, but fun to laugh at.  It was just bad.  The script was terrible, the dialogue was insulting to my intelligence, and the characters were completely one dimensional.  If I had watched it in the theatres, I would have walked out (which would have been a first).  And quite frankly, I'm surprised I watched the whole thing at home.  I think I was just hypnotized at how truly terrible this movie was.

As an example of just how bad it was, I will summarize a particular moment that I just found completely absurd.  After just obtaining his ""super powers"" The Thing gets depressed (since now he looks like a rock, or would if the costume didn't make him look like an actor in a crappy costume) and The Thing decides to hide from his wife (who freaks out when she sees him, who wouldn't?) and stare at the ocean while sitting atop a large bridge.  Then, he sees a young man about to jump off the bridge to kill himself.  The Thing attempts to rescue him, a noble enough effort, but in so doing he destroys a semi, nearly killing the driver inside, destroys half the bridge and causes a massive traffic collision, endangering the lives of hundreds of people.  Everyone no doubt saw this, but yet when he ""saved"" this man, everyone claps, apparently forgetting that he nearly killed several people and endangered the lives of hundreds more, along with destroying half the bridge in the process.  Ridiculous.

If that is not bad enough, when the ""Human Torch"" gains his ""super powers"" which literally sets himself on fire, he is not in the least bit frightened, or even surprised it seems.  He's in a hospital and a nurse takes his tempurature, which is over 200 degrees.  Her reaction?  She says ""wow, you're hot."" And his responce?  ""Yeah, so are you.""  Ha. Ha. Ha.  That is not a human response.  No one in this movie is human, and are all the result of insultingly lazy writing, terrible acting, and painfully corny dialogue that feels like it was written by a two year old.

There was about five minutes of action that was pretty cool watching, but the rest of this movie was complete trash.  There were a lot of great movies in 2005.  Just look at the Oscar nominees.  I wholeheartedly guarentee ALL of them are better than The ""Fantastic"" Four.

2005 was a bad year for movies and this movie is a good sample of the year.  It's kind of bad.

The Fantastic Four was the first real superhero team when it came out as a comic over 40 years past.  Prior to this movie there were some attempts to put it to the big screen.  But the technology was not up to the task.

Now the technology is up to the task and the poor script sinks it.  In the comics the FF were just as much a part of New York as Spiderman.  The Spiderman movies had him as a living part of New York.  However, the FF feels like they are a passing bunch of tourists who do some vandalism and move on.  The Fantastic Four are not really a part of the city.

John Storm is passed as some sort of bad boy extreme skier and thrill junky.  Sue Storm is presented as a sex pot.  Reed Richards is the smart team leader.  Last, Ben Grimm, as the Thing, is the strong man of the team.

The plot is this team flies into a space storm that is changed with cosmic rays and they turn into mutants.  (normal people merely get radiation sickness and die)  Victor Von Doom is on the space ship and he turns into some sort of robot guy, this reviewer was never quite able to figure out what he was.

This Von Doom has the powers of Magneto from the movie X-men.  There is a final fight where the Fantastic Four fights Von Doom and the Fantastic Four wins.  Well, if Von Doom had won would the world be worse?  Would we have universal health insurance?  We don't know and after this movie we may only care that this movie ends

This movie feels like they took pieces from other hero movies and glued it together.  One part Spiderman, two parts X-men, some light science-fiction thrown in and -poof - you have the Fantastic Four.  Please give me $13.95 for this clone, thank you very much.

X-men III comes out in May of 2006 and you will see a real team in action.  If you want to watch a funny superhero team then watch Pixar's ""The Incredibles"", a very good movie.

This movie had all of the right parts.  However, it's just not very fun.  You get the feeling you've seen it all before.

I would not recommend buying this movie.  It will set unused on your shelf after one viewing.

1552836,4,B00005JNTU,"The Fantastic 4 are very close to what they were in the comics (although Reed is far less confident) but Victor Von Doom is very different.  His origin is now the same as the Four and his powers are very different.  He could really have been a new villain altogether.

As this is the first movie, we get the full origin tale as well as an adventure.  Our four heroes were on a space station during a storm and received amazing powers due to genetic changes.  Victor Von Doom is also on the station and receives powers.  First our heroes have to come to grips with their powers as they try to find a way to return to normal.  But their powers become very useful when they realize they have to stop Doom.

The writers did a very good job of transplanting the Four into a modern setting.  Johnny Storm is more of a celebrity than before but it is within bounds.  There were quite a few interesting scenes with Ben Grimm (The Thing) and how his change affects his ability to do things.  Many of these seem to have been taken from another comic hero, Concrete, but still fit.  All in all a pretty good adaptation but I really did not like the changes done to Doom.  He is no longer the honorable villain and is just an evil bad guy.  Still, it is worth checking out if you are a fan of the Four.",1139875200,,1290,4.191056910569106

The biggest reason that this movie was not the success it could have been was a slow plot. The main villain does not really ""come to power"" until about 15 minutes to go. The battle with him is short and boring. Second reason for the mediocrity is the random sequences and sub-plots. What was with the whole motorcycle/X-Games deal? It was a pointless scene, that could have been easily replaced with more plot development. Also, the director looked like he was heading for a sub-plot with Ben Grimm and his wife when she gives him back the wedding ring. I was hoping for a resolution to that, but it never came. Third, this movie followed the whole ""superhero movie"" craze a little to closely. It seemed like the director just took different shots from The Hulk, Spider-Man, etc. and incorporated them into this film. For example, the whole ""villain starts off bad by choking colleague"" thing we saw exactly in Spider-Man.

The film, while a good script (with the exception of the handling of Dr. Doom, who is written as a bland generic neurotic, when the character is a Darth Vader prototype) that attends to detail, the film is ruined by poor casting and worse acting. The only good casting is Evans. Okay, Jessica Alba is hot, but she's just not right for the part of Sue Storm. Who the hell is Ionn Gruffudd and why is such a weak actor cast as Reed, the leader of the group who should be presented as a mature male, a father figure for the group. Chiklis hasn't been able to handle a role since The Commish (and that irritating guy from the Long Island Party Seinfeld), and MacMahon has no personna to bring to the role of Doom. The direction is also generic and should have played up the Kirbyesque elements of the comic. In short, this film should only be watched for free, while high, or lobotomized.

Reed Richards, an MIT alum and former classmate of Victor, presents Victor with a proposal to send himself, Sue, Ben, Johnny, and Victor into space to study human DNA.  Victor, who owns a billion-dollar company, agrees to finance the mission and accompany Reed and his crew on their journey.  Their destination is a space station, where they will conduct their experiments.  However, a strange gaseous cloud is moving toward the station.  Originally given hours to conduct their experiment, the cloud suddenly increases its speed and is on top of the station in a matter of minutes.  All five members are exposed to cosmic radiation from the cloud.

Upon returning to earth, everything seems normal for a while.  However, each person begins to notice physical changes; Johnny begins finding that he can make a flame by snapping his thumb, Sue realizes that she can disappear, Reed finds that his body can now stretch in ways it never could before, but Ben's new ""ability"" is most noticable.  He now looks like a giant orange rock-like figure.  He even frightens his beloved wife Debbie away.  Victor, who's company stock has went into free-fall due to the failed mission, has been given one week to turn his company around by his investors.  He also begins to show signs of change.

The group's first public exposure occurs on the Brooklyn Bridge.  Ben is sitting on its railing when a would-be suicide jumper approaches.  Ben tries to talk to the man, but it only frustrates the jumper more.  Soon, the man is hanging onto a cable above the roadway, but eventually loses his grip and falls into oncoming traffic.  This starts a chain-reaction collision.  Ben, meanwhile, is trying to get through the mess of wrecked vehicles when a fire truck slams on its brakes and sends its rear section flying over the edge of the bridge.  Using his now incredible strength, he manages to pull the truck back to safety, while Reed uses his elactic arms to rescue a falling firefighter.  After this show of bravery, the local media give the group the name ""Fantastic 4"".

Meanwhile, Victor is still seething over the loss of his company.  He blames Reed for messing up the mission.  Even Sue, Victor's girlfriend and Reed's ex, has apparently went back to Reed. As time passes, Victor becomes obsessed with gaining revenge against the Fantastic 4 and his former investors who have betrayed him.  His powers continue to get stronger, and his body is beginning to turn metallic in color.

Reed has begun work on a machine that will reverse the effects of the cosmic cloud and restore everyone's DNA back to normal.  However, he is encountering problems, and Ben is losing his patience.  Using Ben's weakness as a possible way to get back at the Fantastic 4, Victor tells Ben that he has already completed his own machine.  Intrigued, Ben allows Victor to try to reverse his effects. Will Victor's machine work?  Will Victor destroy the Fantastic 4?

I thought this was a great movie.  The story is well conceived and the plot is great.  Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, and Julian McMahon are terrific in their roles, and the special effects are out of this world.  I wasn't sure how good this movie would be due to some of the poor reviews it received, but after watching it, I rate it very highly.

Soon-to-be-legend Stan ""The Man"" Lee and already established comic art legend Jack Kirby delivered an imaginitive, if a little far fetched, premise.  Since the, several attempts have been made at adapting this amazing world, rarely with much luck.  I'm sad to say that, in this long-time comic fan's mind, this version doesn't approach meeting my minimum expectations.

The plot is relatively close to the comic book origin of the characters.  In this incarnation, Reed Richards, a brilliant scientist, and his lifeling friend and pilot Ben Grimm are trying to fund a space mission during which they hope to harness some sort of cosmic energy.  They go to Reed's old rival Victor von Doom for financial backing.  Victor controls a vast company, and he employs Reed's ex-girlfriend, Susan Storm, also a brilliant scientist.  Victor agrees to the mission, provided he can go as well.  Susan's younger brother Johnny, a hyperactive frat-boy, goes along as well.  As the energy storm passes through the ship, all are changed at a molecular level, each in different ways.  Susan can become invisible, Reed can stretch, Ben has turned into a 'gruesome' rock creature, Johnny can 'flame,' and Victor is evil and magnetic.  Action (supposedly) ensues.

The problem that I have with this movie is that the characters are flat, with the exception of Ben Grimm, who would be better is his makeup effects weren't horrible.  Johnnny Storm strikes the right note, as played by Chris Evans, but Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba are sorely miscast.  Alba is vey hot, but I can't buy her as a 'brilliant scientist.'  Julian McMahon doesn't have much to do with Dr. Doom, so he hams it up.  What else could he do?  The character wasn't even supposed to be on the ship in the first place!

He did come to grips with himself, however.  He realized how his powers could be a blessing to him and everyone else.  If you are looking for major action scenes and battles, there aren't too many.

1553018,5,B00005JNTU,"""The Fantastic Four"" were my favorite superheros of all time growing up. I don't know if it was their wonderful teamwork, or the fact that their individual flaws and personal conflicts made them seem more real, but whatever it was, I truly loved reading their comic books.

When ""The Lord of the Rings"" were so vividly brought to the big screen by Peter Jackson, this was a childhood dream come true. Now, under the direction of Tim Story, the Fantastic Four movie has fulfilled another dream of mine.

Clearly neither the Fantastic Four story, or the movie version, is anywhere in the league of The Lord of the Rings. And I must also say that the greatest of the recent stream of Marvel Comics-based movies that's been made so far is Spiderman 2. However, the Fantastic Four is a film that gives just the right take on these characters, giving us much fun and adventure without taking itself too seriously.

The casting seems perfect. Coming in, I didn't know much about either Ioan Gruffudd (who plays Mr. Fantastic), or Chris Evans (who plays The Human Torch), but both expertly captured the nature of their characters. Chris Evans, in fact, with his daredevil playboy portrayal of Johnny Storm, is a major factor in the success of this movie. Michael Chiklis, of the Fox Network show ""The Shield"" is a wonderful Ben Grimm (The Thing), and Jessica Alba (Dark Angel, Sin City, Into the Blue), is just great to see in anything, but does an exceptional turn as Sue Storm. Casting Julian McMahon (Nip/Tuck) as the arch-nemesis Victor von Doom was a stroke of genius, and I've been a huge fan of his since his days on the tv show ""Charmed"" as the conflicted half demon Cole. No one does the smoldering, ""evil-lurking-just-beneath-the-surface"" type better.

As Michael Chiklis says in Jessica Alba's behind the scenes Video Diary (one of the extras on the DVD), it's hard when doing the first, or ""origin"" movie because you have to cover all of the backstory of the characters in an hour and a half film. And although I thought they pulled it off very well in this first movie in what I'm sure will result in at least one to two more, I'm very anxious for the sequel. Hopefully it'll be worthy of ten stars.",1137542400,4,2204,4.643589743589744

But on the other hand, if not, my best friend and I wouldn't have laughed at it's complete stupidity (hence why I give it 2 stars for at least it gave us something to make fun of).

1553020,1,B00005JNTU,"Did we really need this movie? Or, to be more specific, did we really need another hastily-done, poorly executed superhero movie? And if so, did we have to sacrifice the legendary Fantastic Four to make it? Why couldn't this have been a lame movie about Iron Man, or the Avengers or the Metal Men or the Doom Patrol? Why did they have to degrade the poor FF?

Hey, I'd normally be the first guy to champion an FF movie adaptation. I've always liked the characters, the stories were grand, the villains were excellent and there was some excellent dialogue already written. I'm even ok with minor changes and updates in most cases - I barely flinched when Spidey's web shooters were made 'organic'. But, as with so many horrific film adaptions of good books, if the film is going to throw away everything that made the book great, why even bother licensing the book in the first place? Starship Troopers showed us that Hollywood can make awful movies out of brilliant source material and The Incredibles showed us that brilliant concepts can be translated to the screen without the need for licensing. So what happened here?

The Fantastic Four were (along with Spider-Man) some of the first 'real' comic book characters ever. They were a family who bickered like real families, had their own human problems and were completely antithetical to the God-on-Earth superheroes prevalant at the time. They had well-established characters with rational motivations and consistent beliefs. Ben always hated his transformation and resented Reed's part in turning him into the Thing. Johnny was the hot-head who caused trouble, but always backed up his family in the end. Sue was the defender of the family who worked hard to keep the team together. Reed was the absent-minded professor whose genius could solve any problem - once you managed to make him pay attention. Doom was the tortured megalomaniac that hated Reed's success and intellect and was obsessed with destroying him. So what does Hollywood give us?

Doom is a successful yuppie, Reed is an ineffectual, indecisive nitwit, Ben VOLUNTEERS to become the Thing and Johnny couldn't care less about his family. I mean, come on. Doom's 'organic' armor and electrokinesis (huh?) I can grudgingly accept, but Ben's willingness to turn back into the Thing invalidates forty years of characterization.

Ok, so you don't care about any of this because you don't read comics. So what won't you like about this movie? Well, if you want action be prepared to be bored. Nothing of any significance happens until the last fifteen minutes. Oh, there's an action scene on a bridge, but it's pretty lame stuff and (despite the ridiculous, instant hero-worship) it's a problem CAUSED by the FF. Special effects? Johnny looks pretty good and Sue's force fields are ok, but neither gets more than a couple of minutes of screen time. Ben's costume is about as good as makeup is likely to get - awful, in other words. And as for poor Reed...well, why did they even bother making this movie if they weren't going to show super powers? Reed's abilities are always happening just slightly off-screen. We get a few very fast flashes of stretching and everything else is some sort of disembodied limb that looks fake. It's obvious that they never came up with a good way to create the stretching powers and just faked it with crappy CGI that would have made Harryhausen ashamed.

Oh, were you looking for plot? Sorry. You have 90% of the movie rehashing the origin stories, 5% wasted on a tedious Reed & Sue romance subplot and the final 5% involves a lame showdown with Doom who pretty much goes nuts and decides to kill the FF for no good reason. Where's Galactus when you need him?

If you get the chance to watch the last 15 minutes of this movie for free, enjoy. Otherwise, ignore this waste of time and watch The Incredibles instead.",1137369600,8,3864,4.811746987951807

For one thing, the heroes of the movie recieved amazing powers and acting like there was no big deal. The human torch for example, was setting his sun on fire just to impress women. Also, the Thing has nothing to say but ""I'm the Thing now. Hmmm what a bummer"". Another flaw is that the fantastic four seem to be causing most of the trouble, and people are applauding them.

One more flaw, why is Jessica Alba the invisible girl? That is a horrible move to make. I want to see her at all times.

The movie may be called the Fantastic Four, but this movie isn't even close to fantastic. In fact, this is one of the worst movies of 2005.",1137283200,2,781,4.1655629139072845
1553022,3,B00005JNTU,"The 2005 film ""Fantastic Four"", directed by Tim Story (who directed ""Barbershop"" in 2002), was based upon a group of superhero characters of the same name that were created in 1961 for Marvel Comics by Jack Kirby (1917-1994) and Stan Lee. The film's plot, written by Michael France and Mark Frost, is about how five individuals survive a horrific radiation exposure in space.  The scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and his friend/assistant Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis, who won a Golden Globe in 2003 for his work in the TV series ""The Shield"", and has been nominated again twice in 2004 & 2005 for the same) approach the very wealthy billionaire Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon, who has received a 2005 Golden Globe nomination for his work in the TV series ""Nip/Tuck"") for funding to explore Reed's theory of stellar radiation clouds affecting DNA and causing it to evolve.  Victor is initially reluctant, but decides to fund the project as long as he receives a very large portion of any profits resulting from the work.  The woman that Victor loves, who is also one of his employees, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba, who received a Golden Globe nomination in 2001 for her work in the short-lived TV series ""Dark Angel""), becomes involved in the project.  She and Reed had previously been romantically involved with one another.  Her brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), is an experienced pilot that will pilot the shuttle from Earth to Victor's space station in orbit above the Earth where Reed's experiment will be conducted.  On board the space station and preparing for the arrival of highly-charged cloud of stellar gases, Ben is carries out a space walk to install plant specimens outside of the radiation-proof space station; but Reed discovers that the cloud of stellar material will arrive in a matter of minutes, not hours as had previously been projected. Ben attempts to get back into the safety of the space station, but is exposed to the intense radiation of the cloud, as are Reed, Sue, Johnny and Victor (who also went on the trip).  The five return to Earth.  Victor doesn't believe that he was exposed, but the others clearly were and are kept in quarantine for a while. It is during their quarantine that Reed, Sue and Johnny discover that they have acquired some amazing powers: Sue can become invisible, Reed can stretch like a rubber band and Johnny has become a human torch.  Ben, who received the greatest exposure, transforms into a monstrous-sized super-human, but no longer looks particularly human.  Upset, Ben leaves Victor's quarantine facility to speak with his girlfriend, but when she sees what he has become, she no longer wants anything to do with him.  Seeing Ben so upset, Reed comes up with a plan to artificially recreate the conditions of their accident in an effort to reverse the effects of the radiation.  In the meantime, Victor's finances are not doing well as his board of directors is ready to shut down his company, which is rapidly losing value.  Also, Victor, who thought he was protected on board the space station, is instead also starting to transform into something less than human; but unlike the other four, his motivations are far more egocentric.  Thus, the Fantastic Four comes into being, as does their main nemesis, who decides to go after the Fantastic Four whom he in part blames for his current financial downturn.

With its special effects, ""Fantastic Four"" is visually impressive, but Tim Story's lack of directorial experience, as well as lackluster writing (writer Michael France received a Razzie nomination for Worst Screenplay for his work in the 1993 film ""Cliffhanger""), made for wooden & one-dimensional characters that failed to capture the interest of many people in the audience.  Thus, I can only rate the 2005 film ""Fantastic Four"" with 3 out of 5 stars.  Maybe the film's sequel that is planned for release in 2007 will be better.",1137283200,,3908,4.914893617021277
1553023,4,B00005JNTU,"I decided to take a chance on the Fantastic Four film since it had such mixed reviews. Let me say that while it could've been better, it wasn't as bad as some reviews pegged it to be! Hell, it was at least better than HULK!

Ioan Gruffnudd and Jessica Alba doesn't seem to quite fit into their roles as Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) and Sue Storm (Invisible Woman). Its like they are brushing at it but don't quite hit the mark (though I have to admit I DID enjoy seeing Alba in her undies for a brief period during that Brooklyn Bridge scene)!

On the other hand, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) and Michael Chickles as Ben Grimm (The Thing) were dead on! In fact, they pretty much make this film! Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom was okay but I didn't feel like it was quite him for some reason.

And I have to say, I actually found this MARVEL film to be funnier than the others, even the Spider-Man films (which I enjoyed emmensily)! Rating it against the other MARVEL joints, it falls short of both Spider-Man films, the first Blade film, and both X-Men films. It ties with Daredevil(uncut version) and the second Blade film and The Punisher (new version) but is far better than HULK, the third Blade film and Elektra!

Minor Quibbles:

As a FF comic fan, I was disappointed by Dr Doom.  His whole persona was invented to keep the movie short, and he was a little more like Richie Rich than Dr Doom who I chose to remember as a frightening and powerful persona, more than a match for any of the Marvel heroes.

I think its annoying that Reed and Sue were reverse-aged so they could cast Jessica Alba as Sue, and have a premarital romance in the story.  I always thought it was cool that they were middle-aged heroes.  Alba looks good, but a blond Angelina Jolie or Natasha Henstridge might have been a little more formidable. Alba seemed like a cheerleader type.  The other actors were fine for the most part.

They look and act exactly the way they did in the comics!

All this and Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon) too! FANTASTIC!!

Note: Forget about all the negative reviews and the criticism about the one-dimensionality of the characters. Excuse me, but isn't this supposed to be based on a comic book? If you want depth watch an Ingmar Bergman film.",1137024000,6,795,4.838235294117647
1553097,4,B00005JNTU,"I own FF comics from the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's. My first favorite comic as a kid was Fantastic Four; my favorite superhero was The Thing and my favorite villain was Doctor Doom. I was naturally looking foward to this film version.

The casting is one of the highlights. I admit that I had my doubts regarding Jessica Alba as Sue Storm and especially Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards, but Alba does a fine job and Gruffudd was very much on the mark as ""Mr. Fantastic"" (giggle).  As for the Human Torch and The Thing, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis are truly outstanding in their respective roles.

What we have to understand is that the film is the ORIGIN story, so the characters are all relatively young here. Reed & Ben are probably only about thirty years old at this time (or slightly older), Sue is in her mid-twenties and Johnny is in his early twenties. Needless to say, don't expect to see a depiction of the Fantastic Four from issue #555!

Some have also complained that The Thing is missing his notable rocky eyebrow but, once again, the story takes place when they first get their powers. Those of us who know our FF history know very well that he had no defining eyebrow back then. Only as he mutated over time did the eyebrow appear.

What has always separated the Fantastic Four from other comic heros is that they're a FAMILY; and all the character hallmarks of this family are wonderfully depicted in this film: Johnny & Ben's fighting, Hothead's likable show off-ness and arrogance, Reed's great intellect yet total lack of common-sense social skills, The Thing's grumbling struggle over being a monster and outcast, Reed's obsessive attempts to give The Thing back his humanity, as well as his attempts to restrain Ben when he has an understandable temper tantrum, Sue & Johnny's sister/brother bickering, etc.

Other notable FF hallmarks are present as well: The Baxter Building, Victor Von Doom, Latveria and Ben's blind girlfriend Alicia Masters. Heck, even mailman Willie Lupkin is here, naturally played by FF creator Stan Lee. Also, Sue Storm's original hero moniker ""the Invisible GIRL"" is even poked fun at.

Doctor Doom is perhaps the greatest comics villain of all-time and they picked a very fitting actor for the role, Julian McMahon. As for the idea of linking Doom's origin with the FF members, I don't personally mind this, minor changes are naturally to be expected when changing mediums. Where they went wrong, however, was to fail to show Victor become truly scarred and hideous -- the very reason he came to create and wear the mask and armor. Yes, there was a little scarring but it wasn't enough.

Doom's costume is hit-and-miss: the hood and mask look great but the rest of it deviates too far from his great costume in the comics. Still, this was an acceptable alteration.

In the comics Doctor Doom had a definite diabolical charismatic presence that would give you goosebumps. There's a little bit of this feeling in the film but it's swept away when the good Doctor SPEAKS. Yes, when Doom talks his dialogue and voice are so wimpy and unthreatening that it pretty much ruins the part. These missteps with the character of Doctor Doom are the sole reasons I give the film 4 Stars instead of 5.

Some criticize that the material isn't serious enough, and maybe the creators did go a little overboard here and there with a bit of zaniness, but the overall tone is serious. Make no mistake, although there is a lot of humor (which is an essential part of life), this is not a campy jokefest. People must understand that the FF are a very colorful, fun group of superheroes; they're not dark like Daredevil or Batman. Hence, ""Fantastic Four"" is a fittingly fun, colorful and brisk film, yet it remains an essentially serious story.

One thing I fail to comprehend is the ridiculous bashing this film has received. ""Fantastic Four"" is every bit as good as ""X-Men"" which came out in 2000; both films are about the origin of a superhero team. Have we been so spoiled by the great superhero films since then (e.g. Spider-Man 1 & 2, X-Men 2, Daredevil Director's cut, Batman Begins, etc.) that we can no longer recognize or appreciate what is truly a fine comic film? If ""Fantastic Four"" came out in 2000 before ""X-Men"" it would have been deemed a superhero masterpiece.

So many people rave about how great ""Spider-Man 2"" is, and it is a very well-done superhero film, but what about that stupid subplot regarding Peter losing his spider-powers because of his lack of confidence? Since when did Peter's spider-powers depend on his confidence? His powers were derived from a radioactive spider bite; hence, his powers would not come-and-go depending on his confidence level! I'm just pointing out that, as good as ""Spider-Man 2"" is, it is not without its flaws.

BOTTOM LINE: This is a good and fun film verion of the Fantastic Four. The missteps with Doctor Doom are its only real shortcomings. If you like or love the Fantastic four, or just have a casual interest in them, you'll likely enjoy this flick. If not, why are you reading this?",1136764800,3,5079,4.725423728813559
1553098,4,B00005JNTU,"When I finally got around to watching Fantastic Four on DVD I was sort of dreading it because of all the poor and mediocre reviews it got.  Luckily I was pleasantly surprised that the film was a good ol' fashioned superhero action flick with quick one-liners and a touching story about relationships, identity, and teamwork.  Granted, the film isn't quite as deep as say, Spider-Man in terms of working the audience's emotions, but the film stays faithful to the ""chaotic dysfunctional"" family feel of the comic.  Michael Chiklis as the Thing and Chris Evans as the Human Torch in particular re-enact the big brother/little brother relationship from the comic impeccably.

Some of the weaker points were some of Jessica Alba's acting and Julian McMahon pretty much rehashing his role as Christian Troy from Nip/Tuck, until he got ""zapped"" and became the evil, metal Dr. Doom.  (Also for someone who's supposedly from Lateveria, how come he has no accent?!)

This movie, much like the first X-Men flick seems like an introduction.  A set-up for more films that will explore the characters further and pull us further into their world.  If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced superhero flick, Fantastic Four is a good choice.",1136764800,3,1224,4.995073891625616
1553099,2,B00005JNTU,"Another ill-conceived superhero movie.  THE FANTASTIC FOUR fails on many levels but mainly it is cheesy in its main parts in terms of script, characters, and special effects. Contributing screenwriter Michael France gets the proverbial ""three-strikes-your-out"" for doing anymore screenwriting for superhero movies. He also wrote HULK and THE PUNISHER (which were critical and financial failures). Now France wrote F4.  Jessica Alba is eye candy and many hard-core comic afficionados and critics felt her ""ethnicity"" (masked by her dyed blond hair) along with her cheesecake looks made her all wrong for the Invisible Girl. However, in this reviewer's opinion, she was just too young to play Sue Storm. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/The Human Torch was cited as having the most to do out of a mediocre script, but is annoyingly juvenile throughout the whole film. Ioan Gruffudd plays Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic as an absent-minded professor and his stretching powers were done awful in the film. The only standout character is that of Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing who plays the orange rocky monstrosity with pathos and heart. However, the designers of The  Thing completely left out the trademark ""big brow"" that goes over his eyes so Grimm/Thing wasn't completely faithful to the comics. Couldn't they add it digitally? Lastly, Dr. Doom played by Julian McMahon is a typical no frills comic book villain. The lame scenes in the film are when the four are thrown into New York City crowds and walk around like they are not supposed to get noticed. Then the heroes get annoyed when they are treated as celebrities or approached by the paparazzi and news media. Overall, a lackluster film that isn't fantastic because of a weak script, questionable casting, weak special effects and terrible characterizations.  At least Marvel has the X-MEN and SPIDER-MAN films to compensate for this lackluster showing. Also, if anyone wants to see a better ""Fantastic Four"" film, just watch Pixar's THE INCREDIBLES, which has more heart, story, action, adventure and characterization than this film.",1136764800,4,2095,5.244776119402985
1553100,2,B00005JNTU,"Super hero movies are a category unto themselves, and often prove difficult to review objectively. Some fans of the original comics will just be glad to see their favorite characters portrayed on the big screen. Other fans want strict adherence to the original source material. Those unfamiliar with the source material probably won't care one way or the other, but will criticize aspects of the movie they see as silly. What takes place in the pages of a comic or within the world of animation doesn't always translate well to live action. It's especially hard to judge such a movie correctly, in the face of all these compounding factors.

For me, I didn't care much for this film adaptation of Stan Lee's famous super-hero team. But I'll do more than tell you it sucks, I'll tell you why I think it sucks so you can decide for yourself if it's worth seeing.

First of all, there were numerous changes to original storyline. This almost always takes place, whether adapting a book or a comic to Hollywood, but I really resent the way Hollywood can take a popular comic series and shamelessly alter it to better-appeal to their target audience. In the comic Mr. Fantastic is married to the Invisible Woman, and they (at least to me) appear considerably older than they do in the movie. It seems as if Hollywood saw fit to reduce the ages of the characters, probably in an effort to appeal to younger audiences, and had the main characters unwed so they could throw in a sad attempt at a romantic angle. I'm sorry, but I hate the fact that they felt the need to throw in a love triangle where one previously did not exist. And the invisible woman looked nothing like Jessica Alba. This is just an example of Hollywood saying ""well wouldn't it be better if the characters were all hot young people with some kind of unresolved relationship issue?""

Furthermore the source material is further betrayed by the complete rewriting of Dr. Doom, the arch nemesis of the 4. In the comics he is a super-genius, who is usually only outsmarted by Mr. Fantastic due to his arrogance and ego; and he is also a sorcerer. I see how the latter of these was omitted, as it would complicate the plot mechanics and also be somewhat harder for audiences to take seriously, but to have a Dr. Doom that isn't a genius defeats the purpose. Doom is now portrayed as a business man, and although it's suggested he has above average intelligence, this has no place in the plot, and Reed is depicted as being of far superior intellect. His character is also very shallow, with a very flimsy explanation for his transition to evil, and practically no character depth at all. The character was so flat, it's really sad.

The other characters were also fairly flat, and the storytelling dimension of the movie was very poor. The exception to this is with The Thing, who has a good subplot over his hideous transformation. Michael Chiklis is also the only decent case of acting in this whole movie. The rest of the acting is sup par and unengaging, not that there was much plot or depth for the actors to really work with. Poor dialogue plagues the film, and some of the original lines from the comics that were kept ""it's clobberin' time"" and ""flame on"" are difficult to watch real actors say without chuckling.

That's not to say that this movie has no redeeming qualities. The special effects are cool, and there are a number of comical moments in the movie that were done well. Indeed one thing that the movie has going for it is that it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously, which makes some of the aforementioned points more forgivable to the right viewer. However one big problem is how FAKE The Thing looks! They used a prosthetic body suit instead of CGI effects here, and unfortunately, it comes off looking quite unrealistic and silly. This was a major blow for me, as every time I saw his character I felt like I was watching a comedy as opposed to a serious action film.

The only thing really worth seeing here are the special effects. Which might make you assume there'd be plenty of action in this movie! But you'd be wrong. There wasn't much action at all. There's really only one major fight scene, that being the climactic battle with Dr. Doom, which was pretty unimpressive. This movie was not intense at all, and had more laughs than it did wows. And the one really saving grace of this movie is they manage to have a number of very humorous scenarios relating to the heroes' respective powers. Unfortunately not all the laughter was intended.

But a few laughs and some cool effects doesn't cut it enough for me to take my attention away from the major problems of this movie. But to be fair, I tend to be critical of this genre anyway, so fans of the genre should see this movie for themselves as make up their own minds. Let me put it this way, Spiderman was better. Those who aren't big super-hero movie fans, be cautioned. And obviously, if you aren't a fan of super-heroes at all, you should think twice and try to watch with a very light heart.

1553183,1,B00005JNTU,"""Holy anal leakage, Batman!"" -- what Robin would say about ""Fantastic Four""

That may be a reference to the wrong movie in question, but after seeing this pukebucket excuse of a movie, a shot-by-shot remake of the 1966 ""Batman"" doesn't sound like that bad of an idea. Nearly fifty years after the Fatastic...sorry...Fantastic Four made their debut on the Marvel comics, filmmakers have stapled together what has to be the lamest and most pathetic superhero movie in history. Come to think of it, you can't really call ""Fantastic Four"" a superhero movie. The movie has failed to convince me that these four are superheroes.

Something you need to consider is the exaggeration by the MPAA with the word ""intense"" right in the middle of the organization's reasoning. I can understand that they are probably rating this movie with the awareness that little kids can only take so much, but get a load of this. According to the MPAA web site, ""Spider-Man 2"" is rated PG-13 for ""stylized action violence."" If this movie is by any means more intense than ""Spider-Man 2,"" then Bugs Bunny should run for president. ""Fantastic Four"" is about as intense as its own lunchbox marketing advertisements.

I should be ashamed for even mentioning ""Spider-Man 2"" while discussing this movie. With Spider-Man and Batman you at least have heroes with semi-serious origins. Peter Parker was bitten by a genetically mutated spider. Exaggeration, but you can buy it. Bruce Wayne witnessed the murder of his parents. Arguably the most plausible superhero origin ever. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), siblings Sue (Jessica Alba) and Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), and Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) receive their superpowers when they are sent into space to investigate a mysterious star storm that is lingering near Earth. You would think that NASA would be more concerned as to whether or not the storm is heading towards us.

Study the last names of the film's main charcters and I'll give you fifty points if you guess who the villain is. Reed Richards is Mr. Fantastic, able to stretch his body to immeasurable lengths; Sue Storm is Invisible Woman, who is, well, invisible but is inexplicably able to generate force fields; Johnny Storm is The Human Torch, able to ignite his body at will and also fly at the same time; Ben Grimm is The Thing, a massive, hulking piece of granite that appears to have been vandalized with orange paint.

While his associates dwell in celebrety status, Victor Von Doom, who funded the space mission with billions of dollars, wades in misery. His company is crumbling and his four best friends are sucking up all of the positive attention from the media. Due to the star storm's effects, Doom's entire biophysical structure is in the process of being replaced with titanium alloy, and he becomes able to generate electricity. Also, the internal transformation leads to facial disfigurement, and he resorts to wearing an iron mask. He officially ""becomes"" Dr. Doom with fifteen minutes left in the movie when he finally stops moaning about the success of the Fantastic Four and gets on with destroying them. He even lets us know how many of the four he has taken care of and how many there are left.

Before the climax there is only one small part that can qualify as an action sequence, and that is a rescue mission by the Fantastic Four on a bridge. This gives them their fame and their names. Wow, and are we supposed to care if a fire truck is about to fall over the bridge and The Thing is trying to pull it to safety?

That the first and final showdown between the Fantastic Four and Dr. Doom is exciting doesn't mean that the film has an ounce of value. We all know that superheroes struggle with balancing their everyday lives with their alter egos, but why would you waste your time with a movie in which the superheroes are intent on getting rid of their powers? At least Spider-Man realized that ""with great power comes great responsibility."" The Fantastic Four are a bunch of whiners. They argue and come close to destroying each other before Dr. Doom can actually become a threat.

There are no acceptable performances in Tim Story's film. There are only cardboard cut-outs of wise-cracking superheroes engulfed in cheesy special effects. ""Fantastic Four"" should be apalled by itself when lined up next to the other superhero comic book adaptations released in the past couple of years, even some of the mediocre ones. ""Daredevil,"" ""Hulk,"" and ""X2: X-Men United."" Imperfect films that at least tried to be what they could. This movie is a perfect example of laziness, and my pearl of wisdom to filmmakers is that the four Marx Brothers are the only fantastic four.",1136505600,,4714,4.8472049689441

I was a huge fan of John Byrne's Fantastic Four run, and have enjoyed some of the recent Ultimate Fantastic Four, and there was obvious homage in the script to the characters of old, although I felt it fell just short of nailing them.

The cast was good; I originally had doubts about many of them and was surprised to find Jessica Alba, while not the Sue Storm I would have envisioned, did a good job, with the others ranging from also good to a great casting choice in the Thing. Only Doctor Doom disappointed and neither the character nor presence he needed. An Eastern European with some FX on his voice after he donned the infamous mask would have made all the difference.

The FX in general were great, especially the Thing make-up and Human Torch imaging, really pushing the boundaries (sometimes straining them with the Mister Fantastic shots). The music did not annoy, but did not stand out either.

Not the best of the Marvel adaptations by any stretch (X-Men and Spiderman still hold that distinction), but an enjoyable couple of hours, and something on which a sequel will hopefully improve.

1553185,4,B00005JNTU,"Yes I do deserve to be stabbed in the eye for that title.

Anyway, since I first started reading the Fantastic Four comic books I became an instant fan. Needless to say I was thrilled when I heard that Marvel decided to make a film of it. Was the movie the best comic adaptation? No. The film was a little too flippant at times, using so much comic relief that it was sort of distracting. And I didn't like Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom. He was pretty good before he went evil, but once he was in full Dr. Doom mode, his acting was annoying (the scene when Doom is looking for the Invisible Woman saying ""Marco Polo"" is obnoxious-maybe that kind of acting worked on ""Charmed"" but it shouldn't be happening here Nip/Tuck boy). And why do they have Jessica Alba in those obviously fake blue contact lenses? Perhaps I'm just being picky, but these things were a distraction to me.

However, does this mean that this is a bad comic book movie? Not at all. I found it was fun to watch. The story was all right and the action was great. If they make sequels to it, the set up portion is now out of the way. There is real potential now to focus on a stronger story and sharper character developments that would further enhance the franchise. I certainly hope this will be the case, as this first movie looks like a pretty good start.

1553187,4,B00005JNTU,"When it comes to their characters being adapted for film it seems as if Marvels fortunes have been either hit (Spiderman, X-Men, Blade) or miss (Hulk, Punisher, Daredevil).  The Fantastic Four is a bit of an oddity then...it is squarely in the middle.  A three to four star film with a lot of good and some fair amount of bad.  Directory Tim story and the writers remain pretty faithful to the characters and origins of the characters.  Brilliant Reed Richards leads a team of astronauts into space to study the effects of a cosmic wave.  He's accompanied by his former girl friend Sue Storm, her pilot brother Johnny, and Reeds friend Ben Grimm.  The biggest change to the original origin would be including Victor Von Doom, a wealthy industrialist who is financing the operation as Richards is broke.  The experiment goes awry...the reason for which is never explained...and the group is bombarded by cosmic radiation, which causes each to undergo serious genetic changes.

Of course I'm sure you know what powers each has but for the sake of it...Reed becomes Mr. Fantastic who has the ability to stretch his body to incredible lengths, Sue becomes the Invisible Girl who can become...umm...invisible but also make invisible force fields, Johnny becomes the Human Torch who can turn to flame and fly, and Ben becomes the Thing, with a rock like body and superhuman strength.  Of course the fact that Doom gains powers is the biggest difference from the comics and one that was totally unneeded.  Doom is a genius in his own write and didn't need super powers beyond what his own technology could produce.  Doom (Julian McMahon) basically sets out to get revenge on the Fantastic Four who have become media stars, for ruining his company.  The movie unfortunately builds a bit too slow to its climax and the final showdown with Doom.

Character wise, the group does a great job of capturing the essence of the early comic series.  The brilliant Richards (Ioan Gruffudd)spends his time tinkering away, trying to find a way to reverse the effects of the cosmic rays, and ignoring Sue, his true love.  Johnny (Chris Evans) is the arrogant, young hotshot, basking in the limelight of his new powers, pulling pranks on the thing, and making deals to produce action figures.  Ben (Michael Chiklis) sulks away lamenting how deformed he's become, hiding himself under a hat and large raincoat.  Anyone who read those early adventures in the 1960's will surely remember a lot of these themes.  Only Jessica Alba as Sue seems a bit out of place and it seems she was merely chosen to be eye candy and yet the blond hair just doesn't look right on her and she looks too young.  The Doom character is the weak link in the film.  They simply did not give him the time to develop and his inclusion in the original space accident comes off as pretentious.

The effects are quite well done and don't try and over shadow the picture they way they do in many of these Summer action films.  They were comicly real without being over the top.  Kudos to Story for creating The Thing merely with makeup and appliances and not CGI as they did with the Hulk.  Chiklis brought the kind of humanism to the role of The Thing that always came across so strongly in the stories by Stan Lee (who makes a cameo as Willie Lumpkin, the mailman).  This would not have worked as well if the character had been generated by CGI.

I will also say I was somewhat disappointed by the DVD set.  With the great 2 disc sets we got for Spiderman and X-men, I would have like to have seen Marvel's original group of heroes get better treatment on the DVD.  The extras are fine but not nearly enough.

1553189,4,B00005JNTU,"Say Fantastic Four to most people on the planet and they'll say, ""What? Who?""

Say Batman and everyone nods.

The Fantastic Four was the first comic that Marvel Comics produced in the early 1960's. It preceded Spiderman and the XMen. Even so, it has remained largely a comic fan's comic book, considered somewhat unaccessible by the public at large. Why? Well, I have my own thoughts, but I'm sure they're just my own. Suffice it to say, that the Fantastic Four (the comic of which has never been one I've been interested in) film stands up quite well when placed side by side against other comics to films.

As with any such film, the absolute intent is for there to be more than one film. Why? Well, you've got to do a lot of suspension of disbelief as well as introduction of characters and their intentions and their psyche. If those aren't incorporated, you end up with a hollow film with no emotional center (remember Batman and Robin?).

Marvel and their film production partners have wisely made the decision to ground all their comic films in modern reality. This means New York is New York and not Gotham City - some bizarro world alternate reality. To do so, means that the comic to film characters must become flesh and blood believable. In this film, Marvel has scored.

Ioan Gruffudd as Mr. Fantastic is sincere and extremely believable as a man on a mission but who tries to push his own feelings away. Jessica Alba as the Invisible Woman is certainly sexy, but more importantly, Ms. Alba brings a nuanced confidence to the role that it needed. Michal Chiklas as The Thing could not be any finer. Thank heaven technology caught up to comics so that the Thing could be ""real"" and not CGI, so that Chiklas' acting comes through far more intensely than the costume he wears. Dr. Doom's backstory has been tweeked to make it more accessible and ""believable"" to the audience. Is it effective? You bet. I keep finding that Marvel's film developments often surpass the ""realities"" of their comic counterparts, making them more believable and reality based, while maintaining the fantasy aspects so necessary to the stories. And finally, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm, the Human Torch. Wow! This could have really been screwed up. The Human Torch's popularity has surpassed that of the Fantastic Four, garnering him his own series of comics from time to time.  He's a smart alec and a cocky SOB. Initially, I understand, the producers were just going to have the character be able to shoot flames from his hands, thus making him truly a ""human torch"", but somewhere along the line, they kept the character as in the comics and he is fully ""on fire"". Evans and Chiklas steal the show with their character portrayals, and the script still lets their humanity come through.

As with any introductory film, the script is forced to be overtly heavy in exposition and backstory. However, seeing that this film was a success, doubtless there will be a sequel, which should mean that it will be able to be nothing but a non-stop thrill ride.

Even so, while often burdened with too much expostional material, in the long run this film needed it and it suceeds because of it.

No, it's certainly not perfect, but I'll not fault the producers too much. The casting was perfect and the special effects were just dynamite. I'm looking forward to the next installment.",1136246400,5,3360,4.72991452991453
1553190,4,B00005JNTU,"I missed the Fantastic Four, aka FF in the theatres and as any self-respecting Marvel comic fan, had to watch the DVD in spite of the mixed reviews I'd heard.

The good news is: the movie is watchable.  It's not perfect, and I still rate the X-men and the Incredibles ahead of this.  The effects are well crafted, and much thought has been put into the visual approach.

What else is good about this: Great casting of Von Doom (Julian McMahon of Nip/Tuck) and Chris Evans as the Human Torch.  Jessica Alba looks great too.

What could have been better:  This entire film was more like an introduction to the Four rather than a complete movie experience.  Sometimes feels like a TV show.  Since a sequel is in the works, we'll just have to wait.

Weak Chink for me: Mr Fantastic is pretty average.  And Dr Doom's origins are less compelling than the real comic book Dr Doom.

As some reviews say above, the Fantastic Four isn't about characterisations, and yet, one feels that the chemistry of the four could've been tweaked up a notch instead of falling back purely on the comic book landscape / approach of simple characters.  After all, the Fantastic Four became ""the world's greatest comic"" simply BECAUSE the characterisations were complex and unique, and the characters each had strong identities.  This is ignored a bit in favour of an Irwin Allen ""Land of the Giants"" TV feel.  Meaning: these are not epic characters on the level of the X-men.

Dr Doom's development was somewhat of a disappointment.  While I enjoyed how the new scriptwriters have incorporated him in a more contemporary and intelligent way - I wish that the original character could've been respected.  The mystery and dark foreboding of the original Dr Doom was on a level that inspired characters like Darth Vader.  Doom's comic book legacy deserved better.

The Human Torch however, is excellent.  Never my favourite character, he nonetheless comes alive in every way in the film.  Flame on!

I was definitly not let down and was releaved to see Marvel didn't choke again like they did with X-Men.(Spider-man was awesome!) This movie was sooo much fun and nothing was cheesy or lame.

1553291,3,B00005JNTU,"Ah, comic book movies always have a hard time of it.  How do you strike the balance of nostalgia for the older audience and still update the story enough to involve the young people.  Another aspect is deciding whether you want the film to feel to the older audience the way it felt to them as a kid (so you would have to step up the intensity of the story quite a bit) or do you recreate the story as it was (to put on film the stories we loved as kids).  Well, this movie tries to have it all ways and ends up a bit confusing.  It updates the story of how the Fantastic Four came to be and their emotional struggles, but keeps the struggle with Dr. Doom much like the way it was done decades ago; lots of flying around, banging around, but not much real threat or damage except to property.

Still, I am glad to have seen the story and hope they do another, better, edition of this group.  Each of the actors is good for his or her role, including and especially Alicia (Kerry Washington) for Ben Grimm.  She can be developed and integrated into the story much more than she was in this film.

BUT, please, stop with the comic book stupidities like the Human Torch risking igniting the atmosphere because he went to 4,000 degrees Kelvin (which is only 6,740 degrees Farenheit).  Nuclear reactions are magnitudes hotter and controllable.  Puh-leeze.  And calling that temperature Super Nova is dumber than dumb.  A Super Nova is an exploding star, not a temperature.

I appreciate what the script was trying to do, by exploring the effects these changes would have on our protagonists (especially The Thing) and examining the relationships between them.  But it just didn't work, and even if it had I'm not sure it would have made an interesting movie.

Examples where it just didn't work: Ben's wife/financee/girlfriend/whatever, Debbie, comes out in the street to see Ben ... in her nightgown?  Makes no sense.  Then she runs away screaming.  Ok, that was expected.  Would have been more effective if she hadn't been wearing a nightgown, but okay, we get the point, she's rejected Ben.  Then, THE NEXT DAY, when the FF have rescued people from a major accident on the bridge (an accident they caused, by the way) Debbie comes out on the bridge, looks Ben in the eyes and drops her engagement ring on the ground.  I don't get it.  Yes, it led to a nice shot of Ben trying and failing to pick up the ring, but other than that the whole scene was superfluous, out of place, and (like running around a busy New York street at night in your nightgown) it made no sense.  There are just too many scenes like that.  They make no sense.

In the end, the only threat the FF have to face is Von Doom.  Yes, he's developed a nasty habit of blasting holes through people, but he's hardly the global threat (or even a city-wide threat) the FF are usually facing in the comics.

1553299,2,B00005JNTU,"The Fantastic Four is yet another Marvel Comics superhero story brought to the big screen.

The four: Mr. Fantastic, The Thing, The Invisible Girl, and Human Torch, cause awe and wonder in the city of New York as they struggle to fight Doom and prevent him from taking over all the power of the world. It's cliched entertainment only past superheroes such as Superman, Batman, and Spiderman used the cliches to make up unique characters that inspired the audience, not bored them to death.

The Fantastic Four are four scientists who, after facing an enormous flow of radiation, gain special powers: turning into a ball of fire, going invisible, extending limbs, and becoming a safeguarded body of heavy rock. The film focuses on the scientists trying to return to their normal selves, especially The Thing, whose wife literally divorces him because of his new condition, and suffers social isolation, instead of focusing on the foursome saving the world and fascinating us, the viewers, with demonstrations of their super abilities. Then there's the nemesis Doom, a scientist who was also exposed to the same radiation, whose power is to suck up energy and turn to solid metal.

Don't be fooled by the events as I mention them, The Fantastic Four is a silly movie. The plot and the subplots are not coordinated correctly. The Thing's wife never returns to him and there's not a care of trying to win her back either, and the entire love story between The Invisible Girl and Mr. Fantastic is pointless. The humor in the film is mainly from The Thing crushing everything he holds including a glass, a car, and a fork.

The Fantastic Four is not all that fantastic after all.

Not really recommended

1553300,2,B00005JNTU,"Doing a Superhero movie is always risky.  You've got to get the audience to suspend disbelief to an even greater extent than is normal for a move for the magic to work.  It's vital that the actors and director convey the vitality of the comic they're depicting, without crossing the line to silliness.  Most importantly, the characters have to get you to care about them and have to not act embarassed by the ""fantastic"" parts of the story.  It's OK for Christopher Reeve to acknowledge and smile at the audience at the end of the Superman movies, becuase it's Superman smiling at the audince, not the actor saying, ""I'm not really like this, we're all in on the joke"".  Look at the difference between the first two Batman movies (along with Batman Begins) and the awful pair directed by Joel Schumacher.  Spider-Man and X-Men worked because everyone involved took it seriously and said, ""Give us that these characters could exist, and we'll tell you a good story"".

Fantastic Four doesn't work.  Yes, there has to be the obligatory origin and discovery of powers section, but this takes almost 75% of the movie.  The big climax showed little originality  except to get the science wrong, as everyone walked through their scenes.  Mostly the characters just sit around and emote and say, ""We've got to be careful until we figure this out"".  Ioan Gruffudd's depiction of Reed Richards can best be described  as wooden.  Jessica Alba is basically given nothing to do except look conflicted.  Chris Evans gives some animation to his role, especially during the comic moments when he's teasing the Thing, but his character is mostly superficial.  Only Michael Chiklis brings any depth to his role, and he's really the only one you believe or care about.  Julian McMahon does a creditable job as Victor von Doom, but the chracter has been rewritten into a standard villian straight from Central Casting.

It was said by some that this movie didn't do that well because ""The Incredibles"" stole its thunder.  That's not true.  ""The Incredibles"" was a Good movie, ""Fantastic Four"" is just a movie.",1135641600,5,2089,4.8474576271186445
1553375,4,B00005JNTU,"I had some serious misgivings about this film the moment I became aware of its presence. Aside from the fact that the Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four is just as popular this side of Spider-man to the older comic book fanbase and the ULTIMATE fanbase, I seriously doubted that this comic book foursome would adapt into good movie like Blade, X-Men, and Spider-Man had managed to be during the span of the 20th and 21st century. My brother had bought the movie for my father on Christmas and I watched it during dinner. Once again my opinion was rebuked, replaced with Giddiness. Though still retained its misgivings for I had only watched it once. The film throws the characters at you and into their life defying moment without much time for development: They introduce you to Reed Richards, Ben Grimm, Victor Doom, Sue Storm, and Johnny Storm, as though you're supposed to recognize them right off, not really caring about their pasts.

This is a small glitch in the system you can jump over . . . slight developments are made later on in the movie (besides you can read the comic books). The plot of the movie manages to stick to formula without straying away with the celebrity moments and humor. In this movie Sue and Richard aren't a happy married couple. More like estranged ex-boyfriend/girlfriend and Sue's an assistant to Victor Von Doom, to mention a major change. The foursome are thrown into media's eyes when an accident on the Brooklyn bridge occurs and they save several people from death in the form of fire and falling over the bridge. Their name --""the fantastic four""-- is given to them by the news and their codenames are beseeched to them by Johnny Storm himself. Throughout all of this newfound chaos, Reed Richards tries to find out how to reverse their Genetic changes to their body, particularly for Ben Grimm who's taking his change and his wife's abandonment hard. Elsewhere, Von Doom tries to come to terms with his changes as well and perhaps use his new found power it to his advantage.

I have to commend the choice of actors chosen to be the F4. The chemistry between all five main characters played nicely throughout the movie, never feeling strained or unconvincing for a moment. At first, there were only two actors by which I didn't know by reputation or seen a movie until I remembered the movies ""Cellular"" and ""King Author."" I could hardly recognize Chris Evans with most of his hair shaven off his head or Ioan Gruffudd without curly hair and a beard. While on the subject these two, Gruffudd seemed comfortable in the shoes of down on his luck scientist (or ""Dork"" to Sue) Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, who hasn't ever been my favorite character out of the four, and portrays him awfully well without the over seriousness that comes with maturity and husband mentality persona of the comic books. Christ Evans as my favorite character Johnny Storm/The Human Torch, reminds me more of Ultimate Johnny Storm by perfectly capturing the childish antics and slackish, carefree attitude Storm carries about him. Alba plays a convincing Sue Storm/Invisible Girl upon the aftermath in space, as opposed to her character at the beginning of the movie when she was simply looking to burn Reed Richards while at the same time trying to gain attention from him in her tight outfit. Michael Chiklis -- who usually plays a dirty cop in FX's ""The Shield""-- does Ben Grimm/The Thing justice with an excellent movie portrayal that I think sometimes was riddled with a little too much humor that indeed made me laugh (""Don't do drugs!""). This actor managed to make you feel his anguish of his condition without making you feel like you were watching a soap opera which goes without saying. And lastly Julian McMahon, an actor I dread due to his association with the FX series ""Nip/Tuck"" (shudders), is convincing as a Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom (without the accent) who is literally cut from the corporate ladder and is diagnosed with an incurable ""disease"" (as Reed puts it metaphorically) directly in tie with the other's venture into space. I actually liked him in this role as the F4's greatest adversary and no complaints about his costume change.

The CGI graphics for this movie are well done though it cannot be ignored that sometimes they painfully look like just what they are . . . computer generated. This was mainly noticed with Mr. Fantastic's stretching body, which was probably the coolest thing about the movie character wise. The suit for The Thing looked less bulky and bolderish more smooth chiseled, more realistic on Chicklis (whom they say is the actor wearing the Thing Suit if I remember correctly) though I had a problem with the long pants. The graphics used for the Invisible Girl and the Human torch, were fantastic. Alba's body missing from the clothing never looked as though her clothes were hanging on a wire or suffered from clunky frame rate issues. The Human Torch's ""flame on"" graphics were nicely presented on screen though I did have a gripe about Evans mouth which looked a little restrained when he yelps ""Woo-hoo!"" Another problem with movie I had was the short lived Dr. Doom vs. Mr. Fantastic scene. It felt as though something was cut out and not shown in the deleted scenes section. The Score for the movie, done my John Ottman (X2: X-Men United) is 3 star quality at best. While its not supposed to be anything fantastic or award winning in anyway, I think it does a good job with defining moments in the film, though I have to day the vocalist are as bad as they were in X2.

Lastly, the DVD's special features are plentiful and should make any special feature-junkie happy, with making of's, casting, audio commentary, video dairy and trailers. The deleted scenes weren't much, they mostly centered around Reed or Sue and Reed's night on the town. The Making of the Fantastic Four movie, really lacked something all the other ""making of""'s I've seen. It was REALLY SHORT, and only hinted at the technical aspects of the film's CGI and so on. The Making a scene section a bit better than the making of. It sorta reminded me of The Matrix Relaoded DVD segment on how they constructed the highway scene. The casting section segment was nothing like I thought it would be. It gave short interviews with the main cast (and Stan Lee, speaking on his cameo) and etc. At the time I had a sneaking suspcion that the MAKING OF section had be divided from it's original format. The Trailers (usually my favorite part of special features) were riddled with expected fantastic four related puns that were really annoying. The video diary - showcasing the cast's trip around the world to promote the movie was pretty interesting.

 And lastly, the music videos were tiresome and uninspired (though the song ""Come on, come in"" was probably the best song on the FF4 soundtrack, where as ""Everything Burns"" is painfully dull and uninspired. It doesn't beat ""Hero"" by a LONG SHOT). All in all ""FANTASTIC FOUR"" is a good time movie, with charm and balance. Never to be taken to seriously like Elektra, Daredevil, The Punisher (which was good) and The Hulk. -----[4 out of 5]",1135555200,2,7133,4.75767366720517

Perhaps, like most opinions of movies made from books or comics, it depends on whether the viewer was a fan of the original material.  If you didn't read the original Lee-Kirby Fantastic Four of the the 1960's, then maybe this movie doesn't do it for you.  But if you did read those comics, then I think you will love this movie.  It captures the mood, the interplay between the characters, and most of all, the tragic nature of Ben Grimm almost perfectly.  And, I hate to say it, but the state of the art effects are even more impressive than the pulse-pounding excitement of a Kirby fight scene.  Unlike a lot of special effects extravaganzas of the last few years, this movie is about the characters.  It is both funny and moving.

Fantastic Four is the latest in a saturated market, and it fails in almost every aspect except excellent special effects. The characters are cliche, as is the bad guy. The dialogue is repetitive (usually about either loving or hating their powers). The action is sparse and over way to quick, and the ending itself was cheap. And the ending is both predictable and clipped, with the super heroes coming together for one final blast of an attack to defeat their foe. Then, of course, there was the ""monster egg"" ending, that left you wanting more. Only in the case of this movie, it really didn't leave you wanting much. In fact, it solidified my personal want to quickly eject the DVD from my DVD player and return.

I can't recommend this to any kind of movie lover.

1553382,3,B00005JNTU,"`Fantastic Four', `Daredevil', and `Spiderman' make a very interesting trio of superhero movies, especially as they are, all three of them, based on a Marvel Comics character. To my mind, they exemplify the three levels of quality of `watchable' superhero movies, as opposed to those that are derivative and lacking any spark of imagination.

Although many have rated it fairly well, I would put the newest, `Fantastic Four' at the bottom of the list, along with `Hellboy', which I happened to like, but which shares with `Fantastic Four' some serious difficulties to our suspending disbelief. These movies are simply made for fun. You can almost sense the tongue in cheek attitude of the writer and director, let alone the actors. The situation which creates the superpowers is simply too improbable to accept. How is it that a single physical phenomenon would have five totally different effects on five normal, healthy humans? I know just enough about genetics to know how this may be explained, but the film narrative touches on none of this. We are just meant to swallow this story whole. In contrast, the transformation of Matt Murdock is totally plausible. Enhanced senses following loosing one sense are very real. They just posited a bit more than normal ability in that direction. The genesis of Peter Parker's superpowers is a bit more sci fi, but totally believable, given the chance to believe a genetically enhanced spider species.

`Daredevil' is probably the least popular of these three movies, and the first time I watched it, it didn't do much for me. On second watching, especially with the extras on the DVD, I appreciated that the moviemakers really accomplished something here. The premise behind both hero and villains is totally plausible and the director, special effects crew, and actors increase this verisimilitude by using very few CGI effects and stunt doubles. Most of what you see on the screen is really Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and Colin Farrell, enhanced with a few wires to accomplish some of the more adventuresome gymnastics. The filmmakers also enhance the picture by doing a lot of the key scenes at night. This is totally logical, as the sightless Daredevil would have the advantage when his sighted rivals would be almost as visually handicapped as he is. `Daredevil' also has the added value of at least three very human relationships. Along with some of the `Batman' and `Superman' flicks, this holds the penultimate spot in superhero quality films.

`Spiderman' is easily on the top tier of superhero movies, based not only on the believability of the premise and the humanity of the actors, but also on the relatively effortless special effects, lightly applied to great effect. I also think the actors contribute much to the quality of this film, where with Toby McGuire, there seems to have been just a bit of casting against type, the way Michael Keaton was cast as Batman in the first Tim Burton `Batman'. While I never read `DareDevil' or `Hellboy' comic books, I am familiar with the original `Fantastic Four' and `Spiderman' comics, so I think the relative merit of the films has a lot to do with the relative merit of the comics, since `Spiderman' is the traditional champion among strong comic book fans. I should add a plug for performances by Michael Chiklis in `Fantastic Four' for his comic relief and by Ben Affleck in `DareDevil' for taking the role so seriously, possibly through the influence of his good buddy, Kevin Smith, who appears in a cameo role as the medical examiner.",1135036800,,3546,4.966329966329966

But overall, I think the green screen and special effects were good, but the film just didn't measure up to what I thought it was going to be.

I went out and watched this movie in the theaters by myself I was so excited to see it. I loved comic books when little and really wanted to see the film.

Overall it's a great movie if you just want fun that's pretty simple and not too violent and I would recommend this for kids with utmost sincerity. It really is simply a fun film that is really great for kids. There are a variety of super powers and fun special effects, a somewhat touching and kind storyline and good action that's not too violent. If you don't mind just a tiny bit more violence I (not much at all), I would really recommend X2, outstanding movie!!!! And Spiderman 2 is phenomenal as well.

Note: being someone that read comics when I was little and even read more obscure titles like Dr. Strange, Power Pack, Rocket Raccoon, etc... and played the Marvel Universe role playing game and so on, I would not say this is such a great movie for hard-core fans of the original comic. I could write pages why, but other reviewers already have, so please don't hold that against me, this review is to encourage people looking for a fun nice movie for their kids or as a present and think this movie is great in that capacity.

1553475,3,B00005JNTU,"Among the first comic books I ever bought, nearly 30 years ago, was a Fantastic Four, somewhere around issue 180.  Since then, I have read the comic book off and on for years at a stretch and seen both highs and lows in the series.  In other words, I'm a long-time fan, and when before I saw this movie, I had mixed expectations.  Marvel adaptations have been all over the quality map, from the great Spiderman and X-Men movies, through the so-so Punisher and Hulk, to the wholly forgettable Elektra.

This film falls squarely in the middle of this spectrum.  For those unfamiliar with the story, it deals with four people - scientist Reed Richards, his buddy Ben Grimm, Reed's ex-girlfriend Sue Storm and her brother Johnny - who are exposed to cosmic rays and get super powers.  As Mr. Fantastic, Reed can reshape and stretch his body as if it were rubber; Sue becomes the Invisible Girl, who also can create force fields; Johnny is the Human Torch, a living man of flame; and Ben, in a way tragically, becomes the monstrous but superstrong Thing.  Together, they are the Fantastic Four, and unlike most superheroes, they have no secret identities but instead are all well-known to the public.

Opposing them is Victor von Doom, who sadly is one of the principal flaws in the movie.  In the comics, Dr. Doom is one of the best all-time villains (probably only behind Lex Luthor and the Joker in comic book villaindom), a genius who uses technology and a touch of the supernatural to commit his crimes.  Dr. Doom was probably a partial inspiration for that great screen villain, Darth Vader.  In this movie, he is superpowered and actually a rather routine villain, a technocrat who seems little more than a retread of the Green Goblin from Spiderman.

Michael Chiklis, as always, does a good acting job.  Jessica Alba looks pretty but like most of the rest of the cast, is not all that great at acting.  While reasonably faithful to the comic book concepts of the characters (for example, Reed's intellectualism or Johnny's rashness), the story itself is just so-so.  I suppose a good deal of the problem is so much time is spent on the origin of the FF that we don't get much of the four acting as an actual team.  Perhaps a sequel would work better, as often happens in other comic adaptations; without wasting so much time on the origin story, we can get a better plot.

But things aren't all bad.  The effects are good and there are some reasonably amusing or touching moments.  I credit Chiklis with a lot of these, as he makes the Thing the most interesting character (and sometimes the only one) in the movie.  If I seem harsh on this film, I guess it's because I've seen how good the comic could be and see a lot of wasted potential in the movie.  If you're unfamiliar with the comic book, this will probably be a likeable movie, but fans of the comic may be disappointed.",1134691200,3,2882,4.5680933852140075

The special effects are much better and the characters actually resemble the real comics. And the characters actually use their powers, for example the mutants that fly actually do it. It's not like the x-men where the only mutants that seem to get any action are wolverine and mystique. The invisible woman's powers is similar to  what I expected to see from jean grey and magneto. The human torch really flies and doctor doom actually fires bolts of electricity from his hands whereas storm from the x-men never did. Don't get me wrong I think the x-men will stump the fantacstic four in battle but the producers just did a better job with this one.",1134604800,,758,4.573529411764706

In place of a mad European genius with a disfigured face, we get an American soap opera star who gets cosmic powers and becomes a Borg.

1553480,4,B00005JNTU,"When the comic book movie craze officially hit with the release of blockbusters such as, ""Spiderman"", ""X-Men"", and their hugely successful sequels, many comic book fans were left wondering when will Marvel's first superhero team, the Fantastic 4, make it to the big screen.  Since at the time DC Comics had not released ""Batman Begins"", Marvel Comics was the only comics' distributor releasing movies, so of course their characters were the primary focus of fans.  Many began to worry with the poor performance (in movie critic's minds, that is) of ""Hulk"", ""Daredevil"", and ""Elektra"", would comic book movies continue to be made or would the superhero genre die out once again.  Luckily, the genre has not died, despite movie critic's most desperate wishes, and in 2005 Marvel's 'First Family of Heroes' were given the big screen treatment they deserved, and audiences were treated to a more tongue-in-cheek comic book movie, that still delivered the goods in terms of storytelling and quality.

""Fantastic 4"" is essentially the origins for this team of reluctant heroes.  Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and his best friend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) are attempting to persuade the extremely rich industrialist, Victor Von Doom, to fund an expedition into space to study a cosmic anomaly that is nearing Earth's orbit.  Von Doom agrees with the proviso that he and his lovely assistant/girlfriend, Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), along with her hot-headed brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) are allowed to join them on their voyage into space.  Though the expedition begins pleasantly enough, except for Johnny's practical jokes on Ben, things quickly turn awry as the cosmic anomaly reaches Von Doom's space station sooner than expected and all 5 members of the expedition are bombarded with cosmic rays.  Upon their return to Earth everything appears to be normal, but then everyone begins experiencing changes in their bodies, and new powers developing.  Each member exhibits different powers, Reed has the power of elasticity, Sue gains invisibility, Johnny can control fire, and Ben becomes hard as rock.  These four out of the five member team try to learn more about the source of their new powers and possibly find a cure for them.  Meanwhile, Victor Von Doom, whose skin is slowly becoming a metallic alloy, and also has the ability to shoot electricity from his hands, is becoming increasingly distrubed and blames Reed for causing his current condition.  However, instead of finding a cure, he embraces his anger along with his power and turns on the society that has begun to shun him.  Now Reed, Ben, Sue, and Johnny must decide whether to rid themselves of their powers or join forces to battle their onetime comrade and protect humanity from his evil.

Though not nearly as serious as ""Spiderman"" or ""X-Men"" or any of the other Marvel Comics' movies for that matter, ""Fantastic 4"" still gives an engaging story that can be both serious and humorous.  The casting is terrific, all of the actors perfectly embody their comic book counterparts, especially Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis.  These two actors excellently capture the constant bickering/bullying between the Human Torch and the Thing, while at the same time showing their underlying loyalty and willingness to sacrifice for one another if the need arose.  The special effects work is terrific, and it was nice to see the Thing not be computer generated like the Hulk was.  Though critics tore this movie apart and tried to convince the public it was not and could never be a big success, the box office numbers provided by fans and general movie audiences proved otherwise.

If you enjoyed ""Spiderman"" or ""X-Men"" or any of the other comic book movies, or are just a fan of sci-fi/action movies with good storytelling, then ""Fantastic 4"" is a movie you should see.  However, do not watch this movie expecting to see the same level of drama as ""Spiderman"" and ""X-Men"" had, this movie is much lighter in tone, while still delivering a good story with plenty of drama mixed in.

""Fantastic 4"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.",1134518400,8,4124,5.035294117647059

But there are three small deleted scenes on this. One is an alternate take of a scene that was used in the movie. But if you listen to the commentary by Michael Chiklis he says there was two scenes with the character Alicia (the woman he meets in a bar) that were cut. Now they didn't use them here. Hmmmm...I wonder if there will be a longer ""director's cut"" released a year from now. I'm sick of this BS with action films. Every action film gets re-issued with more deleted scenes so we buy these things twice. Find a used store, buy it cheap and look for the longer version later.

Note: Commentaries usually bore me but these were pretty good. Alba's contributions are usually ""Remember when we filmed that?"" or ""I worked/froze/sweated my ""booty"" off."" But Chiklis is a fan and kind of takes over as host.",1134432000,,1075,4.29064039408867

I wanted to see what the 60's comic book had shown: the spaceship bearing Reed Richards, Jonny and Sue Storm, and Ben Grimm crashing to Earth and suddenly discovering amidst the wreckage of their ship, that they had great but unusual powers.

But the way this foursome disvovers it's powers is lame at best and far from true to the books. I hate change just for the sake of change. And yet, this movie turns out to be a great movie!

It drags at the  beginning, but as Victor von Doom, the man who financed the ill-fated expedition that created the Fantastic Four and who was also on board the space craft with them, begins to go crazy with a lust for power the movie picks up and fast.

Doom also has powers and he wants more. When he sees that Reed Richards has created a machine that hopefully will ""cure"" them all, he tricks Ben into using to become  normal while his powers increase. Then with the Thing out the way, Doom goes after the other three in a big way. The special effects which could have easily taken over instead of plot, is used to perfection in a climatic battle between the Fantastic Four and Victor von Doom that just keeps you on the edge of your seat!

This was a surprisingly good movie and one can oly hope that the sequel-- and we all know there will be a sequel-- will be just as good or better than this one, although whoever will write the sequel will have to work really hard to do better than this!",1134432000,3,1603,4.326666666666667

""Hulk"" progressed slowly.

""Fantastic Four"" rushes from scene to scene, at times feeling unglued.

But when all is said and done, these are COMIC BOOK movies! They're not supposed to sweep the oscars. Fantastic Four is  scattered and uneven, but it succeeds at being FUN... much how those Christopher Reeve superman movies were (not counting #3).

And it's funny without being silly... like ""Batman and Robin.""

It's fun without the heavy handed ""darkness"" of Tim Burton's ""Batman"", or ""Daredevil.""

That being said, I felt that the Fantastic Four went the way of Ang Lee's Hulk. The actors are likable, but the script is ridiculous. The only character remotely four dimensional is The Human Torch. Reed and Susan have no chemistry at all. Michael Chiklis comes close to bringing the Thing to life, but he is so bitter that it is not worth watching. Of course, I thought the scenes with the Invisible girl being left in her underwear were gratuitous, but if you got it flaunt it. Von Doom sucked out what life the picture may have had.

1553555,2,B00005JNTU,"Batman 3 & 4. And Superman 4. Star Trek 5 was better than this movie and that's saying something.

This movie was bad. Bad acting. Bad plot. Very, very bad script. Decent, but not overwhelming, special effects.

Children under 10 might be entertained. Adults won't.

Here are the pros:

1)Great Stan Lee cameo.

2)Johnny Storm was believable and likeable.

3)Special effects were on par with the X-Men movies, but don't expect anything remotely close to Star Wars, Harry Potter, T2, T3,Spider Man 2, The Matrix, etc.

Here are the cons:

1) The script was awful. 1980's pro wrestling had more realistic dialog than this film did.

2) Von Doom = boring Villain. Victor Von Doom is supposed to be the most driven, arrogant villain in the world. He regards his genius as above all other men. That's a far cry from the insecure, failed businessman that you get from the movie.

3) Reed and Sue had no chemistry. This goes back to the bad script.

4) The movie felt rushed. Every 1st superhero movie has to bring you up to speed with the characters before getting onto the main conflict. Having 4 main characters and a villain can make that a tough proposal. The writers were not up to the challenge.

5) Can somebody explain to me what that whole scene was where The Invisible Woman had to strip naked to get through the crowd, but Johnny and Reed somehow got through? It made no sense.

Judging from the Spider Man and X-Men series, we know that Marvel characters can come to life on the big screen. But they should be embarassed to put out this film.",1134345600,2,1548,4.5451263537906135
1553556,4,B00005JNTU,"Y'know, this is nowhere NEAR as bad as everyone says! I just saw the DVD last night, expecting the worst (big-time, long-time comic book fan here...) and was pleasantly surprised.

Not that some of the vitriol directed toward this film has no basis. It does. As much as I love ""Nip/Tuck"", Julian McMahon has nothing good to do here. I don't like the way they re-imagined Doctor Doom. Actually, I think he would have been great as some regal, European monarch with issues, but all we got was some cliched corporate baddie.

Jessica Alba isn't as bad here as say, Sofia Coppola in ""Godfather III"", and she's sure nice to look at...but in terms of character development, she's given the short end of the stick. Yes she looks hot, but she doesn't ""look"" like a Sue Storm...

Speaking of, Mr. Fantastic is also malformed, pun intended. His character is also not as interesting as it could have been. He needed more chances to be intelligently heroic...to show off the ""brain"" that Ben Grimm keeps harping about...

Enough of the bad mouthing for now...the rest of the film was a blast!

Michael Chilis is sublime as The Thing. He's a wonder in that Thing suit. He manages to convey pathos, rage, humor...he's perfect.

Chris Evans as the Torch simply rocks. His over-the-top performance served as a nice contrast to the others, and the shenanigans between he and The Thing were right out of the comics. I can understand how he might be irrititating to some viewers, but I kinda think that's the point.

Most of the special effects were great as well! I don't know why there's so much venom directed towards the effects. Only the stretching business looks dopey, but the whole Brooklyn Bridge scene is spectacular, the Torch flying is breath-taking and the finale is terrific!

The dealing with the public, the coping with the new powers...it was all handled well, with great visuals. Yes, the script isn't as polished or cynical/witty as some may like, but in some cases, simpler is better, and maybe this movie isn't only for us comic geeks...

Take a chance on this movie, and I think you're gonna be pleasantly surprised...and if you already think this is going to be a piece of trash, you'll probably be blown away!",1134345600,,2214,4.715025906735751

I subjected myself to this punishment because, like a lot of people who grew up with the comic book, I really, really wanted this movie to be top flight.

I'm coming to the conclusion that the Fantastic Four, twice turned into a major critical dud (first by Roger Corman), maybe just can't make the leap from comic book into film.

I wouldn't expect a Fantastic Four II unless they junk the whole cast, and start anew.  Nobody is impressive in this movie.  Michael Chiklis seems a bit undersized as the Thing (maybe they should have gone the CGI route with this character ?), Ioan Gruffud is just terrible as Mr. Fantastic, and Julian McMahon is far too dapper to portray a believable villain, let alone inhabit the evil Dr. Doom.  People go to superhero movies to be overwhelmed by mythically huge battles between good and evil.  This movie actually downsized the characters, turning them all into jokes.

And, the best thing they could come up with for ""special features"" in this dvd package was a film of the promotional trips to Mexico and Australia--- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  That's really sad...but when you've made a real turkey, why not serve it with stuffing?

I watched in awe, especially the second episode of Spider Man, but this movie was no way near good even with all those special effects.  My lieast favorite character was Jessica Alba.

I am so sick and tired of watching movies, and it seems like every single films that are coming out now show girls in their underpants, showing their boobs, or completely nude.  How come they don't really show guys like this?  Jessica Alba's character that she portrade really did not show any real personality that you can bond with.

1553643,3,B00005JNTU,"You might have noticed it, I certainly noticed it: Hollywood likes trends. As soon as one popular genre film comes out that makes everyone notice, pretty soon legions of imitators come out. Scream comes out, we get I Know What You Did..., Urban Legend and many others. Well after the success of Spiderman and the X-Men movies, pretty soon others followed: Daredevil, Elektra, The Punisher and of course this film. While it's not that bad of a film, there's certainly a wasted idea here.

Reed is a scientist who wants to study an odd cloud that'll pass by the Earth. It did once and possibly started life on the planet. Only he needs money so he enlists Victor Von Doom, head of a major corporation. Along for the ride are Reed's old flame Susan, her brother Johnny and Reed's friend Ben. During the mission, the cloud appears earlier than scheduled and everyone gets a blast of radiation.

Reed finds that he's quite stretchy, elongating parts of his body(woman fans would love this) Susan can go invisible and create force fields, Johnny the hothead can turn or bend flame while Ben is a big...Thing, hence his name, with superhuman strength. Saving the day on a bridge, media attention typically goes overboard making reluctant starts of the mutant.

Victor also underwent a transformation too, and not just powers-wise. Since his company is going under more than over, he blames our heroes. His plot is to destroy his enemies, namely the titular team. That I like since most enemies want to rule the world, destroy the city or something. Here it's just ""kill those guys"".

This is probably some of the worst case of CGI in a superhero movie I've ever seen. Mr. Fantastic's stretchyness looks seriously bad, while some other effects kinda bad. But then again Johnny in Human Torch-mode looks great and Sue's force field, especially at the end looks cool. That odd cloud at the beginning was well done as well.

Casting is ever-so-important in a movie, especially when it deals with superheroes. Some work well such as Justin McMahon as our villain, Ioan Gruffudd(his name pronounciation is Yo-Han Griff-ud) is good as Reed but like I said, his stretchyness is bad. And typically miscast Jessica Alba looks great of course but not that much believable. Michael Chiklis is good too despite being under heavy makeup.

Now, I'm most likely going to be right but I say wait for the 2-disc super edition most likely around spring of 2006. Since this is a Fox movie it's obvious. But it's an entertaining but really flawed B movie.",1134172800,,2527,4.784403669724771

To do that, he swallows his pride and turns to his old rival, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon).  Victor agrees, and soon five people are traveling to a space station, hoping to get their experiment set up before a cosmic storm arrives.

Unfortunately, they don't make it, and the five of them are caught in the storm.  At first, there don't appear to be any effects.  But then they begin to change.  First, it's Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who becomes a rock creature.  But then Reed discovers he can flex his body into any shape desired.  Siblings Sue and Johnny Storm (Jessica Alba and Chris Evans) also find they have powers.  Sue can turn invisible and create force fields while Johnny can turn his body into fire and use that to fly.

Johnny is the only one of the four who is excited about their new found powers.  He wants to use them for good, sure, but also exploit them for profit.  Ben is the most reluctant to embrace their new found powers since he's a giant rock.  Reed tries to find a way to reverse the process while all of them attempt to deal with the powers.

Meanwhile, Dr. Doom is also undergoing a change.  But he wants to use his powers to satisfy his own greed and take over the world.  Now, the Fantastic Four will need to accept their powers in order to stop him.

I had heard of the Fantastic Four, but didn't know what to expect going into this movie.  The things I did expect were good special effects and lots of action.  I got one of the two.  The special effects were incredible, especially for Johnny Storm aka the Human Torch and Reed as Mr. Fantastic.

Instead of being an action movie, this was more a character drama giving the origins and background on the characters.  There were some action scenes, but they were few and far between and mostly came at the end.  Frankly, I left the theater disappointed because it wasn't what I expected.

That's not to say that the story wasn't interesting or entertaining.  Four ordinary people suddenly having these powers thrust on them will turn their lives upside down, and I enjoyed how it was handled.  I especially felt sorriest for Ben who had his entire life changed forever by his new form.

This movie gives good background on the characters and sets things up for the inevitable sequel.  But on its own, it's a rather disappointing superhero movie because of the lack of action.",1134086400,,2478,4.52027027027027
1553744,4,B00005JNTU,"By far, the most impressive thing about the Fantastic Four is the special effects. This is a movie that could not look this good a decade ago. The Fantastic Four has always been placed on hold for being made of a movie because any attempt to make The Thing or Flame would have been laughable. The Flame, I thought, needed a bit more work but The Thing was awesome and totally realistic.

The Thing, played by Michael Chiklis, also carried the heart of the movie. You see through his eyes how gaining superpowers isn't always the easiest thing in life. You can easily understand the problems he has adapting to his new abilities as he is chosen to decide living a life being different to help other or living the old life he had before where he was basically like everybody else. His motivations throughout the movie were the easiest to follow.

His best friend, Reed Richards (played by Ioan Gruffudd), I wish had more screentime. There were really only a couple of scenes where you saw his new-found power put to work. But the stretching looked realistic whenever he got to do it.

The real entertainment of the show came from Johnny Storm (Chris Evans). He was just a real fun and charismatic character to watch on screen and is the only person who really provided any comedy relief.

My biggest disappointment in the show was Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon). I just did not get his character. I didn't understand his motivation at all except that he apparently just wanted to do bad things. Why? Well, that is never fully explained. Or explained at all. He just seems upset with some of the things life handed him and decides he needs to start killing people. He gains nothing from it, but insists on doing it anyways. Marvel has done such a great job with the likes of Spiderman and X-Men in showing the motivation of ""bad evil doers"", I'm surprised to see them make Dr. Doom.

I also loved the uniforms of the Fantastic Four. They weren't really that far away from the comic book, except the four on their uniforms was updated (and shrunk a little bit). It gave them a more modern, less baseball jersey look. I was a big fan of the comic but I didn't complain about the costume changes.

I found the movie entertaining and well worth watching. I hope a sequel is in the works!

The effects were actually pretty good, and the story moved along at a good pace for this type of film.  The story stayed close to the source material, and tricked you into believing some of the most absurd crap.

Director Tim Story pulls this one off, but he's still in the red because of ""Taxi"", which was easily worth a score of three bad movies.

Honestly I've only read a few comics that have the Fantastic Four in them and besides knowing the basics, I knew very little about them. I mean I knew thier names and powers, but never really knew thier origin, which i'm told that this movie screws that up. Then again, most movies change origins all the time, take Batman for example, i think every movie had a different origin of Batman which is so simple, how can anyone elaborate so much into it and make it so different? U watched this movie and honestly, its a good movie and all, the problem i see its a rushed movie. You can tell by watching it that they develop on thier powers and how to use them but it wraps up too quick at the end. I agree with the one reviewer who says that the bridge wreck scene is longer than the actual final battle with Doom. I mean was the battle with Doom more than 5 minutes? If this movie was say, half and hour to an hour longer, it would be perfect. It would have the origins and be perfectly set up for experts of FF and for the novice who know little about them as I do. It was just rushed at the end as yes Von Doom wants to get revenge on Reed for taking the girl and losing his fortune, but it came along too quickly and the end battle was just that, way too fast. Hopefully if a sequal is made, they will have more action in it (can't be a comic book movie without action in it) since now they won't have to worry about chatacter development as it will already be there. The final fight or any fight with Doom should be longer as well.

GET TO THE MEAT ALREADY! Get to the action!! Yawn... show us ONCE what they can do... and get on with it!! We know anyway! We knew coming into the theatre.

And if you disagree with my view, consider that EVEN ONE OF THE STARS was disappointed that they didn't get to do all that much because they were setting up the characters the entire time. He was hoping there was a sequel so they could actually get to do some things... so??  Am I wrong?

I hope there's a sequel too! At least they won't have to establish character again... I don't think?  Or maybe they will, thinking that people missed the first movie... dear lord, it's a vicious circle.

Okay, so Reed Richards is really stretchy and they demonstrate that by having him catch a falling glass, unlock a door and looky really droopy in a mirror. Exciting stuff. Sue Storm can make herself invisible and they find equally exciting ways to demonstrate this. Ben Grimm becomes the Thing, a human rock, and he runs around accidentally knocking stuff over, accidentally breaking doors and crushing buttons. Johnny Storm becomes the human torch and until the end of the movie... he only used his powers to fight... well... no... to fly around a motorcross event and to fight... no... he flies more... well... I guess he has a little 'tiff' with his good buddy, the Thing. Does that count as a fight?

FANTASTIC FOUR lacks emotions and you never really feel any REAL DANGER in this movie. Dr. Doom is a VERY VERY small part. Toward the end of the movie... he just decides that he wants to destroy the Fantastic Four and the battle is on.... a very short battle I might add.

I'm not saying you shouldn't set up these characters and say how they came about.... but dear lord... don't spend 2/3 of the movie doing that!

The effects were good, but the screenplay was a complete disaster. Many of the special effects scenes were basically just showing off what they could do with their f/x computers in scenes that weren't all that important anyway.

The biggest scene of the movie, was a chain-reaction disaster on a bridge that is caused by... well... the Thing. THE BIGGEST SCENE OF THE MOVIE and it involved NO VILLAINS. The Thing sets the chain reaction in place and then saves the day to become a hero? ""Sorry... I caused a huge chain reaction car crash where numbers of people could have and should have been killed, but I did save this one guy.""

A successful movie needs many things to make it memorable and make it good... first of all, you need to establish good characters, which this movie does so in OVERKILL.  Secondly, you need a strong nemesis (DOOM IS OVERSHADOWED), Thirdly, you need a script that allows your audience to play along and feel urgency and fear (SWING AND A MISS) and Finally, you need a reason for the audience TO BE CONCERNED and not have to work to root for the outcome. FANTASTIC FOUR doesn't do this at all.

The movie isn't horrible, I'm only saying that it was a disappointment, not at all challenging, run of the mill and needed to give DR. DOOM more to do in order to fix it.

I just thought this movie was very weak and wasted too much time GETTING TO THE POINT... which wasn't much of one...

I think it was... OOH COOL, lOOK WHAT I CAN DO... FIGHT... DESTROY FANTASTIC FOUR... that was about it.",1133827200,2,3693,4.511244377811095

1553868,2,B00005JNTU,"OK, when doing a comic movie you have two options.  You can play it straight to the comic, or you can take some liberties.  Either way, you have to be very careful to avoid the cheese factor.

The flaw with this film, aside from the casting, is the fact that it decided to ignore 50 years of comic history to make a really bad film. I wonder how much they even tried to make this work.

First, you have the nitpicks:  Reed did not work for Doom.  Doom did not get his powers from a cosmic storm (he got caught in an explosion, got his face scarred, went back home to his native country, and continued working on his technological skills in addition to learning the mystic arts after his gypsy mother was killed).  Sue was not a scientist (putting pretty blondes in glasses and calling them ""Doctor"" doesn't make them smarter if the actress in question or the script in question is awful).  Johnny wasn't the pilot, Ben was.  Oh, yeah, and there's that small matter of Reed and Sue being married shortly after getting their powers and Doom not being even remotely involved with Sue.

Do I really need to continue?  It's little things like this which detract from the characters and makes you question why they do the things they do.  What drives them in the comics is replaced by practically nothing, giving us no real insight into why these people do what they do in the film.

Which brings me to the second major flaw.  Or 5 flaws, actually.  Ioan, Jessica, Chris, Michael, and Julian.  Some of them did the best they could with what they had, but there wasn't much there to work with.  No way can I see these characters developing into much of anything; saying they ""only scratched the surface"" is being kind.  Rumour mill has it that Jessica Alba has already bailed on any sequels.  Hopefully the rest of the cast takes the hint.

They had decades of material to come up with, and the best they could do was this.  ""Spiderman"" stayed true to the comics, and both films were hits.  Singer was able to bring a different life to the ""X-Men"" that worked, even though he tweaked a lot (by the way, there is the perfect example of how to create sexual tension among comic book characters: Hugh Jackman/Wolvie-Famke Jannsen/Jean-James Mardsen/Cyclops.  THAT was believable).  ""Sin City"" was an excellent production.  It is possible to make a good comic film.

Then there are the bad ones.  ""Catwoman"", aka ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" with fur and a whip.  ""The Hulk"", which even Ang Lee admits was probably not his best film and had he not found ""Brokeback Mountain"", he may not have ever come back to the big screen.  ""Daredevil"" was just sadly done, and ""Elektra"" was a fun guilty pleasure, but still only mediocre.  The ""Fantastic Four"" will fall into this category.

This film franchise has got to be cursed.  The first one is floating around only as a bootleg because it was so bad.  This one should have been ripped apart and put back together before hitting the screen.

So, why two stars?  CGI and Chris Evans.  That's it.",1133827200,6,3025,4.547309833024118

Some reviewers have stated that what makes the movie a good choice among superhero movies is that the team all have issues with one another and this dynamic helps to overshadow the poorer aspects of the film. I disagree; I don't think the conflicts within the group were well conceived at all. Look at both X-Men movies. Now there is some well thought out conflict among that group.

Dont look foward to see a lot of fighting scenes, don't expect to see Dr. Doom to do some of the cool and evil moves he does in the comics and don't expect a lot of cool special effects, well at least nothing that's surpassing what is common or usual in a Hollywood film.

The lack of deep in the characters and the complete absence of a solid scrip is the result of the movie and the DVD; don't get fooled, this is not even close to fantastic.

To sum up, if you are not a die hardcore comic fan the movie could pass for ""ok"", but that's all.

1553962,2,B00005JNTU,"In recent years, comic books have become one of the sources for blockbuster movies, which have released several genuinely good adventures such as X-Men, Spider-Man, Sin City, and Batman.  Several mediocre attempts have tried to follow the bandwagon through Daredevil and Electra that did not come through even though they both showed some promise.  One of my personal favorite comic books, Fantastic Four, has now also received a Hollywood treatment, and it has left me with strong feelings of anticipation, as the struggle between good and evil continues.

The film opens with a fascinating shot of Victor von Doom's extravagant statue outside the offices of Doom Enterprises where Richard Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) point out his need to control others.  Reed intends to convince Doom to invest in his research in regards to solar winds.  However, the shrewd executive Doom (Julian McMahon) has already made up his mind, as he is aware of the projects possible profits and how it could increase his power and wealth.  To complicate the situation, Reed's old girlfriend Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) works for Doom, as does her brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans).  It is a beginning packed with intrigues and possible scenarios, but viewers with knowledge of the Fantastic Four already knows the next series of events.  Nonetheless, it is to be expected, as it is the foundation of the Fantastic Four's adventures.

Reed's research brings Grim, Sue, Johnny, and Doom to Doom's space station, as its walls have the capability to protect them from the solar wind's radiation.  However, a miscalculation of the solar storm's arrival suggests that a catastrophe is imminent.  Somehow, they all survive and they have returned to Earth (in some peculiar way which causes some awkwardness.)  Safe back on Earth, they find themselves in quarantine (now I thought quarantine prevented people from coming in contact with the general population, but maybe I am wrong.)  Shortly after, changes begin to emerge in their physique, drastic changes, as their genetic structure has undergone a fundamental transformation.  The most evident change appears within Grimm, as his skin turns to rock.  The others also discover major changes in their physical capabilities, but it does not alter their physical presence as it does Grimm.  Some parts of the film deal with Grimm's feelings about his mutation, which comes across with awkwardness.  This part had strong potential, but should have been rewritten before the project got a green light.

The film continues to deal with their personalities and how the newly acquired metamorphosis changes their lives.  The funniest transformation is Johnny's transmutation to the Human Torch, as he uses it to impress girls while increasing his bank account.  The others are more serious about the change, and worry about the possible outcomes of the alteration.  Simultaneously, Doom fights to keep his business, as investors want to pull out due to the catastrophe at the space station.  Doom also suffers from some side effects from the space station accident, but does not share his discovery with anyone.  Some intriguing notions are touched upon through the mutations, but sorry to say, it shows a very one-dimensional perspective of the psychological and social scar of the characters.

The story is basically established on the idea that they got their mutations, but no real conflict arises.  This is besides the obvious conflict with Doom, which all readers of Fantastic Four already know about.  However, the film never explains why Doom wants to destroy the Fantastic Four, it merely suggests that they are powerful and stand in his way to accomplish something (oh, yes, I know that he wants world domination from the comic books and the few lines when he says it in the movie.)  It is within the conflict where the audience usually finds a plot, but since there is no conflict then there is not plot.  The film simply builds on the suggestion that the Fantastic Four will fight with Doom, but never really why this battle would exist.  Some of the weakness in the plot creation rests within the poor character development, which as mentioned is far too one-dimensional and unenthusiastic.  The characters appear extremely stereotypical in regards to the individual characteristic such as Reed who is a nerd, Grimm, the super loyal war companion, Johnny, the adolescent renegade, and Sue, the benevolent female hero who is in love with Reed.

Being an avid reader of the Marvel comic books has left me with a very disappointing cinematic experience in regards to the world of the Fantastic Four.  It did not meet the expectations, as Sam Raimi did with Spider-Man (2002) and the silver screen version of Sin City's ominously cynical world.  The film's lacking of a plot made it difficult to watch while the stereotypical characters feel uninteresting.  Nonetheless, the film offers some extravagantly flashy CGI action, but it lacks the insightfulness of many recently released superhero films.  The moral of the story emerges, but does so with childish ease.  Fantastic Four's cinematic journey culminates in a clash between good and evil that compares to a vain daydream wishing for something better.",1133308800,3,5258,5.137485311398355

1553964,4,B00005JNTU,"I have mixed feelings about the movie, probably because I was comparing it with the original comic book -- a bad idea.  As with Spiderman and X-Men, this is a re-imagining of the story in light of how much the world has changed since 1961, when the FF debuted. For instance, their reason for flying into space (beating the Commies into orbit) is obviously outdated now.

Some changes, though, were just plain mistakes.  Johnny Storm is too bratty, immature and full of himself to be very likeable (and whose idea was it to make him a Don-Juan skirt chaser???), and making Victor Von Doom a corporate mogul smacks too much of Norman Osborn in Spiderman.  I think it would have worked better if they'd patterned him more after X-Men's Magneto -- that is, showing the initial catalyst that began his transformation, and then catching up with him as a full-fledged villain.  With Magneto it was Nazi persecution during his boyhood; with Von Doom it could be the explosion in college that caused his disfigurement, expulsion and exile.  This isn't to take anything away from Julian McMahon, who gives Doom a wicked-but-cool vibe like Tomb Raider's Iain Glen.  His voice, though, doesn't quite work once he's donned the famous mask.

If the filmmakers didn't get Johnny or Doom quite right, they hit the bulls-eye with The Thing, who's so amazingly real right down to his smashing of a truck (how did they do that?), as well as Michael Chiklis conveying Ben Grimm's goodess-tinged-with-hotheadedness perfectly.  I felt that more than anyone else, he's really the star of this film.  And casting Jessica Alba as Sue Storm? Inspired, as the Comic-Con crowd agreed when she was introduced to them.  And she was afraid they'd boo her. :)

I'd like to have seen the FF mix it up with Doom a bit more, but I realize this is more of a stage-setting story.  Not that there's ever a lack of anything interesting -- Reed, who was already facing financial disaster, now has to find a way to restore everyone to normal while fending off Ben's impatience and dealing with Johnny's publicity-seeking antics.  Reed & Sue unexpectedly have to work together again after breaking up years before.  And on top of all this, of course, is the slowly-unraveling Victor Von Doom, scheming to divide, conquer, and destroy.

But who says we have to analyze it to death?  The bottom line is, this is a fun movie whose time has finally come, and should be taken as such.  Grab some popcorn, kick back and enjoy!

Certainly, young viewers can enjoy it, but so can adults.  I've never understood how everything must be classified.  If there's not a lot of swearing, violence, and nudity then a film must not be adult.  Phooey, I say.  I enjoy swearing, violence, and nudity, but their inclusion in a film doesn't automatically mean it's worthwhile.  Check out SIN CITY for an example.  And if you loved SIN CITY, then you probably won't like this film.  Different strokes for different folks.

But Fantastic Four is a good film.  It has well-defined characters, cool special effects, and a fun story.  I've seen it twice so far and both times I enjoyed it.  Nor was I bored the second time at all.  A worthy superhero film that dares to be a little old fashioned but still engaging.

There are some flaws however.  There's not enough action.  I'd have loved to seen the FF mixing it up a little more.  The Thing and the Human Torch both look amazing.  And Mr. Fantastic's stretchiness, while always a bit goofy as a power, is presented very well.

And Doctor Doom, one of my favorite comic book badguys, gets the short end of the stick.  He isn't nearly as cool in this film as he should be, but then again, he's not the star.

1554050,2,B00005JNTU,"Stan Lee is a master storyteller. I attribute the current success of the Spider-Man franchise to the film's fidelity to ""Stan The Man's"" original story line. Spider-Man IS a great character because of the guilt over his uncle's death and the fact that he could have prevented that death. The special effects, great acting, and media-hype are just window dressing to the gem that is the story.

I was thrilled at the prospect of The Fantastic Four getting the same treatment and sharing similar success. Unfortunately, the movie fell way flat of my expectations. The special effects were good, though not great. The acting is also good and Jessica Alba is as sexy as Chris Evans is hot. The plot is what made this film a stinker. Some Hollywood dope(s) came along and tried to improve upon Stan Lee's original story. First, it did not work. Second, it did not need improving.

The heart of the Fantastic Four is family. Maybe they were trying to distance the film from The Incredibles, but The Fantastic Four did come first. Doctor Doom is the Fantastic Four's arch-rival. Doom hates Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) because Doom blames him for the college accident that disfigured him. Doom could not accept responsibility for his own mistake, and this defines the drama and conflict that makes the original story a classic. The problem is, this never happens in the movie. Five minutes devoted to this part of the original plot could have raised this film from 2 to 5 stars. The Fantastic Four never save anyone but themselves and Doom is evil only because he is a businessman with a bad attitude.

In addition to these flaws, the DVD begins with mandatory trailers and the preview of X-3, advertised on the cover is less then three minutes long.

The movie does have some redeeming moments. Michael Chiklis has the gloomy mood of the The Thing down pat. Chris Evans as The Human Torch, has some great one-liners, but most of them can be scene in the movies trailer.

To all you Hollywood writers out there who sign on to work with these classics in the future, READ THE COMICS FIRST!!! You will find that most of your work is already done for you.

I saw this movie (not film, it doesn't deserved to be called one) back on opening day and it was garbage. Acting was GARBAGE, plot development (or a lackthereof) was GARBAGE, special effects were cheesy to put it litely, (okay I'll give the human torch 2 stars but everything else looked utterly pathedic), and the director needs to be booted while the franchise has any glimmer of hope left (Tim Story really should have stuck to trash like Barbershop because he trashed, battered and smashed, and slaughtered the FF4 franchise).

Frank Miller IS GOD!). Or you can watch Batman Begins (the closest, most accurate Batman film to date) or Constantine (Constantine is even a little spotty in regards to accuracy but it is still a thousand times more entertaining than FF4).

1554159,4,B00005JNTU,"With its recent comic based movies, Marvel Comics has largely gone one of two ways:  over the top fun (Spiderman, X-2), or bogged down stupid story (Hulk).  I like to think ""Fantastic Four"" is a combination of the two.  While not as impressive plot or effects wise as the near perfect, ""Spiderman 2,"" ""Fantastic Four""  does a very nice job of actively trying to be an entertaining film.  The origin story of the Fantastic Four and their arch-nemesis, Dr. Doom, has been ""dumbed down"" for new-comers to the series, but the basic gist of each character remains enough that true comic fans should at least crack a smile or two for each individual character at some point in this film.  While the portrayal of Reed Richards and Sue Storm are both gag-worthy at times, the Thing and the Human Torch both present more than ample levels of fun to make this film worth watching.  At times it feels as though it should be titled, ""The Fantastic 2 and their cry-baby companions,"" but director Tim Story does such a fast job of story development and action that any mood issues created by the Reed/Sue drama is easily overlooked and the fun of the story can again take center stage.

My biggest problem with this film is Dr. Doom.  He looked cool, he looked scary, but Story and company barely provided Doom with any movitation to hate the Fantastic Four as much as he did.  Dr. Doom came across as more of a spoiled 4 year old screaming at his mother in Toys 'R Us because he wanted more Lego's than he came across as a true villain.  He was whiney, foolish, and definitely did not come across as the ""genius"" he was supposed to be.  But again, the movie moves at such a frantic pace that Doom's inability to act like an adult is near forgiveable because of the amount of other ""stuff"" taking place on the screen.

This is a fun movie if you're not looking for a movie with a well developed plot or exceptional acting/directing.  It's a perfect ""popcorn"" movie for a boring Friday night, but it's not going to be one that stays in anyone's memory for an overly long period of time.

Superman IV the Quest for Peace, Batman and Robin (both the Adam West version and the George Clooney version) were better than this dreck, hell, the Hulk tv movies were better than this dreck. What an abysmal movie.  FF is probably responsible for my hair loss as shortly after I saw it my hair started falling out.

This director should go back and direct Barbershop 3 and stay away from Fantastic Four; about the only thing he got right was the relationship between Ben and Johnny, and those sequences were few and far between.

You'd think for an $145 million dollar movie they'd get the grey hair on Reed's temples right, but nooooo they couldn't even get that right, one minute it's grey, the next brown.

He is perfect as the human flame . . . but the rest of the acting was like sitcom quality . . . maybe that is because they used several TV actors.

1554162,4,B00005JNTU,"I went to see Fantastic Four with low expectations, which allowed me to be pleasantly surprised. While FF was nowhere near the quality of recent Spider-Man and X-Men movies (let's just ignore Daredevil and Hulk), it certainly allows me to believe the Marvel Comics franchise is in good hands.

The Fantastic Four is often considered the flagship title for Marvel. In short, a group of friends blast into space for scientific research when they are caught in a cosmic storm that changes their DNA and gives them remarkable powers: invisibility, fire, stony strength and, um, stretchiness.

There isn't as much action in the movie as one might expect, but the steady pacing gives characters time to develop and come to grips with their abilities before matching them against their first arch-foe. The movie doesn't have the best dialogue I've heard in a while, but when the cosmic storm hits, the special effects get wickedly cool.

Let's look at the team. The brilliant scientist Reed ""Mr. Fantastic"" Richards is neatly played with heavy doses of idealism and social awkwardness by Ioan Gruffudd. Jessica Alba is reserved, even chilly, as the Invisible Woman/Sue Storm, until circumstances force her back into the pliable arms of ex-beau Reed. Chris Evans, as the hotshot Human Torch/Johnny Storm, is flashy and arrogant, having way too much fun with his powers and sudden celebrity. As the mighty, rock-faced Thing/Ben Grimm, Michael Chiklis is a gruff and loyal mook with big muscles, sad eyes and some serious need for a pick-me-up.

As for the the villainous Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), he's been reinvented as a handsome and charismatic industrialist. The movie plops Doom in the middle of the action, and his own exposure to cosmic rays soon has him developing super-hard metal skin and tricky new electrical powers. (Still, for all his icy calm and unsatiable ambition, the love triangle set up to create additional tension between him and Reed is cliched and unnecessary.)

There's also a fascinating glimpse of those tricky little ""unstable molecule"" outfits the superteam wears. The way my wife elbowed me in the ribs when Sue displayed them, you'd think there was something else to see. (On one of her early attempts to go invisible, Sue flashes a bridge full of bystanders in a lacy bra and panties? Of course, the lingerie was of the ""stable molecule"" variety.)

The cast is good all around, and the special effects are expertly applied. So why, when the FF makes its first public appearance -- at a rather spectacular traffic pile-up initially caused by the Thing -- does the public seem completely unsurprised? Have New Yorkers become so jaded by Spider-Man and the X-Men that a rock man, a flame man, a putty man and a beautiful woman in her underwear don't warrant a raised eyebrow?

Fantastic Four has garnered plenty of mixed reviews, but I hope the studio doesn't give up on it just yet. Now, with the characters in place and their powers revealed, the team is poised for a more action-packed sequel, and I hope to see this cast return to do the job.",1130284800,7,3075,4.890595009596929

This also explains why Doctor Doom looks like a big green, corny dialog spewing Van Der Graf generator.

  The rest of the movie is taken up by the friends trying to learn to control their abilities and accept them as part of their normal self.

1554167,3,B00005JNTU,"Now there are so many films based on comic books or graphic novels, and Marvel has been playing important role in this trend, with the varies results.  And another one has arrived.  OK, now I've seen it, and I can tell you there are two good news about the live-action filmed version of 'Fantastic Four'

1) The film doesn't take itself seriously.  Though the film starts from the ""Episode I"" of FF, Mr. Fantastic, Human Torch, The Thing, and Invisible Woman, the film's tone remains very light-hearted, making a good contrast with 'Batman Begins' or to some extent the same Marvel's film 'Daredevil.'  'FF' does not reach the lofty height of 'Batman' rightly knowing that's not where it should go, but it is at least much better than seeing how Halle Berry became Catwoman and received a golden Razzie award personally.

In 'Fantastic Four' we see one failed experiment in outer space turn the five people into rubberball, fireball, rock, invisible woman, and iron man, and they worry so much about their changed bodies, but wait a while.  They soon discover what they can do with their newly acquired ability, and then actions start in the good, old fashion, that is, the good vs the evil.

The story is weak, and sometimes 'disasters' happen because of our heroes' own carelessness (which undermines the plot), but the characters are interesting, and Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis are all good, especially Evans as Johnny Storm.

2) Other good news is that the CGI enhansed actions are reasonable if not perfect.  One of the best effects is huge body of Ben Grimm and his craggy skins, which are much more convincing than those of 'Hulk.'  Equally good is the effects of Human Torch, and added humor (mostly goofy kind) is helpful especially when we see these two characters exchanging some dialogues during their frequent squabble.

Less successful is the romance part.  It only slows down the story, and Gruffudd and Alba has no chemistry between them that would make us care their love story.  And some CGIs, those of Mr. Fantastic in particular, need better technique for sometimes the live-action background and CGI created hands or legs, of which movement looks often awkward, just don't merge together.

Light-hearted 'Fantastic Four,' often silly and goofy, intentionally goes against the grain, the trend of the comic hero with darker side like 'Spider-man' (another Marvel creation).  I am afraid that 'FF' is too light-hearted, but still enjoyable if you don't expect too high standards.  If you need to see better version of film about four characters with superpower and one bad guy, see 'The Incredibles.'",1128988800,4,2654,4.954853273137697

If you are going to redo something shouldn't you make it better rather than aiming to the lowest common denominator?

It's got a Dumbed down plot, very uninteresting chanters and Alba who cant act here way out of a paper bag. The only entertaining character is The Human Torch but that still isn't enough to recommend this movie. Add to that the Rock Music score that they blast frequently during the movie and you have a good movie for teens and that's about it.

The Fantastic Four gets stuck somewhere in the middle.  It tries to  do a serious take on the film while at the same time trying to be comical and lighthearted.  In my opinion it comes up short on both.

The character development is very weak, even if you have minor knowledge of the storyline and characters it still is not enough.  You need to have been a real fan of the comic books for the story to work.

How many near-nudity/underwear shots were there?  About 3, weren't there?  Anything more would have been bordering on gratuitous...point made.

To summarize briefly, most of the actors in this movie are standing around as if to say, ""Ok, Mr. Director, what do I do now?""  ""Something weird just happened...what do I do now?""

Unfortunately, the plot contrivances are ploddingly predictable from the Thing's frustrations to where the internal conflicts within the group penultimately lead as well as Doom's demise (or merely defeat?  muhahahahahaha!!!).

I'm not looking forward to any adventuring with the 4 if the same directing/screenplay talent is employed.  I only give it an additional star for the effects and the Thing's performance, despite the surreality of his surroundings.",1128643200,7,933,5.468531468531468
1554289,3,B00005JNTU,"In no way is this movie true to the spirit and characterizations of the original Marvel Comics series. Nor does it come close to either the 'Spiderman' or the 'X-Men' adaptations. That isn't to damn it as worthless, however, and I enjoyed parts of this film quite a lot. If you're a Jessica Alba fanatic, you'll probably disagree with everything I wrote here, however.

In 'Fantastic Four's favor is a definite tongue-in-cheek feel. This will probably offend anyone who seriously followed the comic book, but I found it a refreshing change from all the dark, angst-ridden overly serious comic book adaptations from recent years. This isn't really a spoof, but it's closer in feel to the old Christopher Reeves 'Superman' movies and the Adam West version of 'Batman' than it is to, say, 'Blade' or 'Hulk.'

Actually, 'Fantastic Four' is probably closest to guilty 1980s pleasures like 'Flash Gordon' or 'Masters of the Universe' in that it looks slick at a distance but cheezier at closer quarters.

The movie's main problems are that it lacks a well-polished script and that it suffers by comparison to films like 'The Incredibles' and 'Batman Begins.' We're given absolutely no reason to care about either Sue Storm or Reed Richards, and Victor Von Doom is a vague cipher throughout; it's the supporting characters of Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm who really carry the bulk of the picture. Von Doom is particularly disappointing - one of the most important and dangerous characters in Silver Age comic books is reduced to a generic Evil White Capitalist. The effects are servicable but never truly allow you to believe that the Human Torch is really on fire or that Mr Fantastic can truly stretch his body.

Still, I laughed a lot - even if many of the laughs weren't intended by the filmmakers. Rent this film with realistic expectations and you won't be disappointed. Kids will especially enjoy this one.",1128556800,,1904,4.903726708074534

1554291,4,B00005JNTU,"I guess with all the negative reviews my expectations might have been lowered a little, but I actually kind of liked this movie. Sure, the plot has at least one gaping logic hole, they screwed up Dr. Doom, and the $100 million must have recirculated right back into the Fox execs pockets since it sure didn't go into the visuals, which were not much above television level, but the film had a good heart and was fairly true to the spirit of the comic. For whatever reason the makers just weren't bold enough to go all the way and chose a baby step, like they did with the first X-Men movie. We can validly criticize the choice of actors (Johnny Storm too old and too ""hunky,"" Sue Storm too young and not ""pretty"" like Naomi Watts) all we want, but I think they did their best to fill the roles they were assigned, and now they are part of the iconography. I'll buy the DVD when it comes out. For the most part this did look like a FF comic come to life. And it had a good heart. There was a lot more of Stretcho than I expected, though not enough of Reed the whiz inventor. The invisibility/force and Torch effects were spot-on. And the Thing performance was heart-rending, though the Thing costume did look like a grade-school science project.

1554361,3,B00005JNTU,"I like this movie a lot, but then I was (and probably still am) what Marvel founder Stan Lee used to call a ""true believer.""  During Marvel's heyday, in the 1960s, that was one of the many affectionate titles Lee had for faithful followers of Marvel Comics.  In fact, I was so enamored of Lee, Jack Kirby, and Steve Ditko that years later, when I moved to New York City at the age of 32, I actually got nervous every time I walked by the office building which housed the ""Marvel Universe."" (In those days it was on Madison Avenue, I think).  I wanted so badly to go up and look around but could never get the courage to do it.

Silly, huh?  I guess there's something about the way the pre-adolescent mind forms attachments to certain types of music, movies, and, yes, comic book heroes, that makes them resonate through adulthood in some way.  (In my third novel I have the narrator of the story describe a key character as resembling Reed Richards!  His fiance has no idea what he's talking about.  ""You know,"" he says, ""Mr. Fantastic."")

This is my way of saying that I really enjoyed Fantastic Four, the movie.  It is an almost word-for-word, frame-for-frame replica of the original comic, which means it's a bit lightweight in comparison to the Spiderman films (and the wondrous Ang Lee version of the Hulk).  Some of the motivations for the four characters come off as shallow and unrealistic, which was fine when you were reading the original comic book as a kid, but kind of hampers the film.

Still, if you loved reading about The Human Torch and The Thing, back in the day, you'll really get a kick out this movie.  I'd watch it again just to marvel at how Michael Chiklis brings Ben Grimm's feelings to life, even under that monstrous costume.  It's an amazing accomplishment.  And while there aren't a lot of set-pieces (just two, really), they're both quite astonishing.

1554363,3,B00005JNTU,"The new FANTASTIC FOUR movie is probably Marvel's weakest offering yet.

FF was a good family action/adventure movie, not a great one. The best thing about this movie was Chris Evans as Johnny Storm. He really defined the character and made it his own, the way High Jackman did for Wolverine & Tobey did for Spiderman. His dialogue & antics were hilarious! My son & I walked out of the movie wishing we were like Johnny. The dynamic between Torch & Thing was also really done well. They succeeded in making this a lighter, more humorous film than the others but I like my superheroes done seriously. (BatmanBegins is perfect example) I was disappointed at the Baxter Building, it wasn't impressive in the least - It's technology looking dated or cheesy. Reed Richards was equally unimpressive. He's supposed to be the smartest guy on the planet, I'm talking SCARY-GENIUS, but in this film, he was written and portrayed as just a moderately gifted scientist. (Note to Marvel: Before your guys write the sequel, rent a copy of ""A Beautiful Mind"") DR. DOOM was also portrayed as something other than what makes him Great in the books. In the comics, Victor Von Doom hates Reed simply because no matter how brilliant Doom is, Reed is smarter. That simple fact is what drives and consumes DOOM, whereas nothing else really matters to him. This film's DOOM has everything that he wants in life and doesn't really care that Reed's smarter, so his motivation in becoming evil is flat and not as psychologically interesting.

The effects were OK but nothing that pushes the envelope. It's always cool to see Johnny flame up and Reed actually does some cool stretching stuff in the climax.

Jessica Alba's character was written better than I thought it would be but Ben Grimm's character fell a bit short of my expectations.

Overall, the plot was simplistic and it didn't really capture the true flavor of the FF comic. It seemed like it was a TV episode, it should have been longer with more action sequences. I tried really hard to like this movie and I basically enjoyed it but it didn't knock me out of my seat like the other Marvel films did. The people in the audience laughed alot at the jokes and actually applauded at the end!? My wife & son like it too. (I thought to myself that maybe I was in a Bizarro universe but then I realized I was in Long Island...Same thing.)

Anyway, a good movie to see with your kids but was not as satisfying to me as I would have liked.

If they are going to make a sequel in the same lighter, humorous vein, they should give it a MEN IN BLACK flavor and let Barry Sonnenfeld direct it. (Sorry Tim Story) FF needs to have a cosmic spin to it, like MIB. Introduce Galactus, the Surfer, or the Skrulls, or the Kree, or even  Namor and a huge battle in the Hudson. FF has to be ridiculously larger than life, that's their appeal. (Car accidents on the Bklyn Bridge? More like the whole island of Manhattan transported into space by an alien force and Reed has to build a crazy technology weapon out of stuff he's got lying around to save the day.)

SEQUEL TO DO LIST:

1. Revamp the Baxter Building, it looks like something out of Ghostbusters. HI-TECH, HI-TECH, HI-TECH.

2. Hire new director and writers. Take storylines right out of the books.

3. Big Wedding in the beginning and birth of Franklin at the end.

What we have here is human beings (that aren't common to begin with) transformed into super-heroes (and a super-villain that was exactly that before he got his own powers). The plot gives those powers only one important function: to allow or disallow one (men) to get a girl. When Ben is converted into ""The Thing"" his beautiful wife abandons him in a micro-second (now he's ""ugly""). ""The Human Torch"" is all about being hot. ""The Invisible Girl"" is a convenient way of suggesting a naked Jessica Alba more than once (without showing it, because showing nakedness in America means a rating far away from profitability). And the only public or media question about ""Mister Fantastic"" seems to be if all of his body can be flexible (now that I think about it, he could do wonders).

Is it just me, or has anyone else honestly noticed a strange pattern with these ""comic book superhero"" adaptations to the ""big screen""? It seems to me that there is something which I'm beginning to refer to as the ""Marvel Curse"" going on -- where the 'debut' motion picture feature of a ""Marvel Comics"" superhero/superteam is just the most poorly handled/executed rubbish only to be followed by a remarkably better sequel; whereas the ""curse"" operates in just the opposite fashion where it concerns the ""DC Comics"" line of movie adaptations, where the 'debut' films are nothing short of exceptional only to degrade into mindless mush down the chain of sequels.

HOPEFULLY ""DC's"" worries will be over ""IF"" they can manage to keep the latest revamping of the ""BATMAN"" movie franchise (""BATMAN BEGINS"") from degenerating into the kind of juvenile puke that became of the '80s franchise.

""Marvel,"" on the other hand, is consistantly batting a 1,000 -- and that's not good. That old ""curse"" continues to haunt them with this lame (mis)handling of ""The Fantastic Four.""

Two words really sum up this movie: ""LOUD"" and ""UNINTERESTING.""

No doubt, much of the blame for that can be laid at the feet of director Tim Story -- but to hold him solely accountable is really quite unfair. This whole film stinks from all areas... from the screenplay all the way to the weak & unconvincing special effects. But even with all these faults going for it, the main culprit, in my opinion, who was responsible for preventing this picture from becoming what it MIGHT have been was the ""Casting Director"" who placed these severely MISCAST ""actors"" in the main character roles.

There was also little to no flavor of the original comic book source material present in this movie, which I'm quite certain gave many FF 'purists' near-upchuck episodes. (Maybe now you'll understand why so many of us get so upset over the mishandling of popular ""Asian Horror"" movies that ""Hollywood"" decides to [*ahem*] ""remake."")

Being at the helm of ""Fantastic Four"" undoubtedly gave Tim Story a chance to earn a few needed ""experience"" points for his resume in the Action/Adventure category, but his unfamiliarity with the genre coupled with the almost useless material he was given to work with may have hurt his credibility just a little bit. Maybe if they can pass the ""writing/screenplay"" torch over to someone else and give Tim Story another crack at directing the sequel (since ""Marvel"" movie sequels are consistantly better than their originals), then maybe he can regain the little respect this dog of a movie caused him to lose.",1126569600,4,2603,4.94279176201373

 This movie I would say was based on, not adapted from the Marvel comic BECAUSE it lacks the spirit, characteristics, and humanity of the comic series, which is why this comic has outsold any comic title by DC for almost 25 years. This movie has Hollywood written all over it.

 The fabulous foursome behaves like a family. Johnny Storm was never that cocky, Sue didn't behave like a spoiled lovesick woman, Reed was a genius full of confidence and Ben Grimm was the toughest but had more human characteristic of them all. Even DOC DOOM wasn't done right. There was no chemistry between the actors.

 This movie focuses on character developments, wish they'd have shown more action, it MAY have been a better movie instead of making a mess of each character. THE FANTASTIC FOUR ISN'T ALL ABOUT THE THING, same as the X-men is not all about Wolverine. Hollywood needs to realize this if they intend to make movies true to their  comic book counterparts.

 I hope they do a better job with the sequel, X2:X-MEN UNITED was a lot better than the first but it still needed work. I hope they make the 2nd Fantastic Four movie better but here's wishing they just stop making movies they think would make money,AND START making movies with quality like SPIDERMAN 2, SIN CITY, THE CROW and BATMAN BEGINS.(movies based on comic books)

 The bottom line is, if you're A COMIC BOOK FAN, skip this movie. This is the Hollywood version of the comic. Yes, it may be better than the unreleased F.F. movie by R. Corman but I remain unsatisfied.",1126569600,4,1765,4.643086816720257
1554517,2,B00005JNTU,"As an avid reader of the FF and Silver Surfer comics in the '60s I can safely say that the movie is an unabashed rip-off of a great story line.  The characters are nothing like their comic book forebearers and were updated simply for modern action fan appeal.  In the original Reed had confidence in all he did (not so in the current movie) likewise, Johnny was, in the otiginal, a  typical post high school ""kid"", not a pleasure seeking smartass (as in the current), Sue, originally, was the ""innocent little girl"" type instead of the current, confident businesswoman.  In the original she was able to act the victim even while saving everyones life, not so in the current.  Ben, in the original, was a big ""sensitive softie"" who could rip your head off if provoked.  Instead, we are given the current day, bitter, victim of circumstance, played by Mr. Chiklis.  Alicia (Bens girlfriend in the original) is completely absent. The action was passable, even if it was overplayed, but beyond that it's a loser, a major disappointment for anyone who read the original comic book series.",1126224000,3,1083,4.759358288770054
1554518,2,B00005JNTU,"I am an action fan and love action movies, yet I give this 2 stars. I do this mainly for the directing and not necessarily the story and content. I realize it is a remake of a comic book. Look at Spiderman, that could've been corny but it was directed well and you took it seriously. You couldn't take fantastic 4 seriously.

This movie relies on the audience knowing who the Fantastic 4 are. I bet money that 90% of the audience hasn't a clue who they are and/or read the comic book. It's not even a popular comic.

The directing should have been a lot better. Anytime you have a movie with a big rock-thing and a guy that can turn into Gumby you must make sure it doesn't become cheesy. And God, the ending was HORRIBLE and pure cheese. It was like a bad, live-action Disney ending.

Now, I give this 2 stars for ADULTS but if you are a 13 year old boy, you are gonna love this movie. Another mistake was making this PG-13. This was really borderline PG, if they omitted one or two minutes of violence it would have been.

I don't recommend this movie. MAYBE, if you are a Fantastic 4 fan and have read the comic you will enjoy it. For the rest of us, well, you may find yourself slapping your forehead for paying for this.",1126051200,2,1225,4.2
1554519,4,B00005JNTU,"Yet another comic strip makes the transition to the big screen, and actually does a pretty good job here, as we see a bunch a not exactly big name actors take on the roles of the quartet of superheroes.

The pace of the movie is good, with a lot of back story, in fact if I had to complain it would be too much back story actually.

Ioan Gruffudd (yes, it's a funny name) plays Reed Richards, the erstwhile partner and co-brain box of Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon of TV's Nip/Tuck fame). Richards is on the brink of bankruptcy, and has to return on bended knee and ask the now billionaire Doom for funding for a new space project, who gladly obliges for a more than healthy cut of any future profits.

Chris Evans as Johnny Storm (aka Human Torch) and the very sexy Jessica Alba as Susan Storm go along for the ride, with anchor man Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm in tow. If you know the story (which this is fairly faithful too), the team all get exposed to a funky solar storm in space, and return to Earth unharmed, except that they all, in turn begin to develop side effects to the space debacle, in the form of weird and amazing powers. Richards, leads his team of four, and decides to utilize their new skills for the good of all mankind, whilst Von Doom sees the opportunity to run amok with World domination on his mind. So the story is set up, and all this said would be great, if you now didn't have about only 15 minutes of the picture left. All the characters are played well, Evans has some great injections of humor, and Chiklis does his best to battle with a fairly lame sideline story about the cost of his new powers, on his former life. There is good screen sizzle between Richards, and Susan but all in all the picture leaves too much wanting.

As soon as the end credits rolled, I was ready for the sequel, having just felt like I'd been teased with a great story half done. This is a good movie, and the only real complaints would be those already mentioned, and McMahon not having enough villainous charm to truly carry off the Von Doom character, although he does try hard. I hope that the next installment will be along quick enough to keep the movie fresh, but 2-3 years wait may be a death sentence. Enjoy!",1125964800,3,2233,4.322195704057279
1554520,2,B00005JNTU,"I went into the theatre for this movie with high hopes even though I had been discouraged by the trailers and the reviews.  I tried very hard to go in with an open mind.  I knew that they had changed things from the comic book and I was trying to accept this.  I wanted to accept the movie on its own terms.

Without talking anymore about the changes from the comic book (which are grievous and plentiful,) I want to review it solely as a movie.  First, the characters are cardboard cutouts of real people.  They each have one, and only one, characteristic.  Reed is smart and this intelligence hampers his social interaction.  Sue is also apparently smart, though she doesn't have the wits to know she's dating the bad guy at the beginning of the movie.  She also does not display this intelligence in the movie in any capacity.  She only complains and strips.  That's it.  Johnny is a wild teenager.  At any and all costs he must be a wild teenager, no matter what happens in the movie.  Ben is strong and supposedly very loyal to his friends, though he inexplicably turns on Reed at one point in the movie for no reason.  Each of these bland characters has bland dialogue to match.

There is very little action in the movie, except for the silly bridge scene and the end fight with Dr. Doom.  Now, with Doom, it is very difficult for me to separate this portrayal from the comics.  Dr. Doom is my favorite comic book character of all time.  The Doom in the movie is one of my least favorite movie characters of all time.  Everything about Doom they get wrong.  Everything.  Even loooking at it just in the movie, his character is silly.  Completely silly.

The only reasons this movie gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that, at times, Johnny was almost good and also, at times, Ben was almost good and the effects weren't really that bad.  Everything else (like: characterization, dialogue, soundtrack, plot, most of the acting, directing, etc.) was just a waste of time.  I was expecting so much better.",1125705600,3,2002,4.506963788300836
1554521,3,B00005JNTU,"""Wow! You're hot!""

""Thank you. So are you."" - Johnny Storm still gets the chicks even if he is a flamer & a member of ""The Fantastic Four""

Another ""Marvel"" property is taken from the pages of its comic book & transferred to the big screen. But, this time it's the grandaddy of ""Marvel"" characters, ""The Fantastic Four"".

A group of scientists rocket into space to study the effects of a cosmic storm, but, due to a miscalculation the team is sent thru the storm, instead of near it.

The group survives to find themselves back on Earth in quarintine by their employer, Von Doom Industries. The group seems o.k., but, it isn't soon after that their bodies start to mutate.

For Ben Grimm, the co-pilot & space walker of the mission, his body starts to harden into rock while his molecular body structure, & organs change to compensate for the mutation. In otherwords he's completely made of rock inside & out.

For lead scientist, Reed Richards, his body has the ability to elongate & stretch to any length or size at any thought or impulse.

Richards' colleague, & former fiance, Sue Storm has the power to manipulate invisible shields of energy as well as becoming completely invisible herself.

Sue's brother, & pilot of the ship, Johnny Storm has the power of heat & flame & has the ability to place his entire body on fire and fly.

But, for Victor Von Doom things aren't so fantastic. The businessman behind this little science experiment has slowly lost his humanity, as his flesh slowly regenerates into solid steel and with this new power can conduct massive amounts of raw energy, dispensing it through his fingertips.

Reed trys to find a cure for their mutation (Ben being the most eager for him to find one, since he lost his wife), but, as the movie goes along everyone comes to accept their new selves. Von Doom uses his power to exact revenge on Richards (since he lost his girlfriend who went back to Reed, as well as his empire) by destroying The FF. It's up to Reed, Sue, Johnny, & Ben to stop Victor before he kills them, as well as, destroying the city.

""F4"" is an okay film, that can't be compared to the ""Spider-Man"" & ""X Men"" films. Its more in the league between ""Daredevil"" & ""The Shadow"".

The film starts off good, but, once everyone gets their powers the film starts to bog down on whether Reed can find a cure to change them back & whether each person really wants to make that change. Von Doom is threatening to a point, until he starts the formulaic kidnapping of one member to lure the others into the trap (lame).

The good points of the film are early on when each of the lead characters starts to discover their powers. Johnny Storm lends a lot of humor to the movie.

""Fantastic Four"" is decent enough for family fare, but, the film falls a little short of it's moniker.",1125360000,,2809,4.514792899408284

This movie was no other word for it: Fantastic. I loved every minute of it. Let me tell you, the director did an excellent job, and so did the person who was in charge of casting. The actors were great and so were the special effects. Also the jokes were funny too (most of them made by Johnny Storm who was very cute, but an egomaniac).

Although my father did nitpick at the differences between the comic and the movie (like the fact that Ben Grimm loved Susan), it was still a great movie.

1554652,3,B00005JNTU,"This film is not a betrayal, but it is a half betrayal.  You can excuse the ham-handed politically correct insertions.  You can semi-forgive the retconning of Dr. Doom as Ultimate Doom.  Moreover, the scriptwriters made him another run-of-the Hollywood-Script-Mill evil businessman (OsCorp, LexCorp, now DoomCorp), instead of the satanic genius and materialist magician that C. S. Lewis Spoke about (Screwtape Letters).  And you almost cannot forgive the lack of the over-the-top action and suspense that makes a movie worth seeing.

This films main problem is that the plot is one of destruction, specifically the self-destruction of the Fantastic Four.  We spend 106 minutes watching the Fantastic For try and figure out a way to undo the miracle that gave them powers.

Essentially, this is a snuff film-the FF want to commit suicide!

As Campbell points out, each hero goes through a ""Refusal of the Call,"" and eventually snaps out of it and follows through with the quest.  The FF spend the entire film refusing the Call, and finally cross the threshold in the last 15 minutes.  This worked for Unbreakable, but the film is more psychological, serous, and minimalist.

We expect Ben Grimm (marvelously played by Chiklis) to refuse the call, since he is so hideous, and Johnny Storm is the only one who finds the powers empowering, but he is such an airhead, it is meaningless.  Reed and Sue mainly focus on their relationship, and odd posing for the camera.

What makes Ben Grimm so likeable is that he is the only one who comes to really comes to terms with his powers, and fully accepts the calling as a hero.

So how to improve for FF2? First, get in touch with Dooms' Satanic side. Have him undergo some jackball Latvarian-Transylvanian rite that restores him to life.

Second-the heroes have come to terms with their powers.  Now explore their powers.  The Thing and Alicia Masters need to be taken to the next level; Johnny should get fed up with being  a flaming gigolo, and begin with Reed and Sue's wedding.

Keep the lighthearted humor (the plastic surgeon joke was classic), and the inside jokes (Franklin Richards is Reed's firstborn).  You have thirty years of FF material, take a poll form the fans.  Hmmm . . .how about Galactus?",1124496000,4,2249,4.881266490765172
1554653,3,B00005JNTU,"As an aging comic book fan, who has very fond memories of the Fantastic Four series, this recent film release brought them all back!  The comic book series was
one of the lighter entries in the Marvel universe- there was a campy dynamic between the characters, and a sense of humor that seemed to be missing in some
of Marvel's later comic series.  The Richards/Storm clan (+ Ben Grimm) was never as introspective, or dark as Spider Man, or the X-Men, but the stories were, nonetheless, satisfying, and the same must be said of the film version.
I was particularly glad to see the gleeful sparring between the Thing and the Human
Torch portrayed in the spirit that it had been in the comics.  Dr. Doom was handled
well, and visually the film was exciting to watch.
The casting was wonderful.  It was great to see Michael Chiklis (""The Shield""s Vic Mackey) in a lighter role. He managed to capture something of Ben Grimm's angst, and at the same time really camp it up!  Ioan Grufudd (of Hornblower fame!) was well cast as Reed Richards, although at first it was disconcerting to hear him speaking with an American dialect. The scene where he stretches for the first time is wonderfully hilarious.  Grufudd plays the role with a nice mix of befuddlement and intellect.  Julian McMahon was apt as Dr. Doom, gloomy & arrogant, elegant and spooky.
I really hope this lineup of the Fantastic Four gets another outing. Unlike most movie sequels, comic movies tend to get better in successive issues- once the initial premise is explained, and the characters and powers illustrated, its too late for any great story action to unfold in the first chapter!  There is a terrific wealth of entertainment in the FF series, especially in the early 70's when Lee and Kirby were spinning deleriously bizarre yarns, with Psychedelia-tinged artwork.",1124496000,4,1832,4.7936507936507935

1554655,3,B00005JNTU,"As the current wave of digital special effects superhero movies go, the Fantastic Four doesn't match to others in the genre like Spiderman 2, the first X-Men movie, or the recent Batman Begins.  Like the X-Men, the F4 are a team, but what's central to the film is the personality dynamics and clashes that occur between its four members, Reed Richards, Susan Storm, her brother Johnny, and Ben Grimm, whose alter egos are respectively the elastic Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Girl, who can also generate force field, the Human Torch whose temperature can go up to a supernova, and the Thing.  In the movie, it's the bratty, arrogant, smart-aleck Johnny who comes up with their names.

As the film begins, the four are working for Victor Von Doom of Von Doom Industries.  An outer space experiment goes awry as the team and their boss are caught up in a cosmic storm appearing earlier than predicted.  Back on Earth, everything seems fine, until they discover their special powers.  However, for Ben Grimm, who's transformed into the yellow, rocky behemoth, is less than thrilled, as he stays the way he is, coupled by his wife's leaving him.  He is thus the one most eager for Richards to find a cure to their condition, an eagerness than turns to impatience and frustration.

Part of that is due to Johnny, who's carefree, insulting, bratty attitude grates on his nerves.  I know-it sure did mine, as I've never seen anyone as obnoxious since Tom Cruise's character in A Few Good Men.  In a scene where the Thing crumples Johnny's expensive red Porsche into a compact ball, I mentally raised a fist in the air.  ""Well done, Thing!""  Johnny's the only one for the four who celebrates his condition, and the special effects of him as the Torch are actually laudable.  His flaunting attitude causes trouble for the other members, who want to be discrete so they can be left alone to find a cure, and for Doom, for whom the publicity causes his company's decline.

Much of the film focuses on Richards' attempts to reverse their condition, meaning to recreate the cosmic storm in the Baxter building.  However, there's also a subplot involving Reed and Susan, who were exes, but Reed was too focused on his work, so Susan drifted off to Victor, who was more a take-charge kind of guy.  Their predicament unites them together, as they try to sort out why their relationship ended.

Given Victor's last name, it's clear as to who he eventually becomes, but he too is affected by the aftereffects of the storm, and he turns darker as his stockholders decide to jump ships following the catastrophe.

There is a feeling that too much was being attempted in F4, the romantic subplot, scientific experiment subplot, conflicts within the members, which I found the most interesting thing in the movie, and later with Doom, and the two major action sequences.  But at least the Thing's clichd line ""It's clobbering time"" is used only once.  The ones to watch are Michael Chiklis (Ben Grimm/the Thing), Jessica Alba (Susan Storm/Invisible Girl) for obvious reasons, and despite what I said before, Chris Evans (Johnny Storm), with Julian McMahon (Victor von Doom) being a pale corporate head turned villain.

At least it's better than Daredevil, and hey, in terms of action movies, I've seen worse.",1123891200,48,3286,4.82174688057041

This woman's acting is so one dimensional, contrived and unconvincing that it's just too insulting to be in the audience.

The special effects... blah who cares! Been there done that. Walked out on this one half way through. Boring is bad but this movie is too irritating to even sit through.",1123545600,6,692,4.492063492063492

I was disappointed with Series of Unfortunate Events because the ending sucked. I was disappointed with Fantastic 4 because there was no ending.

Yes, I must admit, the movie starts out cool and gets cool in the middle. It gets you so energized and you just can't wait to see what's going to happen at the end in the big battle scene that has been building up from the beginning of the movie. But the big climax never comes. The ""big battle scene"" is a complete and total washout.

So I'm watching the movie, so far mildly enjoying it. I'm excited to see the big climax.

And then its almost time for the climax. I'm sitting on the edge of my seat right now, cramming popcorn into my mouth. This was it. The big battle scene building up from the beginning of the movie. But again, that's my point. There is no battle scene. They just set him on fire and then shoot water from a fire hydrant at him and then there's a little party scene and then...BAM! THE CREDITS.

As the credits appeared, I practically choked on my popcorn and had a heart attack. That was it. One of the most anticipated movies of the summer. I mean, if the battle scene HAS to be horrible, at least make it a good edge-of-your-seat action-packed ending with fistfights and lots of cool stuff. And make it at least 15 minutes long. Not just 5.

Plus, the humor in Fantastic Four is kiddy and really meant for little kids. With Tim Story directing the movie, the guy who directed Taxi, Barbershop, and currently working on a new comedy ""Ralph,"" I should've saw it coming. Why have a comedy director direct a superhero movie? Why not get Sam Raimi (Spiderman) or Ridley Scott (Alien) or even Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) to do it?! I mean, there are plenty of good action movie directors out there to direct Fantastic Four.

I give this movie 1/5 because it gets you all excited for nothing, and because the Fantastic Four, an action-packed comic book, got turned into a comedy movie.

And one last thing: The only thing you see in the movie is them trying desperately to find a cure for their fundamentally altered DNA. No action, just trying to find a cure. Then they TRY to fit in a battle scene at the end, and it fails terribly. That's why if you've seen the trailer, you've seen it all.",1123027200,6,2482,4.368763557483731

Still, I enjoyed this one. The movie may be considered a little slow since quite a bit of time is spent on the origin story. Of course that's what I'd expect since this is supposedly the first in a potential franchise. It's also interesting to see them all finally come together with their powers, in a scene (around the middle of the film) quite reminiscent of the first time Superman saves Lois Lane in the 1978 Superman movie. In regards to pacing, Dr Doom (once he discovers his powers) is dealt with in one battle at the end of the film pretty swiftly. Unlike for example Spider-Man 2 where Doc Ock made a few evil appearances before the final battle, in Fantastic Four Dr Doom discovers his powers during the extended origin and then our heroes get straight to it and that's the end of the movie.

Then when the movie comes out, the bad reviews began to come flying out from the critics!!! I got nervous, but then I saw a lot of good reviews from the audience!!! So today, I finally went to see the movie and I was very impressed and shocked to ask myself, ""How the HELL WAS THIS MOVIE HORRILBE!!!"" It was GREAT!!! The cast had great chemistry and the movie flowed well!!! The writing wasn't poor, the acting was good, the special effects were great, the comedy was just right, and everything seemed to fit at the end......SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM!!! Seeing them using their powers was great!!! Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic was very fitting, he portrayed the character like it should have been, Jessica Alba got a lot of flack when people found out she was going to play Susan Strom/Invisible Woman, but she really did a good job and impressed me!!! Chris Evans as Johnny Strom/Human Torch was hilarious as you can tell he really enjoyed playing the role!!! He stole almost every scene he was in!!! Micheal Chicklis, I agree, was born to play Ben Grimm/The Thing!!! His portrayl really made you feel for the character, more than you should have!!! Then lastly, we have The Fantastic 4's infamous nemisis, Victor von Doom aka Dr. Doom played by Julian Mcklain!!! I'm very familar with Julian as he was on The Pratice and Charmed(my favorite show)!! Some critics say that he didn't pull off the role!! But I think he did great as I know for a fact that Julian can play the villian roles very well!!! The movie did kind of rush how they got there powers, but everything after that was just great!!!

  I don't understand how this movie wasn't as good as Spider-Man or The X-Men like people are saying!!! It had a great balance of drama/humor/action that the other marvel movies had!!! What people don't understand is the Fantastic Four is one of the most unqie superhero stories as it tells a story of a family with super powers!!! They have to deal with trusting each other, understanding each other, and knowing the meaning of maturing and standing up for yourself!!! Peter Parker had to learn this so he could fully become Spider-man remember, just like The Fantastic 4 had too!!! But Spider-man learned it faster because he didn't have 3 other people in his position, he had to work alone!!! The Fantastic 4 had to understand each other as people before they could understand their powers before they could stop Doom, and the film did that very well!!! So to all the people who hated this movie, WATCH IT AGAIN!!! Because it makes me sick seeing all these bad reviews for no reason, it's ridiculous!!! Watch the movie and understand it's true message, don't compare it to other films like Spider-man because that's why you hate it in the first place!!! Your watching it for what Spider-Man and X-men was, and not for what this movie is!!! I'm proud to say I loved this movie, and seeing how successful this movie has been at the box office, I definately can't wait to see Fantastic 4 2!!!",1122681600,9,3110,4.610108303249097
1554779,2,B00005JNTU,"When you make a movie based on the Fantastic Four comic, this is what you have working against you:

-The Fantastic Four is a beloved Comic Book.

-The definative superhero group characters created by Stan Lee in the 60's along with his other ultra-icon Marvel heroes are introduced (later followed by the X-Men).

-These characters have been archetypes in not only the comic book industry, but in comic book movies, making these heroes seem tired and cliched, before even the movie trailer begins.

-Some of the these movies used Marvel concepts so close that concepts accident ran together, most recently the Incredibles: which had a team with strongman, a super-stretcher, an invisible girl with forcefields, and a baby who has flame-power along with multiple other powers. Infact, a scene was cut from the F.F. Movie, with the Thing rescuing a cat from a tree by ripping the tree from the ground and shaking it, because the Incredibles ""beat them to the punch!""

-No amount of ""Re-inventing"" without completely losing the original concept can alter the ""retro-ness"" even the {forgive me} cheesyness of the superhero group. So anyone making a F.F. movie, even someone who wasn't Roger Corman, would have to struggle with this. This extends to the special effects, no amount of SFX will alter the fact that a guy wrapping his body around a rock-man is not going to be real believable!

On the plus side:

-This F.F. filmmaker would still have Stan Lee's words, written during a time of extreme civil-strife and change, still ring true, urging us to ""judge, not on appearances, but actions"" I believe that that message, is still apparent in this 2005 film version.

-Good casting is an factor working in this films favor, especially (Michael C.'s)the Thing, who like the comic is the most interesting, the most ""human"" character. This was the sledge-hammer irony Stan Lee was going for in the comic and it remains in the film. The Johnny Storm / Ben Grim dynamic is fun, if forced, this is perhaps the single across-the-board flaw of the film. Everything is a little forced, to the altering of the origin to include Dr. Doom, down to the need to untransform the Thing. I would rather have seen the Galactus/ Silver Surfer storyline intergrated into an origin story (while we're forcing things here.)

Even in the world of post-Spider-Man movies, Fantastic Four is still a comic book movie, not a Graphic Novel movie or an art house film. It is a fun film, no more, no less.

1554781,5,B00005JNTU,"It's all Spider-Man's fault.  Ever since 2002, when ""Spider-Man"" debuted the week before the then-latest ""Star Wars"" film and proved to be a powerful contender in its own right against the intergalactic juggernaut, movie studios have been dragging out every Marvel or DC Comics license they can get their hands on and turning them into feature films.  Some are bombs (""The Hulk""), others do moderately well (""X-Men""), and some are even wildly successful (""Spider-Man 2"").  But all are generally the same:  The origin of classic comic book characters as they take down one of the fans' favorite villains.

 The latest offering in the comic book superhero department is ""The Fantastic Four"", about a quartet of colleagues with some very strange powers.  While on a space station monitoring a cloud of cosmic radiation, the cloud comes too close for comfort and exposes the scientists to the radiation, altering their DNA.  It is a comic book movie after all, its gotta be a little implausible.

The ""leader"" of this new band of heroes is Reed Richards, a.k.a. Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd), who can stretch and bend his body at will.  A methodical, scientific man, Richards is glacial when it comes to making decisions, especially romantic ones, such as how to proceed with his relationship with Susan Storm, The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba), who is able to project forcefields and (obviously) become invisible.  Susan's brother Johnny, now The Human Torch (Chris Evans) is a wise-cracking daredevil who can spontaneously combust at will and can, for some reason, fly.  Finally, there's poor Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who was the most exposed to the radiation, who becomes the orange rock-like The Thing.

 What makes this film stand out from other superhero movies is that rather than having the ""lone wolf"" superhero like Spider-Man or Batman, there's a whole group of them, which leads to interesting character dynamics.  Similar to Disney's ""The Incredibles"" in many ways, even down to most of the superpowers, ""The Fantastic Four"" capitalizes on its characters' relationships.

 This film has been criticized for having not enough action and too much character development, ironic considering that the problem with most comic book movies is actually the opposite.  ""Fantastic Four"" was entertaining for me because it's different.  Oh sure, there's the bad guy (getting the award for the cheesiest Bad Guy Name in history: Victor Von Doom, played by Julian McMahon) who must be stopped, but that takes a backseat to the larger problem of how these people must learn to deal with their newfound abilities and fame.  This is more then ""good guy-bad guy-fight"": and in fact, that particular aspect has been toned down to let the character struggles between the heroes take center stage.

 ""The Fantastic Four"" is at heart, just another comic book superhero movie, but it is one that is done with honest care for good characters, good humor, and actual drama, as opposed to gratuitous violence and awesome special effects.",1122595200,7,3024,5.116089613034624
1554782,4,B00005JNTU,"Here is an interesting anecdote: At the cinema where I watched Fantastic 4, as I was exiting with my wife, a young man about ten or twelve years old, declared to his older brother, about fiteen, ""This was really, cool!"" and his brother replied ""Yeah but they copied ""The Incredibles a little, don't you think?""

Enter an older, fat, eighteen or nineteen year old geek from stage left, and his geekish cluster of pond scum friends with acne, who proceeded throw a tantrum, calling this poor little kid a ""stupid, f(beep)king moron"", who ""didn't know s(beep)t about comics"", ""this movie sucked b(beep)ls"" and this shocked boy a few years younger, and many sizes smaller should keep his mouth shut about things he knew nothing about.

Nice to ruin a little kid's day like that, don't you think? After the film I was feeling a little heroic. Now I'm not going to match wits with a bully, so I put it in terms he understood--- I went upside his fat, greasy head with the back of my hand, and demanded he apologize, and mean it, or he was going to be sorrier than ever. His so-called friends shrank from his side and with no way around me he apologized and started making excuses for his behavior. ""I get so mad when people don't know what they're talking about."" I went upside his head again just on principle. When I come here and read bad reviews of a good movie like this... this particular situation made me wonder about the people writing them.

I don't have to rehash for you what a million people before me have already said about The Fantastic 4. It's a pretty good movie, worth my dollars if not yours. The ""reviews"" here that bash it... it's pathetic.

Find a bad review here, and then click on ""see all my reviews"", and you'll learn as I did; these angry plankton hate everything they see. Some of them I suspect hate their lives more than any film, and they have to spew their venom somewhere. Welcome to the Internet.

Others, like the meatball who recieved a harsh lesson in manners, are probably just angry that their tiny, insulated, comic book nichce has had a spotlight shone on it, and what they believe was once a sub-cultured, members-only club for outcasts like themselves is now part of the mainstream.

It's a disaster for these people that well adjusted folks, who have better things to do than read comic books and better people to do it with, in other words people with lives, can enjoy these stories as well, and don't give much notice to the so-called ""true history"" of comic books such as The Fantastic 4.

I personally couldn't care less. Stan Lee did a cameo in the movie. He wrote the damn comic. He's okay with it, then what's the problem? It must cost them sleep that one of their Gods doesn't take much notice that he's alienating their little fandom of his comic. I guess he'd rather count money or something. But why wouldn't Stan Lee, or anyone with a brain, sell punks like this out? Makes sense to me. Click on how this didn't help, dorks. I care about as much as Stan Lee cares.

1554783,5,B00005JNTU,"Dr. Reed Richards is sure he has found a scientific breakthrough.  All he has to do is convince billionaire (and nemesis) Victor Van Doom, to help him reach a cosmic storm in order to observe it.  While Victor agrees to the use of his private space station, the price is almost all profit made from this research.  On the space station, Reed and the rest of his team: best friend, Ben Grimm; ex-girlfriend, Susan Storm; her hotshot brother, Johnny Storm; as well as Doom himself, are shocked when something goes amiss and everyone is exposed to the cosmic storm.

Back on Earth, they discover that the cloud has altered their DNA, giving each a type of super power.  Reed, Susan, Ben, and Johnny band together in an effort to analyze what has happened to them and find a way to reverse the effects.  Mr. Fantastic: Reed has the ability to stretch and contort his body.  The Invisible Woman: Susan can make herself invisible and create an energy shield.  The Human Torch: Johnny is able to go up in flames- literally- and fly.  The Thing: Ben is now rock-hard and has superhuman strength.  Unfortunately, Van Doom has also been given powers, and unlike the others, decided to use them for evil.  Now he is bent on revenge for the loss of power the cosmic storm fiasco caused and will do anything to destroy Reed and the rest of the `Fantastic Four'.

While the Fantastic Four may not be up to the same level as Spider-man was, I still enjoyed seeing it.  The movie itself focused on how the FF got their powers and why they became a team more than anything else.  The villain- Doom- didn't even become really evil until the end.  As with all movie adaptations of comic book heroes, some things were changed, taken, and added to the story, but the effect was the characters seeming more real, which I liked.  The story was a little hurried which made it seem somewhat unbelievable, but then again, the movie is supposed to be `fantastic'.

1554785,4,B00005JNTU,"Don't believe a lot of the negative hype about this movie.  While some longtime comic book fans are griping that this is not the Fantastic Four they know and love, the movie skillfully captures the essence of the characters who launched the current generation of Marvel superheroes back in the 1960s.

Granted the FF may not be the household names that the X-Men or Spiderman have become but those characters wouldn't be what they are today if Reed Richards and company hadn't paved the way.

Most of the criticism I've heard from longtime fans of the comic centers on the tweaking of the characters' origins.  Yes, the film does take major liberties with the origins of the FF and particularly their nemesis, Doctor Doom.  But given the huge amount of time that has passed since the first issue of Fantastic Four hit newstands in the early 1960s and today the changes make sense.

After all, as originally presented way back in Fantastic Four #1 Reed Richards, Sue and Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm were desperate to get into space(where they would face the cosmic ray bombardment that gave them their powers) in order to beat a competing Russian space launch.  This may have played well during the Cold-War era 60s.  But in 2005, more than a decade after the Berlin Wall has fallen and when Space Shuttle launches are commonplace, such a premise now sounds about as fresh as 50-year-old bread.

The other complaint I've heard is about the major revisions to the origin of Doctor Doom.  Here Victor Von Doom isn't the armored monarch of fictional Eastern-European nation, Latveria.  He's actually the owner of the mega corporation that funds Richards' launch to an orbiting platform where the cosmic ray storm will be studied.  Furthermore, he actually accompanies the four on the mission later gaining powers of his own.

Changes aside what's most important to me is the question of whether or not this movie captures the spirit of the Fantastic Four.  The answer is a resounding ""yes!""  The key to the appeal of the FF has always been that unlike say the Justice League or the Avengers, they were truly a family.  Sue and Johnny were siblings and Reed Richards later married Sue.  Ben Grimm was always the sort of surly but lovable unofficial uncle to the clan.

The actors here capture this perfectly.  Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans ARE the Thing and the Human Torch and the light-hearted bickering between the two that fans of the comic know and love is on full display here.  Ioan Gruffud nails the brainy Mr. Fantastic and Jessica Alba is smart, sexy, and looks about as good as you could expect in the Invisible Woman's tights.

The action sequences, though not ground-breaking play well and are a joy to watch.  The script is perhaps a bit too talky but that's not a surprise.  After all, this is the first FF film and it is therefore, mostly set up for future movies.

This is to be expected for a film that not only launches the FF but also introduces the villain who will come to be known as the team's arch-enemy.  Spoiler alert:  Comic fans may be pleased to know that despite the changes to the cinematic version of Doom, the film's ending suggests this character's future will be closer to what they've seen in the comic books.

The overall tone of the film is one that's far more light-hearted than most recent Marvel movies.  While this may offend some, I consider it as a refreshing change of pace.  The X Men movies, ""Daredevil"", and certainly ""Hulk"" were all grim affairs to some extent.  ""Fantastic Four"" director Tim Story  never forgets that, above all, a good superhero movie should be fun.  He keeps the film moving at a brisk pace and balances the laughs with more serious moments.

All in all you could do far worse than invest two hours of your life watching this movie.  This is definitely one case where a movie lives up to its title.  Fantastic.",1122336000,4,3877,4.676514032496307

Jessica Alba has really emerged as a beautiful woman and a pretty good actress. She provides good eye candy. The Thing is the best part of the film. It's quite sad watching him try to adapt to being huge and made of rock. It's amusing to watch himself hate the way he is for being so different. You kind of feel sorry for him throughout the film.

I do regret the lack of action in this film. But, that does leave a good door open for a sequel especially since this film is doing well at the box office.

Oh, right, the movie. Um, Jessica Alba was cute. And, um, Jess -- wait, I said that already.

The first 3/4 of the movie is mostly nothing. Nothing much happens, then they go to a space station. There's a cosmic storm, and nothing much happens and they go home. Then everyone start turning weird, but nothing much happens. Then there's a big fight and the bad guy loses but he doesn't completely lose so we can have a sequel. The end.

Johnny Storm is an insufferable egotist with a forethought horizon measured in milliseconds. Testosterone driven teenaged boys will relate. Sue Storm (Jessica) is the director of bio-something at a billion dollar corporation and fitting mate for gray haired Reed Richards, despite her pouty seventeenish demeanor. Ben Grimm was true to the F4 I remember from years ago, but his lovely romantic interest seemed to be tacked on at the end. Alicia (Kerry Washington) is a charmer though, so I won't complain.

It's a silly-season summer flick. If you're a pureblood Marvel fan-boy [-girl], it's a must see movie. If you have a small boy, you'll be dragged to see it. Otherwise, wait til it shows up in rentals and you've seen everything else at the store.

So Ioan Gruffed & Michael Chicklis weren't war buddies, Sue Storm has a *job* & her brother Johnny is a pilot.

Still it's a story about a family - an oddly-created family, but a family w/the obnoxious kid brother, the dumb dad & exasperated mom, & the gruff golden-hearted older brother.

1554893,3,B00005JNTU,"Considering that in the Marvel history, ""The Fantastic Four"" was the company's first major comic success, this film adaptation is justified; however, following on the heals of the far superior ""Spiderman"" and ""X-men"" films, the movie falls short.  Like those, it spends a great deal of time ""introducing"" the quartet, along with the group's longtime foe, Dr. Doom.  Understandably, some liberties are taken and changes are made to satisfy the movie audience.

One of the major changes comes as a result of the respective ages of cast members.  Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Ben Grimm, and Victor Von Doom are supposed to be college classmates; but, the actors playing them fall in three different age brackets: Ioan Grufford (""Reed"") is 32, Michael Chiklis (""Ben"") is 42, Julian McMahon is 37, and Jessica Alba (""Sue"") is a mere 24.  ""Johnny Storm"" is Sue's YOUNGER brother but the actor playing him (Chris Evans) is the same age as Alba.  Perhaps, the actors were the best ones for the respective roles but the age discrepencies contradict the original story line.

SPOILER ALERT!

The action scenes are too familiar.  The group's first introduction to the New York population on a heavily-trafficked bridge seems as though it was lifted from the first ""Superman"" flick.  The one major battle with Dr. Doom is eerily too similar to ""Superman II"".

The Torch's attempt to evade a heat-seeking missile is a bit derivative of all those similar situations in movies that preceded this one.

McMahon's ""Dr. Doom"" pales in its villainy to Ian McKellan's ""Magneto"" or even Alfred Molino's ""Doctor Octopus"".  McMahon seems to be trying too hard at the ""evil thing"".

Chiklis is believable as ""The Thing"" and Evans possesses enough bravado to bring the hot-headed and immature ""Torch"" to life.

The characters, for the most part, are likeable and engaging enough that a sequel is inevitable.

I will not describe the plot in detail, suffice to say that the group is accidentally exposed to cosmic radiation which alters their DNA and themselves as well.  In some cases, the change is welcome - Johnny Storm can hardly wait to show off.  In others, it is comical - Reed Richards can stretch like Gumby, his wife can become invisible at will (except for her clothes) and project a very nasty forcfield.  Unfortunately, in the case of Ben Grimm, the change mutates him, turning him into a giant rock-like creature, the ""thing"".

1554972,3,B00005JNTU,"The Fantastic Four are the latest addition from Marvel heroes to hit the screen. Starring Ioan Gruduff, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Julian McMahon and Michael Chikis, this is just another big, loud, special effects-packed movie with a bland story. Even admitting it is a fun movie to watch, I have to say is just as forgettable as a bad hair day. When compared to Pixar's The Incredibles, a truly magnificent movie, I can't help but realize the Fantastic Four turned their characters into a silly cartoon, while The Incredibles did just the opposite.

The Four gain their powers during an accident in space. Mr Fantastic, alias Dr Reed Richards, possesses the properties of an infinitely stretchy rubber band. Sue Storm, his ex girlfriend (not for long) is the Invisible Woman, capable of creating field forces. Her brother, Johnny, is the Human Torch, who has with the ability to combust and turn his body into a heat missile without doing himself the slightest bit of damage and Ben Grimm becomes the Thing, a moving rock pile with a gravel voice, a heart of gold and the strength of Hercules, who is also the group's tragic figure, because unlike the others, he cannot turn his powers on and off.

The first half of the movie is pure fun scenes, with the Four learning about their powers, Chris Evans tormenting the Thing, and their whiny complaints about their new changes.

The director works very well the moments when the fantastic collides with the everyday. But character is incidental. The film's real business lies in bigness. Blowing things up, driving them off roads and bridges, watching them crumble, freeze and burn.

The acting is standard, only because the script doesn't give these actors much to do. The only exception is Michael Chiklis as The Thing, who although covered in that afwful rubber suit is the character best exploited, physically and emotionally. And Julian Mc Mahon, who gets to be the evil Dr Doom, very well casted but they could have get much more from him.

1554973,5,B00005JNTU,"I read the professional reviews by people like Roger Ebert.  I ignored their negative attacks and went to go see this film.  I am very glad I did.  I found this movie to have a little bit of everything and a whole lot of action.

Let's start off with an explanation of why Ebert didn't like this film: Roger Ebert is an extreme LIBERAL and a politically correct junkie; unless a film has some ""leftist message"" or has a ""leftist actor"" in it, he probably is going to knock it.  This film is NOT politically correct, has no jokes bashing the current president, doesn't support abortion or euthanasia, and doesn't take a stand on gay rights.  Of course Ebert is going to hate the film!  Ebert has taken that whole ""liberal arts"" thing completely out of context.

Oh, one more thing, had this film sprinkled the ""F"" word in every thirty or forty seconds, had some severe love scenes, and showed the cast helping little old bag ladies across the street in between real emergencies, Ebert would have put his useless thumbs up!

I have read some reviews about how this was just a comic book made into a film. DUH!  That's exactly what it is, and exactly what I expected to see when I sat down with my garbage bag full of popcorn and gallon of Coca-Cola in a crowded theater.

Fantastic 4 is an action-packed film with a lot of laughs and a lot of action.  Also, this film did a lot more to build up the audience's disdain for the bad guy, Victor Von Doom.  Spider-Man 2 failed to do that, and in my opinion, if a movie fails to make the audience want to see the bad guy get smashed then it's failed to do its job.

On to the cast:

Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards is a perfect fit.  He catches the personality perfect, and it was fun to watch him try and keep the other members of the Fantastic 4 inline.

 Jessica Alba as Sue Storm worked for me.  Yeah, I've read the reviews here at Amazon.  I know she's a cutie and all that.  But I'm a happily married man, and besides, my wife might see this review.  So I'll just tell ya that I think she is the best Sue Storm ever!  Seriously, she can act, and I really enjoyed her work on screen with Ioan (does anyone even know how to pronounce that) and the rest of the cast.

Chris Evans turns in his best performance to date as Johnny Storm.  He really made the film fun to watch.  Of course some of the credit has to go to Michael France and Mark Frost for writing such an excellent script / screenplay.

Michael Chiklis is the perfect Ben Grimm.  My thirteen-year-old daughter was balling her eyes out when he was trying to pick up his wife's wedding ring on the bridge.  Never has any person so nailed a super-hero character the way Chiklis does in this film.  I used to read the Fantastic 4 comic books as a kid, and I would have never dreamed the Thing could have ever made it to the big screen in such a convincing manner.  Great job Chiklis!  I think you should put the suit back on and pay Roger Ebert a visit!

Julian McMahon, I just want to let you know that I hated you from the opening scenes on!  You make me sick; exactly what a bad guy is supposed to do.  Great job as Victor Von Doom.  I hope there is a sequel.  I'd like to see if you could pull it off two times in a row.

I liked everything about this movie: the writing, casting, special effects, music, and even the movie posters.  I think the professional movie critics who panned this movie need to find new careers.

1554978,4,B00005JNTU,"Exposed to outer space radiation- including 1 to-be super-villain, four space explorers garnered super human characteristics this side of the XMEN, altering their human DNA that entitled em to possess such qualities of super powers, that back in the earlier years of moviedom one can only wonder how the heck can they manufacture such characters live action on screen, such as a stretching person that'd be more flexible than a bar of Tootsie Roll, or a girl that could turn partially/impartially invisble (not to mention make her appear titally naked on a PG-13 movie.. invisibly that is), or a guy who consists completely of Fire, and a hulking mastadon figure completely consisting of bricks and stone. Although sci-fi fx dept.s have done quite well at times in the history of motion pictures since the days of Harryhousen's Dynamation (later labelled as Stop-motion animation)'s effects, to film the FANTASTIC FOUR comes quite unthinkable even just as far back in the '80's.

However, ever since the dawning of computer/Digital animation effects are incorporated in the movie making industry (initiated by the 1984 flick THE LAST STARFIGHTER), nothing seemed to be impossible nowadays as far as special effects are concerned. Thus, its no longer a concern whether movie makers could make such and such certain scenes filmed out- but how well they have executed it well with em CGI effects comes as the matter to consider now. Unfortunately, not a lot of movies did well in executing them cgi special fx, even though the capabilities of the computer effects are quite impressive- they just hadn't handled it well enough to the point that the effects went quite lazy and even totally boring and out of context with the scenes (just look at that balony sci-fi movie called the MATRIX). Thus when I heard that they would finally come up with a flick highlighting MARVEL's first ever title the FANTASTIC FOUR, i kinda scoffed 'big deal', but then again they've done it quite well enough in the proportion of a little notch higher than their decent execution of the uncanny XMEN into the celluloid genre, it turned out.
Now I'm glad that they've finally made it possible to pitt these comic book characters into the screen.

It seems to be that MARVEL is quite having a ball in the movie industry these days. Whence they started out with them stiff comic cut-out animations from a handful of their titles (CAPT AMERICA; IRON MAN; SUBMARINER; THOR; HULK; then later on SPIDERMAN; AVENGERS; and a dull adaptation of FANTASTIC FOUR with Torch being replaced by a Robbie the Robot prototype, man i remember the theme songs for these cartoon series's), its not until back in the late seventies when they come up with live action adaptations for their titles - basically series' made in Canada, for TV: CAPTAIN AMERICA, INCREDIBLE HULK (Starring the late Bill Bixby, who'd turned to Lou Ferrigno, whenever Mr. McGee would make him angry - shacking Hulk into PrimeTime soap), and the short lived SPIDERMAN, plus (the only quite decent Marvel tv title then) DOCTOR STRANGE, which levels on a more adult oriented plotline (kinda like the british flick HARLEQUIN starring Jesus of Nazaretth himself- Robert Powell), which to my knowledge only went so far as a couple/pair of TV Movie episodes - made for a tv special back in those days. Whilst during in those days the other older rival comic book company have long scored a lot with its titles in cartoon, and in live-action tv series, that then ultimately instated a sort of prominence in the late seventies when they came up with the Alexander Salkind produced SUPERMAN THe Movie, and went on for some more in the suceeding years, while MARVEL on the other hand just went on to settle with animated series's including two live action titles for live-action movie feature: 1989's The PUNISHER, and CAPTAIN AMERICA.

With what MARVEL have come up with its major movie titles these days - it seemed they could even come around with adapting particular cross-overs and plotlines that went in with their characters' universe as for what took place from the very pages of their respective comic book titles, such as: the team up between SPIDEY and DAREDEVIL battling an enigmatic villain from the realm of the undead for the very soul of the latter mentioned character; Pitting THE HULK to clobber with FANTASTIC FOUR's very own THE THING (yeah, just like in the comic books - it's just that (along with the DAREDEVIL flick) it's THE HULK movie that don't seem to've turned out so well for me); on another note for THE XMEN plotline its coming to the Pheonix saga quite obviously... and in all the possiblities of the prospective following movie adaptations for GHOST RIDER, another rehash of THE PUNISHER; THOR... perhaps in turn MARVEL could finally come up with a movie for their equivalent to the other comic book company's JLA -- The AVENGERS (with Scarlet Witch and her impossibly inhuman hubby The Vision).

This movie depiction for FANTASTIC FOUR went swell in its overall composure, only that it could've used a little more spice then it would've been a real blast though.
I only thought that they could have had someone else than Jessica Alba (star of that other comic book title tv series DARK ANGEL) to portray Invisible Gurl, but then again that one particular scene in the climax when she blew out some force wave in their battle against Doom til her nose bleeds puts her in a really pretty impressive sexy screen shot, NO PUN. Love it. She's looks so pretty cool its hot! Btw, Thing's girlfriend Alicia's depicted as a black woman in this flick which serves as one of the major alterations from the comic book basis.
Had Doom evolved in his powers? Oh well...

Eventually Stan ""The Man"" Lee had to appear on cameo as a mail man, as with every MARVEL flick these days; check it out. As for DR. DOOM, well, DR. DOOM could've used a Vader-like voice though, say couldn't they have incorporated David Prowse and the respectable actor who played Vader's voice, Mr. James Earl Jones?.. but then again Lucas mite sew (or rather sue) their hides.

For the meantime, looks like MARVEL's doing well to make the other rival company make a run for their money - thus they've revamped the latest movie franchise that had gone bonkers due to Schumacher's gaity, whilst the prospecting ""Nicholas Cage""s prospect to star as SUPERMAN V folded (that it should), and hence they have to do a lot of catching up with their line for the movies.

Hell! until them two competing major comic book companies find the nerve to clash SUPERMAN vs. SPIDERMAN like in the comic books waaay before FREDDIE vs. JASON (kinda like tis in the days of GODZILLA vs. KING KONG), then that'll be the day to say ITS CLOBBERING TIME!

Say, howzabout the ELEMENTALS?

MARVEL Not, I say unto thee all. Nuf said.

1554979,4,B00005JNTU,"This movie is not quite as good as Batman Begins, but it is very entertaining nonetheless.  I disagree with some of the movie critics who didn't like the special effects.  I thought they were pretty good.

I agree that the actor who played Mr. Fantastic was a little bit stiff but many things from the original comic book are there like the fighting between the Thing and The Torch.  There is a lot of sympathy for the Thing as he realizes that for him, his powers are a curse especially when he can't do any simple things anymore like ride an elevator (he is too heavy) or pick up tiny objects (his fingers are too big).

Dr. Doom in many ways was like the Green Goblin in the Spiderman movie in that he became insane and killed because of his powers.

This is the type of movie where you look forward to a sequel because it took most of the movie to get the group to how they were in the comic.  With that out of the way the next movie will be really great.  I am thinking The Submariner or Galactus will be in the next one.",1121558400,3,1026,4.146464646464646
1554980,4,B00005JNTU,"I actually walked into the theater expecting a not-so-great film, but I was very wrong about that.  This movie was awesome.  I am an avid Marvel comic fan and I love the Fantastic Four, they are definitely on my list of favorites.

I thoroughly enjoyed the story, I loved all the characters but my favorite is Ben Grimm.  I thought his rock suit wouldn't be believeable onscreen but it actually is, and I was pleased with that.  I was also grinning ear to ear when those two vintage FF lines were put into the movie ""It's clobberin' time"" and ""Flame On!"".  I absolutely loved the onscreen relationship between Johnny and Ben, it was hil-freaking-arious, very good indeed.

A couple gripes with the film.  I wasn't too happy with how they changed Doom's origin, but I understood that it's hollywood and they were gonna make some tweaks.  I didn't like how Doom had powers, the last time I checked he was a scarred man in a metal suit, who was very brilliant, a megolomaniac, and a tyrant.  And lastly I wasn't happy with how Vic's voice underwent no change at all from man to mask.  When he was in the Dr. Doom get-up and he delivered his lines I didn't buy him as the menacing Doom, it didn't sound threatening at all, ya know?  I have a feeling in the second movie they'll change his voice and they'll probably explain it too.  That last scene in the film gave me the gitters, I can't wait for the sequel...let's hope for Doombots!!!",1121472000,2,1434,4.469230769230769
1555090,2,B00005JNTU,"Where to start? Given the recent crop of actually good superhero movies (""Batman Begins"" being at the top of the list, followed by ""The Incredibles,"" ""Spider-Man 2"" and a few others), I had high hopes for this film. I confess, I know nothing about the comic-book history of the Fantastic Four, so I relied on the film to give me all the information I needed.

The film turns out to have done too thorough a job at this. There is suprisingly little action in the movie; at least the first hour is seemingly devoted to nothing but listing names and occupations and nick-names and special powers and responsibilities and theories and...well, you get the idea. I have nothing against a little backstory (""Batman Begins"" is almost nothing but backstory and yet is one of the best movies I've seen in a long while) but ""Fantastic Four"" takes so long setting up the story that it fails to interest me in the protagonists. Additionally, their superhero names all-too-frequently are so similar to others that I had difficulty establishing them as unique entities.

The acting, for the most part, is lacklustre at best, though how much of this is the high-school-play-style script's fault and how much responsibility lies with the actors is an open question. I've been a fan of Ioan Gruffudd's since his Horatio Hornblower days, and he's acquitted himself well in many things, but here his Mr. Fantastic (could there BE a less inventive name for the guy?) is ramrod-stiff and unengaging as a dreary goody-two-shoes who couldn't be less believeable as a superhero if he tried. Jessica Alba is a pretty face but very little else as the Invisible Girl, and her smarmy yet surprisingly vapid delivery doesn't help me believe that she's a scientist or astronaut or whatever she's supposed to be. Julian McMahon is not quite as bad as Dr. Victor Von Doom, but really...why does that surname not make anyone in this movie uncomfortable? Isn't it rather a tip-off to his character? The only people who are at all engaging or entertaining to watch in this film are Michael Chiklis, who brings a certain pathos to his role as The Thing (though one really never gets to see much of his face beneath the foam latex, which is a shame), and Chris Evans as the Human Torch, who doesn't seem to be taking anything seriously and is the only one to nail the vapid light-heartedness that this film sorely needs.

The special-effects are sorely underwhelming, even cartoonish, which may or may not be intentional but look morbidly out of place on a large screen. This movie may be the only one this summer to have a chance of being improved by watching it on DVD. The Thing is very, very obviously Michael Chiklis in a foam latex suit. Mr. Fantastic is really, really NOT fantastic, and it's rather gruesome to watch him stretch and bend quite as much as he does, particularly as he gets grainier with every, ahem, stretch of the imagination. The plot does not suffer from the constraints of logical plausibility, nor does it appear to have given the screen-writers and story consultants much of a headache in terms of plotting or continuity as there clearly wasn't much effort put into it. I left the theatre more perplexed than I was when the movie began, never a pleasant way to leave a film experience.

I suppose I was most disappointed by the fact that it could have been a Good Dumb Movie, along the lines of the first two ""Mummy"" films, but fails spectacularly. The potential ramifications of being thrust into superhero-dom are not explored at all, nor are the complicated relationships that would inevitably arise from their situations. The only time the film really touches on this is when Ben Grimm/The Thing is unceremoniously (and embarassingly publicly) dumped by his wife because she cannot stand what he has become, but even this problem is handily dispatched by giving him a blind girlfriend. The potentially destructive powers of these people are never examined - the Human Torch can burn at supernova temperatures, which would destroy the earth, we are told, but it is all done rather flippantly, as though the thought of someone as irresponsible as Johnny Storm having the power to incinerate our planet wasn't something extraordinary and dangerous.

Even the roles that these characters would play in saving the world from disaster are not really defined, though their powers are explained and demonstrated at length. For instance, in the Four's first outing, the Human Torch (my, this naming thing gets repetitive) saves a girl from a fiery explosion by setting himself ablaze and holding her tightly to form a shield around her...but since he can burn at supernova temperatures and is ON FIRE while he's holding her, I cannot see where this wouldn't have been just as deadly to the poor little girl. Wreaking havoc on innocent bystanders is hardly a good thing for superheroes to do, yet the rescues by the Four are usually required by their own incompetence. Inconsistencies like this are everywhere, pointing to a sloppy storytelling job that is simply inexcusable.

Ultimately, if you've already seen ""Batman Begins,"" ""War of the Worlds,"" ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" and, well, everything else playing at your local multiplex, ""Fantastic Four"" isn't a completely horrid way to spend $6. There are a few good laughs and, as utter popcorn movies go, it's not the dumbest I've ever seen. If you have no other option and desperately really need to see something one lazy summer afternoon, this will do.

So, he becomes mor and more intent to end all of the Fantastic Four's lives. at first, The Fantastic Four don't gel together. There is a constant grudge match between The Thing and Johnny.

This film was seriously mediocre. They could've found a better director than Tim Story. He directed Taxi, for god's sake. Also, this film had the cheesiness of a B movie, and some of the effects were horrid. They did stay faithful to the comic books but I felt that some parts were skewered by Tim Story and the writers.

I recommend this movie if you can handle cheesiness or semi-cool effects. I don't recommend this to any fans because I feel that they will be angry at what has been done, and I was sure angry too. So, see if this film if you can handle it.",1121472000,,2160,4.521739130434782
1555092,3,B00005JNTU,"Fantastic Four begins with five brillant scientists embarking into outer space to study the properties of DNA in the midst of an inter-galatic storm. Unfortunately, miscalculations cause the crew to be exposed to the storm.  When they arrive back on Earth, they soon discover that the storm has altered their DNA and given them super powers.  Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) is able to stretch his body into over-extension, Susan Storm (Invisible Woman) can become invisible, Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) can lite himself on fire, and Ben Grimm's (The Thing) skin has been replaced with a layer of orange brick.  Together, the group forms the fantastic four.  The fifth member of the shuttle crew is Victor von Doom, the benefactor of the mission.  He also is discovering that he acquired powers of his own and is not too happy that the failure of the mission caused the end of his career.  Dr. Doom wants retribution.

As promising as I thought this movie would be, I wasn't really too impressed with the plot.  One personal grudge was that many aspects of the plot were explained by mentioning DNA.  I work with DNA and don't see any reason why anyone would need to study it in space or why it would give people superpowers, but that is besides the point.  The point is that too much of the movie was spent on the origin of the group--much of which was contrary to the comic--and there was little other storyline or big action scences.  Reed Richards treats their superpowers like a ""disease"" and builds a machine to try to ""cure"" them, but I thought this was kind of stupid.  It was a little interesting that Ben Grimm had an ""existential"" dilema with being The Thing, but mainly I thought that the movie needed more villianous plots created by Dr. Doom and foiled by the Fantastic Four, rather than a single, simple battle scene at the end of the movie.

Besides the plot, I thought that the casting for the movie was pretty good.  Ioan Gruddle (spelling?) looked and acted just like Mr. Fantastic would be expected to.  Michael Chucklis was the best choice for the role of The Thing because he has a perfect stature for it.  Chris Evans did a good job of capturing the hubris of The Human Torch.  I originally thought that Jessica Alba was a little of a dark horse for the role of the blond, debutante Invisible Women but I have to give her credit because she pulled it off.  I think that the actor that played Dr. Doom was good for the role too, but I did not like what the movie did with the character.  Instead of being a man in a mask and a costume like in the comic, the movie made it out to be that his skin was actually made of metal, which was dumb.  It made him seem like the T9000 from Terminator 2 or Iron Man from the Black Sabbath song (not the Iron Man from the Marvel comic book).  And if he was supposed to be from Latvaria, why didn't he have a sinister accent?  That would have been great.

Overall, the movie wasn't bad for an action movie, but too scarce on plot to be too engaging.  In terms of other Marvel Comics movies, it isn't as good as the Spiderman movies, but much better than The Hulk.  Basically, it is about the quality of the X-Man movies.  It is enjoyable enough, but didn't have the direction or depth that I was hoping for.",1121385600,3,3265,4.445378151260504
1555093,5,B00005JNTU,"I liked the old Fantastic Four cartoons and I went to see this movie pretty much as homage to that.  The previews that I saw were not all that impressive but I figured that hey, it's the Fantastic 4, go see it.  But I was more than pleasantly suurprised.  I was blown away.

This movie was great in that it did not appear to take itself so serious that they thought they were really saving the world.  Actually, in this movie, they were pretty much just saving themselves.

They did not act as though world peace or the cure for cancer hinged on them.  They wre just regular folks caught up in a meteor storm who developed special powers.  They still acted like regular people and the movie showed them coming to terms with the changes. They did not just go from nobody to superhero overnight.

It was funny and entertaining and the actors were believeable in the roles or rather as believeable as can be playing comic book characters.  The story line did not make me roll my eyes repeatedly (although I did some).  One complaint-  I thought the backstory was a little skimpy; second, the movie should have stuck to the comics' reason of why Victor had animosity toward Reed rather than making a love triangle the issue;  third,  the scenes regarding the mission were skimpy.  It is a good thing that I knew enough of the story myself to fill in the blanks.  But overall, the movie was well written and the facts here were pretty close to those in the comics and cartoons with some exceptions that did not take away from the movie (unless you are a picky comics fan).

I was not that crazy about the guy who played Reed because he was a little wimpy but Jessica Alba made an awesome Sue.  And the guy who played Johnny was fabulous.  He played Johnny as a risk taking rebel rather than the ""good boy"" he was on the cartoon.  I also liked Michael Chiklis as the Thing.  He was as great here as he is on the Shield.  One complaint though-- he and Reed were supposed to have gone to school together.  Michael Chiklis as Ben is clearly alot older than the guy who played Reed.  Also, in the movie they mentioned that all of them had attended MIT.  Ben Grimm as played here was clearly Reed's enforcer and was definitely not a rocket scientist.  This made me ask ""Since when did MIT get a football team?""

I am giving this movie 5 stars even with the flaws I mentioned because it was well worth the money I spent to see it and the time flew by as I enjoyed the show.  I went to be entertained.  I was entertained beyond my expectations.

1555094,4,B00005JNTU,"Hollywood has done a good job with lone superheroes, delving into their romantic problems and questions about justice, civic duty, and identity (like we've seen in Spider-man 2 and the new Batman).  A movie about a superhero TEAM is a different animal.  It's an ensemble film.  Recently the X-men films have gone into that territory, and now we have the Fantastic Four.
  Fantastic Four is more successful than the X-men films because the characters are more fun.  Particularly, the characters of the Human Torch, The Invisible Woman, and The Thing.
  The Torch, or Johnny Storm, defies the rule that superheroes have to see their powers as a curse.  The Torch WANTS media attention.  He's living out his rock-star dreams of fame and picking up girls.  The other three heroes cringe at his comments to the press, but he knows how to joke with the public and enjoy his newfound hero status.  You go, Torch.
  The Invisible Woman, Sue Storm, wants Mr. Fantastic, Reed Richards, to just be assertive and commit to her, be a man of action.  I laugh when she calls him a dork early in the film.  He IS a dork because what man in his right mind would let Jessica Alba (Sue Storm) get away when she's clearly waiting for him to wake up and just say he still likes her?
 The Thing, Ben Grim, is the tragic figure of the group.  He's transformed into a monster while his friends can turn their powers on and off at will.  His girlfriend rejects him when she sees the new Ben Grim.  But even his situation is played for laughs somewhat.  He trades quips with the Human Torch and crumbles Torch's sports car into a big metal beach ball to get even at one point.  He causes a major accident when trying to talk a suicide from jumping from a bridge.  That scene, where the Fantastic Four accidentally goes public with their powers, is where the movie starts to get good.
  The other two characters, Mr. Fantastic and Dr. Doom, were less interesting to me.  Mr. Fantastic, Reed Richards, is a thirty-(almost forty?)-something science nerd who still can't talk to girls without talking of therems and astronomy.  Doom is the stereotypical corporate millionare only interested in power (and in marrying Sue Storm).
  This movie isn't campy but it doesn't take itself too seriously either, another way it proves itself better than X-men.  If it sacrifices something by being an ensemble film instead of following one hero, it's of little concern.  It might even be seen as a nice change of pace from the loner heroes (Spider-man and Batman).  It was fun for me and will please anyone who can appreciate a good superhero fantasy.",1121385600,5,2611,4.670329670329671

Reed's motives are the good of humanity, Victor's are profit, and he already has squeezed out 75% of the proceeds for himself.  They are supposed to be protected by the space station, but when things goe wrong, they are all exposed to the radiation.  Their DNA is significantly altered, and they soon find themselves with super powers.

Reed, Mr. Fantastic, becomes elastic.  Sue, the Invisible Woman, can turn invisible and manipulate force fields.  Ben, the Thing, becomes rock-like with immense strength.  Johnny, the Human Torch, can ignite himself at will and even fly.  Victor, Dr. Doom, goes to the dark side with his ability to manipulate electricity and his development of a metal skin.  They must all deal with this adjustment, contemplate changing themselves back, and facing off against each other four vs. one.

The greatest weakness of ""FF"" is that it is an origin story.  Most viewers will want to see some action right away.  Die hard fans of the comic will be dismayed at the alteration of Dr. Doom's origins.  In fact, the origin IS the story, culminating in the big battle to end the film.

While no where as good as ""Batman Begins"" or ""Spider-Man 2"", ""FF"" carves out its own niche in the superhero movie world.  True to the comics, the story is mostly lighter in tone with the inter-character humor that fans will expect.  It is an enjoyable popcorn film that does not strive to be more than it is.

Acting wise, the cast is pretty good.  Michael Chiklis steals every scene as Ben, weather he is human looking or rocky looking.  He also provides the most moving of stories.  After all, his world is turned upside down by his transformation, and not in a good way.  Ioan Gruffudd is capable as the somewhat boring Reed Richards.  And Chris Evans is perfect as the wisecracking Johnny Storm.  The interaction between Ben and Johnny is priceless at times, and is very true to the source material.

""FF"" is a thoroughly entertaining movie that can be seen by the whole family, and can be enjoyed by all.  That is more than can be said for most of the other movies out there right now, and that works greatly in its favor.  Hopefully, with this origin story out of the way, any sequels can dive right into the action that many viewers crave.

1555096,3,B00005JNTU,"Though, originally, I wasn't a terribly large fan of the Fantastic Four, as the film's release grew more eminent, I began to follow the production, and even became rather big fan of the characters themselves. So when the film was finally release, I not only had a fair knowledge of the film, and the characters that would inhabit it, I also had quite a high level of excitement for the film. My expectations however, were low. Since I followed the film, I pretty much already knew all of its strength, and all of its flaws. Sadly, upon viewing the film, I was proven correct in my assessment, and expectation.

First let me start with the things, or aptly, the thing I didn't like about the movie; the direction. It is, to put it kindly, dreadful. Going into the production, I had mixed feelings out Story. While his former film, Taxi was quite horrible, Barbershop was an excellent film, and I had at least some hope that he could do something special with FF. And I suppose, he did do that, in regards to characterization (apparently the reason why Fox chose to hire him). But any accomplishments Story makes in that department are easily overshadowed by his disappointments in nearly every other area of direction. Despite a 100 million-plus dollar budget, the film looks downright cheap. ""Sitcom-like"" to quote several fans explanation of it. It's poorly shot as well, I found myself disappointed time and time again with Story's shot selection, pacing, and various other little particulars in many moments, and multiple scenes. Story just seems to fail overall in bringing the story to the screen. You could blame poor editing (and FF IS poorly edited), but it's more than just that; everything feels just a bit off, just a bit...wrong. And it's the director's job to fix that. I hate to pretend I'm some grade-school teacher and hand out a report card for Story's effort, but I can't help but say, if I were to grade it, Story would barely manage a D. Extremely disappointing.

Now moving on to the things that weren't...quite so bad. The story for one. It's not the best in the world. You've got plenty of improbable happenings, corny dialogue, and rather loose plot, it still watchable and enjoyable. Our heroes, at least, are all done quite well, and act, pretty much, like they do in the comics. Brainiac Reed, Motherly Sue, Gentle Ben, and Jerk Off Johnny are all there (some more than others), and the tone and comradery between them is much like the comics. And that's really semblance of ""specialness"" comes from. The humor in the script is also done well, and would definitely be the bright spot for people whom are not familiar with the comic origins of the characters.

That brings us to Doom. Much like the villains from the Burton Batman movies, Doom is yet another comic book movie character drastically altered from its source. Say what you will about that debatable practice, but I usually don't mind it, if its done well. In any case, instead of being a magic-welding foreign ruler, Doom, or Von Doom as he is called before his mutation to villain, is now the egotistical head of a multi-billion dollar company. I must admit, this style character is a real favorite of mine, but, sadly, its done poorly. Doom suffers both from a lack of screen time, and a lacking of understanding of the character. Doom is never really fleshed out. We never really know why he ticks. We never really seen his egotistical psychopathy. Thusly this declines the quality and meaning of Doom's ""evil plot"" and final showdown with the 4.

I wouldn't quite say, overall, the acting is good or great, but rather everyone embodies their character well, and brings them to life quite perfectly (if given the opportunity). Nothing is extremely memorable, Chris Even's portrayal as Johnny may leave quite an indentation, Michael Chiklis as The Thing is heartfelt, and Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba and Julian McMahon all make due with what they're given. Though this may not sound like a glowing endorsement of the cast, they deliver just about as much as I'd think possible, given their either none-existent, or highly television-based resumes.

There's been several complaints, both from critic and fan alike, that the special effects in the film were disappointed. I honestly, didn't notice this at all. While FF certainly doesn't introduce anything revolutionary into film in terms of CGI, it's solid, and any fake-looking effect it might have is more derived from the nature of the characters and actions rather than the effects themselves. It's harder than you think to make a guy with a 25 foot arm look real.

The one last flaw of the film would have to be the extremely large amount of footage cut from the film. While this isn't apparent to people who didn't follow the production, the poor pacing the hack-kneed editing creates IS a apparent, and is damaging. I can only hope, like Daredevil before it, a Director's Cut of FF will be commissioned in the coming months.

Overall, FF is hardly more than an ""okay"" movie, but's a fun ""okay"" movie, and that more than worth the hour and a half of your time. However, at the end of the day, I can't help but wonder just how enjoyable, just how fun this script would have been if it were placed in more capable hands. It may sound crazy, but I could almost imagine Spider-Man-level quality from this if Chris Colombus or some other talented family-oriented director was given the reigns.

It was funny, action-packed, and had something i was surprised to see... wit. I loved the chemistry between Johnny storm and Ben Grimm( aka the Thing), and even Jessica Alba, as the invisible girl, was good. Im not sure why this movie has been recieving bad comments and reviews, because from what i saw, it was just good, clean fun. I'm sick of people thinking they're critics, and poking at every bad thing in the film and putting it down. Sure, the acting was a bit rigid at times, some odd moments that didn;t seem to fit with the movie, and the plot too basic, but why cant people loosen up and just enjoy it? It's not going to win any awards, make the ""top 100 movies of the century"" list, or win the hearts of critics, but its going to entertain you for two hours. I also happened to see Batman Begins a while back and, while FF was exciting and fulfilled me,Batman did not. FF is what a summer super hero movie should be: outrageous and visually impressive action, and cool characters. Batman Begins was to dark and the fighting was shot two inches away from the action, giving you scenes where you have no idea what is goin on. there were no moments where you say ""wow, how did they do that,"" and all super hero movies should have those kind of scenes. Theres no scale, or visually impressive scenes, just blurs of action. I know that Batman is a darker character, and that the movie should be dark, but when it takes the fun out of it, theres no fulfillment.i think that Nolan(who is a fine director), was trying to make the movie more realistic, which is good, but people don't go to super hero movies to see whats real, they go to see the unreal. They want to see stuff not possible by ordinary humans, stuff that exhilerates them, entertains them. And i don't think Batman does that. You come out of the theater with slight dissapointment. But don't get me wrong, Batman Begins is a good movie, just not an impressive, exciting movie that i thought i would see. Anyway Fantastic Four may not be a perfect movie, but its fun and entertaining, which is what those type of movies should be.",1121299200,3,2208,4.400977995110025

1555197,4,B00005JNTU,"As a comic book fan, the Fantastic Four have never been at the top of my list. I'm not sure why, in the world of Marvel comics they're one of the top super-hero groups. When Spider-Man developed his powers, the Fantastic Four was one of the first teams he sought out. When something goes wrong, the intellect of Mr. Fantastic can be guaranteed to help, which means a lot of super-heroes turn to the FF for help. Heck, they've saved the Earth numerous times against threats from outer space and other dimensions. Yet something about the team just never connected with me. I enjoyed reading summaries of their adventures, or seeing them appear in other titles, but super-hero teams have never been my forte, always preferring the lone hero types. Because of that, the idea of a Fantastic Four movie didn't really excite me, and as the trailers poured in, my lack of excitement never grew, since what I saw looked pretty horrible compared to what I did know about the team.

Fantastic Four is not a bad movie, but it is a film likely to alienate the fan base of the comic book on which it is based. In a way, maybe that's worse than sucking. After all, the creator of the Fantastic Four, Stan Lee, always called Marvel Comic fans ""true believers"". What kind of a movie do you have when true believers refuse to believe?",1121212800,2,1316,4.529411764705882

It turns out that they pretty much used the best parts of the film to be the trailer. I didn't find it to be as entertaining as other recent comic book movies like Batman Begins or Sin City, and the characters are rather weak. Michael Chiklis' The Thing is pretty outstanding, but his super power is not very striking. The telekinetic power used by Jessica Biel(Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman) is somewhat of a copycat to Famke Janssen's role in X-Men. Couldn't they get someone as famous and sexy as Ryan Reynolds to play Johnny Storm/The Human Torch instead of Chris Evans. Ioan Gruffudd's role as Mr. Fantastic is my least favorite, and the romantic subplot involving Sue Storm and him was bland and irrelevant to the movie. As for the villian Victor Von Doom played by Julian McMahon was hardly evil enough, and he had too little action to tackle. The spcial effects were pretty good, and the final showdown was impressive. This film suffers from poor story, not enough fantastic battles, and star power.",1121212800,3,1144,4.7537688442211055

What this movie needs is a shot of adrenaline. When the action kicks in towards the end it goes somewhere but the corny stuff in the middle we don't need. Michael Chiklis gives an unimpressive performance, Ioan Gruffudd is so-so, Jessica Alba was too weak and Chris Evans was too over the top in his performance but he did have his moments. Only Julian McMahon as Von Doom was the highlight because McMahon can play a sinister bastard pretty darn good. Some of the dialouge, basically one liners from the 4 are really stupid.

1555200,4,B00005JNTU,I saw Fantastic Four this weekend and I thought it was much better than what some reviewers and critics made it out to be. If your looking for a movie as as good as Spider-Man or even Batman Begins then you will probably not like this movie. Now if your looking for a movie with action and a sense of humor (think Blade Trinity/Ryan Reynolds) then you will probably enjoy the Fantastic Four. Chris Evans who plays Johnny Storm brings some great laughs to this movie. The movie was entertaining and did far better than what anyone expected it to do by being the #1 movie in America opening with 56 million dollars and finally ending a 19 week slump in Hollywood. Fantastic Four is not a great movie but for any marvel comic book fan this is one worth watching.,1121040000,6,759,4.390070921985815
1555201,2,B00005JNTU,"When you raise the bar really high, future examples in the genre have to meet or exceed that standard to become memorable. Hitchcock raised the bar so high, even he had trouble meeting the public's expectations of his films late in his career. With the phenomenal success of ""Spiderman 2"" and ""X-2"", and the critical success of ""Batman Begins"", we now realize what a `superhero' film can be. They can be dark, filled with believable characters, have interesting and intelligent stories. They can be excellent examples of filmmaking.

""Fantastic Four"" isn't any of these things. It has some fun moments, but overall, why bother? There are far better examples out there.

Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis, TV's ""The Shield"") visit Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon, TV's ""Nip/ Tuck"") at his headquarters. This is a last ditch effort for Reed and Ben to get the funding they need for their studies. Von Doom agrees to let them travel to his space station provided they take Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), Von Doom's current and Richard's ex-girlfriend with them. Susan announces that her brother, Johnny (Chris Evans, ""Cellular"") will be the captain, to the chagrin of Ben, his former Air Force commander. Faster than you can say ""space station"", the five of them arrive. (Yes, Victor has traveled along as well). Almost immediately, the solar storm they traveled to study hits the space stations, zapping them all with it's radioactive waves. Upon their return to Earth, they realize their bodies are changing; Richards, Mr. Fantastic, can stretch his body into any shape, Susan, Invisble Woman, can become invisible at will, Johnny, the Human Torch, can set his body on fire and Ben's, The Thing, body becomes solid stone and he gains incredible strength. Thus, the Fantastic Four are born.

""Four"", directed by Tim Story (""Barbershop"", ""Taxi"") has the same tongue-in-cheek attitude that used to be the standard for superhero films. Johnny becomes a publicity hound after they perform their first heroic act as a group. A fireman tells them ""You better get out there and talk to the reporters."" He then asks ""Who's the leader here?"" Johnny responds ""I am"". Fireman: ""No, really."" and he looks at Richards. Think ""Superman"", but not as good. It isn't as good, because nothing is taken very seriously in this film. And there are huge plot holes.

Because the serious side of the story is so light, the film is unbalanced. The filmmakers almost seem unconcerned with exposition. One minute, the five of them... First of all, why would Von Doom, the head of a major corporation travel to the space station with them? I don't know. Not explained. As the five of them arrive at the station, the solar storm hits and they seem to be in great danger. Then they are waking up, on Earth, under observation, at Von Doom's facility. How did they end up back on Earth? No explanation is sought or even attempted by anyone. Later, Reed admits that he doesn't understand why the storm affected them, yet he is able to make a machine to counteract the effects. Still later, Ben climbs into the machine, alone, and manages to operate it, when the controls are outside. Because of these holes in the logic and story, the film fails to entirely create a believable universe.

There are also many recent examples of using special effects to enhance the story (""Batman Begins"" and ""War Of The Worlds""). ""Four"" has an inherent problem. Three of the four characters could only be created by special effects, and the effects are kind of cheesy. There is simply no other way to show someone stretching their limbs underneath a door, or becoming invisible, or setting themselves on fire. In the case of the Human Torch, the character is completely animated as Chris Evan's features are transformed into flames. These effects are never entirely believable.

""Fantastic Four"" is simply an exercise in bringing a comic book to life. Unfortunately, it never transcends above this. It never makes the film worthy of paying full price at a theater. Or even a bargain matinee.",1121040000,6,4065,4.901162790697675
1555202,3,B00005JNTU,"At one point during FANTASTIC FOUR, Johnny Storm (aka The Human Torch) settles down in front of the TV while popping a pan of Jiffy Pop popcorn in one hand.  In many ways, this one moment sums up this film adaptation of the Marvel comic book...telling the audience that it is meant to be a simple popcorn flick and we might as well enjoy the ride.  Despite a couple rather questionable plot holes and uneven acting from its leads, the film for the most part succeeds in its rather unambitious mission.

The film tells the story of how, with the help of the egotistical tycoon Victor Von Doom, scientist Reed Richards undergoes a mission of studying the effects of a cosmic storm cloud using one of Doom's space stations.  Along for the ride are pilot buddy Ben Grimm, lovely genetics expert Sue Storm (who is Doom's girlfriend and Reed's ex), and her hotshot brother Johnny.  Needless to say, in true comic book fashion, the storm overwhelms the space station and bathes all five passengers with radiation.  When they return to Earth, all five gain superhuman powers; one will become the villainous Dr. Doom, with the rest becoming the film's title super team.

Directed by Tim Story, the film moves at good clip, and while there's not much in the ""slam-bang brawl"" or character development categories, it more than makes up for it in charming bits of humor especially with the fun by-play between Chris Evans' Johnny Storm/Human Torch and Michael Chiklis' grouchy Ben Grimm, who turns into the rocklike Thing.  Evans clearly is having a blast up there on the screen, while Chiklis does some solid work in portraying Grimm's frustration. Both actors make the most of their roles and easily are the standouts here.  Ioan Gruffudd is saddled with the thankless role of the rubbery Reed Richards (aka Mr. Fantastic).  The character is pretty dry personality-wise, but Gruffudd does what he can.  The lovely Jessica Alba is no more believable as a genetic scientist than I am, but as ""Invisible Woman"" Sue Storm, she turns in a fair performance for the most part.  Julian McMahon's Dr. Doom doesn't get to do a whole lot but smirk and threaten a lot before appearing in the all-too-brief final battle.

If the movie suffers from anything, it comes from the inevitable comparisons that it got next to such recently character-driven and critically acclaimed super hero films like BATMAN BEGINS, X-2, and SPIDER-MAN 2.  In the end, FANTASTIC FOUR is a charming film that might disappoint super hero fans who are looking for something deeper or heartfelt in their films.  But, if you're looking for a nice couple hours to waste....I would recommend that you be like the Human Torch; pop some popcorn and just enjoy the show.",1121040000,5,2716,4.810752688172043
1555203,2,B00005JNTU,"Fantastic Four was supposed to be the hottest movie of the summer,but doesn't a movie have to be good in order to qualify for that? With plenty better movies out this one has no chance. First of all, this movie doesn't even feel like a superhero movie. There's one fight scene in the whole movie! These are supposed to be superheroes. However, movies like Spiderman have proven that you don't need non-stop action to be a good superhero movie. Well, the non-action parts of this movie (99% of it) weren't that great either. A plot is non-existent besides studying a storm, the acting is not convincing, only a couple of the lines that were supposed to be funny are funny, and the characters themselves are boring. The Fantastic Four are not happy with what has happened to them, besides Johnny Storm, and spend most of the movie complaining and blaming each other for it while half-heartedly trying to undo the ""symptoms of their disease."" Johnny Storm spends his time trying to get girls and showing off, but also happens to be the deepest character in the movie. Sorry, but that's just sad. His bickering with The Thing is probably the best part about the movie. Incidentally, without him i would give this movie an F. Dr. Doom is a great villian. His plans go as far as killing the Fantastic Four without ever knowing why. The Fantastic Four themselves become celebreties and there is always a crowd following them outside which ruins the movie. The only fight scene of the movie is poorly done and happens to have minimum contact. I believe the only physical damage was The Thing's punch. Mr. Fantastic and Sue Storm needlessly flirt throughout the movie and everything else seems to be borrowed from Spiderman. The buildings look eerily familiar and I swear I've heard a bad guy get kicked out of his company by the council somewhere else...

Oh, and for all those that criticized Jessica Alba's performance, you suck. Anyone that plays a superhero that needs to take her clothes off to be invisible deserves credit...

Gruffudd was good at pulling off an American accent and would make a great James Bond. Evans was good, but I would've preffered a gentler portrayal of the irascible fellow (more tender to his sister-not in THAT way, though). Chiklis was very convincing.

First off,I loathed the 1994 Roger Corman adaptation which was so bad that it never even made it straight to video. (But the Punisher and Captain  America did?!?) This recent take on the Ff was much better with four completley different personas and dilemnas,most notably the tragic Ben Grimm portrayed by Shiled's Micheal Chicklis who struggles to adapt to his life post transformation,while hoping for a cure.
On the other hand, Chris Evans was on point as the Cocky hot headed Johnny Storm who more than accepts his abilities and superpowers while trying to achieve instant stardom.
I didn't particularly care for Ian Grofford's Reed Richards, in the comics Reed was a little more stoic while still retaining that super intellect. Instead we have an insecure egghead who relied on Victor Von Doom's financing for this cosmic exploration project.

Jessica Alba wasn't as bad as many have seem to think, her performance was OK, nothing more. Now this new Dr. Doom comes off a bit like some arrogant enterpenuer like Donald Trump, hence the cheesy line; :Sue, your'e fired""! It's a good flick which couldv'e been a lil' better.to compare it to other comic flicks like X2 or Spiderman 2 would be very unfair. the FF stood on it's own merit and the comedy relief worked well for what it was.

Pros:
""Convincing"" movie counterparts accompanied by fun performances courtesy of Chiklis and Evans,who IMO carried the movie.
Decent FX especially the Human Torch that pays homage to Kirby's comic counterpart. The Thing makeup wasn't as bad as i thought either there was no need for CGI copouts as Chiklis mananged to portray Ben Grimm pefectly.
The posthumous Jack Kirby finally gets acknowledged!!(see the Movie's ending credits)
Funny dialogue(When asked if Mr. Fantrastic can stretch any part of his anatomy,Johnny replies; ""i wouldn't know, but i think he may be limp"") and good direction.well Timmy, you didn't really let me down as i have thought.

Cons: Dr. Doom's powers and looks..Is he  Electro or even the silver surfer's distant cousin?!?
Not enough battle scenes during the movie, where's Doom's security force or even his robots?
predictible ending..does this mean an upcoming sequel?
Maybe so, because as of this writting, The Fantastic Four has helped to recover the Box Office slump with a $53 Million take. Note to Hollywood: stop the chessy remakes like bewitched and the
silly  Dukes of Hazzard.instead Make yours Marvel!

So, enjoy the Thing stopping an 18-wheeler, the Human Torch taking a guided missile on a race across the city, Jessica Alba in modest underwear, and a geeky Reed Richards slipping his hand under a door.

The film starts with the origin of the four, which moves a little slowly to begin with, but picks up the action as the film progresses.  Once the foursome begin to realize what their powers are, as well as the villain, Dr. Doom, coming to terms with his own powers, the fight between good and evil kicks into gear.

Ioan Gruffold does a nice job as Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), a scientist who has a better relationship with numbers and his science than with the woman he truely loves, Sue Storm (Invisible Girl).  Sue's cocky brother (Human Torch) and friend Ben Grimm (The Thing) provide a lot of the comic relief for the film.  Of the four, the Human Torch and the Thing seemed to be the best developed.  Hopefully we will see more character development for Reed and Sue in the inevitable sequel.

The special effects were really good, especially the Human Torch.  I was afraid the Torch's look, as well as that of Mr. Fantastic's stretchy skin wouldn't translate well to the big screen.  This film, however, made it look good.  Michael Chiklis is probably the standout of the four, becoming the monsterous looking Thing, dealing with his new appearance and the amazing strength he has acquired.

Probably the weakest link in the film is Dr. Doom played by Julian McMahon of television's Nip/Tuck.  Once he became Dr. Doom, it would have been nice to have heard a darker, more sinister voice coming from the mask.  Overall, though, I think he did a fair job.  I hope they make him even darker in the next film, should he return as the villain

As with any hero story, the first film deals with the origin of its hero or heroes.  With the sequel, the director can start out with action without taking out time to explain the beginnings of the character.  With a little fine tuning, the Fantastic Four will become a very good film franchise for Marvel Comics like Spiderman and X-Men.

Not quite as good as Spiderman - I think the emotional intensity & character sympathy is a bit diluted from spreading it out among more characters - but it gives the X-Men a run for their money.  Batman Begins is somewhat more serious, maybe a better movie in some serious ways, but Fantastic Four is, overall, probably the most fun movie out currently.  They give the origin so you can understand and enjoy the film just as well if you've never read the comic.  The Four are exposed to DNA altering radiation in space, and each exhibits different symptoms manifested as superpowers.  Ben, The Thing, is super strong and tough, appearing as though he's made of rock.  Johnny (Torch) can start fire at will and turn himself into a blazing, flying fireball.

1555310,5,B00005JNTU,"""Fantastic Four"" is great! Tim Story's directing is excellent. The cast led by Ioan Gruffudd is excellent and Julian McMahon gives an devilishly great performance as Victor Von Doom. The screenplay by Michael France & Mark Frost, which is based on the comic book by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, is excellent. The music by John Ottman is excellent. The cinematography by Oliver Wood is excellent. The film editing by William Hoy is great. The casting by Nancy Klopper is great. The production design by Bill Boes is excellent. The art direction by Shepherd Frankel & Don Macaulay is excellent. The set decoration by Elizabeth Wilcox is excellent. The costume design by Jose Fernandez & Wendy Partridge is excellent.

1555311,4,B00005JNTU,"This movie has been compared unfavorably to Spiderman and Batman, especially Spiderman.  This is like comparing apples to oranges.  Spiderman is about an orphaned college geek bit by a radioactive spider with no support structure to help him understand his gift.  Through carelessness, his uncle dies and his becomes a lonely calling, filled with angst.  His heroism comes out of anguish and a big heart.

The Fantastic Four story, as created by Stan Lee, is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT kind of superhero story.  It is about a world class scientist/astronaut, his scientist girlfriend/wife, a hot-shot Top-Gun fighter pilot, and another astronaut.  They are all adults; 3 of them are even mature adults.  There is no childhood trauma.  They aren't anonymous loners with no established reputations having to work hard to earn the public's respect.  They gained their powers by accident to be sure, but they weren't dreaming about Mary Jane at a science museum.  They were putting their lives on the line for humanity.

I think the 4 characters were very faithfully played in the movie.  The interplay between Ben and Johnny was very well done.  I don't recall the comic having a back story on how Dr. Doom came to be, but I liked the way the movie did it.  The origin stories in the comics were not all that detailed, but I think it is entirely appropriate to expand on them for a first movie.  The one thing this movie has in common with the first Spiderman movie is the ability to give a decent origin story and yet also give us a very enjoyable adventure conflict.  In both cases, it happens because the villain is also part of the origin story.

I certainly hope they make more FF movies, but that'll depend on how well it does at the box office.",1120953600,3,1744,4.6996699669967

1555397,5,B00005JNTU,"I've seen plenty of comic book flicks, and I'm not just talking about the recent ones like the Spiderman films and the latest ""Batman Begins.""  I've seen all of the old Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" flicks, the Adam West ""Batman"" movies, and even some duds like the Dolph Lundgren version of ""The Punisher"" and both ""Swamp Thing"" films.  Hopefully that establishes my credit on reviewing ""Fantastic Four"" and giving it such a high rating.

The story is, much like all comic first films in what will inevitably be at least followed by one sequel, an origin story.  Tim Story(Barbershop) handles the direction quite well.  Much like in ""Barbershop,"" Story develops the background of each character with depth and simplicity at the same time.  His comic-timing, especially with Human Torch and Thing, is perfect.  That duo alone is worth watching together.  I read in an issue of ""Starlog"" that Story was a little nervous about the special effects in this film because he wasn't used to using them.  He was told not to worry about the effects, that would be handled by Kurt Williams and his team of pros.  That fact comes through in this film, because the characters are developed perfectly and the special effects, while brilliant, honestly take a step back from the story.  This film is perhaps more character driven than any other comic flick out there.  You really get a sense of family between the characters on the screen.

All of the actors captured the wonder of each of the heroes(or villain) that they portrayed.  Michael Chiklis might be running around in an orange rock suit for the majority of this film, but you can honestly see how big Thing's heart really is.  He could have smashed anything in his path, but instead, we learn he cares more for others than himself.  His struggle to become Ben Grimm again throughout the film is played out perfectly.  Jessica Alba does a wonderful job as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman.  Much like in the comic, she tries very hard to keep the boys from killing each other, all the while managing to blend into the background.  Thing might be made of rock, but Alba's character is the solid foundation for this group of characters.  Her brother, Johnny Storm/Human Torch, is the wild card in this bunch.  He embraces his newfound fame as a superhero, and reacts probably like any normal human being thrown into the situation would.  He loves his popularity, but he, much like Thing, cares deeply for the others in this family of heroes.  Chris Evans handles the role of Torch with youthful abandon, and it bleeds through the screen.  Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic is portrayed by Ioann Gruffudd.  I don't know much about this guy, other than that he was in the recent ""King Arthur.""  Other reviewers have said he was too geeky in this role, but guess what folks, Reed Richards is a geek.  Gruffudd has a flawless performance as the leader of the Fantastic Four.  He's goofy, a little bit too enveloped with his work, and even a little unsure of himself at times, but in the end, he really does know the answer to everything.  In other words, Richards is a little bit father-figure, a little bit big brother, and a lot of fun in a geeky, awkward sense of the word.  Julian McMahon plays Dr. Doom, and manages to do it with cold and calculated flair.  Unlike many other bad guys, Doom's voice remains the same before and after he dons his metal mask, which goes to show that this dude was evil even before he became a metal megalomaniac.

As stated before, the effects are brilliant.  They enhance the performances of the actors instead of draw your attention away from them.  There is some heavy CGI, but it rarely looks fake.  In fact, only Mr. Fantastic's stretching maneuvers seem to come across a little fake.  Chiklis' bodysuit blends in perfectly with the rest of the effects.  It allows him to show emotion that we weren't able to see in CGI creations like Hulk, and he wasn't fake-looking in his battle sequences like some of the other heroes from the page as of late.

Overall, this is actually a very good family film.  There is a little bit of language, but nothing you won't hear at the local Wal-Mart or in the mall.  There is one particularly violent scene involving Dr. Doom and someone who crosses him, but other than that, damage is rather minimal.  There's plenty of comedy, mostly provided by Thing and Human Torch, but Mr. Fantasic's awkwardness is also fun to watch.

If you want an excellent, action-packed, comedic, and, most importantly, plot-driven film, ""Fantastic Four"" is perfect.  It is well deserving of its five stars, and I hope you check it out.",1120953600,9,4616,4.7175

One of the hardest things to do in making this movie, it seems, was to develop the characters.  They are all so interelated b/c in the long run they are all family.  I've enjoyed other comic book movies in the past - especially Batman Begins, but within the genre its better to rate each movie on there own or with there sequel.  In the end FF is a family of super heroes trying to deal with their power in the general public, which is a refreshing change to having to worry about your identity being uncovered or someone discovering the batcave.

1555402,4,B00005JNTU,"It is amazing the level of sarcasm that has been generated among critics concerning Marvel's latest action hero movie Fantastic Four. Among the comments are ""more like mediocre"" or ""cheesy enough to clog one's arteries"". After seeing the movie, myself, I have to say that these annotations are childish, unfounded, and rather aloof.

Fantastic Four was a great movie that centered around a development storyline of the beloved Marvel Comics superheroes Mr. Fantastic, The Thing, The Invisible Woman, and The Human Torch, as well as that of the noted adversary Victor von Doom, aka Dr. Doom. There were those who might have been looking for more fighting scenes, but again, the characters were those who obtained powers that were by and large in their unprocessed stages.

I will not get into all the details about how those powers were gained from radiation exposure, because I feel that in terms of this vein of discourse, they are not necessary. What I think is important are the series of transitions that inflected the lives of the main players. As newfound abilities were acquired, so were additional, interpersonal dynamics that revolved around the characters. Among the conflicting subject matters throughout were individuality versus team reliability, beauty within versus beauty without, and impersonal logic versus passion.

Though the Fantastic Four is a superhero teamup, the movie script nicely picked apart the traits and personalities that separated one member from the other. A careful introspection makes the viewer realize that just as those individualities were strengthened, so was the need to combine them for the purpose of dealing with societal threats. In other words, for the audience to better know the Fantastic Four as a whole, they had to look at the sum of its important parts and beyond.

If a person contemplates the themes of the movie just at the surface level and does not explore what treasures might lie within, he or she, at best, might regard it as merely all-around fun, which I think is well-intended but amiss.

To seriously compare Fantastic Four with Batman Begins or Spider-Man in terms of intensity or excitability is really a futile waste of time. What does separate Fantastic Four from those other movies is not that the attainment of extraordinary powers can change a person's mode of existence but that four separate personalities, albeit egos, had to find ways to adjust and fuse together those attitudes and unique, advanced capabilities to form the right stuff known as The Fantastic Four.

Though there are negatives along with the positives that arise in virtually every situation, Fantastic Four, nonetheless, did manage to end on a good, high note. If there is an underlying message from this movie, it is that if people are not content with the constants in their lives, then there is always that glimmer of hope that meaningful change will occur so long as one wants it badly enough.",1120867200,129,2942,5.055670103092783
1555403,1,B00005JNTU,A complete mess of a film and I haven't the inclination to list out all of the things that makes this movie so bad. To begin with a good movie should be entertaining at the very least. This movie isn't entertaining and the acting was quite poor. On top of the poor acting the script was utter nonesense and the editing was not much better. This movie is a complete waste of money and I dare say watching it for free would be a complete waste of precious time. It is no wonder why Hollywood is losing money. Here is a hint-- It's because of uninspiring junk that directors think people will actually enjoy.  Skip this movie and read a book or something.  Ciao...,1120867200,4,661,4.32258064516129

I had doubts about her being cast as the Invisible woman but now that I seen this movie I was convinced she was good for the part of Susan Storm! Jessica Alba is both beatiful and talented in this movie! Chris Evans plays a very good Human Torch! The Human Torch is young hot head with powers of flames an fire!  The Thing played by Michael Chiklis was great too! The Thing had to struggle with the public media and the people accepting him as a orange rock monster.

1555405,5,B00005JNTU,This was extremely entertaining. We had a blast. It was funny and the action scenes were great. I wish they had more but since it did good at the box office we can see a second. Some of the effects were weak but I really don't care. It was a fun movie to spend a few hours at and you all should go see it.,1120867200,2,305,3.707692307692308
1555406,3,B00005JNTU,"While ""Four"" wasn't exactly ""Fantastic"" it was an entertaining diversion. I really wanted to like ""Fantastic Four"". I grew up reading the comic book as a kid and enjoyed Jack Kirby's unique artwork and Stan Lee's campy scripts. The film directed by Tim Story tries to recapture the essence of ""Fantastic Four"" and although it doesn't quite measure up to expectations, Story does a better job than I expected. Although ""Fantastic Four"" isn't a classic on the par of ""X-2"", ""Spider-Man 2"" or ""Batman Begins"", it doesn't pretend to be. ""Fantastic Four"" tries to recapture what made ""Spider-Man"" so successful with its mix of comedy, drama and superheroics. It's an enjoyable romp that is as disposable as ""Daredevil"" was. Avoiding the camp of truly bad comic book inspired movies like ""Batman & Robin"", ""Fantastic Four"" works best when the screen is given over to the conflict between Johnny Storm (""The Human Torch"") and Ben Grimm (""The Thing""). Their bickering recalls the formula that worked so well in the comics during their heyday.

When NASA turns down his proposal for an experiment in space scientist Reed Richards approachs classmate/ scientist/venture capitalist Victor Von Doom to finance it. Richards wants to go up to Doom's privately funded space station to test the effects of a cosmic storm on living plants. Richards believes that this cosmic storm may have contributed to life evolving on Earth and wants to see what properties the storm has on DNA. Unfortunately, things go wrong when the storm approaches the space station hours ahead of schedule exposing Richards, his friend astronatu Ben Grimm, pilot Johnny Storm, his sister Sue Storm and Von Doom to the effects of the storm.

The storm changes them all in ways they could never imagine: Richards becomes elastic able to stretch into any shape; Grimm literally is turned into a superhuman monster with huge rock like scales that protect him and with unnatural strength; Johnny can change into a pillar of fire that can fly; Sue has the ability to generate force fields and turn invisible. This motley crew of dynsfunctional bickering superheroes join forces to become the Fantastic Four. They must face Von Doom who has mutated a form of organic metal that's able to control electricity.

While the film quickly jumps right into the action, it does take a while for the plot to move along to the conflict between Dr. Doom and the Fantastic Four. Ioan Gruffudd's Richards needed to be better developed as a character and Jessica Biel just wasn't up to the task of playing the underwritten role of Sue Storm. Still, Story manages to come up with a number of strong set pieces making the film memorable if not an outright classic like ""Spider-Man"" or ""Batman Begins"". The humor of the film takes center stage quite often and it does work to the film's advantage. The best visual effects sequeneces are pretty much put on display in the trailer and the CGI seems a bit unfinished at times (such as some of Richards' stretching scenes much as the early CGI Spidey sequences weren't completely convincing in ""Spider-Man"" but there the script and performances were so good you could forgive the shortcomings of the visual effects)where the textures look far too cartoony to be completely convincing. The scenes with The Torch look much more convincing. It's evident that much was cut from the film and it appears choppy at times. If this had been released at the same time as ""Spider-Man"" (or shortly before), it would have been seen as a much more important movie. Following so closely in the wake of ""Batman Begins"" and Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"", ""Fantastic Four"" lacks the truly commanding scope or character development that were so critical to those films. The script credited to Mark Frost (co-creator/writer/producer of ""Twin Peaks"" and Michael France (writer on Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" and tepid ""The Punisher"") runs, pardon the pun, hot and cold. The casting seems dead on (with a few notable exceptions). Michael Chiklis, Chris Evans and Julian McMahon are perfectly cast (although without enough to do). Gruffudd seems right for the part but, again, character development would have helped his role a bit more.

If the film does well at the box office expect a sequel. The good news that, perhaps, they'll bring in a strong writer and perhaps deal with the Galactus/Silver Surfer story line that was so memorable in the 60's. Give the next film to someone with an edgier take on the story, focus on character development a bit more and have a narrative that has the slam-bang action approach of ""X-2"". One of the difficulties with a feature like this is the fact that there are so many characters that need screen time. It can be a challenge to balance that with the action.",1120867200,,4754,4.89454094292804
1555506,3,B00005JNTU,"At long last, I have found Bill Ross in the form of Ian Gruffudd who played Mr. Fantastic.  But he looked like the one I knew so long ago when he was Reed.  I wasn't able to discover what country made this awful mess as I left in the first 45 minutes.

There is a collision on the Brooklyn Bridge with spectacular feats, if you call freaks fantastic.  The fire truck hanging over the side was pretty fantastic, I do admit.  But not much else!

The NASA reject proposed an exploration of the solar system only to be rejected again.  The foursome went out in some kind of space vehicle and was caught in a radiation storm.  It was a freak of nature, and they in turn became freaks.  This seemed to be a remake of 'The Incredibles' but nothing about it was incredible.  Ben was The Thing, Victor turned into Dr. Doom and Susan was invisible sometimes and dressed in her underwear at times to the titillation of the Knoxville audience.  They do snicker and laugh at the oddest things here.

I fled the movie theater not because I was afraid, but because what I had seen so far was so awful I did not want to waste any more time cringing.  After all, I had Chuck Southcott to keep me company on the radio for five hours today.  He is much better than any freak show -- anytime.  He is simply fantastic!

Spider-man is one franchise the Fantastic Four is totally different. I believe that the story really plays to the strength of the comic series. The Fantstic Four has always been Marvel's dysfunctional family. This is portrayed very well in the film. Probably the thing that translated to the big screen the best was Johnny Storm. The acting of Chris Evans is spot-on. You really get the feeling that these characters actually exist. The emotions are true but it isn't too serious.

Going in to see this movie I was expecting the worst...like Batman & Robin bad....however I was pleasantly surprised. It's not Spider-man 2 great, but it is on par with the first X-men (i.e. movie could have been longer and the ending ""bigger"", but the potential for a superior sequel is there)

FF is definitely more lighter & comedic than other super-hero movies...and it should be. The FF has never been dark & brooding...it's always been about a slightly disfunctional family with super-powers.

The one issue I had with this film was the editing...the transistion from some scenes seems very choppy...i get the sense that a lot was left on the cutting room floor to quicken the pace of the movie. Hopefully, a extended cut DVD version will be offered with those scenes placed back and the movie should flow better.",1120867200,14,962,4.680473372781065
1555509,4,B00005JNTU,"First off, I am amused by all the people who try to dissect this film saying how thin the plot is, how cheesy the characters are, and how bad the special effects are.  Its based on a comic book people! Not to mention a comic that is over 40 years old!  I challenge anyone to read the '60s comics and say that they're NOT the cheesiest thing they've ever read.  This comic was as generic as generic can be.  Just look at the names of the characters: Mr. Fantastic, The Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, The Thing, Dr. Doom.  Not very creative.

Not very creative, but very fun. It captured the imagination of people back then and after 40 YEARS it has turned these characters into beloved icons.  That's where I think people are being unfair to this movie.  They're expecting all 40 years of character development into 1 hr. and 45 minutes worth of film.  It's a beginning, an origin. We see how these characters know each other, how they attain their powers, and how they choose to deal with them at a very early stage. Do we see the intensity of their relationships, the bonds that unite them so strongly? Not so much. But they've just come together.  They've just formed the team. They need time. Which is, again, what 40 years of comics give them that 1 movie can't.

I've always looked at The Fantastic Four as cheesy or goofy. From their names to their powers (Reed's stretching for example) to the situations they're put into. And yet, its still fun.  From The Thing and Torch's banter, Reed and Sue as husband and wife, and the overall family atmosphere between all four of them.

So to me, this film lives up to all of that. Unlike recent comic book films (Batman, Spider-man, X-men, Hulk), it doens't take itself too seriously. It reminds us that comic books are fun and so is this movie. I've heard people say that this film doesn't live up to the ""iconic"" characters that are The Fantastic Four.  Well, I say it took years for these characters to become ""iconic"" and that if you read the first 10 issues or so of the comic book, nobody would be praising it these days.  So just let the movie be itself and entertain people, which I believe it does very well.",1120867200,34,2169,4.441919191919192

See how profound it is?  And that's just one of many examples of dialog that makes me shudder.  Also I feel there was en effort on the part of the people affiliated with this movie to make it TOO funny, TOO comical.  It really took a lot away from the movie.

Now that being said the character development is wonderful you get to see these people move from ordinary people into excepting their role as superheros.  Everyone did a great job with this they actually struggle with it unlike most superhero movies.  Its really the part that saved the movie for me.

1555512,3,B00005JNTU,"It's been a dark summer for big-budget blockbusters.

Anakin Skywalker got amputated and incinerated in the latest ""Star Wars"" installment.

Brangelina rediscovered their G-spots by kicking the hell out of each other in ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith.""

The Scarecrow dosed Gotham City with some major bad trips in ""Batman Begins.""

And Martian tripods turned Earthlings into white ash, driftwood or tomato paste in ""War of the Worlds.""

Just as this summer's hits reached their bleakest pitch (and just as Thursday's bombings in London completely trumped the movies on the horror scale), a different kind of popcorn flick emerges.

It's big. It's dumb. It's fun. It's ""Fantastic Four,"" an adaptation of the Marvel Comics series about a quartet of humans transformed into superheroes.

Scientists Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) and pilots Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), rocket into space, catch a blast of a cosmic wave and return to Earth with strange new abilities: Reed can stretch his limbs like elastic; Sue can become invisible and project force fields; Johnny can generate and control flames; and Ben is transformed into a hulking, stone-skinned behemoth.

Naturally, they have no choice but to use their powers for the greater good.

On comic book pages, the Fantastic Four were always heavier ""advanced placement"" heroes: They were independently wealthy and most of their adventures involved space travel and quantum physics; secure in their fancy high-rise, the Four didn't even bother with secret identities.

But director Tim Story, and writers Michael France and Mark Frost, have adapted the saga into something infinitely less serious and enjoyably goofy. Here, the science, and most of the drama, is strictly on the level of ""Gilligan's Island,"" though with a little more irony and funnier jokes.

Onscreen, Gruffudd's Reed Richards, for example, is no longer the grim intellect of the comic book but a bankrupt, absent-minded egghead whom another character aptly calls, ""the world's dumbest smart guy.""

The filmmakers focus most of the movie on the Four's attempts to understand and deal with their new powers, with occasional asides as the camera ogles Alba in her skintight supersuit. Gigantic plot holes abound and a big showdown at the end almost feels like an afterthought.

But this is one of those movies in which plot holes and bad lines are beside the point, and the movie's giddy tone is set by Evans' Human Torch, a kid who's simply ecstatic to discover he's got superpowers. Though Michael Chiklis, as the deformed Ben Grimm, stands out as the movie's sulking heart.

Longtime comic book fans, and viewers who can't relax and go with the flow, may absolutely hate this movie, and honestly I sometimes couldn't tell if I was laughing with it or at it. But considering this is a story that involves rubber-faced heroes, cosmic waves and bad guys with names like ""Victor Von Doom,"" it's probably best spun as a comedy. It just wouldn't play straight.

Without a doubt, ""Fantastic Four"" is the dumbest smart movie of the summer",1120867200,5,3098,5.094861660079052
1555513,5,B00005JNTU,"What can I say about this movie other than this is the summer ""family"" movie.  This is the movie you can take your children to go see.  I enjoyed all the actors each one played a vital role.  They changed a little of the storyline from the original F4, like much of what marvel has been doing.  There is not to much gore, Doom, when he learned a little more about his power there were a few deaths but it is short.  Again Marvel has done a great job with jokes at the right time.  Even the score was real good.  Well placed music for the right time.  If you did not see stan lee he was in there (hint: u.p.s.).  Definitely worth the money to go see.

There is no comparsion between DC and marvel batman was more dark and more adult oriented while marvel has kept to its' successful family oriented formula.  I tip my hat off to stan lee and the director.",1120780800,4,854,4.115151515151515

The human torch was the best part of this movie though it was abvious he and much of this movie was aimed at teens. Batman Begins was a much much better film. There was some Unnecessary gross violence and  sexual Innuendo. Filmakers should make films that are watchable classics in ten years, not trendy teen movies with trendy fads like extreme sports.",1120780800,2,490,4.50561797752809
1555580,5,B00005JNTU,"I thought that the Fantastic 4 was a movie for anyone who likes comic book movies. I felt that the visuals were highly above average, and the acting was great. The story was much better than past superhero flicks, and the characters had emotions, but it was never over the top. Jessica Alba stole the show with her character Sue Storm. I am now a fan of her. Also Ioan Gruffudd was good as Mr. Fantastic, and Michael Chiklis was every bit as good as hes ever been. He played the Thing better than anyone else would in my opinion. I enjoyed every minute of this fun film and hope to see it again before it leaves theaters. It was the best movie iv seen this year. Everyone should see it. Maybe it isn't for you but I think that it has somthing for everyone. Story, action, drama, comedy, and style. It is NOT a waist of your time or your money to see this film. Three cheers for the Fantastic 4!",1120780800,3,894,4.203488372093023
1555581,4,B00005JNTU,"Going into the theater I was expecting very little from this film and was pleasantly surprised at how well it was done.  I enjoyed the characters, the special effects and the story.  I was very worried that Dr. Doom's character was going to be mishandled in the movie.  Instead, the writers approached the character in a creative way that works.  I read the Fantastic Four comics regularly as a kid and this movie does not disappoint.",1120780800,2,434,4.671052631578948
1555582,3,B00005JNTU,"not saying the movie is that good and all, but it's quiet fun. worth the admission. 2 things why it could've been good, first despite an efficient opening telling us how the characters became super-human it took quiet a while to came to good-guy-bad-guy battle.  second, when the battle actually happened, it was too short, not enough time to feel the excitement.

but hey, if you'relooking for fun, this might be it.",1120780800,2,417,4.777777777777778
1555583,5,B00005JNTU,"Rodger Ebert was wrong..if you read his review he didn't believe this was a film was impressive.  It may not be a critical success. However it does capture the characters. Especially the Thing.  He was my favorite! Without him the movie wouldn't have worked. His character was pivotal and was the turning point of the movie.

Although the director took some creative licence to change Dr. Doom, it was a crowd pleaser.  The kids and parents in the audience were cheering the Thing and the group as they were battling with Dr. Doom.

I have to say that a lot of the bad press this movie has on the web is wrong.  It's not a dark Batman type of super hero movie! It's one of those films that you can take your family to without having to do a lot of explaining to your children.  I only hope that the sequel can be made with the Silver Surfer and Galactus.

...if done right...the Surfer and Galactus would be a landmark film with acting and CGI.  Let's hope for FF 2!",1120780800,6,966,4.322222222222222
1555584,2,B00005JNTU,"First of all, if a movie takes over an hour to build up the chracter of a villain , it should take more than ten seconds before that villain's wrath is over and done with.  I like that a million comic book movies come out each year, but they should force the screenwriters of each one to read the comics and at least be true to the content for the sake of hard-core comic book fans like myself.  Doctor Doom could take on these four punks and an army of other heros and not break a sweat, and anyone that is going to see this movie should realize that.",1120780800,2,552,4.055045871559633
1555585,4,B00005JNTU,"This year's ""Fantastic Four"" has been one of the most anticipated ""comic book to film"" movies.  While the movie isn't always faithful to the comic book and cartoon, it's still an action packed, fact paced thrill ride.

The movie starts off with Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) trying to get Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) and his company to finance a space experiment.  The three, along with Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), Reed's former girlfriend, and her brother, Johnny (Chris Evans) all go to the space station together.  Things, of course, go horribly wrong.

The result of the botched mission wreaks havoc on everyone's DNA.  Reed, a.k.a., Mr. Fantastic, now has the ability to stretch to extraordinary lengths and contort his body into any shape; Susan, a.k.a. the Invisible Woman, can disappear (with heightened frustration or anger) as well as form and throw force fields; Johnny, a.k.a. the Human Torch, bursts into flame, flies and can throw fireballs; and Ben, a.k.a. The Thing, is transformed into an indestructible, ""Hulk-ish"" figure who is externally and internally solid rock.

After an incident on the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, the group is thrust into the spotlight and dubbed the ""Fantastic Four"".  However, while trying to work on a remedy to their conditions, a nemesis raises his head in the form of Victor Von Doom who was also affected in space.  The shielding that was protecting him on the space station is slowly becoming part of his skeleton and allowing him to conduct massive amounts of energy.  It's up to the group to stop Doom, who is now bent on revenge against them.

One of the pluses of this movie is the cast.  Not only is it a good cast but one filled with fresh faces.  Each person also brings an impressive resume to the movie.  Jessica Alba is really coming into her own with this movie as well as having a starring role in this year's earlier hit, ""Sin City"".  Chris Evans is also an up and comer having appeared in last year's flick, ""Cellular""  Ioan Gruffudd from ""Titanic"" and the ""Horatio Hornblower"" series and Julian McMahon from TV's ""Nip/Tuck"" not only shine in this movie but are also supposedly two of the top contenders to inherit the James Bond role.  Michael Chiklis is also a seasoned actor and has gained exposure as well as an Emmy for his work on ""The Shield"".

The pace and the plot in general are also good.  The plot is not overly technical or complicated and carries a nice blend of action and comedy, especially a shaving crme incident between Johnny Storm and the Thing.  The pace of the movie rarely allows for a dull moment.  It keeps your attention from the moment it begins and doesn't let it go until the credits are rolling.

What could the movie have worked on? The emotional aspects of the characters could have been drawn out more.  Chiklis, as the Thing, did this well.  However, most people would be a little freaked out if they suddenly burst into flames unexpectedly.  The characters seemed to take these changes as if they were an everyday, normal occurrence.

The movie could have shown more and explained the personal relationships between some of the characters.  Was there some sort of relationship between Doom and Susan?  At the beginning there appeared to be but later she said there wasn't.  Was there a particular reason Doom didn't like Reed Richards?  Some background information on that would have been interesting.  It also would have been nice to see more of the friendship between the Thing and his new girlfriend.

Supposedly the cast has signed on to film a total of three movies so maybe some of these questions will be answered in time.  However, the ""Fantastic Four"" is a good starting point.  Is it going to be winning a Best Picture Oscar?  No.  But for a fun movie for the entire family, it doesn't get any better than this.",1120780800,8,3859,4.741741741741742
1555586,4,B00005JNTU,"The only reason why I came here to see F4 is Jessica Alba. You'll probably get to see her in more films to come. Her next one is ""Into the Blue"" which comes out in late September. Her body's hot, her looks are hot, and you can really see through her. As for F4, this happens to one great but-kicking movie. The real star however is The Thing(Played with passion and sensitivity by ""The Shield""'s Michael Chiklis). He's a strong hero who can save an FDNY truck-and throws a big SUV to thwart out  Dr. Doom's evil plans. Kudos also goes out to Julian McMahon, who goes from playing a good Doc(Dr. Troy on ""Nip/Tuck"", another great FX show)to playing a real bad one. I have a strange feeling when this movie had a great ending, which made moviegoers leave the screen happy, but at the very end, Dr. Doom was boxed as the cargo was shipped off to the ficticious  country called Latveria, which means there could be a sequel in the works. Can't wait for that. To be continued...",1120780800,6,973,4.370165745856354
1555587,5,B00005JNTU,"Apparently we are living in the golden age of comic book movies.  Last summer we had ""Spiderman 2"" and this summer we had ""Batman Begins"" and now ""Fantastic Four.""  As a result, memories of ""Hulk"" and ""Elektra"" are quickly receding into the background.  The worst of times are over and let us enjoy the best of times while we can, hoping that Hollywood gets the point regarding the importance of fidelity to the spirit, if not the letter, of the original comic books they are bringing to the big screen.

The Fantastic Four, who will be confused with ""The Incredibles"" even though they should not be, are Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm/The Invisible Girl (Jessica Alba), her brother Johnny Storm/The Human Torch (Chris Evans), and Ben Grimm/The Thing (Michael Chiklis).  The genesis for ""The World's Greatest Comic Book"" was Stan Lee and Jack Kirby taking the idea of a superhero group (to wit, the Justice League of America) and giving it a twist by having the members always at each other's throat.  The screenplay by Mark Frost (""Hill Street Blues,"" ""Twin Peaks"") and Michael France (""Hulk,"" ""Punisher"") ups the ante on that dysfunctionality.  Of course you have the Thing mad at everybody, but primarily at Reed, whom he blames for the transformation, and Johnny, who is always adding insult to the aforementioned injury along with a bevy of practical jokes.  But now we also have Reed and Sue being an ex-couple with unresolved issues from their breakup and Sue constantly telling Johnny to grow up (especially when he publicly lays the ""Invisible Girl"" label on her).

There are a lot of things that I think this movie has working in its favor.  First, the humor, of which there is a lot, is mostly character driven and rarely overplayed, without taking away from the seriousness of the storyline.  Second, when there are fight sequences you can actually see what is going on because Tim Story is not relying on rapid editing of shots to simply convey an effect.  Third, there is an effort to deal realistically with these powers, from what happens to their clothes to asking the big question that has been on the minds of everyone regarding Mr. Fantastic since issue #1 of the comic book (okay, the question goes back to Plastic Man, but nod your head and play along).  Fourth, when we get to the big finale the F.F. actually work as a team.  True, if you are four against one that makes sense, but the contrast to the X-Men movies where everybody teams up for fights or takes turns fighting Magneto was good to see.  Finally, for the first time, in his cameo Stan Lee actually plays a recognizable and beloved character from the original comic book and for that matter I liked the casting with Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington), and hope there is a scene or two between her and Ben that will appear in the deleted scenes on the DVD (which I expect to see out for Christmas).

For me the problematic parts of the story line have to do with the new and improved Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon).  On the hand I understand the problem when you have a quartet of superheroes going up against a guy wearing armor and a cloak.  After all, Doom is not as smart as Reed and not as strong as the Thing, so being the FF's greatest villain given the inherent one-to-four odds had to rely on other things, which was usually the element of surprise and the fact Doom was the king of Latveria.  Having diplomatic immunity is a nice roadblock for superheroes to have to deal with in repeat encounters.  What they go for here is to have Victor along for the ride so when dem cosmic rays hit he gets some powers too and has his own dermatological concerns.  The Marvel universe reference would be Electro, but I was going for the irony of Dr. Doom being like the Emperor in ""Star Wars,"" because I think the shadow of Darth Vader effects Doom's characterization.  Because the weakest part of this whole movie is Doom's ""normal"" speaking voice once he dons his armor because I have always thought of him as being to the right of Magneto on the megalomaniac scale.  I want Dr. Doom to sound like the king of a European postage stamp nation bringing down his wrath on those who dare oppose him (yes, I think the voice makes that much of a difference, a point amply proven by Darth Vader).

I still end up rounding up on this one at the end even though I am not enamored of the Thing wearing long pants, being married, or looking like he did in issue #1 rather than developing the ridged forehead.  I am glad that they explained at one point that Victor's company was out to ruin Reed because I found the idea that Mr. Fantastic is not as smart as we think that he is rather unsettling.  Sue Storm is certainly a modern woman and we refer to this film as ""the new Jessica Alba movie"" around our house, but it is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm who keeps trying to steal this movie.  Johnny is no longer a teenager, but he has that mentality and Evans milks the role for all it is worth.  Clearly Marvel is always looking for a franchise with any and all of their comic book movies and given that long-range view I also would have liked them to have twisted the knife a bit more with Ben Grimm (e.g., only hint at Alicia at this point), because I think they were a bit too quick to throw away one of the more tragic comic book figures in the Marvel universe.  I was going to say you cannot go back and revisit that initial ground again, but we already learned this summer that you can.",1120780800,9,5490,4.506048387096774
1555588,4,B00005JNTU,"I was gonna listen to the bad reviews and not see this movie. That would've been a big mistake though. Ebert gave it one star and called the 5 main characters idiots for what they attempt in outta space. Well scientists are always  planning on doing something far fetched in movies that don't make sense. Here it just sets up for them to get their powers. Plus Ebert loved Batman Begins and just way way too hard on this movie because he thinks people should see that instead. Well Batman already made a lot of money. Now is Fantastic Four's turn. I've known people who said Batman Begins was boring. I loved it but this movie is more fun and has a lot more humor. I don't think people will be disapointed in it after seeing Batman at all. Yes that is what a Batman  movie should be like and Fanastic Four is...what a Fantastic Four movie should be like.

  I've seen cartoon shows and this is exactly what it was like. So yes the whole lets go in space and do this and that is a flat idea. From what I know though, it came straight from the comics. It doesn't hold the movie back though. It's still a great comic adaption and a stronger one than Eleckra, Daredevil, Punisher and The Hulk. It has it's silly moments but still they don't take away from how enjoyable this movie is. I thought the cast does a fine job making their characters work.

  Ioan Gruffudd (King Arthur) fairs well as Reed Richards who gets stretching powers. Each power they get fits their personality. He's a dreamer and always reaching for the stars so that's why he got that ability. Jessica Alba (SinCity) as Susan Storm does ok too as Richards' former g/f who feels invisable compared to his love for science. So she gets invisable powers. Chris Evans (Cellular) as Johny Storm is hilarious as a young pilot hotshot with a flaming ego. So he gets powers where he literly goes on fire. Michael Chiklis (The Shield) steals the show as well as Ben Grimm. He's Reed's bestfriend and protector. So since he's seen as being like a rock, he turns into a big rock guy. He loses his wife due to how he looks now. Plus the whole world stares at him. So he has the most trouble accepting his new powers since unlike the others he can't turn them on and off.

  Julian McMahon (Nip/Tuck, Charmed) plays Victor Von Doom who funded their mission to space. He also is on the ship and gets some powes as well. His start turning him steal and give him powers to shoot electric bolts. Like Johny Storm, he embraces his powers the most. Storm though just wants to show them off. Victor though wants to use them to kill whoever pisses him off and to rule. McMahon plays him well too and does a fine job  crossing over from tv to film. Although Doom is supposed to have an accent. Oh well, not McMahon's fault he was mis-casted.  Still he makes the best of the part.

  When I saw that the movie was getting bad reviews I figured it was due to Tim Story's direction. He also did that dud Taxi. However I think he handles the action and everything fine. So I think one star is very very hard on this film. It's tons of fun with funny one-liners, especially from Chris Evans. Plus when the four of them don't get along and usee their powers against each other, it's just great fun. Especially when Grimm gets mad at Johny Storm for nick naming him the Thing in front of millions of people. When those two exchange words or get ready to fight, it's just good stuff. Chiklis really is the Thing and pulls off the part fantastic!

  Should this movie be dismissed with one star ? Hell no! I think it's just as entertaining as the Spiderman movies.  So take a chance like me and go see it. Expect something awful and you're gonna have a blast. I like it because it has it's own style. Who says a comic movie has to be overly serious like DareDevil the Hulk or the Punisher . This movie has more of a cartoonish style and what is so terrible about that. I think that is what makes it a good adaption to the comic. So what if it's aimed for kids, aren't they the ones who read comics ? Plus the effects are not that bad like Ebert & Roeper said. When Reed stretches around The Thing to calm him down, I think that  looked great and just how it should look.  Don't listen to Ebert & Roeper, they think people should just rush to see documentaries about migrating birds. They don't know what a good time is.",1120780800,4,4355,4.304773561811506
