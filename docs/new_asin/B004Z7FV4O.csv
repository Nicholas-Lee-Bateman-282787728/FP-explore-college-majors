4506604,5,B004Z7FV4O,"The vendor does great credit to Amazon- product arrived quickly and well packaged. This vendor GREATLY exceeded expectations! This offering is a true video treasure! The TV series had come upon hard times in the late '60s being called ""racist"" Many of the original cast members died broken hearted.
  Reverend Jesse Jackson mounted a brilliant defense of this historic and ground breaking TV Series, pointing out that this series was in the true vanguard- ALL Black Cast, Black humor, and Universally FUNNY! The way was paved for a myriad of aspiring Black TV Actors.
  This great set will show the viewer true comedy. Great Value and hours of fun! Buy this set!

4506605,5,B004Z7FV4O,"I was reluctant to purchase since the price was relatively low and most of the reviews I read from more expensive sources were pretty bad.  But, I figured I would give it a try and throw it out if it was bad but I was very happily surprised.  Sure, it's in black & white but that's how I originally saw it and we sat and watched the entire first CD at one sitting.  I highly recommend this and I'm going to buy another one or two as gifts for some of my friends.",1339718400,3,462,3.946236559139785

4506607,5,B004Z7FV4O,"I very much agree with Tom's review. I also was hesitant due to reviews of other DVD's, but after reading Tom's review I thought I would take a chance. I am so glad that I did. Once you get past the introduction, which is just a few minutes, the program quality is quite good for a show that old. I was thrilled to see the episodes that I used to watch with my dad, when I was young. They are so funny. I am ordering another one for my friend. Thank you, JD Classics!",1329177600,17,467,3.978723404255319
4506608,5,B004Z7FV4O,"I don't do reviews...but...this is an exception.  I almost didn't place this order because of some prior reviews.  The big negative were the comments on video quality.  Let me say that when you consider the source (old TV programs) which didn't have the ability to create the quality recordings that we take for granted today...this is a HOMERUN!  Everyone thinks they're great and the seller threw in a DVD of ""Dragnet"" with Jack Webb with a comment ""Happy Holidays"" as a bonus.  This was a first class operation.  Oh...I almost forgot...the order was received within five days arriving before Christmas and that was just with standard ground shipping.",1326758400,19,653,5.0

previously I received a bootleg version of this since it was banned by the NAACP.  It still must be a bootleg because the quality of this tape was just as bad as the bootleg-so this must be a more professionally put together bootleg with the ridiculous cover mistake.  # of stars only because of love for the show.",1412726400,,559,4.295238095238095

The stereotypes of black people abound, but there can be no doubt about the comedic excellence of the programs.  The outstanding cast portray their characters to the hilt.  You cannot help but laugh at the ""situations"" in this comedy.

4506628,5,B004Z7FV4O,"I thoroughly enjoyed these early television episodes of Amos 'n Andy.  The quality of the video and sound leave a lot to be desired, but I think they did the best they could.  I enjoyed this program on radio when I was a little kid in the 1940's, and probably enjoyed the television version even better.",1364083200,,303,4.392857142857143

Still I watch these and never fail to laugh.  Quality was good for the time they were made.  More than worth the money.  This show will never die because it is downright funny.

4506637,5,B004Z7FV4O,"My set of DVDs was very good quality.  On occasion there was a 1/2 second audio glitch, and there were one or two 1-second video glitches.  IN THE ENTIRE SET.  What I'm saying is that the audio and video quality was excellent throughout.  The one exception to that was the first item on disk one -- Freeman and Gosden introducing some of the actors.  This part was poor quality, but not so poor that you couldn't enjoy it or see and hear what was going on.

Not only does this set contain all episodes, but also it contains bonus material -- the two Amos and Andy cartoons, the movie Check and Double Check, and the documentary Anatomy of a Controversy.  You get all of that in this set.

I've listened to many of the radio episodes, I've watched all of the TV episodes, I watched a bit of the two cartoons, and I watched most of Check and Double Check.  In my opinion, the TV series is the least offensive toward blacks; and the two cartoons are the most offensive.

In my opinion, the TV series has unfairly been called ""racist"".  Sure, the core group of characters are mostly caricatures of black people.  (Like all other comedy shows, they are caricatures so that they will be funny.)  But some things are of note with the Amos and Andy TV series: (1) Almost all of the actors in the series are black. (2) Unless their part specifically calls for them to be portrayed in a bad way (e.g. as a criminal), virtually all of the black ""background"" characters are portrayed as professional, educated, competent, well-spoken, well-groomed, and dependable.  (3) The black ""background"" characters are at all levels of society: owners of companies, corporate executives, judges, police officers, lawyers, doctors, department managers, soldiers, bellhops, mailmen, etc. (4) There is never, ever any hint of racism in the show; blacks and whites interact in perfect harmony, friendship, and decency toward each other.

I can imagine the subliminal message that black children continually received when watching the Amos and Andy TV series: If you get an education and do your job, you will be a success in life; however, if you try to cheat others (like Kingfish continually did), you will always lose.

The comedy lines in the Amos and Andy TV series are first rate, and always clean.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching it!",1357257600,,2317,4.738154613466334

4506644,4,B004Z7FV4O,"You know, I have read some reviews on Amazon regarding these DVD's which complain about the ""quality"" of them. Well, while I agree that there is a possibility that the DVD's might have been transferred at a higher resolution (SP instead of SLP, etc..), it MUST be remembered how long ago these Episodes were on TV and how RARE they seem to be. I have NEVER seen a ""studio"" release of these, PROBABLY due to their ""controversial"" nature back when this was a LONG running radio series and the main African-American characters were played by White actors (Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, who produced these TV episodes), and so I think an ""official"" studio release from remastered master tapes (or FILM!) is HIGHLY unlikely! This is a crying shame, because these episodes are HILARIOUS! The black actors who portrayed the characters on TV fit their roles PERFECTLY and are ALL talented and VERY funny! The short recording on Disc 1 where the TV actors were introduced IN CHARACTER by Correll and Gosden to a live studio audience before the first episode filmed, shows how amazing the casting was for this series! Again, the quality is pretty standard for a series which is THIS old and probably wasn't transferred from studio master material. People who complain about that are being UNREALISTIC in their expectations. We are LUCKY that someone out there has preserved this wonderful comedy and makes it available to all of us for quite a reasonable price, I might add! If you are a ""mediaphile"", and insist that all that you watch has to be High Definition, then this collection IS NOT going to satisfy you. Again, that is an unrealistic expectation. One of my other favorite series from the early days of television is ""The Honeymooners"", which WAS released officially on DVD by the studio and even some of THOSE episodes are not of the highest resolution or sharpest quality, but that is o.k. when you remember you are watching shows which were televised not long after the end of World War II! OF COURSE, I wish too that the quality was higher, but I am THRILLED to have these in my collection and to be able to watch them anytime I want to return to Brooklyn and watch the exploits and adventures of my favorite Mystic Knights of the Sea Lodge!!! I HIGHLY recommend this product for those who loved this series and can appreciate their rarity and comic genius!",1354147200,2,2366,4.731234866828087

Look at laurel and hardy  or three stooges films on DVD. Far older film and quality 1000% better. Shame on amazon for selling such junk,1344124800,4,282,4.58
4506648,5,B004Z7FV4O,"I was too young to see Amos & Andy during the original run however, I saw a few episodes on cable a few years back and they were hilarious.

Like some of the other purchasers I was skeptical about making this purchase due to the comments about poor video quality.  However, I took a chance and ordered anyway.

When I received my order I quickly loaded the first DVD into my player.

I would like to caution potential purchaser that the first thing that you will see will be archive footage presenting the Amos & Andy cast.  The quality of this footage is very poor.

I started to regret my purchase but then I skipped to the episodes.  The clarity of the episodes are excellent considering the age of the film.

Thank you JD Sales for getting this gem to me so quickly and thank you Amazon for listing it in my recommendations.
