5957591,5,B00EZ227X2,"Say ""I Love You"" is an anime that starts off with an anti-social teenage girl named Mei Tachibana. She is a girl who's had a few friends before in elementary school but was ultimately betrayed by them. Since that day when her ""friends"" blamed the death of the class's pet rabbit on her, Mei has put a strong guard up and believes there's no point in trusting others because they will always hurt you in the end. One day, a classmate at school named Nakanishi decides to bother Mei by lifting up her knee-length skirt. Mei gets angry and turns around to kick her assailant but she accidentally hits Yamato Kurosawa, the most popular boy in school. Yamato starts to take an interest in Mei and later on, he gives her his number. Mei doesn't plan to use it but when she is being stalked while going home from her after school job, she calls Yamato for help. Yamato gets rid of the stalker...with a kiss for Mei! Mei's first kiss starts her gradual change towards becoming a person who can make friends, trust others, and fall in love.

Say ""I Love You"" really pulled me in with the nice animation and pleasing music. Say ""I Love You"" is dramatic, cute, makes you feel all warm and fuzzy, and overall just really fun to watch. Although Say ""I Love You"" isn't exactly a comedy anime, there are some funny scenes sprinkled throughout the episodes. The little animation of Mei and her cat Marshmallow is cute and funny. The main cast of characters includes Mei, Yamato, Nakanishi (as you might have figured out, Yamato's friend who is a bit of a pervert), Asami (a bubbly girl who befriends Mei and becomes Nakanishi's girlfriend), and Aiko (a tall, slender girl who used to be chubby, but lost weight for Yamato; she now has a boyfriend who likes her for her). Later on, two characters threaten to ruin Mei and Yamato's relationship. Kai, a boy who used to be bullied and was Yamato's best friend, and Megumi, a popular amateur model who develops a crush on Yamato and gets him to join as a model for her magazine. Eventually, Kai realizes he likes Mei and tells her. These two love rivals challenge Mei and Yamato and makes the pair strengthen their bond. The romantic moments between Mei and Yamato are superb. The two express their like for each other with mostly actions, not just words. I like this show not tell aspect of their relationship. Before Mei even says ""I love you"", you can tell that by those small moments with her and Yamato that she does reciprocate Yamato's passionate feelings.

I would recommend Say ""I Love You"" to people who are looking for something refreshing, sweet, and warm all at the same time. I'd like to mention Say ""I Love You"" has a total of 13 episodes. Say ""I Love You"" also has a manga with a total of 11 volumes currently released in Japan and was recently licensed in North America (scheduled release date is April 2014!). For fans of shojo who want to watch an anime that's similar to Kimi Ni Todoke (although, Say ""I Love You"" has some smut and is at times, more mature than Kimi Ni Todoke), give Say ""I Love You"" a try!",1379721600,53,3057,4.48653500897666

5957617,1,B00EZ227X2,"The show itself is 5 stars, but the idiots who developed the Blu-Ray made it so that on the second Blu-Ray disk that if you turn the language to Japanese then you cannot possibly turn off the English subtitles. I do not need subtitles, and now this Blu-Ray is absolute junk to me because of some idiot creating a problem out of something that should have never had been a problem to begin with. There is absolutely no problem with older anime's on Blu-Ray, I can change the language with no problem. This a recent thing that Funimation keeps doing with their newer Blu-Ray releases(Shiki, Sankarea, etc..), but I never expected Sentai to do such a thing, and it needs to be stopped! There is no excuse for it. This work is originally in Japanese and Sentai/Funimation need to respect that! No, they have a JOB that they are not doing as in not respecting that.",1437004800,,860,4.519230769230769

5957619,2,B00EZ227X2,"Only reason I gave 2 stars is because the dub was quite enjoyable. I only finished episodes 1-6. This show was a let down. I expected realism with a serious tone. Not a emotional uphill battle in every episode. Which I may add, in circumstances that would never happen to a average individual. In each episode the plot surrounded around a problem with the main character Yamato. Which i may add is a complete idiot, and not issei off of dxd dumb but an iq of 60 dumb. The show was only moving forward stoey wise because of all the awkwardness from the side characters. I saw no story growth from the interaction of the two main characters themselves but just from fighting through the problems the side characters brought. The shows good for newcomers to the genre but for people that are more advanced in their watching just skip or watch on a boring day if you feel like getting pumped up and screaming at your TV. Don't watch this unless you want to get a migraine.",1436572800,,968,4.443820224719101

5957621,5,B00EZ227X2,"I bought this one on BD after having the DVD version that I very much liked. The girl, Tachibana Mei, somehow makes it so likeable and funny because of her inability to handle the matters of the heart but bravely facing them with a great personality that when revealed made her a lot more lovable to other guys... :)

The final Festival episode is superb in my opinion...",1426896000,2,371,4.455882352941177
5957622,4,B00EZ227X2,"Now, this review is based on the English dub. I have not watched it with subtitles yet. The animation is beautiful and it follows up through about the first 6 volumes of the manga. It may go through volume 7 but I'm not sure since it's not out yet. Of course, there are a few changes: certain scenes cut that appear in the manga but as a whole these changes don't really affect the storyline. What I wasn't too thrilled about was the English voice actors. They weren't terrible and as a whole they were good but for the most part they all, especially the voice actors for Mei and Yamato, spoke very softly and almost sounded either bored or on the verge of crying. That bothered me because it didn't sound natural. When the characters got excited in the anime, the voice actors would sometimes also sound excited but then they would immediately go back to quietly talking and sounding bored. Now, as I mentioned, I haven't watched it in the original Japanese with subtitles yet to know if the Japanese voice actors speak with the same quiet monotone but I'd like to think they don't. The only episode that had some actual energy was the very last episode and I don't know if it's part of the manga or one of the random filler episodes that anime does when they are doing a series that hasn't finished in the manga and don't want to do the entire manga so they need an ending episode that's not part of the manga. That was a cute episode and as I said, it was one of the very few times when the English dub was full of energy.

So, as a whole, I would recommend this series to anyone who loves the manga but I can't recommend watching it with the English dub. I hope the Japanese sub is better.

5957625,4,B00EZ227X2,"This is a very good anime on high school life based on a Japanese manga (comic).  A girl who has no friends and has a somber attitude on life is befriended by the most popular student.  She at first is hesitant about his friendship but becomes to accept it.  There are problems here and there and they try to work it out.  There are 13 episodes about 20 minutes long.  There are some vignettes on the second disc.  Unfortunately, there was a 14th episode which was made later and is not on the disc.  Surprisingly, the US version has all 13 regular episodes in one package, but the Japanese market version are sold in individual discs for each chapter.  Go figure.

The anime itself is the typical Japanese style with breathtaking backdrops.  It does have English subtitles and dubs.  The dubs are pretty bad as they sound a bit over acted.

The story must have been pretty popular as they followed up with a live action film version as well...",1424908800,2,944,4.488235294117647

5957647,1,B00EZ227X2,"I received this as a gift from a friend who thought I might enjoy it more than she had. I was excited about this because everyone hyped this up so much....and it WAS SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. It started out great! But, quickly I lost interest, began to REALLY DISLIKE THE HEROINE when originally I felt so bad for her, and forced myself through the bland second half.

This is nothing new for shoujo. I was blown away by the anime Kamisama Kiss, which I will be purchasing, but I cannot recommend Say I love You unless you want another cliche shoujo or unless you're new to out the genre. I will admit that the first part WAS GOOD, but it quickly went downhill. If you like bland heroines like Chizuru from Hakuoki, or Nanami from Uta Pri, you will like this.

5957648,5,B00EZ227X2,"I'm a big anime fan and love a good romance anime. The problem with a majority of the ""romance"" category in anime, however, is that it takes far too long for the main character and their love interest to confess their love for each other and become a couple-- after a season's worth of obvious signs. This anime is quite different. It actually gives you what you want right at the beginning. Our heroine Mei begins dating Yamato in the first few episodes, after all. Talk about instant satisfaction for a romance-anime fan! Instead of having to deal with the usual, stereotypical will-they-won't-they of getting together by the end of the show, we as viewers get to watch a quiet, hardened girl experience love for the first time, deal with its ups-and-downs, and discover that true friends ARE worth having. I'll admit, there are a few instances in which it gets a little frustrating watching Mei have doubts when Yamato is so obviously in love with her, but this just makes her seem all the more real and true to her character. Because, let's face it, we've all had our insecurities and doubts, and it's refreshing to see Mei portrayed like this and not like some bubbly and clueless goody-goody. Mei has been hurt by her ""friends"" in the past in a traumatic experience for her, causing her to close herself off to everyone around her. She doesn't need anyone, and is perfectly fine on her own. She's inwardly strong, and isn't afraid to protect other's from being bullied either. Like I said, very refreshing. I highly recommend this anime, and when you're done with it, be sure to read the manga because it continues on past the anime. Enjoy!",1403049600,,1646,4.679310344827586
