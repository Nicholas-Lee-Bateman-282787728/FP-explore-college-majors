2677788,5,B000JMKKL8,"Bought this item for my son and he loves it!!! I ordered it for Christmas and was a little worried it wouldn't make it to my house in time, but to my surprise it arrived very quickly!!",1326499200,3,184,4.0
2677789,3,B000JMKKL8,I purchased this hoping to get the Donald train as the package indictated but instead recieved the two thomas trains as pictured (gold and original).  I am disappointed not to have gotten Donald but it is still cheaper than buying the engines individually.,1260144000,,256,4.953488372093023
2677790,4,B000JMKKL8,"This does not come with a Thomas and gold Thomas as pictured, but rather with a black wooden Donald engine and matching coal tender car with the number ""9"" on the side.  If you look closely you will see on the DVD box pictured that it says ""Donald"" above the pocket that holds the trains so I was expecting this and was not disappointed, however, if you want the trains in the picture you won't get them.  That said, the video is a Thomas video and our 2 year old loves it, it contains 7 episodes and a running time of 39 minutes, plus 60 minutes of ""bonus features"" such as 2 sing-along songs, a ""DVD game"" called Sodor Spelling Game and a ""chracter gallery"".  I haven't checked these out.  Overall a great deal as long as you are expecting a Donald set!",1253404800,2,755,4.258741258741258

2677792,1,B000JMKKL8,If you're getting this DVD for the trains like i was don't bother unless you're looking for 2 Thomas trains. You're not going to get Donald like the picture shows.,1242777600,3,163,4.466666666666667
2677793,4,B000JMKKL8,"My three year old grandson is fascinated with choo-choos and he would watch this and the other Thomas titles all day long if allowed.  I actually wore out an inexpensive DVD player on this title (it was continuously running in the background just a single click away).

The lessons imbedded in the stories are positive (we all would like to classified as ""really useful engines"") and the characters are quirky and memorable. My only issues with this and the others in this collection are that the added features (such as the games) are pretty lame and the individual chapters are sometimes out of order in relation to the story arc.  But I would highly recommend this for those with train-loving small children.",1173312000,5,711,4.811475409836065
