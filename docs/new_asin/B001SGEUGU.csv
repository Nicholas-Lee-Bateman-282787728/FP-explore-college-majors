8339818,1,B001SGEUGU,Does anyone want lessons from Troma on how to direct a movie? I'm sorry but if I was to take a course on filmmaking it wouldn't be hosted by Lloyd Kaufman.,1395360000,,155,4.032258064516129
8339819,5,B001SGEUGU,"You may or may not like his approach, but every film maker will learn a great deal from Lloyd Kaufman.  You don't have to be a fan or Troma, or the films it produces, but every student of film should own these dvds.  They are as much of learning tool as any textbook or lecture from a billion dollar film school.  In fact, these dvds of Lloyd Kaufman do more than any film school.  Mr. Kaufman actually inspires first time film makers to go out and MAKE THEIR OWN DAMN MOVIE!

John F. Kennedy once said, A man does what he must -- in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers, and pressures -- and that is the basis of all human morality.  Underneath all the craziness and humor of Troma and Lloyd Kaufman, I honestly believe that this is what Mr. Kaufman is trying to portrait.  In essence, Mr. Kaufman says ""Do Not Give Up"".

I doubt that Mr. Kaufman will ever read this review, but I still want to give my thanks to him.  Without these dvds, I would have never made my own movie.",1393718400,4,1006,4.252631578947368
8339820,5,B001SGEUGU,Purchased for my 21 year old son's Christmas gift.  A good quality paper back book and very easy to read.,1388793600,,105,4.25
8339821,5,B001SGEUGU,"This guy is a nut and hard core maker of movies. The whole set is kind of like a lot of outtakes and behind the scenes stuff from many different projects. But, it's informative as all get out. Buy it.",1367452800,,200,4.025
8339822,5,B001SGEUGU,"Lloyd Kaufman is a loon. He's also a filmmaker, writer, and all-around decent guy. He manages, in his own twisted Castskills comedian way, to get across the fundamentals of GETTING the film made, not necessarily how to implement the ""rules"" of filmmaking such as shot selection, etc. You can study film theory all day, but this tells you how to put film theory to use.",1364947200,2,368,4.676923076923077
8339823,1,B001SGEUGU,"I was not happy with this item. It was shoddily produced and gave little in terms of solid information on low budget filmmaking that has not already been covered thousands of times in other books and videos.

This seems more like a cheap video camera diary of Lloyd Kauffman's - and we've seen and heard more from him in past videos and books and he simply recycles the same old information but puts it in a new package.

There were interviews with film-makers who gave little other than common sense information and advice, much of it out of date, and some of it just downright obnoxious. The sound, lighting and editing were so bad I could barely get through it.

Troma is known for low budget schlock and sleaze and the lowest production values one can possibly muster - and this so called ""how to"" video was no exception.

Filmmakers can make no-budget movies today with class, style and substance with far better production values than Troma, so set the bar higher than ground zero.

This is trash bin documentary making at its worst, and it seems Mr. Kauffman continues to be it's most ardent purveyor.

Don't waste your money.",1310947200,,1133,4.64
8339824,5,B001SGEUGU,"In this DVD set, Lloyd Kaufman, president of Troma and creator of New Jersey's own superhero, the Toxic Avenger, imparts upon the viewer his experiences and lessons gained from over thirty years in the independent movie industry.

This video is not for somebody looking to break into the glitz and glamor of Hollywood, so if that's what you are after, look elsewhere. It is instead a great set of lessons on how to make your own movie outside of the typical Hollywood system. From raising money yourself to working on a set, Lloyd lets you in on what he has learned, and it is indeed very useful for somebody who has a vision and wants to bring it to the screen. So if you are a motivated film maker with a vision and no0 desire to sit around and wait for Hollywood to come calling, pick this DVD up. You'll learn lots, and if you're motivated, it will put you on the road to making your own damn movie!",1296777600,2,903,4.34319526627219
8339825,1,B001SGEUGU,"There are no subtitle and no closed caption on these DVDs.  We are very disappointed that we cannot understand what they said verbally most of the time because we are hearing impaired. The producer, lloyd kaufman must be bigotry toward deaf and hard-of-hearing people because he simply ignored subtitles and closed caption, and he only cares for his huge profit by selling these junk DVDs.",1274227200,,389,4.984615384615385
8339826,5,B001SGEUGU,"Lloyd Kaufman -- co-founder and president of Troma Entertainment, paragon of independent filmmaking and all around decent guy -- once again is offering a look into his creative process -- warts, vomit, and all -- with this 4-disc DVD box set, ""Direct Your Own Damn Movie"". These DVD's offer an invaluable look into the movie making process with behind the scenes features, interviews with filmmakers and a glimpse into what it takes to promote your movie when you are working outside the Hollywood system.

As fledging, wanna-be filmmakers, we can all benefit from Mr. Kaufman's years of experience with truly independent film, and this shows it like it is -- it's not always pretty, but when the love and drive is there, it's always worth the effort. And even if you are not preparing to bring your vision to screen, this is still chocked full of hilarious, interesting and sometimes shocking entertainment!

BUY TROMA!
