7897937,1,6305871124,"Y  is this the wrong movie?  Because I was looking fo the one staring SONNY LANDHAM aka 1} Bill Ashley,  2} Tex Miller.  A porn movie made back in the 70's ! !  I'am a big fan of Mr. Landham's and am trying to have all of his movies. Will keep trying!",1340409600,,251,3.75
7897938,5,6305871124,"I can't believe the low star ratings this film had received! This is classic, lowbudget 50's film making at it's best! Yes, it's kitchey, but that is the beauty. In my opinion, this is a better film than Endless Summer. GREAT scenes of the 50s and great surf scenes. Wonderful footage of some of surfing's legends before they became legends. And if you are a fan of 50's cars, feast for the eyes. This was the film that made me a surf film fanatic. You just have to take it for what it is. Bruce Brown's corny narration and the jazz music...classic. I wouldn't change a moment.",1329868800,2,577,4.401869158878505
7897939,3,6305871124,"If you want to see the COOLEST kids of the 50's catching HUGE waves and doing all kind of crazy stuffs! then I recommend this movie, but if you want a GOOD film quality then this is NOT for you.

The reason that this movie wasn't so good is because of the soundtrack which didn't fit with the movie. The background music is always slow instrumental jazz, I don't hate jazz but it just didn't fit with the cool moves of the surfers (specially with the moves in slow-motion). Also, the color quality of the film is kind of annoying at times, and there isn't to much action as Surf Crazy.

I know that this is the first Bruce Brown film, in the intro he explain that he didn't had to much budget to make this movie better. But at least, the film was successfuly enought to make another movie with better soundtrack, editing and action (Surf Crazy).

Warning: Most of theses documentaries are silent, so you won't hear the character's voices but you will hear Bruce Brown narrating. Bruce Brown is not SOO good in narration but he is not the worst.

P.S: I also know that Bruce Brown's masterpiece is Endless Summer (1967), but I only want to know how cool and rocking the 50's were.

Adios.",1240876800,3,1187,4.401826484018265
7897940,3,6305871124,I think this movie was pretty good for a guy of 20 Bruce Brown his first film and only $5000 to get it done good on you well done.,1233878400,2,130,3.5172413793103448
7897941,2,6305871124,"If you love surfing and the beaches of Hawaii, then go ahead and get this. The filming and surfing footage is actually pretty decent considering this is Brown's first movie. However, be warned that the narrative is the lamest, most unprofessional, amaturish, pitiful attempt to pull the visuals together into some semblence of a plot.  It fails miserably.  You'd be better off doing your own narrative.  Better yet - just mute the sound and watch, because Brown's narration is simply an annoying distraction. Why he didn't invest some time in scripting a decent narration is confounding. It would have made the film immenently more interesting.  What's worse, is that Brown's updated introduction and intermission interviews are no better than when he narrated the original film.  The man essentially has NO verbal talent - zip, zilch, nil.  He's incapable intelligent elocution of any kind or of even being able to pretend to ""act"" for the interviews. Get this film for the visuals ONLY.",1207440000,,988,5.067901234567901
7897942,5,6305871124,I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 8.  My dad was big into Bruce Brown stuff and out of the 7ish movies of his that we had this one was by far the best.,971913600,12,170,3.358974358974359
