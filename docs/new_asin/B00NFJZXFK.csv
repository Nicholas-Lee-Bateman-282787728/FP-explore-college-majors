6648177,5,B00NFJZXFK,"I had seen this movie on UPTV and fell in love with it and the actors. I would keep searching the channel to watch it whenever it came on. Once I saw that it was available on amazon I had to order it and have really enjoyed watching it over and over..it tells 2 love stories which are each unique and ends on a high note!! The music was both moving and enjoyable,a must see for everybody",1419638400,14,387,4.038961038961039
6648178,2,B00NFJZXFK,"Reading the synopsis I thought this would be a great story. I even bought the titled song from the soundtrack. There was so much lacking from this movie that I had to go back twice to rewatch it because the plot was so unbelievable. He propositions her to meet him at a hotel. She scoffs at him yet there is something that is so intriguing about her that he tracks her down and offers to take her out to lunch. Not so bad right? From there the story spirals out of control. Eventually they make it back to her apartment where she plays a song that she wrote. Then he says that he knows people in the entertainment industry and will help get her noticed. Which leads them into her bed, but she discovers that he was the man responsible for her losing her job. I would explain more but I have become exhausted just thinking of what to say next.",1419379200,4,842,4.236024844720497
6648179,5,B00NFJZXFK,"Great film! A very believable and moving cross-cultural love story that pulled me in right away. Lead actress Nicole Beharie (""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""42,"" ""Shame"") is a rare and amazing talent. Here she not only brings her acting chops, but also her singing. The five songs she sings on camera blew me away. The other lead - German leading man/heartthrob Ken Duken (""Inglorious Bastards,"" ""Max Manus"") - also delivers a great performance. So do Reg E Cathey (""House of Cards"") and Marlene Forte in the other sweet love story. Finally, I found the limo driver, Laith Nakli (""Arranged""), added just the right amount of humor. See this film! Also, you may want to check out writer/director Stefan Schaefer's other great film ""Arranged.""",1414627200,36,727,5.016528925619835

6648185,5,B00NFJZXFK,"This is a story of faith.  Faith, in the goodness of people.  Faith, that the universe, through God, will meter out justice in His due time.

And please . . . don't get me started on the music.  Ahh!!!  [Disclosure:  I am a huge fan of Nicole Beharie, the leading lady of this piece, from her role in the television series, Sleepy Hollow.

6648187,5,B00NFJZXFK,This movie was wonderful and the presentation of the singer losing her memory and finding her adult son are both painful and uplifting. Watching the characters develop into caring people is inspirational.,1475971200,,204,5.40625

6648196,4,B00NFJZXFK,"Raw, real...kinda...it is a romantic comedy after all. But it is romantic...VERY!  Reminds me a little of ""Something New"" w/Simon Baker and Sanaa Lathan. I like seeing two folks from different worlds finding each other in the most unusual circumstances and really taking the time to be conscious of the moment.  That kind of living takes real courage. Many of us, perhaps most of us, miss so many cues in life, that even if love, true love was right in front of us...well we can forget that cause most of us have our smartphones in front of us most of the time. The talented Nicole Beharie is a delight. Ken Duken, is wonderfully cast as the guy smitten by surprise by love, on one of the worst days of his life. Wonderful supporting cast and some good tunes from Ms. Beharie. Good flick.",1465257600,,788,4.503496503496503
6648197,1,B00NFJZXFK,"This movie was total garbage that made me sick to my stomach.  This was total diva trash, first she disrespects her father, then curses while up at the pulpit and disrespects her father who is the pastor of the church in front of everyone!  Then after the guy tries to tell her what he was in the US for she shut's him up, and then after finding out the truth she grabs his shoe and phone and throws them into the river, then plays the guy that wants her by telling him to drop the white guy off in a bad neighborhood and beat him up!!!  To top all this off, the white guy still wants her so he offers her a chance at a record deal overseas, but she turns it down and tells him to lose his big time job to stay with her broke behind!  And he did it!  The ONLY folks STUPID enough to write or direct something so pathetic would be either a feminist or a an overseas white man that worships black women!  The ONLY thing she did in this entire movie noteworthy was bless her fathers marriage, and truth be known as a man he didn't need it!  Also honestly the music was tight, but as you can see music doesn't sway my opinions on foul angry acting black women and this is coming from a black man...Peace",1465257600,,1199,4.076595744680851

6648200,4,B00NFJZXFK,The story had some holes in it and it left some things hanging. But it  was still enjoyable.,1464825600,,92,4.111111111111111
6648201,5,B00NFJZXFK,"If you enjoyed ""Something New"" with Sanaa Lathan then you will love this movie! A modern day love story, if you think love at first sight doesn't happen in movie nowadays, you're wrong.

Tisha a Brooklyn girl just got a new job and moved into her new space. An inspiring singer and songwriter with a beautiful smile.

Niklas a successful German executive sent to the United States to hand out pink slips to over 300 employees.

They meet at a coffee shop. Niklas is attracted to Tisha, he ends up tracking her down and falling in love.

Spoiler beyond this point ..

Tisha kinda lost her mind when she told Niklas to quit his job and become unemployed with her??!?! Instead of traveling Europe with him and making a career in music overseas. What was she thinking? She is jobless, no kids and struggling with her music career?

Good movie regardless!",1463702400,2,850,4.596026490066225

6648226,4,B00NFJZXFK,"Although this movie was a little rushed, it was very sweet.  Nicole Beharie is excellent as usual.  It's refreshing to see an interracial relationship that ends on a note of sweetness instead of the usual tragedy you see in most movies when the female love interest is of color.  Nicole wrote and performed some of the songs in the movie and they are soul moving beauties.  Overall, this movie left me feeling on an upbeat.",1455840000,,423,4.6
6648227,5,B00NFJZXFK,Really enjoyed this movie. It was a little low budget but actually pleasantly engaging and Nicole was quite good. Her costar was a little wooden but it was a nice love story.,1455753600,,174,4.46875

6648259,1,B00NFJZXFK,This movie is disappointing on so many levels. I'll start with the screenplay. Really? A black woman meets a strange white man and takes him home the same day? Only the black women walking the streets do that. Most black women I know would be wondering if he was a serial killer. A black woman chooses a Caucasian man over a brother? Really? Ok won't even go there. How about the total lack of chemistry between the actors? Then the father decides to propose to a woman he hasn't dated once? No other sisters in the church. I have seen a lot of ridiculous movies in my 49 years but this on my list of top 5.,1454371200,,607,4.196581196581197

6648264,5,B00NFJZXFK,VERY NICE MOVIE. THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS IS ON POINT AND  IT'S A NICE SWITCH UP FROM YOUR A TYPICAL LOVE STORY.

6648290,5,B00NFJZXFK,"Good movie, great acting, great writing and directing.  The actors were really convincing in that I forgot they were acting (especially Nicole).  I really appreciate the true reflection of the nature of people in Brooklyn vs the negativity that's portrayed in the media, music videos, etc; this is the Brooklyn experience over 90% of the time.  If you think some of this is unrealistic, it's not.  From the driver sticking his nose in the Nicholas' business (has happened to me on multiple occasions), Darryl driving around the (aimlessly) all day, widow and widower getting married for companionship, secretary by day with an artistic alter ego - I've seen it all 1st hand.
I wish movies like this made it into the major award nominations.  Most of my life and time is spent in the left brain world, so I don't know the titles for the folks that execute the script to make it flow, but to all of the contributors, kudos!
This movie is also a BEAUTIFUL reminder that the lines that separate us really are just ""holograms"" rather than actual barriers.  Humans are built to connect.  When there's a true connection with someone, nothing

6648308,4,B00NFJZXFK,"I picked this movie because it starred Nicole Beharie, of Sleepy Hollow.  What a sweet little film.  The premise is simple:  Ticia is an aspiring singer/songwriter whose day job in an office ends when an executive from the company's German headquarters closes the department and lays her off.  She happened to meet him that morning before work, and gave him her CD and an invitation to hear her sing that night.  Intrigued, he tracks her down and they spend the day together, but she doesn't know he's the reason she's now unemployed.  Add to the mix her widowed father who is a minister in an inner city church, and you've got one angry young woman. It really hit home the way Ticia was trying to work hard and do everything right, believed in God, was a good Christian girl, but couldn't seem to catch a break.  (It's the first movie I've seen in a long time where the characters were authentically Christian, but the movie was not a ""Christian film"" (like Fireproof), and they weren't simple-minded caricatures.  It was just who she was, and it felt very real.)

The executive, Niklas, sometimes comes across as cold, but that is because it is his job to crush people (think George Clooney in Up In The Air).  Like, he flies in, says, I'm sorry, you're all unemployed now, here's what your severance looks like, and then flies back to Germany.  Over the course of the film, though, your expectations that he's just a jerk get subverted, mainly because of the crazy chemistry between the two actors.

I give it four stars because it's a quiet movie -- there's no Great Big Problem to be resolved.  But it works, and I ""got"" every character, even the minor ones.  And the music is wonderful. Beharie performs several songs that you'll want to go out and find.

I recommend this film to anyone. There's no nudity, very little swearing, and it's not full of stereotypes or preachy.  As I said, a sweet little movie.",1448323200,3,1914,4.601769911504425

6648322,3,B00NFJZXFK,"The good: Nicole Behari is one of my favorite underated actresses. She played her role well, and showed music talent that I didn't know she had. The actor who played her father played his role well also. The bad: the plot was totally uncreative and predictable. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl falls in love. Circumstances almost drive them apart. Just in the nick of time it all works out. I also didn't like that the movie seemed like it wanted to be a drama and a comedy at the same time, but didn't do a good job of doing either. The only thing that was a bit unique was that the woman was black and the man was white instead of the opposite. Overall, the movie was okay. Nothing special.",1446940800,,700,4.2706766917293235

6648402,5,B00NFJZXFK,"Loved this movie and characters, especially the two main actors. Nicole Beharie was beautiful, soulful, and talented. I do believe that I also fell in love with her. She is a treasure and an obvious budding star. I often watch foreign independent films, full of deep thoughtful meaning. Only to find myself scratching my head halfway through these films. This film had a simple, yet powerful message. Have the courage to follow your heart and to look at others as human beings, not as different races, or religions. Great chemistry between the leading actors, great music, and the great backdrop of the real NYC. Check this one out!!!!",1439942400,8,635,4.888888888888889

6648426,4,B00NFJZXFK,"Not your typical romance. If you can't stand movies like The Notebook, then you'll like this movie. It's more real, and shows that everything isn't always perfect including love. The acting was great. It was a nice change, especially considering that television doesn't tend to want to show multiethnic relationships. They especially don't want to portray positive relationships between White men and African American females. However, many do exist. I know, as I'm married to such a woman, that those positive relationships exist more than Hollywood would like to admit. Keep the realness coming.",1438214400,18,597,5.361702127659575

6648431,3,B00NFJZXFK,"The premise here is sweet, and the movie sounded like it might be a fairly standard, if interracial (and international), rom-com. Still, I watched it because I've seen and liked some of Nicole Beharie's other work (American Violet, 42, Sleepy Hollow). The movie was a bit corny but wasn't as cliche or saccharine as I thought it might be; there were some amusing moments in the secondary storylines and characters; and Beharie's singing was a pleasant surprise. In the end, though, I couldn't quite suspend my disbelief that Beharie's character, Leticia, would not be more suspicious of a man who just shows up in her father's Brooklyn church after he's met and propositioned her (and been shut down) in Manhattan. But she goes to lunch with him and then invites him up to her apartment without even knowing his full name. It doesn't seem to be love at first sight for her, so even with the set-up that Leticia's day has taken an unexpected and bad turn, her actions seemed inconsistent with how the character had been sketched to that point. And I had a similar issue with Duken's character getting into a car with Leticia's ex-boyfriend. Having now read in other reviews that the story is based on the real-life romance of one of the movie's writer/producers, I'd be interested to know how much they deviated from and augmented actual events. The movie is pleasant enough, but I could never get past the idea that all of it was supposed to happen within 24 hrs.",1437523200,,1463,4.71875

The plot is simple and has all the elements of the classic Hollywood romance: Cold, cynical boy meets free-spirited, optimistic girl. Boy and girl make a connection. Boy has a secret. What will happen when girl finds out? I'll admit that like 98% of romantic comedy-dramas, the plot and outcome are pretty predictable, but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable.
Nicole Beharie owns her role and definitely surprised me with her singing talents. The other lead, Ken Duken, is soft-spoken, but is a solid and believable leading man. The supporting cast is equally good.",1433721600,,731,4.809523809523809

6648504,3,B00NFJZXFK,"While the premise of this movie seemed nice, it didn't quite deliver for me. The idea behind the movie is that a German record company executive is sent to New York to shut down a branch for financial reasons. Upon his arrival, he has a chance meeting with an aspiring singer who was just hired by the company. They end up striking up a friendship that inevitably goes through trouble when she discovers who he is. There is a side story with the girl's father who is the pastor of church and a widower. Most of the elements of the movie have been done elsewhere. This one has the potential to be decent, but it seems like there isn't enough buildup. The couple gets together too quickly to be believable and there isn't a lot of chemistry between them. The movie tends to be more talk than action which may not help the plot much either. The one bright spot is that most of the actors play interesting characters and do a good job with their parts. This was enough to keep me interested in the movie but in the end, I was disappointed at the missed chances. A little better buildup to the romantic relationships would have helped smooth the plot some and make the movie more engaging.",1432684800,,1184,4.410958904109589

Last, I read a review of this film in which a person said they liked the movie but didn't believe they would really end up together.  Well, this reviewer is a red-headed, blue-eyed, white-skinned, American of German-Irish roots who just so happens to be married to a beautiful dark-skinned Indian woman.

6648660,2,B00NFJZXFK,"This film tests the limits of patience. Nicole Baharie plays Leticia Johnson a stubborn, headstrong aspiring singer who works at a Wall Street firm. Ken Duken plays Niklas, a German man who is in New York for one day, having been sent by his corporate superiors to  lay off all the employee's in Leticia's office. A chance meeting leads the two to spend the day together. Many people find this romance charming but I found it annoyingly frustrating. Leticia is about as unyielding a character as I've encountered in films in this genre. The entire film is composed of Niklas doing everything he can to win her over and Leticia railing against everyone from her pastor father (in church, no less, though saying that she is a Christian), to Niklas and everyone else in her path. Though the two leads have some chemistry, I cannot for the life of me imagine that these two characters would make a realistic couple, based solely on their personalities. Throw in an annoying car driver and I found myself rooting against them. An unfortunate side effect of writer/director Stephan Schaefer's heavy handed yet ill conceived plot.",1425600000,2,1123,4.848958333333333

6648684,4,B00NFJZXFK,"Not a complex movie, but entertaining with credible acting. The moral compass issues thrown in were, to my view, appropriate vs preachy and balanced with a nice dash of skepticism, not to mention feminism and chivalry. I loved the setting (for being the NY I know vs a glamorized set) and the diverse cast of characters. I love that I ""know"" those people: that the film captured the reality of a community vs the stereotype of what an inner city community might be.",1424390400,14,465,4.614457831325301

6648689,4,B00NFJZXFK,"Niklas, a German businessman arrives in New York for a one day visit to lay off an entire division of his company.  By chance Niklas, stops at a coffee shop. There he meets Leticia, a promising singer and secretary who works for his company. Leticia notices the emotion revealed in Niklas' eyes as he contemplates his mission.  She teases him and gives him a CD of her songs. The CD includes an invitation to her show later that night. At the time, Niklas is not interested.  Niklas spots Leticia a second time after he completes his task and propositions her. She rebuffs his proposition but agrees to have lunch with him instead. They spend the day together.  Niklas  attempts to forget his unpleasant deed during their outing. His main focus now is to seduce Leticia. With each rejection, Niklas' attraction to Leticia piques and he ups the stakes. Leticia finds out Niklas' identify and ditches him. Niklas begins to rethink his mission and purpose. I like the soundtrack in this movie and the way the camera focuses on Niklas' eyes. You see sadness as he contemplates firing people and also desire as he eyes Leticia. The love story between Leticia's dad, a widower and his secretary is charming and realistic.",1424044800,4,1215,4.766666666666667

It was 3 stars until she impulsively took his shoe and wallet and threw them in the street, leaving him stranded or to do who's knows what in her apartment, as she goes on her merry way to have another ""life's so unfair to good people like me"" rant at her dad somewhere across town.  Seriously?  I know what she found out about Nick makes him look real shady but her character seems hardly more mature.  I might not finish watching because I tend to stop caring about characters who annoy me.

8677728,5,B00NFJZXFK,"There are actually two love stories here: the guy with the $$ who is poor in heart, who can give a really brilliant singer/songwriter the contacts and boost to European markets that will give her the emotionally rich career she deserves, while they both enrich their hearts; and the older couple who are embracing love for the 2nd time after loss, whose lives will also be enriched.  I LOVE the Muslim hired car driver; comic relief and sage advice for the two young and prideful folks.  Spoiler Alert:  Nicholas will stay for a bit for some vacation in NYC and say No to his boss for once, and the singer gets her chance.  The acting is nuanced: Nick being vulnerable and the Tisha being tough but like a real person, not the overacted ""tough black woman.""  Every role was so well-done, with the weakest link being the jerk from the 'hood in the fancy white car.

I found this after being mesmerized by The Sinking of the Laconia.  My question: with all his film credits, does he ever get to be clean-shaven??  What a hottie.",1500508800,,1026,4.508108108108108
