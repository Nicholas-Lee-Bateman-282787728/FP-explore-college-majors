8170630,5,B000MQ5520,"The description of Kurosawa meets Python was very apt.

I thought the story was excelent.  The acting was a bit hammed but it fit with the story line perfectly.  It was both entertaining and moving at the same time.  And the castle was handsome.

It was wonderful choice for a lazy summer evening video.",1338163200,,303,4.537037037037037
8170631,3,B000MQ5520,"This may not have the production finesse of other Japanese features, but the concept is impressive: a curse somehow sparks a local movement to build a Japanese fortress. Except that there aren't any materials for the construction, which means the ""shogun"" has to make the castle out of corrugated cardboard. The special features of the DVD offer modest background into the plot and actors who contributed to the project. Largely it's largely entertaining, though the low budget of the production stymied its spirit of ambition, and the filmmaking is basic, at best. Then again, most films lack the conceptual cleverness of Raise the Castle, and the performances are uniformly strong throughout.",1287014400,2,694,5.261261261261262
