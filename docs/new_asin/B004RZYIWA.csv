8439435,3,B004RZYIWA,"This is the 5th volume of the original, French made Maigret series, starring Bruno Cremer (who passed away last year), the best Maigret actor in my opinion.
I bought all 5 volumes from the French branch of Amazon, and I have had excellent entertainment viewing these through the recent, cold winter months.
The DVDs have only the original French speech, with English subtitles from the menu. This is the case for volumes 1 thru 4. However, in volume 5, only the 2 first films have subtitles, the remaining French speech only. This is fine if your French is good. This is the reason I only give 3 out of 5 stars.
(If it is the case that my copy of volume 5 is different from other issues (regarding subtitling), I would appreciate to receive a feedback on this).
If you like Maigret, and your Frech is fluent, I have no reservations in recommending this volume. Generally, I would recommend you buy all 5 volumes.",1300320000,10,912,4.567073170731708
