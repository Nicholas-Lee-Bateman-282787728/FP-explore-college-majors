This is so true. His portrayal of Rodolfo is brilliant. I don't want to give away the ending, but his final scenes are so real, so believable, and the intense emotion he is feeling pulls at your heart strings. I have never really been an opera fan before, but Alfie Boe has broadened my horizons. La Boheme is a very famous opera, and this version is special because it has Alfie Boe in it. I usually sing his praises because of his beautiful voice and his charm & wonderful personality. His performance in this play, along with his amazing performance as Jean Valjean in the Les Miserables 25th Anniversary Concert DVD, show that he is also a gifted actor. If you're an Alfie Boe fan, you HAVE to buy this DVD!",1302307200,18,919,4.75
888617,4,6304469527,An Outstanding performance of a well known opera.  Vocal performers were marvelous.  I can recommend it with out reservations.  ENJOY!,1294444800,8,134,5.6
888618,5,6304469527,"Note: I saw this on TV, and missed Act I.  My comments apply to acts II-IV.  If you are familiar with the Met's production by Zefferelli, the staging here is similar, but in some ways superior: act II is less crowded, and the horseplay in the beginning of act IV comes off as more spontaneous. It's a good naturalistic production.

Pavarotti is in fine voice.  The rest of the cast were unfamiliar to me, but uniformly good.  Musetta and Mimi, in particular, brought not only blemishless singing, but acting a cut above what one normally sees.  This is one of the first Mimis I've ever seen  who actually looks ill. She also showed the complexities of Mimi's emotions in act three, when she is facing the failure of her relationship with Rodolfo. Pavarotti was never a *great* actor, but he has his moments. There are more than a few in this film.

I haven't seen the Freni-Pavarotti film, so I can't compare.  The wise thing would probably be to get both.",1136073600,2,956,4.543859649122807
888619,4,6304469527,"Since we don't have an opera house in our city, I am thrilled to see any production of Puccini's operas.  The music is so beautiful, it makes up for any other disapointments.  If it weren't for the subtitles, I wouldn't know  the story.  I loved it.",957744000,6,249,4.3478260869565215
888620,5,6304469527,"Lucciano Pavarotti and Fiamma Izo Dmico are my favorites Rodolfo and Mimi. In act 1 their voice awaken all your senses at once, you are transformed for a time to a better place. I highly recommend this video to  anyone who wants to be overwhelmed with wonderful feelings.",933984000,11,271,4.645833333333333
888621,1,6304469527,"Operas are meant to be heard primarily in theatres, especially Scalla, with live big  performances.  In front of your small TV this video seems contrived because the wonderful arias are added out of sync.  If you want  to remain a La Boheme and Pavaroti fan, just listen with your eyes closed,  or buy the CD.  The English subtitles made a soap opera out of Puccini's  masterpiece.  If he were alive and watching, he would die.",915494400,18,427,4.6

888747,5,6304469527,Alfie Boe at his best.  The orchestra at times was a bit overpowering.  A very convincing and heartfelt performance by all. Thank you ENO.,1373500800,,138,4.708333333333333

888749,5,6304469527,This presentation shows just how much fun and tragedy there can be in an opera. I especially like Alfie Boe's Rodolfo. I differ in opinion with some of the translation but it is sung so beautifully that I will have to forgive that. A great introduction to those who may be afraid that it is beyond their scope.,1360368000,2,310,4.362068965517241
888750,2,6304469527,"I bought because I love La Boheme and I love Alfie Boe.  But Mimi does not once look him in the face during the entire production.  She looks away from him the entire time!!!  Come on, it's not like Alfie's hard on the eyes or anything.  I just could not get over how totally unconnected she was from the role.  Totally ruined it for me.",1354752000,,337,4.123076923076923
888751,1,6304469527,When brains were passed out I was in line behind an ox. Just assumed that the reason this was listed as Puccini's La Boheme was that it was Puccini's La Boheme. Wrong. This turkey is sung in English. That's right English. It's not La Boheme but The Bohemians. I have no desire to hear an opera sung in any language other that the one is was composed for. Not snobbery; the sound of the words are matched to the music and it's ruined unless it's sung in the language it was written for. Amazon might have been willing to refund my purchase but I don't penalize others for my mistakes. Besides mere money couldn't have replaced the sheer satisfaction I got from taking my pliers and other tools and reducing both the disk and the container it came in to small pieces which now reside in my trash can. The purpose of my review is to warn the unwary buyer of the deliberate fraud and desecration. I spent 30 seconds listening to this and I want those 30 seconds back.,1354406400,5,963,4.355555555555555
888752,5,6304469527,"In this time of opera history when every standard in the repertoire is transplanted to a different era with strange gimmicky costumes and sets, attempts to make the opera more relevant to our times, some stage designers and director pay attention to the music and et their updating' statements actually enhance the production.  Such is the case with this Jonathan Miller and Isabella Bywater rethinking of that evergreen LA BOHEME. It is simply moving the time frame a few years forward, but making it during the Depression is quite in keeping with living spaces and costumes and overall atmosphere of the bohemian artists for whom Puccini wrote this homage to art.

The English National Opera chorus and orchestra are conducted with youthful aplomb by Miguel Bedoya-Harth and the cast is rich in attractive, very fine singers who know how to act.  All are credible with Britain's favorite tenor Alfie Boe singing a splendid Rodolfo and partnered with the equally effective Mimi of Melody Moore, an American soprano who is gaining more attention on distant shores than at home. Hanan Alattar delivers a sprightly and bratty Musetta, while Roland Wood makes Marcello memorable.  Paul Punit as Colline and David Stout as Schaunard round out the main characters.

The sound on the DVD is exceptional and the actual filming of the work is sensitive to the story and the characters.  This is a solid LA BOHEME, one that is easy on the eyes s well as pleasing to the ears.  And Bedoya-Harth proves that opera is in his blood!  Grady Harp, July 12",1342396800,4,1540,4.873563218390805
888753,4,6304469527,"This ENO production is sung in English. Since I have watched many Boheme's, all in Italian, it took me some time to get accustomed to the English, but then it sounded quite natural. This Blu-Ray could be used to introduce opera to a skeptic! The production is transposed to 1930 during the Big Depression in Paris. It fits the plot and essence of the plot very well. With the lighting such that all the action seems to be in almost Black & White, it is very realistic and effective. The staging and the filming are first class. The singing is very good, but not exceptional. The star of the production is Alfie Boe as Rodolfo. Is acting, demeanor and singing is pleasant and fits the role. The rest of the singers are good. Melody Moore as Mimi is not totally convincing, the pianissimos are not there. Kultur seems to make every effort to let us know as little as possible about the production, the artists or even the date the concert was taped. It is an enjoyable production, the ending will cause some tears to flow...",1312848000,5,1022,4.5
888754,5,6304469527,"This is a gorgeous production, with marvelous singing, direction, sets and libretti. Alfie Boe's acting is deeply authentic and he shows a range of feelings which ring true.  Despite his youth, or perhaps partly because of it, there's something which he brings to the role of Rudolfo which is quite beyond Pavarotti's version. His expressions of excitement, nervousness, pride, delight, love, tenderness, frustration and grief reveal a fine acting ability in addition to his breathtaking singing. This is a stellar performance all around.",1308182400,11,538,5.481927710843373
888755,4,6304469527,"This English National Opera Prodection of Boheme is not the best I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the worst. I purchased it mainly out of  curiosity to see what Alfie Boe could do with traditional opera, and the answer is . . . ""quite a bit.""  I still find English translations somewhat off-putting--but I can see the purpose.  If making it accessible to more music lovers grows the opera audience, it can only be good. Having grown up with an Italian Boheme,I did occasionally wish for the liquid vowels.  That said, I found the technical production to be very good and Mr. Boe is indeed a force to reckon with.  His connection to his audience is nothing short of stunning.  Would I buy the disc again?  Absolutely! But the Met and Stratas/Carreras are still the benchmark production for me.",1305504000,8,798,4.6571428571428575
