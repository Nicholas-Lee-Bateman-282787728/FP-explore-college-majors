5071678,1,B007AFCRYA,"I love cutesy movies.  I am a Catholic.  I like these actors BUT, WOW, what a pointless movie!  I kept waiting for it to get going beyond the slow start- up until I noticed that there was only 20 minutes left.  There was no build up, no climax, no point and no entertainment.  WHY did I watch it all?  Because I kept waiting for something to come together.  It never came together nor was the end even somewhat understandable.  I am still surprised that there could be that whole 90 minutes without some reason  for the story.  An amazing waster of time even for Hallmark Movie fans who settle for mediocrity because of a guaranteed ""Happy Ending.""  By-the-way, the 'Ending' of this movie was neither happy nor sad nor coherent.",1425168000,,728,4.523076923076923
5071679,2,B007AFCRYA,I quit watching after 30 minutes.  It was very very boring.  Didn't look like it was going anywhere.,1424822400,,100,4.5
5071680,2,B007AFCRYA,"Mirren and Conti are both excellent, but I had to turn on subtitles to follow the dialog, as some of the accents were so strong.  Storyline dragged, and I fell asleep twice watching this.  I like miracles, too, but this was not directed, filmed, cut or edited well.  Good soporific, if you need one.",1422921600,,299,4.5

5071683,4,B007AFCRYA,"The first time I watched this film, I just couldn't get into it. I watched the movie while sorting papers. I depended on the audio to catch my attention and move my eyes over to the screen.

I concluded that I was glad that I didn't pay to watch the film.

I gave it 2 stars because the premise was there, but just not presented in a way to catch my interest.

However, I did give the film an extra chance, and while I can't give it five stars, it is better than I gave it credit for before.

Miracles seem to befuddle our protagonist, and he doesn't want them. He'd rather do things his way.

Do give this film a try. Maybe it's better than either of us gave it credit for.

I will give this film another try later.

5071684,4,B007AFCRYA,"Here's a movie that captivates you while you're watching, leaves you with a sense of complete satisfaction, and beckons you to return again. The subject is miracles - or rather whether miracles are real or just coincidences enhanced by wishful thinking. Tom Conti plays Vic Mathews, a teacher at the Blessed Edith Semple School in Glasgow, Scotland, whose faculty and community are looking for a miracle to confirm that their namesake has achieved sainthood and should be canonized by the Catholic Church. That miracle seems to arrive when Vic tries to save the life of a careless student. Jumping across a wide gap between two rooftops, he survives a fall of some 40 feet suffering only cuts and bruises. But Vic, who's an agnostic, doesn't want the miracle-man distinction. He'd rather achieve miraculous progress with his troubled students the old-fashioned way - by working hard at it. And he'd like to romance the school's pretty music teacher, Ruth Chancellor (the great Helen Mirren). So he grows angrier and more confused when additional unexplained events seem to find him, including what seems to be a genuine miracle. As Vic, Conti gives the best performance of his career, although I've never seen such a laconic protagonist. It's as though Vic decided to proceed through life in a permanently blissed-out state, and life has obliged him by doing no harm. Conti's facial expressions after Vic's brushes with mortality, and immortality, are priceless. The fine cast includes Jennifer Black of Local Hero and David Hayman of Hope and Glory - two other favorites. Would love to see a DVD or Blu-ray version for the U.S.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1378512000,6,1879,5.6431095406360425
5071685,4,B007AFCRYA,"This DELIGHTFUL film (originally released as ""The Gospel According to Vic"") is a rewarding watch, featuring a very affable Tom Conti at the peak of his career.  Conti plays a dedicated Scottish teacher and religious skeptic working at a parochial school.  The rest of the ensemble is very good, including Helen Mirren as eye-candy (and a bit more).  The musical sound track is original and upbeat.  You needn't be C of E (or Catholic) to enjoy this movie.",1374537600,,455,4.794871794871795
5071688,3,B007AFCRYA,"Very cute romantic feel good movie.  It's teacher's trying to do the right thing.  I enjoyed it, but it wasn't fabulous.  Love Helen Mirren.",1457308800,,140,4.75
5071689,4,B007AFCRYA,"It was pleasant enough.  However, the script was ridiculous. The one question I always had was why was an atheist working on a Catholic school?  That said the actors acquitted them selves very well and almost overcame the incongruities of the premise.",1455580800,,251,4.9523809523809526

5071695,4,B007AFCRYA,"Nicely done movie about things which can be seen more than one way.  Quiet, intelligent performances.",1427760000,,101,5.3125
5071696,1,B007AFCRYA,"This movie is a waste of time. The actors are all very good but the plot is so full of holes that it is impossible to be certain what exactly is going on. There are events in the film that make no sense and are suddenly referenced thirty minutes later in a way that makes you wish there had been more information given at some prior point. Add to that the purely gratuitous sexual references and obscenities and you have what seems like the kind of movie fifteen year olds would make with their cell phones if there parents were great actors willing to perform in a completely pointless and juvenile film.

We kept thinking at some point it would all make sense and redeem itself, it never does. The ending is completely anticlimactic. We just sat there saying, ""that's the end?"" I'm giving it one star because there appears no way to rate a film as being worth zero stars.",1427500800,,873,4.422360248447205
