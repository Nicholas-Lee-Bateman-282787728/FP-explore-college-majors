8189335,1,B000P6R5PW,Very disappointed with this documentary. Slow and hard to follow. I ended up donating this. In my opinion it wasn't put together well and lacked a loy of information of many Native tribes. I do love History Channel docs but they let this one slip. I couldn't recommend this to a friend.,1521936000,,286,4.519230769230769

8189337,3,B000P6R5PW,"it's ok.
I was dissapointed because it only discussed the Cherokee out west and the Lumby tribe in the south, I am sure other tribes in other states were instrumental in the battles, I am Blackfoot-cherokee.",1386115200,,207,4.777777777777778
8189338,4,B000P6R5PW,unsure - bought for a Christmas gift. I think my friend will like it because he is very interested in the Civil War and this is not a topic normally discussed.,1353715200,,159,4.161290322580645
8189339,5,B000P6R5PW,"This DVD would be an excellent teaching tool in the classroom to give students an understanding of the Civil War in Indian Territory, and in the Carolinas. The history of the war in the Nations is virtually unknown to most people, even many historians. As a direct descendant of a Chickasaw Confederate cavalry officer, I have long held a great interest in the Civil War in Oklahoma. My great, great grandfather, Colbert Ashalatubby Burris, was a captain in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Mounted Rifles. He fought in engagements at the Battle of Honey Springs and Middle Boggy for control of the Texas Road. C.A. Burris was stationed at Fort Washita near Durant, Oklahoma during the war. It was a former Federal fort built during the 1840's to protect the Chickasaws and Choctaws from the Comanches and Kiowa Apaches. When the war started in 1861, the Federals decided that they were in too precarious a situation near the Texas border, so they pulled up stakes and ran to Kansas. Albert Pike and a delegation of confederates then came into the Nations and told the Chickasaws and Choctaws that the Confederacy would protect us from the plains tribes and continue our treaty annuity payments promised by the Federal government if we would join them in their fight against the Union, none of which ever actually occured after we joined the Confederates. My great, great grandfather was a Chickasaw delegate to the 1861 meeting of the Five Tribes at Old North Fork Town, (Eufaula, Oklahoma), and joined in the treaty with the Confederate States of America, frequently referred to as the Albert Pike Treaty. He was also the Chickasaw delegate to the Fort Smith Council of 1865, and the Treaty of 1866, which required us to free our slaves, give up the Leased District, (southwest Oklahoma), and allow railroad access through our Nation. Many people do not realize that Oklahoma had over 100 different battles on its land during the Civil War. This DVD teaches much valuable history of the war in Indian Territory. Plus, many of my friends and fellow Civil War reenactors are in this DVD.",1352851200,4,2080,4.861971830985915
8189340,5,B000P6R5PW,"As a supporter of Native Americans and their plight from the English invasion of their lands, I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD even though at times it made me cry.  There is also one on the role Native Americans played in the Civil War and it too is an eye opener.  The Native Americans in this country are not celebrated as other nationalities or minority groups are and it is a terrible injustice to them.  We need a Native American month so we can have a complete historical education.  This DVD belongs in the class room!",1306454400,10,522,4.463157894736842

8189342,5,B000P6R5PW,"The History Channel's Indian Warriors is a good and valuable DVD. Although it concentrates on the Civil War era, there is much good material on the Trail of Tears etc. It is a story not often told and will go far in explanning the Indian position during the Civil War, at least of the Cherokees. The other tribes out west out not mentioned though all the five civilized tribes signed on with the Confederacy. For a valuable picture get this video.",1194220800,26,447,4.530864197530864
