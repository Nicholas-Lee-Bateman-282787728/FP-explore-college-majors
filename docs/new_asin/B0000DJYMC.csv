8001227,2,B0000DJYMC,"I was excited to get this DVD and see footage of William. S. Burroughs. Well now I have more than enough clips of the brilliant writer, but that's about it. Not really a biography. Not really a movie. Just some cool footage that would go well in the background at a party where the abstract musical musings of the band Anamorphosis are improvising live, and you watch Burroughs cut ups while trying to slide closer to the cute girl dressed as a Japanese anime character...before passing out from too much faux absinthe a guy dressed as Hunter. S.Thompson gave you at the door of the same guys living room.

Good footage. No content.",1171324800,2,632,4.592920353982301
8001228,3,B0000DJYMC,"Few authors have ever been as adept at oratory with their own writings as Burroughs was, so any record of him reading his work is worth seeing. This also includes some interesting interview segments. It looks cheaply shot, and I could've lived without all the psychedelic effects that the filmmakers put behind Burroughs while he reads; the man is fascinating to listen to and watch, so that stuff is just a distraction. Nonetheless, worth seeing for fans.",1138320000,4,456,4.935064935064935
8001229,5,B0000DJYMC,"I saw this video in 1994 as a fledgling WSB fan and quickly became a loyal reader of all his books and, have been seeking out other cameo performances  ever since by one of the most influential sub-culture writers of all time.  This video provides us with the brilliant insights of a reasonable, highly  logical individual who just happens to have the genuine, but obscure talent  to make us realize some of the undesireable - and sometimes unfathomable  truths of life in the modern world. The mono-tonal voice of cynical  eloquence is captured in this video, along with rapturous images of the  artist work on canvas. The ""fireside chat"" style of the  interview, paired with dubiously positioned questions on life, death, and  consciousness are cleverly interlaced in between readings of some of WSB's  finest excerpts. As a relatively new, but life-long WSB afficionado, I  highly suggest this video to start off your wonderous journey into the mind  of an incredibly gifted, off-kilter literary phenomenoh.",940896000,18,1010,5.091463414634147
