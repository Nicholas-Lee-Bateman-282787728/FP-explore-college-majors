7308964,5,B010CVV07S,"Beyond the Boundary is a great Anime, and is worth owning. The english dub's actings good, though Mirai Kuriyama has a very high voice in that version. I prefer the Sub for her. This anime is sweet and short, and has a happy ending. While there is a movie that continues the story(not included) its not needed...

7308965,5,B010CVV07S,"Really, thoroughly satisfied with it. I originally saw this anime online, through Crunchyroll and I loved it to bits, loved it so much, I had to buy this collector's edition.

Pros:
* I liked the fact that this has both the blue-ray and the DVD version in it. I could watch the Blue-ray in the living with the blue-ray player, or if Im feeling lazy, I could just pop in the DVD on my desktop.
* The little booklet was awesome. Its on the heavy side, made with really nice paper and its in color.  Inside the booklet includes a short story, episode introductions with screenshots, character introductions by yours truly; Yacchan, storyboard peeks, rough sketches of the characters and a bunch of extras!!
* The extra box came with the poster, keychain, pins, glasses, authentic card, ruler, lanyard, sticker, art card; basically everything that is shown in the pictures.

Cons:
* The only problem I had was with the poster. Because its been folded up about three times, there are deep creases in the poster. The worst thing was in the middle, where the crease is so bad, it looks like it a hold could be ripped through.

I wish posters wouldnt be folded up like so, but it cant be helped. Overall, I am very very satisfied with this product.

When the movies come out, Im going to get those too!",1451174400,12,1294,4.536480686695279

7308969,5,B010CVV07S,"The juxtaposition of comedy and horror is not especially unusual, but I've rarely seen such absolutely lunatic comedy contrasted with such gruesome horror, which makes for some pretty wide swings in overall episode mood.  If you haven't seen it before, you never know whether in a given episode you are going to see our heroes tangling with monsters that can merely make them smell bad or monsters that can rip their bodies or their minds to shreds.  Thus IMHO the comedy serves a useful purpose: it allows us to get to know (and get to like) the characters under less stressful than life or death situations and it lightens the mood because without it this would be a pretty depressing ordeal.

At its most basic Beyond the Boundary is Yet Another story about young monster slayers.  The monsters are Youmu, invisible-to-ordinary-humans spirit creatures, said to be the product of negative human emotions.  As a result, most (though by no means all) youmu are harmful, ranging from annoying pranksters through vicious killers to world consuming horrors, and the only thing standing between them and us are a relative handful of young men and women with the spiritual affinity necessary to see youmu and the supernatural abilities (and the willingness to use them) necessary to destroy them.  Finally, when a youmu is killed, it drops a Youmu Stone, which can be exchanged for money at a sanctioned appraiser who pays out according to things like aggressiveness, degree of difficulty, etc.  This is strangely similar to how the economy works in the light novel/manga/anime series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Is-It-Wrong-to-Try-to-Pick-Up-Girls-in-a-Dungeon/dp/0316339156/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon</a>, but with two important differences.  In IIWTTTPUGIAD adventurers slay monsters for fame, fortune,... and girls (Don't ask!), but in BTB the only practical goal is money.  After all there isn't much fame to be had for slaying monsters most people cannot even see and which you are not even allowed to talk about with normies, and spirit world warriors tend to have it pretty awful in the romance department.  For example Shizuku Ninomiya, a rather attractive and personable (if slightly silly) spirit world warrior working as a teacher at the high school most of the characters attend gets dumped so often it has become a joke to her spirit world oblivious students.  Izumi Nase, effective head of the Nase clan of spirit world warriors goes so far as to counsel her younger sister, Mitsuki, to stay alone until she retires, something Izumi seems to be practicing herself, which has resulted in Mitsuki missing out on most normal childhood experiences with her ""normal"" peers.  In light of this, spirit world warrior Yayoi Kanbara producing a child with a youmu father doesn't seem all that inconceivable, in any sense of the word.

Into this grim situation come our two main protagonists: Akihito Kanbara, the half human, half youmu product of said union and Mirai Kuriyama, the last living member of a cursed and nearly exterminated clan of spirit world warriors that use their own blood as a lethal weapon, and amazingly, joyously, they manage to hit it off, though naturally they are the last to know it.  Despite his fetish for glasses, her overuse of the phrase that translates to ""how unpleasant"", and an entire box full of screwball comedy romantic complications, not to mention all this spirit world business, they gradually, oh, so gradually fall in love, but is happiness even possible for them in this world where the greatest evil comes not from rampaging youmu but rather from the horrifyingly corrupt human mind and heart?

Let's just say it comes to a satisfying ending IMHO,...

or rather it SEEMS to....

I've got to give the creators credit, they made a sincere effort to give those viewers who would rather stop here a seemingly happy ending, but the story isn't really happily ended, not by a long shot.  I'll give you one word:

amnesia.

Yes, it's the most overused trick in an author's toolbox, but it is used with great care and skill here.  If someone had lived a life filled with misery and regret, wouldn't said person be happier if it were now possible to live without all those sad memories?  Even if it meant you had to give up associating?  Even if you had been in love?  More importantly, do you have the right to make that decision for someone else?  All these questions are considered in a story that also ties up some loose ends from the TV show you might have forgotten about in the rush of the cataclysmic climax.  This is the plot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-the-Boundary-I-ll-Be-Here/dp/B071RMZ3VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond the Boundary - I'll Be Here</a>: The Future, the second of two movies produced after the series ended, the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-the-Boundary-I-ll-Be-Here/dp/B071RMZ3VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond the Boundary - I'll Be Here</a>: The Past, being a compilation film, and though watching the compilation is optional, watching the second really isn't if you would have a true happy ending.  Interestingly, to a much greater extent than the TV series, it drives home a moral that works for spirit world warriors and normies alike: don't go it alone.  A burden shared is a burden eased whether you are talking about couples, families, or friends.  In a time when the increasing tendency is to get completely wrapped up in our own worlds with our own problems, that's good and perhaps even necessary advice.

Note: Only the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Collector-s-Edition/dp/B010CVUYKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Collector's Edition</a>&nbsp;of this TV series complete collection includes the prequel OVA Episode 0 that shows what happened when Akihito and the Nase family first met, but all versions include the 5 episodes of ""Beyond the Boundary Trial Idol!"" which amount to a self-parody in the form of a dream.  I would recommend NOT watching Episode 0 first, before the 12 regular episodes your first time through because it gives away a few things that are best picked up as the series reveals them, and then watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-the-Boundary-I-ll-Be-Here/dp/B071RMZ3VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond the Boundary - I'll Be Here</a>: The Future.  Finally, watch the 5 idol trial episodes last because otherwise they will make a lot less sense.

Note: When it comes to subtitles versus voice dubbing, I'm no purist; I'm willing to accept either though all things being equal I prefer dubbing to subbing so that I can watch what's showing on the rest of the screen easier.  However, all is not equal in this set.  For reasons I could only speculate upon, the subtitling is better, providing information the dubbing does not.  So if you would understand as much as possible about what is going on watch the subtitled version at least once, and pay attention.

8722068,5,B010CVV07S,"Fantastic product. Came earlier than expected but that's not important. What is important is how good this box is. The actual box it comes in is solid and looks amazing, having two different pictures on the two main sides. The blue ray and DVD case have different pictures as well. The art book is well main and is so fun to look through. I love the ""Yacchan's Gonna Expose Everything About you"" segment. Then we get to the box of goodies. Most of the things inside are individually wrapped so they wouldn't get all jumbled up. The keychain immediately when on my keychain and I couldn't help myself from wearing Mirai's glasses around the house for a bit. They were just like how I imagined they would be and they are made well so they won't break to easily. The art cards are well made and are double sided, the pins are cute, and the lanyard isn't to long like some are. EVERYTHING in there was just really good. Only issue I had was that I had to work out the creases on the poster but it was still really nice. All and all if you or the person you'r buying this for likes this anime then I would highly recommend this. Hope you enjoy.",1474588800,,1139,4.3023255813953485
