442475,3,6302241081,"Ive always loved Lucille Ball.  She was such a firecracker, and she had some serious acting chops, not merely comedic and but she knew how to convey a deeper feeling, an intimate sadness that Im sure had a lot to do with her personal life and working so closely with the man she experienced true highs and lows with.  Their television career was a great professional high for them, while their cinematic career was probably considered a low.  They only made three films together, and none of them were commercial or critical successes.  Their talents were largely considered strictly for the TV.

I stumbled upon this 1956 film a few nights ago, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.

First, it didn't play out like an I Love Lucy sketch, which I was afraid it might.  Instead, this had a personality all its own.  Yes, it did have the physical comedy that didn't feel remarkably unique, but that was a small part of the film.  I will admit, the film does feel like two films pushed together, possibly even three, but the film is brisk enough to entertain that notion without feeling overwrought.

Basically, Susan is from money and her closest friends resent her new husband, Lorenzo, who is a homely scientist who desires to get away from all things new and flashy and really LIVE his life.  Susan is torn, but a visit from her guardian angel changes all that and she decides to accompany her husband on a brief expedition to further his research and cure their marital problems.  The lead up to the guardian angel talk is nicely composed, with some pitch perfect dialog.  The guardian angel bit is a tad tired and elongated, and then the expedition is corny but brief and entertaining.  Really, this is completely enjoyable thanks to Balls dynamic presence.

Its not a great movie, but it is well worth a gander.",1395187200,,1825,4.641744548286605
442476,4,6302241081,I LOVE LUCILLE BALL IN MOST OF HER MOVIES BUT HATED THE TV SHOWS.  THIS WAS ONE OF HER LATER ONES AND WAS CUTE.  JAMES MASON AS AN ANGEL WAS CLEVER.  NOT THE TYPE OF ROLE THAT HE USUALLY PLAYED.,1393804800,,194,3.8

442647,4,6302241081,"This is a great family film about the challenges of marriage--and we can learn alot of things from watching it.  It is different from most of the films and tv shows we've seen before with Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, because it has an almost spiritual aspect to it, which I liked and made me respect them as a couple even more.  Also, we don't see so much of the slapstick humor as we usually see with Lucy and Ricky.  Lucy plays an unusually rich socialite heir (Susan) who marries Lorenzo Vega (Larry) and discovers that being rich doesn't always offer answers to all our problems--especially in the area of marriage.  Susan's marriage is on the verge of disaster, because of lack of communication and constant pressure from her cousin, (played by Natalie Schafer--""Gilligan's Island""--""Lovey Howell."") Lorenzo, who is a scientist specializing in insecticides, understandably can't get along with Susan's cousin and her husband--who seem to be worst pests than his insecticides could ever go after.  Well, Prince Charming angel--in the angel-likeness of James Mason suddenly shows up, wishing to help mend the marriage--although Larry never seems to see him!  One of the funniest scenes is when Susan and Larry go to the movies and there, voila!, is James Mason starring in the film!  Susan imagines herself to be in the film with him and really falls for him--which, of course, temporarily causes problems with her relationship with the angel.  When the angel finally explains his reason for coming to Susan, she is then able to think of some ways to help rescue her marriage from disaster with his help.  (By the way, I read once that Cary Grant was originally asked to play the angel in this movie, but declined.  This makes a little more sense and I think Cary Grant would have made a more exciting movie star angel--but I'm just as glad James Mason took the part--and I think stepped up to the challenge very well).  Also, I have to comment on Desi Arnaz's great talent for acting and comedic timing--as well as his musical genius--which I often think were underrated.
  My young daughters love to watch this film with me and I like them to see it also over and over--hoping that they'll learn some tips about relationships from this movie.  They're only six, so they were a little afraid of the ""angel aspect,"" but once they got past that, they seemed to enjoy the film over and over.  And by the way, Lucy has never looked so gorgeous as she does in the beginning scene of this movie--in her breathtakingly beautiful wedding gown.",1335139200,,2539,4.764840182648402
442648,4,6302241081,"Too Many Girls- This is probably one of the most BORING musical ever! The acting is OK. Out of three male leads, Arnaz is the best. The main lead is wooden and the other two, well I never laughed at any of the jokes but they were amusing at best. Lucille Ball is alright but it's nothing to write home about. It does prove however that she can do serious moments compared to what she does later. The rest of the cast is just there, they don't do much of anything. I've heard complaints that shows that depict high school age people (Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, Glee, etc.) don't get actors that resemble that age range but this is a young, romantic college musical and no one resembles any college age person I've ever seen. Maybe some people were around that age but I had a hard time believing any of these people were twentysomething. The songs are forgettable. I've seen this movie about three times and I don't remember any of them. And none of them make any sense in the context of the musical except for maybe Love Never Went To College. Desi pays the school's $300 fine, so let's sing a song about cakewalking or cake or whatever. Another reason why I didn't like the music is something that I don't like about a lot of musicals made around that time and that is every single person sings and sounds the same (except Desi)! I also don't like the fact that they dubbed Lucy. In certain episodes of I Love Lucy (I can't recall which), you can clearly hear her singing and she's not that bad (and wasn't she in a Broadway play around the early sixties after I Love Lucy ended?)

442651,5,6302241081,"Following the box-office success of their ""Long, Long Trailer"" film, Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz gave it one more try: 1956's ""Forever Darling"", a more grounded suburban comedy for the duo. This time around, however, there's no ""prop"" like a 40-foot trailer to push the story; if anything, just a ""fantasy"" gimmick. Again, the story begins with Lucy & Desi as newlyweds, with an amusing montage about what happens when the marriage becomes more ""common"" as the morning ""goodbye"" disintegrates from a passionate kiss to a quick peck on the cheek. After a few years, the marriage is on the rocks as the couple bicker---and not helped at all by meddling friends (one of which is Natalie Schaffer, ""Mrs. Howell"" from TV's ""Gilligan's Island"" fame). Then, Lucy believes she is ""losing her mind"" when an apparition--an angel taking the form of her favorite ""fantasy man"", James Mason--appears to tell her that the marriage is in dire peril, and that something must be done to save it.
The first three-quarters of the film is mostly dialogue-driven, allowing minimal physical comedy. The best is saved for last as the movie opens up for broader situation comedy during a funny & disastrous camping trip climax. Desi is surprisingly effective in the role of a pesticide chemist. And Lucy does what she does best: Fumbling through situations, reacting with those wide blue eyes, and showing her natural gift for physical comedy. Her reactions when watching (and eventually, ""dreaming"" herself into) the movie at the theatre while swooning over Mason are hysterical. The camping trip has too many funny moments to recount.
Another good example why Lucy & Desi were the reigning ""king & queen of situation comedy"" of the 50's!",1307836800,2,1713,4.993006993006993
442652,4,6302241081,"The three DVD box set, THE LUCY & DESI COLLECTION, offers fans of television's favorite red head and her Latin husband, the only three movies that they starred in together.

You get ""Too Many Girls,"" the black and white movie where Lucille Ball met Desi Arnaz and two color films, ""The Long, Long Trailer"" and ""Forever, Darling"" both of which were filmed during the height of their popularity on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-Lucy-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000TGJ8B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love Lucy: The Complete Series</a>.

Although it's difficult to separate Ball and Arnaz from their iconic roles as ""Lucy & Ricky Ricardo,"" it's still fun watching them ham it up for the camera. Like I said in the headline all that's missing is Vivian Vance and William Frawley as their trusted side-kicks, but fans of ""I Love Lucy"" will spot many of the supporting actors and actresses, plus extras, that appeared on the TV show in these films.

The quality is excellent, especially the two color films where fans get treated to seeing Lucy and Desi in color. In ""Forever, Darling,"" Ball sports some of the wardrobe she wears as ""Lucy Ricardo"" on TV, so fans get another feast seeing the fashions as they would've looked to a studio audience.

To top it off each DVD comes with extras, which I'm wondering if these were played in movie theaters back in the day, either during intermission or before the start of the movie, so it gives today's audience a glimpse of the past:

* TOO MANY GIRLS * EXTRAS
Frances Caroll & The Coquettes - 09:16-minutes -- fabulous all-female swing band that really play up a storm!

Cartoon: Shop, Look & Listen - 07:56 -- mice take a tour of a closed department store.

* THE LONG, LONG TRAILER * EXTRAS
Ain't It Aggravatin? - 08:19-minutes -- short film showing the funny situations that happen in life that can get on one's nerves.

Cartoon: Dixieland Droopy - 07:44 -- shows the famous cartoon dog and his Dixie band, ""Pee-Wee Runt Dixieland Band"" which are fleas.

* FOREVER, DARLING * EXTRAS
Promo Interview - 04:57-minutes -- Black & White interview of Lucy and Desi with clip from the film.

He doesn't have any purpose until the last minutes of the story and up until then he's kind of creepy.

You will get all 3 movies that Lucy and Desi ever made, ""The Long Long Trailer"" Forever Darling"" and ""Too Many Girls."" The first two are my favorites because ""The Long Long Trailer"" reminds me much of ""I Love Lucy"" as lucy is just as wacky on this one. ""Forver Darling"" Is a terrific movie also, allthough Lucy is not as wacky and comedic on this one as ""The Long Long Trailer"" it is still funny and this movie is when Lucy and Desi head out doors for a camping trip as they are having marriage problems Lucy's guardian angel is right by her side the whole time. Lucy think's she is seeing things but she soon realizes that she has a guardian angel (James Mason.)

 The movie ""Too Many Girls"" features a younger Lucy and Desi, in this great musical feature. I think this one is my least favorite because it was not as romantic as the others because it was a slower setting and Lucy and Desi's characters did not meet until the middle of the movie. The other movies were a true romantic as Lucy and Desi were married in both of the other two movies.

 ""The Long Long Trailer Featured Lucy and Desi as a newlywed couple as they cross the country on a road trip and wacky comedic encounters along the way as that is why it is truly a ""I Love Lucy"" fans delight. This is my favorite because it is hilarious, a must have collection.

I thought then and still to this day think she is the funniest and  most brilliant comedian.  The title THE QUEEN OF COMEDY could not fit anyone but her. I remember when the LONG LONG TRAILER came to my neighborhood in Ozone Park, Queens NY.  To see my favorite comedian in color and for well over an hour was a memorable experience for me.  Lucy was my first true love.  Through the years I have watched the I Love Lucy reruns over and over and over. Each time  I see them I laugh like it's the first time.  Through the years I ordered the Columbia House I love Lucy VHS tapes, copied most of them off the TV and then finally ordered the complete I LOVE LUCY collection on DVD.  Bought the VHS version of THE LONG LONG TRAILER. Imagine how excited I was when I found out that it was going to be released on DVD.  I ordered the 3 DVD set immediately. Ah  it was like Christmas in July when it finally came.  Only one other person, a dear friend of mine loves Lucy as much as I do.  We talk Lucy all the time, compare notes and try to stump the other with trivia questions. I know more than my friend does but we still have fun.  So would I recommend the 3 DVD set?  It's priceless and a must for anyone who even remotely likes Lucille Ball.  I cannot wait for the release of Mame.

442889,4,6302241081,"Before their sojourn as America's premier television comedy couple, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnez were, respectively, a studio contract player and a Latin band leader. Taking these two identities into consideration, their first appearance together (though not as a couple) was in the George Abbot-directed film version of the Rodgers-and-Hart Broadway hit ""Too Many Girls"". This film is a fascinating relic of another era: it shows the energetic production numbers which were the hallmark of Abbott's Broadway career. It also shows the rushing and cutting which were par for the course when a Broadway show was remounted in Hollywood. ""Too Many Girls"" may not be a great Hollywood classic, but it's still worthwhile for anyone interested in getting a glimpse of what a Broadway hit was like in the immediate pre-war period. It's also a glimpse at the slightly tacky production values offered by RKO in its musicals.

Both ""The Long Long Trailer"" and ""Forever Darling"" were films made to cash in on the ""I Love Lucy"" phenomenon. ""The Long Long Trailer"" is often sharp in its satire, as a couple tries to negotiate a honeymoon in a pre-fab trailer, traversing an America of unexpected aggressions. Vincente Minnelli directed, so the movie is actually very smooth. The same cannot be said of ""Forever Darling"", though here, the director Alexander Hall was obviously recruited because of his ""light touch"" with the supernatural, as in ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan""; here, the comedy is mostly leaden, and tensions in the Ball-Arnez marriage aren't even a subtext, those tensions are right on the surface. And poor James Mason: he's so obviously disconcerted to be in the midst of this morass!

But this is a fascinating collection, and recommended for a lot of reasons beyond the sight of one of the most renowned comedy couples at different stages in their careers.",1151625600,5,1854,5.055555555555555

442937,2,6302241081,"My friend bought this set and so I was able to view it before purchasing it myself, and I WON'T be purchasing it. I had seen The Long, Long Trailer before and it was one of the most aggrivating movies I have ever seen; one of those films where you can't believe 2 people could be so dumb to do some of the things they do. We enjoy most of the I Love Lucy series, but there is a point where you can only take so much of those shows; the aggrivating ones, and this film was just an overly long aggrivating I Love Lucy episode. There is funny humor and aggrivating ""humor"" and this was definitely the 2nd type.

Yes, it was interesting to see Lucy and Desi doing films together, but overall these films are just tolerable, and none are ones I would rewatch for enjoyment. Too Many Girls was definitely a B picture, really really bad in so many ways...poorly written script, cheap scenery; you never got the feeling they were in college, except at the football game, which seemed so similar to the football game the Marx Brothers participated in in Horse Feathers! Too much partying, singing, dancing; what was this school majoring in, theatre and opera?  It just is a really bad picture. Yes, neat to see Lucy and Desi and how they met, and see them so young together, but otherwise, a real time waster in my mind. The funniest thing on this disc was the cartoon extra!

Of the three, Forever, Darling is probably the best but again that seemed ""lacking"" somewhere. The color was that beautiful almost surreal 50's color that I like. The Yosemite scenery was beautiful too. But I think the angel stuff could have been much better developed; he was out of the scene too long at times. The part I liked best was Lucy imagining herself in the movie with James Mason because it was quite funny. But the camping trip was just a very predictable mishap time that was too much in the I Love Lucy mold and I was bored with it quickly.

I know die hard fans of Lucy and Desi will buy this no matter what, and that's fine. But for others, I advise you see them first...you may like them, but then you may see them for what they really are cinematically. There are lots better movies out there that I would rather buy! I Rate these 2 stars; one star to me is ""torturous"" to watch. These aren't THAT bad, but almost.",1148947200,3,2301,4.344186046511628
442938,5,6302241081,"I knew that Desi and Lucy were in ""too many girls"", but i've never heard of the other two until today. actually, on TCM they showed these 3 movies. ""The Long, Long Trailer"" especially reminds me of them on ""I Love Lucy"". Actually the one thing I like about the last 2 movies are that they're in color!",1146787200,5,301,4.206896551724138
442939,5,6302241081,"At last! Aside from the fact that I do, along with the rest of the world, love Lucy...to have these three films finally arrive on DVD is a dream come true.

THE LONG, LONG TRAILER is truly one of the great screen comedies of all time, and although Lucy & Desi play characters named ""Tacy and Nicky"", they run pretty close to the Ricardos in many ways. The film gives both beloved performers many chances for their signature slapstick, but being based on a best-selling book, there are also touching moments that remain poignant. Deftly directed by Vincente Minnelli, it's no wonder, TRAILER was a box office smash.

FOREVER DARLING is a delightful collection with a bit of a twist, and the added bonus of James Mason as Lucy & Desi's guardian angel.....Last, but certainly not least, we get something special. TOO MANY GIRLS is the movie where Lucy met Desi and the pair fell in love. They don't have many scenes together, but it's a superb screen version of the Rodgers & Hart Broadway show that made Desi Arnaz a star, and Lucy, Ann Miller, Eddie Bracken and the rest of the cast make this a must-have for fans of classic film.

Cheers to Warner Brothers for bringing out this great collection of the only 3 movies our Lucy & Desi made together, and at such a low price, you can't pass it up!",1146096000,43,1294,4.497872340425532

They are as wonderful together on the big screen as they are on the small screen. The fact that they put up their own money to make the ""I Love Lucy"" pilot and ""The Long Long Trailer"" shows how well they knew their audience. Their comedic talent and mutual love just shines through in every scene of every movie, even though in ""Too Many Girls"" Lucy and Desi did not end up together.",1144886400,19,525,4.0095238095238095

442944,5,6302241081,"I have seen both Forever, Darling and The Long, Long Trailer (in that order) and would be hard-pressed to say which one I liked most. I love the title song sung by the Ames Brothers, but to hear Desi sing it in Spanish was a delight. Other reviewers have mentioned James Mason (I loved him as Dr. Watson in Murder By Decree) but don't forget the actress who played Thurston Powell III's wife on Gilligan's Island, Natalie Schafer, playing Susan's high-society mother!! All the comedy scenes will leave you breathless (I loved it her slave-and-master routine when she and her husband's first jaunt in the rowboat ended (with her rowing) but don't lose sight of the reason for the trip. It was because their marriage was on the rocks that Susan went with her husband in hopes of fixing things between them, and it was in the end, when she told her husband it was time she started going in his direction rather than her own, that my tears came. It would have been glorious if more movies by this superb team had followed.",1119744000,8,1018,4.538043478260869

James Mason is a funny character as well as a guy who teaches Susan (Lucy). Lorenzo or Larry (Desi) cannot se the gaurdian angel, neither can Susan's father.
The couple gets into a fight one day, and then James Mason gives advice to Susan. And they go on a trip together to test out some product. They still sometimes get into fights, but in the end, as always, all is good.",996710400,,557,4.314285714285714

442992,3,6302241081,"Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were brilliant together, but they deserved better than this film.  As Lucy says herself in her autobiography: ""Forever Darling"" has an underdeveloped plot and poor shooting.  Nothing really happens; the characters just breeze along from one irrelevant scene to the next.  However, the movie does have some pretty funny lines . . . in a mindless sort of way. If you need a good Lucy and Desi movie, let me suggest ""The Long, Long Trailer.""",990403200,4,466,4.8

I loved that one too, but I loved this one more!)This movie had me laughing so hard my stomach hurt! Lucy and Desi  are an unbeatable team. Lucille Ball was born to be in Technicolor. She  looks absolutely gorgeous in it, with her fiery red hair, intense blue  eyes, and four corner, blood-red lips. Desi looks darkly handsome with his  jet-black hair, great brown eyes,and deeply tanned skin. The two can really  act. Think of this movie as an I Love Lucy in color, but with beautiful  scenery and James Mason, Susan's(Lucy's) guardian angel. I cannot believe  that back in 1956 when Lucy and Desi made this film that it was panned. It  kept me laughing till the end! The story is simple: Susan and Larry Vega  think their marraige is on the rocks, so Susan's guardian angel, James  Mason, advises her to go on a business trip with him, and everything works  out well between the two, with minor(but hilarious!)setbacks along the way.
