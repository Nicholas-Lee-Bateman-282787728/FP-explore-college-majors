8568840,4,B00BI4RKFK,Nice hike but should have been longer. Could have filmed the return trip or added a trek from a nearby location.,1423440000,,112,4.380952380952381
8568841,4,B00BI4RKFK,"I have about a dozen of the Virtual Active dvds, and this is one of the few that I dislked the music (especially the many miles song) which was my reason for deducting a star. Fortunately, there is a music on/off option which can be used while doing the basic or guided walk!  Then you can hear nature sounds or just play your own music, if you want. The hike itself has some great scenery and what makes this one interesting is the various paths taken in the woods (steps, suspension bridges, etc.)  Camera work was good and steady, but I noticed more tourists seemed to be smiling for the camera (which makes me think there was something big strapped to the guy who was filming.) This workout focuses on hill climbs and feels very realistic, as well as making me want to travel to British Columbia to follow in VA's footsteps. Very serene and peaceful setting (other than the folksy music playlist.)  Also, the cooldown had a slideshow of still shots taken which I didn't care for as much.  Johnny is a great trainer and motivator and I enjoy him very much.  He provides helpful and useful information, and he's always an excellent guide!",1398556800,2,1140,4.541463414634146
8568842,5,B00BI4RKFK,"I really love the content on this video.  I'm a big forest/creeks/running water/ waterfall fan, so I find this video really beautiful.  It's nice to get a little background info on the area from Johnny as well.  At one point in the video you see a man bungee jump off a bridge and I really like the ""tree-tops"" walk which is bridges suspended between large redwood trees.  I'd a really neat hike.  Some other video companies have more than one walk on a DVD which would be nice, but so far, I'm not too tired of this one yet.",1395878400,,525,4.262626262626263
8568843,5,B00BI4RKFK,"The photography is excellent, the location a superb choice. The area on the British Columbia Sea to Sky Hike is beautiful! The suspension bridge was fun. I recommend it!

I have enjoyed all of the VirtualActive DVDs that I've watched so far. I view them while working out on my exercise bike, elliptical machine, treadmill, etc. Johnny Pearman is a little bit narrator, a little bit trainer, and a little bit tour guide. He manages to do all of that without getting in the way of the workout and/or scenery. I always feel very much motivated when watching these DVDs.",1387670400,,567,4.67
8568844,4,B00BI4RKFK,Wonder if they are really walking with a camera on or carrying it. Sometimes it felt like he was riding a bike he was going so fast. Overall gorgeous hike,1376611200,,154,4.166666666666667
8568845,5,B00BI4RKFK,This is one of four Virtual Active dvds that I use when I get on the elliptical machine. Great for enjoying beautiful B.C. and getting your 30 minutes of activity in! Well photographed and can be used with or without narration.,1368835200,,227,4.560975609756097
