8097411,1,B000CCMNGU,Three hours in length.  Tedious nature shots. Disparate subjects. Chaotic I had to fast speed to get through it.  It could be condensed into a thirty minute documentary.  Very slow.,1451001600,,181,4.966666666666667
8097412,5,B000CCMNGU,"While this is formally a documentary, it brings you into the experience of meditation in the way that it's filmed.  By going through religion, gambling, drugs, and travel, it helps you see how related they are to the human experience.  It's hard to describe, because it's not a movie like one you've seen before.  It's brilliant.",1277337600,2,329,4.839285714285714
8097413,5,B000CCMNGU,"I don't think I had any idea that cinema could be what that film was. It was absolutely brilliant. I have never seen anything like it. I think it's my new favorite film. It's the type of thing that is so pure and so real and so human....that right after watching it...it's very hard to feel alone...and it's very hard to look at the world in the same way. Truly one of a kind film. Everything a movie should have is there. Laughter, drama, fear, human moments of divine revelation...and on my end...I must say...at three hours...there wasn't a dull moment. An incredible experience on so many levels. Imagine a mix of Herzog documentaries, Lynchian visuals, stories reminiscent of Jean-Pierre Jeunet (who did Amelie), mixed with a sort of 60's spiritual theme, a little Baraka thrown in, and a tad of Gilliam for good measure....and that doesn't even begin to give it justice.

It is filmed all over the world and is about different peoples ideas of divinity and transcendence and what people believe about their lives and God and the different ways they go about seeking a mystical experience through the use of various vices. It's MASSIVE in scope.

For whatever weird reason, amazon doesn't have this for sale. But you can find it on petermettler.com.",1191628800,6,1254,4.774193548387097
