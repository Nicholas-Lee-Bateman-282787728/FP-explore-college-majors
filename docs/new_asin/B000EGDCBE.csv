8109175,3,B000EGDCBE,"In the same way that no one would discuss Lewis without discussing Clark, this work is title ""D. Livingstone,"" but as soon as you turn on the disc, it says ""Stanley and Livingstone.""  The first sixth of the work is dedicated entirely to Stanley, rather than Livingstone.

The actors play the explorers with a background of ferns that you can buy at the local supermarket, rather than anything that looks like a real African jungle.  The narrator says that in the 19th century, Africa was divided by the Arabs, the Dutch, and the Portuguese.  Hello!  What about France?!  Why are Mali, Senegal, the Congo, and many other countries Francophone if their description of Africa is true?  This work only records one scholar, rather than the handful one sees in most documentaries.

At one point, the work shows a drawing of Stanley, a little African boy in front of him, and an Indian man in front of both of them.  There is an actual photograph of the three in Robert Aldrich's ""Colonialism and Homosexuality.""  According to that book, Stanley may have had a pederastic relationship with the young male, but this documentary says nothing on the topic.

The scholar says that Livingstone opposed slavery and treated Africans as equal.  The narrator says Stanley fought on both sides of the U.S. Civil War.  As an African American, when the documentary concludes by saying Livingstone is buried in Westminster Abbey, but Stanley was considered too mean and nasty for that honor, I was pleased.

The documentary does a great job in showing all the places the two men traveled and thus their ability to explore uncharted African becomes understandable.  If you ever wanted to know why ""Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"" is a phrase that people know more than a century after its utterance, than this is for you.",1183248000,,1797,4.845901639344262
8109176,1,B000EGDCBE,"I wish there would have been a review on this before I purchased it. The acting is poor (unless you want a laugh) and the setting is obviously not taken at all in Africa. There is one interview with some historian with a pony tail, red suit, and wild tie. If it weren't for the non-intended comedy, I would have fallen asleep.

It is also amazing how there is so little focus on David Livingstone's religion or influence.

Do not purchase this documentary!",1163721600,8,456,4.481927710843373
