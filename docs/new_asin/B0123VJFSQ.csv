7342534,5,B0123VJFSQ,One of my favorite singers.  Loved this CD,1467331200,,42,4.25
7342535,5,B0123VJFSQ,"This DVD is much different than what I usually buy. David Phelps, however, is a dear person, and wonderful singer, and I love his family and friends as well, so I bought it, and I like it. If one is really stuck on the old traditional hymns and has a problem with the more contemporary music, then buy it, but know that you need to prepare your mind. How's that? I cannot recommend that you not buy it, because it is a very nice experience.

Gaither and Phelps converse now and again, and I learned a good deal from those conversations. Also, his children sing too. The girls were then seventeen and twenty, I believe.  I just sat in amazement, not knowing exactly what was coming next. What a treat. You will probably see many familiar faces. How fun it much be to spend so much time singing with friends who share your convictions. It is a blessing to me that I can have recordings of such moments right in my own home, and play them almost whenever I want to, and sometimes it is almost like I know them personally, because I too share those convictions, and one day, I shall know them very personally. There are no strangers when one is with others who share their passions, and even more so, when the passion is to be with our Lord.",1464998400,2,1237,4.327586206896552
7342536,5,B0123VJFSQ,"David is one of today's best tenors. The lyrics of songs he has written have deep meaning and the entire DVD is a wonderful blend of musical styles. I've shared this DVD with Christians and non-Christians. The reaction is the same, ""Wow, love it!"" Thank you, David. Keep writing songs and singing!",1464566400,,297,4.730769230769231
7342537,5,B0123VJFSQ,"David Phelps is an incredible tenor. He is also very creative and gives a wonderful performance. I am very picky about music videos and this is one of the first that I can see no real production issues.

David's sincere Christianity comes through these performances. I am blessed by hearing the words of these songs. Charlotte Ritchie is a great addition to the concert. Also liked the wonderful rich base of Todd Suttles as a background singer--it really enhances David's voice. The range of musical styles is also amazing. Loved this DVD.

Note to David (though I doubt he will see this): While everything about this DVD is incredibly good, it is very intense. It is hard for this fan to listen to the concert in one setting. I get burned out. The excellent Gaither Vocal Band song was a relief--needs something lighter like this a break every 5-6 songs. For me, that song was the only real break in the entire performance. When my brain checks out, I miss the spiritual benefit of the wonderful songs.",1462147200,,1004,4.666666666666667

7342540,5,B0123VJFSQ,"TOPS! David Phelps is the best Tenor in the Country. I,myself, have NOT been all around the Globe. So, I cannot say that he's the best in the World. But folks... gather any of them you want... put them in a room... AND MY MONEY'S ON DAVID EVERY TIME!!!!! God has Blessed this man with a gift. And he keeps on letting God's work shine! Every project that he's an integral part of, just keeps getting better and better. ""Freedom"" is a must-have if you like ANYTHING about David Phelps. Charlotte Richie is a phenomenal addition, as well as David's gifted kids. It's simply a MUST-HAVE video!",1454630400,,589,4.514018691588785

7342551,5,B0123VJFSQ,"I watched ""Freedom"" on YouTube as done by David Phelps and I really really enjoyed his rendition, the ambiance, the other musicians, the whole feel of the concert...and wanted more. This DVD did NOT disappoint. I had a room party at our hotel on the Oregon Coast at a Christian conference in early October and everyone loved the music and the video. Granted it was good just to be where we were - it doesn't get much better than the Oregon coast - but in fact, with this DVD as the background to our party, it did !!",1445817600,8,516,4.275510204081633
