5471361,5,B00AQN09G6,"Thanks to TBS, I was exposed to this series in huge quantities. Although the series lacks story continuity, the series is connected. The six seasons fly by.",1381881600,,156,4.814814814814815
5471362,5,B00AQN09G6,This is currently the best comedy on TV! I like how the creators/writers of the show keep it funny yet the characters develop and move forward with each season. It's very well written. The DVD/BR collection all work in my Blu-ray player and each season has a gag reel and behind the scenes extras. The packaging is compact and doesn't take up a lot of space.,1381190400,,358,4.4393939393939394
5471363,3,B00AQN09G6,"My wife and I only recently started catching re-runs of this gem of a show and I decided that a more expedient way of catching up before the seventh season was starting was to purchase this set, which includes all six seasons on blu-ray.

At the time I placed the order I did not realize that this is the UK/Europe region-free version of the show.

Each season is arranged on TWO blu-ray discs, which means the shows are compressed quite a bit more than they are on the North American BD releases (where I believe every season is on 3-4 discs).  Also worth noting is that these come with DTS audio, in lieu of HD audio... not that it will make much of a difference for a sitcom.  I don't know how much the compression really matters, they look similar to HD broadcast quality to me, with each episode clocking in around 3GB in size.  It might matter to someone who wants the absolute top quality achievable for the show though so I'm mentioning it.

The shows being compressed is not my principal beef with this set.  The packaging for this set is pretty terrible.  Seasons 1-3 and Seasons 4-6 are each contained in a thicker than normal BD case that is really flimsy.  I actually dropped one from about 3 feet onto a tile floor and pretty much destroyed it (part of the spine broke off and it no longer closes).  Even worse, the cardboard that houses these two BD cases is made of really flimsy light weight cardboard, not the thicker ""collection quality"" cardboard that I expect with box sets.

The show itself of course is great, and if you don't care about the packaging quality, the episodes seem to be the same as their US version counterparts... so this does save you a few bucks versus buying the US versions on sale.  When I checked, Seasons 1-5 were on sale at worst buy for about $20 per season with season 6 being about $30, so by going this route I saved about $45.

//update - it has been pointed out to me in comments that all versions (US and otherwise) of this show have DTS audio and have a similar number of episodes per disc... although there might be more special features on US domestic versions.  The packaging for the set is still pretty terrible, so I will stand by the 3-star review.",1379721600,102,2209,4.4088669950738915

5471428,4,B00AQN09G6,"This is one of the best sit-coms on TV right now. It revolves around these nerds who live next door to a hot chick. Its a pretty simple premise and really relies on character development type humor, kind of like How I meet you r Mother. The characters in it are great. They seem almost like caricatures, but as you watch the show and see them develop, you really feel like you know them. The guys are Leonard, Raj, Howard Penny and later and Amy Farrah Fowler and Bernadette and of course Sheldon played by Jim Parsons, who steals the show and has won Emmys for this role. He delivers the best lines in the movie that make me laugh so hard. Its goofy and witty, but not over your head and pretentious. In fact it makes fun of pretentiousness. It also kind of reminds me a little of Cheers and Friends.",1407456000,,801,4.276315789473684

In fact, I already owned seasons 1-5 on regular CD format, but since it was only $30 more to get all six seasons on Blu-ray instead of buying season six alone, I went ahead and purchased it. There are two cases inside the box and it is only about an inch and a half wide. It does not take up a lot of storage space. I would buy this a 1000 times. If you have never seen the show it is hilarious and endearing. It reminds me that even though we are all screwed up, most of us have goodness in us. It's the kind of show you can enjoy with glass of wine, or as Sheldon would say, ""Grape juice that burns."" And if you're like Penny you'll take the whole bottle.",1403308800,,746,3.914473684210526

5471486,5,B00AQN09G6,"When I received the set, I was concerned that because it came from the UK, it might be in PAL (European) format instead of NTSC (USA). Nowhere on either the outside box, case boxes or the discs does it state what format they are (unlike USA made discs). Region codes are not specified either. It is stated in the description above that they are Region coded A/B/C, which are codes I've never heard of. I've only heard of numeric codes with '1' being USA and '0' being worldwide. I was relieved to find that all discs play just fine on my Sony 3D BD player. Like other reviewers, I found the  menu on the first season to be difficult to navigate since the background changing from blue to tan is the only way to tell what button the cursor is on. The other season discs are thankfully changed to a more defined difference in button definition. My main purpose in purchasing this set was to save half of what the individual seasons cost in most any store. I can forego the ""collector's"" style of a sturdier box for half the price and I haven't really noticed much difference in the picture quality from the HD TV presentations I have seen (referring to the suspected lower quality that half the disc quantity of each season might bring).",1399852800,,1235,4.464601769911504
5471487,5,B00AQN09G6,"I usually do not buy sitcoms, only movies. In fact, this the second sitcom I purchased in my entire life. The show is so great that any drawbacks of the technical aspects of the item are negligible. As a sort of a science geek myself, I simply cannot get enough of this show. If I could give it 10 stars, I would.

Nowadays, TV shows aim to make you laugh by crude and vulgar references and jokes. Although this show does a small share of this type of jokes, generally it stays above the fray. It has numerous layers of humor that will find their audience, regardless of the watchers' scientific background. It is funny for scientists (such as myself), and it is funny for hospital administrators (such as my wife).

This is one of those shows that will make laugh out loud, although I did read a few negative reviews, with which I completely disagree. I guess, you either love it or hate it. Thankfully, the majority of people love it, thus providing for the show's longevity. It has been renewed for 3 more seasons  until 2017. Hopefully, many more after that.

The image quality is slightly below expectations, but this is not really a big loss for a sitcom. The packaging is barely satisfactory, but it can be managed.

As to the pricing, it comes out to a little more than $10 per season. You just can't beat that.",1399420800,,1319,4.45643153526971
5471488,5,B00AQN09G6,"I have read some previous quirks and poor ratings on this product, and will provide a little clarification.  This is a great product for the TV show itself, the Blu-rays are condensed to allow the full seasons on two discs each, for a total of 12 discs in two packs that make up the flimsy box.  With care and treatment, this product will last, and if you are looking for a cheaper alternative than the individual seasons, this is your product.

Now, having watched the full of the 6 seasons, there are some quirks to this set, the same quirks you will most likely find in each of the individual sets if you bought those for more money.  The first season is difficult to get through, as the opening menu play button is dark blue and the non selected items are black.  Similar in season 2, but slightly more off colored for a bit more ease of seeing.  By season three, the colors were completely different.  I would assume that this set was compressed and reboxed from the original sets sold, as each opening screen for the new seasons are completely different.  Typically, if this was boxed all in itself, the opening screen on each disc would typically be the same, or match.  As a recompressed box set, there is one nice feature to this box set.  I have an older generation Blu-ray and it picks up on the auto bookmarks from this box set.  I took out one disc, played a couple other discs, put the disc back in, and it asked me if I wanted to watch from where it last left off or start from the beginning.  If you auto play all episodes and put in the next disc of that season, it will auto start playing.

Very well boxed, well worth the cost to the separate box sets.  The quirks written by previous purchasers are there, cheap cardboard box, thin plastic cases each holding 6 discs, and the compression rate of putting half a season of episodes on one disc.  The quality, as best as I can see, may not be full Blu-ray quality at the compression, but is better than DVD quality, and this is not a high definition, high graphic TV show, so I am very well pleased with this product.  This is an all region product, but if you are looking to save a little bit of money, this works just fine, and will catch you up quickly on unseen episodes.",1399248000,4,2242,4.327751196172249

I've come late to experiencing the BIG BANG THEORY because; I do not normally watch network or cable TV.  I've pulled my plug and honestly I do not miss TV.  However I visit the homes of others who have TV and every now and again I watch.  It was on just such an ocassion recently watching TV at my brothers home, that I saw BIG BANG THEORY.  I laughed so hard tears came streaming from my eyes.  Sheldon is a HOOT.  Sheldon's mom is just like my grandmother was nice but a bit of a nutt job.  Having autism I identify strongly with Sheldon and people think I am in every way just as clueless.

I'm over 50  years old and my house looks so much like Sheldon's.  I am such a geek \ nerd and have always known it.  Heck I am proud to be a brain.  I love BIG BANG THEORY because; FINALLY its a show about people like me.  Finally here is a show where the main characters are smart, funny and not ashamed of who they are.  They embrace their love of sci fi, computers and other such geeky trappings.  Best thing is I always learn a few more cool things watching BIG BANG THEORY.

I figured it was worth a shot and what do you know...it doesn't work on non blue ray electronics and DOES play on blue ray ones. I'm happy. Also, some folks complained about the menu screen and not being clear on what you're clicking on. I understand but it's not a big deal or a deal breaker. It's not rocket science people, figure it out who cares! No complaints what so ever here! However, if you are colorblind you will have more trouble than us regular eyed folk.

We both enjoy watching this series together.  I'd say this has been one of his favorite gifts I have ever given him.  Just a note for other customers' information:  I read that some of the versions could not be played in the U.S., so I became very careful about what I was purchasing.  This particular series showed up just prior to Christmas, however, I came very close to making a terrible mistake by buying a version that could not be played in the U.S.  Read carefully about intended purchases to avoid that kind of thing.

I read the review which seemed positive and pulled the trigger.  The set is really great for the money.  The compression on the video is pretty high in order to fit all the seasons onto this many discs so you will notice it is a little grainier than you might expect from television broadcast quality.  I would equate this to a good HD cable signal rather than a super high quality Blu-ray.  It is still HD none the less and it is still very pristine.  As I said, the seasons are stored on multiple discs and packaged nicely in several snap cases inside of a cardboard sleeve.  This saves on space rather having a whole shelf full of seasons.

Other than a warnerborthers.uk web address, nothing on the packaging indicates these discs are Region-UK. They are labeled for rental/resale, kind of weirdly, actually. Packaging is very basic, but acceptable. Three seasons (2 discs each) per Blu-Ray packaging. It looks fantastic with the rest of my Blu-Rays.

Knowing that the cases were already cracked when I opened Amazon's packaging, I handled the cases fairly delicately; but by the time I had removed the first two discs from the first case, both cases were cracked to the point that they will not close, the spindle mounts had cracked so that the discs will not stay in place, the hinges holding the inner 'pages' of the case had broken, and even the edges of the cases were chipping apart.

I'm not sure if some of this damage happened during shipping, but it is a very cheap case/plastic that will soon fall apart regardless of any shipping issues.

It is a UK produced set, but it will work fine in US machines.  Bought this as a present and so I have tested 2 random episodes from each disc.  All the episodes worked perfectly except I did have an audio issue on one episode in season 1 disc 2 but I tested two extra episodes on that disc and did not have any other issues so I will chalk that up to a scratch or my blue player being old and used.  The video quality is good and looks better than broadcast quality but I cant comment on how it stacks up to other blu ray quality.  The first two seasons did have a terrible choice in color for the title menu options but the other seasons are fine (this is my only complaint).  For how much this set costs it is a definite buy if you don't mind that it is not the official US distribution version, but that doesn't really matter because I got this set for the content not the packaging which is on par with a regular disc set.
