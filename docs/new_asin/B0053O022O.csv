4533970,4,B0053O022O,"VCI Entertainment and Conquest Productions presents ""PENNY PRINCESS"" (1952) (94 min/Color) -- Starring Yolande Donlan, Dirk Bogarde, A.E. Matthews, Reginald Beckwith, Mary Clare, Edwin Styles, Kynaston Reeves, Desmond Walter-Ellis & Peter Butterworth

Directed by Val Guest

Another winner from the British Invasion released by VCI.

A delightful blend of British romantic comedy with Yolande Donlon who inherits a teeny tiny little county of Lampidorra.  The citizens there have a thriving industry that has kept them going for years - the industry of smuggling.

Enters Dirk Bogarde who is on a trip to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It seems as though the Lampidorrans have a kind of cheese that they playfully refer to as Schmeeze.

How does Schmeeze work, well that's the gimmick to the whole film. There are a few bumps in the road, Schmeeze solves all the problems both financial, geopolitical, but can it solve the romance department between Donlan and Bogarde.

Dirk Bogarde was well cast in the part which was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heart throb.  Much earlier than his acting ability that finally kicked in later.

Special footnote: -- Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our little gem, and stayed married for 50 years!  Guest was better known for writing and directing his sci-fi flicks, in both the UK & the US.

Beautiful in color -- Yolande Donlan made this even more so, as she played one of the most adorable female leads I have ever seen. You can't help but love her--and her sweet and kooky character did a lot to carry this film. As for the plot, it's quite good -- Highly recommend.

It's a fun movie! It moves and rides on fun. Boring if you are looking for drama and drama tension; if it is your cup of tea, it is relaxing and refreshing as a straight-forward script and a charming actress lift your spirits by doing the little things--thinking of others, foiling plots, and finally, a couple of silly twists at the film's climax.",1468108800,,606,4.893203883495145

And a young Dirk Bogarde is adorable. It is a silly little fluff of a film, very much like THE MOUSE THAT ROARED.

4534038,3,B0053O022O,"I watched this when I couldn't sleep and it was a relatively pleasant way to dawdle away an hour or so.  However,
I found it quite pompous of the two Americans to come in and play princess and consort to another country.  I
realize after WWII that Americans were proud of themselves for helping Europeans save the world, but the idea
that every country after that war was subserviant to the US, had few good ideas of their own, were stuck in their old ways, and couldn't help themselves leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I guess the best attitude is to laugh at it.

There were some humourous snippets, usually not the ones leaned on by the director. The reprise of the banquet number on the road to smuggling scheeze was hilarious.  And I simply hooted at the hair.",1447632000,,765,4.397163120567376

This movie is full of quirky characters including the lead and a must see for any classic movie fan. This is truly a fun vintage British comedy!,1415404800,8,430,4.2560975609756095

Google did not help me at all to find it with the bits I remembered.
Now its a real treasure to me and I love all the detailed humour in it. It was even better than I remembred.
The only thing I missed were other language versions.",1354752000,2,455,4.010989010989011
4534100,4,B0053O022O,"PENNY PRINCESS (1952) is a delightful British comedy, seemingly cut from the same cloth as THE MOUSE THAT ROARED.

Yolande Donlan plays a ditzy, blonde New York shop girl who inherits a massive fortune from a very distant relative that she didn't even know existed.  Among the assets of the estate is an extremely small European country that is flat broke and whose principal industry is smuggling.  Ms. Donlan travels to that small state and is immediately declared to he its ruler, but now she has to devise a plan to put the country on a firm financial footing.

Dirk Bogarde co-stars a cheese salesman for a large British corporation, who encounters Yolande and, after a few romantic misunderstandings, helps her achieve her goal.

There is so much to enjoy in this movie.  It has a clever, satiric story, witty dialogue and the cast is quite likable.  Indeed, Ms. Donlan, a Judy Holliday type who played BORN YESTERDAY on the London stage, is absolutely charming and one can't help but wonder why she did not have a major film career.

Perhaps it is because she had a long marriage to the film's writer-director, Val Guest, and chose family over career?

My only complaint with PENNY PRINCESS is that it ends very abruptly.  Suddenly, a character rushes in with a telegram...and ""everything"" is resolved.  It almost feels like the production company ran out of money and they were forced to wrap everything up immediately.

That reminds me of a story that I heard Huntz Hall tell years ago.  Huntz was, of course, one of the Bowery Boys, and their movies were shot in 7 (?) days.  One of these low budget quickies was going into overtime on the 7th day when the producer, Ben Schwalb,  called ""That's a wrap!""

""Ben,"" Huntz objected, ""we've still got ten pages of script to shoot.""

""Nobody'll ever miss them,"" Schwalb said.

He was probably right, but PENNY PRINCESS is not a Bowery Boys movie, and I'd really like to have seen how Guest had originally planned to end this often laugh-out-loud comedy.

VCI Entertainment is releasing this nicely restored film onto DVD.
