8129149,1,B000G6MFEM,"A satanic cult in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey was run by LeVar. There were men that called him ""Clinton."" Most likely an homage to Clinton, N.J. The church took over the cult site and a decade later is running a summer school for four bad girls. The girls are diverse.

The film is designed to appeal to the male fantasy with a spanking, a school girl strip tease, shower scene, and a tied up stripped girl. It is 55 minutes long plus out-takes. It is low budget with some good tunes and a bad piano. Don't worry about a rewind if you missed a scene because at 40 minutes into the film a girl has a dream which recaps everything except for all too frequent shots of the outside of the church and cemetery. They apparently didn't want to market a ""short"" so they added tons of useless filler.
