2828169,5,B000PUAIOS,"To all the yoga fans who have yet to purchase Dr Yoga House Call and Yoga Quick Fixes - please, do yourselves the favour and order them now!

Ravi and Ana's latest DVDs have so much to offer, you'll be doing new combinations for months. I particularly love Dr Yoga House Call because:

1. there are some challenging sets (especially Strong Bones and Muscle Tone);
2. although there are many short sets to choose from, you can also do a longer, awesome workout by starting with the warm-up and just letting the DVD play on;
3. there are many new yoga poses (and I have all their DVDs);
4. Ana does a lot of the narration and her comments about alignment are very helpful;
5. Ana's snaking cobra is something to aspire to!

I do, however, prefer the quick sets in Yoga Quick Fixes, especially Energy to Burn (12 minutes) and the Superset (22 minutes). I think beginners will find these quick sets very accessible.",1191628800,22,911,4.509090909090909
2828170,5,B000PUAIOS,I bought this DVD after purchasing Yoga Quick Fixes and have fallen in love with video too.  I yet to complete all the practices but I am sure I will also love the ones I haven't done yet.  Great great great!,1191369600,5,208,4.048780487804878
2828171,5,B000PUAIOS,"I have always wanted a Yoga DVD I can do.  I have never been flexible, but by doing the DVD's by Ravi and Ana help me achieve not only more flexibility, but a overall better feeling. Ms. Brett expression is of joy; stress free and happy; Mr. Singh's voice is soothing and expressive.  A winning combination.  They make a workout not a workout but something that is truly different and pleasing.",1190073600,7,394,4.52112676056338
2828172,5,B000PUAIOS,"I just finished another set from Yoga House Calls. I did The Tune In, Energy Warm Ups, Health & Happiness Quick Set and Closing Prayer. Took about 35 min. total. Nice set!  like all the ones I have tried. Their is no matrix but I, for one, am so glad since I had a DVD with a matrix and ended up never using it. I got so frustrated trying to figure it out! There are endless options here. Some are more challenging, some more relaxing. All are fun and as usual in Ana & Ravi fashion easy to follow with first rate instruction. The music is even better than their last DVD's which I did not think was possible.
PS: My mom is using the arthritis set and it has not oly helped her range of motion but her whole mood is brightened. Everything we have tried works!",1188000000,21,759,4.128378378378378
2828173,5,B000PUAIOS,"I love this DVD and Yoga House Calls.  I have completed most of the individual sets.  I start with the Tune In and then complete a Warm-Up. After the Warm-Up, I just let the DVD go until I have to stop to relax and meditate.  Sometimes I practice for 30 minutes sometimes for 90 minues and this is the flexiblity that you would have with these DVD's.  I have also completed a timed session by just tuning in and finishisng on of the quick sets. I really enjoy the quick sets they are fast and fun!  Aside from the convenience, the exercises, meditations and relaxation leave you feeling like you can start the day on a very positive note!  I have most of this series and I will continue to rotate these two new DVD's in and out of my rotations.  Great job Ravi and Ana.  Thank you for putting these together!",1186099200,14,808,4.269736842105263

If you are really looking to improve your health, lose weight or simply explore this art of Yoga take my advice and give their DVDs a shot, I bet you won't be dissapointed, they are better than any instructor led class.

2828186,4,B000PUAIOS,"Previously I had picked out the breath primer and then one or two of the Dr. Yoga Remedy Sections.  I was interested in the Fertility and Potency section based on the recommendation of another reviewer.  This is a little tedious as there is no Matrix, but worth the effort.

However, today I found out that there is actually over TWO and a HALF hours of material (not including the Yoga Quick Sets)!  Yes, I needed to distract myself and figured that I would just let it play one section after another and I was amazed.  There are exercises that I would not normally pick for myself (like Anti-Arthritis and Heart Helper) which were actually very helpful.  There is a strong emphasis on working on the lymphatic system with these and other Dr. Yoga Remedy sections. There was good ab work across several sections.  I found the Brain Booster section a hoot.  You have to rotate one hand going clockwise and the other one counterclockwise, like patting your head and rubbing your tummy.  It was mentally challenging.  They said during the narration that anytime you do movements across the body (even if it raking leaves), it balances both sides of the brain.  I found Eagle Eyes very interesting in that not only does it work on the muscles to improve vision, but also the optic nerve which feeds input into the central nervous system.

There are three mediation sections: The Amazing Minute Breath, So Darshan Chakra Kriya, and Sat Ta Na Ma Meditation.  I found the first two which included alternate nostril breathing (again, balances the brain) to be incredibly relaxing and soothing, however the Sat Ta Na Ma meditation dragged on a little too long for my taste.

The main menus includes Tune In, Breath Primer, Energy Warm Ups (14), Dr Yoga Remedy, Yoga Quick Sets, 3 Amazing Meditations, and Closing Prayer.  For The Dr. Yoga Remedy, Yoga Quick Sets, and Mediation sections you have to click, which takes you off the main menu, to select.

The Dr. Yoga Remedy sections are as follows:
Fertility & Potency (10 min)
Bye Bye Back Pain (11)
Strong Bones & Muscle Tone (13)
Anti-Arthritis (9 min)
Heart Helper (12)
Breast Cancer Prevention (4)
Brain Booster (13 min)
Eagle Eyes (10 min)
Inflamation Relief (6 min)

The additional premixed Yoga Quick Sets seem to sample from the sections above.

Move Energy Move Your Life (10)
Flexible and Free (16)
Strong as Steel (13)
Health & Happiness (16)
Kundalini Super set (34)

If you can hang on until the end, Anna does a little dance with the caption saying ""Celebrate, You are Divine"".  It really put a smile on my face.  The music throughout the DVD is fun and funky and their voices are very soothing making for an enjoyable experience.

I think this is a worthwhile DVD with plenty of material to play around with and explore.  You really get your monies worth. My only minor complaint (and hence deduction of one star) is that having the Matrix like their other DVDS would open up much more possibilities and make the DVD more user friendly.",1354579200,3,2993,4.702495201535509
2828187,5,B000PUAIOS,"Ravi & Ana's Kundalini Yoga DVDs are addictive (in the best sense of positive addiction). Here you will find yoga remedies that address common physical and mental complaints which are well-arranged and easy to do. Kundalini Yoga is not the yoga we have all been exposed to in the past. Its results are remarkable, and thanks to Ravi & Ana's light touch (not detracting in any way from the excellent instruction), everything is really made pretty easy to do. About three hours of material is arranged in several menus (explained in the booklet) for individual needs. This is one of the best all-around yoga practice DVDs on the market, worth far more than the purchase price! Check this one out!",1331510400,,694,4.791666666666667
2828188,5,B000PUAIOS,"I love all of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, but this one created a miracle for me. I had been trying to get pregnant for over a year, and I started the Fertility & Potency work out, and two months later I was preganant!! Yipee!

LOVE the music on this DVD.

Thank you Ana and Ravi for saving my life!",1316649600,7,291,3.9152542372881354
2828189,5,B000PUAIOS,"I reckon these two created a fabulous symbiosis! His voice guides you beautifully through all the moves and if you are not too sure you can see Ana showing you  the asanas. I love their Kundalini Yoga, because it allows you your own pace, accommodates for your level ( I practiced Iyingar and Astanga Yoga for 9 years intensively- was a normal 38 year old when I started..) and leaves you with a feeling that you did something really beautiful, healthy and nourishing.. They are WONDERFUL!",1313020800,,489,4.686046511627907
2828190,5,B000PUAIOS,"Another awesome DVD from the raviana team! I am a busy busy Mom and I got this for the short sections. My favorite is the Kundalini Yoga superset which is just 30 minutes, but there are so many wonderful options (ie. Stong Bones & Muscle Tone). I also like the fertility and potency because, not only do I want to stay fertile as long as possible, but it leaves me feeling stretchy and relaxed so its a great PM set for me.
Other favorite DVDs with short sections are Fat Free Yoga (which helped me get rid of my belly) and Yoga Quick Fixes.
These programs have been life changing for me!",1281052800,5,588,4.258928571428571
2828191,5,B000PUAIOS,"I e-mailed Ana & Ravi in March of 2009 for their recommendations on how to get pregnant (I'm 38 and we've been trying to have a second child for 2 1/2 years). Nothing we tried prior to that worked. They suggested the Fertility and Potency segment on this DVD. So, with nothing to lose, I included it in my raviana DVD workout rotation, 3x per week. I also, per their suggestion, did Fat Free Yoga twice per week (for its work on the glands). They also asked me to cut down on coffee, sugar, and to try to gravitate towards a more alkaline diet. Within 3 months it worked, I was pregnant (and it all went smoother than my first time, thanks to my Kundalini Yoga practice!) and we are now proud parents of a healthy baby boy (Connor). I am so very grateful to Ana & Ravi. If you know anyone who's trying to conceive, please alert them to these comments! Yours Truly, Dee",1280966400,18,868,4.266666666666667
2828192,3,B000PUAIOS,"This DVD is very similar to Yoga Quick Fixes.  The format:
**tune in
**breath primer
**warm-up
**yoga sections for particular ailments like back pain, arthritis, and  inflammation.
**yoga sets
**deep relaxation
**3 meditations
**closing prayer.

What I liked about this workout:
**the clean, white set made it easy to focus on Ana and the exercises.
**the versality. You can easily pick and choose which sections you want to do.

What I didn't like about this workout:
**it's very repetitive since it consists of previously released sections.
**it doesn't flow; it feels more like a disjointed series of exercise, even with the yoga sets.

If you are looking for a Kundalini yoga workout that can help address some common maladies, then this DVD might be for you.  This is not a good DVD for an introduction to traditional Kundalini yoga however.  I recommend Ravi and Ana's other Kundalini yoga DVDs for that.",1280275200,2,910,4.986754966887418
2828193,4,B000PUAIOS,"I'm a fan of the growing research on meditation. In Newberg/Waldman's very interesting book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-God-Changes-Your-Brain-Breakthrough-Findings-from-a-Leading-Neuroscientist/dp/0345503422/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How God Changes Your Brain: Breakthrough Findings from a Leading Neuroscientist</a>, the authors tell the story of middle-aged Gus, who was taught the 12-minute version of the sa-ta-na-ma meditation included on this video (as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Quick-Fixes-Ana-Brett-Ravi-Singh/dp/B000PUAIOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Quick Fixes - Ana Brett & Ravi Singh</a>). After eight weeks of practice, Gus showed greater clarity of mind, empathy, and improved his working memory by half. Turns out, there have also been studies on this meditation for Alzheimer's patients with promising results. The authors theorize that meditation that includes multiple modes (chanting/singing, visualization and repetitive movement used in kirtan kriya) may stimulate your brain in more powerful (or, at least, numerous) ways than more passive forms of meditation.

I'd bought several raviana DVDs a while back, and some clicked with me more than others, but they all started gathering dust because, frankly, repeat viewings made all the amazing health claims raviana speak of during the practice sound like a con job. (Encouragment is great, but don't insult my intellgence, especially when an obese Yogi Bhajan died of heart failure at a relatively young 75). After reading Newberg's book, I thought, hey, I have a DVD of that meditation, dusted them off and started using them again. Personally, I prefer House Call over Quick Fixes, because if I'm in the mood I can use the last several sets on House Call as sort of an extended multi-modal meditation (immune invigorator, brain booster, eagle eyes, inflammation relief) before the three meditations, ending with the 12-minute sa-ta-na-ma meditation. It's a great version (the same on both DVDs) -- the single notes are perfect, and raviana's singing gives you a couple of different octaves to sing along with. The lack of the Matrix option on both of these DVDs is odd, considering these DVDs would benefit the most from the Matrix option.

I'd recommend either DVD just for the kirtan kriya, even if you're not interested in the yoga. For those of you who tend to skip the ""chanting"" parts of raviana DVDs, I'd recommend Newberg's book. The title is misleading -- the authors make no claims about God, as both are agnostic scientists -- but the information on the impact of spiritual practices on your brain is pretty interesting, and may even inform the effects some report from a kundalini yoga practice, with its ""multi-modal"" repetitive movements and integrated breathwork.",1268784000,7,2873,5.953995157384988
2828194,5,B000PUAIOS,"This is my fifth Kundalini yoga DVD by Ana and Ravi, and it is awesome. The only thing missing is the matrix menu, but whenever I do it I want to do the whole thing.

My only complaint is on the list of topics covered on the DVD cover, it doesn't match with the menu items on the actual DVD.  They are two different lists.

So, if you have that one, you don't really need this one.  There are a few different exercises, but, it seems like they just cut and pasted from one DVD to the next.  The voice overs are kinda strange, too.  As if they just added new stuff here and there.  That is why I only gave 3 stars.

This is a good beginner to intermediate (I would imagine advanced yogis (if they actually exist would benefit too) workout with very little breath of fire, and I would recommend it to anyone at any level.

2828202,4,B000PUAIOS,"Dr. Yoga House Call is one of the latest offerings from the husband/wife team of Ravi Singh/Ana Brett. In the same style as their previous videos, House Call features Ana alone on screen, practicing on a small rug in an all-white room, while she and Ravi take turns providing voiceover instruction. You'll recognize some of the music and yoga sequences from their previous videos, but there's plenty that's brand new here as well.

Like its sister video, Yoga Quick Fixes, Dr. Yoga House Call has over 3 hours of footage, which provides wonderful variety but can feel a bit overwhelming. The Main Menu offers the following options:

*Play DVD
*Tune In
*Breath Primer
*Energy Warm-Ups (14 minutes)
*Dr. Yoga Remedy Options
*Dr. Yoga Quick Sets
*Deep Relaxation
*3 Amazing Meditations
*Closing Prayer

The Main Menu leads to several sub-menus as described below.
Dr. Yoga Remedy Options:
Fertility & Potency (10m), Bye Bye Back Pain (11m), Strong Bones & Muscle Tone (13m), Anti-Arthritis (9m), Heart Helper (12m), Breast Cancer Prevention (4m), Immune Invigorator (7m), Brain Booster (13m), Eagle Eyes (10m), Inflammation Relief (6m)
Dr. Yoga Quick Sets:
Move Your Energy Move Your Life! (10m), Flexible & Free (16m), Strong as Steel (13m), Health & Happiness (16m), Kundalini Yoga Superset (34m)
3 Amazing Meditations
Amazing Minute Breath (6m), So Darshan Chakra Kriya (3.5m), Sa-Ta-Na-Ma Meditation (14m) [These same meditation sequences also appear on Ravi and Ana's other new release, Dr. Yoga House Call.]

As you can see, House Calls offers sets designed to address more chronic conditions--unlike Quick Fixes, which focuses on more common, transient issues.  I also found the practices on House Call to be more active than on Quick Fixes, including more use of Breath of Fire and more arm movements, which made the practices feel pretty challenging at times.

If you are a die-hard Ana/Ravi fan, you will probably want to add both this DVD and Quick Fixes to your collection.  However, if (like myself) you are more of a dabbler in Kundalini Yoga, you may prefer Quick Fixes, which in my opinion contained practices that were more generalizable as well as a bit less strenuous.

In summary, this is a well-done, well-produced DVD of energizing Kundalini yoga practices, and I give it a final rating of 4 1/2 stars.",1201219200,77,2321,5.073490813648294

In the second part, I'll say some more general things about Ana and Ravi and kundalini yoga. It seems the negative reviews of their DVDs come mainly from people who didn't know what to expect when ordering kundalini yoga DVDs -- because they ARE a little bit different from what you're used to, if you've only practiced hatha yoga in the past. I am unabashedly an Ana and Ravi fan, but hopefully my evaluation will help you make the correct decision for yourself, even if your opinion happens not to be the same as mine.

----------
Part I
----------

Unlike most of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, Dr. Yoga House Call does not have the matrix menu which normally allows you to customize the length of your workout. You will need to keep your DVD remote handy if you want to do more than one segment in a sitting. All physical exercises in this DVD are done equally on both sides of the body.

Note: there is some repeated content from ""Yoga Quick Fixes,"" especially the meditations.  However, this DVD is focused on a different set of conditions/difficulties.  I didn't notice a huge difference with any of the conditions I was working on after two weeks, but maybe it takes more time.  If you are just looking for some different yoga sets to try, many of these are unusual compared to Ana's and Ravi's other yoga sets, so it's still worth a try.

Tune In (2:16): This segment is similar/the same in many of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs; you sit cross-legged, focus on your breathing, and chant ""ong namo guru dev namo"" three times.

Breath Primer (4:35): If you are not familiar with kundalini yoga, you will definitely want to follow along here. It's actually a pretty good refresher for anyone who has practiced for awhile, as well. You learn how to do long deep breathing, a panting breath that serves as an introduction to breath of fire, and then a standard breath of fire technique.

Energy Warm-Ups (14): This is a long warm-up for one of Anas and Ravis DVDs. Although some content in this DVD is the same as Ana's and Ravi's ""Yoga Quick Fixes,"" the warm-up is different.  This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Walk in place, bringing alternate hands to the sternum
*Seated, with your hands on your shoulders, take your elbows and head back, then bring them forward; repeat
*Lying, have one foot on the ground with the leg bent, stretch the other leg by holding behind your thigh with the leg in the air
*Lying, bring your legs straight up, then take them out to the sides, close to the ground, and hold inside your thighs
*Support yourself on your elbows, with your rear end on the ground, and do alternate leg lifts
*Have your hands at shoulder level, index fingers under thumbs, bring your arms straight up and then down again; repeat

Dr. Yoga Remedy Options: These segments claim to be helpful with a variety of ailments, mostly chronic conditions (like arthritis). Take the health claims with a grain of salt (the DVD does start with a disclaimer about health claims coming from traditional sources). I find Ana and Ravi to be spot on when it comes to skeletal issues. However, I am not sure how much I believe when they talk about the glands, for example. Also, please do not use this DVD as a substitute for seeing a doctor. That being said, the program in this DVD should not be harmful when used as a supplement to other medical treatment.

I believe the point of these short segments is to do whatever one you need at the time. I will warn you, though, that most of them do not constitute full yoga workouts (with warm-up, deep relaxation, etc.).  On the one hand, this is a great time saver. On the other hand, please be careful and don't overextend yourself. Do the warm-up segment if you need it!

Fertility and Potency (10): You'll recognize some of the exercises here from other Ana and Ravi DVDs.  I believe at least some of the footage is recycled, as well.

*Crow pose with breath of fire
*Butterfly pose
*On your hands and knees, raise opposite hand and leg, then pump your leg up and down while holding your breath

Bye Bye Back Pain (11): This segment consists of the following exercises.  What I like about it is that it touches on all areas of back health, including pelvic alignment and core strength.

*Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat
*Lunge pose with back knee on the ground
*On your back, inhale and straighten your arms and legs, exhale and bring alternate knees into the body (meet the head if possible)

Eagle Eyes (10): This one made me laugh a bit, since at one point it mentions putting off getting reading glasses.  (I've worn glasses for over 30 years.

Yoga Quick Sets: These are accessible from the main menu and are somewhat comparable to the pre-set selections that appear on some of Ravis and Anas other DVDs. These are combinations of moves from other segments on the DVD and are intended to be short, complete kundalini yoga workouts. I won't go over them again since the content has already been described elsewhere. If youd rather not keep your DVD remote handy, these might be a good solution to the issue of combining exercises from shorter segments on the DVD.

Deep Relaxation (6): This is similar in many of Ravi's and Ana's DVDs. Lie on your back, slow your breathing, and listen to Ravi.

3 Amazing Meditations: You get three different meditation sections to choose from on this DVD. All of them are classics that youll hear discussed elsewhere, especially if you buy more of Anas and Ravis DVDs or subscribe to their e-mail newsletter.  These are identical to the meditations on ""Yoga Quick Fixes.""

Amazing Minute Breath (6:14): Inhale, hold your breath, and exhale. The goal is to work up to each inhalation, hold, and exhalation taking 20 seconds (for a total of one minute per breath).

So Darshan Chakra Kriya (3:36): Block your right nostril, inhale with your left. Pump your stomach to the rhythm wahay guru (spoken by Ravi). Exhale with your right nostril. Repeat.

Sa-Ta-Na-Ma Meditation (6:30): Press your thumbs to your index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and little finger, in turn, while saying sa ta na ma (one sound per finger touch). You start out singing, then whispering, then finally just thinking sa ta na ma in your head. The music in this section leaves a little to be desired. Its just a synthesizer (or something along those lines) and its not very good. This is the only segment where I have a complaint about the music, though.

Closing Prayer (2:16): This is similar to what appears in other Ravi/Ana DVDs.

For those of you familiar with Ravi's and Ana's DVDs, this is one of the ones with the pink circle rug and flower pattern on the floor, the white background, and dark-haired Ana. I've noticed a lot of the music in those overlaps, as do some of Ana's outfits. Youll recognize a handful of the exercises from other dark-haired Ana DVDs, as well, especially (but not limited to) ""Yoga Quick Fixes."" Much of the music is Ana singing different mantras, and I generally like it quite a bit. This DVD does not involve a ton of mantra chanting (performed by the participants at home as well as on the part of the narrators) as described above, but there is a little, and other mantras are done mentally.

Some of the segments are pretty meditation/visualization heavy (i.e., Inflammation Relief).  If I was doing yoga in the morning after just having gotten up, I sometimes had trouble staying awake during the non-physical segments.  So keep that in mind.

If you like breath work, you get all types here. Its great to see the range of what can be incorporated into a kundalini yoga practice, when it comes to breathing. The camera work is OK but not great (too many fades in and out and too much focusing on sometimes odd parts of Anas body). The sound is usually quite good but there are a few times when Ravis voiceover sounds tinny, for lack of a better word, like he's talking over an intercom or microphone.  (At other times, he sounds fine.  And this never happens with Ana's voice.)

Ana and Ravi do offer some suggestions for modifications of certain poses -- for example, frog instead of crow. And don't forget -- you don't have to keep up with Ana. Work at your own pace. (I have to bend my knees in the second warmup exercise performed on the back, for example -- my hamstrings are too tight for me to straighten my legs, there.)

Part II

Now, on to a more general discussion of kundalini yoga in general, and Ana's and Ravi's DVDs in particular.

Most of the yoga that people are familiar with falls under the umbrella of hatha yoga. Perhaps you've done a series of static poses, or some vinyasa/flow yoga. Kundalini yoga is not exactly like either of these, although Ana's and Ravi's DVDs do incorporate elements of hatha yoga (e.g., this DVD has camel pose in it). However, kundalini yoga is also what I would consider to be a very active form of yoga, consisting of some repeated movements and a lot more work with the breath than you may be used to. It can be difficult to keep up with at first, but can be very rewarding if you stick with it. If you are bored of holding static poses all the time, or if you want a bit more movement but hate vinyasa (sorry, but I am not a fan of flow yoga), kundalini might really work well for you. And, as I said earlier, use the modifications Ana and Ravi discuss if you need to use them. Yes, Ana is fit (and this makes her an excellent demonstrator for the poses), but this is not a competition. Don't strain yourself, and don't try to keep up with her. Just try to improve a little bit every time!

Kundalini yoga also involves a lot of meditation. Sometimes this is quiet and involves breathing either in a sitting position or lying down, occasionally with your hands in a mudra (hand position). Sometimes it involves chanting a mantra. This DVD does not have a lot of chanting, but it has a little. If you are uncomfortable with mantras for religious reasons, check out Ana's and Ravi's website (can't post links in reviews but they're easy to find through Google) for alternatives.

With respect to calorie-burning, this is probably not the sort of program that will make you shed a ton of weight. What it is good for, is improving your mood and your flexibility. And as a physical activity, it does burn some calories and strengthen some parts of your body. But kundalini yoga works on your inner self as well as your outer self, and so some parts are a little less ""active"" than others. For my own part, I still do plenty of pretty intense cardio at other times of the day.  If you expect to see some positive results from the exercises in this DVD, you had better be prepared to wait for awhile.  It won't be a dramatic overnight transition.

Ana's outfits are a bit skimpy, but certainly nothing less than you would see at the beach. And the reason she dresses like she does is so that you can really see her performing the movements and asanas. That way you know exactly how to position yourself for maximum benefit. (Most of the time, kundalini yoga is done with the eyes closed, anyway.) There is not a lot in the way of initial instruction in this DVD. If you are familiar with Ana's and Ravi's work, you can jump right in. But if you are new to kundalini yoga, watch it first. Observe Ana, listen to the cues, make sure you understand. You'll be glad for the lack of excessive instruction later -- you don't want to be told on the 20th time you do a DVD how to do camel; you know it by this point!

If you are struggling with a pose, or don't feel there's an adequate explanation, Ravi and Ana are very accessible and quite nice. They have contact information on their website (the URL is on the DVD case) and usually get back to you in a couple of days. They also have a monthly e-mail newsletter that I enjoy.",1416787200,3,15543,4.578378378378378

This is especially nice if you are limited on time, yet want to work on one area of concern. If you have more time to spend it has longer segments that incorporate many of the short segments into them. If you have the time, these slightly longer segments are definitely worth doing, and make you feel great. Each of the Raviana DVDs that I own, have a Deep Relaxation Segment. The one is House Calls is my very favorite. This one makes me feel so-o relaxed and peaceful.",1382745600,,597,4.292035398230088
