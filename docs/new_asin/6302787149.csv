509741,5,6302787149,I really love this movie.  I had this movie on VHS and since I got rid of my VHS library I have been slowly updating it with DVD and Blue-Ray.  You'll really enjoy  owning this movie,1366156800,,182,4.0
509742,2,6302787149,"Suspension of belief improved viewing & Alec Baldwin ""overplayed"" his character.  Think I let the cover ""take me in"" on this one.",1361404800,,129,4.863636363636363
509743,2,6302787149,"I  read  that  this  was  such  a  terrific  show.  One  of  Alec  Balwins' best  achievements.  I  was  excited  when  it  came,  because  I  thought  it  was  going  to  be  really  good.  It  was  really boring.  And  the  actors  that  were  in  the  movie,  being  top  of  the  line  names  in  movies  &  television  went  through  the  movie  like  they  were  sleep-walking.  Poor  performances  on  all  their  parts. I  was  very  disappointed.",1360368000,,455,4.47887323943662
509744,3,6302787149,I bought the DVD to replace an old VHS tape that had been on the shelf for years. The level of intrigue was quite ordinary twenty years later.,1360108800,,142,4.107142857142857
509745,4,6302787149,"I remember seeing this on TV many years ago. I always love a good mystery and especially when it stars some of my favorite actors like Lloyd Bridges, Hal Holbrook and a very young Alec Baldwin. I had previously searched for a DVD copy but it was only available on VHS and since I ""retired"" my VCR's years ago I figured I'd wait and hope for the DVD. The wait paid off.",1353715200,3,368,4.125
509746,4,6302787149,"I personally have not seen this yet, but hope to get my hands on one of these videos!  The mixed reviews I have heard are from friends of mine who have either seen it or were a part of it.  This movie was filmed on location in Roswell, NM at the New Mexico Military Institute(NMMI).  I am an alum of the 'Tute and though was not attending while this was filmed, I can attest that it was filmed with actual cadets as extras and on the campus of an actual military school.  NMMI was created in 1891 in the New Mexico Territory and has been a pivotal institution in Western United States history.  Many officers of our nations military has graduated from there.  Some celebrities have also attended there; Roger Staubach, Owen Wilson, etc.  It continues today as a 4 year high school, 2 year junior college military boarding school that has a top notch education curriculum and continues to produce high caliber leaders and innovators.",1316131200,,932,4.578313253012048
509747,5,6302787149,"This video deals with a miltary school in the 1960's. A cadethas died. The miltary are looking into the matter. Everyone issuspect. Alec Baldwin plays a cadet who gets set up during the trial of his fellow cadet. The movie is fast as the miltary is trying to avoid a media frenzy on the base.  This movie also deals with gays and the miltary. There is a slight hint that maybe the cadet was killed by a gay lover. Of course the miltary back then would not like this stuff out to the media. The movie is a very suspenseful thriller in the 1960's! This video features an an all star cast Alec Baldwin(The Hunt For Red Ocober,Mecury Rising),Lane Smith(Superman TV series)Lloyd Bridges(the hot shot movies) and others! look for some up and coming stars in this video as well!",954028800,14,771,4.507142857142857

509808,2,6302787149,"I like the movie, HOWEVER, I have strong hunch that this movie was not originally made for DVD format and that it was copied poorly off of VHS tapes.  I got to watch the first part in it's entirety with NO glitches BUT the last 20 to 30 minutes of the 2nd part of the movie was pausing and skipping,  I even checked the disk for scratches or any kind of blemishes and found not even a little nick here or there.  We pay good money for these products, we shouldn't have to go through CRAP like THIS!  THANKS!",1458172800,,507,4.090909090909091

509815,4,6302787149,"Ben waiting for this movie on DVD for decades. Good story, a young Alec Baldwin is excellent in his role. I hate spoilers, so no plot details. Well worth the sale price of less than $15.00. Enjoy",1419120000,,195,4.297297297297297

509844,5,6302787149,"This is a great adaptation of Lucian Truscott's novel (Gore Vidal did the screenplay).  I've had it on VHS for years and just recently found it on DVD.  This was a mini series on TV back in 1986.  Great cast: Hal Holbrook, Eddie Arnold, Alec Baldwin an Susan Hess are all terrific.  It's an excellent ""Whodunit"" that is as enjoyable to watch now as it was nearly 30 years ago.",1390867200,,376,4.328571428571428
509845,5,6302787149,"It's kind of cheesy in that 80's made-for-tv kind of way, but it was filmed at my school and I see myself and some of my friends in the background.  I remember the filming and it takes me back to the good ol' days.  Despite the ""controversial"" topic, especially for the time, it's well done and even my folks enjoyed it.  You'll have fun watching your favorite actors.  Lots in there!",1377820800,3,384,4.366197183098592
509846,5,6302787149,I couldn't wait finally the mini series from the 80s that I always heard about.  No idea that Gore Vidal wrote the screen play.  I was totally stunned that it actually dealt with homosexuality.  It was amazing.,1377561600,,210,4.621621621621622
509847,5,6302787149,"This film has stood the test of time.  I had the original in VHS and wanted the DVD version.  I have watched this over the years many times and it is always just as good as the first time I viewed it.  I would recommend this film to all.  The Actors/Acting is really good and the storyline is intriguing, a murder/mystery including some romance.  A Military School where some in charge try to suppress incidents and people, an unwanted engagement/war (Vietnam), and the price we pay for privacy and freedom.",1376697600,,507,4.588888888888889
