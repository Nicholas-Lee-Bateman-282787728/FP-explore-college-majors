5077649,5,B007CK89BS,"People throw around the words ""this changed my life"" a lot.  I am not usually one of those people.  But I feel compelled to write about BeMoved's Bollywood Dance DVD - and the only words that keep coming to my to mind (as trite as they are) is that this DVD really did change my life.  I've had back surgery twice over the last 15 years I and have always been afraid to even attempt to work out to a dance DVD until a friend who took Sherry's BeMoved class in Chicago told me about her experience.
I bought the DVD and ever-so-gently approached the dance moves. And each day that I did the workout, I began to stop thinking about my past injuries - and instead focus on how much better I began to feel and how much I loved that I was working up a sweat.
All I can say is thank you Sherry! You've changed my mindset. You've changed body. And you've changed the amount of hope I have for a healthier life in the future.",1339459200,,917,4.111731843575419
5077650,5,B007CK89BS,"Sherry Zunker has developed a dance program that made me feel like I was dancing from the beginning to end.  The warm up is elegant and expressive and gently engages the whole body building on one movement to the other.  The tutorial is very informative and you understand Sherry's intention for each movement.  Unlike most fitness DVD's the ""workout"" is the icing on the cake.  The real gem is the wonderful dance combination which builds slowly and steadily. Ultimately the whole combination is revealed and the sense of accomplishment is very satifying. The whole body is engaged and I can tell it is toning my arms, core and legs.  Plus, I can't help smiling the whole time. I can't wait for the next release.",1339459200,,713,4.717741935483871
5077651,5,B007CK89BS,"I have been a BeMoved student for a couple of years now and it is the best dance class I have ever taken.  Like a lot of people, I am an ""enthusiastic amateur"" and BeMoved hits just the right balance - great music, great movements, challenging without being stressful at all.  I picked up the BeMoved DVD around the holidays.  It's a really good workout tape - you are dancing and sweating, learning some fun moves and enjoying fun and lively music.  A great workout in about 45 minutes without weights, gym shoes or mats.  Try it!  You'll like it!",1339459200,2,548,4.43
5077652,5,B007CK89BS,"BeMoved Bollywood is SO amazing! I love it!  If you like to dance, or like Bollywood and thought ""yeah, but I can't do that....""  YES You Can!  SO FUN.  The moves are broken down so they're easy to follow and the music is amped up fabulous.  Try it!",1339372800,2,249,4.104166666666667
5077653,5,B007CK89BS,BeMoved is a beautiful program.  I was astonished that I got a full-body workout from the low-impact movement.  The dance curriculum is so smartly crafted to engage my whole body and even my mind and spirit!  I found the choreography and the sincerity in its approach so valuable -- truly a product of integrity.,1340064000,3,312,4.7407407407407405
5077654,5,B007CK89BS,"I know that everytime I put this DVD in I will walk away transformed, I feel better about myself and the world. I love the music & I love that my kids join in sparatically. This DVD has become the birthday gift I send to everyone. I'm looking forward to the next release.",1340064000,,271,4.132075471698113
5077655,5,B007CK89BS,"BeMoved is such a joy!  Whether you've ever danced a day in your life or not, you can use this and do this TODAY.  Whether you consider yourself a dancer or not makes no difference.  We're all dancers at heart.  And you don't need to be an expert at anything in life to enjoy yourself.  See for yourself.  BeMoved.  :-)",1339977600,,319,4.216666666666667
5077656,5,B007CK89BS,Loved the upbeat Bollywood music and learning the dance steps of a classic Bollywood movie. I'm ready for my audition!,1339891200,2,118,4.95
5077657,5,B007CK89BS,"I love this DVD. BeMoved is the best dance/fitness experience I've ever had. It's so easy to follow, the music is great and it is so much fun! Anyone can do it regardless of age and you don't need any dance experience. I'm so glad I found this and I highly recommend it to others.",1339632000,2,280,4.109090909090909
5077658,5,B007CK89BS,"I love the BeMoved fitness video. It has added such a ""feel good"" component to my day. It awakens and energizes the body. Thank you!",1339545600,2,132,4.32
5077659,5,B007CK89BS,"This video is wonderful.  The first time I watched it and followed along with the movements, I felt like I was sent back in time to my earlier dancing years.  Both the visual aspect and the audio cues that Sherry gives really carry you through the workout and enable you to truly dance and feel like you are on a stage - right there in your living room!  Also, the breathing techniques and fluid movements help your body and mind relax.  I am always in a better mood after I do this workout.  I would recommend this experience to anyone.",1339459200,,537,4.33
5077660,5,B007CK89BS,"I have always wanted been enchanted by Bollywood dance but couldn't find a class.  This is a perfect at-home solution.  It offers the expertise of renowned choreographer, Sherry Zunker, in an easy-to-follow progression for all ages.  And unlike other fitness videos that require a lot of extra study for you to feel competent, BeMoved Bollywood basics can be mastered in the first viewing. . .although you'll definitely want to work out with this video again and again!",1339459200,2,469,5.064935064935065
5077661,5,B007CK89BS,"I've danced my whole life.  As a senior, however, my dance classes with all those 20-somethings were getting to be a bit too strenuous.  So, I became a BeMoved devotee.  What a wonderful way to dance without risking injury and still get a terrific workout, burn calories, and have FUN doing it.

For all those old-time hoofers, dance wannabees, or anyone who wants a great workout to do at home, the BeMoved DVD is the way to go.  Do the workout alone or get a few friends to join you.  Either way, you won't be disappointed.",1339459200,,525,4.416666666666667
5077662,5,B007CK89BS,"I have really enjoyed this tape, for both the mental and physical workout it provides.  When I finish, I have worked up a sweat and there is a smile on my face.  I wish they would produce some additional tapes, it would be nice to have a choice of music.  I particularly like that she is not trying to talk while she dances, it is much easier to follow with the voice over than most tapes.

The founder of Be Moved, Sherry,  occasionally guest teaches the classes near me and I have attended a couple of them - Wow it is FABULOUS!!! The classes are filled - ranging from professional dancers to those like me who only dance in their own minds.  Everyone is feeling great at the end of class - all are smiling. I don't know how widespread ""Be Moved"" is but its worth a try.",1339459200,,772,4.1824324324324325
8514563,5,B007CK89BS,So relaxing and yet gives you a work out gradually....,1410739200,,54,4.5
8514564,3,B007CK89BS,"BeMoved is an invigorating, fun exercise class that is my favorite and is a five star experience. I have found BeMoved to be very therapeutic for tight shoulders and wonderful to learn so many dance moves and routines. Unfortunately, this DVD does not have the energy of the classes I have taken, nor does it represent the BeMoved  classes well. Hopefully an updated DVD with a different genre will be made!",1384560000,,407,4.732394366197183
8514565,5,B007CK89BS,I loved this workout!  It is the kind of movement that makes a person feel alive!!  I dislike workouts that are just called dance workouts that are really contrived and boring aerobics workouts no different than the ones in the 1980's.  I enjoyed it.,1348876800,,250,4.636363636363637
8514566,5,B007CK89BS,"Sherry Zunker's BeMoved Series One Bollywood DVD is a delight to use.  I hope to find the time to make this a daily experience!  The movements are comfortable but not too easy.  They make you feel like a dancer even it you aren't!  The warm up creates a lightness of being through the breezy arm motions, the gentle breathing and the basic footwork.  The Bollywood section is fun and fast-paced, but Sherry teaches in manageable sections so even a beginner can ""get it"".  The movements build on themselves so you're a pro by the end. A nice review of familiar motions, the cool down allows you to move without thinking too much.  As for the actual production quality, the sound was crisp, the music peaceful and upbeat, and the lighting was just right.  I especially enjoyed Sherry's voice overs.  Her instruction is calm, pleasant, thorough and encouraging.  The members of her demonstration class are friendly (I know one of them personally, so that's particularly cool!) and the camerawork is clear and unobtrusive.  The whole experience was completely enjoyable and I look forward to the next production in the series!",1343606400,,1122,4.883597883597884
8514567,5,B007CK89BS,"I absolutely love BeMoved Bollywood.  I was looking for a way to work the muscles in my arms, shoulders, and upper back without weight-bearing and possibly injuring myself.  (I have some past neck and shoulder injuries.)  This dvd is the way to go for me.  I really feel a nice soreness in my muscles afterwards without any joint pain.  Plus it's great low-impact cardio, with wonderful music.  This dance style is simply too much fun!  Thanks, BeMoved!",1343088000,,453,4.805194805194805
8514568,5,B007CK89BS,"BeMoved really does move you mind, body and soul. I love this DVD its excellent and everyone young or old, dancer or non dancer can follow it with ease. It is well crafted and makes following a cinch.",1343001600,,200,4.2894736842105265
8514569,5,B007CK89BS,"I got this video because a good friend of mine is a certified instructor and in this video. She gave a sample class to our studio, and I thought that finally, I've found a video that I can work with -- with my body that has so many issues from injuries. I can no longer jump, turn, lift my legs higher than 90 degrees, and because of a more recent injury (torn ligament, tendonitis AND plantar fascitis) -- well that creates more difficulties. I loved the workout, because I can truly ""work out"" and feel like I'm dancing (which I can no longer really do!)!! I also love how you incorporate the mind/body (as in yoga) and get a true workout, rather than just trying to copy steps and ""make it work"" (thereby just doing ""movement"" as oppposed to DANCE) I can hardly wait for future videos so that I won't get ""bored"" with this one! Thank you for letting me dance again!",1341878400,,868,4.331288343558282
8514570,5,B007CK89BS,"I am over 60 and not a dancer so I approached the video with trepidation........ but it worked for me. Yippee!!!! The moves were clearly explained and it was not assumed that I already knew everything.  Now, I am much more confident and I feel it has helped my balance and coordination in addition to the cardio and exercise benefits.",1340150400,3,334,4.566666666666666
8514571,5,B007CK89BS,"WOW! I never thought I could move that way for that long and actually look forward to moving that way again. The first time I watched the video I was only going to watch while ensconced on the couch. Very Soon I found myself Being Moved even before I stood up, moved aside the coffee table and rolled up the rug. I even once caught myself repeating a few of the moves while waiting for the morning bus ride to work. Thank you Sherry for your creativity.
WOW! What a great gift this was. I feel better and better after each session and plan on gifting it to others very soon.

8514572,5,B007CK89BS,"I was thrilled with the BeMoved Video I recently received as a gift.
The video was motivating and fun all at the same time.  I particularly loved the music and the fact that I could actually do the exercises, but they didn't seem like ""exercises."" I will order others!",1340064000,3,268,4.469387755102041
