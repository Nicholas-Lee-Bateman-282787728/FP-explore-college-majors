8346130,5,B001VEHOQ2,Great product I was fairly sad that it is no longer being produced and lucky to find it from an Amazon market seller.  He goes very in depth on guard passes and gives excellent view and instruction on what he is doing.  In addition although he is using his twin brother you can clearly see the techniques which is a negative on a lot of bjj instructionals I get where the teacher and his student are in the same color gi and it is much harder to follow.,1497398400,,453,4.136363636363637

8346132,5,B001VEHOQ2,Great dvd! Vicory Belt Delivers. All 8 Discs cover every aspect of the game. There are 8 discs in total 5 Silva discs and 3 Nogueira discs called Mixed Martial Arts the Ultimate Set plus 2 books one by Silva and one by Nogueira. Silva's last two discs will be released soon one in the next month (Muay Thai Clinch) the other a little later (Muay Thai Strikes) and then the Clinch book. Definitly worth it.,1276300800,,405,4.342105263157895
8346133,5,B001VEHOQ2,"I had previously bought the book by Nogueira about MMA Guard, and thought the DVD would just be a rehash of the book, but i was wrong! In a good way though. Like the DVD is titled, it is all about guard passes and shows many techniques for passing full, half, and standing guard, all tailored to MMA. It starts out with defensive and controlling techniques to neutralize attacks and shows a little ground and pound technique. The next sections are all guard passes that are very very helpful to someone needing help in this area. Every move is broken down and shown multiple times in multiple angles so you can see every details of the techniques, Nog does a good job of explaining the moves as he performs them as well.",1256860800,2,720,4.462121212121212

No fighter's ground game is complete without powerful skills for conquering an opponent's guard.  On this disc Antonio Nogueira shares dozens of his battle-proven techniques shot from multiple angles for you to practice and use to demolish any adversary's guard.  This is top-shelf power coaching from the ground master of MMA.

Passing Guard for MMA is broken up into three main parts:

Inside Hooks Guard Passes

Full Guard: Ground &Pound

* Closed Guard Striking (controlling opponent's biceps, and addressing your posture and striking options)
* Guard Control: Following Hips (following opponent's hips to ward off his submissions)
* Guard Control: Throwing Shoulders (another technique to ward off opponent's submissions)
* Guard Control: Trapping Hips (preventing opponent from closing his guard and helping to set up your passing of his guard)
* G'N'P Strategy Review (the Nogueira Brothers grapple to illustrate the application of all above techniques)

Full Guard: Ground Passes
