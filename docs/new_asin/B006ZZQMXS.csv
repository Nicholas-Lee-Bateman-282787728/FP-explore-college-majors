5045488,5,B006ZZQMXS,"...I saw this show when Idina stopped off at the Greek Theatre last fall (2011) for a great night.  Can't wait to buy the CD and the DVD to be able to re-live it anytime.  She was funny, smart, in great voice and a consummate performer!  I'll see her anytime!",1329955200,7,259,4.14
5045489,5,B006ZZQMXS,"I wasn't at this show but I saw Idina on the same tour in London, UK at the Royal Albert Hall and was lucky enough to meet her before the show. She was nothing short of phenomonal. She probably exceeded it. She will never put a foot wrong in my opinion. Her voice is out of the world, her stories are hilarious, just a true pleasure to watch perform. I'll definitely be booking tickets for her summer tour and I cannot wait to watch this DVD and re-live the magic of my evening through her performance in Canada. A must buy for Idina fans and anyone who knows what true talent is.",1329868800,21,580,4.1875
5045490,5,B006ZZQMXS,"I was at the concert and have been waiting for the release of this DVD to relive that wonderful evening. Idina was funny, charming and very entertaining.

5045525,4,B006ZZQMXS,"What fun and what good music. Similar to Kristin Chenoweth in that she has good pipes and a marvelous stage presence. Sometimes CDs are not enough for certain artists: Chenoweth and Menzel. What a wonderful selection of songs and a good move to have Marvin Hamlisch as your conductor. And, like Chenoweth, the dialogue between the music makes this DVD great entertainment. Watch it or just listen. You'll love it.",1441065600,,413,4.914285714285715

You feel like you almost know her by the end. She really enjoys performing, and she really engages the audience. The song choices were mostly familiar, and well suited.

5045627,5,B006ZZQMXS,"I have been fan of Idina ever since Wicked. I never had the chance to see her perform, but adored her on the soundtrack. I also have a couple of her CD's but honestly know so little about her. Of course I always imagine what someone is like, their personality, etc. Wow, she is just an amazing person and I loved how personable she is in this performance. She is a real person and I am so glad I bought this DVD. Oh, Idina is fabulous in CHESS alongside Josh Groban.

5045631,5,B006ZZQMXS,I watched Idina's performance with a friend and couldn't have been more pleasantly entertained. Idina is a phenomenal performer and there was an intimacy with the crowd that I felt while watching at home. Her voice is incredible and I love the way she walks around the stage. There was a guest performance by her husband Taye Diggs and their professional chemistry is a delight. This DVD is a must-purchase for theater lovers.,1377043200,,426,4.8493150684931505
5045642,5,B006ZZQMXS,"Beautiful, talented, funny and, oh yes, a big, powerful yet controlled voice. No wonder she won the Tony for ""Wicked"", she deserved it! We saw her idol, Barbra Streisand in ""Funny Girl"" on Broadway in 1964 and said much the same about her. Idina is every bit a new Streisand but with her own distinctiveness. You will play this over and over and wish for another tat probably will be as good, but maybe not better. She is terrific!",1376265600,,431,4.468354430379747

5045674,4,B006ZZQMXS,"No one is ""impartial,"" but the late pianist Bill Evans once made the striking observation that musicians are the worst critics of their own music because their efforts are so much consumed by the ""mechanics"" of making music that they must strive to achieve the ""naivete"" that is the average, or lay person's, by right:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Mind-DVD/dp/B0002475P2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Mind [DVD</a>]<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Mind-VHS/dp/B000001ZA7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Mind [VHS</a>]. While experiencing Idina Menzel on record for the first time (several weeks ago--and largely as the result of an interest in Broadway musicals resparked by the new ""Porgy and Bess"")--I'm afraid I was at once overly critical from a musician's viewpoint and insufficiently so from the viewpoint of her numerous, vocal fans in whose midst I found myself just the other night.

I had come with little preparation to her concert this week in Milwaukee--some press clippings about Ms. Menzel being the ""new millennium's Barbra Streisand,"" a quick listen to this recording, some cursory research into ""Rent"" and ""Wicked.""  Some observations and impressions:

1.  Menzel has a vocal quality that might be characterized as ""narrow"" (it's more biting and incisive than lush and mellow) and ""youthful"" (it's easy to understand why numerous young people can readily identify with her voice and inspirational songs--about converting obstacles into surmountable challenges.  She represents a universal dream, one which many others are able to live out right alongside her.  She's capable of exceptional projection (the quality that made Ethel Merman the first-choice of the early great Broadway composers, from George Gershwin to Cole Porter"").  I've heard (and accompanied) numerous pop singers who were very strong for the first 5-6 pitches above middle C before encountering a wall of resistance, followed by the need to employ an embarassingly weak ""falsetto.""  Menzel's voice has no such restrictions.  Give her an octave and a half--maybe 2 octaves--above ""middle C,"" and she can be counted on nailing it--with absolute pitch accuracy and clarion, trumpet-like power.

2.  Menzel is a fearless performer (don't kid yourself--that's a requirement, if not a mandate, in this business.  Introverts should look elsewhere for a career or avocation).  She had a large orchestra for support--string and brass sections, a harp, 2 keyboardists, an Apple (disguised) laptop computer--and, I presume, some capable instrumental soloists.  Still, Menzel's unaccompanied voice (""Over the Rainbow"") was the first and, despite numerous thank you's directed toward her supportive case, the last that we heard.  No ""preludes,"" ""overtures,"" ""entr' acts,"" or purely orchestral numbers.  Hers was the first word and the last.  One might say with understatement that, mellow or not, her voice held the crowd for the duration (one hour and 45 minutes--without any intermission).

3.  She comes across as uncompromisingly candid and sincere (though everyone by this time had heard the story about her gay professor).  She talks about her insecurities (not many) and deficiencies (she exudes little ""sex appeal,"" makes her bare feet almost inseparable from a tomboyish persona, yet is forthright about being a recent mother).

4.  She projects a spirit of generosity and ""giving,"" going out into the audience for some ""participatory"" vocalizing and even inviting several audience members to join her (individually) on stage.

5.  As enthusiastic as the seekers of instant fame were, the results indicated the need for more practice on their parts--with the exception of the last performer, who was a young man 2-3 times the size of Ms. Menzel.  He was the only one of the ""amateurs"" who sang like a pro, drawing deep breath reserves from his diaphragm and presenting a vocal image that momentarily threatened to upstage the star's.  Menzel followed up by saying she wouldn't try to emulate his high Ab even as she, ""off-handedly,"" nailed it an octave above the male challenger's.  So there!

6.  As usual, the engineers (i.e. sound men, board operators, mixers) were overly intrusive, spiking Menzel's mic to the point that much of the orchestra became a sporadically audible, unnecessary addition.  Even more offensive (to this listener's overly sensitive ears) was the degree of reverb.  To those unfamiliar with the words going in, there was no guarantee of greater familiarity going out.

7.  As a comparative ""elder"" in the 4th row, my favorite musical moments were exactly three--Arlen's ""Over the Rainbow,"" Bernstein's ""Somewhere,"" and Porter's ""Love for Sale.""  (I'll take my flak like a man--or my woman companion--but it will admittedly be more persuasive if it comes from those whose familiarity with Broadway musical theater extends beyond ""Rent"" and ""Wicked"" to the music of Harold Arlen, Leonard Bernstein, and Cole Porter.)

8.  The most compelling moment for this listener occurred when Idina simply dropped the microphone and sang one of her songs (from ""Rent,"" as I recall) without any benefit of electronic amplification whatsoever--it was an unexpected and ""electric"" moment, allowing the listener to focus exclusively on the moving lyrics of the song (through much of the concert, the volume levels of the performer's voice plus the amplification plus the reverb made it difficult to understand many of the words--which, I realize, would not in the least be a concern of those all around me, who appeared to have them committed to memory long before I'd become familiar with this talented and highly ""qualified"" Broadway performer. (If you thought it's simply a matter of catching the right ""break,"" seeing and hearing Menzel should end that notion.  Broadway isn't country music.)",1340409600,35,5903,5.577354260089686

Perfect Look to the rainbow, The way we were, Where or When with Taye Diggs, he was just a star.
Love the Walker songs, and the jokes that we fans already know and the new ones.

Outside of one instance of bad language this was great for all ages. For adults it is great. She is adorable, incredibly talented and funny.",1334188800,,275,4.63265306122449
5045681,5,B006ZZQMXS,"I am so glad Idina Menzel has finally released a concert DVD for people like me stuck in the caribbean unable to take a road trip to the nearest concert venue. Thank you thank you thank you!!
Great quality, definitely worth it!!",1332288000,,228,4.4523809523809526
5045702,5,B006ZZQMXS,I think my title says it al! Idina has so much talent and she is incredibly funny and crazy humble all at the same time. What a great person :) Love her!,1331942400,,153,3.8125
5045703,5,B006ZZQMXS,"The concert was the best I had ever experienced and I anxiously awaited the DVD upon pre-ordering. I was not disappointed. I love every minute of it. Idina is a true, genuine artist.",1331769600,8,182,4.545454545454546
5045704,1,B006ZZQMXS,"I anxiously opened the Pre-Ordered DVD to discover a disc that
was blatently self-serving with ""me..me..me"" agonzingly painful
to listen to over and over again with few song selections in
proportion to the boring diatribe.  What was Ron de Moraes
directing?  The applause sign?  Does a listener need to hear
about a performer's religion, what mother's favorite
song is, how wonderful it is to perform with a legendary conductor!

Quite simply: No!

Ms. Menzel should take heed from other Broadway performers who
achieve a proper balance between chit-chat and why they are on
stage to begin with.

It is more enjoyable to watch the pitch for PBS contributions then
listed to this overblown DVD.  I have never returned a DVD to Amazon,
but in this case I found it more fulfilling to drop this in my
recycle bin.  Too bad!",1331596800,9,819,4.8
5045705,5,B006ZZQMXS,"This concert is truly amazing.  Idinas singing and storytelling are both theatrical and enchanting.  Hers is the voice of the century and what every aspiring singer should strive for.  Cannot recommend this highly enough.  Idina we ""raise you high"".",1331510400,,249,5.3076923076923075
5045706,5,B006ZZQMXS,"When I saw her as Elphaba I believed I was seeing one of the greatest performances I've ever seen on Broadway. I really like this performance.  Her ""reality"" as a performer shows through.  I am so happy that I now have a recording of this great event that I wish I had been at.  I look forward to seeing her again.",1331510400,11,314,4.114754098360656
5045707,5,B006ZZQMXS,"Last October, I saw Idina when she came to Houston and was in awe.  Idina is phenomenal.  Her voice...her mere presence is breath-taking.  Her stories are lighthearted and genuine.  Such grace and talent is rare to find.  I had to own a copy of her stunning performance.",1331337600,2,270,4.659574468085107
5045708,5,B006ZZQMXS,"I'm embarrassed to admit that I didn't know Idina Menzel until her appearance on the TV show ""Glee"".  This DVD is my first exposure to her as an artist.  In a world of auto-tune and lip-syncing, I didn't even know music like this existed anymore.  This DVD is simply magical.  I really encourage you to get this if you are a fan of Glee.  You will soon be a fan of Idina Menzel!",1331078400,9,378,4.123287671232877
5045709,5,B006ZZQMXS,"Idina shows off her stunning musical and vocal range, her vast knowledge of the American songbook, and her comedic sensibilities in this very entertaining concert album recorded with a full orchestra.  Several of her most well known performances are included here with selections from ""Rent"" and ""Wicked,"" but her inclusion of a song like the beautifully written ""Asleep On The Wind,"" gives the listener insight into the type of song that Idina really loves to sing.  I am sure I will enjoy listening to this collection of songs brilliantly performed by Idina Menzel for years to come.",1331078400,7,585,5.020618556701031

5045711,5,B006ZZQMXS,"Saw Idina Menzel in Buffalo NY with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra and it was a great night of music.  Really like her mash up of Cole Porter's ""Love For Sale"" with Sting's ""Roxanne.""  I wish Mr. Idina Menzel (aka Taye Diggs) showed up at this concert but he was not in attendance.  She is down to earth with funny stories in between songs.
Can't wait to see what she does next !!!",1330992000,2,385,4.319444444444445
8507377,4,B006ZZQMXS,"Idina is absolutely wonderful.  Great entertainer with a spectacular voice.  Also a great tribute to Marvin Hamlisch, just prior to his death, apparently.  My only complaint is with the recording.  Some graininess and not the best, but she's still beautiful.  Best to buy only BluRay recordings, it appears.",1503964800,,307,5.3125
