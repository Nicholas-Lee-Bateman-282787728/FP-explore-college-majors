7489085,4,B0172D7ZZU,"Overall, I liked the workouts but I was disappointed in the program.  Most all of the individual workouts were very good, and I was pleasantly surprised by how tough the Chisel days were, but as an overall program it seems poorly designed and underwhelming.

The main issue is that all of the workouts are total body.  This is great for calorie burning, but had a couple problems. First, there was a lot of lower body (Iso Strength Chisel was one of the hardest LB workouts I have ever seen), but very little upper body, especially the chisel workouts. However, there was enough upper body to keep you from doing a targeted chest, arms or shoulder workout the next day. So, it is very hard to build upper body muscle, even if you sub in outside workouts. This problem is compounded by the lack of recovery days-you end up doing certain exercises (e.g., pull ups, lunges) several days in a row.

Second, the weights are pretty light throughout.  II expected that in Chisel, but the Hammer workouts were also focused on surprisingly light weights. I was expecting more Body Beast style hammer days, but very few of them went heavy, focusing instead on pace, reps, etc...  Again, great for overall fitness, but lousy for significant strength building.

I feel like I gained 6-7 good workouts that I can use as part of a larger hybrid program, but I wouldn't follow their calendar if you are interested in gaining strength and size (especially upper body).",1450828800,15,1452,4.715415019762846
7489086,3,B0172D7ZZU,"3 stars may be too many stars but I will explain my reasoning. For me, I am extremely disappointed in this program. I am a female who has done multiple different programs, my favorites have been the original P90x and Body Beast. I am a half marathon runner. So I usually switch up my workouts with running. I like workout programs that give me a lot of resistance training/ body building as it pairs well with my running. When I started Body Beast I fell in love with it. I still love the program and use it. So when I first saw the commercial for The Master's Hammer and Chisel I wanted it. My friend and I purchased this as soon as it came out and started immediately. We have both now completed every workout routine in the program and we are both disappointed. Total body workouts pretty much every day. For me, the workouts are not much of a challenge. I do not truly feel worked by the end. I feel more cardio has been added, there are a ton of leg exercises, and upper body gets left behind some. On the Hammer routines there is more upper body and weights mixed in with the legs. I do prefer the Hammer workouts to the Chisel workouts. Both of us having come from Body Beast are disappointed and already talking about going back to Body Beast and maybe just throwing in some of these workouts to add a little bit of extra cardio. For some people this workout may be great. Someone that has only done 21DF might love this. Someone who is not very active might have a harder time with these workouts. That is why I am giving it 3 starts versus one because I can see how this would be a good overall workout routine for someone who is not used to bodybuilding or not very active.  However, for me, it was not a winner and I am disappointed.",1450742400,68,1745,4.256024096385542
7489087,1,B0172D7ZZU,"I was a huge fan of Body Beast and was very excited to see Sagi back in a new video series.  I was extremely disappointed from the moment I started the first workout.  This is definitely tailored to a wider audience.  Body Beast was a weight intensive workout that focused on specific body parts in each workout.  This series is more of a run-of-the-mill full body workout in EVERY video.  I would rather just do 21 Day Fix or P90X3 or Insanity.  I feel as though Sagi sold-out.  I love Sagi, but he has taken a major step back from his day in Body Beast.  As for the Chisel workouts, they are not bad by any means.  However, again it feels too much like the ""standard"" workout found in 21 Day Fix and other BeachBody workouts.

In short, there is nothing really different about these workouts or anything that sets them apart enough from the usual full-body cardio half hour workouts.

This will appeal to some people, but for me, a big fan of Body Beast, this was not my cup of tea.",1450656000,46,984,4.3224043715847
7489088,4,B0172D7ZZU,"If could I'd give it 4.5 stars, very good but not great! My review is based on The Hammer, yes you have the option of doing only one at a time or both! The Masters Hammer
Other than AB Hammer & Hammer Plyometrics, it's Body Beast moves done differently. With use of resistance band more but no EZ Curl bar. It also added a modifier which I don't think Body Beast had. Sagi also has women training instead of two guys. Has some Tony Horton twist to this program, to me. Meaning some of the exercises are time based versus rep counts. Hammer Power is the best part of series for me. It's olympic lifting but with dumbbells instead of using barbell & plates.",1450310400,16,655,4.290322580645161

7489095,4,B0172D7ZZU,"I love this workout! Only downside is it practically is a total body workout everyday. However, I feel like I've gotten a lot stronger and my legs have toned up quite a bit. I don't have a bench and they practically use one everyday, I improvise using a coffee table and a stability ball for some moves. I recommend buying a variety of weights as you'll want to increase and decrease weights depending on the move. The Hammer guy thinks he's super funny but I would say he's probably better than Tony Horton (who talks way too much). I leave every workout drenched in sweat and pretty tired. I've done T-25, P90X, P90x3, Insanity, Insanity Asylum, Insanity Max:30 and this one ranks up there for being one of my favorites. I'm by no means a workout guru but I do like to workout at home vs the gym and hate doing cardio everyday, so this workout gives a great variety if you're looking to mix it up!",1476230400,21,899,4.389221556886228

Things you will need a bench, bands or a pullup bar, adjustable weights (highly recommended). It is tough for beginners but they do have modifications to the exercises. It also comes with a nutrition guide and several small containers to track food portions. This is huge because all you have to do is look at your gender m/f height/weight and it has a guide to how many containers you get every day. I also feel like the programming in this is better than other workout videos I have tried. Pretty basic moves and not a lot of crazy ones.

Only negatives I can think of are some of the plyometric exercises (Jumping) are not for everyone",1470873600,5,774,4.450704225352113

7489104,4,B0172D7ZZU,"The other reviews sum it up pretty well: great workouts that come together to make a very strange overall program. I say that because having gotten through the first month, it appears that the folks designing the Chisel workouts didn't much communicate with the Hammer designers, and vice versa. With few exceptions, the workouts hit the same muscle groups, to the same degree, day-in and day-out. Almost every workout is a total body workout. The legs get as much or more attention as the upper body, which sounds right in theory until you realize that there are only so many ways to work the legs with dumbbells -- prepare to eat a steady diet of squats, lunges and step-ups almost every day. There's almost zero isolated arm work if you're looking for that (it doesn't resemble Body Beast in any way). That's not to say the arms don't get a good workout (lots of pushups and pullups), but they don't get a lot of individual attention. There's also no real modifier. I mean, there is, but they're modifying for people who don't have the Beach Body weight bench (which they hawk incessantly), not for difficulty.

All that said, I do enjoy the program, almost in spite of itself. All of the workouts, with the exception of ""Hammer Power"" (an ambitious but poorly-executed attempt to introduce Olympic-style power lifting to the home gym environment), are excellent. The cardio workouts are probably more on-par with, say, Focus T25 than Max: 30, but each workout is so demanding that overall cardio won't suffer. Switching between trainers every day keeps things interesting. The total body aspect is a drawback, but also a strength -- there are no days or workouts you dread (though Iso Strength Chisel and Total Body Hammer are both particularly brutal). The workouts also tend to be on the shorter side, which is nice.

It's a deceptively tough program, more so than you'd expect from a program that focuses so much on resistance training. The relentless pacing has me pressing pause sometimes, despite having completed all three P90X programs and a month's worth of Insanity: Asylum -- whether through rep counts, tempo or set structure, they find ways to make conventional exercises way more challenging than they typically are.

I would say that this is perfect for 21DFX grads who want to dabble in more ""traditional"" weight training, but also for BodyBeast devotees who want to add in some cardio and ""functional"" strength work. If you've done P90X3 and enjoyed the training style, you'll probably like this as well. Just know that it's far more intense, and isn't for beginners. It's also worth noting that the program is designed for overall, general fitness. You'll probably build a little muscle and you'll probably lose a little weight, but it neither aims to add bulk like BodyBeast nor intends to slim down like 21DF/X. Equipment-wise, just about every workout relies on the bench (seriously, sometimes you get the sense that they designed the workout in order to sell benches), but I don't have one and the modifier/workaround is usually adequate.

Overall, a really, really good (but not perfect) program.",1469232000,8,3123,4.931558935361217

I read the reviews prior and felt like I knew whT to expect - it wouldn't be at all like Body Beast, but still a good workout. I was let down and disappointed after just doing the first few workouts. At some point, trainers need to stop trying reinvent the wheel and just stick with what works. The workouts were decent, but I do feel like someone could be easily injured if they are more of an amateur.  ISO Speed Hammer is ridiculous, and there are certain a moves that you could really get hurt by doing them super fast. I'm all for varying tempo, but it's also important to stress quality of movement and not just speed - especially when it comes to weight training. There are so many different workouts that it's easy to get confused with which one of which. Overall, decent workouts in terms of challenge, but too complicated.",1464566400,14,922,4.423529411764706

7489115,1,B0172D7ZZU,"I'm a long time Beachbody fan; over the years I've purchased all 3 P90X's,Tai Cheng, and, most recently, 22 Minute Hard Corps. I've completed all of them multiple times, with the exception of Hard Corps, which I'm still working through. As a trainer, Tony Horton's hard to beat - he's entertaining, up-beat and challenging, and has a fun and engaging personality.

That said, I feel Hammer and Chisel falls way short of the mark. Sagi's personality struck me as down right misogynist and over the top to the extent of being off putting. Autumn was great. But I was so turned off by Sagi that I didn't finish this program.

I was recently contacted by Beachbody - Amazon Marketplace requesting feedback, and noting that ""If, for any reason, you are not completely satisfied, please reply to this email so that we may address your concerns before you leave a product review. We would love to hear from you and are committed to your total satisfaction."" Again, the email I received came from 'Beachbody - Amazon Marketplace',  and provided the link which I followed to leave this very review, but when I replied to them directly and raised my criticisms and requested a return, they said that they didn't have my order info and that my order had been fulfilled by Amazon. When I pointed out that their email address indicated, at the very least, an affiliation with Amazon and asked why they (the manufacturer) couldn't just use the product's serial number, in any case, to process a return, they simply didn't respond.

I hate to leave them a bad review, and would've let it go, but I feel these requests for feedback and overtures like: ""We would love to hear from you and are committed to your total satisfaction"" were, in this case, nothing more than an invitation to waste this customer's time.

We commit to these programs for many weeks, and personality matters a great deal. Again, Tony Horton, Amber Calabrese = Great Trainers, engaging and easy to listen to/learn from. Sagi Kalev = in these videos, at least, came off as the very embodiment of all things I find off-putting about gym culture. I think the guy just needed a producer or director to step in and tell him to dial it down several notches, and then the product would easily have been in keeping with the rest of the Beachbody programs I've bought. Unfortunately, on this one, it seems they let an inmate take over the asylum.",1463616000,7,2394,4.690476190476191

Some moves seemed like they were made up so they could have a unique move to make this different than any other weight lifting routine. Jumping off a bench with weights in your hands doesn't seem safe and really did nothing for me except hurt my ankles and knees.

7489127,2,B0172D7ZZU,"I""m not a coach, but just a guy that found beachbody one day. I did several rounds of the orginal P90 and P90x and a round or two of insanity. In the process lost 100 pounds. It's hard to find an honest reiew of beach body probucts because of all the coaches trying to push products. What I didn't like about HC. Well, there were many things. First was the repitition between the workouts. It just seems that every day was the same. There were about three workout from the Hammer I never repeated, like iso speed hammer. Then there is the warm ups, or lack of warm ups. There is no way the trainers use these warm ups in their personal workouts. I laugh ever time I see ""the Hammer"" do his warm up. When he does walk to plank he tells you to keep your legs stright while he squats then walks to plank. He also looked confussed sometime, like he didn't know what was next. Sadly this is the first Beachbody workout I've returned. In P90X Tony goes on a rant about all the gadgets and gimmicks in the fittness industry that doesn't work. While doing some of the exersices I could hear Tony in my head saying, ""gimmicks that don't work.""  There were several exercises that are just injurys waiting to happen.  If I'm getting up at 5AM to work out and spending hard earned  money on a work out program, I exspect more.",1460505600,17,1314,4.290322580645161
7489128,5,B0172D7ZZU,"My husband bought this for the two of us to do.  He likes working out at the gym, but thought he might like this workout.  I enjoy doing these types of home workouts and was just finishing up my Jillian Michaels workout and wanted to move on to something different.  I'm a stay at home mom, so it's difficult to be able to get any kind of a workout in anytime after my baby is awake, let alone getting to the gym.
I'm on my last week of this program.  I didn't start following the diet until about a few days ago.  I still noticed a lot of improvements in my body and I'm curious to see what I look like at the end of the week keeping a closer eye on my portions.  I have been drinking a protein shake everyday, Optimum Nutrition Whey; my husband uses the same one.
My husband did the first workout and felt like it wasn't challenging enough, so he stopped and just goes to the gym.
The workout lengths vary anywhere from 26 min to 43 min and sometimes the 10 min ab video is added on, just depends, which makes the 43 min workout almost an hour long.  Honestly I don't even notice the time.  Each workout does have a countdown clock in the bottom corner, which is nice along with reps or timed sets.
Autumn is a good trainer, I like that she explains the moves and doesn't add unnecessary commentary.  Sagi, he's a little odd, he has some weird sayings, but I enjoy his workouts.  I've never really done ""weight lifting"" I've used weights in other programs, but he incorporates true weight lifting strategies in his workouts, I've really been enjoying that aspect and I think it's why I've noticed so much improvement in my body.
I started out with 3,5,6,8,10# dumbbells and a 20# kettle bell and an exercise mat.  After working out I had to go up some weight in mostly the leg workouts so I guess about halfway through I ended up purchasing 15# dumb bells as well.  Which was the best thing I could do, I could really tell that that's what I needed to increase my strength and I felt like I was getting a much better workout after I was done.  As long as you keep that in mind and keep increasing then you'll get results.  We already had a band system with a door attachment, so I used that for all of the pull-up moves and Sagi uses the band for every warm-up.  They recommend using a bench or the ball, so we purchased an exercise ball, but we have an ottoman that is very sturdy that I've used the entire time without any problems but use the ball when they lie on the bench or use it at an incline.  Plus, we're limited on space and I couldn't even imagine having a bench crammed into our living room, too.
The calendar is obviously very useful, but its a nice size too, I have it up on the side of our fridge along with the rest of our important papers.  The meals/recipes they have just don't seem appealing to me.  Im also someone that gets overwhelmed when there are too many ingredients to a recipe. The layout of the foods and which containers they belong in is very easy to understand, along with figuring out how many calories you should be taking in.  They also had some inserts for more beach body products like they're shakes and supplements, but I think they are overpriced so I just stuck with my usual products.
So when I started this workout I was about 128# Im 54, not a bad weight.  Like I said I didn't follow the meal plan so my weight did flux here and there, going up to 131# at one point. I weighed myself last Monday at 128# and started following the food system a little more closely about 5 days ago, and yesterday I weighed myself at 126.5.  My goal was 126#, since were going on vacation a few days after I finish the program.  I may just lose a few more pounds.  Well see.  Im not hungry eating more veggies and less carbs, so thats awesome and easier for me to get to my goal weight.
Im looking forward to starting this program up again after our vacation to see how much more I can improve upon myself.  I definitely recommend it!!!",1460073600,21,3968,4.24468085106383

7489131,4,B0172D7ZZU,"So my wife got this program for me after Christmas and I was really excited. You have to do each workout at least twice to really get used to the moves and form. I will admit that the first week or two I was not really enjoying the program. But once I really stepped up the weights and got used to each workout I started to enjoy them. Yes they are all total body in some way or another. You will get a little cardio, legs, back, chest the most but biceps and tris get the least love. A few weeks in I got the deluxe workouts (a gift card helped) and they are awesome. Sagis Hammer up works out the bis and tris in that one so you can sub it to get those worked more. Hammer power is the stand out workout of them all and is just so awesome. I keep pushing myself with each workout and it feels great. Hammer Iso speed is the weakest but once I upped my weights I actually enjoyed it after first hating that one and how short it is. Iso speed Chisel is one of the hardest because of the holds autumn throws in there. After doing this workout for 60 days my wife noticed a difference in my body, more cut and my arms even have better definition. All those pulls and push ups did me good. I have done body beast more then 3 times so I knew not to expect that, it's just a different animal. You may love it or you have hate it because of the total body aspect. Now I am a few weeks into doing a hammer/beast hybrid and I am enjoying it the most. It's not for everyone but if you enjoy total body and pushing yourself to the limit then go for it.",1459296000,4,1542,3.9455128205128207
7489132,2,B0172D7ZZU,"I have done Bodybeast and P90X 1,2,&3 many times. This program fails in comparison to any of them. To much emphasis on lower body exercises and not much on upper body. Personally I think combining trainers was a bad idea. If you you're a fan of Sagi's intensity from the bodybeast workouts you might be in for a disappointment in his workouts. I have not done any of Autums workouts prior to Hammer and Chisel , but I didn't look forward to any of them.

7489134,2,B0172D7ZZU,"If you are kind of fit already, don't waste your money.  I have done p90x, The Beast, and T25, Brazilian Butt Lift, and p90x3, All of those are better than this set. Out of all the workouts, there are only two that are decent.  To give you an example of the workouts, Sagi has one that has a 5 min warm up, 15 minutes of working out, and a 3 minute cool down.  If I am going to go to the trouble of getting up at 5 am to work out, I want to be worked for at least 30 min!  Some people have said in their reviews that if you are not feeling fatigued it is because you are not using enough weights, well, some of their moves, in my opinion, are going to cause injuries with enough weight to fatigue your muscles.  I get the feeling that they added ""The Beast"" (Sagi) just to get men to buy it.  What also irritates me is that everyone is a fitness model.  What happened to using real people?  Autumn's outfits are more reveling than my bikinis. Every shot includes her ample cleavage.  What happened to getting fit for health's sake and not to be a sexual object?  And before you say, that I don't like her because she is hot, I have no issue with the Brazillian Butt Lift videos, they literally work your a**, but Autumn is just so very irritating to listen to.  After six months with Tony Horton (p90x) I have to mute him, but after a week with her I was screaming shut up at the TV, but she never shuts up! and every workout she is ""shooting energy out of her heels"" and ""you can do it!""  At least Sagi, although I think he sold out on this one, he does not make my ears scream!  This is the worst beach body video unless you are at the end of the beginning stage.  (Some of the moves I would not recommenced heavier people doing because you will kill your knees, and their modifiers don't really modify most of the time.)

7489137,3,B0172D7ZZU,"I was super excited to get this program.  I printed out the worksheets so I could track my weights.  I printed out the food tally sheets so I could log everything I ate.  The program worked.  I lost 14 lbs and several inches.  If you're looking for results, follow the program and you'll get them.

However, I have a love/hate relationship with this program.  The workout times are all over the place ranging from 25 minutes to 50 minutes.  I like structured workouts, so this bugged me.  The first few workouts were disappointing and I thought I was going to hate the program.  I almost sent it back.  My coach encouraged me to give it a little more time and to up my weights.  I followed her advice and by the end of the first week I liked the program.  The workouts themselves were challenging, though some much more than others.  I found Autumn's way more challenging than Sagi's which was disappointing as I did Body Beast before H&C and he was tough in that program.  Though, by the end of the 60 days I was rather bored.  I could also handle Sagi's narcissism much better in BB but in H&C he's just insufferable.  Autumn is encouraging, Sagi prefers to talk about himself.  It's ok for a few minutes, but after half an hour it's downright annoying.

I did notice while they work the heck out of the legs, shoulders, chest, and back, the arms are mostly neglected, with the exception of about 3 of the exercises.  I was hoping for arm definition at the end of the program, and I didn't get it.  I did have a little ab action peeking though so that was exciting.

At any rate, I finished the program with good results but I've since moved on to Insanity Max 30 which is more to my liking. I'll probably mix this in at some point when I've finished Insanity, but I doubt I'll do it for the full 60 days again, 30 was about my limit.",1457568000,,1836,4.32258064516129
7489138,4,B0172D7ZZU,"My story:
2011, I did P90X and suffered through Tony Horton's chitchat style, but didn't start losing any weight till after 6-weeks (apparently a common experience among participants). By the end of the program I had lost 30lbs overall and six inches on my waist. I went right into Insanity and built up my cardio endurance, then Insanity Asylum...but no additional weight loss, even though I had another 15lbs for goal weight.
2015, I had gained 25 pounds back and was inactive, so when I turned 45 yrs old I trained for 10 weeks and completed a 1/2 marathon in 2:02:00. I lost 7lbs in the process, but then quickly went for the casual once-a-week 3mile run only.
2016, I'm about to turn 46 and realize I need to make dietary changes and have overall body fitness. Thus the introduction of this workout system is working well for me.

This workout:
+ Weight / resistance bands used in almost all the workouts (I'm about 2-weeks into it).

+ So far, equipment needed are: dumbbells up to 20lbs, pull-up bar and/or resistance band set in place of either dumbbells or pull-up bar. Thus no strange equipment needed like P90X-2 tried to gimmick into the mix.

+ I have tennis elbow from straining during pull ups. I'm finding if I use a brace on my arms and use bands instead of a pull-up bar I'm not inflaming my elbow.

+ I'm currently strength-wise using between 8-12lb weights for most exercises and I'm drenched in sweat by the end.

+ Most of the workouts, so far, last about 25-40 minutes. Not too bad!

+ Between 14 workouts, there is plenty of variety.

+ Sagi is comical and Autumn is all business. The difference in style mixes it up and I'm okay with that.

+ I'll do one of these in the morning and three times a week I'm doing a late afternoon/early evening 3-5 miles run...even with the leg workouts here.

> Speaking of which there is a lot of leg focus here and some upper body. Thus, my running pace is closer to 11min/mile versus a 9min/mile because my legs are just tired in the evening.

+ There is a good amount of moves that work the core while doing something else.

+ Everyone in these videos is ripped out! Even the girls have great slim, non-bulky figures, with a six/eight pack.

OVERALL: I've done ALL the Shaun T stuff (almost all calf, legs and cardio), the P90X series (my favorite is original P90X) and Body Beast (good for muscle bulk). This is turning out to be a fun total body work out for me. I'm burning calories (down 2lbs in two weeks) and sweating heavily. I like this workout and the variety it provides.

I think if I can stick with it and have some results to share, I may bump this up to ""I love this workout"" (5-stars)...but for now I really like it and the end results look hopeful.

I will close with, my co-worker finished his first set of this workout and dropped 25lbs and is very strong after doing this workout with weight that challenges him. He swears by this workout and he likes to lift heavy weight. His wife lost 40lbs doing T25. I think you find a program and stick to it, you can see positive results. For me, it may be this program...I'll let you know in another several weeks.",1457395200,2,3136,4.421875
7489139,3,B0172D7ZZU,"I couldn't really get into this workout series. Ive done P90X, T25, Body Beast, Insanity Max 30 and PiYO from BeachBody and most have delivered. This one just seemed disjointed and like so many have noted, every workout seemed to be a total body workout; but each workout with a slightly different twist. So it got boring.

My demographic: Male, mid-40s, 62, 178 and reasonably fit. I like a variety of exercise types but love Insanity-style interval training and more focused weight training like in the P90 series and Body Beast.

Heres what I like about this program: Its heavy on lower body, core, and back (large muscle groups!). Love the pull-ups, chin-ups, squats, and deadlifts. I definitely noticed some shaping and bulk around the gluts, thighs, and lats. I generally like the trainers. Sagi and Autumn are pleasant and motivating (Sagi is a trip), the production value was good, and the fitness models weren't too intrusive or intimidating. Hammer Power was a really interesting, challenging, and fun workout.

Heres what I felt was lacking: Cohesion.the daily workouts didn't flow in an intuitive pattern. It really did feel like I was just doing another total body workout each day. I also wished the workout length was more standardized (some workouts are barely 25 mins and some are 45 min). And, the difficulty was also variable. Some workouts would leave me drenched, huffing, and sore; while others had me barely breaking a sweat.

As a weight loss program, I think this program is good. The nutrition plan is simple and easy to follow. However, if you're looking to shred calories quickly without focusing as much on calories, this isn't going to work. As a body sculpting program I think the results are going to depend on where you want the most help. Thighs, gluteals, core, and back will get the most attention; shoulders and chest to a lesser degree.

7489141,4,B0172D7ZZU,"I would say a lot of the reviewers are right on with their assessment of the program. I am a woman in her early 40s who has completed most other BeachBody programs. It's definitely a step or 2 above 21 Day Fix Extreme. It's not Body Beast because you do total body workouts vs. isolating muscle workout, and not as many sets as Beast. Yes, H&C is heavy on the legs (but they'll look great when you're done with the program) and light on the bis/tris. I did supplemental bis/tri work. I belong to a online support group for women doing H&C and I don't think anyone used the portion containers (wish BeachBody would have eliminated those and then lowered the price). We all kept track of calories and macros instead. Also, the women in my group had varying results- some definitely had more muscle definition by the end (if they were somewhat lean to begin with) and others saw hardly any results. I think people need to realize that it's only a 56-day program - you're not going to go from obese to totally ripped in that short amount of time. As far as the workout schedule, I could not determine rhyme or reason with it. Many times, you work the same muscle groups several days in a row (my lower half was always sore). Would I do the program again? The answer is no, not the way it is laid out. BUT I would take several of the workouts and do hybrid with Body Beast.or P90X.",1457136000,,1376,4.337209302325581

7489143,5,B0172D7ZZU,"This is an excellent program, but I see a lot of people posting negative reviews because they wanted Body Beast 2 or a continuation of 21 Day Fix.  I should preface this by saying that I came in wanting Body Beast 2; I did two rounds of Body Beast and LOVED it because it transformed me from being a string bean to being a reasonably muscular ""beast"" (I gained 12 lbs of muscle in seven months), but that's not a fair comparison because the goals of the program are different.  While Body Beast is meant to build big muscles, Hammer and Chisel is meant to build superior athleticism, balance, and agility.  While Body Beast helped me slap on some meat that I didn't think was possible, Hammer and Chisel helped me become a better athlete, and I am close to getting that lean Brad Pitt (from Fight Club) physique because the nutrition is simple.

The main appeal of Hammer and Chisel, for me, is the ease of nutrition and ab/core work.  The nutrition is really simple:  Just look at the list of foods that correspond to each color, and make sure you eat X number of those colored containers per day.  Within three weeks, I had already lost 7 lbs, and my skin complexion was looking brighter and younger like I was 24 again, and I feel a lot more clear-headed and immune to illness.

FYI I am a male in somewhere in the 30-35 year old bracket.

After many years of being in and out of shape I finally decided to make a new years resolution to get fit. I know I know, New Years resolutions are usually failed by a month in, but I've been busting my butt with Hammer and Chisel and Couch to 5k since January 4th. I've lost 20+ pounds ( I don't weigh myself every day) and my wife says she's seeing definition. I am definitely overweight but at this point I'm feeling as good as I felt when I was 25 and I was in shape. I'll see the scale get to where I want it to be soon enough. I know it's not a sprint but a marathon.

I've been athletic most of my life but when I got out of the military I kind of let myself go. I didn't care. I drank every day and only ate fast food. Those are very bad habits to have. I did that for a number of years, then I slowly started doing better. I rarely drank, I stopped drinking pop completely, and I started to watch how I ate. I've done the couch to 5k complete program before and lost an incredible amount of weight. Unfortunately I spiraled back into binge eating and drinking. Now we have a 5 year old and it literally disgusts me how she was able to run laps around me and I was too lazy to take her to the park or do anything fun. I was becoming the person I never wanted to be, nor thought I could be. That's when I decided after Thanksgiving that I would make it my new years resolution to do something about it. My wife bought this program (more info on that as a post script) and I still had my couch to 5k app and I have been kicking butt. It tells you to use Thursday as a rest day but I use Sunday as a rest day. My couch to 5K I run every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Today I just completed week 9 (the final week) and it's 30 minutes continuous run. I finished it and still felt great after the run. Of course I did my hammer and chisel workout earlier in the day. I'm on my last week of hammer & chisel so I'm excited to be done.

Now that my story is out of the way, let's get to the program. It's a decent program. I never tried anything like this before and I don't know why I started now. My wife and I were doing it at the same time, but she's not as athletic as I am. Not a jab to her, but I played sports my whole life, I was in the military,etc. and I'm a guy so I have this never give up mentality that's definitely stubborn. My wife suspended doing this after the 4th week and decided to do the 21 day fix instead. I don't blame her. Even in my last week of doing the program it's very tough if you give it your best effort. I say I give about 75-80% just because I do a lot of cardio afterwards and I don't want to be completely burned out. I also have an exercise bike I use so I'm trying to burn as many calories as possible but I leave it all out there for my cardio (running and biking).

There's 2 trainers, the guy (Hammer) and the lady (Chisel). Hammer is mostly about strength/power and Chisel is more cardio/endurance. Hammer is a huge dude with muscles on top of muscles. Has a foreign accent and reminds me of Arnold. Chisel is a petite, in shape woman with a very annoying voice. The longer I have done this program the more I found it annoying. They have their pros and cons. They both try to crack jokes but it's just lame. They have the same individual warmup stretches every time so you can memorize it after a couple of times doing it.

As far as the workouts go, I do light weights just because I injured myself a couple of weeks in. There's a slew of unskippable warnings when you start the DVD. Over a minute and I'm not kidding. You do Hammer one day then chisel the next day and every time you have to waste a minute to see the same warning over and over. I know they don't want to be sued and all but make it skippable. Anyway, I injured myself doing the Hammer workout on reverse grip row exercise. He said go Heavy so I went heavy and hurt my wrist. I wasn't able to turn it more than a few cm without having sharp pains in it. Almost 6 weeks later and it still hurts but it's getting better. My doctor couldn't get me in until next week (yes almost 7 weeks for an appointment. I'm going to chew him out about his receptionist). Even while hurt I was looking forward to doing the exercises, now I'm looking forward to them ending. It's not bad but doing the same stuff for 8 weeks is boring.

They have alternate exercises if you don't have a bench or a pull up bar, but I think minimally you'll need a bench (bought here on amazon for 40 bucks), some weights (bartered a set on craigslist) and the bands (25 bucks on amazon). I would say with the price of $105 currently, you're looking at least $200 total to get a bench, the bands and additional weights. Not that bad of an investment but for $200 you can get about a year's gym membership in my area. That might be a better choice if you're motivated to go to the gym 4-5 times a week. That's why these exercise programs thrive. People think they can get a gym type body without going to the gym or doing anything crazy. I don't think so. You have to exercise, but not just the 30-45 minutes from hammer and chisel. You have to work extra, and eat better (don't forget 80% is what you eat 20% is exercise. at least that's what everyone says)

P.S. Don't buy from Beach body direct. Started to receive a bunch of different charges every couple of days. Couldn't contact anyone so I just canceled the card I used.",1456099200,3,5517,4.055045871559633
7489148,4,B0172D7ZZU,"If you go into this program expecting another Body Beast, you will be disappointed.  If you're looking to transition into Body Beast from a more cardio-based program, or if you are trying to slim out after Body Beast, you will probably enjoy this.

This was my first program after a back/shoulder surgery that took several months from which to recover and I lost a lot of mass I had gained from Body Beast.  This was a great program to get back into shape, gain some muscle, and shred some fat.

First: This is a total-body workout almost every day and is very leg-heavy.

Second: You will not work out the glamour muscles (i.e., biceps, triceps) often.

I was pretty hesitant when I was a couple of weeks into the program because of the two points above.  I felt so exhausted working out the same muscles (especially legs) every day and I felt as if the upper body moves only targeted the shoulders, chest, and back.  You'll get used to working out similar muscles across days, especially as you adjust to the typical Hammer-Chisel-Hammer-Chisel sequence of heavy weights one day and more cardio/core on the other.  I've actually had the most growth in my legs in this program (above and beyond Body Beast).  In regard to the second concern, I recommend supplementing by adding biceps/triceps moves onto the end of the workout, if you're concerned.  For example, I added hammer/regular curls and triceps dips/extensions at the end of Iso Speed Hammer (10 slow reps, 10 fast reps each) and Total Body Hammer (10, 8, 6 reps each).  Also, most Body Beast fans will really enjoy the optional 30-Day Hammer calendar--I highly recommend it after the 60-Day program.  The 30-Day Hammer and added biceps/triceps will leave you looking pretty great!

The workout themselves are pretty great.  My favorites include Total Body Chisel (just gives you a great pump), Hammer Power (a power-lifting workout unlike anything else I have encountered through Beachbody), and Max Hammer Strength (60 s of a bodyweight move, followed by 8 heavy-weight reps targeting the same area).  Like any program, there are a few duds...Iso Speed Hammer is extremely short and Chisel Agility is not challenging.  But overall, there are so many workouts for a 60-day program and I enjoyed the variety each week.

I had never experienced Autumn before but I found her to be just as motivating as Tony Horton (without the jokes);  she seems to have a knack for calling the audience out when she thinks they'll be slacking (e.g., ""The move lasts 60 s, not 50 s"") and that helped challenge me to give her everything I had at the moment.  I'm not sure why people on Amazon were commenting on her outfits or whatever, as I didn't ever attend to her image (and I'm a 26-year-old man).  If you're really focusing on that when you're working out, then you're doing something wrong.  Sagi is back and as goofy and grammatically incorrect as ever.  Alternating them each day makes the schedule more interesting (as opposed to one trainer for 90 days).  I will say that the ""Master's Cardio"" bonus disk with both trainers is just awful--the two trainers seem to step on each other's toes and have weird interactions (the workout itself is also not challenging).  The deluxe workouts with the two are much, much better and is what you would hope for in a dual-trainer dvd: each trainer pushing the other to do challenging moves that you are doing in your own house.

Overall, I really enjoyed the program.  It's not as comprehensive as P90X in that it is missing stretching and yoga, but is probably in my top 5 Beachbody programs.  As you can see by my before and after (note that the ""after"" photo was at the end of the supplemental 30-Day Hammer program), I gained some good muscle mass.  I added about an inch to my legs and lost an inch around my waist (not pictured).  Hope you guys enjoy it like I did!

7489149,2,B0172D7ZZU,"I am a former personal trainer and active female who did P90X 1-3, Insanity, Body Beast, and T25. I found Hammer and Chisel to be underwhelming. It is definitely for someone who is already in decent shape (can do pull-ups and push-ups). A lot of the moves were too awkward for me to increase the weight enough to challenge my muscles. The program felt poorly designed. Sometimes I'd exercise the same muscles day to day while neglecting other muscle groups for several days. The food container system was tedious. I eat recipes, not ingredients, and eventually just started tracking calories instead. I did the program for a month and got far better results from doing Body Beast with added cardio 3x week. Body Beast is my favorite of all the beach body workouts. If you try it, I recommend limiting the added cardio to 20-30 minutes, 2-3x a week, as too much cardio will impede your muscle gains.",1455235200,8,898,4.689873417721519

The workout outs seem unplanned, even somewhat off the tops of the instructors heads i.e. AT THAT MOMENT for FILMING...the production is poor...camera men keep getting in the way of shots , Sagi seems like he doesn't even want to be there...the cardio DVD is a joke. I don't even sweat.
Im not thrilled about standing on my olympic bench to begin with; doing it over and over again ...it's going to rip.

 If you're in shape, you won't find Hammer and Chisel challenging....might even say boring . If you're not in the best of shape, you might find it OK at first...I can see that...but be warned, you could hurt yourself (ankles, knees ) with some of the moves, which in my opinion, you don't need to be doing in the first place to get in shape.

7489156,2,B0172D7ZZU,"The headline really says it all. Like a lot of other reviews I've read on here, I was really looking forward to this programs release. I've been doing Body Beast and Max 30 for awhile now and they were getting somewhat stale to me. ----I've done all the P90X stuff. Love the workouts, but the trainer drives me nuts. Even on mute-his facial expressions and just his overall goofiness is something I could never tolerate. It's funny once, maybe twice, but when I hear it over and over again in a DVD-it's annoying. That said, I'm sure I'll buy his new one coming out in March because I always hold out hope for him cutting his jokes back and being a little less silly and again, his workout are great.

Back to THIS review.... I really wanted to love it. I had HUGE success with 30 and BB and was hoping this would be a big refresh and bring something new to the table. Nope. It's about 70-80% legs. The trainers - when together for their 16 minute cardio DVD are flirting and not taking anything serious. Sagi really has sold out in this program as others have said. I can't remember the ladies name as I haven't done her program before-Chisel as she's called here-she's distracting for reasons others have pointed out. Plus yeah, she rambles a little much. I'm two weeks out from finishing this. I might do it once more to see if it grows on me. If I still don't like it, I'm selling it for what I can get for it. My wife has already told me she has no interest in doing this program. I'll just go back to 30 and BB and pray Tony isn't annoying in 22.

I purchased this from Beach Body, so it doesn't say Verified in this review. I'd say this program is for someone who hasn't done BB before or looking to just get into working out. It isn't for people who're in better shape. I get a decent sweat, but that's only when I modify the heck out of it to make it a big challenge from what they tell you to do. Overall, it is LEGS LEGS LEGS. Better throw some push-ups in before bed to counter this thing.",1453852800,6,2001,4.221932114882507
7489157,4,B0172D7ZZU,"It won't say Amazon verified for my purchase because I bought this from Beachbody (it was actually a bit cheaper when it first came out and you get the Masters Cardio bonus). I was reading the other reviews and thought I'd better add mine to help diversify. I was not a fan of Body Beast. It's a good weightlifting program, but meh to do everyday. I have tried P90X and I liked it, but an hour a day 6 or 7 days a week is not happening. I LOVED 21 Day Fix Extreme. Loved it, got awesome results with it, would probably marry it. This isn't as good. Back and legs everyday, with a sprinkle of other stuff. Probably better to mix with other workouts (I'm combining it with Max 30, which hurts my knees if I do it too many days in a row), there's not enough Cardio and it really needs a yoga or stretch day.

7489159,5,B0172D7ZZU,"I don't understand why this program gets such a bad rap, (comparatively speaking that is).  I often refer to amazon for reviews, I just find it's a good place to get unbiased reviews from real consumers who don't have an ulterior motive.  And this program only scores 3.5 out of 5 stars, which isn't really impressive for a workout program considering that virtually all of the workouts in both the Insanity and P90X series score nearly 5 out of 5 stars.

First a little about myself, I'm an early forties male that's completed Insanity, P90X3, T25, and 21 Day Fix (did this one mostly with my wife).  I try to eat mostly healthy but I do love a cold beer or a slice of pizza every now and then.  I genuinely push myself in my workouts and have seen results to prove it, however I've never managed to get six-pack abs.  I'm about 5'11"" 183lbs, I can do 10 consecutive solid pull-ups with good form, 50 push-ups without stopping, and can run 3 consecutive 8 minute miles pretty easily (not sure how much faster I could go, I never really try).  Realizing there are lots of people more or less fit, I say all of this as to give you an idea of my fitness level so you can gauge where my perspective is coming from.

 I haven't found the need to double up workouts or substitute parts of the program as others have mentioned.  I personally find these workouts provide an adequate burn and are plenty challenging but not in an Insanity sweat puddle sort of way.  And yes, a few of the ""Hammer"" workouts are shorter, but with many of the workouts clocking in around the 40 minute mark, it's a welcomed change of pace when shorter workouts pop up on the calendar.

The cardio in Hammer and Chisel is often more resistance based.  Yes there are burpees, and lunges, and even lunge hops; but there's also bench step-ups, or raise up from a sitting position on your bench with one leg while there's weight in your hands.  I mean there's some really good stuff here!  I began this program almost immediately after completing a round of T25 and I think the change in pacing has shocked my body into change.  I'm currently in week 3 and can notice visible changes.

 I like the way the equipment is incorporated into the workouts.  I strongly recommend a bench and dumbbells.  In this program, you'll spend more time standing or stepping on the bench than lying on it!  Sure there's a modifier, and in some instances you may need to use the modifier due to the complexity or impact of the move, but otherwise I feel that without the basic equipment you'd miss out on a lot of the nuance which helps many of the moves to be effective.

It's true that most of the workouts seem to be total body workouts.  And yes, there are some moves that are repeated, but moves are never repeated in the same context between different workouts.  For example, at one point you may do a pull-up, and at another point you may do a pull-up with a 3-second count as you let yourself down, and yet at another point you may do a pull-up paired with a burpee.  And yes while most of the workouts have a total body feel, I actually enjoy that part of it.  Lot's of compound moves where I feel as if muscles that I don't even know are working are working.  At the end of a workout I feel as if I've had a sufficient burn however it's not the same feeling as an Insanity I can't catch my breath and my heart is beating out of my chest burn.  But it's also not the traditional weight lifting take one body part and work it til it feels like jello burn either!  Honestly, whereas I love the total body nature of this workout, I think it's where it runs into trouble with many people who are fans of Body Beast or Insanity like programs because it's neither.  But it is something different that can be just as effective depending on the result you're looking for.  If I had to compare it another Beachbody workout, I would say it most closely resembles X3, but lets be clear, it's not that.  Just the advent of two trainers alone and not listening to the same voice on consecutive days gives it a different feel.

As for the trainers, I like both Autumn and Sagi.  They both have very different styles but neither is as hyper ""push"" ""push"" as Shaun T or as jokey corny as Tony Horton.  Speaking of Autumn, I think the chisel workouts are the more challenging.  Lot's of compound movements and ""Chisel Balance"" is a butt kicker.  I like Autumns motivational tactics, it's not too over the top, but sometimes her words help me get that 1 more rep.  As far as what's she's wearing?? Who cares?!?  She looks great, male and female, use it as motivation.  It's a workout video.  Sagi on the other hand, as many have said, has a little bit more of a meathead style but I enjoy that too.  It's gets me excited to push myself.  Some people find him obnoxious, I find him funny.  He says things like, ""when I say go heavy, I mean heavy!!""  Then he looks at one of his cast members and say's, ""Well if that's heavy for you?!  Guess that's okay.""  I could understand how that might be insulting if you're really in the room with him, otherwise it might just convince you to grab 5lbs heavier.

Anyway, overall I find it an enjoyable program that's been challenging and effective so far.

**Update** 2/26/16
Currently I'm 1 workout away from completing week 7, and I thought I'd chime in again to give you some additional thoughts now that I'm further into the program. First the appearance change results have been pretty good, not infomercial good, but definitely visibly noticeable. I think my 'Hammer and Chisel' results are the best I've had since I first did Insanity years ago. But, I must say that I've been the most nutritionally disciplined with this program, more so than I've ever been with any program including Insanity. When I did Insanity for the first time years ago, I ate healthy food but continued to drink regularly. I didn't drink tons, but my wife and I were dating and we didn't have children yet, so we ate out often. Two or three drinks four or five times a week was pretty common and nevertheless the visible results were the best I ever had (I was also a couple of years younger then, maybe 37 or 38. Also, Insanity was my first work out program of this nature so maybe the introduction to HIIT type training made my results more drastic). Insanity can be a bit like torture but you can't beat the visible results. With Hammer and Chisel, I didn't completely quit drinking but it was closely regulated except for Super Bowl weekend where I pretty much ate and drank what I wanted. Otherwise it was 1 or 2 drinks no more than twice a week. Its the best result I've seen since Insanity, but perhaps the disciplined nutrition was really the culprit. Now I'm down to about 176-177 lbs which is about 9 or 10 lbs less than when I started. I've knocked about and 1 1/2"" inches off my waist and my upper abdominal are visible but the lower abs still descend into a little fat around the belly. In the beginning of Hammer and Chisel I thought that I might actually lose that, but sadly that's not gonna happen as I kinda hit a plateau for a while in the middle of the program. Nevertheless, I'm happy with the progress and it didn't string me out quite as much as Insanity and I got a little more muscle tone. I really don't want to lose any more weight but I'd still like to tone up that mid-section.

Anyway enough about results and let's move on to the work outs and my findings there. I've read lots of complaints about how the program is dangerous, bad for the knees, the legs are overworked, etc... And I did experience some knee pains in my right knee. But what should I expect, I'm 41 years old and I'm hopping up and down on a bench with weights in my hands?!? Still I wouldn't call the program dangerous, but common sense and body awareness must apply. As a result, I did have to modify some in order to make sure I didn't injure myself, but I think knowing when to back off is a crucial part to any workout. Mostly I had to give up some of the single leg squats and step-ups when the knee was feeling weaker. Typically I replaced them with double leg squats and then continued whatever motion the exercise required. I don't feel that I lost much of what I was intended to get from the workouts with the modifications I created.

For a guy of decent strength I'd say you need dumbbells ranging from weights of about 10lbs thru 40lbs, however be prepared to purchase 45's and 50's depending on how you progress. Now I'm not saying that 40lbs would be enough for every exercise, but if you're purchasing specifically for this program 40's will get you by. The weight range typically doesn't need to be very high because 'Hammer and Chisel' is a compound move fiesta! As I mentioned in the first half of the review, I think this is where the program runs into problems with many people. The Bulk of Hammer and Chisel is compound move resistance training! For those who like more traditional cardio and power lifting, this program may not be for you! Isolated curls, tricep extensions, and presses are rare; and high knees, different types of jumping jacks, and running in place are practically non-existent in this workout. It's more like lunges into an upright row or squats into a shoulder raise or burpee into renegade row into upright row.  Oh, and there's tons of lunges, squats, and step-ups to fill in the gaps!  Yes the workouts are total body, but they're total body, not lower body and consistently work multiple muscle groups. It makes sense, the goal here is to chisel you out, thus burn fat, thus the large muscle groups get worked ALOT!

My favorite workouts are Chisel Balance, Chisel Cardio, Max Hammer Strength, and I have a love hate relationship with Hammer Power. Overall, I still find it an enjoyable program. There's enough different workouts over the course of the 8 week calendar that I never really felt bored or as if I knew the routines by heart. I still kinda enjoy the pain of not remembering what move comes next! 41 workouts down, 7 to go! I am looking forward to finishing! Wish me luck and thanks for sharing in my journey!

**Update***

Finished.  And my final conclusion is I still love this program but I can understand how some may not.  I've attached a picture of my real 8 week result.  Again, I didn't get infomercial results but I'm pleased with my progress!  I didn't eat perfectly, I consumed a few beers, margaritas, and even a few slices of cake. But I would say that I was mostly disciplined nutritionally and definitely hit the 80/20 mark healthy vs junk.  I just say that cause I would like to point out that you don't have to be perfect to get results.  And even more importantly I'm stronger and feel great.

7489161,2,B0172D7ZZU,"This program is a big ' miss' in my opinion.

Have completed P90X and X3.  I am a huge Insanity and Max 30 fan ( as well as T25).  My favorite of all programs though is Body Beast.

Wife completed 21Day Extreme recently and I did many workouts with her.  They were pretty hard core and I became a fan of that routine as well, but, never did the complete program.

So, when Hammer and Chisel was introduced, I thought, WOW, this is the golden goose of weight involved cardio and strength routines. Wrong.  IMHO, the routine is ( as several others mention) more of a total body workout with a lot of concentration on leg/lower body. No problem, but there  is very limited upper body focus.

As a huge Sagi fan, I must state that his portions of the workout ( Hammer) are simply weak. Autumns part ( Chisel) are much more intense and offer some relatively difficult cardio/weight involved routines.

After 4 weeks, we have already modified the program.  Am continuing to follow Autumns schedule, but substituting the Hammer routines with Body Beast ' build'.

7489167,3,B0172D7ZZU,"Little background:
I'm kind of a Tony Horton junkie, because P90x was the thing that brought my health and fitness to the forefront. As dumb/typical as it sounds p90x changed my life and put me on the road upwards instead of down.

I've done p90x, p90x2, and p90x3, and body beast....and then realized I need to focus on posture and correcting muscle imbalances and bad mind-muscle patterns, etc. I had a lot of muscle inhibitions, imbalances, and bad posture. For example, if you sit all day at your job, you're gonna have inhibitions in your glutes and problems in your hip flexors. Probably inhibitions in your back as well.) These things are worth studying and understanding before/as you workout or else an injury is very likely in the works. Evaluate your posture before starting any program and consistently DURING a program as well. I came very close to injuring my knees/tendons because of a glute inhibition. Also had inhibitions with my lats which almost caused a lot of shoulder problems. Well, both of these things DID cause problems/injuries...but thankfully they were correctable before I caused anything truly major. It's easy to start thinking about your body in pieces with fitness programs (""I'm gonna do a chest workout."" ""Today is leg day!"") but you're body is a whole and it functions as a whole. So pay attention and focus.  Figuring out your body takes a lot of time but it's worth it. Don't just move weights around because you're body won't do it right without conscious focus. Don't just do a program because you want to look better. That was a tangent...but ya...

Anyway...I just started this program about 2 weeks ago. I'm already very well conditioned and have developed my strength and posture over the past 3 years of working out. A lot of these other reviews make some good points at least on first thought. This isn't exactly and ""advanced"" workout. That being said, that's a pretty relative thing. You can make anything an advanced workout with the right intensity and weights. It's very easy to get a ""good workout"" with these workouts. Ultimately, the modality of this program is where the main issue is. Every workout as far as I can tell in this program is essentially a total body workout. Which is a completely different approach than any of the other programs.

It's been easy to feel like I haven't done all that much after these workouts precisely because of the difference in approach. You're not spending 30 minutes or more on one or two muscle groups like most the other programs so it feels like you're just not doing as much, not moving as much weight, etc. with a single muscle group. It feels more like you're just stimulating everything vs actually hitting anything really hard. But that's probably where the adjustments need to be made for those people (myself included). Since you're not hammering any specific muscle really hard for 30 minutes you can go a lot heavier and bring up the intensity of each exercise. That raises the question about rest time though. Since they're doing total body every workout, it seems that there isn't enough recovery time to go heavy. So you're kind of stuck in this place where you're either going hard and doing 2 sets of really heavy weights on your whole body....every day.....or you feel like you haven't done all that much. Although, 2 sets of heavy weights on chest multiple times a week vs doing like 10 sets of chest 1 day a week like Body Beast? Might not be as huge a difference as it seems.

Overall, I'm enjoying it as a change of pace and modality. It's kind of nice doing some total body stuff vs the typical splits, etc.....and it's actually kind of nice to have a bit of left over energy after a workout instead of completely exhausting a single muscle group. (I forgot what that felt like.)",1452470400,9,3798,4.722473604826546
7489168,3,B0172D7ZZU,"Im a male in my late 30s who is in good but not great shape. I have done a number of DVD based workouts and have also had gym memberships at various points in my life. I also like to do bicycling and other outdoor activities in during the warmer months. Last spring I did the T25 program (including Gamma) and in the fall, I did Met-RX 180. I found both of these workouts were at the right level for me in terms of difficultly/intensity level. However, I thought T25 workouts were a little too short on the strength training and a little short on time to get me the results I wanted. I thought Met-RX had plenty of strength training, but the workouts were long. Later in the program they have you do a strength routine that is usually just under an hour and a cardio routine that is a little over half an hour on most days. I would like to keep my total workout time under an hour, but longer than half an hour. When I saw the promos for Hammer and Chisel, I thought it was just what I needed. It promised 30-40 minute workouts that appeared to be challenging, but not extreme. I also liked the fact that most routines used dumbbells. I like to work out with my girlfriend who is at a slightly lower fitness level than I am. It is easy to customize a workout to your ability level by varying the amount of weight you are using.

 The program set-up is a certainly unique. It has a collection of Chisel workouts led by Autumn Calabrese and a set of Hammer workouts led by Segi Kalev. The program is primarily designed to intersperse the workouts from both trainers. However, there are alternative workout calendars that allow you to do just the Hammer workouts or just the Chisel workouts. The workouts really aren't dramatically different.. The Chisel workouts tend to have a bit more of a balance component. As other reviews have noted, all the workouts are total body workouts. There is no splitting out of body parts. I don't know what the latest research says about which approach is better. Like anything else, I imagine there are conflicting viewpoints, and it may depend upon what you exercise goals are. After just completing a program (Met-Rx) that splits out body parts, I don't think it is a bad thing to try something different.

I have completed the first week of the program, as well as previewed some of the later workouts, and unfortunately, the program has not met my expectations. Some of the workouts are just too short - just 23-24 minutes including the warm up and cool down for some of the Hammer workouts. Based on the promotional material, I thought the workouts would be 30 minutes minimum. I feel like that was a bit of false advertising on the part of Beachbody.  Using my Fitbit with heart rate monitor, I'm finding that I'm not burning that many calories. My average heart rate is below 100 for several of the workouts. For a workout that short, you need to keep people constantly moving and keep the heart rate up the way T25 does to get a high enough calorie burn. You cant have people standing still while a move is being demonstrated by the instructor. The Masters Cardio 16 minute workout (that comes free if you buy the program from Team Beachbody) seemed like it would be a nice add-on to the standard workouts to get a bit more calorie burn and still keep the workouts under an hour.. However it is just a collection of variations on squats and lunges with breaks in between each exercise for the instructors to demo. It doesn't do enough to bring my heart rate up. (Incidentally, this is the only workout where Sagi and Autumn actually team up.) Amazon is charging $20 for it as a standalone workout. That is a rip off. This workout should be priced at $5 or less given its length and lack of sophistication.

I have not tried the nutrition program, but read through it and found it to be too restrictive. For example, it calls for 95% lean ground beef. 93% lean is the leanest ground beef that my local supermarket carries. Also, you don't realize how small the portion control containers are until you actually see them. Yes, you can have multiple containers worth of food, depending on your fitness goals, activity level, and starting weight. However, you need to chop or dice all of your food to fit it into the containers and actually have them function as an accurate measuring device. They are too small to even include standard size celery or carrot sticks.

My other criticism of the program is that the modifier demonstrates how to modify the exercises if you don't have a bench or pull up bar, but doesn't modify for lower impact. My girlfriend has plantar fasciitis and sometimes needs to use a low impact modifier.

However, the program is not totally useless as long as you find a way to get in some extra cardio to burn enough calories. I do think some of the Chisel workouts are good workouts. I really feel them working my leg muscles and glutes from different angles than most other workouts. They also have a balance component that you rarely see used in conjunction with weight training (with the exception of P90X2) and add an addition dimension.

I looked at some reviews on Amazon and the program is getting a fair amount of criticism. However I feel some of it is unwarranted. For example, someone gave it one star because they feel Autumn shows too much cleavage. This is a woman who markets herself as a bikini model. I don't know what this person expected. Her attire in these videos are probably less revealing than what she wears in a bikini competition. Autumn is in no way suggestive or flirty in any of the videos. She takes a no nonsense approach to instruction. She never even flashes a phony smile the way may women in fitness videos do. I never got the impression that her intentions were anything other than demonstrating proper form.

I also noted that many people think the workouts are too easy. I have to think that it is somewhat related to the shortness of the workouts, but also has to be the result of people not using heavy enough weights. That is the beauty of a program that is based on weights; you can make it harder by using heavier weights.  If you look like Segi, you shouldnt use a 15 pound weight just because Autumn does. You need to use a weight that challenges you without compromising form. Both Autumn and Segi probably should have emphasized this point more.

With that being said, this workout is not as extreme as P90x, Insanity, or Body Beast. However in the marketing that I have seen, I don't think it claims to be. For those that think that Beachbody only sells extreme workouts, I encourage you to take a look at some of their earlier programs like Rockin Body (Shaun T) or Great Body Guaranteed (Tony Horton). They are definitely beginner programs much less challenging than this program.

I will update this review after I complete more of the program.

**************************************Update after completing program************************************************

I have completed the program, and I'm pretty much going to stick with my original opinion. There are some decent workouts. I would be shocked if anyone doesn't find Hammer Power to be a challenging workout. While Chisel Balance doesn't get your heart rate up, it does challenge your balance in unique ways. However, overall, the program just doesn't burn enough calories. There are some really awful workouts that should have never even been filmed. Chisel Agility is an absolute joke. It is the closest thing this program has to a true cardio workout. (Chisel Cardio is actually a hybrid workout that makes extensive use of weights.)  The ""agility"" portion of it isn't that challenging and Autumn breaks after each exercise to demo the next one. This results in a low average heart rate and few calorie burned. While I accept skepticism when people say the whole program is too easy, I think anyone who thinks this workout is too easy has a point.  ISO Speed Hammer is also a terrible workout. This workout is only 23-24 minutes including warm up and cool down. It is a total body ""concentric fast, eccentric slow"" workout. You just can't get in enough exercises in this short amount of time to make it worth the time to put on your workout gear and getting your DVD player going. Hammer Plyometrics is only slightly longer and suffers from the same issues.

The only parts of my body that I think got more toned from this workout are my quads, hamstring and glutes. Many reviewers have said that this is primarily a lower body workout, which is true, but is really more nuanced than that. There are a fair number of chest and back exercises, but only a few workouts incorporate bicep and tricep exercises. I think my performance in bicep curls has actually declined a bit after using this program.

I would only recommend this workout for people that want to focus on lower body (especially glutes), or people that want a significant balance component to their workout program. If you have other priorities, such as getting big biceps, this is definitely not the workout for you.",1452384000,17,9062,4.639027431421447

Sagi is everything I hate in a man, conceited, over muscled, and generally a gym type meat head. Autumn isn't much better, most annoying is her plastic surgery breasts like the other demo girls..mine shrank as I got more fit...so you can't convince me hers are real. I think I could mute them both and not look at them if there was anything new to the workout, but there's not anything I've seen in this that wasn't in P90x3",1452297600,11,696,4.403100775193798

The 21 day fix portion containers and the eating program are worth the cost of the program  not to mention the base kit comes with  12 new workouts.  Nutrition is a big part of this program and the eating plan, with the portion control containers is very doable. I love the emphasis on agility training as well.

And i am now a few weeks In On the hammer 30 Day calendar i must say that i Think it work wonders My bench squat and deadlift Are going up and i credit This for the increased training frequency , i have Read some studies that Favor frequency over a lot of volume In One session a week , in This  program you Will Not Do a ton of volume for chest or anny other body part In a single session but rather its spread throughout the week if you count you hit your muscle multiple times a week and you get to Do more practcing with the lifts squat bench and deadlift variations and accessory movement ( i use a barbell and rack for the Big 3 ) and if you count sets and reps you Will see that the total acumulated volume for each muscle is close to or even higher that In a High volume program Like body beast ( i Think i May have counted In bulk chest you aprox 21-23 set total for chest In 30 Day hammer over the course of the week you Do aprox 17-20 sets for chest but In hammer you Will get more quality heavy work In because you Are NOT fatigued by 15th set On chest day)  Masters hammer also offer a higer training frequency which studies May suggest is more advantageous.  so In My opinion This program have its merrits and May be more optimal than Low frequency once a week body part training Not to say that don't work Like i Said have had great results with beast and Wendler and will prob.

7489172,2,B0172D7ZZU,"I don't like the gym. With that being said, Beachbody has been my fitness source for the past ten years. Like many customers, I started with P90X and then moved on to Insanity, P90X3 and Insanity Max 30. I love these programs. I've also done Tapout XT, XT2, Ruthless, Met-RX 180 and Supreme 90. All of these workouts have something to offer and most of them switch up the routines enough so I didn't get bored.

The creators of The Master's Hammer and Chisel were lazy. Total Body workouts. All of these routines are total body workouts with the same moves repeated. That isn't even my biggest concern. My biggest concern is that recovery is not accounted for with this program. I'm a big believer in letting muscles rest between routines and not overworking a single muscle group every single day. This program blasts the same muscles everyday and that doesn't work for me. I had high hopes for this program and Beachbody dropped the ball. Just my opinion.

7489174,4,B0172D7ZZU,"Background: I am not a beachbody coach or employee. I have been doing home fitness for 2 years plus change with my wife. Together we have completed two rounds of P90X, two rounds of P90X3, one round of Chalean extreme, and 3 rounds of Body Beast and have created hybrids with  Les Mills Combat/PiYo. I have not done any of the Shaun T workouts but have tried insanity and T25 which were not to my personal training preferences. I have done a tough mudder and a sprint triathlon.
This is a preliminary review as I have done the first two weeks of the program. I felt its necessary to start writing this review earlier than usual as I have seen some bad reviews that I think are misguided. This program is NOT Body Beast 2.0. It is not P90x series like, it is definitely not Shaun T like. Body Beast is an excellent program for people looking to bulk up and who are into body building without a lot of cardio. P90x series are more about overall fitness. P90x more focused on individual muscles with more weights, P90x3 a good mix of different styles of fitness not many weights.
So far what is this program like: Its a collection of total body workouts with different focus on isometric, eccentric and concentric movements with an emphasis on core. As far as I can tell the purpose of these workouts are not to bulk you up but to get you ripped. This is not a workout for beginners. period. You need some prior knowledge and experience with weight training/pull ups and balance moves. Every workout uses a combination of weights, pull ups and push ups. Some movements are more classic movements, some are complex movements and in the first week there is a lot of focus on balance. In terms of preferred a equipment, you will need a bench and a stepper, a large range of dumbbells depending on your strength and ideally a pull up tower with pull up assist.
Are the workouts challenging? It all depends on your choices in weights, repetition and the equipment that you have. You have to get to know the workouts and the exercises of each workout and your gonna have to adjust your weights accordingly to make sure you are pushing yourself to the max. Some of the forms of some exercises are very challenging as they require a lot of balance and focus on the form. You cannot guide yourself by what the persons in the videos are using, especially Autumn who uses very light weights vs. Sagi who uses really variable weights some extremely high. Some workouts are easier and some are extremely difficult. This variation might frustrate people. I can tell you that after I have adjusted weights I am appropriately sore. I would recommend repeating each week twice to get to know the exercises better and adjusting the weights appropriately.

Pros:
-Different from anything else in the beachbody catalogue
-Change to total body workouts with weights
-Challenging

Cons (Most of these are not my own cons but I can see other persons getting bothered by them)
-Revealing exercise wear for some of the females, especially Autumn (Doesn't bother me)
-A lot of pull ups and push ups (Doesn't bother me)
-Autumn is a talker and at times seems to struggle with some of the exercises. (Bother me a little)
-Persons not familiar with Sagi might be put off by the tempo of how he exercises. Very different from Autumn. (Doesn't bother me)
-Not great advise for beginners on which weights to choose (Doesn't bother me)
-Most workouts are total body workouts which might be off putting for Body Beast graduates. (Doesn't bother me)
-Calendar schedule extremely varied and not repetitive which in the beginning might be challenging in terms of figuring out which weights to use. (Doesn't bother me)
-Large range of times between workouts. First week ranges from 25mins - 52 mins. This lack of time uniformity might be off putting for some. (Doesn't bother me)
-Steep learning curve in terms of getting the form right in some of the exercises (Doesn't bother me)
-Not for beginners (Doesn't bother me)

Conclusions: Are they effective? I believe so but what the final results will be are yet to be determined. Should you buy this? Depends on what your looking for. This is a very unique product. Download the worksheets and calendar and buy based on what you see and if you have appropriate equipment.

7489175,3,B0172D7ZZU,"I own 15 Beachbody Workout Programs. I'm a p90x, Insanity, Insanity Max 30, and P90x3 graduate. I'm a runner and an all around home gym rat. My wife and I just completed Insanity Max 30 and both agreed that with it, Beachbody has finally perfected the home workout routine. But you can't do Max30 forever. The Master's Hammer and Chisel seemed to be that long awaited, perfect combination of Weight-Lifting and Cardio that so many home fitness enthusiasts want. But, overall I think it falls short with low intensity workouts, ho-hum routines. There are several workouts that I'm glad to add to our constantly rotating hybrid calendars, but overall I'm disappointed. Shaun T would laugh these workouts off as rehab.

Beachbody's success came from extreme home fitness programs like P90x and Insanity. I get that they are trying to reach out to different fitness levels, but from the Beachbody fans I know, especially through blogs and forums, we love the Extreme part of home fitness that Beachbody has brought to millions.

I love working out hard, but I don't want to feel like I'm gonna die in EVERY workout so I'm glad that BB has some variety (T25 and p90x3) but I don't expect great results from these ho-hum workouts.

Perhaps the biggest issue is that the instructors (mainly Autumn) assume a very low level of fitness know-how from their viewers. This means lengthy descriptions of how to do a plank or a lunge. Cues are great, but don't make me just stand there watching. ShaunT has perfected this simply by starting the move and cueing while you are already under way. This makes a major difference in the intensity and the energy of the workout. This may be my biggest disappointment and I'm surprised some big-shot at Beachbody didn't catch this. However, I get around it by mentally preparing to extend all the moves 15-30 seconds so I'm not resting after every exercise.

Oh yeah... also perhaps we could remind a certain fitness instructor to find more appropriate workout attire? Apparently Autumn only works out in her underwear. I'm not even griping about spandex or a sports bra... I guess I get that. Just don't tell me that much cleavage is necessary for unrestricted movement... we all know what's going on here.",1451952000,9,2235,4.827676240208877
7489176,1,B0172D7ZZU,I am a big fan of P90x and Insanity Max and I like some of the T25 workouts but I wanted to try something different so I thought I would try this program.  When I got to the Chisel DVDs I couldn't help but notice that Autumn and almost all of the females shown in the Chisel DVDs appear to have had Breast augmentation surgery. Autumn is showing significant cleavage in many of the workouts and I am disappointed that Beachbody is sexualizing fitness. They are marketing this program as a way to sculpt your ultimate physique but without plastic surgery women are not this lean and this well endowed. I prefer to see fitness models with bodies that can be achieved through workouts and eating sensibly rather than plastic surgery.,1451952000,23,730,4.572519083969466
7489177,4,B0172D7ZZU,"I will ""reluctantly"" give this a very slight edge over P90X3.
And only because Sagi's full body routines are actually pretty good.
The chisel routines are ""ok"", but in my opinion you can do as good by substituting cardio with some calisthenics.
While it lacks a stretching or flexibility workout, you could do one for 15-20 minutes on the rest day and benefit without hurting the program.
I may personally replace the chisel workouts with MMX or some kickboxing.
Still, another pretty solid program from two pros and Beach Body.",1451952000,7,528,4.877777777777778

The pace is moderate and not rushed and the variety is good.  I like Autumn, and Sagi is a lot ""softer"" in these DVDs compared to ""Body Beast"".  There are modifications shown where needed and equipment can also be substituted (for example a stability ball in lieu of a bench, or resistance tubes with door attachment in lieu of chin bar).  Basically all workouts include weights, even the Cardio DVD.  Compound movements all the way.  - I don't use the containers nor the meal plan.",1451779200,6,762,4.392857142857143

As someone that truly loved the Body Beast program I can tell you that this is just a watered down, built for the masses, whole body version of that. Body Beast was an amazing workout program that truly gave you the ability to build a ton on muscle without ever going to the gym. Hammer and Chisel doesn't even compare to this. The workouts are laughably easy and at times ridiculously short. I hope Sagi enjoys the fat stack of cash he got from this because he really has alienated his fans from Body Beast. He sold out on this.",1451779200,10,639,4.289256198347108
7489180,4,B0172D7ZZU,"I think a lot of the early hating on this program is primarily due to what it isn't versus what it is. This isn't Body Beast, and it isn't a continuation of 21 Day Fix. It's cardio resistance training with a focus on total body fitness, rather than a traditional weight lifting approach that works a muscle group to failure. If you're into Body Beast, you'll probably hate this. If you're into 21 Day Fix, you'll probably find Sagi insufferable, and the videos hard to master. If you're looking for the cliff's notes version, I think it's comparable to X3 but with more legs. The nutrition plan is bizarre. But in reality, it's a good set of workouts that's part of a pretty lousy overall program.

About me: I'm a 38 year old mom of 2 that is a decentish (barely BQ) distance runner in the summer. I hate the treadmill, and I've found that videos keep me in decent shape in the winter. I've done P90X, X3, Insanity and Max 30. I like to mix in PiYo with my running. I hate T25 with every fiber in the fabric of my being (I'm still in counseling over hop hop squat). And Cize? ... Don't even. Overall, I enjoy X3 the most, but I think the workouts in Hammer and Chisel are exactly what I need to maintain my muscle tone, and focus on core and glute strength - which really has been the cornerstone of my increases in speed over the last few years. My biggest gripe about all of Tony Horton's workouts is that he's light on legs. Hammer and Chisel incorporates a lot more leg exercises. There is none of the extreme cardio that is consistent in the Insanity series.  Although I completely enjoyed that series, I found Max30 might be heading down a path of inevitable injury, so I decided to shelve it except for when I've eaten a few too many cookies.

I wasn't sure what to expect. Honestly, Autumn had very little credibility in my mind. Although it has a cult following, my opinion of 21 Day Fix was low. I assumed she was for soccer moms who had no idea about food and nutrition. These workouts really changed my mind. I think she gets it done with none of the goofiness and BS. She's definitely good at demonstrating and explaining the workouts to the point I think she's my new second fave. Sagi makes me giggle. He's what I imagine Tony Horton and Arnold Schwarzenegger's love child would be like, but he's obviously a pro. I think the workouts are scaleable. If you have some experience using weights, you can fine tune your form to target whatever areas need improvement. The increased focus on lower body is a great way to work out core and glutes in the off season. This is a perennial problem for runners.

Overall, I think the workouts are great for runners, cyclists or weekend athletes who are in decent shape but need to add some resistance training into the mix. This is for reasonably athletic folks who don't need to lose a ton of weight and maybe want to feel good enough to play some racquetball after their video.  But because the overall plan is so bad, the series will have limited applicability, making it unpopular with the masses. I like it. Individually, I think the workouts are good. It's not for everybody.",1451779200,123,3136,4.44695652173913

7489182,3,B0172D7ZZU,"So I have been using Beach Body products for about 5 years now. I started with Shawn T and Insanity and loved it. It was intense and I finished every workout exhausted and motivated at the same time. I progressed to Insanity the Asylum both Volumes 1 and 2 and was equally impressed with the results both physically and psychologically. They were different than Insanity but provided the same feelings of accomplishment.

As I slimmed down I missed the muscles I once had from being a regular weight lifter. I tried Body Beast. It provided what I wanted in terms of muscular physique, but basically threw cardio out the window.

Now onto M H&C. I was really looking forward to this product as I hoped it would finally combine the two things I loved about Body Beast and Insanity; the pump from lifting and the cardio blast from Shawn T.

Granted, I am only one week into the program, it is falling a bit flat. The routines are almost too manageable at 30-40 min a piece. I am probably going to try and squeeze 2 workouts in each 1 hour session I have available to workout.

I wish this program would have been the challenge I was looking for. That being said, Beach Body needs to appeal to its long time customers more. Most of what they produce is geared toward people looking to start a fitness program and not to advance one.

For those of us who are accustomed to using Beach Body programs, or who are generally pretty fit, It would be great to have available a more advanced program or have options spelled out by the pro trainers as to how to make their programs more advanced.

It may just be me, but nothing feels better then wanting to collapse at the end of a workout and feeling like I did some real work. Master's Hammer and Chisel could provide this if they made the program more difficult. Plus, results would come in no time.

I would recommend this product with one caveat. Be prepared to make some modifications to the schedule to make it more challenging. Other wise it feels like you are just going through the motions.",1451433600,12,2038,4.462365591397849

I gained 20 lbs over 120 days (I extended the build and bulk phases) but was left with 5-8 lbs of unwanted weight (fat).  I was almost thru (another) round of P90X3 but was happy to try something new.  The only workout I don't care for is Chisel Agility, but then I don't really care for P90X3 agility either.  Also, I don't really care too much for P90X3 pilates or yoga.  I feel like I'm burning plenty of calories, and the workouts seem to stress the entire body while improving overall conditioning and strength, kinda like the original P90X only the workouts are generally shorter and tend to work the entire body.  The workouts alternate between ""Hammer"" with Sagi and ""Chisel"" with Autumn with an option after the 60 days to do a ""Hammer"" program or ""Chisel"" program.  I'm only through 2 weeks and have lost 4 pounds and feel stronger (eating better of course helps) than I did after my last round of Bodybeast..  This is not a program for beginners but is great if you are tired of the same P90X routines.

As a woman who is ""booty challenged,"" I feel like it's missing a good hard leg workout.  That's the issue with these programs, as they cannot be customized to one's body type.  My favorite leg workouts come from Body Beast, so I'm going to incorporate that into this program if I decide to continue.  It's also missing a Yoga workout, which I find to be hugely beneficial for overall fitness.  If you're like me and you are already fit, and like a good hard leg workout and the benefits of yoga, I'd recommend any of the P90x programs or 21-day fix Extreme over this one.  Guys may like Body Beast better, but the problem with that program is there are single workouts that only work the biceps or back.  If you're only gonna focus on one body part in a workout, the legs will give you the most bang for your buck, because they are your largest muscles and it will help amp up your calorie burn for weight loss and getting ripped.  Don't get me wrong, you can get ripped from Hammer and Chisel if you follow the diet plan, but for me, I'm missing the booty building benefits of a good, hard leg workout.
