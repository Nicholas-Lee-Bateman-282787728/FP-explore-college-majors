7624225,5,B002BYYA9A,"A review that equated this film with a comic book made me leery of seeing it. But I am glad I overcame my reluctance at my mate's urging. Rather than the flat, two-dimensional work I expected, I was happily surprised by a masterful mixture of reality and fairy tale, at once enthralling, frightening and (at some moments) excruciating to watch. Despite the pain (in places), at others the film was entirely delightful.

The story is told from the perspective of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) a 12-year-old bewitched by fairy tales,  understandably so, one soon sees: She misses her father, a tailor who died suddenly, and has become the unwilling child of Captain Vidal (Sergi Lpez), the new husband of her pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil), and the father of her baby brother. The scenery is lovely as Ofelia and Carmen drive in a line of security cars to their new rural home in the Spanish countryside.

But Carmen is so ill the cars must stop en route, and Ofelia is attracted to an ancient stone, inhabited by a large noisy flying stick, which she immediately identifies as a fairy.

Bur rural Spain in 1944 is very ominous, something that the flighty Ofelia intentionally escapes through her fascination with fairy tales. Very soon, she is living a fairy tale: the flying stick from the ancient roadside forest stone follows her mother's entourage to their new home at the farm by an abandoned mill.

At night, when the entire household is asleep, the bug flies into the room of Ofelia and her mother, and transforms into a fairy, in earnest, who wordlessly leads Ofelia to a decayed stone labyrinth on the grounds. Upon descending a spiral staircase at its center, Ofelia meets her Pan, the Faun (Doug Jones) who tells her that she is a long lost, immortal subterranean princess, but must perform three tasks to prove herself worthy of coming home and retaining her immortality. Ofelia completes none of these tasks, all mucky and dangerous affairs, without great difficulty.

But for every ugliness and obstacle Ofelia encounters in the Faun's fairy world, she faces an even harsher reality at the farmhouse. Ofelia's mother grows more and more ill, and the cruel Captain separates Ofelia from her mother. He instructs the attending physician, if it comes to that, to save the baby and let her mother die.

Ofelia wanders about the farm grounds on her own, with no one to look out for her but Mercedes (Maribel Verd), the housekeeper who organizes the kitchen, oversees the store closets and seems to meekly attend to the Captain's every need.

As Ofelia pursues her tasks, General Franco's fascist captain grows increasingly determined to crush the resistance still hiding out in the surrounding hills. But the ogres above ground are equaled by other ogres underground, and in the end, it is impossible to separate the tortured reality from the tortured fairy tale.

Many readers consider fairy tales light, children's fare. In truth, such tales over the centuries have always helped people to conceptualize, and thereby conquer, their worst fears. In Pan's Labyrinth, there is a real cost to that conquest. Both in the fairy world, and in life.

Also in both worlds, however, the film emphasizes the undying human determination to defeat fascism along with all accompanying death cults.

An incredible work, a must see film.

""What I believe in lies in the realm of love, not fact."" - Madeleine L'Engle

And with that in mind...

This film opens and closes in blood... Spain - 1944. The Civil War is ended but the fascist government is still fighting the remnants of the Republican Army out in the forests and hinterlands where Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) must go at the request of Carmen's new husband: an insane army Captain (El Capitn Vidal played by Sergi Lpez). Carmen is pregnant with the Captain's son and soon to give birth. Carmen is suffering complications and spends her time forcibly bound to either a wheel chair or bed rest. Ofelia lives in constant fear that the birth will kill her mother. El Capitan cares nothing for Carmen, only for the safe delivery of his son as we see him wrestle with the legacy of his father (a great General and immortalized fallen war hero) and intense self-loathing. The house and countryside is full of spies and sympathizers for the Republican Rebels that Captain Vidal is obsessed with killing. Against this backdrop and within it, is woven the fantasy world of Ofelia's grim fairy tale.

It is revealed early in the film that Ofelia is actually the reincarnated lost soul of a Princess who belongs to a vast Underworld Kingdom and that the Underworld King has been searching far and wide to retrieve his daughter from the land of the mortal human race. Befriended by a magical Faun, Ofelia is given a book and a charge to fulfill 3 noble tasks that will prove her to be the lost princess.

For starters, this is film could be classified by some as a ""World War II Picture"", on par with films such as ""The Piano"" and"" Schindler's List."" There are many moments where the fear of the psychotic, murderous, fascist military officer is reminiscent of those other films but with Pan's Labyrinth there is an added element of Hope that I've never experienced in the face of such overwhelming Evil. This is not a Good vs. Evil story. This is Overwhelming Evil vs. Hope. You know, kinda like life on Planet Earth.

Evil. This movie is shadowed by it in such a way that the entire audience (a sold out show by the way) sat hunched over with it's weight. Evil is enfleshed most effectively by Sergi Lpez the Captain of the Spanish Army outpost where the story takes place.

Hope. Ofelia is Hope. Her knowledge that she is - in one world - a nobody, less than human in the eyes of the world of men and guns and uniforms and war, and in the other world - the Real World - she is ROYALTY. She is a Sovereign, born of Noble Blood, lost in the world of mortals, soon to return home where all will be made right and justice will be done.  Mira!",1168646400,5,2755,4.485029940119761

Nominations ........

*DOUG JONES - Best Supporting Actor.
SERGI LOPEZ???  THIS ARTIST brings a new meaning to 'tortured' soul ~ the shaving scene??  BEST ACTOR!  Look closely.......it will be a true shame if this actor is overlooked [A Young Robert DN].

So? Next?  A quaint remake of ""My 3 Angels"" with Ralph Fiennes ~  Jeremy Irons - Sergi Lopez &  Renee Zellwegwer???

[Another 'plug' review the dinner scene with Lopez and wife .......]

I would happily sell my soul to work with this director.

7624228,4,B002BYYA9A,"If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" (""El Laberinto del Fauno"") is a sequel of sorts to ""The Devil's Backbone,"" a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War. But this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting -- in short, a triumph.

Time and place: 1944, Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi Lpez). Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.

To do so, he tells her that she must do three things, and gives her a strange book. Ofelia menages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. Even worse, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever...

Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares. But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones for adults, that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes ""Pan's Labyrinth"" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt.

Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style and brilliant visuals. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape.

At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the ""real world"" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow. But Del Toro's biggest triumph is an ending that is beautifully bittersweet, and which turns out to hinge on Ofelia's newborn brother.

But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere ""safe."" Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond. And Lpez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.

Half ""Mirrormask"" and half gritty war story, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the best fantasy stories in years -- dark, passionate and beautifully made. Definitely a great movie.",1167436800,,2837,4.775510204081633
7624229,5,B002BYYA9A,"Somewhere between Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"" and Washington Irving's ""Sleepy Hollow"" is ""Pan's Labyrinth""; a movie with more imaginative visuals than anything I've seen in years.

Taking place in postwar Spain, ""Pan"" focuses on Ofelia, a young girl who loses herself in books and fantasy. The story begins when Ofelia moves with her pregnant mother, to live with her mother's new husband; a tyrannical military captain.

With her mother bedridden, Ofelia explores the grounds of their new home and stumbles upon a massive stone labyrinth, which she is told to stay clear of, for fear of getting lost. It is here that we depart into a story of fairies, fauns, giant toads, and other creatures, and other fantastical things too great to spoil.

Like any story with an alternate universe or fantasy creatures, it may seem inevitable to ask: is Ofelia imagining everything she sees? However, to my great pleasure, this film is too true to it's spirit to allow the viewer to have time to ask such questions.

Even as it introduces creatures that carry their eyeballs on a tray, or giants living in a tree, each new character is treated with the same respect and interest as our human heroine. As fantastical visuals of the labyrinth become, each is interwoven into the struggle against the last of the Franco regime without skipping a beat.

With parallels to characters and stories from children's fairy tales found in both the grisly cruelty of war realty, and the fantastical labyrinth, the movie feels steady, while still treading wildly new territory.

It is dark, fantastic, and at times grisly, like most dreams; and it is one of the most dream-like experiences I have ever had at the movies. Highly recommended, certainly one of the best films of the year.",1166659200,5,1770,4.922818791946309
7624230,2,B002BYYA9A,"The colonel has no heart... even George Lucas gave Darth Vader a heart... but Del Toro tried to make two things at once: make a political statement, or I don't know what, by situating the story in a newborn-facist regime and a Fairy Tale... but as Marie-Louise von Franz states in her book ""Shadow and Evil in Fairy Tales"": ""Before we go on I want to point out again in dealing with evil in fairy tales and folklore material the ethical conflict is treated with a kind of natural wisdom rather than with religious awareness of the problem of good and evil. This is very different from the Judeo-Christian tradition which has worked for two thousand years sharpening our conscience to a much more acute awareness of evil and trying to establish absolute rules of behavior."" Del Toro sharpens good and evil and enlarges it so much in the Judeo-Christian tradition that the Fairy Tale part of the film seems so out of context because as Marie-Louise von Franz says: ""But fairy tales only seem to be innocent stories. They are so profound that one cannot explain them superficially; they require that one dive into deep waters."" But at the end of this film I wanted to dive into the popcorn I had finished long time ago. I had gotten hypnotized by the beautiful visual effects. But at the end I just saw another good an evil film with absolute rules (the bad is always bad and the good, good). Terrible film in the Judeo-Christian tradition... two stars for the beautiful effects... chau.",1164240000,8,1484,4.64638783269962

7624312,5,B002BYYA9A,Guillermo del Toro offers a hallucinatory vision of the Spanish Civil War rooted in European folklore.

7624315,1,B002BYYA9A,"Politics and religion : the subjects we are enjoined to avoid... unless one makes a movie.  I have no vested interest in the Spanish Civil War.  But I can tell blatant propaganda and straw men when I see them.  This is such a film, created under the guise of a pantheistic fable.  All the Nationalists are bloody murderers who wear jackboots and torture for fun (the ""violence"" often mentioned); the Clergy, of course, is given its opportunities for evil. Meanwhile, the Republicans are simple peasants fighting for peace and justice.  I think nether was the case : sadly, it was, in fact, a war.

The ""fantasy"" part is a mere masquerade to promote Lopez's take on political history.  As though Crazy Horse made a movie about the European conquest of North America, with the benevolent Great Spirit juxtaposing how wonderful things used to be. Rousseau the filmmaker.  But there was a lot more going on than that.  I think I'll stick with Star Wars.

The story itself was confusing.  The production, special effects, and acting were quite good.",1520121600,,1044,4.808988764044944

7624333,5,B002BYYA9A,"People complaining about the brutality of the film are People with weak constitutions and they don't understand the plot and what is happening around it. This movie is about hope in a hopeless world that a princess undergo for trying to find out what the human world is like and forgetting who she is. She needs to died in order to return back to her father's underworld kingdom. So, if you know the plot and understanding it's surroundings and still complain, then you need to watch the little mermaid and read or research the movie before you knock it. The acting is superb, the special effects great and the plot is great too. Yes, a bit violent and a few wonderful special effects showing things that are very real and this is where people with a weak constitution have issues with it. It's too real. That alone should make it great and not a sad depressing movie. Life is what it is and human are violent creatures by nature and so is everything else. Get a grip and enjoy the creativity of others and if you don't like it then don't watch it, buy it or rent it. Simple stick with your double standard type of simple minded and shield your precious little ones from it and just enjoy it yourself with your spouse or friends. Little kids have lots of cartoons and other films that can bring them joy. This movie is not for kids. Keep them away from it and enjoy it when they are not around. The movie rocks and it shows how evil humans can be with one another and how power corrupts. Nothing we don't know about it. We should learn from it and stop being so mean to each other and that is all. That is how we will protect our children, by learning from it and stop pretending we are so good when we don't even take care of the very air they breath not along their food future and education plus everything else we do wrong. Learn that is my advise. Enjoy",1517184000,,1858,4.311428571428571
7624334,5,B002BYYA9A,"Always one of my favorite movies. Guillermo del Toro is a visionary, a genius. Every single frame tells a dozen stories. I've watched this movie dozens of times and every time, I see or hear something new that makes it like the first time all over again. I love it.",1517097600,,265,4.32
7624335,1,B002BYYA9A,"This is one of the darkest, most horribly violent films I've ever seen. It's all the more nausea-inducing because it's shamelessly manipulative, in that it's gorgeously photographed and the presence of a little girl makes you think it's a children's movie. But it's not - it's as violent as any snuff film, and the scenes of wartime brutality exceed even some of those made about the Holocaust. Even the fantasy figures are drenched in various bodily fluids and are abusive toward the girl.

The film features one scene of abuse followed by another. The women are always in despair and crying (as is the girl) and the father is a one-note sadist and psychopath who enjoys torturing people. There are no heroes who come and save the day, only a sense of hopelessness all around. Even the fantasy figures are mean-spirited and abusive.

How this film won rave reviews: the acting is good, the cinematography is seductively attractive, and people often mistake depressing films for being ""serious"" and therefore, of high quality. But this film offers no vision of real hope, and if you weren't depressed before watching this, you will be afterwards.",1517097600,,1146,4.932642487046632

A. ""The message in this film conflicts with my religious beliefs, so I don't like it"" or ""the message in this film agrees with my religious views so I like it""
and
B. ""This was a well made (or poorly made) film (elaboration...)""

Stop writing reviews.
Your limited experience and lack of critical thinking skills make what you write a waste of time and space! Lose your mental shackles, grow a bit, learn a lot, and THEN write a review.

This film was darkly original and beautifully made; a visual odyssey and feast for the senses, exposing both ignorant tyrannical ideas (personified in the Franco-esque villains of the Spanish civil war, instigated by the ignorance espoused by domineering religious fanaticism) and the strength of pure individualism, personified by the breathtaking courage of the lead female characters.

It's critical PINNACLE message places the highest value on independent thinking, a concept usually lost on the single minded religious folk.

7624343,5,B002BYYA9A,"This movie is not for everyone. It is dark; very dark. But it is cold and gruesome in the most beautiful of ways. Captivating plot, magnificent acting, beautiful CG and costumes, along with heavy doses of realistic elements of life make this a masterpiece. That being said, I've seen this movie twice since it came out. Even though I want to watch it again and again, it just hurts too much to do so. When I gather up the courage to watch it again, I definitely will and it will have a permanent top place on my collection shelf.

A dark fairy tale taking root among an even darker reality. At times, the viewer can't be sure which is more terrifying - the world we see before us or the frightening fantasy of a lonely child's dreams. Is what we are being shown reality? Or are we privy to a vivid imagination of a lonely girl? Most importantly, does it really matter?",1515715200,3,868,4.3580246913580245

-First of all, the movie takes place in South America and is completely in Spanish. Peter Pan takes place in London and is in English!!!!
-Secondly, this movie contains violent and scary imagery, probably not super good for young kids expecting a flying pre-teen whisking people away to an imaginary dream world where you can live forever as a child.
-Third, there was no maze in Peter Pan!

Overall the movie was visually pretty good and had an interesting and dynamic plot with well developed characters (hence the one star), BUT BUYER BEWARE, this is not in anyway a Peter Pan movie.",1515628800,,774,4.768656716417911

Also lacking...a big question...the motive for how legend began;  what would cause somebody to want to be and live as a human being,if they are immortal?  there was no backstory to this, i cannot think of ANY reason why you'd want to become a frail, weak little human in a diseased world where death & destruction reigns, at fault of your own species.  what would drive her to wish of such things?  there's no motive or a "" princess  ""  to leave her home , give up her strength & all the love surrounding her,  just to go to a world of death, destruction of the lands, chaos, war, & disease, all created  by humanity.  this is taking a dreamlike perfect or relatively so world she was in, and her wishing of a very pained one, instead.  what drove her?  Was she greedy?  did she wish of things she did not have, or was she determined to find out why humans are so evil, so she wanted to observe them, or something???",1510790400,,1630,4.288524590163934

It was cool to bond over the artistry, mythical imagination and  goodness of morels surrounded in a dark world.
He was super stoked to go to The Guillermo del Toro exhibit, 'At Home With Monsters'. It helped me convey the need to express artfully, thoughtfully and to recognize beauty in darkness without mindless violence.

Most of the film takes place outside the labyrinth and is essentially a grim and bloody war drama which I wasn't really expecting or hoping to see as it simply isn't that interesting. It feels like two separate films and it doesn't gel that well. As I said if it was more fantasy and had more emotion I wouldve liked it more, but most of the film is centered around this war drama which is essentially two groups in a game of cat and mouse and it's just not very gripping or exciting. I wanted this to be a fantasy/horror but its more of a war film with some of those elements thrown in.

A methodical almost sadistic violence. So, beyond that, the brutality of the man world and utopian allusions in a world where nothing is sacred is used to tell a christian story...
Some would consider the symbolic characters as a form of pantheism but in my view I think that they are used to tell us that nobody is who they seem to be.

In order to understand the small nuances, and even the entire film and it's finale, one has to know a bit of Spanish history and also a lot about the brutality of any dictatorship.  One of my favorite parts is when the Doctor tells the Captain about obeying blindly and the kind of people who do that, the film is full of these little gems, of double meanings and magical truths.  Also using Spanish not just the Castilian language, but Spanish actors is a stroke of brilliance, because it is the most beautiful language in the universe, it is powerful, precise and expressive like no other language at conveying meaning and emotions with words.  Those who are lucky to understand it or are Spanish-American, get a double treat.  I have watched many times, will watch it many more and relish it every single time.

The movie is in Spanish but does have English subtitles, which helps me in particular because my fluency in Spanish (Castellano) isn't what it once was.

7624499,5,B002BYYA9A,"""Pan's Labyrinth"" is an adult fantasy-drama which takes place in Spain right around the time when the Fascists there were in league with the Nazi's and all their cronies. The film is made from the viewpoint of a girl whose mother is married to a Captain in the Spanish Fascist military and how she plunges herself into a world of fantasy to escape the violence and oppression of those who surround her. Labyrinth is an excellent film that garnered a 20 minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival, so if you are a tweenie-bopper who hates subtitles or are not able to comprehend complex historical subtexts that require deeper thought perception, you will probably not like it. For those who appreciate films of high caliber and deeply symbolic meaning, this is a wondrous movie you won't soon forget. This is not a children's movie because of the adult themes and some scenes with fairly graphic violence, so be forewarned not to watch it with your five-year-old. As for the negative reviews left by people low on the bell-curve because their DVD didn't play right, or they refuse to watch movies with subtitles, or they don't know how to turn on the subtitles, or they are one of the minions of narcoleptic viewers these days who ""fall asleep"" during movies, please ignore them. Those people are either mentally lazy, mentally stunted or simple-minded and should be ignored at all costs. Too bad more movies like this are not available, as this is a masterpiece that melds serious themes and CGI fantasy together in an unusual epic achievement.",1507420800,,1554,4.823970037453184

7624519,5,B002BYYA9A,"As others have already observed this movie is awesome!  However, I felt I should add my voice to the chorus of those singing its praises.  Even though I have been in the USA since I was 2 years old and I am an American citizen I am also a native Spanish speaker having learned the language from my parents.  Given all the hateful sentiment in the USA surrounding all thing Hispanic and Spanish since the 2016 election season kicked off I decided to return to my roots and watch this movies without English sub-titles.  All I can say is wow!  If you are lucky enough to be a multi-lingual person and if Spanish is one of those languages this is definitely a film you want to add to your collection.  Make sure you watch it *without* the English subtitles. It will be far more enjoyable and it will help you brush up on your Spanish. Quite simply the story is breathtakingly beautiful and sad at the same time.  What I like the most is how this movie juxtaposes (Guillermo's own words) the world of the fantastic with the absolute brutality of the Spanish civil war.  One of my great uncles was a colonel in the Spanish military who had a reputation for being a butcher.  The antagonist in this story Captain Vidal reminds me very much of my ancestor.  We were so ashamed of that man's brutality that my grandmother kept our relations to him a family secret!",1504224000,7,1356,4.431451612903226

7624521,5,B002BYYA9A,"Don't let the cover scare you away. It's not a horror movie. Be warned: It's got some violence moments, some briefly gruesome, even scary moments, but the beauty of a little girl's imagination, the fairy tale that she is destined to personify--the film portrays an experience for those of us who get lost in our imagination. So many facets of humanity are displayed as a little girl struggles to understand her place, and the film is really a testament to Del Toro's (If I'm not mistaken) work. There are only so many films that were made so carefully, executed with not just commercial success in mind but actual love for the work itself, and I'd say that this is one of them.

It may be not what most people would traditionally watch (I believe it's in Portuguese, just deal with the subtitles!), but it's a story you don't want to miss.",1503792000,,839,4.556291390728477

There's a lot of different emotions to explore in it's wide cast of characters, along with it's complex setting of a revolutionary war; yet instead the film focuses solely on pain. The protagonist is in pain, the mother is in pain, the soldiers on both sides are in pain, and that never amounts to any interesting character development.

7624560,5,B002BYYA9A,"My previous experience with Guillermo Del Toro is Hellboy 2, which came out 2 years after this. This movie goes *way* harder than that one, though, hence the R-rating versus the PG-13 rating on Hellboy.

I don't know much about cinema or story when it comes to reviewing, but I will say that the acting is great (The movie is in Spanish but that doesn't detract much from it at all), the music is pretty good, and the concept and appearance of all of the fantasy stuff is stellar. If you've seen Hellboy or Hellboy 2, you have an idea of the kind of creatures you're in for.

If you want something that's a bit of a thriller, bit of an R-rated fairy tale, this is a good choice.

And if that doesn't convince you, here's a quote by a good friend of mine to help convince you: ""That little girl handled that stick-bug that looked like it had spent the last two weeks at the gym chugging whey powder and benching small children better than I handle seeing a bumble bee.""",1490227200,6,968,4.3076923076923075

7624563,5,B002BYYA9A,"Many people have regurgitated the synopsis of this movie, so I'll spare the retelling. Beyond the obviously observable, this movie as an entity, a totality, is an exploration into the modern era's imbalance between the masculine and feminine, the schism and disparity rendering pain, tragedy and turmoil. The decent of the spiritual being (Olefia) into the material realm, a lost soul searching for return to the wholeness of being; her mother and father, king and queen. The spiral staircase as the direct symbol of that delving into various aspects  of the consciousness and levels of existence. This isn't a war movie, it isn't about a girl fabricating a false reality to cope. It's a synthesis of relatable ""reality"" (WW2) with an imagined reality. The final struggle come to fruition through personal sacrifice over personal gain. The preservation of innocence. It is a description of the spiritual alchemical process Jung wrote extensively on. Each character representing an important personal aspect or characteristic which when severely out of balance can wreak havoc on us. A masterpiece of storytelling. A masterpiece of visual art.

7624569,5,B002BYYA9A,"A melancholy fable set in the chaos of Civil War-era Spain.  A young girl escapes her oppressive surroundings by entering a world of seemingly endless possibilities - a world of fairies and fauns and kings and princesses.  Against a relatively normal backdrop, the story would probably falter but the fascist backdrop of Franco's regime makes this girl's wish to escape all the more compelling.  Without revealing much, she finds her new world almost as demanding as the one she's already in.  The backdrop is impressive, if not totally compelling - it seems almost rude to question her sanity given what she sees and hears every day.  You root for a girl whose fate is all too clear and, by extension, what she believes in.  Through the mystery of the labyrinth and all the creatures therein, you find the divisions of the Civil War and the truth of the main character therein.",1487808000,14,878,4.781456953642384

I would give the movie itself 5 stars. I'm only deducting a star on this review because I purchased the ""multi-format"" option under the assumption it would be the Blu-Ray + DVD copy, but apparently it is *ONLY* the Blu-Ray disc. Still worth the $7.99 I suppose, but a bit misleading with the ""multi-format"" claim as it only comes in Blu-Ray format.

I would be surprised if there were even 10 minutes total running time of fantasy and fairy tale. Instead we were treated to a long, drawn-out, rather dull story of torture and abuse and senseless violence amidst a civil war.

There is praise on the box claiming this movie is on the same altar as Lord of the Rings. What a farce. I have been trying to come up with some praise, that maybe if you went into this movie knowing what it was and that there were only tiny helpings of fantasy and fairy tale, it might be passable, but I feel even that is a stretch.

7624661,5,B002BYYA9A,"From the cover, this looks like another Harry Potter movie, but no Harry Potter movie causes you to ask: How does one make sense of a senseless war?  Could acts of such atrocity and brutality have really happened?  Pan's Labyrinth shows the Spanish Civil War partially from the perspective of a child.  For those who are unfamiliar, this took place during WWII, and the film elicits a similar kind of time/tone as in WWII movies.  But what makes this movie so brilliant and unique is that it mixes these fantastical elements with the atrocities of war to get you to ask ""could that really have happened, or did the character just imagine it?"" about both the fantasy and the brutality.

This is a classic war movie that everyone should see.  It's been a few days since I watched it, and I can't stop thinking about itand it's breaking my heart in the most amazing way.  I'm not surprised it received a 22 minute standing ovation at its release.",1478304000,,943,4.5773809523809526

Overall, I wouldn't recommend it. One good thing about it is the special effects and creativity of the characters. I also wonder how much is lost in translation :/",1476835200,4,453,4.675

The Company of Wolves is another dark adult fairytale I would recommend. You soon get used to the subtitles as you're drawn dreamlike into the story and the Spanish accent is deliciously spoken by the faun Pan..in fact it's quite hypnotic listening to the dialogue. The Spanish for moon being ""luna"" sounds so much more enchanting! And fairy tales from eastern Europe told long ago about witches,goblins,fairies etc were told originally between adults and were MEANT to be frightening. They were told to children no doubt to make them stay in bed and sleep...or else!",1472947200,,727,5.275862068965517

Military posts are set up to exterminate this Resistance. Ofelia is the 10-year-old Spanish girl who is the main character.

Captain Vidal is an officer at one of these military posts fighting to eliminate the armed Resistance. Captain Vidal is a callous, flagitious [expletive deleted] that subjects those in his company to heinous brutality. His atrocious actions come back to bite him in the derrire. Ofelia, to escape her horrifying living conditions, creates in her mind an imaginary, fantasy world to maintain her sanity.

7624907,5,B002BYYA9A,"The film,El Laberinto Del Fauno, also known as, Pans Labyrinth in English, fills the viewer with a rollercoaster of emotions from beginning to end with compassion, hope, anger, sadness, disbelief, and happiness. Who can disagree when a film like this merges such fantasy and reality into one amazing tale as one follows the journey of a lost soul who is reborn into a dark time where she finds out she may actually be a princess. Guillermo Del Toro is known for many like, The Orphanage (2007), Julias Eyes (2010), Mama (2013), Pacific Rim (2013), and Thev Book Of Life (2014). Expect greatness coming from Del Toros work of art.
Pans Labyrinth takes place in Spain, 1944. This was years after the Spanish Civil War but in the midst of another battle between the Spanish guerrillas and the Francoists. Ofelia who is the young girl in this journey travels with her pregnant mother; Carmen, to the Francoist Captain Vidals location out in a deep forest, near an old maze besides the mill. Ofelia finds her way into this old labyrinth made of old rocks and looks much abandoned by humans at least, where she meets the Faun who unfolds who she may be, but has to prove that she is this princess he speaks of.
The main characters are a young girl, Ofelia, who becomes Princess Moanna (Ivana Baquero), her servant, and the Faun (Doug Jones), who also plays the Pale Man. Her pregnant and ill mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil), her new, evil and lunatic of a Stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergio Lopez), and his housekeeper, as well as a revolutionist, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu).
Intense and realistic scenes acted by the cast in Pans Labyrinth are found throughout the film. Theres a scene where Vidals men have caught a hunter and his son claiming they were there to hunt rabbits for their familys meal. Vidal loses his patience and smashes the bottle into the hunters face until he is left without one. Jones also brings both of his characters alive. How still he sat at his table without moving a single inch during his act as the Pale Man waiting for Ofelia to take a bite out of the food on the table. As if being a statue and not an actual actor behind all the effects, makeup, and costume. Baqueros convincing role as Ofelia, the curious girl who loved to read fairy tale books and recited to her moms tummy, speaking to her brother as if he would be calmed by her story telling.
The mythical creatures like the Faun and fairies were brought to life with help of makeup, CGI, animatronics, and computer imagery. Jones had been made up with elf like ears, a pair of heavy goat horns, mostly blind with the white in his eyes, and had animal like legs to create The Faun. Another example is the stick bug that waits on Ofelia's arrival to the mill and changes into a fairy with leafy wings when she asks the bug if its a fairy like the ones in her fairy tales. Even the fat, slimy frog she finds inside of a lifeless tree, who is surrounded by all these roaches and slaps Ofelia's hand to retrieve his food from her not knowing that it would kill him..
 Pans Labyrinth will drag you from your seat with the realism of modern day war, but also with the dark fantasy it brings when you enter what lies beneath the earths surface. It is an amazing film for those that like a mix between horror, fairytales, and realism. This film brings great sound, music, special effects, and an unforgettable cast whose chemistry makes this film both believable and unpredictable.",1453075200,2,3452,4.576736672051696

7624910,5,B002BYYA9A,"This is one of those special films that only a genius like Guillermo Del Toro could make. The story in Pan's Labyrinth is that during the spanish civil war of the 40's a young girl named Ofelia and her pregnant mother move to a military camp with her new step father who is captain. While there, she meets a fairy who leads her to an underground labyrinth where she meets the Faun. The Faun promises her great things if she can complete 3 tasks. Very Alice in Wonderland like. And if it isn't obvious already since it's a movie made by a spanish director, with spanish actors, set in spain, yes it is a spanish language movie. The actors are all excellent. Little Ofelia is one of film's finest young heroines, Sergi Lopez is brilliant as the character that you just can't stomach, and Doug Jones the actor who is always seen but under plenty of make up and prosthetics as opposed to his natural appearance, is the only man for the job with characters like the Faun and the Pale Man. The story does a great job of interweaving the scenes of fantasy with the harsh reality of the war and life with her militant, aggressive father. The practical effects of the film and the CGI effects alike are both absolutely stunning, the general cinematography and visual presentation of the movie is incredible. To conclude, Pan's Labyrinth is one of Del Toro's finest and one of the best films of this century.",1452643200,,1398,4.529644268774703

7624918,5,B002BYYA9A,"Review For Mondo X Limited Edition Steelbook

El laberinto del fauno (Pan's Labyrinth) is a fantasy film from the director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy,The Devil's Backbone,Hobbit). Everyone should know the film but for those who don't i will quote the plot from IMDB ""In the falangist Spain of 1944, the bookish young stepdaughter of a sadistic army officer escapes into an eerie but captivating fantasy world.""

The Main Draw for me was the Steelbook itself, iv seen the movie countless time's and wanted to have a collectable version of the movie that would showcase my love for the film and del toro. Upon receiving this steelbook the first thing i noticed was the protective sleeve underneath the plastic, most steelbooks don't have these and you would have to purchase them separate and that it was included shocked me, the protective sleeve also has images and the information about the release and special features and a great touch. There are images on the front,back and inside of the steelbook itself and looking at pictures online don't really show how gorgeous the product really is, once you hold it as a collector i'm almost positive you will be more then pleased. There are two disc (One DVD, One Blu-ray) inside on the right side of the case, my guess for putting both disc on the right is so you can view the artwork on the left but still if you want to see the full image u have to take all the disc out. The next surprise is on the disc themselves, there not just disc from another version but there labels match this exact release and that really just seals the complete packaging into perfection. This review was more so for the steelbook, but i just fell in love with and had to share",1451433600,,1706,4.627062706270627

7624923,5,B002BYYA9A,"Director Guillermo del Toro out did himself and created a film beyond any previous presentation. Although he purposely applied many layers both technologically and psychologically, the actual finished product is deeper and has many more facets. This could be the results of leaving loose ends and just implications. What looks like two stories is really one story where one reality intertwines with another reality until they both merge.

It is 1944 Spain, five years after the Civil War, ten year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going to meet her new stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez.) Vidal is a fascist pro-Franco officer. She is about to meet more than that as she encounters possible friends from another world. We also see how touchier and fantasy are juxtaposed. One of the major questions to answer is, is the magical creatures real and can only be seen because you have to have the right gaze or are they figments?

You will need to watch the movie several times to get the nuances and see the surrounding environments that you miss when concentrating on the dialog. See how the two world parallels in furniture. See out the two works hold similar tasks as both containing a key and a knife. In addition, there are always more surprises waiting.

The acting is superb especially Ofelia's death scene. Ivana Baquero Won, Imagen Award Best Actress, Premio ACE Best New Actress, Newcomer Award Female (Categor&iacute;a Femenina), Turia Award New Best Actress, and Nominated, Young Artist Award Best Performance in an International Feature Film - Leading Young Actor or Actress.

The Blu-ray version I watched had English subtitles as option but I found them to be a tad inaccurate and wanting of some of the background conversations. However, the director's voice over option helped point out the obvious that was not obvious until he pointed it out. As pointed out by the director, the violence was not for violence sake in the story and they did not have cowboy type breakable props.",1450656000,,2001,4.982035928143713

7624966,5,B002BYYA9A,"I am going to go ahead and put forth the theory that neither Alice nor Dorothy are real girls.

Instead they are disguised, temperamentally artistic or sensitive boys, at the very least they are boys of peculiar, feminine quality. Thus they are definitely of a certain qur aspect, (are the Oz and Alice fan predominantly male or female?) There certainly is something going on with Carroll, though with Baum, if anything at all, it is harder to pinpoint.

And while the movie adaptation of Wizard of Oz has long sustained male homosexual (Queen) appeal, I don't know if I can say the same of the novels: Do the Oz and Alice novels have particular homosexual appeal as well?

Frankly, I don't know.

In El Laberinto del Fauno, Ophelia, (whose name means 'help' but who is also the unfortunate fiancee of a doomed Shakespearean prince,)  the girl protagonist is clearly inspired by both Dorothy and Alice in their respective film and novel adaptations. Ophelia wears the deep, emerald green dress of book Dorothy, the lacy, white pinafore of Victorian Alice and the deep, blood red shoes of movie Dorothy.

Alice_par_John_Tenniel_[...]

[...]

Personally, Ive never met that many people who treasure these books as much as I do, but from what Ive seen, writers & artists (Bradbury, Heinlein, Miyazaki, Del Toro, Gaiman, etc.) who were clearly influenced by these stories are predominantly heterosexual.

And thus we come to El Laberinto del Fauno.

I think Del Toro comes well within this tradition of using a female (girl) heroine as a stand in for the sensitive boy. Based on my personal experience Id say that the males and male culture young Del Toro grew up with expected certain qualities from him that he was unable to respond back with, granting him an outsider or qur status.

Ophelia, the girl protagonist of Fauno, lives under the tutelage of a widowed mother (who becomes a soldiers wife apparently out of personal and motherly necessity.) The mother is willing to make certain sacrifices so long as she is allowed to provide for her daughter and herself. The relationship with the soldier is not the best possible thing for her (or her daughter) but it does allow for this.

Ophelia also is meant to become the ward and eventual daughter of a captain of the army; a brutal, (psychopathic,) efficient, patriarchal soldier who goes to any lengths to follow orders and who is also willing to sacrifice his new wife to keep his bloodline going, (a point is made that his father was an honorable soldier as well, and died in the battle field. Much is made of a watch that was broken to stop time at the point of his death. )

Women are invisible recipients for his seed or servants who take care of him and his offspring.

The story takes place at the end of the Spanish Civil war.  There are Communist stragglers (who believe we are all the same,) overrunning the country side, and the captains job is to exterminate them. He calls his wife to his side, regardless of health problems. The doctor indicates she should not have traveled, but the captain believes his son (how do you know its a boy?) should be born at his side.

Ophelia travels with her mother to the country, to live in danger of military fire. She is indicated to be a fantasy book lover. She offers the wrong hand to salute the captain upon meeting him, because she is carrying he beloved books with the correct hand and is not willing to switch. She is, however, willing to dump the books upon seeing a true fairy-like creature.

Therefore  her priorities lie like this: real world fantasy overrules literary fantasy overrules patriarchal male interests of the real world.

Her fantasy life develops alongside real life war atrocities, and it is very facile to interpret the girls fantasy life as an attempt at an escape from her cruel reality. You could just as easily claim that Narnia only exists for its young protagonists as an escape from bullying or war, whereas it actually surfaces as a mechanism for them to learn to cope with such strife. Even the ending moments of the movie feel much as if this is Del Toros Brazil movie. I think it would be to the detriment of the story's richness of detail to merely reduce it thus.

[...]

I am loath to try to simplify the story even at this point and would rather simply enjoy the movie as it develops. (Frankly, the first time I saw it I refused to write anything about it till I allowed the experience to sink in. I ended up not writing anything for a few years. This essay is the result of my second viewing.)

Ophelia meets the fairies (who are initially insect-like, but shape shift upon seeing a books silhouette illustrations) and a faun (who may be Pan, or not, but is indicated to be a natural force, infinitely old.) The faun sets up three tests for the girl. She must do these before the full moon (before her first period? Before she becomes fully an adult or woman?)  The faun is apparently a natural force, in contra-position of the patriarchal father, but more likely, the faun actually is the idealized father or pagan stand in for an idealized patriarchal god. Just as it is the Pale Man who is the ugly side of the faun: the Voracious Father figure.

The first two tests comprise of finding a key and a dagger, both obvious phallic symbols, pseudo-penises that the girl lacks. In the first test a toad is poisoning a tree (a standard fairy tale trope) and she must travel inside a slimy, vagina/uterine-like opening beneath the crotch of the tree to find the first item. A scene follows which seems inspired by Miyazakis Spirited Away, three magic seeds are fed to a gluttonous toad and it vomits up its own body.

rampaging_kaonashi.png

I don't know if it is worthwhile to make any more of it other than that.

In the second test she is to go to a Boogey Mans den (it clearly shows murals of a pictorial history of the eating children, Janus like, but it is also simply a bogey  which in Spanish is known as El Coco (The Devil/The Boogie Man). Del Toro apparently also owns that particular Michael Whelan fantasy art book.)

[...]

Here, Ophelia is to find a key (inside a box, more specifically in one of three boxes.) She is not to touch any of the food in the banquet laid-out table.

Again, as in the first test, she is to look inside her female spaces/parts and identify and find the penis within. The banquet (or treasure) where you are not supposed to touch reminds one of the story of Aladdin, thus again, a clearly identified fairy tale standard. (The fantastic food guarding monster is also mirrored in the 'real' world as the Captain is in charge of the government rationed food for the country people.)

The test is complicated because she is told to follow three fairies, who point out the wrong box. Somehow she manages to figure out the correct one despite this, but this is not the end: She picks and eats some of the grapes on the table, The Pale Man awakes and catches and eats two of the fairies. Is there a meaning to the eaten fairies, or are they simply reflections of the real world?

Did the girl 'punish' the fairies for giving her the wrong information? Its hard to read exactly why the fairy  points out the wrong answer or how the girl figures the right one, other than instantaneous intuition. (In the real world food is also stolen from the Captain, facilitated by use of a key, which results in the death of a couple of people, one by torture, i.e. a means of extracting information which is not always reliable, just as two fairies, one of whom gives wrong information, are killed in this scene.)

The puzzle with the three doors is also reminiscent of the one in Labyrinth where, I might point out, I do not think it works very well.

[...]

Ophelia is determined by the faun to have failed this test, since she did eat of the table. But she does manage to escape the awakened Pale Man and is allowed one more opportunity to be tested.

The faun also helps out in the complicated pregnancy. He gives the girl a baby-like mandrake root which she is to place in a bowl of milk under the mothers bed and feed two drops of her own blood every day. The mandrake has long been associated with sexuality, fertility, male/femaleness and other aspects of magic.

[...]

But, anyway, the mandrake magic works and the mother improves.

There are two leading Biblical instances of a test in which a person is asked to sacrifice a son or child. In Abrahams story God asks him to sacrifice his son. In Solomons story he (Solomon) indicates he is willing to cut a baby in half and give each alleged mother one portion of the dead baby to satisfy their demands.

Abraham passes the test by being willing to go ahead with Gods will and personally killing his son. The true mother at Solomons trial passes her test by refusing  to have the baby killed, and instead willing to make a personal sacrifice and thereby losing the baby to the other woman, so long as it is not killed.

[...]
[...]

These examples are illustrative of the Judeo-Christian views of male and female roles. Men assure their patriarchy by being good soldiers who will obey any order (even killing their own!)  Women are meant to be nurturing mothers who are willing to sacrifice anything (even loss of their own children) for the actual good of the children (or the future of the patriarchal tribe.)

Any deviation from these two definitions would indicate queerness again, but not necessarily denoting overt homosexuality in my opinion.

The very last test is the determining one. The girl has found her (key and her) dagger; is she now willing to use it to puncture another being (her half-brother) without questioning the order? Is she to become a Man or is she to become a woman (by time  or the full moon - simply running out on her and allowing nature - or her menses  to take its course? By default?)

[...]
Ophelia steals the baby from the father, takes it to the sacrificial altar, but ultimately refuses to puncture her baby brother with the substitute phallus. Does she pass the test? Does she not pass it? She clearly does not become a Man, since she does not obey her orders (she is unable to be a good soldier.) So then, is she then a Woman (by passing Solomons Trial)? Or, is she neither, instead becoming some qur thing in the process?

The movie ends with her being shot by the captain. Her blood, instead of her brothers, stains the altar. The sacrifice is completed, but with her own blood instead of someone elses.

While she seemingly dies, she has a fantasy dream in which she has escaped her worldly bounds and where she reaches her fantasy Universe. The last test is apparently passed.

But Del Toro does not allow us this. We are back in Civil War Spain, and she is shown dead on the sacrificial ground. Hers is just the moribund hallucination of a blood and oxygen starved brain. This is reality, not fantasy. She really does die.

In Fulci's House By the Cemetery a similar situation is presented: In a last minute, deathly peril (with an eyeless monster and situation very much like the escape from the Pale Man in Faun) a boy escapes via ghostly intercession and goes to a fantastic limbo/netherworld. I believe the boy in that particular story is allowed to survive death.

[...]

Are we allowed to think Ophelia survives death? I think not. For a  fantasist such as Del Toro this is surprising: This is Brazil (or, as someone else has said, An Incident at Owl's Creek.).  Sam Lowrys triumph is never really that. Im not saying that either Sam or Ophelia ever actually had much of an option, though. Reality catches up with them.

[...]

Ultimately, I don't think I have cracked the code.

I still don't think I see the whole picture, but I think I understand enough to see what the story is about. The basic problem is Ophelias death: It is not allowed to become an escape.

This is Fantasy with both feet on the ground.  it is certainly more reminiscent of The Talisman (with its adult themes) than of the traditional Oz and Wonderland childrens fairy tales. But even then, The Talisman remains wish fulfilling in ways that Fauno is not.

Ophelia does survive via her half-brother (like RAH's Podkaine of Mars - in Spanish known as Hija de Marte [Daughter of Mars],) but will he be worthy? He certainly has the potential, especially since the martial father is dead: his name, memory and his broken watch, forgotten.

[...]

Someone else, their surrogate mother and father, (a couple who, maybe significantly, are brother and sister and who by any rights should have been dead; both of them,) will raise the baby, maybe allowing for that promise that Ophelia made to him while in the womb.

Ophelias story is inherited by someone else. Either that, or Faun was never really Ophelias story: it is her brothers.

The artist can only do so much via fantasy, it is up to someone else, (a baby brother, idealist servants, soldiers, doctors, movers and shakers,) to take over and actually change the world.",1446422400,,12966,4.598090277777778

It starts off with a young girl, Opheila, moving into the countryside with her mother who is sick and pregnant with her brother. They go to live with a general in the Spanish dictator's army. He is an enforcer that finds rebels in the surrounding countryside and tortures and kills them. Ophelia, in an attempt to get away from the horror that is her life, finds a faun/fairy named Pan and he takes her into his labyrinth, telling her that she should be a princess. I do not want to spoil the movie by giving away too much of the plot line, but I can guarantee that if you watch it you will not be disappointed.",1445644800,,860,4.276073619631902

7625001,5,B002BYYA9A,"I was spellbound by this highly original movie and have watched it several times. Pan's Labyrinth weaves a challenging quest story set in the brutal regime of the Spanish Civil war. Heroine, Ofelia a neglected child with links to the daemonic world is set a number of dangerous and daunting tasks to complete. The story shifts from the real horrors of the civil war to the daemonic horror that Ofelia faces as she's presented with three equalling gruelling and life threatening task. On each of these she confronts the terrifying and ambivalent presence of del Toro's depiction of Pan. He is larger than life and both her supporter and tormentor. Despite the trials she faces in the fantastical world she slips into alone, this world by comparison becomes more benign than the real one she lives in. She is witness to cruelty and killing at the hands of her Fascist step-father and his ruthless henchmen. As her mother become frail, powerless and removed this diminutive heroine, she is left to navigate the nightmarish realm of the real world almost alone. Ultimately good triumphs over evil, but at a terrible cost. Despite the ineptness of the adults in Ofelia's world, an unlikely female peasant also triumphs as a heroine under the gruesome Fascist regime. The climax of the story is brutal and horrific, so much so that the audience in the cinema gasped in horror. Throughout the film the nightmarish fantasy elements mirror the evils of the real world. In the same manner the Crimson Peak trailers promise to deliver a masterpiece in the same realm of this haunting gothic horror fantasy.",1443225600,,1595,4.88929889298893

7625042,5,B002BYYA9A,"This movie is ultimately a fable about innocence, good and evil. Young Ofelia's efforts to confront evil while retaining her innocence mirror the efforts of the political revolutionaries to combat political evil in their opponents while retaining a sense of moral superiority. Del Toro's point--for Ofelia and for all political revolutionaries--is that it's not your political views or your imagination that makes you superior. It's your capacity for self-sacrifice and your ability to sacrifice yourself for a cause. Freely choosing good over evil, even when you know to do so will result in your death or detriment, is ultimately what makes us human and gives human life meaning. At least that's what I take to be del Toro's general drift.

In the character Ofelia, del Toro gives us imagination a-plenty. It's her inner life that gives this movie so much of its great visual and artistic beauty. The meaning should be clear, however, that Ofelia's prodigious imagination is not enough to protect her or her loved ones. Her previous 2 failures with the giant toad and eyeless monster--both of which seem like imaginative transformations of Ofelia's despicable step-father--have taught her that self-sacrifice and action in the real world, rather than retreat into the realm of imagination, is what her situation demands. She rescues her infant step-brother at the risk of her own life and dies in doing so. But because her actions are so much braver and selfless than those of the so-called adults around her, del Toro wants us to hope that her example might influence and reform their actions going forward. You might say Ofelia is a cross between Shakespeare's Ophelia and Jesus Christ.

This DVD version looks very good in widescreen format. Most of the CGI effects are convincing and aesthetically pleasing to watch, despite their age. All of del Toro's trademark images are here--insects, flowers, monsters, and gadgets--and they all look great.",1439078400,,1952,5.174050632911392

This movies is a fairy tale, and a it shows how fairy tales would look like in real life, with weird looking fairies, creepy labyrinths and a nightmare inducing faun.

7625135,5,B002BYYA9A,"Guillermo Del Toro is one of the best directors of our time. The story is so imaginative, similar to a child's fairy tale but with a twist. You get to witness the time in which Ofelia lived, with her mother marrying someone who could provide for her because that was what she had to do. The new stepfather is a man of the army, and truly heartless. It flashes between worlds; the world she lived in that was gritty and harsh, and the world she escaped to of fantasy, which was not always hearts and butterflies. It is a great tale, so if you're someone who doesn't mind subtitles, and you shouldn't, then watch this.",1428796800,,616,4.3652173913043475

This is like nothing else I've read or seen before. It is different to Lord Of The Rings or Hobbit, which there was a possibility of him directing. They would have been a lot better with his creativity, even though they are great films in their own rights.

However, this gave it a more intriguing aspect to the movie. I watch a lot of subtitled shows/ movies so it did not bother me. The use of color and art in this movie was just amazing and would not expect any less of a del Toro movie. I do not recommend this movie for young children as there is a fair amount of war action gore and some parts youngster may find scary.

I don't want to give away anything about the movie, but this movie is like an emotional roller coaster of fantasy. It's  a Spanish language film but anyone can easily understand what's going on even without the subtitles. Highly recommended!

On a side note, I see a few reviews of people complaining that they bought it for kids and it's not appropriate. Well, of course it's not! It's full of gore, violence and bad language. Here in the USA, it states on the back of the case that it's not for kids. Not to mention if you simply Google the summary, it's set in fascist Spain with a hardcore fascist villain set in 1944. Neither the movie or story is appropriate for kids.",1421193600,,820,4.609589041095891

I have been in love with it since, have played it for many friends, and dates lol, I used to own the dvd but now we live in a digital age. I rented it for a friend of mine who had not seen it yet and he was blown away as well.
The storytelling is great it feels like an old school movie that gets you to follow the story rather than stare at the screen. The best way I can describe it is it is a dark fairytale, one that you decide whether is real or not at the end. It is imaginative, unique, and great entertainment. It is all in spanish so if you don't understand it you will have to read subtitles like myself but it does't take anything away from this movie at all!",1421107200,,831,3.9523809523809526

7625216,4,B002BYYA9A,I don't need the original language to enjoy movies.  Not sure why that is popular and would have loved if I could have looked up to see the beautiful world that was created in this movie.  I know some movie buffs will not like that sentiment but I wish this had an english dubbed version so I could enjoy it with my father who is incapable of reading fast enough to follow along.  We had to pause/rewind the movie over 50 times.  Would be 5 out of 5 if we could enjoy it the way we like.  BTW between my father and I we speak 7 different languages and unfortunately spanish is not one of them sadly.  We recognize the value of the original language in movies but only when you yourself can actually speak the language.,1420329600,3,718,4.204379562043796

I saw this a long time ago and had forgotten about it until I saw a Tool video on YouTube that someone had made using a clip from this movie (the clip was set to 46 and 2 and was the creature with eyes in his palms).  That prompted me to go looking for the video again and now I own it!  There's a good story, really good acting, especially by the young girl and great special effects with the creatures.

Pan's Labyrinth is no exception and is a great movie!  Don't miss out on this artistic masterpiece.  I've watched this movie approximately a dozen times.  You must watch on high definition.

I bought it on DVD as soon as it was released and now have purchased the digital copy as well. There are a couple slow scenes but the movie flows well.

Incidentally .... contrary to what I recall some reviewers saying, it is clear from near the beginning that the magical elements are not fantasy, but ""real"" (within the world of the movie).  ""Fantastic"" events occur that are not experienced by any of the characters - we the viewers alone know about them - experiencing them as part of the reality being presented by the film maker.",1416960000,,561,4.791666666666667

7625320,4,B002BYYA9A,"Story is very interesting, fantastic, and brutal at the same time.  Three different stories (I felt).
First is the brutal war, with all it's harshness.  Second, is the struggle of the mother to provide
a better world for her daughter through all the hardships.  Lastly, is the daughter's infatuation
with books and fantasy - probably because she is just a little girl who loves that stuff,
 and to escape the horrors of the real world she is exposed to.
Now, it does have English subtitles (it's all in Spanish), but that was not a problem once the
movie started.  Do not let this sway you.",1411430400,2,590,4.580952380952381

7625336,5,B002BYYA9A,"Do you love fantasy stories? Muppets? Musicals? David Bowie? Then you will love this movie!

No, wait, hold on, that's Labyrinth. This is Pan's Labyrinth. It's like Labyrinth except it's in Spanish. Also, it's set in the Spanish Civil War. And people get their legs chopped off, hands mangled and faces bashed. And there's significant fairy death. You know, now that i think about it, this movie is nothing like Labyrinth.

Even so, this movie is awesome. It's got fairies, princesses, magic stones and even magicier chalk (that's a word, right?). The plot: A young girl leads an awful life. She moves to the countryside to be with the cruel military commander that has just married her mom. In the countryside she discovers a labyrinth and mystic ruins while a fawn, an emissary from the underworld, finds her and informs her that she is the reincarnation of the daughter of the king of the underworld, who has been looking for her for generations. To get back to her real family she must complete three tasks. In the meantime, the military and rebels fight their war.

This movie is beautiful. It's also dark and depressing. Soldiers die, rebels die, everybody dies! Well, not everybody, but don't get too attached to anyone. Can Ophelia make it out before the war takes her?

i love Labyrinth and similar happy fantasy movies but i also love this movie. i haven't met anyone who doesn't, although i've only asked my friends and my teenage daughters. No idea if my grandmom or little kids would like it.",1408924800,2,1505,4.754789272030651

Original! Dark Fairy Tale and full of fantasy. It's really an amazing movie. I heard the director said that the making of the movie almost killed him. A masterpiece if there ever was one. I own this movie. If you like fantasy and Dark Fairy Tales, you will love this movie.

It has some very violent scenes, but it's not violence for shock value or action. It's what violence up-close looks like.

It's such an awesome story and, maybe it helps us understand the value of fantasy, especially for kids, after watching this movie.

The first film was No Country For Old Men, and after that film I just wanted to go home because I thought there was no way this film would surpass and I kind of wanted to hold onto that melancholy depression you're left feeling after NCfOM. From the opening shot of this film, you know you're about to view something incredible, something special and fantastical, and needless to say, this film was the perfect counter point for NCfOM, while that film was smaller, more contained, quiet and moody, this film sweeps you away and steals your mind, to the point that you wish yourself you could go visit this world, no matter how terrible it is portrayed. This has remained one of my favorite films since the first time I saw it, then bought the DVD when it was released and now finally upgrading my copy to blu ray.

I have seen this movie a dozen times; even so, the movie evokes my emotions every time I watch it.
I've watched the movie in the English subtitles and without ( I understand the language). I consider myself extremely fortunate to have been able to do so. Being able to see the movie without having to read the subtitles puts the film on a different level because there are words that when translated, changes certain thoughts or the flow of a conversation (in my opinion). I mean this problem will always occur when subtitles are involved, but knowing the language makes the film abundantly more magical in many ways.

*I don't want to give a lot away, so I'll just summarize some major parts. (not all)
In the movie, Ofelia, who is the young girl shown on the cover, is forced to face reality when her mother remarries and they have to live in the country side where the step father is a captain in charger of fighting off the group of Resistance. There, she encounters a faun who tells her she is the reincarnation of a princess from another world/realm. He offers her a chance to complete three tasks and in return she will be allowed to go back to her kingdom.

It's a great story and while it has some amazing special effects it is not at all dominating the production.

My 16 year-old son, who usually enjoys big-budget sci-fi films, said this was probably his favorite movie ever.  It definitely deserves its ""R"" rating, mostly for violence.  If you are squeamish at all, it may not be for you.

I would be interested in seeing movies similar to Pan's Labyrinth.",1398729600,,575,4.767676767676767
7625410,5,B002BYYA9A,"""Pan's Labyrinth"", by now most people are aware of this film and have developed their own judgement as to whether or not they find it enjoyable.  However, the general consensus is that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is not just a remarkable film that is engaging and entertaining, but it is also a tale of sadness and hope, a tale that will captivate and move viewers as the story progresses.

The film follows the life of a young girl named Ofelia.  Ofelia's mother is pregnant with the son of one of the captains of the Spanish armed forces during the World War II era.  The time period alone is enough to make the life of a small child such as Ofelia difficult, however, Ofelia's life is much more complicated than that.  Her step-father, Captain Vidal, is a power hungry man who lacks basic emotions such as sympathy and empathy.  The man makes the lives of everyone around him much more difficult and his actions displayed throughout the film depict a cruel and irrational man.

Ofelia's mother and her live-in housekeper, Mercedes, are the only two people whom Ofelia feels comfortable around.  However, with her mother's health getting worse as a result of her pregnancy, Ofelia is left to deal with a lot of the struggles she's facing on her own.....that is until she discovers the labyrinth.

After following a fairy guide to the center of the labyrinth, Ofelia discovers a faun who explains to her that she comes from a royal bloodline and is actually a princess.  He explains to her that in order to gain her birthrights to her kingdom she must complete a series of tasks.  The faun continues to give Ofelia tasks and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" dives deeper into the new world that Ofelia has discovered, a world where she feels happy and safe, a world where she can forget about her real-world problems that she must face every day.

The film uses great artwork and design to mix and blend the worlds of fantasy and reality perfectly.  The characters are well designed, the world is believable in an unbelievable way, meaning that despite the fiction behind the fantasy world it is still believable to the viewers and it does an excellent job of drawing them in, as if the viewer is Ofelia experiencing it first-hand.  Overall, the film tells an engaging story that is bound to keep the viewers' attention, and it does so with great cinematography and special effects that add to the storyline perfectly.",1398643200,,2394,4.7235576923076925

I haven't seen a real fairy tale in a long time, and believe me, this movie far surpasses the fairy tales that i'm used to. It was dark, a little violent when it needed to be, and ornate.

I personally love Del Toro; he is such a great movie maker. His imagination is truly awe-inspiring and this movie really captures the masterful approach to visualization and story telling that he is capable of.

Now this movie was kind of hard to watch as it was all in subtitles; this isn't a problem, but it was a bit distracting to have to read everything that the actors/actresses where saying, but in this, it gave the movie character.

Other than the distracting subtitles, this movie is virtually seamless. So what's The Bottom Line, well i've gotta say it has to be an

Each time, afterwards, I began to understand more.
It is a wonderfully creative and inventive film.
Worth reading a bit about the story line ahead of time, since if you're English speaking you'll be reading subtitles, and the story seems complicated.  However, it isn't all that complicated, IF you are a bit prepared by a preliminary story-line read ahead of time.
After the 2nd or 3rd viewing, I began to understand and see quite a bit of (what now seems obvious) symbolism, making connections between occurrences in the film (in the fantasy) that provide parallels between the story and great, classic tales and of Christian traditions, or simply suggestive of universal tales of human survival that are found across cultures.
If you like mystery, if you like children and their dreams, if you can accept realities of tragedies behind life's continuum, but believe in hope eternal, and if you can tolerate some painful scenes, this film is for you!

I am aware of the injustice of Franco's fascist regime, and  his ties with Hitler, but this was a vivd portrayal of how far people will go to protect their power and superiority. Really, kudos to  Director:/ Writer  Guillermo del Toro for his bold and courageous story, and to  Ivana Baquero for an amazing performance  portraying a young brave Ofelia. This is a gripping film, and although it is in Spanish with  English subtitles you never miss a beat, it gets your attention and holds onto you the entire film! In fact the native language only helps the drama. This is poignant, heartbreaking, inspiring and eye opening!

Del Toro fuses action, politics & fantasy in a multi-layered movie that succeeds on every level. This may not be the movie you are expecting: it IS a ""fairy-tale"", but not a Disney fairy-tale. There are passages of brutal & cruel violence - most definitely not a film for children or the squeamish.

7625479,5,B002BYYA9A,"THE STORY: Spain, during World War II. Ofelia, a young girl who feels disconnected from life frequently escapes the daily boredom of her life and the terrors of the war by losing herself in the world of fantasy books & stories.  She soon comes to realize that fantasy & reality may in fact be one and the same.  Ofelia & her mother have come to live in a small villa deep in the woods in order to be with her mother's new husband, an officer in the Spanish army. She is mostly ignored by her sickly mother, who softly scolds the girl for stubbornly clinging to her childish ""fairy tales."" Ofelia's only friend is a female caregiver working in the mountain villa. Ofelia is loathed by her step father, a brutal, sadistic man who delights in torturing his prisoners. To him, Ofelia is nothing more than unwanted baggage from his wife's previous marriage, another mouth to feed and, more importantly to him, direct competition for he & his bride's newborn son. One afternoon while out exploring, Ofelia stumbles upon the entrance to an underground labyrinth hidden in the nearby woods. This dark, subterranean world is lorded over by a strong-willed faun, (""Pan""), who informs Ofelia that she has a great destiny ahead of her - IF she can successfully perform three simple tasks.

THOUGHTS: This is a great little Aesop's Fable-type movie. I won't spoil it by going further, but suffice it to say that I think that this is a really terrific movie, with plenty of heart to go along with the enchanting (and often haunting) visuals. The faun is a delight to behold; totally convincing as a character thanks to some fantastic make up, a touch of CGI, and a truly amazing physical performance by the incredible Doug Jones. Hey, Academy Awards people! Someone give this man an Oscar quick!  Pan is at once forward, charming, mysterious, devious and at times frightfully ferocious. You never quite know what his game is, if he's a force for good or evil, and whether he can be trusted or not. Just a great, great movie. Some have complained that it is too slowly paced, but I think that's part of it's charm. Del Toro slowly lures you into the world he's trying to create, rather than jumping right in and throwing all of the best stuff in your face within the first few minutes. You have to be patient. If you do, you will be rewarded!

THE BLU-RAY: The hi-def presentation of this film looks gorgeous. Colors pop, scenes are sharply focused and the sound fills the room. Unfortunately for non-Spanish speaking viewers this movie is only available with English subtitles. No English dub track was created for it. I cannot fathom why the distributor (and Del Toro) didn't oversee the creation of a quality English language dub for the film. Still, it isn't too complicated to follow from a visual standpoint and the film isn't too dialogue-heavy, making the subtitles pretty easy to follow. My wife has a hard time with subtitles but was so enchanted by the film that she watched it several times; once in the original Spanish language and then a couple more times with the English subtitles on. She loved it and highly recommended it to her family & friends. I do too, but want to again stress that if you hate subtitles you may not enjoy it quite as much. But for everyone else, this a great little film that has a high replay value. Another wonderful film from Guillermo Del Toro. 5 STARS",1390003200,5,3382,4.639398998330551

7625505,5,B002BYYA9A,"This is a movie with a simple and straightforward plot which contains layers and layers of intelligent writing, metaphors and message.

To speak further about the script will end up in spoilers and that would be pointless since my very purpose writing this review is to encourage people to see it.

This is no small feat, interpreting fantasy as something of a product of a real world, cross-referencing how the child acts to her real surroundings and the ""other world"", metaphors that describe the accelerated state of growing up some of us are put through... Incredible. Simple, straightforward yet there is so much to be appreciated.

Those who are saying how it's predictable and thus not enjoyable, I ask of you, which movie nowadays aren't predictable? Hell, even 21 grams was predictable but so damned good. It's not about how it ends, you can always predict how a movie would end if you've ever taken a half-decent script writing class or have some common sense. It's always about how well you tell a story.

I'm grateful there are still directors who aren't tied down to this new epidemic of including a plot twist simply because they need a plot twist.

Pan's Labyrinth features some of the best storytelling and attention to detail without being affected by the now ever-popular opinion of cameras having to be put through several technical difficulties to make the shots eligible to be called a brilliant shot.

I am also grateful for them not dubbing it. Watching it in its' original language is much, much more rewarding even if I had to rely on the subtitles for most of the time.

The ending can be interpreted in a couple different ways, but I think it's kind of like seeing the glass half-full or half-empty, so watch with an open mind.  There are fairies and magic, etc, but make no mistake though, this takes place during wartime, and it has some extreme violence and some gore, so it's not a kid's movie!

I'd also like to make special note of the costuming work done on the Faun: amazing!",1385683200,,509,4.3936170212765955

I rented this movie and it was streamed to all my devices like my Xbox my tv my cellphone so if I decided to watch my movie somewhere else I could and that was a really good thing ! I really like this movie because it is about a girl from Spain who has to move in with her pregnant mother to her step fathers home. He is a soldier or sargent I think and he is very evil. It is a violent movie but its good. The way this movie is filmed is just breath taking you get really into the movie that you feel like you are in it.

7625527,5,B002BYYA9A,"It's as uncommon a ""foreign"" film as you're likely to see embraced by critics and mainstream audiences alike. A grim, desolate Spain where hope lies in the imagination of a little girl and the unflinching bravery of a small group of rebels. Though the two never meet in person, their intertwining storylines lead the viewer on an unforgettable journey. The actor who portrays the villain, Captain Vidal, is absolutely riveting... and easy to loathe. A colleague of mine used it in a film as lit. unit when it first came out and I have since stolen it to use in my own English classes. A word of caution: it is in Spanish with English subtitles.

7625529,4,B002BYYA9A,The movie was really good and I thought that the dark fairytale aspect of it was very interesting and easy to watch.

7625537,5,B002BYYA9A,This is an enthralling movie. I loved the way it seamlessly switched back and forth from fantasy to reality. Set in Spain during their 1940's civil war this movie is a masterpiece. This is no children's film. It is both graphic and suspenseful with great characters that are well developed. Directed by Guillermo del Toro this English subtitled film will blow you away.,1383523200,,369,4.873015873015873

Del Toro uses the fantastical elements of a girl's journey into a fantastical realm to highlight the impact of the civil war on those who survived it. Packed with meaning, like The Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth becomes a universal story of interpreting grief, as well as a specific story of a country trying to figure out what life will be going forward.",1383436800,,453,4.536585365853658

7625543,4,B002BYYA9A,"I give 4 stars based on the acting.  The movie was, in my opinion, weird, but did have one brief moment of humor when the girl ate from the table.  The violence was justified for those times.",1382572800,,191,4.135135135135135

The cinematography and effects are gorgeous, the plot's compelling, the characters are strong, the iconography of the fantasy segments is universal in appeal, and the messages are almost limitless depending on the imagination and attention of the audience. If Guillermo Del Toro had no other good films under his belt, I'd still hold him as one of my favorite film-makers for this alone. 10/10 flick that gets better every time I watch it.",1380844800,,643,5.0754716981132075

7625553,5,B002BYYA9A,"This is one of those movies that just ""sticks"" with you. The imagery is so unique and powerful, I just can't seem to forget it (not that I want to). At random moments, I will think of scenes from this movie, seemingly out of the blue, and be prompted to reflect upon Del Toro's unique masterpiece. Another interesting thing about this movie is the foreign language aspect and the subtitles. The acting is marvelously realized, but the foreign language part adds a bizarre sort of realism that I can't describe- realism, despite the fact that this movie is filled with fantastic, extraordinary monsters and imaginary beings. It's just a weird, indescribable side effect, I guess, but well worth mentioning- I can't think of any other movie where I've observed this phenomenon. The monsters and creature effects are reminiscent of the awesome Hellboy installments, and they are simultaneously bone-chilling and awe-inspiring (this movie will give your kids nightmares- DON'T let them watch this, it's and adult movie!). The story line itself is heartfelt and executed with the utmost passion... these actors went to the wall for their director, and the results are indisputable. This is a rare piece of cinematography, to be sure, and one that deserves multiple viewings. Highly recommended- five stars, and not an ounce less!",1379721600,,1324,5.105990783410138

7625557,5,B002BYYA9A,"I bought this movie because I have seen it before and wanted it in my permanant library. This is not a film for the faint of heart. It is quite graphic about the civil war during Franco's take-over in Spain. It is mixed with a fanciful legend of a 12 year girl. It is in Spanish, of course, with Spanish actors and actresses, subtitled and I thought the acting as well as the story was excellent. The special effects are not up to our standards, but I think this movie is great. I know it was nominated and won an Oscar for best foreign film, though I don't remember which year. Don't make the same mistake I did the first time I watched this. It is definitely not a movie for kids. I would not recommend this for anyone under the age of 16 and a mature 16 at that.",1379116800,,765,4.1066666666666665

7625562,5,B002BYYA9A,"Before I get into my thoughts on the film, I should clarify what I mean by the review title for the people unfamiliar with ""Spirited Away."" Released in Japan as  (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, ""Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away""), ""Spirited Away"" is an animated film by Hayao Miyazaki that details a young girl's accidental journey into the spirit world, a world of secrets unseen by most that is inhabited by a plethora of fantastical beings, some relatively harmless, others deadly. ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" in part, details a young girl's accidental journey into the underworld, which is also unseen by most people and also inhabited by fantastical beings. The difference here is that while Chihiro, the main character in ""Spirited Away,"" wishes to escape the spirit world and return to ""our"" world, Ofelia, the main character in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" wishes to escape ""our"" world, for she lives in post-civil war Spain, where her stepfather, a ruthless captain, is fighting a group of guerrillas. Ofelia and her mother are both with him because Ofelia's mother is pregnant with the captain's child, and the captain wishes for the child to be born near him.

Ofelia takes an immediate disliking to the captain, who her mother wants her to address as ""Father."" Rather than become accustomed to her new home, she decides to explore the grounds, carrying one of several books of fairy tales she brought with her (her mother thinks she is too old for fairy tales), and discovers a large labyrinth, which Mercedes, a cook whom Ofelia befriends, says is old with an unknown purpose. Some time later, a mysterious insect Ofelia calls a ""fairy"" leads her through the labyrinth to a spiral staircase which descends into the ground. At the bottom is an altar...and a faun, who emerges from the shadows and changes Ofelia's perception of the world and her place in it forever. To reclaim that place, the faun says, she must complete three tasks before the full moon lights the night sky, tasks which test her courage, her determination, and her will to live.

Unlike ""Spirited Away,"" ""Pan's Labyrinth"" balances the two worlds it features, so while viewers may prefer one over the other, and while one is seen more than the other, neither is more important than the other. Both have issues which must be addressed by the characters and provide insight into each character's behavior and personality, which in turn helps the viewer identify with them (or distance himself or herself from them), and brilliant use of CGI and animatronics helps make the creatures of the underworld seem as real as the film's human beings. With them, del Toro, and by extension, Ofelia, is able to explore the ideas of doing what one is told versus doing what one believes is right, innocence and its place in the world, and whether what we perceive as reality is, in fact, reality.

This is a film I thoroughly enjoyed and will definitely watch again, and I recommend it to anyone who's intrigued by the idea of  ""a fairy tale for adults,"" to anyone with an open mind, and/or to anyone who has the slightest urge to find out what all the fuss with this film is about.",1378684800,2,3130,4.810408921933085

7625592,1,B002BYYA9A,"The movie itself is absolutely wonderful.  Amazon, however, is not.  I rented this movie in HD.  The warning came up that it might not play on all technologies.  I didn't do much research because I assumed PC/internet would be the first and foremost form in which I could watch HD movies.  There was no specific warning about how Amazon doesn't allow ANY PC PLAY OF HD MOVIES AT ALL.  Just that you can watch them on Kindle Fire, XBOX, PS, etc.  Why in the Earth would they not allow PC streaming of HD??  This movie NEEDS to be watched in HD--no SD for this movie.  I eventually got to watch it in HD from a different internet source.  I really wish I could get the money back I paid Amazon, but I have not found a way to get the money back yet.

If Amazon is not going to allow HD streaming on PC via the internet, which should be the first way they should have made HD available, then they definitely should have included that in the little synopsis warning--as the first sentence.  Shame on Amazon.  They aren't going to compete very well with Netflix if they can't even stream HD onto PC.  Never renting from them again.",1375142400,3,1125,4.320574162679426

7625597,5,B002BYYA9A,"My daughter brought home this out-of-the-blue, incredible flick suggestion, from her advanced Spanish-Language class (in NYS public high school).  We watched it once on a pay-per-movie live-stream, & bought it immediately so that we could re-watch it life-long.  It's that good & better.

No Disney-fied, sanitized, pre-surveyed for maximum mass appeal & zero offense to anyone... No comically perfected, hourglass figurine & voice of an angel, saved by the broad-shouldered, slender waisted, boyishly- handsome, princely- happy ending here.

Instead, this is a REAL story.  Wondrous things happen- and we're not sure what they are, or what they mean.  Sad things, beautiful things, horrific things, and- IMAGINATION reigns supreme, in the story-telling of old style (from before any of us were born).  This is a story to watch over & over & over... You will know ""what it all means"" in the end, but each time you watch it, you will discover new meaning(s).  Well-deserved accolades for this transformative journey deep into where imagination rules, & offensive things happen, (or are vaguely hinted at, or the threat of potential offense lies somewhere in between implied & actual occurance)- unrestrained by mass-commercial influence.

What a priviledge- To be transported into a REAL story, loaded with substantive meaning, morals & lack thereof, respect for human life & lack thereof, kindness, generosity of spirit, forgiveness... And lack thereof- A glaringly harsh, difficult to embrace at times, true work of art, open to endless interpretations.  Wer you raised on Disney?  (I was.)  Fix it.

Solid ensemble acting overall, with occasional moments of individual brilliance, some dazzling special effects, great period and fantasy costuming, excellent lighting and camera work, especially during the maze sequence and during the terrifying 'challenges', where camera dolly speed and quick-cutting edits are employed. This movie might well be sub-titled ""Malice In Wonderland"" for showing the darker side of life above and below ground in a magical way.

7625612,5,B002BYYA9A,"Guillermo del Toro has become one of cinema's true film magicians throughout his career, which started with a steampunk-sprinkled vampire yarn titled Cronos, and has seen films made about ghost stories, super heroes, and giant freaking cockroaches. It is with Pan's Labyrinth, however, that del Toro makes his name known to all. Simply put, this film is perfection, and a true dark fairy tale. It is a film that represents the innocence of a young child, a theme del Toro visited earlier in his 2001 ghost story The Devil's Backbone&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Backbone-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00CEIOH3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Backbone (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>]. This film is at times ultra-violent and appealing to the child in even the most cynical adult, yet also one of the most visually stimulating films ever made. It's basically Guillermo del Toro's mind poured out into a film canister.

I own the single-disc DVD version of the film, which contains a video prologue by the director as well as del Toro's feature-length audio commentary. It's in the original aspect ratio (1.85.1) and a very good and easy to understand English subtitle translation of the Spanish-language film. The picture is clear and crisp and really shows off the film's visual nature.

7625739,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth (El laberinto del fauno) finds Guillermo del Toro coming into some of his biggest commercial success immediately following his big screen adaptation of Mike Mignola's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellboy/dp/B000OT6V00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellboy</a>.  While Pany's Labyrinth retains much of the surreal fantasy elements that we've seen in Hellboy, fans of the giant red devil may be put off by a marked lack of humor.  If you are not a fan of ""foreign"" films, you not be interested in spending almost an hour and a half reading the dialog.  For everyone else, Pan's Labyrinth is dark, violent, and a fantastic work of art.

For those of you who are familiar with del Torro's Chronos,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cronos/dp/B0043VUHUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cronos</a>, you will probably find somewhat familiar territory in Pan's Labyrinth.  In previous works like Chronos, del Torro has demonstrated a flair for the dramatic, an eye for aesthetic beauty, and a love for the elements of classic horror.  In Pan's Labyrinth we see all of these filtered through a story that is inspired by fairy tales and fantasy.

Pan's Labyrinth tells the story of Ofelia, the stepdaughter of the brutal Captain Vidal.  Ofelia's mother grows increasingly ill while pregnant with her younger brother.  Starting with Pan, a faun, Ofelia meets a series of fantastic creatures and attempts to pass a series of tests to demonstrate that she is actually the reincarnated spirit of the underworld Princess Moanna.

Elements of fantasy interact both directly and indirectly with a dark and gritty reality.  The backdrop of the film is set in post-Civil War Spain around 1944, and young Ofelia is not spared from seeing the horrors and atrocities that war brings.  The elements of dark realism set a particularly violent tone for the entire movie.  If you are not familiar with Spanish history I wouldn't worry.  The setting creates a particular atmosphere for the movie without penalizing the viewer for being unfamiliar with the specifics.

Those who follow del Torro's work know that he loves to reuse talented actors (Ron Perlman, anyone?).  Doug Jones stars in Pan's Labyrinth as the titular faun between his roles as Abe Sapien in Hellboy and the 2008 sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellboy-II-The-Golden-Army/dp/B001F7MSG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellboy II: The Golden Army</a>.  I try not to do too much study prior to seeing a movie, but having loved Jones' body work since his role as the lead Gentleman in the episode ""Hush"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer/dp/B0046XG48O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>&nbsp;I could instantly identify him as both Pan and the ""Pale Man.""  Not surprisingly, you won't get to hear Jones' voice, but his talents for acrobatics and contortion are uniquely suited for the role.  In addition, Jones (who admittedly knows no Spanish), took the time to learn all of the lines for the film making his mouth and movements match perfectly when dubbed by a voice-over actor.

Jones' costume is a beautiful and different take on the notion of a faun.  Pan is half man, half goat, and his form is inspired by the exterior of a tree.  In the dark setting of the movie he blends into his surroundings as a creature of the nighttime woods.  Pan's Labyrinth is ideally suited to fans of dark fantasy pictures.  By sticking so closely to what Guillermo del Torro loves we get a Spanish language film that is fresh, beautiful, and inspiring.

The sound and video quality of the blu ray transfer are crystal clear.  In addition, del Torro knows how to put together a blu ray without skimping on the special features.

7625752,5,B002BYYA9A,"""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a dark-fantasy genre film set in 1944 during the latter stages of World War II in Spain.

The blend of reality and fantasy presents the viewer with a unique narrative from the perspective of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who is the protagonist. The world she lives in is extremely harsh with senseless violence all around her, yet it is the vision of an underworld that provides a concurrent existence for her, which highly values her as a princess.

The movie does present a few scenes of rancorous violence and this may not sit well with some viewers. However, it represents the brutality that was present during the early Francoist period.

Despite the darkness of the plot it is a finely crafted story of personal sacrifice.

7625753,4,B002BYYA9A,"There are few movies like Pan's Labyrinth and although grim, worth sitting through to the bitter end. It's a very dark movie, dressed up in a fairy tale to tell a story about the cruelty of war, particularly on children. Without giving away spoilers, that's what I ended up getting out of it. From that aspect and not just the special effects, it's a riveting film and really worth seeing.

It won three Academy awards that were mostly for the visuals, art direction, cinematography and makeup. Guillermo del Toro's direction is superb. The acting is terrific, too.

The ratings here of 1 or 2 are because of the violence, and I do get that, although the most gory is the first scene. The rest isn't as repulsive. It's more psychologically frightening as the movie progresses, not visually. If your squeamish (I am), prepare to hide behind your hands.

What kept me from walking away from it was the story. The film is set in Spain 1944, near the end of WWII and Franco's reign. In Pan's, a small troop of Franco's soldiers, commanded by the evil Captain Vidal (well, he's a fascist-dictator sort) are trying to drive out a band of anti-fascist rebels. The story, of course, is fiction, but based on the real life circumstances of that time. Franco was a Nazi sympathizer, after all. And people did flee to the forest to get away from him and his armies.

I thricely uttered, ""Why am I watching this?"" during the film! It's not a happy film. But del Torro has something to say about war, life, death and immortality and how the most innocent copes with the pain of it.",1335657600,2,1568,4.569395017793594

7625757,1,B002BYYA9A,"I enjoy this movie immensely and on many levels.  The story, acting, setting and special effects (both computer generated and traditional) are spectacular.

My complaint, then, is purely technical in nature.

The product description lists the languages on the disc as both Spanish and English, with a separate entry listed for subtitles, also in Spanish and English.  This led me to believe that there was an English audio track included on the blu-ray version of Pan's Labyrinth that is not present in the DVD release.  This, however, is not the case.

In most cases, I prefer to watch a movie in its original language, as the filmmakers intended, and I am generally not bothered by subtitles.  I would make an exception, though, in the case of this film, or any movie that is as visually dynamic and engaging.  For those of us who are not fluent in Spanish, the use of subtitles can detract from the viewing experience.  I would prefer an English language dub for Pan's Labyrinth for this reason.

I know some people may think that I am lazy or a language snob, or even suffer from xenophobia or something akin to ethnocentrism.  Film fans will continue to argue the merits of subtitle versus dubbed audio for years to come, I am sure.  I would just prefer an English audio track for the sake of convenience, and the product details incorrectly imply that there is such a thing where none exists.",1334016000,29,1398,4.707818930041152

However, that was only the backdrop of the movie really. It is fantastic, yet down to earth and relatable. The characters are believable and the story line is great. The only problem is there seems to be some background information missing about the more fantastic characters of the movie like i guess, Pan, and the child-eater or whoever. I actually went back to look through myths and director interviews and things to see if i could dig into where this stuff is coming from, because it does give the impression that it is rooted in myth, particularly from the name Pan. However, i didn't find anything at all. Either way, a really really lovely story with a realistic message at the end, to reach your personal destiny in this life, no matter the hardships and distractions, so that you can attain paradise after death, whatever that is for you personally.

Yes, it is brutal, but the underlying message, to me, is that good ultimately triumphs over evil. Amidst the horror of war, the little heroine of this film proves that to be so.

The acting is utterly believable and heart-rending. The effects are amazing, and riveting. I have viewed this movie 4 times, and there is always something new to see. This film is soaked in minute details, such is the care that was put into its production.

Combining a pristine and innocent imagination with the heart and soul of a poet, the young heroine Ofelia is seemingly over-matched against the consummate evil of Fascism that has possessed Franco's Spain.  Unable to match their firepower, Ofelia turns to imagination and magic instead.  Del Torro leaves it to the discretionary viewer to decide where fantasy ends and magical reality begins.

Within the magical fantastic occurrences between Ofelia and her fantasy/magical beings are contained lessons in life given to the all-too-human Ofelia.  They provide not only a means of escape but of real life survival, which strongly argues for more than the products of a young but gifted girl's prodigious imagination.

I hum it to my niece and she usually falls asleep to it. The violence in this movie always made me flinch, but that's war. It's not a pretty sight.

I've watched this movie plenty of times that I don't need those bloody English captions anymore and I can see the beauty of the movie I missed with them on. This movie can be terrifying at times.

7625786,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is not for kids.  I cannot repeat this enough: it is a fairy tale, it features children, it features children overcoming grotesque challenges to emerge triumphant, but it is NOT. FOR. CHILDREN.

And that's a shame, because the fairy tales in Pan's Labyrinth once were told to children.  Beware the Poisonous Toad, whose selfish gluttony killed off a magical tree.  Beware the Pale Man, who consumed children that succumbed to their own hunger.  And most importantly, beware Fauns who give orders, for they are tricksters never to be fully trusted.

Poor Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is caught in a power struggle between her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) pregnant with ruthless captain Vidal's (Sergi Lopez) child.  It's clear that Vidal could care less for Ofelia, who is not of his blood.  His only concern is that Carmen bear him a son; the birth of her brother will most certainly send Ofelia to her doom. Caught between these two worlds of war and magic, Ofelia's salvation lies in the rebellious servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) and an ancient faun (Doug Jones).

In the end, Ofelia has no choice.  There are monsters everywhere: lurking in her home, in the forest, and in the labyrinth. Caught between faerie and famine, she can only choose her final home. Depending on your perspective, the ending is a triumph of the human spirit or the sad conclusion to a military conflict. In the end, we discover that little girls are made of sterner stuff than boys: Toads and snails and fairy tales.",1306800000,,1505,4.866666666666666
7625787,4,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth was directed by Guillermo del Toro. The movie is about a girl (ofelia) who has moved to the country because her mother got remarried. Her step-father is a sadistic army officer. She uses her imagination to escape from the stresses of coping with a new family and war.

Plot Rating

The plot has a lot going for it. There is the idea of dealing with a new family, the stresses of war, betrayal, and oppression. I found the fantasy part really appealing and would love to have someone tell me I'm of a different origin and have to do things to get back into that world. The family or lack there of is really good and does a great job at explaining why ofelia has to escape. The war is everywhere in this movie and is another great way to show why she has to escape. The betrayal part is due to one of the workers in the officers house. It is shown superbly and its great what happens when she is confronted. I added the oppression because its in the movie but not a lot is shown. It doesn't take away from the movie though. They added just enough for you to see what the army is doing to the people and how corrupt they are. I give the plot a 8 out of 10

Actors/Actresses

Ivana Baquero does a good job at playing the day dreaming little girl who is curious about her past. Ivana is the star of the movie and she holds her own for a  young actress. It must be difficult to have to basically carry the movie and keep the audience involved but she does this with ease.  You will really start to care for her and root for her to find out about her past. Even if she makes some mistakes along the way.

Sergi Lopez does a great job at playing the tough army officer that will stop at nothing to catch the rebels. His feelings for his new daughter are very negative and it shows in the movie. It's as if she only cares about himself and his baby that her mother is carrying.

Maribel Verdu does a great job at playing the army officers lead house servant and sister to one of the rebels. She has a lot of emotion in this role and it's great when she is confronted about who she really is.  You need to watch out for this character because you end up really caring about her and seeing what she is going to do next and how she is going to get out of certain situations.

Doug Jones plays the faun and he could have been played by anyone. The makeup is amazing though. I wish I could dress like that on Halloween.

I give the actors and actresses and 9 out of 10.

DVD quality

The quality is superb. I only wish I had this on Blue Ray(and a blue ray player to go with it). The scenes are crisp and clear and you can see every detail that is in this movie. The shots are beautiful with the blue and red hues.

I give the quality 10 out of 10.

Personal Thoughts

I thought this movie was great and should be watch by all even if you don't like subtitles. The idea of whether or not she is imaging all of this is greatly played but I gear towards it being real. The movie comes to us from New Line Home Video and the extras are sparse. There is only a audio commentary and a trailer. It would have been great to see a behind the scenes to do all that make-up like they did with X-men. Although I haven't watched a lot of Spanish movies I am a bigger fan than I was.

Overall the movie gets a 27 out of 30.",1306713600,,3312,4.0552147239263805

7625789,5,B002BYYA9A,"Everything about ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (or ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is amazing. The special effects, the cinematography, the twisted-fairytale storyline, the acting, the theme song, etc. One word to describe this film would be ""epic"". It's like a thriller-fantasy-action-drama film with a tint of horror. It all blends in perfectly. It should have been nominated for even more Oscars than it did at the 79th Academy Awards, and even though it's in Spanish, it should have at least been nominated for ""Best Picture"". It's that good. I guess for somebody who's reading this review and never saw the movie probably already know the plot (the plot is in a LOT of the reviews that were written for this movie), so I don't have to explain.
  I love how the film takes place in 1944, the time of the Civil War. That time-setting was perfect for the movie. It also has a well-crafted beginning. It makes you know you're going to get a great fantasy-thriller film. As the movie progresses and it finally gets to the scene with the faun, it starts getting way more interesting. The special effects with all the creatures and insects and fairies were done extremely well. Also, the cinematography is beautiful. The most well-done scenes in the film is when the screen has a blue-ish tint to it, and the very colorful scenes. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" deserved the three Academy Awards that it got (Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup).
  The scenes with the ""tasks"" and the final 30 minutes altogether are intense and well-executed. The ending also has one of the best endings I've seen. It even makes me want to see the credits. The film is really that amazing. For any film lover who hasn't seen ""Pan's Labyrinth"", you need to see it!",1301616000,,1730,4.795302013422819

The direction is superb and the story kept me gripped the whole time, I didn't check my watch once. It is based around a Spanish regiment fighting the guerrillas and follows the step-daughter of the captain and how she cares for her pregnant mother and immerses herself in fairy tales and magic. It is wonderfully fantastical and just surreal enough to lend it an edge. All the actors play their roles brilliantly and the effects are out of this world. I guess you can tell from my already gushing review that I loved this film. It is different from the usual films churned out these days and I loved every minute. Some scenes are quite graphic in places and the violence can make you wince, but none of it is particularly gratuitous and it all plays a part in the overall story.

7625795,5,B002BYYA9A,"This is one of the most imaginative and unique films I have seen in years. It is a dark fairy tale for adults and is not a children's movie. The film is a mixture of fairy tale and dark realism since it combines images from the Mediterranean's pre-Christian mythologies with the horror of Fascism in Franco's Spain. The overlap between these two concepts, classical mythology and fascism, is violence and threat as well as unreasonable power over the powerless. Myths often involve heroic action, often taken by an innocent person or child, that helps overcome the forces of evil. The film is very skillful in combining these concepts where they are verbalized by the mythical creatures but we see a parallel world in reality as the rustic peasants develop resistance to the forces of fascism.
The transitional character between the fantasy world of mythology and the harsh world of fascist reality is a little girl, the daughter of the new wife of a Fascist officer. She travels between these world through an ancient labyrinth hidden in the woods outside the fascist compound. Here she meets mischievous fairies but also a somewhat threatening and mysterious faun who is ambiguous as to his full intentions. The faun is identified as Pan, the child of the god Hermes, who was the god of transitions and doorways. She is told she is the Princess Moana and must undertake 3 tasks to gain her rightful throne. As in many myths, this child is given three tasks to claim their rightful position with the gods. This puts our young heroine into danger not only when she is in the labyrinth performing tasks but also when she is with her mother and step-father among the fascist and hidden resistance fighters. The adventures within the mythological world with a giant toad full of slime to an amazing monster who is awakened when someone eats from his table and who sees through eyeballs in the palms of his hands.
To achieve the tasks prescribed by the gods and to overcome the evils of fascism, resilience and creativity are required and so once again we see overlap between the two worlds. Monstrosity can be reflected in the world of imaginary monsters but also in the acts of the fascists as they torture and kill innocent villagers as well as resistance fighters.  The young female protagonist is not fully protected from the evil of her step-father by her weak mother, suffering with a difficult pregnancy and childbirth. She does not feel fully protected and she is indeed vulnerable to the dark gaze of her dark murderous step-father. She is most protected by the housekeeper who plays many roles in this complex film. Children may retreat into fantasy when threatened but this poor little girl finds a fantasy world that demand much of her and a real world full of real dark threats. This film has some of the best integration of fantasy and reality since A.S. Byatt's the Dijin in the Nightingale's Eye or the works of Borges.
 This film has a different feel to it from a Hollywood production, since it has some ragged ends and images that are more European than North American. This is part of the film's strength. The Pan creature for example would have probably been more of a Santa Claus with goat legs if the film had been made in Hollywood. Instead, he is mysterious and ambiguous in a world with little clarity.

The child actress Ivana Baquero plays the child Ofelia. She does a super job. Sergi Lopez plays her evil, cruel, fascist step-father Captain Vidal. He is an excellent actor and he has the ability to radiate threat on the screen. All scripts, sets, costumes, special effects, and cinematography were excellent. It all comes together into a great film.",1294876800,3,3676,4.776729559748428
7625796,3,B002BYYA9A,"I like historical fiction, and enjoyed the ""real world"" part set in the Spanish Civil War.  Very brutal (for me a negative), but still interesting.  The fantasy parts were mediocre.  Some of the concepts were interesting, but the monsters were pathetic.  I called over my kids so they could laugh at the Pale Man.  Boy, he was scary, and real fast and muscular.  LOL.  The reason he eats very young children is slightly older kids would simply out run him, or even beat him up.  What a wuss monster, it reminds me of some from the worst Sci Fi monsters, like Robot Monster.

7625800,2,B002BYYA9A,"""Pan's Labyrinth""  may have won many Oscars, but it is gory, overly detailed and just depressing to watch.  It shows sadistic behavior and painful situations over and over.  This is not my idea of entertainment.  The setting is Spain in 1944 and a little girl's belief in fairy tales in a grim and stark time.  She has lost her father, her mother is pregnant and very ill, and her stepfather is a brutal Fascist officer.  He is only using her mother to have a son to pass on his name and legacy.  He could care less about little ten year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero).  How she finds any happiness at all is what the story seems to focus on.  It is just a sad, bad movie that tries to be deep and meaningful.  It depresses and fails to strike a chord of any redeeming value.

7625801,2,B002BYYA9A,"I watched this last night on DVD, after hearing considerable praise about it and good ratings, and I fail to understand either.  I suspect however, that much of the praise goes because it was a Del Toro film, the man who gave us the far better ""Hellboy"" flicks and is a name as well known as that of Quentin Tarentino (most of whose films I can't stand--with two notable exceptions--yet he has legions of admiring fans who hype his works and will pretty much rip you apart if you don't.)

My biggest issue is this is a film that is clearly unsure of what it wants to be:  is it a fairy tale, in which case the actual fairy tale elements manage to comprise all of about 15 minutes a two hour movie and largely consist of talking and a few ""magic"" moments, and the appearance of a few Fey creatures; or is it a historical narrative of sorts, of the Spanish Civil War?  In which respect it also fails, except to exemplify the cruelty of a single Fascist, something we've seen time and again.

In short, it fails on both counts, and outside of the main character, Ophelia, being there in both stories, the two elements don't tie together at all.  The characters are dull:  Ophelia's mother is weak, and seemingly cares more for herself than her daughter when she actually gets to act; the rest of the time she spends bedridden and unconscious.  Ophelia herself reminded me of a less obnoxious Lyra from ""Golden Compass"", too strong-willed for her own good but frankly not warm enough to be likable.  The Fascist captain, her stepfather, whose name I didn't even bother to remember, is the stereotype of every ""big military baddie"" ever seen--be they Nazis, Soviets, etc.--and stops being interesting very quickly.  The only other character of note, Mercedes, gets one scene that shows some real depth; the rest of the time she is a fringe character, there, noticed, but not really doing much.

The ending could be called ""happy"" only by stretching the definition.  Another element that drove me nuts is when one of the prominent characters is shot--which happens four times--they stand and stare into space before falling over.  Nobody else does; just those four prominent.  This might work once in a film, but four times?  C'mon...there's drama, and then there's melodrama.  The film is also quite bloody and includes some gory scenes unsuitable for weak stomachs or children.

In the end I'd say if you want to see this film, rent it, don't buy it; also if you hate subtitles, skip it, because unless you speak Spanish you'll need them to follow the story.",1291852800,2,2554,4.665178571428571

7625803,4,B002BYYA9A,"I saw a clip of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" during the Academy Awards ceremony a few years ago.  That clip left with the impression that this was a fantasy film largely oriented to a youthful audience.  I saw it on the IFC Channel's schedule and made a point to watch it since I knew it was nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.

I was immediately impressed with the movie when I understood that it focussed on Spain in the aftermath of its' Civil War.  I have been a student of that conflict over the years and it helped me appreciate the film.  I was very much aware of the extreme passions that emerged during that war.  As the evil persona of the Captain unfolded, I found it to be quite credible.  My next impression was, What happened to the fantasy film I thought I was going to see?  Well, it also emerged but while it was an intregal part of the film, it was far more understated that I had thought it would be.  That was OK by me (I was particularly concerned that this movie might be a cartoon).

""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a movie that becomes increasingly tense and that, to me, is the key to its' success.  I was engrossed in the movie throughout and I liked the mixture of reality and fantasy.

7625809,4,B002BYYA9A,"Fairy tales are violent.  Labyrinths are always dangerous places.  Many fairy tales have been toned down for kids, but in their original forms, Violent.  Getting to the movie, the violence has to be there.  Basically, I think it rips the viewer back and forth between the ""I'm really a princess!"" fantasy world the little girl dreams of and the harsh world the little girl lives in just as the little girl is throw back and forth between that fantasy world and the world in which the country is at war, her father beloved father is dead, her mother is sick, her baby brother is in jeopardy, she's being told to call some other man father, her stepfather is a murderous jerk, and her new best friend (as she has had to leave all of her old friends in the city to move to the country) is a spy who could be discovered and killed at any moment.  While viewers feel sympathy for the little girl's situation given all of that, the violence on screen creates a situation for the viewer.  More empathy.  The viewer (at least those with weaker stomachs) wants to get away from it as much as the little girl and hopes she, at least, succeeds, becomes the princess, finds her ""real"" father (alive and well), her mother (alive and well), etc etc.  Why the ending?  As multiple characters in the film say, there is no magic.  Fairy tales aren't real.  Not for you, me, or anybody else.  No other ending would work.  For what appears to be it's purpose, the movie had to be dark and could have been darker without fault.  In passing, would like to comment on the fact that Captain seems to believe in his own version of a fairy tale, the great man's death.  In fact most characters seem to have some ""fairy tale"" in mind.  Final note: those complaining because they thought this was a kid's movie, check the rating on the DVD, the movie posters, the internet, the theater marquee,....  That's not, and never was, a G.  Don't blame anyone buy yourself for your choice not to take the time to read one letter prominently placed on the advertising materials before tossing your kids in front of the television and going off to do the laundry or whatever.  There's no excuse for being surprised by the fact that this movie isn't for kids.",1278892800,7,2221,4.480099502487562
7625810,5,B002BYYA9A,"Guillermo del Toro is a Mexican director, but El laberinto del fauno is set in fascist dictator Franco's Espana. But for all its fantasy and fairy tale elements, it might just as well be set in Neverland, where all stories begin with ""Once upon a time...""

Vamanos! Our story begins as 11-year-old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) travel to meet her new husband, El Capitn Vidal (Sergi Lpez). El Capitn is stationed in a lonely outpost in the wild country, quelling a rebellion. Carmen is with his child, and is in no condition for such an arduous journey. Nevertheless, he insists that his son should be born where his father is. Ofelia is skeptical of her new step father. Her real father was a tailor.

-------------
Carmen: The captain has been so good to us... Please, Ofelia, call him father. It's just a word, Ofelia, just a word.
========

Vidal is a heartless fascist, and Ofelia senses that immediately. She seeks to escape the harsh regime of El Capitn through stories and fantasies. The lines of demarcation between what seems real and what seems fantastic start to blur. She discovers an ancient stone labyrinth, and her journey has begun.

-------------
Ofelia: My name is Ofelia. Who are you?
Pan: Me? I've had so many names. Old names that only the wind and the trees can pronounce. I am the mountain, the forest and the earth. I am... I am a faun. Your most humble servant, Your Highness.
========

There is a tradition in South American Literature known as Magical Realism, or lo real maravilloso. Though the term was first coined by German art critic Franz Roh in 1925, it was Alejo Carpentier who gave the term its current definition. The Venezuelan essayist and fiction writer Arturo Uslar Pietri was also eager to promote this literary mixture as an exceptional feature of Latin American literature. Magic realist authors include Jorge Luis Borges, Alejo Carpentier, Isabel Allende, and Gabriel Garca Mrquez. ""My most important problem was destroying the lines of demarcation that separates what seems real from what seems fantastic"" said Gabriel Garca Mrquez.

------------
Mercedes: My mother told me to be wary of Fauns.
========

Guillermo del Toro has written a story that falls within the realm of Magical Realism. On a side note, he quotes Sren Kierkegaard when explaining the ending, but I can't reveal the quote without spoiling the ending.

This story was very close to Guillermo's corazn, and legend has it that he turned down an offer to direct The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to do this film instead. He gave up his entire salary, including back-end points, to see this film realized. He was offered double the budget by Hollywood producers provided the film was made in English, but he turned them all down, unwilling to compromise. He even wrote all the English subtitles himself, to ensure that they were true to his original vision.

For years he kept a sketch book where he would draw pictures and scribble notes about his ideas for the film, until one day he left it in a taxi. He was going to give up on the project, but the cab driver, realizing the importance of the notes, tracked him down and returned them. He took this as a sign that he should continue his quixotic quest.

--------------
Capitn Vidal: I choose to be here because I want my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.
=========

The bottom line is that Guillermo del Toro's film is a masterpiece like Jean Cocteau's La belle et la bte or Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands. It's a film that creates a fable, which is much harder to do than it looks. Guillermo speaks the language not only of films, but also of dreams, of myths, and of fairy tales. His notes and sketches for this film remind me of the recently discovered Red Book by Carl Jung, where Jung also attempted to capture the ephemeral dreams and notions of his subconscious and divine their meaning.

--------------
Carmen: You're getting older, and you'll see that life isn't like your fairy tales. The world is a cruel place. And you'll learn that, even if it hurts.
[throws the mandrake onto the fire]
Ofelia: No! No!
Carmen: Ofelia! Magic does not exist. Not for you, me or anyone else.
=========

Though the film does have elements of the fairy tale it is not for young children, because the world's more full of weeping than they can understand. There are some quite disturbing moments of violence that are only too real. One character, the Pale Man, played by Doug Jones (who also portrayed El Fauno), was so unsettling that he even made Stephen King squirm. Del Toro was seated next to King at a screening and he compared seeing the horror king's reaction to winning three Oscars. Besides the three Oscars and three other Oscar nominations, his film also received a 22 minute standing ovation at Cannes.

--------
Ofelia: Mercedes, do you believe in fairies?
Mercedes: No. But when I was a little girl, I did. I believed in a lot of things I don't believe anymore.
Ofelia: Last night a fairy visited me.

7625811,5,B002BYYA9A,"excellent job on this movie. dark and violent, but high quality storytelling and film making.",1277856000,,93,5.266666666666667
7625812,3,B002BYYA9A,"A movie like Pan's Labyrinth - popular for its mythical creatures, weird fairies and so on - is enigmatically interesting because it's possible that the 'genre' (and thus message) of the movie changes according to the status assigned to said creatures.

If the creatures were real, then it's Fantasy and all that this implies for a war-oriented movie. If they were NOT real, then one could say that the movie is essentially about psychosis, escapism, people 'dealing with' the horror of war, traumatic realism, etc. in which case the director del Toro would have to be conveying a different message entirely.

Then again maybe del Toro left it to us to decide, thus creating the paradox scenario where we, the viewers, have a say in ""what kind of movie"" we're watching. Given a parallax move, we could even say we were watching two different movies entirely. Or, to push the envelope deeper, what if we were watching two movies enmeshed, hybridize and juxtaposed together thereby creating a ""third"" movie, NEITHER a war NOR fantasy movie but a movie where possibility is always in the making, where perspectives fluctuate and **where the undecidability of what is real is ITSELF a critical element of the reality we inhabit**??

In a word, Pan's Labyrinth is about the significance of knowing but not knowing. Ofelia experiences the creatures and the satyr but can never know if she is being really helped or simply cruelly misled. In a heart-thumping scene, Ofelia has to retrieve a key from a child-eating monster asleep at a table and, despite being told not to eat of anything, goes on and consumes two apples resulting in the monster waking up and almost catching her. Doesn't this scene suggest that Ofelia has trouble deciding on the nature of the knowledge imparted by the satyr and, yet again, didn't her ambivalence almost prove disastrous? Carmen, her mother, knows that being with the Captain is a necessary move but also 'knows' it's not (so what is it that she really knows?). The Captain, despite being an seasoned war commander, didn't know that Mercedes and the doctor was a spy, or at least not until it was too late and he was given a 'Glasgow Smile' (a wound inflicted by Mercedes whom he had tied up but who released herself behind his back but right under his nose). In the end, of course, Ofelia 'learns' that she is the incarnate (but amnesiac?) Princess Moanna. Her knowledge of this fact both redeems and ends her life and then the story. Yet this leaves all the other characters in the dark (of knowledge). So we have a girl who achieves (some kind of) immortality via true knowing, a knowing which generates a final un-knowing or, conversely, a finality of un-knowing.

The quasi-suspended nature of the ending only heightens the point that the movie was always about the irreducible double-seeing, un-seeing and perceptive indecision which fills our world. Del Toro has presented us with a striking red herring. He's made it seem like we have to decide if we're watching magical realism or simply a story of a girl with an over-stimulated imagination, when in fact *the act of choosing* is the very enigma we are expected to recognise, appreciate and, ultimately, live with.",1277856000,4,3203,4.850091407678245

7625815,4,B002BYYA9A,"This Spanish movie is billed as a fairy tale for adults and it is a grim fairy tale.
Ofelia, an adorable nine-year-old who loves fairy tales, moves with her pregnant mother to a remote military base. Ofelia's father is dead and her mother has remarried a military captain in charge of the encampment. The Spanish Civil War is officially over but a band of stubborn guerrillas fights on in the hills.

The Captain, one immediately perceives, is the epitome of the evil step-father. He's constantly cleaning his weapon and polishing his jackboots and when he's not doing that he's torturing prisoners and taking sadistic pleasure from it. He also doesn't care much for Ofelia.

She escapes into a fantasy world which suddenly comes to life when a faun appears and tells her she is the lost princess of an underworld kingdom and can reclaim her crown by performing three tasks before the moon is full.

What distinguishes this fairy tale from others I have seen is the juxtaposition of reality, in the shape of the war raging outside, Ofelia's mother's dangerous pregnancy and her own uncertain status in the captain's household, and the magical world which seems equally dangerous and treacherous. Rain is constantly falling throughout the movie, greatly adding to the mood of growing disquiet and menace. The captain is revealed as one of the most evil characters depicted on the screen for many a long day.

The two world finally intersect in a chilling and shattering climax complete with overt Christian overtones. I will not give away the ending, which to me was the movie's one weak spot, but suffice to say that this is a film that will stay in your head long after the closing credits.",1276560000,3,1691,4.820689655172414

And it almost killed him, I don't think so. Almost getting killed would be someone is Iraq or Afghanistan. I liked Hellboy, so I'm not bashing all his movies, just this one. Switching from the civil war to the underworld seemed to disjointed; I wish it could have been one or the other. I also get that there was a paralell between the two, still I didn't like  it.

In general, I don't need to see the violence to get the big picture. I don't appreciate films that beat it over your head to show you how bad a character is. I kinda like the movies of the old days where you *knew* something awful was happening but there was no need or desire to shove it in the audience's face. Worst of all is when it is gratuitous, which I felt it was, in this film. The wine bottle bashing on the nose repeatedly, for example. I don't need to see that in order to realize that the Captain was a sadistic sicko. I've seen plenty of films with violent moments, but at least those moments were justified. They served a purpose in the fullness of the story. When that monster bit the heads off the fairies, i was like, ""oh come on!"" Give me a break. I mean, really!

The pacing was so slow I could barely stand it. I also didn't feel the story came together very well. The acting was good, that wasn't the problem. Too long, gratuitous violence (in a film that looks like its for kids), and just not a great story.

7625821,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pans Labyrinth is an interesting film which gives the viewer an amazing insight to the way that the 1944 Spanish civil war could affect an innocent child. Directed by Guilleme Del Toro, the film is enjoyable for the audience to watch, but also makes them think about the deeper meaning of the plot and how a childish escape from the real world can be taken too far.

Being only fourteen, and under the reccomended age for the film to be viewed at, you would be surpirised at how much i understood of this film, and also how interesting it was to me. Although, to be honest if i had viewed this at age any younger than mine, i would not have understood the film and i would have had nightmares for a few days as it does have some disturbing scenes. I would rate this film a 5 simply because of the entertainment factor as it is a very good movie as a whole, but also because, like very few movies i have seen, it really makes you think.

On the outside, Ofelia is a young girl with a vivid imagination who, along with her heavily pregnant mother, has to move to the base of her new-step father, the captain. When she discovers a labyrinth and meets a faun, Ofelia finds herself being swept into the world of fairytales like the ones she reads about. She is given three life-threatning tasks which will prove she is Princess Moanna of the underworld. Although she breaks the rules in the second task, when she is shot dead at the end by the captain, in her imagination she returns to fufil her place as a princess.

Altough this is infact the story, there also seem to be much deeper meanings to the film, for example the way that at certain points in the movie, things seem to represent different things, such as in the scene where Ofelia has to face the toad. In a way, it could possibly be seen that the fig tree and toad represent the facists, and Ofeila represents the resistence. After watching the film it should be easier to see why i think this, but it is only a suggestion and was probably never delibrate. It can also be seen at several occasions in this film, whilst in the 'fairytale world' Ofelia seems to take up most of camera and be prioritised in the shot, whereas in the 'real world' she is very small in comparision to the adults and the background, although again, this could just be me reading further into this than i need to.

Overall, Pans Labyrinth is oone of the best films i have seen in a long time, and although i usually stick to horrors, this one will always be on my top 5 favourite list of movies. It is definatly worth a watch, but for younger children it is not something i would recommend, as i know i would not have liked to watch it much younger than this.",1269388800,,2693,4.316205533596838
7625822,5,B002BYYA9A,"This one makes my list of 5 movies I never want to be without, and never get old. I'll say up front, this one is not for everyone, but most everyone can find some aspect of it they enjoy. I was pretty ambivalent about watching it when my husband rented it, and I figured I had a 2 hour nap ahead of me. I was more than pleasantly surprised and I undoubtedly liked it even more than he did, not that he disliked it by any means.

It would appear from the posters and advertising images that this is purely a fantastical movie not unlike Lord of the Rings, but that is only a portion of the story. It is part coming of age, part war, part fantasy and part Shakespearean-like tragedy.

The story is based on a young girl that finds herself in a war-torn place no young girl belongs, so her active imagination takes her away from it all and delves deeply into a fairy tale world of princesses, evil creatures, and extraordinary quests with a modern day, dark Cinderella type quality. Her hateful stepfather excels at playing his character, especially after I heard the actor, in real life, is a sort of Spanish Robin Williams comic. But you can't picture it when watching this movie because he so incredibly convincing as a hateful, angry, selfish character and gives new meaning to the term ""hijo de punta"". And Mercedes is nothing short of inspiring and one of my favorite strong women characters.

That said, this is NOT a movie for children. Many people judged too quickly from ads and a story about a young girl and were rather unhappy when they expected to see a family movie for all ages. It has a few violent scenes that would easily upset young children and the general story line is adult content, even without a lot of harsh language, nudity or the usual things that make most movies ""R"" rated. Most younger kids would scarcely understand the deeper plot and you'll end up waking up to screams of nightmares for days, so do yourself and your kids a favor and if you're considering letting them watch it, view it without them first and decide for yourself. Maturer children could probably handle it, but I wouldn't recommend it without parents seeing it first. Consider that a strong disclaimer.

It is in spanish, with english subtitles, but it is so well acted and edited that you won't be lost if you miss a sentence here or there, so don't let this sway you. It is hardly a typical foreign film with a winding plot that could leave you in the dust if you aren't a fast reader, or have you reading so much you miss all the imagery. It often almost seems like a good opera, that though you may not understand every individual word, the meaning is always well conveyed to the audience.

The story itself is absolutely beautiful, and I could easily see it adapted as a new age stage play or opera that I would be happy to see. The gorgeous soundtrack is also a can't miss, easily competing with the likes of Oscar winning John Barry (Somewhere in Time, Out of Africa, Chaplin, Playing by Heart, Dances with Wolves...).

This is such an excellent movie, I'll never tire of watching it time and again. It is brilliant in its simplicity, but doesn't drag, or spoon-feed the audience or have a forced happy-go-lucky ending to please the masses. I'd tell you more, but its definitely better with some surprises that are sure to take your breath away.",1268956800,,3351,4.503289473684211
7625823,5,B002BYYA9A,"First to the criticisms.

Watch a large preying mantis-like wood bug change into a fairy and lead you into the dark woods and 'the labyrinth'.  Yes, it could almost be a fairy tale - in the modern sense of the word - but for the violence, which is quite severe in places.  In that regard, it is more like the original faery tales long before they were Disnified, and which could also be somewhat gruesome. Set in Franco's Spain at the end of world war II, the story follows a young girl's entrance into a magical world as a cruel dictator, her would-be step-father, wages war against rebels in the forest outside.  Not for the kiddies.  There is a heavy kind of menace and violence that helps convince and adds weight to the story in the right places.  Bloody yet swift-moving, it is a tale cloaked in layers of art, symbolism, spirituality and * magic *.  What a rich tone this movie has - so full of dark and light, a masterpiece of color.  The fact that it is in Spanish (English subtitles) really does enhance its mystique and somehow gives greater authenticity to its magic.  A very potent movie.",1267747200,3,1251,4.515555555555555
7625825,2,B002BYYA9A,"Looking for a nice fantasy film to watch? Look somewhere else.

I am far from squeamish when it comes to movie violence. But this film was so disturbingly violent that I nearly turned it off a couple times. Want some examples?

A man gets his face bashed in with a wine bottle, and the viewer is treated to about twenty nose-crunching blows, blood spouting, the man twitching in agony, his father screaming.

On another occasion, we are shown a scene where the Spanish nationalist captain is nonchalantly shooting wounded enemy combatants in the head. He finds one fellow who is still sitting up, alive and conscious, and aims his gun at his face. The man pushes the gun away. The captain moves it back. He pushes it away again. This happens a couple more times before the captain simply shoots the man in the face through his hand.

And then there are the torture scenes. And the scene where one of the characters gets a knife stuck in his mouth and half of his cheek sliced open.

Nice night at the movies, right?

The trouble with this film is that it is billed as a fantasy, not a horror movie gore-fest.

And of course, there are the political/religious overtones. If you know nothing about the Spanish Civil War, you won't pick them up. Let it suffice to say that the communists are the good guys, and the Catholics and nationalists are hideously brutal thug-like criminals. There is even a scene where a priest encourages the sadistic nationalist commander to basically kill them all and let God sort them out. Nice.

I give this movie two stars because the fantasy element is interesting and well done. It is also slightly horrifying, but whimsically so. The movie has something of a good message at the end, too. The heroine, the little girl Ofelia, sacrifices herself to save an innocent. Unfortunately, the fantasy element only makes up about 25% of the movie and the good message is too easily lost amid the hideously brutal violence that permeates this film.

Not recommended for human consumption.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" opens in 1944, and is set in Spain. Five years have passed since the Spanish Civil War ""officially"" finished, although there is still a Resistance fighting against the Franco's Falangists. As part of the state's solution, military outposts have been established to deal with the ""problem."" The film's main character is Ofelia, a young girl who is devoted to reading. As the film opens, she is travelling with her heavily pregnant mother to at one of these military outposts. Captain Vidal, the outpost's commanding officer, is Ofelia's stepfather and the outpost will become her new home. Vidal is as cruel, vindictive and selfish as you'd expect from a Fascist and Ofelia (unsurprisingly) grows to hate him. With her mother desperate to please him and provide a `safe' home, Ofelia's only real ally is Mercedes, the housekeeper. Mercedes, however, is anything but a collaborator : her brother is in the Maquis, and she helps them in any way she can.

Luckily, there is the chance of an escape. A long time ago in a wonderful underground kingdom, a young princess dreamt of blue skies and bright sunshine. One day, she managed to escape her guardians and found a way to the human world ""up above"". Unfortunately, the brightness of the sun blinded her and wiped her memory. She suffered pain and sickness and, in time, she died. Her father, however, knew her soul would return at another time and in another place and he would wait for her return. When Ofelia follows a fairy into the labyrinth close to her new home, she meets a faun...who tells her she is the princess returned. Unfortunately, she must first complete three tasks before she's allowed to return to her former home. However, from the film's opening scene, you know things are not going to be easy for Ofelia.

Despite the fairytales and mythical creatures, I wouldn't really say ""Pan's Labyrinth"" it a movie for children - it is quite dark and a couple of scenes are really very unpleasant. In fact, despite the fantasy element, the film's biggest monster is Vidal : poisonous, nasty, vicious and brutal, he barely tolerates Ofelia and views her mother as little more than a walking womb. Mercedes, on the other hand, is everything Vidal isn't - protective, honourable, loving and kind. However, it is an excellent movie overall and - so long as you don't mind subtitles - is totally recommended.",1259452800,5,2616,4.847874720357942

7625831,5,B002BYYA9A,"If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.

This brings us to one of Del Toro's most brilliant works, the luminously gritty ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (""El Laberinto del Fauno""). This enchanted little film is a sequel of sorts to ""The Devil's Backbone,"" a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War -- but this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting. In short, Del Toro weaves a web of frightening magic all around the audience.

Time and place: 1944, Spain, during the Spanish Civil War. A little girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi Lpez). Unsurprisingly Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.

But to do so, he tells her that she must do three things. Ofelia manages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. And in the ordinary world, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous, threatening the one tie she has to her family. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever... and being offered a terrible choice if she wants to get in.

Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares (and adults can feel that they're actually doing something for the kids). But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones full of  mystery and danger, especially the ones that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes ""Pan's Labyrinth"" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt: that blur between magic and danger, reality and fantasy.

And Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style that wraps you up in his visions, but never to the point of making his audience feel too comfortable with his magical world. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, the fairies, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape. At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the ""real world"" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow, and the bittersweetness of her story makes it more painfully real.

But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere ""safe."" Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond, and is desperate to escape the terrible situation of her ""real life"" by going there. And Lpez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.

Few movies deserve the Criterion treatment  more than this one, so it's good to see it getting the deluxe treatment -- in addition to the digital master and new HD audio soundtracks, it also has a commentary by Del Toro, interviews with Del Toro and Doug Jones (one by fantasy author Cornelia Funke), animated comics, an interactive digital notebook, four making-of documentaries, an essay by Michael Atkinson, and loads more behind-the-scenes stuff.

Half ""Mirrormask"" and half gritty war story, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the best fantasy stories in years -- dark, passionate and beautifully made. Definitely a great movie.",1258243200,4,3917,4.806835066864784

One thing that saddens me though is that there are some reviewers of this film who are giving it a low grade because they didn't know that it was a Spanish film with English subtitles.  It's really a shame that the people who went into this film uninformed are bringing down the rating of a spectacular film.  After a while, I honestly didn't even realize I was watching a subtitled film.  The story and acting are very strong and the effects are simply stunning.

I am still disturbed by this movie, which creeps up in my nightmares - and it's been over a year since I've seen it.  I wish with all my heart that I had never watched it - and my husband (who loves horror films!) feels the same way.  Being parents may be part of this - dead children aren't my favorite things.  This movie of course was very artistic, but please bear in mind - it's a hard-hitting, graphic, realistic, and nightmarish tale.  I would've rated it NC-17.  Just one example - there is a terrifying monster that dines on children.  I don't think the story was that fantasy-based - more of it was about real-life horrors, which made it all the more depressing.  If you enjoy depressing tales that make you wish you had never been born, you might like this movie.

This remarkable movie is alternately beautiful and grotesque, cruel and fantastic.  Ofelia's fairyland is not a cute Disney version of make-believe, but a dark and scary place and this movie is definitely not for children.

It sounds like a children's fantasy yet it isn't, there are many brutal and dark sequences in the movie which make it totally unsuitable for younger audiences. You are asked to wonder whether Ofelia is imaging the world she finds herself in, in order to escape her brutal reality or whether she is really finding her way to another world. Either interpretation is acceptable yet I feel that the film makers would like you to fall into the second camp, that she is leaving her world behind.

The violence. This is a pretty violent movie, yet it is as though the violence is needed as a dire signal of how bad the situation is. There is also a disturbing ""old-man with eyeballs for hands"" creature that has all the food before it, yet it rather dine on kids. A strange paradox, if you catch its meaning.

Never had I felt so much hate for a fictional character before. Sergi Lpez playing the Captain had me begging for someone to put an end to his monstrous cold-heartedness.

7625865,5,B002BYYA9A,"Part gothic fantasy, part political statement, Guillermo del Toro's masterwork is clearly a labor of love, profounding, beautiful, and awe-inspiring.

Pan's Labyrinth tells the story of young Ofelia (played by eleven-year-old Ivana Baquero), a child who is forced to move, along with her pregnant mother, into a massive old millhouse cottage which is nestled deep within a dense forest. This building also happens to house the militaristic Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), Ofelia's ""father."" From the outset it is clear that war is in the air, but none of this concerns Ofelia. She is fascinated with books and the amazing stories that fill them. Ofelia comes across a mysterious garden labyrinth found behind the cottage. the little girl encounters Pan (Doug Jones), a mysterious and magical character who informs her that she is actually the princess of the underworld. In order to return to her real father and take her place at his side, she must accomplish three tasks, each more dangerous and terrifying than the last.

Pan's Labyrinth sports an amazing overall design, from makeup to sets to lighting and camera work. The lighting is gorgeous and moist. The sound design fits perfectly and does an excellent job of fleshing out the world. And Javier Navarrete's score, a haunting lullaby is one of the most crucial pieces of this expertly fantasy film. Ivana Baquero also deserves to be recognized, as it is her mature and captivating performance which drives the film to higher and higher levels.

As the film finishes and the credits roll, you will feel as if you have woken from a fever-dream. Impressions, emotions, and memories may recede into the mists, but certain, vivid images will refuse to fade away. Ofelia, Pan, and their story burn into the brain.

7625867,1,B002BYYA9A,"This movie starts off well, and it's obviously very well-filmed. The imagery of the Spanish countryside in the beginning is striking and magical. The journey of Ofelia and her mother to the mill is interesting. The dialogue and acting seems solid. But soon the graphic violence of Captain Vidal takes precedence over any other element of the movie. At first this violence filled me with hatred towards Vidal alone, which was good, and made me appreciate the effectiveness of the direction to inspire these feelings, but then the graphic violence continued over and over, scene after scene, apparently supposed to build your anger and suspense, but the thing is that you already hated Vidal to the utmost at the beginning; the audience gets that Vidal is an evil monster from his first act of cruelty, when he has an innocent teenage boy grotesquely beaten to death in front of his father, and then has his father shot. But this film continues to shove so much torture down the audience's throat that it made my disgust spill over to the writer, the director and everyone involved in the concept of this movie. It was utterly pointless to rehash the horrific acts over and over, and did absolutely nothing for the film.

In defense of this movie, some people have said that fairy tales are supposed to be dark. Of course they are. But this was not merely a ""dark fairy tale."" It ceased to be a dark fairy tale somewhere around a quarter of the way through and turned into a sadistic torture film. If there had been only a couple of scenes of it, that could have been good, but the scenes of graphic horror far outweighed the fantastical ones (which I might add were not very fantastical to begin with, but more filled with a brooding anxiety, while the satyr Faun was simply creepy.. not giving the audience a good antidote/contrast to the darkness of the real world). In this day and age, many people seem to think abundant violence in movies can be complex and intelligent, which is a travesty. You don't need a horde of torture scenes for a complex movie. Quite the opposite. They could have filmed the expressions and the reactions of the characters, rather than all of the graphic horror acts themselves, and that would have been much deeper and complex.

I also have to say that there were a lot of weak characters in this story, like Ofelia's mother, Carmen. She was a weak mother, and that was such a shame to see. In many fairy tales, the mother is either dead or a nonentity, so I thought this would be a great opportunity to portray a strong mother for a change. Nope. She seems purposely oblivious to her husband's brutality at times, scared at others, and overall too weak emotionally and mentally to protect herself, her daughter or her coming son. In fact, Ofelia and the maidservant Mercedes are the only strong and admirable female characters, but Ofelia is only a girl.

The ending does not compensate for the disturbing flaws of this movie. It's not satisfying at all, and you don't feel like Vidal gets his due, or that Ofelia truly triumphs after she tried so hard to fight. And after all of the darkness of the movie, you really need that feeling of triumph and purpose, but you don't get it. Overall, there was very little to appreciate and nothing to learn from this movie. It was not only a disappointment, but a distasteful experience.",1234828800,64,3360,4.643697478991597

7625870,5,B002BYYA9A,"Billed as a ""fairy tale for adults,"" del Toro's brilliant depiction of the brutal aftermath of the Spanish Civil War through a fantastical tale of fauns, quests, and a lost princess is far more moving than a straightforward account could ever be.  Bookish, creative Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) finds herself at a remote military outpost when her pregnant mother marries the cruel commander, Captain Vidal.  Ofelia finds herself amidst men who don't hesitate to torture and kill and rebels who are willing to sacrifice their own lives for freedom.  The Captain sees Ofelia as a disposable appendage of her mother, and her mother, suffering from pregnancy complications, cannot care for her.  As Ofelia meets a insect-like fairy and a faun (Pan, in the English translation), she descends into a fantastical world that is every bit as dark as the one in the outpost.

Through these two parallel worlds, del Toro manages to offer hope where there is none, and freedom in an unescapable situation. The relationship between the Captain's servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Y-Tu-Mama-Tambien/dp/B00005JL57/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Y Tu Mama Tambien</a>) and Ofelia is poignant as the two find refuge in a surrogate mother/daughter bond.  The chemistry between the two actresses is palpable and believable; without it, the connection between the real and the fantasy worlds would not have succeeded.

Viewers who like more traditional methods of storytelling will likely be disappointed, as this film is darkly bizarre, with much ambiguity.  Those who like unusual foreign films (and don't mind reading subtitles) will embrace this twisted tale of a child abandoned in an unforgiving world.

7625871,5,B002BYYA9A,"The Bottom Line:

A movie that tells two fascinating stories equally well, with invention and creativity and great performances (Sergi Lopez's Vidal has to go on a list of all-time villainous villains) and never a dull moment, Pan's Labyrinth is easily one of the best movies to come out in the last decade and also easily one of my favorite films.",1233446400,,348,4.704918032786885
7625872,5,B002BYYA9A,"Even if you're not into foreign films, this is a must-own if you enjoy films in the fantasy genre.  It takes place during the immediate aftermath of the Spanish civil war in the latter stages of WWII.  The protagonist, Ofelia, and her mother travel to the mountains to be with her stepfather, Captain Vidal, a brutal commander charged with fighting Spanish rebel forces hiding out in the mountains.  Ofelia's mother is pregnant with Vidal's child and has joined Vidal at his post to finish the remainder of her pregnancy.

Soon thereafter, Ofelia encounters a fairy in the woods who takes her to see the Faun (i.e., Pan).  Faun believes Ofelia is the long-lost Princess Moanna of the underworld, who left the underworld centuries ago to become mortal.  The Faun then sends Ofelia off to perform certain tasks to prove she is, in fact, the princess, so that she can return to the underworld which can only be done through the Faun's portal.

All of this is set against the backdrop of the harsh conditions of post-civil war Spain (headed by the Franco regime) and, more particularly, Capt. Vidal's dictatorial leadership of his men and the village in which they now reside.  Vidal is the perfect villain, the kind you love to hate, whereas Ofelia is very easy to root for.  Ofelia and Vidal have an uneasy relationship from the start, and the director will make you wonder whether Ofelia's encounters with the fantasy world are ""real"" or just her imaginary world - her way of coping with the pain of living with Vidal.  Simulaneously, there is the subplot of whether the rebels will be able to avoid being caught by Vidal and his men.

When I first saw this in the theaters, I was blown away by it and now own the DVD.  I've seen it several times since and it doesn't get old.  The cast is excellent, and both Ofelia's quest and the realistic subplot are captivating.  The film explores a number of themes here - freedom, independence, the desire to feel special - and ultimately is a very touching story.  It doesn't drag at all and will be over before the you know it, and that's even while watching subtitles!  Highly recommended!",1233100800,,2132,4.660427807486631

So on to the movie, I wasn't really sure what it was about by the previews, but it seemed to be some kind of dark, almost horror movie. The effects weren't your typical CGI, they had a very dark fairy tell look to them. It also looked more natural than say, LOTR or King Kong.

The story was interesting if not violent and disturbing. Yet it wasn't something that was intended to be as dark and punishing as possible. It was all created to flow and create a seamless reality, as if this was to have really happened. Which made me love it all the more.

The movies characters were fun, and memorable. Many of the scenes stuck with me, which isn't something that every movie manages. It resonated a little deeper and kept me watching.

7625876,4,B002BYYA9A,"Visually stunning. However, this film suffers from an identity crisis. It is a fairy tale. A real Grimm's Brother's tale--not some Disneyfied feel good animated adventure. Like the Grimm's original tales, it is full of darkness, shadows and things that go bump in the night. But also, it is a film full of the wonder of being a child.

Unlike most fairy tales, it lacks a moral or lesson; and the film is so full of graphic violence and blood shed, no adult in their right mind would take their kid to see it. And there you have this film's real failing. It doesn't know who its audience is. If the blood and violence had been toned down a bit and it's message more clearly defined it could have easily been one of the greatest children's fairy tales of all time.

Perhaps Del Toro feels people wouldn't take his work seriously if he made a children's film. And so he brings in the Nazi's and politics and all sorts of adult rubbish, splashes them all over his film and says ""hey, it's ok for you to watch it. It's an adult fairy tale now."" And, in this he almost succeeds.

Underneath the muck and filth of the adult world that surrounds her, the innocent and fantastic imaginings of a young girl remind us once again what it is like to be a child again. But these moments are few and fleeting, flashes of something greater in a film soiled by the ordinary. It comes so close at times, it makes me wonder whether it is just a fluke, or if Del Toro just failed miserably at bringing his latest work out of the fog of budgets, deadlines, and Hollywood profiteering.

However you look at it, this film is less then the sum of its parts. However, some parts are worth watching just for themselves. The Fawn for instance is simply . . . well, amazing. In an industry drowning in a sea of computer graphics, this simple earthy and real looking creation is just breathtaking. When I saw the trailer for the film, this was what drew me to it. Also, the fairy tale itself, following the classical framework of tales hundreds of years old is also, ironically, refreshing.

guns, explosions, Fascists vs. the resistance, torture
Forbidden fruit, eternal life, blood atonement, sacrifice:
the makings of a fairy tale, a war movie and a Christian parable, all to be found in Guillermo del Toro's Spanish language film -- elements that will certainly attract and repel viewers in equal numbers.
Lovers of fantasy may be lost when they learn of the graphic scenes of shootings, stabbings and battlefield surgery in Pan's Labyrinth (or El Laberinto del Faurn). Enthusiasts of World War II might not be pleased to learn that the central character of the film is a little girl, given three tasks to prove that she is the princess of an underground kingdom. And I read critics who were not pleased that with the film's Christian imagery.
The film is an adult fairy tale, and the criticism that fairy tales are for children is addressed within the film itself. Ofelia, the heroine of the story, is told by her mother and stepfather that she is too old for fairy tales. And yet she finds within her fantasies wisdom to live in a difficult and dangerous world. The moral clarity found in such tales is occasionally scoffed at by some grown-ups as simplistic. They argue the world never has any clear heroes or villains, black or white, only shades of grey. They would also argue that only the material world exists and it is foolish to believe in anything outside of what we can perceive through our senses.
I would argue that the stark contrasts between good and evil found in fairy tales can at times be found in the real world. In the Old Testament battles, God was on the good side in many of the battles between Israel and evil foes. During our Civil War, ultimately the side defending slavery was in the wrong. And in World War II, one side definitely could be defined as right and the other as wrong.
And those who believe that there is nothing beyond ourselves and what we can see and hear, touch and taste and smell, they have bought into a lie much darker and devoid of truth than any story Disney ever animated.
We are given a grim picture of what it was like to live under the repressive regime of Franco's Spain during World War II. The government kept the people dependant on itself for foods and goods. One scene shows soldiers dispersing bread to citizens, and as they do they announce that the daily bread comes through the beneficence of the government. God's providence is given no place in such a dictatorship.
The very worst of the government is personified through Ofelia's stepfather, Capitan Vidal, a sadist shown torturing captives and casually killing the innocent. Those who would say such violence has no place in fairy tales just don't know how grim the Brothers Grimm could be.
I found the most interesting aspect of the film was introduction of the theme of blood atonement. To avoid spoilers, I can't tell too much about how this theme is used in the film, but it is there, with great Biblical resonance.
Hebrews 9: 22 says, ""Without the shedding of blood there can be no forgiveness of sins."" This essential Biblical doctrine at times seems like an outdated piece of myth and legend. But by placing this theme in the midst of a war, a time when the shedding of blood is a daily transaction, we are reminded of its truth.
We tend to think of sin as a petty offense that should be cleared up as one would pay for a parking ticket. The film reminds us that when dealing with issues such as life and death, war and sin, is not child's play, but we do need childlike faith.",1227916800,4,3554,4.589622641509434
7625881,5,B002BYYA9A,"If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" (""El Laberinto del Fauno"") is a sequel of sorts to ""The Devil's Backbone,"" a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War. But this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting -- in short, a triumph.

Time and place: 1944, Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi Lpez). Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.

To do so, he tells her that she must do three things, and gives her a strange book. Ofelia menages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. Even worse, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever... and being offered a terrible choice if she wants to get in.

Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares. But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones for adults, that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes ""Pan's Labyrinth"" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt.

Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style and brilliant visuals. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape.

At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the ""real world"" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow that her ""real life"" is full of. But Del Toro's biggest triumph is an ending that is beautifully bittersweet, and which turns out to hinge on Ofelia's newborn brother.

But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere ""safe."" Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond. And Lpez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.

7625900,5,B002BYYA9A,"""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a masterfully executed fairy tale in the old-fashioned tradition: dark and atmospheric, full of stunning imagery, both beautiful and terrifying. With this film, Guillermo del Toro has proved himself a master not only of the visual elements of filmmaking, but also of credible storytelling. The way that certain thematic elements were developed throughout the movie was fascinating, and the film's ultimate emotional resonance is undeniable. One of the most brilliant things about this movie is that the line between the grotesque and fantastic world of the labyrinth and the stark, brutal world of post-Civil War Spain is deliberately blurred. This ambiguity is what ultimately gives the narrative its urgency and the film its deep sense of mystery.

The violence in this film disturbed me quite a bit; on the one hand the depiction of such brutality makes sense in the context of the story, yet I can't help but feel that it was gratuitous at times. I also think that the black-and-white delineation of fascists=bad and socialists=good fails to do justice to the moral and political complexity of the Spanish Civil War. On the whole, though, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a beautifully realized work of great imagination, and definitely worth your time.",1222473600,,1266,5.205882352941177

7625903,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is a profoundly historical movie; Not only the interesting back ground the director superbly creates but also the implication of historical continuity the director skillfully proffers to audience through the destiny of various characters in the movie. Indeed, it is so rare that you encounter such a beautiful movie armed with stunning visual , superb acting and intelligent plot in recent years; holy trinity of movie making. Furthermore, the plot does not abuse usual deus ex machina type of device that have been abused by numerous screen writers in this genre of movies.

Pan't Labyrinth is not ""Fable"" or ""Fantasy"" movie,nevertheless the role of Pan is the nexus between the reality and psychological world of Ofelia.
In fact , the movie is terribly realistic and based on the nightmarich past that deeply embedded in the psyche of Spaniards who went through the civil and its more than three decades of nightmare. Yes, it is the movie that converges the reality and fantasy at the last scene that is both climax and anti-climax of the movie .

The movie is a heartwrenching tradegy . I don't only mean the trageic destiny of Ofelia but almost every charaters of the movie. There is easy to catch pararell between Ofelia and her new born brother,begotten by Captain Vidal, the archetype of European nihilism and sickening sadistic fascist and the son of  one of Africanos(those who fought in Rif war in Moroco such as Franco ,Queipo de Llano,Sanjuro,Yague) and Mercedes and her brother Paolo. All of their destiny is bleak and tragic. However, Ofelia's refusal of Pan's offer provide the glimpse of hope , otherwise terribly tragic and depressing ending.

It's my interepretation ,but Del Toro doesn't take a left-leaning perspective in this movie. The most obvious example would be the pale one eye monster scene and Ofelia's task. It skillfully shows revolution and the reason of failure;Avarice . And how avarice leads a revolution to blind destruction and bloodshed. 3 key hole symbolize three dominant left idelogiy during the war (Socialism, Anarchism and Communism)

It is not a light hearted family movie that children can enjoy. I've read several reviews that written by parents complaing the terrible denouement of watching this movie with kids!",1221436800,,2276,5.091152815013404

Although there are many sweet and innocent parts in this film, overall, it appears cruel, sad and jarring, which is different than most fantasy type films. The power of the child's imagination is juxtaposed very effectively against her ultimate defeat in the end, but the metaphor of her death and the rejoining of her parents resonates with many fantasies we have with the afterlife experiences in many culture. This film does an excellent job of blending several genres together. Visually the film is startlingly beautiful, the PQ is absolutely amazing on the HD DVD.

Maybe a couple terrifying scenes, swears in Spanish and some gore, but this movie still should be rented or even bought.",1221264000,,373,4.5
7625906,5,B002BYYA9A,"It's taken me some time to actually get around to seeing this film.  I've wanted to for a while now but haven't had the opportunity.  The other night I found the opportunity and took advantage of it; thankfully.  Now that I have finally seen this film (often rendered a masterpiece) I feel slightly more complete now.  No, `El Laberinto del Fauno' is not the most amazing film to have ever been released, but it does deserve a lot of the praise it has received for it is truly an astonishing work of art that is honest, personal and rich with humanity.

I'm going to go ahead and yell SPOILERS right now so that no one can yell at me later for ruining the movie for them.  I often try to stay away from any plot points that `give away too much' but for me to commit to writing a review about this amazing film without touching upon the fundamental reasoning for my five stars would be a waste of time for me.  So; if you have seen this movie then by all means continue reading but if you have not consider yourself warned, for I am going to discuss the ending.

The film follows a young girl named Ofelia.  Her mother is heavy with child and recently married to an army captain in Spain, circa 1944.  Ofelia possesses a quiet maturity that doesn't always serve her best interest, especially when relating to her new step-father Vidal.  Vidal is cruel and indifferent and repels Ofelia to the point where she finds herself immersed in a world not unlike the one she lives in yet with a magical new meaning.  Approached by the illusive Faun, Ofelia is given an opportunity to live forever if she completes three tasks, tasks that prove to be more tempting and dangerous than she expected.  The events taking place within Ofelia's new world (the labyrinth) parallel those taking place in the real world as her family life comes crashing to a turbulent end.

With all its talk of immortality I found that the films primary focus was that of death.  When all is said and done Ofelia receives her reward in her own demise, finally leaving the violent world that has enslaved her to fear and being whisked away to a world anew (inside the afterlife) with her mother and father.  This to me is what makes the film so brilliant, for it wasn't until the films end where the pieces came together and the elaborate story became so much richer and rewarding.

My only complaint about the film is that the dark and mysterious world of Pan's Labyrinth is no where near as engrossing as the real world in which Ofelia lives.  I really wanted del Toro's visionary world to be more intriguing but I found my interest fully invested in the real world surrounding Ofelia's fantasy.  That is really my only complaint, and it is a small one at that, for the film is never boring or uninteresting, I just expected my interest to be invested in another facet of the film.

The acting is superb on all fronts, especially with regard to Ivana Baquero who delivers what may be the most richly fulfilling child performance in recent memory.  She captures the unbridled curiosity of a child while balancing her characters unfathomable maturity.  She delivers a splendid performance filled with honest emotion and believable innocence.  Sergi Lopez is flawlessly ruthless as Captain Vidal, a performance that is memorable in its brutality.  Maribel Verdu is also memorable, and I don't normally like her (at least I haven't taken to her as others have).  Doug Jones also deserves some recognition for his dynamic undertaking as both the Faun and the Pale Man.  He truly gets under the skin of these two creatures, bringing the brilliant costume and makeup work to life before our very eyes.  Ariadna Gil is effective as Ofelia's mother, but the other performances overshadow her for the most part.

In the end I must say that `El Laberinto del Fauno' moved me.  It managed to reach into the pit of me and draw out raw emotion and contemplation I feel more complete now that I've released.  There is beauty within the tragedy of this story, a beauty that helps answer the questions we often ponder about life, death and the here-in-between.",1221004800,,4109,4.612104539202201
7625907,5,B002BYYA9A,"The third great film given us by a young Mexican director in 2006 (along with ""Babel"" and ""Children of Men""), and probably the one most inclined to future classic status, is Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (""El Laberinto del Fauno"").

This is a beautiful and horrific adult fantasy about a little girl named Ofelia in Franco's fascist Spain of the 1940's, and it cleverly layers the little girl's fantasy world of insect-fairies, fauns and monsters within a stone labyrinth onto the brutal real-life post-Spanish Civil War world where cruelty and willful violence make life intolerable.

These two worlds (presented equally as real) are used by the filmmaker to convey the trauma of war through the inner and outer eyes of the little girl. The story, telling of the heroine's missing (murdered) father and ineffectual mother marrying again to an evil Capitan Vidal (a stepfather threatening to replace the girl's father-image), is a treasure-trove of Freudian symbolism utilizing true Grimm Brothers' stark violence to convey the rite-of-passage ritual through adolescence and the death of innocence. This is truly filmmaking at its highest level, a sort of amalgamation of ""Alice in Wonderland"" with a David Cronenberg horror film as if filtered through Andrei Tarkovsky, including pitch-perfect performances from the famous Sergei Lopez as the arch-fascist Capitan Vidal to the wonderful Ivana Banquero as the lonely and sad Ofelia.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a follow-up to del Toro's 2001 film, ""The Devil's Backbone"", which also placed a young child and a fantasy element into the world of post-civil war Spain, but this time del Toro did it with perfection, making both a quintessential end-of-childhood elegy and a fairy tale about salvation.

7625911,1,B002BYYA9A,"This film is a shallow political melodrama full of stock one-dimensional characters dressed up with special effects and lots of pointless violence carried out by evil ""men"" against women and children. I get the impression that the director wanted to make an expensive heavy-handed ""message"" picture on the spanish civil war and figured out that the way to get it made was to repackage it as a ""fantasy"" picture.

As a fantasy picture, it fails for two important reasons. The first is that it is loaded up with postmodernist contempt for the whole idea of fantasy: its for the stupid, the mad or for small children. All the fantasy elements in the film are dismissed in the end as the mad self-destructive delusions of a doomed child. The second reason is that when the fantasy genre is mixed with heavy-handed real-world politics, it never works.

The film's view of the spanish civil war is overtly political and childish. Its less sophisticated and more melodramatic than star wars. Darth General and his faceless stormtroopers face off against the brave rebel alliance which though it is weak always wins. The richness of the spanish civil war in a dramatic sense is its ambiguity as reflected in author's like Orwell. There is none of that here. Nobody among the brave rebels questions why they are continuing to fight a war that was lost six years previous. Nobody ever considers the effect of the war on civlians caught in the middle. The army is full of ""evil"" man-monsters who kill the ""good"" women and children. The rebels outnumber the army, beat it at every turn, have sophisticated base complexes and are supported by everyone. The question left unanswered is why the all-powerful rebellion is on the losing side.

The violence is totally over the top. There are amputations, bloody pregnancies, death in childbirth, images of child sacrifice, torture, mutiliation, knifings and execution-style shootings.

I watched this film because of all the talk, awards and recommendations. But there is nothing about it that really recommends it.

7625913,5,B002BYYA9A,"Everybody's seen it. There are 650 reviews already. I don't need to recount the plot, do I?

My take on this film is colored by my years of visiting and living in Spain, from the first time in 1965 until spring of 2007. The content of a film is what the viewer thinks when she/he watches it. I thought of Franco and of Franco's special church-haunted fascism. Does Franco rhyme with macho? Close enough. Franquismo was about masculine honor, including the very masculine honor of God the Father as conceived by the Franquistas. I carry a fairly passionate hatred for Franquismo in my conscience, as passionate as that of most Spaniards today. That emotion certainly colored my experience of Pan's Labyrinth.

It's a film about the cost of heroism in terms of humanism. The two women characters are heroic in their loyalties and in their acceptance of suffering. The Communist guerillas are heroic in their stubborn and futile resistance to tyranny and brutality, but they are mere stock figures, scarcely individuals, scarcely at risk of self-doubt, mor eprops than characters. The doctor is a reluctant but unwavering hero, but he's a minor character. That leaves the girl Ofelia and the sadistic beast of fascist officer, Captain Vidal. The girl fantasizes heroism, and her fantasy is a story of its own. But the Captain is a flesh-and-blood human, the very worst exemplar of humanity at its most inhumane. Sergi Lopez is the star of this film, in my eyes, the masterfully acted embodiment of fascism in all its hatefulness. His concept of heroic honor, of the ""real man's"" heroic death, is the backdrop for every other character's actions, including the girl's fantasies. You out there in the audience? You want to understand fascism? Study Captain Vidal.",1217203200,35,1758,4.95593220338983

The fantasy world that the main character seeks refuge in, is no lighter or kinder than the dark, brutal reality that surrounds her. Apart from the final somewhat-uplifting finale, the movie is incredibly dark and depressing. And yet, there's a unique sort of beauty to it that will leave your heart aching. There's little that can be said about it without giving much away, so just go ahead and rent it... It's unique, insanely creative, poignant, haunting, fantastically acted and stunningly directed.

Story is predominently built on the extreme contrast between how innocent a child can be versus how incredibly evil a man can be: Good versus Evil set in the battlefields of the Spanish Civil War and in the imagination of a little girl (and how the little girl tries to use that imagination to escape the cold realities of the world).  Excellent performances by actors in all featured roles.  It's the kind of movie you'll want to see at least twice...and this even though it's subtitled (though the story is so strong that the subtitles don't distract that badly).

Regardless, this film did get made and has found a relatively wide audience here in the U.S...I do not consider myself desensitized to violence or gore and am not a fan of films like SAW, etc., so it shocked me when some reviewers here said they could not take the violence in this film and found it over the top...Anyone remember the REAL story of Red Riding Hood??

7625918,4,B002BYYA9A,"This is a superb film from director Guillermo del Toro. Set in 1944 when a last band of rebels are still holding out after the Spanish Civil war has long since finished. Ofelia is a young girl who brought by her mother to see her stepfather a Captain in the army with a sadistic streak. He is leading the fight against the rebels.

All this is interesting and mapped out from the start. However within a short space of time the film takes a huge turn into the world of fantasy. Ofelia is taken by a fairy to a fantasy world under the maze of the films title. On a simple level this is just a young girls escape from the nightmare happening around her, and if you just accept it as that you will still see a great movie.

However Toro uses the fantasy world as a chance to make a movie that works on another level. There are clear references to the holocaust in the film (piles of shoes for one) and the Captain/Stepfather is remarkably similiar to the camp commandant in Schindlers List, both because of his brutal actions, and even visually Toro has picked an actor who looks like Ralph Fiennes. This may be pure coincidence...

This isn't a film I could recommend for small children. Firstly it has some quite unpleasant violence, which in context is completly justified. Secondly some of the imagery is a little too disturbing for youngsters in my view. But at the right age (and I wouldn't like to say what age that should be) its a film for everyone.

Unlike many Hollywood films this resolved without the need for tons of overt sentimentality, people cheering etc. Indeed I thought the ending got the balance just about right.

I'm a great fantasy fan and after seeing the trailers I decided to go see  this movie, not really expecting anything special; to say I was stunned by the unique story, the acting and the cinematography would be a gross understatement.

The story take place in a rural, mountainous area of Spain during the Spanish Civil war in the 1930's or 40's. Part of the tale is about the civil war but there is another more 'magical' conflict going on at the same time, hidden deep beneath the earth's surface; as you might imagine the two tales become intertwined as the story progresses.

Be forewarned, this is not a movie for children or the faint of heart. There are some scenes containing unspeakable cruelty and this will, without doubt, be a major turnoff to some. However, I found the violence within the context of the story and the era involved. (unlike some other movies where the violence seems to be gratuitous and is often there only for shock effect.

Pan's Labyrinth is a foreign film with subtitles; I remember people complaining about this before and after the show. To me the subtitles enhanced the special effects of this movie; it added to the realism of the geographic area where the story took place. After 5 minutes, the subtitles went virtually unnoticed because the story was so enthralling and the acting so good.

Conclusion;
One of my favorite movies; a true gem.
However, not all movie buffs will like this movie because of the fantasy component and the graphic scenes. But in my opinion it easily rates 5 Stars...more if I could.

7625929,4,B002BYYA9A,"I watched this movie shortly after it was released on DVD.  I had heard mixed opinions from friends of mine, as well as reviews online.  I have to say, I was prepared for something completely different.

For one, this is NOT a family friendly movie - especially if you have young children.  It is dark and can be quite violent.  I have no idea why this movie was marketed the way it was; as a family fantasy movie.  Despite some of the comments on Amazon, it is creative and imaginative, though it is not comparable to films like Lord of the Rings... nor does it try to be.  Therefore I am confused by the comparison.  I'd only assume that some people think that - in order to be a fantasy movie - it must be filled to the brim with elves and swordplay.

Again, it is dark.  If you are a parent and feel uneasy due to the reviews on this website, I suggest that you rent it first.

Overall, I did enjoy this movie. It is interesting, imaginative, beautiful, and tragic.  Do not go into it thinking that this is a typical fantasy movie or you will be disappointed, though I'd still consider it a fantasy film.

I gave the movie 4 stars because I felt the ending was a bit anticlimactic.  As an aside, please try and avoid the reviews that put an emphasis on political leanings.  This is not a political film.  It is a film that revolves around the life of a little girl and her family during the Spanish civil war.  Then again, if you really wish to find a specific hidden meaning in any form of media, you will find a way to rationalize said meaning into existence.",1213574400,,1565,4.2687074829931975

This is a fairy tale, but not really intended with children with some overwhelming sadness and brutal violence that drives the dark psychological fable that this really is.

I would not let my child watch this film when they were too young, but high school age I could see as appropriate.

With stunning visuals and one of the creepiest movie creatures that I have ever seen with the ""baby eater"", this is hands down Guillermo Del Toro's most amazing work to date as well as a melancholy story that dives deep into the ideas of escapism and fantasy which will make you weep in the end if you have any human emotion.

I loved the concept of the movie but there was too much gore for me. If you have a weak stomach or you're easily queasy, then stay far away from this movie. I had nightmares for months after watching this movie. Not because of the mythical creatures or how weird they looked but because of the killing in the movie. The step-father is brutal and evil. The way he and his army were killing people and torturing them was utterly repulsive. There was one scene where 2 farmers, father and son, were caught because they were thought to have been stealing in the field. And the way the son was killed, by having his face bashed in with the [...] of a hammer or flashlight, then shot, was just horrible. That scene played over and over in my mind and nightmares.

When I bought this one, I didn't realize the dialog was in Spanish. I first thought, ""Oh, no,"" when I realized I was going to have to watch it with English subtitles. I'm not very tolerant of subtitled movies, but I was hooked within fifteen minutes. I forgot that I was reading the dialog while hearing it in Spanish.

The acting was excellent, the cinematograpy was excellent, and the story itself was compelling and seductive. No, there aren't a lot of what most horror/sci-fi fans would consider ""special effects,"" but fans of fantasy tend to be different, able to create their own world during a good fantasy movie. I'm a fan of all three.

This movie touched on so many subjects--the belief of children in the ""impossible,"" the lack of caring and the cruelty in the world, the rewards after working toward a goal and achieving it, and the value of self-sacrifice. I could go on and on.

That being said, this is NOT a movie for children even though a child is the protagonist. Although it's not a horror movie, it could be very frightening to children younger than ~13. There are a lot of horrifying aspects that could be disturbing to young children, and most younger children won't understand the psychological undertones of the film.

7625941,5,B002BYYA9A,"Director Guillermo del Toro's film Pan's Labyrinth (as it is called in the U.S.) is more than just another fantasy film. It's a thematically complex fairy tale for adults. And it may be the most profound and personal film of the Mexican director's career.

The story is set in 1944, in Spain where the fascists still hold sway over the people. Amidst this turmoil a young girl and her pregnant mother are leaving behind their home, their former lives and going to live with the mother's new husband, the fascist El Capitan. The girl finds that she can only survive through the use of her imagination, but the fairy tale world to which she escapes turn out to be more real than the world in which she is trapped. She stumbles onto an ancient ruinous labyrinth and in its center is a pit that serves as a doorway between the ""real"" world and the ""fantasy"" world. Living deep within this pit is the faun, an ambiguous and immortal creature. He tells the girl that she is a princess and a goddess, that she does not belong to our cruel and violent world, and that if she is to return her own she must first complete three extraordinary tasks. Meanwhile her mother suffers from complications of her pregnancy, and the Captain's command is under threat by the Socialist resistance, whose band is camped in the surrounding forests. Soon all of these elements collide and destinies are revealed.

Guillermo's film is easily the most visually spectacular film of 2006 and is rich in detail. He brilliantly uses the screen as a painter would use a canvas and every color that he chooses has particular meaning, every shadow hides within it a mystery, and every light serves as beacon for hope. The visual effects and the cinematography are amazing. The world of magic is vividly brought to life in gold, red, yellow and orange. The other world, our world, is disturbingly cold in black, gray, blue and green. But as the two worlds affect each other the color palettes begin to mix. As director he also references other works of fantasy, both in literature and in film, and uses thematic components of countless fairy tales. The film could almost be seen as one part Anne Frank and one part Alice in Wonderland. The themes that are dealt with are truly universal: the importance of innocence, the power of sacrifice, the perils of ambition, the corrupting qualities of obsession, betrayal and doubt, but most prominently transcendence through selflessness. The characters are simple archetypes but the performances are complex and multi-faceted. The story is timeless, a truly modern fairy tale.
Although a fairy tale it's definitely not for children. It deals with the darker aspects of humanity and the loss of childhood innocence. There are numerous scenes of graphic violence and most of the fantastical creatures would give children nightmares. It's quite obvious that this film is for adults once you've seen a man's face crushed with a bottle. This is an R-rated fantasy film; it's not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B000W4B8NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>&nbsp;or even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>.

7625942,5,B002BYYA9A,"If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" (""El Laberinto del Fauno"") is a sequel of sorts to ""The Devil's Backbone,"" a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War. But this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting -- in short, a triumph.

Time and place: 1944, Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi Lpez). Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.

To do so, he tells her that she must do three things, and gives her a strange book. Ofelia menages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. Even worse, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever... and being offered a terrible choice if she wants to get in.

Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares. But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones for adults, that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes ""Pan's Labyrinth"" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt.

Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style and brilliant visuals. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape.

At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the ""real world"" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow. But Del Toro's biggest triumph is an ending that is beautifully bittersweet, and which turns out to hinge on Ofelia's newborn brother.

But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere ""safe."" Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond. And Lpez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.

Half ""Mirrormask"" and half gritty war story, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the best fantasy stories in years -- dark, passionate and beautifully made. Definitely a great movie.",1210204800,,2897,4.756972111553785

7625946,5,B002BYYA9A,"this movie is a masterpiece! quite honestly i don't know how anyone could watch it and not get sucked in. this movie was told with the air of a classic fairy tale, the real ones, not the watered down versions we give our children today. there is an atmosphere of danger and suspense that constantly surrounds the girl, and in response to that there is a persistent arousal of hope, or fantasy. the girl's environment is not the best, to say the least. she is in some camp under the jurisdiction of some heartless man who has married her mother, and who only cares about producing an heir. everything around her is militaristic and hard and cold, and yet she continuously bumps into this other world of wonder and mystery, of fairies and fauns and the like. it's like the metaphor of the flower that grows out of concrete. finding the extraordinary in the ordinary.
it's debatable whether she is actually interacting with this other world and that it exists, or if she's creating this world to escape her less than ideal reality. i suppose your answer would come from what kind of person you are and how you perceive the world. i enjoy the experience of believing it is real with a constant skeptic in the back of my mind nay saying everything the believer says, so i guess my view would change depending on what day you chanced upon asking me. the bottom line is that story is very well put together and whether or not you believe the world the girl is interacting with to be real, you'll enjoy it either way.

a common criticism i hear circling this movie is that it isn't for children. to these people, i don't really know what to say. i'm not sure how it was advertised to you, but from the advertisements i saw i was well aware that the movie was rated R and was a 'fairy tale for grown ups', so to speak. i did still take my younger sibling, but that's something else. if a parent or guardian is not willing to take the time to research a movie or heed the ratings, they shouldn't be allowed to complain about what their children see, as this unwanted event could have been prevented with a little effort on their part.

this movie is wonderful. i tear up at the end every time. for me it really stands out as a work of art against the back drop of the standard of movies we have come to expect will be playing in theaters every friday night. i'd even go so far as to say that it's a classic in it's own time, or is at least something to be aware of. but it's definitely awesome.",1209513600,,2484,4.328326180257511

I really don't get all the gushing admiration for this movie. The bad guy is cartoonishly bad, and any chance of getting drawn in to the fantasy is undercut at every turn by the nauseatingly graphic and brutal violence. I don't generally shy away from intense movies. I enjoy ""Saving Private Ryan,"" even with all of its blood and gore in the opening Normandy Beach scene. The intensity there serves a purpose. It drives home the brutality of war, the courage of the soliders, and the amazing sacrifices those soldiers made. In ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" the cartoon bad guy beats a man's face in -- and you get to see every blow, in detail -- apparently to remind you that he's a really, really Bad Man. I didn't need shockingly gratuitous violence to know that. I felt like the director was beating me over the head to prove a point, just as much as our cartoon Bad Man was beating the innocent man's face in.

My wife and I barely made it through the scene of the toad vomiting itself to death. We finally made it as far as the girl's second task. But when the eyeless creature bites the heads off two of the fairies, we couldn't stomach it anymore.

During the Spanish Civil War a young girl is taken with her pregnant mother to a compound at the foothills of mountains where rebel forces are hiding out and trying to penetrate Franco's army.

The girl is aware that this new world she had no choice in inhabiting is filled with violence and inhumanity. Consequently she finds herself in a alternate world with fairies, a giant toad, and a faun who is either a trustful guide or maybe a villian. Not for young children, this movie is an emotional powerhouse about what lengths a child will go through to hold on to innocence. The perfomances are great.

But do not think because it mentions fairy tales and fairies and magic that it is appropriate for younger children.  The storytelling was clear even though it was nontraditional, so even when it was a little surreal, as a viewer I mostly knew what was going on.",1207872000,3,925,4.461538461538462
7625954,1,B002BYYA9A,"This movie is as stupid as they come. Even though young children and shallow adults will be seduced by its special effects, there is really nothing more to it than that. It has absolutely none of the charm, depth or intelligence of the fantasy classics- like Lord of the Rings or Narnia- with which it has been outrageously compared.  This is cheap, formulaic, plastic fantasy. Where traditional fairy tales often symbolically explored and confronted universal life passages and difficult psychological conflicts, this is merely a politically correct mishmash of every hackneyed motif of modernist fantasy, representing nothing coherent and being nothing more than one cynical man's (successful) attempt to dazzle the easily-impressed masses with exotic monsters and magical FX creatures. If Del Toro admitted he was only making a video game, that would be fine. Instead, he bloviated this movie into a ""parable"", an ""allegory"", a fairy tale that would take its place among the works of Tolkien and Lewis. Please. This mess is to fantasy as Ratatouille is to quality children's animation.

In the first place, its mythology is superficial and nauseatingly modernist. Its protagonist will be familiar to anyone who has seen any of Disney's feminist propaganda made since the late 80s's. She's a preternaturally gifted and sensitive young girl with an oppressive, conservative father figure who cramps her style. Whether in ""reality"" or imagination it is unknown, but our heroine is discovered to be an otherworldly princess and is assigned by the fairies to perform a set of utterly senseless magical errands which- appropriately enough for a little girl's fantasy world- take place in and about her own home and involve no inherent risk. No traditional heroic quest in this story. (Isn't it creepy that a 40-something year old man wrote this story?) Her tasks reminded me of those video role-playing games for 10 year olds which tell you step-by-step how to win the game. The usual fairy tale symbols are here: a key, a door, a toad, a faun, a labyrinth, etc. but they don't seem to actually be included for any reason except their ""mystical"" associations. All of these objects and creatures were included for nothing more than to decorate a DVD case or populate a marketing campaign. There is no deeper meaning behind anything here.

The only really comprehensible message in the movie is its despicable left-wing propaganda. It demonizes the Spanish nationalists who won the Civil War and obsequiously romanticizes their Anarchist and Communist enemies as the apotheosis of nobility. Since this movie is supposed to be a fantasy, I guess we're supposed to overlook the fact that our heroes' actual historical activities usually consisted of raping nuns and slaughtering anyone with a bank account or a crucifix. Actually, the majority of the movie seemed to focus on the political situation, with very gory mutilations, torture, executions and amputations liberally depicted. I guess del Toro had to add some fairies and sci-fi to his slanderous, left-wing agitprop to make it palatable to an international audience. Just make no mistake that this movie is primarily a fairy tale or is suitable for young children. It's just Communist propaganda wrapped in a confused and ugly imitation of a fairy tale.",1207872000,21,3305,5.173831775700934

7625956,5,B002BYYA9A,"I found myself hoping and hoping that Ofilia would make it through.  For those who hate this movie or have nothing positive to say...you should have done the responsible thing BEFORE watching this film and done some READING on the material contained.  I am a mother and I read about every movie before I watch it because I know that nowadays you have to be careful of what you turn on.  With that said...I am glad this movie was not a 'happy ending' kind of a movie...whether it was potically correct or not...the truth is, it could have been any war...any time...that WAS the reality of war and war is not pretty.  I honestly think people who rented this movie with expectations of it being some fantasy feel good movie should have done the reading beforehand....  I interpreted this movie and the fantasy element as lifelines to Ofelia...missed opportunities to make it out of alive, but the sad reality is that MANY children DON'T make it out alive in war situations.  I cried in the end...but, I really loved how even in her small mind...she was reunited with her parents in the end.  I simply love movies like this...it is not 1,2,3...here is the story line...enjoy and have a fuzzy warm feeling afterwards...it is a movie that makes you think...and leaves you wondering...'what would I have if I were in that situation'?  What we would do to escape the reality we live in?  Could any of us have been as brave as Ofelia?  As Mercedes?  I think movies that leave you wondering and questioning your own lifelihood are the ones that are the most profound.  This movie did that for me.",1207699200,2,1586,4.604982206405694
7625957,4,B002BYYA9A,"I will start by saying that, technically, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the best films that I have seen in a long time. Set during the Spanish Civil War, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" tells two stories, one of the fight between the Fascists and the rebels at the end of the war, and a fairy tale centred around the painfully lonely step-daughter of a Fascist army captain. The production values of this film are very high, evidently much effort has been put into making the historical elements of this story as realistic as possible, and I was very impressed by the way in which the director interwove the fantasy elements with historical facts. There is no doubt in my mind that this film deserves the swag of awards that it won. However, after marvelling at the technical brilliance of this film, I did find myself wondering about the message that it was trying to send.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a very dark movie, both with respect to lighting and plot. Although the main character, Ofelia, is a child, this film is very violent and probably shouldn't be shown to young children. Captain Vidal, Ofelia's step-father, is a sadistic man who is shown torturing his enemies on several occasions. That aside, however, I found the whole film to be lacking in hope. As a child, Ofelia has no choice in where she lives and throughout the film, Ofelia is shown on numerous occasions to have little choice in what she does. All of the adults around her either want to harm her or use her. No one really seems to care about her well-being at all in either this world or Ofelia's fantasy world. Even the historical fact that the Fascists did win the Spanish Civil War, adds to the general hopelessness of this film. I just don't understand why the writer/director decided to make a film that is this bleak. In a way, I see this film as being ""Don Juan DeMarco""'s dark counterpart. Both films deal with people moving in to a fantasy world to escape an unpleasant reality (or are these fantasy world's real?), but whereas ""Don Juan DeMarco"" uplifts the audience, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" doesn't.

Nevertheless, I am glad I have seen this film. As an aspiring writer, I feel that there is much that can be learnt from this film, with regard to how to write a very good story, and up until the end, I did enjoy the film. I just wouldn't recommend this film to someone who needed cheering up.",1207612800,2,2355,4.578199052132701

7625960,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is a beautifully made film.  It is also a very disturbing and violent fairytale.  Think back to the original dark Grimm fairytales that give children nightmares (NOT the prettied up Disney versions), and you will be getting close.

This movie is an adult fantasy, and absolutely not recommended for children under 18.  It is extremely intense, quite violent, and deals with very mature topics: death, war, poverty, fascism, and human brutality.  Conversely, this film also takes us into a fantasy world that helps a small child escape from her horrific reality.  This bizarre combination ignites the viewer's imagination. It is emotionally gripping; we become wholly invested in this young girl's tragic life.

This unusual story is filled with some remarkable acting.  The cinematography is graphic and stunning.  The film has an almost dream-like quality to it, which serves to enhance the brutality of the ""real world"" scenes.  We ache to see this girl escape - to be safe - yet, we know that she cannot.  At least not in the real world.  But, just perhaps we hope, the fantasy world can help her.

Although very disturbing, Pan's Labyrinth is an amazing and unexpected triumph.  I give it my highest recommendation.",1207440000,,1235,5.0495049504950495

Ofelia, lost in a world of make-believe and fairies, has recently lost her tailor father and her mother has remarried to give the captain an heir and to save herself in the midst of revolution at world wars. Ofelia rebels against the world as it is and slips into a fantasy world that the viewer never rectifies. She is supposedly the underworld's princess and lost daughter of the King of the Underworld. She is told all of this by Pan (played phenomenally by Doug Jones who you will later see as the Silver Surfer in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer) who also plays Pale Man --both of whom are the most cinematic characters in the tale.

7625967,4,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is an excellent movie from Guillermo Del Toro. The visuals and storytelling really are amazing. I won't go into too many details as there are plenty of movie reviews out on the subject.

What I do want to touch on is the picture quality, which should be of importance for any Blu-Ray title. Reviews about the quality are mixed, mainly due to the supposed heavy use of DNR (dynamic noise reduction) on the film. This removes grain. Whether or not you appreciate grain in films (I love it as it gives the movie that ""cinematic"" quality) or hate it (some people feel it ruins the ""clean"" look of hidef media) this movie has been scrubbed. On the good side, it makes a very clean picture. On the bad side is that you lose some facial detail in closeups and skin can have a ""plastic"" look to it.

All in all I didn't feel it hurt the quality much at all. The Blu-Ray is definitely head and shoulders above upconverted DVD. It's not the best quality BD I own, but it's definitely one of my favorite movies.

Simultaneously, the Fantasy aspects of this great film give us a window into Other Worlds, and give the little girl an escape from harsh reality.

Though I would not recommend this movie for most children (below the age of 11-13, depending upon their maturity), I certainly recommend this film for everyone else (especially adults).

7625969,2,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is a beautifully made film, but very dark and violent.

However, as a big fan of del Toro's ""Hellboy"" movie(s), the obvious slant of this movie in the way it portrays the Spanish Civil War had to be its most dismaying aspect.

After watching this movie, I did some reading about the history of Spain and the Spanish Civil War.

Spain, like many European countries once governed by powerful kings, had an extremely messy and anarchic transition to democracy that started in the 1800's and staggered along into the 1900's.  Many internal wars were fought, and lots of people were killed in the process. The once proud Spanish Empire came apart and all of Spain's colonies were lost by the mid 1800's (unlike England and France, which held on to them until WWII finally bankrupted the home countries). Regional and political differences emerged as the result of this anarchy that threatened to tear Spain apart as a country.

The Spanish Civil War was the ultimate conflict that resulted from this long series of internal struggles.  The Republicans vs. Nationalists war was a far more complex bloodletting than one can possibly get out of this movie.  Moviemakers seem to invariably side with the socialists, leftists, revolutionaries, or guerrillas in any conflict, and Guillermo del Toro has done the usual ""Hollywood"" or European Left treatment of the Spanish Civil War. Republicans = good, noble, simple country folk.  Nationalists = evil fascist killers.

In truth, the Republicans were an extremely complex group of liberal democratic centrists, socialists, communists, outright anarchists, anti-Catholic church haters, poor people, Basque and Catalonian nationalists/separatists, etc., etc. They spent as much of the Civil War fighting and killing each other as fighting the Nationalists.

During the Civil War, both sides routinely engaged in mass roundups and executions of anybody they did not like who had the misfortune of being caught in territory controlled by their side. Tens of thousands of people were executed by both sides in such fashion, and in all likelihood, the numbers of such executions were nearly equal on both sides.  For example, thousands of priests and nuns were murdered by forces allied with the Republican side because the Catholic Church was allied with the Nationalist side.  That part I found fascinating, and is something that is virtually ignored in almost all re-tellings of the Spanish Civil War.

Now, for sure, once Franco and the Nationalists won, and started consolidating power, they rounded up and executed far more people. This movie does take place during that period of time, in 1944, when Franco was being threatened by a resurgence in the remaining Republican forces, since Nazi Germany, an ally of the Nationalists, was in the process of being defeated.

And so if you were to just judge the whole conflict by looking at the scorecard for executed people, yep, Franco and the Nationalists sure do look far worse and more evil. But would the Republican side have done anything different, had they won? Their record for executions during the Civil War suggests that they would probably have done exactly the same thing afterwards to consolidate power. Remember Lenin, Mao, etc.? They led revolutions against corrupt, repressive regimes and were initially glamorized by the West, and then ended up murdering even more of their countrymen than the original regimes ever did. Had the communists (one of the main Republican factions) taken control, their history in Russia and China suggests that they would have committed far more mass killings than Franco.

So many books, and movies, Hemingway, etc. have been made that have romanticized the lost cause of the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War that all of this real history is what gets lost.",1206230400,7,3815,5.130645161290323

7625972,5,B002BYYA9A,"It's really hard to put the words ""evil"" and ""beautiful"" into the same statement.  That just usually doesn't work.

But, the connection of evil to beauty in this film is impossibly great.  Now, if you've never seen this film do not for a second think that I'm claiming that evil is beautiful or that evil is shown to be beautiful herein.  Yet, I am stating that beauty and evil coexist in this story without mixing.  In most stories that work these two words into the same context you connect evil with the outer covering of beauty.  Such a stress does not exist in this film.

What does exist is a young girl's beautiful fantasy that takes her through the tragedies of real life in a real world that is anything but beautiful.  Evil resides in the nature of human conscience.  Beauty is found in that conscience as well, but rarely do evil and beauty live in the same conscience.  This little girl's breathtaking ride through reality is a trip into a fantastic dimension that allows her to find the justice of an eleven-year-old, if there is such a thing.

Now, to tone down a little.  If you've not seen this film, and you have kids under the age of 13, watch the film first before allowing them to watch it.  I make this recommendation because I believe the film is suitable for minors.  There are no sexual references within the film, but there is some serious violence.  I believe that the film is good for kids as young as eleven, though, because it really generates a great transposition of reality with imagination, and it causes moral thinking to occur.  However, the film is rated ""R"", so I make it clear that the film is made for adults.

I believe that what you get with Pan's Labyrinth is the beautiful voyage of a little girl through her own imagination while she rides through a world full of evil and darkness.  The culmination is hopeful and inspiring, and I'll probably watch this one again real soon.",1205971200,,1919,4.52906976744186

7625974,5,B002BYYA9A,"Away from the confusing battlefield of hundreds of customer's reviews concerning feelings and emotions in the New-line cinema edition for this phantasmagorical masterpiece, i would like to express both admiration and respect for Guillermo del Toro for this incredible achievement. The relief i felt after my first watch of this movie, was based on my lost hope to ever find a movie that could make my emotions and basic interests in filmaking, get back in track again in several ways at the same time. After all, look at the ""fantasy"" or the ""horror"" movie industry we're facing these days, or even the ""war drama"" movie industry if there's still any, look at the easy-accomplished style or commercial-digital products in filmaking, designed to warm seats in theaters and sell popcorn with mind bending publicity  based on mass hysteria about what's cool. That's why i totally respect people who didn't like this movie: How can someone leave behind or even pass by this ""black or white"" way of thinking, product of the hypnotic and extreme new cinema, designed for grabbing basic instincts and superficial emotions, throwing'em into a void of nothing?

Considering myself a respectable classic fan of good movies, you can't imagine the amount of rented DVDs and endless theater features i've lost myself into. Despite some great movies i even bought, my emotional viewer persona was dying. Even artistic short-films made me sick, and i was slowly becoming an easy entertainment junkie. Searching refugee in my old classic cinema masterpieces, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" found me. After ""Hellboy"", i already said goodbye to my beloved Guillermo Del Toro and his mexican-spanish works like ""Cronos"" and ""The devil's Backbone"", but this last work was so helpful and important for me, i will refer to him as a filmaker, trying to explain this phenomenon according to his ""double"" personality. Enough already about this movie, it's all been said.

-""HOLLYWOOD"" DEL TORO: After the succes of his second production, the critical aclaimed awarded ""cronos"", Del Toro made his debut in Hollywood with ""Mimic"", a regular but very creepy and original monster film. He made the best of the ""Blade"" sequels, along with one of the best comic book adaptations, ""Hellboy"". He still is all about horror, graphic and deep-feeling horror as well. But these movies only show a great talented director, but not the real filmaker.
  CONSEQUENCES: Fans of ""Hollywood"" del Toro found his spanish productions boring, dramatic, absurd, confusing long and dull. Not enough action, not enough horror imagery, not what they expect from the master they know. Dissapointed, they still love him and expect more.

-""FILMAKER"" DEL TORO: The real artist emerges in his spanish productions, no doubt about it. He manages to create a masterful, original and extense balance between gruesome horror, tear jerking drama, and spanish culture. His characters are extreme in their roles like the old times, with no moral struggles, redemption issues or search for justice, at all: they are essential, pure, and charismatic. He works with children for the purety and inocence of ""Good"", and with egomaniac psychopatic villans for the ""Evil"". Adults, no matter wich side they choose or their intentions, represent the cruel and unavoidable reality of the world. The intense, visceral Drama is based on Pain and Injustice inflicted on the week, and the will to survive in a demented, ilogical world. The fantasy is the way in wich Del Toro expresses is horror fan persona, and he loves horror imagery, conceptual and graphic in both ways with the same passion. He looks for simple and symbolic scenarios in order to achieve identity and purity, not to disturb character development. Long, complicated takes and  great use of the camera. So what makes him a genious: BALANCE, pure explicit but simple balance. No specific theme or genre is the real backup or background for the other. Bravo Guillermo, like the old days.
  CONSEQUENCES: Some real serious film critics or fans are atracted to Del Toro's artistic side, just to discover some of the must disgusting scenes they never hope to watch, therefore they don't think necesary, too over the top. More disapointment, from a different side.

I think i loved it because of my background in movies: Horror, drama, western, comedy, war movies, cult films, science fiction, etc. Could it be because i'm open to all genres with the same passion and therefore prepared, or just because i love to enjoy a good movie as anyboby?

By the way, this edition i just bought in a local store from an importing order is just spanish all the way. The best region 1 is still the New line 2 disc edition DVD set. Highly recomended, that edition contains all the production works, extra material and interviews that may exist, Guillermo del Toro likes to share every single aspect of his work.

7625981,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is one of the most beautiful, achingly meaningful films in a very, very long time. Combining fantasy that winds its way like fingers of fog through very real circumstances, it is simply something that must be, as you would a painting at the Louvre, seen and witnessed. Some movies try so hard to be meaningful and beautiful; this film effortlessly does so. Even the mystical creatures seem real or at least possible in the world Guillermo del Toro has created for us; certainly the so-called real world in which our humble protagonist lives in might be viewed (fascist Spain) as just as unbelievable. So where do we draw the line between fantasy and reality? It is a difficult thing to do when one considers the fantastic horrors committed in the name of fascist Spain and, of course in contemporaneous (e.g., 1940s) Germany where so many died simply because they were who they were. Fantasy? Maybe. Maybe not. But this film weaves reality and fantasy into a world in which, perhaps, we might want not to live in. But did. I cannot recommend this film more highly. 6 stars.",1204243200,,1089,4.7368421052631575

7625983,4,B002BYYA9A,"You know you just have to watch a movie when you're absolutely enthralled by the cover. Don't judge a DVD by its cover? This is one of those covers that makes you wonder what the film is about. Not one of those photoshopped romantic comedies. *cough* I don't own any of those of course.

Set in 1944 Spain, Ofelia (what a gorgeous name) and her mother are moving to be with her new stepfather, a man who is no care in the world whatsoever, he wants a son to carry on the family name, and doesn't care for his new stepdaughter. He shows it as soon as his new family arrives. His new wife is heavily pregnant and suffering, and Ofelia instantly spots what she calls a fairy and chases after it.

She comes across the Labyrinth of Fauno, where the fairy leads her, turning into a green goblin creature, which speaks like Tinkerbell. She meets Fauno inside, who's hiding from the rest of the world, and is a mix of so many different animals, it's hard to describe. She then discovers she's actually a princess, and the princess's soul has been brought back through her. But she has to complete three challenges, in order to see if she belongs with the mortals or not.

Outside the labyrinth, the rebels are attacking, and Ofelia's stepfather is trying to discover who the link to the rebels is in his house. The mother is still suffering with the baby boy inside her. Ofelia is desperate to stay and help her mother, but also desperate discover the whole new world that is awaiting her.

She meets a new interesting characters along the way, including Pale Man, a strange looking creature, with no eyes in his (its?) face, but in the palms of his hands instead. You've seen the stills from the movie, the mad creature who puts his hands up to his face in order to see. Nightmares, hello! He appears in an almost Adam & Eve-esque scenario. Very interesting, and chases Ofelia.

From the same director who did Hellboy, the magic is here, which was touched upon in Hellboy. The scenes are well done, and really stunning, all the little faun symbols you can't help but notice throughout the film. It at times reminded me of my own childhood fairytales, Narnia and Alice for example, but so much more darker. Actually Guillermo Del Toro needs to direct a Narnia movie, that would be amazing!!! He could make the films so good. He shows what he can do in Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy. At times, the movie can be almost dreamlike, and the 118 minute running time flies by, and I was shocked when it was finished.

The score is amazing, particularly the lullaby theme, which appears frequently throughout the movie, and has been going through my head on and off since watching it.

If you've seen this DVD in a shop, and wondered what it was about, buy it. It's one of those magical movies that are one of a kind, and there will never be anything like it ever again. I have recommended it to a couple of people since seeing it, and will keep recommending it. It's more than words can say.",1203984000,,2975,4.477859778597786

7625985,5,B002BYYA9A,"A young girl named Ofelia (Baquero) living in Spain in 1944 during the Franco regime is taken by her pregnant mother (Gil) to live with her Fascist Franco loyalist and commander stepfather (Lpez) in a remote part of central Spain. Her life becomes more interesting when upon she encounters a faun (Doug Jones) who tells her she may be more important to the realm of another world.

My Review:

Director Guillermo Del Toro gives his final film of the trilogy that really mixes and mingles fantasy and brute horror to unconventional ways. With 'Cronos' and 'The Devil's Backbone' now in the bag, his focus shifts from Mexican vampires and ghost children in orphanages to mythical fantasy and brutal war time horror.

With the recent success of European directors conjuring up landmark films director Del Toro has come back and delivered a sophisticated piece to his earlier Spanish film, it really is his finest hour.

We get to focus on young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who is nothing short of well played introverted child who' life is change at the sudden appearance of a faun. Del Toro proves his direction with child actors is yet again undiminished, his continous efforts to weave great performances through younger generation actors that seem to have refined talent.

We need a baddy, and who is better than that of demented and paranoid dictator/stepfather Vidal (Sergi Lpez). His personality equally matched in his commitment of a neurotic approach to ending the rebellion/resistance, as if he were Darth Vader in 1940's Spain. But being the stepfather of Ofelia suggests that with his current regime he'd rather care about passing on his lineage to an unborn son and half-brother to Ofelia. And you though step-mothers were bad.

Supporting Ofelia and the tyranny of Vidal is maid Mercedes (Maribel Verd) whom is really known well enough for her impressive number of films in Spain. She supports Ofelia and her mother after a few distraught ordeals, however, never underestimate a lion is sheep's clothing, when given a chance so see what Mercedes can do with a knife.

The stunning taste of fate playing into effect as this seemingly young girl, who was assumed ordinary is now drawn into a bemused revelation of that she is to be a princess of a supernatural world. Del Toro plays with the actual and imaginary aspects of a child in a sense that they become blurred, is this actually real, or is it that her imaginings runaway with her? It's hard to guess, you'd rather not go for the latter even when she arrives at an old mill in cutoff Spanish woodland, clutching a parcel of books filled with fairy tales.

CGI delivers, it definitely delivers with magical sequences and real cringe-maker scenes. An adult tale dealing with the stuff of fantasy that is rooted in children.

Verdict:

You can never be too old for any fairytale. This one deserved the rare score: 10/10.",1203724800,,2879,4.869120654396728
7625986,5,B002BYYA9A,"This movie is a masterpiece. Not a single shot unneeded, not a single moment overdone. It is not a fairy tale in the escapist tradition Disney has so succintly mass produced. This is a story that will draw you in, spin you around, make you scared, elated, fascinated but never willing to stop seeing the next moment. Wonderfully shot and choreographed, just a master with an amazing tapestry.

The PR write-ups don't do it justice because it's not a tale of good vs evil; its a tale about good and evil. It's heart-breaking, awe-inspiring, and life affirming. It's everything you could imagine in a terrifying tale that involves a young, optomistic girl caught in disasterous circumstances by currents of events far beyond her comprehension.

There are several scenes of sudden violence that are so effective and so immediate, you cannot really prepare for them. I started wtaching this film accidentally because I wanted to load it on my iPod for an upcoming trip. I ended up watching the whole thing on the Mac AND still uploading it. For example, the encounter between the Capitaine and the rabbit hunters left me gaping with my mouth covered, still not believing what I had just seen. Thus, heed the R rating and don't let a child watch this.

It has images, amazing and scary, that will not leave your head for awhile.

7625987,3,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is quite different from what the trailer makes it out to be. Most of the film is occupied by a war theme while the fantasy remains somewhat back-story. It is also incredibly more violent than one might have expected.

The story revolves around a young girl who is living on a farm with her mother and stepfather in law from hell who commands a squadron that is under siege by a small band of rebel militia. The girl, torn between the domineering male parent and the war, discovers a world where a fawn asks her to complete a set of tasks so that she can inherit a magical kingdom.

While the film probably contains the most memorable bad guy of all time, it still comes across as deficient in its promise of beyond the imagination worlds. However they are done above par. Viewers can expect a war drama more than anything else. The film's underlying morals about questioning authority are worth learning; however they do conflict somewhat with its Christian underpinnings. Pan's Labyrinth is essentially C.S Lewis but is rendered in buckets of blood.",1203292800,2,1066,4.725806451612903

7625991,2,B002BYYA9A,"Alright, let's get a few things straight here: while this is a well crafted, ""dark"" (because folks love using that term interchangeably with ""deep"")better than average take on fantasy, this film by no means is the ""astounding"" piece of work people claim it to be.

Let's start with the historical inaccuracies. While I don't need dogmatic details, the films paints fantasy about Spain in more ways than one, namely that the rebels gain the upper-hand against the Fascists, when in reality the young girl ascending the throne of her underground kingdom might be a far more accurate account of the times. If Del Toro wanted to tell a story of hope and skew the details a bit, fine. But this is indicative of most films, especially Hollywood, where the facts are excessively sweetened so as to make the crap more edible for the average movie goer. Of course the sugar far exceeds the quality of the candy itself.

Secondly, the use of fairytale to parallel a real world situation has been done to death countless times. Likewise allegory, which is what this film is. So heavy-handed is the symbolism in this film, that, were it not for the more violent elements, I could see a 10-year-old calling this simplistic.

Lastly, I'm surprised few viewers or critics failed to see parallels between this and ""Spirit of the Beehive."" Only difference is ""Spirit of the Beehive"" works on an infinitely more subtle way and opens more interpretations than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" with its chalk could never to do; partly because ""Spirit of the Beehive"" was made in Spain while Franco was still in power. It's easy to make an allegory years after the fact; it's quite another to make a similar statement while under the gun.

And on a side note, especially for readers of mythology: this is not even Pan, but rather a faun, a member of Pan's race. The translation of the film should be ""Labyrinth of the Faun"", but of course Hollywood sees fit to make it more dynamic by invoking the celebrity faun. (Commentors: Please keep mind that I know Hollywood didn't produce this film, but certainly mistranslated and hyped it all to hell.)

And before you reply, yes I'm a film snob. No, I don't believe the halycon days of cinema have past. Yes, I do like contemporary and even mainstream cinema. It's just this mindless obeisance to what everyone thinks are the best films irks me to no end. You are entitled to your own opinion, just as I am. I would only hope more people make an effort to truly think critically about what they're watching before they hop on the band wagon.",1202515200,6,2550,4.6957494407158835

7625993,5,B002BYYA9A,"A beautiful and poignant film which starts at the outset as a children's fairy tale but it is a fairy tale for adults. This is the story about a girl named Ofelia who we are shown lives in 2 world's: 1) The Anti franco post civil war regime where the spanish Maquis guerrillas are fighting a resistance against the Hitler like ruthless captain Vidal and his army men and 2) her own fairy tale fantasy land in a neverland filled with menacing and magical creatures and healing living plants. The main repeating character world from this fantasy world is an enigmatic faun. What is a faun, you ask ?. I looked up wikipedia ""fauns are place-spirits (genii) of untamed woodland.....have horns and both resemble goats below the waist, humans above"". Something like a hybrid unicorn I would guess. Incidentally a faun is used in  C. S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. That faun is possibly a classic faun, the one used by the director in this film is more of a menacing creature which is like cross between the alien and some ostrich. This faun is real creepy, freaked me out.  This is the first movie of it's kind that I have seen where a fantasy movie plays as a parallel thread to a real world movie. The movie is poignant,tragic and enchanting in its score, visual style and essense which is a very tough feat to put off all at once, credit to the director, production designer, and screenplay writer. So in that sense it's not really a fairy tale for kids. Ofelia has to block out the brutal aspects of the violence she is seeing all around her. Further the physical pain endured by her mother during late stages of pregnancy bearing captain Vidal's child (She is not fond of captain Vidal, she senses him as a ruthless and uncaring man, which is what he is when he tell his doctor ""if a choice has to made between the mother and the child, save the baby""), adds to her sense of loss and despair which she compensates by creating this fantasy world that she indulges in from time to time. The real world story has a momentum of it's which could have served as one whole film, a story of Mercedes, the lady cook who in the pantry of captain Vidal. Mercedes is secretly helping her husband and the resitance. Her Husband is part of the guerrillas. Comming back to the mystical Faun from this mystical land, gives Ofelia three tasks. Completion of all three tasks is suppossed to reinstate Ofelia has the princess of this fairy land, a throne that has been waiting for centuries waiting for her re-incarnation. And now her time has finally come. This is not like the Harry potter goblet of fire tasks. The task here serve to immerse us into the believability of this world. The creatures are other worldly, kind of out of place for childeren's fairy tale. The monster in the second task has eyes on his hands and he gets activated when she picks the ripe fruits of the monster's dinner table. It is an amazing escapist movie but which has this beautiful poignant movie score, a great directorial vision and an ambience of a different kind of fairy tale interspersed with the horror of the real world. What a joy of a film to watch. I recommend one and all to see this film. This is a spanish movie by the mexican director Guillermo del Toro, the guy who made blade2, hellboy, and hellboy2: The golden army. In the end we get the subtle idea of the whole film of Ofelia. But I won't everything way lest I rob you of the joy of watching this movie.

7626001,3,B002BYYA9A,"Let me start by offering my motivation for writing this review.  I recently purchased this movie on my brother's recommendation.  I like fantasy movies.  I heard this was ""not for kids"" (a very dark film).  As an artist, I can appreciate the artistic density of this movie (I'm thinking).  None of this posed a problem for me. I was sold.  I read the synopsis.  I'm still good with buying this film.  No problems.  Then I watched it.

D@MN YOU BOB!!!  I should have known better.  You see, I also purchased ""Brazil"" on my brother's recommendation.  I don't think I'll ever watch that DVD again either.  Not surprisingly, though very different in context, these two films are very much the same in political leaning and emotional slather.  In fact, both films have nearly identical endings.

Since I am exceedingly lazy and have limited time, I will resort to my habit of using bullet statements to convey to you why I don't like this kind of movie.  I will also avoid trying to write the names of people involved in making this film because I don't care (it's the film that matters);
( I'll try to point out spoilers with these ***)

-This film, like ""Brazil"" leans hard left.  Personally, I don't care how it leans.  It does have a clear agenda outside of entertaining us with a ""fantasy"" story and that gives it a deceptive smell.  I wanted the fantasy, not the political statement.

-Unlike Brazil, this film actually has historical precedence.  This is probably the only movie about 1944 Franco Spain that I have ever seen.  In retrospect, I really don't care what happened in 1944 Franco Spain.  I think bigger world changing events occurred at that time (or is it just me?).  Even though I have plenty of war movies and if this were not sold as a fantasy movie, I still would not have seen a film about life in Franco's Spain.

-Like Brazil, this movie takes sides.  It's so easy to get the viewer to side with the poor downtrodden ""rebels"" especially here in the U.S...  But when I step back, I ask myself ""What are the rebels rebelling against?""  In both films it's the established and accepted government.  Though imperfect or highly flawed, these governments provide infrastructure, economic stability and security (for a price).  The rebels usually kill perfectly happy innocent people too.  Making the rebels seam noble is a very cheap trick and I am not impressed.  Did you ever here of the ETA. They are the same people we are talking about here and they are considred terrorists in Spain today.  WHERE'S MY FANTASY?

-In the commentary, the Director claims the fantasy is real.  I watched the movie and I have to disagree.  I know this is completely irrational, after all; he's the Director. However, other than a scene with mandrake root, everything points to the fantasy being an escape into one persons mind.  Escaping Franco's Spain.  Therefore this is not a fantasy movie, but a historical war movie.  What one person uses to escape the ugly horrors of Franco's Spain matters little to me since in my mind it is just a diversion.

-Both films are undeniably artistic achievements.  If ""Pan's Labyrinth"" had no fantasy elements at all, it would be a very powerful film about life in the mountains of Franco's Spain (I really am tired of writing that).  Again, I did not really want to see a movie about ""Franco's Spain"".  I was deceived into watching a movie about you-know-where.

-***Unlike Brazil, PL was very realistic.  In fact, this film was so realistic I could almost feel the blood splattering on my face as bullets whistle through men's bodies.  I could almost feel the bottle smashing my face in.  I could almost feel the knife ripping my cheek.  This begs the question.  What is this movie about?

-***Oh yea, the fantasy.  If you separate the fantasy elements from the historical drama, you get a very short, scary, horrifying fantasy film.  Let's see, we get clawed baby eating monster with eyes in his hands.  We get said monster graphically chewing pixies in half. We get giant frogs that regurgitate themselves out of their skins.  We get a very creepy pan with a very irritating and creepy voice.  We get mandrake roots (very much like the ""Harry Potter"" mandrake roots) that require the little girl to bite herself to bleeding on it.  Wait, I just described a HORROR MOVIE!!!

-I know many people just love to watch subtitles to preserve the integrity of the film.  What a load of tripe that is.  I had to watch one scene three times to catch all the overlapping dialogue.  Give me dubbing any day.  Done right, you can actually see the movie undistracted by words on the picture.

-The villain in this film is such an evil SOB hating him becomes easy.  This begs the question; why did the mother remarry to such a jerk?  Of course, this just adds to the emotional slather I previously eluded too.  Why don't we ever get to meet the rebels torture meister?  I'm sure they would have had one.

What's the point of all this?  What exactly am I getting at?  Pan's Labyrinth is sold as a fantasy film when it clearly is not.  You do get images from a fantasy world, true.  You even get grotesque fantasy creatures.  However, it's all rendered moot when the film is actually about the horrors of life during 1944 Franco Spain being so disturbing as to cause a little girl to take refuge in the fantasies of her mind (I don't believe the director for one second).  This is not what I wanted to see.  So I've written this review to give ample warning to those who DO NOT WANT TO SEE A FILM ABOUT LIFE DURING 1944 FRANCO SPAIN, artistic masterpiece or otherwise.  If you want to believe this is a fantasy film with Franco Spain as a backdrop, go for it.  That's not how I see it.",1200960000,6,5709,4.592850049652433

Guillermo Del Toro's remarks add to the understanding and enjoyment of the film. It's like attending a lively filmmaker's master class. Even if you aren't interested in the art of projecting story and emotion on a screen, you'll still undoubtedly find the talk-over interesting.

I had missed so many cinematic nuances the first time through. Del Toro says he conceived the movie as a sort of poem, full of visual rhymes, reflections, and symbols.

7626008,5,B002BYYA9A,"""Pan's Labyrinth"" works on two levels; one is a fantasy world populated by faeries and fantastical creatures, many of whom are brought to heel or outwitted by a little girl, Ophelia.  The other is a grim tale from Franco's Spain in 1944 and the struggle between the reigning forces and the opposition.  Parallel worlds intersect and clash, reaching a bittersweet ending where good triumphs over evil.

The movie is filed with arresting images: the chattering mantis-like stick insect, wood nymphs, the horned faun and the cannibalistic Pale Man.

But that film nor his flawed but good follow-up, Hellboy, did not prepare me for the sheer excellence of this film.  Visually stunning and emotionally devastating, del Toro has set a new high-water mark for himself and fairy-tale films here.  The performances also transcend the language-barrier, especially the brutal and chilling Captain.  The film is too intense for young viewers, but I think a new generation will grow into this film and continue to find new layers of it as they grow older.

7626012,5,B002BYYA9A,"The cruel beauty of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" shows the power of innocence over evil and the triumph of imagination over prosaic servitude.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a dark and disturbing allegorical adult fairy tale by writer-director Guilermo del Toro. Set in 1944 Spain (the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War) 12-year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) travels with her frail and pregnant mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to a remote village to meet her new stepfather, a sadistic Fascist captain named Vidal (Sergi Lopez), who is bent on extirminating the last Republican resistance to Franco scattered in the nearby hills. Clutching her books of myths and fantasy, which her mother suggests she cast aside to face the real world, Ofelia refuses to call Vidal ""Father."" From the start, she pegs him rightly as a ruthless monster, and her unruly behaviour only invites wrath from this psychopath who tortures and kills innocent victims without remorse. Ofelia retreats into the dark labyrinth and down a William Blake-like spiral staircase where she encounters an untrustworthy faun (Doug Jones). This encounter sparks a braided narrative that seamlessly weaves from tragic reality to magical mystery as Ofelia struggles to keep them apart. Alas, collision is iminent. The faun tells Ofelia that she is really a princess, but to prove it and gain entrance into the underworld kingdom of immortality, she must complete three dangerous tasks. Each task is progressively more daunting, from scolding a giant toad in a bug-infested cave to fleeing a Goya-like child-devouring 'Satan' with eyes in his hands. And each adventure draws her closer on a terrifying collision with the real world.

""The horrors of both the realistic and surrealistic worlds are woven into the beautifully aligned narrative structure of del Toro's story,"" said Gene Seymour of Newsday. Glenn Whipp of U-Entertainment, calls Pan's Labyrinth ""dark poetry set to startling images, a one-of-a-kind nightmare that has a soaring, spiritual center."" Gene Seymour further suggests that ""as hard as it may be to watch Guillermo del Toro's dark fairy tale unravel, one comes awy from this magical-realist masterwork oddly invigorated by the way the movie and its principal character triumph over the banality of evil through the autonomy of imagination. The movie may give you nightmares, but it may also give you a few more good reasons to get out of bed the next morning.""

""Pan's Labyrinth"" can be interpreted on many levels from literal to metaphorical allegory to psychological and mythic journey. Every aspect of the film, from tiny visual to people's names (think of Ofelia's name, for instance) has metaphoric meaning. Several excellent reviews by Harry Tuttle (Screenville) and Julian Walker (Julian's Blog) tease out both mythic and Jungian elements of this dark poetic fantasy and I urge you to check these sites for their excellent commentary. From describing the classic Hero's Journey (described by Joseph Campbell) to making references to the mythic Psyche, these two reviewers insightfully unveil the nuance and filigree that weave the complicated tapestry of ""Pan's Labyrinth"".

For me, the allegorical symbol represented by Ofelia's last task brought out the metaphor that struck me the most: the death of innocence required to protect the birth of freedom. Ofelia is the embodyment of the nation's innocence. Refusing to obediently accept the deviant orders of the didactic father figure of Fascism (embodied by both Vidal and the faun), Ofelia (innocence) defies authority and sacrifices her life to ""die"" to protect her baby brother (freedom). Her sacrifice is rewarded by her immortal 're-birth' (hope and faith).",1199664000,2,3677,5.312714776632302
7626013,3,B002BYYA9A,"Critics loved ""Pan's Labyrinth""--if you look it up on Rottentomatoes.com their favored critics averaged 100% in loving it--and that's rare. It's well acted, beautifully directed, perfectly cast, evocative, deep...and I didn't like it.

For one thing, it includes graphic scenes of torture and harm to children. You could say the same thing about Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, both of which I thought were fine films. But in those films all that pain was FOR something. Here, less so. A lot less so.

Euros seem to believe a movie is unrealistic unless it's ultimately bleak, hopeless. But consider a plane crash in which most passengers are killed, some survive by dumb luck, and a few survive by their wits. Who would you want to see a movie about? What's the purpose in seeing vicarious suffering without there being some point to it. Like being one of those looky-lou's who slow down while going by terrible car accident scenes.

American films probably do suffer from excessive optimism. Cops always get their man. Bad guys' bullets always miss. Heroines are always plucky (except in slasher movies). Yada yada. But there's a middle ground that focuses on those who survive/succeed believably, and Pan's Labyrinth isn't there.

I'm not trying to get anyone to not see it. It's a good movie...except philosophically. It does make me feel for the Spanish people, who suffered under fascism for long decades after the rest of Europe had been freed. I can understand how such a movie might reflect their nightmares, given the way that awful regimes cast a long shadow over successive generations. But I don't want such nightmares lodged in my head--not without a redeeming quality I didn't find here.

Spoilers follow--stop reading here if you haven't seen it.

Ofelia is clever and plucky enough to slip the Captain a mickey. Yet in the end she just stands there and lets him plug her. That doesn't seem true to the character. She knew he was doped. She could have weaved and dodged. But the plot arc demanded that she violate her own character so she could die symbolically. Well, I hate it when character is sacrificed for symbolism, or to set up a big f/x sequence, or for any other reason. The Captain could have winged her and she could have imagined the fairyland apotheosis, for that matter, complete with the bleeding. Even more simply, the similarly resourceful Mercedes could have killed the Captain earlier instead of just maiming him. Someone hysterical wouldn't have slashed his carotid artery. But she wasn't presented as hysterical. Again, it seemed like plot was given precedence over character.

Plus the moral seemed to be that Ofelia's working out of her desire to resist fascism through fantasy was all for naught. So is the moral ""Give up"" ??

All in all, the symbolism comes across as heavy handed. The bad guys are bad-isimo, the good guys extra good. That's more simplistic than I care for. The Spanish civil war needs Clint Eastwood to do a more nuanced film about it, as he did for the Western with Unforgiven, which is grim to put it mildly but also has a redemptive quality this film lacked. And just as ""Juno"" in current release, is a more nuanced film about teen pregnancy. See that instead. Or get Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the TV series of course). See the denouement of the 5th season, where Buffy sacrifices herself to save her sister and to save everyone else. That's a good death.

I'm still a little flummoxed at being in such a tiny minority about Pan's Labyrinth. I see what those who liked it saw in it, to be sure. But I don't get why they didn't have my objections as well.

But even if you do see it and love it, perhaps my contrary view will be thought provoking.",1199577600,34,3720,4.753488372093023

7626019,5,B002BYYA9A,"Some day, the sad day will come when Guillermo Del Toro will stop making movies.  No matter what happens between today and that date with destiny, he will be able to look back to ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and say with confidence that he made one of the Great Movies.

""PL"" tells the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a twelve-year old girl condemned to live during the final years of the Spanish civil war.  Her father is dead, and her mother is pregnant by the dastardly Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez).  Vidal commands that Ofelia and her mother come to live with him at his Fascist outpost in the Navarre mountains as he attempts to wipe out the local rebels.

Ofelia has retreated from the horrors of the world to become lost in the world of fairy tales, and so she is better equipped than most when a fairy visits her one night.  The fairy leads her to a labyrinth in the garden behind the country house, where Ofelia learns that she is the daughter of the king of the Underworld.  In order to reclaim her immortality, she must perform three specific tasks, each of which will test her courage to the utmost.

All the while, Vidal carries out a brutal campaign against the rebels.  Guillermo stresses the barbarity of the war without overdoing it . . . almost.  Further straining the nerves of the audience, there are more than a few spies working within the walls of Vidal's outpost, including the gorgeous kitchen maid Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" fame) and the noble Dr. Ferreiro (Alex Angulo).

Del Toro has created a movie of visual splendor, even though much of the movie shows the horrors of war.  You have all seen the spectacular monster with eyeballs in his hands, but there are plenty of other visual delights.  I had thought that I would never see as beautiful a movie about war as Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ""A Very Long Engagement,"" but ""PL"" gives that movie a run for its money.

But more than visual delights, ""PL"" is a serious movie about courage in the face of the darkest adversity.  Even though this is fantasy, Ofelia faces perils in both the real world and the fantastic that far exceed anything Harry Potter ever faces.  Indeed, the risks Ofelia runs in real life make the fantastic threats to her life that much more dire.  Do not be misled by the youthful leading lady to think that just any child can watch ""PL"" and not have nightmares.  Children should see this movie, but only when they are mature enough - I strongly recommend watching this before you let your kids see it.

Congratulations to the entire team for making such a wonderful movie.  It's rare that the fantasy genre gets such mature treatment - if more stories like ""PL"" saw the light of day (and fewer Tolkien clones), the fantasy genre would not be shunted off to one side and would be considered serious fare.

7626022,5,B002BYYA9A,"The beauty & depth of meaning in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was an inspiring revelation that gave my flagging sense of  hope a real boost. It's a like a leftwing fairy tale: Rosa Luxemburg meets insurgent Alice in Wonderland having tea with Trotsky battling fascist reactionaries in The Secret Garden guarded by The Magus reading books by Marx--while thumbing through Madame Blavatsky's Isis Unveiled.

I loved it.

The fascist antagonists are allowed to speak for themselves.

The subtitles are well done & that's important because the film is like an incantation, the sound of the language (Spanish) is a vital element. The music is original & beautiful, and the acting & direction as good as it gets.

The girl who plays an almost reluctant heroine, becomes a Saviour/Redeemer figure, and like Christ, she sheds her blood in order to install a higher level of physical existence through the completion of an spiritual quest. Another, almost Jungian image, is discovered near the end of the film when the girl is carrying her baby half-brother wrapped up in swaddling cloth through the labyrinth; I immediately thought of The Changling motif in which the Little People would take a beautiful human baby and replace it with a troll (doesn't turn out this way in the movie.)

The message? Hang on to nature, don't shut out the inner dimension. Reject fear & fascism.
Power to The Innocent.
Don't be afraid to love...

7626025,4,B002BYYA9A,"This Mexican movie in Spanish with English subtitles operates on two levels. One is about a detachment of Civil Guards in Franco's Spain in 1944 at a campsite fighting the remnants of rebels from the Civil War. The cruel and nasty Captain Vidal heading the detachment is well played by Sergei Lopez. He has married and impregnated a woman who brings her ten-year old daughter to meet the wicked step father.
The picture's other level involves magic, fantasy, sprites and the labyrinth of a faun (called Pan in the English title). The girl, Ofelia, finds the labyrinth where she becomes entranced, and it may well be a dream world that she has conjured up. She is counseled by the faun-satyr.
The rebels versus the Civil Guards is standard stuff, but it was the fantasy element that gave the picture its three Oscars. Director Guillermo del Toro's blending of the realistic and fantasy worlds makes the film arresting.
The movie is worth seeing, but don't expect this to all to end like a fairy tale. The movie has a sad and downbeat conclusion to a brilliantly conceived project.  From the beginning with the stick that becomes like Tinkerbell, you get drawn into this labyrinth and become engrossed in the film's dual level structure.

7626027,5,B002BYYA9A,"Of the many fantasy oriented films produced during thr past two years or so, ""El laberinto del fauno"" is my favorite to date in terms of the genre. Del Toro creates a marvelous fusion of reality and fantasy.  Although the Spanish Civil War had ended, there remained elements of protest, denial and struggle on the part of partisans who were loyal to the previous government; and, there were those elements of extreme  brutality reminiscent of a conflict that was intensely bloody and violent. The pervasion of fantasy assuages the horrofic reality of a fascist regime relentless in pursuing and destroying any and all remaining loyalists to the previous democratic regime in Spain.  There are many mythical adumbrations in the film, such as a central quest theme, archetypal imagery, and redemptive forces.  Although Del Toro is Mexican, he is creating a film whose central theme is, in my opinion, that of an underlying concept that remained central to Spanish literature in the past, specifically that of reality versus illusion, the summit of which was realized in Calderon de la Barca's theatrical masterpiece, ""Life is a Dream.

7626028,5,B002BYYA9A,"The myth and fable shake hands in this bloody and horrid chapter of a recent story at the front of war where rebel troops and military forces try to establish its hegemony.

An innocent and sensitive child, who loves the fairy tales, open her senses to unconsciousness and so, to build a link between myth and reality, as a visible attempt of lyrical evasion and visceral commitment: She ignores it, but she is the chosen, the materialization of an old fable about a princess who never returned her kingdom.

Once you visit the Archeological Museum of Mexico city you will aware why the myth and the legend literally floats and hover all that country.  And if you think it carefully, it just could not be other way: Mexico, the land which was witness of years of legends and ancestral myths, of first rate poets and outstanding thinkers, the same nation from whose entrails emerged Frida Kahlo, Carlos Fuentes and Octavio Paz; who gave shelter to several exiled personalities Trotsky, Eisentein and Buuel).

Pan's Labyrinth is the embodiment of a long expected project that nestled under the mythical imagination of countless generations; an epic fable against the intolerance; a powerful warning about what's right and what's wrong.

Like the primordial seeds of the mythical essence, a generation must die and that baby will represent, the seed of hope and the final outcome of so many shred blood, but enrooted and narrated with such conviction and expressive force that literally will capture our senses and unconsciousness with all the possible vigor.

As for the movie, it is quite excellent. The best I have seen in a while. It is about war, more specifically, the fascist regime that ruled Spain and the backlash from its citizens. As a war movie, it does get very violent. As a dark fantasy film, it also gets very disturbing. However, the juxtaposition of the two is not a marketing ploy to hide a war theme under a fantasy category. As matter of fact, the movie gets its brilliance from both storylines blending together to reveal the hidden truths in our world. If it had only been a war movie or just a fantasy movie, it would have fallen flat...as most movies that only execute in one category. But with Pan's Labyrinth, you get an utterly poignant experience, provoking u to feel and to think on a far deeper level than your average movie.

Oh yeah, a small part of this film (don't be deceived, this is not a fantasy film, it is a war film) is about a young girl who has to do some simple missions for a faun. She goes into a tree and gets a toad to eat three stones, and it barfs up a key for her. She uses the key later to get a dagger that she gives to the faun (although why we have no idea). She eats two grapes and runs from an eyeless creature that has eyes on its hands. She puts a mandrake root under her  mother's bed. In the end she returns ""home"" to some fairy land that hasn't been part of the film to this point. That's it folks. That's the fantasy segments of this film.

7626036,5,B002BYYA9A,"IN 1944 Spain during the Spanish civil war, a young girl named Ofelia has always been a daydreamer and obsessed with fairy tales for has to live in the countryside with her pregnant mother at a farmhouse. One night, she finds a fairy that leads her to the labyrinth outside where she meets a faun creature that tells her that she is a lost princess and must do three important tasks in order to return to the kingdom and escape the horrors of war.

Spectacular and unique adult horror fantasy from Spain/Mexico that is perhaps the best modern fairy tale there might be! Not since ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Lord of the Ring"" has there ever been an imaginative fairy tale that captures the audiences imagination. Guillermo Del Toro (Director of ""Hellboy"", ""Devil's Backbone"", ""Cronos"" and ""Blade 2"") brings a thrilling, powerful and sometimes macabre story that blends the horrors of war with the fantasy innocence of youth. This is one of the best foreign movies i've ever seen and one of the best horror & fantasy movies i've ever seen.

This 2-Disc special edition contains excellent extras like audio commentary, an introduction, Teaser & Trailer, Poster gallery, three outstanding featurettes, ""The Charlie Rose Show"" with the filmakers being interviwed, Three interactive DVD comics that tell the stories of the creatures in the movie, Director's Notebook which are interactive menu page acess video pods that features interviews with Del Toro, Multi-Angel Storyboards and Thumbnail Compares, VFX Plate Compare and Galleries.

So I ordered a slightly more expensive copy directly from AMAZON with second day shipping to get the gift on time. Sometimes this is just the way to go, even if you have to spend a couple more dollars to insure that you will receive your order and it will be shipped promptly and properly. I unfortunately can not be much help with a review of the movie for I have not seen it yet.

Love, hate, war, birth, life, death, killing, salvation ... it's all in this fairy-tale movie. Stories like these are closer to the original fairy tales than the tripe that American culture comes up with on most days.

Other reviewers have provided a synopsis of the plot so I won't bother. I considered letting my 12-year old son watch this with me, but then decided to watch it on my own. I would highly recommend any parent do the same. I'll probably save this movie 'til my son is a bit older.

I'm not a linguist, but for me, ""The Labyrinth of the Faun"" would have been a better translation than ""Pan's Labyrinth."" Naming seems to be such a minor detail, but as we know from fairy tales, naming gives things their power.

My wife and I, along with our 16 yo son, sat down to watch the movie -- luckily I had the remove control. The movie lulls viewers into a sense of fantasy, and then shocks the viewer with over-the-top violence. You sit down expecting an interesting, thought provoking fantasy and find yourself being abused.
I suppose what really annoys me is the deceitful way the movie is marketed. It's really a violent war movie with some brief and absurd fantasy ravings from a disturbed little girls mind thrown in, just to put a veneer of acceptability and cutesiness to the film.
If it was marketed as a violet war movie, I would never have watched it, and would not be writing this review. The fantasy components are short and pointless and seem to be only there to provide a juxtaposition to the extreme violence. I'm so upset about being deceived by this movie that I investigated returning the DVD due to the deceptive marketing. But it looks like Amazon won't take DVD's back just because the viewer was tricked into buying them.

Ofelia, much as her mythical namesake,  was a tragic figure from her first appearance.  Difficult as they are to watch and process, films that deal with the brutal reality of children's lives captivate me, and this one is very honest.  What makes this one so heartfelt is that even in Ofelia's BorderLand her tribulations never abate.  The need to pick and probe what was occurring in her psyche against the backdrop of post-civil war Spain is not necessary for me, though a thorough presentation of the fascist regime serves plenty of opportunity for those who need that tactile thread.  The faerietale overtones of this film could be misleading for some.  The violence in it is not obscured on any level.  For that it deserved its heavy R rating.  Though it doesn't cater to the genre of horror or thriller, the tension it creates is no less creepy and disturbing.",1194393600,3,957,4.716867469879518

7626048,5,B002BYYA9A,"This is one of those films that you either love or hate:  its themes and vision are so strong that if you can't identify with the story or don't want a brutal journey, it will not be your bag.  This is not Disney fare, but a look into horror and the power of a child's imagination to cope with it.  The details contain such naked pain and the stark reality of human depravity, yet juxtaposed against an imaginative child's world that runs from, yet is coming to understand, it all.

The child is taken to the home - besieged in the hills of Franquist Spain during WWII - of her step father.  He is a fascist and sociopath, with no love to give, and on a mission to crush the local resistance by any means necessary - and I mean any means.  She sees him for what he is, and as yet is as uncorrupted as her very sick mother is co-opted.  They are brought into this environment in order for the step father to witness the birth of his son, in spite of all the dangers.  The child translates this reality into a parallel fairy tale, but it is less an escape than a recognition of the full situation.

As the plot unfolds, she is called to accomplish a number of tasks to reclaim her place in a magical world.  As reviewers have noted, the juxtaposition is brilliantly executed.  Indeed, the characters from both worlds are so vivid that this may be one of the best fantasy films I have ever seen.

The story is moving in its realism, with unbearable glimpses of physical and emotional pain, graphically displayed and extremely sad, with all the wonder that lovers of history and human potential can feel.  I was stunned and riveted  to the point of weeping.

This is not for children, but a truly dark exploration of who we are and what we are capable of.  Recommended - it is the most vivid fantasy, anchored in an utterly un-hollywood reality.",1194220800,4,1841,4.370588235294117

7626050,5,B002BYYA9A,"It has been a long time since I was completely blown away by a film, but this one does it. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a fairy tale wrapped around a modern horror story, the aftermath of Franco's Spanish Civil War. A young girl travels with her pregnant mother to live with her mother's new husband, a sadistic captain of a garrison in a rural area of Spain in 1944, where anti-Fascist forces are still heavily active. She meets a fairy who takes her to a faun who tells her she is really a princess, but must prove her royalty by surviving three tasks. On one level, it is the story of the soul of a princess trapped in human form trying to get back to its magical world while living in the midst of human horror. On another level, it is the story of a young girl who is so horrified by the world around her that she escapes into fantasy. Although the film is in Spanish with English subtitles, it is a mesmerizing film that will leave you stunned. Ivana Baquero as the young girl and Sergi Lopez as the sadistic captain give bravura performances. The music, photography and production design are hauntingly beautiful. Guillermo del Toro, who has previously directed ""Blade II"" and ""Hellboy,"" has done a masterful job with this film. If you do not like fantasy films or fairy tales or films that have an art house feel about them, do not bother seeing this film.

Consequently, I realized that I wasn't going to see THE NEVERENDING STORY 3 or FREE WILLY 10. What I wasn't prepared for was just how wonderful this movie actually is. Guillermo del Toro (The Devil's Backbone, Hellboy) takes us into a real, living nightmare, in the form of war and the evil men who profit by it. Within this hellish world, a girl named Ofelia (along w/ her ailing, pregnant mother) is forced to live w/ her stepfather, a spanish captain in Franco's fascist army. Ofelia's mind splits off into the safety of her imagination, allowing her to live her life as a girl on a mystical quest, rather than as a prisoner. She enters a stone labyrinth on the captain's property, leading to a spiral staircase, taking her down into the bowels of the earth below. Ofelia meets a faun (a goat-headed chap) who tells her of her past and her destiny. He also gives her a magical book and three tasks to accomplish. Reality and fantasy smear together as Ofelia's adventure becomes increasingly horrific. While Ofelia's stepfather murders the leftists he detests, and her mother grows weaker, Ofelia must accept greater challenges in her dreamworld, including the amazingly terrifying ""baby-eater"" monster! This thing is one of the best critters I've seen since HELLRAISER! Very disturbing to look at! I wouldn't want it coming after me! Ofelia draws on strengths she is unaware of, and overcomes ordeals that would cause most adults to wilt. I found PAN'S LABYRINTH thoroughly engrossing in it's use of imagery and symbolism to bring reality and nightmare together. I was afraid for Ofelia both in this world and the netherworld. Still, I found the ultimate message of life after death / good overcoming evil to be uplifting. Nope, this isn't G-rated family fare. However, it is a tremendous morality tale for grown-ups...  P.S.- I recommend watching THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE first, to get an idea of del Toro's style and use of dark fantasy...",1193011200,3,2073,4.8559322033898304

7626057,5,B002BYYA9A,"What a beautiful vision. I am in awe of such wonderfully executed filmmaking. I got to see this in the waning months of 06 and was easily the best film I had gone to since ""V for Vendetta"", and is quite easily in my top 100 maybe top ten films of all time. That is lofty praise from a calloused cynic such as I. ""Children of Men"" is another recent film that moved me along similar lines. I would highly recommend ""The Devil's Backbone"" also directed by Guillermo del Toro, if you are a big fan of Pan's Labyrinth. Not quite as good perhaps, but still riveting.
 The Captain in this movie is played with such cold, cruel, barbaric realism, that one cannot help but to rejoice in his abrupt, less-than-heroic demise at the climax of this film.
 Those who take issue with the brief moments of extremely graphic violence, must first understand that del Toro simply wishes to be openly realistic in his films about what has, and still goes on in every corner of this planet, where the beast rules and exercises authority.
 You may take the PG13 road America so desperately clings to when it comes to viewing the physical manifestations of the politics of hate, espoused by fascists and tyrants since man ""civilized"" himself, or we can be upfront and show the true horrors of the beast, that are generally censored from our re-telling of history by the victors and conquerors. Kudos Guillermo, for having the nuts. Nosce Te Ipsum.
 Ivana Baquero puts forth one of the trully inspired ""child-actor"" performances known to film. (Compare to the pretencious preenings of a Haley Joel Osmet, or your typical, spoiled, Hollywood snot and you are even more greatful.)
The supporting actors and actresses are equally convincing in their roles, altho, the brilliance of their performances will most likely be lost on the English-speaking, immigrant-abusing, narrow-minded, American masses. (One person I know, absolutely hated this film on the simple-minded basis that he had to read subtitles! Yeah! Salutations to a nation of unenlightened swine.)
 I found the ""Pale Man"" to be a riveting character. The film was definitely bettered by the a**-clenching angst inspired by this beast.
Doug Jones definitely outdid himself in this film, between his double personas as both the ""Pale Man"" and Pan. I became fond of the myriad of sounds issuing from this man-goat as he conversed. And both characters had the beautifully grotesque fingers of the damned.
 Not much more can be safely rendered to print, without playing the role of the cursed spoiler, so I will put the wraps to it here.",1192233600,3,2568,4.838268792710706

7626060,5,B002BYYA9A,"If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" (""El Laberinto del Fauno"") is a sequel of sorts to ""The Devil's Backbone,"" a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War. But this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting -- in short, a triumph.

Time and place: 1944, Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.

To do so, he tells her that she must do three things, and gives her a strange book. Ofelia menages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. Even worse, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever... and being offered a terrible choice if she wants to get in.

Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares. But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones for adults, that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes ""Pan's Labyrinth"" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt.

Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style and brilliant visuals. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape.

At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the ""real world"" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow. But Del Toro's biggest triumph is an ending that is beautifully bittersweet, and which turns out to hinge on Ofelia's newborn brother.

But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere ""safe."" Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond. And L&oacute;pez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.

Half ""Mirrormask"" and half gritty war story, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the best fantasy stories in years -- dark, passionate and beautifully made. Definitely a great movie.",1192147200,114,2913,4.788844621513944
7626061,5,B002BYYA9A,"This movie was so wonderful, and probably the best I have ever seen.
It starts out in war torn spain, and is of a lonely young girl of about 12.
Freshly arriving in Spain with her Mother, to meet her new sadistic ""stepdad"", she comes across a fairy and a fawn, who tell her that she is really a princess from long ago. There have been portals open for years to bring her back to her kingdom, but before this happens, she must perform 3 tasks, to prove her immortality.

Without making this too long and giving the whole storyline away, I will say that her quest leads her to the most visually stimulating scenes I have ever seen onscreen.
They are terrible and wonderful all at the same time. There are creatures that eat fairies and babies...creatures who have eyes in thier hands, and places so over the top, I can't even imagine how the scenes were created...
Beyond all the beautiful visuals though, there lies a very sad story of a lonely innocent girl that is quite touching...
This is how Fairytales USED to be at the turn of the century,how  they SHOULD be..until Hollywood RUINED them, just like Alice in Wonderland was ruined, and ""Disney-fied"" as one reviewer put it.

I purchased this DVD when it first came out, and have watched it many times since, and will watch it many more. It is a stunning masterpiece that will leave you in tears.

7626062,5,B002BYYA9A,"I tend to give good movies extra points for being original; especially in an industry where some claim there are no more original ideas.  Director Guillmero Del Toro has made a masterful film that should be seen only by serious film buffs.  And please folks with children; this aint for kids.  That ""R"" rating is there for a reason.

The film: beautiful to look at.  The cinematography is first-rate, so much so that the CGI elements are blended into the film to the extent that you can not discern the real from the fake.

The acting: top notch with everyone delivering excellent performances which is saying a lot because I don't speak Spanish.  The standout's are the Captain and his nemesis and the central character, Ofelia.

The story: (slight SPOILER ALERT) as I mentioned before is an original tale that manifests its reality by borrowing many elements and themes from other genres.  I won't quibble with whether this is a fairy-tale or not.  That's up to the egg-heads in film school to sort out (or it's whatever Del Toro says it is).

I will say that while the fantasty elements are prevail, they do so within the confines of a tragedy.  It is here the film really succeeds most effectively.  Del Toro does as good a job as has ever been done of weaving together reality and the surreal elements.

As Ofelia goes on her various quests, meeting the new creatures and monsters along the way, I was reminded of the Wizard of Oz and Dorothy's travails to get home.  Indeed, Ofelia is trying to get home too, though where in fact is that home is the ambiguity that Del Toro leaves the viewer to sort out; though he leaves a heck of a big hint in the film (think of the scene preceding Ofelia's abduction of her infant brother from the Captain).

And the Captain...that's the Bridge Over the River Kwai reference.  It's what happens when you drop a sadist soldier accustomed to brutalizing those beneath him into a situation where innocents are within his reach.

I think this film will age well with time.  Hopefully the industry sees fit to keep it in rotation on cable and it finds a larger audience on DVD.  It's that good, and that's something I haven't been able to say about a film in a long time.",1191888000,2,2209,4.544303797468355

7626066,1,B002BYYA9A,"This was advertised as a ""fairy tale"" or having aspects of one.  But maybe 10% of it has to do with the imaginative fairytale aspect of the story.  90% of it is a super violent recounting of a sick sadist's experience of the Spanish Civil War.  So expect lots of blood and violence (bashing someone's face in, slicing someone's cheek open, breaking all the bones in someone's hand in a torture session, shooting a child, etc.).

I don't necessarily mind this per se but I do think it is a case of false advertising.  If they had been honest about what the film was theywould have made less money.  So they were cynical in the way they promoted the film.

7626067,1,B002BYYA9A,"where to start? (spoilers)

-the pacing was mind-numbingly slow--I was desperate for the film to be over five minutes in
-the characters are SO flat--I was only too glad that the Captain shot Ofelia in the end.  Not something I feel good about, but as a character Ofelia is depthless and excruciatingly daft.  Why she loves her mother, who is also depthless and daft, is a mystery.  (Thankfully, she dies in childbirth.  Again, not something I feel good about.)  Why she imagines herself an important princess of an imaginary kingdom (for in the end, the faun and the fantasy are proved to be entirely a figment of Ofelia's victimized psyche) when she is so intolerably stupid is another mystery.  For someone who is such an avid reader, Ofelia lacks any sense.

For instance, if a Faun sends you to a place to complete a task, a place which he says is laden with rich foods which you MUST NOT EAT lest you disrupt a sleeping creature, you do what he says.  When you arrive to this place where the creature slumbers at the table covered with rich food, and there is a plate before the creature with two EYES set on it, you do as the Faun says.  Moreover, if the ceiling above the table showcases a series of paintings depicting this creature DEVOURING CHILDREN in gruesome ways, and if there is a pile of child-sized shoes beside the table, oughn't you not eat the food?

None of these details clue Ofelia in, and she picks a couple of grapes at the same time that her fairy helpers are telling her not to.  The stupid girl very rudely swats them away.  The grotesque creature wakes up and fits the two eyes on the plate in the sockets IN ITS HANDS, and then proceeds to attack Ofelia (but not before gobbling up two of her poor fairy helpers), who is ENTIRELY surprised.

-the real villain of the piece is the mindlessly murderous fascist, known only as the Captain--is it redundant to complain of a fascist murderer being one dimensional?
-the fantasy element was a big letdown - the makeup and special effects of the Faun and the other magical creatures Ofelia encounters are fantastic, but they comprise only a fraction of the movie, the rest of it being the brutal actions of the Captain.
-I wouldn't have minded the violence if the film had justified it.

Ultimately the fantasy elements clashed with the real world elements.  The film was really a Grimmed-up interpretation of Alice in Wonderland, without the intelligence or wit of the Alice books and without anything consequential or moral coming at the end of a Grimm tale.

Very boring.

Worth watching once, but be warned:  you'll be clutching for something to bludgeon yourself with less than halfway through.

It's so tedious.",1191024000,28,2691,4.649048625792812
7626068,4,B002BYYA9A,"In 2001, Mexican writer-director Guillermo del Toro used the Spanish Civil War as a backdrop for his ghost story ""The Devil's Backbone"". Six years later, del Toro has returned to the tumultuous Franco era, this time with a twist of dark fantasy in his Spanish-language film,""Pan's Labyrinth"".

12-year old newcomer Ivana Bacquero delivers an impressive, nuanced performance as the film's central character Ofelia, an intelligent,introverted girl on the verge of puberty who still clings to her childhood fascination with fairy tales. She and her very pregnant mother have just set up quarters with her new stepfather(the always brilliant Sergi Lopez), the brutal, sadistic Captain Vidal,a Fascist officer charged with mopping up rebel forces entrenched in the Spanish countryside.

With nothing resembling love or affection forthcoming from the black-hearted Vidal, and with her mother becoming increasingly bedridden due to a difficult pregnancy, Ofelia finds an escape valve by retreating ever deeper into a personal fantasy world, which she enters through a gate in a nearby garden. This is not necessarily Alice through the looking glass, as you might think; this is a much darker world of personified demons and monsters borne from Ofelia's subconscious take on the real-life horrors being perpetrated by her truly monstrous stepfather and his Fascist henchmen.

In certain respects, the film reminded me of 1973's (much more subtle) ""Spirit of the Beehive"", also set in Franco's Spain, and likewise depicting a lonely young girl retreating into a private fantasy world in response to feelings of estrangement from her family.

While there are also some parallels here to the likes of ""Alice In Wonderland"", ""Spirited Away"", and ""The Secret Garden"", be advised that this is not your garden variety feel-good fairy tale with a warm and fuzzy ending that you want to watch with the kids. The fantasy sequences are closer in tone to Grimm morbidity than to Tolkien whimsy; and del Toro pulls no punches depicting the real horror and suffering that takes place during wartime.

In the visual department, the director once again displays an admirable talent for seamlessly blending wildly imaginative production design and prosthetics to create a vivid fantasy world (del Toro's resume includes Mimic, Blade II and Hellboy.)

I have a caveat: if you find depictions of soldiers being tortured and malevolent violence directed against women and children upsetting,proceed with caution. (I am aware that no decent human being in their right mind finds that kind of thing much fun to watch in the first place, but I see the potential for more sensitive viewers to become quite distressed).",1190678400,2,2686,5.293427230046948
7626069,5,B002BYYA9A,"After 491 customer reviews, what's one more?  Oh, why not?

I have but one criticism of the film as it is available with English subtitles, and that is the title itself. From ""Labyrinth of the Faun"" it has been rendered ""Pan's Labyrinth.""  In Greek mythology, Pan was one particular sylvan god who possessed a strong phallic character and who was known to pursue nymphs for his own amusement. The English title inclined me to doubt the motives of the faun until the very end of the story, when I felt that it had unintentionally created a red herring.  Although indeed associated with Bacchus, fauns as a group were rather less venal than Pan, and I could accept one of their number as serving the great god of the earth and relating to Ofelia with more disinterest than I could Pan.

My annoyance with the transliteration of the title aside, the story told by this film is fantastically rich both in symbolism and in its multiple layers of interpretation.  It even invites us to consider the question of the nature of reality.

On the most superficial level, we see a young girl escaping a most brutal reality by plunging mentally into a fantasy world complete with kings, princesses, fairies, toads, and, of course, a faun.  But is it a fantasy world?  Philosophers have long argued the nature of reality and whether or not it even exists beyond one's perception and interpretation of it.  This intentional ambiguity of what is real and what is imaginary (and, indeed, whether there is even a distinction between the two) permeates the entire viewing experience.

Is the creature we first meet a large winged insect or a fairy (a question specifically asked of it by Ofelia)?  Does it mutate from insect-like form to fairy-like form in the physical domain or just in Ofelia's imagination--or does her imagination inform the physical domain?  Does the mandrake root under the bed really mitigate her mother's suffering, or does Ofelia imagine that it does, mentally creating the reality she longs for?  Does the burning of the mandrake cause her mother's death, or is it mere coincidence which Ofelia's imagination imbues with a cause-and-effect significance?

As has been asked by other reviewers, is Ofelia herself merely an imaginative young girl subjected to the unending horror of war, rebellion and retribution, or is she the symbolic manifestation of something much greater?  As her blood drips into the concentric circular pools, she is taken before the great god, her father--or does her dying mind create this final fantasy?  While not at all overbearing or blatantly obvious, there is more than a little Christian symbolism mixed with the Pagan here!  That the great god, Ofelia's father (in the fairy tale--or is it in reality?), rules a kingdom beneath the earth does not, however, imply that he is satanic but rather suggests a Pagan earth god rather than a Christian sky god, a depiction that fits well with the fairy tale motif and the presence of a faun.

The labyrinth itself--what does it signify?  Of course, one might expect to find a magic labyrinth in a fairy tale, but is it also symbolic of the entrapping cruelty of life with its myriad twists and turns, most of which lead only deeper into its midst?  At the end of the labyrinth (of life?) lies the entrance to the magic kingdom (of heaven?).

The film maker does not stint on realism.  The cruelty of Franco's fascist police is vividly portrayed, not merely suggested.  Torture, death, blood and pain are naturalistically depicted.  There are a few occasions when many viewers may avert their eyes from the screen.  Yet, beyond the action, entertaining, imaginative, creative, and horrific as it may be from scene to scene, the true power of this film lies in the many different interpretations it weaves in the viewer's mind, in the multi-layered symbolism of the setting and of the characters themselves, and in the questions that it subtly inserts in the viewer's consciousness, questions that will resurface to enthrall the viewer long after the film has run its course.

Don't worry; there are no spoilers here. You learn almost all these facts in the first few minutes of the film.

This is the story. It's about a little girl.

This is the other story. It's also about a little girl.

In the first story, the little girl is the daughter of a tailor. He father is dead and her mother has remaried, and they are going to live with the new husband in his home in the woods.

In the other story, the little girl is a princess, daughter of a king who rules below the ground. She envies sunlight and flowers, and runs away to the mortal realm above her head.

In the first story, it is World War 2 and the little girl's new father is a Captain in Nazi Spain. Her mother is pregnant with his child, a son. He guards the valley through which the trains run from his headquarters at the old mill.

In the second story, the princess dies above ground, old and cold and far from home. And her father says: her soul will come back to us in some other way, and we will wait until the end of time for her.

In the first and second stories, there is a dark old labyrinth in the woods, near the old mill....

In this story the fair realm the tailor's daughter wanders upon is as dangerous, as strange and difficult to navigate as the real world; there are monsters a plenty, and the fairies are not sweet children with wings. Trust is as strange and thorny there as anywhere, and promises have weight and texture.  Even the tales she tells in the real world for her own comfort, her fairy tales, have no happy endings; just prickly questions and loose ends that sit inside your mind and make you a little uncomfortable. Her fairyland is the fairyland that folks once knew, where punishment for laziness and pride lurked around every corner and stupidity would definitely get you eaten.",1190592000,2,2024,4.288713910761155

The story centers around Ofelia, who accompanies her sickly mother to the outpost of her Fascist stepfather, Captain Vidal.  This man has absolutely no redeeming qualities.  He brutalizes his wife, and only cares at all for her because she is pregnant with his son.  He instructs her doctor to let her die should the child be in danger.  He also takes great pleasure in torturing, most graphically, rebel prisoners.  One of the bleakest views of Fascist Spain ever filmed.

There is superb acting, especially from the indominable Maribel Verdu as the servant who also is a very effective and brave rebel collaborater.

A strange viewing experience, almost unbearably violent and hateful when Captain Vidal gets going, with an ending when only partially mitigates the harshness which prevails throughout.",1190505600,10,1050,5.233532934131737
7626074,5,B002BYYA9A,"Mexican director Del Toro has made a film about rebellion against oppression.  It is not political or materialistic rebellion, but a rebellion of the spirit. The film does not have any of the Hollywood divisions of ""Good"" and ""Bad"", or adhere to any political ideology (""Fascist oppressors vs. Communist freedom fighters""). Del Toro goes deeper than that, and therefore makes the film more general, but also more uncomfortable: he makes a film about the eternal struggle between Realists and Romantics.
Captain Vidal is a very unpleasant fellow, yet, he is a more many faceted character than the traditional villain: he lacks dreams. It is hinted at in the film that the death of his father traumatized him. Vidal now desperately clings to form. His society is a society of law, but without justice, a society of bread, but without caring, a society of either/or, but no neither/both, and, finally, a society of answers, but without questions. It falls down upon the man of science, Dr. Perreiro, to tell him that it is more than strict logic that makes a human. It is this weakness that finally destroys Vidal, he can kill, but he cannot conquer.
In contrast to Captain Vidal stands his step-daughter, Ofelia. She is also traumatized by her own father's death, but she has created an imaginary world filled with fairies, wonders, quests, and dangers, but also with ultimate hope.
It is fairly clear that Ofelia's experiences take place only in her head, but Del Toro leaves enough doubt to show the viewers that he does not want to provide any ready made answers. He might also want to show that even in the spiritual and intellectual blight that was Franco's Spain there existed magic and beauty.",1190505600,,1698,4.875432525951557

The actors all did excellent jobs in this violent cinematic outing, and the placing of the story in a dense, dark forest worked very well too. The main reason I am going out on a wobbly limb and giving this movie four stars instead of five is that to be brutally honest, I think Pan's Labyrinth left a lot needing to be explained. It has one of those plots that simply hands out what there is and leaves you no choice to but to take what you're given, sans much background or annotation of the mythology of its inner soul. It should have been a little bit longer and taken more time to make us feel more aware of what was at stake in Ofelia's quest. After the movie was done I felt like a huge chapter was missing.

7626078,5,B002BYYA9A,"For an intense experience that is beyond easy categorization, there are few films that equal the extraordinary experience that is ""Pan's Labyrinth.""

Set in post-civil war Spain, in 1944, the film focuses on a small outpost of Franco's army stalking remnants of rebel groups operating in the hills. The leader of the government force is Captain Vidal, and the film begins with the arrival in camp of his pregnant wife. His wife is accompanied by Ofelia, her daughter by another man, now deceased, by what manner is not told. The girl is a bookworm and fond of fairy stories. After finding an odd stone in the road, she activates a magical process that awakens the interest of a curious, clicking insect, which she regards as a fairy and follows her to camp. The camp itself is a cauldron of intrigue, with suspicious soldiers rounding up and intimidating peasants and locals seemingly in cahoots with the rebels. Ofelia's mother is soon sidelined with complications of the pregnancy, and Ofelia becomes more and more entangled  in a mysterious and fantastic underground world. She meets a faun, a sort of goat-horned semi-deity, who takes Ofelia for the daughter of a king. The faun gives Ofelia a book and a series of tasks that she must perform to demonstrate her royal credentials.

Pan's Labyrinth is frightening and violent -- on both sides of the magical divide. The major question running through the film is the relation of the realms to one another. Is the fairy realm real? Or is it a figment of Ofelia's fragile imagination? It's not giving much away to suggest that this question will not bee resolved by the end of the film. Arguing against the idea that Ofelia seeks refuge in fairyland is that the creatures she meets there are as ugly, murderous and demanding as the ones in her real life. If anything, the creatures offer nightmarish parallels to the characters above ground. What differentiates the two realms is that ultimately, the fairy world, though subject to harsh and uncompromising laws, is ultimately benign and intends only good on those who abide by its rules. The world above is harsh too, but wishes only to dominate and terrorize its subjects, not to rule them justly.

The film is a luscious feast of images from beginning to end. The Captain, a malevolent and dictatorial man, is seen gently oiling a watch that may have been his father's. The faun, wise and kind in the moonlight, gently brushes Ofelia's face with his long, twiglike fingers. An underground ogre, with eyes in the palms of his hands, holds his eyes up to his face, fingers spread into a frightening fringe. The films' effects are mostly well-handled, with fairies flitting noisily about and graphic violence and torture convincingly portrayed.

Pan's Labyrinth does not offer up an easy solution for the problems it poses. It offers up a complex and many-layered ending that is hard to comprehend as a clear-cut victory for any side. If anything, it parallels the world wee all live in, in which victory is a distant goal, even an illusion, that empowers and propels action, and in which the events of any single day cannot always be seen as trending to our good or our ill. Pan's Labyrinth is about one girl's determined desire to respond with openness to her world, with all of its ugliness and beauty, come what may.

Despite its fairytale subject matter, the movie is not for kids. It well ddesserves its R rating for graphic violence, including an amputation, executions and field surgery.",1190246400,,3496,4.837792642140468
7626079,5,B002BYYA9A,"In post Civil War Spain, eleven year old Ofelia travels into the mountains with her pregnant and severely ill mother, as they join her new stepfather, a torturous Fascist Military Captain whose assignment is to decimate fledgling bands of Communist guerillas.  With the brutality of war all around her and a mother who seems destined to not survive her pregnancy, Ofelia's escape from the horrors of the world are in her collection of fairy tales, including one that seems to come alive in an ancient labyrinth.

In one of Ofelia's books, she learns of Princess Moanna, the daughter of an underworld King, who is believed to live in the mortal world, but will someday return to rule alongside her father.  One night in the labyrinth, Ofelia meets a faun who tells her she is the lost Princess and will be able to return home if she completes three tasks.  I say she ""meets"" a faun, others may say she ""imagines"" meeting a faun.  The film is open to interpretation, as those who believe in fairy tales see the entire action of the film as true, while others see her supernatural adventures as a young child's imaginative way of dealing with war and death.

Ofelia's quest to complete the faun's tasks makes up much of the plot of Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth.  Almost oblivious to the war around her, Ofelia battles giant toads and child-eating monsters, scenes presented in brilliant colors that juxtapose the dark bluish-grey scenes of war.  Countering her story is the Captain's brutal dictatorship over the mountain, as he kills without cause and tortures to both get answers and satisfy urges within.  Although a film advertised as a ""fairy tale"", the true-to-life violence in the Captain's scenes rivals anything released since The Passion of the Christ.  Del Toro unapologetically displays the real consequences of meeting flesh to a blade or the butt of a gun.

That the director doesn't distinguish between his two stories, that he doesn't favor one over the other is the magic of Pan's Labyrinth.  Viewers who believe are just as convinced as to the existence of the fawn as they are of the guerillas.  And to those of us who have never known war, we can relate just as much to the enchantment of Ofelia's dreams as we can to the barbarity of Spain's nightmare.",1190160000,2,2290,4.796437659033079

Being a Spanish film, I used the English subtitles to read the character's dialogue, and didn't find this inconvenient at all. I'm a huge fan of foreign films and am used to using ""subtitles"" from time to time.  The movie's plot is well constructed and the actors all give fine performances.  I really enjoyed young actress Ivana Baquero in the lead as Ofelia, who has many challenges set before her by the Pan creature, who promises her an escape from the human's world of war and violence to a Kingdom of riches and beauty.  Ofelia finds an ally in Mercedes, a servant of Ofelia's cruel stepfather, which is played by Maribel Verdu, (who gives a heartfelt performance) and the two share a battle in the ""real"" world, as the cruelty's of the Spanish military, especially from Ofelia's Military Commanding stepfather, cumulates into an ending of both triumph and despair.

 I was expecting more of a child friendly film in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but I also went into it knowing that there would be some imagery that would be somewhat frightening to a child.  I did not expect there would be so much foul language in the film and the brutality of torture, up close pistol shots to the head, and the crashing of a man's nose into his face with the butt of a gun, wasn't only completely out of character for a ""fairy tale"" type movie, but was also very shocking, to say the least.  I feared the military's soldiers more than I did the creepy troll with the eyeballs in its hands!

The 2 disc Special Edition is an enjoyable DVD experience and is loaded with interesting and fun extras.  Foreign film fans will treasure this clever and creative Spanish offering, and Fantasy movie buffs will delight in the wonderful adventures of ""the tree toad,"" ""the potato root-like creature that longs to be human,"" the Pan creature and scenes where Ofelia can draw an imaginary door on a surface with a piece of chalk and create a door into ""the other world.""  Each of these scenes is expertly done using CGI effects and is totally amazing to behold.  I enjoyed the fantasy scenes (as I knew I probably would) of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" however, I felt the violence was too extreme and the evil of the cruel stepfather, the military, and the human world in general, could have been emphasized without resembling something from Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List.""",1189382400,2,2397,4.708133971291866
7626085,3,B002BYYA9A,"I grew up reading fairy tales that were laced with death and violent imagery. The Little Mermaid, the Little Match Girl, the Red Shoes, the Snow Queen, the Steadfast Tin Soldier, the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, and the Fir Tree. All of those and many more had such sadness, and loss, and they were meant to stir up the imagination as well as teach us a lesson. Pan's Labyrinth is supposed to be one of those tales, and it almost reaches the goals it sets but not quite. I allowed myself some time, between watching it and writing a review to let it all sink in, because right after you watch it you have a lot of emotional conflictions.

I love foreign films, because usually they tend to give me another view of society, and cultures I am unfamiliar with. Different locations in this world have different tales to tell, and most are influenced by the history of that land. I always watch them in the original language, with subtitles, because you cannot get the message when it's dubbed.

This movie started out well, its promise was apparent, but it soon went downhill for me. It had beautiful imagery, costumes, and the effects were both awesome and mediocre. They dropped the ball when it came to the real life drama, the gore and bloody scenes. While they were horrifying, I could tell what CGI was and what wasn't. The fantasy effects were amazing, especially with the Faun and the Baby eating demon. They were full and lush and inspiring. However they totally dropped the ball in the end, when Ofelia gets to the underworld it was the hugest most disappointing ending I have ever seen, worst even than Jodie Fosters ""Contact"".

Her walking into that bright room, three thrones and a standing ovation by whomever...was in Eric Cartman's great words....""Lame"". I got no feeling of joy; I felt no awe over her return. Here they showed us this superb creature, the Faun, and really they just dumped all their eggs in that effect basket and ignored everything else.

I would say watch it, for the Faun and for the almost awesomeness of it all, its worth a look, but don't expect to come away satisfied.",1189296000,5,2401,4.589743589743589
7626086,4,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth takes place in post Civil War Spain (actually in 1944) where a young girl and her mother are moving to live with her mother's new husband (he's a captain in the Spanish military, suppressing Communist Guerilla's in the country side).  As they near the place where they're to live, the young girl see's what she believes is a fairy.  I say that because a constant theme in the movie is the reality she lives in (The Captain is a brutal man) and the world of fairy she interacts with.  The drivers for her world of fairy the books she reads and the old ruins, including a labyrinth made of stone (the depictions on the stones reminded me of the Celts).

Review wise this is a solid 4.5 star movie!  The cinematography is great!  Pan and the fairy's are excellent, the lighting superb, and the people do an excellent job of capturing the era.  The tie between the real world and the fairy world is nicely done.  Her first task was good but a little hard to believe with the size of the toad.  The second one was interesting to say the least.  While the dialog is in Spanish, the captioning in English was simple, direct, but unfortunately a little quick at times.  Since I have to decide between 4 and 5 stars, I'll give this one 4 because while I enjoyed the movie very much in every way possible, there was something slightly missing to make this a 5 star movie.

Btw, for those with small children, be cautious with showing this to children under 10 years old.  There are several pieces dealing with torture and bloodshed (necessary for the story in my opinion) that might be to complex for young minds (or those not familiar with the Spanish Civil War).",1189296000,2,1670,4.471947194719472
7626087,5,B002BYYA9A,"But a stunning one at that and it works on a deeper subconscious level which is the movie's greatest strength. The acting, design, and direction are absolutely stunning.

I totally disagree with all the synopses and reviews out there claiming the fairy episodes are a little girl's imagination attempting to free her from the horrors of late WW2 Spanish totalitarianism. There are too many tie-ins between those and ""real-world"" events to make this entirely clear but I do find the ambiguity itself to be a bit of a cliche.

Regardless, I enjoyed every beautiful minute of it.

I'm sure I'm not the first reviewer to add this caveat for parents who don't bother to check the ratings but this is definitely NOT for kids. It features one of the most gruesome and disturbing scenes of violence I've ever seen and some truly horrific imagery from both worlds.",1189209600,2,855,4.802721088435374

Suffice it to say you've been told enough herein about the performances and effects. They deserve the praise...but (here for the sake of discussion, not merit) like a few other contributors, my one gripe was: WHY would such a purposeful and resourceful girl disobey an important command? You know the scene. She didn't behave as if she was starving, as she probably could have. And why would she stand there, puzzled, after realizing the consequences of her actions? Having said that, it was one eerie setpiece, especially its first minute as she walks in...",1188432000,,905,4.524390243902439
7626090,2,B002BYYA9A,"Many people after I told them I didn't like this movie told me its because I'm a stupid American and I don't like reading subtitles which I retort no its because this movie sucked.

Pan's Labyrinth, I think I'm one of the few that actually find this movie to have some amazing elements in it, but all in all it's just a Hollywood piece of junk.  Visually when it comes to the fantasy its amazing the monsters the atmosphere, everything great but then its lead by a war story that can barley hold a grain of salt.

Generally the characters where flat, which I must say fantasy usually thrives on this fact I though found this to be annoying when the film worked so much on the real world rules.  The bad guy in this film the General is an amazing sadist but that's all he is, they're nothing else to him.  And the maid that cry that she can't do anything that she works for this bad man but does nothing.  And when she has a chance to kill him, to actually do something she leaves him with a knife in his back, know fully well that he would torture the little girl.  And all this was done so the director could have his ending that left me not surprised and disillusioned.

Not only did the flat characters annoy me but also the battle scene make no sense.  So after the rebels rob from the storage rooms they have a battle out in the hill.  So here the rebels are on the top of the hill while the fascist are on the bottom.  The rebels have tactical advantage by being above them; they can easily hide behind rock and simply duck to get out of firing range.  But no they stand on the rocks completely exposed so that the general can have an epic scene when he runs up the hill killing all of them. With CGI blood squirting out of them.

Further more this film is an escapist film, which after I got over the fact that it wouldn't really explore the fantasy elements I was ok.  So the girl escapes into her dream awesome but the dreams have nothing to do with her what's happening around her.  Its like she has dreams that are dark and the real world is dark so that makes them related not because the have repeating themes.

And honestly I feel like this movie did better because it's a foreign movie.  If it was done by an American company it would have done well, but the movie consumers or people that claim them as educated people wouldn't have seen it.  Because its simply just a great visual fantasy with some dumb plot.

All in all I felt like most of the plot devises in this film were so that the director could have his ending when the ending wasn't really that good.  But by making every thing work do that ending it ended up with some stupid plot devices.

I want to give it 2 and a half, for the acting, and the visual elements.  But for the plot I give it 1 and for the planning I give it 1.

If you want to see a good film see Spirit Of The Beehive, which is what this film is based on.  Way better, slow, but amazing.",1188345600,7,2933,4.150442477876106
7626091,5,B002BYYA9A,"If someone's complaining about how black and white characters are (and actually there are some secondary characters 'wandering' through the gray area) they are missing what this film is about. It's not about good or evil, it's about how people react to possibly harmful experiences. Some people like 'a' little girl hide in their fantasy world. The fantasy world in the film is mainly created for the viewer, an adult person. It's of little use to the little girl although she certainly seems to enjoy it. Although better then her reality it's certainly not for the squeamish either, more like a horror than a fairy tale, because even its fairies are a bit scary.

The ending is brilliant and interesting in that the viewer usually makes a choice here between fantasy and reality. What does it mean when we choose either one? Does it mean that we're firmly grounded in reality or weak? With out imagination or with too much imagination? Insensitive or oversensitive? Intelligent or silly?

7626100,4,B002BYYA9A,"""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a fantay for adults featuring the character of Greek mythology -- Pan -- that appears under its other name, Faunus, and its relationship with a young girl to whom it promises eternity if she fulfills certain fantiastic and difficult requirements. The film was made in Spain and is in Spanish with English subtitles.

Set in fascist Spain during late World War II, a girl goes with her pregnant mother to live with her new stepfather, a ruthless and vile Army captain. She meets a fairy -- a Peter Pan butterfly type fluttering around on wings of gossamer -- that takes her to the labyrinth where she meets Pan, whom the film calls faun. Pan explains to the girl the terms of her involvement and, should she fulfill these duties, she will become a princess for life. Or something like that.

She takes steps to fulfill her duty, only to regularly run into problems with hobgoblins, bizarre creatures without eyes, lots more fairies floating around, and other distractions. Fortunately, Pan provides her with magic chalk with which she can create her own door whenever she needs to escape one of these moments.

In the denouement she must take her new baby brother to the labyrinth and do something really bad with him. When she refues, the story peaks. In the meantime, bad guy stepdad and his army buddies have pretty much worn her down, offed her mom, and sent everyone she knows packing. It wasn't clear at the end of the film whether or not she had fulfilled her duty and achieved her salvation.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" is, in my opinion, a high class chick flick. It is full of magic, fantastic scenes and creatures, events that transcend reality, and its heroes are all women and the young girl that stars. The men are almost all bad guys and stepdad is the second coming of Darth Vadar.

This movie will interest a lot of people because of its fantastic and lyrical storyline and its marvelous effects. Parents of minor children should be warned there is a lot of violence in the film, much that is graphic in nature, making this far more an adult fairy tale than one for kids.",1187481600,8,2099,4.646900269541779

That is as far as I will go with the story. (just have to see it for yourself) but the movie definitely keep me watching the the end.  Was the little girl going to complete the three tasks? Was she going to save her pregnant mother from her stepfather (believe me!!! that's an understatement) Warning**** This is not for KIDS TWELVE AND UNDER.",1187481600,,832,4.437908496732026
7626102,5,B002BYYA9A,"For me, this film sort of came out of nowhere.  It's not often that a Spanish film (with subtitles, at that) becomes all the rage in America, but I just kept seeing references to this thing all over the place.  Having watched it, I can see why - it really is a wondrous, compelling, emotional cinematic experience.  Many have dubbed Pan's Labyrinth a fairy tale for adults, and I think that designation is pretty apt.  A lot of people aren't aware of the fact that many fairy tales were, in their infancy, pretty dark little stories.  As often as not, fairy tale characters did not live happily ever after at all - in some cases, they didn't even live through the stories.  This particular film features pain and anguish alongside some fairly jarring and brutal moments.  Certainly, it's not a film for the vast majority of children out there, but I see no reason in the world for it receiving an R rather than a PG-13 rating.

The central character of the story is a twelve-year-old girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), an imaginative child accompanying her very pregnant mother to the military post run by her step-father.  The year is 1944, and Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez) is there to take out the remaining anti-Franco rebels hiding out in the woodlands.  He is an exceedingly cruel and ruthless man, as the audience learns fairly early on.  With her mother bedridden, Ofelia wanders outside to follow a fairy through the ancient stone structure called Pan's Labyrinth, eventually entering a circular underground structure.  It is there that she meets an otherworldly faun (Doug Jones) and learns that she is actually a fairy princess who lost all of her old memories when she ran off to the world of humans years ago.  Before she can return to her fairy kingdom, however, she must complete three tasks to prove that she is the rightful princess.  The tasks are not easy - but, on the other hand, Ofelia's human life is not easy either.  Her step-father cares only about the impending birth of his child (which he assumes will be a son), her mother (Ariadna Gil) is basically unavailable because her pregnancy has turned into a dangerous one, and she has no one else apart from a servant named Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) who cares one iota about her.  It is not hard to see why she becomes increasingly enchanted with the idea of exchanging the miseries of human life for the joys of the fairy realm.

Running alongside Ofelia's story is that of the anti-government rebels trying to survive out in the woods, despite Capitan Vidal's attempts to horde all available sources of food and medicine.  What Vidal does not know is that rebel sympathizers are hidden amongst his own personal staff - two individuals who will emerge as the two unquestioned heroes of this entire story.  Both of these worlds eventually smash together by the end of the film, setting the stage for a bittersweet ending that leaves much to the viewer's imagination.

There's an amazing pathos to this film that might take you unawares, particularly if you are used to a steady diet of Hollywood throw-away scripts.  Pan's Labyrinth galvanizes your emotions and compels you to look beneath the surface of the mundane.  It may even rekindle that sense of wonder that you seemingly lost all those years ago.  It is truly a most glorious film.",1187481600,3,3311,4.75
7626103,3,B002BYYA9A,"I do NOT recommend children watch this movie.  What starts off as innocent fun quickly turns into extreme violence and severe swearing.  They say the F word a couple times, and there was one violent moment in particular that made me sick showing a soldier bashing a guys face in (including close-up shots of blood pouring from his face).  It was the biggest surprise of the plot, and I mean that in a BAD way.

It's supposed to be a film about fairy tales.  The war storyline is what I originally thought to be a creation as a way for children to look away from the real-life nonstop violence and find a happy place in the land of fairy tales.  Unfortunately the fantasy land the little girl in this movie explores is filled with lots of blood and a twisted, disgusting atmosphere. The war story may be unrelated to the fantasy segments, but both stories are really violent and inappropriate for children.

Some of the monsters in this game reminded me of those in video games such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil 2.  Probably a coincidence.  Especially that one monster sitting at a dinner table who didn't like it when the girl ate some grapes off the table and then proceeded to run after her.  He had eyes in his hands, just like that big monster in Resident Evil 2 had eyes in his arms.

Adults who like war movies won't find enough detail to keep them interested, and children who like fantasy elements will probably be too disgusted to really find the courage to watch Pan's Labyrinth all the way through without getting nightmares.  I have no idea what kind of person this movie was intended for.",1187395200,2,1605,4.515570934256055
7626104,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth tells the story of a young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who arrives in the Spanish countryside with her pregnant, sick mother (Ariadna Gil); they intend to live with the girl's profoundly evil and cruel stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lpez) who is in the Spanish army. Despite the fact that the Spanish Civil War is over, rebels still fight in the countryside against the Fascists and Captain Vidal runs a military outpost to eliminate his enemies.

The stress of this remarkably brutal and hostile world proves too much for young Ofelia; and she eventually escapes into a world of fantasy. In this world, based partly on a real live labyrinth near the military camp, Ofelia pretends (or believes) that a faun (Doug Jones) will give her three increasingly dangerous tasks to perform. If she succeeds, she will be rewarded by the faun: She will return to her rightful place as a princess in an underground world where she will be loved by her people and life is much more pleasant, to say the least.

The plot progresses at a good pace. As real life becomes more and more challenging and stressful, so do the imaginary tasks Ofelia must perform in order to become worthy of entering the world of paradise where she will live forever as a princess.

There won't be any plot spoilers here; but I must warn you of this: Pan's Labyrinth is no movie for squeamish people. The events and scenes are quite candid and the spoken lines are as honest and direct as people would have spoken them at the time these real life events occurred. We see many murders and there are several particularly grisly scenes with more blood in them than my community hospital keeps in storage! I briefly closed my eyes once or twice, admittedly, but I kept watching because the film proves itself to be nothing less than a masterful tour de force by all involved and a true work of fine art. The actors portray their characters very convincingly; and the choreography shines in the battle scenes in particular. Look also for a fine performance by Ofelia's only friend besides her mother, the sweet housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verd).

The DVD comes with a few extras including a commentary with the director (Guillermo del Toro) and an interactive feature that sheds extra light on the making of this fine motion picture.

In short, Pan's Labyrinth is an excellent work of fine art that we should watch and watch again for the pleasure of seeing a film that is truly top quality art. I highly recommend Pans Labyrinth for adults--and the children within us--who want to experience a film of grand proportions. Pans Labyrinth takes a serious subject and does it justice with painstaking work on the part of all who worked on it. Don't pass by this superlative motion picture--Pan's Labyrinth is more than worth its weight in gold.",1187395200,,2825,4.768916155419223
7626105,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth (El Laberinto del Fauno, 2006) is a Spanish film, through and through. The copy I rented from Netflix is only available in Spanish with subtitles, but it is more than the language that makes this movie Spanish. The film is a period piece, set in Franco's Spain in 1944 but it is more than the location that makes this movie Spanish.

The actors, with the exception of Doug Jones who plays the Faun (del Toro did not intend the character to be the very sexual Pan because he felt it would be inappropriate to pair Pan and a small child), are all from Spain and speak beautifully accented Spanish (Jones learned archaic Spanish for his role and performs it with a gorgeous, rich accent that is not quite castillian Spanish but not quite belonging to any variety of Latino Spanish either) but it is not the actors or their lovely accents that make this movie Spanish.

Pan's Labyrinth is a Spanish film all the way to the bones. The harsh beauty of the magical realism fairy tale beats at the heart of Guillermo del Toro's story. The movie is simultaneously fresh yet reminiscent of the great novels of Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez and Laura Esquivel.

The cinematography is understated and elegant, evoking a distant time through use of silvery faded color. The soundtrack is haunting and the subtitles are clear (I was impressed with the translation and later learned that the director no longer trusts translators and thus did the subtitles himself) and readable yet largely unobtrusive. There is violence in the movie, but only one scene that shocked me. (I regularly watch movies like Saw and Hostel while eating dinner for reference on my shockability.) The atmosphere is mysterious and sad. The movie left me painfully satisfied.

If you are a lover of things dark and mysterious, of changeling children and a long-lost home far away, of frightening beauty in a war-torn world, of the majesty of fairy tales . . . if you love these things you will likely love Pan's Labyrinth as well.",1187222400,2,2012,4.789625360230548

7626107,4,B002BYYA9A,"I really enjoyed this movie, however, I felt the violence went a little too far. I really don't need to be beat over the head to feel anger toward an antogonist.  I understand the story had violent elements and that indeed the violence was inherent to the story, but some parts seemed to be in there for the effects/shock value, edging on torture porn.

Remember being scared by things offered in shadow or around corners? Our own imaginations are often much more exciting/frightening than what is on screen. This is sort of the whole point of the movie. The director, though, must feel his imaginination is better than ours and we get his version.

Also, while it was a little heavy handed with the development of some characters, other characters didn't have enough background.  I really feel if I have identified with characters when I can remember their names the next day.  I can only remember 2 of the ones in this movie.  And the scenes that remain in my mind are generally the shockingly violent ones.

It is a pity because this was so close to being a great movie.  The story is basically good, the actors are well cast, and the progression was not predictable.  The visuals are stunning.  To me the characters needed a little more motivation/development.  It doesn't have to be some grand scene (violent or otherwise).  All good characters have a little bad in them and vice versa, that makes them real.

Sometime a single sentence spoken by a character can really make a viewer understand them.  That kind of writing isn't here, it is dependent on the visuals.  An as example, I don't understand why the girl went so far to carry out tasks, but then simply disobeyed an order by Faun.  It really was a key point that was poorly stuck in the movie.  If you have seen it you will know exactly the scene I mean.  Like a snag in a sweater.

Overall, I think that you will enjoy watching it. Many movies don't even entice a viewer to think or to even write a review.  This one will. Watch it...an argue about it...write a review about how great or bad it was...tell me how wrong I am.  That is part of the fun of movies.  A-",1187136000,4,2130,4.477922077922078

In its combination of fantasy and ""reality"" the film evokes comparison to the Harry Potter series and the films of Peter Jackson - so it's not as original as it might think it is - (check out the mandrakes for a start!)...and one is left wondering exactly what point the filmmakers were trying to make.",1186704000,3,524,5.011494252873563
7626113,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is an amazing film directed by Guillermo Del Toro.  It manages to capture the essence of being a child appropriately enough to serve as nostalgia for its adult audience.  In other words, you really don't have to be a fantasy geek to appreciate this.  It is smaller than many of the larger epic fantasies we have grown accustomed to seeing on the big screen over the last few years (i.e. Lord of the Rings, the Harry Potter movies) but in many ways it is more lucid, and it is certainly less diluted by oceans of CGI. There are great effects though; puppets, CGI, makeup, set design and costumes.  However, I would say that more effort than money was put into these elements and creating a pure vision was certainly the priority, as opposed to creating a large box-office draw. Del Toro also has the advantage of placing the fantasy into the eyes of a child, while the rest of story is told in the miserable reality of 1944 post civil war Spain.  That dichotomy alone makes the film both remarkably authentic and the fantasy elements that much more rewarding.  What child wouldn't want to escape that existence?

As the film opens we are introduced to a fairy tale about Princess Moanna from the underworld.  The Princess decides to see the world above her and when she does she forgets about her royal existence and eventually becomes mortal and dies.  Her father, the king, believes her spirit will return.  After this we go to 1944 Spain after the Francoists have taken power.  We are introduced to Ofelia (Ivan Baquero), a young girl whose pregnant mother has brought Ofelia to meet her new stepfather (Sergi Lpez), a fascist captain assigned to control and destroy the Spanish Maquis in that region.  He is also the father to Ofelia's unborn brother.  Ofelia meets an insect who she feels represents a fairy.  The insect leads Ofelia to the labyrinth.  This spirals into Ofelia's eventual interaction with a faun who declares that Ofelia is Princess Moanna and in order to ensure that her essence as princess of the underworld is intact, she must accomplish three specific tasks.  The story goes from there with astounding visuals and sequences that range from shocking and suspenseful, to beautiful and beaming with hope.

In a year of mediocre cinema, Pan's Labyrinth was one of the few stand-out productions for me.  Obviously it was heavily acclaimed and rewarded for its visuals, but the writing and direction deserve accolades as well.  This is one of best original screenplays to come along in the last few years.

The acting was also great. Ivana Baquero is a wonderful new find and Maribel Verd (Y tu mam tambin) was also fantastic as one of the captain's maids and a rebel mole.  I also believe that Captain Vidal was probably the best villain of the year.  Part of it was Sergi Lpez's performance but it was also the way his actions shocked us.  Without his violent outbursts and constant cutthroat disposition I think this would've been a lesser movie, but it also may have received a more profitable PG-13 rating.  In other words, it took some courage and sacrifice in making this villain as brutal as he was and I salute Del Toro for not even giving that perspective consideration.  Again, it's artistic substance as the priority.

Overall, Pan's Labyrinth is the kind of effort that reminds me of why I love cinema, and I have no doubt that Del Toro and his crew feel that a story like this is the very reason they make movies in the first place.  Obviously, I highly recommend this.",1186704000,9,3518,4.705882352941177
7626114,3,B002BYYA9A,"Good and evil work in fairy tales but fail in historical dramas. This film mixes the two, with great success in certain departments, but in others, it disappoints. Clearly, the Spanish Civil War will live in the hearts of liberals to the end of time, always depicted in the same way , with virtuous liberals fighting depraved fascists. It is easy to turn the audience against the fascists; they commit terrible crimes like being mean to children, and even meaner to the cute children's lovely mommies. But how can you get the audience to love a cipher? For myself, I couldn't have cared less about the heroes in the woods, and of course I hated with snarling father in his Darth Vadar uniform. Instead, I grew intrigued by the goofy fairy tale animals which resembled the kind of weird creatures in Star Wars, only here they live underground and are menacing. Still, I loved the monster guarding the banquet table and thought his hand-embedded eye balls a real treat. Over all, though, I hated the Spanish resistance members for their goodness as much as I hated the fascists for their cruelty. The whole lot were losers. The story was numbingly predictable and unenlightening. Like the Cold War struggles in America between the evil McCarthyites and the virtuous Hollywood liberals, this tale will continue to be told as long as intellectual go into the arts, but for God sake won't somebody finally realize that the audience has moved on?",1186617600,2,1440,4.810483870967742

I found myself mesmerized by not only the story, the characters, the music, and the beauty of the film - that I could not only follow the subtitles but got immersed in the movie. I actually watched it twice in 2 days. There is only 1 part in the movie that was a little too gorrish for me [SPOILER] - and that is when the ""captain"" approaches a father and son... Trust me and look away as the father/son (can't remember), gets his nose bashed in by the captain and it's a bit too realistic for me. (39 yrs old and am getting sick of realistic gore). Other than that... it is an amazing movie. Rent it.... I bet you'll buy it. :) Hope this helps! It's just IMO. ~ Best",1186531200,2,770,4.20945945945946
7626116,5,B002BYYA9A,"Every once in a while, we get the opportunity to watch a film that shows what can be done when artistry is used in the way it is intended to be used. In this uncompromising movie, Guillermo del Toro goes all out to deliver a fairy tale that grabs the viewer's emotions and takes them on a rollercoaster ride. The R rating already indicates that this is not your typical fairy tale, but instead it is more in line with the more classic fairy tales of the past, like the uncensored tales by the Brothers Grimm.

Our main character, Ofelia, is a girl in her early teens who loves to read fairy tales and has a most vivid imagination. At the beginning of the story, she is traveling with her pregnant mother, Carmen, to meet with Captain Vidal in an encampment in the Spanish countryside. The Civil War has ended, but there are still guerrillas fighting for the Republic, and Vidal's task is to help annihilate them. He has forced Carmen to come join him because he is the father of the unborn child and wants the birth to occur in his presence; he completely disregards the dangers of the journey for Carmen in such a late stage of her pregnancy. This is just a glimpse into the Captain's personality, which will be revealed as the movie progresses.

Ofelia lost her father in the Civil War, and now uses her fantasy world to endure the situation in which she is in, a mother debilitated by the pregnancy, and a stepfather that is an ogre. She creates an imaginary world based on a book she read and on a stone labyrinth by the military camp. In her fantasy, she meets a faun, who gives her three tasks to carry before the full moon. By completing these, she will become a princess. During these tasks, Ofelia faces monsters that she does not dare face in the real world, and we are exposed to a plot full of cleverly created metaphors.

As the fantasy progresses, the clear line between good and bad in the real versus the fantasy world, starts to blur. The story gets darker and there is a fair amount of violence involved. I do not think that the use of this violence is excessive though, since it helps communicate the full extent of the evil behind some of the characters.

Besides the great story and masterful direction, this film presents us with enchanting music and neat make-up and wardrobe displays. On top of that, the actors perform their roles convincingly, especially in the cases of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). Baquero's performance is on par with some other great performances by kids in the past, such as Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood. Lopez is so good in his role that you feel like grabbing him out of the screen and beating him senseless. I highly recommend this movie, it is a masterpiece!",1186444800,4,2739,4.527272727272727
7626117,5,B002BYYA9A,"I won't waste your time outling the plot of this film, since so many reviewers before me have done that so well.  What I will say is this is a truly remarkable film that effortlessly fuses a beautiful fairy tale with the harsh and foreboding realities of Franco-era fascism in Spain.  The hope of humanity is pinned on the discipline and curiosity of a young girl as she discovers her magical past as a luminous princess, and earns her way back into the immortal life from which she came.  The parallels to Christianity and the resurrection of Christ are pretty obvious, but do not impair the magic of this wonderful tale.  A highly recommended film, but probably not suitable for young children.",1186358400,3,696,4.680327868852459
7626118,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is a true masterwork of fantasy storytelling.  This has the same sprit of ""Tideland"" and what the film ""Mirror mask"" should have been. Pan's Labyrinth, like other for-mentioned films, relies on the imagination of a young girl and the innocence of youth and how that innocence can overcome great strife, chaos and misery.  Pan's Labyrinth is brutal without being overly graphic and creepy with making you too uncomfortable.  The creepiest parts are not with the fantasy characters but the scene with the Tyrant Stepfather.

This movie is not ""Lord of the Rings"" fantasy and really does a lot with very little.  It's a great mesh of a reality period piece set in the 1940's and a fantasy epic with strange creatures. This is the best foreign language film of 2006 and one of the best films you'll see from the last year.  Del Toro created a masterpiece in a heartfelt story about a young girl trying to make since of her world and do what's right for her ailing mother.

The fact that this movie almost didn't get made is amazing in it's self.  Due to productions costs and financial problems that required the director /producer to not only cut out his own salary but invest his own money on top of that to get this project off the ground.  You can see why the director felt so passionately about this film and wanted to see his vision come to fruition.

Instead of watching an inspired fable, I was subjected to scenes of graphic beatings, tortures, and shootings. This was not a dark fantasy with realistic war elements; it was a brutal story of inhumanity with small doses of fantasy thrown into the mix.

I'm no prude - I can stomach violence and gore if it serves the overall story. In this case, I could find little to redeem the explicit violence and bleak storyline.

7626121,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth was definitely one of the best, if not the best movie of the year. It's a foreign film, so it might be difficult for slow readers to understand and follow the dialogue/story if you don't speak Spanish. I have a Spanish friend who saw it and said that the translations on the captions were very accurate. I can speak a little Spanish and could actually understand parts of it.

The story is a simple one when explained, yet rich with detail and complex when you get into it. It's about a young girl (Ofelia) who's mother is married to and pregnant with the baby of a general in the Spanish army after the Spanish civil war. They move to an outpost in the woods and Ofelia discovers the labyrinth and the faun that guards it. Since she's always liked fairy tales, she becomes engrossed with completing her quests into a bizarre parellel world, while still having to deal with her mother's illness, the skepticism of others, and the cruelty of her stepfather. The peaceful fairy world is in sharp contrast to the civil war that is going on all around it. Since it is a coming of age story, the 'imaginary' world symbolizes the innocence and beauty of childhood, while the war that everyone else is caught up in shows how turbulent and difficult it is to be an adult.

It's considered a ""fairy tale"" although in this one the fairies get their heads bitten off, monsters kill and eat little children, and people get tortured and shot. All unlike a Disney movie. It is a 'dark' fairy tale, and probably not suited for small children since there is blood, detailed violence, and cursing (in Spanish). If I had seen this when I was 6, I would have been horrified.

The end is bittersweet (no spoilers here!) and leaves you with the question of whether of not the fantasy world of Ofelia was real, and I always find myself smiling with tearing running down my face. It's a movie you'll probably want to watch over and over because it's so good and there will be things you didn't catch the first time around.

I also highly recommend the soundtrack if you liked the movie! It has beautiful music that really captures the essence of the story.",1186099200,,2149,4.530927835051546
7626122,3,B002BYYA9A,"Yes, it has layers of interpretation and meaning.

Yes, the cinematography is beautiful.

Yes, I'm glad filmmakers from all over the world are making use of Hollywood's special efffects boon.

The puzzle, however, is this:  if all these people see Pan's Labyrinth"" as ""astounding"" ""astonishing"" ""glorious"", and  overwhelmingly complex"" -- then what have they been watching lately?

There is no question that there are films in the last 5-7 years that have taken complexity to an all new level.  But this movie probably won't make that list.  It is a beautiful film -- and informs most of us of a history we never learned in school or at our grandfather's knee.  It is also beautiful as a psychological piece, and even as semi-alegorical fantasy.

But at its heart, it really only manages to tell the history, albeit rendered as hard non-fiction overlayed with mythic fantasy.  Still -- that makes it only what it is -- a look through a looking glass we haven't been shown before.  And considering what we know of WWII, it doesn't carry the weight of shock and awe that it might have 40 years ago.

What keeps the ""layers"" from standing on their own separate feet is that there is never any doubt that the mythic and fantastical elements are all inside a child's head.  There is never a moment when we think the fantasy is actually the solid part of the story.  Had the fantasy been constructed as a truly magical world, then the horror of reality at the end might have been actual horror.  As is, it is just one more confirmation that we have been watching a sad, lonely, depressed and abused girl escaping into the safety of her own mind.

It is a highly respectable film -- as far as it goes.  It has a lyric pace and emotional tone that sets it apart from many other fantasy films -- but like all those German ""Neverending""-movies, it takes its purpose and mission far too seriously to actually be enjoyable or likeable.  It is not a ""see again and again"" movie, which is what I was encouraged to hope for from all the reviews and critical hoo-rahs.

One caveat, however.  I've heard the filmmaker talk about this movie twice, now, and I am persuaded that he, like so many in the world, has a different mythos playing in his unconscious than the average American.  Or even the well-read, well-considered American.  The culture  which constructed his childhood is not the same ""global-culture"" in which he (nor we) now resides.  And they are far from the mythos of the Grimms  Hans Christian Anderson, Oscar Wilde and Walt Disney that filled my childhood.  That being so, I am sure that the mythos resinating in his child's memory and unconscious is the one filling Pan's Labyrinth -- and so those with the same childhood culture probably see much more depth in this film than those with another childhood culture.

And for that audience, Pan's Labyrinth may very well be astonishing and amazing.",1186012800,3,2898,4.685148514851485

The movie's reality Fascist Spain in the aftermath of the civil war is unspeakably brutal, but the fantasy world that lures our heroine in is equally terrifying and uncompromising. There was some terrific acting, and characters you could love as well as some sumptuous scenes, but the general tone is dark and verges on gothic.
By the end I was weeping great buckets of tears for innocence and courage and thrilling vicious vengeance.

7626131,5,B002BYYA9A,"It has been some weeks since I viewed Pan's Labyrinth, and the movie is still 'in my mind'.  Quite simply, this movie is awesome.  The dark fantasy elements mesh seamlessly (to me at least) with the elements of reality.

The 'real world' setting is post Civil War Spain (1944) where a small group of rebels fights on rural Spain. Ofelia and her mother Carmen, move to the mill where her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (whose mission is to crush the rebels), has his headquarters.

Ofelia, who is fascinated by fairy tales, discovers an overgrown, tumbledown labyrinth. In the heart of the labyrinth she meets Pan, an ancient satyr who claims to know her true identity and her secret destiny. First, she must complete three tasks before the moon grows full.  Time is running out, for Ofelia and for the rebels, and both need to battle hardship and cruelty in order to gain their freedom.

But, who can be trusted in such dangerous times? Is Pan telling the truth...? And if not, who is?

The English subtitles (the  dialogue is in Spanish) actually enhance the experience of being involved in what could be termed a gothic fairy tale for adults.  The cinematography is very good and this is most assuredly not a movie for children.  In Australia, the DVD is rated as 'MA - Not suitable for people under 15.  Under 15s must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian'.

Highly recommended, but not for the squeamish.

7626132,5,B002BYYA9A,"I understand that most people would like this movie to be all about the fantastical side of moviemaking, however that is not the point of this film. The point is that as children, we do believe in the possibilities of magic,fairies, beautiful kingdoms in far away lands (I suppose you could say as children we believe in any possibility), however the 'harsher' brutalities of life (can, and sadly usually do) erode our sense of wonderment. Adults confirm and transmit limitations of thought (onto children and themselves) and these thoughts and actions  'create' the world around them.

The balancing of this, I believe, is brilliantly portrayed through this film. For instance, the serene beauty of the woodlands(I'm refering to the way this is shot with the petals blowing through the air, and the rich sepias and greens) is not even noticed by the adults, and it is only the child who 'notices' the stone markers. Honestly, Pan's Labyrinth is not a 'feelgood' movie, yet it is not intended to be. Pan's Labyrinth is a darkly entwined reflection upon the force of belief and what some refer to as morality, the 'reality' we choose to believe in and participate in. As far as the movie being 'slow' or 'boring', I found the movie anything but that, as the charachters were engrossing and the balance of the 'fantasy' and the 'reality' well paced.",1185494400,4,1347,4.852173913043479

The fantasy portions of the movie are captivating and are not overly gruesome unlike scenes I have seen in Harry Potter movies.  The problem is the storyline is so thin I feel insulted that the director would actually think an intelligent audience would fall for it.  Not to give away specific scenes in the movie, but there are too many instances where the characters act not according to normal human instincts or behavior.  For instance if you are told not to do something as your life depends on it, a rational human would not do it, this is just one of many occasions where I felt the story was forcing the plot to go a certain way it normally wouldn't if the situation be played out was actually occurring.

7626139,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is set along the woods in 1944 Spain. Ofelia, the main character, is forced to move into a large house along the woods, because her mother, Carmen, is pregnant with Captian Vidal's child and he wants his unborn child near him.  Vidal is a cold-hearted, unmerciful character, the epitome of heartlessness and the entire lack of any compassion. He only cares about his unborn son, and not Carmen (his wife and mother of his child) and Ofelia (his step-daughter). Well, Ofelia finds out she has the soul of the Princess Moanna, a princess in a world outside our reality. However, as the fawn, or El Fauno says, Ofelia has to complete three tasks to actually return to her kingdom. Ofelia finds solace in her mother, but the Ofelia's situation is grim, especially since her stepfather is a shell of a human devoid of any emotions, her mother is incapacitated due to complications with her pregancy, and the house in which they reside lies along the woods where Vidal's troops are fighting resistance fighters. Danger meets Ofelia in the human world and as she struggles to fulfill her three magical tasks.
The film has amazing special effects and characters, such as the fairies, el fauno, and the pale man. Ofelia's only solace from her dreary life is the prospect of entering this fairy world. You will both cry and smile at the ending. The cinematography is amazing. I strongly recommend Pan's Labyrinth, because you will become entirely enveloped in the plot, and though the film is entirely in Spanish with the exception of English subtitles, it only adds to the story.
The special features are also interesting, especially the dvd comics that describe the backstory of el fauno, the pale man, and the giant toad.
One note of caution: this is not meant for children. Captain Vidal is a violent man, and his military interrogation skills would be considered major violations of the Geneva Convention, if you get my drift (and if you didn't I mean very bloody scenes that make you weep for his victims.)

The fantasy world the movie brings to us through the eyes of a young girl is detailed and fantastic, like faerie tales of old.  Where the movie fails is in bringing us anything else: no tale of struggle against oppression, no tale of courage, no hero or heroine, nothing that will allow you to get up from the movie and feel anything remotely happy about life, the world or humanity in general.  It's a sordid tale about a sordid person getting away with sordid deeds and in the end, just about everyone has died a cruel, heartless, unredeemed death after living an unfulfilling life.  While some fans of this movie may claim that Disney movies are pure tripe and failures at art, this movie goes too far the other direction, delivering a horrible story with some fantastic artwork.

7626142,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is a movie that brings to life images and stories that are best described from the books of Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung.

First there are no spoiler alerts since this is a type of movie you want to see  again and again. Not wanting to know what happened would be like saying, ""don't tell me the plot of The Passion of the Christ because I haven't read the book yet"".

There are different ways of viewing this movie but it would be unbearable to only see it from the point of view of reality. The unrelenting violence and the cruel fate of Ofelia would make the movie too dark to watch. Instead, this is a movie about a young girl's personal mythology which brings her redemption and salvation on a mythic level.

Note that there seems to be an intentional absence of reference to institutional religion,  in the real world. Western religion, science and modern secular thinking prevent most people  from ""getting"" this movie. But if it gets you, it will haunt you deeply.

The story opens as it will end, with Ofelia lay dying from a gunshot wound from her stepfather, the evil Captain Vidal. In her dying moment, she dreams the story of a princess  who escaped from the Underworld in order to see what  life is. As the story is told,  the princess forgets she is an immortal deity  and dies as a mortal in the real world. Her father-king vows to wait for his daughter's return to the Underworld until the earth stops spinning .

The real world is revealed in scenes of violence and torture that are too painful to watch. Captain Vidal is the leader of a group of Facist soldiers who are fighting a group of rebel fighters in a dark and dreary land deep in the woods. Ofelia and her mother have traveled from a city to be with Captain Vidal at his post so that he can witness the birth of his son.

While at this post one night, Ofelia is led by a fairy to meet a deity named Pan in a labyrinth which  is beside the house she is staying at. Pan is an earth faun who has been searching for the spirit of the princess in the real world and thinks Ofelia might be her incarnation. Ofelia must perform three tasks before the next full moon in order to prove this is true.

Her first task is to defeat a toad like monster that lives in the roots of an old tree. This she does and is rewarded with a key. It is also a scene that suggests a start of the rebirth that will transform her mortal identity into a deity.

Her next task is to defeat another monster who sits at the head of a dinner table. She is warned by Pan not to eat any food during this time. And she goes and eats two grapes at the dinner table of the monster. She has failed in her tasks and will now be cut off from the Underworld forever.

Meanwhile in the real world, things are looking even grimmer. Ofelia's only friend, the housekeeper, has been captured as a rebel spy,  and her mother is sick and in pain from her pregnancy. Captain Vidal has discovered Ofelia had put a magic plant-root under her mother's bed in order to cure her mother's sickness. Her mother throws the root into a fireplace and tells Ofelia to stop dreaming and live in the real world. Her mother then goes into labor and dies giving birth to her son. Ofelia has  been cast down into the basement by Captain Vidal. The rebels begin there attack on the post.

Pan gives Ofelia a second chance. She is to bring her new born brother to Pan in order to make a small blood offering. Ofelia goes and gets the baby and brings the baby but she is followed by her evil stepfather into the labyrinth. She refuses Pan's order to hand him the baby so that a blood offering can be made so that she can return to the Underworld. The stepfather shoots Ofelia and takes the baby.

The movie ends as it began, with Ofelia bleeding and dying. The houskeeper weeps over her as we hear Ofelia's song. Ofelia dreams she is re-united with her real father-king and her mother as a princess of the Underworld.

In order to give Ofelia's life meaning you want to believe,
... there is a moment at the labyrinth's alter when the pain and suffering of the real world and the rapture of the
Underworld intersect, and Ofelia is right in the center of it all, transformed from a living incarnation of the spirit of a princess back into a deity for all eternity ...

7626148,5,B002BYYA9A,"This is a great independent foreign film set in rural Spain around 1944.  Pan's Labyrinth is a Drama/Thriller Fantasy that's rated R and filmed in Spanish in its entirety.

It's about a little girl Ofelia who travels with her sick pregnant mother Carman to live with her new Stepfather Vidal, a merciless army officer.  Vidal brings his new family to live in an abandoned mill where he can better, find conspirators and informers to persecute.

Vidal despises Ofelia and her first impression of his exceptional cruelty becomes obvious.  With her mothers ongoing illness Ofelia becomes more cut off from the love and security she new and finds a world that exists beneath the mill.

Within the labyrinth Ofelia hopes to save her mother, her unborn brother and herself from the brutality of the world above.

Although heartbreaking, and perhaps hard for some to watch Pan's Labyrinth is an exceptional dark, sad and moving film that easily illustrates the innocence of children any place in the world (Darfur, Iraq, etc) using there imagination and fantasy in dealing with unspeakable atrocities.

I loved this film.  Like most independent films it is devoid of Hollywood's constant regurgitation of mainstream, politically correct, censored depictions of  society.

Pan's Labyrinth is in your face and doesn't hold anything back.  It doesn't condone violence but shows what Ofelia goes through.  There is hope and or surrender into fantasy.

7626153,4,B002BYYA9A,"I've heard this movie compared to J. R. R. Tolkien. I wish reviewers would stop doing that. I had really high hopes for this movie and, sadly, I was pretty let down as a result of that.

Oh, it's good enough, it has wonderful visuals, an engaging storyline, a fascinating snippet of historical data, it's beautifully done and definitely worth watching. It's not worth $30 though. It's definitely worth $8.50 or $2.99 or whatever your local theater or video store charge. And it's definitely a movie to take a girl who likes fairy tales to. But, frankly, if you want good fantasy, you can pick up The Dark Crystal, or Labrinth or the other one in that vein for cheaper.

And that, really, was my fundamental complaint with the movie. The plotline seemed more deep than it turned out to be. The historical details were mostly irrelevant to the central fairy tale, this could have been done the exact same way, in just about any country in the world, at just about any time in the last 200 years. And perhaps would have been more interesting if it had. The historical sub-plot mostly just distracted from the, unfortunately, more interesting fairy tale, rather than complimenting it by contrasting it, as I presume the director/writer intended.

And as a result of the historical sub-plot, I felt like the fairy tale itself was stolen from and thus, ended up being far less of the magical experience it could have been, had it not had to vie for screen time with a pretty boring (unless you're a big history geek) sub-plot. I would compare it to Stargate, the movie. Where they introduce all these cool characters and creatures and devices and then run out of time to do anything truly cool with them. So by the end of the movie, you find yourself feeling...unfulfilled.

This is not to say I didn't like the movie. The visuals are spectacular, the graphics, landscapes and creatures are stunning and fantastic, the acting is top notch, the cinematography is magnificent, there's a golden glow to bright sunny days and a grey chill to darkness or incliment weather, the directing is perfect. The overall tone of the fairy tale is far more like Grimm's than Disney's. This movie is truly worth watching. It's just that you feel like you only got 80-90% of what you should have gotten, at the end. There's so much promise here, another 10 or 20 million dollars and 45 minutes could have made this one of the finest movies made in the last 10 years, easily.

7626156,5,B002BYYA9A,"In war torn Spain there lived a young girl named Ofelia, who loved to read fairy tales.  She moves to the country with her pregnant mother, to live with her stepfather Captain Vidal.  The Captain is not a nice man, in fact he is evil, spending his time torturing captives and waiting for his son to be born.

Ofelia has a secret world, a world of fairies and fauns.  When a faun appears to her inside the labyrinth, which is part of the grounds of the mill she has come to live in, he informs her that she is a lost princess, and must perform three tasks to prove she is not a mere mortal.  Ofelia readily accepts the tasks, and the Book Of The Crossroads that the faun gives her.  From the book she learns her tasks to be filled before the next full moon.

'Pans Labyrinth' is a dark fairy tale, not one for the kiddies.  I finished the movie and immediately watched it again.  The faun FX was extremely well done.  The thing at the banquet table was sumptuously disgusting, creepy as all get-up.  I think I'm in love with it.

The war story and the bad captain left me feeling shades of 'Shindler's List' inside the story, and I remembered the warm-up of David Bowie's 'Labyrinth', now all grown up into a big-boy movie.  It brought to mind the McFarlane Twisted Fairy Tales figures that sit on my shelf watching me as I write this.  It also smelled faintly of 'City Of Lost Children' but perhaps that's simply because it was twisted and subtitled.

The acting is excellent, the photography stunning, and the dream breathes the fetid breath of imagination.  Del Toro leaves it up to the viewer whether or not Ofelia's world was real or in her head.  And what was that thing that came out of the toad's mouth?

My only complaint with the movie would be that it needed more Labyrinth and less war.  This is a superb movie for the horror or dark fantasy lover, worthy of a purchase.  Enjoy!",1184198400,23,1889,4.373563218390805

IT IS HOWEVER AN ADULT FANTASY THAT, SOMEHOW DESPITE THE MANY GRUESOME SHOCKS, I FOUND NECESSARY TO BE PLAYED OUT THIS WAY. ADULTS ARE TOO BURIED IN REALITY TO EVER IMAGINE SUCH A FANTASTICAL ADVENTURE, EVEN IN TIMES OF PURE EVIL, WHEN WE NEED THE ESCAPE THE MOST.

THE STORY BEGINS WITH A DISPLACED SPANISH GIRL NAMED OFELIA MOVING, WITH HER PREGNANT NEWLYWED MOTHER, TO THE COMPOUND OF HER TRULY SADISTIC WARLORD STEPFATHER. THIS PLACE BREATHES NOTHING BUT SORROW AND PAIN, AND HER DESPAIR AND LONELINESS IS SURPRISINGLY BROKEN BY MAGICAL CREATURES WHO SHARE WITH HER, HER TRUE DESTINY.

THIS IS WHERE THE FILM ACTUALLY BECOMES MORE COMPLEX AND INVENTIVE. OFELIA DOESNT GET WHISKED AWAY ON HER ADVENTURE. INSTEAD HER ADVENTURE IS TIED TO THE MISERY WHICH IS HER REAL LIFE. HER NEW ESCAPE, GIVES HER NO ESCAPE AT ALL. NOT UNTIL THE SURREAL END. HER STEPFATHER IS TRULY AS VILE A VILLAIN AS I'VE SEEN RECENTLY, BUT HE IS BALANCED BY AN EQUALLY ASTUTE MAID, WHOM I CAN BEST DEFINE AS THE GOOD AND THE EVIL IN OFELIA'S WORLD, EVEN THOUGH THEY AREN'T REALLY DRAWN WITH THAT BLACK AND WHITE A COLOR.

7626158,3,B002BYYA9A,"I knew going into ""Pan's Labyrinth"" that it wasn't ""Bridge to Tarabithia"", so I was immune to the disappointment felt by some viewers about what kind of film this is. Even with no prior knowledge, it quickly becomes clear to the viewer that this is a film largely about brutality and war, and about dealing with harsh reality.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" is set in the fascist Spain of Francisco Franco, and revolves around the experience of Ofelia, a young girl who moves with her mother to live with the brutal Capitan Vidal, whom her mother has just recently married.

Ofelia's mother views her marriage to Vidal as a necessary accommodation to  harsh reality. Ofelia finds ways to cope with her increasingly brutish world by retreating into fantasy.

This could have been one of those films where the ""reality"" of Ofelia's fantasy world is ambiguous. I do not believe that is the case here, and I do not think the viewer is supposed to wonder about what exactly is going on in that respect.

There is a theme in this film having to do with following orders, and how refusal to do so is the mark of humanity, but I found that theme to be a little muddled. Even so, the vision of the film makes it worth watching, and there are some particularly captivating scenes, especially an eye-less monster that apparently eats children.",1184112000,4,1320,4.672413793103448

An evil Captain wants to wipe out the commie partisans in his sector, but obstacles are placed before him by the altruistic housekeeper and physician of his compound, sited somewhere in a wooded area of Spain, in 1944. He also wants his male child to be born there with him, at all costs, including that of the mother's life, if necessary, he tells the doctor.

A little girl, his stepdaughter, wants to see her mother's pregnancy-gone-bad come to a happy end, as well as find her own bliss, but crosses an exceedingly thin line between fantasy and reality, or psychosis and the brutality of living.

The Captain ruthlessly murders any partisans--or even suspects whom he finds, and mistreats virtually everyone else not wearing the same uniform he does. He makes ordinary ""evil"" look like a Girl Scout cookie sale.

The little girl becomes involved with a Faun, of dubious character--bad--good--what is it--who lives in a subterranean labyrinth, which we don't see much of, faeries, a magic book, a very scary monstrosity who forever dines at an untouchable banquet, and a horrible enchanted toad who deadens the roots of a great and mystic tree.

So, we have two story lines, several Heroines/Heroes, and one very bad Nemesis, all working toward a final and central denouement which is handled with a startling lack of sentimentality, and a twist that left me wondering.

The two plots merge for the denouement, via the newborn baby, whom everyone wants for their own end: the little girl, the evil Captain, the housekeeper, and even the Faun.

The director never shows us for certain whether the little girl imagines everything that is magical, or it is all somehow real. I would like to think that by leaving out the True of it, as such an obviously open question, it was all real.

However, in the same manner, the question's white-hot and glaring lack of resolution seems a cop-out. I think the ending needed a tad more development to make the central question more tastily nebulous.

A Spanish language film, Labyrinth is the darker more sinister sister of The Chronicles of Narnia. It is a haunting allegory set in an unlikely place - if you pay attention you can see the Biblical references and follow the line all the way to the end, where it becomes less subtle.

If you're not into that 'stuff', it's okay - it's still a magical ride that is also a bit of a mystery. The visual effects are understated and lack the 'look at me' Hollywood glamour, makes them all the more attractive.

The backdrop of the story adds historical realism and another layer to follow but complements the underlying meaning of this paradoxical tale of light and darkness.

To be honest, my attitude towards Pan went from skeptical to acceptance. I honestly, thought Pan was out to get Ofelia as if he were the Devil incarnate.

I give it 5 stars because it's truly an original and imaginative film, but I was disappointed we didn't encounter more ghouls and ghosts within the labyrinth and see more of the labyrinth. The story focused too much on the captain and his brutality rather than Pan's labyrinth.

It was 2 stories within 1 film. On the one side, you have Ofelia's step-dad, a cruel Spanish captain, and on the other hand, you have Ofelia, a young, innocent child who is trying to escape the terrible events that surround her at every corner.

7626183,5,B002BYYA9A,"I have to say I am surprised by those reviewers that dismissed this movie because of the violence, and I disagree about the ""shock value""  of the scene. There was only one truly brutal scene, shot in the dark, and more suggestive than graphic.  The rest of the violence is reflected mostly in Vidal's threats, since by then we know what he's capable of doing. Also, few make mention of the magnificent acting which humanized the sadistic character of Vidal, and of the artistic rendering of the fairy world, which fortunately leaves Disney-esque cuteness behind and is rather reminiscent of Dali's disturbing surrealism.

I think the best part of the movie was the intricate storyline, the juxtaposition of two parallel realities, and their relationship to one another.  I'm not one to appreciate ambiguous endings, but in this case, the choice the viewer has to make is resonant with the message of the film: the choice between fanatical ideology, (which has no trouble destroying lives because it does not see living beings, but embodied ideas), and the creative power of imagination and compassion, which is dismissed as surreal by those who see the harshness of life as ""practical"" and even ""pragmatic"", is posed before us on the most subconscious level in every moment of our lives.  Thus at the end the viewer is invited to make this choice for him/herself: the two ""realities"" are fatally incompatible and may never co-exist.  The ending transcends the gimmick and instead touches us personally, because when we question Ophelia, we learn that we, too, have already made the worst of the two choices, that we have already chosen by default to inhabit Vidal's cruel and indifferent reality.  We mourn not for Ophelia, but for the loss of our own innocence, for the sacrifice of our imagination to the demands of pragmatic life.  The film could have easily been maudlin and cliched, but it managed instead to be achingly lyrical.  As for the brutality of the sadist, it is a necessary contrast to the fantastical world of fairies: it is the appropriate moral opposite.  In fact, when I think of the brutality of an idelogical war, I think the movie was mild by contrast to reality.

This was a beautiful film, and I'm pleasantly surprised to see that it touched the shores of the mainstream in spite of the fact that it is subtitled.",1183161600,2,2338,4.849246231155779
7626184,5,B002BYYA9A,"After much insistence from, well, everyone I finally watched Pan's Labyrinth. It's an intriguing tale of a girl caught up in the fascist regime of 1944 Spain. Her mother marries a violent lunatic in the military and moves to the mountains as the regime combats the last of the rebels. Fancifully intertwined with this is the girl's love for fairy tales. The juxtaposition of her imaginary/real world with the violence of the time period is definitely intriguing. The one part I disliked about the movie is a lot of the violence was graphic and seemed really unnecessary.",1183075200,,570,4.88659793814433
7626185,4,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is a combination of fantasy, drama, and tragedy.  Young Ofelia is a daughter of a widow, Carmen, who has remarried to a brutal Franco supporter in WWII Spain, Captain Vidal.  Daughter and mother go to live in the countryside headquarters of the captain, who with his soldiers, is fighting local rebels.  Unknown to them, the local villagers working at the soldier's camp contains a doctor and a servant loyal to the rebels.  Ofelia is unwittingly placed into this cat-and-mouse game of ruthless personal violence.  She escapes into a fantasy world, a stone labyrinth situated behind the soldier's camp with origins unknown to all.  There, Ofelia meets Pan, a faun, who tells her that she is a princess disguised in human form.  Pan sets her to three duties in order for her to re-enter the world below as the princess of old.

Produced with a Spanish cast and spoken entirely in Spanish, this movie explores many themes unknown to many American viewers.  First of, the movie is set in Spain during the reign of the fascists, an event in history unknown to pop culture since the book ""For Whom the Bells Toll"".  The resulting interpersonal violence and cruelty is frankly portrayed without any cutaway shots, hence giving the movie a deserved R rating.  Second, the dangers of pregnancy childbirth is also explored, as Carmen dies in the middle of the movie.  As a corollary, we see how Vidal values his unborn child over that of his wife; a trait barely mentioned but still common in some places.  Third, the contrast between Ofelia and Vidal is probably the heart of the movie.  The girl is young and innocent, unable to spare a drop of blood of an innocent to save her own life.  Vidal is all to willing to kill and maim others, and risk his own life in order to attain whatever end he chooses.  Every other character in the movie lies in the spectrum between them.  The servant Mercedes, the village doctor, and the rebels lie closer to Ofelia.  Carmen lies in the middle between Ofelia and Vidal, and the other soldiers are noticeably less reluctant in their cruelty than Vidal.

The parallel story of Pan is quite good, original by Western standards.  This fairy tale side of the movie rings true to fairy tales from old; horrific and full of dangerous creatures, with tasks to accomplish and a context of a different world.  The final scene of Ofelia rejoining her true parents is probably the most beautiful in the movie.

As a movie, it did OK at the US box office but quite well at various awards ceremonies.  The former was due in part to the Spanish language, and more importantly, the amount of graphic violence.  A reduction in the graphicness of the violence would have brought this movie a PG-13 rating, and probably much larger audiences.  On technical terms, the music was slow, haunting but not great.  The special effects were quite believable.  Overall, a good movie to watch, though adults only.",1182988800,2,2932,4.743083003952569

7626201,4,B002BYYA9A,"First I must say that the previews were a bit misleading.  The film contains fantasy elements but it is mostly a film about war, treachery, and rebellion in 1940's Spain.  The two ""halves"" of the movie are well-done and I would say that this gives the movie wide appeal.  Since the film combines two very different elements and the scenes rarely overlap these elements, I'll review them separately.

Fantasy - When we hear the word ""fantasy"", we thing ""kid's stuff"".  This, however, I would not recommend for children.  The fantasy elements revolve around a young girl who is a reincarnation of the Princess of the Underground Realm.  The Princess had escaped from the Underground Realm only to have her memory erased by the sun.  She eventually fell victim to the illnesses of the surface world and died.  The reincarnation of the Princess stumbles upon a labyrinth and meets a faun who gives her three tasks to prove that she has not turned into a mortal.  Each of the tasks are interesting and the first two are quite visually appealing.  They might not be appropriate for children since the first is disgusting, the second is scary, and the third is implicitly violent.  However, these scenes are a joy to watch for adults.

Rebellion - This is what the movie mostly focuses on.  It's a rather violent narration of rebellion and treachery in Spain.  The Princess' stepfather is an extremely cruel military officer whose followers are not always the most loyal.  The scenes of treachery will make your heart jump because there is always a constant feeling of dread and the traitors are so close to the stepfather that they are bound to be caught.  Also, the stepfather is an intelligent man who catches onto things quickly.  This part of the story also follows the Princess' earthly mother who is sick with baby and the daughter's attempts to heal her suffering.  This part also ties into the fantasy elements.  Overall, the rebellion story is even better done than the fantasy part.  Any filmgoer will surely feel nothing but hatred for the stepfather and nothing but sympathy for the girl and her mother.  The plotline is a bit simplistic, but the dialogue is good and the plot is played out well and at a reasonable pace.  However, do note that this part of the film is very graphic and is not appropriate for children.

Overall, I would say there is something here for just about everyone.  I wouldn't say it's the masterpiece that many make it out to be, but it's still a very enjoyable film.",1182643200,2,2500,4.71824480369515

The film has the ability to challenge the viewer to think about the choices he or she makes in daily life and to confront the results of those choices. The film deals with the idea that magic is a way to escape the brutal reality of daily life.

At its simplest this is the story of a young girl, Ofelia who has to invent a fairy tale land of her own as she is confronted with the barbarism of post WWII Spain. The movie reveals itself in fairy tale fashion. Characters are either all good or all evil there is no middle ground.

Forced to live witha sadistic Captain who has married her mother, the child escapes to magical realms and performs tasks in order to claim her rightful place as a princess. To offer more would be to give away a story that you need to become lost in.

In her reality she faces a mother who is pregnant and very sick because of it and her evil stepfather, who may or may not be their undoing.

It should also be noted however, that this movie can be extremely(!!) graphic & violent in some parts, and certain images may scare younger children. This is a fairytale for adults, not kids.

Other than seeing the trailer and identifying Pan's Labyrinth as a Del Toro film, I'm glad that I didn't bother to read anything else about the movie prior to seeing it (which I always avoid as much as possible in order to keep the element of surprise in play), because I might have been discouraged by a lot of the ""Spanish fairy tale with English subtitles"" comments.

Forget fairy tale, folks. Did I mention R-rating? Very rarely do you see any movie described as a fairy tale with an R-rating. And the R-rating is really too bad here, because it definitely cost Del Toro some box office bucks. But you have to hand it to the guy for keeping the integrity of the film intact. There's one scene (okay...maybe two) that sealed the R-rating and could easily have been lightened up involving a local farmer and his son confronting the fascist Capit&aacute;n Vidal assigned search out and crush anti-fascist rebels in post Civil War Spain.

The star of this movie is young Ivana Baquero in the role of Ofelia. While the idea of this tween venturing so bravely into such a dark fantasy is a bit stretched, Baquero really makes you believe that she believes it. The movie starts with Ofelia and her Mom en route to their new accommodations at the camp of Capit&aacute;n Vidal and his troops circa 1944.

Upon arrival at the camp, Ofilia is shown a Labyrinth where she meets one UMF (ugly male faun) named Pan who gives Ofelia a Book of Crossroads, which explains tasks that she must complete in order to escape her new living arrangement and take her place as Princess of the Underworld.

Doug Jones is Pan and also the eerie Pale Man in Pan's Labyrinth, and this guy plays a great monster.

I'm pretty liberal when it comes to what I'll let my kids watch, but Pan's Labyrinth is out of reach (mainly due to the brutalities of Capit&aacute;n Vidal as opposed to the nightmarish images). For adults...fans of Horror/Sci-fi/Fantasy shouldn't miss this genre gem.

What we get in the end is a hybrid which has two oil and vinegar elements that don't mix.

On the subject of violence I am not usually disgusted by violence...love Saving Private Ryan, Gladiator, etc...but this film was over the top.  It was if the director was going out of his way to gross out the audience...and it comes off as sophomoric at best.

The monsters encountered by the main character(a little girl) are overly gruesome...and I think it's inappropriate to have such a young actress interacting with such vile menaces.

I could forgive the violence if, in the end, the film had a point.  Other than a political bias painting communist partisans as kind and gentle souls who, despite being Marxist guerrillas, are apparently boy scouts too, the movie seems to have no clear message.

7626219,5,B002BYYA9A,"On the front of the DVD it says, ""On the same altar of High Fantasy as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy."" Hopefully by now, everyone knows that J.R.R. Tolkien is the writer that penned that famous trilogy and with the help of Peter Jackson, made fantasy popular again.

Unfortunately, that little sentence on the cover of the DVD is EXTREMELY misleading. By simply mentioning ""Lord of the Rings"" the average consumer is going to think, ""Oh, Orcs, Hobbits, Wizards, Magic and huge battles with looming castles.""

Not quite.

Pan's Labyrinth is as good as Lord of the Rings, but it is not the same. It is like comparing apples and oranges. If you really wanted to compare Pan's Labyrinth, it is more comparable to the works of the ""Argentine Tolkien"" JORGE LUIS BORGES. And the director himself even cited him as an influence.

""Wait"", you say. Who is this Borges guy you're talking about? And right there that explains why they had to compare this to Lord of the Rings. The average person is not going to know who Borges is, even thought that would have been a better comparison.

Borges was fluent in many languages, did lots of reading and wrote many short stories and poems. One recurring topic of his (among many): Labyrinths. If you ever read some of his stories, there is some fantasy, but it's mixed in with literature. Just like Pan's Labyrinth has some fantasy, but is mixed with reality.

Also of note, Borges has influenced writers such as Umberto Eco, who wrote ""The Name of the Rose"", and even features a character in his honor, Jorge.

Hopefully after reading that, you will now understand what type of fantasy this is. It is not like Tolkien, but is as masterfully done as Tolkien.

As for the movie itself:

STORYLINE: The storyline is part reality and part fantasy. It is very similar to something Jorge Luis Borges would have written--thought-provoking and intelligent.

MUSIC: The simple lullaby fits in so perfectly with this movie--especially towards the end. It's a little ironic, because a lullaby gives you that warm and fuzzy ""everything is safe"" feeling, but then there's the harsh reality.

ACTING: All the characters did an excellent job at their roles. I was especially impressed with Mercedes.

COSTUMES/SPECIAL EFFECTS: I tire of the big-budget, special effects laden movies that are flooding the market. There are some fantasy creatures (some of which look like they came right out of Jorge Luis Borges' bestiary, the ""Book of Imaginary Beings""), but they have a nice puppety '80's look to them. Most impressive was the monster that had his eyes in his hands--that was very original and reminded me of the oubliette with hands in ""Labyrinth"". Simple, but effective.

Overall, this is a great Great GREAT movie. I saw it in the theater twice and out of all the fantasy books/movies I've encountered from Robert E. Howard to Tolkien to Borges to George RR Martin, this is easily some of the best fantasy I've ever experienced.",1181606400,16,2952,4.810276679841897
7626220,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth (Laberinto del fauno, El)

Directed by: Guillermo Del Toro

 Guillermo Del Toro was born in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico. Guillermo Del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a  poignant film that takes place during the time of Fascist Spain of 1944 after The Spanish Civil War.  The movie opens with a fairy tale wherein a princess' father is the king of the underworld.  The princess becomes curious about the world above, and travels to the surface where she forgets about her life in the underworld and grows old where she dies as a mortal. The king believes that her spirit will come back to the underworld someday.

 The young heroin, Ofelia embodies the reincarnated spirit of the princess. She is brought into the life of her cruel stepfather who is the captain of the Fascist army.  She is continually fascinated by fairy tales and encounters many mythical creatures that summon her to complete three tasks so that she might return to the underworld.

 To be honest, I planned on only skimming this movie because it seemed so fantasy-esqe and that's not really my personal preference. But, I went ahead and watched the whole movie to my benefit. I found that it was actually action packed, emotionally evoking, sad/tragic, and carried a sense of realism parallel to its polar opposite fantasy world. Throughout the film, the plot was well developed by the characters. From the beginning, I recognized Ofelia was having episodes of hallucinations almost as a coping mechanism to deal with the stress of her ill mother, her cruel stepfather, and her undesirable living conditions.  These episodes are made clearer when she only experiences them at the absence of others, and confirmed at the end when she's seen talking to no one in the labyrinth.  When considering that this around-ten-year-old young girl is suffering from hallucinations, it made me realize how much she really wanted to be out of her current living arrangement.  She had created a fictional world (with the help of her avid reading of fairy-tales) to help her escape from her own.

 By understanding the cruelty of her stepfather coupled with the death of her most beloved person, her mother, it made me pity Ofelia.  She desperately seeked to have a parental figure in her life.  Mercedes, the head housekeeper/servant was the closest person Ofelia had to a mother, and to ""return"" back to the underworld to the King/her own father was her way of seeking a father figure since her biological father had passed away.  Obviously, her stepfather was no where close to a father to her as she continually denied him as a dad and only recognized him as ""the Captain.""

 Finally, the last portion of the film where Ofelia has one last fantastic hallucination just before she dies is quite poetic.  She finally completes the last of three tasks (shedding her own blood) to enter the kingdom of the underworld as a princess.  Here she is greeted by the king, her father, the queen, her mother, and the at first questionable, but later proven trustworthy faun, who are basically all her most beloved people she knew at this point in her young life.  From Ofelia's point of view, she merely transitioned from one life to another better one.  Her death is parallel of fantasy and reality.  In regards to fantasy, her death/shedding of blood was the best thing that could have happened to her.  In reality, it was extremely sad that her stepfather selfishly murdered her and the very fact that she had not even reached adolescence.  This reality struck me as terribly tragic.  The fact that this film could evoke such strong emotions from one its viewers makes me recognize this film as a great form of art.",1181520000,5,3676,4.846153846153846

A young girl coming to live with a new step father is drawn into a fantasy world.  Is the fantasy real or just her imagination.  It doesn't matter; it is real to her and to us.  The time is the Spanish Civil War, and the new step father is a ruthless comander of government forces.  Against the backdrop of a savage civil war--aren't all civil wars savage?--this young girl slips away from the horrid reality and into another scary one.  There are brutal, violent scenes and scenes of great beauty.

7626222,3,B002BYYA9A,"Wow...and not in a good sense. This movie was fkn boring as hell to me. I really don't see what the big hoopla is about this movie. Yes it did have some good parts in it, but damn it seemed like there was so much senseless c**p in it also. I was expecting to watch some fantasy movie, but instead I get some crap about a girl who imagines way to much. The setting with the military guys against some geurilla warfare dudes set back in some old time was annoying. I could care less about it. Everything since the beginning of the movie was just emotionally sad. I thought their would be an uplifting in the movie, something to hold on to, something to make you have hope, but there really wasn't any of that.

Artistically, the movie was very pretty in the special effects category. The 'faun' the little girl talks to was VERY well done and looked like a cross between CG and cosmetics (I'm not watching the specials, so I don't know for sure). The monster with eyeballs on its hands, was wickedly freaky.

The acting wasn't to bad, but most of it was just annoying. The only good actors was the Captain (who sometimes was a little to annoying with his evilness) and the little girl.

Seriously though...did I miss something in this movie? Why is it getting so much praise when it was mediocre at best? 'The Little Princess' is a much better movie when it comes to a girl who is in a rut pretending about fairy tales to make her life better. 'Bridge to Taribithia' was also a better movie about a kid(s) having a make believe area to better their lives... and I didn't even care for that movie that much.

7626223,5,B002BYYA9A,"It's a dark movie, both for the times it portrays (the early years of Franco's fascist reign as he is destroying his enemies, the precursor of WW2).
and for the topic, the human propensity for cruelty and a child's attempt to escape from it into a world populated by her imagination.

It twists both of these themes-it's historical time and her imagination together to weave a somewhat dark, foreboding, mysterious yet ultimately hopeful world in the midst of both societal and personal tragedy.

The movie is about two kinds of people, both considered disposable by power: a wife married more for her uterus than for anything else with her young daughter and the losers in the Spanish UnCivil War. Both groups dispute this judgement of their worth by those in power but fighting the forces of those that rule over them. The wife does it quietly and eventually dies in childbirth giving the driving force of local power-her husband, the Fascist Captain, his only desire-a son. Whom he desires to raise up into his own image. The daughter does it actively with a flight of childhood imagination that creates most of the film, creating an alternative world where good and evil are as confused as they are in the real world. Where she can embark on a 3-part quest for her life and that of her new born brother. And the poor inhabitants of the mountains fighting for a lost cause, fighting a rear guard action against the rising and recently victorious Franco forces with a bit of cunning but mostly with a self sacrificial spirit and given the situation pointlessly dying (and killing).

Really everyone loses in this movie, nothing is particularly positive but hope hides in the negative, cruelty dies yet he kills imagination just moments before his own ignominious death. Out of the pain, long-suffering, blood and finally the death associated with childbirth (for both the mother and her doctor) comes a son, but the only good thing is that he will never hear the name of his father. The recently vanquished win this skirmish but you know they have to flee over the mountains to France leaving their country until the that new born boy is a middle aged man(the age at which both his grandfather and father died in war) who can return to a Post-Franco new Spain. The young daughter dies, her blood dripping uselessly but dramatically into Pan's Labyrinth, yet her last moments are happy as she sees her parent's as King and Queen of her imaginary world, beyond the death, cruelty and evil of this sad world.

The first thing anyone needs to know is that Pan's Labyrinth is completely is Spanish. If you don't like reading subtitles, I recommend that you look past that and try this movie out anyway. I, for one, really love the story and believe me when I say that this movie would not have been nearly as good had it been dubbed.

So, that being said, there are some definite dark points in the story and some scenes that are a little bit...gory, for lack of a better word. Beneath all this is a sense of mystique and wonder.

From early on you begin to develop your feelings for the characters, and as every moment passes you can't wait to find out what will happen next.

The original score fits absolutely perfectly and really grasps the mood of the scene; it really lends to the emotions you're intended to feel. The lullaby that seems to be the main theme is simple and memorable, really beautiful in its simplicity.

Character designs are really well done. The fairy-tale characters look awesome, as though they were brought right out of some forgotten mythology.

The set designs were, in my opinion, very well done. All the detail that was needed was included, as well as the extra detail that adds to the realism and believability of the scene.

I personally really liked the extras. Each one in its own way helps you better understand the movie and the individual characters. You also get a really good explanation of where the director was coming from. For those reasons I would say the extras make it worth getting the 2-disc platinum above the regular release.

7626231,5,B002BYYA9A,".. most certainly one of the best movies of the year. The story is set in to mid 1940's in Spain, a perfect setting for the cruel and violent  backdrop for the main character, a young girl trying to cope with a sickly pregnant mother and a stepfather  who could care less about her.

Our young heroine meets a fairy who takes her into a labarynth to mmet a relitvely nasty faun who need sher to complete 3 tasks to prove that her human side has not taken control of her 'long awaited' princess side.

The movie is fast paced and does not get the viewer tied up in knots with a lot of background historical babble of a writer trying to cover up shortcomings in the script. The cinematography, lighting, sets, special effects, sound are all fabulous ......",1181347200,,754,4.402877697841727
7626232,5,B002BYYA9A,"A must to have in your collection if you are a fanasty fan. Good story, glorious cinematography!! I saw it at the theater and could not wait for it to come out on DVD.

7626233,5,B002BYYA9A,"This is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. And being less than fluent in Spanish I had absolutely no problem reading the subtitles to the dialogue in the movie. In fact, I hardly noticed that the characters weren't actually speaking a language I understand. The story was amazing as were the effects. Best movie I've seen in a while",1181260800,3,342,4.532258064516129
7626234,4,B002BYYA9A,"This is not a Walt-Disney animated fairy tale.  ""Pan's Labyrinth"" shows us the gritty and often gruesome detail that fills most of the original Brothers Grimm stories, setting it against a 20th Century background (Generallissimo Franco's Spain, 1944) which is hardly a pleasant locale either.

Striking, if at times grisly, visuals fill all of the fantasy sequences.  The real world, meanwhile, appears as a place where bright colors often appear dingy, shadows abound, suspicion, and sudden, pointless violence wait around every corner.  It is a place from which one one might well try to escape in fantasy.  Alas, fantasies often carry much of reality with them.  So it is with ""Pan's Labyrinth"".

One should not be intimidated by the fact that this movie is subtitled.  Many of the fantasy sequences in particular are largely visual and in others, dialogue is almost intrusive.  One could more or less ""get"" this movie with both sound and subtitles shut off--but that would deprive the viewer of a fine musical score which slithers through the background of the entire story.

Portions of this film seem derivative of the work of Terry Gilliam, as well as Jim Henson's ""Labyrinth"".  But to nitpick over these is to approach the film with a jaded eye.  And one should approach ""Pan's Labyrinth"" with whatever innocence one retains, even though it may end up sorely bruised by story's end.  Like the characters in the film, one may or may not live happily ever after, but that, perhaps, is in the eye of the beholder.",1181260800,8,1518,4.905882352941177
7626235,4,B002BYYA9A,"I agree with the other reviewers - this is not a feel-good movie and I felt the ending was very sad. Clearly, the fantasy world only exists in the girl's mind and dreams. But she needs it to escape from the horrible reality surrounding her. In the end, though, she feels compelled to choose between doing what is right or facing reality. In the end, she chooses to face reality and must face the consequences. Still, the movie is unclear about whether the consequences were positive (reuniting with her parents and becoming a princess) or negative. Interestingly, I have spoken with several people who felt the ending was positive and even uplifting. I think it depends on your point of view.",1181260800,2,692,4.7272727272727275
7626236,4,B002BYYA9A,"Very compelling tale of a young girl who is forced with her sickly and ready to conceive mother, to live with her cruel father in the 1930's war torn Spanish countryside.  Her father is El Capitan of a military force seeking out rebels against the government.  He loves to torture and brutally murder anybody he catches, whether they are rebels or not (warning: some of the scenes are so graphic that they are difficult to watch if you have a weak stomach).  The girl's means of blocking out all this cruelty are the fairy tales her mother tells her.  Suddenly those fairy tales seem to come to life as the girl meets a fairy that takes her to see Faun in the area near the house called the Labyrinth (it is like a large maze).  The Faun tells her that she is a princess from another land and the only way for her to open the portal to get back is to perform three brave tasks.  Spoiler below:

The story moves to its conclusion reminiscent of the Twilight Zone tale ""Next Stop Willoughby,"" with a little bit borrowed from the movie ""A Beautiful Mind.""

Don't look for super special effects; however, they are not necessary as the story itself is what makes this movie good.",1181260800,3,1174,4.427906976744186
7626237,5,B002BYYA9A,Loved this movie! Totally interesting and imaginative perception on the journey of souls. i loved how the incorporated fiction with non-fiction as far as the Spanish War setting. Guillermo out did himself with this one!,1181174400,2,219,5.285714285714286
7626238,4,B002BYYA9A,"This is not a movie for the weak-willed.  And you should not rent this movie if you want a smiley little magical Disney movie.  This is something different.  Yes, it has magic and imagination, but real magic and imagination.  This magic is used in the face of life's tragedies, and every real life knows these tragedies.

The tale is about a 12 year old girl whose mother is in love with a ruthless Captain from fascist Spain.  This captain is the prototype of the macho-fascist Spanish warrior from the 1940's.  His soldiers, with their dark uniforms and mustaches look somewhat monstrous as they ride their horses through rural Spain in search of the last rebels who dared stand up to the fascist state of Espana.

The vicious step father is not girl's only problem.  Her mother is on the verge of death from a difficult pregnancy, her father is already dead, and everything else seems to be going wrong with her as well.

She learns that she is really a princess who is immortal, if she believes in the magic of her ancestors and completes a series of tasks.  The magic underworld that she finds is strange, and the viewer wonders if she would be better off avoiding it altogether.  It is among some ruins in a forest near the town where the military and her cruel stepfather are staying.  She hears from the faun that her father is a king of this magical world and she is offered the hope of meeting him and joining a universe of infinite wonder.

But this is not a feel good story.  Tragedy strikes all, from the most ruthless to the most innocent.  The faun's tasks are difficult and frightening, both the Spanish army and the rebels suffer devastating losses, and there is enough treachery, deceipt and disillusionment to crush any innocent's heart.

The ending leaves the viewer questioning to what extent the girl reached her immortality and reached the world of wonder.  She made a great sacrifice and is evidently rewarded.  Or is she?  Find out for yourself, but I doubt you'll walk away from this movie with a smile on your face.",1181088000,4,2042,4.60387811634349
7626239,1,B002BYYA9A,"I was disappointed in the movie. Watching the trailer would make you think you would dive into a troubled dark fantasy. It does not remotely come close. The movie, is how the big bad captain, maltreats everyone in his family. He is also a terrible sadist, fighting the republican partisans still in the hills. This all happens years after the Civil war ended in Spain. The Captain is a caricature of a cold, brutal, sadist. This is a sick war movie with ultra sadistic bloody violence. This flick was bloody, humourless, biased and a real bummer with small sprinklings of fantasy. The acting was great, script was okay, and the plot was a failure. This movie is not for kids!!! Adults who are kids at heart should steer clear as well.",1181088000,12,734,4.6106870229007635
7626240,5,B002BYYA9A,"Boy, nothing about this movie was what I expected.  Huzzah for that!  It is a beautifully filmed, wonderfully written, and tremendously acted movie that leaves you drained and exhilerated both.

Not for the faint-of-heart, it has violence galore, but not of the pandering, blood-for-good-times variety. Far from it. This film shows the horrific reality of war, and of monomaniacal, psychopathic people who torture and kill for their ""just"" causes.

From the opening scene to the closing, I was captivated and horrified by the story told. From the larger arc of the story, to every tiny detail, this film is gorgeously rendered. Every time I thought I knew what was going to happen, something totally unexpected took place instead. The little girl who plays the lead is amazing and should have received an Academy Award for her performance.  The story of her character--entering a fantasy world (or is it?) as dark and dangerous as the ""real"" world she's trying to escape from--is heart-rending.  You just want to reach through the screen and save her.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" is surely a modern masterpiece!",1181088000,6,1102,5.088888888888889
7626241,2,B002BYYA9A,"This is another movie I wanted to like but ultimately can not recommend.

The acting was top notch and the effects and visual sequences were simply amazing. However given all these positive things, the story was the failure here. Also the incredible emphasis on violence, brutality and blood.

This is one of the ""most"" violent films I have seen in recent memory, and I have seen Kill Bill many times.

Unlike Kill Bill where the violence is over the top and entertaining this movie is very hard and real. We see good or innocent people murdered and tortured with no care. It is just too much. I know Spain was really into all that inquisition stuff back when, but it is sad to see that this vicious kind of violence still exists as entertainment in their culture.

The story is about a 8-10 year old girl's plight. Her mother is a weak and foolish woman who after her husband dies decides to marry a sociopath and take her little innocent daughter who is still dealing with the death of her beloved father into this psycho's world.

This monster is the captain of an outpost that stands against a group of rebels who are trying to change things. The captain runs the outpost like Dachau and tortures and murders anyone who even looks sideways at him.

The girl's stupid mother is of course seduced by his darkness and power and gets herself pregnant with his son, his heir to evil.

As we learn later, he could care less about the mother, and all she is to him is a piece of meat who's purpose is to allow him to propagate his evil.

The death of the girl's father and that unresolved trauma combined with the horror of living in the hell her mother has lead her into causes the girl to create a fantasy world in her mind and a series of adventures that she undertakes.

This is where the story gets very sad because you are aware that everything she is going through is in her mind, a fugue state brought on by the horror and emotional shock of all that has happened and is happening to her.

By the end of the film pretty much everyone is dead, murdered, or tortured and there is no pay off, no hope.

Despite what the fantasy sequence at the end may imply, it, in reality, is just a sad brutal end to an experience that no young child should ever be forced to endure. The guilt for the whole thing can be placed squarely at the door step of her stupid and selfish mother and her new sociopathic husband.

I can not recommend this film except to those who like to see people get hurt and killed and enjoy a good nihilistic romp.",1181001600,13,2531,4.350318471337579

7626244,1,B002BYYA9A,"Although I don't speak Spanish, the subtitles did not bother me.  I can understand why some people would think reading them would detract from enjoying the visuals of a movie.  That said, I do not understand all of the hoopla about this movie.  It was dark, sad, unneccessarily gory and had a terrible ending.  The young actress was very talented, but that's about all I can find positive about the movie.  The part about the mandrake root was completely sickening to me, moreso even than the needless violence.  ( I even watched it a second time with the director's commentary to get a better understanding of his intent and was horrified by his viscious comments about the horses involved.  I'm 58 years old, have had horses since I was 11 years old, and few creatures are as kind and willing to do what we ask if we are kind to them.  Mr. Del Torro needs to understand that horses are so much bigger than we are that they have to do absolutely NOTHING we ask.  They are simply willing and generous when treated kindly.  Maybe he needed a different wrangler.) If folks want to see a beautiful movie concerning WWII, I suggest they see ""Schindler's List.""  I think all of these folks who find this movie so awesome are being held hostage by critics who find the likes of ""Eraserhead"" equally awesome.",1181001600,17,1301,4.564655172413793
7626245,5,B002BYYA9A,"I really liked this movie.  First of all it's not in the tradition of The Lord of the Rings, I duno where that idea came from.  The movie portraits the alternative reality of a girl living in the very violent civil war in Spain.  The necesity of creating a place where one can be sure as a child, the importance of imagination and how kids deal with the violent enviroment sourounding them.  Also the performances and visual effects are awesome.

Not for everyone, since it can be very violent, but at the same time very beautiful and touching..",1180915200,3,545,4.520408163265306

a very dark war story, with its dark characters..  The darkness and violence

photography and effects of the fairy tale portion, which was slowly destroyed

by the other story.  Even if everyone loves this movie, i shall never view it

7626247,2,B002BYYA9A,The blurb on the cover of the DVD I have indicates that this film is in the tradition of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. What an insult to the great master. I found the mythical characters so poorly depicted as to be ludicrous. The guy with the eyes in his hands is so ridiculous as to be truly laughable. The story is fine and the acting of the 'humans' fine also. Overall I see nothing to rate this picture four stars.,1180915200,5,417,4.160493827160494
7626248,5,B002BYYA9A,"This is the most powerful, riveting and beautiful movie that I have seen in a long time.  The movie takes you on a journey of highs and lows with it's cinematography.  Even though the movie is subtitled you get hooked and don't want to look away.  This is the way a fairy tale movie should be told.  Not only was there real life drama there was fantasy drama building along with it.  It was a perfect blend.  If you are looking for a Narnia type movie, this is not for you.  The fairy tale is more adult oriented in nature and the violence in the movie is graphic at times.  I would highly recommend this masterpiece to anyone who is a fan of these types of movies.",1180828800,3,665,4.181102362204724
7626249,5,B002BYYA9A,"Let me begin by saying that this movie was not what I was expecting; the advertisements and print art led me to believe it would be more of a fantasy along the lines of The Lord of the Rings.  None of that, however, kept me from loving this movie.  As an avid movie watcher, I have learned that movies aren't always advertised/described as they should be, but if you are a true lover of cinema that will not keep you from appreciating a movie.  If it does, then I pity you because you are going to miss out on some amazing movies, such as Pan's Labyrinth.

Everything about this movie is amazing.  The music is pitch perfect.  The special effects are good but don't overpower the movie and take center stage.  The acting is wonderful, and the plot moves at a steady pace with very few, if any, slow spots.  There is a lot of violence, but that is to be expected considering it's set during a war.

In many ways I saw Ofelia as the equivalent of a modern-day moviegoer, escaping reality by plunging herself into an imaginary world.  It's a gross analogy I know, but isn't that part of the reason why we watch movies?

My only regret is that I was unable to see this wonderful movie while it was playing in theaters.  It never came to the local cineplex because I live in an area where foreign movies are not well-received.  What a sad commentary on our society and (after reading some of the reviews here) people who purport to love movies.",1180828800,10,1439,4.364661654135339
7626250,1,B002BYYA9A,"Directors should direct and shut up, but Mr. Toro seems incapable of doing either activity very well. He intrudes into the movie (at least into the DVD) seeking sympathy for himself and his efforts: ""This movie almost destroyed me, almost killed me"" he says, adding that he had lost 45 pounds in the process. Please!

There are two films here: one purporting to depict a corner of Spain 5 years after its civil war, the other a child's fairy tale. If you like cheap and vulgar violence, you will love the first movie; the characters (the brutal military man, the gentle, sick, pregnant wife, the good doctor, the maid with a secret, the innocent little girl) are straight out of the cliche cupboard; together they have all the subtlety of Punch and Judy personages. Their lack of verisimilitude is more than amply made up by the cruel, gory and pointless special effects that attend the cruel, gory and pointless violence.

The second film is surely one of the most baroque and ornate productions ever seen, and its resultant effects are nothing less than gorgeous. The only problem is that there is no underlying story capable of supporting the paraphernalia. And that is a shame. It simply does not do to copy others (Grimm, Alice in Wonderland, the later Goya), to thrown in willy-nilly as many symbols as possible, and call that a children's story. It does not work that way.

The two films are juxtaposed in the hope (one suspects) that one strand will feed?, support?, illuminate?, illustrate?, the other. It does not. The two films are separate, remain separate, and never the twain do meet.

Despite all the hoopla, my advice is skip it, its not worth the bother.",1180828800,50,1671,4.751724137931035
7626251,3,B002BYYA9A,"Based on the pictures on the rear of the cover, I was looking for more interaction between the young girl in the movie and Pan.

Instead, there was a lot more interaction between her and the step-father.

The moment of terror at the buffet was way too short and I expected a lot more from the guardian of the table.

I also found that the activities inside the labyrinth were too brief.

It's certainly a movie worth watching and maybe I'll get something more from it the second time around.",1180742400,,491,4.4222222222222225
7626252,5,B002BYYA9A,"This is not your typical fantasy movie (Who would compare this to Narnia?). And this not not recommended for family viewing (did you not notice the R-rating?). Actually this fits the description of a ""gothic movie"". A true gothic movie features a heroine who suffers at the hands of a male villian. The atmosphere or mood of the film is bleak (usually involving a dark house). The resolution of the story can sometimes end tragically (but the heroine usually comes to a moment of catharsis). The supernatural elements in the movie is provided through the power of Ofelia's imagination (or is it?). Anyway I would think fans of Gothic literature would be more fascinated by this movie then fans of fantasy novels. Not to say that the fantasy elements are not up to par because to me if I categorized this movie as ""Fantasy"" I could easily say this is the best fantasy movie since ""The Return of the King"". But this movie has so many different elements (fantasy, war, drama, gothic terror) I really don't know where to place this in terms of recommending it. It's a great unique intelligent movie so approach with caution.",1180742400,4,1120,4.719387755102041
7626253,2,B002BYYA9A,"This was very disappointing in several ways. 1) It was in Spanish, with subtitles (the ads for the movie on TV never let on that you'd be missing half the picture having to read translations; When they show Mission Impossible III in Germany, they re-do the voices in German. Why can't we get that??? It stinks having to read when you want to instead HEAR and be able to SEE what's going on!  2) The movie is much nastier and darker than the ads lead you to believe, they make it look like it's a great uplifting high spirited fairy tale (misleading).  3) The special effects were disappointing. Even though some of them were quite good, I think they'd showed every one of them in the ads, there was no complete and beautiful world filled with cool special effects like I expected from the ads.  4) The amount of uplifting time actually spent in Pan's Labrynth was minimal. Most of our time was wasted in the depressing ""reality"" of 1940's Spain.  5)  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one was because it did have a good moral to the story, although to make the real point of ""the moral to the story was"" they should have rewarded the viewer, and the girl with MUCH MORE time spent in a blissful ""afterlife"" in Pan's Labrynth, not just had a token one minute or less. Sorry I spent the money, and next time, if anyone with influence reads this,  PLEASE translate the damn movie!!!!!",1180742400,3,1392,4.41796875

If you do not like to read subtitles because they reduce your enjoyment of a movie you will be frustrated.  Every time your eyes have to move from the acting to the subtitles you will be pulled out of the story.

It seems to me that if the producers want to market this DVD in the United States they will get a lot more buyers if they hire a few English speaking ""voice talents"" and re-release it.

Although much different than I imagined it to be, Pan's Labyrinth was more than worth the rental. It definitely deserves a place in my DVD library, so I will be purchasing it as soon as possible.

While many would argue that the violence is too much to bear, I think it perfectly captures the reality of the war. To everybody thinking this is some plain fantasy movie: BE WARNED!! There is much more war than fantasy in this film, so much that I wouldn't even call it a fantasy, but rather a drama (even more so when the film reveals its ending).

Highly recommended, and worth every single star and then some.",1180742400,7,762,4.554744525547445

The film was shot beautifully though, the acting was great, but I was expecting something different from watching the previews. It was like the magic/fantasy took a back seat to the war and violence.",1180742400,5,491,4.579545454545454
7626258,2,B002BYYA9A,"These are the positive things about this movie: its beautifully made, the character development is superb, and the acting is great! The negative things about this film, for me, was that I felt like it was trying to tackle two completely different directions: one, about a young girl who's immersed into a fantasy world that leaves the audience wondering if it's real or her own imagination, and the other, into the dark side of war, with all its gore and violence that comes with it. The idea is not a bad one, but I don't think it meshes too well. All the dark but enchanted beauty of Pan's mythological world is what drives the film's creativity, but is then tainted with all the gore and violence of Pan's nightmarish real world. At times all the blood and gore is just downright depressing. I know this film takes place during war, but I wish the director didn't have to resort to such violence to make the film darker than what it already is. And the ending was such a downer...it only left me wondering, why? Why was that necessary?

Overall, I wasn't too pleased with this movie. And it's a shame, because it started out so wonderfully and I almost started to like it. I think it's so sad that nowadays its hard to find a good movie these days...",1180656000,6,1253,4.471615720524017
7626259,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth has to be one of the greatest films of 2006. The enchanting cinematics produce some of the most beautiful screenshots you will see. The mix of fantasy from a child's perspective when confronted with the brutal realities of facist Spain retrace the roots of fairy tales.

The viscaral horror can be a bit hard to swallow, but the ingenuity of some ""scary"" scenes portray a masterpiece of story telling. ""Pale man"" is one of the scariest monsters in any fairytale I've ever encountered.

The best way to describe the movie is fairy tales for adults, fairy tales as the Brother's Grimm originally wrote (if you haven't ever read the Complete Works of the Brothers Grimm - buy it, loan it, borrow it - just read it!) - but perhaps even more terrifying as the nightmares are brought to life before your eyes.

If you can't stand foreign films or reading subtitles, this is not the movie for you. Unfortunately you are missing out on a wonderful market just beyond the grasp of Hollywood. I believe, however, that this film can be appreciated on it's own past the language barrier because of the cinematics - the mixture of colors at the end when Ofelia is in her kingdom with the bright red contrasted with the other brilliant golds.... so captivating.

This film is certainly worth watching. Even my boyfriend who hates subtitles loved the movie and we went to see it in cinema twice. :)

Some critiques are the inconsistencies within Ofelia's character. She is both strong and yet vulnerable. That is true of any person, but her mistake while in the dining room with the Pale Man does not seem to fit her character. Perhaps this is because she is a child, but I before this scene had thought we were supposed to believe Ofelia was more brave and cunning than other children.

Still, this movie is one of my favorites of all time.",1180656000,9,1842,4.634969325153374

I knew it would be amazing but still I wasn't quite ready for the intensity and sheer beauty of this film. This is by no means an escapist faerytale, but the power of Pan's to  capture the imagination is no less profound. Doug Jones as the pan is simply astonishing, I really can't say enough about his performance. This is not just a must own for fantasy fans, but a film for those who enjoy truly memorable movie experiences. Don't let the fact the the film is in Spanish with English Subtitles deter you from seeing it. You really will miss out. Pan's Labyrinth takes us back to the roots of the true Faerytale, those in the Grimm tradition, and while no one could compare it to the fairydust covered fluff that we've grown acustomed to, Pan's is dark to say the least. I as a viewer was left at the end with a breathtakingly lovely sense of magic in the mundain. I recomend getting the 2 disc edition as it adds considerably to the movie as a whole.

7626261,3,B002BYYA9A,"I won't bore you with a repetition of what has been said many times in previous reviews, but I will reiterate the observation that this is really, in many ways, two separate movies.

One is a dark, brooding, mysterious and excellent allegory about good and evil, innocence between corrupted by (or at any rate confused and beguiled by) evil. I was fascinated by this portion of the film, with its superb characterizations, acting and special effects.

The other movie is a brutal, sadistic and overly graphic depiction of torture and killing. To linger almost lovingly over these scenes is NOT my idea of good movie making. A good film maker can deliver the same impact without the gore. This is the part of the film I hated. Unfortunately, it ruined the total effect for me and, frankly, I would never recommend this movie to anyone.",1180569600,5,834,4.744827586206896

It didn't air in the local theaters so I had to wait until it came out on video. There isn't nearly enough fantasy in a movie advertised to be a fantasy book. This is NOT a fantasy, it's a drama.

this movie is was a HUGE let down. I mean, the movie was okay I guess, but to compare it to the LOTR is just wrong. These two movies have almost nothing in common, LOTR beats Pans Labyrinth in every movie category there is. The only category that Labyrinth comes even remotely close to the LOTR is in emotional impact, but even then everything was done so matter of fact in this movie I could only feel really bad at the very end. Normally if you throw a suffering little girl into a movie you automatically have me depressed (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grave-of-the-Fireflies/dp/B00070Q84U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grave of the Fireflies</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Now-and-Then-Here-and-There-Complete-Collector-s-Boxed-Set/dp/B000063K2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Dogs-Go-to-Heaven/dp/B000056H26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Dogs Go to Heaven</a>) but here it didn't. Why is easy to see. The girl in this movie is so amazedly stupid, which is made clear when she eats from a feast after being warned that doing so would result in her death. Even with fairies buzzing around her head and trying to take the good away from her, even which a creepy monster thing at the end of the table, even with pictures of that same monster thing killing hundreds of little babies, SHE STILL EATS THE STUPID FOOD!!! And its not just her, the house maid is such a bad spy that I'm surprised she lasted this long, and the doctor is extremely careless. They just don't act like real people would act, and in a movie that's character driven that's not a good thing.

Then there's the meany step dad. Although he is one bad dude, and deserves to be hated, I've seen too many villains who are MUCH worse than him. Sure this guy is bad, but he could have been a lot worse. Until the end (when he was drugged up) the worse thing he did was torture a stutterer with his little hammer and pliers. Don't get me wrong now, he's a really bad guy, but he pretty much leaves people alone who don't do anything to him. It's not like he's going out murdering random people. By everything I was hearing, I expected him to be the worst thing since Hitler, but this guy is no where NEAR that bad. Come on now.

just one question before I stop writing a review that I know won't get many helpful votes, do all Spanish people fight this bad? I know this isn't a war movie, but the fighting was so unrealistic it was laughable. The soldiers run around in the open missing each other at point blank range, and yet the main villain is able to pick people off at fifty yards with his pistol.

Maybe I could have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't been expecting another LOTR, but that's the way it was advertised. Don't blame me for that. The acting was good, the special effects were good (but once again I was comparing them to the LOTR, in which case they came up short) and the script was great. Don't watch this movie expecting fantasy, because that's not what you'll get. if you read this review (whether you agree with me or not) please leave a comment.

7626263,3,B002BYYA9A,"I'd been warned before viewing this film that it was extremely dark and did not possess a typical ""Hollywood happy ending"".  That being said, I was prepared to truly enjoy it.  Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed, as the film focuses far more on the revolution in Franco's Spain than the delightfully creepy Underworld that is gained through the Labyrinth.  The bloody, gratuitous violence and sadism were things I wish I hadn't seen (and ended up fast-forwarding through, particularly the torture scenes...)

Young Ofelia is a remarkable character whose sensitivity is brutally ravaged by her cruel stepfather.  The best parts of the film involve Ofelia's interaction with the creepy Faun, whose demonesque appearance makes an interesting antithesis to Mr. Tumnus, a creature of the same family from C.S. Lewis's The LION, The WITCH, and The WARDROBE, who was a gentlemanly forest dweller.  Ofelia's two ""quests"" were even more enjoyable:  the enormous toad under the tree and the very disturbing Cannibal with the vermilion eyeballs in his hands...

I was disgruntled because so little of the plot involved Ofelia (who is the displaced Princess Moanna of the Underworld) and the magical creatures who had sustained her imagination as she contended with the harsh realities of losing her father and enduring her mother's second marriage.

That being said, I did appreciate the story on the whole, particularly Ofelia's bloody end, which certainly hearkens back to the original Grimm Brothers' tales.  ""Happily ever after"" just wasn't a part of those cautionary stories -- and they were the better for it!",1180569600,5,1610,5.25390625
7626264,5,B002BYYA9A,"Funny that one of the best directors in the world of cinema is a mexican, someone Hollywood could never mold or produce. This is a great fantasy film with great acting. If you have a problem with it being over-rated by critics, boy do I feel sorry for you. It is a film with ""down in the trenches"" politics, magical realism and an old school fairy tale with a credible mythology. The director himself explains that most of the material for the movie came out of his own imagination, and apparently, he is a decent comic-artist as well. This is a great 4 star movie, never mind the Academy awards it should have won.
Regarding the English dubbing issue and the DVD, obviously the producers felt that the movie's artistic value would be comprimised with a dubbed English soundtrack. I don't think that they tried to fool anyone into beleiving that there such a thing on the case. If there is, then the viewer should take the movie back and demand their money back.

7626266,5,B002BYYA9A,"I'm a big fan of del Toro's films, film scripts and direction, not to mention his incredibly sensitive and gorgeous cinematography.  I love this movie but won't go into why here as this is a review of the 2-disk DVD.

I definitely recommend this set over the single disk theatrical release. Del Toro's discussion of the concepts he applies to his filmmaking and his fascinating alternative audio commentary alone are well worth the price of the extra disk, but additionally, the 2-disk set provides a great short in which the actors discuss their roles, with emphasis on the actor who plays both the faun and the Pale Man, along with the prosthetics and special makeup needed to make these bizarre creatures so believable. Very little CGI was used in the film, by the way. There's also a segment of the ""Charlie Rose"" show in which del Toro and two of his friends, fellow innovative directors and countrymen discuss their work and what it is they hope to achieve.

Luckily, there's not an English-dubbed version of the film on the 2-disk set, just a Spanish version with or without English subtitles. A version dubbed in English would be a desecration.  The extras are all in English except when the actors spoke Spanish, in which case English subtitles are provided.  Del Toro's excellent commentary and discussion are in English.

I even watched the film without sound or subtitles just for fun, and I saw so much more, despite the fact I've seen it several times already. So many levels so magnificently done! Bravo!",1180483200,5,1519,4.800766283524904
7626267,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth, brilliantly directed by Guerillmo del Toro, was easily the best film of 2006, and possible of the decade. If not the best, one of the best of the decade. Many people do complain about the violence, but it's not near the level of violence as other R rated movies, such as Saw or The Passion of the Christ. It's more disturbing than graphic or gratuitous. The violence is there as a plot developer (especially in the beginning with Captain Vidal and the teenage boy), and is there to portray characters. The violence level is probably on the same level as Flags of our Fathers.

Moving on, Pan's Labyrinth is a brilliant piece of art that portrays ugly as beautiful. It's one of those films that serves a purpose. It's a film that takes you back to the early days of Hollywood (back when there was originality and people didn't want to film movies about murder or what ever was in at the time). The sets, makeup, costumes, etc are all top notch. It is a beautiful film that every future film director should see and study. This movie has heart.

Instead, the film is more like an old-style fairy tale, with a deep moral core and layers of allegory, some obvious, others more subtle. Watching Pan's Labyrinth is almost like becoming a child again; it transported me to a place that allowed me to suspend belief for a few hours, and for that alone, it's brilliant. One of the film's best qualities is the strange, dark, and beautiful world it immerses us in.

I also have to say that graphic violence in this film didn't belong.  We already know, you're going to kill a man, so why do we need to see it in graphic, bloody detail?  That was another thing that took away from the movie.  I felt as if I was watching Apocalypto all over again, dreading extreme violence at every turn.  I am sure, I would've liked the film more, had it not had all this blood, and had it been faster paced.  Hopefully, Del Toro's next film will be up there with Blade II.",1180396800,7,665,4.272

Ofelia and her widowed pregnant mother move to an abandoned mill to be with the new stepfather/husband.  The stepfather is a military captain who is fighting against guerilla army that seems to be invisible.  However, the captain is a cruel man.  He is just harsh to everyone.

Upon arrival at the mill, Ofelia discovers a shape-shifting fairy.  The fairy leads her to a world underground.  From there, she meets an ancient faun.  The faun tells her that she of a royal lineage.  But, before she can return to the royal lineage, she must do 3 tasks that comes with explicit instructions.

I just love the everything about this movie.  However, it just left me wishing for more of this other world.  It was such a big tease to get a ""taste"" of this world.  My favorite was this episode where Ofelia was given a magic chalk to retrieve an object.  In this room was a creature who use its hand to see.  You just got to see the movie to see what I'm talking about.  I thought that was such an original idea.

I love how this fairy tale wasn't always so gleefully bright.  I love how suspense were used.  I loved how it left you uncertain if the faun was ""good guy"" or a ""bad guy"" with its own agenda.  *Pan's Labyrinth* was a refreshing break from these predictable films.

This movie is like a cross between ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""We're No Angels,"" in that it is about a journey a little girl takes that happens in the olden days.  She is a girl whose father is very mean because he spends his whole time shaving and not taking her to the zoo or other places kids like.  Consequently she creates a world of her own that is like a zoo, and is filled with magic, crickets, and no carpeting.

The dude with eyes in his hands is excellent and if they ever do a sequel (and I pray that they don't) they should make the whole movie about him.  For instance, what does he eat (besides fairies)?  Why are his eyeballs in his hands?  Does he use saline solution instead of handsoap?  These unanswered questions are just part of the problem I have with this filmmaker's ""vision.""

And what a vision it is.  A lot of this movie is very depressing, and I don't think children should be depressed because they are our future.  Moreover, a better moral would have been for the little girl to overcome some of her ""issues"" and deal with the fact that stepfathers may be a little rough around the edges but at least their eyeballs are in their head.

While the movie is enjoyable, and a must see, it was not nearly as violent as many reviews stated that it would be. Most prolific movie watchers will find little to wince at. Pan's Labyrinth was also not very scary, nor a thriller.

I found the movie to be a bit slow, and thin when it came to the fantasy elements. Trailers make us think that ""Pan"" is a movie that is 90% fantasy scenes. In reality, fantasy elements eat up only about 5-10% of the runtime. Lastly, I found it hard to connect with the characters.

Now, with all this said, I still liked the movie very much. the acting was top notch, and the film making wonderful. The score was a great addition as well. The subtitles can be tricky, especially if you are trying to munch on a movie snack, but halfway through the flick you forget they are there.

Although this film is in Spanish with English subtitles, it does not detract from its impact.  There isn't a single gratuitous or unnecessary scene in this masterpiece.  I'd have given it 6 stars but 5 is all that is allowed.  I am disappointed that this film only received 3 academy awards.  It would have taken best picture if an English sound track were available.

7626287,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is a fairytale for grown-ups, and what a beautiful movie...it follows the life of a young girl, Ofelia [played by a talented young actress, Ivana Baquero] who is forced to leave the city and move to the Spanish countryside together with her expectant mother on the orders of her stepfather, Captain Vidal, a monstrous brute with no human compassion whatsoever. Ofelia's feelings of alienation provides the setting for her entry into the magical underworld of the labyrinth, where she meets a faun who reveals her 'true' identity, an ancient princess of the underworld who needs to complete three tasks in order to reclaim her position. So we have Ofelia coping with the demands set upon her by the faun, and in the real world, we witness Spain's Civil War, with the Captain ruthlessly hunting down dissidents. There are great supporting roles here played by the housekeeper Mercedes who is also helping the rebels, the doctor who treats Ofelia's mother [also aids the rebels], and of course the magical beings that inhabit Ofelia's alternate world. Some of these beings are scary [the baby eating monster for example], but nothing is as scary as the real world inhabited by cruel humans...the Captain's predilection for torture makes for wince-inducing viewing. The cinematography evokes a magical world a la Alice in Wonderland, whilst also showing the stark realities of war. Unlike some of the other reviews, I actually thought the fantasy and real elements merged together quite well...especially where it concerned Ofelia's attempts to help her ill, expectant mother. I did wish that more time had been spent on developing the fantasy element in the story...it just felt like there was a lot more to be said concerning Ofelia's exploration of the 'other' world. As for the score, it is simply haunting. This is definitely an adult movie because of the excessive and graphic violence, and also the frightening images both in the real and imaginary realm. Del Toro has directed a masterpiece that bears repeated viewing.",1180310400,13,2039,5.08955223880597

First class special effects, GREAT story and storyline (just like the anime films by Miyazaki), VERY good acting, SUPERB cinematography and BLOOD AND GORE!!!!!!!! YEEAAAAAAH!!!!

Another thing:

WHY SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS MOVIES IS A SPANISH DUB VERSION???!!

THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE IS SPANISH!! THIS IS NOT A DUB!!

I don't care if you don't want to read the subtitles, but I understand that there are some animes and Hong Kong movies that have the same quality and no english dub as this one, BUT NO ONE COMPLAINS ABOUT THAT!!!

Come on, people! Most of the foreing countries watch the Hollywood movies with their subtitles, why can't you do the same thing????? and if you are not used to hear or watch spanish films then this is a great start!

If one of the reasons to the problem is that people are confused if this movie is a hollywood film or a foreing film then read my review's title.

P.S: Im hispanic, asi que estoy muy orgulloso que hayan hecho una pelicula en espaol la cual tenga la misma calidad que las de Hollywood! Creo que esta es la primera! Que viva el cine en espaol!

7626289,4,B002BYYA9A,"The first of two times I saw writer/director Guillermo Del Toro's Oscar-winning PAN'S LABYRINTH on DVD, it disappointed me because it wasn't at all what the critics led me to expect.  With its echoes of THE WIZARD OF OZ and ALICE IN WONDERLAND, I thought the whole movie would take place in a dark and scary fantasy world with a young girl.  Actually, only half of the movie is dark fantasy.  The other half is real world Spain in 1944 with a sick mother named Carmen (Ariadne Gil) and a brutal Army Captain named Vidal (Sergi Lopez).  With the fabulous young Ivana Baquero as 12 year old heroine Ofelia, this film comes alive on a mandatory second viewing as a dark fantasy masterpiece, especially with immeasurable help from Del Toro's audio commentary on the Spanish Civil War and his film intentions.

We have two worlds in PAN'S LABYRINTH:  the real world of Vidal and Carmen and a housekeeper named Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) in a house.  And a scary fantasy world ruled over by the sympathetic Faun (Doug Jones and elaborate visual effects).  Linking the two worlds are Ofelia, a deep green forest with mossy trees, and an old mill with a whole fantasy universe beneath it.  But only Ofelia can see the fantasy world.  So the movie exists on parallel tracks with careful use of color in both worlds (blues-greens and oranges-browns--the movie won Oscars for Cinematography and Production Design and Makeup).  Faun promises to help Carmen get well if Ofelia will do three tasks (the concept of threes throughout is definitely deliberate).  The Brothers Grimm and Del Toro's own 2001 movie THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE (which Leonard Maltin loved) are also sources as we start to wonder whether the fantasy world really exists, or is all a product of Ofelia's vivid imagination.

Rent or buy the double disk of PAN'S LABYRINTH.  Besides a widescreen transfer and very insightful commentary on disk one with the movie, disk two has a Charlie Rose Show interview with Del Toro and two other great Mexican filmmakers, ""The Power of Myth"" featurette, prosthetic and visual effects, and the careful use of color and the concept of three objects/people throughout.  Disk two also has a Director's Notebook and storyboards and animated comic book plates for the fantasy characters.

The film's ending is controversial; I find it quite haunting.  What if Ofelia herself does not exist or was swallowed up by fantasy creatures--a giant toad, fairies, a man with no face, the grotesque but sympathetic Faun--and can only be seen by people with vivid imaginations?  Del Toro also cites LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD as a filmic source and constantly mentions his own THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, which I guess I have to rent.  But give PAN'S LABYRINTH two viewings before you throw the DVD box across the room in frustration.  This is a filmmaker to study in depth.  And his newest film is a fascinating and wondrous--and sometimes very brutal--adult fairy tale fantasy that was also an Oscar nominee for Foreign Language Film.

The strongest performance came from Sergi Lopez as Captain Vidal.  I was more into the drama unfolding between the grown ups than what Ofelia was going through.  CGI and special effects are really good.  The Brothers Grimm influence is very obvious and nicely done.  Overall, it's pretty good, just not the best film of 2006.",1180224000,,443,4.75
7626291,3,B002BYYA9A,"When I heard first time about the movie made by the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that was a mixture of many genres, including drama, fantasy, thriller, and fairy tale for adults that takes place in Spain of 1944 in two parallel words, one of unbearable bleak and horrifying reality, and the other of deliciously dark magic fantasy, I wanted very much to see it. I knew that the movie has been praised by many critics and has made hundreds top lists of last year, that it was nominated for countless awards including six Academy awards and it won three Oscars, and that it had received 20 minutes standing ovation at Cannes. The main reason for me was the fact that I love del Toro's earlier film, ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror, suspense, and coming of age during the war time story.

I hoped and expected ""Pan's Labyrinth"" to be as compelling, insightful, interesting, and engaging as ""The Devil's Backbone"" was. I finally saw ""Pan's Labyrinth"" couple of days ago and I was disappointed. The movie has an interesting concept, even if not original one. It brings to mind many famous works of literature and the earlier movies about the little girls escaping their dreadful realities of war or death of the loved ones or all sorts of abuse in the world of their imagination such as ""Forbidden Games"", ""Spirits of the Beehive"" (which ""Pan's Labyrinth"" tried to be but never was), the later also takes place in Spain during the Civil war, as well as ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece"".

One movie that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has been often compared to is Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"", his fairy tale for adults, his ""Alice in Wonderland meets Psycho"" which also tells the story of an 11-years-old girl and her world of imagination. ""Tideland"" was released last year and was either ignored or hated by majority of critics and left many viewers puzzled and confused. I am not completely in love with ""Tideland"" but I found it much more interesting that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" in all aspects. The main difference between the two - Gillian does not present reality in his film in the simplistic way and does not divide his characters to devilish monsters or shining knights the way Del Toro does in ""Pan Labyrinth"".

I am not sure what the target audience for Del Toro's film is? Its story (the writer/director was nominated for the best screenplay and I found his writing the weakest and most ridiculous part of the movie) is so naive and primitive that you would think the movie was made for children but its shocking violence and horrifying tortures are not easy to watch even for adults. Another problem is with the characters. I know I should sympathize with Ofelia, and who would not feel empathy for an 11-year-old girl who had to live through the death of her mother and to confront her monstrous step-father but if frankly, her character is not very interesting. As for visual effects and cinematography, the film looks good but not especially spectacular or breathtakingly beautiful. Of five Oscar nominated films for best cinematography from last year, at least three seemed to be more interesting. Gilliam's ""Tideland"" that was completely ignored by the Academy, is always technically superb, visually arresting and much more impressive than ""Pan's Labyrinth"".

I should admit that at least one scene in ""Labyrinth"" was absolutely brilliant - dark and scary it came directly from Francisco Goya's terrifying painting, ""Saturn Devouring His Children"" and it was extremely imaginative. I would not go as far as calling ""Pan's Labyrinth"" a bad movie and give it one star. It is not bad; it is just not as great as I thought it would be. As for all the awards, ""The Devil's Backbone"" is much more deserving than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and that's the film I would give a standing ovation to.",1180137600,5,3910,4.840059790732436
7626292,1,B002BYYA9A,The reviews were great but no where did I find any idea that my DVD would be in Spanish. I thought perhaps someone made a mistake and put it on Spanish until I went to the menu and tried to change it to English but the only English availabe was the subtitles. Either someone made a mistake in packing or this should have been advertised as being in Spanish with English subtitles. Special effects were great but not everyone could keep up with the subtitles and do not like spending time trying to read and miss action in the movie. I only gave it a 1 rating because of this.,1180137600,3,575,4.236363636363636
7626293,5,B002BYYA9A,"The following may be construed as a spoiler, but is really more of a primer:

In fascist Spain, 5 years after the official end of the Spanish Civil War, rebel fighters are still causing problems for a military captain in the wooded north of the country. Rebellion is all around him, even in his own household, but the Captain never demands anything less than absolute obedience, including from his wife Carmen, nearly 9 months pregnant, and Carmen's daughter Ofelia, whose real father died in the Civil War. While Carmen chooses to obey the Captain out of world-weary practicality, Ofelia -- just at the cusp of adolescence -- still retains her sense of fantasy, which ultimately causes her to stray from the Captain's oppressive yoke. She therefore aligns more closely with Mercedes, the head servant in the Captain's house, than she does with her own mother. Mercedes can be seen perhaps as an older version of Ofelia who, while having retained her rebellious nature, has lost her sense of fantasy, and she becomes a surrogate mother for Ofelia as Carmen struggles with a difficult pregnancy.

The film has a mirror story that takes place in the fantasy realm, but nevertheless deals with the same themes of the other: namely, rebellion and obedience. The two sides of the mirror interlock as Ofelia crosses in between them. For instance, in one night, she is forbidden from eating from two nearly identical banquet tables, one in the Captain's home and the other in the lair of a horrible creature whose cruelty resembles that of the Captain. As the film progresses, the two mirror-worlds become more and more closely intertwined, in the end leaving the viewer with a mix of intense emotions, still glued silently to their seat even as the credits have finished rolling, completely overwhelmed. Very few films even aspire to that kind of effect, and I can think of none that actually accomplish it to the degree of Pan's Labyrinth.

If I had to compare it to any existing film, I would probably say Spirited Away. (Like Pan's Labyrinth, Spirited Away is much better in its original language. Thankfully with Pan's Labyrinth, we're not given the option.) There are many stories in literature and film dealing with pre-adolescent girls discovering their own courage through adventures in Wonderlands, some darker and more sinister than others, but they invariably fail if at least the smarter girls in that age group cannot be considered among the target audience. So while Pan's Labyrinth and Spirited Away contain some pretty horrifying images not found in the sterilized world of PG and G-rated fare churned out here in the states, it's important to keep in mind just how intelligent girls that age are capable of being -- though maybe fewer than 1 in 10 actually are (the same goes for boys) -- and we should give those deserving few credit for that. Personally, if I were the parent of a 9 year-old who'd read every Harry Potter book, I think it would be highly constructive for her to watch Pan's Labyrinth. Nightmares be damned, as well as MPAA condescension.",1180051200,2,3067,4.882917466410748
7626294,5,B002BYYA9A,"I heard about this and have seen the trailers.  I'd figure I would pick up the DVD because of the trailers.  I just finished watching it and I will say that it isn't good....it's GREAT!!!  It does pay a slight homage to some of the fairy tales of the past (including Wizard of Oz) but it does take a slight twist.  Del Toro's vision is truely unique on this project and I can see why it has gotten the the good reviews it has gotten.

From beginning to end, I found myself entranced with the story.  A tad violent here and there (the Captain smashing in the one guy's nose with a bottle was a tad over the top) and aside from it being done in Spanish with subtitles (again....a minor oversight),....it is worth the watch.  It was a bit of a sad ending,....but also somewhat happy when you watch it.  It's good to know that a person of any age can have one foot in reality and one foot in fantasy.  It's just a pain to figure out which foot goes where.  But again.....this is one of those movies that you watch where it sticks with you and it is a joy to watch regardless of any age you are.",1180051200,3,1090,4.123222748815166
7626295,5,B002BYYA9A,"Guillermo del Toro has made an unusual adult film about a child's fantasy world in ""Pan's Labyrinth"", which juxtaposes magic and violence in World War II-era Spain. In 1944, young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) travels with her mother (Adriadna Gil) from a war-torn city to the mountains to meet her new stepfather. Ofelia is an imaginative girl often engrossed in her fairy tale books. Her mother is expecting a child, and her new husband, the fastidious fascist Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), has insisted that she join him. Ofelia and Vidal take an immediate dislike to one another, but the country fires Ofelia's imagination. She is led to an ancient portal guarded by a faun named Pan (Doug Jones). Pan assumes Ofelia is the Princess Moanna, who left the underworld long ago to live among humans, but who is prophesied to return. Ofelia must complete 3 tasks in order to be readmitted to her kingdom. Meanwhile, Captain Vidal ruthlessly and indiscriminately battles Republican rebels, who find sympathy among the locals.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" alludes to various other works of fantasy, and its symbolism isn't slight. But Ofelia is engaging and her fantasies so vivid that the film never seems to be going over old territory. This may be due to the story's immersion in the real, intensely violent and unjust world of civil conflict in Spain. A child's fantasies take on greater meaning in contrast to and as commentary on the turbulent and dangerous world around her. The fantasy world is not safe or forthright but presents the kind of choices that the adults around her make. Perhaps it's unusual to make a fantasy film exclusively for older viewers, but the real-world violence in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is too graphic and sadistic for young children and may unsettle some adults. Nevertheless, this is a beautiful film that engrosses the viewer in the fight to determine Spain's future and a child's conception of a fantastic world in which she too battles for what she holds dear -enabled in no small part by Guillermo Navarro continually gliding camera. In Spanish with English subtitles.

The DVD (New Line 2007 single disc): There is an unnecessary ""Director's Prologue"" (24 sec) in which the director introduces the film. Under ""Marketing Campaign"", there is Poster Art (7), a teaser trailer (1 min), a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min), and 7 short TV spots (4 min). There is a good audio commentary in English by director Guillermo del Toro. He discusses this film as a companion piece to ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), the themes of choice and disobedience, magic and violence, the role of violence in the film, symbolism, staging the real vs fantasy worlds, sources for some of the material, camera work, color palette, and blending reality and fantasy. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.",1180051200,,2812,4.99360341151386
7626296,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth was the best film of 2006 (and I'm a big Scorsese fan). By combining good and evil, beauty and horror in both the real world and a fantasy world the viewer is transported into a stunning cinematic experience. Ofelia is a lonely young girl who must confront her fears in  worn torn Spain (cicra 1944). She does this by entering a fantasy world. It is unclear if this is a real experience or imagined. That's the beauty of the film: it can be taken on many levels with a depth that's seemingly bottomless. Her stepfather is more vicious than any monster in a fairy tale. The tasks the characters (including Ofelia) must accomplish in the real world are comparable to a quest by a hero in a fantasy world. These world's are bridged flawlessly. To tell any more would spoil the adventure. This film is a moving experience that will stay with you. If you're a fan of fantasy (Lord of the Rings), war films (Saving Private Ryan) and fine foreign films (yes, it combines all three!) this DVD should be your next purchase.

One would think that as long as DVD has been out, issues with encoding would all be sorted out. Not so here, the last 25% of this movie is basically unwatchable (seriously) due to motion artifacting. Most people won't see this due to their DVD player doing automatch deinterlacing. (I use a seperate video processor)

I believe the movie was half encoded in standard film (24fps progressive) DVD transfer and half as 30fps interlaced. Even if you don't notice the INT combing, your losing lots of video quality for the most important parts of the film.

Remarkable acting from young Ivana Baquero as a girl who must contend with her pregnant mother's illness, her military stepfather's cruelty  towards the peasant revolutionaries, and her own interior world of magic realism/fantasy, involving creatures who send her on increasingly dangerous missions to perform certain tasks before the moon is full.

The fairy tale aspects revolves around Ofelia, her pregnant mother and her new "" evil step father."" The new life that she has been thrusted upon her lacks love and is filled with only harsh commands from her step father. Ofelia turns to the magical stories from her treasured books and surrounds herself in a world of mystical creatures who challenges her to complete 3 tasks before she can reclaim her throne. Her escape into this fanatsy world is dark and sometimes gruesome but in comparison,the real worlds brutal violence is shown to be more horrific and extreme.

I hesitate to use the word ""masterpiece"" or ""future classic"" in describing this film, but what I will say is that I think it is perfect in the sense that director Guillermo Del Toro accomplished everything he set out to do when making this film: to create a spellbinding, visually stunning fairy tale for adults that operates and succeeds on multiple levels.  This is the type of film that after you watch it you'll want to recommend it to all your friends, even those who aren't into films.  Anyone who doesn't like it, well, if they don't like this you might just never recommend them a film again.

My one and only criticism with Pan's Labyrinth is the violence.  I realize that Del Toro isn't making a ""kid's"" film with Pan's Labyrinth and that violence is an integral part of the tale he's weaving but he really seems to revel in it.  Because of this, it took me out of the film at times as I started thinking ""Is that really necessary?""

Despite the violence, this film is a must-see in every sense of the word.  Guillermo Del Toro, if you're reading this, you have a fan.",1179878400,4,1414,4.987234042553191
7626302,5,B002BYYA9A,"It's rare that I like a movie that's been highly recommended to me, especially a movie that was recommended so highly to me.  But I liked this one.  I read about it, heard about it, saw the previews... and the movie was exactly what I thought it was going to be.  For starters, the effects were beautiful.  For another, the script was incredibly well-written.  There was great acting in this play.  Great, beautiful acting.  The characters were realistic and the story-line was compelling.  Was there anything wrong with this movie?  Any fault at all?  Well, I thought there was going to be when I assumed they killed Pedro and then were going to kill Mercedes.  My fears were, thankfully, unfounded.  I was a bit upset when they killed Ofelia, but when they showed her being reunited with her real mother and father (or was she?), I understood and was no longer disappointed.  So, basically, no, there were no faults I could find with it.

Another thing I really liked about this movie was how they made you wonder if it was all in the little girl's mind.  Was she really a princess?  Did that place really exist?  Both yes and no could be argued quite well with how this movie was done, and I loved that.

There is one thing I want to address.  One commenter here continues to stress something about this being a children's movie.  I didn't know that rated Children's movies R, now.  I didn't know that language, violence, and gore were appropriate for children.  When did that happen?

All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  Brilliant.  Now this was all I heard it was, and more.",1179878400,5,1587,4.562277580071174
7626303,5,B002BYYA9A,"This movie, is at the very least worth renting. I purchased it because I like to see what is being done around the world with CG artwork. And this movie doesn't disappoint. It's literally a visual feast for the eyes, the subtle use of colour filters, the CG work, the sets, the costuming, the creature work is wonderful and refreshing.

The story itself is well written combining fairy tale, magic and reality. And, as the previous reviewer pointed out, it isn't disney-fied, which is always a bonus. The use of the mandrake root as a sympathetic simulacrum to absorb the mother's illness with her pregnancy is a glimpse into the insight of folk-medicine/magic of the past, and I find it marvelous to see some of these things being worked into stories written today. Too often, the 'witches' of the old days are portrayed as hags. In reality, they would have been the healers of their day, using herbs and 'magic' to heal people, or curse them. I didn't say they were nice.

Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful story in it's own right, and perhaps, not for small children of today's world, they're too used to Disney's version of everything by now. I purchased it because I wanted to see the CG work and was very pleased with it overall.

7626304,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is a very hard film to recommend.  This may come as a shock to some, both those who have seen it and loved it, and those who haven't but have heard that it's a great picture.  But it's the truth.  Since I saw it, I've encountered those who I thought would like it but didn't and vise versa.  And of course, there were those who I immediately knew would hate it, and they did.  I love this film and I adamantly defend it, but it is by no means for everyone.  The marketing doesn't help either.  This is not even close to The Lord of the Rings.  Nor is it strictly a fantasy film.  Although it does have a certain fairy tale quality, it refuses to be confined to any one genre, and ultimately, the lines between the fantastic and the realistic are left for the viewer to decide where they are drawn.

The film takes place during the 1940s in fascist Spain.  An imaginative young girl, Ofelia, is being forced to live with her stepfather, a cruel man known as the Captain.  Ofelia's mother is pregnant and sick.  So one night, Ofelia wanders into a nearby labyrinth where she meets a faun.  The faun tells Ofelia that she can help her mother and escape the terrible place she's in if she completes three quests for him.

The biggest complaint I hear about the film is the amount of violence.  There is an unfortunate amount of people who dismiss the film as being nothing more than an experiment in cruelty.  For those who haven't seen it, yes, this is a violent picture.  There are scenes that may make you feel uncomfortable.  If they do, then the film is working.  With the exception of one scene, all the violence is centered on the Captain.  The director uses violence so that every time the character is on screen, the viewer is filled with a sense of dread.  You are meant to fear this man and be disgusted by him, and the director wants to make sure that you are.  It is not violence for the sake of violence.  It is used as a legitimate film making tool.  Some may argue that the film would have been more effective if you didn't see the violence, but I don't think that's the case in Pan's Labyrinth.  It's the harsh reality of the world that Ofelia lives in, and del Toro wants you to understand and share her desire to get out of it.  It works brilliantly.

If you can get past the violence, you'll find a truly amazing film.  The visuals are stunning and deserve every bit of praise they've achieved.  It's good to see a film that relies on makeup and costumes more than computer effects.  The cast is good enough to make you forget that you are even reading subtitles.  As unlikable as the Captain is, the actor does a truly phenomenal job.  The cinematography is quite remarkable as well (Oscar worthy, I'm not sure...Children of Men may have had it beat).  Two different styles were needed, and they were both pulled off very well.

For me, the greatest achievement that Pan's Labyrinth makes it the things that it leaves you with and none of them are made too obvious.  Some have called the picture deeply depressing, but I disagree.  There are a number of positive and hopeful things to be taken here.  It all depends on your interpretation and what you choose to believe.  For a film that walks a fine line between fantasy and reality and between the innocence and cruelty that the human heart has the capacity for, it's appropriate that it leaves you with the questions that it does.  It's a film that has something to say, and wants you to think about it and to feel something.  That may not sit well with an audience who'd rather see lovable ogres and talking donkeys.  If you think you can handle the violence and don't mind reading, I urge you to watch Pan's Labyrinth.  Find someone who can watch it with you.  When it's over, talk about it, and discover things you may not have noticed about it on your own.  You'll find your appreciation growing the more you think about it.",1179792000,4,3914,4.4125874125874125
7626305,5,B002BYYA9A,"I first saw this movie when it was in the theatre, and man was I blown away. Just the way the director captures the beauty of fairy tale creatures is enough to give this movie 5 stars. Not only is the movie a feast for the eyes, but it has a great soundtrack that keeps it rolling along. The whole time you will be kept on the edge of your seats waiting for more and you will not be dissapointed.

  The movie starts off with a little girl named Ofelia who likes to read fairy tales, and throughout the movie she discovers that she herself is part of a fairy tale. The movie is set in Spain after World War II, and Ofelia finds herself in the middle of a civil war. Ofelia is also facing troubles of her own, her mother is having problems with her pregnancy, and her father-in-law does not like her. Ofelia then stumbles upon a Labyrinth and there she discovers that she is part of a magical kingdom who is waiting for her return. But in order to return home she must complete three tasks before the next full moon, or else the portal will close forever.

  Even though every task is more difficult then the one before, Ofelia presses on. She finds herself facing life threatening tasks and manages to overcome her first two tasks with the help of her fairy friends. I don't want to give away the ending, but trusts me everyone gets what they deserve.

  The acting is incredible, each and every character is brought to life, human and creature alike. You might also wonder, Why is a movie this beautiful rated R? Well because it is not for kids.

7626306,4,B002BYYA9A,"This movie of course has been praised by critics and regular viewers alike which made me wonder what was so great about this rather mysterious film- and also after seeing the rather compelling commercials I just had to see this when it came out.

I won't go over the details since so many others here have but I agree with most that this is a very successful film overall. It keeps you hooked from the very first few minutes till the end that has a conclusion that left at least I very satisfied; the story was solid and very entertaining because the cast carried it out very well. The scenes are beautiful especially and at times quite chilling for different reasons at different times of the film. For a good portion of the time this movie is a fascinating adult fantasy, and the rest of the time it is a bleak world set in Spain following the civil war and they mixed both parts so well together- I am amazed honestly.

Because honestly if not done right this movie could have been a complete mess- it instead though is a great success. I highly recommend this movie.

7626307,5,B002BYYA9A,"There are some films that film makers are born to make.  For Guillermo Del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth is that film.  Taking place in 1944 Spain, Pan's Labyrinth revolves around young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who seeks to escape the horrifying world she lives in.  Her tender mother (Ariadna Gil) is newly married and carrying the son of the cruel and blood thirsty Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), who enjoyes torturing the prisoners he captures.  Ofelia however gets a surprise upon discovering the labyrinth in the woods, which is populated by the Faun (Doug Jones, better known as the guy in the Ape Sapien suit in Del Toro's adaptation of Hellboy) who informs her that she is the re-incarnated daughter of the King of the underworld.  She is given three tasks to perform, each the more dire, until the film reaches it's startling and heart wrenching conclusion.  Despite some of the film's incredibly bloody and violent scenes, Pan's Labyrinth is a beautifuly realized film.  Del Toro's inventive direction combined with the gloomy atmosphere and brilliant make up effects are a sight to behold, and that's saying it lightly.  Be warned though that Pan's Labyrinth is not a film for all tastes, and those who don't like fairy tale elements that aren't kid tested and Disney approved will certainly not enjoy this film to say the least.  That being said though, films like Pan's Labyrinth come along all so rarely, which makes it all the more enjoyable.

The cinematographic elements in this movie are very fine tuned - it is gorgeous to look at..

7626314,5,B002BYYA9A,"PAN'S LABYRINTH is a mystery cloaked in the garb of a fairy tale for adults. It is an examination of the cruelty of the Civil War in Spain as Franco assumed prominence and the extent to which some people would resist or escape: one of those means of escape just happens to be fantasy.  Writer/Director Guillermo del Toro proves his potential as one of the more important experimental filmmakers with this haunting, mesmerizing tale of a young girl's ability to cope with the world into which she is plunged.

Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is the eleven year old daughter of Carmen (Adriana Gil) whom we first meet as the mother and daughter move to the deserted mill to live with Carmen's sadistic and brutal new husband, Falangist Capitn Vidal (Sergi Lpez). Carmen is pregnant with Vidal's child and upon her arrival she is ordered to bed attended by the housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verd). Ofelia is frightened by Vidal and his cruel world and by the deteriorating condition of her very pregnant mother and follows a strange insect that leads her to a secret opening into a labyrinth.  Her curiosity and desperation to find a better place leads to her discovery of an entirely different world beneath the ground, a world run by the Faun (Doug Jones) who gives Ofelia three tasks that will assist her in making her world above ground a better place. Ofelia must choose between the ever increasing terror surrounding her new home with Vidal and his heinous behavior and overcome the fear of the grotesque but fascinating world of Pan's Labyrinth: the story ends with the manner in which a child must face the realities of the failure of the adult world and find successful solutions - whether those solutions be reality or fantasy.

Guillermo del Toro has chosen a superb cast of actors, extraordinary visual effects technicians, cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and music composer Javier Navarrete to create this magical tale. The film becomes one of the finest examples of the use of fantasy in an historical setting. It is bound to become a classic.  Grady Harp, May 07",1179705600,9,2067,4.860795454545454
7626315,2,B002BYYA9A,"I was very anxious to see this movie, as I had heard critical acclaim and thought the premise sounded very intriguing.  I have to say that I was disappointed.

I knew the story was set during the Spanish Civil War and that it would be violent, sometimes brutally so.  I also knew that much of the film would not take place in the fantasy world created by the young Ophelia.  However, the title IS ""Pan's Labryinth"" after all, and the previews show almost exclusively fantasy scenes.  Thus, I thought it reasonable to expect that half or more of the movie would be fantasy-based.  In reality, only ~15-20 minutes of the two hour movie are fantasy, and in fact Ophelia nearly disappears from the story entirely for about half of the second hour.

This point created a disconnect. The critics indicated that the story shows how Ophelia creates a fantasy world to escape the horrors around her.  However, most of the truly horrific scenes in the movie don't have Ophelia in them at all.  That made some of the violence simply gratuitous and distracting from the ""young girl creates her own fantasy world"" theme.  Also, the first two quests that are given to Ophelia by the faun don't really advance the main story in any way.  I felt the fantasy scenes were too disconnected from the rest of the story to be the central theme.

If the central theme was intended to revolve around the horrors of war, then (aside from a different title and trailer) the movie needed to develop the backstory of the rebels--and perhaps even the captain-- better.  As it was, most of the violence centered around one ficticious captain, which again made the violence seem gratuitous.

The movie was beautifully shot, and I found it to be well acted overall.  I can appreciate the effort, and I even understand how some people could find this film entrancing and enjoyable.  But, for me, it fell short in what I consider to be key: it lacked a central theme, seeming instead to be a collection of sub-plots that never fully developed themselves.",1179705600,32,2020,4.6798866855524075

7626319,5,B002BYYA9A,"Immersed in mystical fairies and demoniac monstrosities, Pan's Labyrinth is an enchanting tale of spellbinding imagination contrasting with the austere realities of war. A strikingly mature fantasy fused with fervid violence, staggering visuals and ingenious creations, this macabre fairy tale is the most innovative and beautiful film of the year.

Dreamy little Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is taken to an army stronghold with her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) to live with her stepfather, the merciless Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). It is 1944 in the aftermath of the Spanish Revolution, where Vidal is anxious to destroy a remnant rebel group hiding in the surrounding forest. Alone and powerless, immersed in violence and cruelty, Ofelia explores a stone labyrinth that houses the magical faun Pan. As he bestows upon her several daunting tasks, Ofelia lives out her own dark fable as she confronts monsters both hellishly alien and all too human.

The character and creature designs are simply phenomenal. The human characters are excellently depicted, allowing the audience to truly despise the villains and root for the heroes. There's nothing worse than feeling sorry for the bad guy when he gets it in the end. This film ensures that you don't. It is the fantastical monstrosities however, that are the true visual feast, such as Pan himself, a minotaur-like faun covered with scaly skin and fleshy branches and leaves, and crowned with enormous diabolic horns. The Pale Man is also a prime example of wicked genius; he is pasty white with thick, sagging flesh and bleeding red eyeballs affixed in the palms of his hands, and must thrust them in front of him to guide his twitching stride. Both characters employ brilliant prosthetics and makeup, magnificently brought to life by actor Doug Jones. To further mystify the viewer, the full body designs include fragile stilt-like legs that couldn't possibly house a man in a rubber suit.

As we all know, special effects don't make the movie, and exemplarily Pan's Labyrinth uses such effects to perfectly compliment an inspired story full of imaginative originality. Including predefined mythological concoctions such as the faun, fairies and a mandrake, Pan's Labyrinth beautifully melds familiar fantasy myths with its abundance of unique and devilish creations. The central motif is a brilliant parallel to those creatures, and fuses themes of fervid imagination and brutal reality, love, innocence, bravery and sacrifice. Contrasting against the gritty background of the Spanish Revolution, Pan's world is both a dreamy escape and a nightmarish prison.

The acting too is commendable, most notably with Ivana Baquero, who evokes an exquisite blend of compassion and emotion. Del Toro favorite Doug Jones gets us so immersed in Pan's fantasy world that perhaps the only fault with the film is the relatively short amount of screen time the elusive faun receives. Acting aside, this likely nominee for the Best Cinematography Oscar features ominous structures, old creaking buildings, and winding stone labyrinths that mark the forested landscape...",1179619200,,3103,5.352459016393443

I saw the advertisments about this movie on TV.. not one thing was mentioned about this being a Spanish spoken movie.  The title is on english, all of the text written on the packaging for this movie is in English.  So exactly how was I supposed to know that this movie is entirely spoken in Spanish until I put it in my DVD player.  Oh yeah - the microscopic print at the very bottom of the packaging says Spanish.  Which I found AFTER putting the DVD in my player and realized it was all in Spanish with only English subtitles.  I didn't even bother getting past the opening credits.  I love Anime, but I do not enjoy READING my movies.  I just wish to relax and be entertained, not schooled in another language.  When they came out with other movies in the past that were all in Spanish - it CLEARLY STATED that it was all in Spanish!!  So now I have a movie that looks great, but I can not enjoy because I have to spend most of my attention to the darn subtitles instead of the surroundings and details of the movie which certainly looks very well made.  So how about an ENGLISH dubbed version for us Americans who do not speak Spanish as a first or second language???  Or put the title of the movie in Spanish so it becomes very obvious that this is a Spanish spoken movie.  I looked it up and there is a Spanish word for ""Pan's Labyrinth"" it's ""Laberinto de cacerola"".

The extras on Disc 2 will help you understand the film on a deeper level  so if you are ignorant about such things, go ahead and watch Disc 2 first. That way you'll have a far greater appreciation for the film.

Regarding the horrific violence; it's not gratuitous and I loved it.  The aggression and sadism only added o the R-rated appeal of a fairy tale film, like Anne Rice's Beauty Series. Once again, this isn't a movie for dim witted artistically conservative viewers.

7626327,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth was undoubtedly one of the most captivating movies I have ever seen.  I will admit, the depths of human cruelty in this movie were violently disturbing but when you look beyond that, there is a fantastic story being told.  I felt as though the story was very well blended with fantasy and real life elements.  Honestly, if you give this movie a chance, the subtitles will NOT detract from the story or the gorgeous cinematography that the movie portrays.  Do not expect this movie to be a Disney fairy tale or a complete fantasy.  There are some harsh real life realities interwoven into the plot.  This is definitely not a movie for children or those who like fluffy feel-good films.

I think the level of violence in this film comes from a cultural difference in movie making.  I find that American audiences love a lot of movie violence (car chases, explosions, blood splatters, etc.) where as this movie portrays a more real life violence more often seen in real life war situations.  Seriously, though, this movie was not as violent as some very popular films I have seen.  Saving Private Ryan anyone?  This movie did not touch that level of violence.

In my opinion, the reason Del Toro did not concentrate wholly on the fantastical portions of the film is because the fantasy relied so heavily on what was going on in Ofelia's real life.  She was so ready to believe the faun when he said she was a princess because she wanted escape.  She was alone and afraid and when the faun gave her a chance to leave those fears behind, she took it.  It was also easy for her to accept the fantasy because she believed in it already or she wanted to believe in it, exemplified by the type of books that she insistently read.  The fantasy and her real life became so intertwined to the point that the viewer couldn't tell anymore whether it was in her head or real.  It really does not make a difference which it is, the point is that Ofelia needed escape and this was her medium to do so.

Yes, the fantasy stuff is beautifully done, but it is the intense drama and branching conflicts within these storylines that will have you captivated. The other worldy elements combine with the the melodrama perfectly here, each playing an important part in the slow unraveling of a far more intricate tale than I expected.

7626329,5,B002BYYA9A,"Mexican born director, Guillermo del Toro's magnificently crafted fantasy ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a film geared toward an adult audience. Filmed in Spain, it is set in the post Spanish Civil War countryside in 1944.  A young girl Ofelia played superbly by Ivana Baquero is being transported along with her mother to an uncertain future in a rural province.

Her widowed mother Carmen played by Ariadna Gil has remarried and is joining her new husband Captain Vidal played by Sergi Lopez.  The captain is a grotesque sadistic martinet who cares only for the baby carried by the pregnant Carmen.  The draconian circumstances of her surroundings pushes Ofelia into a fantasy world populated by fairies and a faun like creature presumably Pan.

The fantasy world is based in a stone labyrinth adjacent to the mill in which the captain and his troops are headquartered.  She is convinced that she is Princess Moana, daughter of the king of the underworld.  She must perform some tasks designated by the faun to re-enter this magical land.

del Toro finds a proper balance between fantasy and reality to tell this touching story in which a young child must navigate herself through a series of dire incidents which will delineate her future.",1179532800,3,1232,4.975609756097561

I'm not saying that it's a BAD movie - it isn't - only that it fell short of my expectations. Why? For several reasons. First, the story was intentionally derivative of many other myths and movies. The idea of juxtaposing the ugly reality of Fascist Spain with a fantasy world was somewhat original, but overall the movie had a ""been there, seen that"" feel to it.  The acting is excellent, but production values verge on cheesy: grainy, dark, day-for-night shots, etc. A lot like the cheap movies Elvira used to host on the midnight movies of long ago.  And the first half of the movie moves VERY slowly. So, while I found ""Pan's Labyrinth"" interesting, I'd rank it as only slightly above average overall.",1179532800,,806,4.709219858156028

Anyway, I enjoyed the story very much. As has already been indicated in many other reviews, it is a fairy-tale for adults. It is for adults because of the language. Personally, I can imagine that the movie would have been every bit as good if all the foul language (all of it spoken almost exclusively by the Captain) had been left out. Other than the gratuitous language there is the violence (again -- most of it attributed to the captain). A couple of the scenes were particularly disturbing -- but I will say that the language and violence overall tended more toward the moderate and not the excessive -- they were not so much over the top.

Personally, (and this would be a subjective appraisal) I was just a little disappointed with the ending of the movie in that it seemed rushed at the very end. It was satisfying story-wise but the director seems to have compressed it to a quick few minutes when intuitively I felt it should have been explored further. I would give the particular details but I know that often people are irritated by others spoiling a movie by revealing those particular details before they have seen the movie.

Conclusion:

While it is not a perfect movie, I think that the average adult person very likely 'will' enjoy watching it (even 'with' having to read the english subtitles to follow it).

This is one of the better fantasy movies to come along in a long time.

In a few months I will watch it again with the audio commentary playing to find out how the director brought it all together. (By the way, there's a short prologue in the menu on the disk (lasting only a minute or so) in which the director makes a reference to this movie very nearly killing him. Perhaps listening to the commentary will provide more details about that.)

I am very happy that I bought it.

I recommend it enthusiastically!

(Just a side note):

I bought the Single-Disc Edition of this movie.

My product arrived damaged. (The plastic center piece that keeps the dvd from sliding around in its case was broken and rattling around inside.)

7626334,5,B002BYYA9A,"Let me start this review by giving some details about the genre of story telling we know as ""Fairy Tales"". This genre of known as ""Fairy Tales"" was never originally intended for children. In fact there is a lot of historical evidence which points to the fact that most of these old stories were written by adults and meant only for adults.

The original nature of ""Fairy Tales"" was not meant to make you feel all good inside and nor were they to always end with ""And they all lived happily ever after...The End"". As others have pointed out we can all blame Disney for ""dumbing"" down this type of genre of story telling. Neither was this form of story telling meant to always include ""High Fantasy"". A lot of ""Fairy Tales"" actually have only bits and pieces of fantasy in them to help further a story along and to draw in the listener/viewer/reader further into the plot.

I won't go to deep into the plot of this film but the director Guillermo Del Toro seems to go back to the roots of the original and lost art form of ""Fairy Tales"". Guillermo Del Toro in my honest opinion does an outstanding job of interweaving fantasy with reality. Yet he does not allow the fantasy portions of this film to overwhelm the reality based portions or the viewer. The fantasy portions are meant to force you to make that extra emotional leap. To engage you further into a main story which is all so cruelly based in reality. The reality being the post-Spanish Civil War era in Spain and a little girl with a cruel and self-absorbed step-father who is an officer in the Franco's fascists military. Guillermo Del Toro then wraps it up with a great group of actors and a hard hitting ending.

My only complaint is that as others have noted the fantasy portion at the end might have been added to appease American audiences. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie and get to that part. The reality portion of the ending stood strong without the need to include a semi-happy ending if you can call it one. The movie does hit the viewer very hard emotionally. Frankly speaking I'll be honest and admit that as a man I did cry at end.

I couldn't help it because maybe I just have a heart and a soft spot for kids. I feel that any movie, book, song, poem, etc that can draw out a strong emotional reaction has reached the apex of its art form in its given genre. Oh and yes there are portions of this film that are extremely violent and should not be viewed by younger children. As others have noted this move has an ""R"" rating for a very good reason as it's meant for adults only. Besides I'll doubt that many young children could keep up with a foreign film done entirely in Spanish let alone understand the slight and subtle plot twists of this movie including the ending.

P.S. This is a master piece of a film. To dub this film into English would be like dubbing Karl Orff's vocal portions of  ""Carmina Burana"" into English. For those who are angry that this movie is done entirely in Spanish well all I can say is that you should learn to speak a second language for goodness sake! Or just learn to deal with subtitles in foreign films and try to follow along with the story as best you can.

Our society is going to become increasingly more globally oriented as technology and time march onward toward the future. The very nature of our increasingly global economy will demand that you if not your children learn at least a second language. This will grow increasingly true for every other generation hence afterwards when you, I and your children's generation are no more.

If you had no idea that this movie was a foreign film then I can understand and forgive the confusion but at least try to give this film a chance.",1179360000,16,3714,4.419590643274854
7626335,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth in many ways is like the answer to the Chronicles of Narnia or Bridge to Terabithia. If you weren't fond of the kiddyness of those movies, a more adult fairy tale came your way in 2006 done by Guillermo Del Toro, director of Hellboy and Blade II. The problem with the latter 2 films was that they were alright films for what they were but they never really transcended the genre it was in. Hellboy was a well-made comic book film but it didn't reach the status that X-Men 2 or the 1978 Superman film got to that makes it a great film period, whether it was comic book or not. Pan's Labyrinth however is not only a worthy addition to the fantasy genre but it's one of the better films found within it.

Set in Spain 1944, Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen is travelling the countryside to be with Captain Vidal, Carmen's new husband in the Spanish army. Vidal is certainly not the most sympathetic to say the least so Ofelia's fascination with stories and fairy tales useful. However she realizes in the woods outside the house lies an ancient cave and a magical faun who tells her she's Princess Moanna, princess of the underworld. But in order to prove her worth, she has to complete 3 tasks which are particularly dangerous and finds herself trapped between the violent real world and a magical fantasy world that may or may not exist.

I should get something out of the way since people might have a misconception about the film. When I say this is a fairytale for the more adult set, I mean it. There's some violent, bloody acts (you should see what Vidal does with a beer bottle) and one particular unnerving scene involving a creature known as the Pale Man is evidence this is not for the youngsters. But in a way it's nice to have an film like this where the more harsh realities of life can co-exist with the more fantastic elements that are possibly out there. If there's one thing that can potentially turn people off is that the more fantasy elements are not that numerous with many scenes devoted to Vidal and his battle with fighters in the mountains. But it's also a healthy balance with one side not overpowering the other side and making it too cheesy or too serious.

No fairytale would be complete without a main character to lead us through their journey and I can't imagine anyone better than Ivana Baquero who is very believable as Ofelia and is quite a performance beyond her age. And Sergi Lopez plays probably the nastiest, brutal character to come around in awhile. He's downright vicious and he's one character you wouldn't want to cross. There's also some good performances from Maribel Verdu and Ariadna Gil as Mercedes, the house's caretaker and Carmen respectively. Also special attention should be made for Doug Jones playing the faun Pan as well as the Pale Man (that eyes-in-palms dude in the the trailers) who always manages to pull off convincing performances under heavy makeup.

The special features on Del Toro movies tend to be quite plentiful and this is no different. Disc 1 houses a director's prologue (essentially one of those ""I hope you enjoy this movie"" things lasting 30 seconds or so) as well as an excellent audio commentary Del Toro does solo. Disc 2 has the bulk of it with looks into the set designs and the looks of things to the music as well as a good Charlie Rose interview which features Del Toro, Alfonso Cuaron (director of the excellent Children of Men) and Alejandro Gonzales Innaritu (director of the average-except-for-the-Japanese-storyline Babel).

Released the same day as this was the Fountain, which was one of those fantasy films that tried to hit you in different places yet came across feeling calculated and cold. Pan's Labyrinth on the other hand felt like a labor of love and for once, a passion that actually makes a good film in the end.",1179360000,6,3834,4.640648011782033
7626336,5,B002BYYA9A,"""The Mexican-born writer-director Guillermo del Toro is the most accomplished fantasist in contemporary cinema, a master creator of images, atmosphere and mood who uses his visionary's gifts to do what others cannot: make imaginary worlds seem more real than reality itself."" Kenneth Turan

Guillermo Del Toro's , Pan's Labyrinth, is about young Ofelia, Ivana Baquero, who finds a gateway to a  world of gods and monsters, pain and pleasure. Ofelia  is her mother's best friend, and loves her very much.  Her mother has married a man who isn't just wicked, he is the personification of evil. He is  a Captain in Franco's army after the right-wing has seized Spain, The best fantasy takes place in a world between good and evil, desire and sacrifice, cruelty and mercy, freedom and slavery. This fantasy resembles the real world, and is an adult fantasy film. When Ofelia finds a  kingdom in the labyrinth  near her new home, it's a  place full of unreal creatures and a smiling-scary satyr , protrayed disarmingly by Doug Jones.  Ofelia's stepfather is dedicated to wiping out the republican holdouts and local partisans by any means necessary. The satyr explains to Ophelia that she is a lost princess, and she can return to where she belongs if she carries out the three tasks he gives her, without fail and without question.

Ariadna Gil is Ofelia's pregnant mother  and Maribel Verd&uacute; , Mercedes is a woman on the side of the resistance, and are the two women in the film who bring love to life and who portray the loving side of life.

The  fantasy sequences mix practical effects and computer animation have a terrible, beautiful quality to them. The scenes in the real world contrast the peace and beauty of nature with the brutality of war. Pan's Labyrinth is  bloody and disturbing, but adult fantasy fans will find it a glorious, gripping feast for the eyes.

""Del Toro never coddles the audience. He means for us to leave Pan's Labyrinth shaken to our souls. He succeeds triumphantly. "" Peter Travers

This is a tale within a tale, a creation in which the actual and the symbolic are so intertwined that we are happy to rid ourselves of logic.  The movie's lingering seven-note musical theme by Javier Navarrete's is so haunting when hummed and that tune will not leave my mind.  The movie is a masterpiece, and I had to sit and ponder for awhile before I was brought back to reality. Well worth the Oscars and prizes it has won,  The addition of the second disc is enteratianing and informative. The use of fairy tale mythology in the film is well worth the view.

Beautifully, marvelously,highly recommended for adults.  prisrob 5-17-07

7626337,5,B002BYYA9A,"WARNING: THE FILM IS IN SPANISH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. SUCK IT UP!

What's to say that hasn't been said? Not much. I'll review the dvd itself.

I purchased the 2-disc edition, which is the only way to go (don't kid yourself).

The first disc features the film in 1:85 anamorphic widescreen. The soundtrack is presented in Dolby Digital-Dts 6.1 discrete.

Pan's features an audio commentary by Guillermo Del Toro (features an introduction to the film as well) in which he tells you exactly what's going on. There's lots of clarifications for those that did not like the ending.

Disc number 2 features abandoned creature designs, set designs, etc...

Supplements include a creature effects ""making of"" with DDT effects, and Pan himself Doug Jones.

A virtual comic book with several of the character's origins that kind of serve as a prologue to the film is included. I think Hellboy did the same, it enhances the storyline.

Now my favorite of the featurettes.

Guillermo Del Toro, Alfonso Cuaron, and Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarittu sit down with Charlie Rose for a ""round the table"" discussion about their art.

I don't think I've ever had this much fun watching an interview, but I was laughing pretty hard at some of the jokes being thrown all around. They act like real brothers constantly goofing on each other. Charlie has fun talking with them.

Funny enough each of them have worked on each others films since the begining of their careers. Guillermo helped edit Amores Perros, and Alfonso Cuaron also produced Pan's Labyrinth. It's 6 degrees of separation.

Note: This movie IS NOT FOR CHILDREN, or for sensitive types.

Like Guillermo says, ""watch the film, and get lost in it"".",1179360000,9,1686,4.9361702127659575

That being said I feel this movie was a letdown. The movie's most riveting moments came when events took place in the ""real world"" (Spain during the 1940s). I expected a stronger focus on the underworld setting in the movie.

Now the film did have some very good performance from the actors. Even though I was reading English subtitles the diction and dialog in Spanish was excellent. The special effects are also fantastic and may be the strongest asset of the movie. Some of the creatures are a sight to see and the environment throughout the movie is eerily real.

7626342,4,B002BYYA9A,"""This movie almost destroyed me, almost killed me,"" the director Guillermo del Toro says in a video introduction to his dark fairy tale ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (El Laberinto del fauno). ""I hope you enjoy it and get lost in it."" Viewers have little choice -- the brutality of the Spanish Civil War jackbooters and the Jungian terrors of olde fairy tale monsters conspire to give ""Labyrinth"" a fierce primal pull.

New Line's DVD looks and sounds outstanding, as you'd expect. Audio options include ES and EX (New Line is one of the few remaining DVD makers to pony up for these high-end audio formats.) Del Toro does his usual thoughtful and detailed work in the commentary. The director also anchors a featurette in which he expounds on his theories about monsters, the power in the number 3 and how Hollywood ruined every fairy tale it touched.

Another solid extra features Doug Jones -- the skinny actor costumed up to become the Faun and the Pale Man -- as he goes about his rubbery routines. Then there's an interactive look inside del Toro's sketch books for the project, dating back a decade -- fascinating to see how much of this came straight from the Mexican director's imagination.

The set designs are ingenious and supremely creative, the photography is lush and gorgeous to behold, and the makeup is simply genius.  This is a tale of a little girl who attempts to escape the horrors of the real world exploding around her during wartime.  She enters into a realm that at first seems benign and safe until her subconscious fears rise to the surface and her fantasies overlap her reality until she is unable to distinguish between the two.  ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a genuine masterpiece of adult fantasy.  There is a lot of gore in this film, so parents should beware.  While viewing this film in the theater there were plenty of moments that had the audience gasping and wincing at how much pain the characters must be enduring.  For parents who remain unconvinced I have only one thing to say, ""bone-saw"".  Cringe.  But far beyond the gory makeup, the creature effects are marvelous and completely wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that a minimum of computer effects are used in this film and the creatures are actually there moving, blinking, scheming.  The computer effects that are incorporated are blended seemlessly and add polish to the overall imagination of the film.  ""Pan's Labyrinth"" slides easily into my top ten list of foreign films where it now holds company with greats like Akira Kurosawa's ""Ran"" and Zhang Yimou's ""To Live"".

7626346,4,B002BYYA9A,"This was definitely a very good movie; it's good to see that films can still be made where every single aspect does not have to be explained.  The fact that directors do that now can be very annoying and cut into the movie.  Since when did anything in a fairy tale make sense?  A detailed explanation of the ending would have killed it.  It boils down to the director wanting to make a fairy tale, so he stuck to his guns and made one.  No explanation required; you either like it or you don't.

Despite other reviews about the brutality and gruesomeness of this movie, I still think it's a good children's story.  Go to a library or a grandparent's house and find an old book that has children's fairy tales in it.  Most of them are disturbing, and it is very rare that someone doesn't die or get badly injured in some way; the only difference is that books don't have ratings.

My only disappointment with this movie is that it was all in Spanish.  It's fine for me, but since the fairy tale style is more for children, (like it should be) any kid watching this movie might have problems keeping up with the quick paced subtitles.",1179273600,2,1132,4.373205741626794

Sometimes, it's hard to tell which is more terrifying, the ""reality"" portion of this film or the ""fantasy"" part. This is truly a great, dark fairy tale that deserves to be watched again and again.

The only thing I don't understand is why the title was changed when it was translated into English. This movie has nothing to do with Pan. The literal translation of the original Spanish title is ""Labyrinth of the Faun."" Since the faun's name is not Pan, I don't understand why the change was needed. But, it really doesn't matter.

7626348,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is a film about the role choice and blind obedience has in shaping the destinies of the individual as well as society. The film consists of two tales that are skillfully interwoven with the same twelve year old girl, Ofelia, at the center of each. One is a tale of life and rebellion in 1944 Spain under the Franco regime, the other tale involves a magical world in which the faun, Pan, oversees three tests that will allow Ofelia to claim her rightful place as princess in that magical world. At the beginning of the film both tales have little in common with one another other than the girl being at the center of each. However, as the film progresses, the magical world crosses over more and more into the real world. For example, the key, the dagger, and the monsters encountered in the magical world have definite analogs in the earthly realm.

There is much that is left open for interpretation in this film. For example, until the end you are not sure if Pan is even telling the girl the truth. Is he actually leading her to a higher destiny, or does he just need someone to perform the three tasks in order to get something for himself? Why does Pan get younger and younger as the film progresses? Since Ofelia has a love of magical stories and nobody else actually sees any of the magical occurrences, are they real or just ways for the girl to escape her increasingly sad situation and environment? Most of the characters in the ""real world"" part of the film, however, are completely unambiguous. Ofelia's stepfather, Captain Vidal, is the most shining example. From the beginning he plays a man devoted to detail, to the extinction of the rebels, and to his own legacy. He seems to have no human feelings and is as made of stone as the labyrinth that inhabits his property. This is made clear early in the film by a violent scene in which two villagers that claim to be hunting rabbits are killed by Vidal as suspected rebels. When he later finds a rabbit in the mens' belongings that seems to confirm their story, his only reaction is that of irritation at his men for not more thoroughly searching the villagers before bothering him with the matter.

If you enjoy tales of magic and fantasy in which everything is not sewed up into a tidy happy ending, and you appreciate how the visual aspect of film can contribute to the mood of various scenes, I strongly advise you check this movie out. It is far more original and interesting than anything I saw Hollywood come up with last year.",1179273600,3,2514,4.535242290748899

This was the most powerful film and indeed, the most powerful artistic experience I have ever had. I have never been so affected by a piece of art or film.

7626363,4,B002BYYA9A,"I should begin by stating very clearly that this film is absolutely *not* suitable for kids. It is dark, gruesome, and facinatingly grotesque in it's own artful way, and it is meant to be a fairy tale for adults.

Having said that, this film is wonderful in it's beautiful imagery, and breathtaking special effects. It is a foreign film, and is therefore subtitled, but as long as watching a subtitled movie doesn't bother you, then you definitely shouldn't miss this spectacular exercise in the flowing combination of pain and beauty.

The story is set in Spain in 1944. A young girl and her mother are sent to live with her cruel and sadistic step-father. She soon discovers that she can escape into a bizarre fantasy world when she touches the pages of a blank book. There she is told that she is a princess, and that she must overcome 3 horrifying obstacles in order to prove her royal lineage, and meet her real father, the King.

As most movies do, this film tends to drag occassionally, but even so you will be riveted by the rich imagery the film portrays. Although the movie is often disturbing and gruesome, it also has moments of sheer beauty and grace. The viewer is sometimes left with a sense of confusion, because after a while Ofelia's real and imaginary worlds begin to blend together, creating a very uncertain feeling as to what is real and what is not. In the end, it is sort of left to the viewer to decide for themselves what they believe the truth of the matter is. Was this incredible fantasy world all inside Ofelia's head as a way of escaping the horrors going on around her in real life, or was she truly able to physically escape into this other realm? You be the judge.

Director Guillermo del Toro did a wonderful job in bringing this film to life. While the movie is all in Spanish, Del Toro translated the subtitles to English himself, as he did not trust other translators to do it properly due to a few bad experiences with some of his previous films.

Despite the movie being titled ""Pan's Labyrinth"", which to me immediately sparks the imagination, do not expect this film to even remotely resemble much tamer movies that the title invokes, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Pan-2-Disc-Platinum-Edition/dp/B000JBWWRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition)</a>&nbsp;or even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Labyrinth/dp/B00000K3D4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Labyrinth</a>.

But Pan's Labyrinth is a true classic original in all ways. Not for the tender-hearted children under the age of 13. Both beautiful, surreal and imaginative, as well as horrific and edgy in its stylistic approach, Deltoro's Pan's Labyrinth is a truly one-of-a-kind movie experience.

The is not suitable for children for a few scenes of torture and violence. While difficult to watch, it serves to create a sense of real peril, ugliness, cruelty and evil that propels our protagonist to seek comfort in another world of grotesque beauty. She is a young girl in the midst of a brutal civil war where both sides reside under her roof, and the only reason she is safe is because her mother is pregnant by a fascist general. There is a sense that this safety is precarious and could evaporate quickly due to circumstances beyond her control.

The protagonists other world is sparked by a discovery of an old labyrinth by the old house where the general holds his position and has a doctor see to the pregnant mother's ailing health.

This other world that is created is amazingly done and is beautiful in its grotesquely Gothic way. The original score is perfect for the film with its haunting humming lullaby. The young girl is perfect young heroine that is flawed but lovable. You want her to fulfill her destiny and escape to her throne in a magical place. The rest of the cast are amazing showing the full range of humanity in a time of war from immense cruelty to amazing courage and compassion. The film itself has a great sense of pacing, almost poetic writing, and is able to keep up the feeling of suspense.

The movie is sad, beautiful, cruel, agonizing, and has kept haunting me. The film made me cry and at times took my breath away. It made me feel great to see such a well-made movie in the era of over hyped corporate films. This had the craftsmanship of an expert watchmaker.

7626377,3,B002BYYA9A,"There are 2 films within this movie :

1. Reality through a young girls' eyes - Set in war-torn Europe, the young girl from a dysfunctional family is distracted by an alternative universe of magical beings, where she is told she is a princess of an Underworld Kingdom, and has to perform certain tasks to attain the title. These `magical tasks' (which are the centerpiece of the movie) are by far the most visually arresting I've seen in a while - it reminded me a lot of Tarsem's ""The Cell"" (the underrated masterpiece starring Jennifer Lopez) both visually and metaphorically.

2. Reality as it is - The film also parallelly follows the reality of the girls' family and how the world views her - which means there is nothing magical going on, just a lot of violence and sadness, as to be expected from the dreariness of the era. Throw in an abusive father, a spineless mother, and inhospitable living conditions, and you can imagine why the girl is so desperate to block this reality out.

The interesting thing is, the viewer is not told which reality is true. In the end, when realities converge, it is left very vague as to whose world is real. On one hand, it is suggested that the girls' elaborate fantasy (and in fact the entire film, thereby) is just an illusion. On the other hand, it is suggested that all the story was is one girls' attempt to escape the harshness of the world by creating an imaginary world that only she could see and understand. I prefer to think it's the former, but either way, this is a beautiful film that makes you think. The cinematography is brilliant, and the special effects are truly exemplary.

However, even though I do adore this film, I can see why some people would find it pretentious and meaningless. I mean, those are cruel words for a film of this beauty, but the end of the film can leave you very cold and un-moved, even if you did enjoy everything that came before it. I saw this with someone who felt the same way but was left down by the end, which was more of an anti-climax, in the worst sort of way.

The highlight of the film is definitely the young actress. She is not very talented as an `actress' per se, and if you know a little about film-making you can see that the performance she gave is definitely because of the efforts of her director to make her `look better' as an actress.

That said, this is a glorious film that you should watch with someone who appreciates foreign film as much as you do. It is by no means a perfect movie, but as films of 2006 go, this was pretty much the cream of the crop.",1177891200,6,2569,4.3978947368421055

In as few words as possible, it's about a young girl creating her own fantasyworld to escape her extremely harsh reality.

People who would compare this to, for instance, The Lord of the Rings (a movie with no line between fantasy and reality), haven't really looked underneath the surface of this film. Because everything that ""really happens"" here is completely straight forward and realistic. I have never seen a more intelligently made movie. As if this wasn't enough, it has the most beautiful soundtrack I have ever heard. Sometimes it really hurts to watch this film, but in the only way that you'll probably want more of it.

It's simply way too bloody to be a children's movie, and too childish to be a good adult's movie.

There's really only one good scene, the one with the eyeless guy, but even that, I imagine, would be pretty traumatic for a child to watch.

Don't sit down to watch this thinking it's some sort of magical children's movie: you'll be sorry.

A guaranteed retort to this review is:  ""Who told you it's a kid's movie?  They never said it's a kid's movie!""

Fine.  So let's evaluate this as an adult's movie:

1.  Pointlessly overviolent.  Really the violence is so graphic that whatever other message the director would like to convey gets lost in the shock.
2.  The two plots cohere only superficially.
3.  The mythical elements seem random, as if somebody had just read a copy of Joseph Campbell and decided to toss a whole bunch of random ideas into the soup.  What was the point of the eyeless guy and eating the grapes, for example?

Lemme guess:  you're thinking, ""You're being too literal!  Why can't you enjoy the childish wonder and mystery of it?""

7626381,5,B002BYYA9A,"As I write this review, I am listening to the Pan's Labyrinth OST for the sixth time on the film's official website[...]. Without question in my mind, Pan's Labyrinth definitely has the best soundtrack of 2006, perhaps even 2007, though as of this review the year is not yet ended.

Like most movies, I read many reviews of Pan's Labyrinth before deciding to see it. As a long-time admirer of Roger Ebert's reviews, I took his praise of the film seriously and decided to dole out seven bucks. I missed the opening shot. Perhaps it was best that way, since it would have probably influenced my perception of the rest of the movie.

Pan's Labyrinth was advertised as a fairy tale for adults and the trailers were predominantly concerned with the handful of fanciful creatures and little Ofelia. Coincidentally, a few months later, another movie used the same advertising ploy to draw in viewers. Many complained that the trailers for Bridge To Terabithia made it out to be another Narnia and thus misleading, even though they could have saved themselves the trouble by simply reading a synopsis of the novel the movie was based on. The parallels between Pan's Labyrinth and Terabithia struck me as sign that American cinema was veering towards a precipice over which it would plummet into the abyss of Roald Dahlian theatrics. Not surprisingly, criticisms for Pan's Labyrinth and Terabithia were very similar -- the ads were misleading, there was not enough fantasy and too much reality. Again, they should have simply done some reading before going to the movie. The old addage isn't always true, ignorance isn't always bliss.

Much of the criticism surrounding Pan's Labyrinth is directed towards the violence and adverse ratio of fantasy to war, as well as use of subtitles (Americans hate reading, it seems). Both complaints show a widespread lack of understanding about some of the film's fine points and overall ignorance. With regard to the violence, Pan's Labyrinth is indeed a violent, gory movie. Seeing as how it's set during wartime, specifically WWII, it is really no different than other wartime films such as Glory or the History Channel mini-series Band Of Brothers. War is grisly and Guillermo del Toro doesn't pussyfoot away from that fact. He includes scenes of gore which, aside from that of Captain Vidal stitching his mouth back together - a sign of Vidal's stout resilience and possibly even an allusion to the Joker's smile - could hardly be considered excessive. Nobody loses a head or limb; guts don't spill out all over the ground; nails don't protrude out of eye sockets -- the level of gore in Pan's Labyrinth is hardly worth criticizing.

Captain Vidal, the main antagonist, is what many would consider truly evil. Some argue his character is unrealistically evil, that he's too sadistic. It seems people are won't to forget Newton's rule of thumb -- for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Throughout the film, action and reaction drive the military and rebels. Action, reaction. Push, pull. One thing leads to another. Captain Vidal commands a military outpost resisting Republican rebels. His father died in Morocco and the death greatly affected Vidal. He takes his frustration out on the rebels. As a military man, he knows there is a possibility he might be killed, so he yearns for an heir. Enter his wife Carmen, pregnant with Vidal's son, or so he likes to believe. The camp's physician warns against presuming the child's gender, compounding Vidal's stress. Action, reaction. Push, pull. Carmen brings her daughter Ofelia. Had she been a boy instead, perhaps Vidal would have accepted her. Or perhaps not. Action, reaction. Enter the faeries.

The beauty of this film is del Toro's weaving of reality and fantasy. As I said, I missed the first minute of the movie and as such may not have put it in the correct perspective. The first faerie appears separate from Ofelia as a mantis which follows her to the camp. One night it visits her in bed where she asks, ""Did you follow me here? Are you a fairy?"" at which point she shows the mantis a picture of a fairy and it turns into one, albeit with an insectoid head. Del Toro claims this was intended to distinguish his faeries from the classic beautified representations. Indeed, nothing in the fantasy realm is beautiful to the viewer, but rather grotesque and at times fearsome. Everything in the supernatural realm mirrors the world in which Ofelia lives. There is nothing wholly beautiful. Even the beauty of child-bearing is marred by pain and blood, as Carmen suffers numerous maladies as she struggles to carry Vidal's heir to term.

The supernatural never appear in the same scene as any other character except Ofelia, excluding the faerie's nocturnal visit while Carmen was fast asleep. Aware of this, it's easy for the viewer to perceive everything as being in Ofelia's head, but the two worlds collide when Ofelia puts a mandrake root under her ailing mother's bed and Carmen gradually recovers, much to everyone's amazement. But Vidal, ever distrustful of Ofelia, mistakes her actions as an attempt on the unborn heir's life. Carmen defends her daughter and after Vidal leaves the room admonishes her for believing in such superstitions. She then tosses the mandrake root into the fireplace, at which point she immediately goes into labor and soon after dies during childbirth. Without Carmen to protect Ofelia, Vidal links the young girl with a treacherous maid and has Ofelia imprisoned in her room. At wit's end, Ofelia cries out for help and is visited once more by the ambiguous faun.

It is at this point which the recurring assumption that Pan's Labyrinth is about escapism becomes fundamentally incorrect. In review after review, the fantasy realm is just that -- fantasy. It's all in Ofelia's head as a means for her to escape the harsh realities of the embattled world around her. In actuality, Ofelia not only brings the real world into the ""fantasy realm,"" but she brings fantasy into the real. The labyrinth itself is real. The faeries are insectoid. The toad was inspired by Vidal's umbrella. The terrifying Pale Man was an amalgram of metaphors. And her home kingdom... To mention anything about that would be a spoiler. But after she has been locked in her room, the faun visits Ofelia and gives her a quest: ""Fetch your brother and bring him to the labyrinth as quickly as possible."" At this point fantasy and reality collide head-on. Ofelia escapes from her prison through supernatural means and kidnaps her brother, thus involving Captain Vidal in the mythical quest.

Escapism -- the desire to retreat into imaginative entertainment to escape the harshness of reality. Escapism is sitting in front of a television eight hours a day instead of going out partying. Escapism is chatting or writing lengthy reviews on Amazon instead of hanging out with friends. Escapism is definitely not what Pan's Labyrinth is about. For Ofelia, reality and fantasy are one and the same.

And when all is said and done and the credits roll, you may find yourself questioning your own beliefs. What is real? What is fantasy? And just who really had the most fanciful thoughts? Ofelia with her fairy kingdom? The rebels with their fight for freedom from national oppression? Or Captain Vidal with his unwaivering desire for a son to follow in his footsteps?",1177459200,53,7373,4.929951690821256

The Oscar buzz is all over the new film ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and we were there to find out the hype. It is basically a dark fantasy tale--a la ""Never Ending Story""--where director Guillermo Del Toro combines two things; a fairy tale daydream of a preteen girl and the crude reality of the world she lived in. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is an interesting, creepy and dramatic film that shows us why many children want to escape their sad realities by creating new ones of their own.

Story:

""Pan's Labyrinth"" takes place in Northern Spain after the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1944. Things are not going well for the 12-year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) whose father died. She has to move in along with her ill pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to a new home in the countryside--she brings her fairy tales books with her. Carmen is pregnant from her new husband, the brutal Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lpez) who waits for them. He was sent to that remote area to destroy the remaining militia group who hides in the mountains and wants to take control of the village. The Capitan also wants Carmen to give birth where he is. The day of their trip, Ofelia discovers a hidden magical world. She encounters a goat-like faun who tells her that she is a princess, but in order to regain her kingdom, she must complete three tasks. She accepts and the adventure begins.

Review:

""Pan's labyrinth"" was written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro ('Blade II', 'Hellboy') who combined civil war, political instability and a fantastic fairy tale world. In her adventure, Ofelia is the princess, the one that matters and savior of her future brother and dying mother from the dangerous ""adult world"" they're stuck in. Is this a pipe dream? Unfortunately nobody sees this magical world but her. This situation keeps us guessing about what she is really seeing. Back in the real world, Del Toro doesn't waste any time of letting us know who the bad guys are. He show us extreme moments of how Capital Vidal--along with his soldiers--kills the ""enemies"" of Spain, which is very tough to look at. This creates realism and sensitivity for the audience who see the atrocities committed during the Spanish Civil War.

The fairy tale world she sees is full of strange, creepy and symbolic oddities. We see creatures--some look extremely hideous in a cool way--that she has to face in order to make all her problems go away. We like the way the story jumps from fantasy to reality without compromising the rhythm of the movie. In other words, the editing is excellent and it doesn't drag, all these elements displayed with eye candy cinematography.

The movie is well acted; especially Sergi Lpez who is probably the best actor in this film. He gives us an excellent performance as the ruthless, mean and arrogant Capitan Vidal--we love to hate this character.

The Verdict:

Although the ending is unsatisfying and open to interpretation, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a respectable movie that tells the fantasy of a child who didn't want to grow up and wanted to be a fairy tale princess forever. All mixed with political themes and war. We recommend this film and we won't be surprised if this movie shows up at the Oscars. The movie is in Spanish with English subtitles and not recommended for small children.",1176681600,10,3285,4.759226713532513

7626390,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth is one of those films that starts so well that you hope it will stay that good but which actually surprises you and constantly improves. It's a remarkably layered work about the importance of choice even in an emotional and political dictatorship and about the fictions and fantasies that sustain people through the worst circumstances. On the surface this appears to be little more than a more fantastic spin on The Spirit of the Beehive, sharing its post-Spanish Civil War setting as well as the broken family setting, but this is a far superior film in every way. Although marketed largely as a fantasy, its real power lies in the scenes set in the real world where Sergi Lopez's all too believable Fascist monster is mopping up the few remaining communist guerrillas in the hills while waiting for his sick wife to give birth to his son while her daughter from her first marriage tries to reassert her own identity rather than submit to the Captain's idea of family.

The challenges of the mythical world are far less disturbing - or violent - than the real one, and it's all too easy to see why she wants to escape into the darkness of the labyrinth where at least the hope of something better exists. But then she's not the only one escaping into the imagination, as her mother sustains herself with a romanticised view of her meeting the captain that he has no interest in whatsoever. To him stories - even a part of his family history that has passed into local legend - exist only to be denied. Lopez's greatest sin isn't the pride that he admits to, or even that he is so pitiless, it's that he chooses to obey without question: the girl's small triumph is that she does not. And the triumphs in the film are generally small, quiet ones, where courage and fear go hand in hand, making the few acts of decency all the more important when they occur. There is one ""saved by the cavalry"" moment that at first doesn't convince but does prove to be there for a definite purpose that makes the ending all the more powerful.

But while there's a lot going on underneath the surface of the film, it doesn't crush it with the weight of its ideas. It's directed with a visual assurance and, at times, playfulness that sweeps you along, sometimes with delight, sometimes with apprehension, but never simply for the sake of a nice shot or a neat special effect (most of which are incredibly well integrated for such a low budget feature). The performances are superb, with Lopez somehow managing to avoid turning his irredeemable character into a caricature: this is an evil without conscience that is all too recognisable. Javier Navarette's beautiful score is also adept at walking the fine line between magic and emotion without crossing the line into schmaltz.

It's a remarkable film, the only new one that I saw last year that I'd genuinely say is one of the greatest of all time. Practically perfect and definitely one to add to your collection.",1176422400,9,2966,4.656488549618321

7626392,5,B002BYYA9A,"""Pan's Labyrinth"" is the story of a little girl in the middle of the Spanish civil war, whose mother has recently married a military officer whose brutal nature is soon to be revealed to mother and daughter when they movie into the military garrison the officer commands.  As the war between the garrison and the hill-based rebels rages, little Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is free during the calm periods to explore the dark woods, where she discovers a mysterious labyrinth....

  The first thing that needs to be said is that the movie isn't as open-and-closed as its advertising makes it seem.  In the ads it talks about a little girl escaping into a world of her own imagination, to escape a brutal reality.  In my mind, it's not a given that what happens in the labyrinth and during other strange events, is just Ofelia's imagination.  Not to give anything away regarding the ending, but throughout ""Pan's Labyrinth"" you can find plenty of clues that would lead to either outcome - that it's an imagined world, or that it's really happening.  As for the events whose reality is in question, Ofelia discovers a Faun inside the labyrinth who tells her that she's really the daughter of the moon, and requests her assistance in certain tasks.  Accompanied by strange, insectoid-fairies, Ofelia returns to the more familiar human world, although at times she wonders if the Faun has revealed the full truth....

  In that human world, the officer, Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez), rules the garrison, its soldiers, its staff of servants, the nearby village, and his own family (including his new child by Ofelia's mother) with an iron fist, and is absolutely ruthless in his pursuit of the rebels.  Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, the man behind ""The Devil's Backbone"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"" walks a lot of thematically similar territory to ""Backbone"" - innocents caught in a vicious world not of their own making, the desperation of the powerless against the powerful, and the strong connection of a child with a kind of otherworld.  The themes tie together intricately, and one of the tag lines to the movie - 'Innocence Has A Power Evil Can't Imagine' - gives a tantalizing hint to what may be going on inside some of the movie's mysteries.

  On the techinal side, the movie is perfect - outstanding acting, special effects that are alternately beautiful and horrifying (including one of the most terrifying monsters in movie history), a great musical score, perfect suspense.  This is a must for fans of edgy fantasy, horror, and even war movies and intense dramas.  A++",1176076800,8,2575,4.905311778290993
7626393,5,B002BYYA9A,"This movie is hands down one of the best movies I've ever seen.  So original, sort of bizare, subtitled and very violent.  Dark and brooding and kinda Clive Barker-flavored around the fantastic edges.  Guillermo Del Toro is divine in his touch of reality versus fantasy, blending the two together masterfully.  Truly astounding storyline.  Moving  & visually stunning.  Graphic & scary.  This is one of those movies where you go into the theater thinking it's about one thing and it winds up suprising you totally.  Definitely not for the kiddies although I would show i to my 16-year old daughter.  I think she'll get a kick out of it.  Great moviemaking!  Even though the entire movie is spoken in Spanish, that never detracted once and that says everything, for the connoisseur might enjoy subtitles, the general public tends to start squirming in their seats at a movie you have to read all of the dialogue at.  Mesmerizing!

In a fairy tale, Princess Moanna, whose father is king of the underworld, visits the human above, where she is blinded by the sunlight and left with amnesia, forgetting where she came from and who she is.  The bulk of the story takes place after the Spanish Civil War  in May-June of 1944, during the early Francoist period.  Young Ofelia is traveling with her fragile pregnant mother to meet her stepfather, Captain Vidal who is the stern son of a famed commander who died in Morocco and a die-hard believer in falangism (widely associated with fascism).  Captain Vidal has been assigned to hunt down the republican rebels inhabiting the forested areas surrounding the villa in which he has set up command.  During a stop to tend to her sick and pregnant mother, Ofelia follows a stick bug to the outskirts of an ancient labyrinth, but is stopped by Mercedes, Vidal's housekeeper, before she has a chance to enter.  Later that night in her bedroom, Ofelia is visited by the stick bug, who turns into a fairy and leads her back to the labyrinth and the faun creature residing there.  The faun is sure that she is none other than Princess Moanna and sets about giving her three tasks to complete before the full moon so that she may remember and return to her kingdom and immortality.  Ofelia takes on the tasks without question, intrigued.  First she must climb inside the heart of a dying tree and retrieve a key that has been swallowed by a giant toad.  She succeeds in capturing the key as well as destroying the beautiful dress he mother had made for her to attend a dinner party.  Her mother is growing increasingly sick as she carries the child of the cruel and murderous Vidal (he smashes in  the face of a teenaged peasant with a wine bottle, then shoots the boy's elderly father before leaning that the two have been wrongfully apprehended). The faun gives her a mandrake root to place under her mother bed to ease her sickness, and, for a while it works, until Vidal finds it and destroys it.  Meanwhile, onto task number two...

The sheer genius of Pan's Labyrinth is that is blends the vicious, war-time drama of Captain Vidal and his desire to eradicate the rebels and the dark fantasy of the Labyrinth itself.  This movie will make you flinch in several places, from the scenes of sadistic torture, to the other-worldly banquets set for disturbing creatures with their eyes in their hands.  I was enraptured from beginning to end and I gotta say that most movies do no achieve such submergence.  Spanish and all it is a truly visionary, suspenseful, unflinching work of artistic storytelling.  I will watch it over and over again.  I even shared it with my teenage daughters and they both loved it.  I would shoot for the Blu-Ray of course, for that pristine picture, but in any format. Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece of filmmaking!

7626395,5,B002BYYA9A,"Pan's Labyrinth had something movies are missing these days; insight, and creativity. It is a harsh and terrible story, but beautifully done, and it really makes its point. I loved the way the reality and the imaginary started out so separate - but by the end, they led into each other, and there really was no border at all. It made me cringe in fear and cry, both of which I have never in my recollection done (beyond that one scene in the Village, when the man behind me coughed during the flee scene).

In terms of general violence, this movie is perfectly suitable for mature children, but it really isn't. It's not even truly suitable for less mature teenagers. The way the violence occurs isn't the typical fare of the day; good guys whacking bad guys who fall without sound and are just gone, and the good guys come out unscathed, and every one loves the good guys and hates the bad guys and whoever heard of betrayal? In here, there are no distinctions. The bad guy has a story of his own that makes you sympathize with him anyway. Obviously good guys are killed because they annoyed the bad, and there is no honor or beauty in their death, they're just dead. And finally, children die. In wishy-washy Disney movies, if anyone dies, it's a bad guy (so who cares), or it's the parents (whom we didn't know, but still creates pity and sadness for the main character). The kid does not die.

This movie is wonderful, and should become a classic.",1175731200,6,1451,4.492424242424242

I actually hated how they ended the movie and disliked how I suffered through the whole thing WHILE paying to watch it.

A small group of republican fighters, though, hold on to a small territory in the remote forested mountains of northern Spain. There, a girl named Ofelia, fascinated with fairy tales, arrives with her sick mother to meet her stepfather, a brutal captain of the regime keen on exterminating the remnant republicans. Living with the military in an old mill, at night Ofelia meets a fairy who takes her to an old Faun, which urges her to complete three treacherous tasks. The movie, thus, occurs both in ""reality"" and in fantasy. I like Del Toro's previous Hellboy. Pan's Labyrynth is also a great movie, but I think it was just a bit overrated. The movie is well made, the atmosphere and special effects are great, the plot holds your attention, the performances are great. So why I'm a bit hesitant to endorse this movie as a masterpiece? I'm not totally sure, but the movie may be too ""arty"" for its own good, the film is just a bit too neat, straining for significance while trying to attract both terror film fans and art movie buffs, while probably pleasing neither completely.

Then there's a small booklet with short abstract and sketches to the film. Beautiful!

7626399,3,B002BYYA9A,"Unlike many people here, I knew this would be an adult fantasy movie. I was not expecting LOTR or Harry Potter here, I know there were more dramatic elements involved. But still, this movie did astound me on various levels. Is it a good movie? Absolutely. Is it great, Oscar-worthy material? I certainly don't think so.

Ophelia travels to the countryside of somewhere in Spain with her mother, to join her stepfather, a foul man called Captain Vidal. Her mother is pregnant with Vidal's son, so naturally Vidal is very protective of the mother, or more aptly his baby son. There are some rebel militants in the countryside that threatens Vidal's military power. So, every so often we are treated to some gory albeit graphic scenes showcasing Vidal's evil/narcissistic behavior. Ophelia, a great fan of fantasy novels starts dreaming, meeting a faun (whose name is unknown but we assume it's Pan), he then tells her that she is the Princess reborn of the Underground Realm. To rightfully claim the title, she needs to complete 3 tasks. Upon completion, she will join the King and Queen, and live happily ever after. She enthusiastically accepts the challenges and her journey begins. Is it a dream, or is it real? I mean, this is after all a movie from the director of Hellboy, so nothing is far-fetched.

To be honest, I was really absorbed in the story. No doubt, it's a very sad movie. The uniqueness of the movie is that it is told from the eyes of a little girl. Everything that happens, more or less revolves around her and her ideas or perception. This girl is living in a terrible place, she fears her stepfather, her mother is ill carrying her baby brother and she has no friends. She conjures this fantasy world to get away from all these. Her fantasy co-exists with reality. We, the audience at times never know where the fantasy ends and where reality begins. The storytelling is superb in that sense. Other than that, the cinematography is exceptionally good. There are traces of what we saw in Hellboy, but it seems more polished now. The acting is decent, but I was especially impressed with Ivana Baquero, who played Ophelia really well. Definitely a young actress to watch out for in the future. Another thing I loved about the movie was its haunting score, from Javier Navarrete. It really set the dark and bleak tone for the movie.

As you can see, there are many things to like about the movie, but why I feel it is over-rated is because, it is not groundbreaking. The evil stepfather, the kind-hearted but ill-fated mother, the abused child are all quite clich&eacute;. Done quite well here, but still has a sense of repetition when watching the movie. Furthermore, the idea of escaping the harsh reality of war has been done before. Just watch Life Is Beautiful, where the father goes through so much to convince the young son that everything is just peachy although they are held prisoners in a freakin' military camp. Even Harry Potter toys with this idea, Harry is living in what seems like Hell with his Uncle and Aunty, until he found out he was a powerful wizard. I am sure there are many more examples.

Also, there are some minor plot holes that didn't sit well with me. Unlike some people here, the graphic scenes did not disturb me but something I was eager to know, is what drives Captain Vidal to act the way he does? Does someone just wake up one day, and say ""Hey, I'm gonna be an evil son of b*tch today""? Why does Ophelia just follow the faun's instructions without thinking twice about it? I mean, to be honest that dude who looks like a rejected character from Hellboy, doesn't exactly seem like the most trustworthy guy around. Has Ophelia seen the Underground Realm? I really think if the faun had offered Ophelia a glimpse of this mysterious realm, of how beautiful it is, that would make more sense. She would seem like she wants something better than what she is currently experiencing. Unfortunately, without knowing anything about the realm and the kingdom, she jumps at every command. Being the smart, grounded girl she is portrayed to be, I found this to be a little weird. The story was also not as emotionally charged as I hoped for, and this plays a big part in pushing a movie from good to great. Yes, there is a very heavy sorrow/sadness throughout the movie but it lacks moments of emotional brilliance that some classic movies have, where usually at a singular, pivotal point, it provokes certain feelings from audiences.

I know those are minor gripes, which I usually don't even highlight when I am reviewing movies. But I just felt I had to mention those things because I really believe this movie is over hyped. It is good, especially for a foreign movie with a team of Mexican/Spanish people behind it, but to say that this is THE best movie of 2006, that it should win a Best Picture Oscar is something I strongly disagree. Buy this DVD for its storytelling and cinematography; I just hope you don't go in expecting one of the best movies of all time.",1174953600,5,5013,4.647125140924464
7626400,4,B002BYYA9A,"This is definitely a movie to watch, no doubt about that. The sinister and twisted fantasy world of Guillermo del Toro and a good performance from the cast makes this a movie to remember.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" is very dark, with the setting of the old mill in a big, dark forest and the mood being set very effectively with creative lighting and a haunting score. Also the villains of the movie add to the darkness of the film, the captain being nothing less than evil incarnate, displaying cruelty and absolutely no feelings. The film is very violent and bloody, a fairytale for adults indeed.

The story resembles that of basically any fairytale of the brothers Grimm or HC Andersen, containing the number 3, tests/quests, fairies, toads, and evil as well as good. The fantastical parts of the story are finely interlaced with the action of the real world and the two ultimately blends together seamlessly. Whether or not the whole story has been nothing but the imaginations of the little girl Ophelia or it is real is up to the viewer to decide.

I would have liked a bit more exploring into the background of the captain though. I think the character of the captain is a bit two-dimensional. You only get that he's cruel and concerned about his legacy.

I also think that there is one instance where Ophelias actions are irrational and out of character (see [SPOILER]below).

Other than that, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is top notch. Highly recommendable.

[SPOILER] When Opehlia is told not to eat anything when she goes to pick up the dagger in the underground hall she eats the grapes anyway. I really feel this was put in only to show off that eyes-in-hands-creature. It really seems unnecessary and irrational to me.",1174780800,6,1714,4.773648648648648

Unlike last year's uber-movies (The Departed, Dreamgirls) or sweet-n-sappy-love-fests (Little Miss Sunshine), Pan's Labyrinth is a mystical tour-de-force that combines pure escapism with raw emotional intensity to create an indelible story of loss and redemption.  Ivana Baquero deserved an Academy Award nomination for her amazing and inspired performance, and the film certainly deserved the Oscar as Foreign Language Film - it was do good, I dare say even Scorcese should have lost the award to the non-nominee Del Toro, and it stands heads and shoulders above ""The Departed"" as a pure movie experience you will never forget.

7626403,5,B002BYYA9A,"This was just an incredible movie.  It was hard for me to imagine that the same Guillermo del Toro who directed ""Hellboy"" was the same guy who made this movie.  Not since the late 80's when I watched Jim Henson's ""Dark Crystal"" have I ever been so horrified, moved and engrossed by what some would classify as a fantasy movie.  Called  a ""grown-up's fairy tale,""  Pan's Labyrinth is definitely not for the faint of heart, but for those who are willing to take the journey it is definitely worth it.

The story is set in the 1930's, during the Spanish Civil War.  Ofelia is a young girl who moves with her pregnant mother to a rural military outpost to be with her new stepfather, the ruthless Captain Vidal.  The captain is in charge of taking on resistance fighters in the mountains nearby.

Beside the outpost is an old garden with a labyrinth, and this is where Ofelia meets the Faun.  He tells her that she could be the princess that their kingdom had lost long ago, and to prove that she was worthy of regaining her throne he gave her a magical book outlining 3 tasks she must complete before the full moon arrives.

Two characters stood out for me in this movie, both of them women.  The first of course was Ofelia, played by the amazing Ivana Baquero.  The intensity in which she was able to convey Ofelia's innocence and strength literally grabbed me by the collar throughout the whole movie.  The other character was the housekeeper Mercedes played by Maribel Verdu. (I was surprised at her transformation from the seductress she had played in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"").  Mercedes was the other heroine of this story, and I could clearly see the depth of her courage strengthening with her resolve.  With the same mouth she once used to say ""I am a coward"" also came the chilling words ""you are not the first pig I've ever gutted"" as she held a knife against a tormentor, rage burning in her eyes.

The movie is completely in Spanish with subtitles, and it worked perfectly.  The fluidity of the Spanish language made me feel like I was listening to music instead of spoken words.  The score also played a great part, the movie's main theme is a sad lullaby, hummed because the words have long been forgotten.  The cinematography was also a work of art in itself, almost a gray monotone throughout the film except in the Faun's fantasy world.

There were a lot of themes in this movie:  The depth of a child's love, fearless in its simplicity.  The courageous choices that ordinary people make, even in the face of great danger or even death, to stand up for those they love and what they believe in.  The savage, cold-blooded brutality that the powerful can inflict over the weak.  The truth that our external battles can only be faced and fought when we've conquered our battles and fears from within.

As I was exiting the theater after the movie ended, I happened to glance down at a couple that was in one of the lower seats.  A man was holding his wife, who was sobbing openly (and quite audibly, I might add) in his arms.  Sheepishly I wondered if anyone would notice that my eyes were puffy too (since I had been crying myself).  It was hard to deny the strong emotions that all of us felt, even after the end credits rolled by.  For me, it was a bittersweet feeling - of  grief at the depth of Ofelia's choice, and then sharing in her triumph in spite of  her great sacrifice.",1174608000,3,3389,4.4869281045751634
7626404,5,B002BYYA9A,"I rented this on a whim, without much clue about the story.  I actually thought it was a kid's movie. It's emphatically NOT.  I watched it, sat stunned for a few moments, then immediately went to the PC and purchased a copy of my own.

In terms of genre, it's difficult to think of a movie to compare this to.  The only 'faerie' movie I can think of that's even slightly similar (because of the dark edge) would be 'Photographing Fairies'.  But this is much darker even than that.

It's a return, perhaps, to the antique days when fairy tales were SCARY and not for the kiddies.

In fact, the movie is quite harrowing at times.  I found one particular scene amost impossible to watch - something that hasn't happened to me since the days when I used to watch daleks and cybermen from behind the sofa!

But all in all, I think it's a beautiful, surprising, and thought-provoking movie, and almost certain to join 'Photographing Fairies' and 'Blade Runner' as one of my all time favourites.

Oh, and it has nothing to do with Pan, the Greek God.  Someone must have thought that this was a catchy English title, but 'The Faun's Labyrinth' might have been a better translation.

I would like to thank Guillermo Del Toro, foremost for being a truly visionary director who has kickstarted a growing mind, and rekindled the dying embers in another.

This film is in my top 10 of all time, it was original as they come, it used digital effects only because it had to, and it was the triumphant return of beautiful physical special effects (welcome back prosthetic makeup!). the lead actress, had me in tears. i honestly had not cried at the movies in such a long time, i can't remember when a film last had me in man tears (silent sniffles, jerky inhaling)

7626406,5,B002BYYA9A,"If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" (""El Laberinto del Fauno"") is a sequel of sorts to ""The Devil's Backbone,"" a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War. But this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting -- in short, a triumph.

Time and place: 1944, Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi Lpez). Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.

To do so, he tells her that she must do three things, and gives her a strange book. Ofelia menages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. Even worse, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever...

Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares. But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones for adults, that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes ""Pan's Labyrinth"" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt.

Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style and brilliant visuals. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape.

At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the ""real world"" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow. But Del Toro's biggest triumph is an ending that is beautifully bittersweet, and which turns out to hinge on Ofelia's newborn brother.

But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere ""safe."" Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond. And Lpez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.

The other half of my friends, as did I , thought that her fantasy world was real, and she was reborn as the princess.  Of course both camps of friends enjoyed the movie even though some were made sad, and others, well.....glad!

7626416,5,B002BYYA9A,"The lullaby of the piece says it all: Pan's Labyrinth (El Laberinto del Fauno) is painfully poignant. Every aspect is beautiful, from its poetic dialogue to its rich cinematography.

A tense and frightening story, Pan's Labyrinth is set after the Spanish Civil War. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is a little girl with an intuitive imagination who moves to a military outpost in the middle of the woods. Her mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) is carrying the child of Ofelia's step-father, Capitn Vidal (Sergi Lpez). There, Ofelia meets the strong servant Mercedes (Maribel Verd), who is secretly supplying rebels hiding in the forest. Ofelia is also meets more inscrutable and unusual creatures, which lead her deep into an old labyrinth. At the center, she meets a faun, a being which smells like earth and who tells her that she is a long lost princess of an underground kingdom. To reclaim her place, he assigns her three tasks.

Most of the film focuses on the ""real world"", leaving the existence of Ofelia's fantasy world up to the viewer. This reality involves an exceedingly brutal step-father, an ill mother, and the cruelty of war. The Faun's, or Pan's, world mirrors the terror Ofelia senses, though rarely sees. We, however, do see the depravity of Captain Vidal, who tortures and mercilessly murders, all in a day's work. Mercedes' courage in the face of the captain reflects Ofelia's bravery while encountering a spine-chilling monster in one task. For once, this movie monster is terrifying in its hideousness. Almost as frightening as the war itself.

Ofelia is played by the wide-eyed Baquero, who reacts sometimes minimally but always honestly. Mercedes is ridiculously likable in her quiet heroism. Vidal is so obviously a monster, especially because he views himself as a noble soldier who does his job. At one point he notes that others must think he is a monster. It is a strange thing to realize that he does not see himself as a brute. Pan himself (Doug Jones) is an ambiguous creature. To both Ofelia and the audience, he is threatening and comforting.

The creatures and sets are gorgeous and twisted creations. It is a rare fantasy/war movie that succeeds in distressing, emotionally engaging, and uplifting the viewer. Some have said that the conclusion is bleak, while others find it transcendent. This film is not perfect, and be warned that it can be difficult to take.

There was really just the Faun, his miniature fairies and that canibalistic monster. I just thought that there is not enough coverage of world of the fairies when the little's girl Ofelia/fairy princess returned to eventually.

If you're entering the theater to leave behind a violent, distressing world for a couple of hours (for the same reasons that the character Ofelia does), you will be disappointed, for the relief here from reality's horrors is brief for both the viewer and the film's young heroine.

If you're not prepared to see a bit of in-your-face violence, or seeing humans being QUITE inhumane, you should avoid this film.  I myself had some trepidation about seeing such situations.  Now I know why.

Still, viewers are given an interesting plot that had much potential, with unusual special effects, great acting, and Oscar-worthy cinematography.  What remains, however, is a nightmarish tale only for those who have lost all faith in the real world, and whose only hope of escape is deep within one's fantasies.

How unfortunate.

===========

ASIDE:  It's a shame that the Spanish title (""El Laberinto del Fauno"") was not retained or literally translated for the English release of this film, for it will be apparent to any student of classical Greek mythology that the faun here is NOT the Greek god Pan.  Pan's name is never referenced in the actual script (although the faun says he has been known by many names), and this faun does not share Pan's qualities of being lord of hill and dale, the patron god of shepherds, the inventor of the musical pipes that carry his name, the lover of both men and women, and the source of much frivolity and chaos.  It is said that when Pan was born, he was so ugly that his mom abandoned him and fled, never to be seen again -- and this faun is quite hideous.  But I've never heard of any Greek legend saying that Pan was a courtier in anyone's kingdom.  So, a faun's labyrinth it is.  But this faun is clearly NOT Pan.",1172448000,5,1813,4.604361370716511

7626425,5,B002BYYA9A,"A friend of mine recommended this film to me and I'm so glad he did.  What an amazing film!

The director Quillermo del Toro deserves all the acolades he is receiving for this beautiful piece of work.  Set in the early fourties during the facists and bloody Franco regime, the story follows a young girl named Ofelia, who along with her pregnant mother, arrives to live with her cold and sadistic step father, an army captain.  As an escape from the harsh surroundings and her mother's ill health, Ofelia begins to slip into her imagination (or is it?) to visit the labrinth of a Satyr who promises to return a kingdom in which she is a princess.  Once she has completed three tasks assigned by the satyr (and with the aid of his pets--faeries) she is told she will be returned to her royal family.

Along side the story of Ofelia, we see the rebels fighting the facists and the troubles they face against a heartless and violent government. Though it is considered a fairy tale (for adults) this is not a Disney produced ""happily-ever-after"".  Then again, life is very rarely happily-ever-after.

Beautifully filmed, with great effects and solid acting, ""Pan's Labrinth"" is a gem in a year that was pretty lack luster in the good film department.  I recommend this film and look forward to its release on dvd.",1172361600,2,1310,4.660869565217391

One of the cardinal rules of any good fairy tale is that, no matter how fantastical it becomes, it must make sure to keep one foot firmly planted in reality so that the story can more easily connect with the audience. In the case of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" however, that foot may be so firmly planted in the real world that it actually prevents the movie from cutting loose and soaring into the stratosphere of imagination and enchantment in the way we wish it would.

The movie takes place in 1944, five years after the end of the Spanish Civil War that has left Franco in power and bands of defeated Leftist rebels hiding out in the Iberian countryside. Eleven-year-old Ofelia arrives with her pregnant mother to the estate of Captain Vidal, a vicious fascist who, in a clever bit of fairy tale role reversal, plays the part of the evil stepfather of the story. As Vidal busies himself with hunting down the pesky Communist outcasts, Ofelia discovers herself drawn to a strange alternate universe, unbound by the laws of nature, which frequently opens up for her to enter and to which she alone seems privy.

There's no denying that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is an extremely well made movie, miles above the average American fantasy film in terms of both sophistication and vision. Director Guillermo del Toro has fashioned a dark, violent, exquisitely realized world filled with secret passageways and awe-inspiring creatures to which Ofelia periodically retreats in an attempt to escape the even more brutal life around her. Like Judy Garland in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the lovely Ivana Baquero is the perfect heroine for the tale: wide-eyed, curious and filled with an intense longing for a world better than the one that entraps her. The movie is a miracle of art direction, set design, makeup and special effects, and it boasts some of the most dramatic use of sound this side of ""Das Boot.""

Yet, for all its good points, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" winds up disappointing us a bit in the end. For much of its running time, the movie seems to be operating in two largely different spheres - that of reality and that of fantasy - and having a hard time bringing the two together into a unified, coherent whole. It spends too much time chronicling the conflict between the fascist general and the rebels in the forest - which might be interesting in a different context and another movie - and not enough focusing on Ofelia's otherworldly adventures. Even though the emotional pull back to Kansas was never far from Dorothy's - and the audience's - consciousness, Baum knew enough not to spend too much actual time there. Del Toro, on the other hand, seems not to be able to yank himself from the scene, the result of which is that the fantasy world never exerts the magical force on us that it might have done had it been more thoroughly developed and taken a more center stage in the drama. The magical world in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" lacks the sort of densely plotted, compelling narrative one finds in the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga or ""The Wizard of Oz."" We don't get a clear picture of what the land itself is like, who its various inhabitants are, and what Ofelia's real role will be once she gets there.

Thus, although the parts in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" are better than the whole, thanks to the quality of the film-making and of Baquero's performance, those parts are often indelible and unforgettable.",1172275200,36,3387,4.7241962774957695

The film took place in the 1940's during Franco's reign, the Spanish Civil War having ended several years before. The fascist Franco was an incredibly violent man with incredibly violent and sadistic men working in his government and, unfortunately for Ofelia, her new step-father, whom she meets for the first time in the early part of the movie, is one of those incredibly violent men. Vidal is stationed in a mountainous area in which bands of remaining insurgents are hiding out and attempting against all hope to someday overthrow Franco. Vidal's job as Captain is to root out these insurgents, or freedom fighters, and kill every last one of them. This assignment along with Vidal's character as a human being results in some very gruesome scenes, though many are virtually bloodless. The film ends on a surprising and surprisingly satisfying note, as the writer/director del Toro is able to achieve a spectacularly fitting ending for a spectacular story.

Ofelia, completely oppressed by her cruel stepfather who does not want to have anything to do with her, uprooted, living in an unfamiliar place in the middle of the woods with no other children, observes acts of extreme violence and cruelty (the area being a virtual war zone) which occur routinely and become part of everyday life, but this is a life that she wants no part of. As a result, and due to her ravenous appetite for fantasy books and old-time fairy tales, Ofelia, already troubled and possessing an overactive imagination, finds an old stone structure in the forest nearby and her subconscious begins to create (although there are those who argue otherwise) a fantasy that allows her to escape her dreadful reality and provides her with hope. This fantasy world, I believe, is strictly the imaginings of a very creative yet troubled girl who is living in a horrible world and uses all the images placed in her head from all the reading she has done to subconsciously create a place where she is important, where she has the freedom to make choices and, ultimately, to be able to live in a beautiful world with a loving family and be happy.

There have been some rumblings about the violence in this picture. It is R-rated for a reason and that reason is violence. It would not be good parenting to take a child to see Pan's Labyrinth, or most (if any) R-rated movies. This, to me anyway, is just basic common sense. Now, about the purpose and necessity of the violence...

The acts of violence that occurred in this film happened in the thousands in the general period when the story took place. But it is not like the situation in Spain under Franco and during the Spanish Civil War is anything unusual. The world can and is and has been and will always be a terribly violent place that all too often affects the lives of children, perhaps even more so than that of adults. Every violent scene in the 'real world' of Pan's Labyrinth was necessary and helped explain a character or the time period. Any violence in the 'fantasy world', del Toro says was necessary as he was attempting to write a fairy tale depicted as they have been from time immemorial. We all know that such fairy tales are exceedingly violent and designed to give the listener chills. Most must be at least somewhat familiar with these classic fairy tales and the fact that they are often gruesome and horrific beyond belief. They were told to give the young listener the chills and shudders just like what Pan's Labyrinth provided to its adult audience.

I also believe it was 100% necessary to show the Captain's facial wound because it allowed us to witness the unbelievable resolve of this individual. There have been countless men throughout history who have possessed this resolve and brutal determination that was shown with Vidal.

I simply don't believe that any viewer can offer a decent or reasonable argument that the violence was unnecessary or gratuitous. I believe that many people found the movie sad and it left them depressed because they could not handle, on an emotional level, honest realistic storytelling. Should you be afraid to show this reality? Of course not. And if you don't want to watch or read a fictional story that contains these terrible realities then don't.

As far as the look of the film, the non-cgi artistry that is exhibited in this movie is absolutely stunning. I think it is becoming a lost art in Hollywood and I fear that people like Stan Winston will be the last of the great make-up artists. This was such an exhilarating movie to watch on many levels, one of those being the visuals. I loved the contrast between the real world and the fantasy world and I found both equally captivating and exhilarating. As far as the acting ... all I can say is that it is phenomenal. I was amazed at all the performances, but Ofelia's was mind-boggling good.

We are lucky to have been given the opportunity to watch such a great, artistic, stylish, well-written, well-acted film as Pan's Labyrinth that provides such a powerful emotional impact on the viewer. There are far too few films of such profundity and overall brilliance as this and I hope those in Hollywood reflect on this after they get back on their chairs after falling upon learning that it only cost approximately 5 million to create.

Awesome entertainment, intellectually gratifying, this is the best movie I have seen in many years and one of my all-time favorite films. I cannot wait to enjoy it on several different levels again and again ... and again.",1171497600,15,5747,4.7457457457457455
7626432,5,B002BYYA9A,This is the best movie of the year! I did not go expecting much but was wonderfully surprised. I thought even the violence was done very well. I loved all the actors and the little girl did a beautiful job. I am also going to buy it as soon as possible.,1171238400,4,253,3.980392156862745
7626433,5,B002BYYA9A,"A few reviewers previous to mine have stated that this isn't as good as many have insisted that it is.  On one level I agree:  it is even better than the large host of avid reviewers have said.  One has to go all the way back to 1946 and Jean Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST to find a grown up fantasy film of such power and beauty.  To call this a masterpiece in reality is to engage in banalities.  It is more than that:  it is the touchstone for all future efforts at grown up fantasy.  I don't want to demean THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, but that was at its heart a film more for kids than adults.  I fully endorse showing it to all but the most sensitive young children.  But PAN'S LABYRINTH should be restricted to adults only.

The film is set around the time of the allied invasion of Normandy, several years after the victory of the fascists over the leftists in the Spanish Civil War.  Ofelia is a young girl whose mother is traveling to a remote area of Spain where her husband, the brutal military leader Capitn Vidal is engaged in his task of suppressing the resistance that has refused to acknowledge the fascist regime in Spain.  He is on every level a wretched man, focused entirely on appearance and on producing a male heir and otherwise oblivious of the needs of Ofelia's mother, who is suffering a difficult pregnancy.

Ofelia is a reader of books, many of them fairy or folk tales.  Very early in the film she finds herself entering a fairy tale of her own when she sees a praying mantis that she imagines is a fairy and which turns out to be, in fact, a fairy tale.  The fairy leads her through a nearby maze to an entrance to an underground staircase at the bottom of which she encounters a rather gruesome fawn who informs her that she is in fact the daughter of an underground king and is in fact immortal.  He gives her a book of blank pages that he tells her will show her what tasks she must complete in order to return to her parents and her kingdom.

The most interesting thing to me about Ofelia's story is that while one is tempted to read this as an attempt to escape from the hellishness of her life under Capitn Vidal, nowhere is there a hint that her adventures occur merely in her head.  The closest one comes to anything like this is the very end, where Capitn Vidal sees Ofelia, whom we have seen talking to the fawn.  While we can see the fawn, Vidal cannot.  But it is surely not a stretch to imagine that she could see it while he could not, especially given the fact that she was able to enter the entrance to the stairway via a route not accessible to Vidal.  In other words, we are not supposed to be reading her descendence to her previous home as metaphorically escapist, even if it literally is so.

This is a gruesome film.  It is an interesting combination of horribly realistic events combined with nightmarish fantasy scenes.  Vidal is far more monstrous than any of the fantasy creatures Ofelia encounters.  He has a tendency towards violence and cruelty.  He shoots people with only the slightest provocation and does not hesitate to torture suspects with his bare hands.  The tasks that Ofelia are asked to complete are hardly more terrible than what she has to endure living under Vidal's roof.  Despite all the horrors, however, despite all the tragic events in the film, the movie has a wonderfully happy ending that does not feel tacked on.  Rather, it feels like just compensation for all the wretched events in the film.

The cast is wonderful though with one exception I do not think I've seen any of the performers in any previous film.  Ivana Baquero is extraordinary as Ofelia.  She has a magnificent presence throughout the film and recalls some of the finest child actresses of the past few decades, including Jodie Foster, Natalie Portman, and Anna Paquin.  Sergi Lpez is oppressively dominating as Vidal.  He easily goes down as one of the most evil characters I've ever witnessed on film and his final moment, in which the worst vengeance is brought upon him, seems completely just.  Maribel Verd plays Mercedes, the head housekeeper who befriends Ofelia and who is an informant to the resistence in the mountains.  I mentioned above that I had seen only one performer before.  That is Doug Jones, who has carved an interesting niche in film.  Initially a professional mime, Jones gradually has taken a number of fascinating roles requiring unusual degrees of physical expression.  I first became aware of him in the famous Emmy-nominated episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER entitled ""Hush, where he played one of the Gentlemen.  But Jones will be familiar to most film fans from his role of Abe Sapien in Guillermo del Toro's film HELLBOY, a role he is reprising for HELLBOY 2.  In PAN'S LABYRINTH Jones plays two roles, the fawn and the pale monster whose eyes are in his hands.  Both characters are unforgettable (much like the Gentlemen in BUFFY), once seen never to be forgotten.

A couple of reviewers have stated that this film is ""boring.""  I have absolutely no idea what they were talking about or what their film going background is.  I will state in no qualified terms that I can't imagine any sophisticated film viewer not being completely astonished by this film.  I can state in complete honesty that this is the finest film of any kind that I have seen in many years.",1171152000,12,5353,4.546499477533961
7626434,5,B002BYYA9A,"I enjoyed every mesmerizing and horrific minute of this film. Watching Pan's Labyrinth delivers the joy of seeing a well-made film and a darkly beautiful fantasy brought to life. This film, created totally from the imagination of del Toro, feels like it could have been adapted from some classic literary work. Furthermore, the cinematography, music, costumes, sets, makeup, and special effects are all top notch.

I can't wait for the DVD release so I can focus on the visuals and less on the subtitles. Thank you del Toro!",1170892800,2,524,4.954545454545454
7626435,3,B002BYYA9A,"I went into this movie with no expectations, except that I'd see a Spanish-language, adult-oriented fantasy film with English subtitles. I think unmet expectations can hurt people in two ways: either the film disappoints them and they are overly critical as a result, or they are disappointed but too biased to admit it. I think the latter has led to an exceedingly generous rating for this particular film. Is it good? Yes. Is it the 65th best (according to current IMDB ratings) movie of all time? Not even close.

It is an interesting, original story. Virtually every actor appearing in the film is superb. The imagery is magnificent. Like I said, it is a good picture. However, I am puzzled as to why it is praised so highly. I would have a greater appreciation for the film if it's adult-oriented nature was due to its substance, such as an intellectual, sophisticated and enigmatic storyline. It is adult-oriented, however, merely because of a few choice phrases and displays of graphic violence. This is not a film that is breaking new ground. It is too simplistic throughout, becomes fairly predictable, and lacks fluidity. The unimaginative way in which the fantasy elements come and go was a real put off. The 65th best movie of all time should have the fantastic elements blended seamlessly with the human elements. It should continue being original throughout. It should challenge the viewer in new and engaging ways. It should not merely curse, show some blood, and have pretty imagery.

Please, see this movie and enjoy it. I truly did. I also, however, allowed myself to make a realistic assessment afterward. I expect that the rating will come down as the novelty of an adult-oriented fantasy picture wears off. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt a specious film like this can conceal such intricacies.",1170720000,3,1821,4.909090909090909
7626436,5,B002BYYA9A,"It is not very often that one gets to see a filmmaker blossom into greatness.  Scorsese has his ""Taxi Driver,"" Spielberg has his ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of Third Kind,"" Coppala has ""The Godfather"" and Nolan has ""Memento.""  Now director Guillermo Del Toro, who before was one of the most promising talents in the world, has his ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" an achingly and grimly beautiful film.  This is one of those stories where every detail, from the slightest glance, facial twitch and camera move, feels right.  Nothing is forced and setting, character and themes are fully, richly realized.  Set amid the communist insurgency that irritated Franco's fascist government in the aftermath of his victory in the Spanish Civil War, ""Pan's"" opens in 1944 with young Ofelia (a luminous Ivana Baquero) and her sickened mother (Ariadna Gil, whose eyes haunt with ease) traveling to a Fascist outpost in the Spanish woods, where the sadistic Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez, quietly and unforgettably menacing) labors to expunge the last of the rebels from the countryside.  Ofelia's mother is very weak from carrying the Captain's baby boy, a burden she takes on to give her daughter and her unborn son the protection that the Captain can offer, although she is not blind to the Captain's special brand of vicious and inhuman violence against opposing communist guerillas.

To escape from her new and frightful place alongside the Captain and her emaciated mother, Ofelia retreats into her fairy tales, places of innocence and peace.  But one night, a fairy visits her in her room, leading her to a labyrinth in the woods where an old Faun (Doug Jones) resides and waits.  Jones is a revelation, breathing enormous life into his costumed characters, especially his brief but terrifying turn as the Pale Man, a child-devouring monster who pursues Ofelia in the film's most harrowing scene.  The Faun announces to Ofelia that she is a long lost princess of the underground realm, a place that revels in the magic and power of an earlier age when nature and the spirit were one.  But, to prove that Ofelia still possesses the immortal princess' essence, the Faun lays out three tasks for her that, if completed, will earn her a place beside her ancient father in the underworld.  But the tasks are dangerous and, as they escalate, so does the battle between Vidal and the guerillas and the deterioration of Ofelia's mother.  Fantasy, once Ofelia's refuge, is now as uncertain as the world that surrounds her.

At first glance, a film that combines earthy fairy tales a la the Brothers Grimm and period war piece might seem jarring, but Del Toro makes the combination feel effortless.  The two parallel each other perfectly, complementing each other on themes such as Fascist thought and the universal struggle between good and evil.  The rest is just gravy, absolutely, jaw-droppingly gorgeous gravy.  Guillermo Navarro's vivid and fluid cinematography methodically hovers and swirls around searing battle scenes and otherworldly locales with smooth confidence; also, the production design exudes a worn, lived in feel.  But the greatest triumph of the film (other than the stellar writing, acting and directing) is the downright stunning creature designs.  The Faun and the Pale Man are unlike anything that has been seen before, completely original and organic figures seemingly plucked from the realm of dreams and nightmares.  One step on his spindly legs and one flick of his wrist and the Faun has become helplessly endearing.  One frightening upward move of his palms, and the Pale Man becomes one of the most nightmarish figures in cinema history.

Put simply, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a masterpiece.  Del Toro has done something that very few filmmakers before him have done, and it demands to be seen and cherished as an example of the best cinema has to offer.",1170633600,,3851,5.039432176656152
7626437,4,B002BYYA9A,"This was a fairytale for adults, but not in the way most would probably think.  The ""R"" rating came from some scences of graphic violence and language.

I think the best films are made from common and simple themes that have been known for a very long time.  What makes this film great is that it told a story in a very creative yet simple way and sent a message which has been given in countless films before it.  The message I got out of it was that this is a very cruel and unforgiving world.  The main character in the film, Ofelia invented her own reality in order to escape from the cruel world around us.  In the end, did her ""invention"" benefit just her or anyone else as well?",1170460800,6,685,4.190839694656488
7626438,5,B002BYYA9A,"Where do I start with this movie?  Pan's Labyrinth is a marvel of modern filmmaking.  From the enchanting story to the beautiful visuals, Guillermo del Toro's latest film is a modern masterpiece.  Set against the backdrop of post-civil war Spain, a fascist regime has come to power.  Those who don't obey the law are subjected to terrible punishment.

Young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is a girl who likes to get wrapped up in fairy tales.  They serve not only as a form of entertainment, but more and more, she uses them as an escape from the harsh realities of what has become of her home.  The film begins as Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) travel to the Spanish countryside to reunite with Carmen's second husband and Ofelia's step-father Captain Vidal (Sergi Lpez).  Vidal is a firm believer in the fascist government; he follows orders without question and expects those below him to obey him.  When Ofelia arrives, she finds a rock with a design of a king carved into it.  When she examines it, a large dragonfly emerges.  Later, Mercedes (Maribel Verd), one of the house-maids at Vidal's cottage, points out an old labyrinth on the edges of the estate.

After settling in, Ofelia sees the dragonfly again, and learns that it is in fact a shape-shifting fairy.  The fairy leads her through the labyrinth where she meets the Faun (Doug Jones), who tells her that she is a reincarnated princess of the Underworld.  The Faun gives Ofelia a magic book that will reveal three tasks she must complete in order to return to her kingdom.

As she goes about trying to accomplish her tasks, Vidal and his soldiers attempt to stamp out the local resistance movement, which is the reason they are stationed in the cottage.  His preoccupation with erradicating his enemies overshadows Carmen, who is getting sick from the pregnancy.  In a moment of sheer vileness, he calmly tells the doctor attending to her to save the baby if he must choose between the two.  Vidal's cruelty is sickening; he brutally killed a father and son he believed were part of the resistance, only to find out moments after they were dead that their stories explaining why they had guns was in fact true.  During a torture sequence with a stuttering guerrilla, he mockingly told the man that he would be set free if he could count to three without stuttering.

Meanwhile, Ofelia's tasks take her to fantastic places filled with dangerous and terryifying beasts including the Pale Man (Doug Jones), a cannibalistic humanoid with eyes in his hands.  Her interactions with the Faun are both beautiful and creepy; the Faun is terrifying yet gentle and Ofelia's lack of fear around him is interesting in that she is petrified of her step-father, Captain Vidal.  As the movie continues, the real world and the Labyrinth begin to come together, ending with a wonderful climax.

In addition to the great story, the visuals and sound are phenominal.  The creature effects, especially regarding the Faun and the Pale Man, are incredible, and the costumes and set designs are beautiful.  The sound usage is incredible.  Most sounds are accentuated, from the squeeking of the leather in Vidal's uniform to the opening of umbrellas, seemingly trivial sounds break the silence of the times without any dialogue, of which there are many.  However, the scenes without dialogue add just as much to the story as even the most verbose sections of the film.  The characters' varoius motions and mannerisms speak volumes about them.  But possibly the most essential use of sound in the film is the haunting lullaby Mercedes hums to Ofelia.  There are no words to it, and the melody, which is supposed to help people sleep, is beautiful and haunting.

If there is anything I would change about the film, I would add more scenes in the Labyrinth.  Every scene in the film is essential, thus no scene can go.  I would gladly sit through another 30 minutes of film to see more gorgeous scenes of the fantasy world.  If a film's only problem is that it wasn't long enough, that is an amazing compliment.

This is one of the best films of 2006 (it was released in the US in 2007, but will be counted for the 2006 Oscars), and deserves every Oscar it is nominated for.  This film is a modern classic and a perfect fairly tale for adults.",1170288000,6,4294,4.747638326585695
7626439,5,B002BYYA9A,"MOVIE: Pan's Labyrinth is the most beautiful and exquisite film I have seen in the last few years. Guillermo Del Toro has crafted a masterpiece of cinema that slowly bends reality into fantasy. The film is about a young girl named Ofelia who is living in post-war Spain. Her father has died and now she and her pregnant mother are traveling into the country to live with the prestigious Captain Vidal, whom her mother has now remarried with. Captain Vidal is introduced in an early scene as a barbaric murderer who is only interested in Ofelia's mother to bear his child so that his son can grow up with his name. Ofelia escapes into a world of fantasy and horror that is equally as disturbing as the real life events going on around her with the war. There are two parallel storylines in the film. The one that deals with Ofelia in the world of the labyrinth and the storyline with Vidal dealing with revolutionaries who live in the mountains.

The brilliant part of the film is that Del Toro juxtaposes Ofelia's world with the real world. For example, in one part of the film Ofelia must encounter a creature who has eyes in his hands, and even though he sits in front of long table of food he still craves innocent children and innocent creatures. Directly before this scene we see Captain Vidal hosting a giant dinner party where he sits at the head of the table. It's symbolism at its finest. Credit also has to go the superb art direction, make up and visual effects that transport the audience into Ofelia's world. The make up on the faun that instructs Ofelia to complete the tasks is unbelievable. The film takes us deep into the darkest part of the human realm and sends us on an unforgettable journey. Javier Naverette's beautiful score plays a huge role in creating the world of Pan's Labyrinth. I honestly believe it would be a crime if he does not win at the Oscars. He is the only composer nominated worthy of the statue.

ACTING: Ivana Baquero is absolutely stunning in this film as Ofelia. She plays the character beautifully and makes the audience care for her every step of the way. The supporting cast is just as good. Sergi Lopez makes a very convincing and evil Captain Vidal. I think Vidal should be considered as one of the better screen villains in last decade. Credit also should be given to Doug Jones who plays the faun also known as Pan. Jones is one of the better known costume actors in Hollywood and previously worked with Del Toro on Hellboy. He even learned a little Spanish for the role.

BOTTOM LINE: The film medium was created specifically for films like this. Pan's Labyrinth is a rare masterpiece that will stand the test of time. Nothing about the film is unoriginal, it stands on its own as one of the most original pieces of filmmaking in recent memory. I know the film isn't playing at every theater, but every effort should be made to go out of your way to see it. A film that will stay with you long after you see it, it truly must be experienced.",1170201600,6,2993,4.498161764705882
7626440,5,B002BYYA9A,"This is a truly amazing movie. It elicits an extreme range of responses, because it violates  many conventions and expectations - seems to combine opposites. Let's see: it has the most brutal and realistic violence, but also the tenderest insight into the mind of a child. It shows a magical, fantasy realm along with a historical political struggle. It gives us wonderful, bizarre fantasy creatures but uses minimal computer effects. It invites us to to spend an evening with it but denies us any kind of Hollywood happy ending: unlike almost all of today's entertainment, it is a true tragedy, which some cannot accept. (We accept Shakespearean tragedy today because it is placed so safely in a distant world. When the pain and deaths come too close to home, not everyone wants to be at the dreadful display: And perhaps this is reasonable, a form of self-protection from trauma, not wanting to be de-sensitized, to have our reactions numbed. But then, Aristotle thought that tragedy should purify our emotions - ""catharsis."" More opposites, more open questions!)

It gets marketed as a ""fairytale,"" but has - rightly! - an R rating and may have flirted with an NC-17. And anyway, should we think of ""fairytale"" as something Disney-ish and cute, or remember the original grim tales of the brothers Grimm?  (Whatever the label, DO NOT TAKE CHILDREN to this movie. It isn't just ""scary-monster""-ish, it is truly gut-wrenching, above all in the reality of cold-blooded gunshot executions of innocents).

It leaves an open question whether the ""fairy"" realm is shown as real, or a series of sometimes terrifying hallucinations: should it have been ""psychological thriller"" instead?

I'll just look at that particular opposition/contradiction. Is the story about a little girl who enters a magical realm that exists in parallel with our mundane universe? Or is it about a tormented child whose imagination creates the most amazing and sometimes terrifying scenes to escape from her almost unendurable life?

Comparing the ""it does exist"" and the ""it's all imagination "" ways to take the fantasy world: The magic chalk that the Faun gives her is seen by the Captain in the everyday world: BUT: The chalk might just have been around anyway. The mandrake root does seem to really help her mother get better. The root twists and screams when it is put in the fire. BUT: her mother does not seem to hear the mandrake's screams. The bumping and banging under the floor as the horrible child-eating creature is foiled of its prey. BUT: no-one but Ofelia notices it (I think).

At the end where Ofelia is talking to the Faun, the Captain does not see him: to some, this ends the debate (BUT: magical creatures are not necessarily visible to everyone).

The majority assumption, going by responses here, is that all the magical realm is imaginary...but perhaps del Toro has not been absolute about the answer.

What a movie, what an experience.",1169942400,2,2932,4.955193482688391
7626441,5,B002BYYA9A,"Viewers and reviewers of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" have either blessed or cursed the entwining of its two different worlds.  The arguments on both sides seem based on the expectations brought to the film.

My own childhood's difficult search for personal significance recognizes a taste of the familiar in Ofelia's entry into her mythical world.  The film's bittersweet aftertaste, a persistent sensation the day after seeing the film, calls up this perspective.

The film's violence provides context in showing that a powerful sense of significance can overcome even the fear of death.  Both the hidden Revolutionaries and Franco's soldiers view the danger they face as the price paid for their own significance, as defined by their separate causes.

Captain Vidal reaches back for the significance he failed to achieve from his strict father, and forward to the lasting significance that his unborn child would carry into the future.  In the end, his own actions of repairing his father's stopped timepiece and the final results of his brutality - which deny him even the memory of his name - leave his quest unfulfilled.

The myth of the Lost Princess shows Ofelia the path to her own significance.  As a child in war time, she will not find that path in the brutal world around her.  Only in a separate world, where her virtues of courage, ingenuity and resolve have consequence, can she achieve her quest.

And in the last moments of the film, we are assured that she does.",1169856000,7,1470,4.934959349593496
7626442,5,B002BYYA9A,"The remnants of the bloody, three-year Spanish Civil War were still deeply felt in the throes of WWII, and Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro captures the virulence of the country's relentlessly oppressive state in no uncertain terms in his beautifully realized 2006 film, a powerful combination of vivid history and fantastical allegory. Be forewarned that this movie is not for the faint-hearted, as it contains some of the most grisly images I have seen onscreen. However, they are truly essential to the story that del Toro unfolds with emotional precision since they reflect and echo the brutalizing violence during that time when Franco's armies were still eliminating what was left of the Republican rebels in hiding five years after the war's end.

Set around D-Day in 1944 as the Allies are turning the tide of the war, the film takes place in a remote area of northern Spain where ten-year old Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen come to live with her new stepfather, Captain Vidal, the deceptive and sadistic commander of the local outpost. Steeped in her fantasy books, Ofelia is a child often lost in her imagination, and she is drawn to a mysterious stone labyrinth on the property. It is here that she meets the Pale Man, a pedantic faun who assigns three onerous tasks which she must complete by the next full moon in order for her to realize her throne as a princess of the underworld. While this sounds like the trappings of an optimistic fairy tale in ""The Wizard of Oz"" mode, it turns out to be far from it, as del Toro creates a purely gothic world of eye-wincing creatures and actions not far removed from those found in mainstream American sci-fi horror movies. The genuine power of the film comes from the way he juxtaposes this fanciful, scarifying world with the persecution of the resistance fighters and the absolutist, ego-driven domain Vidal has established at the outpost. Each distinctive piece of the movie brings resonance to the other, all the way to the climactic point where they collide in an inevitable way at the end.

Looking a bit like the pre-adolescent Natalie Portman, Ivana Baquero brings a plaintive, yearning quality to Ofelia that is thankfully free of precociousness. As Vidal, Sergi L&oacute;pez effectively brings steely resolve to his role while hinting at the paternal approval his character never received. Maribel Verd&uacute;, memorable as the older woman in Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's ""Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n"", brings coiled power to the pivotal role of Vidal's house servant Mercedes. Also solid are Ariadna Gil as the frail Carmen who acquiesced to Vidal's need for a son, &Aacute;lex Angulo as a kindly doctor, and Doug Jones as the special effects-laden Pale Man. Special kudos need to go to Guillermo Navarro's striking, moody cinematography; Eugenio Caballero's imaginative set designs; and the special visual and sound effects crucial in creating such an otherworldly mood. Unafraid to show scenes of unrelenting horror, Del Toro has created what ultimately is a magical film so audacious in execution that it defies description. Along with Cuar&oacute;n's ""Children of Men"" and Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's ""Babel"", this film shows a true renaissance among Mexican filmmakers on a global landscape.",1169683200,7,3296,5.170411985018727
8749793,5,B002BYYA9A,"I watched this movie for my Spanish 3060 class. While I had to answer questions (for homework) while I watched the movie on my own, I found myself immersed in the story. It was a very good blend of realism and fantasy. The movie's tendency towards melancholy, fear, and pain was more convincing than most movies. However, the fantasy aspect helped supply intrigue, mystique, and some lighter notes within the overall story.
