8089332,5,B000BNKB14,"My favorite for stretching. Just ordered another one. I was in physical therapy for a separated shoulder and after a knee surgery. This helped me so much. I'm pretty fit and didn't think I would need guidance on stretching, but after doing this, I was blown away at how much more flexibility i had and it helped to reduce my pain. better than yoga for flexibility.",1489622400,,364,4.53030303030303
8089333,1,B000BNKB14,the movements on the dvd and the voice over did not match up so for a beginer it was a bit confusing,1356566400,2,100,3.590909090909091
8089334,3,B000BNKB14,"I ordered this planning on using the beginner routine with my kids, and the intermediate routine for myself.  I'm not quite sure if there was a glitch in the production of this disc, or what exactly the explanation is-but there is only one routine with several different menu options which bring you to it.  The stretch routine is nice, but I expected a second slightly more challenging routine.",1285545600,,395,4.794117647058823
8089335,5,B000BNKB14,"I am a stretch freak, who LOVES stretches and can never get enough--so I tried this and found it fabulous. Short, which is good, but effective and with a couple of variations--if you cannot do one, or given it is a DVD speed ahead to the next one. A very calm but non-irritating leader in Amy Brown, perfect for all ages and all levels.",1265760000,,336,4.265625
8089336,4,B000BNKB14,A great mini workout. I was happy to see that there was a beginners and intermediate level. The instructor is calm and explains things well.,1239840000,,140,4.64
8089337,4,B000BNKB14,"First, let's clarify the confusion about the ""beginner"" and ""intermediate"" workouts.  Yes, as the other reviewers have mentioned, the same stretching routine is covered by both levels.  However, as Ms. Brown states in her introduction, the ""beginner"" workout covers the modifications made by her workout partner, Matt.  The ""intermediate"" workout focuses more on Ms. Brown's own stretches. The camera focuses a bit more on the partner during the ""beginner"" workout, and on Ms. Brown during the ""intermediate"" section.  The differences are subtle, certainly, but definitely noticeable.

That said, the video is a good, basic stretching routine.  I did it during the time I had a nasty cold and chose not to do my usual more vigorous exercise program.  The stretching felt great and I would recommend this video to anyone wanting a nice 20 minute stretching routine.",1230940800,4,864,5.262773722627737
8089338,5,B000BNKB14,"I really like this stretch video especially after a long bicycle ride. Amy Brown leads you through a 20 min session and 2 workout levels are included (beginners and intermediate). There are two programs included on the video, but they seem to be identical. For the price the single session is worth it.

I really like the pace and amount of time Amy holds the stretches. She includes some hamstring stretching that I have not seen in other videos. Lying on your back and stretching one leg up, she first has you point your toe out and stretch across, then point your toe in and stretch across. This is one of the best techniques I have found to stretch the outside of my leg from hip to ankle, a place that get very tight for me  with the amount of exercising I do and especially after riding my bike.

She includes a variety of my favorite stretches, mostly laying down and sitting. Arm circles, bridge, lunges, twists, side bends, and neck stretch. She has a very pleasant voice and doesn't talk too much. I highly recommend this video as part of your exercise regime.

See my other review on Amazon along with my web site worldturning dot com. Happy stretching!",1215216000,,1164,4.5285714285714285
8089339,3,B000BNKB14,"The first thing to note is that this video definitely does not come with two workout levels.  I completed the beginner level and decided to immediately move on to intermediate and it was the exact same thing!
I don't know a lot about what makes a workout considered pilates, but I do know this was nothing like any of the pilates classes or videos I have followed -- very little ab or glute work.  I think with regular use this video will 100% improve your flexibility, but as far as getting a great workout I'd definitely pass.  I really don't see how this 20-minute stretching routine will tone anything in your body.  Overall I'd say it's a nice post-workout video to relax and stretch your muscles.",1190073600,8,702,4.5476190476190474
8089340,4,B000BNKB14,"Since on a good day I can do a side split, I just FFwd quick to see if I'd like it overall. It has Amy with the man you see on the dvd demonstrating the poses on simple open studio space. Amy does a voice-over narrates with a semi-soothing voice while she demonstrates the poses & the man shows the modifications. The music is soft, twinkling with a nice beat, kind of a light Enigma style which I enjoy.
The poses done are basic shoulder rolls, using a strap/stretchy band for laying down single leg stretch, bridge pose, laying down spinal twist, sitting wide legged stretches, modified crescent yoga pose thigh stretch, modified yoga pigeon pose, downward dog, standing fwd bend, basic side torso bend & ends with neck stretches.
Though the menu only gives choices of 2 workout levels, beginner & intermediate... on FFWing & looking hard, I could not see a difference in either the types of poses, length or how they are executed. I tried 2 different dvd players to make sure it wasn't a glitch. So be aware it is only one 20 min workout.
For those who like a slow, relaxed simple stretching workout, this is for you. There is no real pilates, this is more yoga/stretching. For those looking for a moderate or faster pace or who have already all basic stretches on other dvds, skip this.
