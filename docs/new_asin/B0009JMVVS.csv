8061977,4,B0009JMVVS,"Brand is at the top of his comedy game in Scandalous.  It makes it more fun if you have at least a bare bones knowledge of the ""Manwell Gate"" scandal but it isn't really necessary as most of it is explained in the routine.  If you're not familiar with Russell Brand, you'll find him original, outspoken, truthful, raunchy, sexy and hilarious.  The fact that this DVD is only available in region 2 is a drag.  As a fan of British comedy, I invested in an all region player (Amazon has several), and found it was worth every penny.",1413331200,,529,4.36734693877551
