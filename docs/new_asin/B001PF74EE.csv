8333179,1,B001PF74EE,"I thought this would be more about what to see in Kolkata, high lights, etc. etc.
Well, in some respects it was, but it was focused almost entirely on English & French influences, their cathedrals and cemetaries, etc. There was very little info on native customs or ways of life. What the video did show regarding native customs and religion was shown in a sort of (in my opinion) condescending manner. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone who has a genuine interest in learning about Kolkata.",1329436800,,497,4.659090909090909
