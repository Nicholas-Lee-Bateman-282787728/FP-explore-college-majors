2581276,5,B000FP2P94,"The best thing about this video is that I didn't have to wait until my baby was sleeping to do it. When she sleeps I have a million other things to do. It's a fun workout and Aileen loves getting raised in the air.

You absolutely HAVE to see Karyne's before and after photos on her website [...] They're extremely inspiring.",1104796800,16,325,4.327868852459017
2581277,5,B000FP2P94,"I love the mom/baby workout video! It gives me a really great workout, it's fun and great for baby too! I was so impressed at how you looked 8 weeks after giving birth that I wanted your prenatal workout video too so that I can look that great next time I have a baby!",1096934400,5,268,3.9814814814814814
2581278,5,B000FP2P94,"Got this off my sisters wish list and she is already using it and said it is fun but enough effort to brake a sweat.

good for any mother and her baby.",1376352000,,151,3.71875
2581279,4,B000FP2P94,"It is a simple guide but works well to my body.
The baby can be some weight for our loosen muscle!
My baby enjoyed some exercises with me.",1357862400,,138,3.9642857142857144
2581280,2,B000FP2P94,Since I loved Steben's Perfect Pregnancy workout I got this as a postnatal video and thought it would be a great way to lose the baby fat and spend time with my baby.  Disappointed - only used it a couple of times.,1328486400,,214,4.095238095238095
2581281,2,B000FP2P94,My baby loves the exercises in this so it is nice to keep him occupied and happy for 15minutes but don't expect a workout.  The title is misleading.  The music is bad and the set is bad.  I had the perfect Pregnancy workout dvd with Karyne Steben as well and liked it alot more than this but at least baby likes.,1313193600,,312,4.081967213114754
2581282,5,B000FP2P94,"I love this DVD! It started off simple (for when I was sore and tired) and worked up to harder moves (there are three workouts). When I did the whole DVD, I really worked up a sweat and she tells you ways to make things easier, if you're having a tough time. It really helped me transition from flabby post-baby body back to my normal size. I started using it around six weeks after birth, my baby is four months now, and we have so much fun working out together. In the beginning there were times when she got fussy, so I went at baby's pace and sometimes we wouldn't do the whole thing. But now she loves it, especially the squats at the beginning of workout #2, it makes her laugh out loud. I highly recommend this DVD!",1309824000,2,722,4.201438848920863
2581283,2,B000FP2P94,I liked her other prenatal workout but this one was not as good. The whole thing isn't as professional as her first workout. It didn't really work for me and my daughter cried through the entire thing. I had to just sit and watch the video. I would look into other mom and baby options. But every baby is different. maybe your baby will like it.,1309132800,,345,4.242424242424242
2581284,3,B000FP2P94,"Not impressed, the video quality SUCKS and it's a tad on the boring side, BUT it's my first workout video that incorporates baby, so it'll do.
I do like how it has 3 workouts, and it's very simple to follow.  I do like how it gets harder as you go into the different workouts.  I LOVE how it includes Baby in almost all of the things you do, she doesn't expect Baby to just lay there and watch as you work out.  Her Baby is pretty mellow, mine is not, but she is still entertained while I do my thing.
All in all, it's ok, for a first try.",1306368000,3,539,3.926605504587156
2581285,4,B000FP2P94,"I like this workout, though I would say if you are looking for a heart pumping, sweat it out, work yourself hard kind of routine you shouldn't purchase this.  I love the fact that I can do it with my 3 month old and that she likes it.  It's a fun way to spend her waketime together.  It does work some of the trouble spots I have left over from my pregnancy, so the first few times I did it I definitely felt it.  But it's not a long term fat burning kind of workout.  Worth the investment more as a way to spend active, up and moving, time with your baby than as a hard core workout (which you can't really do with baby in tow anyway).",1299628800,3,636,3.9375
2581286,4,B000FP2P94,"This dvd is not the best workout ever...  It is however, a fun activity to do with baby.  My daughter is 3 months old and loves the routine.  She giggles through the whole thing.  Baby acts as your free weight throughout the routine.  I guess it will get harder as she gets bigger.  Quality of filming is not that great.  Overall we enjoy it.",1299542400,,342,4.25
2581287,2,B000FP2P94,My wife only got a few minutes into this work out and was dissapointed by the poor quality of the production. She returned it.,1297555200,,126,4.291666666666667
2581288,5,B000FP2P94,I found this video very useful. it gives you a chance to get back into shape in a way that you can also enjoy beautiful moments with your baby.,1289174400,2,143,3.9655172413793105
2581289,4,B000FP2P94,"There are 3 workouts on the video, that you can do separately, or one after another. The first one is for the first 4 weeks after birth and then progresses.

I started way too late, I think. With my baby being 4 months and 8 kilos. Tough! I can really feel the workout the next day - my abs, legs, arms.

My baby loves it! The exercises that I do with him, he laughs a lot. And it is nice that there are some where he just lays on the floor in front of me so that he can relax between the exercises too.

I just wish that she would explain how to do the exercises during the video. At the moment there is an introduction section where she explains how to properly do the main types of exercises but there is no commentary almost for the posture, what muscles you are supposed to be working, etc. during the video.",1288656000,5,813,4.06875
2581290,4,B000FP2P94,"After reading some of the reviews here I chose this DVD and the Lindsay Brin.

Brin's is much more professional, and impressively flexible with its various effort levels and multiple components. But it doesn't include baby, which makes it one more thing to cram into baby's naptime - plus, one of the ab exercises I've since been told you shouldn't do - Brin doesn't mention ""diastasis"" once, and you would hope for more awareness.

This workout, on the other hand, does include baby, which makes it much more practical. Baby enjoys it when he's in the mood, and even when he's not, he'll generally tolerate it - and I'll sometimes get some smiles even if he's in a grump. He especially loves it when I do push-ups over him.

It doesn't look hard, and certainly it doesn't challenge in the way that the Brin workout can, but I do a similar style class every week and this nevertheless has the ability to make me ache a little the next day, and it does make me break a sweat. I find the fact that it's gentle to be a real benefit, in fact: it's not a daunting prospect, it's doable even when I'm tired, so I'm much more likely to do it than the Brin. And even though she's obviously super-fit, it really is her baby, just 8 weeks old, and she genuinely engages with her during the exercises, which is both charming and helpful as an example.

It's made up of three short workouts - the first is carefully designed for the first four weeks post-natal, and is not much more than Kegels and stretches; the other two (about 15' with stretches) are full-body workouts, lifting your baby in the air, swinging it (in a controlled way!) to work your triceps, using it as resistance in sensible but challenging abdominal exercises. You can run all three together comfortably, using the first workout as a warm-up.

I'd give it five stars, but it's too short - I'd have liked a couple more workouts so I could chop and change a bit more.",1273017600,25,1926,4.475783475783476
2581291,3,B000FP2P94,"Good workout to do with a little one. The first set, you can easily modify to include your baby in it. The quality of the video leaves a lot to be desired, but if you can overlook that, you will enjoy the workout.",1267228800,,213,3.9767441860465116
2581292,3,B000FP2P94,It's been hard to make it to the gym since my daughter was born.  I was looking for an exercise dvd I could do with the baby that would help me get back into shape.  This dvd was not as challenging as I hoped.  I would recommend this for mothers looking for a light workout with the baby.  Perhaps this dvd would have been more ideal 2 months ago.  My daughter is now almost 4 months old.,1266710400,4,388,3.987012987012987
2581293,5,B000FP2P94,"I've been doing the workout since 4 weeks postpartum and was back in my pre-pregnancy jeans before 10 weeks - to a great extent thanks to this workout! What makes it even better is it's a great activity and fun for my daughter. Not only it's an efficient workout for me, it seems as a developmental exercise for her too!",1266364800,5,320,4.35
2581294,4,B000FP2P94,"I've only done this video a few times, but it seems like it is a good one.  My baby is now 3 months old and I wish I would have gotten it sooner.  My baby really likes when we do this video.  He laughs and cooes.  The quality isn't the best, but it works for what I need.",1265932800,,271,3.6206896551724137
2581295,4,B000FP2P94,"My 14 week old and I just tried this DVD for the first time today and we both enjoyed it.  We did all 3 workouts.  The first one is designed for the first weeks after pregnancy, but it a good intro for the rest of the workout.  The other 2 workouts were a little more challenging, especially with my 16 pound little man as the weight!  I worked with a trainer throughout my pregnancy and am in fairly good shape and this wasn't extrememly challenging, but it is a nice way to work the muscles while bonding with the baby.  If I can't wait for him to fall asleep to workout, this is a nice option to have!",1265932800,3,604,4.084745762711864
2581296,5,B000FP2P94,"I am impressed with this DVD. All instructions were clear to follow. It is organized into 3 segments, with the first portion being appropriate within a few days of delivery. The instructor gave clear directions and showed modified exercises for those with diastasis recti (abdominal separation), as well as a few others (modified squats, for example.) I feel that the exercises are gentle, yet effective. My 2-month old baby was not very interested, but by three months he enjoyed the exercises.

I bought this DVD hoping to strengthen my body to the point I could resume more strenuous workouts. I am pleased with the results. This DVD focuses primarily on strengthening the muscles, with extra focus on abdominals and pelvic floor muscles. It is not an aerobic workout.",1265328000,11,771,5.0234375
2581297,5,B000FP2P94,"When my baby was six weeks old I tried it for the first time. I thought it was WAAAY too easy and he didn't like it at all. I turned it off when he started crying.

I tried it again when he was nine weeks old. He seemed ok with it and was getting heavy enough to make me feel like I was doing something. It wasn't terribly strenuous, but I figured some exercise was better than none so I did it from time to time.

Now my baby is 4 months old and fifteen pounds . Holy frijole! What a workout! The best part of all is that HE LOVES IT! It's like an amusement park ride for him. He smiles and laughs the whole time and just as he starts to get bored with one movement, it's on to a new one and he's laughing again. It's incredibly motivating to keep on going when I look at his face and I can feel ""worked"" when I'm done.
One thing that surprised me was how much he enjoys the parts when he is on the floor and I exercise over him. I thought that he would only enjoy the lifting exercises, but the ""kiss the baby"" pushups are one of his favorite parts. He also gets to workout with me because he gets so excited that he kicks his legs snd swings his arms!

My advice to you would be to get this DVD early and try it. If it doesn't work for you or your baby the first time, wait a few weeks and try again. If it's STILL not good, wait a bit more and try again. It's like everything else with a baby- you can't make any hard and fast rules about what they like because they change so fast. Don't miss out on the experience, though. It's the one thing that I can do that gets him to laugh EVERY TIME. Take the time to be persistent. it's definitely worth it!!!",1253836800,68,1656,3.9226190476190474
2581298,3,B000FP2P94,"I used this ""workout"" during the 1st 2 weeks after giving birth. After that, it was way too easy and boring. I wouldn't recommend this if you have been exercising regularly throughout your pregnancy. It's quite easy. However, if you want to use it for the very 1st few days or weeks just to get yourself back into the mindset of working out, it could be beneficial.

I LOVED the workout of hers designed for DURING the pregnancy. That video was VERY challenging, yet soothing. I used it almost every day, plus added some cardio every other day.

The post pregnancy workout was, therefore, a bit of a letdown.",1252713600,2,608,4.568807339449541
2581299,4,B000FP2P94,My baby likes it. And its fast. Great for the first four weeks after birth too.,1237334400,,79,4.0
2581300,5,B000FP2P94,"Most other workouts show photos of Mom and baby together on the cover, but in the actual video, there is little to no interaction with the baby in your workout.  But this video truly involves the baby in Mommy's exercises!  I just finished a quick 20 min workout with my baby, and my baby LOVED doing these exercises with me!!  He was laughing and smiling, having a ball!  I highly recommend this video.  I have her prenatal video, which I found to be too advanced for me, but this video is just right.  I feel a little sore, but not too much.  I got a good workout and some quality interaction with my baby, it's perfect!",1228694400,7,622,4.310344827586207
2581301,5,B000FP2P94,I am so glad to own this video. I have a 3 month old daughter and she smiles up a storm when we do the exercises together. Even the father tries to join in on the fun. I definatly feel more strength in my upper thighs and mid area. I look forward every time I use this work out video to help myself get into shape again and watching my daughter smile and giggle. Thank You.,1219708800,4,373,3.9210526315789473
2581302,4,B000FP2P94,"I tried this workout first when my son was 1 month old. And we both didn't like it at all. It was still difficult for him to hold his head steady and that's why it was difficult for me to hold him properly during the exercises. Also he didn't like being put on the floor while I was stretching (workout suggested to ""put the hand on your baby so she knows that you are here"", but my baby just didn't get that message).
Since I really liked ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" I gave this workout one more try when my son was 2 months old. This time we both liked it a lot. It was one of the first times I heard him laughing out loud. The workout was good enough to make my muscles sore next day, but at the same time easy enough not to make me afraid of dropping the baby. This time my son was watching me during stretching and it was rather interesting for him.
Now my son is 3 months old and I feel that we are outgrowing this workout. He is becoming too big and too heavy, so I cannot hold him like the workout suggests anymore. I still do the exercises, since it's a real fun for us both, but I think that we have only a couple of weeks left.
So, try it out, it's a real fun (just make sure your baby holds her head steady and pays attention to your movements). But be ready that it will work for you only for couple of months only.
By the way, the workout has a part that can be used during the first four weeks postnatal. It actually doesn't involve the baby - the baby just lays on the floor. Also it was too easy for me even during those first weeks.",1193702400,14,1554,4.0
2581303,3,B000FP2P94,"I personally didn't find these workouts helpful and actually injured myself trying the first workout too soon after birth.

However, the way she integrates the baby into the workout actually inspired me to come up with my own set of exercises (actually from Pilates for Moms DVD)which involve the baby.  Being able to do even 15 minutes of exercise with the baby included is definitely important in the first few months after birth.  So the idea is there, but the workout isn't great.

I will say, however, that I loved her prenatal workout.  If you're looking for a good postnatal workout, I'd recommend Pilates for Moms over this one.",1184716800,6,636,4.798165137614679
2581304,4,B000FP2P94,"My baby is 7 weeks old and already I feel the need to get something more intense.  This workout was awesome and I started 3 weeks after birth.  It has gotten me much stronger and I think that's why I'm ready to move on.  Most moves have the mom using the baby as resistance, and while this might be great for a baby about 2 or 3 months old, my newborn didn't really care for it at all.  Even now at 7 weeks, she struggles to get through the whole thing and is usually crying.  To remedy this, I simply use hand weights instead and let the baby nap while I'm working out.  I highly recommend the Perfect Pregnancy Workout as it kept me so fit right up to birth - and I believe my labor was shorter because of it.",1167782400,4,711,4.00709219858156
2581305,2,B000FP2P94,"I absolutely loved the Perfect Pregnancy Workout by Karyne....just couldn't get into this one.

I started doing this video when my baby was about a month old.  I had worked out with her Perfect Pregnancy Workout up until a couple of weeks before the birth of my son.

I personally found the exercises not challenging enough and awkward...maybe I was looking for doing too much too soon?!  Just was not as impressed with this video.  I found myself going through the entire video to feel like I had exercised.  I did the workout half a dozen times and then went to the library and got a Denise Austin video.  Sorry...it just wasn't as good as the pregnancy video.

Her Prefect Pregnancy Workout is definately worth it, not this one though.",1164931200,26,738,4.623076923076923
2581306,5,B000FP2P94,"I can't say enough good things about The Perfect Postnatal and Prenatal workouts. I used the Prenatal workout and two doctors told me being in good shape led to an easy delivery and recovery (I also did Shiva Rea's prenatal yoga DVD, light weightlifting, and walking). I started the first Postnatal workout (there are 3) 4 weeks after delivery, but it is gentle enough to start earlier. I did all 3 in a row until my son was 7 months old, smiling all the way through. I loved spending the time with him and I'm almost back in my prepregnancy jeans. Now, I am pregnant for the second time and thrilled I have these workouts to look forward to. I STRONGLY encourage all mommies and mommies-to-be to start or keep up the exercise - I am so relieved I did!",1163116800,11,752,4.378571428571429
2581307,5,B000FP2P94,I wish I had this DVD as soon as my son was born.  I lost my pregnancy weight within three weeks of his birth from nursing yet I was overweight before I was pregnant so I had more to lose.  My legs got smaller but my stomach was different and bigger as it is after having a baby.  Grant is now 10 months old and I decided to do something about it.  I was terribly out of shape and this video is wonderful.  It is a great starter point.  It is difficult starting now because my son is 27 pounds.  It's a lot of weight to start with.  I would suggest this video shortly after your child is born.  It would be much easier to start with a 10 pound baby.  My son just smiles and loves doing this with me.  If he gets antsy he crawls away for awhile...but he always comes back for more.,1161648000,40,780,3.9358974358974357
8125244,4,B000FP2P94,"Good! Involved baby more than most postpartum exercises which I really liked! It also gives options depending on your ability, I like that it is fun for baby but also productive for mom!",1517270400,,186,4.666666666666667
8125245,3,B000FP2P94,"So I absolutely love this workout, my little one is 10 weeks old and he thinks it's so funny, he smiles and makes noises the whole time! If you don't work out much (like me) it'll definitely leave you feeling sweaty and slightly sore the next day and hopefully it'll help me get back down to my pre pregnancy weight! I love how it involves your little one and you use your baby as the weight for many of the exercises. I looked at lots of reviews for other post natal work outs with baby and I'm glad I chose this one. I admit it's not super high quality but you don't buy a work out DVD for the quality of the filming. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because after only using it twice the sound went out on it and now I have to watch it without it :(",1500940800,,756,3.9155844155844157
