8601653,5,B00E5ZFEIY,"The recorded rehearsal was exemplary of Bernstein's uncompromising artistic vision, charismatic musical leadership and his informal report with orchestras, who knew him as Lenny.  He could be a demanding conductor, yet defuse any tension with quick wit and humor.  The rehearsal and performance of the Nimrod movement was transcendent.",1482883200,,335,5.816326530612245
8601654,5,B00E5ZFEIY,"This was all I could have wanted.  I was dreading watching the 'rude interruption to the speech of welcome', but I allowed that Lenny knew the first violinist well, was probably deeply embarrassed that he was so late and last but not least, this is Lenny in his late years, where his health was failing.  His total commitment to the music comes before everything however, and this is really what I treasure.  He appreciates, charms and encourages his players and wins out in the end.  I loved it.  And the performance was electrifying, the audience loved it and most of all Yehudi Menhuin wrote to Lenny saying how much HE loved ""Nimrod"".  Bravo.",1431216000,2,646,4.672566371681416

Buy the Young Peoples Concerts for your grandchildren before they think that music is the noise that prevails today.",1403740800,2,276,5.111111111111111

There was a documentary where discussion and rehearsal footage was cut into the concert footage of the live perfomance (that was an unfortunate purchase).
