2917123,1,B000U713UE,"The biggest trash I have ever seen, the name of the dvd has nothing in comment with the content. The pictures and a very few seconds of the footage taken of King on the stage are so miserable, the quality is so bad that you can't even watch it. Unbelievable, footage taken in the 50's is better than the one taken in the 70's. The worst documentary of the King I have ever seen. Don't buy it, they should give the money to you, I don,t want to keep this dvd in my Elvis collection",1194825600,13,480,4.063157894736842
2917124,1,B000U713UE,"I have never seen such a terrible ""documentary""; not only does it belittle and denigrate the image, the memory, and the person of Elvis Presley, it contains no new footage or information concerning Elvis.

The bulk of the film is Elvis performing on the Ed Sullivan Show, the Steve Allen Show, and his earlier performances around the south in the mid-1950s.  The Las Vegas parts are just grainy, poor quality vignettes of Elvis in concert.  As a matter of fact, the video has very little to do with Elvis during his Vegas years.

This film was made just for money and to talk dirt about Elvis.  A waste of money, and, more importantly, a TOTAL waste of time and intellect!  Don't even bother to view this piece of trash.  There are so many insightful and great documentaries out there chronicling Elvis Presley's life that to waste your time and money on this one would be a shame.  Elvis Presley was so much more than the sick, exhausted, addicted man that he was in the last year or so of his life.  This film centers everything on the negative and nothing on the positive.  It is just ridiculous and definitely NOT WORTH IT!",1194393600,37,1127,4.534653465346534

8212241,3,B000U713UE,"A well-written and delivered essay about how a Country boy became a Las Vegas icon forms the basis of this occasionally messy attempt to encapsulate an extraordinary and complicated career.
For new fans, the old clips look okay; for old fans, the previously unseen 8mm and still shots will hold some interest. But the images rarely correspond to the narration. We hear that the 1957 ""Jailhouse Rock"" is his greatest film, then find the trailor for said picture in the section where his Hollywood decline of the '60s is discussed.
The point of the whole thing is (apparently) to contrast ""Vegas"" with the 1956 Elvis, who was raw and funky, explosive, all shook up. Ironically, Elvis did appear in Vegas that year, but the venue was off-limits to his young fans. The commentary would have been improved to mention this strange phenomenon: Elvis didn't connect with the middle-aged fans originally, but years later actually structured his show *around* that demographic!
There's a distasteful inclusion of a supposed example of Elvis ""losing it"" in public, presumeably because of false rumours. He sounds quite perturbed, but if one listens closely he makes perfect sense. He says that he is at the center of a major enterprise, involving the transport of three airplanes worth of people and equipment, and the presentation of the biggest musical show in the world. How can he be spaced out and deliver at the same time?
But despite the obvious bias and the poorly integrated visuals, and the short running time, there's enough interesting stuff to keep this DVD out of the ""Used DVDs"" bins for a while.",1229299200,,1600,4.92962962962963

On the back of the video cover it states this release is ""unauthorised.""  Once you view it, you will understand why. It is a disgrace to Elvis and his legacy.  For one thing, a child could have done a better job in assembling these images which renders this video nothing more than a makeshift endeavor and ultimately a random compilation of performances, most of ridiculously poor quality.  Not only are the blurred images of Elvis performances embarrassing to the filmmaker so too the narrator.  This Brit's accent is rather annoyingly redundant in his negative recounting of an artist's life. He obviously knows very little about Elvis or his audiences nor does he even care to find out about it in order to provide viewers with anything remotely worth watching.  The video lacks a story line and a theme.  The sound and words are out of sync with the images making a bad lip sync look professional next to this production.  What was the point of that? Lastly, Destination Vegas has nothing to do with the wonderful and meaningful Vegas years of Elvis and as for the story of Elvis getting there, well, this Brit ought to stick to topics on his side of the ocean.  Extremely overpriced item.",1199923200,6,1359,5.288372093023256
8212243,1,B000U713UE,The title is very deceiving. The story was not put together very well. Seemed like a cut and paste project.,1199750400,3,107,4.4
8212244,1,B000U713UE,This was a waste of money.  It had less than many of the other dvd's that I have purchased.  I would not recommend anyone wasting their money to buy this particular dvd.,1196812800,2,169,4.25
8212245,2,B000U713UE,There really wasn't alot of new material. Most of what there was was grainy and poor quality.  There is some new material alot in the audio track.  I can really only recommend this to the die hard Elvis fan that wants everything there is on Elvis.,1196467200,7,247,4.3478260869565215
8212246,2,B000U713UE,"I was expecting much more from this video.  It was basically home video taken by someone at one of his concerts.  Not very good.  Also, the audio portion, was very disturbing.  Should have been more insight as to what brought on his speech.",1195603200,4,240,4.511627906976744
