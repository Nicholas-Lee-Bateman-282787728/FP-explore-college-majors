8314150,5,B001K2ZZ66,My 7 year old son found the video easy to follow.  Lots of fun ways to remember many aspects of the game.  The video is done in chapter format so its easy to rewatch specific parts.,1331510400,,181,4.0
8314151,1,B001K2ZZ66,"This video has nothing for kids and is a complete waste of money. I would have thought that the ultimate junior lesson for kids would show some interaction with kids. At least we would have known that the kids are able to understand Clay Chappell's lessons, but NOO!!! We don't even have one kid hitting one ball! All we have is Mr. Chappell's monologue and his mantra "" Hello Mr. Golf Ball, I am going to smash you!!!"" After paying for the video, I feel like saying ""Hello Mr. Clay, I feel like smashing you!!""

Buy it only if you really like larger credit card balances.",1257897600,,572,4.39622641509434
8314152,5,B001K2ZZ66,This video is a must have for those young golfers learning the basics of the game.  I found this video to be very enlightening and enjoyable throughout.  My two sons (12 and 6 yrs. old) learned alot from this video.  I am going to recommend this dvd to all my friends and fellow club members.  Thanks Mr. Chappell..  Can't wait for the next installment in the future.,1246924800,,367,4.417910447761194
