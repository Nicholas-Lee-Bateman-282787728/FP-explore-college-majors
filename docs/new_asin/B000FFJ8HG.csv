8121860,4,B000FFJ8HG,"PRIDE or PRIDE Fighting Championships is the largest mixed martial arts organization in the world. It is based in Japan and currently promoted by Dream Stage Entertainment (DSE). Its inaugural event was held at the Tokyo Dome on October 11, 1997, promoted by Kakutougi Revolution Spirits (KRS). It is the most popular MMA organization in the world based on the number of event attendees: the PRIDE Final Conflict 2003 event had over 67,000 people in the audience. The audience record is 91,107 people on the PRIDE and K-1 co-production Shockwave/Dynamite, held in August 2002. It is considered to be the premiere MMA organization on the planet.

PRIDE 22: Beasts From The East was a smaller event that was pretty much a lead-up to the mega-show that was PRIDE 23.  Taking place at the 12,000 seat Nagoya Rainbow Hall, DSE didn't set up any real high-profile fights for this show.  With that said, some of the fights ended up being much better than originally expected, resulting in a quality event.

The show stealer in this event is the second-to-last fight between Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson and Igor Vovchanchyn.  Always one of the most entertaining and charismatic personalities in the fight game, Rampage doesn't disappoint with his performance.  Look forward to a ton of crazy slams and suplexes in this one.

Overall, a decent show that surpassed my expectations.  If you;ve got the money the spare, it's definitely a title worth picking up.  If you're a fan of Quinton Jackson this is a must-own.",1152489600,6,1503,4.956175298804781
