8236359,3,B000JLQQ3U,"This is in chineese with english subtitles (very small and hard to read).  Probably the movie was first made in 1950? and recently released on DVD in 2007, so expect this really old movie to be grainy on the dvd.  The description of this movie says that 'Every manner of blade and edged weapon is used in this incredible swordplay saga.'.  Well.. this is not true.  The movies has everyone running around with a sword, but the girl has a homemade (primitive) axe.  I'm not running it down, and it is amusing if you want to see 'the wires' holding up a girl as she flys through the air (like in a broadway play).  The action sequences are far and few between. A dart and rope were used, but I could do better in my own back yeard.  Actually, if you took a stick and swung it (slowly), your would be demonstrating more kung fu skills that these folks.  Also the description states that 'The Flying Swordsgirl is absolutely as good as it gets!'.  WRONG.  The actors had no knowlege of kung fu at all.  If you want the best, get any of the Shaw Brothers movies.  Those are what action is all about.  Those Shaw Bros. movies used acrobats who could really do some great kung fu stuff.  Swordgirl actors were no better than the average person walking down the street, and probably were.  I actually enjoyed the movie, but for it's cuteness, and nothing more.",1173744000,,1352,4.417004048582996
