8377349,5,B002PUKJQS,"A wonderful film that is totally unknown in the states.  A beautiful story with a touch of the fantastic,  based on a story by the neglected  - in the west - Alexander Grin. The hero, a  pianist named Garvey, travels to a city he has never visited before yet almost everyone there knows him  by name. What drives him to do this? And who is the beautiful title character?

The film is about 20 minutes longer than advertised and grows on you more with each viewing.",1438560000,,464,4.337209302325581
