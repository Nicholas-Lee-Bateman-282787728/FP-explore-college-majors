1386420,5,B000050Y7V,"The Osmond's. Are a very talented family. The Osmond's ""pure and simple"" is a great look at this famous family. Gives a lot of insight into the lives of each Osmond. They have had 47 gold and platinum records and have sold more than a hundred million records. Very entertaining biography. I would also recommend the Osmond's live in concert!",1173312000,10,341,4.7
1386421,3,B000050Y7V,"The Osmonds-Pure and Simple is very good for people who want to know more about the Osmonds. The 50 minuit story about the Osmonds covered about 60 years. From the marriage of the Osmond parents-George and Olive-to the birth of their sons and the early career of them to the Andy Williams. It goes into some detail about what went on during the 1970's when they hit it big with things like One Bad Apple and Crazy Horses. It gives some interesting storys about that time such as Donny had to stand on a grate so he could reach the mike while singing One Bad Apple.
The show also goes into what happened to each of them after the first Donny and Marie show got cancelled in 1979. They talk mostly about Donny and Marie, though. They spend some time talking about the new Donny and Marie show and they show a humorous clip when Donny is talking about remodling a tub and Marie quips ""You take baths?"" Donny who has a hammer in his hand says""Don't make me use this.""
All in all it is a pretty good 50 minuits spent.",1073088000,14,1012,4.276041666666667
1386422,5,B000050Y7V,"This video, produced for the Arts & Entertainment Network's ""Biography"" series, is a nice overview of the entire Osmond family's musical career.  Narrated in the traditional style of other ""Biography"" broadcasts, the video features many photographs, interviews and rare film and video clips of the entire Osmond family growing up in show business from 1960 to 1999.  Aside from interviews from all family members, the show is interspersed with viewpoints from Andy Williams, Mike Curb (who produced much of their recorded material) and an editor from Rolling Stone (who admitted he purchased a 45 of ""One Bad Apple"" when it was released, much to the possible consternation of his fellow editors!).  Although all of the video clips are enjoyable, there aren't as many as an avid Osmond fan might want.  I would have liked to have seen more segments from the Andy Williams Show and a clip from their great performance of ""Yo-Yo"" from Flip Wilson's variety show.  Understandably, it IS tough to highlight forty years of entertaining in a one hour program.  The major theme of the entire program for the viewer is that of the remarkable binds that the Osmond family possess.  Each Osmond brother (and Marie) relate the support that they received from each other.  Even though their popularity has ridden the standard show business wave, every member of the family was involved in each other's undertakings and incredibly supportive.  The family has held to their strong moral beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints within an industry that, obviously, is skeptical of Christian thought and practice.  They all believe that their faith and family unity kept them away from the temptations that show business offers.  Aside from some great music and undeniable talents exhibited over a long period of time, I came away with a greater appreciation and repect for the entire family because of this video.",1044230400,30,1915,5.06687898089172

1386471,4,B000050Y7V,"This was an historic look at the Osmond history and lifestyle of the guys.  Really interesting from their beginnings to 1998 when it finished, but the interviews with the Osmonds were lovely and quite in depth.",1349136000,,210,4.833333333333333
1386480,3,B000050Y7V,"The DVD was an older one, so obviously it didn't have the High Tech elements going on.  It was heartwarming to hear the stories from the various brothers, but not thorough enough to give the listener a good background. I would have liked to see longer concert clips and more comments from the brothers.",1342915200,,302,4.592592592592593

1386484,5,B000050Y7V,"I have been an avid fan of the Osmonds for decades and yet this Biography of the Osmonds provided great insight into the lives of the Osmonds on both personal and professional view points, and as a family.

Through this biography you get to watch performances of the Osmonds through the many, many years that they have been in the show business from the beginning till the time this biography covers.

Each Osmond is interviewed and you get to learn little bits of information about them and their lives, fears, dreams, etc.

For example, Jay who used to look at the camera a lot is actually in reality afraid of being in front of the camera.  For him, the thought of being featured in a biography meant being once again casted in the spotlight and once again, in front of the camera and that scared him.

You get to realise just how proud the Osmonds are of each other as a family member and as a professional artist.  How glad they are that they have been able to stay in the music business as a family through all these years and how for them it doesn't matter who is in the spotlight as long as it's an Osmond.

Get this DVD and journey with this wonderful family through their years of being in the show busincess and learn how their faith and love for each other kept them true to each other and to themselves - without compromise.",1216771200,7,1337,4.366935483870968

1386487,5,B000050Y7V,"The entire family can watch it without worry, and really gain insight into the famous Osmond family and learn what it was and is that keeps them pure and simple.",1190592000,,161,4.4
1386488,4,B000050Y7V,"The Osmonds are an interesting and talented family. What showmanship and they are great singers and it's fun to see them play instruments.  I have the ""Best of the Andy Williams Christmas Shows"", and you HAVE to get this one too.  The Osmonds are amazing in this and really lifts the show up.  Please also get the Best of the Donny and Marie Shows.  Our kids LOVE it and so does my husband and I.  THEN, please get the Donny and Marie Christmas show.  What a wonderful family Christmas show.  All of the Osmond brothers, (even Virl and Tom), are singing-dancing-and playing instruments!  Entertaining and innocent and FUN! Sometimes I'm tired of people thinking/saying that older shows are hokey.  These shows blow away our recent shows.  Why do we have to use sex to try to make it a good show or to attract an audience?  Why can't it just be a good show because it's a good show with out the sex.  The Osmonds are a good example and you can see they have fun with each other and enjoy working with one another, how encouraging!  Get this one!",1190160000,2,1044,4.431578947368421

7929171,3,B000050Y7V,"This Biography, was educational about when the boys came along, but Marie must have been an extremely confidential and a private person.  There was once a TELEVISION movie, interrupted by PLENTY of commercial breaks, to mislead the audience viewers, possibly.  I definitely understand and respect that they need their privacy, of course.

But as beautiful of a woman that Marie is, and she KNOWS it, she has a strong EGO!  But this is just my opinion.  I have been a fan of her and her brothers through the 70s' and the 80s', as they faded out, one by one.

Maries' son Stephen, has her first grandson, with a few photos, but no family photos, and I say okay, so they wanted to stay out of the spotlight.  Thats' cool.  Simplicity is definitely the word to describe this biography.

I would not purchase it again, I only purchased this DVD out curiousity.",1415750400,,855,4.6092715231788075
