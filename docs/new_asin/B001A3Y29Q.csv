8275914,4,B001A3Y29Q,"As a technical instructor, I made this video series mandatory for my students of computer/networking class.  Very informative, while still very entertaining, mainly because of the excellent, almost toungue-in-cheek, manner of Bob Gringely's interviews and narration.  His access to reminiscences and opinions of techno heavy's such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs in itself makes this documentary very significant and impressive historically.  A bit dated, but don't let that deter you from enjoying it.  If you are the slightest bit nerdy, you'll love it.",1295222400,,553,5.5476190476190474
