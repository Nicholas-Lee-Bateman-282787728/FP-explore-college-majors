7856064,5,6303908233,"Good travelogue. I bought it to replace teh one that I had which was damaged.  Why doesn't someone place these VHS tapes onto a DVD?
The creators of these particular Swiss Rail journies have done a better job that some other have.  It would be nice to have some done during the 2000s as the ones on VHS are made in the 1980s and 1990s.",1455148800,,335,4.138461538461539

The whole series should be on PBS at least once a month and I guarantee you'll raise some serious money with these awesome panoramic video's of Switzerland and the surrouding areas . Unfortunately ""NO ONE"" has made these available on cd and could make a fortune just re-formating these on CD to sell on the PBS stations . Watch just one and you'll know what I mean . IT will take your breath away . The Best travel videos I have ever seen as far as scenic area's go . ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL ! Sincerly, Pat Simmons",1221955200,,575,4.383177570093458
