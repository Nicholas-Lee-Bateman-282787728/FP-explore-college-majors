6124223,3,B00GYI9AYY,"I don't think this is really Shotokan.  Having studied it for years this is a variation of Shotokan.  Still, maybe this will not matter to you.  If you are interested in a workout or just some activity there is no harm.  I would not expect to walk into a traditional Shotokan class and just jump right in.",1416528000,9,305,4.298245614035087
6124224,1,B00GYI9AYY,Thought I could supplement my Shoktokan Karate classes with these cd's. Won't be happening. He is not using the Japanese terms used in the style which is what I needed help with through re-enforcement.  The music is pure cheese.  It's just purely awful.,1416268800,5,253,4.8604651162790695
6124225,5,B00GYI9AYY,"Before I begin my review, here's a little about my experience in Martial Arts :
I have studied Martial Arts in some form or another since I was child (approximately 8 years old), and have been thoroughly trained in various styles. I studied 3 Japanese forms of Karate-Do including; Yoshukai Karate (which was directly formed from Chito-Ryu and the grandchild form of Shorin-Ryu), Goju-Ryu, and Wado-Ryu. I've also been trained in American Kenpo, Tai Chi, American Boxing and Kickboxing, as well as some informal training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Judo at the local MMA gym. I am also a student of the Japanese Language and currently studying Shotokan Karate-Do (using this DVD set) as well as continuing my Tai Chi training.

Since Shotokan Karate-Do is (basically) the Father of all Japanese forms of Karate, I've always had an interest in studying the art form. However, in my area Dojos for this form are non-existent (and several other styles have vacated the area as well). So for a long time, I felt that the only way I could learn this style is that I'd have to relocate to another area, or go to Japan (on an extended stay) and study there. As much as I'd love to go to Japan to study, at this point in time, it didn't seem very likely.

Besides the (near) impossible idea of relocating to study in a Dojo, taking a class is also impractical for me personally because a few years ago I was in a traumatic accident that cost me my right calf muscle and the ability to walk without using crutches. So for a while, I felt that my Martial Arts career had expired and there was no way I could further my training...

That is, of course, until I stumbled upon the ""Complete Shotokan Karate"" DVD set by Jon Hodge-Sensei. I decided to take a gamble on this DVD set and see if maybe I could at least learn about the art form. Well, I've been following along fairly diligently for the past few weeks or so, and I must say I'm blown away by the results I've received. Not only am I learning a form of Karate that I've longed to study since childhood, I've actually made leaps and bounds in my recovery. I had been out of Physical Therapy for a while, so I've been using this DVD as my guide, and after learning the techniques that Hodge-Sensei teaches, I'm actually moving forward again. I've regained balance and strength within my right leg (can even perform the ""Crane Stance"" on it, which is a one legged stance), my endurance and stamina is up, and I've even regained some of the motion within my right foot (which was pretty much a stump beforehand). I may not be able to run the New York City Marathon right now, but I'm making a lot of progress that I wouldn't have otherwise.
Since starting this DVD set, I've also been incorporating some basic Tai Chi movements into my daily routine as well as an added supplement and they both seem to be paying off.

As far as the Instruction and Material on the DVD itself goes, everything is laid out in an easy to follow manner.
Hodge-Sensei goes through the stances, techniques, kata, kumite, and self defense portions of each belt multiple times, in many angles, and gives a thorough explanation regarding the Bunkai (Philosophy and Reasoning why each technique is performed). He also provides a step by step instruction, broken into 5 segments, of each Kata that is required at each grade level. He also performs the Kata in two angles at regular speed before hand, and then there's a ""follow along"" segment following the instruction. Hodge-Sensei definitely makes sure that you understand the Kata before moving onto the next.

I'd also like to mention that if you need help, or have questions about the program, you can easily contact Hodge-Sensei or his son (Michael-Sensei) via their website. I've had several discussions with Michael-Sensei regarding the techniques, testing, and so on, and he has been nothing but helpful, supportive, and incredibly generous to me. This is not like a regular DVD set where you JUST buy the DVD and that's all the help you get. After buying the DVDs, you can register on their website and become a ""Distance Student"" (something I have yet to do), and receive help from Hodge-Sensei or Michael-Sensei. There's also another cool feature this program offers that no other DVD set does..

You can actually test, and get ranked, in the style (all the way up to the Black Belt Levels). You take a video of yourself performing the techniques, Kata, Kumite, and Self Defense for each grade level, and email it to them. Afterwards, they'll grade your video and send you your test results (you can also request the physical belts from them as well).
Also, you test when YOU are ready. It's not predetermined by anybody but how YOU think you are doing.

Overall, I will rank this video a 5 out of 5. The instructions are clear, precise, helpful, and very thorough. Their support system (aka your Senseis) are available to their students and are very helpful when you need them. And most of all, it's helped me regain something I thought I'd never have again. Usage in my leg. For that alone, I'm beyond grateful for this series.

Whether you are a beginner to Martial Arts, or an Advanced Student, this DVD set can benefit your training. I recommend to all Martial Artists interested in Shotokan Karate-Do, whether you take formal training in a Dojo or not. It can supplement anybody's training, you just actually have to do the training. But if you follow along and train diligently, you will receive results.

You just have to put the effort in to do the training.",1413417600,13,5544,4.648979591836735
6124226,5,B00GYI9AYY,"Wow!  I was more than impressed when I saw the quality of these DVD's on screen.  But what impressed me most was the method of delivery with which Sensei Jon Hodge so casually teaches by.  He verbally explains each move in detail and also provides visual demonstrations from a variety of angles making the moves very easy to comprehend.  It is obvious that he is a devoted master of Shotokan karate, and I am very excited to learn from this Sensei.",1411689600,5,448,4.493827160493828
6124227,5,B00GYI9AYY,I have not been in class in years. The clich you don't use you lose it is right. This dvd pack helps you find it again. The guidance is easy to follow and had me up to par within the 1st dvd. Awesome buy for the beginner to the advanced.,1410825600,3,237,3.76

6124229,5,B00GYI9AYY,"Sensei Hodge provides detailed instruction from multiple angles.  My e-mails have all been answered quickly.  The picture quality and production work of these DVD's is first rate.  Working rotating shifts has always made attending a brick and mortar dojo difficult so this course lets me practice as I have the time.  The forms require about a 10 x 10 foot area more or less.  You can earn belts up to black via video testing with each test costing a typical fee.  Blcak belt can be achieved at the time I'm writing this for  a total commitment of less than $600.  Spread that out over a few years and it really is affordable for everyone, especially if you don't have a dojo nearby.  The nearest Shotokan instruction for me is over 200 miles away.  Now I have a 5th degree black belt Sensei right in my own home.  I highly recommend this home study course.",1403913600,2,857,4.5

I am enjoying learning Shotokan karate through this process and I would encourage any person to purchase this program.  Very well made program in learning Shotokan karate.,1432857600,,362,5.101694915254237
6124235,5,B00GYI9AYY,"I'm a proponent of self-study and distance learning, so I was pleased to discover Complete Shotokan Karate's 8 DVD set.  I have taken good advantage of technology-enabled distance learning before, in subjects ranging from graduate engineering studies to personal fitness.  From my experience, I know that self-study is not for everyone, and that one gets out of this sort of training no more than one is willing to put in.  I have been a traditional, in-class student of several styles of martial arts, including Shotokan and related styles of Karate.  I had the advantage while serving in the military to work out in a related style in Japan with Japanese police and members of the Maritime Self Defense Force.  Which is to say, I'm reasonably qualified to judge ""authenticity"" in the art.  As I have begun to review Sensei Hodge's instructional DVDs, I've been fully satisfied by the clear, well-explained lessons he presents. On small matters of technique, I've found both Sensei and his instructor son Michael to be very accessible.  I have emailed them and received same-day replies, and on questions regarding peculiarities of hand positioning or foot movement, the Hodges have been understanding.  Like me, their backgrounds include Chinese, Korean, and Japanese martial arts.  With only a cursory reading of the history behind any of these arts, one realizes that ""traditional"" styles have long been influenced by practical techniques discovered as students moved on from master to master.  In an earlier review, someone posted that the material in this course was ""not Shotokan.""  So far, as I've reviewed the instructional material, I must disagree.  I can state with confidence that if a student had learned fundamentals from live instruction, they would find working with this DVD set very easy to do.  For those who have not had the advantage of live instruction, I think that Sensei Hodge's training is well enough designed that the student could become proficient as long as they were willing to put in time and serious effort to their training.  For students with no prior history in martial arts, finding additional references for learning proper martial arts stretching, conditioning, breathing and meditation techniques is a must.  Also, practicing in a controlled manner with a training partner at home will improve a student's understanding of the lessons on the DVDs.  Even without a training partner--practicing solo--there is a lifetime's worth of material in this DVD course to guide self-improvement.",1430956800,9,2526,5.215346534653466
6124236,1,B00GYI9AYY,"Being called Complete Shotokan is misleading. This is very different from real Shotokan. I realize the Hodge Do Karate Shotokan derivative thing is to explain that, but your DVD's are not titled complete Hodge Do Karate, or even Ultimate Karate as they used to be. It appears you added Shotokan as a buzz word to attract more buyers. It is obvious that these videos and your training is more in some type of Moo Duk Kwan. Your testing prices are ridiculous in comparison to other DVD courses, and then you went and raised the price some more? Online McDojo. Even your dobok is Korean trimmed. Why don't you be more honest and call this Complete Moo Duk Kwan, Tang Soo Do, or non WTF Tae Kwon Do not Shotokan.",1430092800,5,708,4.496124031007752
6124237,4,B00GYI9AYY,"Best karate home study course period. Production,instruction and explanation is excellent very easy to follow. And instructors are easy to contact and will answer you promptly if you have any questions or concerns.",1429747200,,214,5.515151515151516
6124238,5,B00GYI9AYY,"Coming from several years of martial arts study, and a black belt in Tae-Kwon-Do and Hapkido, I cannot recommend this at-home program enough. The DVD's are well structured and easy to navigate. The picture and sound quality are clearly professional and well done. The instructors are professional, clear and detailed in their instruction.

If you are thinking that you can't learn a martial art at home, think again! This program is structured in such a way that with hard work and dedication you can succeed in learning a martial art on your own. Best of all, you can earn actual rank through the unique method of belt testing through video submission with feedback from your instructor.

Thank you to Jon and his team for putting together such a quality product and training program.",1429056000,3,785,4.894736842105263

If you go on the internet you will find information on Shotokan for free and save your $99.00. I looked up the Lineage and all of the members are Chung Do Kwan/ Tae kwon do Style.
