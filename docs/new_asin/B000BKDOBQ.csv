8087918,1,B000BKDOBQ,"I wanted to buy this but the show has 78 episodes not 56 as one reviewer says.
So its not a complete saga. If it had the complete 78 episodes then good but its not even stated what episodes are included in the box set. For the mandarin version 13 discs make up the complete saga. So I don't believe 7 discs can be a  complete saga.

8087919,1,B000BKDOBQ,"The box set only goes through half the episodes. English subs are only done through ep 56. I cannot locate the ending ep 57-60... great story, but you will never know how it ends! A total waste of four days watching! SIGH!",1288569600,2,222,4.309523809523809

Initially, the incorrect order was filled, but the seller made an immediate and satisfactory correct fulfilment to the order.  I ordered this item for my nephew and he is very pleased with it therefore I am very pleased.  Thank you for your CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.",1227398400,,319,5.096153846153846
8087921,2,B000BKDOBQ,"Bleck, Horrible. The drawings aren't that great and the English voices are  horrible. Dragon Girl [Xiao Long Nu] sounds like a 35 year old with an English accent and Yang Guo [Yang Gor] sounds like and idiot. I couldn't even finish this because it was so bad but I heard that Yang Guo dies at the end. THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IN THE BOOK OR ANY OF THE VERSIONS WITH REAL PEOPLE!!! SPOILER: What happens is that Yang Guo and Dragon Girl are both poisoned. Yang Guo can be cured but Dragon can't. Knowing that Yang Guo will kill himself [not except antidote or just stab himself] she sneaks off one night,  carves a note that says meet me here in 16 years and jumps off the Heartless Valley Cliff.  The next day Yang Guo sees the note it reads; To my husband Yang Guo. The love between us husband and wife is extremely great. Meet me here in sixteen years. Do not break your promise. Dragon hoped that Yang Guo would believe she was alive and after 16 years when he found out she was dead he would not kill himself. Yang Guo is hind of skeptical that she is still alive so Huang Rong, Gwok Jin [Guo Jing], lies and  says that she must have been taken by the South Sea Magic Nun and will meet him in 16 years. He waits 16 years and she doesn't show up for their reunion so he jumps off the cliff. He falls in to water. He comes to an underground cave where he meets Dragon who had some how survived and they go back to fight the Mongolians. They help Guo Jing and save his youngest daughter Xiang. Yang Guo becomes one of the new five greats along with Old Naughty Boy and Guo Jing. Then Yang Guo and Dragon go off to live peacefully in seclusion and are never seen again. Trust me I've read the book twice. [...].",1206230400,,1708,4.166666666666667
8087922,4,B000BKDOBQ,"This anime is based on a famous Chinese martial arts novel of the same name, second in a trilogy.  I understand the criticism of the opened ended conclusion as one of the reviewers wrote.  'Never fear', the second half of the story is currently being shown in Hong Kong.  It continues from where this particular set of DVD finishes.  If it follows the novel, the ending will be clear and not disappointing to most followers of the series.  As far as this particular production is concerned, the anime is well drawn, and the story is reasonably close to the original novel.  The only slight disappointment is the action sequence, which does not match the martial arts skill of Jet Li or Jackie Chan.",1200096000,2,698,4.634146341463414
8087923,5,B000BKDOBQ,"Overall, Legend of the Condor Hero box set one (English/anime) is excellent. I just wish that the second and third set comes out in English soon so that I can buy it. And I do mean set, the complete set.",1173312000,,203,4.1
8087924,3,B000BKDOBQ,"I mostly enjoyed this anime.  The other reviewer has given it a glowing review, however, so I thought I should point out a couple problems I had.  First off, the animation quality is very poor.  If the set cost $45, it would bother me less, or if the story were properly finished, which brings me to my other major problem.  Nothing is developed and the last little story arc is just bad.  26 episodes contains approximately 6 mini story arcs (4-8 depending on how you count) and covers some ten years, which means things are jumpy and short.  Which could still be okay except for the end.

(Semi-spoiler warning...)  I don't mind endings that are not ""happily ever after,"" and I don't mind open endings, but after the preceeding mini arc ends there is a huge disconnect in mood and the final arc is, well, not good.  I realize it is based on a Chinese story (legend?), and I'm not advocating changing the story, but the characters who are opposed to our fated couple are overly evil and completely non-sympathetic, even the ""good"" among them.  It's as though the writers decided only one character should have either passion or common sense (okay the daughter does too, but she is inefective).

Again, I did enjoy watching most of the series, but I feel that the last arc detracts immensely and the animation quality is poor.  See it if you like, but don't pay full price.",1156982400,,1373,4.581967213114754
8087925,5,B000BKDOBQ,"I first saw this while in China, and I spent a half year looking for it. The story goes that there is this orphaned boy who gets trained in a martial arts form.  Sounds lame, only the martial arts is more like magic than any tae kwon do or whatever.  Eventually he falls in love with his trainer, only due to misunderstandings, she leaves him.  When he meets her in the end, she has amnesia, and doesn't recover her memory until they both contract a slow-acting flower poison. Old-fashion cliffhangers, martials action, and heavy plot make this a winner, even though I couldn't understand a word (I could follow it easily by the action).",1145232000,4,637,4.5701754385964914
