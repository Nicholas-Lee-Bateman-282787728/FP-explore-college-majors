5317303,5,B009D4GTD6,"This story was one of my son's favorites and
 he shared it with a group of friends who really enjoyed his version. I home schooled him and think this was one reason he became so interested in the major he chose when going to college, English writing.  Clean funny is a good thing.",1405209600,,280,4.264150943396227
5317304,4,B009D4GTD6,"As narrator of this foolish tale, Robin Williams with a Yiddish accent and Yiddish expressions is perfect! Fanciful images filled with bright colors illustrate the humor to be found with this story of a fool and his traveling companions. The lesson to be learned? Only that a fool with talented  friends can still marry a princess . . . and she will just have to get used to it!

Foolish humor that has parental approval and is recommended by my grandchildren . . . foolish fun from Rabbit Ears!",1405036800,5,495,4.550561797752809
8539921,5,B009D4GTD6,"Way, way back when I was a wee child, I used to watch this unusual yet hilarious little video from Rabbit Ears Productions called ""The Fool and the Flying Ship.""  I remembered I used to watch this video OVER and OVER again (until the day I accidentally broke the tape...SAD SIGHING) and ever since then, I have been waiting for the moment for this beloved video to get its own DVD release.  Well....that day has FINALLY COME!!!

I must admit that I was quite impressed with how well this DVD turned out as I now have a way to re watch this favorite classic of mine OVER and OVER again!  Everything in this DVD just screams out MAGNIFICENT and HILARIOUS to me as Robin Williams' narration was both hilarious and creative as I loved the way that he gave each character a distinctive voice.  I also LOVED the music from the Klezmer Conservatory Band as they added in the perfect Russian tones to the music and I also LOVED the artwork by Henrik Drescher as the characters look both bizarre yet hilarious at the same time.  Now, I will admit that some of the artwork might be a tad bit too scary for some viewers (especially the appearances of the Eater and the Sharpshooter), but all in all, ""The Fool and the Flying Ship"" was DEFINITELY worth the thousand year long wait to get on DVD and anyone who is a huge fan of Robin Williams' works, Russian folktales and hilarious stories will definitely get a KICK out of this DVD!",1522540800,,1421,4.425287356321839

8539924,4,B009D4GTD6,"A cute Russian folktale, narrated by none other than the master of voices, Robin Williams. He adds the extra spark to the story, and makes it enjoyable.  The illustrations weren't my favorite, but it makes a great audio book!",1439856000,,225,4.769230769230769
8539925,5,B009D4GTD6,"I saw this many years ago when my son was very young.  My boss at the time had found it, and recommended it.  Recently, I was reminiscing on Robin William's incredible body of work, and decided to look this up.  I couldn't believe that it was free with my Prime membership!

Silly fun with a Eastern European flair, William's colorful voice characterization is perfectly matched.  The artwork is brilliantly simplistic, and the limited animation helps pull this all together for a simple, enjoyable story-time experience.

If you have young children (or you're a young child at heart), please don't pass this up.  It's a hidden gem that you will not forget anytime too soon.

I didn't, even after nearly 25 years.",1435017600,,713,4.8347107438016526

8539928,5,B009D4GTD6,"I wasn't sure whether I would like this when I first saw it, but it is absolutely brilliant.  Robin Williams' narration is excellent and totally hilarious.  I can't believe I haven't heard of this before.  The animation / art is interestingly weird and unrefined, but the storytelling is perfect and was highly entertaining.",1420848000,2,324,5.0754716981132075
