8708101,1,B00USBLXJ8,Weird and not in a good way,1464652800,,27,3.0
8708102,1,B00USBLXJ8,"On the positive side:  beautiful locations.  The dancers during the dance sequences were good.  In the negative column: pretty much everything else.  I have watched Willem Dafoe in movies before and found him effective. There was something so unconnected emotionally in the actors.  No life in this movie. I'm not sure how it went wrong, but it went wrong. If that was supposed to be the point, I think it needed to show a contrast to make that point.",1461542400,,451,4.658227848101266
8708103,3,B00USBLXJ8,"It was a bit confusing, though that might be more on me than the film. I'm a big fan of anything with Weixler in it. The timeline was long enough for her character to arc, which she pulled off very well.",1458518400,,203,3.975609756097561

8708107,5,B00USBLXJ8,"Great movie, but William Dafoe missbehaves nicely.",1442102400,,50,6.285714285714286
8708108,1,B00USBLXJ8,Lousy story with poorly drawn characters. A waste of time. Not even the Italian scenery was good.,1441152000,,97,4.764705882352941
