7276277,4,B00ZE1JXV2,"The taste is fine.  Decades ago I started taking protein powder and adding it to water, milk, or juice from a ""new"" store called GNC.  Those powders were not flavored like they are today but I easily got over it.  This product, believe it or not, tasted a little like those powders along with the taste of grass.  As a kid I used to mow the lawn, and occasionally, I would end up tasting the grass I was mowing because very fine cuts ended up floating in the still air all around me and getting in my nose, mouth, sticking to my clothes...  Seriously, the taste is just fine, I usually only take it with less than one cup of cold water and it mixes well with a spoon.  If I didn't stir it well enough, I add more water to the empty cup, swirl it around and drink it down.  This product is a very fine powder and even though I'm not a messy person, I always find small green spots on my counter and green residue on my fingers no matter how careful I try to be.  The very first time I opened the plastic canister, I noticed there was product all over the interior of the canister.  Right away I thought condensation had somehow formed inside and the powder was sticking to it.  After handling the scoop, it looked like the powder was flying to the inside of the walls because of static electricity.  It's not a real problem as a wet paper towel quickly cleans up the little residue on the counter and from my fingers from handling the enclosed scoop.  The product quickly made me feel a little more energetic, cleared my thinking just a tad, and, tah-dah, I started waking up with erections again.  I won't tell you how old I am, but I'm getting up there in years.  Besides the residue issue, I'd like to see lower pricing and perhaps not just wheat grass, but maybe wheatgrass with chlorella or any number of other green foods in a ""complete"" super green foods product.  As much as I like this product and will probably continue to use it, I'll also be trying other products to see if I find anything I like better.  I believe we all need to individually find what works best for each of us.
I give this a rock solid four stars and maybe a little extra.",1485993600,,2153,4.253071253071253

7276282,4,B00ZE1JXV2,"The very first of the ""Open Season"" movies will go down I n history (maybe I exaggerate just a bit) as a wonderfully funny movie but I will never slight the rest of this series as I have enjoyed them all a lot. The third one which seems to settle on Boog going off because he thinks no one needs him was a bit of a strain for me, I was a bit bored but still enjoyed it. Great family fun for all.",1481760000,,395,3.7710843373493974
