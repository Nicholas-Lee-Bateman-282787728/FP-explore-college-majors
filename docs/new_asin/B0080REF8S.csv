8657909,5,B0080REF8S,"The DVD is what another reviewer had said - It is the last half of the series, from episodes 61-94. It is in Chinese or Japanese with English or Chinese subtitles but some of the English subtitles are wrong. Otherwise, there is nothing wrong with the DVDs.",1462665600,,256,4.468085106382978
8657910,5,B0080REF8S,"I ordered this thinking it was in english.  A little disappointed that the japanese only audio was not listed anywhere for this item,  just the region code which is Code 1.  Also this is for episodes 61 and up which was also not noted for this product. There is nothing wrong with the product whatsoever. The artwork on the box (which is made very well) is beautiful and the dvd quality is good.  The only flaw with this item is that critical info is missing from the description.  I hope this helps someone looking to buy this item.",1399420800,,533,4.3979591836734695
