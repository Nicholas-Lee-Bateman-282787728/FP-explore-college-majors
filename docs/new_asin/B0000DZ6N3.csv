I thought that Britney Murphy did a wonderful job of acting with Dakota Fanning in this. Dakota also did a really good job of portraying a bratty kid. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a fun loving, caring, comedy! Props to this movie!!",1071878400,,408,4.049382716049383
1928737,5,B0000DZ6N3,This was my favorite movie of 2003...in fact it was one of the better movies I have seen in a long time! This movie made me cry and laugh and just wanna hug my girlfriends!

1928738,3,B0000DZ6N3,"This movie directed by Boaz Yakin (Fresh, Remember The Titans) has a certain charm to it. It was going for the warm fuzzy's and along the way found a real heart for me.
Cocky and not-so-bright Britney Murphy (Just Married, 8-Mile) plays a aristocratic well to do teen who suddenly looses what she ahs to find out she needs to get a real job. In her attempt she is befriended by a mother played by Heather Locklear (Looney Toons Back In Action, The First Wives Club) who needs a caretaker - babysitter for her young daughter played by Dakota Fanning (I Am Sam, The Cat In The Hat).
The two teach each other a valuable lesson about life. One - Brittany needs to lean how to grow up, the other - Dakota - needs how to learn to have fun. The two are forced to tolerate each other in order to appease the mother. However, in the process of hating each other, they learn a lesion in family friendship and that people are not what they seem to be on the outside.
That's the warm fuzzy! Really nice heart - it does get a little slow in parts, but the chemistry of little Dakota with everyone on screen is amazing. You can't help not liking her even after she plays this temperamental little brat.
As far as the theatrical experience, a good film for the teens and young adults but it is not really for the really young or middle aged crowd - it does have a syrupy side that may give some a tooth ache. This would be a great DVD to have for the family. Let me know what you think. (11-12-03)",1068595200,2,1482,4.221830985915493
1928739,4,B0000DZ6N3,"The plot of ""Uptown Girls"" revolves around a rich daughter of a dead rock star named Molly *Brittany Murphy"" who gets scanned out of her inheritance so she must get a job taking care of the bratty daughter of a record exec. The acting in thsi film is actually very good and the little girl did a great job. Brittany Murphy is amusing onscreen as she usually is. The movie is lighthearted as a whole until towards the end when the predictable ending doesn't come into play and tragedy is introduced instead. Very sad.

It was amazing, sad, and beautiful. I especailly loved the little girl, Ray. She was so cute, and the way she acted so grown up, it was so funny! But my favourite character was Molly. I loved how she was so carefree and didn't care what anyone thought of her, it was exactly how I wish I could be. My favourite part of the whole movie was the end.

1928782,5,B0000DZ6N3,"One of the cutest movies ever.  Young Britney Murphy and still a child Dakota Fanning.

 Now Dakota is all grown up, and Britney Murphy is dead.  Very strange how Britney died, then her husband shortly after.  They must have known too much about something in liberal Hollywood.",1523577600,,277,4.808510638297872
1928783,4,B0000DZ6N3,"RELEASED IN 2003 and directed by Boaz Yakin, ""Uptown Girls"" is a dramedy with a little romance about Molly (Brittany Murphy), a fun-loving 22 year-old who suddenly loses her inherited riches and is forced to become a nanny to a stoical neat-freak girl, Ray (Dakota Fanning). Heather Locklear plays Rays distant mother whos an exec in the music biz while Jesse Spencer plays a hunky musician who gets signed. Marley Shelton and Donald Faison are on hand as friends of Molly.

The first act didn't do much for me, but at the halfway point something made me bust out laughing and I busted out four more times before it was over. More importantly, the movie is rich with quality mind/spirit food. Both Molly and Ray are broken people who handle their grief in opposite ways. And each has what the other needs to heal and escape their disorder.

Uptown Girls boldly reveals that meds (drugs) cannot heal or deliver a person; the best they can do is help a person cope. In fact, they usually have negative side-effects, mentally and physically. Sadly, six years after the release of the film Murphy ironically died of cardiac arrest due to inadvertent overdoses of a mixture of over-the-counter & prescription drugs taken (they presume) for a respiratory infection. She was only 32.

The flick encourages growing up and achieving true success through (1.) recognizing golden connections and taking advantage of them (after all, no one makes it alone, no one; they had help); and (2.) discerning and cultivating ones special talent(s). Id say more, but its better to see the movie, enjoy it, and quarry the gems for oneself.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 32 minutes and was shot in New York City (Manhattan & Brooklyn with studio work done in Queens). WRITERS: Julia Dahl, Mo Ogrodnik & Lisa Davidowitz wrote the script based on Allison Jacobs story.

1928809,4,B0000DZ6N3,"Let me first preface this review by stating that I went to the same university as the best film critic of all time Mr. Roger Ebert. While he may be way smarter and wittier than me, I have one of the greatest films of our generation to review  Uptown Girls. So here goes nothing.

I would also just state straight away that this is not to be compared to the classic Material Girls. These are two completely different movies that are based off the same basic principle  rich girls lose their privilege and are forced to adapt and figure out a way to live. But while Hilary and Hailey Duff have each other to rely on, Brittany Murphys character (the troubled daughter of a rock star), has to rely purely on her own instincts and wit. What could possibly go wrong with this combination?

This movie was made when Brittany Murphy was in her highest. And Im not talking about her drug usage. I think shes an excellent fit for this role. She lives life to the ultimate gluttonous extreme before losing it all. Totally nowhere near her real life. She turns in such a respectable job during this film that Im sad we are deprived of her future artwork. I much prefer her alive than dead.

As Miss Murphys character loses her family fortune, she is forced to get a real job as she is in severe debt and cant pay her bills. Shes just like every other millennial! So as she is battling the normal stressors of trying to find her Mr. Right, she takes the job of a nanny for an 8-year-old girl played by Dakota Fanning.

Their relationship results in hijinks. They have the chemistry of a pair of real-life sisters. I mean, not like the Duffs, but its pretty good. I credit most of it to a young Fannings acting and charm. You can see why she ended up blossoming into a fine actress.

The mom of this 8-year-old is played by the ageless Heather Locklear. She is very hot. I cant believe she hasn't aged at all. That is all.

Most of the hijinks caused through this movie are largely based of Miss Murphys own actions. While protagonists in other movies are largely reactionary to their surroundings, most of the incidents that involve Miss Murphy are through her own fault. Its essentially a one-man Three Stooges routine. Sounds like just about every day of my life!

Its a wonderful contrast to Ms. Fannings character, who is a tightwad pain-in-the-butt child. You see, almost all children are much simpler to care for. You either instill discipline in them from an early age to make them compliant, or you bribe the hell out of them to just make the headaches go away. Given Miss Murphys current financial state and gross ineptitude to break down a complex situation, she is forced to go along for Fannings organized, orderly ride as Fanning is clearly the dominant one in their forced relationship. Kind of like me and my moms old Chihuahua.

There are many bumps along that ride.

May favorite line is an early one.

Murphy asks, Kid, have you ever been to a shrink?

Fanning replies, Since I was three.

That elicited a hearty laugh. DID YOU CHUCKLE AS MUCH AS I DID?

Later, Murphy takes Fanning to an amusement park. She almost immediately loses track of her. How about that gross negligence!?!? Oh boy, you cant help but laugh at her irresponsibility. Thank goodness New York is such a safe city where nothing bad ever happens. Just like Chicago.

So Murphy basically has the maturity of a child in a 22-year-olds body while Fanning is anal and uptight beyond her 8 years. But if youve read this much of the review, I guess I cant really talk.

Throughout the movie, Murphy also has a strange connection to Egyptian Cotton sheets. Her theory is that a man simply cannot resist a 900 thread-count pair of sheets. That one will essentially become a freak in the sheets because of the sheets.

I can tell you from my experience, the smoothness in the sheets is the least Ive considered.

But you have to give her props for trying. These references to Egyptian cotton sheets often seem forced, but it is a fair way to think about late 90s and early 2000s music. I mean, remember how Creeds Higher was a hit. But shoot, maybe that would have been a good song for Murphy as well.

In watching this movie, I quickly came to a few realizations. This is not a movie about plot. This is not meant to tell a story. The story that is told has been one that has been recited the last couple hundred years. Its like trying to find a different way to make an apple pie. Thats a bad idea.

But a movie need not be about a plot. It can be about relationships. And I did enjoy the dynamic between Murphy and Fanning. This is when Fanning was at her cutest and Murphy at her clumsiest. But even with that being said, there is a greater purpose of this film.

What, is that, you ask?

This film was about Egyptian Cotton sheets. Its plain and simple There references throughout were obvious. The real winners from this movie were not the ones that produced it or Murphy, but rather JC Pennys and Macys. I have learned more about bed sheets from this movie than I have in all my nearly 28 years on earth. I immediately felt the urge to go on amazon after this movie to upgrade my king sheets.

Maybe I will one day be as lucky as her because of them.",1512172800,4,5223,4.422314911366006

1928836,5,B0000DZ6N3,"I love this movie, as in, I can watch it every couple years. I remember when I first saw a trailer for it when it was coming out I thought it looked like a comedy, but one I might like. It was, i think, I remember when I watched it I was surprised to find that I wouldn't really classify it as a comedy at all (I swear the trailer was marketing it as one.) But rather I'd classify it as a heartwarming, sometimes tearjerking, drama. And that's OK by mot e!! I LOVE heartwarming dramas. And if a movie can make me cry (NOT an easy thing.. My friends have often commented about that with me..) it is likely to quickly move up to my favorites list.

The tagline to this used to be ""They're about to teach each other how to act their age."" sums up the movie really well. Heartwarming, well done, it will make you smile, maybe laugh a couple times, cry, and feel all kind of things.  Dakota Fanning (Even from a young age) was one of those old souls who will leave you breathless with her skill as an actress at the age of only 9. (Or even 7.. watch ""I am Sam"" and tell me she didn't deserve an oscar at 7 years old.) She's just amazing, though it stands out more at that age than it does with her recent work.
Brittany Murphy (RIP) did a great job with her character, evoking sympathy (being raised as a princess really isn't her fault that she doesn't have a realistic view of the world!)  Just a great all-around movie! I just re-watched I am Sam and I'm about to rewatch this (for about the 8th time)",1500768000,4,1499,4.126712328767123

1928913,5,B0000DZ6N3,"NOTE: I am completely baffled by the back cover (see image) - it says this movie is rated R. As far as I can tell, this disc is the theatrical release, which was rated PG-13, the DVD was PG-13, the British DVD release is ages 12 and up, the German DVD release is General Audiences (Ages 0 and up). Content wise, there is a sex scene (With no sex and no nudity shown), a guy takes off his shirt, a little girl flips the bird a few times, some MILD cussing (As in OMG), and there is a suicide attempt. Its safely PG-13, and I imagine Olive just slapped the wrong rating graphic on the back of the case.

MOVIE: I am not going to go into a lot of detail on the plot of the movie - the movie is now 13 years old, and I would assume that most people interested in this release have seen the movie. This was the first movie I ever saw that had Dakota Fanning in it - I walked into the movie because I was a Brittnay Murphy fan, walked out a Dakota Fanning fan.

Brief plot recap - Dakota Fanning plays Ray. He father is dying and on life support in the family's home, mom is a record producer or music promoter or something (as many times as I have seen it, I don't think I have ever picked up on exactly what it is, I think she says in the movie, but its background information). Her job is important to the movie, but the title isn't. Anyways, mom is gone a lot, which means she needs a nanny. And to cope with everything going on around her, Ray has had to grow up fast, and take on the role of parent.

Molly is a daughter of a rock star whose parents died tragicly when she was young. Her parents had a trust fund setup to pretty much let her live ""as a princess"". Until one day, her manager steals all of her money and disappears. Molly now must work for the first time in her life and deal with the real world. With zero experience and a carefree attitude, she has trouble coping with regular jobs, and becomes Nanny to Ray. Now, Ray must teach Molly how to act like an adult, and Molly must teach Ray how to act like a kid and have fun.

Oh, and there is a side story about a boyfriend musician.

Dakota Fanning and Brittnay Murphy were perfect for their roles, as Britney has kind of a carefree attitude, and Dakota has always been a professional, allowing her to play roles well beyond her age.

This is a feel good movie, and a guilty pleasure of mine (and I am a guy).

VIDEO: This is the first time this movie has been released on Blu-Ray. Before now, you had to settle with HDTV broadcasts and VOD. Both seemed to use an old transfer that, while decent, had issues with black crush and macroblocking (there are a lot of nighttime and dark interior shots in this film). While I am not sure, this DOES appear to be a new transfer, at least in my eyes, and I am watching on a 115"" screen. Colors are natural, skin tones are correct, black levels are good, night scenes are detailed, contrast levels are good. The movie has a good layer of film grain and it does not appear that DNR has been applied. I did not see any halos around anything or compression artifacts, which suggest that no edge enhancement was used. Picture is nice and sharp. The reason I am not giving it a 5 is I would have liked it to have been just a tad sharper, and the film grain can be a bit distracting - In fact, the grain seems to be a bit high for a film from this era, and am not convinced it is artistic intent, and am wondering if they scanned a second or third generation copy rather than the negatives. Still, everything looks great.

AUDIO: This comes with a DTS soundtrack (that is what is on the case - I will need to double check if its MA). The audio is good, and handles the soundtrack of the movie well, and I have no complaints. It should be pointed out that like most movies of this style, the movie does not have that aggressive of a sound field. The 3 for audio is because this is an average soundtrack for this movie. It does not appear to have any additional languages, at least none that can be accessed via a menu. I will have to sit down with it and see if any other audio tracks or subtitle tracks can be accessed via the remote buttons.

Special Features: Pretty bland - a music video, trailer, deleted scenes, and some bonus feature that all look like they were shot in SD. The quality on all of these was poor, so I really did not watch much of any of them.

Overall - Considering this is a catalogue, non-anniversary Blu-Ray release of a movie that has previously not been available, I am pretty impressed - the video quality is excellent, the sound is good, and there are some bonus features (although nothing to really be impressed about). Overall, it is a good release, and a great price at $14",1461628800,4,4706,4.167216721672167

1928979,5,B0000DZ6N3,"Due to parental mistakes, negligence, and other societal influences, our characters have already traded places before this movie even begins. There is no magic, the child was forced to become an adult because her parents were unable to do so. Ray Schleine is eight, but has never learned to be a child. Meanwhile, Molly Gunn is an adult orphan who never learned how to be an adult.

They have much in common, but they will learn much more from each other. Ray teaches Molly how to be an adult (by learning to break away from her past), while Molly helps Ray learn to be a child (by learning to embrace and respect the details that she has been trying to forget).

It did seem to get very slow in the middle. I even thought of quitting in the middle. I took a break, then finished the movie the next day. This helped me realize that ""Uptown Girls"" was a much better movie. Perhaps my 24-hour break helped me appreciate  that the characters had to take a break from their pasts in order to embrace their new futures, moving from child-employer with adult-employee to good friends.

I highly recommend this movie.",1435363200,,1110,4.535

Brittany murphy needs to convince us that she is an interesting character but she cant really pull it off because she has the emotional range of a ferret on crack. Dakota Fanning does an OK job but when your relying on an 8 year old to hold up an entire movie, well thats not a recipe for success.

I think he is amazing at conveying the feeling of almost schizophrenic panic that comes in a great action flick - but this movie was filled with cliche camera action, and whereas the scene by scene acting was good - it was disjoined, as if the actors had no clue how their character should develop.

She is always, it seems, the doe-eyed dope who gets taken for a ride, lives to regret it and then turns things around to her advantage. On the other hand, I have seen two of her films recently which I enjoyed thoroughly. Uptown Girls is one of them. Her partner in the story is the talented young Dakota Fanning, who is foil to Brittany's character's (Molly) general goofiness.

This is a story of two lost girls; one who is grown up and the other just wants to be a kid. How the two resolve their life issues, how they break through each others barriers, how they fight with the world around them becomes compelling. This gets three stars, because we know the story ending nearly from the beginning, but the story is told in a sweet, thoughtful and humorous manner.

However, for a 5 star, it would need to be a movie I'd sit down and watch at least twice in a 30 day period after the first time I saw it.  And once or twice a year after that.
Yes, it could have definitely been better, but with the audience it's aimed at, it was satisfactory.  Watch it as a family, with young ones included, and their laughter and enjoyment will be all that's needed for your enjoyment.
The girl obviously never has fun, despite claiming that her ballet is fun, never smiles, almost robotic in emotions.  Parents aloof and seldom seen.

Reminded me of why Brittany Murphy (of ""Clueless"" fame) was designated as a very strong talent during that era.  I would recommend to young female (older) tweens (because of sex/bed situation) through late teens.  Not much older than that. Younger crowd would lose track of story regarding the importance of her guitar collection.",1403740800,,533,4.966292134831461

1929541,4,B0000DZ6N3,"`Uptown Girls' is one of those films that comes along with all the clichs and the generic formulaic unraveling of every other film coming out at the same time and yet it has something special, something extra, that makes it so much more inviting than expected.  That is the wonderful combination of Brittany Murphy (so sad she's left us) and Dakota Fanning.  Fanning is a delight in her `too mature for her own good' role as Ray, a humorless young girl who needs a nanny because her mother has no time for her.  Murphy also shines as Molly, an heiress reluctant to work for herself yet forced to do so when she loses her fortune.  Together they learn from one another (obviously) and build such a heartwarming finale, which was unexpected.  Sure, it isn't the perfect film, but it has enough charm and heart to make it well worthwhile.  Fanning has the chops to deliver the funny (this girl was the epitome of perfect child star) and she plays off of Murphy with ease.  She is easily the best thing about this film, but that isn't taking anything away from Murphy, who is top notch as well.  The film really pulls it out in the conclusion, which takes away from the generic effect the film has, and gives us something to smile about.",1357257600,,1233,4.497757847533633

1929561,5,B0000DZ6N3,"My exposure to Brittany Murphy until recently was her voice work as Luanne on ""King of the Hill"" and her appearance in ""8 Mile"" with Eminem.  I saw her in ""Just Married"" with Ashton Kutcher and was impressed which led me to this film.  I thought it was a comedy instead it's a drama with comedic elements.  Essentially it's the story of two wounded souls who need each other despite their reluctance.  Molly (Murphy) is twenty-two year old rock 'n' roll royalty who compensates for the loss of her parents with impulsive and erratic behavior. Ray(Dakota Fanning) is an eight year old girl who tries to act years beyond her age to assuage the hurt caused by an absentee mother and comatose father.  Both Molly and Ray harbor some form of OCD.  For Molly it's a hoarders mentality and for Ray there's an obsession with order and cleanliness.  Circumstance brings the two together and some would say the movie is somewhat contrived.  In the hands of these pro actresses, however, the situation is both believable and touching.  ""Uptown Girls"" is poignant and funny and suggests the emerging talent of Fanning and the tragedy in the loss of an actress of Murphy's calibre.",1301011200,,1168,4.742574257425742

Ms. Murphy, Dakota Fanning & a very underused Heather Locklear give fine performances, but the film suffers from cliches, a contrived (and unreal) ending and even worse deleted scenes (sans director commentary. It should have had a better ending (ie. the mother realizing she spent too much time at work and re-connecting with her daughter, the idiot guy realizing that Molly was right for him and Molly finding fulfillment in caring for the little girl).

An accountant steals all her money and suddenly this unskilled party girl needs to get a job. She gets one at last as nanny to Dakota Fanning, a stern nine year old who behaves as if she were a ninety year old spinster. Brittany and Dakota go through the contest of wills stuff; Brittany falls for an up and coming rock 'n roller (actually more a balladeer); girl meets boy, girl loses boy, boy sleeps with girl's employer - you get the picture. Actually the movie holds together only because everyone knows everyone else from being the music business.

  The movie is pure schmaltz. The storyline is weak. But even so, the director builds the story between Brittany and Dakota and it ends as a real coming of age and girl story. Not many dry eyes in the house at the end of this one. Not art - just fun.

In her usual fashion, Dakota Fanning gives an outstanding performance, with an aptitude for acting well beyond her years.  Ray and Molly's disparate personalities result in many clashes, but eventually they teach each other how to act their age - a very important life lesson.",1168473600,6,607,4.7075471698113205

She plays the part of a brat perfectly and that brat is tamed over time by Brittany when she becomes her nanny.

It's a cutesy movie that is lighthearted yet also sometimes a little moving.  I do like these kind of movies where one character can change another for the better.

1929584,4,B0000DZ6N3,"Brittany Murphy, Dakota Fanning and a pig called Mu star in the curious comedy ""Uptown Girls"", directed by Boaz Yakin. It's a bit of a mixed bag, I thought. There were parts I liked, parts I hated, parts I was intrigued by, and parts that just left me baffled. Overall, I liked it though.

Molly (Brittany Murphy), is the daughter of a late rock star, and lives off his wealth, in decadence, within a large apartment, along with her pet pig Mu. She is fairly superficial, as are her friends, and Molly's rather childish too. Sometime after her 22nd birthday, her late father's manager runs off with all the money she'd been living from, leaving her with nothing. She is kicked out of her apartment and has to find a job. She ends up becoming a nanny to ""Ray"" (Dakota Fanning), an uptight, smart alecy, germophobe of a little girl, the daughter of a wealthy record executive. They are certainly an odd couple, and some comic scenes follow, but its not all laughs. As the two girls spend time together, there are many a touching and dramatic moment as they realise they have a lot in common, both being a little eccentric, both being the daughters of wealthy families, and both having certain tragedies in their lives they're yet to cope with.

I wouldn't exactly call this a straight ahead comedy. Though there is a love interest for Molly as well, a Morrissey-esque rock singer (Jesse Spencer) she meets at her birthday party, I wouldn't call this a romantic comedy either, as this fellow isn't the main focus of the film, and their relationship isn't exactly conventional. Neither of them really seem interested in each other, yet they come together, on again off again. The whole film was just this kaleidescope of elements, tumbling around within the plot.

Though I was a little put off at first, I found this film fascinating. It was interesting to see characters first potrayed as parodies show a depth later on, while characters who seemed more three dimensional later showed a shallower side. No one here was exactly a carciature, but no one again was exactly completely real. It was a refreshing mix of the two, and I think they all pulled it off fairly well.

Special features include a quite large selection of deleted and alternate scenes, including a sex scene or two for some reason, as well as a behind the scenes featurette with interviews with the actors and director Boaz Yakin, a featurette about the fashion of the film, a montage of stills, the original movie trailer and a music video for ""Time"" by Chantal Kreviazuk, which looks pretty standard for a movie soundtrack music video (shots of singer singing interdispersed with footage from the film, etc). I would have preferred to see a music video for the songs Jesse Spencer's rock singer character sings, I quite liked those, they were funny and catchy, one of my favorite parts of the film.

An intriguing comedy, got me thinking by the end of it. Worth a look.",1151798400,8,2937,4.695145631067962

1929601,5,B0000DZ6N3,"Twenty-five years after the film ""Times Square"" we get an updated version of that New Wave classic. And like its predecessor, ""Uptown Girls"" is destined to be more appreciated twenty-five years later than it was by contemporary critics and audiences. Both films include terrific music that had people stopping at a store on the way home from the film to pick up the soundtrack album/CD (with ""soundtrack"" defined as songs by a collection of artists as compared to a more traditional musical score), both feature two emotionally fragile girls-polar opposites who bond and help each other, both have Altman's cool ""Kansas City"" twist where the seemingly weaker girl becomes protective of the tough girl, both have absolutlely perfect endings, and both take place in NYC.

One major difference was that while ""Times Square"" had a clear target audience, ""Uptown Girls"" was never able to quite figure that out. While in almost every way superior to its sister film ""Raising Helen"", ""Uptown Girls"" lacks that films consistent family focus. So we have a fairy tale marketed as a comedy, a generational bonding picture with so much unnecessary adult material (a word here-an obscene gesture there) that it has a PG-13 rating. All of which means that adults think of it as a kid film and young viewers find only intermittent sequences to which they can relate.

At least the film's is consistent in its inconsistency, as Boaz Yakin's inspired and imaginative direction and many incongruously subtle script elements are paired with a contrived and predictable basic story. There is originality packaged inside unoriginality-Ray is not mad at Molly because she was not there when Ray's father died or because Molly was wrong about him living longer if Ray talked to him, she is mad because Molly convinced her to lower her defenses and because of this his death hurts her more.

All this disparity should work in ""Uptown Girls"" favor in a few years when the dust clears and the film finds its proper audience, one that appreciates its complex dichotomy and subtle nuances. Until then it is worth noting that this will be an important film historically. Film historians will look back on ""Uptown Girls"" as the feature where Brittany Murphy (Molly Gunn) really began to define the perceptive airhead persona she began to develop in ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"". Roger Ebert sees a lot of the divine ineptitude of Lucille Ball in Murphy with both being magnets for ""Whoops! moments. I don't see her going quite that far, more like Zasu Pitts or Katherine Hepburn. Hollywood has gone two generations without an actress with this kind of natural comic talent. She and Dakota Fanning (Ray) play off each other very well.

Music is central to the story since Molly's father was a rock legend who died in a plane crash when she was a young girl and Ray's mom runs a record label. Little Molly inspired her father to write a song about her before he died called ""Molly Smiles"". She inspires her boyfriend to write the song ""Sheets of Egyptian Cotton"" but she does not want to hear her father's song. This sets up a somewhat predictable but otherwise perfect ending as you finally get to get to hear ""Molly Smiles"" at Ray's dance recital (and the film is worth watching just for this-as good an ending as ""School of Rock""). As someone commented earlier, the song works perfectly in the finale as all the plot threads are pulled together: "" (1) we get to hear ""Molly Smiles,"" (2) Neal makes up with Molly, (3) we find out what happened to Tommy Gunn's guitars, (4) Ray makes up with Molly, (5) Ray finally dances free style, (6) Ray uses some moves she learned from Molly, and (7) Ray wears Molly's designer tutu. Appropriately, The soundtrack has a lot of the songs by female artists and makes for a pleasant enough album when you finally decide to play something else besides track 12. But you will probably pick this one up for the song about daddy's little girl because ""When the days have gone grey, nothing's wrong when Molly smiles.""

Bottom line don't listen to the negative reviews see this for yourself. If you can suspend belief and just accept the contrived basic story, then it won't be hard to really enjoy Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning as two broken kids who help each other learn how to live, 25 years after ""Times Square"".

I bought this for my own and sent one to my daughter, her nick name is RAE and so with our relationship it seemed to touch our  hearts in the same way.  She got it on her birthday and told me ...yes, it made her cry.  The ending song during the credits "" TIME"" is so touching I cry everytime I hear it.  I recommend this to any mom & daughter who has had a tough time of it growing up.

1929603,2,B0000DZ6N3,"Brittany Murphy needs better roles.  I don't know how to explain this further, but I do not believe that she has quite found her stride yet.  As I look through her catalog of 20-something films, it surprises me that I can only say that I have enjoyed about a teaspoon of her work.  Even as I look through the titles like Sin City, Little Black Book, and Girl, Interrupted, I cannot help but think that perhaps it wasn't her roles in these films that caught my attention, but instead the story, style, and power of the other, stronger, characters.  She has yet to come forward and surprise us all with her hidden talent.  Uptown Girls is a glowing example of Murphy not quite gaining her stride, but finding herself in the aura of a stronger actress.  The story surrounding Uptown Girls is flimsy and brittle.  Murphy's character carries no emotion or depth at all, which only proceeds to corrupt the story even further.  Thankfully, we are not forced to drag our feet through the film with only the likes of Murphy to carry us, thankfully, we have a young, and highly inspirational Dakota Fanning, to add some levity to the project.

Uptown Girls is not a good film in any way shape or form.  I have mentioned before that the story itself really held no merit at all.  Here we have the story of a wealthy girl that cannot handle responsibility, whom ultimately learns the key values in life from a clich child character that has been created in nearly every film released in the past decade.  Plotholes seem to be endless and frequent, while unexplained coincidences seem to plague the very root of this story.  It is yet another classic example of Hollywood attempting to give us the sympathy character (Murphy) while never quite explaining the hurdle of money, past, or reason.  We have entire scenes, which revolve around a relationship that seems like it was developed in high school, not real life.  Murphy tries to juggle a job, a non-existent, yet existent love life, and friendship, while still proving that she is a strong individual.  Whew.  Yet, through all of this mess (in which Murphy seems to lead us), there is a glimmer of light.  Dakota Fanning.  I mentioned her name before, but I feel as if I should explain in some detail.  Dakota is a talented actress.  At the ripe young age that she is, I feel as if we have only seen the cusp of her talent.  I believe that Oscar will reward her one-day and she so deserves it.  There were moments in this film when Dakota literally took this feeble story and made it her own.  She stole every scene away from Murphy and proceeded to make a film that showcased her talent.  For such a young actress, this was an impressive feat.  Fanning owned this film, and it was demonstrated in every scene she graced.

Outside of Fanning, the rest of the film was dismal.  Director Boaz Yakin has shown us in the past that he can create decent work.  Even in this film, there are scenes that just jumped from the screen.  One that comes to mind is the way he set the camera up so that when Murphy and Fanning meet for the second time, Murphy is reflected off Fanning's sunglasses.  It was a brilliant shot, sadly, it was the only worthwhile piece of photography throughout the entire film.  Yakin could have taken this feature and transformed it into this rather dark insight into the world of the wealthy and privileged.  Instead, we are forced to watch this below-mediocre film that yields to age-old Hollywood clichs and unanswered questions.  Perhaps most has to do with Murphy and her inability to go beyond the ditzy blonde image, but I think more has to do with Yakin.  He has been bought by the glamour of Hollywood and has found that their images can be found through his eyes.  Where was that cunning director that gave us that inspirational film Fresh?  I didn't see that same director anywhere in this picture.  Yet another decent director has found that money can prevail over creativity.

Overall, this was a truly uninspiring film.  With low-grade actors attempting to bring some life to the shattering script (like Heather Locklear as Fanning's mother), we only are left with more of a mess than what we began with.  Fanning carries this movie and honestly gives us a better performance than the entire crew put together.  I believe that she could have been the only person in this film and it would have been 100% better.  We needed more background on Murphy, like her passion for her parents, her devotion to her friends, or her inability to cope with reality, instead of being rushed right into unmanned situations without explanation only to find most laughing instead of asking the question ... why?  This was a pathetic attempt to show the effects of parenting on children, using copious clichs to make the general audiences feel comfortable.  See this movie for the talent of Dakota Fanning, but skip everything else.  Pathetic.

1929605,5,B0000DZ6N3,"On Saturday 6th December I saw 'Uptown Girls' with the gorgeous

Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning.

I first got interested in it when I saw an interview in a Who

magazine here with the director who said during this paragraph...

According to New Yorker Yakin, Girls moonlights as a very personal,

post-Sept. 11 love letter to the Big Apple: ""This movie makes New

York look like no other movie has for 20 or 30 years"". To back that

lofty claim, he enlisted cinematographer Michael Ballhaus (fresh

from 'Gangs Of New York' and promises a ""beautiful, fairy-tale

version of what New York City can be"".

He wasn't wrong. It was different. Really quite lovely in fact. Nice

and refreshing even. There were different and classy camera angles

and I found the transitions from scene to scene unique and clever.

Dakota was a spotless neat freak afraid of germs. She might almost be

irritating if she wasn't so great, and so cute, and well deserving of

previous roles before this.

Brittany was also beautiful as can be as Molly Gunn. A girl down on

her luck when it comes to finding work. You'd think anyone but

Brittany might pull a gun on someone due to frustration, but not

Molly. She might just shoot her mouth off at people instead, but

words can be harmless or meaningful, and when Brittany or Molly talks

I want to listen. But you'll be pleased to hear she isn't out of work

long enough to consider any of this, when she is given a job as a

baby sitter baby sitting Dakota. The child a mother can't properly

love, but someone who can really benefit from spending time with

people her own age. While also using less sophisticated adult

vocabulary.

During the course of the movie, Molly finds love with a singer who

can't usually get a word in edgeways, sings a catchy tune to her for

her birthday. At a time in the bathroom when Molly thinks of herself

as a 'hideous hag' when really that statement couldn't be further

from the truth. Brittany just gets more and more adorable as time

goes on and her movies come out. This guy is just what he needs.

Lucky Molly even gets a song for her from her spunky singing

boyfriend, inspired by him after she spends a night in ""Sheets Of

Egyptian Cotton"" with him. It is an instant hit as you'd imagine any

song about one of Brittany's character's might be. Any daughter of a

famous singer would have to be an instant hit with the guys.

Don't be fooled movie goers, ""This is not 'The Shinning'"". It is an

upbeat movie for upbeat audiences. Full of fun but also something

meaningful. You could learn something worthwhile in this. Let your

emotions go and have faith in Brittany that she will see you through

to the end of the film and leave you gasping for more after leaving

you in a spin, you may need to see it again, or have a tea party and

invite some guests, like the Mad Hatter and have crumpets. Don't

forget Alice or the White Rabbit. I hope he isn't late! There's no

time like a Brittany Murphy movie!

Everyone will be smiling along with Molly once they see 'Uptown

Girls', I assure you! That will mean Brittany will keep smiling, and

why wouldn't she when her smile lights up the screen and fan's hearts

so often? Keep smiling Brittany!

I wonder if Billy Joel is also smiling thanks to his 'Uptown Girl'

song, that is not in the movie. Oh no, Billy might not smile over

that, but I'm sure he couldn't think of any better girl then Brittany

or Dakota to be in a movie like his song. If that doesn't make Billy

smile I don't know what will! Two 'Uptown Girls' instead of one!",1113955200,7,3570,4.434312210200927

When, I saw the commericial for the film I had high hopes it looked like the classic coming of age-- learning from someone else chick flick. I made the mistake of buying the DVD before renting( I won't make that mistake again).

The storyline is horrible-- in the movie Fanning's father is in a coma in the living room and Murphy has a pet pig that runs rampant around her apartment. Perhaps, an over-dramatized storyline is the reason why this movie is such a failure-- going to Coney Island and having it closed, or Fanning's runaway incident after the death of her comatose father or Fanning's mother's sleepovers while her father is in the living deliever a less than great movie.

Murphy is horrible in this film and delievers the worst performance of her career as the little girl who never grew up-- [...]. And it looks like Murphy is coming off a heroin high throughout the movie. Fanning however, does a wonderful job as the eccentric little girl who has grown up before her years-- but she does not manage to salvage what is one of the worst films I've ever seen and the worst film of it's year(I believe it won that award in fact).

I enjoy it too, but even though the story of Molly Gunn, an heiress to her deceased parents fortune, is likeable, her character is also irritatingly unrealistic.  She is like Edie Sedgwick minus the drugged out debauchery.  How can someone have so much and have no clue to reality being in the world alone? Someone like this would be extra street smart having to make it with no guidance but then there would be no movie.
If you can stand that much, we start on Mollys birthday leaving her pig Moo in her apartment on her carefree dizzy way to her own surprise birthday party.  She there experiences love at first sight with the British Singer who entertains at the party and has to have him even though like Morrisey as they say, is happily celibate.
She also meets Rae (Dakota Fanning)a charmingly hateful and pre-wizened 8 year old with a Rock Manager Mogul mom, played by Heather Locklear.  Molly thinks nothing of the little snob who puts her down very efficiently until escorted back to her table.
Molly soon finds herself with the rocker she so had to have, then rejects, then gets desperate when he rejects her back, and what is worse, she is in the dark, with no bills paid and NO money after her ""parents guy Bob"" embezzles the fortune and leaves her with nothing.
Faced with finding employment is a daunting task, especially for a ditzy irresponsible flower child in the wrong decade like Molly.  But, she finds a job taking care of, guess who? RAE!
How does this all go for Molly and Rae, watch and see.
This movie is enjoyable and entertaining.  You could definitely see it more than once, but somehow it is mired in a mood of melancholy for a movie that was meant to be mostly light and fun, or is it?  I am not sure what the writers, director and producer were thinking.  It is a mix of a tearjerker and comedy, which is hard to pull off, yet this does, and does it pretty well.  Brittney Murphy is fairly likeable but somewhat irritating as mentioned before, and Dakota Fanning, well there is a softer side that Molly manages to uncover.
All in all, a nice family oriented movie, but not exactly a light hearted romp as you would expect.  The fault here is many depressing moments leaving a cloud of depression over the entire film.  Not a perfect movie, but infinitely watchable regardless.",1081987200,,2375,4.5233644859813085

The characters in Uptown Girls really tell you the truth about the title of the movie, they are two 'Uptown' rich little girls who were brought together to learn from each other and realize that Molly (Brittany Murphy) and Ray (Dakota Fanning) have gone through the same thing about the same time.  Only Molly didn't have anyone at that age and but Ray does now, with Molly.  It's a heart warming film that I truely enjoyed to the bone.
A little note for those who enjoy watching it over and over for little things to complain about, if you notice throughout the entire movie, Brittany Murphy in every shot is wearing a dress or skirt.  Never pants or anything else, the only scene she is, is when she's with Duey watching the ""Sheets of Egyptian Cotton"" music video.  She's in shorts and stretch pants.  But then if you notice, she's wearing the same stretch pants underneith her dress in the next scene when she does to Rays house.
As the producer Boaz said this movie was mean't to be unrealistic and for those who haven't seen the sneak preview to the interview with the cast about that, I hope you realize that this movie was about being enchanted and fantasized in New York and that if you want to go somewhere to find yourself or your dream, that New York is the place to go.  I think though that this movie is a mix of both realism and not, there are people who have problems dealing with death and some more than others try to do the opposite of what Molly does and thats heading downwards.  Whereas with her, she's always trying to stay as positive about everything and taking things in stride.  I pride myself in things about that and hope that most will see this amazing movie.

1929644,3,B0000DZ6N3,"Greenestreet Film receptionist Allison Jacobs thought of the original story, and developed it with other three writers to make it ""Uptown Girls.""  Clearly the genesis of the film is appealng to her, and the Brittany Murphy/Dakota Fanning duo is helpful to make it more so.  But one strange thing is the choice of the director Boaz Yakin, whose previous films are rather serious ones (""Fresh"" and ""A Price above Rubies"").
The strength and weakness of ""Uptown Girls"" may be accounted for with this unique origin.  It features hopelessly clueless (NYC's) Uptown girl Molly, whose dad was a once popular rock singer.  She lives in a comfy room with so many birthday presents that she'd rather thrown them away to some charity institute as if nothing.
But her life changes entirely when her financial manager ""Bob"" (just Bob) takes all the money and flies to Brazil.  She has to earn money, and her last resort is to be a babysittter for a rich 8 year-old girl, Dakota Fanning's Ray, whose mother is always away from the penthouse.  And Ray is awfully, very awfully, precocious.
Can they be friends?  Can they understand each other?  Of course, you know the answer for sure, but that is not a problem at all.  The two leading ladies are charming enough in their own way, I thought, but some (or many) would take these ladies  otherwise, thinking them too obnoxious and noisy.  Frankly this is the point that divides the opinions among viewers.  If you hate Ally McBeal, you should stay away from this one.
Brittany Murphy's Molly may look as if following the tradition that comes from Marilyn Monroe -- good-natured blonde girl who just cannot get everything right, but still charming.  Ms. Murphy is sexy and seductive enough to engage our attention, but I found Dakota Fanning lacks her usual charms.  She does not smile at all, and that might explain why.
Director Boaz Yakin does decent job in inducing Brittany Murphy to show her delightful side, but his handling of the supports are total failure.  Molly's boyfriend by Jesse Spencer is insignificant (or I say unnecesary), and Ray's mother Heather Locklear is just reduced to a cypher.  Why didn't director concentrate more on drawing the relations between these girls, which is more engaging, than on the cursory descriptions of the supports?
From the first moment we see Molly tumbles into Ray's room with a little pig in tow, this is a modern-age fairy tale.  You cannot take this film in any level of reality.  It's a fantasy, and this is how the film wants to be taken.  That's how the film was born, and how it should be taken.",1077494400,,2585,4.755605381165919

1929646,4,B0000DZ6N3,"In terms of the basic plot ""Uptown Girls"" is totally predictable.  Molly Gunn (Brittany Murphy) is a spoiled little rich girl who needs to grow up when she is forced to go out and get a job for the first time in her life.  Ray Schleine (Dakota Fanning) is an 8-year-old even littler little rich girl who is not only a hypochondriac and wise beyond her years but who needs to learn how to be a kid.  Of course circumstances throw them together when Molly becomes Ray's nanny.  There is the comic period of butting heads, the tentative beginnings of friendship, the point at which things blow up big time, and the heartfelt reconciliation.  But one of the reasons that formula films like this continue to be made is because more often than not they work.  The result is not a great film, but an enjoyable one where the best part of the film is the finale, where between them writers Julia Dahl, Mo Ogrodnik, Lisa Davidowitz and Allison Jacobs come up with a creative way of bringing together major plot elements.
The twist with Molly Gunn is that she is the daughter of a rock 'n' roll legend, guitarist Tommy Gunn.  Her parents were killed in a plane crash when she was about Ray's age and she has been living off the residuals.  In her apartment there is a shrine in which all of her father's guitars are displayed, including the one on which he wrote his biggest hit, ""Molly Smiles,"" the song that Molly can no longer bear to here.  Molly might be spoiled, but she has a kind heart and not a mean bone in her body.  When her accountant steals all of her money and disappears she has her friends, Ingrid (Marley Shelton) and Huey (Donald Faison), who stay true and try to help her survive in the real world (I liked not having to do deal with her friends forgetting her now that she is broke).  She also likes Neal Fox (Jesse Spencer), the young musician who plays at her birthday party.  The only problem is that he is 274 days in his sobriety and wants to be celibate the first year.  But he too is inspired by Molly to write a song that becomes a hit.
Ray's mother, Roma Schleine (Heather Locklear) runs a record label, which, of course, signs Neal.  This also explains why Ray needs a Nanny and we already know why the kid's attitude has a long procession of nanny's coming and going.  But beyond her immaculate room and her preoccupation with germs and disease, Ray has her own father issue: he suffered a stroke and is now a vegetable set up in the library of the apartment.  She seldom talks about her dad and she never visits him.  To Molly, this is just wrong, but she does not give the obvious speech.  Ray is smart enough to know what she would say and Molly bides her time until the time comes to say the right thing.  In the counter-part to that scene that comes shortly afterwards, Molly and Ray communicate a whole range of emotions without either one of them even saying a word.  Films like this rarely let silence speak so well on the behalf of the characters.
Dakota Fanning was the best thing in ""Taken,"" and after her solid performance in ""I Am Sam"" it is nice to see her do a more comedic role in this film.  Count me in the growing list of those who think she could well be the Jodi Foster of her generation (to wit, she is better than Jodi Foster was at this age and you have the sense that she can make the transition from child star to adult star).  Brittany Murphy, who was wasted in ""Just Married"" and was asked to do something decidedly different in ""8 Mile,"" sinks her teeth into this role.  She has the ditzy parts down pat, but it is the honest moments that she shares with both Ray and Roma that she achieves her best grace notes in the film.  She should get a lot of opportunities to do more romantic comedies and as long as they have some basis in the real world and do not require her character to go over the top, she should thrive in such roles.
Again, I want to applaud the creativity shown at the end of the film.  Coming up with a payoff at the end of a film like this is difficult, because you need something that brings the characters together in a happy ending.  What I like about this ending is that it achieves this without the characters involved ever making physical contact, by involving at least a half-dozen key plot elements, and, most importantly, by having the song we have been waiting almost the entire movie to hear be as good as it was supposed to be.  When you watch the film a second time pay attention to how the music is set up during the auction scene.  There might not be enough new here to make this a great film, but director Boaz Yakin has made ""Uptown Girls"" a nicely crafted formula film that more than meets our expectations.",1077235200,41,4694,4.333714285714286

Until the man in charge of her trust fund skips town taking her millions to South America. Forced to rely only non-existent skills to get a job, Brittany takes a job as a nanny. Soon the fun job becomes a nightmare, as Brittany locks horns with her new charge- a spoiled and indulged rich girl and a new love interest a self-absorbed singer. Does Molly have what it takes to make everything work out, or is she destined to be just another has-been?
I was surprised at how much I liked this movie, despite the sappy premise. Brittany was excellent as Molly....And the actress who plays her charge did a wonderful job. The actor who played her love interest was handsome and believable.
I did think the 'stay in school' message at the end was a little heavy handed. With all the talent she had...Did Molly really need four more years of school? Ah well, I suppose that had to be thrown in for the kiddies.

1929648,5,B0000DZ6N3,"The movie ""Uptown Girls"" is not your average teenaged film, and to speak truthfully, it shouldn't even be put into that category. While it_was_geared towards the teen audiences, it is a delightful little mixture of comedy and drama that seems to belong under the category of ""chick flick"". Now, I'm a woman, and I don't really like that lable, but in reality, it's the easiest way to express the genre this film falls under.
People have claimed this movie attempts to be realistic, but that's not true at all. This story is about the daughter of a deceased world-famous musician whose money gets stolen by her accountant, and then is forced to find a job. How many people have you met like that? Unless you're filthy rich yourself, probably not very many. It is meant to be like a little New York fairytale, and although New York isn't very picturesque, it is certainly the best setting for it.
Molly Gunn is the spoiled girl from above, who seems to have a problem with relationships. In the beginning, she starts a rocky fling with a musician and, when he moves on, she's mopin so much that she doesn't notice that her electricity and phone have been turned off. The man that usually deals with her bills has swindled away her money and run off himself, leaving Molly penniless. There is only one thing that the poor child can do: get a job. So, eventually, Molly ends up as the nanny for Ray, a young girl with an almost obsessive need for things to be clean and orderly, and who lacks any humor or childhood experience. Both become set on teaching the other their ways.
As time goes on, Molly realizes that Ray is completely neglected by her mother and has emotional problems stemming from her fathers coma. While she begins to grow up and deal with her troubles, Molly becomes closer to Ray, who is slowly letting herself have fun and loosening up. Their relationship is adorable.
In any case, it does get quite emotional, and I found ""Uptown Girls"" to be charming. The acting is done well, and the characters have the right chemistry.

1929649,5,B0000DZ6N3,"What I expected and what I got from this movie are two totally different things. I was expecting a Legally Blonde knockoff with a precocious little girl. Instead, I got an extremely heart felt movie that's not quite so ditzy as I thought, but actually quite thoughtful and oddly tearjerking. The previews, I felt, were extremely misleading, making the movie look a lot ditzier than it actually is. Molly (Brittany Murphy) is so wrapped up in her own life that she's blindsided when she learns that all her money is gone. What's a girl to do? She ends up becoming the nanny for paranoid little Ray (Dakota Fanning). And of course, they learn from one another. This movie is full of these little sad moments that will no doubt shock anyone who sees this film in an attempt to write it off as a piece of fluff. Perhaps this movie has a bit of fluff, but it's all good. The ending is incredibly sweet and really moving, and will no doubt make you want to own the soundtrack.

1929651,5,B0000DZ6N3,"This movie actually made me cry in spot's and also it had it's funny spot's. It's about a young woman, Molly,(Brittany Murphy),who has everything she could possibly have,except not knowing how to really grow up and take responsibility. As a daughter of a famous rock star father,(Tommy Gunn),who with his wife both passed away,leaving Molly enough material thing's,and plenty of money. Molly is a girl who like's to spend money on clothe's,go clubbing,staying out all night with friend's partying. One of her best friend's,played by (Marley Shelton),Sugar & Spice,Ingrid is a complete opposite, who watche's her bill's and is very conservative,try's to let Molly know it's time to take responsibility,Molly still doe's her own thing,until she lose's everything to a accountant that had been taking her money for some time. Now it's time for Molly to get a job,Ingrid help's her find one,but that dosent work out,so Molly is in need for another job. Another friend help's her out, it's (Dakota Fanning) from Iam Sam, she play's Ray,a little 8 yr old girl going on 30,whom Molly met at a club waiting on her mother played by (Heather Locklear),Roma,who is more interested in signing Rock star's for her company then being with her little daughter Ray. Molly get's the job of a nanny to Ray,who at first they don't get along. Molly is a free spirit who like's to have fun, and Ray is a little girl who has been left alone much of her life by her mother,and act's like anadult then a child. Also Molly has an on & off fling with a upcoming rock star,who decides Molly is just not grown up enough for him,so that end's. Getting back to the movie,Molly realize's after seeing Ray's action's & grown up behavior that she need's to save Ray from not learning how to be a child and growing up to fast. As this is happening Molly get's in touch with herself and learn's it's time to put away childish behavior and grow up! So in effect Ray's problem's conteract Molly's need to grow up. She start's to try & unleash the hurt Ray is going through,cause of her mother buying her off and paying no attention to her & Ray's father that is dying. Ray dosent know how to express her feeling's. Then a problem arise's that Molly is let go of being Ray's nanny,Molly has a heated talk with Roma,(mother),& let's her know that Ray hasn't had a regular childhood,& a very good mother,by saying you buy her off so you don't have to deal with her,etc,and walk's out. I can't give it away,but Molly had told Ray something that was a promise & Ray believed Molly,but it didn't work out that way. Molly finally learn's she can't get Ray out of her mind,she really feel""s for her pain. Ray's dad dies,Roma is taking it just fine,almost emotionalist. Molly is at a good friend's house when she learn's Ray is missing by Roma. Thinking back to her own childhood,she remember's where she wen't when she lost her parent's, Coney Island,where she would get in the spinning tea cup ride & think to be alone. Molly find's Ray right there,at coney island. Ray is sitting alone in a teacup ride,Molly get's in & the ride start's,you can see in both their eye's each other's pain,& Ray really lets go at Molly,hitting her and then she finally cry's & hug's Molly,that part is so sad,I know I cry everytime I watch it. Finally Ray & Molly get their pain out,& you see a very big difference in Ray,because Molly cared enough to help this little girl who had really no one to show her to be a child or to show emotion's. Then Ray learn's from Molly how to enjoy childhood & not act like a grown up,as Ray help's Molly to learn how to grow up & show responsibility. They help each other with emotional wound's,of losing people they love. It even affect's Roma at the end,she seem's to understand what Molly was saying to her,just love your daughter,let her be a child and be there for her,don't buy he off,it got through to her. So a 8 yr old help's a young woman,then the young woman help's the 8 yr old. That is the moral of the movie. I bought this without even seeing it,my son said it was good and it reminded him of me. Iam glad I did,because it was a heartfilled/comedy,I think we need more movie's like this,to show moral's and the trouble's people have to remind them, they are not alone,and there are still people out there that do still care about human emotion's.

1929653,3,B0000DZ6N3,"The idea of a young women befriending a little-girl is an interesting one.  These types of friendships are rarely seen in movies now days.  First I will say why I thought the movie was interesting and had good potential.  I like the fact that Brittany Murphy's character does not focus her attention on continuing a possibly unhealthy relationship with Jesse Spencer's character.  Instead she seems to be doing what makes more sense for her, such has coming to terms with her past and finally living her life more responsibly.
In regards to Dakota Fanning's character I like how even though she seems to be acting like she's all grown up and self-sufficient she still in fact has tendencies that reinforce what she actually is, a young girl.  This became apparent when she stares at the tea cups when both girls go to the amusement park and starts to tear up.  Perhaps at that moment realizing that she has wanted to and has missed out in having a typical fun childhood.
The problem that I found with the movie was that I felt it was too short.  It did not seem to flow as well as I would have liked, the character development seemed to be evolving abruptly.  The dialogue also suffer from abrupt communication style, with the characters working with one liners or phrases that kept them from more natural fluid conversations.  I think Dakota Fanning is great, which was the main reason why I purchased this movie, but I don't think this movie showcases her range or capabilities as an actress (as seen in ""I Am Sam"").  I have my hopes up for her upcoming movie ""Man On Fire.""",1075161600,2,1576,4.5964285714285715

That said, I found it to be a great coming of age story, and I love Murphy, she's really enjoyable on screen.  It's actually a double ""coming of age"" story in a sense, both the girl and the woman need to mature and face life, and I found it a refreshing change from the normal coming of age story centered around a teenage boy or young man.
It's definitely a good family rental, or if you have daughters in the 10 to 16 range, it's probably worth owning.  It's not just some dumb teen comedy, it is a solid story with a message and even through it is far from academy award stuff, it's a good flick.",1074384000,2,793,4.090322580645161

The reason I give this 3 stars and not 4 or 5 is because perhaps I am biased and don't really enjoy chick flick films.  The strengths of this film of course lie in a mix of emotions and a bonding between a girl who is 8 (Fanning as Ray)and acts like she is 30 in maturity but has some character flaws in the sense that she skipped childhood.  She is of course vulnerable emotionally, in a very similar way Britney (as Molly Gunn) plays her character.  Fanning of course steals the show with her brilliant acting leaving Britney almost like she's playing catch up because she cant keep up with this girl at times.  The acting talent difference is why I give this a B- overall rating and not a A-.  I think Britney barely pulls of a believeable actor to match Fannings qualities.  This movie really doesnt pull surprises.  It simply lays it out simply.  A girl who acts like a 30 year old who missed childhood from an uncaring mother, and Britney as Molly who is rich and also had nobody to care for her, but she stayed as a child and never grew up and never matured. Of course the two meet and both share a bit of each others life and Fay and  Molly have a special relationship.  The girl teaches Molly how to grow up and be independent; Molly teaches her how to have a childhood, be fun and most of all have someone care for her and be a mother like figure.

While there are some parts of this film that I personally feel brought a little clutter and confusion to the story (the whole beginning with Brittany Murphy's character Molly and the guy she brings home, as well as Molly's quick and random loss of all her money, just did not flow the right way; maybe it's just me, though), ""Uptown Girls"" really picked up as soon as young Molly Gunn (Murphy), a spirited, youthful young party girl begins her first major job as a nanny to 8-year-old Ray Schleine (Dakota Fanning). While the two can relate to and appreciate one another in some intense ways--Molly copes with her parents' death through playful and childish behavior, while little Ray handles her parents' emotional absences through a hard, angry, and unrelenting mask--it takes time for them to grow comfortable with each other's help. Part of what helps makes the storyline so realistic is that it doesn't begin with Molly and Ray hating each other and then quickly shift them into a sappy relationship where they become the best of friends. Even as they begin getting along and opening up more to each other, many halts and challenges cloud their gradual friendship throughout the film. Molly wants to care for the child and share her youthful charm with her, but Ray is not about to let down her defenses until she knows exactly who this Molly Gunn is and what kind of influence she will have on her life.
The storyline moves very slowly at parts, but the excellent acting and the faithful innocence of the plot make it a truly worthwhile film that many can enjoy.
The two leading actresses work extremely well with their roles, creating in-depth characters that we can slowly but surely feel for as the movie progresses. Brittany Murphy is wonderful and has a very childlike innocence to her that made the role of Molly Gunn perfect for her. As for 9-year-old Dakota Fanning.... I absolutely cannot get over her. Every once in a great, great, great while, Hollywood releases a child who starts appearing over and over and shows signs of greatness, and Fanning is just that type of little girl. This young actress is just incredible--I was watching and listening to her in the DVD's short featurette about the making of the film (there's a priceless segment in it with Dakota imitating the paparazzi) and was just in awe. This little girl has amazing maturity, is smart as a whip, and has tremendous talent. She knows exactly what's going on around her, and she's about as ""with it"" as any of the leading adult actors out there. I just know that Dakota is going to be the next Shirley Temple--the next child phenom who will, for the rest of her life, put light in the sometimes dark world and make people feel peaceful and happy with her films. Given a few more years, Dakota is going to have the whole world noticing her--Hollywood has already made sure of this by putting her in many diverse and increasingly mature roles. She's done a little drama (I Am Sam), science fiction (Taken), children's films (Cat In the Hat), fairytale-drama (Uptown Girls), and will soon take on her biggest, most intense role yet with Denzel Washington in the action thriller ""Man On Fire."" I just love the way Hollywood is using her maturity to their advantage yet is still allowing her to maintain that hopeful, gentle, and innocent glow that can establish her as a true inspirational fixture throughout her life. They certainly are not holding back with little Dakota--she may be only nine years old, but she's not just a cute little movie child with enough talent to carry a movie or two. She's got the fire and determination to go all the way, perhaps farther than any other child star has ever gone. It sounds extreme, but that's just how good she is, and there's this amazing promise she carries that almost cannot be explained--just embraced and believed. At 18 years old, I truly admire her; I wish her all the best, and I absolutely cannot wait to see what she becomes in the future.
I guess I got a little off track here, talking more about Dakota Fanning herself than the movie...but all in all, ""Uptown Girls"" is a great, sentimental story that may bring a tear or two to your eye. As determined to motivate as it is to stress the importance of sharing emotions, ""Uptown Girls"" may be a great choice if you're looking for something powerful and ultimately uplifting, topped off with some inspired acting.",1073433600,,4519,4.692695214105793

1929679,4,B0000DZ6N3,"I normally hate movies like these, but there's something about ""Uptown Girls"" that was really special.  While acting on both parts got pretty bad in comedy momants, it withstood very well in drama, when Britney remembers her parents, or when Dakota sees her father.
Dakota Fanning is about the best child actor there is, but she's got a ways to go before the stipulation of 'child' is removed from my above statement.  She can do it though.  And Brittney provides great acting here too, proving that she too actually HAS talent, as you can also see in ""SPUN"".  This makes them both really seem to care about eachother, which is a tough job for Dakota, because none of her love can just be her saying ""I Like You""; she needs to pretend to hate Brittney, while at the same time convey that she cares.
Brittney is able to channel the great Lucieal Ball for this performance, making constant mistakes, but still living in a world of whimsey and fun.  Hopefully, we'll see more of this Brittney in movies to come.
All in all, as good as your girlfriends taste in movies may ever get.",1072915200,,1078,4.536082474226804
