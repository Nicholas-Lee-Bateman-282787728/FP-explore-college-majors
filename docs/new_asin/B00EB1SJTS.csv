Rob's friend Coop (Gabriel Horn) is a colorful character who is running for mayor. Along comes Delacroix (Joel S. Greco) a man who offers them big money to steal a scroll from an abandoned house.

This leads into a vampire flick.

The tone for the film was that of a light comedy. The sound track and dialogue was set for humor, although the plot was less comedic preventing this from becoming a cult classic.

This is the best film on the R2 Super Pack Vampires.
