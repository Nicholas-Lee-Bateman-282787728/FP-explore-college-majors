8754522,2,B01D01K5VO,"Most bogus dvd I ever bought in my life, No music scenes, no inside scoop on how anything was recorded just online conversations with fans. And I'm not a hater in fact Bruno is 1 of my favorite artist and I've purchased everything he's put out but I got to keep it real for people who spend there $$$ & support live music.",1500508800,11,322,4.126984126984127

8754526,1,B01D01K5VO,"This is a complete waste of money and a total sham.  I only gave it One Star in order to write this review....  I  have never been so disappointed with a purchase from Amazon.  This DVD, under the false description of the career and rise of Bruno Mars, consists of three random interviews that appear to be recorded from someone's television.  The ""producers"" of this piece of crap should be ashamed.",1467590400,34,400,4.577464788732394
