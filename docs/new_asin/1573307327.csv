In cartoon form it tells the Easter story from Palm Sunday to the assumption in a gentle way, emphasizing Christ's love for us.  My daughter likes to join in with Kathy Lee Gifford during the theme song.  She often quotes the end of the movie, ""Always remember, I'll love you forever.""  How can I help but love this movie?!",976233600,19,492,4.191489361702128

7797996,3,1573307327,The actual video is fine for the kids at our Sunday School. The problem I had was the condition of the cover. This was a used video and I thought I was purchasing an unused video. Maybe this was my fault when ordering-not sure.,1305504000,,227,4.181818181818182
7797997,1,1573307327,"This version is cute, but it leaves out too much of the true story. We are not giving our children the true story of Jesus when it is made pretty and painless. It doesn't have to be gory to portray the suffering He did for all of us. They didn't show Him carrying His cross, or even on the cross at all. The image of three crosses in the distance is not enough, in my opinion, to tell the story. Do enough parents even know why there are three crosses? Can they answer the questions their children may have?
Certainly, we want to avoid scaring our little ones, yet this version insults their intelligence. Children see more violence on commercials than this. More details would have been good.
Now, I can see focusing on the good in  a video celebrating His life, but this is specifically about Easter. Easter Sunday was beautiful. Good Friday was not pretty, and shouldn't be glossed over. He suffered for us, and nowhere here was this demonstrated. Where is the sacrifice?
Mistakes are everywhere. His disciples were HIDING, in fear for their very lives. Noone danced in the streets, in plain sight. The guards did not watch the stone roll away.(Though the angel waving made my kids laugh.) Jesus was not happy that His disciples fell asleep while He prayed in the garden.
I realize that not everyone is interested in these details. However, Christians today are facing opposiion from all sides. As a Catholic, I see this everyday in the press. We need to know the truth, and spread His word, without changing it for fear of offense.

This video could have shown more detail, and truly spread the Gospel, without being gory or scary. I'm sorry that the producers chose this route instead.",1270166400,,1690,4.63
