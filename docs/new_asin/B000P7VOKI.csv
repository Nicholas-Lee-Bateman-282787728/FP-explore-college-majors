It is a nice surprise to see young generation from Cuba showing quality! I have not seen the enrire DVD, just some of it, and I loved it. If you understand Spanish, go for it.",1304553600,2,304,4.169491525423729
8189777,5,B000P7VOKI,"I borrowed this DVD from my local library. I loved it. Borrewed it again. Now that I've discovered it for sale,I'm definetely buying it. Pio Leiva, from BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB, and the new generation of Cuban singers and musicians, drove the Japanese crazy in their tour to Japan. A must for Cuban music lovers. Excellent sound.",1219363200,4,329,4.7894736842105265
