Meditate or medicate before - you'll need patience to cull through the deluge of stream of consciousness (or unconsciousness).  Having said that, he's not stupid.  So I guess you get out of it what you put into it.  Like a dry college professional - hard to keep paying attention but if you do I suggest are things you would learn.  Good luck!",1464998400,,484,4.150537634408602
