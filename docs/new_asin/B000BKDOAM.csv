8088002,5,B000BKDOAM,"This is a bromance w/ the two best (IMHO) Chinese actors.  There is a dry wit & a sly charm to this one.  I love when they troll around the city in the rain on borrowed"" bikes.  The atmosphere may be bluish air, but the moment is golden.",1373932800,,237,3.8958333333333335
8088003,3,B000BKDOAM,"It was inevitable that after setting the benchmark so high with the first film that Running Out of Time 2 would be a disappointment, and it is, though it's still an above average Hong Kong thriller. Once again it's a game of cat and mouse rather than a collection of action scenes, but this time round new writers Kin Yee Au and Nai-Hoi Yau give Ching Wan Lau much less to work with and the film seriously suffers from the lack of genuine emotional involvement of the original. It's almost a film of incidental pleasures - a couple of playful nods to the original in rooftop and taxi scenes, a nice part for Johnnie To regular Lam Suet as a phenomenally unlucky compulsive gambler, a chase that drags on so long both pursuer and pursued stop for a drink of water and an ice cream and one terrific twist over the location of a ransom drop that the film is never able to top. It also has the best CGI effects I've ever seen in a Hong Kong film, with some remarkably well-integrated shots of an eagle flying through the streets of Hong Kong. But Ekin Cheung's mastermind just isn't interesting enough and the ending is too far fetched to work.",1156982400,3,1140,4.407582938388626
