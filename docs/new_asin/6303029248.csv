Sure this performance is on youtube, but I wanted to own a copy for myself. I would've loved for it to be on DVD, but I'm happy enough that I found it all. The quality was pretty good for a tape, and if you're anything like me and love any one of the singers on this tape I'd get it, it's a kind of rare tape.",1358035200,,414,4.0
7834638,5,6303029248,"I love ALL the musicians who are on this 1st edition of Grammy's Greatest Moments! I bought it because it has Michael Jackson performing, so I was equally pleased to see other favorite artists such as Eurythmics, Donna Summer, Tina Turner, and Marvin Gaye.
I didn't realize that past Grammy shows were not taped and I am so glad that these were among the 1st where the camera was rolling.
I wonder if this is available on DVD!? If it is, I would buy it.",1257120000,,453,4.341176470588235
