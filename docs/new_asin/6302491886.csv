477284,3,6302491886,"Anthony Franciosa plays Sam Lawson, an aspiring New York theater actor desperate for a break.  Dean Martin is his director-friend.  They are running some Off Off theater in the Village called Actors' Rostrum.  Just can't seem to catch a break.  Franciosa is pitched from pillar to post in this overly melodramatic potboiler, with any number of implausible plot manipulations. The movie is very thin on characterizations and motivation. Franciosa's wife begs him to get a job; she miscarries his baby, then retreats home to Michigan.  Dean Martin, who has been dating a wildly alcoholic and flighty Shirley MacClaine, who also happens to be the daughter of a Broadway producer that Franciosa and Martin had been cultivating, somehow lands a job in Hollywood.  Meantime, we are asked to believe that Franciosa turns complete cynic and marries three-time loser MacClaine on the rebound, and then drives a hard bargain when asked by MacClaine and Dean Martin for a divorce.  MacClaine is pregnant carrying Martin's child.  None of these characters ever seem to truly connect with each other, although Carolyn Jones as Franciosa's spinsterish, devoted, long-suffering agent, comes closest.  And so, off the marriage debacle, Franciosa returns to New York and just as it seems he has a foothold in radio and television, along comes the blacklist -- apparently Dean Martin was fingered as a Commie, and by association Franciosa can't get legit work.  Not to worry, a draft notice from the Reserves miraculously arrives in his mailbox and he is shipped off to Korea to fight a war.  There isn't any real sense of struggle here -- mostly a much-too-well-dressed Franciosa whining and tugging at his hair, although he never truly seems hungry for a meal.  Little if any attention is paid to his actual auditions and failures.  He is finally humbled into waiting tables in a theater district restaurant, only to rise from the ashes as the Actors' Rostrum is reborn, thanks to a down at the heels Dean Martin, who appears in an alley with his tail between his legs -- his fortunes have apparently come full circle.  None of this is fully explained or for that matter believable, given the fact that the Shirley MacClaine character is supposed to be financially fixed.  Despite all of the comings and goings, the story arc is flat, and we never get a sense of Franciosa's character in any depth.",1376784000,,2382,4.964735516372796
477285,5,6302491886,All around great film great top notch cast Anthony Franciosa really shines so does Carolyn Jones and Dean Martin in a rare dramatic turn.,1373155200,,137,4.75
477286,3,6302491886,"Anthony Franciosa stars as a young actor who goes to New York with big dreams and, of course, finds that it's a lot harder to make it on the stage than he realized.  Dean Martin co-stars as his director/buddy, Shirley MacLaine is the alcoholic daughter of a famed Broadway producer with whom both men get involved, and Carolyn Jones is a former actress turned successful agent.  There's nothing in this material that is original or especially fresh, since it follows a basic plotline we've seen before.  Franciosa comes on strong (and sometimes too strong) as the idealistic actor who must decide how much idealism he can afford.  Martin is solid and understated, while MacLaine chews the scenery when allowed.  Jones creates the most memorable character, mixing in pathos, humour, and a world-weary experience.  It's not a bad film, but there's nothing here you haven't already seen.  It can be a hard trip on your way to the top. It depends on how bad you want it.",994896000,11,966,4.783132530120482

477398,3,6302491886,"As a Dalton Trumbo film, the dialog is very good and there are good actors in it.  The film itself is choppy, and the transition from scene to scene does not flow.  This could be an editing problem or the fact that it did not appear to have a large budget.  The story is somewhat stereotypical and dark, it's hard to like many of the characters although Tony's character grows on you.  Dean Martin is not a co-star in this film, he is a supporting actor that comes in an out like the waves on a beach.  He is cast not as an opposite to the protagonist character played by Tony who is as much fighting against going the easy way, but more of a shadow of the other side of the ambition and pragmatism that also was a way to success in stage and screen. There is bitterness in this film, as the ugly head of McCarthyism makes an appearance is an much turned inward than outward.  By the end of the film you start to see what may be an admission by Trumbo: is that the interest of many Hollywood types in communism in their early years may have been more opportunistic than ideological.  You wonder if that is not how it had been for Trumbo.  There are no great triumphs or tragedies in this film, as it is more about a journey than a cause.",1431820800,,1237,4.168067226890757

477454,3,6302491886,"Career is an entertaining 1950s vintage movie that actually stars Anthony Franciosa. He portrays an actor who has a lot of talent, which is equaled by a lot of bad luck. He deserves to ""rise to the top,"" but he trusts the wrong people, like friend-turned-producer Maury Novak, played with smarmy elegance by Dean Martin. Shirley MacLaine is a poor little rich girl alcoholic; both men use her in different ways to further their respective careers, making her life a disaster. Franciosa gets burned by being a nice guy, so he decides to become as emotionally ruthless as the people who have hurt him. That path doesn't work either, suggesting we may try to change who we are, but it isn't often successful.

The film was co-written by Hollywood great Dalton Trumbo, who was blacklisted during this artistically devastating period in history. Part of the action centers on the distasteful witch hunt for ""communists."" Careers, and lives, were ruined by zealous politicians; unfortunately, the same character assassination can still be effectively accomplished today by people in power with self-aggrandizing viewpoints. (As a side note: Ms. MacLaine and Mr. Martin also worked together in supporting roles to Frank Sinatra in the movie ""Some Came Running, "" during this time period. Both of these films are wonderful examples of gritty post-war era cultures revealed by scratching the surface of the ""happy"" Eisenhower 50s.",1408752000,3,1421,5.151515151515151

477456,1,6302491886,"I watched this because the way it was described--an early (1959) effort by a Hollywood film to deal with the blacklist--made it sound like a fascinating artifact. Instead, the blacklist is simply a plot twist tacked onto a standard Broadway potboiler (a kind of Brand X Sweet Smell of Success). When our hero (the scenery-chewing Tony Franciosa) gets scratched from a radio show because he's on the list, his agent, played by the really excellent and under-rated Carolyn Jones, is forced to cough up the most shameful line that any Quising studio exec ever inserted in a script. Our hero has been blacklisted because he started out in a downtown theater group (The Actors Podium)run by Dean Martin, playing a louche Elia Kazan, who we learn in the last 3 minutes of the film was actually once a party member (but only because he thought it was a way to get ahead!). When Franciosa points out to Jones that he only ever performed in the the theater and has never had a political affiliation in his life, she defends the blacklist: ""They are just patriotic Americans, trying to protect us."" I would love to know what the back story is here. It seems like an attack on Kazan, who famously named names, but then it basically says it's tough nuggies for our hero because he may be innocent, but that's the price we have to pay when patriotic Americans are protecting us.
Shirley MacLaine is completely terrible in this movie. Donna Douglas (who went on to fame as Ellie May Clampett), is very appealing in a small role. To say that the dialog is cliche-ridden would be an understatement.",1396569600,2,1582,4.673835125448028

Shirley MacLaine lights up any scene she's in, like she did so many times in her career. An unjustly forgotten film that deserves more attention.",1390953600,,483,4.9753086419753085

Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

Ill be honest, when I first rented this movie, I thought it was going to be a comedy. After all, Dean Martin got first billing. Despite the billing, and despite my first impression, Dean is the second lead in the heavy, well-acted drama Career.

Anthony Franciosa wants to be an actor. He wants it more than life itself, as he shows the audience in Career. For the most part, this is an incredibly realistic portrayal of an actors life. He leaves his fianc and moves to New York; after a year, hes still auditioning and living in a glorified closet with no radiator. We see him beg for the chance to audition, spew hurtful words to his agent when he feels bad, and badmouth a producer when he loses a part. Its realistic.

Theres a great scene with Dean and Tony in a restaurant. Theyre trying to keep their voices down to not attract the attention of other people, and the tension simmers! Tony is making his case for why he deserves a part in a show. Ive got talent! he insists. Dean shakes his head. Thats what you start with, he says. Tony explains hes not good at the self-selling aspect of being an actor. Then learn or get out! Dean says. Its sad, but true. Talent isn't enough in show business.

Tony won a Golden Globe for his dramatic performance that year, beating out Richard Burton, Fredric March, and Charlton Heston in Ben-Hur! He does give a really good performance; even if you love Ben-Hur, you can appreciate it. Carolyn Jones, not a very well known actress, does a particularly good job as Tonys tired and tireless agent who knows the life of an actor very well. The acting and most of the story is really good, but I didn't really care for the ending. If you like realistic show business movies, add Career to your weekend watch list!",1498521600,,1805,4.460606060606061
