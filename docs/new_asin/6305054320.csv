7881531,2,6305054320,"I'm spoiled by the technology of a clear crisp picture. This program does not have that. I like my co- characters (the gentleman Ron Howard traveled with) to have some 3- dimension development. This program does not have that. I like the story to have a beginning, a middle, and an end. This program has no end (resolution). Ron Howard's acting is superb and the girl is beautiful, and that's very important. I ""believed"" their characters.",1428969600,,439,4.7894736842105265
7881532,3,6305054320,"A little over 30 min short story ..ending left you feeling short change , acting storyline was slow but ok and loved seeing the young amy and ron.",1428710400,,146,4.25
7881533,4,6305054320,I liked this movie because it was very personal and very honest. Neither shows were very extravegant in budgets... but they're still well done. Both star James Dean as the front man. It's fun to see :),1000857600,,201,4.45945945945946
