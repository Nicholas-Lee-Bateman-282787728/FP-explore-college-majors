8188724,3,6305375143,"This DVD starts off with Goku falling off of snake way, and trying to trick two ogres into letting him get back on track.  The shirts on the ogres reads HFIL, which stands for Home For Infinite Losers.  This was edited from saying HELL, which is where Goku really is.  Goku comes across more problems when he meets Princess Snake, who tries to seduce and eat him, and Gohan runs away from Piccolo.  Although a good DVD, it is not the best and only gets a three from me.",970617600,,469,4.235955056179775
8188725,4,6305375143,"Goku is on snake way trying to reach King Kai before the sayans arrive (Nappa power level at 4,000 and Vegeta at 18,000) And little old Gohan training with piccolo could have been easier. Vegeta and Nappa are waiting  to get their wish of eternal life after coming to earth after Radditz died.  In my oppinion Nappa the loser has a low fighting power and the puny  earthlings can't beat him (that's in the later episode!) and their puny  powerlevels are about 1,800 (that's tiens!) Well Gotta go and also buy  Frieza death of a prince where Vegeta dies.",963532800,3,553,4.545454545454546
