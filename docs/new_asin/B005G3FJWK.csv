4687168,5,B005G3FJWK,"Carmen Electra isn't really a main character in this show, she is just a fun bonus. This show is about three guys who go to Mardi Gras in New Orleans looking to meet women and party. The acting in this show is well done and really hilarious. This show is full of lots of hot women. It is more of a guys show, but anyone who is into sexy comedies will love this show!",1369008000,,366,3.9594594594594597

4687171,3,B005G3FJWK,"David Johnson, DVD Verdict --Eventually Carmen Electra does show up and wander around in her underwear for a bit. But featuring her so prominently in the marketing does Mardi Gras Spring Break a disservice. It feels like the powers-that-be are working hard to sell their production with a gimmick, when this is actually a surprisingly funny R-rated comedy.

Now, the preface needs to be said: this is only for viewers who dig the gross-out, hard-R, Hangover type of comedy. Breasts, excrement, banana penetration, and even a sporadic wiener shot are draped throughout. These guys seize on the R (or rather Unrated) rating and ensure you're getting more offensive, ridiculous, over-the-top crap than you can shake a stick at.

Speaking of which, there is a scene where Bret Harrison takes a giant dump in Carmen Electra's toilet. But because the flushing mechanism is broken (of course), he bare-hands his deposit, cradles it in a towel, hides it in the tub, and eventually ends up in the hallway, heaving the turd into a ceiling fan, spraying everyone with poop. God help me...I laughed.

That's what effective movies like this can do to relatively mature grown-ups...turn them into sputtering middle-schoolers who laugh at their own farts. I am so ashamed.

The DVD: 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, 5.1 Dolby surround, and no extras.

8471042,3,B005G3FJWK,It is a typical spring break film. Carmen Electra is ok as is the rest of the cast. Not really my type of flick but I didn't buy it for me. I got it for my son and his girlfriend. They would probably give it a 4 star.,1384041600,,217,3.5416666666666665
