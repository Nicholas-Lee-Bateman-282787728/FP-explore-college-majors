8208485,5,B000TB661M,"I've been doing this routine since 2004, and I have had six spine surgeries.  It is the only comprehensive exercise/stretch program that works for me, and if I don't do the exercises at least twice/week I always have increased pain symptoms.  I appreciate having this available to me.",1363910400,4,284,4.895833333333333
8208486,5,B000TB661M,"The moves are simple yet effective.  She keeps count for you, so you can concentrate on the moves instead of watching the DVD the whole time.  The number of repetitions is reasonable.  It is a great way to get started in Pilates!",1306022400,12,229,4.404761904761905
