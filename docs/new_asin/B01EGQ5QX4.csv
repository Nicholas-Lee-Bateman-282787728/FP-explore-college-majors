8758638,5,B01EGQ5QX4,"This is a different kind of movie on the horrendous damage that mountain top removal and strip mining are doing to West Virginia and other Appalachian states. Don't buy this DVD if you're looking for a happy ending! There is none.......yet. But if you want to see a very personal side to what mountain top removal is doing to people living near it, this is an excellent starting point. For recent information on mountain top removal check out websites at Coal River Mountain Watch and the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition.",1512604800,,525,4.844444444444444
