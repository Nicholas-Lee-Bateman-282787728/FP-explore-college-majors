7849519,4,6303521061,"The 1994 production seems to rework some of Barrett's previous footage with expanded coverage on what we may encounter outside our solar system and galaxy.  Unlike other Barrett all music productions, Stewart narrates.  The sound may have perhaps been mixed better, as it sometimes abruptly drops to make way for narration, and sometimes it doesn't seem to drop at all.

This is only available on DVD currently in the Star Trek Next Generation-Jean-Luc Picard Collection.",1425340800,,471,5.253333333333333
7849520,5,6303521061,"YES, IT MAY BE DATED, BUT THIS MOVIE IS STILL GREAT FOR AN INTRO TO OUR OUR SOLAR SYSTEM & HELPS REALLY CAPTURE THE NATURE OF WHAT IT IS LIKE IF YOU WERE ABLE TO WALK ON EACH OF THE PLANETS ORBITING OUR SUN. I FELT IT WAS JUST LIKE BEING AT THE OBSERVATORY.",1364774400,,257,3.7777777777777777
7849521,3,6303521061,"While I enjoyed much of this VHS video, which I recently picked up at Goodwill for 2 dollars, this 1994 feature falls flat here in the modern decade of the Tens. The pictures and particularly the renderings are poor by today's standards, so don't expect to be visually wowed. The film is also hampered by some outdated information and lackluster script. That is not to say that I walked away from it disappointed. I learned several new things, enjoyed the mental trip into the cosmos, and the score was mostly decent. This is a film I would feel quite comfortable showing to a young mind who desires to be opened to the wonders of the universe, but I would highly recommend follow up research after seeing it to get the full picture of what we understand today.

The video starts with some promos to sell Star Trek VHS tapes, then Patrick Stewart's voice over begins. Patrick's audio performance is top-notch, like all of his works. He tells the viewer that he will be taking them on a ""ship of the imagination"" (The term Carl Sagan used in his Cosmos series) across the universe. He briefly talks about the outer planets as the viewer ""passes"" them, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto. (Uranus is barefacedly skipped as 'off the route'), and then moves on to the Oort Cloud. The film is divided into segments, beginning with an intro title of white text on a black background. The Outer Planets. The Oort Cloud. The Road To Alpha Centauri. Seti. Etc.

This is where the film shows it's age. Our galaxy is ""suspected"" to have a black hole at the center. It's stated as a mystery whether the universe will expand forever or collapse (we've learned it will keep expanding). Extra solar planets are referenced hopefully, with the best evidence given as a gap in a star's dust belt. 1994 suddenly seems so long ago. And I burst out laughing when the ship of the imagination travels into an inescapable black hole, and Stewart mentions that since the black hole is (fortunately enough) rotating, the viewer could escape through a wormhole to the Andromeda galaxy.

If this subject interests you, and you know very little about space, this is worth a view. If you're already quite educated on space and are craving more, I just have one thing to remind you: ""1994""!",1324857600,,2259,4.6708542713567835
7849522,2,6303521061,"I have to agree with the other 2-star reviewer--this video is corny and outdated.  There are some interesting parts and pretty pictures, but most of it is pure speculation (the hypothetical Oort cloud and SETI, to give two examples) and rather melodramatic.  I'm sure there are better space videos/DVDs out there.  Guess I'll keep looking!",1187395200,,339,5.127272727272727
7849523,2,6303521061,"I don't know what planet the other reviewers are on but it's certainly not this one.  I waited months in anticipation for this 'rave-review-video' but it is so cheesy!  Factually it is OK but the graphics and whole flow of the documentary are 50 years out of date.  I was really, really disappointed especially since it had my hero from Startrek narrating it.  Primary School astronomy classes might appreciate it but not grown adults with real money to spend on much more worthy videos.",1140912000,,487,4.761904761904762
7849524,5,6303521061,"""From Here To Infinity"" is one of the best astronomical displays I've seen, short of going to the Adler Planetarium. The Journey begins at home Planet Earth and ends with a return home but with an increased sense of wonder that speaks to the uniqueness preciousness of Life here. I love it, but my autistic son loves it even more. Its combination of breathtaking visuals and classical music never fail to capture his attention and keep him entertained through the full length of the tape. Wonderful stuff.",990403200,3,505,4.816091954022989
7849525,5,6303521061,If you've seen Patrick Stewart narrates The Planets you know the collaboration between award winning director Don Barrett and popular actor Patrick Stewart is sensational.  Both have outdone themselves with a spectacular voyage to the ends of the Universe. Stewart's work is polished and close to perfect.  His voice mirrors the emotion of the work.  Barrett is perhaps the most artistic director working.  Don't miss this video from Paramount.,986774400,,444,5.391304347826087
7849526,5,6303521061,"Forget those boring Nova's and Discovery Channel shows, From Here to Infinity combines art and science to take the viewer to edge of the known Universe, with some interesting stops along the way.  Definitely the best documentary of its type I've ever seen, it was world premiered at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, the only commercial product to ever receive such an honor.  TV Guide and Billboard gave it Best of the Year.  Don't miss this title!!",980899200,,443,4.802631578947368
7849527,5,6303521061,"Director Don Barrett and Patrick Stewart have combined again to create a  masterpiece.  As its predecessor (Patrick Stewart narrates The Planets) the  entire production is cut to music.  This time Patrick takes the viewer  beyond the solar system to the edge of the known universe.  Spectacular  Computer Animation makes it all so believable.
Audio is exceptional;  worth the price of the video alone.",964483200,,401,5.253968253968254
