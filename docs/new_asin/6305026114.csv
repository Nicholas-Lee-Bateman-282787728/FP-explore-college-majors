7881391,2,6305026114,"Perhaps you're like me. You are a night owl (a nice way of saying insomniac), you get bored in the middle of the night but don't feel like going to sleep, and knowing that, you often buy stuff like THIS. Also, naturally, you enjoy documentary type programs on ghosts and other supernatural creatures, and often get a little tired of the way The Travel Channel, Discovery, History Channel, and TLC keep running the same old ones over and over, and no one seems to show scary movies nowadays. I remember when that's all late night TV was! Well, anyway, so you bought, or are considering buying Werewolves and Apparitions. Well, here's the facts:
First off, don't expect high quality. The tapes are recorded on EP mode. The sound sometimes goes from Hifi to Mono and back repeatedly, something I have always found irritating, so much so that now I use SP whenever I record anything, so playing it on a different VCR won't give me that problem.
As for the programs, the Apparitions tape consists of two. The first is what you're looking for, true ghost stories. I found them to be rather interesting, though if you're looking for re-enactments or that sort of thing, don't expect them. Mainly it's interviews with people who have had experiences, and footage of the locations. The second program on the same tape is actually just a montage of moments from classic ""Ghost"" movies. Around a half hour of clips from films, so you can decide if you want to rent them I guess. The narration provides fun-facts about the films and/or real ghosts. It's interesting, but only to someone who is very interested in films, and/or ghosts.
  The second tape, the one on werewolves, is a bit more disappointing. It's sort of a combination of the two styles of programs on the previous tape, but mainly the second one. Here we have MOSTLY scenes from Werewolf movies, interesting ones though, no doubt, with a narrator giving facts about both real werewolf legend AND the films being shown. There is also a part that shows footage and interviews of a man actually accused of being a werewolf in the 20th century, so that was fairly interesting. Once again, if you are a werewolf and/or film nut, as I am, you may find these tapes interesting on a boring night. Otherwise, these tapes may bore you even further.
  PS: If you're curious about what John Travolta's brother looks like, he is some kind of ""host"" for these videos. He pops in during the videos for his little commentaries, but there's not much to them. Obviously they just wanted a ""name"" to use in their productions. So, still considering buying the set? Well, it's better than a kick in the head.",1024444800,3,2640,4.670967741935484
