8148650,2,B000J14SJE,"Gosh, I put this on for my 2 1/2 year old grandson and I was very unhappy with the violent actions and depictions of a mean poodle and mean penguins as well as the hostile Granny!  My grandson was fascinated 'cuz he's never seen such a thing before and I can tell you right now he won't see it again 'til he's MUCH OLDER!  This is not a cute, cuddly story for young ones!  It's my own fault for not reading more closely what the movie is about - I guess many adults and older kids may find this movie funny, it just doesn't do anything for me as an adult...",1326240000,2,557,4.0
8148651,5,B000J14SJE,"If you're a Penguins of Madagascar fan, this is a MUST.  It's now packaged along with Merry Madagascar [...], but it's been re-packaged with a different title on the box.  Buy it, you'll love it!!!  We've seen it about 3 dozen times and it's always funny.",1259539200,5,255,4.5
8148652,5,B000J14SJE,"Even though I've never seen Dreamwork's movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madagascar-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JNX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madagascar (Widescreen Edition)</a>, a friend picked up this gem when purchasing the full-length movie for his kids.

The story-line centers around the ""Private"" going out to find a Christmas present for a lonely polar bear.  When the Private is mistook for a doggie chewtoy by a kindly old woman (okay, she's not all that kind) the rest of the Penguin troup must save him.  Enter ""Mr. Chew"" the kindly old woman's cute fluffy poodle (okay, she's not kind, and the dog is somewhat vicious.)

No bad language, no skin (except for Penguin skin, but of course, it's in black and white,) and only one expellation of flatulence (Penguin, of course.)

This video gets a 5/5 rating for great animation, hilarious story, and leaving the viewer with a deep desire to see more stories about the Penguins, and hopefully Mr. Chew, too!

In case you're wondering, THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL VIDEO FOR YOUR HOLIDAY COLLECTION!  [Caution:  Do not watch if you have had recent surgery as the incessant laughing you will experience might pull out your stitches.]",1180396800,10,1231,5.616216216216216
