8444176,3,B004VWKD46,"When I went to college in the early 1990s, reports from TX said that parents were sending hitman after high school students who threatened their own children's chances of being on the football team.  Students from TX said with shame, ""Yes.  They breed football players in our state.""  I thought this doc would be about that trend.  However, it's different.  This work said that some high school teams are training so intensely that members are dying, facing brain damage, or suffering from other disabilities.

The work said there have always been tragedies in football, but things have amped up over the past decade.  College rules so players can only practice 20 hours a week, but high schools don't have those rules.  People are being recruited for college ball in junior high.  Parents are making fancy video ads for their sons as they apply to colleges.

This was an eye-opener, but I did wonder about some things.  This work only showed Arkansas and Texas.  Is this controversy only regional?  There is a consistent message of ""win at all costs,"" however, the work never says if players are taking steroids and if their coaches are looking the other way.  At one point, a private school played a public one.  The private school was almost entirely white, but the public school had far more black and brown faces.  The public school did what looked like a Maori haka before they played.  I wonder how race plays into this?  Many families of color have worried that getting athletic scholarships will be the only way their children can afford college, yet that doesn't come up here.

The students here said, ""I know about the risks, but I just love, love, love playing football!""  I heard that from football players in college and high school, so that seems like it's an unchanging view.",1305936000,,1791,4.771986970684039
