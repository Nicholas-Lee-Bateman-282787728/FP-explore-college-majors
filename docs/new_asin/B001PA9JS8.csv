3745320,5,B001PA9JS8,"Frances books were some of my favorites as a young child.  I am excited that my children can enjoy the books and this adorable DVD.  Everyone in the family enjoys watching it.  My sixteen-month-old daughter asks for it by saying, ""Badger!  Badger!"" and pointing at the TV.  Even my oldest child, who is nearly seven, finds the DVD fun and amusing.  He actually laughs out loud at it.  It's rare to find something so well enjoyed by a variety of ages, with no objectionable language for the youngest ones.  I never imagined that it would be such a hit with my family!",1264723200,5,566,4.480392156862745
3745321,1,B001PA9JS8,"The Frances books are special and amazing for two main reasons:

1) Incredibly honest and enjoyable story-lines
2) Distinctive, ""old-school"" illustrations

This movie is NOT what Frances is about! My childhood is officially over.",1264032000,,229,5.705882352941177
3745322,5,B001PA9JS8,"This product was great, and it really helped, because I couldn't find any Frances DVDs anywhere. My nephew can't go to sleep without it. Thank you.",1245024000,3,147,4.6923076923076925
3745323,5,B001PA9JS8,"My son and I have been awaiting this DVD release since we saw the previews on a Thomas DVD a couple of years ago.  Everytime we watched the Thomas DVD (which is aLOT) he'd ask for it and I have been looking for it and finally it was released!  He loves it and I think Frances is so cute, she is always getting herself into predicaments but learns a lesson in the end.  Frances is very funny and mischievous and has quite the imagination.  Oh and her little sister Gloria is adorable.",1239926400,5,483,4.217391304347826
3745334,5,B001PA9JS8,My granddaughter really enjoys this. She is 3 1/2 years old. The book adds to the experience. I would like to find another DVD and book combo.,1345507200,,142,4.296296296296297
3745335,5,B001PA9JS8,"My daughter gets sucked into cartoons and watches them over and over, so it's hard to get her to try something new. But the moment we started Frances, I knew she'd found a new favorite. And I have too.

What sets Frances apart from the other shows is that this character is a perfect representation of a 3 year-old. She lives in the same little world as my daughter, and the same things are important to her. For example, when you first meet her, she shows you her nightlight and her boo boo. My daughter sees herself in Frances, and also sees how her antics affect the rest of the family. It's great entertainment, and a learning tool without any condescension.

I really wish there were more installments. The wiki says there was going to be a second DVD... where is it?",1345420800,2,772,4.429577464788732
3745336,5,B001PA9JS8,"We've been watching this video on our instant stream via Netflix.  My 3 and 4 year olds LOVE it, and we, the parents have enjoyed it, too.  I loved these books as a child and although it took a little time to adjust to the 3-D version of Frances, which is rather slick, I got past it because the stories were so well done.  They are true to the books, but in some ways better, because we get to hear the tunes that Frances sings her songs to.  They teach great lessons, to the point that we have referred to them in our regular lives.  Recently, an outing was canceled because one child was sick.  Both kids were devastated.  I reminded them that this was just what had happened in Frances, and both kids got it.  Also, since watching these, my 4-yr old now says stuff like, ""I need some alone time,"" and she also now makes up her own songs about the injustice of the world, just like Frances.  I love these videos.  I wish there were more.  I would buy them in a heartbeat.",1328918400,5,974,4.182795698924731
3745337,5,B001PA9JS8,"My two year old loves this show and I love watching it with her.  The stories are simple and easy to follow and they teach a lesson.  The voices are so cute and the whole show is done really well, I just wish they would come out with another new one.",1319673600,,250,3.8823529411764706
3745338,5,B001PA9JS8,My 1 1/2 year old nephew loves this DVD. Frances was on demand and then it was gone and he was asking for Frances constantly. I ordered this and it arrived in 2 days. He watches it everyday. The book and the video don't look alike which is confusing for him but he is enjoying the book too.,1313884800,,290,4.017241379310345

3745340,5,B001PA9JS8,I came to amazon.com to see if there were anymore Frances DVDs to buy for my 3 year old daughter who LOVES this film. We have not read any of the books yet but I plan to check some out on our next library visit.,1306195200,,211,3.7111111111111112
3745341,5,B001PA9JS8,"I remember reading the Frances books during my preschool-early second grade years, so I was excited to see this movie was available on streaming through Nexflix. I'm happy to say that I'm very impressed. The plot is enhanced through dialogue and catchy songs to classical tunes. This is great for any age.

3745342,5,B001PA9JS8,It's apparent that the writers of this show had kids. Frances has the wandering mind of the average imaginative child and it makes me giggle cause she is just like my daughter.,1292976000,5,176,4.53125

8332797,4,B001PA9JS8,"My daughter (who first saw this movie around age 2, she's now 3) loves Frances. I really wish this DVD were available for less than nearly $40. I have seen it going for around $72 at the most, which is ridiculous. We first discovered Frances when this movie was available on our Netflix streaming account. But they took it down, so we looked all over for a DVD we could purchase. Unfortunately this is expensive and way beyond our budget for something like a kid's DVD. They don't carry it at our library either, so we just rent the dvd from Netflix.

The DVD has autoplay (stick it in the dvd player and walk away, the feature plays without you making menu selections) and there's only one or two previews before the feature. After the feature there's a bonus episode of a show called Fifi and the Flowertots (I think it's somewhat popular in the UK) which I personally dislike but it's not inappropriate for children and some kids might enjoy it.

The movie is made up of three short stories, ""A Whiny Sister for Frances"", ""A Cupcake for Frances"", and ""Bedtime for Frances"". The stories are based on a series of books about Frances by Russell Hoban. Each episode has a lot of songs (to the tune of classical pieces, mostly) and dancing. They're pretty upbeat and teach some kind of lesson. Frances is a member of a family of badgers (a mom, dad, and toddler sister) and she is very much like a typical kid. She's a little whiney, but all kids whine at some point. While it may grate on your own nerves, kids do respond better to other kids who are like them and who they identify with. The animation is computer generated with lots of bright colors and movement, but the quality isn't so great at times.

In ""A Whiny Sister for Frances"", her sister Gloria gets the flu so the family can't go to 'Lizard Land' as they had planned. Frances is disappointed that her parents won't leave Gloria at home and just take Frances, but learns that it wouldn't be fun to go on a trip without Gloria.

In ""A Cupcake for Frances"", Frances' mother is giving a piano recital and making cupcakes for all the students in the recital. Frances wants two cupcakes, and while her mother isn't around she steals on belonging to her friend Albert. She also eats a ton of cupcake toppings when she's supposed to be decorating them. Frances justifies the theft in her own mind by being jealous of Albert spending time with Frances' mom, his piano teacher. Her parents find out that she stole a cupcake, but instead of flat out accusing her of stealing it and then punishing her, they leave it to her to work it out on her own. I guess to see if she will confess later after thinking about it. (Probably something I, as a parent, would only do after my child reached a certain age)

So Frances eventually realizes that what she did was wrong (she gets stomach-ache from all the sugar and I suppose it triggers her inner guilt, along with what her parents told her, plus she speaks with Albert and he is really friendly and sweet to her) and makes things right by giving her own cupcake to Albert. Instead of punishing her, her mom tells her that she's proud she did the right thing. Frances confesses to her mom that she had lied and in the end everything is okay.

I really disagree with the reviewer who said that Frances gets away with it. She felt guilt and made things right with Albert on her own, with little guidance from her parents. At a certain age, all kids should be able to do this. She confessed to her mom which would be humbling for any child, and I think it's good to praise a child for fixing their own mistakes after they do something wrong. Why should she be punished if she fixed things on her own? What would be the point? If she had just eaten the cupcake and and continued to lie, then that would be a reason for punishment and to teach her that lying and stealing is wrong, etc.

In ""Bedtime for Frances"", Frances doesn't want to go to bed. She ends up freaking herself out in a number of ways about things in the dark in her room (a tiger in the closet, a giant which is really a pile of dirty clothes, a crack in the ceiling, the wind blowing the curtains) and she's genuinely afraid. With the patience of sainthood, her parents gently help her get past her fears while reminding her that she needs to go to sleep. Finally her dad is just about on the edge of losing his patience with her, so he tells her that its her 'job' to go to bed so she'll be ready for school. He also says he'll be angry with her if she doesn't go to bed. In order to please her parents, Frances makes an effort to get over her fears and just go to sleep. When she wakes up in the morning she has a ton of energy and is happy.

I really feel like the lessons in each story are meant more for an elementary school child, maybe ages 6-8. Old enough to know the difference between right and wrong, concepts of honesty/truth and family love, and to independently brush their own teeth, go to their beds, lay down, and sleep. Most kids can't be expected to do these things or understand these concepts until they are at least in kindergarten or some short time after. However, the way the show is set up, the animation style, etc makes it seem like it's meant for a younger child like a toddler or preschooler. I somewhat doubt that the target audience would be interested in the show because of its production. Maybe they did this to make it more friendly for older and younger siblings to watch together? I don't know.

My daughter is entertained by this show so I allow her to watch it, but at her age I doubt she is actually learning anything from it because she is not developmentally ready to understand many of the concepts the creators were attempting to teach in these short stories.",1421020800,2,5766,4.371268656716418
8332798,1,B001PA9JS8,DVD shipped late and  poor video quality. it had VCD quality. I paid for over price...for what i got.,1407196800,,101,4.315789473684211
8332799,5,B001PA9JS8,"We watched this on Netflix for a while when the grandchildren visited.  It was such a hit for all ages...Even the adults love it!  When it was no longer available on Netflix, we were all so disappointed.  I had to find a DVD, which was easier said than done.  We are so glad this wonderful DVD was finally found here at a reasonable price.  It includes 3 different stories with moral lessons and realistic situations for children.  We could ALL relate.  I also loved that it includes a little classical music.  Just makes me smile!",1400198400,,531,4.515789473684211
8332800,1,B001PA9JS8,"It's only vaguely cute. This little brat whines a lot, and even after stealing a cupcake (despite giving the owner her own cupcake) she gets away with it. There is no 'stealing is wrong' talk or anything. I'm sorry, but I don't think she should get off scot-free with only a 'we're glad you told the truth.' Not a good example for kids.

Oh, and the part with her sick sister. I know she's not that old, but really, throwing a fit like that?

She recites the alphabet later in this movie...and leaves two letters out. If you're trying to teach your kid the alphabet, do not let them see this.",1389571200,,592,4.324324324324325
8332801,5,B001PA9JS8,This show kind of annoyed me at first but it has really grown on me and especially my two-year old baby girl. I was hoping to get her more as we are watching it several times a day now on Netflix but was disappointed to find out only one DVD was made. Maybe I'll mention it on FB if The Jim Henson Company has a page.,1367280000,,317,3.8181818181818183
8332802,5,B001PA9JS8,"The whole family really enjoys this dvd.  Fun stories and songs that I don't mind listening to over and over and over and over. This is currently the two year olds favorite, and the 4 and 5 year old enjoy it as well.  Really hope there are more to come.",1362009600,2,253,4.04

8332804,5,B001PA9JS8,This show was a great find!  I'm pretty picky about what I let my three year old watch.  She is very sensitive to conflict but this show does a great job of introducing and resolving Frances' problems. It is our favorite show. I would LOVE to see more episodes!,1357776000,,261,4.3061224489795915
