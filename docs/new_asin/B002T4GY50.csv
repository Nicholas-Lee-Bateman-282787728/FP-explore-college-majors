3983507,3,B002T4GY50,I really enjoyed this offering from Spike Lee. I am a fan and will watch anything that he does. But this was a very good film. I do wish I could have seen this live; but the DVD is better than not seeing it at all.,1266105600,,214,3.6739130434782608
3983508,5,B002T4GY50,"I purchased this DVD after stumbling upon the play on PBS's Great Performances.  I switched channels during an NFL playoff time-out, and was so riveted I could not return to the game.  At the end of the show PBS mentioned it was available on DVD, and within 10 minutes I had it ordered.  What's funny is that I didn't realize I had missed the play's first half until purchasing the DVD - so to me that was a bonus.

Spike Lee's camera work perfectly captured the stage play, and I've been repeatedly impressed during subsequent viewings.  I've been recommending it all of my friends, and through this review am recommending it to strangers as one of those rare movies you buy rather than rent.",1265932800,8,693,4.556451612903226
3983509,5,B002T4GY50,"I saw Passing Strange at Berkeley Rep before it went to Broadway.  I went with my twenty-something son and we both loved it.

Passing Strange is a coming of age tale full of intelligence and sly, self-deprecating humor.  It's also genre bending - neither musical or rock opera.  Spike Lee has done a great job of capturing and even intensifying the show.  It's got punk rock fu, Baptist fashion show fu, German nihilist fu.  Roger Bob says check it out.",1265932800,5,453,4.6
3983510,5,B002T4GY50,"This play (and this DVD was made directly from the Broadway play) is simply the finest work I have ever seen.  Each actor brings her or his own special talents and the sum is far greater than the parts.  Stew is brilliant and poignant and real, with the courage to bleed.  This is his story and its intelligence, importance, humor, anger, love and redemption will draw you in and not let you go.  The dancing and the singing are unlike any other you will see-this show rocks and there is just no way that you can stop yourself from rocking with it.

 You will never forget Passing Strange-I thank Stew, his band (Heidi sings like an angel) and the phenomenal cast (they are all amazing, but Daniel Breaker is a force of his own and I am not sure that it is fair that one person should be allowed to have that much talent) for what each has given me and continues to give every time I watch the DVD.

You owe it to yourself to own Passing Strange.  Rock on!",1265932800,6,956,4.2430939226519335
3983511,5,B002T4GY50,"I watched this movie on Public Broadcasting and was amazed. Truly the best peice of art on video I have even seen in my life. AMAZING AMAZING music, theater and story line. LOVED it and bought it that night after watching it. Really protrays peoples lifes at one point or another.",1263772800,6,280,4.509803921568627
3983512,3,B002T4GY50,I thought the live show was better.  I saw it 8 times at the Public Theater and 1x while it was on Broadway.  I thought that Spike Lee could have done a better job.  I think he missed alot in the shots he picked.... The movie made me wonder if he saw it live before he filmed it.  Sorry...but I was really disappointed.  I wanted to like the movie but didn't.....,1262476800,3,363,4.056338028169014
3983513,5,B002T4GY50,"I also saw the show on Broadway in 2008 and absolutely loved it. I was excited to hear that Spike Lee had filmed the last performance on Broadway and that it was planned for a DVD release.  However, I was skeptical - the show was so high energy and engaging; I didn't know if it would translate to the small screen.

I saw the film at SXSW 2009 and thought that Lee did an excellent job at capturing the energy and emotion of the show. There were times when I was dancing in my seat - the same points where I was dancing in my seat at the Belasco. You may not have heard of this show, but I encourage you to get the DVD and see for yourself - it's really good. It'll be well-worth the cost of the DVD.",1261872000,29,701,3.9645390070921986
3983514,5,B002T4GY50,I saw this film at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival on a big screen. Spike Lee artfully captures the final night's performance of this Broadway show. Excellent camera angles and lighting make Stew's outstanding score and the energetic performances of the actors and singers all that much more enjoyable.  Well worth seeing!,1261267200,20,322,5.1923076923076925
3983515,5,B002T4GY50,"Saw the show off and then on Broadway, and was ready to be disappointed by yet another stage-to-screen taping. I could not have been more wrong. Spike Lee's talent is so evident in every angle of this film, bringing you as close as humanly possible to the experience of seeing it live.",1260316800,20,285,4.5
3983529,5,B002T4GY50,Absolutely perfect,1443139200,,18,8.5
3983530,5,B002T4GY50,"Stew is a phenomenal master of phrasing, hearing his words was worth the price of this dvd alone.
The cast is extraordinarily good.  It took me a while to get used to the set-up as the cast are initially playing teenagers which seemed forced, but as the play progresses, you can see the breadth of their acting spectrum, and it is full-tilt wide open, especially Coleman Domingo, whom I can't begin to describe how much depth he added with his three character performances (each cast member plays several roles through out the journey).
I remember seeing Stew around Los Angeles in the early 90's, and was surprised when I heard of this Broadway smash hit.  What a long way he has come since playing Goldfinger's (a 30-40 person dive bar in Hollywood) on the same bill as The Sugarplastic and other local acts of that time.",1441497600,2,823,4.63013698630137

3983538,5,B002T4GY50,"This is one of the most powerful on-screen works I've ever seen.  Like a number of people here, I encountered it by accident while flipping through the channels trying to find something not an insult to my intelligence and taste, and happening on Passing Strange blew me out of my seat.  High original, funny, poignant, deep, it's so good I had to buy the DVD immediately, and I''ve watched it three times since I bought it and am today compelled to look everything up I can find about it online.  One of the best DVD buys I've ever made.  It is NOT a filmed stage play, it's an actual film, a genuine work of cinematic art made by Spike Lee taking his cameras up on stage and using what only a finely directed crew of cameramen can capture -- a real movie, out of a work that won a Tony for Best Book In A Musical.  And unlike most of the few Broadway musicals I've seen in the past few years, this one HAS a book, a narrative, an actual story, performed by some wonderful actors -- Rebecca Naomi Jones and Coleman Domingo especially are dynamite in their roles, but it is the ensemble (including the Passing Strange band) as a whole, and Spike Lee himself, that make the whole thing a standout experience.  Thank God Spike Lee saw the play and had the enthusiasm, talent, and business savvy to make this all happen.  One of my black friends, also a playwright, having seen the play Off-Broadway, sort of reluctantly watched the DVD in my living room, expecting, she said, to be disappointed, but she was forced to admit afterward that the film really heightened her appreciation of the work.  In other words, she liked the piece better when Spike Lee's magic brought it to vibrant life (up close, for instance, you can see the kind of magic Rachel Naomi Jones can work just with her eyes).  In a culture rapidly growing more and more anemic (not to mention dismaying), this is the kind of thing that revitalizes my inner self and keeps me going.",1421539200,,1947,4.461971830985916

3983551,5,B002T4GY50,"I was introduced to this by my wife, who had the benefit of seeing this production live some years ago, before we had met.  I am a big fan of classic musicals (e.g. Rodgers and Hammerstein), and though there are some rock musicals that I love (JC Superstar, Rent), I still tend to view that segment of the genre with a bit of suspicion.  Passing Strange, however, has proved itself a classic.  The story is very personal, but with universal appeal; the music is varied in style and consistently interesting both lyrically and melodically.  The acting and singing are first rate - there are no singers who act or actors who sing, there are only singer/actors here, and great ones. I've now bought copies for multiple friends.",1402531200,3,724,4.677165354330708

3983555,5,B002T4GY50,"Truly one of the best theatrical works presented on film. The music - which I had NO expectations of even bearing, let alone being blown away by - defies any categorization other than that it is uniquely, beautifully, ALIVE.
The performances are flawless, and the whole experience of watching it is nothing short of sublime.
I am a fan of classic musical theatre, and no fan of ""rock"" musicals, but this absolutely blew me away.",1379030400,,428,4.72
3983556,5,B002T4GY50,"I was flipping the channels after school one late night and seen it on PBS right around the middle and was instantly into it. I had never seen a Broadway and was never interested in seeing one. But I could relate to the main character and what he was going through. I kept coming home and and catching it in the middle, finally I skipped school one night to catch it from the beginning and it was amazing. The small quotes by the narrator ""life is a movie starring you, your family and friends are the casting crew"", beautiful. The ending with the mother, that hit home. Its long but worth it. I recommend if your trying to find your purpose in life, see this play for inspiration of what to and what not to do in life!",1375574400,,719,4.217391304347826

3983558,5,B002T4GY50,"What a great way to document the end of an amazing show! There isn't anything I hated about it. Loved the angles (on how you didn't see another camera in the shot), lighting, sound- all of it. Stew's semi-autobiographical masterpiece is at home on DVD. It still sounds and looks as fresh and clean as it ever did. I recommend viewing it at least twice to take it all in so that the subject matter will sink in. I identified so much with ""Youth"" and some of the other characters, it was almost like seeing my life story. Amazing talent on every aspect of this project.",1364256000,2,567,4.3584905660377355

3983571,5,B002T4GY50,"First off I'm a hugh Stew fan and it goes without saying thst Spike Lee is one of the most important film makers today, ok with that said this was one of the best pieces I've seen in years. Incredibly thoughtful these people are so good words fail but words I must write. This is the best rock opera to date if I must call it that. It transends the color barrier, what I mean is I white but I related to so much of this I just saw some wonderful people perform their hearts out. This is a must see for anyone that has taken a breath, I guess that kinda includes everyone. Stew is incredible I don't think since Zappa has anyone put humor and life together so well and then put it to some wonderful melodies. I really love thia guy and his band. Stew and Heidi make a wonderful pair, a current day Lennon and McCartney.",1354060800,,818,4.11875
3983572,5,B002T4GY50,"Filming a stage play is a fool's game; you can't capture the power, intimacy and intensity of a great live show. Spike Lee played that fool's game and won. This is an amazing movie.",1325462400,3,181,4.352941176470588

3983575,5,B002T4GY50,"I don't typically write reviews as a consumer.  However, I am so proud of the presentation of Passing Strange I had to say something.  This is one of the best musicals I have ever seen...saw it on Broadway too!!  The storytelling, the music, the actors' performances were all at such a dynamic quality. And it's a story that most everyone can relate to or be touched by on some level.  And Kudos to Spike for capturing the essence of this great musical!",1301097600,4,453,4.487804878048781
3983576,5,B002T4GY50,"I saw this show during its run on Broadway.  I am not your average theater-goer, however this show changed my perspective and point of view of Broadway shows.  An amazing story, amazing score, and unbelievable cast.  Rebecca Naomi Jones was phenomenal in this show, and she will be a break out star.  Daniel Breaker is also outstanding and moving with his performance.

I'm not a huge fan of Spike Lee, but to his credit, he did an excellent job capturing the closing night performance of this show without getting in the way.  It is an excellent capture of a moment in time, and an unbelievably moving story.  There are genuine laughs, genuine connections, and genuine emotions in this story.  Excellent job Stew!!  You made a fan of a non-Broadway guy!!",1294444800,3,755,4.746153846153846
3983577,5,B002T4GY50,"Saw this show multiple times on Broadway, and was fortunate to be present for the final performance.  A moving, powerful story, funny, smart and insightful, made even better by great music that really rocks.  Actors are amazing, musicianship is incredible; the best theatrical experience of my life.  And like others, wary after some previous attempts to film musicals failed miserably, not sure how the movie would turn out.  Spike Lee does a great job making the viewer feel exactly like I did sitting in the front row for the last show.  Camera angles, sound quality, a few glimpses behind the scenes, all combine to make this a great movie as well as a great show.  You will want to leap up from your chair and dance around the room with the cast at the curtain call.  Don't miss this show & movie!",1287878400,5,802,4.605633802816901
3983578,5,B002T4GY50,"One of the best Broadway shows I have ever seen. Saw it twice, including the night before the Tony's (a co-favorite, it lost out to ""In The Heights"" for Best Musical). That particular performance was the most electric night I have had in the theatre. I say this as a theatre-going veteran. I also interviewed Daniel Breaker while I was working at an area radio station. He was a terrific guy to talk with and very humble and affable.

Sadly, the awkward performance at the Tony's did not let people see the real genius of the show. Having seen the movie, Spike Lee recreated the energy and excitement of the original production. During the show's intermission, he goes backstage to give you an insight into the actors.

Anyone who loves Broadway musicals must own this. It is absolutely brilliant, heartbreaking, and incredibly inspirational.

As I wrote...a work of genius...both the musical, and the filming of it.",1283817600,3,916,4.858974358974359
3983579,5,B002T4GY50,"This is one of the most creative musicals ever, and Spike Lee has done a fabulous job of bringing the spontaneity, energy and creativity to the screen for those of us who didn't get to see it at Berkeley Rep (where it was incubated and launched) or Broadway. The cast are each uber-talented and Stew won a Tony for ""best book"" in 2008, which he so deserved. The writing and music are so intricately interwoven, but never come off as anything other that a free-form rock-n-roll story. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this!",1283299200,2,506,4.510869565217392
3983580,5,B002T4GY50,"I saw this on PBS one night while flipping through the channels.  Landed in the middle of the story and had NO IDEA what I was watching.  ""Is this a poetry show?  Wait, is it spoken word with music?  Then there are these German accents.  And then, Oh, wait there's a story and singing and hilarity!""  I was drawn in and further in and I have to say it was the most fantastic accidental viewing experience I've ever had flipping through channels.

The story is compelling and asks a lot of questions about what's ""real"" or important in life.  It's a journey that anyone who's done any soul seeking will be able to relate too.  I'm really glad this was captured on film.  As too often happens with theater, the performance entirely evaporates into the ether at the curtain call - and if you weren't physically there (in NY in the short span of time the show played), then you're S.O.L.

Furthermore, the music is so good, you're prompted to wonder, ""Why have I never heard this guy before?  Where has he been?"" -- unless of course you're already familiar with Stew's work (He did put out 6 albums before the cast album, all of which are worthwhile).  The reviewer here who called the work ""self-indulgent"" is COMPLETELY off base.  Introspective, yes.  And moving and provocative.  I think that guy probably didn't get the humor or the many rich references.

3983584,5,B002T4GY50,"This play is about ""passing"" for something you're not.

 A black male who grows up middle class, preppy, with a single mother in South Central,LA (the hood- black american slum). He is into rock music and talks proper, but has no white friends. Despite being in the church choir he spokes weed with the rest of the members. He goes to Amsterdam in search of himself wooing women into thinking he is this black american gangster (passing) when really he is a nerd that is frequently passed up by black girls back home in search of their tupac shakur types and jocks. His mother who forces him to go to church yet avoids going herself calls asking when he will return home.

 But, to him home is not where you grow up or where your parents live, but where you are most at peace. This play is so deep and so beyond race and culture. Anyone who loves the arts or is currently going through growing pains I strongly suggest to see this play. As well as anyone who struggles with overthinking or social anxiety. This play is about stereotypes and trying to find yourself and place in the world. Something we all as humans can relate to. Spike lee did it big with this one. I love that it raises questions about stereotypes without the militant/aggressive tone spike lee tends to have in his movies. Yet, the passion is still there without offending even the most faint at heart.  I saw it live in nyc and had premium seats. It was so exciting being in the front row and stew even included me in one of the skits where he had to engaged the audience. I froze for a sec, lol.",1273622400,9,1567,4.352739726027397

Fantastic cast and band. I didn't see this live, but enjoyed the Spike Lee interpretation. Too bad the run has ended. At least we have this.",1270857600,2,449,4.555555555555555
3983587,2,B002T4GY50,"It's difficult to imagine what the few ""taste makers"" who flogged this lame ego piece to a failed Broadway run saw in the performances they saw Off-Broadway to try and make it the darling of the artistic set or what anyone other than a press agent or Spike Lee sycophant sees in this problematic DVD first shown (on the release date of the DVD) on PBS. Welcoming ""rock"" musicians back to theatre writing is an admirable, even essential idea, but it's best done when the artist in question has a basic love for the theatre - or is persuaded to work with those who who at least know what they are doing. Try it with a self indulgent ""talent"" like Stew with a contempt for the genre (expressed explicitly at the cast album recording session and in this filmed performance which he makes clear will never be revived) and it's a recipe for disaster - which is what the Broadway run, recorded here at the closing performance, was.

During the run of what is essentially a rock concert with second or third tier ""rock"" music (there are three or four interesting ""character"" songs) hung on the barest of frameworks of Stew's reminiscences of self indulgent parts of his life (for which he won an indefensible Tony Award - the show's only!), we were told by many friends that Stew's cast album would have a virtual lock on the Grammy Award because ""everyone in the music business"" knew and loved Stew. That claim turned out to be a press agent's (or Stew's) fantasy - the album wasn't even nominated! With the death of the ""brick and mortar"" record and CD store where we could actually SEE who was selling ""in the bins"", skeptics were left wondering if Stew WAS even a successful rock artist, or just another ""wanna-be"" jazz musician with a good press agent.

This messily packaged film was only made because Stew WAS able to somehow persuade genius film maker Spike Lee that he (Stew) was another self made genius, and throw his name and money behind the project. Before seeing the result, there was considerable concern that the result might be just a documentary on the show without really SHOWING much of it. That fear at least was allayed. All that's here (other than the usual backstage features as ""extras"") is a filming of the closing performance - although it's an open question how much the viewer - even one who might have enjoyed the show - will GET it, given the WAY it's filmed. It's hard to determine from the finished product how much film maker Spike Lee was actually allowed to do. Rather than elevating the project to Lee's level of inventiveness, we're left with a bad concert badly filmed with madly illogical, unilluminating camera angles frequently blocking the story or the person actually singing, and close-ups which make 1950's television look sensitive and rarely adding any style or point of view to the event being filmed.

Any Broadway ""completist"" will have to have this - it was filmed in the beautiful Belasco Theatre with the cast that actually played the show for its 165 performances (Feb 28 - July 20, 2008), and the supporting cast at least is fully professional - even admirable. Daniel Breaker is particularly good as ""Youth"" (the Young Stew), the only actual ACTOR allowed to make much of an impression, although the close-ups and camera angles do him no favors - one gets the impression Stew (or someone) viewed him the way Andrew Lloyd Webber views lyricists whose work threatens to get noticed as much as his music, but at least Breaker was allowed to carry what there was of the show for the run.

It just isn't a very good show and very poorly filmed.",1267315200,3,3589,4.6472440944881885

Am a big Spike Lee fan, but wasn't sure how it would translate to film but it was amazing and packed the same intense emotional punch as the live show. Laughter, tears, intense soul candy.  I'm not much for most musical theatre but 'Passing Strange' is a revelation.",1266105600,2,321,4.35

8379836,5,B002T4GY50,"This is a must have musical/play. It appeals to ones musical, cultural, and challenges your understanding  of how ones desires shape who you are..... however, as it was said in the movie Avatar, ""I see you..."" A lot of literature, musical , civil rights, middle income America, racial division/ understanding references  and so much more. I purchases many many many copies and gave as gifts and suggested it to strangers as we speak about plays etc. I carry this with me......",1486339200,,476,4.864197530864198

I was so transfixed I couldn't take my eyes off it. The performance is near perfection. The idea of a narrator on stage with the characters and I won't reveal any surprises here - is brilliant. Stew is brilliant.  That Spike Lee filmed it during the very last performance of the show's Broadway run was also brilliant. The cast and audience were well aware that it was the ""Grand Finale"" and it only adds to the excitement. I bought the DVD for myself right away.  I'm buying the DVD as a gif for someone this Christmas. Another generation needs to watch this and pass it on.",1449964800,,722,4.462121212121212
