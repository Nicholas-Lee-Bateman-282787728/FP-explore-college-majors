I highly recommend this DVD for beginners like me.",1411603200,3,257,4.586956521739131
6637854,5,B00NBNS5XC,"I was given an preview copy of  ""A Beginner's Guide to Mindfulness Meditation"" and I did all of the meditations over the past two weeks.  I liked a couple of them so much I did them twice.  This DVD has definitely inspired me to try to incorporate meditation into my daily life. Ira makes it simple.  His instructions are clear. He makes meditation attainable and easy.",1410912000,15,369,4.545454545454546
6637855,5,B00NBNS5XC,"If at some point in your life, a medical professional gave you a bunch of expensive fish (or a xanax prescription), then watch this DVD and follow Ira's 10-day program to become a fisherman with mindfulness through meditation!

Ira guides you through his 10-day meditation program while gradually layering the techniques viewers need to continue their own practice. Ira simplifies major concepts that he explores more deeply in some of his other DVDS. This beginner's guide is a comprehensive introduction for people with little or no meditation experience; or an effective refresher for those constantly working to quiet the mind.",1410825600,13,631,5.31
6637856,5,B00NBNS5XC,I received an advanced copy of this DVD and it is definitely Ira's best and most accessible. The three introductory videos are very clear and easy to follow and  the ten day program is perfect for beginners.  I highly recommend it.,1410739200,3,231,4.609756097560975
6637857,5,B00NBNS5XC,"They say it takes meditation and a sangha (practicing with others)  for positive change to take place in the world.
By introducing various meditation methods and by taking the time to ""sit with you"", it seems Ira Israel brings both,
meditation and sangha, into your living room. His presentation inspires the discipline and gentle nudge it takes to resist
letting a restless and busy mind be in charge -giving a sense that you are not practicing alone and helping you develop the mindfulness it takes to cultivate soulful relating. It is a great way to start your mindfulness journey and get in touch with the timeless, formless body you -we all- are:  Soul.",1410480000,24,658,4.814159292035399

6637861,5,B00NBNS5XC,"Ira's approach to teaching meditation is perfect for the American consumer who may be reluctant
to investigate a practice antithetical to the typical USA-consumer mind-set. His DVD's are my go-to
gifts for friends and family, and they are always grateful. I recently attended one of his workshops
in Santa Monica. ( He's a favorite at Esalen!) and found him even more engaging in person than on
video. He is also downright hilarious, and when you're laughing how can you be closed off to new
ideas? You can't! If you have an opportunity to study with him in person, do it!

As a native of California, I grew up with a lot of eastern thought- both authentic  teachings and
the re-packaged Spiritual garbage variety.  I like teachers who know their  source  material before
adapting it for new audiences. You can respect Israel for  knowing the origins of the teachings
and making it fun to learn in the context of contemporary life. This is a teacher with a story we
can all relate to. He has a genuine passion to bring relief to those seeking methods  to tame the
busy or anxious mind - he'll guide you towards a deeper enjoyment of  the present. Check it out
all of his videos. I can't recommend one above the other.",1453507200,,1217,4.601851851851852
6637862,5,B00NBNS5XC,"This is the best meditation DVD because it gives so many options.  There's no ""one size fits all"" in meditation so it's awesome that Ira has aggregated so many different things to meditate on.  This is really perfect for beginners because it doesn't try to force one particular methodology.  I actually liked a few of the meditations so I've been switching it up, keeping it fresh.

It actually makes me feel incompetent because it seems so easy for other people to just sit there but my mind is always racing so I was very surprised and impressed that I could follow ""A Beginner's Guide to Mindfulness Meditation"" and then go through the 10 different meditations and try each one of them on to see which one worked for me.

6637877,5,B00NBNS5XC,"A Beginner's Guide to Mindfulness Meditation'' with Ira Israel is a unique feature-length wellness DVD designed to teach beginners everything they need to know in order to practice meditation, cultivate a peaceful  mind and reduce stress.  A new friend gave me her copyperhaps I appeared to be unfamiliar with mindfulness practicebut I enjoyed Iras style, and appreciated the visual diversity of his teachings set in a variety of interesting places,. Ira is warm, affable, and not the least bit intimidating or pompous with religiosity.
  From experience, I know that learning to meditate isn't necessarily fun, but its a lot less ponderous and complicated under Iras direction. While he reduces a massive tangle of conflicting advice to a series of clear approaches, he helps people understand that they are free to customize their own meditation strategy. Some teachers give you the impression that their way is thee way and I was glad to see Ira is not one of them.
  Im personally of the opinion that meditation is something you want to practice building into your life- and not just when you have peace, quiet and a pillow to sit on, but also when you are engaged in the busyness of modern life. Not to downplay the value of sustained sitting in silence, but stopping and breathing consciously in the midst of it all, can be very helpful if not transformative. This is why I was both surprised and pleased to see Ira teaching meditation from Grand Central Station!",1431648000,3,1469,4.903225806451613
6637878,5,B00NBNS5XC,"What a great DVD!

Ira is a truly gifted meditation teacher.
His instructions are clear and he has a way of making complex ideas very easy to digest.

I've practiced many types of meditation over the past 30 years and even though this DVD is meant as a Beginners Guide it is still a valuable resource for seasoned meditators as well.

I recommend it highly.",1431216000,5,357,4.461538461538462

6637880,1,B00NBNS5XC,"Noisy, unpleasant, distracting background sounds make this an uncomfortable video to watch, much less to use as an actual meditation guide.  For some reason the instructor, Ira Israel, opens EVERY segment with a painfully loud, piercing bell tone!  After the first shock, I began plugging my ears to get past it to the spoken part.  The production quality is not very good; he keeps saying, ""You know?"" after his sentences and in the first segment, to explain what mindfulness meditation is, he states,""Buddha was a Hindu, just as Jesus was a Jew"" then goes on to mention Buddha's philosophy about the mind.  What on earth does Jesus being a Jew have to do with anything???  His speech patterns, his odd verbal tangents, are distracting.  In the segment called Day One, he sits in Grand Central Station.  This is a 3-minute segment in which the viewer is supposed to join him in the practice, while the noise of crowds of people moving past him is constantly playing in the background.  After watching a few minutes of his introductions and meditation guidance, I found I was so tense that I finally shut off the dvd.  It's going to be returned.",1427673600,15,1145,4.742424242424242

The meditations really work and I love Ira's teaching style!  All the instructions are simple and detailed enough for beginners but at the same time stimulating and informative for seasoned meditators.  I developed greater awareness on my mind's habits through several techniques on tracking and labeling thoughts.  It feels like I took a beautiful stroll through my mysterious mind and developed a new understanding of its paths and obstacles which left me elevated and peaceful.

I had long been interested in learning meditation and just did not know where to start. I also have a case of fidgetiness which makes staying still for a long time a challenge at times.
This DVD was easy to follow all the steps and meditations, some of which were rather fun and I am now hooked, I am able to take the time to practice daily so definitely jump started my practice !

His instruction links spiritual study, yoga practice, and psychological training to real life, and his merciless wit is infectious. I attended Ira's workshop this last summer in Houston, which was first-rate, and was amazed by the effect he had upon those in attendance. His gifts are exceptional, and provide one with tools for bringing about personal transformation; though Ira's aim is to instruct and persuade, it is his sensitivity and compassion that encourages listeners to attempt a new way of being in the world.",1412121600,10,691,5.290909090909091
