8285633,3,B001C18MTM,"Surprisingly I was in Vietnam at the time the movie was made. The only thing I can say about any reality is that I was not in or near any green berated people. I was in armed reconnaissance and as you suspected the environment was totally different. We never went anywhere without an M-60 which was not present in the movie. I was the RTO carried a radio and extra ammunition for the M-60. People that watched out for me at night carried an M-79. For that matter they did not even have a P-38 on their tag chain. The people in the tiger suits were the LRRP's. Once in a while I got to go out with them. I could fill a book with the inconsistencies.

Now putting the differences aside for this movie, it appears consistent with the larger than life John Wayne legend style. This is the style we came to know and love about his movies for over 30 years. And more were to come after this. I find it interesting that he chooses pretty much the same crew of actors to work with whether he is making a cowboy movie, a war movie, or a comedy.

There is a demonstration of Green Beret capabilities. The audience appears to be mostly Susie home-maker and Father Knows Best. A conspicuous heckler George Beckworth (David Janssen of ""The Fugitive"" fame) in the audience is a reporter and a skeptic of the war. He gets hauled around Da Nang and thereabouts until through sharing trials and tribulations with the Green Berets come to realize that they may have not been exaggerating. We are also hauled around with no punches pulled.",1421452800,,1595,4.652482269503546

It begins with a song that was very popular then. This movie is based on the novel by Robin Moore. It begins at the JFK Center for Special Warfare at Fort Bragg. The soldiers are displayed for the press. Next there is a military briefing. The soldiers tell of their expertise. The reporters ask questions. Do the soldiers only do as they are told? [Not unlike workers for a corporation.] Do the newspapers censor reports? Very true. Should we be involved? The Sergeant shows captured weapons (none from US sources). One reporter lights a cigarette. [Is this symbolism?] There is a new volunteer. Then soldiers awake for their next assignment overseas at Da Nang. Sandbags protect buildings. There is a new camp in enemy territory. [Non-professionals always smile when they appear in a movie.] One reporter wants to see things for himself.

The helicopters fly low to their destination, Dodge City. Punji sticks and barbed wire form a defensive wall. What if they are overrun? There is an escape plan. Corrugated tin is acquired. Casualties come in, there is a heavy rain. Can they get reinforcements? At night the enemy attacks with mortars. They know where to aim! The next day choppers take off for hunting the enemy. They find Regulars in the open. [Note the use of modern slang, hairy for not smooth.] The CB troops arrive to clear the perimeter. Sandbags provide shelter. [Note the use of WW II M1 carbines.] One Vietnamese soldier is accused of spying! A Zippo lighter is proof. A medic treats civilians. [Government provided health care?] Can the Colonel visit the Montagnards alone? There are boobytraps along the way. They find some people are silent. Di di Green Beret. Charlie was there. That little girl disappeared. There were other atrocities. Beckworth is impressed. There will be another attack.

The officers visit Da Nang in civilian clothes. A woman sings of Paris. At Dodge City they prepare for an attack, a ruse to distract them from the main attack. I was just talking to him! They attack before dawn, ladders over barbed wire. But a helicopter is shot down! Can they be rescued? Yes. Civilians are moved out. That young boy finds his dog. Reserves fill the breach. The attack begins, the enemy takes casualties. There are explosions and shooting [but little machine gun fire].This takes place at night so you cant see details. Fighter jets will bomb the enemy. Fall back, dammit! The combat goes on. A watchtower falls over. Fall back! Dawn shows the enemy dead bunched up! [No wonder they lost.] Fall back! Helicopters arrive to rescue people. The black-uniformed enemy run up their red and blue flag.

One soldier bought the farm. Puff the Magic Dragon gets orders to attack. High-speed Gatling guns mow down the enemy, like targets in a shooting range. Later the dead are sorted out. What do we do now, sir? They will start over again tomorrow. What happens now? Beckworth will return to write his story. A wounded soldier has a request for his memorial. Thats it. There is a plan to capture an enemy general when he arrives for a rendezvous. Soldiers jump from an airplane. One soldier finds trouble. A large mansion is well guarded. A Citron DS delivers a passenger. Crossbows eliminate guards. Silencers muffle gunshots. The general is attacked and removed. A shot sounds an alarm, but they escape. The prisoner is picked up! Another fiendish trap. Move out! That young boy is disappointed. They walk into the sunset.

There was a controversy over this movie when it was released. There were no other movies about Vietnam until years later. It seems about average. There were better movies made during WW II. Note the labored breathing of John Wayne in a few scenes. The Special Forces were created in 1952 when Truman was President, they were intended for a European war.",1416441600,,3831,4.842748091603053
