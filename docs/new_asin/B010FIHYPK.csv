8722320,5,B010FIHYPK,"Unbelievably brilliant series.... Never expected the French would produce something like this, but they did.
It's a pity it probably will never be released in English (or at least with decent subtitles...) and the dialogues in German are not spoken by real Germans, but this is a very minor issue in what is otherwise an unexpected experience.
