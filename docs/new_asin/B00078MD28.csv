8045827,5,B00078MD28,Two episodes on the DVD crisp clear footage would recommend this to anyone who would like to review this show,1272240000,,109,4.5
8045828,5,B00078MD28,"The other two reviewers are not complaing about the programs themselves but rather the expense of buying one NEW volume containing only two episodes each. The programs are still great to watch and when you can find them used at a better price, how can these complaints still be valid? I have volumes 1-6 and enjoy them over and over. This was the first program in television history that foccused on teenagers.  To go back in time and view these characters and situations that nearly all babay boomers watched, learned and laughed at, is a pure joy! My advice, buy them at the used price when they're available and you won't have a single complaint but only fun in unwrapping these gems of nostalgia!",1178841600,13,700,4.645161290322581
8045829,5,B00078MD28,"This was the first program series about teenagers in the history of television. Almost all of us baby boomers learned and laughed about the trials and tribulations of being a teenager while watching this program. If you want to revisit the fun of seeing Dobie again, check out the VHS tapes available...there are volumes 1-6 currently available. Each tape includes 2-4 episodes depending on which version you buy. For me, it's amazing to go back in time through the wonders of tecnology (VHS) and review these favorite programs from my past. I love Dobie and Maynard and all the characters involved in these stories! It's fun!",1178841600,,626,4.915094339622642
8045830,1,B00078MD28,"Only two episodes for 18.99, what a joke. This show has numerous episodes and you'll go broke trying to add them to your collection at these prices. I don't know whose the greedy one but someone certainly is.",1154563200,43,208,4.5
8045831,1,B00078MD28,"A great 50's show, perhaps the prototye for ""The 70's Show"", a series with the beautiful golddigging goddess Thalia Menninger (Tuesday Weld), Maynard G Krebs (""Work!"" Bob Denver, aka Gilligan), clothes-hound Milton Armitage (Warren Beatty), dwarfish Zelda Gilroy (propinquity) and let's not forget the rich Chatsworth Osborne Jr (Family motto ""Never dip into Capital"").

 However for $18+ you get only 2 twenty-five minute (without commercials) episodes.
Poor value for the money.",1147651200,52,480,5.746478873239437
