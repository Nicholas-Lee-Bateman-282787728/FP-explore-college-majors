Pray for the Wildcats and Food of the Gods but never
saw much else. These were two tv movies one made by
Danny Thomas! Gun and the Cross is a cool movie. A
innocent man escapes the hangman and finds a preacher
murdered and assumes his idenity! The Hanged Man is
also very good. If you like classic westerns and tv
movies you should like these two! the quality isn't
remastered but same as watching a video. not bad!",1334102400,,469,4.222222222222222
