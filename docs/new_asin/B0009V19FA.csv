8471511,4,B0009V19FA,I saw this movie when I was little infact it was a constant rented favorite of mine at the video store until the store closed. I recently remembered the name and tried to find it on youtube but was unsuccscful. I couldn't remember the entire title all I could remember was the name Problemina then while searching google on a whim I came accross the picture of it and I had to have it! It is an entertaining tale from what I remember and well if your kids like the 2D animation of yore then they might like this as well.,1283299200,,520,4.158415841584159
