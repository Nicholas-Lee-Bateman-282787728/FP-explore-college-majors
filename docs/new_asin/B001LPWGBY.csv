3688468,5,B001LPWGBY,"Before a (then) little known Paris wine tasting in 1976, most people had no idea that California was producing world class wines.  That changed when a British ex-pat in Paris organized a wine tasting of the best French versus the best Californians - against all expectations, California won both best red and white and nothing in the wine world has been the same since.

This drama/light comedy follows the true story of the travails of the winning white (Chardonnay) winery leading up to the competition.  There is lots to enjoy here including a struggling small business story, an evolving father-son relationship, the comeuppance of an arrogant industry, and of course, a love triangle.  The movie is well cast (and very well acted) with Bill Pullman as the business owner father and Alan Rickman as the snobby Brit amazed to find that good wines can be found this side of the Atlantic.

In the final analysis, this is a feel good movie, suitable for the whole family with the proviso that kids under 10 might get bored in places.",1229040000,111,1033,4.780898876404494
3688477,3,B001LPWGBY,"I've heard great things, but I don't see the appeal. It looks like a lot of other films about wine that I also don't get. If you love wine, you might enjoy this - but as a coke-n-pepsi guy, i found it uninteresting.",1521936000,,215,4.023255813953488
3688478,5,B001LPWGBY,"A must watch if you love wine! - and Alan Rickman! One of his best, most memorable roles, may he rest in peace. This is not exactly true to the tale, but in general tells the story of how CA won the first international wine competition with France and rocked the wine world and put CA on the map as world leader! Again, they've taken liberties here and there and don't give some of the true heroes justice - you'll have to do your own research online to find out Mike Grgich is the wine maker who made this successful wine and his winery now is justly famous. Still - the film is very entertaining and informative!",1521158400,,614,4.256410256410256

3688581,4,B001LPWGBY,"Good movie, and you can't go wrong with Alan Rickmsn
Bill Pullman's acting was a little over the top and the lead actors 1970's wig was a tad bit distracting but overall not bad",1498608000,,177,4.235294117647059

3688585,1,B001LPWGBY,"Regardless of everything that's been said about this movie's intrinsic cinematographic qualities (or lack thereof), I give one star for the crime of leaving Mike Grgich out of the script. The movie is mostly about the 1973 Chateau Montelena Chardonnay, a wine created by Mike Grgich. Without him as a main character, the movie becomes a pure work of fiction... Robert Mondavi, in his foreword to George Taber's definitive book on the Judgement of Paris, states: ""It was my pleasure to have worked with Mike Grgich and Warren Winiarski, who are the real heroes of this book"" (Winiarsky created the winning 1973 Cabernet-Sauvignon at Stag's Leap Wine Cellars).

3688589,5,B001LPWGBY,"Fun, informative, engaging. No wonder it was required at UCLA Film School to watch. If you've ever been to Temecula Wine Country just outside of Los Angeles or Napa/Sonoma outside of San Francisco, you'll enjoy this film. Get a bottle of your favorite red wine and sip and laugh as you watch. A baquette and cheese makes it just perfect !",1494374400,,338,4.557377049180328

3688592,5,B001LPWGBY,"What can I say about this movie other than that 'I Loved It'? Alan Rickman was, as he has always been, flawless. But the entire cast brought their a-game as well. Dennis Farina plays a small but crucial part, and he really is great to watch. Bill Pullman does what he does- that brooding, self-contained thing- to perfection. I hadn't realized Chris Pine was in the movie, and I completely enjoyed watching his performance, as well as that of his wig, which may have been the only real oddity of the movie. Chris Pine as a hippie isn't an easy get, but Chris pulls it off with his usual charm. Freddie Rodriguez is fantastic and Rachael Taylor is perfect.

One of my favorite things about this movie as that no one tries to be the hero of the story, or more jarring, the main star. It's an ensemble, and everyone shines wonderfully in their own way.

The story, of course, is based on a real event that Americans will love and the French, I'm sure, don't like to be reminded of. There are artistic licenses taken, but they fit in so well and bring so much to the story that otherwise wouldn't be seen that you might not only be forgiving of them, but truly appreciate them and be glad that they are there. The boxing ring is the most prominent one that springs to mind. I LOVED it as an allegory for the relationship of father and son- and even Bo Barret himself (the real man the character was based on) indicates that it is an incredibly appropriate representation of his relationship with his father.

I Loved this- so much that I watched it twice the day that I received it in the mail. I liked it better than that other California wine move that sparked merlot craze, but then, I'm slightly quirky. That being said, I think that you'll love it, too. Very much worth the addition to your video library.",1491955200,3,1806,4.4174174174174174

3688605,3,B001LPWGBY,"This is an interesting movie with lots of little twists and turns (albeit a little predictable). You kind of know where the movie is all headed, however, the actors are all good enough to pull of the story line. The fact that it is based on the true story of the infamous 1976 judgement of Paris is what makes it fascinating. You get a look at how the competition was carried out and who had a stake in the game. The humor is moderate to mild but more on the side of character building. If you want to get a feel for the early years of the Napa wines, then this is great intro. But even better is the inside look at Chateau Montelena which is an iconic winery in Napa.

3688651,4,B001LPWGBY,"As to accuracy, I can't say, having not researched the real truth, but it is true that European wine snobs gave California wines short shrift for a long time before getting their collective noses rubbed in it.
As to enjoyment, it's hard to write off anything with the late Alan Rickman in it, and this was indeed a fun watch. Try it; You'll like it !",1482796800,,350,4.318181818181818

3688654,4,B001LPWGBY,"You really don't have to be a wine enthusiast in order to enjoy this ""based on a true story"" underdog film.  The facts in the 1976 ""Judgement of Paris"" are as incredible as they come with an all French Panel choosing California wines from Chateau Montelana and Stags Leap over French Burgundies and Bordeaux's with top of the line pedigree.  It truly was the beginning of the meteoric rise of American and specifically California wines to a level of respect unheard of before this head to head blind tasting.

The cast here is top notch with Alan Rickman at his snarky, funny best and solid performances by Bill Pullman and a hardly recognizable Chris Pine.  The cinematography and feel of the film captures both the earnestness and Wild West atmosphere of the American Wine scene at the time and pays homage to both the leaders and laborers while also incorporating a sly, self aware sense of humor.  This self awareness may be it's top strength and the laughs are smart, human and always completely in character.

So saying all this why did I give it 4 instead of 5?  Because of a personal gripe about adjusting time frames and leaving out key individuals when basing a movie on real events.  Look, I know moviemaking is a product of a lot of influences, including ensuring flow and story coherence so as not to lose the audience.  But including Gustavo Brambilo instead of the real wine maker, Croatian born Mike Grgich adds a cloudiness  to the real story that I didn't feel was necessary.  Not that Brambilo is not a gifted wine maker in his own right, but it would have been nice to throw some kudos in Grgich's direction, though I'm betting the commercial and critical success of his own ""Grgich Hills"" Winery precluded that.

So, rent this and enjoy it over a good bottle of wine and here is to the hope that it might encourage you to try the wonderful diverse world of wines from California, France and all points in between.",1482710400,,1934,4.606413994169096

3688660,4,B001LPWGBY,I enjoy wine and knew the story. I think the movie did a good job of reflecting the event.

3688661,1,B001LPWGBY,"What a terrible waste of Alan Rickman. I'd give this movie another star just for having him in it, but this project makes every bad-movie mistake in the book, I can't give it another star.

Clichs: get em here, cheaper by the dozen. Illogic. Locations that are lovely, but do not support the story. Overuse of eccentric prop vehicles. Gratuitous father-son boxing, pretty harsh blows for a comedy. (Oh, I guess that's how they work out their conflict!) One cringe-y scene in the script after another.

This is a fascinating, wonderful, true story about the coming of age of California winemaking that would have been great if they actually told it. Instead, the filmmakers were compelled to layer the actual story with ros-colored-glasses b/romance. It's like someone said ""we need more screwing in this wine-movie."" Gratuitous ladies parading around as scenery, and a patently offensive turn in the story when a budding romance between the Blonde Object of Desire (BOD) and a young, talented, Hispanic winemaking dude quickly pivots the BOD toward his friend, for the REAL relationship, with the taller blond white dude who always gets the girls. This character finds true love with BOD just in time for the credits to roll. She couldn't possibly stay with the guy with talent, because he was shorter and browner. So predictable, so casually racist.

Pet peeve: this movie obviously had a budget, it's got lavish locations and good talent, but money ran out before Chris Pine was issued his wig. It's so distractingly bad, it's like another character in the movie. Whereas Dennis Farina's crazy hair and suits were great.

One example of the misdirection in this project: to show a turning point in the plot, Bill Pullman, looking to recover his old job, farcically throws himself around an SF high-rise office, desperate for a corkscrew. Because he just HAS to open this bottle of wine NOW. Because if it's the right color, he won't have to ask for his job back. After a desperate series of histrionic searches, he grabs a sword off the wall and slices the bottle open. It's a lengthy sequence, overwrought and lame.

The source material is good, they just didn't use imagination in making a movie about it. I don't expect a documentary--just not a farce. They injected pandering plot lines, thinking moviegoers need them to sit through a film. They didn't tell the original story well, and then covered that story with dog poop. No poop for you! See something else.",1482451200,,2468,4.894736842105263
3688662,5,B001LPWGBY,"This movie has some pretty cheesy lines and just overall bad acting in some spots, and the sound track is pretty repetitive, but I still love it. Alan Rickman is great and I really enjoy getting wine drunk where I can black out but still feel classy.

I love movies based on facts because they tell stories, stories of normal people, who think that they don't have chances for success in their lives. It is completely opposite, everyone have a chance for success, they just need to try their best. This movie is about life, life that can be improved if you try.

It's a good book and a good story - but a bad movie.  Alan Rickman plays Steven Spurier, who in real life ran a successful wine academy in Paris and is a genuinely nice person.  In the movie Rickman plays him as a failure and effete snob.  The portrayal of California winemaking is packed with just about every stereotype character ever associated with California - boring and entirely predictable.  The story itself is actually quit interesting - apparently a new movie that more accurately follows the book is in the works.

3688823,4,B001LPWGBY,"Bottle Shock is a fine movie on the rise in international prominence of the California wine industry in 1976.  It focuses on Chateau Montelena and its fledgling operation that was transformed into a sought after wine by its victory in the Paris wine tasting.  The story shows the ingenuity in getting the wine tasting to happen and the difficulties that the Californians faced in getting their product to the competition.  As a wine lover, it was interesting to see that these great California wineries were struggling business in 1976 and were able to succeed financially perhaps only because of their success in the Paris wine tasting.  The cast is excellent led by Alan Rickman who portrays the snobby British owner of the Parisian wine store who organizes the wine tasting.",1476748800,,777,4.953846153846154

If you like movies with action, suspense, comedy, mystery, awesome special effects, thought-provoking plot twists, or generally anything other than dramatic wine making/tasting, you will probably lean towards 1-star as well (and probably will never get as far as reading this review).",1476230400,,442,5.125

This movie does not have made it the box office with the likes of  Sideways but surely stands on its own.  Bottle Shock tells the story of Chateau Montelena winning the best white wine in the 1976 Judgement of Paris. If you wait until the end there is a small recognition of Stags Leap Cast 23 winning the top red wine at the Judgement. For someone like myself, who was just developing a passion for good wine in 1976, all I remember  was Stags Leap Cask 23 getting the press and notoriety.

Then, when the dad and son have a conflict  the dad asks son if he wants to fight.  Then they step into a ring and beat the crap out of each other.  I guess that was considered conflict resolution.  I wish they would stop with the ""based on a true story"" line because they butchered the true story and I don't know, because the story of the film was boring and contrived. Oh, and yeah right, the kid can do a blind taste and give the brand and year of wine.  The bar is astonished.  All I saw is a bunch actors acting astonished.",1474675200,,686,4.097744360902255

3688915,5,B001LPWGBY,"A lovely Hollywood movie that tells the story of how California wines came to be prized as much or more than French wines.
The mechanism for this accomplishment was a ""blind test"" of various reds and whites in 1976. The contest was held in France.

Portrayals of the vineyards and their owners show Napa Valley in all its beauty--light, fresh air, good soil and careful growers. You don't need to be a wine expert to appreciate the care with which the grapes are grown grown and the care with which they are barreled. Producing great nectar is in the hopes, dreams and daily life of the growers. It's an obsession!

The cast is enjoyable to watch with good performances by veteran actors Bill Pullman  Alan Rickman and Dennis Farina (cameo by Miguel Sandoval and Bradley Whitfield); young newcomers (at the time) include fun performances by Chris Pine, Freddy Rodrigez and the beautiful Rachel Taylor. Combined, they are constantly, a feast for the eyes.

Overall, this is fun movie that is about something meaningful and it is visually beautiful to watch. Sorry, no explosions, murders, sociopathic betrayals or deep gratuitous sex.

3688937,2,B001LPWGBY,About as sappy a movie as I've watched in a long time. Just about every clich in the book was trotted out for this one. Don't waste your time.,1474243200,,142,3.9310344827586206

3688945,4,B001LPWGBY,"Lots of great actors in this one, and an entertaining history lesson (how often do you see those last three words in order?) of the year California wine came of age.  Rickman is wonderful as the snobbish Brit who learns to embrace not only American vineyards but the food as well (the scenes of him trying guacamole and KFC for the first time are priceless), and fans of the Captain Kirk Chris Pine will be in for a nice surprise with his role here.  There are so many good performances that the wonderful Bradley Whitford is only given a blink or you'll miss it moment.  Don't blink.",1474156800,,584,4.4392523364485985

3688964,2,B001LPWGBY,"An interesting subject - the ascension of California wines against the French establishment -- has terrific actors, such as Alan Rickman and Bill Pullman.  Unfortunately,  any ""drama"" to be found tends to be artificial ""juiced"".  The director never gets a feel for the tone of the film. And it flounders around in tedious mediocrity trying to be alternately whimsical, farcical, and dramatic.  It's mostly just a snooze that can't be saved even by decent performances of the older folks.  The younger ones, such as Chris Pine, aren't experienced enough to figure out how to work their way through a boring, mundane and occasionally ridiculous script.  Feel free to miss it.",1473984000,,673,5.072727272727272

3688967,4,B001LPWGBY,"Light hearted and enjoyable to watch. Clearly, as previous reviews indicate, there is a lot of 'Hollywood' and the viewer will probably very quickly discern that this is not a factual account.

3688968,5,B001LPWGBY,Great depiction of how the 1976 Paris wine tasting happened.,1473984000,,60,5.1
3688969,1,B001LPWGBY,"Great subject, great story, horrible script and direction. The director and writer team didn't understand the dramatic thread at the core of the story, so they kept losing focus and wandering afield. This is about the 70's and it watches like a bad '70's hippy drama about coming of age and fighting the establishment, with a soupcon of free love thrown in, but just the amount that would be okay on broadcast tv at the time.

I think this movie could be used in film school courses as a prime example of how to make a bad film. The cast was very strong, the cinematography and music were likewise very good. The only problem, really, was the script didn't focus on the narrative arc, and the director did not fix that lack of focus in the filming. This was part historical drama, part David vs Goliath, part follow your dream into a wall, and part post-Woodstock stoner film, and all mess. It should have been tightly focused on the collective experience of a bunch of outsiders, peasants (culturally, if not entirely in fact), being accidentally invited to storm the Bastille, only to find, to everyone's surprise, a victory awaiting them instead of a rout .",1473984000,2,1160,4.658536585365853

3688973,5,B001LPWGBY,low key comedy of sorts - who knew you could make a wine too perfectly? also gives you a little history lesson in the breakthrough of USA wines into wine mainstream,1473811200,,164,4.32258064516129

Beautifully photographed with the best of Napa Valley, great script, and great story. Anyone would love this film. Saw this just after Rickman died. What a tribute to him.

3689052,3,B001LPWGBY,"I never heard of this movie, but gave it a try because Alan Rickman and wine seemed like a good combo.  Halfway through, I was wishing it would end. The pacing is excruciating,  and the only character relationship that makes sense is between hippie Chris Pine and his character's father (they box each other to work things out). None of the other pairings make sense,  so the movie's entire middle could be left out and you wouldn't miss anything.  The last 20 minutes redeem it somewhat, but overall,  it was ""meh"".",1472774400,,516,4.626373626373627

3689055,5,B001LPWGBY,"So the movie takes some liberties with the truth. OK-- A LOT of liberties. Big deal. It's a warm, funny retelling of the 1976 ""Judgment of Paris"" wine tasting that put California wine on the global map. Superb, funny performances by Alan Rickman and Dennis Farina. A great against-type performance by Bill Pullman adds to the enjoyment of this film. I've never watched an entire Star Trek movie with Chris Pine but he does a fine job here, as do the rest of the cast.

Just watch this fun movie and enjoy the Napa and Sonoma counties wine country tour. And enjoy all the vintage Doobie Brothers music.",1472688000,,601,4.564814814814815

3689091,5,B001LPWGBY,It's a fun movie. It's light hearted and makes you feel warm and fuzzy. The only downside is the terrible wig that they put on Chris Pine.

BTW - the Napa Valley didn't look that way in the 1960s and 70s. It was a lot of dry fields and hillsides, with a few large  vineyards here and there. I grew up nearby and remember well.

3689162,5,B001LPWGBY,This was a great movie.  Really resonated with me as I am a fan of Chateau Montelena wines and even had the chance to meet Bo Barrett at the winery when I toured it 10 years ago.  I loved the way the movie showed how hard wine makers and growers work to perfect their wines and showing that time period before California wines exploded onto the world stage was fascinating to me.  I first toured Napa in 1979 and fell in love with it.  I am only sorry it took me so long to see this movie.,1471219200,,489,4.010309278350515

3689173,4,B001LPWGBY,"I don't drink wine & have very little knowledge of it, but found this movie entertaining. It moves at what I would call a 'power-walk' pace after the opening scenario, & that kept my attention right up through the end.
The girl's character was weak, pathetic & stupid, however (""3 wheels are as good as 4""). Supposedly there as an intern, it's completely obvious the character was put in for the sexual attraction only, since she never uttered one word of knowledge about wine--or anything, really.
That's just my opinion from someone who was not aware of the story beforehand.
I will admit whenever I thought of it as being a true story while watching, I knew I'd be searching for the truth in it all, as it does have 'Hollywood'
written all over it.

Great cast and fun flick about the US wine industry, particularly CA, making history in what was then a French dominated wine world.

But, as I said, I'd known about and heard about the ""Judgment of Paris"", both the first one in 1976, and the follow-up in 2006, for a while.

This is a light-weight film about a subject near and dear to my heart with some terrific performances. It's not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it scratched an itch for me.

Since I know several of the real life characters it portrays it's even more enjoyable. Did you see the real Jim Barrett doing a cameo? Gotta be quick to catch it.

3689688,5,B001LPWGBY,"This is a finely crafted film-- smart, literate, funny, witty, tight as a drum. It is based in true events. The scenery and cinematography are awesome, capturing the beautiful sunlit vineyards and rolling hills of Napa. The musical score is a spot on fit.  A very bitter, mean-spirited, beleaguered Napa vintner, as the story goes, is giving his last shot at producing a worthy wine. His behavior towards his hasn't-outgrown-it hippie son is pretty abusive and his approach to conflict is to box it out with him. The standout performances are those of Chris Pine ( the son, Bo Barrett) and Alan Rickman (Steven Spurrier), the pretentious Brit, expert in French wines, who stages the ultimate contest between the wines of France and those of California. He tastes himself silly and comically, sampling all the Napa wines for the event. This historical competition in 1976 actually put California wine growers on the global map. While this may seem a rather easy and effortless film, it took some brainy, talented folks to create that feel; among them, Jody Savin, who wrote the screenplay, and Randall Miller, who co-wrote and directed.",1468022400,6,1135,5.005291005291006

3689752,5,B001LPWGBY,"I enjoyed Bottle Shock. It is loosely based on a 1976 wine competition called the ""Judgment of Paris."" Californian wine defeated French wine in a blind taste test and created a stir. The film is a gentle, witty, feel good movie. Alan Rickman plays a wine snob who owns a struggling wine shop in Paris. He travels to Napa Valley in search of wine for a competition and hopes the publicity will help his business. He expects the Americans to lose. In Napa he meets Bill Pullman and Chris Pine, a father, and son duo, who run their own vineyard. The Californian winemakers are likable rogues who also make great wine. There are some ups and downs along the way but it all ends happily.

I was at college in 1976 and I fondly remember the clothes, the music, and the hair. Nostalgia may be why I like this film. Bottle Shock also has a terrific ensemble cast. Alan Rickman is superb. Denis Farina is also excellent as his only customer. Bottle Shock is a small indie movie that was shown at Sundance. It kept me entertained.",1467763200,,1020,4.454545454545454

For the parents out there who care what their children watch, there are a few scenes that might be a problem for impressionable minds: bong, smoking pot at a party in the beginning, a sex scene (no nudity but it's still sex), and a flash your boobies to get a hitchhike ride when the car breaks down, but we don't see any nudity.

One of Alan Rickman's last performances before he died. Wonderful casting. Great family film for teens and adults. A very hard headed difficult father and a young late bloomer son who saves the family vineyard, gets the girl and still keeps his buddy. Supposedly based on a true story which makes it all the better. I can't believe that the french would even agree to a blind taste test with california wines but I love that they did. Anytime I can see France and California in one film, its a winner. I'm not sure what Rickman's character ever got out of it but he makes the picture what it is. Great film to rent or buy. Upbeat and heartwarming. Enjoy.",1467590400,,792,4.344594594594595

The music is very loud, the dialog variable, from so quiet the words cannot be heard or discerned right through normal volume. Given the loud music and the variable dialog, I spent the entire time with my thumb on the volume button of the remote. The characters are not well developed. I never figured out why father and son fought in the ring every so often. I also never understood why the Brit, living in France, wanted a wine competition to begin with. Also, Chris Pine wears, throughout, the world's worst wig. In addition, his portrayal of a young person in the 1970's is so contrived it would qualify as farce.

3689900,5,B001LPWGBY,"This story of a little California winery in the 1970s that competed with the French wineries in a contest is enjoyable to watch and especially elevated by the performance of the late Alan Rickman.  As a little wine shop owner, Rickman had impeccable comedic timing and a droll way of portraying British snobbery.  His character's friendship with Dennis Farina's character was engaging and led to a turning point in the plot.  Rickman was a joy to watch all the way through the film.  The father-son conflict between Bill Pullman's and Chris Pine's characters typified the conflict of hippie sons and daughters in the 1970s with their establishment parents, and the struggles of the little winery to compete with the French wineries in an era before California wine was recognized as fine wine introduced the problems the story needed to be meaningful.

I didn't know anything about the history behind that first blind tasting in 1976, so I found this interesting in that regard.  Fascinating to see the birth and development of some of Napa's great wineries back in the day when almost no one had heard of them.

3690044,3,B001LPWGBY,"The film starts very slow and uninteresting, almost to the point of wanting to turn it off.  The actors are not the types one would associate as ""wine connoisseurs,"" much less as capable of thinking about such a sophisticated test.  Then it gets worse; it tells us that the father and son winemakers use boxing as a way to settle differences of opinion about wine growing and life in particular.

The ""British"" wine snob comes to find out if what the colony neophytes are growing is wine worthy of drinking. He is surprised and decides to do the test in France---this is the part where the film rushed the end as if it ran out of money. The California wines won, and the rest is history. Well, not exactly, based on a true story the film took a lot of poetic license with the facts to make it ""interesting.""  I suggest just reading the book to learn what happened.",1461024000,,864,4.415094339622642

3690062,1,B001LPWGBY,"On the occasion of the anniversary of the Paris tasting, which this awful film purports to recount, time to set the record straight.  The movie says ""Based on a true story"".  Hardly.  It takes the wonderful true story of a poor Yugoslav immigrant, Mike Grgich, who arrives in CA without a penny to his name and works alongside several famous wine makers to learn the ropes and who ultimately lands a job at Chateau Montelena and changes it.  Instead the movie posits a worthless no account son, warring with his father, joined by a hippie woman intern and a chip on his shoulder Mexican and places them at Chateau Montelena next to the going broke father.  The Mexican makes the wine, because Mexicans know the land.  In reality the broke father, Jim Barret, in fact was a wealthy Southern Cal lawyer backed by mega rich shopping center developer Ernie Hahn.  The distortions in the movie are too much for words.  Instead of the compelling true story we get Hollywood stereotypical narratives:  father son conflict, discrimination against worthy Hispanics, a 2010 bar scene transported back to 1976.  In short the film is a butchery of reality.",1457654400,18,1144,4.82051282051282

3690145,3,B001LPWGBY,"It's a fun movie, but it has a lot of pretty basic moviemaking flaws.

First of all, Alan Rickman is excellent (as always); Bill Pullman is great; Miguel Sandoval, Freddy Rodriguez, and Dennis Farina are all terrific if underused.  There are some great and funny scenes - Rickman in the Customs line, Pullman opening the wine at the law office, Rodriguez visiting his father - that move the story along and tell us something about the characters.  Not to mention the aerial wine-porn shots of the Napa vineyards.  Unfortunately, these aren't held together in a coherent way.

So, what's wrong with the movie?  Three things stand out...first, the script seems to have needed a few more trips past an editor.  It often goes down a promising plotline (such as Gustavo's secret winemaking) that just fades into the background, or contains trite elements that don't do anything to support the story (such as the love triangle that's just shoehorned in).

Second, if Bo Barrett is supposed to be a major character, he should be A) marginally sympathetic and B) played by an actor with some skill.  As portrayed by Chris Pine, he seems to be a spoiled, lazy jerk in a cheap hippie wig.  It's never really believable that he would become someone who could be trusted to run a QuikTrip, let along a venerable winery.

And, finally, the Bechdel test.  Not to get too PC, but it's really lazy screenwriting when you introduce a female character whose purpose is to 1) look good in tight denim shorts and 2) to have sex with the male leads.  That's all she does in the entire movie.  (Oh, and to be named 'Sam', so the characters can have a brief, trite moment of confusion at a woman with a man's name.)",1439856000,,1692,4.634228187919463

However, not the True Story the movie claims.  Chateau Montelena actually got the wine from Alexander Valley (north Sonoma County around Geyserville).  I you want to great wines and not empty your wallet, forget Napa and go to the Dry Creek, Russian River, Sonoma Coast, Rockpile and Alexander Valley appellations.

The problem is that they COMPLETELY OMIT the Paris tasting winemakers Mike Grgich (CM Montelena) and Warren Winniarski (Stags Leap Wine Cellars Cab Sauvignon). I can only imagine that Barrett wanted to write revisionist history. The truth is Barrett knew nothing about winemaking, much less making a wine that would beat out the best of the french Burgundies. What occurred in Paris in 1976 was an enormously huge deal, the story (the real one, that is) is fascinating, and the reason I even bother to mention this / write a review is that this act put California on the map. It changed the global wine industry dynamics. That said, the movie is lighthearted / lightweight and Alan Rickman does a superb job as an obnoxious and insufferable Brit, perhaps a part that required no acting ;) . Pure fun escapism. The real story can be found in George Taber's excellent, well researched (and probably more detail than most want to know) book ""The Judgment of Paris: California v France 1976.""",1431129600,2,1164,4.767326732673268

I was never sure if the movie was about a man struggling greatly and succeeding against great odds, a father and son coming to terms with each other, native peoples claiming their rights and emerging triumphant, or David defeating Goliath. The movie needed to focus on one of these plots and full develop it!

Overall, though, it is a fun movie if you don't think about it too much. I was enjoyable to see the actors like Chris Pine, Alan Rickman, and James Farina do a great job with a so so production and script.

3690207,5,B001LPWGBY,"This film is a slightly comic account of the wine judging event held in Paris in 1976, known since then as ""The Judgement of Paris.""  A blind wine tasting was conducted comparing a group of California wines with their French counterparts and, to the very great surprise of the wine world, two California wines took top place,  Stag's Leap S.L.V. Estate Cabernet Sauvignon for the red competition, and Chateau Montelena's 1973 Chardonnay for the white.  The event is regarded as almost revolutionary insofar as it proved to the world that France was not the only place on the planet that fine wines could be produced.  The principle characters in the film account are associated with the Chateau Montelena production of its Chardonnay wine and its entry in the competition.

3690218,1,B001LPWGBY,"It is rare that I write reviews on movies.  The movie either has to be unexpectedly great or unexpectedly bad for me to feel compelled to review it.  In this case the bad has won out. What I expected was an intelligent coherent, congruent movie about one of the most important moments in the history of wine in the United States.  What I experienced was a dithering, contrived, semi-comedy farce about characters that were not likable, but were also not even respectable in most cases.  The way the storyline was presented was not believable or logical and highlighted the emotionally immature aspects of the characters, showing lots of unresolved anger, sexism, and racism.  It has been said that when something is not logical, it isn't true.  Although the basic premise of the movie may be true, the way it was presented, to me, was false, and like a good bottle of wine that has gone bad, you can imagine the disappointment I felt in attempting to enjoy this film.  All I got was vinegar.

One last note:  Some compare this movie to Sideways.  I saw Sideways, thought it was a good movie, very well acted, interesting writing.....had some heart. A good movie for adults who are into wine.  Maybe i would have enjoyed Bottleshock if I was 16 years old............or high on grass..........2 things I was not.",1423440000,5,1310,4.726872246696035

We watched 1/2 of it waiting for it to pick up. The plot was very slow and dull, the dialogue was poor, and the acting overall was not good.

I kept us watching by saying this next scene is the pivotal scene... well it didn't come... maybe it was in the last 30 minutes...  I checked reviews on Flickster and it was rated very poorly which is consistent with my impressions.

Rickman carries off the wine connaisseur beautifully while driving a Gremlin as his rented car in this country.

3690274,5,B001LPWGBY,"If you have any interest in wine - particularly, American wines - you absolutely must pick up and read George M. Taber's ""Judgment of Paris: California vs. France and the Historic 1976 Paris Tasting That Revolutionized Wine"". The title is lengthy, but the book tells the true story of California's emergence onto the world stage as a preeminent wine region.

""Bottle Shock"" is the Hollywood adaption of ""Judgement of Paris""; as a result, it takes a great liberties with various elements of the story for the sake of colorful storytelling. Therefore, don't expect it to be 100% true to Taber's excellent book -- it's ""inspired by"" a true story, not THE true story -- in fact, you can currently take a tour at Chateau Montelena that helps ""separate fact from fiction"" in regards to the film vs. history.

Alan Rickman is at his grumpy best as Steven Spurrier, a Brit living in Paris who runs a wine store. Spurrier's primary customer is an American, Maurice (Dennis Farina, who absolutely steals every scene he's in, as usual), who bluntly tells his friend that despite the grand name on his store (The Wine Academy), which might lead his customers to believe they could receive a wide education of wine, his store has a very limited selection beyond copious French selections. New American wines, he tells Spurrier, are not only excellent, but he would put them side by side with the top European wines. Spurrier is highly dubious, but he has nothing to lose at this point, so he books himself a trip to California with the idea of staging a California vs. French blind wine tasting. He is still skeptical that the Californians may be producing anything vaguely drinkable.

I would call this film a romantic valentine to charming, laid-back, mid-1970s Napa Valley - the land of the farmers and dreamers - before it was discovered as great American terroir, before they charged for wine tastings, before the crowds and the high-end hotels and pricey restaurants cluttered the valley floor. The photography is lush, and you can practically feel the heat rising out of the vineyards and smell the dirt as seen on a warm summer's day.

As stated, there's various liberties taken by the filmmakers - such as adding the female character Sam as a love interest; the film could have been told just as well without her, and eliminating one of the most important characters in the true story (winemaker Mike Grgich). But if you've never read the book - watch the film, then read the book, so you don't mistake the two. The film is well-cast, and the editing and music choices set the stage well while keeping the pace briskly moving along.

And while it romanticizes reality, it makes for a delightfully charming film for wine enthusiasts. Pair it with ""Sideways"" for the two ends of California wine tasting: ""Bottle Shock"" tells the story of California's emergence onto the world wine stage, and ""Sideways"" shows modern California wine culture (albeit in Santa Barbara wine country vs Napa).",1411689600,,2981,4.8487229862475445

He becomes anxious to introduce them their wines to the world &, endearingly, almost possessive in his hope for their success.

Bottle Shock tells the story of the historic 1976 wine tasting known as the ""Judgment of Paris,"" where, for the first time, American vintners managed to defeat the French in a blind tasting to crown the ultimate Cabernet and Chardonnay. Director Randall Miller offers up a serio-comic take on the event starring Bill Pullman and Alan Rickman.

I asked my new friends on Facebook (FB) for their thoughts:

I thought the story was great because I love love love CA wines. In fact I enjoyed a Brian Benson Syrah while I was watching it. Nicolette H.

I saw Bottle Shock a couple days ago with my husband via Netflix. We really enjoyed it. Patty P.

I worked the premiere with Ian Blackburn (Learn About Wine educator). A fun little movie. Alan Rickman rocks, as always. Denise L.

I thought that even though the love story was bogus, the (female) love interest was SMOKIN' H-O-T! (sorry, just bein' a guy!) Chad L.

I saw the movie last night and really liked it. The broad story of the underdog going against the pro's and the trials and tribulations could be plugged into any industry or venture. However, if you're just getting into wine there is a lot to learn from the film. Katheen C.",1402617600,,1454,4.561538461538461

The entire production is, in my opinion, without flaw.  The location is inviting, the actors, perfectly cast, turned in some of their best performances. I have been a fan of Alan Rickman since Robin Hood Prince of Thieves and Chris Pine is proving to be an actor that I look forward to watching for many years.  It is a comedy but don't think you're going to pee your pants laughing, the laughs are woven into the story in such a manner as to not detract from the story line but to keep the movie moving and entertaining.  A Brit wanna-be French wine snob coming to Napa Valley thinking he is going to find some Yankee hicks from the sticks making red vinegar and calling it wine is the basic premise of the movie and to tell you more would be unfair. Just know that the plot is captivating, taking you on a soaring ride from being on a peaceful, laid-back stroll through Napa valley to the OMG punch toward the end of the movie.  Add to that the fact that it's based on true events and living, breathing characters and you have a winner.

Based on a true story that changed Napa Valley and international wine sensibilities forever, the script is good and the cast does well with it. The direction and cinematography are gorgeous. It does drag a bit in the beginning, but the rest is a romp with occasional juvenile moments, possibly to appease the younger crowd. Not a fan of Chris Pine or Eliza Dushku, and they don't distinguish themselves here either. But an especially lovely performance from Freddy Rodriguez as a soulful native son of the vinyards rocked my world. And it was great fun to see Alan Rickman play the insecure but determined Englishman abroad, Bill Pullman go against type as the irascible but loveable master winemaker and Danny Devito ham it up as a snobby French wine expert who takes his comeuppance with equanimity.

I would strongly suggest that all who watch this, also watch the special features at the end of the move for a deeper glimpse into the wine and the family.  For anyone who enjoys wine at any level, this is a fun watch.  The only sad thing is that their wine is sold at only select stores across the country AND it runs around $30 a bottle or more.

The acting is well done with a few familiar faces throughout. What got me to knock one star off was the editing in places is rough...to the point you have to ask, 'how did we get here from there?', and maybe the obligatory romantic love story is a bit weak.

Chris Pine plays his part as the long haired son of a controlling father, Bill Pullman, who quit his money making job as a lawyer to start his own wine making business. The time is around the 1970s and is brilliantly captured with the soundtrack and the atmosphere of Napa during that time. A French wine seller, Alan Rickman, is the wine snob that travels from France to Napa to check out the local winemakers of Napa before he approaches the community with the challenge.  Until 1970, France had been the only leader in making great wines - until the upstarts from California USA came along.

3690378,5,B001LPWGBY,"Every time we go wine tasting in Napa, someone tells us about the real events that led to the story of ""Bottle Shock"". The movie is effective in telling the story of how Napa wines were finally ""put on the map"" and lets us into the world of the people behind some of the wineries involved. The acting is superb and the story is engrossing - this isn't a boring history lesson. There are subplots and the character development is terrific - but you also learn about the evolution of the Napa wine world, which has actually been around since the l800's.

For fun, watch the movie then visit Chateau Montelena and Stags' Leap Wineries (be prepared to pay a premium for tastings or just visit the grounds - they're amazing), and then travel to Kunde Estate in Sonoma (less pricey tasting and a free cave tour). That is the the site where most of the film was actually shot, as it appears more like Napa in the 1970's than Napa does now. They'll even tell you where to find the farmhouse ruins used for the competition in ""France""....",1389830400,,1029,4.444444444444445

The movie does exactly what it is supposed to do which is bring us back to the mid- 70s in Napa, CA and the historical events that happened in the world of wine in 1976.  It is entertaining and enjoyable, and it makes you proud to be an American for a couple hours.  It seems to me that feeling is hard to come by today, so it is absolutely worth watching.  It's not cerebral or Oscar caliber, but so what, it's a perfectly enjoyable little movie about overcoming hardship to reach ultimate success!  As far as I am concerned it is right up there as a collector's item just as a '73 bottle of Chateau Montelena Chardonnay is!",1381968000,3,778,4.4125874125874125

The story line departs so far from reality that it becomes boring just minutes into the film. The folks who put this project together must have had some good intentions at some point, but they abandoned them in short order, as the liberties that they take with what actually happened back in 1976 are simply high school grade trash. The writing and plot line are sophomoric, the staging and set/shot selection is trite and formulaic.

3690442,4,B001LPWGBY,"""Based on a true story."" I always like to see that when a movie begins, don't you?

Seattle International Film Festival attendees awarded star Alan Rickman (""Something the Lord Made,"" ""Snow Cake,"" ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"" and ""Sense & Sensibility"") the ""Golden Needle Award"" for his performance as the stuffy British wine expert who is talked into visiting the California Wine Country by his feisty Parisian friend, played by Dennis Farina (""What Happens in Vegas,"" ""Paparazzi"" and ""You Kill Me""). His mission is to see if California wineries in 1979 can produce wine worthy of a taste test in France. California wines have been sneered at, ridiculed and rejected by the French from the very beginning, so the vintners in Napa Valley are NOT welcoming, as they assume it will be another rigged excuse to jeer at them.

Rickman's culture shock is delicious. No one can look disgusted, snooty and curious, all the while trying to maintain some modicum of good manners better than Rickman! His hesitant first encounters with Kentucky Fried Chicken and corn chips with guacamole dip are two of his more memorable scenes.

Bill Pullman (""Independence Day,"" ""While You Were Sleeping"" and ""Ruthless People"") is a dedicated perfectionist who is down to his last loan. His vineyard is carefully maintained and his bottling techniques are meticulous...almost to a fault! He is frustrated and broke. His son, played by Chris Pine (""Star Trek,"" ""Smokin' Aces"" and ""Just My Luck""), is a major disappointment, unmotivated and going nowhere...fast!

Of course there is the inevitable romantic triangle which lacks any spark whatsoever, so there is very little point in discussing it. Suffice it to say, it isn't important to the story. They are able to use ""real"" newspapers and magazines when Rickman is successful in arranging a blind taste test conducted by France's acknowledged top wine experts.

We all love it when the little guy comes from behind, don't we! Watching how it all came about is the joy of this heartwarming little film. My DVD from Amazon is watched regularly.",1377734400,,2065,5.061764705882353
3690443,5,B001LPWGBY,"What a delight!  This was an interesting story about the events that lead up to one of the game changers for Napa Valley and its wine industry.  I am not sure how much of this story is fact and how much was literary license by the writer and director (especially when it comes to the characters), but it certainly gave a good idea of the shockwave that it created in the world wine industry from a group of ""hicks from sticks"" in Napa Valley in the early 1970's.  The acting was great - anchored by Alan Rickman and Chris Pine (pre-Star Trek).  As a Californian who loves Napa Valley, this was great movie that I can watch over and over.  For anyone who likes wine and wants to watch an entertaining movie about a historic event that put Napa on the map - this is it.",1377734400,,767,4.226027397260274

Alan Rickman again plays someone that is not always very appealing, but you find a delightful charm to it, that makes you watch.  Chris Pine is always good, and nice to see the younger version of him.",1377734400,,354,4.115942028985507
3690445,5,B001LPWGBY,I searched high and low for this movie in the state of Montana and it did not exist. Being from California this movie is a little piece of our history.

It makes you want to go to the vineyard and stomp your own grapes just to be a part of wine country. Amazon did not disappoint and of course they had the movie for a great price. The seller got it to me super fast and in great condition.,1377475200,,518,3.9903846153846154

I'm a woman, but even I appreciated them - especially since the lead male is so repulsive (in the movie - I'm sure he cleans up well).  However, despite the shortcomings, we love the movie!  I think it is partially the way the actors are able to convey that the wine is fantastic - we soooo know that feeling!

You can read a summary of the story in other reviews, but I will tell you how these actors bring the joy of making wine to the screen without a flaw!  Alan Rickman is WONDERFUL as a cantankerous representative of the wine-tasters in France who want to have the first blind taste-test including wines from the United States!  He doesn't want to like our wines, but he just can't help himself.  Chris Pine is perfect as the ""black sheep"" son of a winery owner who makes some of the best wines......ever.  This movie has perfect acting, a perfect pace with the action, great soundtrack, and a great story.  I highly recommend ""Bottle Shock"".

3690481,4,B001LPWGBY,"Got the movie after the Wall St. Journal and LA Times published  articles about  Jim Barrett following his death a few weeks ago. The articles contained  background on Jim's life prior to Jim and a group of investors buying the defunct Chateau Montelena winery. It would have been interesting to see, to the extent they were involved in acquiring and starting up the winery, more about Jim's wife and several kids.  It's hard to know how much Hollywood added to (or subtracted from) the story, especially after having attended a talk given by Frank Abagnale (Catch Me If You Can was based on his life). An audience member asked how much of the movie was true. Abagnale answered that he recognized parts of it. The performances by Alan Rickman, Dennis Farina and Bill Pullman were, as usual, excellent. Freddy Rodriguez, Chris Pine and Rachel Taylor were also good. The photography was beautiful. Mike Grgich, also a well known wine maker, stated that his time working at Chateau Montelena was the best 5 years of his life. Would have enjoyed seeing the extent of his involvement, too.  Nevertheless, a delightful movie if you have any interest in Cal wine making history. Highly recommended.",1364688000,2,1191,4.876237623762377

3690485,5,B001LPWGBY,"This movie captures the spirit of winemaking.  Not in a technical sense, and not completely historically accurately either, but as far as capturing the personalities it takes to just jump into that boxing ring and start growing grapes and making wine - they nailed it.

Also, the quality was far less than 480p (DVD), very compressed, almost blurry at parts.

3690509,3,B001LPWGBY,"I just watched through a second, and likely final time.

The acting is mixed.  Dennis Farina and Alan Rickman are good, but the rest of the cast, the Americans that is, other than Freddy Rodriguez (who is very good) are pretty bland to just plain bad.

The story is loosely based on the Judgement of Paris tasting, and I say LOOSELY.  There is much that was added to make this film more interesting (such as the airport scene with the bottles, the wine turning brown, etc...), but the fact is that George Taber, a lesser known journalist for Vogue I believe, was in attendance and sold the story to Time magazine.  The rest is history.  It really just established what most California vintners at the time already knew: that their wines were good enough to compete on a global scale.

The back story is interesting, though it does stray from actual history a bit.  The saving grace of the film is that it is quite fun.  There are some great moments, both interesting and hilarious.  Another great little plus is that the film really does take the viewer back to the 70s.  They did a great job.  Granted, many parts are completely out of place, such as the entrance road to Chateau Montelena looking like it is in Carneros and not in Calistoga.  (It's heavily wooded at the entrance road).  But perhaps this and other settings were artistic choices.

I highly recommend reading the book either before or after this film:

3690521,3,B001LPWGBY,"Overall it's a bit mired in a bit 'over the top' characterizations of some of the principles and vast divergence from actual events (based on the book).  In the effort to make this an 'interesting' tale I think the writers actually did damage to the film.  Still it's interesting enough to recommend, but only to those either hugely interested in wine culture or some lovely character work by Rickman & Pullman.  Beyond the clear inventions (Barret's son Bo being at the tasting, Gustavo even actually working at Chateau Montelena prior to the tasting, and the way the wine was selected and acquired by Spurrier) the actual facts as related by Taber, supported by Spurrier, suggest this depiction is far more fanciful than factual.  Which is a shame to my mind since the real facts, as related by Taber in ""The Judgement of Paris"" (2005).  I think Rotten Tomatoes gets it about right with the comment that the film fails to take advantage of the inspiring actual story!

It is a cute film. Its setting is the 1970s in the California Napa Valley before it became the wine capital of the U.S.A. It explores this beginning. Up until this period in time, the French were at the top of the world for being the best wine makers. Not anymore. This is a cute, comic film, though it is more of a docudrama, there are times when you can have a good laugh. Alan Rickman, as always  gives a worthwhile performance.

The film has a great cast to help tell the story.  Alan Rickman plays the snooty British wine snob, Bill Pullman the feisty California vintner putting everything he has and more into making a great wine, Freddy Rodriguez the second generation vineyard worker developing his own wine, and Chris Pine the ne'er-do-well hippie son.  Filmed in Napa Valley and in France, the movie has a satisfying, complex, full-bodied taste.

I'm the biggest Alan Rickman fan, and I was not disappointed in his performance.  He definitely shows his comedic chops here, he's an all around consumate actor and I love all his work.

Bill Pullman was great too.  I've enjoyed him ever since ""Spaceballs"" and ""While You Were Sleeping"".  His performance is spot on.

I am blanking on the others actors names at the moment, but their portrayals were wonderful too.  The guy from Star Trek, who plays Bill Pullman's son, was suprisinly better than I thought he'd be.  The other guy, the one that used to be in ""Six Feet Under"", was very believable too.

I would definitely recommend this film to any Alan Rickman or Bill Pullman fans.

3690566,5,B001LPWGBY,"I really enjoyed Bottle Shock, but that could be the Pinot Grigio talking. Bottle Shock was brash, but not impertinent. I watched it with my sister, who is my vino compaera, though you could hardly consider her palate discerning... Hey, that's a joke. She usually even eschews wine that is dispensed from a box.

Maurice: It's oaky... Oh, yeah, and smoky. I detect... bacon fat... laced with honey melon.

Anyway, this movie is the story of when California wines really gained the respect of the world by beating the French wines at a blind tasting in Paris in 1976, historically referred to as the Judgement at Paris.

You have the father, who has a crazy dream of owning a vineyard and making great wine, just on the verge of the ultimate humiliation: having to beg for his old job back. This is Jim Barrett, played by Bill Pullman, who I saw in David Lynch's film Lost Highway--and it wasn't really his fault, the catastrophe that was Lost Highway.

Then you have his son, Bo Barrett, played by Chris Pine, who was in the latest Star Trek film as Captain Kirk. He is a hippie trying to find himself, still sporting long hair, though Woodstock happened, like, 7 years ago. He is in conflict with his father, and they settle their disputes in the boxing ring. He can't beat the old man in the ring, but he beats him in seizing the opportunity to take down the snobby French. Bo enters the French Competition in spite of his dad's objections.

[first lines]
Bo Barrett: [voice-over during a vineyard pan] It wasn't always like this. Before Paris, people didn't drink our wine. I mean, my friends did. But  you could hardly consider their palates discerning...
Bo Barrett: Hell, we were farmers... sort of...
[pan to what looks like out takes from Dazed and Confused but with the Montelena label on the wine bottles]

Then there is Gustavo, played by Freddy Rodrguez. He is a scrappy short guy who was Gio Rossi, one of Ugly Betty's boyfriends. Stavo is the proud son of Mexican immigrants. He wants not only respect for himself and his incredibly discerning palate, but also respect for California wine. He works for Bo's dad on the Montelena vineyard.

Gustavo Brambila: You people, you think you can just buy your way into this. You cannot do it that way.
Jim Barrett: All right...
Gustavo Brambila: You have to have it in your blood, you have to grow up with the soil underneath your nails, the smell of the grapes in the air that you breathe. The cultivation of the vine was an art form. The refinement of the vine is a religion that requires pain and desire and sacrifice.

Into the mix comes Sam, a UC Davis grad who comes to the vineyard to work as an intern. Sam is played by blonde from the land down under Rachael Taylor. She combines academic knowledge of agriculture with a love of the grape, and also possibly Bo... or Gustavo.

Sam: To Gustavo Brambila, renegade, who worships the sanctity of the vine.
Gustavo Brambila: And can't afford a full tank of gas.
[they toast].

All the women in this film seem to have men's names. Joe is played by Eliza Dushku, who was Missy in Bring it On and Sissy in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. She portrays the local barmaid who will play a pivotal role in the eventual triumph of California wine.

Steven Spurrier: This is good!
Joe: What were you expecting? Thunderbird?

Other pivotal roles are played by Alan Rickman and Dennis Farina. Rickman, familiar as Severus Snape from Harry Potter films, is Steven Spurrier, a British wine snob who opens his mind to the possibility that California wine may have surpassed the French. Farina is Maurice, a wine enthusiast who shows him the way.

Steven Spurrier: Great wine is great art, my friend. I am, in effect, a shepherd... whose mission is to offer the public another form of great art and to guide its appreciation thereof.
Maurice: Well, a shepherd... by definition, needs a flock. And a business, by necessity... needs customers.
Steven Spurrier: So, if I were to subscribe to that proviso would you be considered a customer?
Maurice: No. No, I would be considered... an enthusiastic... advocate.

The Bottom Line is that Bottle Shock combines a soundtrack of vintage 70's Rock by The Doobie Brothers, The Allman Brothers, Foghat, America, and Puccini with a feel-good story of how California wine kicked the door wide open, proving that the French weren't the only ones who knew how to make wine. It could be compared to Sideways, another story about Wine Enthusiasm, but from the vintners' point of view. It pairs well with Pinot--either Grigio or Noir. It even goes well with Merlot!

Steven Spurrier: ""Wine is sunlight, held together by water."" The poetic wisdom of the Italian physicist, philosopher, and stargazer, Galileo Galilei.

The film makers take a few liberties with historical facts, but this isn't a documentary, it's supposed to be an entertaining light comedy, and it delivers there!

I visited Pedone (sp) vineyards took back two bottles of RED for parents and VOILA explosion in the suitcase. I was never told that this was even a possibility but in 1976 it was well known? I am appreciative for the educational message and that Sonoma Airport allows more than one bottle carry-on rule, only place in US that I am aware.  I loved the film primarily due to the Francophile in me being set straight that USA is a proving ground of ingeniuty and there is hope for even more to come.  Lots of gratuitous fluff scenes and over acting but I love a winner and we did it again in '06, kudos CA!

The screenwriter distracts the audience with gratuitous sex and superficial relationships, either because the true story is so dull it's not much worth telling, and therefore needs jazzing up, or because the screenwriter believes gratuitous sex and superficial relationships are more worthy of chronicling than the maturation of an important U.S. industry.

Since this film does not pretend to be ""a true story"" but simply ""based on a true story"", the writer had license to tell it pretty much however he or she wanted. He should have used that latitude to embellish the truth with more full-bodied themes. This film, if it were wine, would be light-bodied and slightly sour; - fell short of its fuller and richer potential.",1328400000,,869,5.163120567375887

3690581,4,B001LPWGBY,"As I write this there are already 146 reviews covering this movie.  I am unlikely to add anything new.  I did want to say that I bought this movie in July and by November I had watched it twice.

I see that some reviewers are comparing this movie to Sideways, perhaps because they are both set in California's wine country.  The only real similarities between the two films are the settings and the ""sleeping around"" that goes on between characters in both movies.  I liked this film a lot, however, and didn't care for Sideways much at all.  I will admit, though, that I watched Sideways only once and that was a long time ago, so I don't remember much of the story.

I'm not a wine connoisseur nor am I concerned that this movie plays fast and loose with the facts.  I enjoyed the movie because it was a good story.

I see that at least one reviewer said that he trusted the reviews written by critics rather than the reviews written by the great unwashed (us) here on Amazon.  I am exactly the opposite.  I don't even read reviews written by professional critics anymore; those reviews have no correlation to my enjoyment of the movie.  I would rather have the opinion of lots of Amazon viewers.  It seems that it has worked out for me in this case.

One review started with, ""Hey folks. If you are a typical American boob, know nothing about wine, have never read anything about the ""Judgement of Paris"", don't appreciate good acting, editing, and especially good direction, then you will love this movie.""  I guess that's me.  I give it four stars just because it takes a lot to get five from me.",1325462400,,1601,4.450171821305842
3690582,4,B001LPWGBY,"Alan Rickman starts in this fabulous movie about how France had to give in when it came to California Wine. Rickman plays an Englishman living in Paris.  This Englishman has a wine store there, which needless to say is not a financial success.  Not so much because this gentlemen does not know his wine, but because, when it comes to wine, French rely only on their own to make recommendations on what the good wine is (yes - they are wine snobs).

This all changes when one day a word gets out that California's Napa Valley has some pretty good wines that match France in their quality.  Before long, the competition starts between two great countries on who produces superior wine.  It is 1976 and it is a historical event.  In a blind wine tasting competition preseided by all French jurors California wine wins the competition!  This historical event made a change in a way world perceives wine.  Talk about globalization!

3690590,5,B001LPWGBY,"This movie is loosely based on the story of a small, obscure 1976 wine tasting in Paris where several California wines (a Stags Leap cabernet and a Chateau Montelena chardonnay) literally ""shocked the world"" by beating the French. This movie focuses on the British entrepreneur (a wine merchant and educator in Paris) who put the competition together and the father-son team that ran the Montelena operation.

I have to admit I was a little nervous about the idea of Alan Rickman playing the Brit -- I've liked him in some movies and found him kind of unctuous in others. He was pitch-perfect in this one.

I was also a little nervous about this cute story getting the ""Hollywood"" treatment. I bumped into this story by accident shortly after the wine-tasting when I visited a friend in San Francisco who was one of those ""this is the best unknown restaurant in town"" types. We spent a day in Napa and amidst stops at Mondavi and a few of the big ones, he told me the story of the tasting and we stopped and took a look at the Stag's Leap operation (too small, of course, for a tasting room, but the proprietor was friendly and showed us around). In short, I've always been charmed by this story and was worried that the movie would hype it too much.

Well, there was a little of that, I'm sure, including a lot of father-son drama that I'm sure the producers invented. But it's a wonderful movie and in its essence it's true to what I know of the original story. A really charming, fun movie.",1312588800,,1493,4.481617647058823

The book Judgment of Paris by George M. Taber who was the only journalist (Time Magazine) present at the event in 1976 does more story development in it's first few pages (free Kindle preview available) than this entire movie delivers. The hope was this movie would be a home run like Sideways (which I rate five stars), it barely manages to get to first base.  I'm glad I watched it on NetFlix and did not buy it.

We have been seriously learning about wine the past few years & are in no way experts (yet).  However, when they finally got to the tasting competition & it was OUTSIDE?  I can't believe a serious competition that includes your sense of smell would take place outdoors?

3690597,4,B001LPWGBY,"For the facts in the fascinating story of the 1976 wine tasting event which laid the world of wine on its ear, read George Taber's excellent book, ""Judgment of Paris: California vs. France and the Historic 1976 Paris Tasting That Revolutionized Wine""; for an evening's entertainment on the subject (perhaps accompanied by a glass, or two, of good California wine), watch this delightful film.

This film interprets and portrays the actual events of the story in broad strokes, amplifying some details, downplaying others, and filling in between the factual events with a certain amount of interpretation for the sake of story. While valid points are made in some of the less-favorable reviews of this film concerning adherence to the facts, etc., I prefer to take this film in the spirit in which I feel it is being offered -- as an entertaining interpretation of events, and not a documentary. Alan Rickman's character is played as somewhat of a caricature -- but not to a point that I found objectionable -- and the level of contempt in which the French wine community held the rest of the world at the time is not exaggerated!

Visually, this film is a tour-de-force -- the cinematography catches the Napa Valley at its best, and though one of the 1-star reviewers took exception to this, complaining that the number of scenes shot in afternoon's golden light was unrealistic, I think that one of the things that film-making is about is visual beauty. As a native Californian (Northern & Central California) I love to see the beauty of The Golden State so well portrayed.

Of course, comparisons to ""Sideways"" are inevitable, though that film is more about the (completely) fictional characters than it is about wine, which is just a conduit through which the petty narrow-mindedness of Paul Giamatti's character, Miles, is projected to the viewer. The contemptible behavior of the main characters, Miles and Jack, throughout the film renders them so completely unsympathetic that (for me) it colors the enjoyment of the rest of the film.

3690600,1,B001LPWGBY,"There's no joy in writing a bad review, and I usually pass on the opportunity.  It's just that Bottle Shock is such a hugely disappointing film given the high expectations.  After all, it features an amazing cast, is filmed in the beautiful wine growing counties of California, and, most prominently, attempts to capitalize on the monstrous success of a certain previous Oscar winning film also featuring the humble grape.  One reviewer even writes ""The Next Sideways"" right on the front of the DVD case.  That critic either never saw Sideways or was heavily sedated (in ""drink and dial"" mode) when he wrote that blurb.  As other reviewers have commented, there's a jagged story-line, disappointing editing, and characters with apparently nothing intelligent, witty, or humorous to say.  There are bizarre subplots, like the friendly father-son boxing matches and, even more confusing, the Sam-Gustavo-Bo love triangle.  And the movie doesn't even make clear exactly what Spurrier's mission was, why it was financed, or how it saved his failing wine shop in Paris.  I could go on but won't.  Sideways was a beautifully written story with characters so vivid and alluring, even if in an idiosynchratic way, you wanted to personally meet them.  Though nominated for best supporting actor in that film, Thomas Church famously did not win the Oscar he so richly deserved.  Alan Rickman is similarly the kind of actor who demands your attention when he's on screen.  However, even Rickman cannot save Bottle Shock's tangled mess.  It is Film-Making 101 that a movie must either tell an intensely interesting story or, at the very least, introduce us to intensely interesting characters.  Unfortunately, Bottle Shock does neither.",1300406400,4,1724,5.199275362318841

Seconds of fine ensemble moments were followed by bits of lousy dialogue, rotten nonsympathetic characters, inconsistencies, plots that lead nowhere - and WHAT was wrong with that son's HAIR anyway?!  He was the most loathsome character in the movie, and he, in the end, turns likeable...sorta.  The promise of a really fine romance between two of the tangent characters goes absolutely nowhere.  Nothing is explained in any way that makes sense.  Why does Bill Pullman's character behave like such a pig about halfway into the movie, and what's with him and the physical abuse masquerading as boxing he shares with his son's character, and...I don't know.  My husband and I both were ready to huff glue about halfway through this monstrosity just to see if we could get the story to actually develop in some way that made sense, get some explanations for pieces that seemed stitched in just to fluff out the movie, and somewhere develop some sympathy for the winemaking family the film is based on.  Much ado about nothing.  Too bad a real-life dreams can come true story is on film as THIS disaster. It would have to have been developed into a mini-series to explain all the subplots and peripheral characters and motivations...or just concentrated on Alan Rickman's character, for example, and shown us HIS story alone.

Regardless, although the story was certainly embellished in many ways (was Bo Barrett really a lazy pothead, and did that winning wine in Paris really start off the wrong color on its trip?), I particularly enjoyed the character and acting of Steven Spurrier (Alan Rickman), the British wine shop owner in Paris, as he discovered the potential for California's premier wines and as he staged the famous tasting event.

And the big tasting being held in a wreck of a building? No freaking way in heck!!!

That said, I will watch Alan Rickman in anything. Watching him sniff, swirl, sip and spit is pure pleasure. Bill Pullman is great in this, if a little one note (it's the writing, not him), and Freddy Garcia is very good. The cinematography is wonderful, particularly when they swoop over Napa.

Off he goes to the Napa Valley to find the best American vintages to compete in a blind tasting. He runs into a rag-tag bunch of cliches all clamoring to be seen and heard -- the proud former lawyer who chucked it in to run a vineyard and is on the verge of going broke; his hippy wastrel son; his proud Mexican employee and his attractive blond bombshell summer intern.

Don't know how I originally heard about it but I liked it much better than Sideways. We spent 3 days in Sonoma over the weekend and well, had to come home and buy the movie! Funny but it was filmed in Sonoma County, not Napa, but who cares--beautiful country. Winery scenes filmed at ""Kunde Winery"" (we tasted there), French store scenes filmed at ""Della Santino"" (we ate there), and found out that Chat. Montelena was in Napa which we didn't have time to go to. I love things French, Alan Rickman, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman and they are very fine. While at one winery I mentioned I loved the Doobies' songs on the soundtrack and the pourer said ""BR Cohn"" winery was started by the manager of the Doobies so had to go there as well--bought a case of Doobie Red wine and two of their CD's to listen to in the limo. Now I'm ordering the DVD so I will have it in my library to watch whenever I like!

The waitress that served him retorts, ""What were you expecting...Thunderbird?""...and everything escalates from that point forward.

The book really is head and shoulders better than the film which portrays only one wine and the associated people who brought that wine to Paris.

Chris Pine's hair was the only distraction...terrible wig,they could have pulled it back for a Count of Monte Cristo look, but I suppose that would have softened the hippie thing he was going for.

The vinyard worker ,Gustave was such an appealing character that you will be disapointed to see that he doesn't get the girl...he was the better man, too good for the girl, still it would have been nice to have the better man win the girl and the chance to represent the Napa Vineyards. Caution for those presenting this to non adult viewers..a nonmarried couple sleep together..just because. There also is alot of drugs being used/implied use though it's not shown as a positive thing.

3690642,4,B001LPWGBY,"I'm used to finding very low-rent stuff on late-night Showtime, but last night I found a small gem. I didn't even know the name of the movie to start with, having missed the first couple of minutes; but the sight of Alan Rickman and Dennis Farina held my interest, and I'm glad I stayed with it.

The time is 1976, a year when France still held sway as the world leader in wine. Alan Rickman plays Steven Spurrier, a displaced Brit sommalier in France, wondering how to better his business. A friend, Maurice (played by Dennis Farina in an unusual role for him), challenges Mr Spurrier to go to California and collect some California-bred wine to bring back in a blind taste test against the French wine, to establish that French is, indeed, the best.

Mr Spurrier arrives in Wine Country driving, of all things, a Gremlin. This was, of course, a minor plot device, but a charmer; I smiled when I saw it. And, of course, he has car trouble, and is assisted by the vintner through whose fields he has been driving. Their initial exchange - hard-working farmer, snooty sommalier - was amusing, as of course the farmer had the last word...which rattles the sommalier enough to inspire him to seek out the farmer's ranch later on.

This is a movie-fied true story, with the requisite embellishments; there was a wine showdown in France in 1976 between the French and Californian wines, with the personnel headlining the movie. Until 1976, California wines were considered very low-class(I was even convinced of this fantasy), and the blind taste test which was organized was the turning point, when the world came to realize that California was not the poor relation the wine barons overseas were trying to maintain.

With good acting from the other principals in the cast (including Bill Pullman as the California vintner), this was an enjoyable little movie. Alan Rickman was his stuffy best(nobody plays I'm-better-than-you as well), and Dennis Farina, in a not-very-big role, was fun - he rarely does a role I can't watch. Not Oscar material, but worth a couple hours of your time.",1262995200,,2081,4.788300835654596

3690644,2,B001LPWGBY,"What a disappointment. Alan Rickman is a fine actor but his cliche' of a snobby British man living in Paris who has trouble selling his wines might have worked. Unfortunately, we then get to know the rest of the cast including a terrible 70's parody of Chris Pine in a weave, yes, a weave (I guess being the big up and coming bad boy had him in demand too much for him to take a few months to actually grow his hair out) pretending very broadly at being the prodigal son to a rather stoic Bill Pullman. The British wine expert goes to Napa Valley California to see if his moocher pal, played by Dennis Farina, is right about the growing quality of California wines.
There's more to this trip, not the least of which is that this is very loosely based on an actual event where the wines gathered in Napa are brought to France to compete in a blind taste test against French wine and some of the Napa brands are selected as superior.
Great premise, right? After all we have the Doobie Bros. providing the soundtrack, the incredible Napa Valley setting, the great and always (and still again) wasted Freddy Rodriguez actually looks like he's getting the girl as well as proving what a great vintner his character's become.....
....and still, this hatchet job, waste of a film manages to curdle my cheese so many times it had to become laughable in order for me to finish it. And not humorously so, just so bad and predictable that I spent over half the film broadcasting what was going to happen next (the accuracy not so hard to manage with laughs all around).
Freddy manages to get this film the one star it deserves and the setting nudges it up another star but I'm being much too nice to this movie because the negatives really wipe those stars out. Then, I remember the premise, and the idea of what film could have been and I slap those two stars back up. I'm a sap, but in this case it's very hard to pretend that I don't want to lambast this entire effort.",1261699200,2,1961,4.3901098901098905

Alan Rickman is a great actor, and made his small scenes perfect. He delivered his lines with aplomb and verve. Otherwise, though, all the boring Hollywood cliches came roaring out of their cages to hunt down and exterminate any freshness this film may have had. I don't really care how historically accurate this was; I'm not expecting ""truth"". But I am expecting something other than every dull and predictable story line to appear. I could list a ton, but we had a phony wine identifying, Maria Callas, the beautiful girl in the dying VW, the jealousy between rivals for said pretty girl. (Did anyone think she could appear on the scene without her sleeping with someone?) All old stuff, all done before, all utterly predictable and cold. The dialog was trite, the acting bland, the excitement as exciting as watching the Yankees play their double-A farm team. Gee, I wonder what will happen.

I myself am not a wine connoisseur, however that did not diminish my enjoyment of this film one iota.  This film only added to my ever growing enjoyment of independent films over the all flash and no substance of the big budget Hollywood films.

Alan Rickman, Dennis Farina, and Bill Pullman are the crowd pleasers here.  Their characters are witty, charming and endearing in their own respective ways.  Rickman's and Farina's characters bring a great amount of humor to the screen as a Parisian wine shop owner and his somewhat Philistine but always loyal American customer.  As always, the moments that Rickman is on the screen are the most enjoyable moments of the film, and are a pleasure to savor.  Bill Pullman also succeeded in this film as being someone that you wanted to root for - it is one of the best roles I have seen him in.

The only weak point of the film, in my opinion were the actors playing the younger characters.  They were rather lackluster - typical of most young actors.  They don't possess screen presence, nor the talent to hold your attention.  I got the feeling they were just reading their lines.  Luckily though, their scenes pass quickly and then it's on to the better actors in the film.

On the whole, I found the movie to be quite good.  The story was fascinating and amusing.  The underachievement of the younger characters is easily outweighed by the true acting talent in the film, thereby making it a truly enjoyable experience.",1254873600,2,1610,4.6

3690655,4,B001LPWGBY,"It was one of those movies where I REALLY wish it had a better director and/or writer.  There was a interesting story to tell there, but the director and scriptwriters muddied it up.

There are good solid performances all around.  Alan Rickman was his usual fine self as the Brit living in France who comes up with the idea of the event.  He's droll, dry, and sarcastic.  Renting the film is worth it for his performance alone.  Bill Pullman is very stoic and tightly wound as Jim Barrett, the winery owner who has staked everything he owns on the little-winery-that-could and is having a financial melt-down.  Chris Pine, dressed in classic mid-70's garb and hair, is the ne'er-do-well useless son who is finding his place in the world.  Freddy Rodriquez, a favorite of mine,  is very good as Gustavo and just about steals the story.  Dennis Farina plays himself, but ""himself"" is always an interesting guy <g>

The film is set at a time when all of the wineries didn't have big showrooms and didn't even charge for tastings--and wine is a whole $6 bucks a bottle!  But the basic story is a good one, and although they have fictionalized much of it, the wines were made and they did win.  Following that, a small article in Time magazine brought Napa and its wines to a wider consumer base.

The problem is that the screenwriters included a fictional character to support a unnecessary fictional love story.  Also problematic is that the script actually makes the secondary characters more interesting than the lead characters.  For example, there is a secondary storyline about the winemakers assistant, Gustavo (although oddly, the winemaker who actually created the winning wine isn't even mentioned - what's with that?).  Gustavo is the son of a field hand who has been making his own wine on the side while working for Barrett.  He dreams of making wines and knows that he has to goods to deliver.  (In real life he eventually opens his own boutique winery, GustavoThrace.)  But Gustavo's story was actually more compelling than the Barrett prodigal son one, and I wish more time had been spent on it.  He also forms the third side of the love triangle and the problem is that even though he's cast as the guy who loses the girl, you can't help but feel he really should have gotten the girl (despite Chris Pine's considerable attractions <g>)

But of course, nobody should have gotten the girl because they didn't need the girl to tell this story in the first place; it could have stood on its own without all that.  I suppose the argument could be made the girl was representative of the female winemakers who would come to Napa, but that's a stretch.  Mostly the character is just there to get wet and add sex appeal.

So it's this kind of thing where the story hits some bumps.  This is not to say it sucks, it doesn't.  As long as you're willing to accept that except for the outcome of the French tasting, it's pretty much fiction, I give it a very solid B- for entertainment value and good acting.

There are NO REDEEMING QUALITIES to this movie!!! In fact, this sad joke, and all of the adulatory 4 and 5 star reviews, pretty much tells you all you need to know about American culture and taste. The real question is why George Taber sold the book to the morons who made this travesty.

I keep asking myself-why did they write this story-and for the real idiotic reviewers who say it's ""based on a true story-but not true"" well excuse me but haven't they insulted ALL of the real characters who are real people? The funny thing is this reminds me of ""Secretariat""-gee, why did Time magazine put a horse on it's cover? Well there were a few things going on in the US, and the world, back in 1973, which by the way, is when the wines were made, as well as when Secretariat won the Triple Crown, so perhaps there might have been a good background story to tell, and to educate the public who weren't around at the time.

Bottle Shock tells an unknown story of Californian wine beating French wine in a surprise blind taste test (no one was more surprised than the French).

Having the US as the Underdog, seeing the passion of the wine makers and seeing the French being served makes this an absolutely wonderful 2 hours.

Bill Pullman was superb, Alan Rickman portrayed the quintessential snobbish Britt, Rachael Taylor was stunning and Dennis Farina was ""Bacon Fat with a hint of Ripe Mellon!""",1251158400,,667,4.990990990990991
3690660,4,B001LPWGBY,"Bill Pullman and Alan Rickman have been favorite actors of mine for a long, long time, and it is enjoyable to see them together in a film that is quietly pleasant and quietly touching at the same time. No life-or-death danger from evil alien beings here--or from evil magical creatures of the spirit world--just the ""spirit""-world magic that yeast works on grapes.

Pullman's character has been making the best California wine he can--and is about to go broke doing so.

Rickman's character, thousands of miles away in Paris, arranges a ""blind taste test"" between those who produce famous French wines and those who have been producing virtually unknown and belittled California wines--and the results are just what any viewer would expect (including those who are not old enough to recall the real historical event).

Although its main outcome can be foreseen, this film does have a little suspense thrown in concerning the destruction of Pullman's product--and a minor love story. And for Rickman's fine comic performance alone, it is worth a couple hours of your life.

You say you can't tell the difference between lemonade-plus-vodka and wine? Well, you don't even need to be able to taste the difference between whiskey and beer to enjoy this ""feel good,"" based-on-fact film. (It may help, but it's not essential.)",1250985600,,1320,5.0691244239631335

The actors are all handsome people, and the stars, especially Pullman and Rickman, give very fine performances. I was not familiar with Chris Pine, but I'll make myself familiar.

The 1970s rock and roll that pepper the soundtrack are well chosen cuts from among others the Doobie Brothers and Allman Brothers, and the recording sparkle in the HD stream I watched. The movie written for the movie was very fine, and I'll watch it again and focus on that element. Too bad they did not issue a CD recording of the music they used for the album.

When this comes out on Blu Ray, I'll buy it. If you are a wine lover, you will watch this over and over with friends and a good wine.",1250553600,,851,4.379746835443038
3690662,3,B001LPWGBY,"Bottle Shock in the based on a true story tale of how the California Wineries found validation in the 1970's (or as the tagline simply states, a true story of love, victory and fermentation... cute.)

Jim Barrett(Bill Pullman) has lost his love for the process of wine making, or it feels like that anyway...a midlife crisis of sorts seems to have left him feeling lost.(As we surely all have felt at some point or another)

His son, Bo Barrett(Chris Pine) on the other hand has all the passion and lacks the know-how and restraint to do things like a mature adult.

Of course when Steven Spurrier(The great, Alan Rickman) comes into town from Europe and offers them a chance to prove themselves and their product against the greatest French wines, they really must come together to achieve success.

This blind wine tasting not only has the Barret family at the edge of their wits, but the whole town becomes involved in this event, trying to prove to the world that California can produce great wine too!

It's predictable maybe, formulaic sure but that doesn't mean it's not good. Bottle Shock delivers that great feel good feeling that you can't help but shake after watching and if that's not enough for you Alan Rickman is simply hilarious.

Randall Miller may be the most inept director I've seen in some time.  He has absolutely no idea what to do with the camera and an editing sytle that borders on psychotic.  Chris Pine evokes absolute revulsion in his characterization of Bo.  (Did he really show up at the Paris contest in the same t-shirt he wore in Napa?  Help me.)

Pretty boy Chris Pine (who i like now, after seeing the mega watt new Star trek reboot and his appearence on Talk shows. He is the son of Late actor Robert Pine from ""CHiPs"" and ""Picket Fences"") is unrecognizable with long hair but he's actually pretty good.
Okay, now the acting from the older pros, on the money and excellent. Both Farina and Rickman are so likeable in so many things you really can't quibble on their chemistry (I suspected the Farina character to be gay and had a crush on Rickman's character).

3690671,4,B001LPWGBY,"I absolutely LOVED this movie!  Yes, Hollywood took some liberties, but then they always do.  The movie industry unfortunately has the same attitude as Madison Ave.  Us ""consumers"" are too unsophisticated and have too short of an attention span to watch anything that doesn't have at least SOME sex and mayhem in it, thus they the added plot contrivences.  That said, the movie was heartwarming and the cast was excellent.  For vinophiles who get really technical, this movie may be too much ""fluff""; it's not ""Sideways"" in terms of vinology, but it IS a great ""underdog"" story and background on the beginnings of Napa Valley.

The family dynamics and internal struggles of Jim Barrett and his son Bo could have had a better set-up in the movie, but what is given is enough to afford the viewer a sense of the origins of the father and son relationship as it is presented at the film's opening.  Bill Pullman, as the father, does his usual excellent job at character acting.

Alan Rickman is at his snobbiest as Steven Spurrier, the sommelier who owns a failing wine store and ""academe"" in Paris.  He and Dennis Farina decide to bring the ""wines of the world"" to his shop and organize a blind taste test with the judging panel comprised of the most ""elite"" wine experts in France.  No one portrays resigned disdain better than does Rickman and as Spurrier, he is superb.  He also has impeccable comedic timing with which he deftly accents his character's portrayal.

It has been said that a lot of ""poetic license"" has been taken with the actual facts behind the real story.  Be that as it may, this is a very enjoyable and uplifting movie.",1245628800,,1640,4.672473867595818

Bottle Shock is that. And more. A Brit, living and ""teaching"" in Paris, isn't quite in the inner circle of wine experts. Though he knows his juice, no one is even remotely interested in anything he might have to say. His neighboring shopkeeper is an American with big suggestions (Farina). Together they decide to host an international wine blind taste test. In 1976, in celebration of the American and French connection, they will test the rumor that California wines are actually deserving of the word wine on their labels.

Alan Rickman plays the misunderstood wine snob oh so well. Amusing in his dry delivery and his new passion for his discovery that not only should California be on the wine map, but that it might turn France into the little brother of wines.

A father/son vintner team (Pullman/Pine) struggle with money issues, relational garbage and the remnants of Woodstock while trying to make a few bottles of the perfect chardonnay in California. Another young man (Rodriguez), with wine in his blood and the soil of California in his soul, shoots for a red that makes men cry and women fall in love.

Surprisingly clean, this film contains a few intimate scenes that mostly play out off-screen and surprisingly few curse words. I remember one F-bomb and just a smattering of the standard movie fare regulars. There is a bong scene at a party and some drunk patrons in a couple of bar scenes. But most kids aren't going to be willing to sit through the movie's quieter moments. There are some truly amusing moments, beautiful scenery and poignant scenes. Poetry pops up unexpectedly both in photography and words. Several scenes are in French with English subtitles.

The movie is about the characters and contains some great acting and writing. Those who get bored with character pieces might want to pass. However, my taste runs toward ""making toast"" movies, as my daughter has dubbed it. Those are the movies where characters go about the normal activities of the day and grow and change through circumstances and character tweaking.

Here, we meet again Alan Rickman (best-known for his role in the Harry Potter film series, as the snarling and sinister Snape). This time, however, he's Steven Spurrier, an amusing British  dirty blond, the middle-aged proprietor of a failing Paris wine-tasting ""academy,"" ahem, business. His exceedingly poor French pronunciation earns him a snub from even the sommelier at classiest City of Light annual vintners' event: He is nearly rejected at the door, and upon indignantly showing his ticket, is seated at the last table in the rear, by the swinging dining room door.

Bottle Shock is based on the true story of a taste test featuring wine from Napa Valley against the best of France.  In this light comedy Rickman shines as Steven Spurrier, the enterprising Brit living in France, who only wants to sell more wine in his shop.  The plot is obvious from the start, the California segment is predictable, but the joy is watching Alan Rickman doing what he does best.  Am I a Rickman fan?  Oh yes, definitely, but he is the best under-rated British actor today.",1236211200,2,771,5.555555555555555
3690701,5,B001LPWGBY,"I found this movie almost by accident and I must say that it was a wonderful find.  I'd classify it as a light comedic drama.

The story centers on two fronts:

The first is the story of a small struggling vinyard in California with Bill Pullman at its head raising a 26year old teenage son, Chris Pine, who is still living like its Woodstock 1969, only its the 1970s.  Bill has a small group of mexican workers, played very well by Freddy Rodriguez and Miguel Sandoval and a bright up and coming intern, Rachael Taylor, who comes to work at the vineyard.  Pullman is in debt and had left the city to follow his passion and build great wines in California.  We imagine that all the wine growers of the region have similar stories...just a bunch of ex hippies with ties to academia working the land planting grapes and hoping that one day their wines will be recognized for their greatness.

The second - on the other side of the ocean in Paris, the wonderful actor Alan Rickman plays a British Expat who runs an academy for Wines...only all his wines are French.  His partner, another wonderfully talented actor David Farina, tells Rickman that his problem is that the Academy only deals with French wines and that the game is about the world.  So Alan Rickman sets up a blind wine tasting competition between American and French Wines for the American bicentennial (well FRENCH wines vs american wines)...with the French Flag three times bigger than the American flag on the pamphlet.  Rickman comes to America and tastes wines from the Californian wines and picks the best ones to take back to France.

You know what happens, in 1976 on the American bicentennial, in a blind taste test, American wines took the #1 spot in both White and Red categories over French wines (the French picked American wines as the best...by mistake I'm sure).  This put California on the map and those poor hippies, well they became snobs too and bought ferraris.

Overall, the story told here is great.  Its what I would call ""relaxful""....you know what's going to happen, there's some comedy, a light love triangle (very light), some pretty scenery, some tremendous acting, lots of truly great actors, and a great story of how the underdog hippie grew up to drive the 7 Series BMW...go figure, some things never change.

So why hairy....well, this was the 1970s and the weather in California was hot and I have to say that throughout the entire movie (with the exception of Bill Pullman), everyone in the movie appeared to have six days growth of hair....everyone seemed hairy, in the true classical hippie tradition (many of my friends are hippies or sons/daughters of hippies so no disrespect meant there) just that this movie is firmly set in the 1970s and they replicated everything including the clothing, dressing styles, and yes the HAIR.  Hilarious.

Its a great movie and a timeless story of us taking our snobby French neighbors down a peg or two.  Who doesn't enjoy that.  All in good fun fellow French friends, the French do make great wines and Lafite is still my favorite albeit its hard to afford these days.",1236038400,9,3107,4.720370370370371
3690702,5,B001LPWGBY,"I ordered this movie purely as fan of Alan Rickman work. I was pleasantly surprised  however with the quality of the film. I knew that I would likely enjoy Rickman's acting (as he is incapable of anything less than a great performance), however solid acting by Bill Pullman and  Dennis Farina really made it a better than good film in my opinion. The plot of the film immediately caught and held my attention and toward the end you find yourself really rooting for the underdog Americans. You don't need to be a wine connoisseur to enjoy this movie!!",1235952000,3,550,4.6020408163265305

The Los Angeles Times had a very good review of it so couldn't wait until it came on DVD.  I shared it with friends and they all loved it as well.  Don't miss this if you like a good story with expert acting!  I did like it much better than ""Sideways"".  Agree with the other positive reviews.  This is a ""don't miss""!  The chemistry between Rickman and Farina is so special, I'd really like to see them together in another movie! For the young ladies, Chris Pine must be one really good looking hunk if he just got a shave and a haircut!  Cute guy and a pretty good actor as well.",1235952000,5,728,4.034965034965035

The story is interesting though a great deal of poetic license was taken--the main winemaker Michael Grgich was left out of the movie!  Anyway, it was still enjoyable.  Made me thirsty for some fine wine.",1235952000,,338,4.694915254237288
3690705,4,B001LPWGBY,"Anyone who has visited Napa Valley, or even enjoyed the wine from that area, will enjoy this little gem of a film.

Based on the true story of the competition which put Napa on the wine map and kicked open the doors of the previously closed world of premier wine-makers.  This blind taste test event opened the eyes of the world to the concept that non-French wines could be great, and the result has caused a boom in the industry from wineries around the world.

The performances are very good, but are highlighted by Alan Rickman as the snooty Brit (a stretch, naturally).

This story is at once educational and heartwarming.  If you don't find yourself cheering for the underdogs, you will certainly learn about the creation of wine.

Give this one a try.",1235779200,,758,4.619402985074627
3690706,4,B001LPWGBY,Having read Taber's Judgement of Paris two years ago I loved watching this movie to see the characters come to life. Despite Taber's excellent portrayal of the event I always felt that the Californians where much older then some actually were. True this is a youthful feel good movie but it also has a great story. I would have like to have seen more about how most of the vintners where bankers and lawyers with a dream but having the youth be dreamful is just as good.,1235692800,,470,4.413793103448276
3690707,5,B001LPWGBY,If you enjoy California wine and European wine and discussing the differences you will love Alan Rickmann's performance; based on a true event and story.  Humor and character interplay makes this a truly entertaining movie.,1235692800,2,223,5.371428571428571
3690708,4,B001LPWGBY,"Bottle Shock was a wonderful movie that was somewhat unexpected.  The movie brought some old time stars and some new faces to the screen that enlightened us the entire movie.  This movie is educational, entertaining, and one of those movies that makes you proud to be an American!

There were laughs and moments of intensity, there were times of romance and times of relationship frustration.  All of those characteristics pulled together made it extremely enjoyable.  I think that if you are a wine fan and enjoyed the movie Sideways for the wine parts you will enjoy this more than the average movie watcher.  If you have no interest or not much in wine it doesn't mean that you won't enjoy the movie, it may just be somewhat less entertaining.

I think that you should get a good bottle of wine out of the cellar or wine rack and sit down to a wonderful movie about wine, life, and the struggle it takes to fulfill your dreams.  Enjoy!",1235606400,,938,4.574850299401198

few questions though: The sword use had to embellishment right? Could
you really rent a Gremlin? What's with the boxing?",1235174400,,334,4.677966101694915
3690712,2,B001LPWGBY,"If you are not that interested in wine or learning anything about the '76 tasting, then you'll probably enjoy this movie. It's a very superficial 'feel-good' story of a father & son & hot intern. Even as such, you never get to know or care about the characters very much.

I get that this isn't supposed to be an educational documentary but a few more details would have been nice. For instance - why was the Napa wine better? What are the high-level differences in winemaking style between France & US? What happened at the red wine tasting? Was the tasting really held in a run-down building with no roof?

I really wanted to see this movie and really wanted to like this movie. I am very interested in wine & viticulture and any film that promotes and feeds this interest, I have to see. But honestly this movie was disappointing.",1234569600,6,833,4.509933774834437
3690713,4,B001LPWGBY,"The subject is the so-called Judgment of Paris--the blind tasting in which California wines defeated French wines and shocked the world.  The film tells part of the story: the efforts of the individual--Steve Spurrier--who mounted the event and the Barrett family in Calistoga, the proprietors of Chateau Montelena.  To add drama and conflict the film adds a father-son set-to among the Barretts and a love triangle with the younger Barrett, a female intern at the winery and a Latino employee, who would go on to run his own winery.

Chateau Montelena won with its Chardonnay, but nothing is said (until the film's end) about Stag's Leap's victory in the Cabernet competition.  Similarly, nothing is said about Chateau Montelena's winemaker, Mike Grgich, a then limited partner whose great 1973 Chardonnay enabled him to form a partnership with Austin Hills to form Grgich Hills, which is still known for the quality of its Chardonnay, while Chateau Montelena is now known as well for its superb Cabernet.

Bottom line: this is a slightly schmaltzy take on a historically-significant subject, but one that still works cinematically.  The wine country offers fantastic views, of course, and the Montelena scenes are shot at its stunning facility--a castle carved out of the side of the earth, forming, in effect, a man-made cave in Calistoga.

The DVD includes interviews with the Barretts and a brief account of the winery and its standards and aspirations.  All in all, this is a nice film.  I also recommend the often-overlooked film, Year of the Comet, for wine lovers.",1233878400,6,1573,5.089494163424124

3690716,4,B001LPWGBY,"I'll admit that I am a sucker for Alan Rickman, and I watch pretty much anything he does by default.  I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how drawn-in to this film I was.  I'm not sure how accurate to the actual historical event this movie is, but I found myself sucked into the the lives of the Napa Valley winemakers.  I wanted to smack Alan Rickman for being so snobbish, which says a great deal considering I usually want to give him a hug.  But he does a good job making his character just crass enough to annoy you, but not enough to make you dislike him.

Of course the plot is predictable--to the extent that almost all sports movies are predictable.  But the actors do a good job taking you on the journey with them, though the subplot with the little romantic triangle felt a little forced.

All in all, I was quite happy with the film and it gave me a deeper appreciation for wine.",1233532800,5,908,4.2748538011695905

People had a great time watching the movie while drinking some of the same wines from the famous tasting (newer vintages). It is true that a lot of artistic licence has been taken, so if you care about the real facts, read The Judgement of Paris (excellent book). However, there are some hilarious lines, Alan Rickman is fabulous, and the scene of the tasting itself is a must for anyone that cares about wine. Personally, I would fast forward through the love-triangle scenes (""Jules and Jim"" this film is not). Any wine lover who doesn't see it because of the negative comments about it not perfectly following the facts will be missing out on a very enjoyable film.",1233446400,64,785,4.496503496503497

Instead of being a story about the rise and recognition of the US wine industry and the people behind it, it becomes a tale of a burnout son, a hussy intern, and a lot of bad acting.

It is filled with a good musical score, wonderful scenery and a fun story that just makes you want to root for the underdog.  It is a feel good film which was just what we needed this summer when it came out.  Bill Pullman and Alan Rickman were of course wonderful as they always are.  It is a good little movie and I really enjoyed it.  Great movie for pulling the cork out of your favorite wine, proping up your feet and enjoying.

3690722,3,B001LPWGBY,"Bottle Shock is a little known film that certainly was not released in theaters anywhere near where I live. I was finally able to view it recently on DVD and the only reason I even bothered was because of Alan Rickman. The man can do no wrong-acting wise. He can turn a movie with a not-so-interesting topic and make it funny and enjoyable for two hours.

Unfortunately, Rickman is not in the movie for 2 hours, just here and there. But when he's on, he's spot on. You can't fake that type of humour and you can't really call it acting. It just is. He is a master at it and can do it in his sleep.

The rest of the cast is somewhat bland and has nothing to do. Bill Pullman does what he can in a boring role and the younger cast feels wasted. If you love everything about wine, you'll probably like this film alot. If you are indifferent, like I was, well...I probably would not have watched this if Alan Rickman was not in it.

Supposedly, though based on actual events, the film version is sketchy and not 100% faithful so you can't even go by that. I knew what would happen way before the movie ended so really there was no suspense or build-up and even the ending lacked excitement.

Bottle Shock is a mediocre comedy that is only made so because of Rickman's performance. And that's pretty much all there is to this film.",1231113600,3,1326,4.292
3690723,5,B001LPWGBY,"I loved this movie--can't wait for the DVD. Yes- I've preordered.

Just a word of warning--it is very weakly based on a true events that occurred in 1976 (2 California wines from 2 different wineries - the second winery is not part of this story) took first place (different categories) in a wine competition in Paris and caught the world's attention. The movie 'story': love triangle, father-son boxing matches, poor near broke 'former' lawyer etc are all Hollywood inventions. So do not take it as history (read the book Judgment in Paris for that) but enjoy it as a story.",1229990400,3,575,4.75
