From the back cover:

BLOOD THIRST:  The blood-drained bodies of women are being discovered all over Manilla, so the Police contact a sex-crimes expert to investigate.  Soon he discovers the cult of the ""Golden Goddess,"" a monstrous woman who stays young through ritualistic killings.

CASTLE OF BLOOD:  While in London, author Edgar Allen Poe wagers that British journalist Alan Foster can't spend an entire night in the haunted castle of Poe's friend Sir Thomas Blackwood.  Foster accepts, and once inside the castle, he meets various men and women, who explain to him that they are lost souls being forced to reenact their demises on the anniversary that they occurred.

BLOOD THIRST is a middling film with a monster that should have been on camera more.

CASTLE OF BLOOD has the French title DANSE MACABRE.  In fact, all the credits and anything written in the film is in French.  The print is fullscreen, but it is actually a longer print.  It contains some dialogue that was never dubbed into English, and a brief bit of nudity.  Not a bad film to watch some rainy night.",1282348800,,1183,4.768472906403941
