7505488,3,B017HP18WO,I have loved all things ballet since I was just a young girl but this show falls short for me. The story line with Claire is unsettling. Very few of the characters have redeeming qualities. I watched to whole season but I probably won't watch the next one. The dancing was beautiful though.,1450310400,4,290,4.490566037735849
7505489,2,B017HP18WO,"If you watch it then let it only be for the dancing which is very beautiful. The plot is very dramatic, unnecessarily complicated and twisted to make you believe there is some kind of big message when there isn't. It's not terrible but it's not worth the time spent watching it in my opinion.",1450051200,6,292,4.425925925925926
7505490,3,B017HP18WO,"This is a dark and, well, somewhat disturbing series about the neurosis with the performing arts.

There are a lot of sex scenes, strippers, cocaine use, other drug use, financial problems (1% style) - a dictator-demonic artistic director, suicide attempts...the list goes on.

In some ways the series disappointed because the plot had (some) very stereotypical roles and perceptions of ballet (cat fighting among ballerinas, eating disorders, drug use, ""prima ballerina attitude"", a mean director that treats the company cast like crap - spoiler - someone even leaves s*** on his pillow!).

Other times, the series and writers were trying just too hard to be profound, poetic, and force in artistic lyrical - like dialogue. The execution of which just didn't pull off as authentic and other times honestly just felt ""off"". A homeless man (who befriends the main character) makes little sense when speaking - and then suddenly in the stairwell busts out Virginia Woolf-like prose from the book he is writing (in his head no less)- and then goes back to making no sense. There are other efforts to include ""symbols"" and metaphors in the series too...and when it's being acted out sometimes the attempts made me feel like Showtime had just met high school English class.

That aside, look, I watched the entire series in about two days; it sucks you into a dark, deeply disturbing world that borders on mental sanity. If that was the goal of the series - well they accomplished it. You want to know what happens to the characters, how they evolve, and ultimately what their fate will be. The dancing is good - and I loved that they used professional dancers (who did a great job acting too!).

All in all - it may be that deeply dark, disturbing art - that is so disturbing albeit it is out of touch with reality...is just not for me That said, if you like House of Cards (esp Season 3 which got very dark and twisted) and the movie Black Swan - then you will probably like this series.",1449964800,4,1984,4.722543352601156
7505491,5,B017HP18WO,"Very realistic. There are no words to describe how 'binge-able' this show is. I found myself connecting with the characters and even thinking and missing them during my work hours. I felt this was based off of some true life story or novel. The writing, acting, and dancing, were excellent. I hope there will be more episodes.",1449964800,4,326,4.7368421052631575
7505492,5,B017HP18WO,"I'm not sure why this show hasn't gotten more attention, or critical acclaim that it has.  Although I can certainly see why it won't appeal to everyone - as its' subject matter is very dark, and at times uncomfortable to watch.  It was created by one of the producers AND WRITERS for Breaking Bad.  She actually won an Emmy for her writing on that series(B.B.), and wrote several episodes for this new series as well.  I don't think I can give a greater nod to the writing and craftsmanship of Flesh & Bone than that. It feels like it almost could have been based on a novel.
  After watching the first episode, I actually binged and watched all 8 episodes over the course of 2 days. I rarely do that. It was easy to get swept up by the story, and the hours just sort of flew away.
  I will often judge how great a movie was by whether or not I find myself still thinking about the next day, and after words I couldn't stop thinking about F&B.  I was disappointed to find out that it will not be returning for a second season - but please don't let that stop from you watching, the writers really did do a great job of tying up any loose ends by the final episode.  I wasn't left feeling cheated, or wondering what happened to ""so and so"" and so forth.  Hope you give it a chance if you haven't already.  It's a long enough season to feel fulfilling, but not so long that it's intimidating to start.  All in all a great series, definitely something very different from anything else on TV.",1449792000,63,1489,4.2562277580071175
7505493,5,B017HP18WO,"I used to dance ballet. A long time ago. So any of these drama/dance type films are a must see for me.
Center Stage was and still is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is no Center Stage. Familiar face Sascha Radetsky joins the cast in a completely different role than our beloved Charlie from Center Stage.
Set in present day NYC we follow Calire (Hays) as she joins the ABC. Each episode goes deeper into the dark side of ballet. Sex, drugs and dance. While the main focus is Claire,we meet several cast members and get to know their stories a little better also.
While I was never anywhere near ABC ballet material, this gives an interesting take because it's not all pink bows and tutus. It's more of a serious drama.
Hour long episodes.
Each episode is titled after a military term and the definition is given underneath. I think that's interesting. Military and ballet though the show had nothing to do with military. Not really.
Ballet like I've never seen it before.
The opening theme ""Obsession"" by Karen O used to annoy me the first two times I heard it but it quickly grew on me. I think it's a great song for what the show is about. My here's some twisted parts of the story I didn't think I was ready to accept.
Very good acting. Fresh faces I'm not familiar with and the dancing is real.
This NEEDS to be made into an actual show not just a mini series.
If you're into drama, dance and twists----you gotta watch this show.
Flesh and Bone is addictive.",1449014400,13,1474,4.383211678832117

7505495,5,B017HP18WO,"Many aspects of the compelling new ballet-set melodrama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flesh-and-Bone/dp/B017HP18WO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flesh and Bone</a>&nbsp;recommend it: its striking realism; twisted psychology; addictions to perfection, competition, and, yes, substances; and its troupe of trained dancers. Rising above all, however, is the stark contrast between the beauty you see on stage and the ugliness that goes into creating the beauty. While at times overwrought, in testament to its melodramatic nature, those entertaining a life in the creative and performing arts might find it a cautionary tale (as potent as conversations with broken and jaded aspirants). Success goes to the few, and they possess more than talent; sad, but the way of things.

Claire Robbins (Sarah Hay, very strong lead) flees her home in Pittsburgh, from a room in which she has installed a padlock on her door. Slowly, over the course of the series, the abuse she suffered reveals itself. Shes running toward the chance to dance but also escaping pain that subsumes her character. As she says, she's trying to see herself. Dance is one way to escape. The other is to punish herself by variously cutting and pricking her flesh, and eating the glass that someone has put in her toe shoes prior to her big performance. Some will find these scenes hard to watch.

In New York, she auditions as part of a cattle call for the fictional American Ballet Company. She almost instantly strikes a chord with company founder and artistic director Paul Grayson (Ben Daniels, superbly devilish and egocentric), who sees her as just the special dancer he needs to revitalize the company.

Since media exposes us to only the most successful and well compensated performers of the day, we like to think of the others living in near or in poverty as existing in something of an idyll, scruffy and grimy, true, but romantic because its in service of a noble dream. Not so in Flesh and Bone, poor looks like poor. Which brings viewers to Claires company accommodations with assigned fellow dancer Mia (Emily Tyra, sympathetic, competitive, and irritating). Claire, after knocking, walks in on Mia in the throes of sex with a boyfriend. Mia adopts an acerbic attitude that, ultimately, disguises her own sense of inadequacy.

Claire has some quirky ways about her, among them lugging around a suitcase packed with books. These she assembles atop herself when she sleeps, something like amour against what goes bang in the night, or against the door of her old room. Among the collection is the childrens book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Velveteen-Rabbit/dp/0385077254/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Velveteen Rabbit</a>, her most prized possession. The connection here is the rabbits desire to be real, exactly Claires. The Velveteen Rabbit also links her to Romeo (Damon Herriman, quite arresting), a homeless man who lives on the roof of Claires building and who, while ingratiating and endearing, is wildly psychotic, a condition that plays out in a way that frees Claire from a literal monster.

When Paul announces that he is commissioning an entirely new ballet with Sarah as the prima, the knives come out, but none are as long and sharp as those of the current prima, Kiira (Irina Dvorovenko). Nobody likes being toppled, least of all a star, not just for prestige reasons but financial, as well, for, as mentioned above, only a few reap the financial benefits of stardom. Not that Kiira needs the money, as she is in a financially advantageous, though loveless (on her part), marriage. Years of punishing dance have taken its toll on her body; to function she needs the support of painkillers and stimulants. Romeo, who upon first meeting Claire and discovering her a ballerina, asks if she might have any Vicodin or Percocet on her, introducing early the idea that in this world much that is distasteful and destructive, drugs, bulimia, anorexia, and the like, are the norm. And so it is with Kiira.

In the highly competitive studio of the American Ballet Company, one dancer does befriend Claire, Daphne (Raychel Diane Weiner, edgy and likable), a rich girl self-alienated from her father, driven to prove herself. Without money worries and possessed of talent, she can pretty much express her iconoclastic side, up to a point. In her off hours, she works as an exotic dancer. She introduces Claire to this world. It speaks to Claires sensual side and she soon begins performing in the club, run by Sergei (Patrick Page, a nice self-contained performance). As Claire comes to learn, patronizing and adoring Sergei, who has a Russians love of the ballet, is a dark, soft-spoken horror. This side manifests itself chillingly on Sergeis yacht, when Claire observes some very disturbing behavior that goes directly to her personal history.

These characters, as well as others, interact in ways that propel the story forward, that have you bingeing episodes, that culminate in the resolution of some storylines, but that introduce others, leading you to believe that the melodramatics have only begun at the conclusion of episode eight, with a stunning two-shot of Paul and Claire face onto the camera and the dramatic utterance by Claire of No.",1448236800,4,5324,5.2786304604486425

I am quite aware of the fact that the ballet world is extremely competitive and tough, but I'm pretty sure it's not like it is portrayed here. Throwing in useless and crude sex scenes (sex, not love, mind you) does not prevent this potentially good series from going completely downhill. This could have been great, sadly it is a disaster, in my opinion. Producers, please watch Billy Elliot and learn how to create a wonderful film on dancing.",1496275200,,652,4.882882882882883

The reason so many shows overindulge in sex is because they have no plot and no originality. And this show is a good example of that. This show is a bore. And the writing is just juvenile and cliched.

This program is so full of chewed-up tropes it's drinking-game worthy. I've found myself quoting text before it's out of the mouth of the actors' mouths. What should have been a nod to Flashdance is now a worn-out safety blanket, and what should be super-steamy bisexual scenes come off tepid and flat. I'm disappointed in the Breaking Bad writer.

Well, better give up this whole dancing thing."") I could just watch the introduction and be a happy gal. And for those wondering what Brian's tattoo says, it says ""infidel.""

I say ""flee"" because there's abuse and trauma in her past.  There is no one ""likable"" in this series.  The actors do a great job of portraying this and for that, I give the most credit.  There are too many story lines to keep track of (what happened to that young girl on the yacht?) and while I love a good soap opera, I felt that this was not the right format.

The dancers are great, and the acting has its moments (Ben Daniels is pretty compelling) but the plot - such as it is - just seems haphazard. According to what I read online after I finished it the production went way over budget - but there weren't special effects or a huge number of location shots that would account for that, so my guess is that the plot was continuously being rewritten and reshot.",1486166400,,850,4.525974025974026

My problem with this Amazon Original movie is the constant nudity and porn.  Ok. so I am watching the episodes and I fast forward through the sex scenes, but it gets to a point there is so much nudity that it is like watching a glamorous porn film.  I am not against sex or romance but seriously, I would like more story and less nudity and sex. If I can watch a movie with a really good story that is clever, funny, sad and romantic, then that is good entertainment.

7505689,3,B017HP18WO,"""Dark, gritty, complex"" might be a bit understated as a description of this miniseries. If you know what you are in for, you will probably be satisfied with this storyline; if you think you will be watching mostly ballet with a little soap opera thrown in, then you are in for some shocks. Episode 1 got me interested, I almost bailed out after a few more, but decided to watch all the way through the end. I didn't find this show a total waste of time, but it definitely ebbed and flowed in terms of entertainment.

Ballet-movie fans will find all the usual stereotypes here: demanding and nutty company directors and choreographers, aging ballerinas, wannabe corps dancers, straight guy in a gay man's world, jealousy, eating-disorders, drugs, troubled backgrounds. This series takes it up a notch or two by including incest, self-mutilation, violence, sexual assault, mental illness, sex slaves, the Russian Mob, and more. And there is lots and lots of sex and nudity---all varieties, and very graphic. The actors put forth a good effort here, but for the most part these characters are a pretty morose and unlikeable bunch. Production value is good, they definitely spent some money making this show.

And yes, there is dancing. Interesting that they really commissioned a new work for this series, and it is very compelling to watch at the end. But screen time here is heavy on the story away from the stage. It's not a ballet movie with drama, it's a drama with some ballet as background.",1485907200,10,1494,4.83203125

7505756,5,B017HP18WO,"These eight episodes are a piece of art, a ballet.  Included in the cast are Romeo and the ""prophet"" who are not in the dance company per se but are playing their roles in the shadows.  I was a  dancer  so I appreciated the caliber of excellence in the production and dancing.  It was a pretty honest portrayal of the rigors of training.  So for all that, I give five stars.  However, Had the eight episodes been edited to six this would have been a real winner.  What should have been cut in the cutting room were the overplayed cruelties, violence, and perverse sexuality.  As in the Dance, the darkness is expressed often with nuance which still hits the audience emotionally.  So I found a disturbing dichotomy between the world of the dance company and the lives of the characters outside of it.  It didn't work for me.  It was over done.  As an example, the abusiveness  the artistic director's personality didn't have to consume the role.  And perhaps much of the father in Pittsburgh could have been edited.  Yet, there were sublime moments, particularly with the mythological portrayal of Romeo and he provided the most moving response from this viewer.  I admit that I fast forwarded through much of the perversity and violence, so I became my own editor of this series and enjoyed it immensely.",1485561600,,1305,4.6784140969163

So far the story is rather dark and even sometimes depressing but displays the mental, physical, and political sides of dancing.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I would like to see more dancing of the ballet to enforce why these people do what they do. Why they tolerate the politics, the training, the in-fighting and backstabbing of the dance world.  I will continue to watch!",1485475200,,619,4.923076923076923

A more realistic portrayal of what it's like to be in a professional ballet company would probably have provided enough in the way of drama and intrigue to make this an interesting and watchable series.

Ben Daniels is amazing as the zealous, unorthodox, and scheming Paul Grayson....his mood swings from calm to calculating to maniacal are superbly played. The transcendent Claire is like a broken and damaged bird determined to rise again. I'm not sure if I appreciated the incestuous relationship between herself and her brother. One would think that when she got away from the clutches of her brother and embittered father, that she would not return to the scene of the 'crime'. I'm not sure why she let history repeat itself (sleep with her brother)....when she returned home for a visit. No one in this series really experiences any happiness....all characters seem to be broken, hurt or damaged in some way. It's hard to believe the conniving and shenanigans that prevail in the ballet world. However, art supposedly imitates life and we are left to believe that the ballet world is ruled by the calculating and questionable actions of those who wish to rise to stardom even though it means persecuting others and demolishing their dreams. Come to think of it, the theme and tone of Flesh and Bone somewhat echo that of the movie Black Swan.",1484956800,2,1244,4.956937799043062

Yes, there are evil and demented people in this world. But the only relief from that dreary side of life comes in the form of the beautiful performances of the dancers, especially in the ballet, Dakini, created specifically for the series. The acting was good, but it was difficult to find any of the characters remotely likeable. The dancers show no joy in their performances, only desperation. And yet, I wavered between 3 and 4 stars, because I became addicted to it. Unless you've read some spoiler reviews, you will want to watch it to the end.",1484697600,,677,4.794871794871795

And don't even get me started with the actors' performance: as terrible and uncomfortable as being served by a waiter that has the flu.

7505939,1,B017HP18WO,"Absolutely HORRENDOUS. The plot leaves much to be desired and the writing as well as the characters feel like a jacked up version of ""Black Swan"". Even though the writing was quite mediocre,so were the actors and their lack of ability to humanize these characters. Some of the characters were more like CARICATURES of the characters they were playing...such Ben Daniels who played ""Paul Grayson"", the owner of the dance company. The characters were stereotypically drawn from a lot of other films I have endured in the past chronicling ballet,sprinkled in with very little truth. I found most characters and their reaction to tragedy or most reactions to anything to be quite... linear. No one seemed to be truly living through any of the cheap soap opera moments,in which by the end (episode 8),I was incapable of believing anything, and I desperately wanted to finish watching so I could get on with my life. There was a lack of cause and effect in the writing which also translated into the direction and actor choices. There were scenes between some characters that lasted for an extended period of time...if only these moments were substantial in which they were not. This show greedily threw in everything they could find...including the kitchen sink and yet,there were various writers for each episode and yet none of the dialogue is written in reality nor did it possess a causality for any behavior. It's a shame really because they have two fantastic older actors who are well seasoned in the industry Tovah Feldshuh,and the actor who was the strip club owner. Both of them are well known in the theatre/film industry and I feel as though there talent was completely wasted. If there are any remote redeeming qualities,it was quite enjoyable watching any scene where the actors could just stifle themselves and dance. Also,the intro to the show is entertaining. I,hope there ISNT a second season to this show.",1484352000,3,1919,4.944272445820434

I am not a prude, I've been devoted to Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, even True Blood...but this show is a tremendous insult to the beautiful dancers cast  -- artists who have devoted their lives to training in one of the most difficult pursuits in the world only to be exploited this way.

This dark beautiful story goes far beyond the trash that is reality inundated TV. This, what I believe, masterpiece of life in the world of ballet goes from the ""every day"" to the insanely extreme.

Along with all that is the oh so nasty oxymoron world of the strip club that had me at times, leaning into my screen to grab and grasp every detail of their dance...these are by far the most graceful and beautiful dancers that has ever been on a stripper pole, albeit that I have never been in a strip club...but whatever. Then there is Romeo...the anti-hero madman who is actually a surrealistic genius that is strong enough to ""do the right thing"" while never realizing that he is the ""called one"" to do the right thing. Romeo gave the series depth in that he  took us away from the possibly mundane dance world and drags us into the insane reality of NYC's down trodden. And while not the appointed speaker for the whole insane world called New York City, he is what I can remember to be an excellent example form my childhood growing up in New York City that I would see as I lived in my ""little bubble."" The choreography was magnificent...and the ultimate beauty is that ""real"" dancers were cast in their respective roles.
I am truly saddened that this was the only season, however, during the last scene, i found myself asking the question ""where will or could they possibly go from here?"" And the fact that there is only one seasons answers my question and left me with a sense of yearning comfort that would be a ""ROTTEN"" sophomoric second season that dies before it even gets started. That is the price of genius, the world only needs one piece of wonderful pie that we can eat again, and again, and again. WELL DONE!!!",1484265600,7,1983,4.523676880222841

The story line is hard to follow because of all the gratuitus sex (soft porn) that is relentlessly shoved in your face. It seems like every 15 minutes something is paraded across the screen.  The star, Claire, runs away from home due to an incesteous situation.  She walks in on her new roommate engaging in vigerous sex.  The locker room always has nudity - including a dancer grabbing her crotch asking for tampons.  Her brother masterbates while talking to Claire.  The producer likes barely adult boys.  There is pole dancing and lap dances.  Weathly donars expect to sleep with the dancers.

I know I've missed some.  And this was only two episodes.  I wanted to watch a show with a story line, not porn.  I liked the opening credits, though.",1483920000,,821,4.5793103448275865

7506071,2,B017HP18WO,"Very dark. This show had so much potential. The actors were talented. The dancing was beautiful. The story pushed every dark aspect of life that it possibly could. It was depressing and there was no glory, joy, or anything positive fed to the audience. The ending left me rolling my eyes. I was so glad to be finished with this show. Why do they try and push the shock value so much? It's like they think people have become numb to things and they need to push it just a little bit more for the sake of ""art"". I think this pushed too far and asked people to accept and deal with things that you just cannot look past. And Claire, let's talk about Claire's character. They left so many things open and hanging which gave the creators way too much room to jerk everyone around. Claire seemed like a wounded, likable person but in the last few episodes, she initiates the very thing we all thought she was running from. I really found it very hard to look past some of what the creators wanted to feed us. So much of it was disturbing and empty and just FUBAR. This makes me sad because there was potential for a great show. The dancing was beautiful and the promise was always there, it just stayed so dark.",1483920000,,1205,4.312775330396476

7506074,5,B017HP18WO,"I was expecting a drama, and it seemed to start out as such, but as the series progressed it became more and more clear that this show was no ordinary drama. Instead, it was a psychological thriller with plot twists that could never have been anticipated, and built beautifully to the climactic performance in the final episode.

7506084,3,B017HP18WO,"I enjoyed the beginning of this series very much, but it lost me toward the end. Normally, shows like this end up rushed, but I don't feel like that happened here. I feel like they put too many story lines in one short show. Being only roughly 8 hours long (8 episodes, each an hour or so), there really wasn't enough time to fully flesh out these rich and complex characters that were presented before us. Overall, this was pretty well written, but I just don't think the writers considered all that was going on. The end left something missing, some pieces of the story were left out. There was just a little too much left to the imagination in my opinion. What exactly was the relationship between Claire and her brother?
The show started out unique and strange giving me a lot of hope, but the end was just so lack luster that I don't think it was as good as it could have been. There was just so much potential that was wasted. If this were a book, I'm sure it would have come across much clearer and much better.",1483747200,,1018,4.307291666666667

7506113,4,B017HP18WO,"The dilemma--a beautifully produced story with fine acting, marred by (I think) a continuing gruesome and unrealistic plot detail; namely, the lead ballerina, Claire, suffers the loss of a toenail and then proceeds to self-abuse by hitting it on purpose (and more). It goes on like that--and, she somehow magically manages to dance like a dream with this horrifically mangled, bleeding raw big toe. Is this possible? Maybe; however, it just seems so unnecessary, and am leaving out a detail in the last episode that is sickening regarding the same injury. It is otherwise dark and gritty as advertised, yet within acceptable, more believable boundaries. Her dancing! Fantastic!

The dancing is beautiful. The intertwined story lines keep you on the edge of your seat. But if you want to feel happy at the end of an episode or the season, well this is not Cinderella. The problems of the characters are very real, but just like in most TV, they are a more concentrated version of what you find in real life. Very concentrated version. This show tackles or alludes to a lot of very difficult or even taboo subjects - incest, drug abuse, homosexuality, strip clubs, sex slaves, etc. I binged watched this in two days and I could not pry myself away. This show is not fast paced, but it is intense. It draws you and from the first episode I wanted to know more. I wanted to know the back story of the characters and what had created Clair.

All these clichs wrapped up in one character is indeed nauseating. I don't believe there isn't a single decent person in ballet, which is what this show suggests. It widens that mostly imagined gap between urban ""insiders"" represented as completely depraved and the rest of the world. A great dancer must have humanity, but the writer/s here don't think that's cool.

Please don't take my word for it, (as if you would), but watch this series!

The actresses and actors are real ballet dancers - something that even Natalie Portman could not successfully fake and that is terrific. The toil in class/rehearsal and the competition between the dancers rings true but... dancers are not all whores. Dancers are not all mentally ill. Dancers do what they do often times because they love to dance and ballet is so beautiful.
Beware!! This series is disturbing and you might take your young daughter or son out of class after watching this but if you do then you are ignoring the fact that the study of ballet helps almost everything... Just remember not to go over the edge.",1483401600,,804,4.629370629370629

7506150,4,B017HP18WO,"I enjoyed the dancing, and I do hope this series returns.  The incest subplot? Um, no. And I doubt very much one might become a great dancer given Clair's family situation. (It takes alot of training, money and family support  to make it in ballet) Also, as far as the dancing is concerned, ""Clair"" is the weakest link and it is difficult to believe she would be elevated and /or celebrated as a soloist. Still, if there is a second season, I would watch, and I do love that they used real dancers in the show-I found myself watching them more than I watched 'Clair'.",1483401600,,567,4.390476190476191

Alik Sakharov was great in her roll, the acting was not there for me the dancing, but not the plot. The theme music I loved.

For me- the sister/brother storyline blew it. After all the backstory & set up & drama- they blew it. And now I can't un-see it. By the last 2 episodes- I didn't care about any of the characters. And up until that point- I was completly invested. The writers ruined it. It could have been a thing of ugly beauty- instead it became trashy fodder.

Unfortunately, the main plot was just too bizarre and many of the character's actions seemed motivated by the writer's need for drama, shock value, or exploitation of the main actress's body. It's a shame they had to resort to that. This could have been much more interesting show. Most of the characters were excessively unlikeable or just plain strange. It's often painful to watch, especially the last episode, which is gory and doesn't feel at all like justice. The actors/dancers were very talented though.",1482883200,,671,5.109090909090909

I love the beauty and athleticism of seeing dancers dance, and at first I thought this series might have promise.

7506273,4,B017HP18WO,"As a former dancer and mother of a dancer, I found this series to be informative and interesting. It is a dark representation of the struggle in the ballet world as dancer's and other artists try to navigate the system and the other personalities they encounter. I found some of the characters (especially the company owner) to be a little too stereotypical and a bit far fetched. I also did not understand the relationship between brother and sister. Were they truly brother and sister or half or did they even have the same parents? Since we never found out anything about the mother, other than she left them, it's hard to tell, but if they were truly brother and sister....wow!!! Even if they were very close, having a child together is just again....far fetched and a little too dark. I did watch the entire first season and really wished there could have been more.",1482883200,,871,4.662337662337662
7506274,4,B017HP18WO,"This was very difficult to review because some aspects were superb while others aspects were over-the-top crazy or fell into cheap stereotypes.  First, the dancing --  performances, reheasals and classes-- is superb. As is most of the acting, which is wonderful given that the actors are actually dancers.  In fact the acting was so much better than the actual actors delivered in Black Swan (where they claimed they needed ""real"" actors, haha...Black Swan had a cliched storyline, very bad acting and painfully laughable dance sequences despite the professional dancers used as body doubles).  Ironically, the weakest spot of the series were the storylines and characterization of the over-the-top manic-depressive company director Paul Grayson.  Wouldn't a more subtle manipulator with just occasional outbursts have been sufficient and more believable?  Not sure if this was the fault of the writers/director/or actor, but this is where the storyline fell into silly cliches.  OTOH the dancers-turned-screen actors were fantastic.  I think they would do well in any acting situation, not just in dancer roles.
I am sorry there is not a Seaon 2 because this was compulsively watchable, especially for the dancing.  However the finale was superb and beautiful in every way, so despite a few loose ends the major story lines were resolved so well that I'm not sure that there was anywhere to go with Season 2.  Episode 8 really had to be ""The End"".

7506353,5,B017HP18WO,"This is a fabulous show. Absolutely unflinching in its portrayal of the cut throat world of ballet. The acting is superb - every single character is well-developed and believable, each bringing their own unique talent to the person they portray.

And the dancing! Oh it's spectacular! I love ballet but I am not an aficionado - and the beauty and grace of the performances are breathtaking. Even the opening titles are so awesome that I dare anyone to skip over them. Obsession is the theme throughout.

I imagine the reason why this drama wasn't picked up again (don't worry - there are no real loose ends, just breadcrumbs in case they came back) is because of the family subject matter of the main character. But that is a relatively small aspect of it, but it can be disturbing to a lot people (it was to me but I kept going because this drama is so phenomenal).

Another aspect that I like is that it didn't resort to melodrama. The ""big reveal"" is done so matter-of-factly that I actually had to rewind to feel the impact.

Please give this a try. I promise you won't regret it. If nothing else, there are a lot of beautiful, naked, young bodies to be seen! :)",1482364800,4,1166,4.485849056603773

One of the aspects I appreciated was how one was drawn onto many of the scenes simply through the camera, that is to say there was much of the story in the details of what the viewer is seeing. Much of the story was also revealed in many short conversations or at times one simple question. I am thinking particularly of Claire and Bryan's relationship and individual history.

I thought it was very good.  It's deals with real world issues, though many would try to deny any of this happens in the real world. I think the characters are believable and found I had invested more in the characters than I thought I would.  All these critical reviews are puzzling and I think taken to extreme, people saying this kind of thing doesn't happen, others saying yes it does. It's dark, but to say that nobody could be that talented if they had gone through the things ""Claire"" went through is absolutely the stupidest thing I've ever read, and an affront to all the successful people that have experienced the darkest of so-called humanity.

7506389,2,B017HP18WO,"Starz!, or rather STARZ, appears doomed to remain the red-headed stepchild to its mightier siblings HBO and Showtime. This eight parter, which aired a year ago and now streams on Amazon Prime, is unlikely to change this cruel fate. As long as it sticks to the world of ballet (the cattiness, the backbiting and backstabbing, the addictions and privations that sustain the incredible effort, the financial co-dependencies and their attendant corruptions, the glamour too, for those who seek it there, etc) Flesh And Bone is a good to very good show, at times fascinating, specially in the early episodes when more screen time is devoted to the dancers, this despite the fact that the busty, somewhat stiff Sarah Hay seems more realistically suited to the pole than the dance floor.

It starts to drag unfortunately around mid-season when the string of daft subplots kick in. These go from the irrelevant (the company manager's marital and mothering issues. Who cares?) through the gratuitous (the whole Russian lap dance angle, likely the why in why Sarah Hay, presumably thrown in as a sop to those who find ballet rather lacking in, er, flesh.) and the undercooked (the new prima's depressing, unbalancing backstory of incest and abuse in blue-collar Pittsburg that does little to answer the more interesting question of why Claire would surrender sun and proper nourishment to the ballet in the first place) to the frankly preposterous (the deranged, be-scarfed, conveniently hipsterish tramp chock full of portentous Wagnerian nuts who, get this, resides rent free on the roof of a walkup in New York circa 2015). All these feel tacked on and make the show a tedious tread. One season is plenty; there won't be a second thankfully.",1482105600,4,1734,5.041811846689895

7506417,3,B017HP18WO,"This show pushes the limits even for cable tv. It seems obsessed not so much with ballet's dark side, but with its own darker obsessions. In the first 3 episodes, they managed to cover alcoholic father issues, child abuse, seeming descent into suggested pedophilia, incest, then escape to a NYC ballet world of mental illness with Fisher King references, company competition, self-harming, eating disorders, more sexual abuse, drugs, strip clubs and even human trafficking. In between all this, there's a much shorter story about being a young dancer trying to make it in a competitive environment and what life is like for a small ballet company trying to hold it's own. Very glossy and there is actually dancing, but definitely not G-rated. And while all ballet companies look more romantic from the outside than the inside, and all these issues exist independently, it would be pretty bad luck to encounter them all in one girl's life.",1481846400,6,938,5.019230769230769

Hard work and discipline nurtures talent. What is beautiful comes out of Beauty, love, out of Love.

We found this series excruciating to watch and couldn't wait for it to be over.  I took years and years of ballet classes and read about every book on the subject, so the subject matter appealed.  My husband actually bought the Black Swan DVD, so we thought this couldn't miss.  When it was (blessedly) over, we threw it in the trash because we couldn't think of anyone we might want to subject it to.",1470268800,,546,4.42
7506563,2,B017HP18WO,"As someone who loves dance and knows something of that world, I was entirely disappointed. I kept thinking that one of the inspirations for this show must have been Pat Conroy's Prince of Tides (a book I did not like) and Ayn Rand's Fountainhead (a book I loved). As in Prince of Tides, many of the characters are too messed up, with too many issues in a way that made them cartoon-like and hard, if not impossible, to relate to. I was particularly annoyed with the character of Paul Grayson. I have known a narcissistic artistic director or two in my time but cruelty like his would not be tolerated even by the neediest of dancers. There is no point in working with someone attempting to kill all that is best about the art.

On the upside, in the less crazy moments, the acting was good. The production values are first rate and the dance... When you actually get there, it's terrific. I would watch Sascha Radetsky dance any day and both his parts in Rubies and in Dakini (20 minutes!) were a great reward for suffering through the hours of over stuffed plotting, lack of character arc, and host of mustache-twirling cliched villains passing for those characters that somehow, we were supposed to care about enough to keep watching.

I am not surprised this only got one season; it needs a serious re-work in both scope and taste. This is not a world I would want to be even remotely a part of.",1470268800,4,1398,4.5

7506600,1,B017HP18WO,"It's just crude. This series is crudely conceived, crudely written and tragically wastes some excellent talent. The creators seem to have set out to make a gritty and visceral series about human frailties and exquisite art and all they have done is string together a necklace of unbalanced beads that neither adorn nor dazzle.
Sadly, it's a dream cast of people who manage to shine even when trudging through monotonous, melodramatic slime. The actors occasionally overcome the material and good for them when they do. Bless them for it.
It would be great if the people who create these kinds of shows would realize that the majority of people who turn on the TV want to like characters and enjoy the stories, not hate them. The servants on Downton Abbey were as mundane as characters come but people all over the world loved them. I could not love the people on Flesh and Bone. And it isn't about ballet dancers being terrible humans. I've known ballet dancers, both active and retired, and choreographers, and they are just people with lives and hopes and they could easily be the kind of characters we look forward to seeing every week.
As for the writers, their attempts to be dramatic were just trite. I made it to episode 3 before they tossed in the bit about killing innocent baby birds (that isn't a metaphor, they did it). I suppose it was meant to be shocking and it wasn't. I knew what would happen as soon as I saw the ballet dancers innocently admiring the nest on the ledge.
If you want to watch beautiful people make you hate your own species, this is the series to watch. Keep a barf bag handy, though.",1467417600,8,1618,4.582758620689655
7506601,5,B017HP18WO,"As another reviewer mentioned, this is a wonderfully written and executed show. I too am confused as to why it won't be returning for another season. It's a compelling and dark story of a young woman looking to find her true self and become ""real"" after an abusive past. The protagonist is a prodigal dancer who comes out of nowhere at an open casting call for a ballet company. She both chooses and is subjected to experiences in a short time that subsequently shape her eventual confidence and belief in herself as a ""real"", beautiful and powerful dancer. As her dance director proclaims the dancer's goal is to transcend, the protagonist (Claire) truly does by the end of the season, during her debut professional performance.",1467158400,,729,4.84

Personally I enjoyed looking at Claire's deep emotional pain and what she has gone through to find herself. I found parts of myself in her character. I was mainly disappointed that there are only 8 episodes and no plans to make a season 2. They tried to make the whole series sum up by the last episode, but I found myself wanting the stories and characters to be told more in depth. The relationship between Bryan and Claire is difficult to understand, it is implied that it was abusive but also consensual. I felt that the ending was a bit of an easy way out for the writers, without getting into too much detail here. I would have really liked it they had made it into a complete series and got more in depth about Claire and Bryan's childhood, what happened between them, etc and also the storyline about Sergei did not really explain what happened with him.

Dancers tape their toes like football players and wrap and protect their feet before putting on toe shoes.
  Then we have the ubiquitous scenes where nude ballerinas just show up and walk through the scene. We have Claire going to a sleazy dance club and stripping and a very nasty rape scene. It's all gratuitous porn. Skip it.",1466467200,2,568,4.549019607843137

The power, the passion, the dark  beauty of the actors/acting and best of all, dancing - WOW! It had its sophomoric moments, a bit over-the-top, operatic, ballet-mania. So what? It's a thrilling production. The final dance of ""nude"" female/male form/love entwining brought tears to my eyes. What I especially like (besides the gripping
back-stories of incest, aging prima ballerinas and brittle, bitter has-beens in charge of wide-eyed newbies) was that it introduced me to the awe-
inspiring beauty of ballet. Bring it back, post haste, s'il vous plait. From the cheers here I can see that I am not the only devoted, backstage fan.",1464393600,2,720,5.153846153846154

7506646,4,B017HP18WO,"A tough one to call in some respects, this is indeed a fascinating look at the world of high level professional ballet.  The downside is that the story given is one of the darkest dramas I have ever seen.  There is a crying need for comic relief or levity somewhere in the series, for otherwise it becomes at times hard to keep watching.  Sarah Hay's performance is superb both with acting and dance, and she leaves us eager to see her in more roles.  The other principal members of the cast turn in fine performances, but the sad part is that they all are portraying characters with serious flaws, some downright evil; yet given their histories, understandably so.  The world of professional ballet can be insular, demanding, , intensely competitive, and may attract unusual personalities, but what a contrast the example given here is to the picture given in the Breaking Pointe series which goes behind the scenes at Ballet West, a thriving and well-reputed major company.  The Dakini ballet and the excerpt from Balanchine's Rubies are a welcome offset to the otherwise somber aspects of the dramatic action.  While the strip-club dances may be well executed for what they are,  the mood projected is as much sad and degrading to the dancers as it is erotic, but perhaps that is the intent.  This series succeeds on all fronts as an intense and disturbing story, but in some respects maybe too much.  In any case once begun, it is impossible not to follow it through to the end.",1464393600,3,1482,4.709302325581396

7506668,1,B017HP18WO,"If you are expecting Flesh and Bone to be the Mozart of the Jungle of the ballet world you will be sorely disappointed. Whereas MITJ is joyous, original and hugely clever, Flesh and Bone is so second-rate it actually hurts to watch it, and you will be very sorry for every minute of your life that you spent on it, hoping that it would get better. IT DOESN'T.

What a missed opportunity! Flesh and Bone depicts a nihilistic world where everyone is either utterly craven and vile to the core, or possesses some redeeming qualities but is forced to live a life of complete vileness and degradation. To wit, the director of ballet is a sadist, the female dancers would knife each other almost to a woman, and Claire, the main character, can't decide whether she wants to be a ballet dancer or a prostitute, has incest with her psychopathic brother and has been abused by her appalling father. The characters are one-dimensional and motivated only by vileness. No one develops, and there is no real story arc.

It's not even dark and original, it's just bleak and very, very mediocre. I think F and B thinks it's trying to say something profound about the artistic life, but the message the viewer receives is just don't ever become a ballet dancer, or you'll end up as some soulless, drug-addicted, screwed-up mess, selling your body, and given a wide berth by all psychologically normal people. It's hard to believe this series comes from the same company that commissioned Mozart in the Jungle and other great series.

7506685,5,B017HP18WO,"After seeing BLACK SWAN a few years ago, I didn't think that a movie about the world of ballet could get much darker.

I was wrong.  FLESH AND BONE , an eight-episode/one hour television mini-series from Starz makes BLACK SWAN look like BAMBI in comparison.

FLESH AND BONE  is a gritty, complex excellent drama that touches on white slavery, the Russian Mob, murder and even incest.  There is also plenty of sex; male and female nudity, so people who are easily offended should stay away.

With the exception of Tovah Feldshuh, whose role as one of the dance instructors is, unfortunately, minor, and Damon Herriman (JUSTIFIED), none of the cast was known to me.  However, since all of the characters playing dancers appear to do their own dancing, I can only assume that they are, primarily dancers, who have now added acting to their resumes.

Thats not a negative .  These players are terrific talents who, hopefully, will now have long careers as both dancers and dramatic actors.

The story centers around Claire (Sarah Hay), a young dancer with a troubled past, who runs away from her Pittsburgh home to try her luck in New York as a dancer.  She is accepted by a prestigious company, run by a cruel, ruthless manager (Ben Daniels), and almost immediately is assigned the lead in a new ballet.  This,earns her the resentment of her fellow dancers, including her roommate (Emily Tyra), who have been with the company much longer, as well as the prima donna (Irina Dvorovenko).

Created by Moira Walley-Beckett,  FLESH AND BONE provides a totally engrossing eight hours, and for those of you who are not fans of ballet, the dance sequences are minimal.  Indeed, this is a powerful drama and none of the characters are really very likable.

The two-disc DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains a Behind the Scenes featurette.

Each character was unique and had a story all their own. From the ""sick"" brother who had a recognizable haunting face (like the bald guy from ""Lost Highway"") to the crazy ballet director.

It's a travesty that Sarah Hay retired to Germany to dance only now. Some agent from William Morris or CAA needs to convince her to re-dedicate herself to acting. Way too talented to give up the acting craft and rob the film industry - -from gracing us again with her unique body language and dramatic way of delivering her lines. Best cryer for an actress I've seen. Her pain was easily conveyed to us - the viewers.  Rest of the supporting cast was great too- props to the business manager character who stole $ from the donation pool to finance her kids' education. She is very talented, fiery, and real.  Music was great too- however, not dark enough at times. I suggest choosing Sofia Gubaidulina or Webern to heighten the film's dramaticism.

I'm so sorry the show won't have a second season, or so I read in someone's review. But maybe it's because this one reached heights always hoped for, rarely attained. I guess in a second season it would be hard to equal--or top--the first. Maybe it's a question of that old adage: ""Quit while you're ahead.""

One star, only for the unfortunately gifted real life dancers who had to throw so much away of their life training to be cast in this silly and really icky project...the real life actors are forced to overact in caricature (and by now horribly unoriginal and cliched) roles with the most godawful lines...sorry I was not a huge fan of Showgirls or Black Swan either, so I could not get past the first two episodes.  In taking itself so seriously and attempting to be so high-brow about being low-brow, it got tiresome pretty quickly and I regret trying to save a couple dollars by purchasing the entire season.  The people who are going to sit through every minute of this series will most likely not be the same crowd that will fully appreciate the elite level of dancing on display anyway, so dance fans out there be prepared to have your finger ready on the fast forward button to blow past much of the storyline.

Character development was lacking and it didn't make you feel anything deep for any of the people in the movie. Despite certain ""tragedies"" in the episodes, there was not enough development to make you care. I was disappointed with it. It could have been much better, and the incest part was just stupid.

The first reviewer thought it was pornograpic, so I immediately dismissed that review, only one of the one star reviewers actually seemed to understand the series and just didn't like it. I can respect that, however I believe that network television has been working hard to dumb down their audiences, that's why when something as so humanly wrong as Flesh and Bone was we are frightened by the darkness.  We live in a dark world, real life isn't Modern Family....we just don't want to face it.  I also binge watched Flesh and Bone, in fact, I added Starz to my Direct TV the day Flesh and Bone aired because the movie Center Stage is my meditation happy place.  I still have all 8 episodes on my DVR.  An Emmy Nod should go to the diabolical Ben Daniels.....full frontal and all.  After I binged watched all 8 episodes in one day I coerced my hubby to just give this show 20 minutes.  My husband's moral compass never waivers it's always pointing true north.  I rewatched the show with and just before the Thanksgiving episode aired I got a bit queasy knowing what was going to revealed and thought I might lost him.  When my husband walks away from something it is dead to him, so, I hit pause and broke the story to him.  All he said was ""let me see it"" what offended him more was it verified what we always knew, but she was the aggressor in the scene and shoving the bracelet down her father's throat was ovation worthy.  HULU, AMAZON FIRE TV, NETFLIX are going to change the price we're paying for cable television.  I will predict that they are reduced to mechanics of streaming.  During the stupid network ""winter"" finales we're forced the endure....some coming back late as March 6 because Starz and Showtime came as a deal and we binged watched one season of homeland and seasons 1&2 of The affaire.  55 minutes, no commercial interruption and solidly great television.  Because the times if hitler always fascinated me I was excited to watch The Man IN TheHigh Castle....something about seeing a swastika lit up like it was Christmas Day.  My soon to be d-I-l is Jewish and after she watched it she said the most irritating thing for her was that work related to personal phone call instead of goodbye, it was hell hitler.

Yes, the dance scenes are good, and I'm sure quite accurate. That said, it tries overly hard to be something it simply isn't: a well thought out drama that invigorates the senses. It introduces aspects but never follows through on anything, fighting itself on every level. It took on too many segues, leaving everything stunted. I'm not an individual who needs to have things explained by any stretch, but when it becomes so complicated and each segue is left unfinished, unexplored to its limits, and/or simply bizarre, it becomes pretentious and an example of ""just because you can, doesn't mean you should.""

I would love to hear how they went about finding the cast, most of whom have little or no acting credits.  This is apparent in some scenes but the direction and production value makes up for it.

I don't understand the comparisons between this and black swan.  They both involve ballet but so what.  Two completely different stories and as for ballet, neither natalie portman or milas kunis can dance.  Anyway, black swan was as much about ballet as 'alien' is a syfy story.  It's amazing how some peoples kids miss everything.

The story is disturbing and choppy at times but the production value and craftsmanship by everyone shines thru.  I read somewhere that starz actually canceled this because of the production costs not because of the product.  If they had released this on netflix, it definitely would have found a wider audience and another season if all were willing.  Too bad but then I hate when a good show goes downhill at the end so maybe it's best they killed it.
