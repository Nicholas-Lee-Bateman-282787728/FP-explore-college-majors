8362676,5,B002BZZBBK,"This a great WWII DVD, lots of footage I haven't seen before. 4 DVDs 8 Hrs! Awesome!",1274486400,3,84,4.0
8362677,5,B002BZZBBK,"This is an excellent dvd set about the D-day landings. There are 4 discs, each one lasting just over 2 hours. The first one does a fine job at explaining the overall situation of the war just before the beginning of Operation Overlord. The second one covers the landings themselves, while the third follows the progress of the invasion during the first few weeks following D-day. The fourth dvd is about the training of the airborne forces which took part in the invasion. Its only drawback is the repetition of some material already seen in the preceding discs. The latter part of this disc focuses on operation Market Garden (the failed crossing of the Rhine by airborne forces in Holland). The set also contains extras: Hitler's ""wonder weapons"" and a brief tour of the D-day Museum in New Orleans.

The set features numerous interviews of combat veterans (Mr. Malarkey, of ""Band of Brothers"" fame, if memory serves, appears here). These will allow you to further appreciate the tremendous contribution that these true heroes made. Also, several expert historians provide valuable insight into the operations. Picture and sound quality of archival footage is good, while the quality of contemporary footage is excellent.
