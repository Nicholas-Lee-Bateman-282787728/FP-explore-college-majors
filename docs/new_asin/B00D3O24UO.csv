8589094,5,B00D3O24UO,"Well conducted, with good picture and sound. Never a big fan of Rene Kollo, but he's surprisingly good as Tristan. Hanna Schwarz is always dependably good. Yes, Gwyneth Jones is too old for the role ( if only she had done it 10 yrs. earlier ), and her Liebestod is not great, but what a wonderful singing actress she is. And she is fully committed to the part, never shirking away from anything. An altogether satisfying performance.",1509062400,,433,4.636363636363637
8589095,2,B00D3O24UO,"Only OK.  There was no magic, in my humble opinion.  Think I'll just stick to my MP3's.",1500163200,,87,4.0588235294117645
8589096,5,B00D3O24UO,"As someone who is new to opera, I thoroughly enjoyed this and found it very moving. The performances were impactful and conveyed deep emotion. All acts were very good, but I found some highlights in the second and final act. Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys Tristan und Isolde!",1420761600,,288,4.8979591836734695

In 1947 I bought my first Opera recording - a pound plus - of LP's by obscure artists from Leipsig doing Tristan und Isolde . The mony I had earned as a caddy at the local Golf course and it was hard earned but to the 14 y/o boy there was magic in this music and there still is. Over the years I have heard many artists of varying ability in a variety of productions - some good and some indifferent. Have I ever witnessed a perfect Tristan? Yes , perhaps;  in November 1958  at Lyric Opera Chicago with Arthur Rodzinski conducting, Birgit Nilsson began the Liebstodt sometime after Midnight (it began at 7:30p.m.) but none of the 3,000 + and myself in the audience complained. This was magic. The tenor was Windgasen, I believe.
Since then I have listened to and seen more than a dozen live performances and dozens of recordings . Some good as the 1974 l'Orange  with Nilsson and Vickers but the recording sound is horrible and the 1983 Bayreuth production under Ponelle with Kollo and J. Meire. She is pretty but not vocally an Isolde. That is the problem!  I've heard a lot of good sopranos, great in other roles, but not up to Isolde. That is why I love this disc. I've heard Kollo live at least  three times in the 80's as Tristan. He was the epitome of the masculine, besotted lover of grand voice. Yes, by 1993 the year of this recording of this disc he was past prime but could still carry it well as he proves in the third act delirium before death when he rips off his bandages and dies in her arms. (drama!),
Isolde is a different  matter!  I've heard the beautiful recordings of Flagstat and seen Nilsson three times and been awed by them.
Eaglen, W. Meier, M. Price, and J. Meier just don't come near. Then there is Gwyneth Jones. I've heard her live in London, New York and Chicago. Sometimes she is magnificent and sometimes not. I've heard a performance so bad I swore I'd never go to see her again. Fortunately I did go to see her in mid-eighties in Chicago and she was brilliant. This disc is 1993; both stars are past vocal and bodily prime. The shine is off the voices but the basic voice is there -- and -- much of the magic. This is the only disc available that captures Ms Jones 's Isolde and she is formidable.  Yes they are past prime but with the mist of Cornwall  and Kareol in my eyes, I'm still thrilled by their Liebstodt scene. I love this disc.
Robert Lloyd was my favorite Bass of that time. He made an unforgettable Boris which I saw several times and have in recording; better than  any Russian of that era (?).  Here he makes King Mark's monologue interesting. He also looks ""kingly"".
Hanna Schwarz  has sung this role on several recordings over the years and does it well, but here she does not soar at the last part of ""Einsam wachend...."" some of the most beautiful music of the opera. The best Brangane in memory was Grace Hoffman who could soar at "" Habet acht"". That was a ""wow!"".
Do I feel strongly about other Wagner?  No, not for  Parsifal, Meistersinger, Tannhauser but for Lohengrin and the Ring,- somewhat.
For the fourteen year old in me yet, the magic of Tristan is still there.
I strongly recommend this disc.",1391904000,18,3203,4.37037037037037
8589098,1,B00D3O24UO,"The two singers are no longer up to the role. Frankly she should retire and he should watch his earlier performance. This piece of music is too important to treat in such a cavalier, provincial fashion.",1382918400,7,202,4.638888888888889
8589099,5,B00D3O24UO,"I have just received this bluray and compared to the Bayreuther Festspiele with Barenbiom and Johanna Meir in DVD,I found that the the image on the bluray is much better ( obviously ). Also the sound is fuller. Comparing Gwyneth Jones as Isolde on bluray with Johanna Meier,I found that Gwyneth Jones has  a stronger  and more melodic voice. . My only caveat is that she looks too old for the role. But you can Always turn off the vdeo.",1376438400,10,436,4.4375
