The crazy storyline, and superb acting in this movie make it just a smash.  I have personally seen  it over 10 times.  I have been reciting from it for about 3 years now.  This movie is worth every penny I have spent on it.  Every moment of this  movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  You'll be saying  ""What's Brodie gonna say next?"" and ""Will Silent Bob ever  talk?"" or ""Will that guy ever see the hidden picture?"".
I  HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE.  IT'S FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY! Over age 14,  that is.

743020,4,6303964745,"Everything you love about Kevin Smith comedies is on full display in ""Mallrats"", Smith's second outing as a director.

Although not as well known as some of Smith's other titles, ""Mallrats"" remains one of my favorites, featuring all the Star Wars and comic book references, the locker room humor, and quick witted writing that were Kevin Smith hallmarks, this movie also features a very young Ben Affleck, as well as Shannen Doherty (fresh off of her 90210 days), Jeremy London, Jason Lee (pre ""My Name is Earl""), along with Smith and long time friend Jason Mewes hitting full stride as their signature characters Jay and Silent Bob.

If you like Kevin Smith movies, you'll love ""Mallrats!""

743515,5,6303964745,"To this day I cannot see why this film did so badly and how people can sit there and blast it. As most people agree, the dialogue plays a decent part on why Smith films are so fantastic and fun, and this was the first thing that grabbed my attention. As mentioned, when I stumbled across Mallrats on Cable, it was almost the end of the film at the Game Show segment. To have a chick insinuating having sex as a question, and having Brodie (God bless Jason Lee!) scream out ""Oh, you mean like...!"", I was hooked. Thankfully, as cable is infamous for doing, Mallrats got multiple re-runs and the next day I caught the flick in full. Onto the DVD Itself, any DVD of a great film such as Mallrats deserves purchasing. I mean, there is no other way, bar stealing a film reel yourself, to get the fantastic picture quality and sound, and more importantly, which you can't get too many places, BONUS FEATURES! And for this DVD to be advertised as having ""Over 1 hour of Deleted Scenes"", it makes any fan salivate from the mouth. Whilst I know many film purists who state ""Deleted Scenes are deleted for a reason"" (!), any true fan of a film wants to see scenes that the director intended to include but was prevented from doing so due to film politics, irritating production companies or simply time management.
The real gem on this disc however has to be the Audio Commentary. By the way, this was the first Audio Commentary I ever viewed with ""Video Hijinks""; IE: when the mallrats logo appears, press the select button on your remote to change the screen to a 'live' shot of the guys in the Audio Commentary booth interacting with each other. It was great to see all the guys together. Smith, Mewes, good ol' Ben Affleck (Who by the time I saw Mallrats had become 'all that and a bag of potato chips' through his post-Mallrats flicks), as well as ""Chasing Amy's Jason Lee"" (A referral poor old J.L. will probably take to the grave) all work great together, feeding of what each other says to make a very intertaining and worthwhile DVD. In fact, People I know that HATE Mallrats (I can't see how the could) have bought the DVD primarily for the Commentaries and Extra Features. One mate I know only liked Clerks and Chasing Amy, but owns every Kevin Smith DVD on the market! Another Gem has to be the ""Easter Egg"" on the Mallrats DVD. For those DVD-Illiterate people out there, an Easter Egg is a 'hidden bonus' but in most cases, these aren't hidden very well. To access it, move your cursor onto the Robot's Eyes at the Mallrats Menu and press select (It is either the Main Menu or the Bonus Features Menu). Rather humerous little addition by Kevin Smith.",1465776000,,2653,4.472164948453608

745146,4,6303964745,"I'm giving it a four but with the caveat that for viewer had no special fondness or familiarity with the time period or Kevin Smith this would probably rate a three. I had a chance to watch it recently with my teenage daughter and it was interesting to see how it held up by watching it next to someone who could look at it with a fresh set of eyes and no nostalgia.

Let's get the bad out of the way. It's probably one of the weakest of Kevin Smith's View Askew films. The pacing is a little uneven and drags occasionally.  The line delivery sometimes feels like it was directed with a theater stage or tv set in mind verses a film (which is to say what works fine for one doesn't necessarily work for the other) and can be a bit too didactic in tone at times although I can't tell how much of that is attributable to the acting verses the direction or script. There's a part of me that wonders if with a leaner edit that all of this might flow more smoothly. To be fair I'm pretty sure Smith was still getting his head wrapped around what's involved with a bigger production at this point and it takes time and practice to grow and this film laid the groundwork that would coming together in later great films like Chasing Amy.

The content and gags can feel a tad dated at this point (understandable up to a point). The script itself is a bit juvenile but it knows and revels in that quality so you can't hold that too much against it.  At the end of the day it's actually a very simple story that doesn't make a profound point about relationships.

However, it's still a fun film and it has some good qualities that might not be as apparent or are easily taken for granted nearly 20 years later. The cast is decent with some actors who've had interesting careers since then. It caught me off-guard when I realized that Michael Rooker was the controlling dad; he actually does a great job making a relatively small role that could have been one-dimensional pop out on screen. It succeeds at being humorous and entertaining in a unpretentious manner. It's hard to see today but in a pre-ubiquitous Internet everything-goes age, despite years of other films reveling in teenage hormone-driven antics, it was still kind of daring to be so frank about sex and drugs in such a fun and unrepentant way on the big screen.

Watching it with my daughter also reminded me that the characters embody familiar feelings and concerns of teenagers and young adults. Malls are dying out in America so that's kind of dated but the desires and hopes of young people are still the same and that's
why this film still works. I know she has friends or associates at school who are less exaggerated versions of all of these characters and that's a credit to the director and cast that this quality comes across.

It was also interesting to see Stan Lee as the sage voice of experience back then because outside of comic books he wasn't a well known personality then and to hear him use Marvel characters and stories to make a relevant point was neat. For comic book readers of the time it felt kind of validating. My daughter recognized him from the recent Marvel films and that was kind of cool.

It's probably a three star film for the average viewer and pales compared to some of other Smith's other films like Chasing Amy, Dogma, or Clerks IMO but it has a heart and for people who have a connection to aspects of the film it's pretty easy to bump it up to a four. My daughter definitely enjoyed it so it wins in that respect for me. Unless you're easily offended by crude humor it's a fun time. I'm sure I'll watch it again sometime in the future.",1410739200,,3633,4.395833333333333

745149,3,6303964745,"I used to really enjoy Mallrats.  Jason Lee's character, in particular, was hilarious and proved to be a good breakout role for him.  Unfortunately, the fact that the movie had to be re-written due to the absurd original opening, the story really does not flow well.  The other lead characters (Claire Forlani and Jeremy, not Jason, London) really bring down the acting in this movie.  That being said you get good performances from Shannen Doherty, Joey Lauren Adams and a very young Ben Affleck.  Plus, you get a Stan Lee Cameo before it was commonplace.  Ultimately, watching this movie is like riding in the back of a Volkswagen.  Fine when you're young but gets increasingly uncomfortable as you get older.

I will say the picture and sound quality on the Blu Ray do make it a worthy upgrade for Kevin Smith fans.",1409616000,,818,4.711267605633803

I've heard on Wikipedia that this movie got bad reviews at the time of its release. I honestly think this is a very funny romantic comedy. I barely see any plot holes or flaws in the film.

Jason Lee is awesome as Brodie. Brodie is a comic book geek who really shines during Truth or Date where e makes fun of Gill.

TS is kind of the weak point, but he is the straight man to Brodie which does allow Brodie to be even funnier.

Jay and Silent Bob are still funny as everyone's favorite drug dealers, trying to sabotage the game show and help Brodie and TS get their girlfriends back.

I can watch this movie over and over and still enjoy it.",1406937600,2,673,4.1461538461538465

The audio mix is all over the place. Normal speaking is slightly quiet, so I have to volume up normal than usual. Then, Willam is at the magic eye ""YOU KNOW WHAT?!?"" There is also no way to turn the volume down quick enough!!

From then on, the levels are terrible. Conversations are in whispers, and the music blasts literally make me jump!! When I try to fall asleep, the uneven levels constantly wake me up, so it defeats to the purpose to play this in the background. If I have it loud enough to hear the dialogue, the blares are painful. If I turn it town to avoid the jolts, I can't hear the majority if the film.

I haven't watched the extended cut, but the theatrical version is so distractingly unbalanced that I'm going to go back to my poor little DVD version and giving this to a bad friend.",1405209600,,984,4.251336898395722

745444,5,6303964745,"I absolutely love this movie! I was too young to see it -- since it's Rated-R (by the MPAA) -- when it first came out in the movie theaters, back in 1995, in which it was received mixed reviews by the critics & average numbers at the box-office, but even by the time I had seen it on VHS, three years later, in 1998, it was already becoming a cult classic (ditto for The Big Lebowski, although it technically was still new & at the box office, at the time, in '98). I loved it so much, that I purchased it on DVD -- it was one of my first DVDs -- when tech. was still new & DVD players were about $200 at the time (in 2001). However, unlike when this movie first came out on the DVD market -- 'back in 1999 -- which was early to adopt the new DVD format, it has taken many years to become available in Blu-ray, whose format first debuted (in the US public consumer market) in the Winter of 2006 (although part of it, I think, was due to the fact that it was easy for the production/studios to simply transfer everything from the Laser-Disc format to the DVD one, since they were both in SD -- Standard Definition -- digital format; unlike having to up-convert everything to 1080p HD for the BD format).  So, it goes without saying, that I was psyched -- another catchphrase from '95 -- when this movie finally came out on Blu-ray this year -- 2014 -- & was one of the first ones -- that I personally know of -- to purchase it on Blu-ray, in all its High Def. GLORY, & at half the price -- just 10 bucks -- from the original listed one ($19.98)! I like many of Kevin Smiths movies, but I absolutely love this one -- always have, always will! Without question, this IS my favorite Kevin Smith movie! Everything that I can relate to, and everything that was hip popular -- and now, considered ""classic"" -- at least, in subpop-culture, if not pop-culture, itself, was exactly was this movie was all about, 'back in the mid-'90s! Long before the world technologically evolved to the mobile, yet, fully information-connected social media-sharing pop-culture, that it is today, it was a time when the place to be -- whether you were cool or not, rich or poor, athletic or weak, smart or dumb -- was the (American Shopping) Mall, to just hang out with your friends and socialize all day long, without having to buy anything. It was a time when the Internet was just becoming mainstream to the populace, with the DOT.COM starting to take-off, new words, like ""The Information Superhighway,"" ""World Wide Web, & ""The Cyber-net"" was added to the American Lexicon, & dial-up was king, and the idea of shopping online was still considered dangerous, if nonexistent, compared to your local shopping mall; When Comic Books were still just for kids, or serious-minded collectors (mostly considered to be nerds, geeks, or dorks -- I know, because I was one of them), & were still mostly undiscovered territory for the movie studios to explore & (later) plunder, are were rarely considered to be movie-worthy at the box-office, and only die-hard comic book fans even knew who people, like Stan ""The Man"" Lee; and it was a time when large, fat, heavy CRT TVs occupied every American household, with the kids playing video games on them, with their SEGA or SUPER NINTENDO gaming consoles, or going to the local arcade, with a handful of quarters, to play with them. This movie, as far as I know of, was also the first to have a comic book themed opening credit sequence! Speaking of which, for me, the best part about this Blu-ray of MALLRATS, was that it came in a special (thin) cardboard slip-case, that, features a lot of fun trivia facts about the 1990s, which was the icing on the cake! If you've seen this movie, and you enjoyed it, then I can guarantee that you will love this Blu-ray of it!",1403740800,,3778,4.467438494934877

I love them all, but Mallrats seems to hit on all cylinders and with Malls going the way of the Dodo this film seems to capture a great moment in history with funny characters and a campy story.  It was a sincere follow-up to Clerks and I think the public was looking for more, got it and didn't understand that Mr. Smith delivered.

745797,5,6303964745,"Kevin Smith has repeatedly said that Jason Lee makes Mallrats, which is true. He was definitely the best part of a very underrated movie. Ultimately Mallrats had a very uphill battle to overcome being the movie that followed up Clerks. The premise was simple. Two friends get dumped and go hang out at a local mall. From there hilarity ensues. (Historical note for those who care, the mall involved looks totally different after massive renovations).

The movie has been around long enough now that those who are likely to be reading this will know what the movie is like, so I am not going to go in depth on the movie itself. If you have only seen Clerks at this point, you will recognize some of that story put into this one, and even actors from Clerks playing different roles in this movie. That is the one thing you have to accept with Kevin Smith's movies. He uses a lot of the same people in his movies, but casts them in different roles.

This DVD includes the theatrical cut of the move, as well as a 2 hr long extended cut (which is given an 11 min intro by Smith and Scott Moser). There is also a 50 min long Q&A session with some of the cast and crew. All in all, if you are a fan of the movie itself, a fan of Smith's movies in general, or just a fan of good comedy (all be it raunchy comedy) then definitely check this out.",1383004800,,1337,4.23921568627451

Mallrats isn't quite as good as Kevin Smith's Chasing Amy but it is so much fun. On the extras, Smith tells us when he got the call from the studio about the movie making spare change at theaters. It was over. Buy the DVD or the 10th anniversary edition DVD (which adds a Q&A with Kevin Smith and includes the deleted scenes from the DVD by incorporating them into the movie which extends the running time from 94 minutes to 123 minutes).

After the originality and indie appeal of Clerks, Smith followed up with this.  While Clerks felt original and edgy, this feels like a first-year Creative Writing student who was given a film to write and direct.

The dialogue is horribly contrived and wooden.  Actors are good but they have crap material to work with.  It's basically just some gags, one-liners, and not a lot going on.

746138,5,6303964745,"I will say I have been a Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) fan since Clerks first hit the video market.  Mallrats is a great addition to the ""slacker"" movie genre.  A young Jason Lee as Brodie, is at his comedic best in his first movie.  The language is a little rough and some of the subject matter is a bit rough, so, definitely not for the little ones, but this ""often overlooked"" movie is really good and brings ""Hanging out at the Mall"" to the big screen in a new light.

Kevin Smith does a wonderful job writing this movie.  He is known for writing great dialogue and Mallrats is no exception.  If you grew up in the 90's you can probably identify with this movie on some level, and should watch it.  I consider it a ""Gateway"" movie to the Kevin Smith world and often suggest that new visitors to that world start with this movie or ""Chasing Amy"".

If you haven't seen Mallrats, it is definitely worth a viewing; especially if you like a smartly written movie with some great dialogue, and blue language doesn't bother you.

746239,5,6303964745,"Mall Rats may not be Oscar-worthy per se, but its till worth watching if you're a Kevin Smith fan. The film stars both Ben Affleck and former skateboarder Jason Lee in their film debuts.

The plot: T.S. Quint (played by Jeremy London) and Brodie Bruce (played by the aforementioned Jason Lee) are two best friends, who spend too much time at their local mall, and are then dumped by their girlfriends Brandi Svenning (played by Claire Forlani) and Rene Mosier (played by Shannon Doherty) for being unemployed, immature and overall slackers. TS wants to get married to Brandi, even though he's still in college. But what stands in not only his way, but Brodie's way as well, is Brandi's father, Jared (played by Michael Rooker, of AMC's Walking Dead fame), who is hosting a game show, Truth or Date, at the duo's favorite mall. The two then ""hire"" the famed Clerks duo, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (film's director, Kevin Smith) to not only help them get their girlfriends back, but to trash the set of said show and get it kicked off the airwaves before it premieres. In an interesting subplot, Willam Black (played by Ethan Suplee in his film debut) has been spending his spare time from opening 'til closing staring at a Magic Eye poster, which is said to be a sailboat, however, he can't see it!

The DVD: This DVD is awesome, it is double sided. It has the original theatrical version on Side A, and on Side B, an extended, unrated version of the film which runs approximately 2 hrs., 1 min. (121 min.) as opposed to the original theatrical version which runs 1 hr. 35 min. (95 min.) Aside from that, the extras are fantastic!

Maybe some other blu ray release did but this one did not.  It has no special features and worse yet it's a Universal Studios blu ray which means you have to go through the fuss and bother of selecting a language and go through the Universal promos before getting to watch the thing and if you have a temperamental remote for your blu ray player like I do then you may have to go through this process a few times.

This is all played out with the local mall as the the backdrop. As I said before, the characters are memorable. Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith whose also the director)are scene steelers. I defy anyone not to memorize the phrase ""Snootchie Bootchie Nootchies"".

746433,4,6303964745,"I don't want to like this film. Really, I don't.

It's offensive and vulgar (don't let your kids see it, please). It features a 15-year-old girl who researches her book on sex by sleeping with a variety of men between 14 and 30 years old and videotaping the sessions. The Easter Bunny gets beaten up. And when Willem (Ethan Suplee) can't see the sailboat in the Magic Eye picture, he's mean to little children (a lot of the film seems to be mean to little children).

But there's something about Kevin Smith's films that I enjoy - it's certainly not the constant swearing, but it could be the adorable Jason Lee, or the ever-present Jay & Silent Bob.

Mallrats is about a couple of college-age slackers who get dumped by their girlfriends on the same day and visit the mall to cheer themselves up.

TS (Jeremy London) is the quiet one, brooding over his love, while Brodie (Lee) is the not-at-all quiet one, obsessing over comic books and video games and ranting about everything he sees.

London is nice but dull, while Lee makes the movie. This was his first major film role, and he's just hilarious. And he somehow makes his insensitive, argumentative character quite likeable.

Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith himself) are a lot of fun, as always, as they save the day for TS & Brodie and help them get their girlfriends back.

The movie doesn't really make any sense - there are many holes in the logic. But that's okay, it's not meant to be logical.

I really did hate the offensive parts (I can't watch when they beat up the Easter Bunny in front of little kids!). But, like I said, I couldn't help but enjoy the movie despite myself.

The movie seems to cling to the romanticized backdrop of a mall where two slackers out of their luck regarding women spend their time trying to find something interesting to do. The story is complicated by the fact the main character's love interest is being forced to date another man for the sake of her father's game show. From here begins an adventure for the sake of love, for chocolate pretzels, and for finally finding something to do.

The whole story is pretty funny and well put together considering the topic. Likely comic book fans will understand the main characters more than those who don't (it's a subculture even) but anyone can understand the general feel of the story depending upon if you like this sort of humor. I'd suggest watching it but if you didn't like Clerks you may find the same sort of humor here and be turned off to this as well.",1207526400,,1064,4.56544502617801

It seems that out of all of Kevin Smith's Jay and Silent Bob films, this one has received the most negative reviews.  Even my favorite film critic, Roger Ebert, gave this a 1 1/2 stars out of 4.  Personally, I can't see why.  Sure, it's not Kevin Smith's best film (that award goes to either Clerks or Chasing Amy), and its definitely not a great film, but its also not nearly as bad as a lot of critics make it out to be.  I find the dialogue relatively witty, the interplay between the characters fun, and the minor romantic elements charming, at the least.  Yes, the plot is relatively vapid, the acting is bad, and the overall refinement is a little lacking.  However, I feel that all of it just adds to the overall charm.

If you're not, just stick to the Collector's Edition you have now.

I'm a huge fan of everything that Kevin Smith and Company have done over the last fourteen years, but I was honestly a bit disappointed that this DVD didn't bring a lot to the table. You have the theatrical feature (with commentary) as well as the same features you had with the Collector's Edition DVD. The only difference on this DVD is that rather than seeing the cut footage as cut footage, Kevin and Scott cut it back into the film, creating the ""extended"" cut, and you also have a short 10th Anniversary Q&A with Kevin, Scott Mosier, and some of the cast.

Those are really the only differences. I was personally hoping for a little more effort. Perhaps an updated commentary track?

(Jeremy London) and Brodie (a wonderfully cast Jason Lee), lose their girlfriends and set about trying to reclaim their pride (and hopefully their ladies) in the last place you would expect - the mall. However, once they get there, the two push the limits of decency (and mall etiquette), as they encounter an array of mall denizens, including the utterly hilarious Jay and Silent Bob (from CLERKS). A surprising number of whimsical misadventures ensue (with both friend and foe), bringing the boys closer and closer to the possibility of reuniting with their lost ladies.

Kevin Smith's first ""big-budget"" studio picture continues his wonderful ability for writing hysterical yet thoughtful dialogue while throwing in nods to JAWS (the leads are named Brodie and Quint), John Hughes, Tim Burton's BATMAN and his continuing love affair with George Lucas' STAR WARS saga. And while the movie is from UNIVERSAL PICTURES, it sometimes comes off more like a WARNER BROS cartoon (with London and Lee starring as live action versions of Bugs and Daffy. The forever amusing Jay and Silent Bob venture into WIle E. Coyote territory as they attempt to destroy the game show set that is being constructed at the mall. (They even have humorous cartoonish blueprints for each of their elaborately wacky attempts.)

The opening credits show the talented young cast depicted as Marvel comic superheroes. (Comic book legend Stan Lee is even on hand in a fun cameo as himself.) The plot situations are presented just slightly over-the-top as are the film's resident super-villains played by Michael Rooker and Ben Affleck. (Both so delightfully evil that you just cannot wait to see our superheroes give them the comeuppance they so richly deserve.) And peppered throughout all this mayhem, we're treated to Kevin Smith's wonderful wise and witty dialogue about life and love.

Whether or not you wish to see the original version or the extended 10th anniversary edition matters little as both are included on this disc. But my advice is to watch the extended version at least once. I found that the extra 30 minutes richly enhanced the proceedings and the completely new beginning features an absolutely hysterical cameo by Elizabeth Ashley.

The bonus features are terrific! Be sure to watch the 50 minute Q & A segment featuring the cast and crew at a 10th anniversary screening of the film with a highly receptive audience (who are just as amusing as the people on the stage.)

Mallrats had the leased succesful release and following months of any of his movies. this is probably Rogue Pictures fault for not putting enough priority on publicizing this movie. nonetheless it's found its following over the years, and rightfully so.

The extended edition contains about 20 minutes to a half hour of deleted footage from the night before the movie takes place. these scenes are decent but throught it i just wanted to get to the morning to see the real mallrats. Kevin Smith did call it the version that should've never been. aside from the extended version of the film, this 10th anniversary edition has loads of special features. deleted scenes, commentary, and all the other bonus features you would expect are here. not in quite as much quantity as i would hope after Clerks X though.

the film plays though in a similar style of mallrats, but with a bigger budget and a few more locations(TC and Brodies houses, strip mall). the majority of the movie takes place at the mall though.

Jason Lee really makes the movie. his character (Brodie) has such a strong, sarcastic personality. he's hilarious. the main character (TC) is pretty bland. i don't think he did anything funny throughout the movie. thats fine because you don't need to be funny when you're next to jason lee. he carried all the jokes perfectly throught this movie.

the basic plot is this: the whole movie takes place in one day, like Clerks. both Brodie and his girlfriend and TC and his girlfriend breakup in the morning. they meet up and end up hanging out at the mall all day while TC tries to think of a way to get his girl back. Jay and Silent Bob of course appear throughout the movie, and their parts are some of the most hilarious/outrageous.

I do give Kevin Smith credit, he cranks out films he's written and stamps them with a distinct energy and perspective. That certainly positions him as a artist, and a sort of visionary. But his visions in the first 45 minutes of Mallrats are boring, directionally slack, structurally flabby and not entertaining.",1167696000,6,578,5.579545454545454
746648,5,6303964745,"Granted, it's weaker than his other three films to date. On the other hand, a weak Kevin Smith movie is stronger than a strong film by most other writers/directors. This film is hilarious! It takes mall culture to a higher level! A good contrast to Richard Linklater's/Eric Bogosian's Suburbia, though it's better than Suburbia in most ways. Many of the pop culture refs and the satire of young adult life make this film even cooler! And how the hell did he get Stan Lee to appear? (And he was surprisingly really good!)

This is Shannen Doherty's best role (mainly because she's hardly ever on screen;), Jason Lee's best role, and Jeremy London's best role (not to be confused with twin brother Jason who was the awesome Randall Pink Floyd in Dazed and Confused...though Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams were both in Dazed as well...)

Look for an amusing role played by Ethan Suplee (Seth in American History X)

Overall: this film just plain rocks! It's got great quirky writing, great direction, solid acting, a three-nippled topless clairvoyant, a hilarious love connection parody, a 15 year old nympho (played by the amusing Claire Forlani), Stan Lee...what more could one ask for?? It's not his best, it has flaws, but it's still classic Smith! An easy 5 stars!",1166572800,4,1269,4.838709677419355

This is definitely a good buy and one of my favorite movies because of the simple fact that I don't have to be in the mood to watch it. I can pop it in at any time and be completely amused for the next 94 minutes.

TS (London) and Brodie get dumped by there girls on the same morning and decide to heal at the mall.  Brodie's antics and his almost fight outside the comic book store are pure gold.  They both end up on Brandi's (Forlani) dad's game show that's being broadcast from the mall.  Comedy ensues.

The film was his first (fairly) big budget film and recieved terrible reviews and ended up flopping at the box office. In the 11 years it's been in release, it's achieved cult status. I'm not sure how this movie got recieved so badly, when it truly is a great and very funny movie. As, my title says...It's my favorite Kevin Smith movie. I mean, yeah, the movie does have a silly plot and some of the things that happen are stupid. But the dialogue is smart and witty...And f**k, the thing's funny. OK? The movie stars Jason Lee (Dogma, My Name is Earl) and Jeremy London as Brodie & T.S. Brodie is a slacker who lives with his parents and plays video games and reads comic books. Fed up, his girlfriend Rene (Shannen Doherty) breaks up with him. T.S. is taking his girlfriend Brandi (Claire Forlani) to Florida, where he's going to propose to her at Universal Studios Theme Park when Jaws pops out of the water. Stupid...Yes. Funny...Yes. A problem occurs when a girl who was set to appear on Brandi's fathers TV show died of a massive brain embolism, because of a remark T.S. made, and Brandi has to go on. Brandi ends up breaking up with T.S. as well. T.S. flocks over to Brodie's house where the two discuss their relationships and decide to go to the mall. When they get there, we meet a number of colorful characters including William (Eathan Suplee) who's staring at one of those posters that's supposed to show a 3-D image if you stare at it long enough and everyone sees it except him. There's

Jay & Silent Bob (Jason Mewes & Kevin Smith) of course. Gwen (Joey Lauren Adams) a former girlfriend of T.S.'s. Shannon (Ben Affleck), the manager of the store Fashionable Male who wants to bed Rene. Oh and coincidentally there's Brandi's dad Mr. Svenning (Michael Rooker) who's doing his game show in the mall. At this point Brodie and T.S. begin to hatch a plan to sabotage the game shows and get their girlfriends back. I don't want to say much more on the synopsis, but if you liked Clerks, Chasing Amy, or Dogma you should like this movie. All the characters are played perfectly by each actors; Michael Rooker is more sadistic in this movie than he was in ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"". Jason Lee is his normal goofy self. It truly belongs in the Top 100 Comedies of All Time. Enjoy!

GRADE: A

SIDE-NOTE: As for the Extended Version of the film. It's pretty different and Kevin Smith called it ""The version of Mallrats that should never have been"".

We got the 15 year old girl who does sex research, a dude who can't see the sailboat in those crazy posters that were all dots, and a mall security guy who wears a 1920's era straw hat.

The 'climax' of this film is when the college guy gets his girlfriend back at the mall while getting onto a dating game show being held at the mall, that just so happens to be run by her father. He of course gets food poisoning from 'ass pretzels'.

Jay and Silent Bob run amock and we even get to see a female topless fortune teller with an edible third nipple.

The quotable lines are countless. The talent found in casting is absolutely outstanding. The dialogue is quirky, thoughtful and biting, etc., etc...  It's difficult to attribute the movie's failure to anything other than poor marketing and it not being properly prioritized by Rogue Pictures.  But, whatever the cause, Mallrats has found it's cult following in the years following its release.  It's too good a movie to have remained unnoticed and unappreciated for too long.

The 10th Anniversary DVD includes an extended version of the movie, as edited by Kevin Smith himself, while pleasuring himself so that he could truly ""enjoy"" his work (as revealed in the bonus interview).  This version is hilarious and it gives you a slightly different feel for the movie, as alternate scenes or settings are used in certain places.  It's interesting and just as hilarious as the theatrical version.  The bonus DVD also includes a few featurettes, interviews and a feature commentary track with most of the cast.

746770,4,6303964745,"Mallrats is actually my first Kevin Smith film.  This is one of those films I wish I liked less than I do because it is pretty stupid, it inflicts a really doughy Ben Affleck on us, and it gets pretty campy and predictable in the end.  It's not hard to see why critics hated it and theatre-goers didn't exactly fill the aisles to see it - the characters may be college age, but this really plays as a teen film, and the deserved R rating kept a good part of the target audience away.

After being dumped by their girlfriends, T.S. (Jeremy London) and Brodie (Jason Lee) decide on a little mall therapy, and so the mallrat adventure begins.  T.S. is rather annoying, actually, but Brodie is a great character - a flippant, constantly amusing wise-acre who is frighteningly intelligent in the most obscure of ways.  His endless chatter would drive you crazy after a few hours, but, fortunately, you only have to spend an hour and a half with him in the movie.  The girls, neither of whom is adequately developed as a character, are also at the mall - as are Jay and Silent Bob and other assorted oddballs.  The guys are anxious to try and patch things up with their girls, but each one faces a major obstacle: for T.S., it is his girl's brutish father, while an almost unrecognizably doughy, unimpressive Ben Affleck is laying claim to the girl Brodie thinks is rightly his.

A boatload of hijinx and juvenile situations arise, sexual innuendoes dot the cinematic landscape, and a good time is had by all.  There's nothing very original about the plot (apart from the dispensing of romantic advice from the lips of comics legend Stan Lee), but the film is continually entertaining throughout.  It really comes down to Jason Lee; as far as I'm concerned, he carries the whole film on his back and almost single-handedly makes everything entertaining.",1132963200,,1847,4.655384615384615

746863,5,6303964745,"I've been a Kevin Smith fan since the fifth grade, when a viewing of ""Chasing Amy"" changed my life forever.  Since then, I've purchased all his films and enjoyed them immensely - with the exception of ""Mallrats"".  For some reason, I just never got around to seeing it.  But then I heard that the 10th Anniversary Edition was coming out, so I scurried out to the stores and after a little searching around, I found it.  As soon as I got home, I popped the DVD in the player, sat down in a comfy recliner, and finally watched the one Kevin Smith movie I hadn't seen.

""Mallrats"" revolves around T.S. Quint (Jeremy London) and Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee).  (Get it?  Brodie and Quint?  Like in ""Jaws""?  Yeah.)  T.S. is about to take his girlfriend, Brandi (Claire Forlani), to Florida, where he intends to propose to her.  But her father's plans get in the way and lead to a heated argument, which ends with Brandi dumping T.S.  It just so happens that at the same time, T.S.'s best friend, Brodie, has been dumped by his girlfriend Rene (Shannon Doherty).  What are these two friends to do?  Why, go to the mall, of course.

Throughout the rest of the film, T.S. and Brodie try to find a way to patch up their relationships while getting involved in all sorts of trouble at the mall.  Everyone's favorite stoners, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself), show up.  There's all sorts of lovely connections with other events mentioned in the films and some subtle references to other Smith movies - including one at the end of the film, an unintentional foreshadowing of what was to come in the View Askew semi-finale, ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"".

The cast is fine.  Doherty, Forlani, a young Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, and Stan Lee (yes, the comic book guy) all give good performances.  Ethan Suplee is very funny as William Black, who is tormented by the fact that he can't see the sailboat in a ""Hidden Image"" portrait.  The highlight of the film, without a doubt, is Jason Lee.  Lee, as always, delivers an outrageous, hilarious, absolutely perfect performance as the wisecracking, rude Brodie Bruce.  Priscilla Barnes makes a brief appearance as a fortune teller with ... special attributes.

So is ""Mallrats"" Smith's best film?  Heck, no.  People who had just seen ""Clerks."" were very disappointed, and I can see why.  Critics bashed the film and it flopped at the box office.  But on video, it became a huge smash, and this I can understand as well.  While ""Mallrats"" is arguably Smith's worst film, it's funny as hell.  The film is full of absolutely hilarious moments.  If you're looking for a film to entertain you and leave you out of breath from laughter, this is the movie for you.

Personally, I loved ""Mallrats"".  It's easy to see why so many loyal Kevin Smith fans have embraced the film.  Laughs-a-plenty and Jason Lee.  What more could you ask for?

-------------

DVD: The 10th Anniversary DVD contains a load of nifty special features, including a two-hour plus extended cut of the film (which I look forward to watching), as well as a Q&A session and numerous interviews.  There's also outtakes and some neat easter eggs.  Fans of the film, or of Kevin Smith in general, won't want to pass this baby up.",1127606400,3,3237,4.651943462897527
746864,5,6303964745,"Well, folks, it's been ten years since the would-be cult classic ""Mallrats"" bombed both critically and at the box office. To celebrate such failure, director Kevin Smith and company have erected a brand new double-dip...errr...I mean special edition DVD. Aside from the usual distractions (i.e. featurettes, commentary), the main attraction is an all new extended-cut of the flick, done by Kevin Smith himself. This new cut (don't fret, the original remains intact on the opposite side of the disc) integrates deleted footage and alternate takes into what ends up being a sprawling two hour and three minute epic. Think James Cameron re-editing ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Ok, maybe not that big of a deal, but it's still cool, nevertheless. The ""Extended Version"" is (as Smith describes it in his introduction) basically the script put to screen. The ""new"" film is just as funny, and actually, better. I never had a problem with the original ""Mallrats,"" but for some reason, this version feels more complete -- or incomplete? Watch the introduction...

The film, whichever version you choose, is classic Kevin Smith. As a follow-up to ""Clerks,"" it suffers, but if you want to be entertained and want to laugh, this is the right place to come. The story is centered on two slackers, who are both dumped at the same time and come to the mall to cope. Along the way, they run into friends, enemies, crooked security guards, nerdy comic book fans, Stan Lee, and the infamous Jay And Silent Bob. Dick and fart jokes ensue. Not only is it Smith's first ""colored"" flick, but it is also his first time working under a studio, and his first time working with View Askew regulars Ben Affleck and Jason Lee (who play enemies in this movie). These two findings were pure gold. Ben Affleck would go on to give Smith his finest performances in ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Jersey Girl,"" while Lee establishes himself as being outright hilarious and natural, right off the bat in this movie. The film itself is not without it's flaws, but the old saying goes ""Time heals all wounds."" When this movie first came out, it tanked, and it tanked hard. Now, ten years later, it has it's own cult audience, and surely, Kevin Smith has recovered from the initial disappointment. Hell, at the very least, it's good enough to warrant a revisiting on DVD.

If you owned the original DVD, you can give it up soundly when you by this DVD. Aside from a few minor things (i.e. the multi-angle commentary), most of the special features are intact with this new release. While not as extensive as last years ""Clerks X"" release, it still offers a bounty of supplemental material. The highlight being the ""Mallrats Reunion Q & A"" where the cast and crew get together for one big interview. Also, as mentioned before, the ""Extended Version"" of this film is also worth checking out if you are a diehard Kevin Smith fan. However, I have to warn, if you already own the first DVD and are just a mild Kevin Smith fan, you will probably be safe leaving this re-release alone. For me, and other people who just have to hear everything that comes out of his mouth, however, it is worth buying into the evil double dip.",1127260800,113,3169,4.72875226039783

746866,5,6303964745,"From the beginning credits (and the hilarious images of the characters as comic book heroes) to the conclusion (Jay and Silent Bob with ""Suzanne"") Mallrats is a laugh riot.  I heard about it when it came out, but of course, it was rated R (I was only 16 at the time) and I couldn't see it.  I lost track of it for a few years, then saw it in 1997, when I was in tech school in Mississippi.  I can tell you, it was well worth the wait.

Mallrats occurs a day after the events in Clerks, the major differences being that it was in color (yeah, I hate black and white films, they hurt my eyes), it was on a much grander scale (as Kevin Smith had a bigger budget), and it was set in a mall instead of a Qwik Stop (hence, why it wasn't received as well).  People who watch this film expecting to see ""Clerks II"", will be sorely disappointed, this is a totally different genre.  Don't get me wrong, the crude jokes, pop culture references, and profanity are there, but there is better character development in this film.  This movie was in trouble from the start, having to open in the same summer as ""Batman Forever"", ""Braveheart"", and ""Congo"", but as you know, the money for the studios doesn't stop with the box office (just look at The Rocky Horror Picture Show).  True Kevin Smith fans will enjoy this film, as it continues the New Jersey Saga, you'll recognize the names of characters referenced in ""Clerks"" and later films.  Jay and Silent Bob have longer, more humorous parts in Mallrats (much to my delight), a lot of their funniest dialogue is in the movie.  I don't want to spoil it for you, watch the film!

My only problem, real teenagers do not speak like this, adults are not even this articulate, thoughtgoing, and quickwitted as these characters, but hey, it is just a film. That is what makes it special and fun. We all know that a teenagers hangout during the day is the one and only local indoor shopping mall. Jay and silent Bob are the modern version of Cheech and Chong. The incredible vocabulary and fast witted Brodie,(Jason Lee), is perplexing and mesmerizing. I love this film. Love how the film relies on dialogue for its main comedic offer, no need for a ton of visual gags, although we do get them. The game show scene had me in tears, and the poor guy who can't see the boat in the hidden pic cracks me up. No top awards for this film, but it will leave a smile on your face. Grab some friends, beer, smokes(legal ones), Ha, and have a Kevin Smith good time.

As for the supposed problem of two sided discs, I don't see it as a problem at all. Except for those who have multi-disc players, you still have to get up and change the disc, whether it be a two sided disc or a multi-disc set. As long as care is taken with the transfer, and the menus work properly, it doesn't matter how many discs are there.

A lot has been said about this movie, mainly that it isn't funny, or Smith's worst movie, but I feel differently. I think Mallrats is not ment to be a cinamatic masterpiece, I think it's suppsed to be a stupid teen comedy. And if you watch it in that light, you'll fully enjoy it.

746998,4,6303964745,"After hearing how awful this was, how it followed the old curse of being the crappy middle movie in between two good ones, I knew I had to see it.  I rented it from the local video store and had to watch it again.  Somehow the story doesn't matter but for what it's worth: Two losers (Jeremy London, Jason Lee) dubbed ""Mallrats"" by the said a-hole from the Fashionable Male store in the local mall (Ben Affleck), go to said mall after being dealt with the simultaneous double loss of losing their girlfriends.  Brodie and T.S. (Lee and London) spend the rest of the movie sulking about being dumped and when the opportunity presents itself: attempting to win their girls back, amid constant bickering and jabbering about comic book mythology.  Add in a cheesy dating game rip off where T.S.'s girlfriend is to be auctioned off to the highest bidder by her father (the failing TY executive) and the sloppy attempts to crash the stage it's to be held on by two pot smoking slackers, plus the assault on an Easter Bunny, a hidden picture of a sailboat, and Stan Lee you make for one crazy film put together rather shabbily but effectively (in my opinion) by writer/director Kevin Smith, his second after the critically acclaimed CLERKS.  This film is obviously sophomoric and that's what's so great about it.  At one point Brodie and T.S. encounter a topless fortune teller with three nipples in a Dirt Mall while dodging police after being wrongly accused of possession of illegal drugs.  If that isn't enough to either interest you or turn you off, I don't know what is.  What got me overall though, what keeps me watching this insane movie is Jason Lee's hilarious portrayal of the comic obsessed Brodie Bruce, who spouts off priceless lines such as: ""How do you know he's not my sidekick.""  When Brodie and his ex Renee are arguing and Brodie yells out of nowhere: ""That guy looks like a date rapist!"" , referring to her new boyfriend (Affleck) I almost die laughing. He overeacts to everything and is constantly funny.  He obviously has no clue what is going on, is too mentally clouded by his lack of sleep and comic book collection, and makes an ass of himself nonstop, oh man.  I can't begin to describe how hilarious this movie is.  Sure some scenes are a bit too much (Stink Palm anyone?) but they're constantly overweighed by the good.  London's portrayal of T.S. is a bit dry but that's okay, Lee takes over for everytime London ruins a line.  Ethan Suplee playing Willem Black, formally portrayed by Scott Mosier is the unfortunate bulk that can never see the hidden 3-D picture of the sailboat has a few scenes and they're great, due mostly to his outbreaks of sudden violence toward anyone distracting him from his quest of seeing the sailboat (""I'll see it if I have to go blind trying!"")  Attempt to ignore the few childish gags Smith throws in and just enjoy the madness, the awesome dialogue and various tales of Brodie's odd cousin Walter.",1117670400,,2956,4.657692307692308
746999,4,6303964745,"Suffering a nearly unanimous beating from critics, and grossing a meer 2 million, Mallrats will always be an underappreciated gem. The second in The New Jersey ""Trilogy"" Mallrats focuses on T.S. and Brodie, two hapless fellows who were recently dumped by their girlfriends, so they take solace at their local mall. There they run into some old friends, such as Willam, a guy who does nothing than stare at the magic eye, their old friend from High School Gwen, and of course Jay and Silent Bob. Brodie is trying to believe that he's over his old girlfriend Rene, while T.S. is still hung over about his old girlfriend Brandi. T.S. won't give up trying to win Brandi back, so he thinks that he should try and wreck her father's game show. Jay and Silent Bob decide to do that, while Brodie and T.S. wander around the mall. They discuss Superman's sex life, where the food court is exactly, and get kicked out of the mall. That event takes them to the dirt mall, where probably the funniest scene in the movies. Yes, I'm talking about the topless fortune teller scene, where T.S. makes a breakthrough about his past relationship, but where Brodie is just repulsed. Underrated, but wonderful. Yeah, Jeremy London [T.S.] isn't very good at acting but Jason Lee is hilarious as Brodie. How could the critics not like this movie? It's not nearly as crude as Clerks, but critics hated it. There are some thinks that I'll never understand. Since it went out of print, it's kinda hard to find a copy, but try and get a hold of it.

This is a brilliant movie with the best performance that Jason Lee has ever had.  If Animal House is Belushi's movie, Mallrats is Lee's.  No one except for Jeff Anderson (Randall in Clerks) has given me laughs with Smith's brilliant dialogue more than Lee.  Also, I loved the slightly campy Road Runner/Coyote fued that Jay and Silent Bob develops as they are trying to ruin the dating show.  It's really rare when someone tries to capture the spirit of such a thing anymore with live action... let alone pulls it off.  So take Mallrats for what it is, a follow up to a dark horse success that has more than one great performance, many terrific laughs, awesome dialogue and situational humor (obviously), and even a surprise cameo here or there (even from Three's Company if you dig deep enough into the cast list, Miss Ivannah if you were stumped).",1111795200,,959,4.546511627906977

Clerks - 5/5, The first film based on the Jersey peeps, One of the best too, Look what smoking does to you, You can have that picture, haha that part is classic! Arguably the best Kevin Smith film...

MallRats - 5/5 The almost equally good sequal to Clerks, focusing on the consumer, not the workers, I heard you were a big fan of chocolate covered pretzels, Another classic scene...

Chasing Amy - 3/5 OK, I thought Smiths ilms weres supposed to be hilarious, Not as much Jay, Bob, Brodie, T.S., Dante, Randal, I don't get it... One of the worst in the series...

Dogma - 3/5 You start to think Smith is falling off, First Chasing Amy, then this, Dont get me wrong, they are both OK films, but after the great Clerks, and MallRats, You would think he was losing it until...

Clerks : The Animated Series - 5/5 HAHA, I don't care if its animated or clean, This is awsome, about time we get to have more adventures with Dante & Randall, Smith strts getting his comedy back!!...

Jay & Silent Bob Strike back - 5/5, Yeah he got it back, This is funny, Lots of good adventures with the best charactars... (possibly) ever!!!...

Jersey Girl - 4/5, Yeah Im mad, Jay & Bob aren't hear, or any of the other great charactars, funny, but bring the vulgar, funny charactars we like back!!!

Great films, Start with Clekrs & Mallrats, then Jay & Bob S.B., & The animated Clerks DVD, then get Dogma, Jersey Girl, & Chasing Amy.",1107216000,,1494,4.38768115942029

747005,5,6303964745,"Can you say ""cult film""? Can you say ""cult director""? Can you say ""unexplained theatrical flop""? Can you say ""hurrah""? Can you believe that Mallrats has finally been given the Collector's Edition release it so richly deserves?

Mallrats is regarded by some to be one of Kevin Smith's weaker films - me, I think it rocks (dude)! Basically, the film is a romantic comedy - with an edge. T.S. (Jeremy London, Party of Five) and Brodie (Jason Lee, Dogma and Vanilla Sky) are dumped by their respective girlfriends on the same day. They choose to commiserate with each other by hanging out at the local mall - not shopping, not browsing - just hangin'. There they bump into old chums (and omnipresent Smith characters) Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith). Other characters who flit in and out of their field of vision include Willam, who spends his entire day trying to determine exactly what is hidden in the ""Magic Eye"" 3-D picture, Stan Lee (himself) the comic book creator, Shannon (Ben Affleck) the smarmy menswear store manager and Mr Svenning (Michael Rooker) - who is at the mall to film a new television show called Truth or Date.

Of course Brodie's ex-girlfriend Rene (Shannen Doherty) and T.S.' former squeeze Brandi (Claire Forlani) also appear at the mall. Naturally, it doesn't take too long before the laconic guile of TS and Brodie combines with the dangerous enthusiasm of Jay and Silent Bob with a collective force equivalent to the Big Bang - and a cunning plot to win back the girls is hatched! The remainder of the film charts the emotional (and sometimes physical) collision of these and many other quirky Smith-penned characters, providing a funny, warm and idiosyncratic story as he tries to show us that love (plus luck and dope) can conquer all.

Mallrats is a cult film for a reason. Kevin Smith manages to provide mundane characters with just enough of a twist to make their every word (or silence, in the case of Bob) a pearl. When strung together, these somehow manage to fashion a beautiful necklace of a story. This may not be Smith's meisterwerk, but it is a damned good film, finally given a Collector's Edition DVD release which does it justice. Fans may not be able to resist buying this. Highly recommended for Smith fans, and for lovers of quirky, cool, funny - and fun - films.",1104192000,2,2323,4.730864197530864

747090,5,6303964745,"Most people who criticize this film did not really appreciate any of the other Kevin Smith films either. The idea that first sequels are no good is just a cliche and it's quite unfortunate people would use it as a legitimate critique of a film.

The dialogues are just as good as in Clerks and there are plenty of Jay and Silent Bob scenes.",1098921600,,340,4.3125
747091,4,6303964745,"After the success of Clerks, it was only a matter of time before a large studio offered Kevin Smith a big movie deal.  That deal was with Universal and that movie was called Mallrats.  It still follows the same formula that made Clerks so good and added quality and actors to help improve on it.  In addition, Kevin Smith also learned how to appropriately cut down a film and increase pacing to keep the audience interested (which is proven by the popularity).  The crude nature and language of this film for a realtively unknown moviemaker killed it at the box office.  This movie is considered a bomb, which it was compared to the budget, and the difference between this and Clerks & Chasing Amy are that they weren't expected to be successful and this was.

It's that crucial moment in T.S. Quint's (Jeremy London) life, today is the day he and girlfriend Brandi Svenning (Claire Forlani) are going on a trip to Florida.  Only this trip is no ordinary trip, this is the trip that T.S. plans to propose on (during the Universal Tour when Jaws pops out).  Unfortunately, Brandi's father has a television show and yesterday T.S. told the female contestant that she'd look fatter on TV and as a result she died from an embolism in her brain while doing laps at the YMCA!  As a result Brandi will be doing her father's show and their Florida trip is cancelled; and to make matters worse, T.S. and Brandi end up breaking up over it!  Now, depressed and alone T.S. decides to console his best friend Brodie (Jason Lee) for advice and consolement.  Ironically this was the morning that Brodie's girlfriend Rene (Shannon Doherty) has decided that she's had enough of his crap.  Now these two friends have no better activity than to do what they always do, roam the local mall for no apparent reason to feel better.  What results is a slew of interesting situations, makeups and breakups, and even a great story about sex in uncomfortable places (like the back of a Volkswagon)!

Kevin Smith has done it again! He's taken a script that on the surface not only seems meaningless, but also short and pointless, and turns it into an entertaining story that keeps your interest.  His new regular actors Jason Lee and Ben Afflec help enhance the experience in this installment with Jason Lee being the scene stealer from the beginning.  Shannon Doherty does an impressive job of playing off Smith's script as well.  This also sparked the introduction of Joey Lauren Adams into Smith's films, who later leads the backbone to Smith's next movie Chasing Amy.  The end result is an enhanced version of the situations in Clerks, complete with random situations involving Smith and Mewes as the dynamic duo Jay and Silent Bob.  The dialogue is sharp, the actors much more upgraded, the look is clean and crisp, and the story flows quite smoothly.  I have noticed that unlike Clerks, few people I've showed Mallrats to tuned out.  This second istallment is definitely an improvement on Clerks and a great sleeper film that was appreciated by fans of this independent filmmaker.

The DVD is, like most Kevin Smith DVDs, impressively packed with Special Features.  We get a slew of deleted scenes which not only add plenty of backstory to explain most of the questionable jokes from the final cut, but also prove that Kevin Smith has developed in his editing techniques.  Universal should be extremely happy they released this DVD because it has to be the only way they can intend on making back the money they lost making it.  If you're a fan Kevin Smith or if you love raunchy humor, this is a must own, otherwise you may want to consider renting first to see if it's your forte.",1093305600,3,3660,4.690140845070423
747092,4,6303964745,"This was the last Kevin Smith movie I needed to get, until I completed the collection - well, until Jersey Girl comes out on DVD anyway. I was so happy to get this one, as it seems really difficult/really expensive to get on DVD. As this is the last Kevin Smith film I have to see, featuring Jay & Silent Bob, I see a lot of the same characters/references to other films, which otherwise, I would have missed. I hope there are more references in Jersey Girl - and if Jay & Silent Bob appear, I'll be very happy! I've also heard rumours about a Clerks 2, plus there's a 10th anniversary edition of Clerks out soon.

 Anyway, getting off track. Ben Affleck doesn't have much of a part in this, and he comes across as a complete idiot. He also looks really young! Jeremy London (who looks like a younger version of Brendan Fraser), and Shannon Docherty aren't really 'regulars' of Kevin Smith films, so it was strange to see them there. Dante from Clerks appears near the end, and I didn't recognise him due to the hair!

 There's not many funny moments in this, despite what I was hoping for, and the two funny moments occur quite near the start - and had me in fits for the rest of the film. These both involve Jason Lee entering the mall! The first is when Ben Affleck knocks into him, making him spill his coffee, which he then promptly slips on, and nearly falls flat on his face. This seems to be an unscripted moment, as it looks purely accidental. Which adds to the hilarity! Then a few seconds on, Jason Lee is walking backwards, and when he turns round, instantly gets smacked in the face by a ladder! It's the way he sits up afterwards and asks: ""Where did that come from?!""

 Brodie totally reminded me of someone I know, what with his obsession with comics, and the video games - although thankfully he doesn't have them in his bedroom! :)

 It's the usual extras for this DVD, although not up to Dogma standards thankfully! There is an easter egg on this, which is pretty easy to find, and isn't really technically an easter egg - it's Kevin Smith goofing around as usual. The music video to ""Build Me Up Buttercup"" is so hilarious, and it's just Jay & Silent Bob messing about and spoofing everything about music videos - including Jay doing some daft but funny dancing!

 This is well-worth watching, if you're a fan of Kevin Smith, and his alter ego, Silent Bob. I'm just waiting for Jersey Girl now, which appears to have Jason Biggs in it, as well as Liv Tyler? I'm hoping for Jay & Silent Bob!",1091491200,,2510,4.390086206896552

Plot Summary: Two best friends whose girlfriends dump them on the same day seek solace in wandering around the local mall. Once there, wild and whacky events ensue that give them a chance to set things right with their girlfriends before it's too late.
Review and Comments: Words cannot describe what happens in this movie, it's one of those ""you had to be there"" kind of things...that's why the plot summary won't do the story justice. And once you see it, you either buy into it and like what you see, or you're violently annoyed by the proceedings. I can fully understand both reactions, but I'm firmly on the side of enjoying this movie. Yes, it's absurd. A lot of the comedy is slapstick. Yes, it involves a slacker college-age guy taking his less-of-a-slacker college student friend to wander around the mall the day they both experience breakups. Yes, they get into a bunch of weird and quirky situations that are either funny or annoying, depending on your sense of humor. I laughed a lot.
The relationships are about as one-dimensional as you can get. I think there's too much weird humor going on here for me to get too involved with the characters. But I appreciate how much these guys love their girlfriends. I appreciate that Brodie (Jason Lee) can't admit how much he loves his ex girlfriend, even though everyone can see it. I appreciate that Brandi (Claire Forlani) can't admit how much she loves T.S. (Jeremy London) because she's too busy trying to be mad at him and justify her breakup to herself. It's sweet to watch at times, but not much more than that. If you want depth, look elsewhere.
The comedy is what saves this movie, which is why you have to find it funny, or the movie will just annoy the hell out of you. There are several gross-out jokes, including one that made me want to puke. The elevator sex scene and ensuing discussion between the characters was hilarious. There's a running joke about a game show that's filming on a stage in the mall that night, and how Jay and Silent Bob keep attempting to sabotage it. There are about a million more, but I won't spoil them. Suffice it to say that slapstick comedy pervades this movie, and if you don't like that, you won't enjoy the movie. The ending is corny and sweet, and the proceedings are largely painless. It's not my favorite Smith film, but it's nowhere near as bad as critics made it out to be.
The Bottom Line: Perfectly fitting my weird sense of humor.",1086048000,,2893,4.650390625
747095,3,6303964745,"Of the 5 View Askewniverse films directed by Kevin Smith (Silent Bob in all 5), this one is probably the worst.  It doesn't have the sly social commentary of Clerks, the touching but romantic confusion of Chasing Amy, the sharp but worthwhile satire of Dogma, or the shameless but hilarious nostalgia of every film he's ever loved or made of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  But even Kevin Smith's worst film is still going to be a lot better than many films, especially of the gross-out comedy type (and Mallrats qualifies).
In many ways, this film is an ode to the 80s with a 90s brush.  The mall has all the answers, according to Brodie, the comic-book loving (but socially inept) main character played by Jason Lee.  He and his friend T.S. (one of the London boys) are beleagured by girl problems, or by their own problems dealing with girls.  Having broken up with girlfriends played by Shannen Doherty and Claire Forlani respectively, they find refuge in the local mall, the hallmark of society's youth. Hijinks ensue (don't hijinks always ensue in a Kevin Smith film...?) among the misuses of chocolate cookies, the mysteries of those Magic Eye pictures, the horrors of a father gone insane, the joys provided by comic book stores, and the trials of trying to use the Force when you're not meant to.  They meet a variety of characters, including a pompous sales rep played by a pre-fame Ben Affleck and, of course, local (every VA film starts in New Jersey) junkies Jay and Silent Bob, who provide the film's biggest laughs.  Admittedly, if those characters didn't make their characteristic appearance, this film would be something worse than what it is.  The film comes complete with references to many pop-culture loves of Mr. Smith, including a good deal of Star Wars props.
This is the second film of the VA series, and if you're a Smith fan, it's still worth owning.  The film is funny and smart, despite it's clunkiness, especially in the parts with Jay and Bob - the comedy is high, and the laughs are real.  It's not the best picture ever made, even by Kevin Smith, but it's a good flick for belly laughs if you need the comedy.",1085184000,,2143,4.660477453580902

There are some great perfrormances in there aside from Lee, but Brodie is like an icon now.  His delivery on scenes such as the kid on the escalator is absolutely priceless.  Lee's facial expressions and mannerisms are hysterical.
Of course Jay and Silent Bob provide some great laughs, but the funniest support comes from Ethan Suplee as Willem.  The scenes featuring the magic eye are priceless, especially the one with the small children...Suplee's reaction is my all time favorite moment in any movie, period.
Though he isn't exactly a villain, Michael Rooker is the perfect antagonist.  His role as Mr. Svenning is hysterical.
The movie is great...the dialogue, interaction, and timing is great.  It will have you on the floor.

747172,3,6303964745,"I remember seeing Mallrats when it was first released and thinking how good it was. It was probably a mix of the lingering Clerks honeymoon and the familiar setting of Eden Prairie, MN. But I've rewatched this film twice in the last week and it's slipped a couple of notches.
Here's why:
1. Mallrats is an exceedingly large production compared to Clerks. Think only about the different locations between the two films. Convenience/Video Store vs. 2 malls in 2 different states. The Mall in MN was somewhat of a ghost town during the filming period so they were able to customize the stores more than a typical mall (Carpet Munchers and Buy Me Toys). The grandure of the production seems to detract from the meat of the film. Whereas Clerks was carried by it's dialogue.
2. Budget was of little concern to Smith (who made Clerks for chump change) for this film.  Seemingly unlimited funds facilitated a ""kitchen sink"" mentality. ""We've got enough money to do this, this and this"" As opposed to ""This or that"". So Mallrats is a little fat around the middle.
3. Acting - Be honest. After seeing this movie, did you think you'd ever see Jeremy London in another film? This guy couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. (Probably explains why he's on Seventh Heaven now.) Jason Lee is Jason Lee. Certainly not up for an Oscar, but convincing and charismatic. The rest of the cast is about average. I'm not suggesting we should expect top-notch acting here but at least make it natural.
I can't blame Kevin Smith for wanting to strike while the iron was hot here, but with a little more time and a little more focus, this could have been much better film. Smith may have been in a ""This is my one big shot, so I'm gonna show 'em everything I got"" mindset. Smith figured out the patience factor with Chasing Amy and honed his directing skills in Dogma.

What was astinishing about mallrats to me is it could so easily be a situation that you and your friends could come across. The humour of it was so relatable that i believe me and my friend took after jay and silent bob so well that it made me laugh as soon as i saw the tapping on the glass at the pet store, mallrats would have to be one of the most outstanding feel good movies of our time, those who showed a passion of this kevin smith masterpiece should take time to look for in the local video store for these 3 films empire records, friday and dogma all and all if you ever find yourself in the middle of the day with nothing to do and little money why not get some friends together and see mallrats, in my opinion you will not be dissapointed, clearly in my top five best comedy movies of all time.  by Age casper",1065830400,,1138,4.075892857142857

Of course on a lower budget, (with Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy) he really couldn't rely on fancy visual effects to get the job done.  Luckily, he writes some of the wittiest, most hysterical dialgue and monolgues ever put to film.. See the movie and you'll see what I mean.

Here I guess he mistakenly tried his hand at being a better director, and the result is a mess of a picture -- anything remotely original or offbeat is buried under another ho-hum teen explotation flick. Even the sight gags are tired and unoriginal.

I had hoped that Smith would have used Mallrats to create a subversive film (like he did in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) about suburbia. Instead it was like he was expelling some latent adolescent nonsense that had been swirling inside him for years. Sorry, but I'm not interested Kevin Smith's juvinile private parts.

The slackers? Yawn. The over-smart Catholic School vixen? zzzzz. The happily-ever-after ending? Please.

Fortunately, he moved on to more mature ideas -- love in the absolutely brilliant ""Chasing Amy"", and the relationship of God and man in ""Dogma"". Even in ""Clerks"" he challenged us with ideas about finding purpose in the face of circumstances beyond our control.

In fact, its quite smart. Of course I am a little biased, I love Jason Lee so much I actually like Drawing Flies. Sad thing is, I'm not kidding.

747255,5,6303964745,"Mallrats is a teen comedy. That right there should explain some of the plot; guys who aren't really the most popular trying to get girls. This is the basic mold for such movies, and to some extent, Smith doesn't break it. T.S. Quint (portrayed, rather poorly, i might add, by Jeremy London) and Brodie Bruce (brought to you by Jason Lee, in an excellent performance) lose their girlfriends and decide to go to the mall to solve their problems. There, they discover that T.S's former girlfriend who is 'being auctioned off' on her father's gameshow is there, for the shooting of the show. Brodie's ex is also there, but not in any truly prominent role until the elevator scene. T.S. and Brodie get stoners and mischief makers-extraordinaire Jay and Silent Bob to interfere with the game show, make sure it doesn't happen. That is where I leave you as far as plot goes, so as not to spoil the movie. Anyway, the general opinion on this movie at release was that it was terrible. Very few critics wrote anything remotely good about it, and decided that it just didn't work as a movie. However, 4 years later, with the release of American Pie, people realized that Mallrats was much the same breed. Therefore, it was a before its time teen comedy. DVD sales really helped the movie, and it has become one of the most loved of Kevin Smith's five (thusfar) excellent films.

  Before Kevin Smith had big budget casts, special effects and thousands of cameos in his films, he relied solely on dialogue.  And Mallrats is no exception.  As the second film in his career, (after the awesome Clerks) Mallrats certainly has some of the most brillian dialogue in a comedy ever.  It is clear this movie is aimed towards teenagers, and has most definitely secured a cult following among them, but the dialogue in this film is too witty to be simply dismissed as a typical teenage pop culture film.
  Also, the extras on the DVD are great.  The commentary alone is very funny, and very interesting, revealing many of the hundereds of inside jokes that are used throughout Kevin Smith's films.",1043193600,3,857,4.848275862068966

747337,5,6303964745,"From Brodie's opening narration involving his cousin Walter, the shots of the Eden Prairie Center and its various stores, and the comic book covers of the movie's characters, all while playing to Squirtgun's ""Social"", it's clear that this is going to be both an entertaining movie and a trip to the mall.  The name of the carpet outlet store got a big laugh out of me.
Mallrats starts as a spinoff from an occurrence mentioned in Clerks, where Julie Dwyer, the girl who died in mid-backstroke in the pool of the YMCA, cancels plans for T.S. Quint and Brandi to go on vacation in Florida.  As Julie was entering Brandi's father's game show, Brandi decides to take her place, to T.S.'s disgust.  An argument ensues and they break up.
Brodie, T.S.'s friend, also suffers a breakup with Renee, who leaves him a Dear John, seeing him as callow, without ambition, direction, job prospects, and challenged in the sex department.  She wants fulfillment and someone who doesn't fit her in between going to the comic book store or playing Sega games.
Brodie tells T.S. ""Let's ease our simultaneous double loss.""  T.S.:  ""Ritual suicide?""  Brodie:  ""No, you idiot!  The f---ing mall!""  And the adventure begins.
The main event involves the cheesy dating game conceived by Brandi's father that caused T.S. and Brandi's breakup.  Brodie hires Jay and Silent Bob to sabotage the stage.  There are two attempts, the first reminiscent of Looney Tunes cartoons, the other owes a nod to Batman, and both involve Gwen, an ex-girlfriend of T.S.  The duo have a lot more screen time than in Clerks and it's well spent.  Another good scene:  the one involving the Easter Bunny.  Brodie has to tangle with the violent and obnoxious Shannon Hamilton, the assistant manager of Fashionable Male who has a grudge against him and is moving in on Renne.
But this movie also serves as a transition to change, where Brodie and T.S. realize things about themselves and decide to be proactive instead of reactive.
Jason Lee (Brodie) steals this show hands off as the most engaging character here who is anal-retentive, temperamental, and who sometimes talks out of his you-know-what, but he's well worth watching.  He's got the best lines.  Despite her minimal screen time, the appealing Joey Lauren Adams's performance as Gwen is a preview to what she would do as Alyssa in Chasing Amy.  Jeremy plays T.S. as a reserved counterpart to Brodie who later finds his own voice at the end.  Kudos also to Shannen Doherty (Renee) and Renee Humphreys (Tricia Jones), who play crucial roles here.
Usual homages to pop-culture:  The Empire Strikes Back, Marvel Comics, those pictures with hidden images, the Dating Game, and Jaws.  Hint on the last:  what are the names of Rob Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss's characters?  And the names of our two male protagonists?
Although lambasted when it first came out, I simply see it as a different kind of movie from Clerks.  Yes, there's nothing deep and philosophical (Clerks, Chasing Amy), and it may be more mainstream, but then again, it's a nod to teen comedies of the 1980's, which were shallow but appealing in their own way, because of engaging characters.  I mean, what was the point of doing a Clerks-The Day After?  I stare closely at this movie and I don't see a sailboat, but a creatively entertaining movie.",1042761600,,3322,4.854351687388988

747339,5,6303964745,"From the writer/director of ""Clerks,"" ""Chasing Amy,"" ""Dogma,"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" Kevin Smith's second film ""Mallrats"" is a hilarious movie about all the trouble that can happen when you hang out at the mall and never buy anything.  As Smith described it himself, it's sort of like ""Clerks,"" but in a mall.
Although there are many characters involved in the film, the story mainly focuses on Brodie and T.S., two friends who have just been dumped by their girlfriends.  So they decide to go to the mall to forget about their worries.  However, things do not go as planned.  Brodie finds out that his ex is now seeing a man who loves to take advantage of women with broken hearts and T.S. discovers that the dating game show, created by his ex's father, is going to take place that day (with his ex now being the new contestant).  They know that drastic measures have to be made if they ever want to have their girlfriends back.  And that's only the beginning of all the craziness that takes place.
Forget what the critics think, this is a great movie.  I admit that it is not as good as ""Clerks,"" but it is a very funny movie that does not fail to delver the goods, despite what the critics have said.  The script is very well written, with the usual witty Smith dialogue.  Not only is it well directed and written, it is also well acted.  Jeremy London and Jason Lee are terrific at their parts and really steal the show, (especially Lee).  Other cast members, such as Shannen Doherty, Ben Affleck, Jason Mewes, and Michael Rooker, are just as great.
Now, onto the DVD.  This DVD edition is perfect for a movie like this, and does it justice.  There are so many special features, you don't even know where to begin.  Some of the features included are feature commentary by Kevin Smith, Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Scott Mosier, and Vincent Pereira, over one hour of hilarious deleted scenes, a featurette, the theatrical trailer, and live footage from the commentary session.  I'm sure some will think that's not a lot of features, but for one disk that's pretty amazing.  The picture and sound quality is really good as well.  Ten times better than the VHS version.
""Mallrats"" is a great comedy filled with laughs, excitement, and thrills.  If you're a Kevin Smith fan, then you will love it.  Even if you're not, you should still give it a shot.  Be warned that there's a lot of offensive humor and language, but I think it suits the film well.  A terrific movie and an outstanding DVD.  I couldn't be happier.",1041984000,,2540,4.560706401766004

MALLRATS is about 2 guys T.S. (Jeremy London) and Brodie (Jason Lee).  After breaking up with his girlfriend because she agreed to go on her father's copycat version of the Dating Game, he goes over to his friend Brodie's house and finds out that his girl, Renee (Shannon Dougherty) broke up with him as well.  Brodie, wanting to make his friend feel better, takes him to the mall.  It's a non stop laugh riot from sailboats to stage trashing to the backseat of Volkswagon, MALLRATS will keep you laughing from beginning to end.

Of course you can't because they're in this one as well.  Plus this movie is just wrong.  There are some really scandalous scenes (Ms Ivana's fortune telling and the game show).  And a very special cameo by Stan Lee, creator of Marvel Comics, doesn't hurt.
There is a lot of swearing, some nudity and some drug references but other than that, all good here.  You'll definitely want to add this to your collection.  Plus I had to give it 5 stars because this movie was filmed in MN and the ""Minneso-TAH accent"" (like in FARGO and DROP DEAD GORGEOUS) was not used!! That alone scores serious points.

747341,3,6303964745,"Kevin's second movie definatley holds true to that old sophmore jinx.
  The movie is about two friends (Brodie and T.S) who are dumped by their girlfriends, and retreat to the mall to brood and try to piece themselves together. When they arrive at the mall, there is a stage being set up for T.S's ex-girlfriend's dad's game show, Truth or Date. T.S believes that his ex's father forced her to dump him (being as head strong as he is) and decides to try to sabotage the show...somehow. So, he uses two henchmen...Jay and Silent Bob, who now reside in front of the mall's pet store. Now with them trying to destroy the stage before showtime, T.S and Brodie try to get their ex's back, and after a quick visit to the local topless fortune teller (which turns out to be as funny as it is nasty and repulsive) he gets a great plan for winning her back.
  The only problem is that T.S has to face her father, who had already tried to get them arrested by planting some weed on them. As for Brodie, he has to face his ex's new boy-toy, who's in it only so that he can get some action *in a very uncomfortable place* as he puts it.
  The whole movie has but a few laughs, which involve chocolate covered pretzels, (the already mentioned) topless fortune teller, Jay and Silent Bob, and the Truth or Date gameshow being filemed live.
  I rented this movie with very high spirits, hoping it would be funny, as are all of Smith's movies, but it turned out to be one wash after another. In fact, the only real thing of comedy in this movie were the antics of Jay and Silent Bob which include trying to destroy the stage, getting stoned (at one point, TS gathers a plan, and asks Jay, You guys up for getting stoned, to which Jay replies with a laugh, Look who you're askin,) beating up the Easter Bunny, and a lot, lot more. It was especially nice to have them in the movie THAT much after only being featured in Clerks for a few brief scenes.
  There are tons of hit and miss jokes, among which, the backseat of a volkswagon being the longest.
  The stupid sound effects during the movie add nothing but a corniness that isn' common for any Smith movie (unless it is meant to be.)
  Actually, the movie was really entertaining, not as funny as Clerks, I must say, but it has that Smoth charm that kept me rewinding that tape. There are just some movies that are supposed to be funny, but actually aren't, but that doesn't take away from their entertaining qualities... look at Bill and Ted, for example.
  The movie works, overall, but is still heavily flawed, and lacks that sophisticated humor that made Clerks what it is today. Many find this movie to be boring, and I can see where they're coming from, and some say it's the best of the Jersey Trilogy, and I can get that too, but as for me, it was a pretty deacent movie. Not as man laughs, but it does entertain to some degree.
  Personally, I reccomend the othe movies first, save this for last. Or, actually, you should watch this movie second (in order, sense Kevin's movies are designed in such a way that if you watch them out of order you won't be able to understand them, because you need the other movies for the basis for many of the othe movie's plots or jokes) after Clerks, with the though that this is his worst, and if you love it, then you're bound to love his others, but if you don't, then at least you know that you've seen the worst, and it's smooth sailing from then on.",1041552000,,3436,4.3421875

I know the end product isn't what Smith really wanted, but it probably wouldn't have been much better or worse anyway.  Clerks was hard to top, and it seems like Smith was kinda pressured or rushed to do this.  I certainly don't want to cut down Kevin Smith(and this review will probably sound like that), he's one of the best newcomers of the last decade if you ask me.  To me, this movie is just okay.  Some of the dialogue, acting and humor are just so God-awful it's mind boggling.  On the other hand, there are some extremely funny moments.  So, ultimately it evens out as okay to me.  As I mentioned before, this movie has some rotten dialogue.  The whole food court arguement is extremely lame.  Jeremy London's role is there because it has to be.  He's not that good and comes across as a schmuck.  Jason Lee is pretty funny, but his whining gets pretty annoying.  ""No libido to attack??""  ""Boy Wonder??""  ""Are you nuts??""  Kevin Smith also has a nasty habit of showing us how many fancy words he knows, and all of his characters(even Jay!) sound like they all have English degrees.  We all know that no one talks like that(not even Smith I bet).  It's alright to throw some of that out, but he goes overboard with it.  There are also reoccurances of jokes that just aren't funny no matter how much they're pounded into the ground like:  The Volkswagen crap, the kid on the escalator, Slient Bob crashing the changing rooms.  Plus, Jay and Bob are made into cartoon characters this time instead of the scummy drug dealing slackers they were in Clerks.

Kevin Smith said the studio wanted an 90's ""meat-balls"" but smarter. I think that's pretty close to what they got.
This is also the first Kevin Smith movie that Jason Lee appears in. His performance as Brody, T.S.'s comic book loving side-kick is probably his best to date.

747345,3,6303964745,"I think everyone that grew up in a mall-containing town can remember a phase in their life when they were a mall-rat.  Kevin Smith, the writer-director of this picture, obviously remembers the experience well and has written this amusing film about the phenomenon.  The plot: two guys (T.S. and Brodie) have just broken up with their girlfriends.  To ease the pain, they decide to take a cruise through the mall.  A series of mishaps and adventures ensue, culminating with the two of them as contestants on a Dating Game-style TV game show.
This is the 2nd in the Jay and Silent Bob series.  Here our favourite drug-dealing anarchists are trying to disrupt the game show, first by trying to knock down the set and then by giving drugs to the original contestants.  The film is not a sequel to Clerks, and in fact some of the actors in Clerks (notably Brian O'Halloran, THE clerk in Clerks) are in this film as different characters.  However, it is in the same spirit as the earlier film, with numerous pop-culture references (to comics, Star Wars, and TV shows), foul language, and slacker characters.
Overall, the film is probably as good as Clerks, but without being as fresh.  The production is obviously slicker - it looks and sounds much better.  There is more plot here, and less ""random"" dialogue, but that's not a good thing.  The best parts in Clerks were the verbal wordplay between Dante and Randal.  Here, there are fewer moments of genuine truth to underscore the dialogue, and it feels a bit like Clerks without a soul.  Therefore, I rate it 1 star below Clerks (out of 5).
This DVD is a great buy.  It's jam-packed with nifty extras, the most important being a huge number of cut scenes.  There was an entire subplot excised from the theatrical cut, and it's neat to see it re-created in the cut scenes.  The commentary is quite good with lots of tidbits on actors, and some funny jokes as well.  Having said that, I found this DVD the most irritating disc I've ever tried to navigate!

Having a studio exec on set whispering in Kevin's ear ""you can't do that!"" every time something funny was shot almost ruined the movie.  Personally. Mallrats is a little bit funnier than Clerks (although not as original), and much funnier than Chasing Amy or Dogma.  The only View Askew film that is funnier is Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  If you liked the humor in Clerks, give Mallrats a go.  Jason Lee is pure comic genious (Funniest and most quotable actor in all of Smith's films) and only has a better performance in Almost Famous than in any of Smith's movies.",1035763200,,730,4.458646616541353
747391,3,6303964745,"I guess it's fair to say that Kevin Smith had a sophomore slump with ""Mallrats"".  Let's be fair to the guy:  following up ""Clerks"" was a tall order.  When I was 19, I would have given this movie 5 stars, but as time and (hopefully!) maturity have set in, I feel I can give a better assessment.
Parts of this movie are brilliant:  Jason Lee's performance during the ""Truth or Date"" game show at the mall, the frustrated guy perpetually staring at the eye puzzle, the videotape of Ben Affleck and a 15 year old sexologist, ""stinkpalming"", and (of course) Jay & Silent Bob.  Some of Smith's best material can be found here and ""Mallrats"" certainly didn't deserve the harsh criticism first leveled at it in 1995.  Smith was setting out to make a cheesy 1980s-style teen flick and he succeeded.
Unfortunately, other parts of the movie fall flat.  The ""back seat of a Volkswagen"" joke is still lame no matter how many times you tell it.  There is no on-screen chemistry between Jason Lee & Shannen Doherty (you certainly don't root for them to get back together during the course of the flick), and the whole set-up for Jeremy London & Claire Forlani's break-up and (inevitable) make up is ham-fisted and just doesn't make any sense.  The dialogue is too wordy (NO ONE talks like these characters in real life).  Finally, ""Mallrats"" lacks the rich cast that made ""Clerks"" a classic.
The DVD itself comes equipped with more stuff than you'd ever want (or need) to know about the making of the film.  It contains over an hour of outtakes (most of which--including the film's original introduction--are so bad you realize why they were never included in the final cut), plus an interesting and informative audio/visual commentary from Kevin Smith & Co.  You get to learn all the screw-ups on set, that the movie was filmed outside of Minneapolis (not in New Jersey), how the movie studio nearly cut Jason Mewes out of the picture (which clearly would have been a disastrous move) and Ben Affleck's undying love of himself.
I would recommend ""Mallrats"" to die-hard Kevin Smith fans only, while casual fans should stick to ""Clerks"", ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Dogma"".",1035676800,,2148,4.744623655913978

It was clever, original and relaxed, allowing its comedy to roll on its own, never keeping it within boundaries, but always keeping comprehensible. The result? A terribly silly storyline, unneccesary plot diversions and a cast of undeniably memorable characters. This movie does not appear to be very special on the outside, but once you get down to it, every tiny detail is thought out and planned beautifully. Jason Lee's Brodie was the highlight of the movie, even managing to leave the usually over-poweringly special Jay and Silent Bob behind in the laugh-o-meter.

And it is pretty good, though the weakest of his movies. It is loaded with the dialogue that Kevin Smith is good at writing and has strong performances by Jason Lee and Jeremy London. Jay and Silent Bob have larger roles in this film than they did in clerks, and there is a cameo appearance by Stan Lee. Ben Affleck's performance is weak. It loses a little bit at the ending, but it's still a film that I like. I don't think it is for everyone, but if you like Smith's films, and haven't seen this one yet, you definitely need to.
Like Clerks, this is a strong dvd. The commentary track contains Kevin Smith, Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Ben Affleck (though his role in the film is so small, I don't understand why he was brought in for commentary), Scott Mosier (producer), and Vincent Pereira. This is a better commentary track than that on Clerks. There's an hour of deleted scenes, introduced by Kevin Smith, a video, and a few trailers and featurettes.

747470,5,6303964745,"MALLRATS is a failure by Kevin Smith. While a funny movie, it fails to be a good movie.
MALLRATS is a studio picture, and you can tell. It's dumbed down and many parts are quite stupid. I could have done without the topless psychic scene.
Jeremy London was terrible in this movie. Absolutely terrible. Perhaps the worst actor in the entire New Jersey 'Trilogy'. No wonder his part was knocked down from lead to sidekick.
However, Jason Lee is brilliant as Brodie Bruce. He has a certain charisma and he's always reminded me of Chevy Chase and Bruce Campbell. Two different styles of acting brought together in one actor.
Jay and Silent Bob return, but this time as a pair of live-action cartoon characters. Their parts are funny, but purely slapstick. While I love slapstick (The Three Stooges are my favorites), it felt out of place in a Kevin Smith movie...
This film seems to be a John Hughes homage, and on that wavelength, it's a success. It felt very much like one, except for the mustache... Er... language...
The DVD is one of the best in my 38 DVD collection. The commentary by Smith, Chasing Amy's Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, Scott Mosier, Vincent Pereira, and Jay Mewes is better than the movie itself. They mock it horribly...
The deleted scenes are one hour long, and feature a twenty minute alternate ending... And it's really no wonder why it was cut...
There's a very funny video featuring Jay and Bob in it.
There's an interesting documentary about the making of Mallrats.
And there's the trailer. My God, how terribly it was marketed. No wonder it bombed.

The storyline is hilarious, and with wit and intelligence throughout, it is completely tolerable to even the most adamant anti-silliness movie-goer.  Their mishaps in love and in the mall may not be all that realistic, but if you take just a moment to think about it, you'll realize that they're not really SUPPOSED to be.. it's just supposed to be funny.  (However, in Chasing Amy, everything is supposed to be realistic, and although there is humor, the storyline is to be taken seriously. You'll have a pretty hard time relating to the promiscuous, carefree lead in Chasing Amy, but it probably won't be that hard to picture yourself getting dumped and loafing around at the mall later that day, as in Mallrats.)  Continue watching Mallrats and you'll be dealt the cards of wonderful perfomances from Shannen Doherty and Ben Affleck, hilarious comebacks, awesome quotes, a rapidly moving storyline, and awesome work from Jay and Silent Bob in aiding T.S. and Brodie's plea for their ex-girlfriends to be their girlfriends again. Don't forget random insertion of various actors from Kevin Smith's ""family"" at View Askew. This movie is hilarious, hilarious, hilarious, and it comes highly recommended.

Its not that its just totally bad and you shouldn't give it the 1 hr and 36 mins to watch even the video version, but compared to Smith's other films Mallrats is the one that seems so out of place. Perhaps that is because this was only his second movie, but Clerks was his first and it is by far better than Mallrats. Mallrats, I believe, was Smith's first shot at a slap stick comdey, unlike any other film he wrote or directed besides Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back which came years after Mallrats. The movie starts out as friends Brodie and T.S. both get dumped by their girlfriends on the same day, but for different reasons. Brodie because he's a comic book reading, no job having, sega obessed loser who slips his girlfriend in his bedroom window at night and makes her get up and leave in the morning so his mom, who he lives with at over 25 something years of age, won't know she was there...'cause he hasn't told his mom about his girlfriend!!! T.S. is a bit better, but not by much. Under some kind of freak circumstances he indirectly caused the star of his girlfriends father's love connection like TV show not to appear on the show anymore...causing his girlfriend to have to take the girls place when they had plans to go on vacation, where T.S. was planning on proposing.

This is the second in a series of Kevin Smith films (1st ""Clerks"" - 2nd ""Mallrats"" - 3rd ""Chasing Amy"" - 4th ""Dogma"" - 5th ""Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back"" and hopefully many many more....).Funny storyline & great acting from Jason Lee,Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty, Joey Lauren Adams & last of all the comedy pair Jason Mewes & Kevin Smith as Jay & Silent Bob - got romance & action, there's a little bit for everyone. Got some great characters like ""Jay & Silent Bob"" who star in all the Kevin Smith films.
This film definitely get my 2 thumbs up (A**).
I've only got the british version that hasn't got all the extras - so I'd definitely get this version with Deleted scenes, Making of & much more.

I love how he uses so many one-liners from other movies.  The story is a trip.  This movie is not suppose to be serious so why would anyone take it that way?  On the Collectors Edition DVD Kevin Smith and members of the cast have a roast session during the commentary track.  I think it is almost as funny as the actual film.  However I am a little miffed as well.  I think this movie is great, but most of the principals don't seem to think so.  That is too bad.  Kevin, you did great, live with it.
Bottom line, see Mallrats.  Yes, it is primarily adolescent humor, but it is clever adolescent humor.  This my favorite of Kevin Smith's films, but Chasing Amy and Clerks are also worth seeing.  Snoogums.",1014336000,3,1673,4.485049833887043

Brodie is an obsessive comic collector. He lives and breathes Superman and other famous comic characters. His life starts to go down hill after his girlfriend breaks up with him. Jason Lee is hilarious and he's an actor who can mould to so many characters. Brodie is quite cheeky and humourous and that kind of personality suits Lee down to the ground. He can pull it off with style.
T.S is Brodie's best mate and he also falls single after a breakup with his girlfriend. Jeremy London has a guy next door look about him and he has definately applied it to T.S and his personality.
Renee is Brodie's girlfriend/Ex to be. She has had enough playing 2nd best in Brodie's life. Shannen Doherty is perfect for this role. She gives Renee a girl power exterior.
Jay and Silent Bob - Kevin Smiths master creations. They make trouble wherever possible and are always on the look out for more killer ideas. Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith are Jay and Silent Bob - they are great!
Brandy - the former girlfriend of T.S. She is the perfect picture of innocence and soon to be contestant on her fathers game show. Claire Forlani plays the innocence of Brandy well because she has that girl next door look and she brings a lot of hidden qualities to Brandy.
Somehow all these people and more end up in the mall. Cue the outrageous goings on and havoc breaking out everywhere. Will T.S and Brodie get their loved ones back? or will their plans hit them right in the face?
Will Brandy go on her fathers show and go off with another guy?
Will Jay and Silent Bob find something constructive to do aside from causing trouble?

747701,4,6303964745,"kevin smith is probably one of the most interesting directors we currently have gracing the silver screen with his amazing presence, not just as a comic genius, but as an understated comic actor as well. his first film, ""clerks"" was an extremely sophisticated freshman effort that was masked in a sea of film references (ranging from ""star wars"" to ""jaws"") and post-pubescent perverted humor. the characters in the film talked about sex and films as though they were in the same ballpark, let alone the same sport, and in ""mallrats"" we get more of that, on a higher budget, made with a studio, and that is where it slightly suffers: the studio's hand in making the film (more like controlling the film) is evident. while smith's comic touch is the silver cloud, the co-producers that oversaw uber-producer scott mosier, are the dark lining. kevin smith was never meant to make a movie like this, and the fact that he was able to pull of a sort of action-comedy with special effects and stunts, and still manage to keep his characters with their brilliantly written dialogue at the center of the camera's attention says a lot for smith as a filmmaker. ""mallrats"" is terrific entertainment, and while it pales next to ""clerks"" and ""dogma,"" it still stands proudly as an addition to the ""jersey"" films. it's a lot of fun.
the real landmark that takes place in the film, aside from smith's dialogue of course, is jason lee in his first movie. lee quickly became one of my favorite actors after i saw his fantastic performance in this, and i was one of the people who felt the most jipped when his performances in ""chasing amy"" and ""almost famous"" weren't noticed by the academy. of course, this is the same academy that gave a best actor oscar to russell crowe and never gave one to stanley kubrick. go figure... anyway, steering clear of my personal loathing for the academy of motion picture arts and sciences *cough*jagoffs*cough*, it is jason lee's skillful delivery of smith's dialogue that keeps this movie together; that and jay and silent bob, of course. and who can forget that hysterical drop to the floor when joey lauren adams blasts jeremy london's manhood? i still laugh after... okay, so i can't keep track of the numerous times i've seen all of kevin smith's movies, you know you can't either.
bottom line: ""mallrats"" is one of the better comedies of the last ten to twenty years. after a series of completely not funny post-""scream"" films that have come out, it's refreshing to go back in your video/dvd collection and take another gander at ""mallrats."" it's not as intelligent as smith can be, but then again, what studio film is as intelligent as kevin smith? go watch ""clerks"" and then pop in ""dude, where's my car?"" and you'll be bowing in admiration like i am.
dvd footnote: while the commentary and interactive menus are a lot of fun, the deleted scenes, while they come in abundance, are not that good. for great deleted scenes, look to the ""dogma: special edition"" dvd and the ""chasing amy"" dvd for it's outtakes as well as deleted scenes.",1004745600,2,3060,4.7322097378277155

This is the most vacuous of the Kevin Smith movies I think.  It was made with way too much money and felt like a bad remake of an 80s movie at times.  There is just too much effort to make it palatable to the mainstream, which is the corporate machine messing with the talent of Kevin Smith.  But anyway....
I think the best part of this movie is Brodie (Jason Lee) and his shamelessly aggressive mannerisms at which he confronts his problems, often with radical consequences (you'd have to see the movie to understand what I mean).  Plus there is the whole Easter and Easter Bunny scenario, which is EXTREMELY dangerous in terms of laughability.  ""The Easter Bunny has been here since two days after Christmas!""  Now who won't be able to snicker in concurrence with that fact of consumerism and holiday obsession?  Of course the BIG Easter-related laugh is a surprise!
There is quite a bit of crude and crass humor in certain spots in this movie; this may be one area where MALLRATS is ahead of its time.  Movies like SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and AMERICAN PIE are commonly seen as THE modern gross-out films.
While not nearly as moving as Smith's other gems, MALLRATS is nonetheless a great laugh if you're stuck in your teenage mentality.",1003881600,,1271,4.6177777777777775

747706,5,6303964745,"Mallrats was actually my introduction into the world of ""Kevin Smith"".  Flicking through cable channels one day, I stumbled across this flick and have been a devoted fan ever since!
Since becoming more knowledgable in Kevin Smith films, To this day I cannot see why this film did so badly and how people can sit there and blast it.
As most people agree, the dialogue plays a decent part on why Smith films are so fantastic and fun, and this was the first thing that grabbed my attention.  As mentioned, when I stumbled across Mallrats on Cable, it was almost the end of the film at the Game Show segment.  To have a chick insinuating having sex as a question, and having Brodie (God bless Jason Lee!) scream out ""Oh, you mean like...!"", I was hooked.  Thankfully, as cable is infamous for doing, Mallrats got multiple re-runs and the next day I caught the flick in full.
Onto the DVD Itself, any DVD of a great film such as Mallrats deserves purchasing.  I mean, there is no other way, bar stealing a film reel yourself, to get the fantastic picture quality and sound, and more importantly, which you can't get too many places, BONUS FEATURES!  And for this DVD to be advertised as having ""Over 1 hour of Deleted Scenes"", it makes any fan salivate from the mouth.  Whilst I know many film purists who state ""Deleted Scenes are deleted for a reason"" (!), any true fan of a film wants to see scenes that the director intended to include but was prevented from doing so due to film politics, irritating production companies or simply time management.
The real gem on this disc however has to be the Audio Commentary.  By the way, this was the first Audio Commentary I ever viewed with ""Video Hijinks""; IE:  when the mallrats logo appears, press the select button on your remote to change the screen to a 'live' shot of the guys in the Audio Commentary booth interacting with each other.  It was great to see all the guys together.  Smith, Mewes, good ol' Ben Affleck (Who by the time I saw Mallrats had become 'all that and a bag of potato chips' through his post-Mallrats flicks), as well as ""Chasing Amy's Jason Lee"" (A referral poor old J.L. will probably take to the grave) all work great together, feeding of what each other says to make a very intertaining and worthwhile DVD.  In fact, People I know that HATE Mallrats (I can't see how the could) have bought the DVD primarily for the Commentaries and Extra Features.  One mate I know only liked Clerks and Chasing Amy, but owns every Kevin Smith DVD on the market!
Another Gem has to be the ""Easter Egg"" on the Mallrats DVD.  For those DVD-Illiterate people out there, an Easter Egg is a 'hidden bonus' but in most cases, these aren't hidden very well.  To access it, move your cursor onto the Robot's Eyes at the Mallrats Menu and press select (It is either the Main Menu or the Bonus Features Menu).  Rather humerous little addition by Kevin Smith.  (However, no Kevin Smith inserts come close to the great one he did for the Criterion Chasing Amy Disc).

The critics hated it, but I would argue that their generation wouldn't have got it in the first place. It is a movie for those who remember the postcards with the ""hidden pictures"", the Sega revolution and being a juvenile delinquent - this is truly a classic.
As for the movie itself, it sees JT (Party of Five) attempting to win back the love of his life, with the help of his over the top, comic obsessed brother. Shannon Doherty and Ben Affleck are among the supporting cast, with Stan Lee even making an appearance.
As in Clerks (the first movie in the series), Kevin Smith plays ""Silent Bob"", who with ""Snootchie Bootchies"" Jay, manages to mix a good dose of slapstick into proceedings. There is even a visit from Dante Hicks brother, for those who are really seeking a continuation in story line!
This movie is for those that want to listen to our generation expounding on all manner of theories, none that matter in the slightest.

747752,4,6303964745,"""Mallrats"" was not designed to be taken seriously.  And frankly, neither was ""Clerks"".  That movie only was in the end because of what it said about indie cinema.  ""Mallrats"" got caught in this particularly pretentious wake, and nearly drowned because of it.  And don't get me wrong, ""Mallrats"" is not ""Citizen Kane"".  But it's not ""Howard the Duck"" either.  It's really nothing more than a big, dumb, John Hughes-inspired mall movie.  It's an excuse to ape the Dark Knight and tell tales of Superman, practice your Jedi mind tricks, and discuss in intimate detail the finer points of mall aesthetics.  But most of all, it's a tale of love lost in suburbia, where comic books are the religion of choice, and the mall is a suitable place of worship.
Given the ""confines"" of a bigger budget, writer/director Kevin Smith doesn't go overboard with bombastic special effects and overbloated casting, but the intimacy he had going in ""Clerks"" is certainly lost.  His mall is a rather giant setting (especially when compared to the intimacy of ""Clerks"" locations).  It's only advantage is that it provides Smith an opportunity to come up with some ridiculous store names (watch for the ""Buy Me Toys"" toy store, a carpet outlet called ""Rug Munchers"", and a fashionable male clothing store called ""Fashionable Male"").  Things do get a tad out of hand at points.  But when he has to focus on character instead of action, Smith shines like a newly polished penny.  Hopeless slacker Brody Bruce (Jason Lee) is a wonderful creation, a motormouth for the ages whose passions nearly get the best of him (his girlfriend breaks up with him over his insistence on finishing a game of Sega hockey), but they're the best thing for this movie.  Lee dominates the flick in his first major role.  This kid is a true talent.  He's ably supported by Smith's equivalent of a Greek chorus, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself).  These two get substantially more screentime and plot relevance than they did in ""Clerks"", and the boys run with it winningly.
If anyone should take the blame for the supposed failures of ""Mallrats"" it's the casting director.  Two dubious choices are made that nearly sink the film.  The first is casting Jeremy London in what is ostensibly the film's leading male role.  Maybe they thought they were casting his twin brother Jason, who carried ""Dazed and Confused"".  Unfortunately, Jeremy is one of the stiffer actors out there.  He has no aptitude for making Smith's flowery language seem real (especially when compared to Lee, who is a master at this trick).  This make's him seem like a poseur; not a great character trait for your romantic leading man.  The second casting mistake is allowing Shannen Doherty anywhere near the picture.  Maybe this is hindsight talking, but her raving bitch persona, so delicately nurtured on ""90210"", is distracting in a role that's supposed to be strong but sweet and loyal.  And she has no more success dealing with Smith's lines than London has.  As far as I can tell, she's only valuable in that she provides an opportunity for a neat one-word joke (""Brenda?""), but that's not nearly valuable enough.  Thankfully, she doesn't get all that much screen time.
""Mallrats"" is definitely the weakest entry in Smith's growing canon.  It lacks the weight of any of his other pictures.  But I am more than willing to forgive Smith for his mistakes, because the film is just too much damn fun.  And without the ""failure"" of ""Mallrats"", would Smith ever been able to achieve the humility of ""Chasing Amy""?  Allow the director his one mistake, and let him grow from there.",998179200,,3616,4.848287112561175

747756,4,6303964745,"""Mallrats"" comes from the comic genius of Kevin Smith, who brought us the completely original ""Clerks"". ""Mallrats"" failed in theaters, but after watching the film, there seems to be almost no reason why. It combines witty dialogue with funny situations and all in the place where teenagers flock to on weekends to escape the outside world for a little while.
Smith concludes that the reason that the film failed was due to marketing. The poster was great but if you didn't know anything about it, then you would think: ""O.K., there aren't any known actors, I don't really know anything about it, I'm not seeing it."" He calls the T.V. spots weak and basically blames it all on Gramercy, who he says couldn't market themselves out of a paper bag.
I totally understand his point of view. This movie is a great follow up to ""Clerks"" and really had no reason to fail. It did have a large act to follow, but it did a stand up job.
""Mallrats"" opens with a spectacular display of comic book covers based on the characters in the film. We are then introduced to T.S.(Jeremy London) who is planning a Florida vacation with his girlfriend Brandi(Claire Forlani). The only problem is that she can't go. Her father (Michael Rooker) produces a T.V. game show called ""Truth or Date"" and she has to go on as a guest. T.S. is upset and she retaliates by telling him that it is his fault(which it really is).
T.S.' best friend Brodie(Jason Lee) is a serious comic book collector and emphatic video game hockey player. He is having problems with his girlfriend as well. He hardly notices her until he can't have her, when she walks out of his room leaving him to his video game.
T.S. and Brodie retreat to the mall, where the stage for the game show is being erected. They have to stop it from going on, in order for T.S. to get his girlfriend back. In order for them to do that, they have to go to the imfamous duo: Jay and Silent Bob(Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith). Brodie attempts to get his girlfriend Rene(Shannon Doherty) back who has fallen into the arms of the Fashionable Male proprietor Shannon(Ben Affleck).
Meanwhile, Rooker tries to keep his show on schedule. In doing this he attempts to keep T.S. and Brodie away. His stage protector: LaFours, who even has two kills. It is he who Jay and Silent Bob must distract in order to destroy the stage.
Like ""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"" takes place in the span of a day. The characters all speak with perfect English and have long vocabularies. The difference is that in this film, there is more plot and more characters, but they work in this film's favor.
Once again Kevin Smith has created a screen gem that was not appreciated in its own time but really came to be on video. Sure the critics trashed it, but really, critics shmitics.",994723200,4,2765,4.554216867469879

Smith's writing is wonderful. He knows how people talk. The best thing a writer can do is listen, and he obviously does alot of listining. The character of Brodie is one of the funniest ""normal"" characters I have ever seen played, and it's because of the way he talks.
I will agree that Mallrats' plot is rather simple, but I for one found it extreemly funny anyway. It was too outlandish to not laugh at. How many times have you seen a fat man flythrough the air dressed as Batman. not too many I would think. It is slightly stupid, and was ment to be so. Let's remember people that the term ""serious comedy"" is an oxymoron. Comedies do not need deep plots and complex twists. Comedies have one goal: to make you laugh (and I'm sure that even that (...) Lenord Marltin laughed).  One thing I like about movies is if I can tell the cast and crew had a good time making it. A genuinely good time. This is such a film. It is clear onscreen that all the actors were having a blast, and when everyone is happy making a film, the result is a piece of work that everyone put 110% into making.

747758,4,6303964745,"I have never written a review before, but after reading the ones for this movie I decided I had to.  This movie had its flaws, but then again every movie does.  Overall I really enjoyed it.  Let me tell you about the flaws first, then I'll work up to the good stuff.  First off, if you are looking for great acting watch exorcist or something with the exception of Brandon Lee(Brody).  Brandon Lee was very humorous and the less than moral humor kept me rolling in laughter...from the Easter Bunny being assaulted in front of children to a disgusting stink palm.  A wide variety of humor I must say.  I have found that I quote a lot of this movie, around family, around friends, all the time basically.  Comic books (which is part of the storyline) don't thrill me too much, but it fit Brody's style rather well.  Ben Affleck (Shannon) gives our hero a beating because he is trying to win over Renee and he does not want Brody to interfere.  Stan Lee, the supposed comic book king made an appearance and saved a relationship between Brody and Renee played by Shannon Doherty.  Shannon Doherty is only in this movie for about 20 to 30 minutes...in my mind she shouldn't be publicized as one of the main actors.  This movie was well worth buying in my opinion.  Brody, Jay, Silent Bob and the fortune teller cracked me up and will keep bringing me back to watch it over and over and over again.  I hope this review was a bit more helpful than other.  At least watch it once, then make your judgement.",994204800,,1498,4.416058394160584
747759,4,6303964745,"The biggest gripe I have is that Shannen Doherty is the ""star"" of this movie.  She's just a female lead and foil.  Jason Lee rules this picture through sheer force of will.  Jeremy London might as well be the sidekick in this movie.  The rest of the cast is the usual parade of freak-show characters found in Kevin Smith's movies:  Lovable, eccentric and memorable.  But Shannen?  No, sorry... costume changes and knowing smiles do not a film star make.  Leave that to the ""Brodieman"" and accept him as your ringmaster for this circus of commerce and you will be cool with this movie.
What is really intriguing about this DVD is that you get to see how far this script has changed since its first incarnation.  The originally produced version of Mallrats had quite a different feel to it as the Deleted Scenes section shows.  In fact, this baby has over 90 minutes of deleted scenes that are prompted by commentary by Smith that seems to be an apology for the film, or an explanation why it wasn't as good as it could have been.
But come on...are we still talking about The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink this way?  Do we hold those flicks to the same high standards we hold Kevin Smith and View Askew?  Certainly not.  I, for one, got the joke.  I wasn't expecting any deep, philosophical epic to follow ""Clerks"" I was looking for caca and peepee jokes with a wry twist...but in color.  That's what I got along with brief shots of Joey Lauren Adams topless...thank you Kevin.",994118400,,1479,4.528301886792453

Watching Kevin Smith commentaries (on either Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and soon-to-be released Dogma Collectors Edition) is the most entertaining thing since the movie.  It's like watching this movie with your buds.

747923,3,6303964745,"All of Kevin Smith's stuff is a mixed bag, alternating between intensity and goofiness, and this is deservedly his least successful film, probably due to the constraints that came along with big budget.  The edginess is, well, less edgy, and that makes the comedy less effective.
If you didn't like the director's other work (""Clerks"", ""Chasing Amy"", ""Dogma"") you aren't going to like this, either.  And there's some chance that even if you =did= like his other work, you won't like this, but it's not as unredeemable as some make it out.  Yes, Jay and Silent Bob are reduced to keystone cops, but this occasionally provides for some decent humor.  Yes, it does have Shannen Doherty, but she's not as misplaced as you might think. Yes, it comes off as a little contrived, but it still has a lot of the Kevin Smith flair.
In fact, as gross as some of the humor is (though perhaps tame by Farrely Brothers' standards), it's really the absence of what you might call Smith's trademark willingness to look unflinchingly at certain issues that make this more like an ""American Pie"" or similar teen farce (however cleverly the director has woven in cinematic references) than it is like any of his other films.
If you're a Smith fan, this is a must have, just as an accompaniment to ""Chasing Amy"" which takes more than a few shots both at this movie and the critics who gleefully saw this movie as their opportunity to squash Smith.",989539200,,1426,4.669322709163347

Coming off the goliath of ""Clerks"", Kevin Smith was seen as having only the potential to go down, and those who relish in such things were tickled by the colossal failure this film turned into.  In retrospect, there isn't nearly as much wrong with this film as was originally made out; it just happens to be one of the worst-marketed big movies of all time.  The fact that Kevin Smith has more than survived the ""Mallrats"" holocaust is a statement of his quality as a writer and filmmaker.  And now that we can go back and fit this movie into the whole trilogy (which now looks like it's going to be a pentalogy [is that a word or a Pearl Jam album????]), it's a lot better than many thought.
First and foremost is Jason Lee, in a performance that defined his style for the rest of his career.  For those who felt the best thing about ""Almost Famous"" was Stillwater's cantankerous, foulmouthed lead singer, ""Mallrats"" is like going to heaven.  Nuff said.
There's just so much Kevin Smithness crammed into this movie--comics, Sega, genuinely romantic guys, and the glory of living a life where the most important thing to do today is try the new cookies at the cookie stand--they're exquisite.
The DVD is one of the best ""Special Edition""s of any film--TONS of extras, deleted scenes, at least one hilarious Easter egg, and the hallmark of any Kevin Smith DVD: a full-fledged View Askew commentary track with Kevin & the gang.  (""Dogma SE"" DVD----SOON, please, Kevin......SOON!!!!!)  The balance of seriousness this guy devotes to his craft and the complete absurdity he can find in his work is essential to anyone who'd really interested in the creative process of moviemaking.",986947200,,1882,4.681818181818182

Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) make their triumphant return and get the screen time they deserve.  They beat the crap out of the Easter bunny and try to defeat the security guard from hell to wreck the game show that is being staged in the mall.

747930,5,6303964745,"For all of you who didn't like this movie the DVD commentary by Kevin Smith explains why the movie fell short of many ideals. First off the label didn't want this movie to be anything more than ""the thinking man's Porky's"", in other words a ""teen titty flick"". While there is quite the scene of that in here its R-rating comes from the intense language used, but as far as real life goes there's so much of that strong language in that age bracket that it was more of a documentary and less of a movie. Too bad they didn't get to keep the original story involving the attmepted assasination of the governor by a minuteman with the ensuing gunfight(see the DVD extras for that).
In my opinion the best part of this movie is its dialogue. Especially the dialogue of Jason Lee who seems to be the star of the movie aside the better-known names of Ben Affleck and Shannon Dougherty. A lot of Lee's banter needs to be heard again and again to appreciate it. Of course what Kevin Smith movie would be without Jay and Silent Bob? They make their appearance here in some comic relief scenes (as if the rest of the movie isn't comic enough). Who can do without Jay and his own use of the English language? Snoogins...
The only weak link to the movie is Jeremy London (or was it Jason London?). His acting seems to fall very flat and my favorite scene with him is when he gets kicked in the crotch by Joey Lauren Adams. Now that's comedy! The deleted Minuteman scene was better acting for him so I wonder if he just got jaded by his best scene being deleted that he carries that feeling throughout the movie, but I'm thinking not.

747932,3,6303964745,"Weird beast, this film.  While it still has it's moments of genuinely funny comedy, there's a few things that probably should have been changed.
Most anybody will admit that 'Clerks' was Kevin Smith's masterpiece; the little film that could.  And it was funny, new, and most of all, fresh.  'Chasing Amy' is a more mature film, equally funny in some parts, well-edited, and certainly well worth owning.  But 'Mallrats' falls between the two in many ways.
First off, it's not as funny, and a big reason for this is the silliness of the script--'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' didn't need to be updated.  Another, is that there is basically no chemistry between Jason Lee and Jeremy London; London is likeable enough, but he's just not interesting.  And Lee's delivery is made much funnier in 'Chasing Amy'; in this film, he's pretty much the only thing worth watching.
It's decent enough fluff as a rainy-night rental, and it's better than the mediocrity that was 'Dogma', but it's far from essential.",985219200,,999,4.881656804733728

Panned by critics, loved by hard-core Askewheads, Mallrats is disappointing on many levels (it abandons the most intelligent aspects of Clerks and misses the polish that came in with Chasing Amy), but it's probably Smith's most amusing and lighthearted movie, and definitely the best introduction for someone unfamiliar with Smith (they're still out there!).  In addition, the commentary on this DVD reveals Smith's limitations by Gramercy (they wanted the ""intelligent Porky's"" marketability). Typical sophomore slump stuff.  Good way to see early Ben Affleck as the alpha-male Shannon, and early Jason Lee as well.  Worth the money.

Guys lose girls, guys go to ridiculous ends to get girls back.  But this isn't John Hughes here, folks.  Somewhere between the raunchy jokes of Clerks and the tragicomic of Chasing Amy.

Looking back Mallrats was very simple, but ultimately original comedy. I think the reason this was not a critics darling, whilst writer/director/actor Kevin Smith's other films are extolled by every critic on the roll call, is because this one didn't have a point to make. It pretty much repeated the points made in ""Clerks.""  Points in which stated that the characters needed to find the drive to change their station in life. Only in this case they do so, just to get their girlfriends back. Once again Smith employs his usual aggressive wit, which now in this case discusses the coital ability of Superman all the way to the difference between the food-court stores and autonomuos units for mid-mall snacking. But the only reason I'm deducting points because of the simplicity upon the comparison to Smith's other outing. Outings that had a driving force aided by a sly smart script. In this case, it's a simple premise aided by a sly, smart script with an excellent cast list, With the exception of Jeremy London who gave a totally annoying performance. Points would be deducted  but fortunately he supplies the foundation to the enjoyably well-timed performance of Jason Lee. His debut performance as Brodie is a comedic dynamo which is only upstaged by Smiths immortal characters Jay and Silent Bob, whose scenes are humorously cartoony which will stay with me forever. This DVD has stuff that can only be viewed and enjoyed in this format. Ranging from deleted scenes to a wildly funny commentary from most of the main cast. This film was Kevin Smith's commercial experiment. Too see how a studio film would be handled under his wing. There's nothing wrong with that.

It is by far the funniest movie of the bunch, the plot is silly but fun and the ending is pretty satisfying (can't say that for ""Chasing Amy"", Smith's most praised film).  ""Mallrats"" also introduced us to a fine young talent in Jason Lee, who absolutely steals this movie as Brodie Bruce, the ultimate slacker.  I found myself laughing even before he opened his mouth because I knew he was going to say something funny.
Silent Bob (played by Smith) and Jay (Jason Mewes) also have some very funny scenes in this movie, although their showing in Smith's ""Dogma"" was a little more entertaining.  I also thought Ben Affleck was a good choice for the coniving manager of the ""Fashionable Male"" who tries to woo Brodie's ex-girlfriend, Rene (Shannen Doherty).
Smith has said that if he were to have to do it over again, he would not have cast Jeremy London as Brodie's sidekick, T.S. (or is Brodie T.S.'s sidekick?), but actually he is fine in the straight man role.  Sure, he's a lousy actor, but if you're looking for Oscar winning performances, Kevin Smith films aren't for you anyway.

Lee is simply brilliant, no one can deliver a line quite like him.

Jason Lee (Almost Famous, Chasing Amy) blows away everyone in this flick (except Jay and his hetero life mate, Silent Bob, nootch.)

I remember seeing  an ad a long time ago but it seemed like cheese at the time and the name Mallrats turns off a certain demographic (me) that's why I didn't remember it. But I just let loose one day and decided on the recommendation of a friend to view. All I have to say is stinkpalm- this movie rules. IMPORTANT NOTE: If your older than 35 you may not like this movie.

the fact that the movie came so ordinary as every other 80's high school comedy and has nothing new ,, the same old joke's the same old way so typical some time's boring beside it's not as deep as other Kevin Smith movie's , i saw clerks 100's of time's but mallrat's , i only see it every there and then and even skip some parts of it

Where did the director and writter Kevin Smith leave the story, as well as his head, when he came up with the idea of Mall Rats.
The scene in which the two lamo's see the fortune teller and she tell's their future buy reading her third breast says it all.  It's not funny at all, no story and no acting whatsoever.  And for all you people who think Kevin Smith is some sort of a Movie God, get real!

748197,4,6303964745,"My take on Mallrats it's that it is pretty obsessive (comics & girls  & malls) with a lot of intelligent lowbrow dialogue. I don't think that  it's a Brat Pack movie, it's more of a classic screwball comedy. And the  separate plotlines are constructed pretty well and come together at the  end. Chasing Amy looks like it was shot for ten thousand bucks, too. Oh,  sure there's a lot of sophmoric humor in Mallrats, but Stripes, Caddyshack,  Animal House, and every Rodney Dangerfield movie mine that load for laughs.  I thought Porky's and others movies of its ilk such as all the Police  Academy movies go for the lowest common denominator (i.e., 13-year-old  boys). I saw Mallrats when it first came out in the theaters, it's more  upscale and has wittier dialogue than Clerks, but Clerks is still funny -  just like Fawlty Towers is neurotically hysterical to this day. I guess  that Mallrats was Kevin Smith's debut film - studio-produced, but the  studio was lamebrained in not promoting the flick, and therefor it bombed  at the box office, and of course the critics followed suit in lockstep with  giving tepid to brutal reviews.
Mallrats has better dialogue than 90% of  Hollywood's movies in the 70's, the 80's, and the 90's. Kevin Smith is New  Jersey's Woody Allen, but he's more down-to-earth and not prone to having a  romantic relationship with Mia Farrow's adopted children.",968716800,2,1389,4.8382978723404255

Jason  Mewes and Kevin Smith are great as the two burn-outs Jay and Silent  Bob,Jason Lee is excellent (in this as well as in Chasing Amy and Dogma),  and at this time Joey Lauren Adams is one of my favourite actresses(just  wait till she finds that elusive big break).

748297,5,6303964745,"As writer/director Kevin Smith said in his booklet for the Chasing Amy DVD, ""Clerks"" was overpraised and ""Mallrats"" was  overbashed.
This movie follows along in the classical steps of such 80's  movies such as ""Screwballs"", ""Porky's"", and ""The  Invisible Kid"". In fact, one of its best descriptions is that it is a  smart ""Porky's"".
In ""Mallrats"", Kevin once again  revisits the Tri-town area of New Jersey, as every other moive in the View  Askewniverse.  The two unlikely heroes, Brodie and T.S. Quint (a shameless,  yet clever plug for one of Kevin's favorite movie, ""Jaws"") have  both been dumped by their girlfriends.  And only in the mall can they find  solace and comfort.
Brodie and T.S. run into all sorts of characters,  including Jay and Silent Bob.  Throughout the whole day, the try to find  ways to get their girlfriends back. And in true 80's fashion, the guys get  the girls and some breasts are shown.  Not too bad for a movie that flopped  in the box office.

As usual, the  dialogue is sharp and raw. It stars the excellent acting talent of Jeremy  London (just kidding), Shannon Doherty, the amazing and brilliant Jason  Lee, Claire Forani, Michael Rooker, and the always great Ben Affleck.
Absoluetly hilarious if you like ridiculousness equal (but different) to  that of Monty Python, and wit equal (but again, very different) to that of  Geoege Cuckor (I don't reccomend Cuckor or Monty Python to anybody who  likes this and isn't as flexible as me) .

The text?  Why comic books, of  course.
The entire movie is straight out of the pages of a Stan Lee comic  book: colorful characters with strange quirks, mad-cap action, slapstick,  one-liners, and, most of all, a little female frontal nudity.
So many  have completely written this movie off because of its unrealistic portrayal  of life in suburban America, but so what?  Suburban America is boring-  that's why so many kids turned to comic books in the first place!
So my  final thoughts about this movie?  It certainly is not a Casablanca or a  Citizen Kane by any means, but it's eye candy, and meant for that suburban  kid who spent most of his/her adolesence amidst the piles of comic books in  their local mall's comic shop, searching for the new Stan Lee trade  paperback which features different characters in varying silver foil  covers.",963792000,,1087,4.826086956521739

This DVD was made to try to get some revenue for this film that was a box-office flop and  this DVD does that. A cult classic that is very well done in DVD. The  'making of' featurette is very good and explains well why the film was as  it is; it was a studio film. The featurette gives a disclaimer in the  beginning stating that the views were not studio views, so you get the  idea. The commentary was excellent giving some extra tidbits about the  filming from a bunch of people. Unlike in the 'Chasing Amy' commentary they  don't talk over each other too much. There's also a feature to open a  window so the commentators can be seen at times, which was a nice touch.  The deleted scenes all refer to a different opening sequence that was  deleted and changed after a poor test screening. It was felt that the  original opening was too slow. I'd agree, but there is some very funny  dialogue that was deleted because they only made sense with the original  opening. Also, some scenes and dialogue that was left in made more since  with the original opening. The director gives commentary on the deleted  scenes too. The now standard production photos, cast/crew biographies,  subtitles and trailer are included.

The low production values and meandering plotlines  serve, in a weird way, to create a reco gnizable version of our own  mundane, yet surreal lives on the big screen.

 On its own, it has much to recommend it. It is quite  funny in parts. Jay & Silent Bob shine in this film, a lot more than in  Clerks or Chasing Amy (but not as much as Dogma).

748529,4,6303964745,"First of all, this is a very good film.  Its not as funny or original as Clerks, but still good enough to warrant a cult following.
For me, the most fascinating aspect of the film was seeing Jason Lee acting for the  first time.  Unless you weren't aware of it, Jason Lee was a very prominent  professional skateboarder during the late 80's and early to mid 90's.  He  also jointly owned a successful Skateboard company called 'Stereo  Skateoboards'.
Jasons also starred in a Skatebording video called 'Blind  video days' back in the late 80's.  A video which is regarded by many as  the best Skateboarding video ever.
Its pretty amazing that both his  first big Skating and Acting debuts led to cult status in different fields.  Maybe shutting one door has opened another equally as rewarding.",948240000,,794,4.757352941176471
748615,3,6303964745,"This is a show for the misunderstood slacker in all of us.  It had so many things in it that made me laugh.  The best thing I liked about the film was the cutting-edge dialogue...and running-gags.  Especially, with the guy  who is trying really hard to 'see' something, I don't want to blow it for  you...but I can totally relate to his frustration!
The cameo of Stan  Lee was awesome for those of us comic lovers, and you can't go wrong with  all of the behind-the-scenes stuff.  Its always amazes me how much is left  out of a film, and I was glad to see some of the shots that were cut, I  could see why...it just made the film better.
I liked the supporting cast  better than the main cast for some reason, they seemed more developed in my  opinion. Jay and Silent Bob were a crack-up.  I want to see 'Clerks' now.
Not a show for kids, of course, some of the dialogue is just too  raw.
Overall, this is totally worth seeing at least once.",948067200,,942,4.219101123595506
748616,5,6303964745,"This is the first film I watched by Kevin Smith. Its just the funniest thing I have ever seen. I must have watched it 20 times (No Joke)and it still makes me laugh.  The DVD is the best, all the extra stuff makes a  saddo like me happy. Ignore what all the critics or reviews say just get it  don't even think about it!",947808000,,319,3.953125
748617,5,6303964745,"When this movie first came out I read all the reviews.  I wish I hadn't.  When I finally got a chance to see Mallrats, I knew my appreciation of Kevin Smith as a writer/director/actor wasn't misplaced.  If you haven't  seen this movie, forget the critics, get some popcorn and Dots, kick back  and enjoy.",947721600,,304,4.555555555555555
748618,5,6303964745,"This is a great movie. Critics disn;t like it and gave it bad reviews. They said it was childish. It was meant to be that way. It even says so on the dvd. The movie is hillarius. It is a about two guys and their  adventures in a local mall. Some are funny, others are obnoxios like the  topless fortune teller. If you fell bad or just wan;t a good laugh buy this  classic movie.

748621,5,6303964745,"This movie is so ridiculously original and hillarious, that anyone who doesn't like it has serious problems. The actors are phenomenal with their facial expressions and character acting. Kevin Smith is a genius and you  must also see his other movies, Clerks, Chasing Amy, and Dogma. They all  have that same sexually explicit drama and the perfect mix of great  vocabulary and cussing. It's entertainment that you don't have to think too  hard about, but at the same time you won't catch everything the first time  you watch it. I've seen it a million times, and I still laugh at the same  jokes. Jay and Silent Bob rule!",945216000,2,622,4.712962962962963
748622,5,6303964745,"Kevin Smith is one of the most underated writers today. Malllrats has something that many comedys  today don't have...humor. This  movie is halarious. If you are a huge Kevin Smith fan as i am, i highly recommend  buying the DVD version, with over an hour of deleted footage that's funnier  than a 3 legged dog.",944524800,7,311,4.6
748623,4,6303964745,"So what if critics panned this movie?  So what if Kevin Smith speaks of it in a self depricating manner?  Mallrats is not Clerks.  It lacks the profundity of Clerks, and it isn't as DIY either, so it is difficult to  swallow some of the acting performances (Shannon Doherty gets top billing,  what do you expect?).  One of the strengths of Mallrats is the writing.  No  matter how unrealistic some of the dialogue is, it is at least as funny as  Clerks, and is 20 times funnier than Chasing Amy.  The other reason I would  implore you to check this movie out, if you haven't already, is Jason Lee.  I consider him one of the most underrated comedic actors out there.  His  timing and delivery slay me every time.  And to top it all off, Claire  Forlani is just plain gorgeous.",943833600,4,776,4.397163120567376
748744,5,6303964745,"This film is one of the best comedy films ever released. My favorite character is Brodie. He is a reflection of myself in every way. I, myself, am a mallrat and am always in the Mall Of La., in Baton Rouge. As a matter  of fact, this film is like a day in my life with me and my friends at the  local mall. I recommend this classic comedy to mallrats everywhere. Pick  this film up, and watch it over and over like I do. I must have seen it at  least 167 times, I swear. I never get tired of it.",943660800,2,495,3.823529411764706
748745,5,6303964745,"Jay and Silent Bob are back and they are still at it.  Causing complete chaos and anarchy where ever they go.  Jason Lee plays a great role as a comic book freak who receives love advise from none other than Stan Lee  himself.  The game show scene is great.  Just a great movie overall.  I  think that most of these type movies get a bad rating from critics is  because there are no special effects extravaganzas here.  Just real actors.  No robots, space scenes, exploding death stars or none of that.  Although  Silent Bob does try to perform the Jedi mind trick through out the whole  film.",943228800,2,593,4.429906542056075
748746,4,6303964745,"Kevin Smith is one of the best comedy writers around these days, and why the critics hated this movie so much is beyond me.  Dialogue makes Smith's movies what they are, and in this one Jason Lee's Brody steals the show.  Jay and Silent Bob get more screen time in this movie than in Clerks, and  I'm glad.  They add a certain comic-book flair that you wouldn't really  expect in a simple mall movie.  Jeremy London plays the straight character  that acts as juxtapostion to Brody's almost twisted irreverence.  I will  admit, as far as actual quality goes, this movie pales in comparrison to  Clerks and Chasing Amy, but if you're looking for pure entertainment and  loud laughs, this is the movie you wana get.
And yes, there is a plot,  but it doesn't really matter because the diologue is so damned funny!",942969600,,809,4.580419580419581
748747,5,6303964745,I forst saw this movie in the theater and loved it.  then iheard about Clerks rented that and loved it.  When chasing Amy came out i saw it in the theaters and loved it.  the NJT (New Jersey Trilogy) is the greatest group  of movies ever.  my favorite being Mallrats(but ill have to wait to see  Dogma).  My second favorite mover ever is Chasing Amy.  My third is clerks.  the Movie is just so funny and the way it is set up is just great.  what about the whole trilogy i like the most is that they all go together  with things like names and people dying in bathrooms and pools.  I  really enjoy Kevin Smith's comics.  I also heard that Kevin Smith is making  a new Superman Movie.,941932800,,682,4.178294573643411
748748,4,6303964745,"Many people don't rate mallrats as well as the other two films of Kevin Smith's New Jersey trilogy.  I think it's the best, because it doesn't deliberately encumber itself with pseudo-serious and contrived sub-plots  (hetero boy falls in love with homo girl).  Mallrats has the same strengths  as the best Seinfeld episodes, which Time Magazine says might be the best  television series ever. Mallrats is the most entertaining since it's also  the most over the top of the three films, with the same sort of zany humor  as the silent era classics.  Mallrats doesn't try to be anything.  Clerks  and Chasing Amy are excellent films, but they try to be something besides  entertaining.",941587200,,683,4.95575221238938
748749,5,6303964745,"So, here we have Mallrats, Kevin Smith's second effort that on first viewing I considerd as bad a movie as everyone else on the planet considered it. But, on second viewing, and second thought, I realized the  movie had more to offer. From repeat watchings of Clerks and Chasing Amy I  developed a love of Kevin Smith's style. You get drawn into this universe  that seems to revolve around conveinence stores, malls, and comic books.  Fans of the sci-fi/fantasy genre and those who know who Stan Lee is will  appreciate the references and truly I can say this is an entertaining film  that's always up for repeat viewings. And if you can't see the movie's  charm than consider it more as spending a day with the friends you always  wanted at the mall. Complete your 'Jersey Trilogy' with a copy of  Mallrats...just make sure you don't leave it out where other people could  find it.

748874,1,6303964745,"There are very few statements in life that are indisputable. One such statement, however, is this: Mallrats sucks. For some reason, fans of Clerks have latched on to this wretched little film like it's a slacker  comic masterpiece. It's nothing more than a tired string of gags...It even  reverts to a running joke, which is about as lame as you can get. I'm  fifteen, so I'm not ""an old guy in khakis,"" as one reviewer so  eloquently put it--I'm just smart enough to know when I'm being forcefed  contrived garbage. Please, all you would be movie critics: Let Mallrats  die. Move on. This movie has absolutely no merit whatsoever.",930787200,9,631,4.743119266055046

748876,5,6303964745,"Indeed, forget any bad words attributted to this film.  They are all unfounded and pretentious.  Mallrats is perhaps not the best film out of the so called 'Jersey Trilogy', but it is the funniest, hands down.

7857395,3,6303964745,"I was very disappointed in the digital code not working. If you go to nbcucodes.com, you can check the expiration dates for Universal movies. They are the only company I've come across that rigidly sticks to the expiration dates, and it's also not printed anywhere on the cover or insert. I got nowhere with their customer service with a different movie, and I'm not going to bother with this one.

The rest of it is good, though. The movie doesn't hold up as well as when it came out, but it's still enjoyable. Plenty of extras on the disc, too.

It would be 4 stars if the digital code worked and I'd still recommend picking this up, as long as you're ok with that.",1521763200,,667,4.370967741935484
7857396,1,6303964745,"The movie itself is a just as I remembered it; classic Kevin Smith.

The reason I'm giving it one star is because this blu-ray is listed as having Digital HD Ultraviolet and was the main reason I purchased this disc.  But once you open it up and try to redeem the code, you'll discover that it is expired. A quick email to Universal reveals that they no longer offer a UV copy of this movie and, instead, I was given the option of receiving Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Big Nope.

This practice of having digital copies expire when the case itself presents Digital HD as an added feature with no obvious warning that you might not get what you thought you were paying for is completely deceptive and unacceptable. It's like advertising the package contains both Blu-ray and DVD and finding they've removed the Blu-ray discs because that deal has expired. That obviously hasn't happened because removing a physical disc from a sealed package would be very difficult but because they can simply make digital HD codes inactive, they can do this very easily with this format. The practice of doing so is no less acceptable, though.

I've experienced this in the past with the old digital downloads format but never with UV. Needless to say, I'll be avoiding Universal movies in the future.",1521331200,7,1286,4.702222222222222
