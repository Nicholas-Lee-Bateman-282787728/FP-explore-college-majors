1974307,5,B000163WWG,"Well, this was a bit corny, but I understand that the military really wouldn't want to acknowledge the existence of a ""UFO"".
I think the storyline was a little 'overdone' - I'm not sure the government would go quite that far to 'erase' evidence, but you never know...",1280620800,,267,4.583333333333333
1974308,2,B000163WWG,"This movie is slow-going but is interesting if you're a serious fan of UFO films. This film is much less about a UFO that is sighted by a few pilots than it is about the government's process for shutting up the pilots. After the pilots report having seen radar blips moving strangely and the disappearance of one of their planes, they are locked in a secret facility for 18 hours where government agents mess with their heads and try to get them to say that nothing out-of-the-ordinary happened.",1267488000,,495,4.636363636363637
1974309,1,B000163WWG,"""The Disappearance of Flight 412"" is a 1974 piece of garbage about UFOs and a big government conspiracy starring Glenn Ford (!), David Soul, and Bradford Dillman. As a current airline pilot and former Air Force officer and pilot, all I have to say on the technical merits of this film is that it's pure junk. The film starts with ponderous narration about the UFO threat and hokey airplane footage, and goes downhill into government conspiracy theory territory from there. Not that I will dwell on it, but the airplane related babble from pilot David Soul and crew, especially the bit about blindly following the instructions from an unknown entity called ""Digger Control"", is beyond painful.

Soul and crew land at an unknown military field and are interviewed by government agents, who interrogate them brutally by taking them to comfortable briefing rooms and giving them coffee and light refreshments. Immediately one of the crewmembers cracks under the pressure, despite the interrogation being laughable on a number of planes (you'll pardon the pun). Glenn Ford shows up to rescue his men (which is a good thing as David Soul came up with the stupidest escape plan ever) triggering an idiotic prisoner release plotpoint. (They were held for a whole 18 hours, although the film makes is seem like much less.)

The conclusion involves a wholly predicable plot twist (I loved the Top Secret documents kept in a dresser drawer, by the way) involving more narration and general wincing from the audience.

This movie is just horrendous: the transfer is bad, but the best transfer in history couldn't make up for the fact that you are watching a steaming heap of dung. Avoid this like the plague.",1259539200,5,1696,4.943859649122807
1974310,1,B000163WWG,This movie is not what I thought it would be.  I really thought it would be a plane disaster movie. Boy was I wrong.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I know it is based on a true story but get real it was awful.,1248048000,2,223,3.723404255319149
1974311,1,B000163WWG,"I was utterly disappointed about this movie and turned it off 23 minutes into it. As mentioned, the visual and audio quality is horrible, but on top of that the cover picture of a commercial airliner leads customers to believe this is a disaster movie about a commercial jet airliner going down with a couple of hundred passengers on board, and the rescue and investigation efforts after the event, instead, this is a military film with no suspense build-up whatsoever. So in addition of the misleading cover picture (""false advertisement?""), this movie is beyond boring - it's a waste of money and resources.",1215475200,2,609,4.922330097087379
1974312,2,B000163WWG,"In THE DISAPPEARANCE OF FLIGHT 412, most reviewers harp on the poor quality of both sight and sound.  They are certainly right on both counts. In fact, the entire production smacks of a carelessly done reshoot of a television movie.  But my concern is more on the what than the how.  In this film, an airforce jet is tailed by three UFOS.  Two military jets are scrambled to get a visual.  They disappear in a cloud bank, and the rest of the movie details a coercive debriefing of the crew in a manner that seems more likely to result in a coverup than in any sanctioned search for the truth.  Glenn Ford is a colonel whose primary goal is to protect his men, and it is only later that he realizes that there are issues involved that imply an ongoing series of coverups authorized at the very highest levels. What this film tells us is nothing new.  From Roswell in the 1950s to THE XFILES of the 1990s. the truth is ""out there"" and when brave officers like Ford buck his superiors to find that truth, they learn to their dismay that bravery comes at a price.  THE DISAPPEARANCE OF FLIGHT 412 is a half-hearted attempt to shed some light on a topic that may never be uncovered to the satisfaction of all concerned. It raises some serious issues of the morality of blindly following orders by a shadow government whose only goal in matters like this is to sweep any ET dirt under a carpet, but it ducks their resolution in a manner that leaves the viewer hoping against hope that our ""real"" government has a higher morality than the one that Glenn Ford so painfully tried to cross.",1203638400,19,1580,4.424137931034482

1974314,1,B000163WWG,"I have probably never seen a movie with quality as bad as this.

Even my old tapes from TV were 500% better.  The picture was faded, the characters looked like they were 90 years old and the sound track was off so badly that it also garbled words, so looking away from the movie did not help.  It is also one hour long--but seemed like three-probably a copy of a TV movie as it also had cuts for commercials though I could not find any place that said this. It was advertised as a 2 Hour DVD-and it is--I guess, but I could not see any more of it.  At the end of one hour, it just showed credits and it was over. I am returning it-and it is the first copy of a DVD that I have ever returned for picture and sound quality.",1150675200,60,721,3.9517241379310346

1974343,4,B000163WWG,"A very enjoyable old TV movie, well acted with great actors. Some problems with voice and lip movement in the DVD, and the director didn't insure actors conformed to military regulations, so it did appear a bit of a fake.

1974345,3,B000163WWG,"Although this movie is fictionalized, not every narrative is totally off-base. Such tactics are occasionally employed in the name of ""national security"" which has become a ruse under which corrupt authorities operate. The official lies of 9/11 are a good example. Searching the history of UFOs reveals a lot of similar circumstances (Mantell, Louette, Rendlesham-1980, etc.) Military personnel that witness such unfortunate events frequently have their careers irrevocably harmed and the personnel know it. Ask the witnesses of the Rendlesham Forest incident in 1980. ;) The acting in this movie is solid whether the screenplay is totally accurate or not. I've seen much worse quality in both acting and production. However, I can't speak about the quality of transfer to DVD as I watched this movie online. Personally, I want to buy a copy on DVD, but not if the quality is poor...

Update: Well, since Mill Creek's 100 Sci-Fi Classics includes the Disappearance of Flight 412 and the price was discounted to $20, I decided to buy that collection. The transfer to DVD is likely a generational copy of a VHS so the movie is blurry on modern equipment. Judicious use of software controls, e.g. de-interlacing, results in a tolerable viewing experience. It could be worse and it could be better. I still like the movie even with the mediocre transfer. Elements of truth exist in this movie which are backed up elsewhere, e.g. the Rendlesham Forest Incident in 1980.",1301097600,6,1463,5.070539419087137
8007163,2,B000163WWG,"Murky and inconclusive, this film promises a lot more than it delivers. It may, however, satisfy those who buy into the idea that the U.S. Government routinely conspires to cover up unpleasant truths, ostensibly to protect the American people.",1523145600,,243,5.256410256410256
8007164,3,B000163WWG,"Long before The X-Files, this little gem of a made-for-tv movie dramatized a UFO conspiracy narrative in a way there was more serious-minded than any other such movie that had come before it or after it, until Dana Scully and Fox Mulder appeared on the scene.

I went into The Disappearance of Flight 412 with low expectations, and was surprised to find well-above-average dialogue and character interactions, and well-above-average acting. The movie is also well cast and well-paced. Mind you, I am putting it within the context of other movies of its kind - made for TV dramas and science fiction flicks of that era - but even judged on its own merits it is still above average, and certainly worth a view for fans of made-for-tv genre movies, as well as X-Files fans who might want to take a look at a precursor.",1521331200,,815,4.659722222222222

8007166,5,B000163WWG,"The Disappearance of Flight 412, featuring Glen Ford as Colonel Pete Moore and David Soul as Captain Roy Bishop. This is a 1974 TV Movie that I must have missed back in the day, and I wonder how widely it was distributed. At Whitney AFB, a Radar Test Group, their aircraft have been experiencing electrical problems lately, and a plane crew of four men, piloted by Captain Roy Bishop, are sent up to test their plane when three bogies appear on their radar scope, as well as ground radar. Marine jets are sent up to investigate and disappear, then Flight 412 is ordered by Digger Control, an SID team to an abandoned military base where they are held prisoners while being debriefed. Colonel Moore is upset that his men have been spirited away from him and follows the plane by radar, eventually discovering where they are being held and takes his aide to retrieve the men. They are met by Colonel Troutman, in charge of the SID Team, who claims National Security, and holds them until hes satisfied the men will not reveal what they know about the UFO incident. This was an interesting story, actually filmed on a couple AF Bases that shows the cover up of UFO incidents by the military. Im not sure how they got this filmed, as there were lots of incidents during this time period involving UFOs over restricted areas containing both missiles and aircraft loaded with nuclear weapons. Although part documentary, the UFOs are only seen on radar, and some black and white film from old reports are presented. This is basically a character study of the men involved in the incident, and Glen Ford and David Soul are excellent, as are the rest of the cast. This was a very enjoyable movie.",1489449600,,1687,4.626666666666667
