7828600,3,6302571901,"In this tribute, the Dukes of Dixieland pay homage to the great New Orleans pianist Jelly Roll Morton. In essence, this is a club concert in which the Dukes play all Jelly Roll songs. It was recorded in the Crescent City at Lulu White's Mahogany Hall. The given recording date is 1992 but considering everybody's clothes and the production, it feels more like the 1980s. The band plays classics like 'Wolverine Blues,' 'Milneburg Joys,' and 'Winin' Boy Blues.' The band features J.B. Scott, Tim Laughlin, Al Barthlow, Richard Taylor, Tom McDermott and Everett Link. Mostly, this is a brass driven experience. That said, Tom McDermott has some great piano moments. In particular, 'Fingerbreaker' brings honor to the evening's namesake. Most songs are instrumental but every now and then the band brings out Danny Barker. He played with the namesake back in the day. In addition to singing, he plays the guitar and banjo. Barker is a fantastic accompaniment. The band gives a good performance that foreshadows their eventual ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dukes-Of-Dixieland-Play-The-Music-Of-Jelly-Roll-Morton/dp/B000001V6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dukes Of Dixieland Play The Music Of Jelly Roll Morton</a>"" release. There are two potential issues with the ""Salute To Jelly Roll Morton."" First, it's the Dukes of Dixieland so for many listeners, this is New Orleans style Jazz but it's just too White. Barker helps with this concern, but he only plays in a few of the tunes. Second, outside of a brief reading in which Morton describes New Orleans, little biographical information is given. One really has to already know Jelly Roll Mortin and his music to appreciate the significance of this performance. Ken Burns' ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jazz/dp/B00004XQOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jazz</a>"" can help in this department. In the end, the Dukes of Dixieland give it their best to salute one of America's great pianists and song writers.",1379376000,,2028,5.808724832214765

What saves the DVD is Jelly Roll's music but the band is a journeyman combo at best, lacking the flare and energy of the group headed by the Assunto brothers and Papa Jack that once recorded on the Audiophile label and, at one time, featured Pete Fountain.",1196726400,11,348,4.612903225806452
