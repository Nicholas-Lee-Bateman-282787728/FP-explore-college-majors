8234549,5,B000Z27HWC,"I bought this DVD as a 2009 Christmas gift for my two little sisters who were adopted from China. They immediately became fans and I've been told how they've watched it a thousand times since getting it. ""Big Brother Binky"" not only shows the beauties of the Chinese culture rather accurately, for example, many people practicing tai chi in public, flying kites, and crickets are considered good luck charms; but also in the ups and downs of siblings, especially between Arthur and D.W. in teaching Binky how to be a good big brother. It's touching in how he really catches on quickly into being a loving older sibling to Mei Lin (whose name means ""beautiful jade, plum jade"", both plums and jade  considered lucky.) Much thanks to the producers of Arthur, and to Marc Brown for his lovable creation of everyone's favourite aardvark and his family and friends.",1276473600,,860,4.8108108108108105
8234550,4,B000Z27HWC,"This DVD features four episodes from PBS' Arthur series.  I've often found it interesting and entertaining.  Sometimes you can even learn something!  The quality has slipped some over the years. But compared to too many children's programs, it does well.  Kids of all ages can enjoy it.  This show is definitely an ensemble piece.  That's a problem here.  These episodes regulate Arthur to a minor role.  Only in the first two does he receive signficant airtime.  That's not a complaint you hear on many shows.  But it's still the Arthur program!  First up is a two-part episode.  Binky Barnes, the resident held-back bully, is getting a sister.  His parents have decided to adopt a baby from China.  He gets the job of handling all that paperwork.  I didn't hear any mention of getting passports.  But he does get some shots. Ouch!  His feelings go from excitement to anxiety.  There are a lot of adjustments to be made.  She sure cries a lot.  Watch for the monkey face!  We do learn some about Chinese culture.  The animation is very nice.  But a PC feeling shows up.  Is the China in this cartoon world Communist?  I sure hope not.  Some might wonder why the Barnes don't adopt a little closer to home.  The next cartoon deals with cell phones.  Fern, that shy would-be detective, isn't a fan of them.  But her parents get her one.  It's only for emergencies.  Unfortunately, rich girl Muffy has the same model.  Fern learns about personalized ringtones,  taking photos, and talking too much.  Things don't go too well.  She's actually one of the most interesting female characters.  The final episode deals with Alan, aka the Brain.  An old photo reveals his awful secret.  He was held back-in kindergarten.  How often does that happen?  This news leads to a strange and frustrating friendship with Binky.  He knows a lot about being held back.  Many other characters on the series barely appear, if at all, on these episodes.  But that's expected on a show with people.  It's not surprising for cartoons.  The postcards bits were OK.  But I liked the earlier ""a word from us kids"" format better.  Arthur's creator Marc Brown has some short segments.  Learn about drawing and such!  Many will enjoy this DVD.  If not, there are many other wonderful Arthur stories to watch.  Perhaps your favorite characters are the focus there.",1243468800,5,2333,4.765151515151516
8234551,5,B000Z27HWC,"The three episodes on Big Brother Binky are also on the Arthur Season 11 DVD and are as follows:

-Big Brother Binky
-Phony Fern, and
-Brain's Shocking Secret

Arthur is probably the premier children's animated series on television and so this DVD is recommended but if Arthur Season 11 is also a possibility might want to hold off on this DVD.",1228348800,,344,4.622950819672131
