8249606,1,B0013AL744,"I was into Tae Kwon Do for years, and competed in tournaments in the mid-1980's.  I do not recall ever being taught or even having seen a single ""grab"" or choke, takedown, joint lock, etc.  The creator of this DVD obviously is trying to jump on the MMA bandwagon and make it look like TKD incorporates MMA-style techniques, when it doesn't.  Just as Judo or wrestling don't incorporate kicks, TKD doesn't incorporate chokes or grabs, etc.  Totally fake and dishonest, this dvd.",1331942400,,477,4.780487804878049
