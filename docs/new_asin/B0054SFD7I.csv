4570849,1,B0054SFD7I,"In over fifty years of watching films of all kinds, from all eras and countries, I can honestly say this is the most fatuous, butt-achingly, bile-spewingly terrible film I`ve ever had the misfortune to sit through. I`m not talking about genuine trash that can, arguably, be `so bad it`s good`, nor am I talking about lousy rom-coms which can be vaguely entertaining. I am talking wall-to-wall tedium.
I`m not going to describe this two-hour test of one`s patience, because I can`t be bothered. Until I saw Archipelago (now a personal watchword for anything terminally dreadful) in all its pointless monotony, Mamma Mia took the laurel for the most inept film I`d yet seen, but even that vapid monstrosity had Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried acting and singing well (though little else) whereas this has nothing - nothing at all to recommend it, not a single redeeming feature. I took away nothing at all - other than anger and frustration - from this smugly awful tripe. The performances are uniformly pallid, Joanna Hogg`s direction is mystifyingly drab, and the part-improvised script is emotionless, passionless, and an insult to its audience.
The whole farrago is dramatically inert, emotionally void, with no tension or dynamic to temper its interminable, tortuous tedium.
It lacks a pulse.
You may wonder then why the two previous reviewers have, bafflingly, awarded this film five stars apiece. Reader, believe me, so do I!
My advice? Avoid.",1355443200,5,1449,5.092436974789916
4570850,5,B0054SFD7I,"Hogg has a European sensibility,here less is more. A group of English people on a family holiday,as with Unrelated but with more depth and introspection. What happens if you take away the usual clichs of plot or if you show nothing happening,but there is an undertow. We don't get a holiday romance,just elements of sexual attraction. We see the cooking and sexing of lobsters,the shooting and plucking of peasants;the way to paint in nature using abstraction,chaos to parallel Hogg's ideas of film-making. We have a painting teacher,Chris in the house-hold and a resident cook,Rose. The family's relationships with them counterbalance the family's repressed emotions. Tom Huddleston plays the wet,empathetic,idealistic Edward attending the family get- together before leaving for Africa for a year to work. The setting is Trescoe in the Scilly Isles,where the mother Patricia(Kate Fahy) of a well-off clan gathers daughter Cynthia(Lydia Leonard) and son Tom,while the father Will remains enigmatically absent, a cold forbidding father and negligent husband,screamed at by Patricia near the end over the phone. Cynthia vents her rage or flies off the handle over the smallest things,tyrannising over her family,appeased by Edward. Nothing comes to fruition,there are blazing rows that blow out. Edward has not been allowed to bring his girlfriend Chloe on holiday because she's `not family'He befriends Rose but doesn't follow it up. The palette of colours in this dream-like landscape is austerely restricted like the themes and treatment. This understated vision was quietly impressive.",1347667200,4,1588,5.566115702479339
4570851,5,B0054SFD7I,"Archipelago is not a wonderful film. It is one of the few films that dares to analyse the English middle-class mindset. It is an intriguing portrayal of loneliness.

A family holiday is a rented house in a baron landscape. A painter is hired to assist them with their artistic bent. A young female cook supplements her income as their cook/housemaid. Pheasant are killed especially for them. Two lobsters are also caught for 35 without so much as a pause in the sale. We don't see the fisherman hand over the 5 change. Such things are completely unimportant. And taken for granted.

The layers of the film are to be enjoyed. The painter provides 'chaos.' The juxtaposition of art and life is rendered through words and pictures. The telephone in the confined corner is a masterstroke. As are the doors, the pale shades of walls and the missing painting. When the family each in turn say good-bye to the house I see and hear lives as empty as the restaurant they all dined at. Just once.

Only the painter has an unconditional relationship but that is with his creative spirit. The cook is strong enough to step aside. It is the family who have suffered as individuals. Never been loved. Their relationships conditional, disciplined and defined. A change of scene, equally well ordered, is their only form of hope.

Can I recommend this film? It is up to you. I enjoy original filmmaking which keeps me watching, wondering. Thinking after the facts. With time.",1344124800,10,1459,4.75494071146245

I mean look at the last few Transformer movies those had tones of action and they were pieces of... well you know.

This movie had depth and feeling and had you wanting to just hold Edward and slap his sister and tell her to just grow up. True Edward needs to stand up to his family or just stand on his own.

4570870,5,B0054SFD7I,"When I wasn't laughing my head off at the extreme patheticness of the characters and situations, I realized just how brilliant Joanna Hogg is at dissecting and expressing the multiple, nuanced layers of emotional neurosis of her characters, and how they fed off of one another. I decided that Joanna Hogg is a female version of the ""Woody Allen"" of the British upper middle class (which is completely foreign to me).

Although Cynthia was usually gratingly obnoxious, given the family situation of the absentee father, it seems to me that she took it upon herself to be the ""dad,"" and resented the hell out of it. She had also taken it upon herself to express the rage that she felt her mother should be expressing at ""dad"" for deserting the family, and was furious at her mother for shirking her responsibility to stand up to her husband.

I found everything that Christopher, the ""artist-in-residence"" said and did (including his paintings), most of the time, to be absolutely hilarious. But despite the ""chaos"" of his mind, he occasionally hit the nail on the head so precisely that it blew me away. For instance, when he, Edward, Cynthia and ""Mum"" were eating dinner together, Cynthia started in on Edward about Chloe (his girlfriend of 1.5 years) by saying to Edward that if he's going to Africa for a year and Chloe isn't allowed to visit him there, then his relationship with Chloe can't exactly be his first priority. It was a characteristically mean and vindictive thing for Cynthia to say, although in this case she was spot-on, and the whacky but harmless Christopher came out with something to the effect of ""She's got a point there.""

Of course there was also sadness, expressed mostly by Edward. Tom Hiddleston is incredibly brilliant in this role (as he is in every role he plays), which seems to echo what I've read about his personal life. His parents divorced when he was around 13 or so. I guess that like many boys in his position at that age, he may have felt that in the absence of his father, he had to take on the role of ""the man of the house"" and felt deeply responsible for the welfare of his mother and 2 sisters without the benefit of being an adult. I felt so bad for Edward because he seemed so lost, confused, bereft and insecure. Edward gravitated to Rose, the hired cook, and to Christopher, the only other adult male in the house, just to get away from his neurotic mother and sister. As the film developed, Edward seemed to look more and more to Christopher, out of sheer desperation at the lack of a proper father figure/role model, for guidance in deciding his future. At one point, Christopher asked Edward if there were any alternatives to his year-long stay in Africa, and Edward said he wanted to be a writer. People like Christopher and Edward are very sensitive and very different from most people, who just go about their business and wonder what these people are so hung up about. I loved something that Christopher said in his last conversation with Edward. He was telling Edward about his own professional development, and how his father had told him that he didn't think Christopher should go to art school because he wasn't ""tough enough."" He thought that Christopher wouldn't be able to handle the criticism he would get in art school. It wasn't clear to me whether he actually did go to art school, but he said he knew he wanted to paint and had found a way to do it, regardless. He also pointed out that while it took him longer than most people to reach his professional and personal goals, he had more perspective on things than most people did.

The film was very slow moving, but I wasn't bored for a second. Not only were the scenery and cinematography magnificent, but I was absolutely hooked, throughout the entire film, on finding out what would happen next. Joanna Hogg really is a master at successfully conveying subtle, complicated, nuanced emotion in a very compelling and engaging way. What an incredible talent.",1414886400,13,3979,4.68

*****

I LOVE this film.  That may be all you need or want to know.
This is Joanna Hoggs second film and her second featuring Tom Hiddleston.  Unrelated was their first  her first film  his first film.  Hogg is a unique film maker.  She shoots her films chronologically, with minimal script, so that the actors need to be spontaneous and inventive.  There is minimal camera movement, no music on the soundtrack; in the case of Archipelago, one hears mostly wind and bird song.  These are films in which little seems to happen  the opposite of action/adventure movies  but there is oh-so-much going on just below the surface.  And, actors often means non-actors or performers with very limited experience included in the cast.  In Archipelago, Amy Lloyd as Rose  the cook   and Christopher Baker, the artist  are in fact a cook and an artist.  A few smaller roles are taken by locals on the island of Tresco where the film takes place.  As with the making of Unrelated, the key players all lived on the premises  in this case, the house that the fictional Leighton family have rented for their holiday.  The family holiday is, in fact, the prism through which Hogg allows us to view the complex and often painful relationships in both of Hoggs first two films.

Archipelago has been described as quietly devastating  an accurate description.  There is a great deal of space and silence, things left unsaid, often excruciating moments of stillness and unease  and a few of those intense/explosive ones that Hogg prefers to carry out off stage to great effect.

All the cast are wonderful  a convincing and effective ensemble.  Tom Hiddleston has the central role in Archipelago and his character, Edward, the younger sibling, is quite different from Oakley, the somewhat impudent young risk-taker in Unrelated.  Hiddleston is simply wonderful in both films finding the deep pain at the core of each young man, but fully able to realize it in tellingly different ways.

Director Joanna Hogg:
I mean, whats extraordinary is that in Unrelated he was playing a very different character this very, very cocksure, rather arrogant character.  .  I love that Edward is so polar opposite to Oakley, the character Tom played in Unrelated. It is a credit to Toms skill as an actor that he can get so completely beneath the skin of such different animals as these.
Much more could be said about this intimate, thought-provoking film, but I will just say that if nuance and interior  dialogue appeal to you, then you will find Archipelago deeply rewarding and a film that lingers in the mind long after the closing credits.

4570872,2,B0054SFD7I,Very slow a full movie of people in a house with not much to say to each other and everyone in a horrible mood. I only watched it for Tom Hiddleston.,1414108800,2,149,3.838709677419355

4570874,4,B0054SFD7I,"This was an easier experience than _Unrelated_. The excruciating family tensions abound in this one, as well, but the situations are less embarrassing and more just plain hard. Poor Edward (Hiddleston) is apparently stuck in a family of clueless people who think only of themselves. It's painful to watch Edward endure his condescending sister, clueless mother, and absentee father as he tries to figure out who he is as a young person in a competitive world. Mom's relationship with her painter friend is less interesting, but adds to the family tensions, as does Edward's friendship with ""the help,"" which seems intolerable (or at least puzzling) to the others. He seems like a sensitive soul, trying to stand up to his repressed but oppressive relatives. There were several occasions upon which I found myself shouting at the screen to tell off his sister or mother, or to plead with him to stand up for himself, but alas, they're all so terribly British about it all, aren't they. I mean, honestly--you can't have your girlfriend of two years along on our family trip because *she's not family*. How terribly Victorian of them. Joanna Hogg's films seem to have been created so that British people can cringe at themselves and the rest of us can shake our heads and say, ""Thank God we're not British."" I kid, of course... I love the British. Just don't think I get their humor as well as I previously thought.

Okay, okay, there is one scene I did find a little funny--when the family is at the table arguing over whether it's a bad idea to help the hired help with their tasks, because after all, what will they do if you do their job for them? Edward's just trying to be a decent human being, and he's getting told off for leaving the girl nothing of any substance to do to earn her wage. I guess I shouldn't find the class thing funny, really, but it's one of those shake-your-head-in-disbelief funny scenarios.",1404777600,8,1917,4.705357142857143

But outside of how it's shot there are messages to be picked up in the dialogue. I love how they had a real artist, instead of an actor, play the artist. It's an interesting movie.
