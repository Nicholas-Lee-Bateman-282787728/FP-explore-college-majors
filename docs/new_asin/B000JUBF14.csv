8205730,4,B000JUBF14,"This is not like most videos one comes across typically. The format is the musicians playing one of Ghana's traditional song/dances as an ensemble, then breaking it down part by part for a bit of time so one can learn the specific rhythm pattern of each instrument. I must admit after four such tutorials I grew a bit fatigued, but it is cool at the end of each separation because they have the ensemble play together again, and the dancers join in to demonstrate the moves appropriate to that style. All-in-all the video is geared for drummers interested in West African styles, and as such it is not for every audience. I did find, however, that in the ethnomusicology class I teach, the students were very attentive and paid close attention, especially the musicians. The only complaint I have is that there is no booklet to explain what is being seen. One would have to find a book on the subject to consult for reference and significance/history. This is the main reason I did not award more stars. As before, this video is geared for serious musicians and drummers only.",1203984000,6,1076,4.668421052631579
8205731,4,B000JUBF14,"""Dance-Drumming of the Anlo-Ewe"" is a good instructional video. It features four rhythms commonly played by the Anlo-Ewe peoples of eastern Ghana. Each chapter introduces a rhythm by showing each musician's part. The camera angle shows how each instrument is played from both the front and back. For the drummer, it is the behind angle that shows what an instrument will look like as played. Afterwards, the parts are all put together as the entire rhythm is played by the Ghana Dance Ensemble. Finally, the dancers demonstrate their moves. This process is played out for the Kinka, Agbadza, Slow Agbekor and Fast Agbekor rhythms. For the uninitiated, Agbadza is one of Ghana's great rhythms. While shot on video, the picture quality for this instructional DVD is excellent. The natural setting on the University of Ghana is a compliment. While instructional videos tend to be dry, the band puts on a good show for the camera. With the exception of not being able to hear the group sing, the audio is excellent. The lack of narration has two drawbacks. For starters, the audience never gets to hear the pronunciation of the rhythms or instruments. As an example, you'd never know that Abadza is actually pronounced ""ag-bye-jah,"" unless you've studied Ghanaian rhythm. The other drawback to the lack of narration is that the viewer never learns about the cultural context or history of the rhythms. In what situations are these rhythms typically played? Are these religious or recreational rhythms? Accompanying print material or a web site could have compensated for this lack of information. Another potential drawback is that the Slow Agbekor and Fast Agbekor rhythms are remarkably similar to the Agbadza. Thus it seems a bit like the consumer only gets two actual rhythms with this product. A final issue is that the disc lacks chapters as accessed through a menu. Thus the viewer must chronologically click through each micro-section to arrive at a destination. Despite drawbacks, there is no peer to this DVD. There have been books on the topic, but their content remains elusive for many who would like to play Ghanaian rhythms. This product is perfect for both individuals and institutions of any educational level. ""Dance-Drumming of the Anlo-Ewe"" stands as a wonderful instructional program that share the rhythms of Ghana with the world.",1198454400,8,2348,5.085492227979275
