Good acting and unusual scenes of eskimos and them also demonstrating kayak-paddling proficiency. - Famous actress Leni Riefenstahl when young! - Interested in her career I also ordered and watched the movie ""The White Hell Pitz Palu"", including her final interview 2002, in German!- Interesting seeing a different perspective!",1171411200,,485,5.394736842105263

8083150,4,B000B837WE,"While Arnold Fanck's 1933 S.O.S. Eisberg (aka S.O.S. Iceberg) may offer a change of location and a tighter running time, it still has many of the problems of his popular German mountain films: a thin plot, a repetitive narrative and an almost complete absence of characterisation. Luckily it still has the same strength, Fanck's remarkable eye for spectacular and inaccessible locations, here the ice floes of Greenland where a rescue expedition finds itself trapped on an iceberg drifting out to sea and their would-be rescuer, Leni Riefenstahl's pilot (and wife of one of the lost explorers) find herself trapped with them after a crash. Once she gets there she really has nothing to do except wait in a cave or strike the odd forlorn pose against the scenery, but unlike The White Hell of Pitz Palu the characters here are at least actively trying to save themselves rather than just waiting to be rescued, and the lengthy scenes of them jumping across the pack ice are often breathtaking, with one sequence where Sepp Rist finds himself stuck on a small crop of rock as a storm brews up around him especially impressive. For the most part the location footage is seamlessly mixed with studio footage, especially some of the polar bear scenes that behind the scenes photographs reveal were shot in a studio tank. There's also some impressive editing, both in the increasingly frenetic cutting as the lost expedition finally makes radio contact with the outside world and the exuberant sequence of Inuits coming to the rescue. You also get to see Walter Riml playing one of the less lucky members of the expedition just a couple of years before he gave up acting and became Riefenstahl's cinematographer on Triumph of the Will.

Fanck never quite develops the drama as well as he could, and things suddenly get very crazy towards the end as one man falls prey to a bear while two others fight to the death, and it's never explained why real-life fighter ace and future Luftwaffe bigwig and Goering scapegoat Ernst Udet, playing himself as usual in Fanck's films, suddenly comes to the rescue after we've been told all rescue attempts have been called off and all ships sent back. Luckily despite being lazy with the details it's still got enough of a narrative spine to hold up for an hour-and-a-half even if it is more of an excuse to awe audiences with the landscapes than draw them into a story. Shame about the dog, though, but he at least fares rather better in the simultaneously filmed American version directed by Tay Garnett, which replaced Gustav Diessl with Rod LaRoque and kept the supporting cast and same general storyline but made some significant changes. One of a series of US-German co-productions with Universal that ended when the Nazis came to power, it's included on Kino's Region 1 DVD, and it's an interesting comparison that works well in its own right.

The first 25 minutes of the film are almost completely different. Rather than a rescue mission, the five main explorers are all part of the same expedition, itself in search of the records of the real-life ill-fated Wegener expedition three years earlier. Where Fanck (credited here as `Expeditionary Leader') was content to find his drama in the arduous physical nature of the expedition and the grandeur of the land and seascape, Garnett is more of a storyteller, focussing on the character conflict and constantly emphasising the danger of the unstable iceberg overturning. LaRoque isn't the most likeable or responsible of expedition leaders, accusing his comrades of cowardice before going off on his own and needing to be rescued, while Greed's Gilbert Gowland, just another member of the expedition in the German version, here is its cowardly and increasingly unstable backer who dominates much of the drama in his absence. Sepp Rist remains the hero of the tale despite being dubbed like other German cast members, but Riefenstahl has even less to do in the American version than the German one, having little more than a bit part until the much more spectacular finale. Where Fanck was content to end with a joyfully kinetic sequence of Inuits kayaking to the iceberg, Garnett intercuts what's left of the footage with Riefenstahl and LaRoque trying to escape from the exploding iceberg before it sinks and takes them with it.

It's not the only change to the chronology or the plot: one character meets his end much sooner in the American version, most of the lengthy flying scenes have been heavily trimmed along with Udet's already brief role and the second plane crash is entirely missing (while the first is curiously flipped in the negative). Most make sense on a dramatic level even if the film never much rises above the level of an average Hollywood drama with decent production values, but what's missed the most is the sheer spectacle than Fanck's version had. Rather than (occasionally gratuitously) showcasing the hostile environment and emphasising the epic duel between man and nature, the US version uses only what is necessary to move the story forwards, and doesn't always use the most impressive footage, though it does add a lengthy section of travelling to the ice floe that sees them losing their dogs and most of their supplies down a crevasse. The fact that there's surprisingly little shared footage at times turns them into very different films despite the shared cast members and general plot. Of the two Fanck's is the better, but the American version is far from negligible even if it is much more of a melodrama, and thankfully Kino's Region 1 DVD contains both versions in very decent prints.",1366588800,2,5614,4.913593256059009
8083151,4,B000B837WE,"This is one of the so-called Mountain Movies that were so popular in Germany between the wars. It was directed in 1933 by the genre's foremost exponent, Arnold Fanck.

The photography is the star of the movie. The meager plot is just for something to hang the photography on, which is spectacular and well worth the movie. It was shot silent with the sound dubbed in later, so there's really not much dialog. Good score. I was surprised at the excellent quality of the recording.

Leni Riefenstahl, the star of the movie, doesn't do too much except stand around and look good. Also, she has some flying scenes. Gibson Gowland, an American actor, plays a guy who freaks out, not unlike the character he portrayed in Erich von Stroheim's truncated masterpiece, Greed.

The film also features the German WWI ace Ernst Udet who, with 62 kills, was second only to Von Richthofen. An amazing and talented man, he was put in charge of Luftwaffe equipment development in WWII and wound up committing suicide. He has some speaking scenes as well as the obligatory flying scenes. Fascinating to see him here.

All in all, an excellent pick for 30s film fans.",1347062400,4,1148,4.725
8083152,4,B000B837WE,"It was common practice during the early days of sound films to make
different versions in other languages and aimed at the cultural tastes
of their audiences. Some actors were bilingual while others spoke their
lines phonetically, sometimes with harsh accents. I was surprised to
notice the differences in these two versions concerning the plot
changes. The English one has some new scenes (The introductory one with
more actors)including the ending where we see the ghosts of the fallen
expedition members as a tribute to their memory. This version seems
more geared to American audiences who prefer sentiment as opposed to
the longer, harsher Teutonic version where the dog gets less screen time
and disappears. Leni hardly speaks in both films and in the English
version her voice seems dubbed by someone else as well as as her German
counterparts. Regardless, watching both versions is a worthwhile
experience. Stunning location scenery is cleverly edited with set work
to create coherent exciting scenes.",1302307200,,1009,5.234567901234568
8083153,5,B000B837WE,"An expedition of explorers was striking out across Greenland (The Karajak Glacier.)  Dr. Karl Lorenz (Gustav Diessl) was missing and presumed dead by all of his fellow explorers.  New evidence, however, shows the Dr. Lorenz has survived!  So now, it is time to send out a rescue party.

Hella Lorenz (Leni Riefenstahl), wife of Dr. Lorenz and stunt pilot learns of the expedition's demise.  In addition, that her husband may be alive on a rogue Iceberg.

This film has lots of ice action.  Once again, the true actors are the icebergs in this instance.  You get to see some flying stunts.  In addition, almost everything is eaten; but do not worry, you do not have to see all these things are eaten except for raw fish.  So sit back and enjoy the thrill of watching drama in the Arctic Ocean, as the iceberg is soon to turn over.

This KINO presentation has both the original German version and the English version.  I must say that the English version was shorter, chopped up, incoherent, and misleading.  The one redeeming value of the English version of this film is that in the end you can see that they had saved the dog.  Evidently, the English or more dog friendly.  However, the German version was a work of art.  If you have trouble keeping up with the German version, there are English subtitles, and this is still far superior to the English version.

Being a fan of Leni Riefenstahl movies, I could not pass this one and I am Glad I did not.  I figured that she would be burnt out by now but she just keeps getting better.

8083154,5,B000B837WE,"Nothing much to add to the other reviews, except to note that Ernst Udet, the second highest-scoring German fighter ace of World War I and a chief proponent of the dive bomber in the Luftwaffe of WWII, plays himself in the movie. Udet committed suicide in November, 1941, after his job as head of the research branch of the Luftwaffe drove him deep into alcoholism.",1183766400,7,365,4.630769230769231
8083155,4,B000B837WE,"The original German version of S.O.S. ICEBERG (1933) is one of the great action adventures of my lifetime.  Filmed on location amid the glaciers and icebergs of northern Greenland, it was shot simultaneously (with most of the same cast) in German and English.  It is about a crew of four or five, plus two directors and two cameramen, dispatched to Greenland to rescue a missing explorer named Karl Lorenz (Gustav Diessl).  The search party finds Dr. Lorenz, but then has to brave treacherous ice flows, polar bears, and falling glaciers.  The brave actors include legendary Leni Riefenstahl (top-billed in the German version as Mrs. Lorenz), Sepp Rist as Johannes Krafft, and GREED's Gibson Gowland as the angry Dragon in both versions.  The goal soon becomes crossing the ice flow-covered Bering Sea to reach the safety of an Eskimo village in Thule.  You know they make it, or most of them do, or else you'd have heard of dead actors in the Arctic.  But, boy, is this one hazardous journey--thrilling beyond words to watch, but probably hell to make.

Renowned explorer Dr. Arnold Franck directed the 86 minute German version, with English subtitles. Tay Garnett (CHINA SEAS) helmed the 76 minute English version for Universal Pictures.  The daring cinematographers responsible for the magnificent B&W photography are Hans Schneeberger and Richard Angst.  As best I can tell from watching both versions over two nights is that the English version has way less Leni Riefenstahl and suffers for the loss.  In the German version she follows the men up to Greenland in reel one to look for her missing husband; in the English version, Ms. Riefenstahl is given second billing and spends half the picture flying up to Greenland, where she finds her alive husband awfully quickly.  Additionally, the English version adds Rod La Rocque (top billed) to the cast as the missing husband and has the other men looking for both Leni and Rod; it also has a Preface thanking the brave actors and intrepid crew for risking their lives to spend an entire year making such a stunning adventure movie.  It was worth it.

S.O.S. ICEBERG is one beauty of an adventure film, whichever language you pick to watch.  The DVD from Kino Video includes superb copies of both versions on one DVD.  ***** for the German version, *** for the English.",1178064000,12,2322,4.900255754475704
