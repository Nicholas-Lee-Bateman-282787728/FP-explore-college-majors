1735941,1,B00006ADFI,"Usually, I try my best to find some redeeming factor that justifies the 2 hours I spent watching a movie. As a writer, I feel sometimes that it is my responsibility to do so. But there is not a single character, moment, reel, or line in this film that could justify paying for it, renting it...or even thinking about doing either. I've been entertained more thoroughly by George Bush. His idiocy is at least justified by his deficient mental capacities. The producers, actors, cameramen and even the gaffers should be taken to the back room of homollywood, f&%!ed and shot. I wouldn't recommend this film to an enemy.",1076630400,8,617,4.722222222222222
1735942,3,B00006ADFI,"I think the idea behind this film was good and that the film quality was good. It was a bit slow and had a 70's feel to it. It is a late bloomer coming out story. The guy finally deals with his feelings at the 30 something stage of life and starts moving towards the life that he denied himself. He starts telling his friends and family as well as looking for that life partner he has always wanted. It was worth watching but not as good as it should have been. It is a fairly fresh view and will prove thought provoking. Not bad, just not great.",1066867200,9,546,4.064814814814815
1735943,5,B00006ADFI,"I saw this film for the first time when it premiered at the 1999 Chicago Underground Film Festival (CUFF), and I was absolutely taken by this movie.
This is without a doubt the best gay movie made by a non-gay (at least, officially) director I've ever seen. It doesn't play into any stereotypes, and the actors who play in it are regular Joes just like anyone else. That's the reason I liked it so much; it shows that you don't have to pretty and witty to be gay.
I actually got a chance to meet Ben Berkowitz at the showing, and one of the most impressive things that I found out about ""Straightman"" was that his budget was so low that he couldn't get permits from the Chicago Film Office to shoot in a lot of the locations he used (not to mention some of the things he wanted to shoot wouldn't fly with the city), and for me, that gave scenes like the sex scene in Union Station a sense of danger (apparently, they take a dim view of that kind of thing in Union Station).
All in all, if you haven't seen this movie, DO IT NOW! I love this film both as a true-to-life gay story and as a Chicago movie.",1064016000,16,1102,4.154205607476635

1735945,5,B00006ADFI,"I am the type of girl that will watch the occasional guy flick. This film has no car chases or gun figths but the testosterone was oozing out of the dvd case. WOW macho guys gay and straigth working , finding love fighting, a very cool look at this life and a modern story. I loved it being a low budget film there are a few tech problmes but I didn't care. These guys a funny too the film switchs effortlessly between comedy and drama.
I have watched it 3 times in a month I loved it dvd has special features like audion commentary and trailers",1058313600,8,545,4.150943396226415

No hollywood [nonsense]... they made this thing for no money and traveled around the world winning film festival awards.
Ben Redgrave especially deserved the nod as a great actor. Buy this now you will never see a more honest first film. Any one who doesnt get it just can't handle the truth I loved it

1735947,1,B00006ADFI,"So, I am invited to watch a movie about two guys.
As the poorly-written script unfolds, the movie is consistantly riddled with human waistoids who smoke constantly, drink heavily, all have no idea what they want our of their relationships, and spit out .... in every sentence.
The best part of ""Straightman"" was when the red letters, THE END, were posted on the screen.",1043884800,,369,4.78125
1735948,5,B00006ADFI,"A rare find in today's film world ""Straightman"" shines as an independent film. While the film was done for very little money and it does show the movie works incredibly well on an emotional level. It also breaks new ground in the world of gay cinema in that it is one of the few films that deals with older men who are very blue collar. (why do 99% of gay films deal with impossibly beautiful young men?)
The story traces the friendship of two friends after their breakups with their girlfriends. After moving into together one begins to explore his gayness. This takes the friendship on some interesting turns especially when dealing with the first romance and heartbreak. While the plot is thin at times the film really is more of a character study between to friends as they come to terms with growing and changing. There are too many things to say as downsides to the film other than to point out some of the problems due to budget constraints - i.e. some minor sound and lighting problems. Over all I would say this is must see film.",1036454400,40,1038,4.497354497354498
1735949,3,B00006ADFI,"Essentially a ""buddy movie"" about two blue collar guys, one of whom happens to be gay, this 2000 film's low budget atmosphere somehow fits the setting and the characters.  We meet David, a husky womanizer who works as manager of a tiny comedy club, and Jack, a quiet guy who is a carpenter by trade.  Both are in their mid-late 20's.
When Jack's longtime girlfriend moves out, David helps Jack adjust to her absence, and the two friends find a larger apartment to share in the ""low rent"" district of Chicago.  Shortly thereafter, Jack confides in David that, since his girlfriend left, he has been exploring his attractions for men, and has decided he is probably gay.  David is openly supportive, though he has some ""issues"" that get resolved when the two have a talk.  David is also faulted for occasionally being insensitive toward Jack's feelings (like when Jack falls in love with Carlos, a fellow tradesman, and David can't see that is more than ""just sex"" to him).  David grows as a person as well, deciding that he too wants some stability in a relationship, unlike the overlapping affairs with women he has maintained in the past.  One scene - with David drunk and being helped to bed by Jack - made me cringe that the screenwriter was going to go with the stereotypical ""gay roomie seduces straight roomie"" cliche' that one sees too often, but, thankfully, he refrained from that. In the end, both men realize what the other's support and companionship has meant to him, with both good and bad results.
The male leads are played by the two guys who wrote the film (perhaps autobiographical?  Might be revealed on the commentary track, which I didn't listen to.)  The low budget doesn't detract overall, though there are problems with the sound (dialogue lost to background noise in a couple of scenes), and the direction (by one of the writers/actors) tends to spend too much time on ""atmosphere"" shots that do nothing to add to the film.  Of course, there is not much of a plot, but that isn't a problem in a film that is more of a character study of two likeable guys.
I actually give this film extra points for portraying non-stereotypical gay characters. The film may also be somewhat helpful to those dealing with their homosexuality or bisexuality, as Jack talks about his feelings at length with David and others.  The film won the Grand Jury prize at the 2000 Los Angeles ""Out Fest"" (G/L film festival).",1035504000,18,2421,4.699763593380615

1735986,4,B00006ADFI,"A riveting picture, in my book. It was very well acted and the characters felt real and uniquely realized. It also kept me on my toes because it felt so unpredictable  Without divulging too much, I will say that the ending was not what I expected--or even hoped for, but they kept it realistic. Having witnessed David's dead eyes when making love to his female partners [ I probably look that way in the dentist's chair] I sort of expected that he was gay also. Later, I wondered if he just hadn't met the right woman, but those questions remained unanswered. It wasn't a glossy soap opera, but a sort of gritty depiction of gay life in the working class. Well worth a look.",1479168000,4,674,4.435483870967742

1735989,3,B00006ADFI,"I was at first concerned this would be a stereo typed , feeble, sorta kinda wanna be "" gay"" friend tribute film.  but Berkawitz and Redgrave did a very believable job of showing the evolution of a "" straight  to gay"" relationship. The location, setting and ( some of ) the characters were realistic views.
The struggles Redgrave displayed and his friend David ( Ben Berkawitz )  struggle to understand made this memorable. It all comes down to What Are you Really looking for ? Sex or Meaningful , Lasting relationship. Being Honest with yourself and your friends is scary but needed if you are to be TRUE to Everyone. Not the Best Gay Movie I have seen.. however Ben Berkawitz is a Straight Director cranking out a Gay Themed Film for that I give him Kudos for its reality . I prefer the movie ""Leather"" as my Best gay Film.",1475539200,,825,4.450331125827814

You can keep all of your shaved pretty boys. I'll take a real man any day over those fake characters.

  Indeed, this movie is a refreshing change form the perfectly groomed  men and decorator environments of most gay movies. I had not really noted, until now, how foreign those movies are from where I come from, and how alienating to my real self those movies can be.. These,  ""wrong side of the tracks,"" characters,' are a lot more real to me and their development into their awakenings, as well as their clarification to each other of what good friends they are, is very moving for me. I hope there will be more movies like this in the future. But for the shortness of the film, I would have given it a five star rating.",1451692800,10,970,4.463276836158192

1736298,5,B00006ADFI,"Wow! What a gem! Sorry I missed it when it first debuted. Not a new theme by today's standard, but for the time (late 90's), it probably was a bit groundbreaking. It is the powerful acting that captured me. There is much I could say about all the layers and textures of this film. In a nutshell, what we have are two friends, two men, basically struggling with their sexual identity and how to express it in a way that comports with how they see themselves and where they would ultimately like to end-up. One man struggles with the discovery that he is gay, and the other, his best friend, struggles with being straight, i.e., finding a woman who will commit to him, beyond the one-night stand.  Actor Ben Redgrave (Jack) gives a palpably angst-ridden performance as the man coming to terms with himself, his friends and family as he knows beyond a doubt, he is gay. His phone conversation with his mother, is especially powerful. Not wanting to settle for one-night stands alone and cruising bus stations, Jack seeks a stable relationship, but such is a very long journey for some, both gay and straight--as we see in the performance of Ben Berkowitz--David (the film's director, writer), who is in a terrible rut in relationships and work, as well. These friends, both want the same thing--on this, there is no difference between them. Jack (Ben Redgrave, the gay guy) encounters a man with whom he connects on an intellectual level--at first. The man announces at the close of the night together that he is married  with two kids and a wife, but he wants to see Jack again.  Some are shocked by this, yet this is what we know and experience in the real world all the time. Married men and married women, do have same sex attraction and same sex relationships--ALL THE TIME. Human behavior, in all of its complexities is not black and white. And sex, is yet another one of the human facets that sits on a continuum of experience and behavior. Yet, we get so freaked-out when it happens. It is normal. I could go on. But you must know that this film does capture the grit of Chicago's less affluent living conditions of the time and the production is low-budget. I think it adds to the beauty of the struggle of these two guys. Yet, I am certain the same struggle occurs on Lakeside Drive as well.",1440374400,2,2298,4.559322033898305

The chaser is gay and finds the gayness in the ""straight"" man or the straight man finds he is gay by encountering another man in ""that"" way.

1736334,4,B00006ADFI,"This hyper low-budget, rough edged study of a friendship between two men, one straight, one gay is unusual for the honesty with which it shows the layers that men place over their feelings, between each others and even within themselves. The need for love, the use of sex as a distancing device instead of a way of being closer, the confusion of vulnerability and weakness, the use of humor to mask deeper feelings, these traits are rarely examined with much honesty. The same could be said for how male friendship in general functions (and doesn't) as well.

Made in the rough edged, improvised tradition of Casavettes and Mike Leigh, this deserves points for trying. The difference is, both Casavettes and Leigh had access to some of the best actors of their respective days, and while the actors here are willing, they're simply not at that level of depth or talent, meaning that while this has some wonderful moments, there are also some repetitive, or even awkwardly `acted' ones as well.

1736360,4,B00006ADFI,"OK, so I decided to give this low-budget queer film an hour and forty
minutes of my time. I'm always apprehensive about low-budget films,
considering all the Clerks and Reservoir Dog knock-offs during the
'90s...shudder! I'm happy to say Straightman is its own film, and a
good film at that.

Berkowitz is quite charming as David, playing him even-keeled until his
back was against the wall. I thought his take on David was entirely
appropriate--here's a guy who doesn't want to be seen as the good guy
b/c that entails some personal responsibility in his behavior that
maybe he's not equipped to handle at this point in his life. I hope I'm
not off the mark there, but that was my take on him. And when I watched
this scenes with Jack lamenting that his homosexuality was getting in
the way of David's listening skills, I had to laugh. Jack was acting
like a teenager, not realizing that David was merely treating him as a
fellow guy who's getting hung up on a piece of a**...which leads me to
Jack.

What I loved about Jack is that he had regressed emotionally, like a
teenager, after he came out. This is something many of us go
through...it's like you come out in your 20s and have to experience
everything your straight friends have been experiencing for ten
years...so sometimes you feel a bit stunted. At least, most of my
friends and I did. I really loved Redgrave's performance--from coming
out to his mom via phone to freaking out over his lover being seen with
a new man. From a personal standpoint, you do tend to be a bit
possessive of your first, b/c at the time you're sold on the idea of
""one person, the one, for life..."" I suffered for a few years believing
that myth, and essentially, it has been a heterosexual myth that a lot
of gays have adopted in an attempt to feel ""normal."" I can't speak for all, but that's how I feel.

I'm not surprised to see that the script won a prize at Outfest--not an
easy achievement. I recommend the film, as it's one of the few gay
movies that seems real to me, not forced, campy or silly in any way.
Yes it's a bit rough, tight shooting spaces, minor sound issues here
and there--hey, it's an Indie! Berkowitz should be proud of this film,
and if you like queer stories that don't stereotype or have a
soundtrack by La Bouche, rent this film and SUPPORT YOUR INDIE ARTISTS!",1246233600,2,2328,4.460093896713615

It was at times a mess, with poor character development on the female roles - which is a problem with the script, usually. Though this film is very uneven, it was ultimately satisfying.  In the end, the film works.",1502582400,2,512,4.543478260869565

7966110,5,B00006ADFI,"good story. entertaining.

I like this movie. it is somehow ""cute"". The storyline is a more accurate reflexion of what might be happening to one's life. It does not offer a solution of gay relationships or any story morale, but it has its level of sex scenes, romance, drama, the ups and downs of gays  and ""funny"" moments.

The ending is again like any other person's life:  it never ends.",1486857600,,390,4.5285714285714285
7966111,1,B00006ADFI,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen....the acting, the writing, the directing...even the music was in one word...abysmal...I have never in my life hated a movie as much as I did this one...with one exception (and the only reason I gave it even 1-star)...Ben Redgrave...with that handsome face, his pornstash and that beautiful head of hair he was the only reason I did not turn this movie off 60 seconds after it started...his acting was decent I must say...he was the only one who was able to capture my attention and keep it...other than that...the rest of this film blew chunks...I know that this is an independent film and was probably made on a budget of around $1000 but still...I've seen independent films made with the same budget and they were so much superior on every level to this ""film""...I just think that we as a gay community need to really make an effort to step-up our LGBTQ films...those in our community will know what I'm saying...
As far as that triple threat Ben Berkowitz, who co-wrote, acted in, and directed this cinematic failure...all I can say is that I am speechless that he has ever worked in the film industry again...enough said.",1486166400,,1167,4.697560975609756

7966114,4,B00006ADFI,"Just know what to expect before watching. It is really just a stage play that has been redone as a film. Therefore it is heavy on the dialogue, one-to-one interaction, and meaning-of-life / examination of emotions. If you expect that, then it's an okay film. Expect anything else and you will be very disappointed.",1484438400,,314,4.833333333333333
