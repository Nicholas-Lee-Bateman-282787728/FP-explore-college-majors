1884009,3,B00009MED0,"As a longtime fan of Roy Rogers, I was very happy to see what looked like a high quality product available. The extra material on these ""Happy Trails Theatre"" DVD's is excellent and the transfer to DVD is also very good quality. However, as a Roy Rogers ""fanatic"" I would like to see the ""uncut"" version of the movie. In every release from this studio movies that range from 75 to 53 min. are cropped to about 52 min to allow the introductions & interviews to be fit in. Love the extra info but I want the movie intact.",1060560000,7,519,4.252525252525253
1884010,4,B00009MED0,"Roy Rogers discovers that the stepson of his old schoolteacher is riding the outlaw trail.  Working with an unscrupulous cattleman, the young hellion commits murder and mayhem.  What's even worse, the bad guys secretly try to market cattle inflicted with hoof-and-mouth disease.  Roy must work quickly to save the ranchers of Sunset Valley from disaster.
Shortly before he made the the jump to Saturday morning TV in the 1950s, Roy Rogers made a new series of action-packed Westerns for Republic Studios.  Filmed in ""Trucolor,"" these pictures stress hard riding outdoor action rather than the intrusive musical numbers that plagued some of Roy's earlier films.  Astride Trigger, billed as ""The Smartest Horse in the Movies,"" Roy and his friends help the sheriff outshoot the bad guys.  Dale Evans is present, but Bob Nolan and The Sons of the Pioneers gave way to Foy Willing and The Riders of the Purple Sage.  Expect some singing, but not enough to impede the blazing six-guns.  Pat Brady is around as Roy's comic relief sidekick.  The violence is bloodless enough to qualify as ""G"" rated entertainment.  The production values are Grade B, but nobody made Westerns like Republic.  Some of the color tones have a green and blue tint that looks a little odd.  Regardless, relish the nostalgia and introduce today's plugged in kids to the days when the West was really wild.  Enjoy the ride. ;-)",1008633600,7,1394,4.956896551724138
1884021,5,B00009MED0,"Typical RR story line but more plot and a little longer. The color was good and gave more realism to every part of movie.

1884024,2,B00009MED0,"Interesting story--but surprisingly preachy in places--has to do with the disgraced old school ma'rm and her ne'er-do-well son. The print quality is surprisingly good--revealing all the limitations of Republic's two-color Trucolor process. Otherwise, slow moving for a William Witney film, with some badly forced comic relief by the usually amiable Pat Brady. Dale sings the popular song ""Candy Kisses"" and Foy Willing's group provides the Western harmonies, but otherwise, this is not one of Roy's best.",1426032000,,504,5.644736842105263

1884026,5,B00009MED0,"Republics True Color came through well on this presentation.
Not as much blue cast in the overall view. Clear and well done.
If they could have survived they would have rivaled Technicolor.

Roy did his usual best in this film. Good action, Good riding scenes,
Trigger Jr. Did well. And was as it turned out a superior athlete to
his Daddy.
Pat Brady emerged as a single side kick.
Dale Evans(Rogers) Was the usual fem fa-tale",1388707200,2,426,4.605263157894737

The package shows a running time of 63 minutes but that includes the intro and closing comments from Roy and Dale's guests, Gene Autry and Pat Buttram.  Several songs were cut from the movie.

The Trucolor is better than in most Trucolor westerns that I have seen.  However, there are too many vertical black lines in the picture.

Montie Montana is the sheriff.  Good story.",1443830400,,486,4.795180722891566
