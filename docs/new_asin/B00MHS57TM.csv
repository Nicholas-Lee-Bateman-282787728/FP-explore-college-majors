6578620,3,B00MHS57TM,"The sound in the video is terrific. The video quality is terrific. The tone of everything sounds VERY close if not exactly the same as their studio release. There's a reason for that. This is filmed in a studio. Yes, the box says ""Live at the Fidelitorium"" and for all I know they are, in fact, there. To me, live means in front of a crowd like when they recorded ""Colors"" live. That was cool. This looks more like they filmed a practice session and decided to record it. Because there is no crowd, there is no energy for the band to feed off of, and therefor there is no stage presence. Disappointed.",1412899200,3,601,4.327433628318584
6578621,5,B00MHS57TM,I seen them play this album live and this is reliving it again. If you are a BTBAM fan it is a must own. No other band could sound this goodlike that.,1412726400,,150,3.71875
6578622,5,B00MHS57TM,"Awesome performance of an amazing album. Easily one of my favorite bands. Its super cool to see them in this live but very studio setting. Also, flawless performance of some of the most technical music I know of.",1412380800,3,212,4.605263157894737
6578623,5,B00MHS57TM,"BTBAM has been one of my all time favorite bands for a little over a decade now. This blu-ray is a great deal. The only problem is that its 5 dollars cheaper than what i paid for it, a day later...not cool amazon.",1412208000,5,213,3.9767441860465116

6578625,5,B00MHS57TM,"I can understand that the flavor of progressive metal that BTBAM produces can be very polarizing. Personally, I feel that this performance, with the additional musicians and introduction, represent some of the best work from BTBAM. This album/DVD ranges from soft performances that are almost soothing, with spoken word in the background, to the terrifying finale found in ""Silent Flight Parliament"", and the wall of sound that is Telos. I highly recommend this to any heavy metal lover.",1418083200,,487,5.256410256410256
6578626,5,B00MHS57TM,"I've seen Between the Buried and Me twice in the last six months and I still can't get enough. Their musicianship is simply incredible, which they clearly show in this performance.",1417910400,,180,4.838709677419355

8672419,5,B00MHS57TM,"This band is something else. They are on another level. Every single member is exceptional, and as a drummer, Blake Richardson is such an inspiration. If you are a fan, this is a must have!",1488931200,,189,4.428571428571429

8672421,5,B00MHS57TM,"This is literally one of the best albums I have ever heard. I would love to see this album played live in its entirety, however that would be a rare chance of that happening, and even rarer chance of it happening in my home town. I am so glad BTBAM released a live DVD set of this, however this is not your standard DVD!

What sets this DVD performance apart from others is the fact that this is not just a live concert recorded and thrown on a disc. This is more like a sneak peek at BTBAM in the studio, recording the entire album in one take, as a whole band. I love this! If you are a fan of BTBAM, you will not be disappointed in your purchase. They even released one track on YouTube available to watch, just in case you needed one more reason to seal the deal.",1431993600,,767,4.046052631578948
8672422,5,B00MHS57TM,"I only write a review on Amazon when it is a significant thing to be writing about, because frankly, I'm quite lazy. But, that's neither here nor there.

Speaking purely of the studio version of this album, it is absolutely unavoidable that it will be compared to Colors, because they are both epic concept albums that transcend genres, and require lots of attention to fully digest everything that is going on. I have listened to it dozens of times, and I still cannot even comprehend some parts. As a drummer myself, it literally upsets me how good Blake is, but it also inspires me to keep pressing on. The rhythms, with ever changing time signatures, the solos, the vocals, everything about it is truly mind blowing, if you have the attention span to see it all the way through. I stand by the fact that I like Colors  slightly better than this one, not by much, and just because of personal preference, not simply dismissing what they are doing here.

On this release, the live performance of said album, maybe I'm just short sighted when it comes to mere audio consumption of the studio release, but the live representation does fill me in on a closer look of everything that is being done. It really does give me a fresh perspective of the whole thing, and in turn, makes me appreciate it more. What these guys are doing, in my humble opinion, can equate to modern day versions of what classical composers were accomplishing in the 16th and 17th centuries. I know that's a bold statement, but I believe it to be true, despite the fact that is will never be as recognized as classical compositions, which is something I blame purely on the death grip that the fast food/reality TV/ auto tune culture has on our society. This band has released a truly astonishing work of art, and though many may chalk that up as an opinion, I'd like to think that it is a fact that anyone who can't see that, well... it's just going over their head. Five stars, totally and completely. I love these guys, and I cannot wait to see what they put out next.",1430611200,,2043,4.5162162162162165
8672423,5,B00MHS57TM,Awesome band!!!!,1428278400,,16,7.5
8672424,5,B00MHS57TM,"I love this performance. I first found this on Quello and thought maybe I would get the CD. I listened to it non-stop for about a month or so and decided to get the Blu-Ray. After listening to the CD so much, I wanted to compare the live performance and well, these guys are incredible. The musicianship is unbelievable. The performance is pretty much spot on compared to the CD version. There are a couple of spots where the vocals are a little better on the studio version, but that's something I would expect anyhow. Speaking of vocals, there are probably many people that would be turned off by the ""cookie monster"" style of singing. But if you can get past that and focus on the musicianship and performance you will be amazed by these guys. I also really liked the guest musicians that help bring the CD version to the stage (which is really more like a studio). This is more of an intimate style of performance rather than a ""live concert"". I'm glad BTBAM decided to film the performance this way. It really enables the viewer to focus on what the band is doing. As the band says in the making of portion of the video, it allows the viewer to focus on the whichever  musician you want to.  I totally recommend this for anyone who loves good solid performances from musicians that are doing what they do for the music and not the fame.",1425081600,,1341,4.425101214574899
8672425,5,B00MHS57TM,Excelent product and service.,1420761600,,29,6.5
8672426,5,B00MHS57TM,"This is the ultimate video for me.  Shot in the studio it allows you to really appreciate how talented these guys are.  I love that they did not add any special effects, they just let the music speak for itself, something so rarely done now a days!  The band is incredibly almost unbelievably tight through even the most complex sections.  Ant because this was recorded in a studio, the sound quality is stunning.  These guys and Opeth are the Kings of Progressive Metal.  And Amazon has this for sale at amazing price for the 2-disc Bluray and audio CD.",1419638400,,554,4.545454545454546
8672427,5,B00MHS57TM,"A brilliant idea from a brilliant band. Seriously, is there a hotter metal band than BTBAM? Somehow they continue to raise the bar with each album and now you can watch them play what is arguably their mastepiece Future Sequence  Paralax 2 live in the studio. It was nice to be able to just watch these guys play. My only wish was that they included the Paralax 1 songs. If you are a fan of BTBAM then this is a must own.",1418774400,,421,4.134146341463414
8672428,5,B00MHS57TM,"It's BTBAM and it's live.  Sure, it's a different format than Colors Live, but that doesn't take away from the awesome.

Plus, it's pretty awesome that the drummer from the first BTBAM album (Will Goodyear) plays auxiliary percussion on the album, while the saxophonist from Trioscapes also performs on the album.

The ONLY negative (and I say that extremely liberally) is that this was a well-thought-out production, however with all the work they put into the audio and performance quality, they never bothered to think about anything more than a stereo mix.  The format of the ""venue"" and the themes and style of the album would certainly lend themselves well to a 5.1 (or 7.1 on the BluRay) mix.",1418774400,,699,4.848739495798319
