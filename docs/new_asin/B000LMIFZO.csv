8162131,1,B000LMIFZO,"Where to even begin with this turd... the horrible narration (perhaps someone should have gotten the writer and narrator in a room together to go over the correct pronunciation of the words prior to hitting the studio)?  The editing that left nearly-subliminal snippets of shots that didn't quite get removed from the final product?  How about the description of being married in Quark's Bar as the video shows a happy couple float past in a gondola in the Venetian?  No, wait, how about the DVD just quitting out at the 20-minute mark with no actual ending/credits?  I hesitate to mention that perhaps my copy was defective, but I instead saw it as sweet release from this DVD that the Las Vegas Tourism Council would be too ashamed to mail out free to potential visitors.  There was as much structure to this as your typical David Lynch production.  It gave you glimpses and highlights of casinos along the strip with little rhyme or reason as to the order, and often you ended up viewing a different casino with no segue whatsoever.  Especially the reviews of restaurants with no context as to which casino that they were housed.  I have to stop now, as I'm desperately trying to purge the memory of this atrocity from my mind, and I could conceivably spend all night writing about the number of things that are wrong with this production.  If you still feel compelled to see this godawful documentary despite my advice to the contrary, rest assured, my copy will be among those available, as it is going back in tomorrow's mail.",1204675200,,1532,4.707865168539326
8162132,3,B000LMIFZO,"I am in the process of planning our 2nd trip to Vegas. As there is a lot to see and do, I had purchased this DVD in an attempt to better plan our 2nd trip so as to see many of the sites we missed the 1st time. Unfortunately, this DVD just quickly glossed over the highlights without going into any form of detail. For instance; I am interested in what the different themed hotels have to offer and was hoping at a closer look at them. I would have liked to have seen the different pools, rooms, themed attractions, and other amenities. The DVD just did a quick ""fly by"" over many of the hotels which just showed the exterior. Much of that was shown wasn't any different than what most people have already seen watching CSI or Cops on TV. The shows, area attractions, and other points of interest were presented in the same fashion. Actually, many shows were completely left out.

  If you have never been to Vegas and would like a quick tour, this isn't a bad start. But if you are planning a trip, and are attempting to gain a better insight as to which sites interest you, this DVD is seriously lacking.",1174953600,,1105,4.302884615384615
