1350868,5,B00004TJK1,This is one of my granddaughters favorite Bear videos. She love when Doc sings.  She sings along with him and dances. It is wonderful to watch her. I highly recommend this video.,980294400,,178,4.5625
1350869,5,B00004TJK1,"I was so pleased to see this video released!  When my toddler and I first saw the episodes on Disney, they provided wonderful opportunities to  discuss trips to the doctor and what my child could expect.  Now that we  have the video, we make a point of watching it before any doctor's  appointment.  One of the episodes deals with ""emergency""  trips to the doctor when Tutter hurts his tail.  The other episode stresses  the importance of preventive medicine - Doc Hogg pays a visit to the Big  Blue House to give everyone check-ups.  Of course, these wouldn't be  Bear shows if they didn't have catchy little tunes.  The songs in these  episodes are wonderful.",965865600,8,661,4.684210526315789

1350880,5,B00004TJK1,"This is a great video for little ones to understand about doctor visits and especially getting shots. They explain that they wil feel a little something but by the time they said ""ouch"" it will be over. This video along with a little play Dr. kit that she got for Christmas I believe will be very helpful in understand Dr. visits. I would advise any parents of toddlers to buy this video.",1359072000,,388,4.402777777777778

1350885,5,B00004TJK1,"BBB is the best, keeps little ones busy for hours and teaches them lots of useful things at the same time. Visiting the Doctor is good because it teaches them not to be affraid of the doctor. A must have with the rest of the Bear collection. Potty time is the best!",1173139200,,265,4.115384615384615
1350886,5,B00004TJK1,"We purchased the older DVD that is just like this and as parents we love bear and the gang.  Old Doc Hog is really funny.  Bear really knows how to communicate with the children.  My son and daughter love him and they have enjoyed him since they were less than a year.  Both of my children (4 years and 14 mo) were first attracted to the song at the end of the show, sung by Bear and Luna (the moon).  It is one of the best shows and I really enjoy watching bear myself.  It is a DVD that can be enjoyed over and over again.  I also recommend the Shapes, Sounds and Colors which is the first one I would recommend for a young child around one or younger to start with, then this DVD would be a definate for your DVD collection.  But all the Bear DVDS and Videos are wonderful and funny even for a parent.  You just can't get enough of Bear and his friends.  You'll really enjoy watching it with your children.  If you want to get a taste of this show check out the Disney Channel schedule (playhouse Disney) early in the morning. Athough there is nothing better than watching it at your own convenience which is why we have collected all of the DVD's.  So we can watch Bear anytime.  Check it out, you won't be sorry.",1114214400,,1217,4.14957264957265
1350887,5,B00004TJK1,"My daughter is almost 3 and LOVES Bear in the Big Blue House. This DVD is more substantial than a lot of other children's DVD's out there... it's got this Montessori-ish way of teaching kids, i.e. not focusing so much on ABC's and stuff, but preparing children for life. It also is longer than most DVD's, and of higher quality as well. The singing is very good (especially Shadow) and the atmosphere of the DVD is relaxing and soothing on the whole. I am glad I gave it a try for my daughter, and couldn't be more pleased with how much she loves it and the quality of the content.",1061164800,4,581,4.290909090909091
1350888,5,B00004TJK1,"We love bear in our house and especially on the DVD format. It is the only way to go with kids movies. The added features the DVD verion offers makes it worth the few extra dollars. It has sing a longs and  3 story selections which make it great when you are trying to make a squirmy toddler sit still. Quick and easy and totally cute. My son love the ""everybody say ah"" and the "" hello doctor song"" we had to play them over and over and over again. A good buy with three great episodes and awesome happy songs.",1018051200,8,511,4.0594059405940595
1350889,5,B00004TJK1,"My two year old just loves ""Big House"" as he calls it, and likes this one better than any of the others we own, including Blues Clues and Elmo, which is saying a lot!! He actually ASKS to go to the doctor's office after watching it. If I need to do any housework, I just put the show in, and don't have to worry about him getting bored. It is awesome!!",1010188800,5,352,3.971830985915493

Easily viewed in two 25-minute segments. Enjoyed it, would watch again. ""Bear helped Ojo. I love Bear."" ""It teaches everyone not to be afraid to go to the doctor."" ""I wonder if my doctor likes to go to the doctor?"" ""I thought the little rats getting their checkups were cute."" Ages 2-5.",1000339200,,455,4.846153846153846
