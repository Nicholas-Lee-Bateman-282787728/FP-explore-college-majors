2289370,5,B0009GV9KU,"My daughter started watching this video when she was 19 months old and it's been wonderful. At first she mostly watched and just did a few of the movements, but now at 21 months she can follow along with most of it. She especially loves the freeze dance (which really helps with listening skills and following directions) and the cowboy dance (which she calls ""Yee-haw""). This DVD has been great as we've been stuck inside a lot this winter and it gets her (and sometimes me!) moving.",1234915200,2,484,4.574712643678161
2289371,5,B0009GV9KU,"We got this for my daughter for her 2nd Birthday because she loves to dance - she watches very little TV and if she does watch is only interested if it is real people and especially kids dancing, so this was the perfect find for what I was seeking for her.  She LOVES it, and requests it most every day.  It is amazing, so much fun and so cute to watch her do all the little routines along with the video, and she just beams!  The kids are all a little older than her and I at first thought maybe the video would be a little advanced, but after the first time through, she started doing the moves along with them and did more and more each time, and now she does everything and anticipates the movements and sayings coming next!  It has taught her many fun skills, dance moves, and words, and she likes to show what she has learned even when the video is not on!  There is a freeze dance, maraca dance, scarf dance, cowboy hat dance, ballet, and some stretching routines, all led by a cheery instructor who is engaging to kids and followed by several boys & girls around ages 3-5.  Highly recommended for good exercise, learning and fun for kids, especially age 2-5+.  Even fun for adults to do with their kids!",1193702400,10,1211,4.285087719298246
2289372,5,B0009GV9KU,"My girls love this dvd.  My 3yr old comes home from school in the afternoon takes off her clothes put on a skirt and pops in the dvd. When my 5yr old comes home from school they do the same thing over again and it's party time. They have watched this dvd soooo many times that they know it by heart, and if they can't find it there is a problem. They are learning so many skills, the most exciting one is I was trying to show my 3yr old how to skip this summer and she couldn't get it and because of the dvd she does and she is so excited about it that she skips in school. Their imagination is expanding.",1192665600,4,605,3.9186991869918697
2289373,5,B0009GV9KU,This is by far and beyond the best kids dance video I have ever used.,1165104000,3,69,3.6666666666666665
2289374,5,B0009GV9KU,My 20 month old is hooked an this. Over the last 2 mos she has learned about 70% of the choreography. She does the moves even when just playing.,1388361600,,144,4.0
2289375,5,B0009GV9KU,"so the lady that teaches this dance thing... is sooooooo annoying over acts and is so weird to me BUT my daugher is 19months old and loves music and to dance and she doesnt watch cartoons only kids and or babies. so this works out perfect. its short they do a few dances. freeze dance, cowboy dance(her favorite)ballet, stretching, scarf dance and i think one more. she watches this literally 25-30 x a day so i highly recommend for your baby/toddler",1387843200,2,450,4.567901234567901
2289376,1,B0009GV9KU,"I really hoped this would be a great way to get our little one interested in dancing to music but it turned out to be one of the most horrible DVD's we have purchased for our little one so far. The instructor is trying WAY too hard to be cute. It ended up coming across as very cheesy, contrived and dippy. The look on my husband's face when he first saw this was - utterly horrified. As some others mentioned there really is very little dancing. It is mainly floor activities (that aren't very good/interesting/inspiring). I hope I will find something with a little more of a professional polish and a LOT more dancing. Until then, there are plenty of youtube videos with better examples of babies/toddlers dancing for a little one to learn from. I know babies that have never had any dance DVDs or lessons and still dance better than what you will see on this thing (in other words, they can do better using just their instincts).

In the end, we cut it up to use the pieces for a crafting project. I can't say that about any of the other DVD's we have purchased for our little girl; unfortunately most of them do not get her moving around so our hunt for good indoor ""exercise"" DVDs will have to continue.

Would give it zero stars if I could.",1386979200,,1246,4.366379310344827
2289377,2,B0009GV9KU,"i got this for my niece because she loves to dance, but this video doesnt really have a lot of dancing....more floor activity then up and around dancing.",1355529600,2,153,4.5
2289378,5,B0009GV9KU,"I don't do many reviews, but I love this one enough to take the the time to encourage other mommies to get this for 20 minutes of guilt free tv for your toddler. My 21 month old LOVES it, she ask to watch ""Dance"" all the time. She can do most of the dance moves and smiles the whole time. I'll be getting this for every 2 year old birthday gift from now on.",1344297600,,357,3.8378378378378377
2289379,4,B0009GV9KU,"My 22 month old daughter was just starting to show interest in dancing, so this DVD was put on her Christmas list. She and her almost 4 year old brother love it. After their first viewing my little boy asked to watch it again right away, but because my daughter has a shorter attention span, she wasn't as interested the second time around - only participating occasionally. Both have come to love watching this DVD again and again. My son can easily follow the directions, but my daughter still needs more guidance from me. The run time is approximately 35 minutes and our copy also has the option of watching it in Spanish. (Our copy was purchased at a store called Creative Kidstuff.)

As another reviewer states, Ms. Theresa is rather perky - obnoxiously so.  I can tune her out, but if your child watches it over and over, it may get on your nerves more. Technically I found it a little annoying that the camera stayed zoomed in on Ms. Theresa's face so much, so the viewer can't see exactly what she is doing with her body. But it is just a minor annoyance for me - my kids don't seem to care.

It should also be noted that they suggest you have maracas, a light weight scarf and a cowboy hat. If you don't have maracas you can always use rattles, bells or something else that makes noise when you shake it. If you don't have a scarf, a bandana or other small piece of fabric will work. As for the cowboy hat, you don't need that at all, unless your child REALLY wants to look like the kids on the DVD. I don't recall them really using it in the dance.

Over all it's a fun, easy to follow dance video that is perfect for the dancing preschooler in your life.",1325548800,4,1665,4.292993630573249
2289380,5,B0009GV9KU,"I have 3 and 5 year old girls, and they absolutely LOVE this DVD.  I first checked it out at my local library and my girls kept asking for it long past when I had returned it, so I went ahead and bought it for one of their birthday's.  It does not mention in the description that there are items you will need when doing the DVD.  A hat, a scarf and maracas.  They can certainly just pretend like my girls did, because we didn't have all of those items, but now we do have all the items and they seem to enjoy it even more with all of the props.  This is a great way to teach them to use their imaginations and learn to stretch.  Yes, Ms. Theresa is very perky, but I think that is what keeps my girls attention. I don't think she is over the top.",1318032000,2,747,3.9139072847682117
2289381,5,B0009GV9KU,"I purchased this video for my granddaughters, who are 3 and 2 years old.  They absolutely love it.  It is now one of their favorite! The instructor is quite engaging and perfect for their ages. The dances and exercises are simple and repetitive making them easy to follow. We did have to purchase maracas for the maraca dance, although a rattle would have worked. The rhythm and music are fun to listen too. This is really a video for babies unlike others that are way to much instruction and less music and dance.  Even little boys can enjoy this video. We all enjoy watching them dance and wiggle.",1316476800,,599,4.527777777777778
2289382,2,B0009GV9KU,"I just thought it was worth mentioning that the instructor for this DVD, ""Ms. Teresa,"" is one of those super-perky people with a serious child-woman vibe going on. My partner and I literally could not be in the same room as my children while it was playing, her demeanor was too nails-on-a-blackboard for us. Yes, my kids didn't seem to mind but I'd really like to find a DVD that we can watch together. Or at least one that doesn't make me cringe.",1309564800,5,448,4.409638554216867
2289383,5,B0009GV9KU,"My girls, ages 3 and 4 1/2 have loved this video for over a year now. It keeps them entertained, makes dancing fun, and gives me a little break (without the guilt of sitting them on the couch.) I can't rave enough about it! I am starting to buy it for gifts now. Highly recommend!",1260316800,,280,4.109090909090909

We would get it from the library and she would watch it everyday and dance around.  I bought this one to take to our Homeschool co-op for the little girls there to do!  I will pass it on to my niece now:)",1479600000,,316,3.90625
8060319,5,B0009GV9KU,"Every child I have showed this DVD to has loved it!  The parents were as equally taken with the DVD as the children were. It was a lot of floor activity but it motivated the children to engage themselves, laugh and have fun. I have been looking for 2 more copies. Well Done!",1469664000,,274,4.169811320754717

8060321,5,B0009GV9KU,"My daughter (2) and her friends (1-3 years old) LOVE Baby Dance. They beg for it, and thoroughly enjoy it every time. They never seem to tire of it.",1460160000,,148,4.137931034482759
8060322,5,B0009GV9KU,"Our 2 yr old grandaughter loves this cd (we had borrowed from library) and interacts and dances more each time she watches it.  I was very happy to have found it to purchase. Then our 6 yr old grandaughter and 3 yr old grandson watched it with the 2 yr old - what dancing! They loved it and were all laughing, dancing, and were having a great time. We made ""maracas"" with beans in a container, which they liked as they made their own.""

8060325,5,B0009GV9KU,I bought this for my 3-year old granddaughters and they play it all the time.  Sometimes they want adults to be with them and sometimes they just go off and play themselves.  Definitely recommend.,1393545600,,196,4.735294117647059
