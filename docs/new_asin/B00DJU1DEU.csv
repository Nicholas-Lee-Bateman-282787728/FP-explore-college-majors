8593855,5,B00DJU1DEU,There are three separate segments of yoga each about 21-22 minutes and sadsana for five minutes.  The workouts are intermediate and advanced.  I had to learn the accent before having an effective session.  It's rare to find Kriya yoga in a DVD format so I really appreciate this.,1447459200,7,279,4.770833333333333
