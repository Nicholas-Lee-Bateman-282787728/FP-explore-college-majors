8197336,2,B000QU2ZJI,"Here's what I expected.

""Now for the chorus. Here's the first lick. [Plays two measures]. So we play a C#m7 chord on the four-and, then slide on the third string up to the E on beat one...Let's work with that a couple of times. Now on to the second lick...""

Here's what I actually got:

""Now for the chorus. Put your finger(s) here and pick the string(s) twice. Now slide up to here. Pick the string three times... [2 minutes later] Okay, now that I've gone through the whole chorus, I'll play it for you. [Plays 8 measures] Now let's run the backing track.""

Perhaps a slight exaggeration, but not by much. Suffice it to say, I found this DVD to be a tough slog, at least with the rhythm parts. If all you care about is solos, then you may be okay...but you'll be hitting the FF button a lot. My suggestion: Just by a book of tablature and listen to the recording.",1393632000,,867,4.2682926829268295
8197337,3,B000QU2ZJI,"The author shows only simplifyed versions of the Dark Side of the Moon of small portions of music tracks for playing. Furthermore, the CD does not come with the backing tracks to practice. It's useful only...",1380672000,,208,4.805555555555555
8197338,1,B000QU2ZJI,"I own this DVD and it really sucks!!! Please, do not buy it!!! There's a lot of wrong stuff!!!
I wish I could rate with no stars at all, but it isn't possible...",1249516800,6,161,3.909090909090909
8197339,1,B000QU2ZJI,"Although this DVD has received good reviews so far, I'm going to have to go against the grain and give it a poor rating. It's worth no more than $10. Unlike other DVD guitar teaching tools out there, this is a one-man show and it seems pretty low-budget. Nate LaPointe is nice enough but he comes off as a mere college student who happens to play guitar and who happens to know most (but NOT all) of Dark Side of the Moon. At this price and with the good reviews it's received so far, I would have expected a flawless teaching performance by a superb player. Many of the rhythm sections are ridiculously inaccurate. For instance, in teaching the very first song, ""Breathe,"" for the chorus section of the song, LaPointe instructs us to play Cmaj7, Bmin, Fmaj7, open G, Dmin, Eb/G. This is way off. The correct chord progression is Cmaj7, Bmin7, Fmaj7, barred G, D7#9, D7b9. Those differences are very important! Other rhythm sections have mistakes here and there also but I don't have the time to detail every one.

The one area in which the DVD is slightly useful is in its solos. Even if you know which notes are fretted in the solos from having memorized a tabbed version of them, LaPointe can help you get the timing right when performing them. Here again, however, his performance leaves something to be desired because his Stratocaster does not have a tremolo arm (whammy bar) attached at the bridge, and Gilmour made (and indeed always makes) special use of the tremolo arm to do many of his vibratos.

Overall, I'm very disappointed with the quality of the DVD and I would be hesitant to purchase another from the same teacher.",1238457600,13,1634,4.592465753424658
8197340,5,B000QU2ZJI,"I was struggling with learning from tabs/music, but REALLY wanted to get some Gilmour solos nailed.  This DVD really works  -  thanks to Nate I can now blast out the solos for Money & Time just about note perfect :-)))  I wish he'd bring out another dvd covering The Wall because I'm kinda stuck halfway through Comfortably Numb",1230595200,2,328,4.603448275862069
8197341,5,B000QU2ZJI,"I've played guitar for 30 years, am a HUUUGE Pink Floyd fan, and thought I had this stuff down about as good as it could be played. But I actually copped a few great riffs off this instructional which enhanced and improved the sound of my renditions. It's a well done - perhaps the best - instructional for playing these songs on guitar. I definitely recommend it. Is it just me, or is Wish You Were Here the greatest album of all time? I'd love to see a companion in this series for that album! May the Floyd be with you!",1229472000,2,522,4.178217821782178
8197342,5,B000QU2ZJI,"This is an excellent product. It goes song by song teaching every single guitar part on each of them. And that includes the solos on ""time"" and ""money"" , entirely. What Mr. Lapointe does is taking each song and going from the first guitar note to the last to teach how to play every part, riff by riff, arpeggio by arpeggio, at normal and slow speed, then you can play along with the accompanying band and practice what you've just learned, over and over if you want. Simply great!!!",1224547200,2,483,4.438202247191011
8197343,4,B000QU2ZJI,"Excellent tool for learning the techniques and licks of this album, author should do a few other.  Highly recommended.",1200700800,3,118,5.2105263157894735
8197344,5,B000QU2ZJI,"This is a really great way to learn songs from the album. Well-laid out and easy to track. Having the ability to see and hear, and to understand ways to think about the music and material is terrific. This has made my learning come much easier. It's like having a teacher in the room with me.",1187827200,2,292,4.232142857142857
8197345,5,B000QU2ZJI,"Nate Lapointe is an excellent instructor. He clearly explains and shows what he is doing. The DVD runs 1 hour & 24 minutes.  To cover all songs on the album, he has to move along, but he accomplishes this without being rushed. He covers both the chords as well as the leads. A must for any Pink Floyd fan. Far superior to the Black Sabbath Legendary Licks DVD (also from Cherry Lane), which only features portions of the songs. Nate teaches you to play the entire song. Highly recommended.",1184457600,7,489,4.49438202247191
