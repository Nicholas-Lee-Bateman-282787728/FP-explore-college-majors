7991250,5,B00009L4U7,Watched this movie multiple times and it still keeps me on the edge of my seat.  It is from 2002 but feels very relevant to our time. Great performance from well known actors such as Shaun Taub ( Homeland) and Shohreh Aghdashloo ( academy award nominee). Maryam is the way to go if you are looking for an entertaining and informative movie.,1412035200,,340,4.483870967741935
7991251,5,B00009L4U7,"I typically don't write reviews for films.  My personal preferance is to leave the reviews to professional critics.  To be honest, I've never even wrote a yelp review when I have dined at several horrible restaurants.  However, when it comes to this film I feel compelled to tell you how I felt.

I'm an Iranian American who never had to grow up in the times that Maryam did.  Both my parents just told me stories of living in the land of the free where for a brief moment they didn't feel so free.

Maryam takes you through a personal journey of a teenager who's woes go deeper than ones of a normal teenager.  The acting in this film was superb.  You can even find some comic relief from some people in the film.  Maryam is an important film & I suggest you watch it.",1402963200,,769,4.284722222222222
7991252,5,B00009L4U7,Loved this film. This movie did a great job depicting the daily struggles of an Iranian American during the revolution. One of the things I enjoyed the most about the film was the music selection. The team that made this movie knew what they were doing and as a result made a film that kept you engaged from start to finish. Two thumbs up!,1402790400,,339,4.3125
7991253,5,B00009L4U7,"Any member of the Iranian diaspora who remembers the tumultuous years of the Iranian revolution will instantly identify with this beautifully made film; all others will be touched by the delicate handling of the message that human beings are at their best when they finally allow their compassion, sympathy and tolerance transcend their political views or religious beliefs.  It's a must see for anyone interested in human nature.",1402185600,,430,5.323529411764706
7991254,5,B00009L4U7,This film provides a realistic lens for the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  The carefully selected news footage coupled with the coming of age story for a teenage girl encourages the reader to experience various perspectives during this complicated time in history.  I use this film in my ninth grade English class as a companion to Marjane Satrapi's graphic memoir Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood.,1388102400,,397,5.1875
7991255,5,B00009L4U7,A beautifully crafted story setting a family drama against the backdrop of international events.  Great performances from the main characters and a convincing evocation of the era.  Explores a lot of issues about what it means to be American. This rocks.,1104883200,2,254,5.170731707317073
7991256,3,B00009L4U7,"From a film-maker's perspective, there's nothing to recommend about ""Maryam."" Some reviewers have compared it to an ABC After-School Special (the ultimate insult) and I can see where they're coming from. This is movie-making by the numbers, with a low budget, adequate-but-not-great acting, and the occasional moment of melodrama.
The story itself, however, is somewhat interesting. Maryam is an Iranian-American who is fully and happily Americanized. Life becomes difficult, however, when her Iranian cousin comes to stay with her family. He's somewhat radical in his Islamic beliefs and between his inability to adapt to the American culture and the concurrent historical events (the taking of the American hostages by the Iranian government) it suddenly becomes very difficult for Maryam to blend in.
As someone who's very interested in cultural issues and international relations, I mostly enjoyed the movie. It was never great, but was often interesting enough to keep my attention. The ending, however, does go a little over-the-top as the Islamic cousin decides to sneak into a hospital and try to kill the former Shah of Iran. That, and the scenes of him waving his gun around like a lunatic seemed a tad bit silly. But, overall, the movie was good.
For those of you who are interested in seeing Iran from a fresh perspective, however, I STRONGLY recommend a book (graphic novel, actually) titled ""Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood."" Persepolis is the autobiography of Marjane Satrapi, an Iranian woman who was just a girl when the Shah was deposed and the Iran/Iraq war began. ""Persepolis"" is everything that ""Maryam"" wants to be but isn't.",1080172800,6,1652,5.191011235955056
