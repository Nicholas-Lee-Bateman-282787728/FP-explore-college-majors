8639817,5,B00I8CF9US,"Bought this for my father for Father's Day, and he and I were very impressed. Great video with great visuals of the rifles and a little history on the men who owned them (Hemmingway, Elmer Keith, ect..). I would recommend this to anyone who is into big bore, African hunting, or a (historic) firearms enthusiast in general.",1434844800,,323,4.684210526315789

8639819,5,B00I8CF9US,This book went into great detail on many of the hunters and guns they used. I have read many articles over the years about these great hunters but to actually see a video on these guns and to actually see them used again is priceless.,1396828800,,234,4.222222222222222
