7507848,5,B017L9NBX0,"Simply put, NXT is an amazing product. It has the heart of ECW and the resources of WWE. The fans are truly passionate when chanting ""NXT!! NXT!!"". The athlete are young, usually very experienced in the indies, hungry to prove themselves, and are actually GIVEN the enough room to put on classic match-ups the way we went them to, and they want to, without TV time constraints, sponsorship influence, or pressure from shareholders. There's no shame of being a fan of NXT, even though it's a WWE product, their developmental 'minor leagues' essentially.

I'm not gonna pretend I've seen all of the matches on here, as I was mostly in the dark about it before the launch of the WWE Network. But the ones I have seen stick in my memory greatly and hold up next to any of the great pro wrestling moments/matches I have ever seen.
Like Nattie vs. Charlotte with the legendary Ric Flair and Bret Hart in their respective corners. This match and event was the first NXT Show I watched live. What an eye opener for just how great a women's match can be!!! I'm not kidding, this was a real paradigm shift for me and a match that will stick with me forever. Flair and Hart there add all the more prestige and nostalgia for me also.
Cesaro vs. Sami Zayn in a 2 out of 3 falls match was the only pre-WWE Network match I ever watched... that's because of all the buzz it was getting online as a potential Match of the Year. It was always my introduction to the ""Swiss Superman"" Cesaro as well. I love the guy, he reminds me of an old school throwback type wrestler with unbelievable work-rate, strength, and technique. Can't want to watch his match with Regal on this compilation, which was called ""the best NXT Match of the Year"" at the time.

There's great variety and almost everything you could want on this collection so far. It does a great job of covering the origins, from Rollins winning the belt, a rare appearance by CM Punk teaming with Rollins, to Bo Dallas before he was a forgotten 2-minute comedy act on Raw, to the beginnings of the Women's division, to the ultra unique NXT Championship match in Sumo Hall in Tokyo, Japan.

Enjoy the ride and please support NXT! Show the WWE what kind of product we fans actually want!!!

7507857,5,B017L9NBX0,"NXT is a reminder that one of those ""Ws"" in WWE stands for wrestling. I appreciate the characters and storylines, but they're second to the unbelievable athleticism and work rate that comprises NXT. What you get here is a 2-disc collection containing some of the most incredible matches to occur over the last couple of years.

What's great about this collection is that it showcases several different wrestling styles. You'll see high flyers, ring technicians, ground and pounders, but best of all: no 20-minute promos or empty promises. Say what you will about Triple H, but he *gets* it. NXT is a display of his showrunning acumen, and shows you just how good WWE could be if Vince McMahon would release his out of touch death grip on the company and retire. Talk about best for business.

It's also worth noting that if you're not a believer in Women's wrestling, NXT will change your perception. Forget all those years of ridiculous cat fights and bra & panties matches WWE shoved down our throats as ""entertainment"" all those years. Sasha Banks, Bayley, Becky Lynch, and Charlotte are as legit as they come, and rival their male counterparts in every way. Need proof? Skip right to Sasha vs. Bayley from Takeover: Brooklyn, the true Match of the Year from 2015.

My only complaint with this collection is that WWE edited out Seth Rollins' Curb Stomp. I can appreciate why the company is sensitive about the move, but to go back and edit Seth's old matches as if it never existed is beyond stupid. Edit it from TV, fine, but if I'm purchasing a collection, I deserve to get the original uncut matches.",1458432000,18,1606,4.728571428571429
7507858,5,B017L9NBX0,"We are NXT!

For those who don't know, NXT is WWE's ""developmental"" brand, developmental in quotes because this is better than what the main roster has going.  The WWE is using NXT to bring together top indie free agents from ROH, NJPW, TNA, and others to compete against each other, gain notoriety before the main roster jump, and when they do make the jump, they're already pushed to the point they can be used in major storylines.  NXT is a more intimate and substantive product than Raw or Smackdown.  Everyone on the roster is either actively going through what amounts to wrestling college (so the students are busting their asses to pass their tests ie. they got the hunger) or they're already so good they've been brought in to teach the developmental talents.  Guys like Finn Balor, Samoa Joe, and Shinsuke Nakamura (who is a WON Hall of Famer and probably the best living wrestler today) are all part of NXT, and all are better than the vast majority of WWE's main roster.

This collection is a documentary detailing the rise of NXT, with several matches throughout, with awesome wrestlers like Cesaro, Sami Zayn, Kevin Owens, Sasha Banks, Neville, Finn Balor, and more.  And it's an awesome collection, with every match being at least good, and several being all-time classics (Zayn-Neville and Bayley-Banks being the main two that come to mind, the latter being almost definitely the greatest women's match of all-time).  You also get a couple insane house show matches (Itami-Breeze is a gem, and for CM Punk fans who don't follow Japanese wrestling, an informative match, as Itami is the originator of Punk's GTS) that before now have not been available, and won't be available anywhere else.

My gripes are very minor.  American Alpha should've been on here, but Vol. 2 will likely rectify that.  I would've liked to see more tag stuff in general.  The early matches aren't that amazing, focusing more on showing titles changing hands than showing great wrestling (I get the importance of the inaugural title match, but Jinder Mahal ain't good).  But things pick up with a couple of Cesaro classics then it's full steam ahead.

All in all, this might be the best thing that WWE has put out.  These guys are the future and with WWE's present looking grim, at least this almost guarantees a bright future.  We'll probably get a second volume with American Alpha, Samoa Joe, Nakamura, Austin Aries, and Asuka next year too.  NXT is the most exciting thing in NA wrestling right now (NJPW is king forever, of course) and every serious wrestling fan should have this in their collection.

7507865,5,B017L9NBX0,"""I felt like we could be more than developmental"" was the words stated & mindset of Triple H when he took over a WWE show that had become completely irrelevant & combined it with their own developmental brand that at times couldn't give away enough tickets to fill up all the seats in the warehouse they were running out of into what was become their own international brand with a cult following to the point where they're selling out shows in the same arenas that WWE are holding their own major shows (Takeover: Brooklyn the night before SummerSlam) & international tours (the recent Takeover: London special) in what can be summarized in the statement, ""We Are NXT.""  This is the first volume of the history of the brand since it's relaunch in 2012 in Florida at Full Sail University highlighting the core members of it's roster along with significant matches & moments such as highlights of NXT's involvement in WrestleMania 31 & The Arnold Classic, Tyler Breeze's music video, and Bray Wyatt's farewell speech on the Blu-Ray.

Matches Include:
NXT Championship Match: Seth Rollins vs. Jinder Mahal - This was the finals of the Gold Rush tournament to determine the first NXT Champion as Seth controlled Jinder early with wrestling & using his own momentum against him causing Jinder to resort to dirty tactics & taking advantage of the ringside environment allowing him to heavily ground Seth heavily working over his lower back to the point where Seth showed signs of it even when performing his own offense as they traded momentum with Jinder continuing to focus on Seth's weakened back while Seth resorted to his high flying offense from the top rope & springboard positions resulting in a competitive match & definitely the best Jinder Mahal performance you'll ever see on DVD.
As a side note, it should be noted that the match has been edited as they've removed Rollins' ""Blackout"" curb stomp.
""NXT"" Aug. '12
[The Destruction Of The Shield]

No Disqualification Match: NXT Champion Seth Rollins vs. Big E Langston - Seth was a member of The Shield at this time with Langston easily shrugging off any attempt by Seth & using his power to his advantage before Seth took advantage of the match stipulation whenever possible to regain the advantage in his favor & using a strategy to neutralize his power in a match that was more about about pushing the storyline than a quality match.
""NXT"" Jan. '13

Chris Jericho vs. Bray Wyatt - A year before their more well know feud against each other, they met for the first time here with Jericho dominate early including playing some games of his own to reduce one of Bray's advantages only for Bray to use another advantage he had to his advantage to keep Jericho grounded as they traded momentum with Jericho going aerial & leaving his feet various times while Bray used his body as a weapon & any other advantages he could that didn't always work out in his favor.

NXT ArRival '14

NXT Womens Championship Match: Charlotte vs. Natalya - This was the finals of the second tournament to crown a new champion after Paige forfeited the championship with the special attraction of Bret Hart & Ric Flair in their family member's corner with both women having the same tactics early on before one was able to get the advantage with different submissions causing a reaction that made the the match get more personal as more submissions were used in a manner than hadn't been seen more along with executing the same moves against each other & taking risk we hadn't seen before with various counters & reversals in what was a very competitive technical based encounter.

NXT Takeover: Respect '15

Triple H has said time & time again on the record on how this was originally viewed as developmental in a negative light into his own strong brand to the point where they're selling out shows & doing their own international tours by giving the fans something different than what you have seen on the ""bigger stage"" which is heavily showcased here as it's impossible to get every single quality or important encounter onto the first volume of this set but I felt like they delivered here with the matches chosen along with the nice bonuses of never before seen encounters including matches outside of Full Sail so this I highly recommend.",1452902400,5,15956,4.646224742998936

Nxt had created some superstars like the sheild roman reigns , dean ambrose , seth rollins to the wyatts bray and luke&Erick and others what i like about nxt is they have rivals and stories but they focus more on wrestling and little bit of sport entertianment. Nxt has build a great divison for women wrestling and made stars like paige and sasha banks, becky lynch and bailey and others to refuel wwe divas divison for the future . They also have made a great tag team divison of young fresh talented superstars and single compeitors as well some get called up to main roster that a great thing but only a few do well like the wyatts and sheild and kevin owens and the new day big e and woods and rusev and the ones not so great konnor and victor , adrian neville, bo dallas , tyler breeze , lucha dragons . the women of nxt to the main roster are doing fair So nxt is where talents can shine and make a name for themselves i hope they make another single championship in the future beside the nxt championship and tag and womens. This dvd/bluray proves why nxt is the foundation and the future of the wwe and you will see what others have watched on every wensday and the ppv on the network and the wwe picked the best of the best matches to show the rest of wwe universe why it's 1# and for the die hard nxt fans they can hold a piece of history of their favorite match of nxt to watch forever. so if you don't own the network get this you will be a fan and start chanting nxt nxt nxt and others  who do we want this because we love the show and the matches they have given us it's been awesome for two years since network been available since jan 2014 .",1449446400,,1754,4.128654970760234
