7020810,4,B00TRAO6IG,"Yves Montand gives one of his finest performances in the political thriller ""The Confession,"" made by Costa-Gravas. The movie is about a Communist official in Czechoslovakia who is arrested and charged with being a traitor to the country. The movie focuses on his time in prison and the authority's tireless efforts to get him to confess to crimes. The story is based on a true story, and I have read the movie was banned from many Communist countries when it was first released in 1970. After viewing the film, I can understand why....as Communists are depicted as villains. However, I read the director's comments on the movie, and he says he wanted to portray both the West and The East as equally flawed, which I found quite interesting. This movie made me think quite a bit about geopolitics and I credit Costa-Gravas for taking on this ambitious project.",1443744000,2,860,4.8175675675675675

7020812,4,B00TRAO6IG,"Exceptionally clear focus on the moral depravity of the forced confession and the way the revolution consumes its own, while demanding they accept its judgments completely.
It is very intense and in some ways uncomfortable, as it should be, but, compared to the more varied pace achieved in State of Siege (the enclosed feeling achieved in The Confession is entirely appropriate, of course), the result is a less watchable film. But as a work of art, it therefore does not compromise itself.
Excellent.",1434931200,4,502,5.0602409638554215
7020813,3,B00TRAO6IG,"I loved Costa-Gavras's ""Z"" and ""Missing"", but the current film is not in the same league. The cinematography is good, but the story is weak. Sure, it shows how the Communist dictatorships worked in Eastern Europe. The film is mostly about a prison and it does not have any of the suspense of the other films. Costa-Gavras has mostly made films about right-wing dictators and for a long time the left-wing intelligentsia suppressed the film, because it was attacking the left-wing's ugly mother, i.e. communism. Still I cannot give the film more than three stars.

However, Criterion's extras are great. The 30 min ""making of"" documentary is hard hitting. The lead actor Yves Montand talks about the film and how his own mother worshiped Stalin several years after his death. The documentary from 1970 shows how some asses try to defend communism/socialism. The Finnish guy interviewing Costa-Garvas is full of penetrating questions, no bulls*** at all. Very interesting if you are into history. Five stars for the extras.",1434931200,7,1021,5.0773809523809526
7020814,4,B00TRAO6IG,"I first saw this movie when it came out in 1970, and I was stunned, utterly gobsmacked.  THIS was the movie that explained totalitarianism to me, for it alone showed that even a true believer could continue to believe, even as his belief was being viciously betrayed by his superiors in the party.  I was also pretty sure that this movie, though directed at Czech communism, surely applied to fascism as well.  I looked for this movie for ages on VHS, no luck, nor on DVD, until recently.  I watched it again, for the first time in 44 years, with great anticipation.  Alas, the movie hasn't changed, nor perhaps even its lesson, but--again, alas--I have changed.  I've seen too many betrayals from too many quite disparate political sources, to be stunned, nor even surprised by treachery or naivete, not anymore.  Maybe only young people should watch this nonetheless quite excellent movie.  The final moments of the film, showing the youth of Prague facing the Soviet tanks invading their country--today's youth ought to see themselves in these decades-old Czech faces . . . but I fear they won't.  It's so easy to be smug when you're young.",1419552000,18,1143,4.790816326530612

7020816,4,B00TRAO6IG,"Costa Gavras"" ""The Confession"" is a mesmerizing account of an elaborate show trial of more than a dozen Czech communists by their Soviet masters in the early 1950s. Although the use of both flashbacks and flash forwards can be confusing at times, it doesn't diminish the power of the story and the efforts of a powerful cast lead by Yves Montand and Simone Signoret",1358640000,12,365,4.71875

8702922,5,B00TRAO6IG,"Confess? Confess to what?

That is the question asked by Yves Montand as Artur London at a point fairly early in Costa-Gavras' The Confession. Released in 1970 hot on the heels of Z, The Confession also tells a true story though this one is set behind the Iron Curtain and explores the Stalinist era show trials. How it does so is through the journey of one man into an increasingly bewildering situation that feels straight out of Kafka's The Trial. Except, as the film reminds us, this actually happened.

Though the times and places are different, it's hard not to find the film a spiritual successor to Z. Both films deal ultimately with the same theme: the misuse of government power and the subversion of justice. In the case of this film, it's not an assassination but a 1952 Czech show trial. Yet the film, through Jorge Semprn's script and Costa-Gavras direction, play the film not as a thriller but as a very different kind of journey into a world just as corrupt but perhaps even more horrifying.

The journey that The Confession takes us on is a fairly simple one. One may find themselves asking how, in cases around the world, why someone would confess to something they didn't do. Understanding just how and why a person would that can often be difficult to understand. Watching this film removes the doubt of that by often putting the viewer into the position of an accused man and his family going through just such as experience. Across two hours or so, we're shown how it can happen through a combination of torture, misplaced faith in the system, and appealing to that most basic of instincts: survival. We see how innocent events can be turned into damning statements, how promises are made but quickly forgotten, how the threat of a terrible fate can lead a man on a path from which there seems no escape. Watching the film, I often found myself thinking back to Kafka's The Trial as the accused tries to make sense of the events around him and how ultimately the only choice might be to accept his fate. It's a journey that the viewer isn't likely to forget soon after watching it.

Part of that is down to the cast and the leading man in particular. Yves Montand made a huge impression as the charismatic assassinated politician in Z and the role he plays here couldn't be further removed from that role. Here Montand plays an unassuming government official whose only crimes seem to be having been in the wrong place at the wrong time and thus spends years of his life imprisoned and tortured. Montand's performance, most emotionally and physically is something to behold, as we see an intelligent man reduced to a shell of his former self and is ultimately made a victim of the very system he has been spent his life working to defend and support. That Montand manages to go from dignified man to complacent victim and back again is a testament to his skill as an actor in bringing the script to life.

The supporting cast is solid. Simone Signoret as Montand's wife gives an intriguing and truthful performance as she too goes on a journey just as bewildering, trying to make sense of the chaos around her. Gabriele Ferzetti also gives a standout performance as one of the many interrogators as what seems a reasonable man with the best intentions of everyone at heart though (as his final scene suggests), his motives are never quite clear. The film overall is well cast and no one would seem to have been miscast in any part which itself is a testament to just how well cast it is.

What really separates this film from Z (and perhaps the other films of Costa-Gavras) is its atmosphere. The score is sparse and lacks the upbeat quality found in both Z and State Of Siege, going instead for an underplayed feel that also gives the film a strong sense of reality through its lack of presence. There is a stark, gray feel to the film across many of its scenes with the exception of scenes set at a later date from the rest of the main narrative. The pace is also much different, with less energy going into the narrative drive which is something that helps to give the sense of time passing slowly for both accused and viewer alike. It's an interesting feeling and one that contrasts to great effect.

Yet there's more to it than that as the film puts the viewer a little too close for comfort into the situation. Costa-Gavras makes some interesting use of cinematography and sound at times during sequences with Montand is blindfolded, playing those scenes in either close-ups or extreme close-ups with an exaggerated sound level to help the viewer understand what must be going on behind the blindfold by barely giving them anymore knowledge that the character has. That sense also extends to some hallucinatory atmosphere in some of the interrogation scenes where exhaustion catch up with the lead and cause the lines between reality and nightmare, past and present, to blur to the point of confusion. Rarely has a film captured the experiences of both imprisonment and the horrors of sleep deprivation as well as this film does.

The Confession then, in the final analysis, is a film of many things. It's a Kafka-esque journey into a dark chapter of 20th century history, one that lets the viewer understand why imprisonment is like in a dystopian state. Yet it is the combination of filmmakers, actors, and script that convey the ultimate horror of the film: that real life can be even more terrible than anything a fiction writer can come up with. Though set in Easter Europe of the early 1950s, this tale of justice and political faith betrayed is a lesson that is timeless and in need of being remembered.",1474156800,,5638,4.65929648241206
