It was so inexpensive it wasn't worth returning, and the error was mine anyway.  That being said, I have always had good luck with products stamped with the Good Housekeeping seal of approval.",1398384000,,330,4.466666666666667

The pace is great with the directions being very simple.  The ladies in the video look just like  everyday people so that you don't feel overwhelmed.  I combine this program with walking for 30 min  every other day and am able to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week on this.",1012521600,,319,4.096774193548387
