Supernatural tease is between something very odd going on in a traditional supernatural way, and maybe some sort of ""synchronicity.""[...]

I think the film is good watching but is not as deep as pretends to be. There are some beautiful actresses. There are some good thoughtful lines. The lovers do come together in the end and much of the film is about how bottled up they are and what a big deal it is for them to break through. I don't think this was overplayed. Some might think it was overly drawn out. I can see that, but it is a matter of taste. I was in a mood for a somewhat moody film. Anyway, for me that held the film together more than the ""mystery"" which clearly was not heading towards a clear explanation of causation, though I was interested in how it would play out in more events.",1310428800,,1041,4.561497326203209
8029185,4,B0002M80M6,"As someone who enjoys films that turn our ordinary perceptions of the world inside out, I was pleasantly surprised to find such a gem almost at my back door. The film takes place in Baie Comeau, a small Quebec town a day's drive from Montreal or Quebec City. The beauty of this area was well captured in the film - the town is actually more gritty and industrial than ever showed up in the film, but the spot is gorgeous in a kind of backcountry way. The film takes us through a series of events that are increasingly fantastic, from the fact that the tide appears to have stopped following a local tragedy, to a climax which combines the arrival of the water with a kind of emotional resolution of the tension between the characters. In some ways, the film made me think of Margaret Atwood's novel ""Surfacing"", another story that takes place in Quebec backcountry, with a similar melding of fantastical and real events, but the two stories are really quite different.

The only scene that is slightly out of synch with the rest is the unrealistic use of satellite imagery to locate a downed plane. The film also includes a small but effective role by Genevive Bujold, a Quebec actress we see all too rarely.

I recommend the film for those that like a story that is somewhat offbeat, and also for its depiction of this particular part of Quebec, a part one rarely sees on film.",1105315200,3,1378,4.530120481927711
