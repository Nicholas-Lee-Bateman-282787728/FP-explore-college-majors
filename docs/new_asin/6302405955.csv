After babies and ""middle age spread"" I gained around 70 lbs. that I was able to loose again with diet and this routine, I also added weights after I got fitter. I am now a 62 yo grandmother that is a size 8, great abs, butt and legs and can STILL wear a bikini and turn heads.",1445904000,2,456,4.021978021978022
7825213,5,6302405955,"I found this VHS tape in a thrift store and decided to try it.  This workout is dated, of course, but so much fun and effective.  It will bring you back to the days of spandex workout clothes and 80's upbeat music. Kathy Smith is a very good instructor and her exercise routine is not harmful to the joints with the exception of a couple of stretches where she says to bounce, but we know better now.  It is hard to find all in one aerobic/exercise workouts that are effective and easy to follow.
  She starts with a warm up then moves right into arm exercises.  It is good to use light wrist weights as they are wearing, hold light free weights--2lbs/4lbs, or no weights.  Do not use heavy weights since the moves are done with quick reps.  My arms are burning after this part!  Next she moves right into the aerobics which are easy, fun dance moves with 2 brief heart rate checks.  The aerobics are effective and got my heart rate up to at least 188 per minute towards the end.  I just follow the direction of the group on the TV and ignore left or right directions.  It is easier that way.  This is simple, high reps, 80's aerobics, but it is not high impact.  Next she moves right into abdominal exercises which are very effective and  I feel the burn.  Next she moves into leg exercise which, because of the reps, are very challenging and my hips are really burning after those!  Next she moves into glutes which are are also lots of reps and make my glutes burn with the effort.  Last is a cool down where she leads a stretch.  The stretches are effective, but could be held a little longer.
  Really, they don't make them like this anymore!  If you are an 80's girl like me and were there the first time around for the aerobics craze, you may enjoy this fun workout to do when you are feeling like a retro workout.",1299888000,5,1821,4.294117647058823
7825214,5,6302405955,"One of my FAVORITES by Kathy Smith. I know this video is pretty old, but it is fantastic! I always really enjoy most of all Kathy Smith's videos. This video is great if you want to get a good, healthy (but light) workout. She keeps everything fun (as always).
Great for someone who is looking for a fun little workout that doesn't over do it.",1288742400,,342,4.276923076923077
7825215,5,6302405955,"I happened upon this tape about 15 years ago in some bargain bin.  I have purchased a number of videos since then and I keep coming back to this one.  Nothing fancy or gimmicky but if you have 60 minutes to spare it covers: warm up, arms, aerobic, stomach, legs, butt and cooldown.  If you only have 20 minutes the warmup and arms is a great morning stretch.  I am so psyched because my video is worn down and about to break and just found out they rereleased this on dvd!",1247097600,3,472,4.153846153846154
7825216,4,6302405955,"This is my old time favorite Kathy workout. The aerobics will get too easy for you after a couple of weeks but the lower body part is awesome and will keep you going with it for a long time. I had to take away one star because on the leg part, Kathy does the reps unequally to the other leg and that shouldn't be. Other than that, awesome workout.",1231804800,2,347,4.043478260869565
