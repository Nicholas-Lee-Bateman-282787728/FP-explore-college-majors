8644210,5,B00IOR2XE2,"This is a simple video.  It is hard at times, but I never feel like it is overly strenuous.  In fact, I did this work out throughout my pregnancy.  It is effective though.  By eating properly, doing this video four or five times per week, and jogging a mile occasionally, I lost 20 lbs in 2 months (size 6 to size 2).",1502755200,,317,4.064516129032258

8644216,4,B00IOR2XE2,"Great workout!  My daughter lost 50 lbs. using these videos, so I decided to try to drop the 30 I've picked up over the last 10 years.  It's very challenging, but Debbie gives simple, easy to understand instruction and always gives alternative moves for those who can't manage high intensity exercise.  My energy level and strength have increased, and I feel much better.  Best of all I'm losing weight and toning up my muscles.",1410912000,4,428,4.743243243243243
