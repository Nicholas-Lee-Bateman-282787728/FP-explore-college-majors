8612530,4,B00F5ZPTA6,"I love Gilad's workouts on TV and these are the same quick, total body exercises that he does on the show. The only thing that I wasn't expecting is that the show still pauses for commercials but then comes right back. I would like it better if it was consistent without pausing. Other than that I like this workout DVD.",1394928000,3,320,4.35
