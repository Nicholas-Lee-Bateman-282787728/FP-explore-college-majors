8433027,2,B004KKYA66,"Good 3D but content was rather boring.  27 minutes of scene repeats of the tail of a whale followed by over an hour of fireworks.  Mostly repeated video clips.

Wish Amazon would do more 3D in side by side.  Plenty of titles of really great movies.  Lots of 3D viewers, so where's the Amazon 3D content?",1407283200,,303,4.339285714285714
8433028,1,B004KKYA66,Looks like a homemade movie. Don't waste your money. Amazon should take this off their list. The title Is totally deceiving. It makes you think of a documentary film But it's not.,1376611200,,179,4.625
8433029,1,B004KKYA66,"Love the title ""perfect sky"". There was absolutely nothing perfect about this, there was NO 3D!!!! I feel I was cheated!!!
The rating should be NO STAR at all, but impossible to accomplish!",1371168000,,189,4.757575757575758
8433030,3,B004KKYA66,The first part of the film shows whales and the ocean.  I saw little 3d effects in this section.  The fireworks display later in the film as impressive.  The 3d effects were obvious and impressive.  The film rental price is appropriate.,1366848000,,236,4.682926829268292
8433031,2,B004KKYA66,"Seemed like the same footage repeated over and over.  Same whale, same tail.  Couldn't watch in its entirety.  Maybe it's just me....",1353974400,,133,4.954545454545454
8433032,1,B004KKYA66,This video consists entirely of Looped footage of just two sceens. It's poorly processed so the 3D imaging will probably give you a headache as it did for me.,1340755200,,158,4.482758620689655
8433033,1,B004KKYA66,"There are no out of screen effects. The in-screen 3D is consistently underwhelming. The content is also bad.

This is a side-by-side DVD, playable on the new 3D TVs.

To sum up the content; this is a scene of a whale in forward...in reverse...in forward...in reverse...in forward...in reverse. Here is the next scene, in forward...in reverse...in forward...in reverse...in forward...in reverse. The next scene, in forward...in reverse.....You get the idea.

In the fireworks portion, each explosion on the screen is doubled, tripled or quadrupled at varying sizes and locations. At the same time some are shown in reverse. What you see is a headache inducing big mess on the screen. This title doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating.

***  Keep Clear Of This One  ***

MY 3D RATING = POOR  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)
