He wakes up in San Francisco and does his morning routine: splashes his face with water, 2 sit-ups, 7 push-ups, 2 oz of green tea on the rocks. He gets his orders from a manila envelope in a church while he narrates, ""some people just deserve killing"" cue the picture of Jesus. He gets cash in various currency and a Russian passport so he can travel to London.

After a brief encounter with Mickey Rourke, he does some free lance work and goes vigilante over some Russian mafia types running prostitutes. Woman (Dominique Swain) with a terrible accent needs sister saved form bad guys. Bradley works for Eric Roberts by no surprise. He is up against bad guys Michael Madsen and Darryl Hannah who looks like a Botox vampire, a long fall from the spanking material she used to portray.

The fighting was fairly bad as there an almost void of the exaggerated hit noises that goes into action films. Instead it sounded like soft blows on leather jackets, mostly because they were wearing leather jackets and barely touching each other.
The dialogue was bad, at times so bad as to be entertaining.
