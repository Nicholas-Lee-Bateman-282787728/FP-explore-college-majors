This is certainly a must buy as this continues the ever exciting journey of One Piece. For those of you who are new to the One Piece series and are looking to get into it, i recommend (as with all good stories) starting at the beginning. This series (as well as the contents of this DVD) is an epic adventure with many fantasy elements added into the mix. I let the readers know that this is one story you do not want to miss out on.

Warning below will contain spoilers about this specific DVD. If you wish to keep the contents of this DVDs adventure a secret then do not read below. If you do not care then have at it.

In this DVD One Piece: Season 4, Voyage 5 CP9 is about to make it's move. What are they after, and can Luffy find Robin? This DVD will also reveal the past of Iceberg and Franky. For you One Piece fans, watch and enjoy.",1368921600,,971,4.0

5510327,4,B00AUJH3B0,"The Straw Hats continue their ""adventure"" in Water Seven in episodes 242-252...

With two crew members down, the Straw Hats open this batch of episodes by fighting the shipwrights and confronting Robin and the mysterious CP9, which involves hack-and-slashing their way through generic crowds rather than any elaborated or two-sided fights. The meat of disc one is essentially the explanation of who CP9 are and what exactly they're doing, so the first half of these episodes is less action-packed and more talky and exposition-based. That's not a criticism by any any means, as this set-up provides vital backstory and motivation for the rest of the CP9 story arc, but if you're expecting an epic fight scene to erupt then you'll have to be a little more patient (don't worry, it'll be worth the wait!). Also, the first few episodes do pull off a plot twist that legitimately didn't expect when a first watched the episodes, so it's a same that FUNi spoils this revilation on the trailer! If you haven't seen FUNi's trailer for this set, don't! (thankfully the box art itself doesn't spoil anything).
Disc two opens with a three-part side-story flashbacking to Franky's backstory and the history of the sea train, which makes a nice change from watching the Straw Hats lose friends and get pummeled! Mind you, this is a One Piece backstory so don't expect it to have a particularly uplifting ending. As well as being a welcome change of pace, this also marks Franky's gradual change into becoming a less villainous character and after these episode you actually feel a lot more empathetic towards Franky. The final two episodes of this Voyage do resolve some of the Water Seven sub-plots as well as setting up the action for Voyage Five, so this voyage does offer some closure to elements of the Water Seven arc as the main ongoing story progresses.

The video and audio quality remain identical to the last three Voyages: 16:9 progressive video and either 5.1 English or 2.0 Japanese with English subtitles. None of these episodes were plagued by off-model moments but there were a few experimental camera angles and effects; some of them are interesting and some... are just a bit odd. Still, kudos to the anime team for being creative.
As for extras we get the usual: Marathon Play for One Piece binging, a chatty US cast commentary on episodes 244 (ADR Director Mike McFarland, Patrick Seitz - Franky , Brina Palencia - Chopper) and 245 (Mike McFarland, David Wald - Paulie, Luci Christian - Nami), and the textless opening and closing animations.
Plus 'One The Boat: Behind The Scenes Of One Piece' interviews with Brina Palencia [12:45] and Eric Vale (Sanji) [16:09], hosted by Mike McFarland. Perhaps this was to make up for only having an 11-episode Voyage? The interviews are similar to the commentaries and the two talk generally about their opinion of their characters and how they perform them. I'd love to see more of these, and maybe even some footage of scenes being dubbed, on future DVDs.

Voyage Four keeps building more and more conflict to the epic CP9 story arc while making sure that the tone of the series doesn't stray too far. More revelations, conflict and exposition are added to the story, but these episodes also expand on Franky's characterization and give the viewer just a tiny bit of closure to some of the sub-plots introduced in the previous Voyage. And the DVD extras have even begun to expand!",1364688000,,3430,4.859829059829059
5510328,5,B00AUJH3B0,"If your an Anime fan, this long going series gets better and better. Wait till you make it to episodes over 500, it gets really intense!",1363824000,,136,4.269230769230769
5510329,5,B00AUJH3B0,"people stop posting spoiler alerts on reviews please it takes the fun out of watching one piece as me i just read the spoiler title and think what the why are you doing this for people like me that hasn't watched it i am watching only English not jap dub so please try to not put spoiler's into the comments or something please and thank you.

P.S. this is the only voyage without Luffy on the Front cover",1357689600,25,405,4.1923076923076925
5510330,4,B00AUJH3B0,"Yes, the Spoiler King is back but I promise to do a little less spoiling here.  This set begins with four of the Straw Hat Pirates (Luffy, Zoro, Nami, and Chopper)investigating a renewed raid by CP9 (the World Government's elite ""secret agent"" organization)on Iceberg's house.  Iceberg's workers are standing guard also but the CP9 operatives get past them easily.  We finally find out who the CP9 operatives are and what they want but even I don't have the gall to tell you who they are.  All I can tell you is they are familiar faces and that they prove to be way too tough for the Straw Hats to stop just then.  And what CP9 wants is basically the same thing that an earlier enemy of the Straw Hats wanted.
Meanwhile, Sanji has not given up on Robin and continues to track her as best as he can.  Usopp continues to guard his beloved ship (the Going Merry) until Franky comes along to recapture him and the ship in the hopes of still getting the rest of the Straw Hats' money as ransom.  However, Franky and Usopp (sharing a common passion for ships and gadgetry) eventually become friends.  Unfortunately, the CP9 operatives, having failed to get what they wanted from Iceberg, track down Franky at his hideout, capture him and Usopp, and let the Going Merry drift out to sea.
But before Franky is taken away, we finally get his backstory where he and Iceberg were apprentice shipbuilders under the legendary shipwright, Tom.  Tom is notable for being the first good Fishman character to appear on One Piece.  He is also notable for creating the Sea Train and Gol D. Roger's pirate ship.  It is this latter creation that prompts Spandam (the current boss of CP9) to arrest Tom and take him into custody.  Franky tries but fails to rescue Tom.  I'll say this for Spandam; he is a rare mixture of just about every bad quality you can think of (ugly, greedy, devious, sadistic, cowardly, vain, AND stupid).
This set ends with the Straw Hats pulling themselves up from the beating CP9 gave them and getting set to pursue the Sea Train which has Robin, Franky, and Usopp as prisoners on board, just as the deadly Aqua Laguna storm begins to rage.

Next:  The great chase to the judiciary island, Enies Lobby, and the coming of the legendary Sniper King!",1357689600,5,2252,4.581047381546135
