7983739,2,B00008G97J,"The DVD box tells of one story and you get another. All this really started when a gold digger gripes to Smoke that Rob is the one with the power and Smokes takes it to heart and kills Rob. Smoke pins the crime on J-Boogie and gets Rob's brother to kill him. J-Boogie's Uncle find out and you pretty much figure out the story. There are other movies that do this same story, only better.",1065312000,,387,4.173333333333333
