7366055,3,B013JA9QDO,"Don't let the goofy title or the generic poster fool you. This is actually a pretty effective horror thriller with Cage bringing his A game. He's done a lot of bad movies over the past few years but this one goes into a category that is much more watchable than some of those other titles. Its a very low budget and you can see the lack of money with some of the effects, though there aren't that many of them so it isn't too big of a deal.

Nic Cage is a college professor whose son goes missing while he buys him an ice cream cone at a Halloween carnival. After the police investigation goes nowhere, he begins his own investigation into his son's disappearance which leads him into realizing that it wasn't a human who took his boy but something very old otherworldly that has been at this for a long time.

There are some jump scares but the movie does a good job of building up the tension throughout the movie. Like I already said, Cage does a great job as the lead but the story doesn't do much for the other main characters. Sarah Wayne Callies from The Walking Dead plays the wife of Cage's character and she is completely wasted her. Lyriq Bent, Rigg from the Saw films, plays the cop investigating the disappearance of Cage's son. He gets a few really good scenes in the movie and then abruptly disappears before the third act. Honestly both characters could have been cut from the movie and it wouldn't have made a huge difference.

The plot is similar to Insidious but its not a complaint. Watch it.",1442880000,12,1512,4.392857142857143
7366056,1,B013JA9QDO,"You should PAY NOTHING for this movie. It deals with ghost and children. However, there have been so many movies like this that they all become predictable, repetitive and boring.

About 15 minutes into the film, something happens to the child. Its a puzzling scene. Theres nothing scary about it. Approximately fifty minutes after that, theres a scene that startles me for 20 second. Twenty minutes later, before the ending, there is a scene supposing to be scary but the special effect looks so fake and cheap that it becomes a bad joke.

Nicholas Cages acting is okay but he cant save this picture.",1442880000,,601,4.769230769230769
7366057,2,B013JA9QDO,"This was corny. Extra star for scary special effects and some adorable kids. Halloween tale that didn't need Nicolas Cage's over-acting to bring the hokey factor way up, Sarah Wayne Callies seemed to follow along in that department. I just kept rolling my eyes, I don't normally do that during a whole movie.",1442793600,,308,4.830188679245283
7366058,3,B013JA9QDO,"A newly tenured professor named Mike Lawford (Nicolas Cage, reasonably engaged) takes his son to a Halloween carnival.  While buying ice cream, the boy turns to his father and asks ""Can we pay the ghost?"" and when the professor looks down his son is gone.  A year later Mike is a wreck--barely functioning as a teacher in a nearly empty classroom, separated from his wife who blames him for not protecting their son, spending most of his time futilely stapling missing-child fliers all over New York when he starts to hear his boy's voice and see fleeting visions of him asking for help.

Pay the Ghost is filled with stuff you've seen before but it's done with enough conviction that the movie mostly works, although children who haven't already seen hundreds of horror films will probably find this creepier than their parents--and this is definitely a family friendly horror film.  There's not a whole lot of tension and suspense but Pay the Ghost is engaging enough to sit through without getting bored and Nicolas Cage is good enough to sell his character's anguish, even if no one is likely to mistake this for one of his more serious recent performances like those in Joe or Dying of the Light or The Runner.  This is Nicolas Cage squarely in B-movie mode, but he's a really big fish in a small talent pond when he makes stuff like this and it's unlikely the filmmakers could have found anyone better to anchor their movie.

For most people looking to fill their horror movie fix Pay the Ghost will be little more than a highly watchable time-waster, but it's a good training wheels horror film if you want something a little bit scary to watch with your kids.",1442620800,7,1667,4.653061224489796
7366059,4,B013JA9QDO,"The film opens with an incident in 1679 New York and jumps to the present. Mike Lawford (Nicolas Cage) is a professor of horror literature in NYC. While celebrating Halloween with his son Charlie (Jack Fulton) he suddenly goes missing with his last words being ""pay the ghost."" Mike is not convinced his son is dead, and goes on a search. The film plays out like a modified POLTERGEIST, which I thought was a better movie.

This would make a decent Halloween film for the kids complete with turkey vultures and a creepy blind man. Could give them nightmares with the shadow images.  For seasoned horror film watchers, this is just one of a pack of ghost films, done well, but not over powering. 3 1/2 stars.

Guide: No sex or nudity. Don't recall any swearing.",1442620800,15,760,4.573529411764706
7366060,3,B013JA9QDO,"Based on the short story by Tim Lebbon, the film stars workaholic/crazy man Nic Cage as a professor named Mike that loses his son in a crowd one Halloween night and spends the following year passionately searching for him. Despite no leads from the police and everyone else attempting to move on, Mike never gives up hope. As the anniversary of the boy's disappearance comes closer, the visions of his son become more frequent, as if trying to relay a message from beyond the grave. Accompanied by his now ex-wife, the two follow clues in an attempt to find out what really happened to their boy and where he may be.

There's really not a whole lot that can be said about Pay the Ghost--it's a movie that starts off interesting enough story-wise, even offering a couple somewhat creepy scenes and ghostly jump scares, but it's all pretty familiar territory for the avid genre fan, especially towards the end. In fact, there's nothing new here at all and that's the movie's biggest fault. It's lack of creativity is unfortunate because it actually has an interesting story buried within all the clichs and monotony--a story that details forms of witchcraft and revenge every Halloween night.

As far as acting goes Nic Cage tries his hardest to not seem crazy, while Sarah Wayne Callies plays the standard concerned mother (though we know how careless you really are Lori Grimes!). The production values are decent, despite it's clearly low budget and the directing is fairly competent, but that's about it. The film seemingly had some potential to be an above average effort early on, but fell into all the standard tropes, even to the point of regurgitating the same old climax that we've seen many times in recent years, just done better (Insidious).

Overall, Pay the Ghost offered an interesting story and couple decent scares early on before delivering all the inevitable tropes horror fans have come to expect. It's unoriginality is the film's biggest flaw, ultimately leading it to be nothing more than your typical ghostly tale. It may be worth a look on a boring night, but don't expect anything new.",1441843200,38,2109,4.852777777777778

The actors did fine and the dialogue rang true, but the other-world parts seemed artificially veneering a missing-child case.  Watched to the end mostly because I'm a Cage fan.

Nicolas Cage is always good, and illustrates the suffering well.  And that's the rub - this movie plays the ""man's fault"" card, and I almost turned it off completely when that became obvious.  It portrays men in a bad light, and I think that's a misconception that has completely run its course in Hollywood.

7366093,2,B013JA9QDO,"I love Nicolas Cage.
I am giving this movie two stars just because he was in it, and because the movie entertained me, even though I wouldn't recommend it.

This movie was original, different, interesting.... but it didn't make sense, and the story was not detailed enough, and it was full of holes.

I didn't care about the characters.

I felt Nicolas's pain, but not his wife's - - only her anger.

Nicholas bought an ice cream cone, and in a moment, Charlie was gone - - it was not Nicolas's fault and there was nothing that he could have done - - if the ghost was going to take Charlie, then the ghost would have taken Charlie no matter where he was or who was with him.  It was wrong for the wife to blame Nicholas.

I didn't care if Charlie was found.

There was a happy ending, but I didn't feel it, there wasn't enough emotion.

There is a ghost from the 1600s who steals children every Halloween.... so, then, there should have been more children.
Exactly how did the ghost grab the children, what did the birds have to do with it, how did the blind guy know everything (and why would a blind guy carry a flashlight)?  Who was writing graffiti on the walls, and couldn't the graffiti have given some hints, instead of the same sentence everywhere?

There was a scene where they bring in a psychic.  This was a good opportunity for the movie to tell a lot of backstory, for the psychic to tell a lot about the ghost, about what happened in the 1600s, to give hints about where Charlie is - - the psychic could have told a lot of interesting things here, but the movie did not use that scene at all.

Nicolas Cage rescues his son and two other children and leaves all of the others there....but, really, the Irish schoolteacher said that only the last three children could be saved.  What did Charlie and Mia and Pablo do for a year, wearing the same clothes, just standing around frozen in a group of dead children?  How did Charlie keep appearing all year, such as on the bus and moving the scooter across the room, and couldn't Charlie have given a hint of where he was?

Nicolas brings his son home, and the police don't question what happened?

The other two children who were rescued, Mia and Pablo - - they are not shown being brought home - - did Nicolas bring them home before he brought his son home - - and didn't those parents or the police question Nicolas?

So, the three children remember nothing, go home in the same clothes from a year ago, never so much as took a shower or had anything to eat or aged in a year?  And everyone is just so happy that the children are home that they just don't ask.

No one really cared that the psychic and the lady professor and the cab driver died for no reason.",1469318400,,2721,4.3

7366106,5,B013JA9QDO,"I rented this ghostly fare late one night on DISH on Demand.  I went through about 40 titles checking with Amazon's ratings before ordering.  Why?  In this genre there are way too many people making terrible horror flicks.  There must be big money in it but we're getting some awful B movies that are so amateurish I'm becoming much more careful before renting one.  People like me who like a GOOD spooky movie need to warn each other.
But this one is good.  It's professionally done like a movie should be done.  And it's a good scary story.  Perfect for Halloween!  As a matter of fact the story centers around Halloween where a litle boy suddenly vanishes while his dad is HOLDING HIS HAND at a Halloween event outdoors.  Then the parents start trying to find the boy and stumble across a story of intrigue involving an original settlement in New Youk state around the year 1769 where a tragedy occured that led to an occult pledge that will make every Halloween a memorable event.  Ooooh!  Aaaaah!  I won't tell you more!
Just that this is a REAL movie and a good ghost story.  Worth poping some popcorn and grabing a ginger ale and turning the lights out!  But don't just sit there . . . PAY THE GHOST!",1462060800,,1207,4.447488584474886

7366150,4,B013JA9QDO,"On the anniversary of his son's disappearance at a Halloween carnival, a father believes he sees and hears his child. That begins a search revealing of all the children disappearing in New York City, most of those taken on Halloween are never recovered.

This is a good, scary film, but it moves a little too quickly so the expected tension doesn't built. There are too many coincidences placed in the searching father's path, leading him in the right direction, such as his discovering the spot in New York where Irish descendant conveniently hold a Samhain celebration every year and someone there hold all the answers he seeks. To my way of thinking, the separate incidents moving him toward his goal should've been developed a bit more. It was as though once started, there was a reminder of the film's budget so each scene were trimmed down so much they all seem anti-climactic.

Or perhaps it's merely the absence of violence and gore that's a let-down.

 It's a good film and enjoyable but it leaves one with the feeling it should've been more.  Also...what's with that final scene and did no one think it odd there were buzzards flying around NYC, or are carrion scavengers a normal sight in the Big City?

7366168,4,B013JA9QDO,"This movie honestly surprised me. I went in with 0 expectations & was very pleasantly surprised. Nicholas Cage does a pretty good job here, I cant remember the last time I enjoyed one of his recent movies. Basic story is on Halloween some kids go missing every year, including Cage's son, and he's on a mission to try & find out why & if there's anything he can do to get his kid back after having what seems to be hallucinations about him. There are some very eerie moments & even a haunting song. The atmosphere in certain scenes here is great & a few are very creepy. This has to be one of the best supernatural thrillers ive seen recently. One downside is there are no special features but don't that stop you from picking this up, its really good & well worth a watch at least but for me its worth having in my collection. If you are in the mood for a creppy ghost tale, give this filma chance. It may surprise you as much as it did me.",1451779200,,941,4.175824175824176
7366169,4,B013JA9QDO,"This film serves some decent scares.  Granted, it probably won't be upheld much in our collective memory, but 2015 was subpar as far as horror film offerings, with the exception of It Follows.  This movie smacks of Cage's turn in the remake of The Wicker Man, but it is a much better executed film.  Here Cage loses his son during a Halloween celebration and is tasked to contend with the supernatural forces responsible for the missing child.  The effects are pulled off nicely without seeming like rushed CGI jobs.  It steals some of its plot from Insidious, but the fun cast, including popular Walking Dead actress Sarah Wayne Callies, makes for a nice atmospheric Halloween film.",1451692800,,683,4.853448275862069

7366255,2,B013JA9QDO,"I didn't know what to expect when I went into Pay the Ghost. But when I came out of it, I was rather disappointed.

First I'll go into what I liked about the film. The plot was fairly original. We get into some old Irish traditions of paying the ghost, due to a past wrong committed towards a family. The film succeeds at creating suspense. I might have jumped a couple of times. The story starts off pretty good and the special effects were decent.

But. I don't think horror is Nicolas Cage's strong suit. I remember when he tried to do another thriller called The Wicker Man a few years ago. And to be honest with you, I felt like he fit into that film better than this one. And that film is not considered to be one of his better projects. On top of that, the film tries a little too hard to be scary. It gets to the point, where it uses some off the wall jump scares, that don't really seem to fit. Vultures flying around, images of Cage's missing son, reminiscent of all the earlier ghost stories that had little boys in the plot. The medium who comes to their house and is totally bushwhacked by the ghost, just to create more devastation. The mysterious blind guy who supposedly knows everything about the dilemma and how to help Cage. Then there was the fact that Cage basically becomes the number one suspect to the police, yet when the film ends, he could still be seen as the number one suspect. Particularly when it comes to why the children were missing.

What it boils down to is, the story creates some holes that never get filled. It uses some jump scares, just to rattle the audience, but they aren't played out very well, nor do they ever get an explanation. They're just there.

I don't know. It just felt like the film kept throwing down plot elements that were pieced together by borrowing from other horror films. I saw signs of Poltergeist, the Omen, every movie that ever had a woman burned at the stake, and possibly Insidious. It felt hodge-podge to me. That's the best way to describe it. And it hurt the overall viewing experience.

Anyway It may be worth a rental if you like ghost stories that involve a mystery. But don't expect to be blown out of the water by it or anything. I'm giving it two stars mainly because I like ghost stories, but I felt like this one was lacking.",1448150400,2,2307,4.355813953488372

7366299,4,B013JA9QDO,"I rented this from the Box  to save money and as a protest to some of the movie pricing going on here. I was surprised that I actually liked the movie (Cage movies are getting to be more misses than hits) and the tone it set fairly early on. I may be somewhat biased with this review for two reasons. 1) I like Cage and 2) I've seen so many bad Horror movies lately that when decent acting and productions values are combined into one movie Im pretty happy.
The story is about a family of three Mike (Nicolas Cage), Kristen (Sarah Wayne Callies) and Charle (Jack Fulton) living in the ""Big Apple"" Charle starts to see someone (thing) outside his bedroom window as well as seeing vultures and hearing voices.
 Mike just got tenure as a professor at a local university and hasn't had much time for his family. When Mike breaks a promise he had with Charle he tries to make up for it, he talks Kristen into letting him take Charle out to the Halloween carnival on a school night. Mike stops at a snack wagon to get he and Charle ice cream cones when Charle vanishes. Kristen blames Mike for losing her son and the couple separate. Mike never gives up looking for Charle and he is constantly irritating detective Jordan (yriq Bent) with possible sexual predators and other ideas. During this time he thinks he sees Charle and or hears him calling out to him. Mike finally gets Kristen to talk to him as he tells her what he has been seeing and hearing. She too, is having the same interactions with Charle. Mike and Kristen compare notes and Mike takes the lead to try and find Charle. This is after they have a psychic visit their home. They find with the help of Hannah (Veronica Ferres) an associate of Mikes that there is a Celtic legend revolving around a 16th century wrongful death of a mother and her children in New York on Halloween.
The characters could have been better developed as well as the storyline, but the good acting and mystery kept my interest as I waited for the mystery to unfold.
There is very little cursing and no nudity in this story and would be ok for young teens to watch with their family.",1447200000,,2118,4.400510204081633

An exciting, touching story, creepy sets, some history / legends, good actors, even some good poetry - who thought the classic horror stories were exploited should definitely give this film a chance - really great combination of old concepts (ghost stories) with fresh ideas. It shows one more time that the genre does not have to wander off into the far-off field of torture porn like Saw, Hostel or Silence of the Lambs which are not even real, original horror in the sense of mystery and the supernatural.

7366337,3,B013JA9QDO,"'Mike' (Nicolas Cage) takes his son 'Charlie' (Jack Fulton) on a tour of the 'Halloween' celebrations on the streets of
'New York'........whist taking time out to buy an ice-cream for his son, 'Charlie' is heard to ask ''Can we pay the Ghost ?
ice-cream in hand 'Mike' looks down....'Charlie' has disappeared.
A desperate search with police involvement follows, no clues, no signs, no trace....'Mike's wife 'Kristen' (Sarah Wayne
Callies) holds her husband responsible for what had happened, the couple split.
Almost a year has now past, 'Mike' is frequently haunted by images of his son......during yet another search he happens
upon an old and derelict Church with graffiti written on it's frontage.....'pay-the-Ghost'.........inside he finds a small group
of vagrants sheltering the rooms below street-level, there, if but briefly he learns of Spirit that returns every year at this
time.
With the help of his estranged wife and a colleague from the college he lectures at they research similar disappearances
that occur on 'Halloween' down the years........a pattern emerges.
Is there really a way to get 'Charlie' back......do they really have to pay-the-Ghost ?........after midnight on Halloween' the
one chance they have will be gone......
Better than some suggest in my view, there are one or two chilling images along the way in this 'Halloween' inspired drama.
Many of 'Nicolas Cage's' recent efforts had sadly been well below-par with material of little interest to follow, however, though
the film does not stretch the actors ability too far, it does have a story-line that should hold one's interest as the mystery of
'Charlie's' disappearance unfolds..........a better role for 'Nicolas Cage' than many of his recent efforts.

What starts off as a fun trip with his kid to a Halloween carnival becomes a nightmare when the child goes missing. Now Mike (Cage) will stop at nothing to find him. When the one year anniversary comes and still no sign of his son he starts to experience strange things. He hopes these clues will help him, but the more he looks the more eerie things become. There seems to be some actors that seem to be in everything you see. Nicolas Cage is one of those actors. There is a new movie with him coming out constantly, and for people like me who don't like him it seems that it happens more than it should. His last movie, The Runner, wasn't bad and I did like it. Much like that movie this is actually a pretty interesting movie that was fun to watch and did have a little Poltergeist feel to it. As far as Cage goes, much like in The Runner he didn't do anything to distract from the movie and it was good in spite of him. Overall, one of the better horror as well as Cage movies in a while.

7366415,2,B013JA9QDO,"Another round of Nicolas Cage-led nonsense.  He plays a recently tenured university lecturer who goes to a local carnival with his son on Halloween night.  ""Dad, can we pay the ghost?"" the nervous child mysteriously says, and then he vanishes without a trace.  The police can find neither a clue nor a lead, and the Cage character is still grieving and searching for the child he lost a year later.  It is then he begins to suspect a supernatural mystery at play.  This detail sets Pay the Ghost apart from many of the actor's other recent low-budget genre vehicles:  he has searched for an absent, harmed, or stolen child several times (including in a film titled...Stolen), but here the abductor is a ghost in an Insidious/Sinister vein.  A few of the jump scares are nicely executed, albeit highly clichd, and I always enjoy when a film tries to engage with the atmosphere and iconography of October 31st as celebrated in the United States, but this picture is otherwise lazily assembled.  Supporting characters and subplots go nowhere (see:  any scene featuring a disbelieving detective played by Saw-franchise veteran Lyriq Bent.)  The imagery tends toward the absurd, including a giant computer-generated bird of prey shown circling above the city.  Cage is firmly in his sleepy, ambivalent mode for most of the running time, though it is fun to see him give a spirited and wild-eyed reading of ""The Erl-King"" by Goethe early on.  The film even undermines a well-earned intentional laugh when a woman participating in a recreation of a Celtic ritual relents upon Cage-brand intense questioning and admits she is just a nerdy schoolteacher from Queens...but then proceeds to drop an expository bomb of arcane cultural and historical information.",1444435200,,1750,5.038194444444445

all 3 will ruin any movie there in. All you have to do is think who would be better in this part, and you can see the movie improve. But that take
imagination, and isn't that is what art's all about? Allan Rudolph, the director, had a observation, "" They pay these people in Hollywood all that
to make bad art."" Or maybe they get these guys to make their movies like the old studio days- for room and board? No, I don't think so. People

The subplot with the detective didn't go anywhere, in addition they left a foreshadow ending, so I'm thinking the only way to get the whole story is to watch the sequel--which they definitely set it up for.  The ending could have been better, not that it was really bad, but a little more gut-wrenching would have put this movie farther up on my list of recommendations to friends.

7366479,5,B013JA9QDO,"What is that sound you ask? It's Nic Cage cashing in on another huge hit. Pay the Ghost is a full on Cagefest of eye-popping freakouts, outlandish laughter for no reason, and a plot dealing with stolen national artifacts.

Not to be confused with his other Ghost movie ""Ghost Rider,"" Pay the Ghost is a kidnapping mystery. Cage is a broken man, unable to deal with the world around him after making really bad investment deals in castles and dinosaur bones. In order to pay his debts, Cage must make really s***ty films that only appear in Redbox. Since the other main character is a ghost, Cage doesn't have to pay his salary.

Filmed in New Orleans to take advantage of huge film credits that bankroll the production, Cage uses scenes from previous Cage Masterpieces to fill slow moments in the film. For this reason, it may be hard to follow along in the film, which has added scenes dealing with car theft, Las Vegas, breaking out of prison, escaping Hell, being attacked by bees, the Rapture, and Thailand.

Just when you think the movie couldn't get any more Cagey, it loops back to beginning. Turns out the whole thing was really just a weird dream, and Nic Cage was actually watching a movie about himself watching a movie about himself. This film is so amazing that Cage gave himself a Tony Award for his solid performance as best screenplay, best producer, best cameraman, best actor, and best female actress.

Pay The Ghost definitely has its slow spots. But just when I was considering turning it off, something would happen to draw me back in. It's a supernatural thriller more than a horror story. If you don't like movies that have a bit of the hard to believe in them, you may not like this. The climax is exciting, though.

I thought Rage was considerably better than Ghost. It contains interesting themes: How money is not worth a guilty conscience and how past sins can come back to visit one in the most unexpected ways.

Rating the movies individually, I would give Pay The Ghost 3 or 3-and-a-half stars, and Rage 4 or 4-and-a-half stars. So I give the double feature 4 stars overall. The movies are relatively short at 94 and 98 minutes respectively, so if you stick with them you'll end up with relatively enjoyable viewing experiences. Cage brings his trademark intensity to both roles.
