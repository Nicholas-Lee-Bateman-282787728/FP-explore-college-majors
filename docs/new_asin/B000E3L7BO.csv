2486742,5,B000E3L7BO,"Not only the title in saying fantastic, in fact this story is a really fantastic piece of production. Apart from telling any happenings in this anime (I want you to have a full surprise and excitement in watching this anime), the background/plot never goes out of track. It seems like everything in making the scope is well planned and very much in making sense. I admit that at first, it is quite mysterious in those silver hair children running around, with their conversation and the pace is rather slow. Sometimes, the years across the story does give a little pressure for the viewers. However, it successfully gains people's curiosity. The more it goes, the clearer the view of the truth about those children's identities, purpose and everything else. The characters and production design are very beautiful. I love the features of the characters. It can be considered as a fantasy. But more part of it should make this anime a supense anime. It is very hard in making a good supense anime, especially with other components in this anime. I give it 5 stars because everything about it does deserve 5 stars. I believe everyone will love this story.",1225756800,3,1153,4.798994974874372
2486743,4,B000E3L7BO,"This sci-fi anime joins a small but elite group headed by Now and Then, Here and There which have a script and direction good enough to transcend so-so character designs.  If you have patience enough to handle a first disk which is somewhat slow due to necessary situation building, you will be rewarded with what might just be one of the best anime stories you'll ever treat yourself to.

As it begins, a young boy named Tohma befriends two orphanage runaways - Helga, a girl who seems obsessed with drawing a landscape which she can't get out of her head, and Chitto, her devoted little companion, when Tohma finds himself inexplicably drawn to Helga.  Helga in particular does not turn out to be your typical orphan, however, as it turns out she is being tracked down by the Children of Befort - five Belgian albino children who are monstrous, child-killing body snatchers - or so it is said.

But the mysterious Befort children, who are being tracked down in turn by a military-backed scientific organization, might not be exactly what rumour has them, and we slowly learn the true story behind Aghi, the calm, collected but passionate nominal leader of the group; Soreto, the only female of the group who seems to act as a capable second in command; bitter, seemingly cynical Hesma; sensitive, emotional Hasmodye and feisty mechanic Tarlant.

It is a story that involves both Helga and Tohma intimately - and it is  a story of redemption for a terrible decision, a friendship strong enough to forgive the unthinkable, and a love that transcends time and physicality.

With wonderful emotional involvement and - not always a given for anime - a great ending, this anime legends edition is a solid addition to the collection of anyone who prefers substance over flash and is old enough to appreciate the story.  As an end note, the original Japanese is superior enough to the English dub that I would advise viewers to watch the series the first time subtitled even if it is their general policy to watch the dub first.  I would also like to give a heads up to avoid the temptation of examining the timechart on the insert included with the CD of the wonderful, haunting soundtrack to make heads or tails of the deliberate mysteries of the story until you've finished the series, as you'll otherwise realize roughly halfway through the anime that it contains a few spoilers.",1207440000,18,2377,4.763990267639903
2486744,2,B000E3L7BO,"Mysterious anime can be either some of the best or most painful around. The key deciding factor seems to be if the series quickly establishes a solid bedrock around which the hows and whys are obscured or if it just throws a bunch a plotlines out there in a confusing manner. Fantastic Children is one of the latter type which mistakes confusion for mystery and suspense. Plus is it just not entertaining to watch. Each episode lasts only fifteen minutes but the plot is so obtuse and incoherent that it feels three times as long.

These first five episodes introduce no less than five different plotlines. The story primarily centers around the Befort Children, a group of white-haired gifted youngsters with a severely limited lifespan that resurrect in a new body every hundred years. The Befort Children apppear to be looking for something and the key lies in a painter named Christine. Unfortunately, the artist dies before they can track her down. Add to all this, the Children's enemies, both human and supernatural, that seek to impede them. A subplot is also introduced involving a police detective that is tracking missing children, children which happen to be the Befort group's hosts. The perspective then shifts to a tropical island. A boy named Thoma helps a girl named Helga, who bares an uncanny resemblance to Christine, escape from an abusive orphanage. While on the lamb, they encounter a fugitive who appears to be a shriveled old woman but claims to be a teenager. You can definitely see some overlap in these plotlines but Fantastic Children would have been better served to develope one or two of them. The story as it is lacks purpose, shape, or coherency.

On a purely aesthetic note, Fantastic Children utilizes a style of character design that went out with cel-animation. This retro-style uses simple designs and rather unattractive facial features like long beak-like noses and misshapen potatoe heads. This might be a barrier if you are used to the really stream-lined look of recent anime series.",1153699200,3,2027,4.958823529411765
2486745,4,B000E3L7BO,"This series is for those who like mysteries.  We are given small, tanatizing bits and pieces about the children and their past lives, and then in episode four it begins to give the three new characters some depth so we'll care about them and want to find out more.  This series has many layers, which stir up questions like:  What does that picture of a moon and a boat mean?  Who are the 'ghosts' that only some people can see?  What is the source of what seems to be super-technology that the white haired children possess, for which they have been called 'demons'?  And how in heck are they reincarnating themselves?  I'll definitely be checking out disc 2.",1146787200,4,660,4.5423728813559325
2486746,4,B000E3L7BO,"I was introduced to Fantastic Children by its soundtrack, which I enjoyed for it's unique selection of instruments. Though I got the soundtrack with this special edition, it took me some time to watch the included volume of the anime. That being said, I will say that the soundtrack was what made this box so valuable, because after I finally sat down to watch the DVD, I found myself a little confused and put off by what I was seeing in the early episodes.

I'll explain: The story, from what I was able to read about Fantastic Children, was actually what drew me to this rather unremarkable anime. It's about a group of children who seem to be hunting for someone important to their future while running from someone who has hunted them from their past. All of these kids have one major thing in common, and that is their white hair. Some have magical powers, and others are exceptional at fighting, but what is clear is that these children have a history that dates back quite some time. They are known as ""The Children of Befort.""

This is established in the first episode, and in the first episode the main problem I had was also presented. Not only does it jump a decade and more into the future, but it introduces three entirely new and very regular children. One is a martial arts expert who seems to actually be the real hero of the series (a conclusion I came to after watching the DVD the whole way through); the other is a quiet girl who likes to draw pictures; and the last is a young boy who is very protective of the girl.

And then, later, a detective is introduced who seems to be hunting for the Children of Befort... It all was actually a bit too much, and this was in the first three episodes. The bouncing around in the time-lines, and the constant stream of characters, had my head spinning. I was unable to grasp any real storyline until the plot finally focused itself in the fourth episode on Thoma (the martial artist) and his quest to help Helga (the quiet girl) escape from an orphanage. But it still left a lot of questions unanswered, especially regarding the Children of Befort.

Despite all of that, though, I was surprised by how angry I was at being left out of the story. Could it be that Fantastic Children had tricked me with a very subtle cliffhanger? I think so, and looking back I realize that this volume had just enough to catch my interest to where I would definitely purchase the second volume. And not only that, but the animation, which at first seemed a little childish and somewhat dated, turned out to be refreshingly unique with a lot of fluid moments of action. And of course this collection contains the soundtrack, which matches this mysterious anime very well. Because of that, I added a point to the rating. In fact, with the exception of the confusing story (and maybe a somewhat lackluster dub) this is a solid purchase.

As for recommendations, if you enjoyed Now and Then, Here and There then you may find something in Fantastic Children worth watching. While the story in this anime isn't nearly as dramatic as Now and Then, it definitely is the focus over the animation.",1145577600,,3132,4.536283185840708

I like how well Amazon packages its products, will continue to buy from Amazon :) I love the story, it is geared more towards adults than children.

8105338,3,B000E3L7BO,"I deeply regret that I cannot purchase the series due to content and other reasons. I watched the entire series on a certain website and was completely blown away.  The story begins with a scientist who has been reasearching a mysterious group of seven Children that keep appearing throughout Europe and have been doing so for the past five hundred years. The Children are knowmn by their distinct features, particularly by their  white hair and blue eyes. They have been deemed ""The Children of Befort.""because the fictional town of Befort is wbere the children wwere first seen. The scientist attributes their constant reapppearance through history and unchanged physical attributes to some kind of Pact with the Devil (Though this is not the case at all and the theory is only briefly alluded to.). He records his findings and conclusion and even tries to solve the problem in his own twisted way before slipping further into madness and eventually dying.

Meanwhile a Carefree boy named Toma lives with his mother and father on an island where he trains to become fluent in a native martial art. It isn't long before he spots a dazed-looking girl lying motionless on the hands of a statue and staring blankly up at the sky.  He asks many questions but gets no answer or reaction. Eventually it is revealed that she is a resident of an orphanage not too far from Toma's island. Though they seem like very different storyline's they quickly  intertwine into a riveting, spectacular tale with tragic truths and a n all around beautiful story.

That's as much as I can give plotwise. No spoilers.

So why three stars?

Reason One: Violence. Though a lot less violent than some of the things I've seen,  the stories start out rather tame with the aspect of violence before cranking it up quite a few notches.  There is blood when people are wounded or killed. I'd say if you were about thirteen or fourteen you might be ok but this is definetly not for small children.

Reason two: Language. There are about  seven ""D words ""  One  ""Dumb Donkey""  (if you know what I mean) and about three ""S words"" thats for the entire series.  I just find that sort of thing extremely unnecessary.

Reason three (completely Personal): The deeply religious might find themselves quite offended as the series adds a scientific explanation for the soul, what it's made of, and where people go when they die. It also deals with reincarnation and past lives. Personally I think they used these aspect to make quite a story but  I believe they went too far with them.  It's the main reason I won't purchase it to own. that and I saw all of it already.

These three reasons are why I can't really  place my stamp of approval on this series but I'd be lying if I said I didn't like it.",1297123200,4,2761,4.651546391752578
8105339,5,B000E3L7BO,"The thing I like about Fantastic Children is the fresh feeling that surrounds it. The story is exciting, mysterious, new, and extremely well written. The characters are unique, charming, and instantly find a place in your heart. The animation is simply gorgeous, much like a Hayao Miyazaki film. The music is different. Even the English actors bring many different voices to the table.

In short, Fantastic Children is very, very good. Maybe even great.

Story: 10/10
-An exceptional story that never ceases to create tension, suspense, and a sense of adventure, not to mention a very epic and wide scope. Each episode introduces a new mystery, while at the same time constantly solving the riddles from before. As the story unfolded I discovered I was very involved with it all. A giant adventure that transcends time. A forbidden romance, so strong it clings to life and won't let go. Mysteries so large, so dangerous, that many would kill to keep them secret.

It is an epic tale that I really enjoyed. The beginning is perfect. And the end is great too.

Characters:10/10
-There are many main characters throughout the span of the series. The children of befort are odd, white haired children who keep their distance from everyone else. Thoma is a young man who has great ambitions and a strong heart (he reminds me of Disney's Aladin a little). Helga is the quiet young girl from the orphanage. Her young friend Chito will do anything to protect her. Then there's the detective, his assistant, and many more.

The cast is giant. But the anime manages to tell their story well, and by the end all the characters are fully explained. By the end. I emphasize END. In the beginning the series introduces alot of characters and not alot of back story. But as the story moves along we get to know them.

This might upset the impatient, but if you can handle it and are planning on watching all 26 episodes then you'll be fine.

Animation:11/10
-Gorgeous. Simple, yet very detailed. It looks just like a Hayao Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli film. It even rivals much of Miyazaki's work. I was blown away. There isn't any re-used animation too, which is a definate plus when it comes to anime tv series.

The quaint and cute vibe of it might intrigue young childen. Don't let the kids watch this one-I'll explain that later.

Music:10/10
-Gorgeous violin and piano pieces drive the series forward. The music is beautiful.

English Dub:8/10
-Not one of the best dubs I've heard, though it is exceptional in some ways. The cast is large and every character has a different voice. Plus there are plenty of different accents, which I find very useful in creating a sense of reality.

Still, the dub isn't perfect. It might annoy those who are too hard-headed and are bugged by even the slightest bad dub. I wasn't too annoyed by it, as it is okay.

Overall: 10/10
A great anime. The beginning might leave the impatient with the itches, but those willing to stick with it and see the series through will be rewarded with a great adventure/romance anime that provides alot of eye candy-if you enjoy Ghibli films.

Rating:13 and up
-Accurate. Its 13 and up for a reason. The beginning might be mild, but as the series progresses the content gets more mature...and much more violent. There is some language, and some mild drug use. The violence is bloody, and at times startling. A man has his arm blown off. There are shots to the head and chest. Blood splatters frequently. Definately not for the young. There are also some scary moments where dark creatures try to overcome some of the main characters. Rather dark and kind of frightening. So: if you're 13 or older, you're fine. Any younger and I'd be cautious.",1273968000,4,3696,4.729393468118196
8105340,5,B000E3L7BO,"I strongly recommend watching this anime.

The Good:
The music is amazing and always sets the right mood (for you Origa fans, she's fantastic in the ending song) and the emotion is strong, especially towards the end. There's more than one surprise and many of the characters are memorable, most notably the 2 main characters for their intense bond.

The Bad:
Animation is not up to par with other animes released in the same year making it appear to be geared more towards a younger audience when it really isn't.

Suggestion:
Read my review for Now and then Here and there...this is the only anime series I've seen that can measure up to it so if you agreed with my review on that anime then certainly you'll want to give this a chance.",1253404800,,737,4.526315789473684
8105341,5,B000E3L7BO,"In today's world of anime, everything is pretty much a boring remake (or of borrowed ideas) of an older anime. Nothing really new. For a person like myself who has loved anime since I was small, picking up this series entitled Fantastic Children was a great add to my collection! The series tries many bold things such as incorporating many themes (drama, adventure, etc.) into one epic story. It doesn't succeed 100%, but it does rather well though. The story starts off pretty slow and it seems like an anime geared towards kids (Howl's Flying Castle, etc.), but it changes route about 1/3 of the way through. After that, hang onto your seats because things are going to start coming together in a way you'd not expect. Is that a good thing? It is to me. The series is unique not only in today's over massed market of blunt anime(s), but it's also unique enough on it's own. There is no other anime quite like it. It is probably the most under-appreciated anime of all time.",1243123200,5,976,4.551136363636363
