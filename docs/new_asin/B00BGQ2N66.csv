8568287,3,B00BGQ2N66,"The Crow is the best of the films in this lot and the only one worth watching sober.  It showcases the promising talent in Bruce Lee's son Brandon and emphasizes the tragedy in his early death.  If I was only reviewing The Crow, I'd probably give it 4 stars which tells you what I think of the rest of these films.  ;-)
This new version of Conan shines with effects and deadly action but somehow lacks the spirit and humor of Arnold's version.  Jason Mamoa presents a convincing figure as Conan but the movie itself just lacks soul.
The Spirit is ... spiritless -- a rather disheartening way to present Wil Eisner's seminal work -- and The Punisher is punishing.  Worst of all was Kick Ass.  Really bad writing coupled with mediocre acting ... truth in advertising would compel them to replace the first two letters in the title with S and U.",1450051200,,842,4.470588235294118

8568289,5,B00BGQ2N66,"You get at least 3 good movies (the crow, the punisher and kick ass) i haven't seen the others yet, but its a sweet deal to get all 5 movies for the Price of one!",1406160000,,162,3.657142857142857
8568290,4,B00BGQ2N66,"we already had 3 of the movies but my wife wanted one of the ones we didn't have.  As there are 5 movies in this set, it allowed us to actually save 3 movie spaces.  If you like a few of the movies collections are the way to go imho.",1380758400,,233,3.64
8568291,3,B00BGQ2N66,"The blu-rays themselves are all great. I hadn't seen any of the movies except for The Crow, so I was excited to see the other four...for the most part I was disappointed. I'll break down the movies separately.

Conan the Barbarian, aside from a odd appearances by Ron Perlman and Rose McGowan the movie had next to nothing going for it. Jason Mamoa did a fine job as Conan, but I think he did better as Khal Drogo on Game of Thrones when he could barely speak English. The action was okay, but overall the movie was forgettable. I would not watch it again. ""2 Stars.""

The Spirit, I saw the trailers for this movie when it came out, and was intrigued, but never went to see it. Turns out I didn't miss anything. Nothing really happened in this movie. It was incredibly slow. A great cast of actors was left standing around doing nothing. ""1 Star""...only because I can't give it ""Zero Stars.""

The Punisher, it's pretty good up until the family reunion scene. If that scene had been the climax to the film it would have been so much better. After that the Punisher as a superhero just falls flat. John Travolta shows up as the villain and is probably the best part of the movie after the first half hour. ""2 Stars.""

The Crow, a thoroughly enjoyable film. I see somethings that may have influenced Christopher Nolan in the Dark Knight trilogy, most notably the make up is similar to that of the Joker's. The story of how Brandon Lee died on set is also surprising. It's impossible to tell when he is on screen and when he isn't. This is the first movie I've talked about that you really should see from this collection.""4 Stars.""

Kick Ass, I thought that The Crow would be my favorite movie in this collection after watching the others...but then I watched Kick Ass. Absolutely hilarious from start to finish. I can't think of one thing I didn't like about this film. Go watch it immediately. ""5 Stars.""

Over all I would suggest getting Kick Ass and The Crow separately. If this turns out to be cheaper then I suppose you could get this, but really you don't need the other three movies so save your money if you can. I wouldn't recommend a one time watch of anyone them to be perfectly honest. I love bad B-movies, but bad A-movies are just bad A-movies...not worth your time.",1374364800,8,2278,4.45083932853717
8568292,4,B00BGQ2N66,"I recently picked this up at my local Target on sale for about $16 and I could not be happier with the purchase. What I like is:

a.) All the discs are in one, slightly thin case. It's a bit thicker than most blu-rays but it is also five discs - no double-sided ones or two movies on one. I like that. Makes me think that they'll still be quality copies and not overly compressed.

b.) The discs are all their normal retail versions, including bonus features. I tested this out by putting The Crow on and watching through some of the supplementals. Usually I'm afraid that in collections like this, they'll strip down the bonus features to make up for the reduced price since they're not advertised on the back of the package.

c.) The variety is pretty good, though the movies are not necessarily what I think of when I hear ""Comic Book Movies."" Perhaps this was put out to cash in on some of the Iron Man 3 hype, but all of these movies are of a darker, adult nature and are for the most part based off of more adult comics. It's a nice little shelf booster to start a growing blu-ray collection.

And there lies the only really fault in the collection. Just the movie selection. All of these movies are fine being paired up together - not complaining there. But that doesn't mean that I enjoy The Spirit at all. I watched it for the first time on this collection, and... I was frankly surprised of how bad it was. Just an insanely bad movie. The Pluto Nash of comic book movies. Maybe I need to watch it again, but I did not enjoy it at all the first time around. The Crow and Kick-Ass I'm already a fan of. Just finishing up The Punisher right now and am finding myself to be a big fan of it. Only one I haven't watched at this point is Conan, but even for those other three, I think my purchase was pretty much worth it.

And with that, another complaint I have is with the Punisher blu-ray release, but that's the same one that's available on Amazon right now. It's not that the movie looks bad or anything, it's just there's nothing to the disc aside from the movie. There's an embarrassing ""How-To"" message that explains how to access the movie's menu which loops once the movie is over and then starts the movie again - no bonus features, no commentary, etc. I love that kind of stuff. I'm guessing this disc was initially released at the start of blu-ray when they were just trying to rush out titles without putting as much thought into the package as they had when they released it on DVD.

So if you enjoy the darker side of comic book adaptations, this is a nice addition to your collection, and it won't take up as much space as five separate cases would on your shelf. Aside from a dud title and a bland disc, it's a nice little package.",1368230400,21,2753,4.294797687861272
