7613911,4,B01AXCTPP0,"In a time when a demagogue is becoming president, a man who feeds off of bitter and scathing belittlement of anyone who disagrees with him, this movie is a powerful testament of what is called for from most of us. Bonhoeffer confront Hitler from the first days he came to power. He challenged his use of force and treat to silence clergy and to put in place his anti-Semitic policies. Unlike most of his fellow clergymen, and his fellow citizens, he was not willing to compromise and to ""Give Hitler time to come around"" because he knew what he would do, and had already done, and stood up to him. As a result of his efforts to take the ultimate measures to get rid of Hitler, he knew, if he failed, his life would be in danger. Yet he went ahead and paid for it. Hitler had him hanged weeks before the was ended.",1483833600,3,813,4.285714285714286

8748796,4,B01AXCTPP0,"A great combination of historic background and biography, A lot of first hand memories of Bonhoeffer and the times in which he lived. Very moving (and appropriately disturbing) without being ""preachy."" Would be a five star for content, but there are some unfortunate technical limitations: there are no ""chapters,"" so finding a place where one might wish to return is difficult. Some of the dialogue is hard to understand, and the closed captioning is sometimes difficult to read as it blends with the background.",1510704000,,513,5.119047619047619

8748798,5,B01AXCTPP0,Very good book.  I wish it was longer and had more details.  I wish it had more about his activity and direct contact with the resistance.  I had to go to some different resources to find more about him and still there are some mysteries.,1506211200,,238,4.2444444444444445
8748799,5,B01AXCTPP0,Very insightful film. It helped to gain greater clarification of Bonhoeffer's purpose as a disciple for justice. The film is very moving.,1505088000,,137,5.2727272727272725
