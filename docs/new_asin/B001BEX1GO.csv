3491376,5,B001BEX1GO,"I just purchased your DVD and I'm so pleased to have such an affordable, useful resource for learning to sign with my daughter. Many of the signs were familiar to me, but it was nice to see the baby modifications. My husband isn't familiar with signing at all, so we are learning together. We're hoping that starting when our daughter is three months old will lead to greater communication and fewer tantrums down the road. Thanks, Louise, for providing something immediately useful to time-stressed parents!",1220140800,3,508,4.988235294117647
3491377,3,B001BEX1GO,"I bought this dvd to help supplement some of the other singing-signing DVDs I bought for my infant son. My 9 year old and I watched it and learned quite a few signs, however, I would do as recommended by the video and go at it slowly or it can be quite overwhelming to try and remember too many at once. There is not a lot repetition, but I guess that is what the Rewind button is for. Would I buy it again? Probably not.",1304985600,,421,3.9647058823529413
3491378,2,B001BEX1GO,This video is just okay.  There are many other videos that have have more visual supports and are much more interactive.  I bought this video primarily for the Spanish section which is also just okay.  It is rather boring!  There are so few signing videos in spanish that this is better than nothing...but not great!,1284940800,,316,4.6909090909090905
3491379,5,B001BEX1GO,I LOVE how easy to follow it is...you connect things so logically...usually videos like this I see are so random...they don't hook the phrases together...be it learning Spanish or something else.  I am following you so easily as I watch right now...and it is entertaining! Well done!,1268524800,,283,5.0212765957446805
3491380,5,B001BEX1GO,"Babies and Toddlers are amazing...they communicate even before they can speak.  They know how to connect with those around them...but often, adults don't clearly understand what the child is trying to communicate.  This product will help with building great two way communication that will improve and strengthen the relationship between adult and child. Louise Sattler has done an awesome job with this product Baby, Toddler and Preschool Sign Language.  I interviewed her quite some time ago and found her to not only be knowledgable but very engaging.",1267833600,,554,5.344827586206897

Whether you have a special needs child, work with them or simply want to enhance your skills and education, this DVD is user friendly and cost effective that everyone should take advantage of opportunity to broaden your knowledge.

The bilingual aspect is an added bonus!",1252886400,,576,4.476190476190476

3491385,4,B001BEX1GO,I am a grandmother of both a grandson who has speech and language delays and a bilingual grandaughter and found this DVD so helpful for me and my husband.

3491386,5,B001BEX1GO,"Tried signing with my daughter as recommended by several friends. I found this DVD to be most helpful in establishing sign communication, start with the basics and continue to learn and understand your childs requests.
I'm having fun with my new communication skills and especially when my daughter learns a new sign! I find myself signing to other adults and children as a force of habit.",1228608000,,389,4.909090909090909

8283078,1,B001BEX1GO,It's mostly in English when you said it played in Spanish.,1452470400,,58,4.363636363636363

8283080,4,B001BEX1GO,"Very educational, just not what I was expecting. I was hoping the DVD had more child involvement/interaction but it is geared more toward teaching adults how to sign and then using what is learned to teach your child, which still useful!",1446595200,,237,4.804878048780488
8283081,5,B001BEX1GO,this movie help my kids alot,1409529600,,28,3.8333333333333335
8283082,1,B001BEX1GO,"it felt stiff, and I didn't like the ""now go practice"" breaks in it. it was not engaging for my toddler at all, she preferred the brainy baby or signing time series - those were engaging and felt more tailored to teaching a child.",1397088000,,230,4.25
8283083,5,B001BEX1GO,Not your usual sign language video - this one is from a parents' perspective and very helpful.  The addition of Spanish and captions was a surprise. I follow LouiseASL on twitter and I have admired her commitment to helping others.... it shows in all of her work.,1394150400,,263,4.595744680851064
8283084,5,B001BEX1GO,"I highly recommend this for parents!  signing really helps kids communicate before they are able to verbally tell parents what they want.
It  decrease tantrum and reduces stress. Run out and buy it you won't be sorry!",1394064000,,217,4.837837837837838
8283085,5,B001BEX1GO,The instructor on this DVD explained why the signs are as they are. My 3 year old Grandson is learning coordination with his fingers and can do many of the signs already and we have only just gotten the DVD. We love it!!,1364860800,,220,4.1395348837209305
