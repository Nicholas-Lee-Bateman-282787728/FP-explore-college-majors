James White is very well trained in debate, poise, pride, and theological presuppositional error, but he is not very well trained in the Bible in context of what it teaches. Coverdale put it well in the forward to his Bible.
""It shall greatly help ye to understand the Scriptures if thou mark not only what is spoken or written, but of whom and to whom, with what words, at what time, where, to what intent, with what circumstances, considering what goeth before and what followeth after. "" James White is well studied in Reformed Theology as Calvin was well studied in Augustinian theology. They both are well informed in extra biblical information and do not come close to teaching in the mindset of what Coverdales Quote entails. If you follow Reformed theologies method of Exegesis then when reading the following verses your conclusion would  be that the name of God would have to be CHANCE. Because Reformed/Calvinists do not believe in chance.
Luke 10:31  And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

1 Samuel 6:9  And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.

2 Samuel 1:6 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

Ecclesiastes 9:11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

Deuteronomy 22:6 If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:",1358726400,2,2108,4.38974358974359
8314107,5,B001K12LQ4,"I had been a part of Calvary Chapels (the Arminian group whom Mr. George Bryson represented here) for some years, and was serving on ministerial staff with one when this debate took place. For some time I had begun to question many of the doctrinal teachings held by Chuck Smith and his churches, but could never get any straight-forward, biblically consistent/honest answers. Often times I was met with frowning disapproval for even daring to question Pastor Chuck's teaching. Truth be told- I had spent years studying the Bible like a good ""Berean"", and as a result was becoming increasingly convinced that much of what Calvary Chapel was teaching was in error.

So it is that when this debate occurred, it was truly a ""god-send"" for me. Here it was that many of the same issues I was struggling with were finally going to be addressed out in the open, by two men representing each of the opposing positions. Here, there could be no ""straw man"" analogies set up to discredit the opposition without consequence... no deliberate misrepresentations...no playing fast & loose with the sacred texts. All such attempts would be quickly exposed here.

As we gathered around to witness this debate, I soon found I was not to be disappointed. Dr. James White proved to be every bit the scholar his doctorate attested to, and then some. He was poised, well prepared, and congenial through-out, despite attempts by Mr. Bryson to insult and ruffle him.
As for Mr. George Bryson, the ""champion"" of the Arminian cause...the ""big gun"" sent from Costa Mesa itself... he came off like an ill prepared, and increasingly emotional AMATEUR.
While Dr. White patiently and concisely laid out the Scriptural points for his position, and was careful to exegete them for the audience; Mr. Bryson defiantly stated his ASSUMPTIONS, followed by a staccato-fire of text addresses which supposedly supported his assumptions, yet he so much as bothered to attempt the exegesis of even ONE of them... and this was the kind of thing Calvary chapels had been attempting to pass off as ""Biblical scholarship"" for years! It was all truly revealing...

This was no David -vs- Goliath match up; no, it was more akin to a majestic eagle in the form of Dr. White, expertly dispatching a frantic loony-bird as represented by Mr. Bryson. So pathetic was the disparity between the two. In short- Mr. Bryson got ""SCHOOLED"" by the master... Dr. James White, and I do confess...it was great to behold!

Needless to say, after witnessing Dr. White exercise such class, poise, and true Biblical scholarship against Mr. Bryson's hack attempts at pseudo-scholarship, where emotional appeal is their key tool; I soon decided it was time to leave Calvary Chapel, and find a fellowship like Dr. White's to attend.
Happily, I have found just such a fellowship within the Reformed Baptist Churches, and my quest for Biblical faithfulness, consistency, and scholarship are now satisfied.

In conclusion, if you are like me and are looking to witness the Calvinist -vs- Arminian arguments laid out for examinations; this video is for you. You'll not see ALL of the various points of Calvinism -vs- Arminianism debated, just the more essential ones.
God used it to change my life, and I'm sure it will do the same for you.",1302048000,14,3266,4.930909090909091
8314108,5,B001K12LQ4,"This is an excellent debate (on 2 DVD's)...Dr. James White is at his best defending the true gospel of God's wonderful Sovereign grace and eternal love for all true believers (known in the Bible as God's elect). ""How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation!"" The result is clear...both human responsibility and the sovereignty of God are discussed here, and you wish they had more time to debate
this important issue. The truth needs to be made known in these days of apostasy...
Highly recommended!",1270598400,9,508,4.850574712643678
