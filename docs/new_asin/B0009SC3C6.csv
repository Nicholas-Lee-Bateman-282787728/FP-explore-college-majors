8066140,5,B0009SC3C6,"Bought it for my sister who asked for it specifically. This will work, but you have to use it faithfully until you achieve some semblance of a routine. I'd definitely buy this again, low impact and effective workout.",1389571200,4,216,4.7105263157894735
8066141,5,B0009SC3C6,"In 2003, I began my weight loss journey. By 2005 I had lost 150 pounds but still needed some tightening up.  I saw this on an infomercial and was intrigued.  I'm disabled, only 35 now, having been in 3 serious car wrecks it's very difficult for me to do anything strenuous.  This tape saved me. In three months, doing this workout everyday... I got rid of my double chin, my tummy had flattened, and my thighs actually fit into smaller pants.  This workout really works.  If you do it correctly, you do get your heartbeat up, you do sweat, you will ABSOLUTELY tighten up.  It's entirely too easy.  Sitting in a chair and doing the goofy breathing & stretches.  I thank God for this.  It allowed me to take off the final 25 pounds.  I just had a baby in September and I'm looking forward to getting off the last 30 pounds from that.  Thank you so much Greer!  I know I will succeed again with your help.",1368489600,8,902,4.303571428571429
8066142,5,B0009SC3C6,"I have been using Body Flex products since the 80's and will keep using them. I wish Greer would put the original Body Flex on DVD so I didn't have to keep buying the VHS, but if that is all I can get I will keep doing it. I tell friends all the time how wonderful it is and have purchased programs to give away.",1357516800,4,312,3.8153846153846156
8066143,1,B0009SC3C6,"This second (current) workout is almost useless - you do not feel stretching or anything, all done in a sitting position - like for seniors or handicapped people. The first one, that it is not sold anymore, was much better even though very limited too. I just added my own routine with the same breathing technique.",1305849600,5,315,4.642857142857143
