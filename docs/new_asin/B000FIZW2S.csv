8123499,5,B000FIZW2S,"This series was so fantastic the animation was amazing. At a time when most computer animated shows were using strand rendered hair (which looked horrible) Action Man used more of a sculpted look, which made for great looking designs. If I remember correctly this show came out around the same time as Transformers Beast Machines (which also had great art direction) I hope some day the whole series will be released!",1333843200,,417,4.887323943661972
