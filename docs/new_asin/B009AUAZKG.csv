5309568,5,B009AUAZKG,"I had been trying to copy my tapes from reruns to DVD, but tapes are flaking off.  This is a series that I always put everything else aside to watch.  I am anxiously awaiting Vol-3! This is the series where Mark Fleming learned his tricks he played to more devious means as J.R. Ewing",1359504000,2,284,4.2407407407407405
5309569,4,B009AUAZKG,"Brilliant actors, entertaining oldfashioned and very stylish rogue stories. For everyone looking for high quality entertainement. Picture quality not near todays standards.",1358294400,,172,6.863636363636363
5309570,5,B009AUAZKG,I remembered watching these delighful Rogues when I was a  young teenager. These are extremely well written and suberbly acted stories.  Rarely has television produced such high quality fun.  It was wonderful to remember the days when high quality entertainment with great actors was available on television on a weekly basis.  Thank you for hours of fun with The Rogues.,1358121600,5,371,5.133333333333334
5309571,5,B009AUAZKG,"This is a great show not seen on reruns. Although only on for one season it had a great cast of some
famed actors.  A family of con artists uses their skills  to help someone who has gotten into
a bad situation.  In many ways similar to Leverage which was recently on TNT without the modern technology.",1357948800,2,302,4.2631578947368425
5309572,1,B009AUAZKG,"My Husband was so excited to receive the DVD of this series, he had these on tapes and wanted the DVD's which are in short supply.  Very pleased with item and quality of the DVD's.",1357603200,,180,4.142857142857143
5309573,5,B009AUAZKG,Fantastic to have this wonderful show available,1417910400,,47,5.857142857142857
5309574,5,B009AUAZKG,"Wrote a review for Volume one. Same goes for Volume two. The four stars are truly pros and the supporting cast is made up of players who had honed their craft in numerous movies. They all came from the Studio Ststem of the 30's and 40's that kept all of them busy and the result is true craftsmenship. I watch them over and over, Volume one and two.",1417564800,3,349,4.147058823529412
5309575,5,B009AUAZKG,Haven't seen these in many years.  So nice to follow The Rogues.,1410652800,,64,4.333333333333333

5309577,5,B009AUAZKG,"Ever since I first saw the TV series many decades ago, I have been searching for it on DVD. Finally, someone figured out that making a little money is better than making none at all! Or whatever it took to release the series. When I saw that The Rogues was available, I immediately ordered it, didn't even care about the quality of the copy. But as soon as I fed it into the DVD player and heard that iconic theme music, I was transported back in time. Absolutely terrific! Good quality of the copy (at least the episodes I've enjoyed), good sound, wide screen, and very entertaining.",1401494400,3,584,4.4672897196261685
5309578,5,B009AUAZKG,"This is my favorite television series from the early 1960s.
The quality of writing is extremely high - to continues to make engaging viewing even after fifty years.

In this series, women are treated as more than ""adornment"".  Unlike most of the serie s of that era, women are treated as highly intelligent and completely capable creatures. Most of the episodes feature a strong female character, or two, who actively take part in the plot.

I have never been a big  fan of Charles Boyer.  He played the classic ""come wiz me to da Casbah"" French lover on the 1930s and 1940s.  By the time this series was filmed, he acted totally against type - deftly playing light comedy. He even gently mocks his screen persona..

Pease note there were thirty episodes of this series filmed. Each of these volumes only has TEN of these episodes.",1400716800,4,831,4.6506849315068495
5309579,5,B009AUAZKG,"Loved the show in the 70's. Looking forward to watching it in the near future. In the old days , the good guys always won.",1393977600,,122,3.92
5309580,5,B009AUAZKG,"Although the prints are only adequate, and the image shows up on my HDTV in a faux 16:9 fullscreen mode, it is still great to have more episodes from ""The Rogues"" (I already bought teh vol 1 collection) a single season comedy adventurer series from 1964 about an international family of virtuous conmen and thieves (played by major stars David Niven & Charles Boyer, along with Gig Young) who never steal from anybody who can't afford (or deserve) it.

Nelson Riddle's infectious theme music is also of merit, sticking in your mind along with the clever plots, which may have run foul of the ""crime shouldn't pay"" attitude of the period, and which would be allowed on TV a few years later when done by government agents in ""Mission Impossible"" or ""It Takes a Thief"".  ""The Rogues"" may also be seen as the dramatic predecessor of modern series like ""Leverage"".",1376956800,4,859,4.72
5309581,5,B009AUAZKG,"I watched these fine television episodes way back in high school, and I loved them! Great acting and great actors, particularly David Niven and Charles Boyer. The stories told have suspense, but mostly these episodes should be watched for their humour.",1371254400,,252,5.170731707317073

8538660,5,B009AUAZKG,The Rogues was one of television's finest moments. I've been hoping for a DVD reissue for years and was overjoyed to fine it had finally been reissued. I snapped it up and loved it.,1521417600,,181,4.352941176470588

8538664,5,B009AUAZKG,"This reproduction of old recordings was very well done.  There were few flaws and they were almost imperceptible.
A great job on a fine show.",1443830400,2,141,4.64
8538665,5,B009AUAZKG,"This series didn't last long and in that it's too bad. Originally airing at 10 PM Sunday night on NBC it was regularly clobbered by ""Candid Camera"" and ""What's My Line?"" over on CBS. But it had both the star power  and class which made in memorable.",1438646400,,249,4.297872340425532
