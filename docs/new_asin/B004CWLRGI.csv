4329255,5,B004CWLRGI,"Well, I love the Montalbano series.  We see the soft side and the thuggish side of Montalbano as he tries to solve cases in his town.
Montalbano works with a mixed crew of characters and I also love them.  We see bad guys caught by happenstance.  We see Montalbano conflicted about continuing in his career.  We see the folly of elderly Mafia leaders passing on old grudges to their clan.
Luca Zingaretti plays Montalbano with insight into the single male inspector who takes a daily swim, loves to have someone else cook for him, listens patiently to the comments of his officers and always bring a particular sensitivity to solving a case. Apparently Luca Zingaretti played this role on Italian TV for many years.  Bravo.  Find your inner Italian and watch this series.",1366156800,,771,4.7593984962406015
4329256,5,B004CWLRGI,"The scenery is lush, the story lines unfold well and keep you in suspense.  Solving the mystery and the personal developments keep you wanting more. It's also a great way to learn Italian and the nuances and pronunciation of the language.",1366070400,,238,4.804878048780488
4329257,5,B004CWLRGI,I am a huge fan of Montalbano and have read the Camilleri stories.  Anyone who loves Italy will enjoy these stories.,1362009600,,116,4.523809523809524
4329258,5,B004CWLRGI,"Our Inspector Salvo Montalbano, who works in the fictional town of ""Vigta"", in the equally fictional district of ""Montelusa"" in Sicily. Where the Sun is bright and life treads at a different pace, amongst classic bleached white villages and towns that would look out of place in a tourist guide book. In this almost Mediterranean idle there is darkness, decay and at times murder.

He and the members of Vigata's small police force, namely Mim Augello, Montalbano's second-in-charge, Fazio, Gallo, Galluzzo and the incredibly stupid yet very likeable Catarella, who mans the station's phones, among other minor tasks. While his whole team have suffered from his out bursts, and sometime strange management style he cares for them and in turn they are all very loyal to him, none more so than his girlfriend of 8 plus years. Salvo is a foodie, with a passion, and he rarely permits anything to get between him and good meal, including other social commitments. He is also an avid swimmer; so much so, his apartment is set on the beach front. While his girlfriend, Livia, has to compete with his detective work, we find in the latter series that he will take Livia on a short romantic holiday, although he is using this pretext to further his investigations. He also brings the new love of his life, in the form of a big black shaggy dog. As it turns out, this dog is the key to his latest case.
Luca Zingaretti who plays the major role really brings the detective to life; his characterisation for me is spot on. His case work always varied, and never what you would expect to happen happens - there are red herrings and misdirection!
In Salvo's work nothing is black and white; mainly his cases are in the grey zone. As one reviewer put it his cases do not have happy endings, while his investigations sometimes leads to organized crime, his stories rarely get totally focused on the Mafia rather they are part of the landscape and environment of where he works in and around.

The last few years have seen a plethora of foreign detective series from around Europe each series of any real credit brings fresh cultural nuances, behaviour and identity of their own. After years of British and American detective series these shows, are like a new revelation. While some may hate subtitles I can assure you that to see and hear these shows as they were originally broadcast is always best and I find them all the more enjoyable.",1355443200,13,2425,4.7035294117647055
4329259,5,B004CWLRGI,"I have read almost all of Camelleri's books in the ""Inspector Montalbano"" series, and these DVD movies give the correct feeling about the character of Inspector Montalbano. He has heart and yet at the same time he illustrates unusual intelligence in a policeman-Detective in charge of a small town police force. Most main characters in these type of movies usually take all the credit even when others contribute to solving a crime. Sometimes Inspector Montalbano doesn't even let anyone except the viewer of the DVD know that he has solved the crime. He solves situations taking into consideration every person involved and does the ""right thing"" whether it is according to the written law or not. The actor chosen to play the role of Inspector Montalbano is superb. Camelleri's books describe Inspector Montalbano's thoughts and internal arguments within ""Montalbano 1 and Montalbano 2"" which is not done in the DVD's, but the actor manages to show through visual facial expressions or body language as well as dialogue what is happening in Montalbano's mind and emotions. I love Camelleri's books and was not disappointed by the DVD's. In fact after seeing the full set of all episodes of Inspector Montalbano, I decided to buy the few books I have not read yet.",1353196800,,1265,5.0
4329260,5,B004CWLRGI,"It is fascinating to watch a series in the original Italian with English subtitles. I thought I would find it difficult.  In fact, it makes it a richer and more enjoyable experience.  The cast is wonderful.  I had read all the books, and they are following the stories well.  Just a great series.  I want to go to Italy now.",1348012800,3,324,4.333333333333333
4329261,5,B004CWLRGI,"I have now purchased 18 of these movie discs from Amazon, and they are really terrific. Not only are the movies very well done and enjoyable for repeat viewings, but the photography of Sicily is so beautiful I keep thinking it will be absolutely my next place to visit if and when I feel like traveling to Europe again.

More than any other film or TV I've ever watched, I almost literally feel as if Im right there on this beautiful island instead of merely seeing pictures of it!

But the extra value of them for me, persoanally, is that listening to them repeatedly has done surprising wonders for my understadning of the language, of which I had but a smattering before although I've always wanted to be fairly fluent in it.

The background music for this series is also great by the way. All in all, the discs are a real delight!",1347840000,18,834,4.437908496732026
4329262,5,B004CWLRGI,"We have been hooked on this great series of mysteries from Sicily!  His personality and those of his subordinates in addition to the native population are great entertainment and a look into their culture.

Our only regret is that there are only 22 episodes!",1345248000,4,258,4.840909090909091
4329263,5,B004CWLRGI,"I was not familiar with this author, but purchased the first three episodes of the television series based on an Amazon review. And I am so glad I did. We really enjoy these. The only complaint we had at first was that the English subtitles were too fast. But either they have been slowed down or we are reading faster,because it no longer seems to be a problem  we are up to episode 10).

The characters are interesting, the actors do a great job, the views of Sicily and the Mediterrian are beautiful,and it is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.

Don't let the subtitle thing bother you. We have also watched all of the Swedish-made Wallender television series, and you don't even notice after a short while.

We have to make an effort not to watch them all at once as soon as they ome.",1317168000,7,785,4.468531468531468
4329264,5,B004CWLRGI,"This series about Detective Montabano is set in Sicily and is based on the mystery novels of Andrea Camilleri. The cinematography is exceptional as is the acting. The characters look like ordinary people instead of showy actors. Very believable. The series follows the books better than most. The subtitles are easy to follow. All in all, we've enjoyed the episodes we've watched so far.",1302912000,15,387,5.0625

If you want a no brainer slow paced mystery set in Italy with fun, real world characters buy this series.
Just do not get too rapped up in the little nuances like the fact that there is never other cars on the streets he drives inlol

4329285,2,B004CWLRGI,"This could've been a 5 star story. It had everything - mystery & stylish narrative, capturing real Italian atmosphere (I know, I grew up in Italy). This book rings true in describing the texture of Italian food, language & life. I wanted to recapture all that, because I miss it, but the overly graphic descriptions of sex crimes and the focus on the humiliating display of the victim's body made me sick. Why is the violation of a woman considered entertainment? Agatha Christie, G.K. Chesterton, Dorothy L. Sayers, all could write mysteries without making you feel assaulted and degraded. Utterly revolting and so disappointing.",1379116800,2,630,5.0673076923076925
