I've been shopping for Christmas and knew I wanted to purchase this for a few gifts and am disappointed to learn it has yet to be released on DVD. It's so rare I find a great comedian that I can watch again & again. I love the realistic bits on eating, religion, gifts, gays, etc. with truth backing it up. Ricky Gervais is a comedic genius.  Please advise when this will be out in stores.",1322352000,,556,4.3173076923076925
8427597,5,B004EPYZJE,"Normally, I would give this a 4/5 rating, but I gave it the extra point cuz of 2 points he made that I STRONGLY agree with. 1 point is that ""fat people"" ALLOW themselves to get that way. They can do something about it, but they don't. That's their choice. The 2nd point is that the Christian religion doesn't make much logical sense when you actually think about it. For these 2 reasons, I love this comedy routine a lil more.

I've always liked Ricky Gervais. He's funny. I gotta watch the 1st one now that I've seen the 2nd.",1308528000,2,526,4.26
