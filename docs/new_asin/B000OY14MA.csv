8187122,5,B000OY14MA,"Sharon is great, routines are great but the music not all that great at times. I love her DVD's! Fun!",1401321600,,101,4.1
8187123,5,B000OY14MA,"I really enjoyed this DVD.  It has great variety in it.  She changes often so you never get bored.  Some music is not my type but for the most part I enjoyed the music.  She uses the same weight throughout but I found it best to change.  I use 1-15 lb dumbbell when she uses 1 dumbbell.  I again use 1-15 lb dumbbell when she puts two in one hand.  Otherwise, I use 2-9 lb dumbbells.  Sharon has a great personality.  I never find her annoying.  Her cueing isn't perfect but the moves in this are pretty basic so it is okay.  When she lifts the step bench it may feel silly but she is just being innovative so I give her credit for that.",1381190400,,637,4.016
8187124,4,B000OY14MA,"This video is a thorough high intermediate to advanced workout incorporating step/floor cardio cycles with dumb bell weight training.  Instructor is energetic and provides good cueing.  The workout is over 60 minutes but 3 shorter pre-mixes are available.  The moves are basic but higher impact.  Not meant for bad knees.  Overall, would recommend for the seasoned exerciser who wants a good total body and cardiovascular workout.  The only awkward segment of the workout comes at the end when she uses the step as resistance to work the upper body:  very hard to securely hold a step with both hands and do front raises etc...  Dumb bells or a weighted bar are easily substituted for this section.",1277510400,,698,4.956896551724138
8187125,3,B000OY14MA,On personal preference I gave this a 3 star; I just can't stand the music.,1277164800,,74,4.0
8187126,3,B000OY14MA,High paced step aerobic--very choreographed. I found it difficult to learn so now I improvise and manage to keep up.  Weigh training incorporated into step is good.  Excellent for advanced exercisers.,1233532800,,200,5.419354838709677
8187127,5,B000OY14MA,"I own a couple of Sharon's workouts and both are fantastic. She may not be as glamorous as some other instructors, but she has awesome workouts with great music and excellent cuing. This one is an interval/circuit type with a core/ab section at the end for a total of 86 minutes which might sound long, but the time flies by. The DVD also includes shorter permixes. (I love DVDs with premixes). One of the exercisers shows alternatives for beginners/intermediates - a good thing - because some of the cardio is pretty challenging. You really feel great after this workout.",1225152000,,572,4.787878787878788
8187128,5,B000OY14MA,"This is the first Sharon Twombly dvd I have and I really like it a lot.  It's been fantastic and I've really enjoyed doing this.  It's fast paced and involves intervals such as step cardio, regular floor aerobics and muscle sculpting.  With all the different types of moves, you work every muscle in your body.  My favourite is the step portion.  It's easy to follow and fun to do.  The toning portion is different to other dvds I have.  You combine standing and floor routines that use dumbbells and your step.
Sharon is a good cuer and encouraging too.  I do this several times a week and don't get bored with it.  I think it's geared for intermediate to advanced exercisers even though the aerobic portion uses basic choreography.  I recommend this one for sure and will look out for other dvds of hers.",1201996800,15,806,4.534722222222222
