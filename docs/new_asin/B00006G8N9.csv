7968465,2,B00006G8N9,"This film has some great detail about Voltaire's life, but it's very slow and a bit confusing in terms of linear ""plot line.""  I bought it to show my students and the reaction was somewhat mediocre.  Voltaire was such a dynamic individual; he deserves a more lively biography than this.",1369785600,,286,4.7
7968466,4,B00006G8N9,"This is a half-hour DVD made primarily for classroom use. It fulfills its purpose exceptionally well. It could be argued that Voltaire's exceptionally long and action-packed life requires a lengthier video, but the filmmakers have done their best considering the limitation. It gives the student a reasonably thorough synopsis of the author's life and achievements. There is also a second, brief segment listing and discussing the major works published by Voltaire. It should be noted that the book titles are given in French, which may be a minor problem in literature courses for students not advanced in French. But once forewarned, the instructor can easily take care of that issue in class.",1354060800,2,695,5.214285714285714
7968467,1,B00006G8N9,"The background music in this video is annoyingly loud. If Voltaire were alive today, he would make fun of this kind of incompetence. To vastly improve the video, its producers should either get rid of the background music or turn it down.",1113264000,,238,4.690476190476191
7968468,3,B00006G8N9,The video was worth watching but for the price it could have been more video and less still shots.  The same pictures were shown many times with a narrative.  I thought that less time could be spent on descriptions of Voltaire's acquaintances and more time spent on Voltaire himself.  I would have liked to see more scenes of Fernie and his previous homes and less time on the still shots of him that are readily available on an internet search.  There was not a very thorough deception of any of his writings.  I'm glad I bought it only because it is the only video I found about him.,1068940800,,585,4.37962962962963
