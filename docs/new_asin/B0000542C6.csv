1392907,5,B0000542C6,"I remember seeing this movie when it came out with a friend, who had to say that ""the natives all had perfect teeth.""  If you're looking for a documentary, then this film is going to disappoint you.  However, if you're looking for a beautiful, haunting film, one that will stay with you for a very long time, then this is a film for you.  There are a number of themes at work here, everything from the destruction of the rain forest to the white man's influence on ""primitive"" tribes to a man's search for his son to a couple of swipes at Werner Herzog.  The visuals are dazzling, your television never looked so good or so green.  Rather than the botched widescreen version of Excaliber, the widescreen version of this film does true justice to the movie.  The widescreen does allow you to see more and does take your breath away.  While not all of it works (the end at the dam scene just doesn't fit the rest of the picture), enough of it does to leave the viewer wanting much more.  The acting is very good but it's the vistas that the viewer will remember.  Ok, now, Fox, time for the same treatment to Zardoz!  Five stars out of five.",986601600,12,1139,4.355450236966824

1392921,5,B0000542C6,"This 1985 movie is hugely important 20 years later in terms of its commentary on ""Modernity"" and modernity's increasing damage to our environment, scientifically called, ""The Biosphere"".  Those primitives who live ""Respecting Mother Earth"" as opposed to ""Ripping the skin off of the World, know what ""The modern world has forgotten"", that the Industrial Age and Technological Age have produced both great good and increasing damage to our world.  Even through this movie won no ""Oscars"" it is far more important than most Oscar-winning movies, except perhaps for Dances With Wolves.  Tommy's father, realizing the damage to the natural world that the dam he himself built, blows it up so that his son, who lives in the Amazon Rainforest, can have a future with his wife and his descendants.  It is very clear, two decades after this film came out that we must switch to renewable energy sources.  The burning of fossil fuels is re-releasing the huge amounts of Carbon Dioxide first released from ancient volcanos 400 million years ago. That Carbon Dioxide raised the Earth's surface temperature to 130-140 degrees Fahrenheit, ushering in the age of the giant reptiles.  Burning fossil fuels is re-releasing that Carbon Dioxide and we are going to again experience surface temperatures of 130-140 degrees Fahrenheit, obliterating modern civilization.  Nature will not tolerate our abuse of it and will respond in very impersonal ways, which we are already experiencing as giant forest fires, increased desertification, rising seas, etc.  This is a ""Must See"" movie for everybody.",1462924800,2,1578,5.258964143426295

1392946,5,B0000542C6,"I have had this movie on VHS forever, and bought the DVD, as I watch and re-watch it.  The Emerald Forest is excellently cast, with Powers Boothe as the father who never gives up looking for his son, lost in the forest of the Amazon.  He is an engineer, working to create a dam for the river.  His son is taken by a tribe whose land is eaten away by civilization, which brings them closer with a fierce tribe intent on killing and stealing humans for slavery and consumption.  These three forces of human nature show contrasts and effects of different civilizations, and the interaction of the protagonist and antagonist.  Beautifully directed by one of my favorites, John Boorman (see Hope and Glory and The Tailor of Panama) who also stars his son Charlie, who shows his early potential then as an actor. Highly recommended.by me.",1445212800,,832,4.671232876712328

I was trying to update from my very old VHS, but the DVD does not have English sub-titles. Since the original languages in the movie are English, Portuguese, and various Amazonic tribal languages (most of the movie), it was very hard to follow, even knowing the whole story! I didn't get to the end. The photography too is extraordinary, but how do you watch nearly two hours of lovely photos without getting frustrated about not understanding the story?

The only thing I didn't like on this specific DVD is that since it is mostly not in English, there was no option for English subtitles so I had to watch it with French subtitles.

We both agree it is so unrealistic in  many ways, we can't see why it is recommended by her college teacher.  The whole tribal group is made up of young people except for a couple old men.  The idea that this tribe can have hidden for 15-20 years in the close vicinity of all the construction of the dam is a bit far fetched.
I realize the aim of the story is to make us aware of the damage to the rain forest and to the native peoples,  but I wish the writers could have done a better  job.",1374019200,,580,4.008695652173913

1393032,3,B0000542C6,"I remember Powers Boothe as Tommy's father, he did all right in his role with this well filmed, if somewhat ""pro primitives/ pro environment movie, Charley Boorman was perhaps even better as his lost son turned ""Indian"".
The ""look""of the film is almost National Geographic film in quality following the adventures of Charley and his adopted family.. It mostly looks good except in the use of nudity among the tribe. You see a lot of bare breasts but also a lot of strategically placed vines covering genitals ( one example being when some of the tribal women are rescued from a life of forced prostitution- they rip off their dresses and grab the nearest vines to cover themselves.)
There's a bit of ""natives know best"" environmentalism all the way, like James Cameron has been accused of with Avatar, not too bad except the way in which the evil dam project is destroyed in the end. Bill Markham, Boothe, blasts his own dam but most of the destruction is caused by a flood generated by his son's tribe (he never gets him back, even after finding him) in a silly magic rain dance ritual led by his son Charley.

The film is beautiful to look at, and worth the effort in spite of the ""preachiness"".

One last note, I'd always wondered about the ""Indians"" so I looked up this movie through Amazon's imdb link- learned almost nothing except that most of them made only this one movie. I have no idea if they even were Indians!",1357257600,3,1423,4.576470588235294

The movie is a treat for the eyes with its gorgeous cloud forest canopies, awesome waterfalls and jungle-embraced streams that make you want to just grab a canoe and go there. The native groups are interesting, their individuals endearing or frightening. The Fierce People are appropriately fierce and the buyers of the women despicable. Tomee's native father has some great lines that show what a wise person he is. His real father has some difficult decisions to make. He does what he can with an unusual situation. I really like the ending. Another one to watch again and again.

Someone complained about a lack of subtitles. My version has subtitles for the native language. I could use subtitles for the English, since I have trouble understanding the spoken word even with the volume turned up.",1352937600,3,902,4.819354838709677

James Cameron no doubt watched this before the thought up Avatar (ex: Kachiri vs Neytiri, Tommy was Jake's twin)  I saw this movie when it first came out in 1985 and loved it then but have had trouble finding it until recently.  I guess its message is important enough that it's finally re-emerged.  Especially, now, as a mother, it's even more meaningful.  I agree with the other reviewer, though.  I wish there was some educational material included.  Is the rainforest really being lost at 500 acres/day?  That was 25 years ago!  How much can be left?  What is being done to stop this?

In the DVD version, which I purchased from one of Amazon's sellers, there were NO English subtitles. I don't where this DVD came from, but it was certainly a waste of money.",1336435200,,531,4.428571428571429
1393051,1,B0000542C6,"This movie is supposedly based on a true story and is presented by various eco-environmental groups as a moving and compelling argument to save the rain forests. Because of its high reviews on Amazon.com, I decided it demanded a re-watch, having seen it many years ago. The story is quite simple. A young engineer in charge of building a dam in the Amazon basin is out with his family near the construction site, when the young (about 7 year old) son is taken captive by a tribe which was isolated from civilization. This boy grows up in that tribe and becomes a leader. Ten years later, the father eventually finds his son, but is caught in the cross-fire of inter-tribal warfare. The raiding tribe has made contact with civilization and has procured machine guns, and thus have hauled off the young ladies of the tribe to be prostitutes. Meanwhile, son  weds a young tribal lady, only to find her as a captive of the warring tribe. Using his now alienated father for assistance, the girls are rescued and son decides to stay primitive rather than go back to his roots. Upset with the dam that father has built, son calls on the frogs to make it rain, and a heavy rain coupled with new sympathies of father, father dynamites the dam and the progress of man is halted.

While this movie is reportedly based on a true story, it is quite clear that much of the events are fictitious. Hollywood needed to make a statement, and didn't seem to be concerned about truth. Thus, when they made statements at the end lamenting the loss of the primitive savage and rain forest, they give numbers that any credible thinker would question. The filmography of the movie was okay, but not great. It is clear that the film crew had three or four locations at most. But, what about the movie? Why would it get such a low rating from me? This movie would be best thought of as a merger of Al Gore in Inconvenient Truth and Brooke Shields in The Blue Lagoon, with a story line written by Margaret Mead. The script writer had tried to develop the innocent savage theme of Margaret Mead, perhaps not realizing that most of what Margaret Mead wrote about her adventures to the South Pacific were a total fiction, and should have been condemned to the genre of the Harlequin Romances rather than credible science. Unfortunately, Mead was devoured by the non-critical ideologues of academia and was sold as an argument against civilization and for the peace-loving, amoral primitive man, not driven by money, greed or passions. This movie makes light of the alternate belief structure of the primitive Amazonian. They are able to call on the frogs to make rain, without explanation as to how they might have the power to do this. This leads to a beautiful non-sequitor, in which we should not destroy rain forest because if we were sensitive to ""Mother Earth"", we could pray to frogs who would help us destroy the advance of modern technology. The movie leaves out that these primitives live in constant fear of the spirit world, which is an ugly taskmaster, and not the benevolent loving God of the Judeo-Christian faith. A favorite scene of the movie was the swimming hole, where the naked young Amazonian men would meet the equally naked young Amazonian women. It was a mixture of the opening scenes from Margaret Mead's ""Coming of Age in Samoa"" and various scenes from the Blue Lagoon-entirely fictitious and entirely wishful for free-love without bounds or constraints or defined morality. If only the scriptwriters could actually live in one of these communities for a while to see that the female always takes a seriously subservient mode to the man. But, academic fictions contribute to even more fictions, and the most gullible among us, the Academics, sell this trash to us without any thought as to its truth content.

The movie poorly asks the question as to which culture or civilization is best. Is it the primitive native of the rainforest, or is it the so-called civilized man? The referential framework for making this judgement in the movie is the question of who treats the earth the best, and clearly, the primitive native wins out. But, that is not really a fair question, since it is not the primitive native making this assertion, but rather, it is the civilized man using the technology and knowledge that is despised to fight technology and ""knowledge"". It suggests that there is a primitive knowledge that is lost (note the very last statement of the movie!), but the movie makes clear that what is lost is a ""knowledge"" of the spirit world, a world that most modern man choses to believe does not exist, but those that are of a Christian heritage would ascribe to the demonic world whose torments are best to be delivered from.

Regarding the concern that anthropologists have to preserve primitive cultures, that is a total hypocrisy, since they wish to have access to these cultures, but nobody else. After all, if a primitive culture exists that you don't know exists, it doesn't matter whether or not they exist. Yet, the obsession with preserving primitive culture as a reference point for where modern culture has gone wrong fails. Margaret Mead used several isolated cultures in Samoa and New Guineas to build an argument for feminism and sexual liberation, an argument that is specious at best by denying what we see in man every day as a depraved person. We build utopian or mythical worlds to escape what we see is evil in our own culture, yet fail to grasp that we are chasing nothing but a fantastical creation of our mind devoid of reality.

In conclusion, the movie is inconsistent and ambiguous enough to make any decisions regarding either cultural judgments or environmental concerns. The movie offers no greater reference point for making any further judgements, either regarding morality or culture. Thus, one must turn elsewhere for these decisions. It is no wonder that The Emerald Forest has not had a lasting impact, and no wonder that the environmental movement and anthropology comes across as a touch insincere.",1335052800,4,6041,4.782567049808429

1393058,4,B0000542C6,"In his long career as director that spans more than 40 years, John Boorman has made films that are not many in number, but cover a wide variety of topics. Just watch the list of his films and you know what I mean - ""Point Blank"" ""Deliverance"" ""Excalibur"" ""The General"" and ... well ...""Exorcist II: The Heretic."" And don't forget the 1974 sci-fi cult film ""Zardoz"" starring Sean Connery and Charlotte Rampling. ""The Emerald Forest"" is probably one of his better works, if not his best. The film's message about the vanishing rainforest is still resonant, though it is undermined by the uneven narrative.

The storyline itself is simple. Tommy, a young son of an American dam engineer Bill Markham (Powers Booth), is abducted by a rainforest tribe in Brazil. While Bill tries to find the clues as to the whereabouts of the tribe (known as the ""Invisible People""), ten years pass by, turning the missing son into a warrior - now Tomme (played by Charlie Boorman) - fighting to protect his love and land.

Visuals of the rain forests are gorgeous, capturing the charms and dangers of the place. Also, the film's actions (including gun fights) are not bad. Strong acting from Charlie Boorman (director's son) is also memorable, but characters' conflicting emotions are not fully explored, often overshadowed by the struggles and battles between two opposing forces. (Strangely, the boy's mother played by Meg Foster has little to do in the story.) The director seems more interested in the adventures of the two males than in the father-and-son relationship, where the film originally started.

The end result is not bad, though. This is a very entertaining film with an important message, although the message itself is a bit too obvious for viewers.",1294790400,6,1747,4.9353741496598635

It's a mystery with a surprising hold, all the way through and brings up questions of what is truly civilized, what is true development, and what is devotion, real love and sacrifice.
Gorgeous cinematography, a hallmark of Boorman, is abundant here, and the performance of Boorman's real-life son as the grown lost child is amazing, as are those portraying the native peoples.  I highly recommend it.",1291766400,4,724,5.067226890756302

1393066,5,B0000542C6,"To reveal to our ""civilized"" world our human roots in nature is an ambitious goal for any film.  To do so using the story of hidden tribes in the Amazon, with cultures incomprehensible to ""modern"" humans, is remarkably ambitious.  This film brings a deep ecology sensibility that is desperately needed - but just as desperately avoided in our complacent, self-loathing, materialistic culture.

""The Emerald Forest"" is awkward at times.  I'm not sure of the order in which the scenes were shot, but the director manages to lead us in the right direction.  The acting appears to evolve(or is it our awareness that evolves?), as the viewer is lured into the contracting jungle culture of these tribes, and away from the dead world of constant construction, assimilation and expansion.  What is most amazing, in a way, is the gentleness with which Boorman treats contemporary culture.  This is the key to providing his ecological message the wings of flight that make our jaws drop in the midst of breattaking scenery and well-presented tribal culture and ritual.

Boorman lets the subject of his preaching be slowly revealed through the story and characters rather than bludgeoning us with immensely evil, calculating villains.  As it is in reality, the insanity lies in our collective indifference, our willingness to accept a pathetic world of materialism and technology in the hopes that our connection with each other, our bodies and nature will not be missed.  Incremental trade-offs leading to ""higher standards of living"" have left us dispossessed of our souls, seeking solace in hedonism and ""pie in the sky"" religions that cultivate the greed and abomination they purport so piously to eliminate.

Yet, in this process, key elements of the movie involve psychedelic drugs and nudity, albeit natural and normal in the cultures Boorman portrays.  Can we be lured back into the jungle with titillation?  Obviously, the life is harsh and dangers abound.  Yet, this film isn't about a bunch of teenagers getting high.  It is about an adult ritual of expanded consciousness and vision that is meant not to narrow consciousness as alcohol use does, but to expand it, to bring perspective and connection in the quest of vision and leadership.

Likewise, this film portrays nudity in the context of normal life and does not eroticize it.  It is refreshingly ironic that, when liberated from enforced prostitution in a heavily armed brothel, the women instinctively remove the scanty clothing and adornments that have been used to make them ""attractive.""  If clothing is a metaphor, what else does our culture uses to conceal our humanity?  If hallucinogens are a metaphor, what else does our culture use to deaden our sensibilities so that we seek sexual conquest and materialistic acquisition instead of trusting, healthy relationships with the people and world around us?

Boorman's ""The Emerald Forest"" is an odd, but remarkable achievement that has stood the test of time quite well thus far.  In 2009, this 1985 film seems even more wise than when it was created.",1255910400,6,3065,5.102204408817635

Soon thereafter their young son, Tommy, (Charley Boorman) disappears into the jungle. Tommy, now Tomme, was abducted by a peaceful Amazonian tribe known as the ""Invisible People"". Meanwhile, ten years pass as Tomme learns the ways of the indigenous people while his father continues to search for him. Finally, Bill Markham finds his son. But he soon learns that Tomme is happy with his new tribal family and doesn't wish to return to the outside world. Later the ""Invisible People"" are forced into a disasterous situation by a rival tribe and Tomme goes off to find his father so that he may help them recover their kidnapped women. The movie ends with Bill Markham destroying the dam so that Tomme and his people can continue to live their traditional lifestyle in the rainforest.

I certainly have sympathy with this movie's central theme - which is the importance of preserving the Amazon rainforest and its indigenous people. In addition, the cinematography of this beautiful natural environment is impressive and the film even does a fairly decent job at depicting a somewhat, though not entirely, authentic portrait of the customs and rituals of an Amazonian tribe.

I liked the earlier part of the movie. But the latter portion increasingly slips into an unrealistic sort of action-adventure flick. For example, the ""Invisible People"" are supposedly so isolated that they have never had contact with the outside world. But yet Tommee manages to travel by foot to the large city where the Markham family is living and then somehow tracks down his father. It is all highly implausible and, at times, quite ridiculous.

When he comes upon his son by chance ten years later, he's not even sure at first it's him, he's so native except for the blue eyes and blond hair.

No point in re-reviewing the film here, others have already done an excellent job.  My review is of the DVD itself.

One of my pet peeves is DVD covers that claim Dolby Digital sound when in fact the best you get is Dolby Pro Logic.  This is one of those instances.  Do not be fooled by the Dolby Digital claim.  This DVD is NOT encoded as such.

Video quality is so-so at best.

What happened to the subtitles?  There is some dialogue where subtitles are missing.  There are misspelled words (another silly pet peeve of mine).

Bill spends the next ten years combing the jungles trying to find Tomme and bring him home.

When they are finally reunited Tomme is now a young man and the adopted son of the tribal chief and shaman (Ruy Polanah). He has also chosen a wife and is about to be married. And so the struggle begins, not only between father and son, but between two very foreign cultures in search of mutual understanding and acceptance.

While the two fathers and son work through the implications of their chance meeting danger looms on the horizon. A neighboring tribe of cannibals known as ""The Fierce People"" will soon attack. The ensuing confrontation will force Bill to join in the battle in an effort to defeat a mutual enemy.

Everything about this film is first rate. Acting (Powers Boothe, Charley Boorman and Ruy Polanah), directing (John Boorman), cinematography, and screenplay.

For openings, the concept is terrific.  It may be the worst nightmare for a parent but we, the audience, are spared that knowing that it won't be much of a movie if the son doesn't reappear.  It is from the perspective of the son that the story holds its' magic.  Suppose you were captured by obscure Amazonian tribesmen around the age of 5 and swept of into the depth of the vast jungle world they live in.  I know...lousy food, no indoor plumbing, no TV, etc. etc. etc..  But let's forget about that (and missing mommy and daddy) and consider the adventure of a lifetime.

The story, of course, involves the reuniting of parents and child.  It is something like 7-10 years later and our little boy is now a teenager in his Amazonian society.  The family members reunite, solve a crisis of modern man, and the boy, now a man in his new society, faces the choice of which world to live in.

The cinematography is outstanding and the infinite possibilities are well-utilized.  Some parts of the story slow the movie down a bit but the impact remains profound.  This is a movie to watch with just about the whole family.  Some of the corruption of the modern world may cross over a line or two but it does fit into the message of the movie.

I first saw this movie when I was a little boy, and it's one of those movie-experiences that stays with you, and this one-of-a-kind-movie is a movie that never quite leaves you. Mostly I think because the story is so gripping, and tragic. The boy who is ""kidnapped"" by some lost tribe -and raised in the deep of the Amazon. The father who never gives up the hope to find him, and it takes him ten years to find his son -only to discover that he has lost him ""mentally"", and that it is too late. The acting is so brilliant and belieavable. It is also a lecture in what the industrial world is doing with the nature. I find it frightening every time I see the movie when the ""chief"" of the tribe tells his ""son"" that every year the ""edge of the world"" is getting closer. And that they've cut down the trees of the fathers. A grotesque image! ""The edge of the world"" that means the termination of the forests, the longues of the world! Well, this movie still leaves me thinking every time! A movie about belief, courage -but also loss. And above all; Love!

I highly recommend this!",1111708800,11,1203,4.346666666666667
1393091,4,B0000542C6,"The DVD version of this film is bowdlerized.  It is an annoying downer, when the widescreen and the picture quality of DVD make the DVD version preferrable in every other way.

The other reviews have adequately covered the film.  Yes, it is uneven, and the ending strains credibility.  Personally, I didn't care for the drug-use aspect either, but for the combination of adventure and spectacle and human relations, this movie is hard to beat.",1109894400,5,443,4.945945945945946
1393092,5,B0000542C6,"It was heartening to read so many glowing reviews of EF, and see how many people consider it a ""favorite"" film. It has been a favorite of mine for many years. It is one of the very best films I know of in the ""action/adventure"" genre, yet transcends that genre with political smarts and vivid subplots. This kind of story used to be featured in magazines like ARGOSY when I was a kid, but on a much pulpier level. One plotline all the other reviewers seem to have missed is the discovery of the prostition ring by the Powers Boothe character late in the film. There is one  brief scene in this film which remains my favorite ten or so seconds of film of all time. It sends shivers up my spine every  time I see it: the viewer is suddenly transported high up in the air,  flying right alongside some eagle-like bird, on some relentless dreamlike mission conjured up by the rainforest tribe and their rituals. Worth waiting for, even if the movie leaves you cold /  A GREAT film, from one of the greatest living directors.",1106611200,9,1020,4.409574468085107
1393093,5,B0000542C6,"Anyone who says they like this movie for the social comments or cultural conflicts will tell you that they buy Playboy for the articles.

This movie takes place in the Amazon jungles.  It involves a tribe of mostly naked ""Indian"" women.  These are not giant Amazon beauties.  These are petite, but very cute women.  It is unrealistic.  Native women running nude in the jungle, wearing only paint, do not look that good...so, invitingly smooth and tight.  These are not indiginous or native women.  These are actresses who have appeared in other movies.

Other than that, this is a pretty good movie.  The jungle scenes are gorgeous.  These scenes, along with nubian little bodies really transport you to another world...a world of wet dreams.

There is also a very good action story here, with the hero searching for his lost son.  There are cannibals and destruction of the rain forest.

But, don't believe that garbage about this being a study of different cultures, of civilization meeting native Americans.  It is just a very good action story, with some sex thrown in, using the destruction of the rain forest as a backdrop.  It is very mesmerizing and involving.  But, it is not very realistic.

The only real problem I have with the movie is that there are some contrived plot twists that you could see were coming.  For instance, one character is conveniently killed off as an easy way out of one of the complicated plot lines.  It's been done to death on Bananza and other TV series.  I think it would have been better to allow this character to live and see how the hero would deal with the situation.",1097798400,4,1611,4.702508960573477

1393095,4,B0000542C6,"Powers Boothe plays a construction engineer building a dam in the rainforest where his son is kidnapped by the indigenous people.  The movie goes a long way in telling just what a parent would do - not only to find the missing child but also the later sacrifices that will be made.

Gatekeeper reviews are only concerned with adult theses, nudity and violence.  There are may great reviews on this movie.  Please refer to them for additional information to see if it's worth purchasing.  This movie contains adult, teen and preteen nudity (all topless and all of the indigenous population).  There is also violence and adult subject matter.  However, when all is considered and the theme of what we are doing to our planet would make this movie viewable by the whole family (with parental supervision).",1090886400,5,802,4.852941176470588
1393096,5,B0000542C6,"I have to give this film five stars for all the reasons that the other fans of this movie discuss.  This commentary is on an unusual glitch that I discovered with the DVD.  I'm referring to the MGM ""Contemporary Classics"" edition (in case there's another version out there).
I was surprised to discover that, when the native people were speaking, some of the subtitling was left off.  Moments of indigenous dialogue were left un-subtitled in the VHS version (moments when a character appeared to be saying something like  ""Move"" or ""Hey, look."").  However, with the DVD, there was one scene where a bit of dialogue that was significant to the development of the plot went unsubtited, and we were all left in the dark.  It happened in only one significant scene, that I noticed, and eventually it was apparent what the character had said, but it was still frustrating and strange.
However, I still recommend that you get the DVD.  When comparing scenes between the DVD and my old VHS copy (in order to see what had been said during the previously mentioned scene), I discovered that the old pan and scan version occasionally cut out almost 50% of the screen!  With a film this beautiful, this is intolerable!
If you have this on VHS and are considering upgrading to DVD, I recommend that you do so - the visual pay-off is great!  But keep your hands on the old VHS copy, unless you know the dialogue from memory.",1056153600,49,1411,4.634538152610442
1393097,4,B0000542C6,"Haven't seen this movie for at least 15 years, now it is out on DVD. It is a great movie, about an engineer (Powers Boothe) who was building a dam in Amazon rain forest. His son was kidnapped by lost tribe of the amazon. He searched endlessly for his missing son for 10 years. It is based on true story. The acting is very good and the location is beautiful. Too bad the DVD can't displayed it properly as the color is a bit pale and dark. The sound is Dolby 2.0 only and a bit let down, especially after the DVD opens with the high power MGM logo presented in Dolby 5.1 and when it plays the film, you can immediately feel the drop in the sound quality.

1393099,3,B0000542C6,"The bad news first:A lack of complete emotional content,considering the theme of this film;although Charley Boorman as Tommy,and Powers Boothe as Bill Markham give fine performances,there is a key element missing. Emotion. When Bill loses his son Tommy,he is naturally upset. Ten years pass in which Bill searches in vain. When Bill and Tommy finally unite,under trying circumstances,it's almost as if Tommy as been lost for only a week,not ten years. This continues almost all through the film. Bill acts towards Tommy like he were a friend,not a son that's been missing a decade. The Good news:A lasting interest is what this film's strength is. As soon as Tommy goes missing,and the Amazon scenery appears,then so do the Tribes,different cultures,and some good Cinematography. The Emerald Forest is one those films that i think borders on greatness,but misses,by a narrow margin. Overall,an entertaining film,that seemingly would have benefited from more emotional depth,and more character development,the ending of this film however,is somewhat unexpected,and makes up for the flaws. Overall,honestly,i did enjoy The Emerald Forest,it was a fine idea for a film,but i can't help but think-it could have been so much better. 3.5/5. The picture quality on this disc is very good. Shown in original aspect ratio of 2.35:1,The Emerald Forest scenery looks very clear,sharp,clean,blemish free. Only on a few scenes (when the sky was in view,inparticular) did i notice a slight amount of grain and dirt on the print. 4/5. The sound quality on this disc is slightly above average. It is crisp,and very clear,picking up fine details,but the speech from the centre channel is a little weak;i did have to raise the volume a fair bit to actually hear the words clearly.
