2165664,5,B00064AFKU,My daughter loves angelina. This is the old angelina with the lovely graphics and annimation. Not the newer computerized one. The stories are simple and teach good moral and behavioral lessons,1386892800,2,192,5.225806451612903

2165667,1,B00064AFKU,"We borrowed this DVD from the library and rushed to return it after one viewing.  The DVD bothered us so much that I had to peek on Amazon to see what others thought of it.  I was shocked to find everyone on here loving it with 5-star reviews!

My daughter (almost 3yrs) liked this DVD enough (except for the scary part, which I'll get back to), but I tend to form my opinions of DVDs based on how well the whole family, or at least one parent, can sit through it with the kid.  My gripes are as follows:

1) Horrible character voices - breathy, high pitched, whiny, baby sounds like nails on a chalkboard for me.

2) Strange story lines - girl steals mother's locket, and in the end the mother is just fine with it.  Mother gives young girl her baby sister to take to school for show and tell.  Girl loses baby sister.  Yikes!  I know I shouldn't take it so seriously, but I sort of do.

3) A statue head/face slowly cracks and falls off, which terrified my daughter.  For the second time in her life, she clapped her hands over her eyes desperately (the first time was for a giraffe skull at the zoo).

This is my first time reviewing a kids' DVD.  I suppose I felt I had to offer another perspective to balance out all the 5-star reviews.  I will never get another Angelina Ballerina DVD!",1339977600,4,1291,4.255144032921811
2165668,5,B00064AFKU,"I bought this for my daughter b/c she loves the title story and she got frustrated when it was not available on demand. It is a sweet story about sisters, responsibility and friendship. There are 3 other stories (Show and Tell - where angelina brings her baby sister to show and tell, 'The Proposal' where Angelina is afraid Miss Lily will leave and 'Queen Seraphina' where the statue of the Queen is damaged) and a 'little stars' segment which shows live action kids doing ballet. I believe this segment is Sleeping Beauty which is another bonus as she loves that story.  Each segment is 15-20 min so its great to keep them occupied for short periods of time or car drives when you don't want to commit to a 2 hr feature.",1259971200,3,722,4.46969696969697
2165669,5,B00064AFKU,I love the Angelina Ballerina video series.  They inspire young dancers while teaching them the life skills necessary for the art.,1247529600,,130,5.190476190476191
2165670,5,B00064AFKU,"My 4-year-old is just beginning to get interested in ballet and dance and the Angelina Ballerina stories and DVDs provide loads of inspiration whilst serving to entertain at the same time.

There are 4 episodes altogether [12 mins each] - In ""The Silver Locket"", Angelina is upset to find she has lost the silver locket she took without her mom's permission. In ""Show and Tell"", Angelina loses her baby sister Polly after she decides Polly would make the perfect show and tell item. In ""The Proposal"", Angelina is not too happy with her dance instructor, Ms Lilly's new beau, and in the last episode, Angelina and her friends hope they can make a new head for Queen Seraphina's statue before it's unveiled.

The animated stories remain faithful to the source material by Katharine Holabird, and retain the original illustrations by Helen Craig. The quality of the animation is above average, lending an almost real-life quality to the little mice, and the language is clear [British accent is used here]. In between the animated episodes, there are scenes of actual dance lessons, either ballet, folk or others.

I'd highly recommend the Angelina Ballerina series of DVDs to aspiring young dancers, those who love immersing themselves in a world inhabited by adorable little mice and this is probably suited to preschoolers and up.",1240790400,,1331,5.013574660633484
