8732702,4,B01554YHD6,"While the first two movies re-cap the series, shedding little things of new or easily missed information, It's Rebellion that makes the package worth it as an extension of the series itself. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because of a few issues with the sound/picture. The sound can get a little distorted (echo effect or too quiet) in some scenes as well as the picture (color washed out or looks too dark/bright), and then there are some slight  timing issues with the subtitles.",1456876800,,495,4.689655172413793
