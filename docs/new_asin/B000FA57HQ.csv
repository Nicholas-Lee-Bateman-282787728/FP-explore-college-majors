the ice while watching this tribute

to the 2005-06 Stanley Cup Carolina

Hurricanes. Rod Brind/Amour waited

a long time for this and so did

his mate Wesley! What a rookie

season for the Hurricanes goalie

from Sherwin Park, Edmonton, Alberta,

also! Great Coaching job by US Olym-

pic Coach Pat Laviolette! Go for the

repeat in '07, guys!",1151452800,2,376,4.6461538461538465
2557451,5,B000FA57HQ,"We love this DVD and our kids love to watch it as well. I would have loved to see the real entire last game on it, but it is good as is. GO CANES!!!",1332374400,,148,3.3823529411764706
2557452,4,B000FA57HQ,"All of the Stanley Cup series of DVD's are very nicely put together and have some great behind-the-scenes commentary.  I'm a Hartford Whalers fan from way back and they did have a bit of Whalers nation in there with a nice retirement ceremony for one of the Whaler greats...even though they put him in a Carolina jersey.  :)

Nice DVD and ya can't beat the price!!",1325376000,,364,4.484848484848484
2557453,5,B000FA57HQ,I did not know they could fit this much media on a dvd. Great value for the price. Lots of fantastic extra material much better than I had imagined.,1314403200,,148,4.137931034482759
2557454,5,B000FA57HQ,This is a great DVD showing the best team in the NHL win the Stanley Cup. Ron Francis brought us credibility. Glen Wesley gave us stability. Eric Staal may be our biggest star. But Rod Brind'Amour is the Carolina Hurricanes!,1297641600,,224,4.625
2557455,4,B000FA57HQ,"interesting behind the scenes documentary of how the season progressed to the play-offs, with the final game covered in its entirety, I would appreciated more player profiles and game coverage than the talking heads, but it was all an interesting perspective on the season",1279843200,,272,5.204545454545454
2557456,5,B000FA57HQ,"the 2006 stanley cup champions dvd is something that every caniac should have.  most likely if you are a hurricanes fan, you know the canes won the stanley cup in the 2005-2006 season.  as you might know, this is the first season of the nhl after the 2004-2005 lockout season.  watch as your favorite players of that years roster give insight on the season that claimed tabacco road a place on lord stanley's cup.  So if your a die hard canes fan or just wanting to know about a year of this franchise's success, then pick this up and enjoy every second of it.",1262217600,,560,4.355769230769231
2557457,5,B000FA57HQ,This video was well done and is a great gift for a Carolina Hurricanes fan.  My boyfriend loved it and has watched it several times now.,1219708800,,136,4.230769230769231
2557458,5,B000FA57HQ,"I picked up this DVD last night at the RBC Center in Raleigh, NC.  I was attending my very first NHL game, and I wasn't disappointed as the 'Canes beat the Panthers 4-2.  I had previously rented this disc, and it is a must-have for any Carolina fan, but any hockey fan should enjoy it as well.  All of the special features are great, and the included entire game 7 broadcast of the Stanley Cup finals is a real treat.",1194134400,,417,4.1875
2557459,5,B000FA57HQ,NHL did us proud with this DVD.  They gave us the entire game 7 of the SC Finals.  Thank you!!,1178928000,,94,3.65
2557460,5,B000FA57HQ,"Got this for my grandson, who is a rabid Hockey fan. He has watched it over and over again. He was thrilled! I was so glad to be able to get it for him so easily. It wasn't available locally and Amazon saved me from disappointing him.",1169164800,,234,4.0
2557491,5,B000FA57HQ,"Very well done, with complete game 7 coverage and highlights from the earlier rounds.

a must have for hurricanes fans.",1162771200,,119,4.95
2557492,5,B000FA57HQ,"As an Inaugural Partner of the Hurricanes' hockey club (one who has been there from the beginning, before they moved to Raleigh), I have waited for this video to be made a long time, for them to win the Stanley Cup.  The Hurricanes put together an unlikely but magical season, and one of the most exciting post-seasons I can remember.  This video does a good job of getting that point across, and I think that even someone who isn't a huge hockey fan would enjoy the story of the 2005-06 Carolina Hurricanes' march to the Stanley Cup.  I have seen and purchased some other years' Champions videos and this one is right up there with the best.",1162512000,,642,4.47008547008547
2557493,4,B000FA57HQ,"As a Caniac who was ""in the house"" when the boys hoisted the Cup, I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  Nice summary of the season, a brief 5 minutes or so on each of the first 3 series,  and then several minutes on each of the games during the Finals, plus lots of the celebrations at the end.  The ""vignettes"" are really a joke - each about 30 seconds long, but the disc more than compensates by having the entire game 7 broadcast.  Note that it is *just* the game and the celebrations, none of the between period commentary.  I wished it had some of the discussion/analysis of the disallowed goal at the end of the first period.  Also wish it had ""The Rising"" as the theme song! Probably some copyright issues there.  Good quality picture and sound.",1154044800,,746,4.401459854014599
2557494,5,B000FA57HQ,"I have bought one other edition of a national championship-type DVD (the other one being a final four DVD) and the NHL Stanley Cup Champions DVD beats the NCAA Division-1 basketball championship DVD by a long shot.  The Stanley Cup DVD contains the entire broadcast of game 7 (no commercials, but also no intermission highlights) of the Stanley Cup Final on NBC and most of the broadcast of the celebration at the end (although I was dissapointed that I didn't see Cam Ward hoist the cup, like that's a big deal).  It also includes highlights from the season and each round of the playoffs for the Hurricanes; all of the NHL's My Stanley Cup commercials; random goals and highlights of the playoffs crammed into one small segment; short specials on Hurricanes' players Cam Ward, Eric Staal, Mike Commodore, and Ray Whitney; and some dressing room speeches.  With this DVD you'll be able to relive every moment of game seven, along with the best of the season and the playoffs, over and over again.  I went to Game 7 and although this DVD doesn't beat being at an NHL game, it beats every other sports DVD that I've seen.",1152921600,5,1120,4.641414141414141
2557495,5,B000FA57HQ,"The DVD has now been released. I watched it last night and am pretty amazed by how good the production quality is for this product. I'm even more amazed about the turnaround time -- the Canes only won the Cup 23 days ago!

The recaps of each part of the season are pretty comprehensive, as are the recaps of each of the series that put the Canes in the Finals. There are good side stories in between those recaps, such as a look into Kevyn Adams's life at home. All the while, clips from interviews with Kaiton, Forslund, Weight, Lavi, etc are interspersed.

I haven't watched the whole Game 7 yet, but it is presented as the NBC widescreen broadcast with all the action, without commercials.

The production quality seems very nice. The picture is very sharp even on my SDTV.",1152662400,7,776,4.48936170212766
2557496,3,B000FA57HQ,"As I write this (as 11:52AM eastern time on July 10th, 2006) this DVD has yet to be released.  I am giving the disc a three star rating solely because I can't submit these comments without some sort of rating.

Although I am interested in buying this disc, I can only laugh at the three reviews this disc has already received--two people giving it five stars, the third giving it four)  People--the DVD isn't even out yet, and the ""features"" provided by Amazon is still the same generic description written long before the Cup was awarded.  I'm sure Amazon is trying to avoid the fiasco with the recent Super Bowl XL DVD which was originally touted by Amazon to contain a ""cut-down"" broadcast of the entire Super Bowl game and instead wound up devoting more disc space to the Steelers-Colts playoff game and the Super Bowl halftime show than to the actual Steelers-Seahawks game.

If you want to give the Hurricanes five stars for winning the cup, fine, but jeez--Don't give out five star reccommendations to DVD's that don't yet exist!",1152489600,2,1036,4.701657458563536
2557497,5,B000FA57HQ,"The 2005-2006 NHL season marked the beginning of the post-lockout/salary cap era of the league, and it also marked a banner year for the Carolina Hurricanes beginning with a surprisingly superb regular season which was only capped by the franchise winning their first Stanley Cup championship.  After having not made the playoffs for the past few seasons prior to the lockout, the 'Canes were one of the teams (much like their Finals opponents, the rejuvinated Edmonton Oilers) that were the posterchildren of the ""new"" NHL: a fast paced, offensive-minded club with an equal mix of youth and veteran leadership that used the new salary cap to their advantage to become a championship team.  Led by veteran captain Rod Brind'Amour, veterans Glen Wesley, Cory Stillman, Ray Whitney, Kevyn Adams, Aaron Ward, and Doug Weight and Mark Recchi (both of whom were acquired around the trade deadline) meshed well with rising stars Eric Staal, Frantisek Kaberle, Mike Commodore, and Erik Cole as they all helped put the puck in the net while Martin Gerber helped keep the puck out of their own during the regular season, only to be usurped by rookie Cam Ward in the playoffs; a move which made coach Peter Laviolette look like a genius as Ward led the 'Canes to the Cup and won the Conn Smythe as playoff MVP.  This DVD recaps the 'Canes' monster year, and seeing Brind'Amour accept the Cup is one of the most welcome moments in NHL history; right up there with Joe Sakic passing the Cup to Ray Bourque and Mark Messier raising it in MSG.  All in all, for 'Canes fans and NHL fans in general, this DVD is a welcome addition to your library, and here's looking forward to more great hockey in the years to come.",1152230400,2,1701,4.717171717171717
2557498,5,B000FA57HQ,"Yes we finally did it I'm glad that we won the cup in the new NHL, theses new rules and open ice really helped out the hurricanes with a NHL and Franchise recored braking season all year long two 9 game winning streaks and two five game winning streaks 4 shut outs. I can go on and on. But I rather you watch it first my most exciting playoff series this year was againt's New Jersey, Buffalo to game 7 and also the Edmonton Oilers in game 7 of the stanley cup finals.

Cam Ward our rookie goalie who won us the cup gotten the cons smyth e throuphy,and Rod Brind A'Mour took home the best diffensive foward trouphy award. I went to one game this year live in person in Raliegh, NC i'm glad I'm going next year but maybe on the road since my cusions just moved to Alberta Calgary. and if carolina plays them I'm gonna stay with them and go to the game to chear for my canes!!!!
