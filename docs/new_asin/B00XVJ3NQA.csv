7200431,5,B00XVJ3NQA,"Although perhaps not for everyone, this surprisingly sweet romantic comedy tells the story of Mitsuki, a 15-year old girl whose mother has just recently remarried into the Kanzaki family. It is also the story of her brand new older brother, Yuuya, with both having gained a sibling overnight. Complicating matters, Yuuya's dad is an engineer, and his job in India just moved up 6 months, and he's leaving tomorrow for the overseas project, with his new wife to follow. Leaving the brand-new siblings living alone, with occasional checks from Mitsuki's aunt. Yuuya's mother died when he was young, so he doesn't have a clue what it's like to have a younger sister, though he's determined to right, even with a girl who's as quiet and cold as Mitsuki.

Complicating matters, on their way home from their first day at the same high school,  Mitsuki is suddenly possessed by the spirit of a dead girl, who calls herself Hiyori Kotobuki. Hiyori claims that she's in love with her ""onni-chan"" (big brother), Yuuya, and that the only way for her to pass on is in doing ""lovey-dovey"" things with Yuuya, ranging from romantic, to sexual...while possessing Mitsuki's body. Worse for Mitsuki, she wakes up wearing a TST, a risqu chastity belt with a heart-shaped gauge that fills up when lovey-dovey goals are reached, literally building steps on Hiyori's stairway to heaven. Success and Hiyori reaches heaven and Mitsuki is freed from the TST and possession. The alternative? Hiyori says that failure means BOTH Hiyori and Mitsuki go to hell.

Complicating matters is that Yuua never had a little sister, and never knew anyone named Hiyori. As matters progress, Mitsuki doesn't know whether she's reacting due to Hiyori's feelings, or her own. The cast is rounded out by the return of Yuuya's childhood friend, Yukina, a tomboy when they were kids, who's grown into a busty and ladylike mature young woman, who clearly has feelings for the dense Yuuya...oh, surely she can't see Hiyori? Yuuya's best friend, Shotaro Torii, who's jealous of Yuuya having a cute sister, as Shotaro's little sister, Moa, hates him. Aunt Nanami stops by from time to time, and eventually moves in, and then there's the mysterious Neko, a classmate of Yuuya who seems to know an awful lot about what's going on between Yuuya and Mitsuki. The result is a fun cast with a good bit of comic potential.

Where objections might rise is that the Japanese do love their toilet humor, and the first 2 episodes go there, with Mitsuki able to open the TST for 3 minutes every hour, and Yuuya managing to make matters worse as Mitsuki attempts to go to the toilet, through his compete misunderstanding of the situation. This was a turnoff for many who watched the streaming of the series (no pun intended). But after those two episodes, no more toilet humor.

There's a lot of fan service here: The TST is a essentially a G-string; the first thing Hiyori does when she possesses Mitsuki's body is to start masturbating, and when Mitsuki retakes control, Hiyori in ghost form then goes for girl-on-girl action on Mitsuki, etc. So if you're opposed to fan service, this show is not for you, nor is it for those who can never get their brain around (not making an insult, here, just stating a fact) an incest theme, even when the siblings aren't blood-related, and only just met.

For those who aren't turned away by the 2 episodes with some toilet humor and other themes that might be personally objectionable, what is here is show of surprising sweetness. Mitsuki's a complicated character. Her coldness towards men comes from her father being a horrible person to her and her mother, who then abandoned them, with her mother getting involved with other horrible men until she hit the jackpot with Yuuya's dad, a genuinely good and nice person. Mitsuki comes across as believable with the problems she's had in her life, not wanting a new brother or a new family, thinking that all that's needed is her and her mom. Her emotional retardation and gradual growth through the series is believable of a girl who had such a traumatic childhood.

Yuuya is a genuinely decent guy, who's dense about girls to start with, but utterly befuddled by his new sister's behavior, and those ""weird panties"" he's caught glimpses of. He's often the straight man, and a clueless one at that, but he's always trying to do the right thing, even when it's exactly the wrong thing Mitsuki needs at that moment. Comical misunderstandings will ensue. The rest of the cast is quit nice: Hiyori is a riot as the ditzy and horny ghost, Yukina is a believable romantic rival, of the sweet, big sister type, and the rest of the cast provides good comedy support.

Visually, this show is outstanding and beautiful. This release contains the 12 episode TV series, but does not contain the OVA that was bundled with a manga release in Japan (the OVA has no effect on the TV story, telling  a 2-part story of Shotaro looking out for his little sister, Mao, with Yuuya dragged along; and of their first Christmastime together, with it also being Mitsuki's 16th birthday). The comedy is good, there's plenty of fan service, there's some nice romance, character growth, and I did mention the comedy. The sweetness was a surprise to me, as the main cast of Mitsuki, Yuuya and Yukina are all genuinely nice characters (with Mitsuki having some believable difficulties), and Hiyori is just a ditzy riot as the ghost who knows what she wants and from who, but has no clue as to why. This was a remarkably good romantic comedy.",1438128000,49,5541,4.78765690376569

8716761,5,B00XVJ3NQA,"Basically, it is a story of love between brother and younger sister in law. But someone can not accept this anime because of some sexual content, - implied masturbation of high school girls, homosexual activity with teen girl and teen girl ghost and something like that. So there was a little social issues about these scene when this anime was broadcast in Japan from 22:00 that is the time children can watch in the past.
The original author of this anime is a female manga artist and she perhaps wrote this original comic for young teen age girls. So I wish many girls enjoy this anime.
