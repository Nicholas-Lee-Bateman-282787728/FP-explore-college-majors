2789561,5,B000O17120,"I thought this was a really well done movie. Colin Farrell does a really good job of displaying the man I always felt Alexander really was. You clearly see his love for Hephaistion and Bucephalus, as well as how I think he would have viewed the world. The action is not as overwhelmingly bloodthirsty but captures the kind of dirty, gritty, disgusting essence of that kind of warfare. Val Kilmer also does a fantastic job of portraying Phillip II, who is in my opinion one of the most underrated kings in history. I also love how the story was told through Ptolemy's eyes. Nice job from Anthony Hopkins too.",1472342400,2,607,4.577981651376147
2789562,5,B000O17120,"A really great interesting take on one of the worlds most influential and well known leaders.  Its violent, thought provoking, and artistic.

2789565,3,B000O17120,"This review's title may describe why Oliver Stone thought it necessary to recut his 2004 film, ""Alexander."" Despite the director's best efforts and intentions, it seems that no amount of tinkering will reclamate what remains a slow-paced historo-epic.

Horrendously spastic handheld cameras ruin battle scenes. The frequent dancing girl/orgy sequences are useful only if you need a restroom break or wish to buy a box of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Milk-Duds/dp/B0007WGV6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Milk Duds</a>.

Kilmer as one-eyed Philip of Macedon is unattractively porcine, Jolie's overinflated lips look ready to explode and bleach blonde Farrell is badly miscast as conqueror of the ancient world.

You want more? This disaster runs 3.5 hours!

(DIRECTOR CAMEO: Oliver Stone appears briefly as the Macedonian soldier at Zeus statue.)

8182664,3,B000O17120,"The Ultimate Cut of Alexander filled in some missing pieces left out of the original film. There are some really terrific scenes in this movie. The battle of Gaugamela, with the hypnotic music by Vangelis, was really something. Alexander was outnumbered by the huge Persian army, but his military skills are on full display here. That scene alone is worth watching the movie.

Unfortunately there are parts of the movie that slow the pacing down, and this cut doesn't fix it. In fact, with the battle scene just referenced moved to the start of the movie, it's a downhill slide from there. Alexander conquered about 90 percent of the known world by the age of 32, but this movie develops a soap opera feel and leaves his military adventures behind. And that was a mistake. More examples of his actual military accomplishments would have been more interesting than his weird relationship with his mother.

There are many reviewers who are clearly uncomfortable that Alexander was probably bisexual. It is a fact that his lifelong friend Hephaestion was his closest adviser, and when he died, Alexanders life collapsed. True, there are no cell phone pictures of Alexander and Hephaestion having sex, but let's be honest. Same sex relationships among the Greeks at that time was well known and not that big of a deal. The thought of Alexander being bisexual should not distract from the reality that he was one of the greatest military leaders of all time.

Putting aside the awful blond wig and silly Irish accent, Colin Farrell does a commendable job in the lead. Alexander was not just a conqueror and lover, but someone who valued culture and history. Farrell is believable in the role.

If you love world history, there is no way to avoid this movie. Put it on your list.",1524787200,,1773,4.80327868852459

8182667,2,B000O17120,"Great movie except for one thing...Hollywood's leftist obsession with portraying Alexander as a homosexual, when there is ZERO evidence to support this idea.  I'd be perfectly happy if Alexander was gay...but I disagree creating lies to fit someone's political agenda. There are no bonds between men stronger than those formed in battle, but such love does not mean it is sexual in nature.  And NO ancient sources state that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual.  I'll say that again...THERE ARE ZERO SOURCES which claim Alexander had gay relationships.  ZERO, and this surely would have been noted if it were true, as so much detail about Alexander's life was known and written about.  Its understandable for people to speculate about it, and certain people want it to be true, but that doesn't make it so.  Alexander married several times, and even had a harem of women.  Which brings me to the next point.  Why is a an African-America actress used to depict Alexander's first wife, who was Bactrian and from a Caucasoid region of the Hindu Kush?  She was not African, nor even dark skinned.  Now, again, I'd be perfectly fine with such a depiction if it were the truth, but its not!  Why does Hollywood do this?  Do they see some advantage in re-writing history by portraying the world's greatest military mind as a gay man married to an African?  It's hard to find a rational answer for this....but it was done very clearly an intentional fashion, and done for a reason.  In any case, give it a rest Hollywood...try being honest for once.",1516492800,2,1606,4.9
8182668,2,B000O17120,"Meh! It's Ok! Parts of it are excellent and parts of it are just horrible...not sure what to say about it.
Wasn't as good as Troy by any means. The good parts were fantastic but the bad parts were just ...BAD....super BAD! It's worth watching at least once I guess, but it will not keep you on the edge of your seat. It's one of those movies you don't mind pausing to get up and go to the bathroom or grab some more popcorn. And while your up, throw a load of clothes in and then make the kids lunch and a few other things before you remember that you were watching it.",1515974400,2,569,4.04424778761062

8182670,2,B000O17120,So the issue I have with this movie is that it is not historically accurate. Alexander being gay with various boy slaves and lovers is conjecture. To make a movie that shows this with such certainty is just plain incorrect. I graduated with a M.A in history with a focus on the ancient near east. Trust me when I tell you that nowhere is there any proof of Alexander being a bi-sexual or homosexual though it was not uncommon at that time. I can't speculate as to why this was included in the movie but the motives are likely the more current political climate. I have no issue with gay people or if someone was or is but seriously there is no evidence in history. Sorry hollywood Alexander was probably a straight guy who kicked ass and took names. The movie itself beside this massive inaccurate point is not that bad. The movie has good acting by Colin Farrell and it is worth a watch but to anyone out there please do not conclude that one of the earths greatest conquerors was gay or bi. Hollywood is up to some shenanigans here.,1501545600,,1034,4.390625
