894346,5,6304479700,it's really Great seeing Elvis at what He did Very Well&that is on the Stage&Performing.the Guy could sing so many styles. His Voice sounds Strong all through this Video. A Must have.,1039824000,12,183,4.75
894347,5,6304479700,"I did not have high hopes about this tape but rather purchased it on a lark. This video turned out to be GREAT! Elvis does some of his best music with style and grace in this video, and I am more than pleased with it's content. Don't let the reasonable price fool you - this tape is gold!",1015027200,19,288,3.9827586206896552
894348,4,6304479700,This movie is the lost performances from 'That's the way it is' and 'Elvis on tour'. It shows rehearsal scenes and the side of Elvs all Elvis fans love ..............seeing him perform on stage with all  his charisma.,1003622400,5,217,4.7105263157894735
894349,5,6304479700,"The video-tape is already a while available in Europe, and it 's still unbelievable that Dennis Sanders then cut-out those  scenes from the original release in the early 70's... These scenes are far better then what've been left over in the original film-release of That's The Way It is! Fans were able to hear most of the ""los performances"" versions on the ""70's blackbox""  already, BUT to see them now alive...... That is called: "" FINISHING it off! ""
Check out the 2001DVD version of That's the Way it (Special Edition) remastered/re-sceduled and re-editted and you'll see what the MOVIE should have been in the early 70's!",989280000,16,626,4.841121495327103
894350,5,6304479700,"Elvis the lost performances is a terrific video.  In this video Elvis sings a little bit of everything.  He even goes back to his country roots.  My favorite song in it is ""Just Pretend"".  It really makes you  realize great of a singer he really is. I would recomend this to ANY Elvis  fan.  This is a A+ video.",953596800,27,311,4.169491525423729
894351,5,6304479700,"In this video Elvis brings out some of the best ballads he has. He`s performance is very royal and when he sings songs like: Don`t cry daddy,There goes my everything,Make the world go away and 20 days & 20  nights. He really moves my heart. NOTE! The tape has a very good and FAST  version of HOUND DOG,dont miss it. The outtakes from the studio rehersals  is also great,it gives us a close contact with our King. The sound is also  the best i`ve ever heard in a Elvis film and with a Dolby Surround System  you get a really great concert experience.",952560000,30,550,4.300970873786408
894352,5,6304479700,"it's beautiful video, specially such perfomances as ""walk a mile in my shoes"",""don't cry daddy"", ""make the world go away"",""how great thou art"", and my favorite ""just  pretend""",945475200,24,175,5.25
894453,5,6304479700,"I really love this video.  The many people who loved him also worked with him.  He put his soul into each performance, so incredible.  Don't miss this opportunity to make this purchase.",1353110400,,185,4.71875
894454,5,6304479700,"Yes, we still have one ancient video player connected, and I recently pulled this video tape to watch again.  This is fantastic footage of Elvis!  What idiot at Turner has not released this material on DVD?  The material on this video is as good as the performances in ""That's the Way It Is"" and ""Elvis on Tour.""  This is material that was recorded for these movies but not used, and it is excellent. There are great performances of songs such as ""In the Ghetto,"" ""Just Pretend,"", ""Walk a Mile in My Shoes,"" ""How Great Thou Art,"" ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" (done seriously, not jokingly as in many versions), and many others.  Whether you're an Elvis fan or not, this is a wonderful sampling of Elvis at his best.  Buy it while you can.",1320710400,2,737,4.503759398496241

894456,5,6304479700,"This tape starts out with Elvis doing a superb rendition of ""Walk a mile in my shoes"" and just keeps on going from there.  Lots of the classics he performed live in the '70's here.  He was in top form in '70 and '72, still lean and mean and thin and at the top of his game.  These recordings are from before the Aloha concert and after the '68 Comeback Special, basically when the King was still fantastic in every regard.  An awesome tape.",1265155200,3,440,4.2023809523809526
894457,5,6304479700,"This tape has some of the finest material recorded for ""That's the Way It Is.""  I can't imagine why it wasn't included in the movie.  (Some of it, but not all, is included in the ""Special Edition"" of TTWII.)

I can't imagine why this is not out on DVD!  Buy this--you won't be sorry!",1185062400,6,283,4.185185185185185
894458,5,6304479700,This has some great footage of Elvis rehearsing.  It shows him at his best.  This compliments both Elvis that is the way it is and Elvis on tour.,1176076800,2,145,4.142857142857143
894459,5,6304479700,"As a fan and former Elvis Impersonator from NY/NJ, I collect everything I can on Elvis and this tape and Laserdisc are classic companions to THAT'S THE WAY IT IS and ELVIS ON TOUR.

I'm hoping that Ted Turner will continue to serve Elvis fans what they desire and release all the media available to us Elvis fans, including ELVIS ON TOUR....which I have already put on DVD from the remastered Laserdisc print in LTBX.

Again, this Great video must be put on DVD!!!",1140134400,7,464,4.511904761904762
894460,5,6304479700,"""DON'T CRY DADDY"", ""IN THE GHETTO"", ""HOW GREAT THOU ART"", ""THE
WONDER OF YOU"".  THESE ARE ONLY A FEW OF THE GREAT SONGS THAT WERE CUT
FROM ELVIS'S LIVE PERFORMANCES.  STILL CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHY.  ELVIS ALSO
DOES A MEDLEY OF SOME OF HIS OLDER SONGS...QUITE WONDERFULLY I MIGHT ADD.
THIS IS BY FAR THE LEAST EXPENSIVE VIDEO I HAVE EVER PURCHASED, AND IT IS
ACTUALLY THE BEST.  I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF ELVIS.
NO ONE HAS EVER, OR WILL EVER CAPTURE THE PASSION OF HIS MAGNIFICENT VOICE.
I RECCOMMEND THIS VIDEO TO ALL.  YOU WILL BE AMAZED...I GIVE IT 10 STARS!!!!",1047254400,33,557,4.421568627450981
894461,5,6304479700,"This tape is made up of live concert performances filmed in 1970 and 1972 for the films ""That's The Way It Is"" and ""Elvis on Tour"", but were not used in either film. The tape features several stellar live performances by The King.
The first half starts off with a several live performances filmed for ""That's The Way It Is"" in 1970 at The International Hotel in Las Vegas. In this half, Elvis churns out stunning performances of ""The Wonder Of You"", ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Hound Dog"", ""Don't Be Cruel"" and ""Don't Cry Daddy"". Elvis sings a powerful ""In The Ghetto"" and an emotional ""Make The World Go Away"". The second half features several songs from rehearsals. This half features Elvis running through his old songs. Elvis goofs on ""I Was The One"", but Elvis makes it worthwhile and nevertheless entertaining. He goes back to his days at Sun Records for ""Baby Let's Play House"", which rocks and rolls thanks to some stellar rhythm guitar playing by Elvis. Elvis then delves into his 1957 number one hit ""Don't"", which is funny yet sincere. He then goes back to his first RCA recording session with ""Money Honey"". The third and final half features live performances from 1972. These are my favorite ones. Elvis kicks off a rocking ""All Shook Up"", which is followed a nostalgic ""Teddy Bear/Don't Be Cruel"" medley, which is restarted 3 times because the camera guy didn't get a shot of Glend D. Hardin playing the intro on piano. After this comes a stunning ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" that is the highlight of the tape. Elvis's voice is filled with painful regret and emotion.
The show ten gets back to the happy tunes with a stellar ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" in which Elvis belts out the last verse with flare. After that comes a towering ""How Great Thou Art"", which is the tape's other standout. The video's closing live performance is a flawless ""Release Me"" that sways with midtempo country blended in with uptempo rock. The credits feature Elvis rehearsing a brilliant ""I Can't Stop Lovinng You"" with the band.
These performances were certainly not forgotten. This is a stellar tape.",1039910400,54,2085,4.746556473829201

Elvis like most great rock n roller bands that made it BIG despite the negative
response like The Ramones! This is a great collection of rare Elvis songs! I
just got into his country songs and he does 3 here. It's Elvis so you should
get it anyway but it's one of his best concert performances ever!",1399075200,,529,4.463917525773196

7873480,5,6304479700,"My understanding is that there are technical and other issues preventing this from appearing on DVD. Someone else might know more about it, as I can't look it up at the moment. But there is something in the way. A lot of fans would absolutely love it.

This is simply great, from the rehearsals, to the performances, and even with all the new-fangled equipment around, I play this all the time.

Get the tape. If you have a transfer machine, transfer it to DVD, for safe-keeping, but do get it. If you dig Elvis, this is outstanding!

The rehearsals are uniformly wonderful; I'd rather not spoil any surprises. The performances are also very good to excellent. The live 1972 ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" is his best rendition since he first did the classic recording. He really MEANS it! One of the best live recordings of the post-1970 era, actually. So, you'll want this!

If you feel a little crazy buying a tape, you won't after you've watched it. Go for it.

All the best and Happy Holidays all!",1354924800,5,999,4.589887640449438
