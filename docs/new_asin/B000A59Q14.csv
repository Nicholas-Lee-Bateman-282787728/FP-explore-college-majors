2359369,1,B000A59Q14,This is one of those movies that deserves a negative star rating (-5). It's not worth a review. If you like office chairs for space craft seating and aluminum foil and flexible dryer duct robots then this might be for you. A root canal was more entertaining.,1339718400,,258,4.51063829787234
2359370,4,B000A59Q14,"Yes, it was gawd awful and that's why it was so good.  If the picnic love song doesn't have you on the floor laughing then you are probably a hopeless Earth human.  Also, hiding behind the bush during the nuclear explosion was a nice touch plus don't forget the molded jello served with the coffee.  Nothing great but who's expecting that anyway........",1323302400,5,353,4.661290322580645
2359371,3,B000A59Q14,"They shot it with a new fangled digital camera and used proprietary software to give it that old time patina of black and white with all the lines and scratches of time. They went out of their way to use not so steady framing and placed obscure cuts to give the feeling that it was spliced one too many times.

The film its self was made on a very budget over a very long time. They filmed in all the correct vantage sci-fi locations and had to sneak in as they did not get permits.

It may have been a tad campy but it had a better message than ""the day the earth stood still.",1304035200,,577,4.008695652173913
2359372,4,B000A59Q14,"Review Warning: I find myself enjoying these ""silly"" moral space comedies and I really like things such as  love songs being sung in the bomb shelter, 26lb Ray Guns and Tin Man Zombie Robots mixed in with ol' A-bomb footage and alien ""babes"" with Nefertiti hair cuts. The dialog is ""Thrilling"", the effects are ""Spectacular"" and the editing is as ""Fabulous"" as the Genre demands of a very low budget B/C(?) Drive-In Movie.

Again, you must like silly and enjoy satire combined with good period over acting and well crafted writing. If you do and get a smile when the flying saucer that looks like a 1950 Los Angles street light attacks or If you enjoyed Dark Star, or Red Dwarf, this may be a good pick for you.

If you are expecting Forbidden Planet, 2001, Alien, The Matrix or such you would be gravely disappointed renting or watching this.

Best,

Joe",1301011200,11,855,4.598684210526316
2359373,1,B000A59Q14,"This is a spoof of a 1950's SciFi B-movie.  Unfortunately it is so silly that it fails miserably.  Think of an even sillier movie than ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", but without the charm.  Sci B-movies usually had some logic to their plots, but this has none and is more like a pastiche of pieces, rather like Roger Corman's early efforts re-composing Russian sci fi movies.  The cliches are all there - a mars populated only by women, a mad scientist with a doomsday weapon, mad generals and shoot first, ask questions later cops.

Don't bother with this movie and watch something else.  If you do watch this, you will want your 80 minutes back.",1254009600,5,643,4.547826086956522
2359374,1,B000A59Q14,"First off the movie starts out with a 12 minute documentary of how this movie was originally filmed in the 50's and then confiscated by the US government; I highly doubt that this is the case.  The movie looks as if it were filmed with a camcorder and then doctored up to look like an older movie.  The actresses do not look like the same Hollywood B movie starlets that were in the 50's, they are not nearly as attractive and overweight.  The detective in the movie is wearing contemporary clothes down to the frames of his glasses. The acting is some of the worst that I have ever seen in any movie; high school kids could have done a better job.",1245283200,,648,4.295081967213115

8074416,1,B000A59Q14,Wow!!!what a trouble movie. They should of never allowed this stupid movie to be released!!! I really want to just throw up and when I close my eyes I have seizures,1392940800,,164,4.32258064516129
8074417,1,B000A59Q14,"They went way over budget making this, producer sold out cast, ruined their careers, was the cause of a suicide.  Then they spend millions to restore this.  I know a lot of ways to spend that kind of money on a one hour long movie that had bad acting.  And what's up with turning humans into metal robots (with reel to reel tape recorders on their chest) that get knocked out by a fist?  When the government banned this movie, they were protecting the public.  Should have stayed banned.  Horrible movie.",1374451200,,504,4.483516483516484
8074418,2,B000A59Q14,Funny and okay for a boring afternoon.  I might even watch it again in another 20 years. Give it a try!,1369440000,,103,3.9047619047619047
8074419,5,B000A59Q14,"DESTINATION MARS is an intentionally ridiculous parody of all those 1950s sci-fi epics we all know and love. An introductory mock-umemtary lets us know the strange, tragic ""history"" behind the film, including communism, black-listing, and the suicides of almost everyone involved! The actual movie is a well-made spoof, w/ nods to WAR OF THE WORLDS, EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, INVADERS FROM MARS, etc. DM comes complete w/ nefarious Martian babes, killer robots, wobbly UFOs, and mad science! If you enjoy the retro-hilarity of Larry Blamire or Christopher R. Mihm, then you'll have a blast w/ this Richard Lowry gem! May God help us all...",1367280000,,668,5.081818181818182
8074420,2,B000A59Q14,"Unless you like odd, one-off, personal projects that have very little in the way of production value. This is too bad to rise to the level of either unintentional camp or schlock.",1365811200,,179,4.625
8074421,4,B000A59Q14,Great piece for it's time period. He actually can cast his net to fish. Loved the way they still dressed for dinner when the world was essentially over.,1365292800,,152,4.464285714285714
8074422,2,B000A59Q14,"'Destination Mars' is a direct to video movie made in 2006.  It was made to look like an Ed Wood type B/W film from the 1950s. It starts with some modern day interviews with people supposedly related to those involved with the making of the fictional film. It also explains what later happened to the lead actors in the film. The premise is that the film's maker was blacklisted during the Mc Carthy era,  His film was confiscated then not released by the government till recently. They then say millions of dollars were spent to restore it to original condition.  I can appreciate what they were trying to do here and their attempt at a homage to bad sci-fi films of the 50s and Ed Wood specifically. I also understand that they had an estimated budget, about $10,000 according to the IMDB.  To some extent they succeeded with this attempt.  With a little more work it could have been much better. It really is pretty funny most of the time. For instance they copy the way the cops in 'Plan 9' would wave their guns around carelessly when they talked like it was an extension of their hand.  Also, the imitation 50s special effects were very well done.  Sadly at other times it just drags on. Unfortunately they included scenes that didn't belong in what they are mimicking, like two painful Nelson Eddy and Jeanette Macdonald type songs between the two young lovers.  That just wasn't 50s sci-fi like.  They also had scenes that seemed more 30s Flash Gordon sci-fi than 50s.  They should totally remove the opening dialog with the supposed interviews about the films fictional background.  That part was dragged out and took away from the overall illusion IMO.  It would have been better to just show their work and pretend it was a found film.

I do appreciate the effort they put into this and what they did with their surprisingly low budget.  I also share the film makers love of these old films.  I'll give them a 2 out of 5 for their almost successful attempt at a tribute.",1363392000,,1981,4.572237960339943
8074423,3,B000A59Q14,Didn't really find this to be all that funny. Being bad on purpose doesn't make it funny. Some clever stuff though!,1362441600,,115,4.523809523809524
8074424,5,B000A59Q14,"A terrific DVD. Excellent picture and sound Goofy movie.

The DVD contains lots of extras at a documentary about the history of this masterpiece motion picture.

On the other hand the instant video gave lower quality picture and sound. Get the DVD.

OK a silly but I love having it in my collection.

Charity Peters is 110 in the shade !!!",1360454400,,339,4.508196721311475
8074425,4,B000A59Q14,"The opening mockumentary goes a little too far in trying to show the tragic outcome of the film's stars, but once it starts this movie was a lot of fun. This film pays a homage to really bad 50's black and white sci-fi movies like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" by doing it's best to recreate them by spoofing what made them awful. Generic sets, terrible dialogue, and acting meant to be bad. Not perfect, but I really thought the film makers did a great job with what they were trying to do with this movie and there was a lot to laugh at.",1357948800,,535,4.153846153846154
