1673440,3,B00005V9KX,"Perhaps I am a dolt incapable of understanding profoundly challenging entertainment.  ""Sexy Beast"" made little sense to me.  It is only the performances of Ben  Kingsley as Don Logan and Ray Winstone as Gal Dove that provided a significant reason to endure the experience.  Who chose the title of ""Sexy Beast?"" Rarely have  I ever encountered a less appropriate title for a movie concerning violent thugs.  Kingsley definitely wishes to stretch his acting talents and abandon the Ghandi  image.  He brilliantly plays an unforgettable vicious psychopathic monster.  Winstone is able to convey fear and unease without hardly saying a word.  This is an  actor possessing incredible skill.  Amanda Redman does a convincing job portraying Gal's loving and loyal wife DeeDee who enjoys their family life as retired and  affluent ex-thieves in beautiful Spain.
The Logan character invites himself into their home and demands that Gal returns to England for one last robbery.  He will not take no for an answer, and places the  couple in an untenable position.  Ian McShane plays the role of Teddy Bass, the crime boss whose management skills are more than sufficient to encourage  cooperation between disparate individuals in order to achieve a common goal.  The vulgarity and violence are not for the squeamish.  Blood flows and guts are  splattered.  Those seeking an escapist story line should shun ""Sexy Beast.""  The actual robbery is ludicrous, and would have little chance of succeeding in real life.  There are gaps of logic laced throughout ""Sexy Beast.""  The film, though, does have its moments.  One can legitimately compare it to Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp  Fiction.""
The British Isle accents are difficult to comprehend.  And yes, I will admit to wishing for subtitles (When will movie producers cease the nonsense of refusing to  provide subtitles to American audiences?  Most people hesitate to be candid, but will blurt out the truth if really pushed).  ""Sexy Beast"" earn three stars.  The great  acting is its sole saving grace.  Only the true Ben Kingsley fan should go out of their way to view ""Sexy Beast.""",994464000,7,2117,5.114369501466276
1673441,4,B00005V9KX,"There are two types of British thrillers: the genteel, Miss Marple-style ones, where murder and mayhem are discussed over tea and crumpets, and the ones which make Mike Hammer look like Miss Marple. ""Sexy Beast"" is emphatically of the second type. Stylish, brutal, blood-soaked and incredibly well-acted, ""Sexy Beast"" is a heist movie that has some trenchant, even profound, observations on the nature of good and evil, love and hate. Ben Kingsley--playing the role that in an American movie would go to either Dennis Hopper or Christopher Walken--has been getting the lion's share of the critics' attention, and indeed he is superb; he comes across as Satan incarnate, and an oversexed Satan at that. But to concentrate on Kingsley is to slight the outstanding contributions of Ian McShane--even more threatening than Kingsley in a much quieter role--or of Ray Winstone and Amanda Redman as central characters Gal and Dede. A retired thief and an ex-porn star, Gal and Dede are not tasteful, not eloquent, not refined, and yet their courage, devotion and capacity for love are the stuff of which England's greatest literature is made. As fine as ""Sexy Beast"" is, however, it left me with an ""Is that all there is?"" feeling. In the end, the story promised more than it delivered. But the acting alone makes ""Sexy Beast"" at least 850 times better than ""Snatch"" and other style-over-substance British crime flicks.",994464000,6,1412,5.064377682403434
1673442,3,B00005V9KX,"You can take my review with this grain of salt if you like.  I went in knowing very little about Sexy Beast except I was a little intrigued  about it having caught the tail end of the Ebert and Roper review.  They were commenting about how scary Ben Kingsley was as Don Logan and that even the back of his neck was scary. Suffice it to say a shaved head, big arm tattoos and a goatee with downturned moustache helps create a tough guy image and it works on Ben Kingsley too.  However I think this is not a good reason to see the movie.  Kingsley did a fine job, however its hard not to take in his diminutive stature and too tight slacks which made him slightly comical.  I dislike coming down on this film because it was not shot with a big budget. There were sound problems making the thick accents off the lesser characters difficult to understand at times. But mostly I felt there were some odd choices made that prevented a strong emotional bond with the ""good guys"" in the film.  The family and friends are largely left to express themselves in somber looks and very little dialog.  This works effectively in the opening scenes when it is announced Don Logan will be arriving on a plane the next day.  The distress is palpable. However affection and family bonds are hard to read.  The main character pretty much has to tell us verbally he loves his wife and the neighbor loves his wife.  Their relationships look rather gray and non communicative. When they do communicate it feels like they are not reaching one another at all. This is a bleek move for a film in the comedy genre...even a black comedy.  The heist which is the focal point of the film should have been very interesting. While unique it  suffered from a lack of set up and choreography to let you know what steps were involved so that there was some tension being created and so you could know when goals were achieved so you could celebrate a little.  The whys and wherefores of this break-in in which water plays an important part were taken for granted and left the whole segment feeling unnecessarily flat. For myself, the comedy was a little too dry and the drama a little too light to say I really enjoyed Sexy Beast.  It was often entertaining to be sure.  But not enough to recommend.",994464000,3,2265,4.434782608695652
1673443,1,B00005V9KX,"It's either a terrific movie with these qualities:
 Hidden very subtle humor.  Characters we are challenged to focus on despite the fact they are not physically attractive.  Characters we are challenged to care about despite the fact they are morally complex and maybe more odious than otherwise.  Characters we are challenged to grasp despite the fact they are multi-dimensional.  A story that does not follow the Hollywood 3-act system.  A story that challenges us to distinguish the present from the past.  A story that challenges us to understand the plot without backstory or exposition.
It's either all that. Or it's pretentious trash.
Despite Ben Kingsley's good work, I am in the latter camp. I was actively bored for the first hour; not restless; bored. I did not respect the many scenes with people walking ""as if they had a purpose"" (many such scenes; filler or what?). I found the music abrupt, disruptive, very distracting, and obviously manipulative, telling us precisely how to feel, like the worst Hollywood drivel/dreck. I cared about no one.
I disrespect the filmmakers latching on to the kitschy trend of sticking an old Dean Martin Capitol record on closing credits. (""Hey, how about a Dean Martin song to close a British movie?"" ""Coo-ulll idear. Very cree-ay-tiv."")
One example of how bad the movie is:
We first see Ben Kingsley in profile, walking ""as if he had a purpose,"" walking in a predatory march, in profile. Fine, I get it. --CUT TO: He is a passive, semi-relaxed passenger in a car. Does this mean he's multi-dimensional (predatory and/or passive) and we should pay attention? Or does it tell me the director and writer were very confused?
I wanted to like this movie. I couldn't wait for it to end!",993772800,17,1730,4.904109589041096
1673444,5,B00005V9KX,"I went to Sexy Beast last night not knowing too much about it except for the fact that Ben Kingsley was in it playing a gangster. As the movie progressed I watched in awe at how good this film actually was and couldn't help still thinking about it the next day. The plot is about an ex-gangster Gal (Ray Winstone) who is retired from his life of crime and wants nothing but to lay in the sun near his pool all day. Until a pyschotic figure from his past Don (Ben Kingsley) comes to his villa to try and persuade him into doing one last job. Although this sounds like your typical gangster plot, it is given a fresh spin by the films director Jonathon Glazer. He gives the crime/heist genre a new approach and really makes you think about the images he throws at you. As the movie moves forward towards the climax Mr. Glazer grabs you by the throat and holds you captive with tension until you sit forward and bite your nails. I couldn't help thinking that Jonathon is the kind of director who could be the offspring of Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie. The radical editing techniques and cool imagery also add to the atmosphere of this movie. The film is wrapped up in oscar worthy performances by Kingsley & Winstone. Not only am I convinced that Kingsley can play any role now but he easily makes my top 20 actor list now. No villan can be complete without the hero and newcomer Ray Winstone who plays Gal steps up to the plate brilliantly. I see lots of work ahead for these two actors. The only thing I disliked about this movie is that the British accents we're so thick sometimes, that it was hard to follow in places. It gets easier to understand as you get into the characters and by 20 minutes into the movie I was all set. If your looking for a great movie in this sea of summer garbage tread to a good megaplex and find this movie.",993254400,36,1843,4.314121037463977
1673445,4,B00005V9KX,"You've never seen Ben Kingsley like this before and you never will again, which... if you need just one reason to see this film... is why.  From the moment Don Logan arrives in Spain, the tension is so thick you can't even cut it with a knife.  I simply must applaud the casting of Kingsley for this role.  Perhaps the genius of Sexy Beast lies in its defying of stereotypical  typecasting.  Ben Kingsley is the one person you would least expect to see playing a bald-shaved, rude, vile and downright blunt hardcore gangster, shattering his former career image as a benevolent pacifist in award winning performances such as Ghandi and Schindler's List with a truly unforgettable performance as a badass villain in the process.  While Kingsley chews the scenery, it is worth mentioning that veteran Ian McShane (Lovejoy) nearly steals the show as the cold-blooded Teddy, but Kingsley's scenes truly liven this film with his painfully outrageous obscenities.  Forget Snatch, Sexy Beast is the best import from the U.K. since Trainspotting.",993168000,2,1037,5.029239766081871
1673446,4,B00005V9KX,"I managed to see Sexy Beast in England this February. Being a fan of Ben Kingsley I didn't have much expectations other than seeing him on the screen. But the movie was worth watching.
The plot is as follows: Gal (Ray Winstone) is retired from villainy, living the lazy life in a villa in Spain with his ex-porn star wife, Deedee (Amanda Redman), when Logan (Ben Kingsley) turns up to recruit him for a bank job in London. He has every intention of refusing, except that Logan is not a man to cross, being pathologically unhinged.
The film has a very interesting and good opening scene. I'm not gonna spoil it for you but I'll say that it's between a man and a boulder.
The acting is superb. Especially Ben Kingsley is nothing short of amazing. When looked overall, the movie has its flaws but it's worth giving a try.
Note: If there was an option I would give it 3.5 stars.",991440000,28,874,4.401234567901234

1673468,4,B00005V9KX,"Sexy Beast is highly amusing, if you like hardboiled/noir brutal comedy. It's no picnic when ferociously demented Ben Kingsley shows up at Ray WInstone's villa in Spain demanding the robber enlists in one last job. That job, instigated by the great Ian McShane, is a tense one, but virtually relaxing after the scenes with Kingsley acting out.

They have cut out the line where DD says ""You never have the calamari"" and Gary replies ""Yeah but I just feel like it"" which doesn't seem like much here in a review, but it showed so well how happy Gary was in Spain. Worse they have cut Don's shaving scene to about half of the original making his move from the bathroom to the bedroom fairly nonsensical. The original shaving scene was the best scene in the film. Too bad.",1461456000,,484,4.21505376344086
1673476,5,B00005V9KX,"This is a great heist flick and probably my favorite movie ever.  Don Logan is a psychopath extraordinaire, menacing, hyperactive, relentless and neat as a pin.  Even though we never see lovable Gal chomping on antacids or attempting a clumsy escape, his stress is palpable.  The storyline is clever while still being believable, lacking convenient coincidences and sacrificing the guaranteed blockbuster status that comes with a hot-right-now-flash-in-the-pan actors for a REAL cast who all fit together just right.  The surreal, artsy sequences seemed out of place to me at first, but they grew on me and finally it dawned on me that they lend the movie a lightness that would not otherwise have been possible given the plot line and wind up being a jewel-like pane of insight through a life of strain and exhausting intrigue into Gal's golden, hapless heart.  There is some adult content which annoys me when it doesn't further the plot line, but in this case it does serve to flesh out some of the minor characters and the events that brought this brilliant maelstrom of a story to its ultimate by-the-skin-of-Gal's teeth fruition.

Ray Winstone (played Mr. French - Jack Nicholson's # 1 - in The Departed) nails his part as a retired safe cracker enjoying the fruits of his jaded labor in the peace and sunshine of Spain with his ex-pornstar wife. Ray's best buddy and his wife are down there with them. It is as close to a perfect life as anyone could imagine: very nice house, big pool, beautiful views, nice weather, good friends, good food... living the dream.

Kingsley shows up to recruit Ray for a job, along with another ulterior motive that manifests itself later in the film. Suffice it to say Ben's character doesn't easily take no for an answer. What follows is awesome & suspenseful cinema.

Great dialog & direction. The story moves at a perfect pace. Concise at just 1.5 hours.

1673538,5,B00005V9KX,"A largely overlooked English gangster film from the year 2000.  First time I heard about this film was few weeks ago, after watching Hyena (2014) I read professional film reviews that praised Hyena and compared it to Sexy Beast.  Since I like Hyena, I need it to see Sexy Beast and find out if it is that good as ""they"" say it is.

Sexy Beast is not your typical English crime-action thriller, it borderlines more on dark-crime heist film slightly similar in nature to The Business (2005) starting Danny Dyer and Tamer Hassan (both films were predominantly shot in Spain).  Sexy Beast also reminded me of a film called The Hit (1984), again the set up of the films is tropical Spain and the characters of Don (Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast) and Braddock (John Hurt in The Hit) are somewhat identical, although not quite when it comes to temper. Don played by above mentioned Sir Ben Kingsley, is an English gangster with a very hot temper and menacing demeanor (a sort of bully if you like). Ray Winston portrays Gary, a laid-back, happily married, retired safe-cracker that once used to work for Don.  One day, Don comes to Spain to tell (you read right, not to ask, but to tell) Gary that he needs to go back to London with him for one last ""job""...

This film does an outstanding job on character development for both Don and Gary.  The film is something like an English version of Pulp Fiction (1994), lots of great-one-liners, plenty of swearing, tough personalities, and topnotch acting all throughout...",1431216000,3,1507,4.664150943396226

1673578,4,B00005V9KX,"Not as good as I remembered. Sir Ben munches on so much scenery, one wonders if he was simply told to go for it or tried to steal it. It's Ray Winstone's movie, and in many ways his coming-out party; he's the titular Sexy Beast- not psychopath Ben. One who follows Kingsley's career has become used to him in these roles of late, now to the point of camp and a self-effacing turn in the last Iron film extravaganza, but the small little angry man being a force of nature to be contended with - just as he was in Gandhi but turned on its head - was still novel at the time. The character is iconic but short- lived, which is one reason that's he's famous for performing it but it's not a famous character. The preview is tantalizing but the movie short. With the benefit of hindsight, Ian McShane's dark menace sans facial hair and rich baritone go unexplored and under-utilized; he may be the best actor in his film, but don't have enough material to tell. Worth seeing, but screening recent similar films of this genre, it's just watchable to see these 3 at work. It won't be wasted time; It's taut, mesmerizing from the get-go, but gone so fast it's one of the rare moves you wonder what more they could have done with a half hour extra? THAT would be the best stuff on the cutting room floor. If, on the other hand, the script was all they had to work with (and it is fine, award-winning stuff) and the stars embellished, then kudos to them and we are doing little other than watching them play off of each other. Films like Layer Cake and even the gaudy over-produced Snatch have raised the bar and times have changed. The film if released today would be lauded in kind, but has frankly been surpassed by similar cinema which may have found their original inspiration in this laconic material - but who now have surpassed it as audiences have become accustomed to a more frenetic, less nuanced approach and pace. Sexy Beast, for all it's boast, might be relegated to a boutique cinema or an art house - for these days our real villains are in the news and our movies Michael Bay CGI pastiche - but then I find myself arguing and rooting for this film rather than against it. See it, share it, encourage it - maybe they will make more!!!",1413158400,,2240,4.387019230769231

Ray Winstone is a great actor, as are Ian McShane and Ben Kingsley--they are a delight to watch and as always, McShane just tears it up in the most understated way. KIngsley plays a totally out of ""character"" role as a Cockney hood and he does it deliciously. In spite of this, I had to almost hide my eyes at times--Jonathan Glazer is a miraculous director and his newest film, Under the Skin, is incredible and lush, and I loved it, but I found Sexy Beast offensive in places and kind of dank, down and dirty in a way that I didn't like watching. The story, such as it is, just wasn't compelling enough. No surprises, quite a lot missing-- I wanted more character, more interaction and more backstory. In this film Glazer seems like an MTV director who just graduated into big people's movies. Under the Skin is much more developed. However this is an earlier film and perhaps he was still working his stuff out. The quick cuts, the visual novelty, one thing after the other--it was too much.

Sure, the experts are being pulled back in from retirement, but they plan to do things their way, with some extra risks and thrills thrown in, including unimaginable psychological pressure.  Everything is thrown suddenly into question.

Kingsley, while not the principal character, steals the spotlight with just about the most charismatic evil that I have ever seen on the screen.  His presence exudes the strength of a psychotic killer used to bending men to his will as a lieutenant/enforcer for a bigger boss, McShane.  You get an entire sense of environment from Kingsley's demeanor, the true mark of a great actor.  But there is also McShane, a man beyond - or entirely incapable of - normal human emotion, who operates in the nether world of power, vengeance, and macho dares.  The scene where McShane attends a kind of sado-masochistic party for the business elite, encountering the enigmatic Foxx and going along for the ride, is classic.  There is an understanding between victim and perpetrator that is wonderfully subtle and ultimately unfathomable.

Recommended as an original viewing experience that, if not pleasant, definitely entertains.",1277078400,,1258,5.127450980392157
1673612,5,B00005V9KX,"Sexy Beast is one of the best movies ever made, in my opinion. It's not the best, but it is definately one of them. It's not sappy or sad, it's just awesome. I'd say at it's roots it is very complex, yet at the same time fairly simple. It's the tale of a ferocious, violent, and very dangerous criminal(Don,basically a totally sociopathic bully) who travels to Spain to recruit a another criminal(Gal,who's now retired) for a heist back home in London. Gal declines this offer, much to the dismay of Don, wishing to stay retired. The only problem is-Don wasn't really asking,and isn't going to take no for an answer. So he relentlessly bullys Gal(verbally and then physically), but Gal sticks to his guns. Before long, the situation boils-over, and chaos ensues. Eventually, Gal finds himself back in London, and out of retirement for one more job. And in the end he walks a tightrope when the man in charge, a crime-lord who hired Don, begins to become suspicious of Gal. Because it seems that Don never returned from Spain, and is nowhere to be found. Sir Ben Kingsley is absolutely astounding in this film, definately oscar worthy for his portrayal of Don. Ray Winstone and the rest of the cast are superb as well, but it's hard to compete,really, with a foaming-mouthed Ben Kingsley permeating out of my television every second he's on screen.

I knew he was a good actor from Schindlers List and Ghandi but this is something completely different. Its one of the best portrayals of a hard-man you'll ever see. The other surprise for me was the performance of Ian McShane who is utterly convincing as the crime boss behind the scenes. Almost as terrifying as Kingsley's performance.

The title is really misleading - the main concern here for people buying the film is the language. It is very very strong, and if you have a problem with people swearing a lot this is not a film for you.

A brilliant film.",1189209600,9,820,4.453333333333333
1673616,4,B00005V9KX,"This is a strangely compelling film, made so by the riveting performance of Ben Kingsley, who plays vitriolic, psychotic, British gangster, Don Logan. With a pulse pounding, rat-a-tat-tat delivery of lines and with a totally sinister and utterly ruthless persona, Don Logan, spewing cockney accented venom, is about as frightening a gangster as one may imagine. It is no wonder that Kingsley was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance.

The plot is simple. Retired thief, Gary ""Gal"" Dove (Ray Winstone), is living a relaxing, carefree life with his wife, DeeDee (Amanda Redman), an ex-porn star whom he clearly adores. With their ill gotten gains, they live in a beautiful, luxurious villa in Spain. They have a pool boy, Enrique, a local boy of whom they are clearly fond and who, it turns out, is fond of them. Former gangster, Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and his significant other, Jackie (Julianne White) also live in Spain. They all hang out together, living the good life. Their idyllic and carefree, expatriate lives are all shattered one day by the unwelcome intrusion of Don Logan, who comes to see Gal, as he wants to bring Gal out of retirement and back to England for one more heist. Don makes him an offer that, ultimately, due to a series of events, Gal finds that he cannot refuse.

The film is really not so much about the heist itself, though it is an integral part of the film. It is really about love, and what one will do to protect those that one loves. While Kingsley's performance is a showstopper, Ray Winstone gives a notable performance as a teddy bearish kind of guy. He is a retired gangster who has gone soft and just wants to live the good life in peace with his wife and with the company of a few friends. He truly does not want to be involved in the heist. He just wants to get out from under. Amanda Redman give a strong performance as DeeDee, a woman who will stop at nothing to secure the sanctity of her home and the safety of those whom she loves. Ian McShane is appropriately menacing and single minded as the mob boss heading up the heist. The rest of the cast is also superlative, making this an excellent, though different, gangster flick.

Be forewarned that the language employed by Don Logan in the film is absolutely filthy and offensive, and it is intended to be. So, if your sensibilities are easily offended, this is not the film for you. Moreover, the cockney accented delivery of lines was sometimes so fast, that I ended up watching the widescreen version with the English language subtitles on, so that I would not miss a thing. Hurrah for DVD for making this possible!",1148688000,,2627,4.633047210300429
1673630,4,B00005V9KX,"There was a lot of hype for this movie when it came out, and although some of it is warranted, as it's much better than most, don't except a masterpiece.
ASSETS:
Amazing casting of every single character, with a showy performance by Ben Kingsley, but all of the performers are great.
Well directed and written. Without giving too much away there is en extended water sequence that I loved. The director also does great work with the actors and all work from a solid script that treats its characters like people, not charicatures.
The story sticks to its intent and does not try to be all things to all people.
Great cinematography and innovative execution of heist and I did not see it coming.
Characters who you surprinsingly wind up caring about.
Ben Kingsley's performance is fantastic, but a tad overrated because it differs from that which he gave in ""Gandhi."" To me all the actors are just as good in their roles.
CONS:
The ""rabbit"" man. Please...... Talk about hitting the viewer over the head with a metaphor!!!
Although the story is simple, it lacks a little punch and in my opinion loses much steam when it should really be picking it up.
Although this can't be considered a true ""con"", the accents are really hard to understand. The end effect for me is that it kept me watching more intently so more than a ""con"" it's more of a warning.
Final Analysis: All in all and entertaining flick. The performances are outstanding as is the direction, but the story needs a better last act. If you are in the mood for a foreign flick of this nature, try this one and you may want to check out ""Croupier,"" which I think is even better with the genre.",1081641600,2,1652,4.528428093645485
1673631,4,B00005V9KX,"The tone for Sexy Beast is set the moments the credit begin to roll. The Strangler's 'Peaches'- a song that is nothing short of gleeful lechery personified- slinks and oozes over the opening shots like the sweat on Ray Winstone's aging body. This movie is all about lust: Teddy's for making the ultimate robbery, Don's for Gal's return to corruption and for onetime lover Jackie, and Gal's to lead a relatively stress-free life with his wife and son in sunlight-saturated Spain.
What keeps the plot from getting stale in this heist movie is that the heist itself is made secondary to the lead characters. More time and footage is spent examining Gal's 'new' and idyllic lifestyle and Don's fantatical need to have him come back to London for one last job while the robbery itself is condensed into a matter of  suspenseless minutes. That is not to say this movie isn't a nailbiter, there were several instances where I found myself recoiling in shock and clutching my face in surprise. Cutting down on the artificial elements involved in most British gang movies actually serves to create more real, and ultimately more horrifying moments by lulling you into a false sense of security.
Ben Kingsley is a quivering bowstring of energy but often takes things close to, and sometimes completely, over the top and around the bend. Ray Winstone is phenomenal as Gal; you will have no doubt that this pudgily imperfect man was once a hardened criminal. Ian McShane manages to banish all comparisons to his Lovejoy character with his weathered skin, deadened eyes and 'involvement' (to put it politely) with a bisexual bank manager at an orgy. The accents are thick, but if you've picked this up chances are you've already tried one or both of Guy Ritchie's films (I refuse to recognize a certain remake starring a certain talentless pop star as his work) and your ears should be used to it.
What keeps this just short of the five-star mark are some cheesy effects (including Kingsley's unabashed mugging) that pull you out of the movie's gritty reality. The rabbit is slightly forgiveable because of the payoff we're treated to at the end but the boulder is a laughably obvious hunk of styrofoam.",1054771200,,2190,4.84

The plot moves excruciatingly slowly --at least during the first two-thirds of the movie that I managed to watch.  A guy walks around a swimming pool for 20 minutes while the soundtrack music plays.  A bunch of people sit around a coffee table for 10 minutes not talking, while the soundtrack plays.  It just goes on and on like that, so that not only are you clicking the volume up and down, you're fast-forwarding to find bits of the movie that will move the plot a little.

You feel the threat of danger and SOMETHING about to happen whenever he's on screen and that anticipation is what makes ""Sexy Beast"" so imminently watchable. While Logan is indeed a fowl mouthed, juggernaut to be reckoned with, one also senses a hint of insecurity and uncertainty in his actions (ie; if he doesn't bulldog and curse everyone he feels threatened by, they'll somehow overpower him, so he levels them first with his bile-spewing temper) best shown in the bathroom mirror scene when he chides himself for revealing too much to Gal (Ray Winstone) in the bar, it's a powerhouse performance. Overall, ""Sexy Beast"" is a very good film to watch over and over as it has many layers beneath it's glossy, serene surface and requires great patience and attention from the viewer.
Thoroughly enjoyable.",1022889600,2,924,5.0064935064935066
1673635,5,B00005V9KX,"Yes, just about everybody who talks about the movie centers on Ben Kingsley's performance, and deservedly so.  But I rate the film very highly independent of Kingsley, and something different that I liked about his performance.
First, the entire story.  A retired gangster is trying to enjoy the good life.  The movie shows him as fat and lackadasical, but he wants it that way.  He feels he's earned his retirement, and this is exactly what he wants to do.  Nobody's going to pull him out of retirement for ""one last job"", which is why the big boys in London send the Kingsley character to do it.
Kingsley's character is not even going to let you condsider thinking about refusing him.  He comes on as an extreme hard-ass from the first moment he's on screen, and never lets go.  If he says he's going to kill you for an insignificant offense, you don't doubt him for a minute.
But what makes Kingsley's performance so special is that you realize how insecure the character is, and Kingsley lets this show.  A real pro could have instilled just as much fear in his prey in a much more subtle manner.  He's probably not got a long career as a criminal because he attracts too much attention to himself in public, a no-no in the mob.  As he's essentially a stupid, insecure, and even frightened character, his tactic is to blitzkrieg your senses before you have a chance to react.  He's not a great criminal, but a memorable one, and that's what I really like about it.
The surrounding story tries to get a bit artsy, and works more than it doesn't.  The Ray Winstone character, even though he's retire, is plagued by his own demons.  You even get to see the demon, portrayed as kind of a werewolf, and it sticks with him throughout the movie.  The job he is called upon to do is shot very stylishly, but I would think the location they are trying to hit would have security devices that would have detected what they were trying to do.  And Ian McShane's performance as the boss who sends Kingsley to fetch Winstone is a perfect portrayal of cold, calculated evil.  It's how the Kingsley character SHOULD act, but not nearly as much fun to watch.
See it.",1018915200,,2154,4.512886597938144
1673636,4,B00005V9KX,"Although the story is essentially an old one, without many new twists, (ex-con is blackmailed into doing one last job) Sexy Beast is so well written, directed, and acted that the tension simmers throughout, and you barely notice.  Blissfully happy in his retirement in Spain, Gal (Ray Winstone) is far from happy when Don Logan, a connection from his gangster past, shows up to order him back to London, the boss wants him.  Gal and his friends try to escape, but are inevitably sucked back into the whole crooked web.  The early scenes in Spain show both the paradise that Gal feels he's finally earned, and the claustrophobia of the hot, sticky air once Don Logan's breathing down everyone's necks.  The acting is extremely good, from Winstone and Amanda Redman as the almost-happy couple, to Ian McShane as the coldly terrifying Teddy Bass, the boss back in London.  Ben Kingsley truly steals the show as Logan--tough, terrifying, angry, paranoid, dangerous and pathetic, ultimately a power-mad second-in-command spinning completely out of control.  It's a truly fabulous performance, and gives Sexy Beast a lot of its punch.",1018224000,,1128,5.07027027027027
1673637,2,B00005V9KX,"Director Jonathan Glazer has created a beast alright, but not the one he had in mind. In fact, ""Sexy Beast"" may drive various viewers temporarily insane, as they may be prone to methods of self-punishment after sitting through 89 minutes of endless profanity, acting that, for the most part, is wasted on banal, lurid characters, and the unending sense that nothing of importance is going on in this dreamlike wasteland.
The film stars Ray Winstone as Gal, a retired member of a closely-knit gangster ring who has relocated to Spain from England, away from his past and from edgy gangster Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), who, it appears, is coming to call once again. After a dinner party with friends turns sour when it is learned that Don wants Gal for one last job, things reach new levels of discomfort, especially when Don arrives and begins making his presence known to his timid hosts.
As Gal, Winstone does indeed possess a quiet rebellion that grows deeper as he is physically and psychologically tormented by Don. It is Kingsley, however, who practically steals the show from his fellow cast members, exuding his authoritative figure in every scene just as he did in a far different manner in ""Gandhi."" He practically makes the movie, even if his talent goes to waste on a character who is as repulsive as he is demeaning.
Aside from these two great performers, there's little else worthy of one's time in ""Sexy Beast."" Virgin-screenwriters Louis Mellis and David Scinto throw in completely unnecessary subplots, ranging from various dream sequences involving a beastly creature who stalks Gal, to a throwaway twist that involves Don's affair with Jackie (Julianne White), the wife of Gal's close friend, Aitch (Cavan Kendall). To what purpose does it advance the plot? Why should we care whether or not their lives are destroyed by such a revelation, given that we have had little time to get to know them?
Director Glazer, whose previous track record is composed of television commercials and music videos, directs the film without grace, style, or a clear understanding of the plot itself. The first half of the film, that which is devoted to the game of wits between Gal and Don, raises a small hope for better things to come as the movie progresses; alas, we are given little more than a revenge/heist scenario that lacks impact or resonance it so desperately deserves.
In short, ""Sexy Beast"" is a real beast of a movie that is neither sexy nor interesting, and chooses to substitute repetitive dialogue and abundant profanities for real conversation and plot development. Kingsley leaves a meager lasting impression, but odds are the film's rancid aftertaste will erase it from memory before you've had too much time to think it through.",1017014400,4,2747,4.935205183585313
1673638,4,B00005V9KX,"I predicted that ""Sexy Beast"" would consist of 90 minutes of Ben Kingsley chasing Ray Winstone around a Spanish villa, yelling David Mametisms into his ear until one or the other of them ended up dead.  I was partially right (I won't give away which part I was right about, except that the Mamet allusion above was complimentary rather than critical).  Thankfully, that's not all this film has to offer.  A premise that could have ended up like the engrossing by messy ""Hurly Burly"" (i.e., a masturbatory film loaded with drunken ramblings and philosophical discussions on the endless minutiae of life) turned into something so much more.  That is, a finely tuned character study and a neat little suspense piece.
Ben Kingsley justifiably gets most of the credit and press; it's a huge performance.  His Don Logan is a terribly showy part.  He's menacing, coiled like a cobra read to strike, busting veins from his forehead.  He's stark and rigid and frightening.  He's charismatic and literate.  He's childish.  He's supremely confident.  But in terms of actual screen time, the role is really nothing more than a supporting part.  It's the tune you'll be humming as you leave the theatre, but there's much more to the musical score.
Ray Winstone as Gal is the one who puts the movie on his back and carries it from start to finish.  He is on screen in nearly every scene, and does a wonderfully understated job.  He's tanned to a crisp, paunchy, and nearly bleached blonde from his time in the Spanish nirvana.  But his anxiety is palpable when Don Logan shows up.  Winstone slouches, and shifts uneasily, generally showing his discomfort, while allowing the audience to feel it as well.  He does this remarkable thing with his eyes, where one squints tightly to show what used to be his power in his criminal days, while the other opens wide to show his fear.  It is a remarkable feat.  Winstone does yeomen's work shoring up the film's backbone.  It is a less showy role than the one Kingsley has, but ten times as important in terms of the overall film.
The other actors aren't given much to do, except for Ian McShane as an intimidating bossman with a penchant for dressing in black.  Cavan Kendall as Aitch, a guest at Gal's villa, is so unintelligible with his thick Cockney accent that I can't decide if he was an interesting character or just a verbose blowhard.  He nearly ruined the movie's first half, as I had to focus all my energy to try and understand what he was saying.  Gal's wife Deedee was pleasant enough to look at, but she is really only given one scene in which to strut her stuff, and even then only briefly.  And her pregnant personal history is touched on lightly but left unexplored.
Director Jonathan Glazer has a fine touch, employing showy style only when needed to bring the audience in to the anxiety that Gal is feeling.  He does a fine job showing the Spanish locations as idyllic, lingering briefly but significantly over his vast army of visual motifs, and juxtaposing images from Gal's dreamlife with his waking life.  And what a dream life it is.  Needless to say, I am still trying to sort out the relevance of the anthropomorphized hare that stalks Gal's subconscious with menacing glee.  Normally I'm not a fan of dream sequences in movies (there should be enough in the characters' waking lives to keep me interested) but these were so oddly appealing and perplexing that I'm glad Glazer gave them a go.  And they allowed for one of the oddest endings I've seen at the movies in a while.
""Sexy Beast"" doesn't try to say too much, which is probably why it works so well.  Don't go in expecting your standard caper picture.  Rather, prepare to be surprised.  The film does well in confounding expectations, from the ridiculous opening twist to a story that ends up taking you places that you didn't expect to visit.  Well worth the trip, I'd say.",1014681600,3,3889,4.680412371134021
1673639,4,B00005V9KX,"Ben Kingsley deservedly got an Academy Award nomination as a hit man with ADD in this unusual and darkly comic thriller.
Ray Winstone plays Gal, a retired hit man that is ordered by Don Logan (Kingsley) to do one more job. When Gal expresses reservations about it, Logan refuses to take no for an answer. What follows is a test of wills between Logan and members of Gal's party.
The story has plenty of twists and turns with a few surprises. If you're into crime films and not put off my on-screen violence, this is a must see. If you're not, you'll probably want to see something a bit tamer.
Overall, a great movie for crime fans. It's also very funny. The ending must be seen to be believed.",1013558400,,694,4.387596899224806
1673650,3,B00005V9KX,"Sure, it's fun seeing Ghandi go psycho, and the film has its dramatic and comedic moments. Nonetheless, this film manages to build little suspense or interest, and the film's climax had come and gone before I even knew it. Overall, this movie feels like a cut-rate Tarantino or Guy Ritchie film, lacking the narrative flair and complexity of their best films. Sexy Beast has nothing new to add to the British gangster genre except for Kingsley's memorable performance.",1010188800,2,468,5.012820512820513
1673651,5,B00005V9KX,"Don't let the title mislead you, this is a tough and harrowing film for which Sir Ben Kingsley was nominated for an Oscar in the recent ceremonies.  It is stylishly directed and executed and stands as one of the best gangster films made in recent years.
The plot revolves around a bank heist and involves bringing the film's central character out of his comfortable retirement for one last job. Unfortunately when he refuses to risk his liberty and return to work with his old partners in crime tensions mount to murderous effect.
As well as an excellent script and exciting cinematography what makes this film so special is the outstanding performance by Ray Winstone, Ben Kingsly and Ian McShane. These may be new names to many but they are outstanding actors capable of harrowing levels of intensity easily on a par with De Niro and Pesci.
I recommend this film very highly; it is riveting viewing even after repeated exposures and Ben Kingsly's performance as ""Don Logan"" gives us one of the nastiest screen villains to emerge in recent years.",1003276800,3,1047,4.816666666666666
1673652,5,B00005V9KX,"I was loving this film all the way through, non-stop gangster style! I have always thought Ray Winstone was the 'Main Man' of cockney gangster films ( remember 'Love, honour and obey', 'Nil by mouth') and teamed up with Ben Kingsley you can't go wrong.
As a retired gangster living in the Costa da sol he's got it all beautiful wife ( Amanda Redman) beautiful house, beautiful weather, until one day his past catches up with him,Ben Kingsley as the blast from the past. I don't want to go on about the film as it worth watching it for yourself to see just how hard it is to say 'no'. The tension just explodes off the screen once Ben Kingsley is on the scene, and it has to be said that Kingsley is so convincing as Don that you actually start hating him from the moment his name is mentioned. So much so you want to kill the man yourself! Ian Mcshane has a small role, I have never really liked him but he pulls this one off quite well. You can't go wrong with this, top acting, top dialogue, top notch plot! The title doesn't do this much justice, but it is definately one of the best of the British, highly underated. Get your dose of cockney gangsters because I did, and was loving every minute of it.

1673653,4,B00005V9KX,"There is a lot of laugh value in having Ben Kingsley--he's Gandhi, after all--play a vicious mobster.  But what sustains this very interesting film is its brutal energy and intensity.
The cast is superb down to the smallest part.  The film concerns a retired mobster, Gal (Ray Winstone) who is dragged back into the game one more time by Don Logan (Kingsley), a mobster who is very much still in the game and who, similar to Don Corleone, makes Gal an offer that he can't refuse.
The most interesting part of the movie is not the heist (although I enjoyed this part of the film), but the will-he, won't-he momentum leading up to it.  Just how convincing is Don Logan?  And does he win in all this?  The answer to the first question is VERY effective--Kingsley is a profanity-spewing, intensely coiled monster.  I won't answer the second--you'll just have to see it for yourself.
This is a great, intense film (a first film, directed by a former music video director).  It's loud, brash and occasionally brutal, but there are also moments of quiet tenderness between Gal and his wife, a former porn star (who is thus berated by Logan).  It is, in short, a powerhouse of a film, well worth eight bucks.
A couple of warnings--I had a very tough time understanding the Cockney dialect for the first ten minutes or so.  The film is loaded with bad language and a little bit of nasty violence (although the worst of it occurs offscreen).",997660800,6,1431,4.624505928853755

1673655,4,B00005V9KX,"After all the dross produced in the name of the post-Lock Stock British gangster film industry at last a good movie has been made: Jonathan Glazer's Sexy Beast. (The only other exceptions would be Gangster No. 1 and Guy Ritchie's own highly Lock Stock-esque Snatch).
From the brilliant opening scene to the last Sexy Beast is littered with masterful surrealistic touches. Although Ray Winstone gives a career best performance as Gary - the retired gangster who just wants to be left alone in his utopian Mediterranean idyll, it is true Ben Kingsley somewhat steals the show. As Don he is as hilarious as he is terrifying. In a unique performance which owes nothing De Niro or Pesci or indeed anything I've seen him play before (certainly a far cry from Gandhi!) Kingsley illuminates every scene he is in as a monster of cockney menace. British TV star Ian McShane is also convincingly malevolent as the ambidextrous Teddy Bass and James Fox also shines in a fleeting appearance.
Unlike so many British directors Glazer is genuinely cinematic - using the screen to the full, particularly in the opening sequence. He is certainly a talent to watch even if Sexy Beast made less of a splash commercially than hoped.
One quibble - like Grosse Point Blank and Boston Kickout, Sexy Beast is lumbered with an inappropriate and poorly chosen name. But don't be put off - if you want a Brit gangster flick in the spirit of Get Carter or The Long Good Friday then this is for you.",995846400,10,1469,4.719844357976654
1673656,5,B00005V9KX,"But then I haven't seen them all.  Now that I have your attention...from the opening notes of The Stranglers' ""Peaches"" playing on the soundtrack in the first scene, this movie grabbed me by the throat and didn't let go.  Other reviewers have given you the plot.  There are a couple of things that jumped out at me while watching this movie.  First, it is cinematic!  It is beautiful to watch.  Each scene is carefully composed--not the usual TV-style mere framing of people speaking or doing something  we so often see today.  Second, it didn't fall prey to the Hollywood sinkhole of trying to throw a plot around young, sexy, thin people who look nothing like anyone you know.  The women in this film are not thin, not young, but are able to radiate sexuality and power.  The male supporting actors as well contribute mightily to the power of Ben Kingsley's character.  Hey, don't they call this stuff ""acting?""  Well, it's done brilliantly by every actor in this movie.  Third, ""Sexy Beast"" manages to be menacing AND funny.  I wasn't sure if it was a thriller or a black comedy.  And I don't care!  I loved it!  Go see it if you like movies that are just a bit outside.",995587200,10,1173,4.535885167464115
1673657,2,B00005V9KX,"The critics did it this time.  This was decent film on the note that it contained all of the different aspects needed to create a great film, but it lacked continuous flow.  Before I saw Sexy Beast I read the critics reviews on how this movie was compared to some of Guy Richie's films such as Snatch and Lock, Stock, and two smoking barrels.  This film doesn't come close to the imaginative mind of Guy Richie.  Sexy Beast isn't even on the same wave length.  That was fault number one.  Since I was over hyped and expecting a lot more from this, all I can give Sexy Beast is 2 stars.",995414400,3,585,4.225225225225225
1673658,5,B00005V9KX,"Is 'Sexy Beast' drama or comedy?  It doesn't matter, really, because it has a whole lot of both.  Directed by Jonathan Glazer (a rising director of Guiness beer commercial fame), what makes this movie engrossing is the mentally (and sometimes physically) abusive relationship between retired criminal Gal (Ray Winstone) and the notorious Don Logan (Ben Kingsley).  The entire first act foreshadows what's to come, and the sense of fear and dread, balanced by an ever-diminishing feeling of whimsy, is almost tangible.
This is a film that's worthwhile if only for the acting.  Ben Kingsley's role is quite a departure from the benevolent, fatherly figures he's played in 'Gandhi' and the more recent 'AI'.  He is, quite simply, stunning in this movie - he takes a character that everyone hates beyond words, who is so evil, crude, and determined, and makes him into one of the most powerful villains I've ever seen.  I can't remember the last time I *hated* a character so much (but in a good way).  Of course, Kingsley has a lot to play off with Ray Winstone's understated performance.  Winstone balances Kingsley's obnoxious character; he quietly wares through the mental torture his character must endure.  The cast of 'Sexy Beast' is incredible.
This isn't a movie for everyone... there are some very dark and violent moments, some sincerely funny moments, and at times the movie is a bit bizarre.  I have to hand it to Jonathan Glazer, though, for making a movie that takes some artistic risks with an unconventional approach that, in my opinion, really pays off.",995241600,18,1567,4.969348659003831
1673659,2,B00005V9KX,"I sat between my dad and his lover and speculated that my dad was paying more attention to the distracting popcorn muncher in front of us, and his lover completely rivited by the brash, senory defunct soundtrack.  I tuned in as convenient for the first 60 minutes.  Certainly, our hero Gal (Ray Winston), received an entranced and mesmorized response, as I felt attracted to him, yet simultaneously I was trying to remember how to spell the word troglodyte.  I received Gal's profound love and respect for ex-stripper girlfriend deedee with awe, as well as a glowing, perhaps moist jealousy. Our young, quasi-mute savior eased and weaved a calm, omnipresence throughout the film. This young man was familiarly fluid, and the pieces fell into there quadrants with the entrance of Kingsley.  The two men silently, and maybe even unknowingly, juxtaposed each others language, style, and presence. The young man offered a ripe rendition of the lanquid, benevolent, wise, systematic presence Kingsley is so campable of portraying. Meanwhile Kingsley's character (Logan) was ravenously beating the confines of acceptable social behavior, and you sense the utter strength of Kingsley's years of work. All of this said, I was still looking around the theatre, trying to identify the number of speakers in the theatre.
As Kingsley's unforgiving nature forces the loveable Gal into an ify situation, you fear for his life and relate to the pending pain deedee will inevitably suffer.....and suddenly POOF!!! you leave the theatre, you find out your dad loved it and his lover hated it, you're hellbent on making vomiting noises anytime someone brings up the soundtrack, you know Kingsley's life has been worthwhile, and you pray to hear that ""I love you like a rose loves rain water"" from the lips of someone as solid as our hero.",994896000,3,1820,5.076923076923077
