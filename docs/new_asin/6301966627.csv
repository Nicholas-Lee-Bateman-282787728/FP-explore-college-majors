406062,2,6301966627,"The story of Italian priests hiding Jews in the Chapel of St. Francis and Cloister of St. Clare should have been given better treatment than this poorly done film.
Slashed by almost an hour from its original release, Cross plays a young priest asked by Bishop James Mason to hide some Jews in the monastery and cloister at Assisi. He does, while making friends with thoughtful Nazi Maximilian Schell, as the town commandant. Jews are almost discovered, the war ends, everyone gets a little mention about what happened to them at the end of the film.
The film's pace here is dull. The film is nothing more than Nazi extras asking for identification papers and Cross looking like the cat that ate the canary. I half expected him to wink at the camera everytime a Nazi goose stepped into frame. Cross also often forgets his Italian accent. Mason's idea of an Italian accent is to add an ""uh"" syllable at the end of every word, such as ""We-uh must-uh help-uh the-uh Jews-uh."" Most of his speeches are completely devoid of understanding, I thought I was listening to pig latin.
The Jews here are not shown as victims so much as that they have been inconvenienced by World War II. They do not come across as stoic and bold, but spoiled and complaining. In one embarassing scene, Cross, loved by all Jews who meet him, does a magic trick, compliments a painting, and comforts Jews like he is the activities director at an adult day care facility.
Maximilian Schell comes off best as the Nazi officer torn between his obligation to the Third Reich and his upbringing as a Catholic. Not enough of his inner turmoil was explored.
The film also features a horrendous soundtrack that sounds like bits and pieces of other war films just thrown into the sound mix. There are a couple of battle scenes, one with obvious stock footage, but this is not good.
""The Assisi Underground"" was made by the guys at the old Cannon Group studio, and that was the first mistake if you are familiar with their product. I cannot recommend this film.
This is rated (PG) for gun violence and mild profanity.",1022630400,15,2076,4.6287262872628725
406063,4,6301966627,"Although not filled with hi-tech footages and action packed scenarios, The Assisi Underground is based on a small group of Catholic monasteries and  convents in Italy that forms an underground railroad that only rivals  Harriet Tubman's Underground Railroad of the 19th Century.
Ben Cross  plays a young catholic priest who shows us through his eyes the struggle to  keep Italian Jews at bay from the clutches of the Nazi regime that has  infiltrated Italy.  His ease and care of his charges is charming and  thoughtfully played.  The young priest finds a godsend through a colonel in  the German army who is also a humanitarian, and in seeming unknowing ways  helps the priest execute his mission.
Slow at times, this film integrates  real WWII film and newspaper clippings to keep time with the events of  WWII.  Ben Cross's performance speaks multitudes of the anxiety and  anticipation of the Third Reich's actions during its occupation of  Italy.

Not all WWII Germans were bad. In Assisi we find an officer who was a devout Catholic. He protected the friar from one Nazi in particular. Heart warming and beautiful.

406299,5,6301966627,"I had first purchased this as a video long ago, and was elated to see that Amazon was offering the dvd version. Because this is such an excellent film, I wanted to make sure I wouldn't lose it--as can easily happen with a video tape. The film is the story of how a simple Franciscan friar, under orders from his bishop, was able to shelter and provide counterfeit documents for a number of Italian Jews during the Nazi occupation of Italy.  Among these Jews, was a certain professor who was being urgently sought by the Nazis, because the professor's knowledge of cutting edge technology could give the Germans an important military atvantage over the Allies. The film features movie legends James Mason, Maximillian Schell, Ben Cross and Irene Pappas. Really great film, and best of all, it's TRUE!",1352332800,8,799,4.7898550724637685
406300,5,6301966627,"This movie, The Assisi Underground, is actually based on the true story of how Jewish refugees were hidden by the Catholic church in Italy during WW2.  The writing and the layout on film is excellent, as is the acting.  Ben Cross does a great job of playing the young priest in here and the other actors deliver excellent perfomances in it. You MUST watch it to the end to get the rest of this story so don't turn it off when the end music starts playing! This movie is about a very dark period in World History and delivers the light at the end of the tunnel. It is well worth your investment--especially to use in a History class!",1289952000,7,632,4.302521008403361

406302,4,6301966627,"""The Assisi Underground"" is a 1984 feature that stars Ben Cross as a determined and courageous Catholic priest who risks his own life to rescue thousands of persecuted Jews fleeing the Nazis in WW II Italy. If I'm not mistaken, this is a fact-based story and also stars James Mason and Maximillian Schell. Another movie that also dealt with a Catholic priest aiding Jews and POWs during WW II in Italy was 1983's ""The Scarlet and the Black"" starring Gregory Peck as a heroic Vatican priest and Christopher Plummer as the ruthless Nazi officer-in-charge.

I watched this on television many years ago and found it a riveting, albeit slow-moving feature. I do wish they would reissue this on DVD so I can add it to my collection of Holocaust-themed dramas.",1240444800,12,753,4.792307692307692

7819394,5,6301966627,"This interest film is about the efforts of a the Asissi clergy to help shelter and protect Italian jews during WWII.  Ben Cross and James Mason play real life priest and bishop who concoct an almost full hardy plan to hide Jews in the monasteries and convents of Assisi, Italy the home of St. Francis.  Irene Pappas is the stern and terrifying mother superior who allows (gasp) men into her cloister and Maximilian Schell is the religious  German commander who sees nothing.  Filmed in Assisi it benefits from location filming.  The film is a gentle reminder of the good that people can do.  One caution the film has not been restored and it shows wear but it certainly is watchable but not up the standards of more commercial films.

As long as my lungs have breath - I KNOW what I experienced personally, while living amidst the history - I shall never forget, and, it is never ever far from my memory.

It's like actual Poor Clares are in the movie which I know they're not as the nuns are cloistered and wouldn't be in a movie.  But you can tell a big effort was made to make the movie accurate.
