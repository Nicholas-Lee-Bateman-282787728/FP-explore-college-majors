2708806,4,B000LE16W6,"These 13 hour long episodes were actualy part of a series of specials titled ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" that originaly aired approx once a month on CBS between 1957 - 1960. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz had tired of the weekly grind of filming a series after 7 years and wanted to cut back on their work load the result was this series of specials. Like the original series the show also featrued William Frawely and Vivian Vance as Fred and Ethel Mertz and of course Keith ""Little Ricky"" Thibodeaux. These shows took place in the Connecticut setting where the regular series left off although in some episodes the quartet did travel to such places as Mexico and Japan among others. The first of these episodes titled ""Lucy Takes a Cruise To Havana"" originaly aired as an 1 hr 15 min show, something unheard off back then. This was due to the fact that after filming was complete the episode ran over the normal hour long show (approx 50 mins with out commercials)Desi did not want to cut anything out so he convinced CBS to push  the show that followed it back by 15 mins and CBS agreed. The syndicated copy and the one on the CBS Video Library collection are the edited version. I am Happy that these episodes are also being made available and look forwrd to really completing my ""Lucy"" collection. From what I've read it looks like Paramount Home Video is giving this collection the same love and respect as they did the original ""I Love Lucy"".",1166227200,78,1446,4.540229885057471

2708859,4,B000LE16W6,"Essentially a continuation of the familiar ""I Love Lucy"" series, THE LUCY-DESI COMEDY HOUR (originally ""The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show"" presented by Ford and later Westinghouse) extended the ""Lucy"" universe for three additional seasons.  The hour-long episodes were more or less showcases for Lucy and a revolving door of sparkling guest stars (very much like the fourth season of ""I Love Lucy"" set in California).  Desi Arnaz had been campaigning CBS, for years, to extend ""Lucy"" to an hour-long format, and the newly-revamped show gave him even greater creative control, with Desi in the director's chair for many of the episodes.

Because both Lucy and Desi were hands-on creative forces at their company Desilu, incredibly busy overseeing and working on many shows in which they didn't necessarily appear, the work schedule of THE LUCY-DESI COMEDY HOUR was organised so that the pair would only be obligated to film just a few episodes (or specials) per year.  The first two seasons comprised of 5 episodes each; by the final year this had been reduced to just three episodes.  According to sources there was to have been at least a fourth year of specials planned, but the daily working relationship of Ball and Arnaz was rapidly deteriorating - Ball filed for divorce the day after the broadcast of ""Lucy Meets the Moustache"", the final special from the third year.

With a few exceptions, the stories take place at the Ricardos' home in Westport, Connecticut.  Lucy still meddles and schemes along with best pal, Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance), but the interplay with Ricky (Desi Arnaz) and Fred (William Frawley) is somewhat diminished.  Scripts often have Ricky and Fred away in New York, attending to the nightclub or checking up at the apartment building, respectively.  This lessens the magic of the original ""I Love Lucy"" flavour which hinged heavily on the interplay of the 'Fabulous Foursome'.  Perhaps tensions were becoming too much of an issue - in addition to the collapse of Ball's and Arnaz's marriage, it's no secret that Vivian and Bill Frawley weren't the best of chums off-screen.

The series opens with a spectacular ""prequel"" story, detailing how Lucy and Ricky met in Havana.  On a cruiseliner we find Lucy McGillicuddy and her best pal, fellow secretary Susie MacNamara (Ball's dear friend Ann Sothern - reprising her role from the sitcom ""Private Secretary"").  Also on-board are the honeymooning Mertzes (Fred has hair!)  in addition to dreamy Rudy Vallee.  Of course, we know that Lucy will return to the States with Ricky in tow, but the charm in how their unlikely romance takes off is still a delight to see.

Divine Tallulah Bankhead becomes the Ricardos' newest neighbour in ""The Celebrity Next Door"" in which Lucy forces Ethel and Fred to act as reluctant domestics and attempts to upstage Ms Bankhead in a PTA benefit show.  In ""Lucy Makes Room for Danny"", the entire cast of ""Make Room for Daddy"" crosses over into Lucy-Land.  When the Ricardos' are called back to California so that Ricky can appear in a film, they lease out their home to the Williams clan (Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright and Rusty Hamer), but things turn nasty when the trip is cancelled and the Ricardos' find themselves homeless!

Feeling stuck in a rut with her country housewife role, Lucy re-enters the glamorous world of New York showbiz in ""Lucy Wants a Career"", becoming the co-host for a morning TV show with Paul Douglas.  It seems to be a dream come true, until Lucy grows tired of the constant early mornings and a schedule which leaves little time for her family - but how will she manage to escape from her iron-clad contract with the sponsor?

The gang jets off to Japan in ""The Ricardos' Go to Japan"", where Lucy and Ethel strike up a friendship with their hotel neighbour - none other than Bob Cummings - and launch a crazy plan to buy an authentic pearl necklace, culminating in the pair going undercover as geishas in a male-only Geisha House!  Even in B&W you may notice Lucy's eyes towards the end of this episode, which appear red and swollen from crying despite Lucy being almost buried under an elaborate costume of traditional Japanese kimono, makeup and Zolb wig; and Desi's voice often sounds worn and raspy.  This was to be the penultimate show for the group and, I'm sure, tempers were fraying.  The final show, ""Lucy Meets the Moustache"" has Lucy disguised as a chauffeur to TV comedian Ernie Kovacs and his wife, Broadway star Edie Adams.  Ms Adams was asked to bring along a song of her own choosing to perform on the show, which turned out to be ""That's All"".  It was a personal favourite for Adams and her husband, but she had no idea that the song was to have a heartbreaking double meaning for Lucy and Desi - the show (and their marriage) was over.

2708884,5,B000LE16W6,"Any Lucy fan knows that the final 13 one hour specials that ran as ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" is a must have to complete the saga of Lucy & Ricky & Fred & Ethel.  The 13 hour episodes ran from September 1957 through April 1960.  My favorite episodes are Talulah Bankhead, Paul Ford and Danny Thomas episodes but all 13 episodes are a great reminder of what a great acting ensemble ""I Love Lucy"" was and how talented the writers were.  There will never be a show like the original Lucy show.  P.S.  I suggest to everyone to go out and buy seasons 1 thru five of ""The Lucy Show"" and ""Here's Lucy,""  these series both hold up very well today and show how Lucille Ball earned her title as the Queen of Comedy & Television.",1340928000,,719,4.25
2708885,3,B000LE16W6,"""I Love Lucy"" is, unquestionably, one of the greatest television shows ever produced.  The quartet of Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, and William Frawley were comedic perfection and the series' writers kept the foursome in some of the most hilarious situations on the small screen.

Following season six, Desi and Lucy, already struggling with a rocky marriage, lessened their work load as performers by turning the weekly show into a series of hour-long specials, complete with exotic locales (some real locations while others were on the back lot) and some big-name guest stars.

And there lies the weaknesses of the three-year-long version of ""I Love Lucy.""  As hard as they tried, the Arnazes were showing the strain of the attempt to keep their marriage alive: while in the earlier seasons, they looked like a married couple, in these seasons, they seemed as though they were acting.

The shows seemed padded, too.  The 30-minute format worked because it made the writers realize that the tale had to be told in that length of time and they crammed as much humor and plot that they could.  The hour-long time limit seemed to be filled with prolonged musical numbers and a bit too much of the Lucy ""schtick.""  One example of the latter is a prolonged sequence with Lucy, dressed in matador garb, in the bullfighting ring. It drones on and on and just lacks the humor of the classic episodes like ""Lucy Makes a Television Commercial"" or the one where she meets William Holden and ignites her nose.  These were funny...and only a half-hour long.

The guest stars also date the show.  There is no denying that they were big stars, but on the show they were basically playing themselves and can, for the most part, be appreciated by baby boomers and older audiences.

Of the episodes with these entertainers, the best one features Broadway legend Tallulah Bankhead as the Ricardos new neighbor in the fittingly titled ""The Celebrity Next Door.""  Bankhead is a riot as she matches Ball line for line and laugh for laugh, revealing a comedic talent that many - sans theater goers - were probably unaware that she had.

The DVD's themselves are a crisp remastering.  So good are they that in the ""Lucy Goes to Sun Valley"" episode, the strings supporting Ball as she is spun around are clearly seen.

The extras are worthwhile, especially the ""episode"" made for the show's sponsor: Westinghouse.

For ""I Love Lucy"" fans, the last seasons are necessary to complete the series and that makes them worth the purchase.

But, as implied earlier, ""bigger is not necessarily better.""",1338336000,,2580,4.864988558352403

2708887,5,B000LE16W6,"Loved all the hour long episodes and seeing all the other famous celebrities that I'm sure viewed it as a priviledge to be on the show.  So sad when I was watching the last episode, knowing there wasn't anymore.  I'm going to move on to the Lucy Show and hope to enjoy that series too! But won't be the same without Desi. Oh well.",1327363200,,330,4.140625
2708898,3,B000LE16W6,"This was the last season/set of I Love Lucy I added to my collection. I have to say, though it is a must-have for Lucy fans like me, if you're considering it for your first season of this show on DVD, reconsider and try seasons 2-5. The only episode I really enjoyed was ""Lucy Hunts Uranium"", and that was because I love watching car chases. :) But over all the humor was getting stale and the characters were getting old. That said, it was the worst possible idea to bring in a celebrity on each show, because it sucked even more life out of the Ricardos and Mertzes. And the fact that Lucy kept on walking in on Bob Cummings while he was in his bathtub (in ""The Ricardos Go to Japan"") was a little over the top for a family show. I don't know about you, but if I were a parent (I'm only eleven) I wouldn't let kids under six or seven watch that. And when they had more stable trips that lasted the better part of the season, it was fun to watch, but Japan, Mexico, Vermont, Idaho... It just got a little overwhelming. So overall my least favorite out of all the seasons, but still a must have for collecters or fans.

Keep watching old classic shows,

2708902,3,B000LE16W6,"If you are expecting this series to be a smooth transition from, or continuation of, I Love Lucy - the amazing, long enduring 30 minute sitcom - it is not. The charm and chemistry of the original series has vanished, the larger set and locale changes seem to erode the intimacy offered by the small sets of the original Ricardo's apartment, and the Tropicana club. Lucille Ball's image remake - new hipper, sexier hair style, makeup and clothing - is more reminescent of her later post-Desi TV characters and series, she no longer comes across as the zany housewife of the original series. Perhaps Lucy tired of looking like a housewife and at 40+ with marital woes was having a mid-life crisis and felt the need to dress up. Whatever the reason, Lucy Ricardo seems to have gotten lost, even the familiar facial expressions seem fewer and further between and the age in her face becomes obvious during this period as well.

As for Desi, he very often looks exhausted, overweight, hungover, or disinterested. Clearly running Desilu was his top priority and having to continue to play Ricky in the specials to help fund Desilu's incredible growth seems to have been a burden. Further, there seems to be more bickering in the scripts between the two and its delivered with too much animosity and little love as in the original series. Perhaps part of the problem is that the original executive producer & head writer Jess Oppenheimer is long gone by this point and his gifted staff of Bob Carroll and Madeline Pugh are reduced to story consultants in this series. Of course, the toxicity of the Arnaz's marriage and relationship by this point, could not have benefitted the work.

Vivian Vance and William Frawley transitioned far better, but the storyline seems forced, the former landlords now reversing roles and renting Lucy and Ricky's guest house. And the emphasis on guest star focus seemed to significantly reduce their roles.

The extras on the videos are quite interesting, however, and watching these DVD's will give you a sense of completion as an historian of I Love Lucy. After watching these you'll appreciate how magical catching lightning in a bottle with the original series was.",1304812800,4,2194,4.8766756032171585

2708924,5,B000LE16W6,"What was I thinking?...that I was the only series fan who noticed the missing footage from ""The Celebrity Next Door"", the best of the Lucy-Desi comedy hours? Silly me. (Good thing I have an uncut copy on VHS in a drawer somewhere. Take that, DVD-Slicer.) The set itself does get a good overall review though, because of the content of the program.  These shows have the freshness of the Connecticut house set, and some other neighbors (Frank Nelson, Mary Jane Croft, et al) to add to the Ricardo-Mertz mix. Little Ricky is a bit older and is given more to do----while not exactly an award-winning actor, the kid is believable and in his occasional duets, performing with Desi Arnaz, you'd swear they were really father and son. At times, the show is a bit more labored than the other seasons----Lucy seems a bit tired and less the devoted wife, but by then the Arnaz marriage was unfortunately taking its toll on the talented stars. However,the sheer professionalism of cast and crew keeps it entertaining, always. The roster of guest stars is impressive--Danny Thomas, Betty Grable, Fred MacMurray, many more who were big names at the time. ""Celebrity"", sadly, does have some footage needlessly (there are no commercials!)removed, which fogs the plot a bit---but it's a great show nonetheless. Bette Davis was originally cast to play the star next door, and it would have been interesting to see her spin on the role...she could be funny when she wanted to be. Due to an injury,she was replaced by the redoubtable Tallulah Bankhead---ultimately a wise choice, because if Davis could be funny, Bankhead could be hysterical. Despite her penchant for showing up soused at rehearsals, Tallu turns in a flawlessly comic performance--totally in tune with the mood, and matching the wacky red head scene for scene. If the ""I Love Lucy "" series had to come to an end, this was a fitting way to go out...the whole 9 years largely the result of Lucy's unique talent, and Desi's vision and hard work.",1267488000,2,1990,4.835777126099707

It seems to me that for the most part, Lucy and Desi were just going through the motions.  It seemed really forced and I must agree with other reviews, the hour long format seemed far too long.  30-45 minutes tops would have been about right.  They stretched it out with nonsense skits and far fetched plots.  It was an insult to their talent, wasn't it?

Bill Frawley and Vivian Vance were wonderful, as always, but the marital strain showed between Lucy and Desi.  Lucy looked as if she aged ten years after her new hair-do and the clothes she wore were grandma-like.  I even noticed the changes the house went through, like the weird floral curtains?? and the missing china cabinet and what about the view into the living room from the kitchen - where did the hallway come from suddenly??  The glass windows are missing and the back-drops move when the actors walk past them!  These are big things.... maybe they thought nobody would notice??  I guess they didn't count on DVD sales let alone multiple re-runs!

No, these shows were thrown together, shoving TV and film stars in to compensate for the lack of quality.  Such a shame.  I'm the biggest I Love Lucy fan there is, but I'm also realistic.  What I'd love is the complete set of The Lucy Show with Vivian Vance - the black and white series.  Now those were good!",1210291200,10,1515,4.551851851851852

What is also special about The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour is that they are a great deal better than the half hour I Love Lucy series.  While there were some classic moments in the I Love Lucy six seasons, the Lucy Desi Comedy Hour, which consists of 13 episodes from 1957 through 1960, is far superior.  Far more time and care was taken in the Comedy Hour series with more guests playing significant parts of each episode, better and more realistic sets, better costumes, and a lot more music.

2708953,5,B000LE16W6,"I suspect some of us might start sounding like Captain Queeg with an obsession for missing strawberries, but I have fine-tooth-combed the ""Celebrity Next Door"" episode, and nowhere can I find Tallulah explaining that she is allergic to strawberries, or even more specifically that she gets hives from them. Perhaps Larry C, who thinks we ""forgot to take our meds,"" could tell us who manufactured the copy he has, and exactly where in the episode that line occurs (and while he's at it, he might want to look up the word ""ingratiating"").

We know from the reaction of everyone on stage when Tallulah tastes the strawberry sauce (at 45 minutes, 48 seconds into the episode) that they are all aware of her allergy. They must have known about it by the point at 38 minutes, 30 seconds, when Lucy offers Tallulah a peace offering of home-made jam, saying, ""You'll be glad to know it's blackberry and not strawberry--that way you don't have to worry about getting hives."" But there was no previous occurrence of the word ""hives,"" and the only two previous mentions of strawberries are at 14 minutes, 16 seconds, when Lucy is planning her menu with Ethel (and Tallulah is not even present), and later (23 minutes, 40 seconds) at the dinner, when Fred walks in with the pie mashed all over his chest and Lucy screams, ""My strawberry pie!"" That would be the logical place for Tallulah to explain that it doesn't matter, since she is allergic to strawberries. Instead, exactly 16 seconds later, there is a sudden and awkward-looking cut just before Ethel says, ""At these prices, we should have unlimited bickering privileges!"" and storms into the kitchen with Fred. Perhaps the original film got damaged, and they had to make a little splice to cover it, but something has definitely been tampered with, and I'm not referring to my meds.

This is the tiniest of quibbles, and doesn't really diminish the value of this set, which I heartily recommend. I had owned the complete half-hour episodes; how satisfying to know that I now have I Love Lucy (virtually) complete!",1193702400,,2058,4.8107344632768365

Watching these hour long episodes of Lucy's antics was much more entertainment than going out or anything else could have been! I recorded them all on VHS, but unfortunately no longer have a VCR. I am very happy that they are now available on DVD!
What can I say about it that has not been said already? All 13 episodes are hilarious, as always. They all had famous guest appearances by big stars of the time like Maurice Chevalier, Tallulah Bankhead, Fernando Lamas, Red Skelton, Milton Berle, Rudy Vallee, Ann Southern, Betty Grable, Ernie Kovacs, and many more!
I am more than happy with this DVD set from Paramount. Not only are all 13 episodes included uncut, there are also many extras, including specials like color footage of on-the-set filming or original cast commercials.

I am happy they released it on DVD, just not what they title it. If you own the item, or look closely at the picture, it will say ""The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour"" in small print. Also, I do not understand why they made the box small, so, look at the I Love Lucy sets, they are 4 DVD sets and the box is HUGE, this set in 4 DVD'S, but the box is so small.

2708965,5,B000LE16W6,"After six successful seasons of I LOVE LUCY, Desi wanted to slow down and try other things.  But, since I LOVE LUCY was such a huge hit, CBS wanted to keep it going.  So they reached a compromise.  They would do three or four hour long episodes of the show for the next few years instead of the weekly half hour shows.  The resulting show has had many names over the years, but not matter what you call it, it is funny.

The set up is exactly the same.  In fact, it feels like we never left.  The Ricardos and the Mertzes are living in Connecticut.  But Ricky's band's appearances lets them travel the world.  And they also meet up with all kinds of famous people.  That's right; every one of these thirteen episodes features a famous guest star or two.  And you just know that when Lucy gets around a celebrity, chaos ensues.

There are several highlights to the set.  ""The Celebrity Next Door"" is hysterical as Lucy tries to get new neighbor Tallulah Bankhead to help with the PTA benefit.  Later on, she goes the same route with Milton Berle and tries to help him finish his book.  When Paul Douglas starts a new morning show, Lucy lands a job as his ""Girl Friday.""  But does she really want a job?  And a USO show in San Diego leads to all kinds of border crossing problems that end with Lucy fighting a bull.

About the only show here I don't like is ""Lucy Goes to Alaska.""  A long section is made up of a sketch that she does with comic Red Skelton.  It was funny for a while, but goes on too long.  And the rest of the plot just isn't that funny.

But that's the only low point.  The rest of the shows are wonderfully funny.  Any Lucy fan will laugh the entire way through them.

And this set is great as well.  The thirteen hour long shows are preserved on four discs.  And they look and sound great.  The special features are nothing new for the TV show, and that's not a bad thing.  We get information on the guest cast, and since I've never heard of some of these stars, that's great.  Additionally, we get the flubs, deleted scenes, and original opening and closing that were standard on the other sets.  For something different, we get the 40 minute sponsor presentation that Desilu studio did for new sponsor Westinghouse and some color home movies of the set from 1951.

2708984,3,B000LE16W6,"I completed my DVD collection with Seasons 7-9. They are not as good as the I Love Lucy episodes, but they are funny. I was disappointed with the approach that was taken with the menus. In the other Lucy DVDs, the stick figures are in black and white and on this DVD they've been made color and annoyingly so on the menu screen. Additionally, there are not the same chapter breaks that were on the previous DVDs. For example, if you are watching them straight through and you don't want to hear the opening you could skip it, which you can on this DVD but if you do, you miss some of the beginning of the episode. Additionally, the extras are a little thin. The producers show all the bits that were taken out in syndication for each episode and label them as ""lost footage"". Ok-- this is good, but these scenes are also in the episodes on the DVD. So that is kind of a rip off. But overall, it is good. There should be more about the production, but that is just my personal preference.",1177459200,7,987,4.283422459893048

2708986,3,B000LE16W6,"Hard-core _I Love Lucy_ fans will definitely want to add Seasons 7, 8 and 9 to their DVD collections. However, those who would like to purchase only one or two of the ""Lucy"" collections might want to avoid this offering and focus on the truly-great episodes in the series.

As of this writing, I have watched the contents of every disk in the _I Love Lucy_ DVD collections. The show got better and better over the first three years and, in my opinion, the series hit its peak between 1954 and 1955, with the Hollywood episodes contained in Seasons 4 and 5. By this time, the _I Love Lucy_ television show was running like a well-oiled machine. Desi Arnaz' three-camera technique was perfected and would become the industry standard. Writers Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll, Jr. had developed a style that perfectly complemented Lucille Ball's ingenious comic timing, flare for slapstick and hilarious facial expressions. The show was fresh and alive with great gags and consistently-funny dialogue.

It was in late 1954 that the Ricardos finally left their tiny New York brownstone apartment so that Ricky could do a screen test for ""Don Juan."" This hilarious epic went on for 27 episodes and began when Ricky came home with a brand new 1955 Pontiac convertible (180 horsepower with automatic transmission) that would transport him, Lucy, Fred and Ethyl to California. They stopped at a Cincinnati motel (this one had the levitating beds), Bent Fork, Tennessee (with Tennessee Ernie Ford and the Borden Twins singing 'Ricochet Romance', Amarillo, Texas and finally Albuquerque, New Mexico where Ethyl put on a solo singing act with the others doing outrageous comic pantomime routines behind her on stage. It was in these episodes that the first on-location scenes were shot.

After reaching Hollywood, the Arnaz A-list provided a wealth of Hollywood talent including Aaron Spelling, Eve Arden, William Holden (Lucy's straight man when she does her hilarious putty-nose bit), Bobby (the Phillip Morris bellboy, played by Bob Jellison), Sheila MacRae, Mrs. William Holden, Mrs. Van Heflin, Mrs. Forest Tucker, Allan Ladd, Richard Carlson, Hedda Hopper, Cornel Wilde, Rock Hudson, Harpo Marx, Richard Widmark and John Wayne. Finally, an especially funny episode takes place on the train trip home. Lucy finds plenty of reasons to keep pulling the emergency brake cord -- tossing passengers all over the place -- and she finally ends up capturing a jewel thief.

After the Hollywood episodes, the quality of the shows headed downhill as the Ricardos and the Mertzes took a trip to Europe in Season 5. Finally, the Ricardos and the Mertzes moved from New York City to Westport, Connecticut in Season 6, but even the addition of drum-virtuoso Little Ricky couldn't lift the lackluster scripts to the level of those from previous seasons. At the end of Season 6, the show was straining to be good, but the scripts were stale, the laughs were few and everyone was starting to look as tired and worn out as the half-hour show had become in its final year.

At the end of Season 6, _I Love Lucy_ was ready for retirement, so it clearly didn't need to be expanded into an hour-long format. Although the hour-long format did produce two noteworthy episodes, ""The Celebrity Next Door"" (originally meant for Bette Davis, but later written to showcase a surprisingly-hilarious performance by Tallulah Bankhead) and ""Lucy Goes To Mexico"" (featuring great comedy and musical numbers from Maruice Chevalier), the overall series had become nothing more than a worn out retread of its former glory.

Bottom Line: Others have already commented on the slapped-together look of the final _I Love Lucy_ collection and all of its missing footage. While the 13 episodes of Seasons 7, 8 and 9 aren't nearly as good as those from the _I Love Lucy_ heyday, they aren't all bad either. But the pace is sluggish, the gags are forced and the situations are unconvincing. These final episodes will primarily be of interest to Lucy fans who want to complete their collections. As for myself, I'm glad that I only rented them.",1176595200,12,4107,4.988321167883211

We were absolutely delighted to learn that the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hours would be released on DVD to complete the adventures of the Ricardos and the Mertzes; one does assume, however, coming from the same people, this set would be of the same quality as the previous I Love Lucy seasons.  Sadly, CBS apparently does not think their customers are worthy.

Yes, it DOES matter if they can't be bothered to reinsert three seconds of dialogue that would explain that Tallulah is allergic to strawberries.  Yes, it DOES matter that there is no explanation why the barroom floor in the western sequence of the Milton Burle episode is inexplicably covered in arrows that weren't there a second ago.

Further, the classic I Love Lucy menus from previous seasons have been replaced with what looks like bad South Park animation, and the episodes we have viewed thus far are truncated syndication rerun copies that visually appear to have been lifted from video tape rather than the original films.

Yes, we're very glad to have this set, particularly since TV Land has stopped airing classic TV shows, but there is no reason whatsoever for this price that CBS couldn't have devoted the care and effort into this set that made the previous I Love Lucy sets so wonderful.",1175731200,13,1303,4.820627802690583

It has also definitely been a treat to see the episodes in their entirety, as they should be shown, considering how infrequently (sadly enough) they are shown on regular TV these days.

The one episode with Mrs. Bankhead was funny. Who cares that we don't know why she's allergic to strawberries. It was still very funny. The problem is that people are never happy with anything. They need a reason to complain. I've seen a lot of old shows that look terrible. These look great for their age. They complete the series & that's all that's important!! I've read some reviews where people complain that Lucy didn't meet Ricky in Cuba or Lucy didn't meet the mertzes on the boat to Cuba well, If you watch many other episodes you will see that a lot of things changed as they went along. There is one episode where Lucy wins a race horse & she loves the horse. There is another episode with a horse when they are in England & she's terrified of the horse. That's the way they did things back then. I have the complete series of TAGS & belive me, they change the names of certain people throughout the entire series & one season has no laugh track in it at all so, enough complaining lets just enjoy the shows the way they are.

2709017,3,B000LE16W6,"For many of us, ""I Love Lucy"" has always been and will always be the epitome of what a comedy show should be. Lucy and her husband are charismatic people with lovable faults, and their best friends the Mertzes, make the show a joy to watch. The writing is always fresh, clever and perfectly in character with the players. Perhaps it is this show more than any other, that sums up the American lifestyle and way of thinking in the 1950's.

The 13 shows in this DVD set are remarkable for several reasons: the shows were twice as long as conventional Lucy shows, many of them were filmed on location, they featured well-known stars of the day such as Milton Berle, Tallulah Bankhead, Danny Thomas and others, and the writing was polished with years of experience. Most poignantly, they also signified the final breakup of the marriage of Lucille Ball to her husband Desi Arnaz.

The DVDs in this set have plenty of extra goodies, which is always great fun. The picture quality is sharp and clear.

I was watching the episode of where Lucy goes to Tijuana, Mexico, and she and Ethel are shopping for souvenirs. Suddenly, it dawned on me: the laugh track had been completely edited out. No laughter. Nothing. It was an eerie, unpleasant sensation.  Disgusted, I stopped watching the DVDs at that point.

Was it really necessary for CBS DVD to do this?

Lucille Ball was a stickler for acting in front of an audience, because the reactions heightened her sense of what was going over.  And I'm sure she would have hated this tampering with her work.

On the ""Racehorse"" episode, some dialogue in the scenes inside Lucy's house seemed to have artificial reverberation added, just to muck things up a bit for us.

When Lucille Ball first wanted to do this TV show with her real husband, CBS executives balked.

When she wanted to make her real-life pregnancy part of the show, CBS executives dragged their corporate feet.

When Desi wanted to make it an hour show, CBS executives didn't want to cooperate.

All artistic endeavor is dependent upon the artist who creates the work to be appreciated, and those (the fans)who do the appreciating, the ""co-creating"", if you will. The success of the work depends on both sides.

So now, we fans have bought these DVDs, wanting to see Lucy in all her magnificence......and that old arch-villain CBS is doing to us what they did to Lucy and Desi: not being forthright or above board about the whole thing, but throwing in a monkey wrench here and there, just to abuse their technological power.

Until now, I have only had my old ""Nick at Night"" tapes of these shows to watch, and I was going to throw them out.....but I won't.  At least the sound hasn't been screwed around with. I will be watching them a lot in the years to come.  CBS DVD had an opportunity here to make this a tribute worthy of the comedic legend who did so much to enhance the image of CBS as well as enrich them endlessly.....  What a tribute it could have been.

If Lucy Ricardo had bought this DVD set, she would probably fume: ""Honestly! What a bunch of sneaky stinkers!""

My sentiments exactly.",1174780800,11,3106,4.604355716878403
2709018,3,B000LE16W6,"First of all, I'm skeptical about this alleged I Love Lucy ""movie.""  One reviewer says it consists of 3 episodes from Season 1 (the weakest of the series, not counting this collection) with additional footage shot at the time.  This means that 75 minutes of this ""movie"" is material we've already seen, abetted by what sounds like the sort of negligible ""wrap around"" material written for the Christmas flashback episode, or for the re-airings of season one shows, while Ms. Ball recovered from the birth of Desi, Jr.  That material consisted mostly of Ricky, Fred or Ethel saying something along the lines of, ""Don't you remember?  We were all just sitting around having a quiet evening, when all of a sudden..."" and we're into the rerun.  I'm not holding out much hope for this so-called movie.

Additionally, having seen all of these episode before, I regret to say that most are not up to the standard of I Love Lucy.  In ""opening up"" the episodes (going on location, filming outdoors at Desilu and elsewhere) much of the footage was filmed without a studio audience present, and it's these episodes that suffer the most.  Ball worked best in front of a live audience, and deprived of one her timing is simply not as sharp.  Also, these episodes contain an egregious amount of ""canned"" laughter, something the original series succumbed to only once in 7 years (in ""Lucy Meets John Wayne,"" when the child playing Little Ricky couldn't be persuaded to perform on cue, and a concluding shot of him had to be filmed later, with the laughter inserted in post-production.)  Not using a pre-recorded laugh track was a point of pride on the original series, with producer Arnaz saying if he HAD used a laugh track, he'd never have had the nerve to let the laughs play out at the extended lengths that many of them did!  The fake laugh track diminishes a great deal of the wonderful spontaneity of the first six brilliant seasons.

The ""Trip To Havana"" episode rewrites and undermines previously established (and superior) I Love Lucy back-story.  Lucy and Ricky did not meet in Cuba.  They met in NYC, when Marion Strong invited Lucy to go ""on a blind date with a Cuban conga player.""  Ricky had arrived in the states long before, ""on an airplane... (with) thirteen musicians...""  (See ""Hollywood Anniversary"" and ""Lucy Writes A Novel"" respectively.)  It was also previously established that the Ricardos and the Mertzes had never encountered each other prior to living in the same building.  And as with many flashback episodes, it suffers from the fact that all the actors involved are clearly too old to be playing the ages they are being forced to play (including, most notably, Rudy Vallee), straining credibility to the limit.

That's not to say that there aren't gems here, there are.  While the writers have admitted that the Tallulah Bankhead episode (the first of the true one hour format shows) was really two separate, but sequential, half hour episodes (they hadn't quite gotten the hang of the new length yet) it remains closest in quality to the original series (despite it's being, as has been noted here, an oddly truncated version).  And Lucy's series of ""takes"" upon being discovered in bed with Danny Thomas are on a par with her ""Vita-meata-vega-min"" work.  She's not playing the comedy, she's a brilliant actress playing the moment-to-hysterical-moment truth of the situation (much like Mary Tyler Moore's funeral break up in ""Chuckles Bites The Dust"") and it's nothing short of perfection.  I can never resist watching it in slo-mo and marveling at the truth she brings to it.

But these moments of genius and inspiration are nowhere near as abundant as they were in Seasons 1 - 6, and surely the rapidly disintegrating marriage of the two leads could not have helped matters.  (Actress Carole Cook has described seeing Lucy in her white faced Geisha makeup, and noticing how it accentuated the fact that Lucy's eyes were bloodshot from her near constant, on-set weeping.)

This is a welcome addition to any true fan's collection (and in spite of my reservations, I am one).  Just don't buy this expecting another 13 hours of the show we all fell in love with -- it is simply not up to the same  standard.",1174694400,7,4224,4.821081830790568
2709019,5,B000LE16W6,"The combination of Ball, Arnaz, Frawley, and Vance is hard to beat (no has yet, IMO).  Add a special guest star such as Red Skelton or Milton Berle and you are enjoying classic comedy at its best.  Expect an older Lucy and Ricky, but after all, they were 50ish at the time.  The situations and resolutions are usually bizarre, contrived, and predictable, but they provide good, clean family fun for all generations.  My little grandchildren love to watch the antics of those fantastic four legendary actors.",1174694400,3,507,4.8604651162790695
2709020,5,B000LE16W6,"I am so thrilled to be able to add this to my collection, and with it complete ""I Love Lucy"" on DVD.  I have always held a special place in my heart for these episodes commonly called ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" (although they've gone by many names).

This collection is a must for all Lucy fans.  Even if you own them on VHS, upgrade!  The first episode is seen in its entirety for the first time since it first aired in 1957!  All the other episodes also have footage that was cut when the episodes were syndicated.  Unfortunately these are not added into the episodes, because Desilu edited the masters.  The quality of the cut footage is so inferior to the rest of the episodes that it would be jarring to have them inserted.  It is wonderful to get to see them in the Special Features though.  In some cases it answers some questions one might have about something in the episodes.

Gregg Oppenheimer and Tom Watson really have outdone themselves with this set.  The menus are even better than the previous ""I Love Lucy"" sets.  I was pleased to see that the packaging continued to match the previous sets though.

As far as I'm concerned the only problem with the sets has been that Paramount keeps rereleasing them in different packaging (meaning the first season -- which some people have purchased four different times).  I understand that Paramount will soon come out with a Complete Series package and those people will probably purchase it all again.  I would encourage everyone to go ahead and buy this set anyway though.  It is wonderful and you certainly won't regret it.

Hopefully, CBS/Paramount will see fit to release ""The Lucy Show"" on DVD next!",1174435200,5,1664,4.6438356164383565

The draw for me is the 40 minute Westinghouse presentation. I have never seen it and it surpassed my expectations. Part pitch, part Lucy episode it was a hoot watching Lucille Ball trying to get free appliances from Westinghouse. Desi's pitch on what kind of shows and storylines the Desilu Playhouse would NOT be showing was funny as well, by today's standards.

As for the missing movie, It's due this fall as a separate release. Three episodes from the first season all linked together with footage recorded at the time. I've never seen this either but from what I've read, with the extra footage, it really does play out like a film.

I remember the original version, where she explains that she is allergic to strawberries.  For years this segment was cut out, leaving everyone to wonder why she was scratching so furiously in the last of the show, spoiling the gag entirely.  When watching the episode with friends I would always have to subsequently explain to them, ""You see, she is allergic to strawberries.  They cut that out to make room for commercials.""  So, it was with great expectation that I watched the new DVD version, waiting to see the restored scene.  IT IS STILL MISSING.  This makes me wonder what else is still missing from the other episodes.  WHY IS THIS SCENE STILL MISSING??????",1174348800,25,796,4.932330827067669
2709024,4,B000LE16W6,"When I was a kid these shows were repeated several times by CBS as a summer replacement series so I was pretty familiar with them growing up.  The last time I had the opportunity to see them was in the 80's when they were syndicated in severely abridged editions hosted by Lucie Arnaz and featuring interview segments with some of the surviving guest stars.  I taped those on vhs, but for obvious reasons found them unsatisfactory. Therefore I am excited to finally have the complete series on dvd.

I've only watched two segments on this new dvd set, but was dumbfounded by the missing dialogue in the Tallulah Bankhead segment regarding her allergy to strawberries.  I checked my vhs tape from the 80's and the scene, which is essential if the rest of the show is going to make any sense, is there.  There is a slight change in video quality.  It's not too bad, although I'm sure that on dvd it would be more noticeable.  What I don't understand is why it wasn't even included in the extras section along with the scenes involving Fred and Ethel in the kitchen. The ""I Love Lucy"" dvd series has generally been of such excellent quality that I'm surprised by this major and obvious goof. That's why I only gave 4 stars. I hope the rest of the episodes are presented with the quality I've come to expect.

For those who are interested this is the missing dialogue:

Ethel: At these prices we should have unlimited bickering.

(Ethel and Fred exit into the kitchen.  DVD CUTS OUT)

Lucy:  Oh, I'm so humiliated.  I could die.

Tallulah:  Oh forget about it darling.  This is my lucky night.  I'm allergic to strawberries.  They give me hives.

Lucy:  Hives!

Tallulah:  Just thinking about it makes me...ooh...ooh...ooh (Tallulah makes shivering motions)

Lucy:  Oh, I'm so glad! I mean...

Tallulah:  (laughing)I know exactly what you mean.

(DVD CUTS BACK IN)

Ricky:  Would you like some coffee?

We are all happy to have these shows on dvd, however, that does not mean we have to be happy about being presented with a product that is not as good as it could be.

I have had a wonderful time watching this set of dvds. However, because we love and respect the work of Lucy and Desi many of us think these show should be respected and preserved in the best possible way. Also, those of us who are life long fans and have spent good money for these discs deserve respect as well.

After reading the ad, I discovered the DVD's were the hour-long ""Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" episodes! I've been hoping for these to be available on DVD for a long time, and had given up hope they'd be produced. This is certainly an exciting announcement, for those of us who are die-hard Lucy fans, this completes our DVD collection. My favorite hour-long show is the ""Neighbor Next Door"" with Miss Bankhead. It's comedy at its finest with Lucy so star-struck over the fact a celebrity/star is moving in next door. She's at her best doing her best to get to meet Miss Bankhead! The chaos that takes place is first-class comedy! I've placed my order for the last 3 DVD's and can't wait for them to arrive! I really wonder if Lucy and Desi ever thought they would live on for years in television history, with their series on cable, DVD's, etc...neither even thought of in the 1950's!

Best of all is Tallulah Bankhead filling in for Bette Davis and her broken leg; though there were battles off-camera, they just fed the energy as Lucy makes an enemy of her new neighbor. Tallulah more than holds her own; and Richard Deacon scores as her butler. The last one with Ernie Kovacs and his wife Edie Adams is very good. The Milton Berle is the mug fest, in closeup yet.

2709048,5,B000LE16W6,"It is interesting to note that the backdrops for the Alaska epsiode were filmed in Lake Arrowhead, California (this is according to the I Love Lucy book by Bart Andrews).  Lake Arrowhead is about a two hour drive from Los Angeles, which is probably why the Desilu production crew decided to shoot the backdrops here instead of flying to Alaska.  I have lived in Lake Arrowhead for more than 30 years.  Many other movies have been shot in and around the area including ""Heidi"" with Shirley Temple and more recently the ""Parent Trap"" remake movie with Lindsay Lohan.  One movie yet to come out titled ""Next"" was also shot in and around Lake Arrowhead and the nearby resort town of Big Bear Lake.  ""Next"" stars Nicolas Cage as a man who can see into the future and gets in trouble with the FBI as a result. The opening to the 1970s kid show ""H.R. Pufnstuf"" was also shot at Big Bear Lake.

In conclusion, when watching the Alaska episode, look for Lake Arrowhead!",1174003200,5,960,4.520231213872832
2709049,4,B000LE16W6,"This last installment of shows featuring the I LOVE LUCY cast has a treasure trove of features, and some flashbacks to the half hour series.  Most enjoyable is the color footage from Season One's AUDITION episode that was taken by an sudience member.  What a great way to see the show as it was actually made.

For the 13 hour shows, all are stunningly sharp in picture and sound.  I'm extremely glad that the premiere Havana Cruise episode is restored to its complete presentation.  If space allowed, even on another disc, I would have also included the full edited version that has been rerun since the intial broadcast as a contrast piece.  Showing the difference between the two with just the Balcony scene doesn't cut it.  I now have to keep my VHS version to have this shorter edition.

I agree with other comments noted below about the Tallulah episode (the best of this series, comedy-wise).  The set-up about the allergy to strawberries is a major flaw.  With the 16mm extras footage, I'm not sure if this was an error, or what was available to work with.  When you choose this scene, it starts at the tail end of the conversation about the allergy where Lucy says, ""Oh, I'm so glad...uh, you know what I mean"", with Tallulah responding ""I know exactly what you mean"", and it continues.  It is true that when ""We Love Lucy"" (syndicated hour and half-hour versions of Lucy-Desi Hours issued in the 90s) broadcast in the episode and the 2-Hour compilation specials, a poorer quality section of this conversation was inserted, but did not continue to the full Mertz walkout in the kitchen, but to the edited version of that scene.  Regardless, the allergy piece was still ""in"".  I even remember watching a film rerun of this show 12/30/73 on NY's Channel 5, when they began to rerun monthly on weekends what was advertised as The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour.  It was the first time I viewed it as The Lucille Ball - Desi Arnaz Show, with the animated ""Ford"" opening, only without the sponsor mention and voice-over (theme only).  The titles also only had the flipped card announcing Viv and Bill, the little extra pull-down for Little Ricky, then would fade quick to a separate still while the theme faded stating ""and Special Guest Star Tallulah Bankhead"".  I have an audio tape of this show as broadcast, as we weren't at the point of owning VCRs then.  This edited film version featured the entire two kitchen scenes with the Mertzes, and the Strawberry allergy reference.  Therefore, a film version may still exist in Viacom's archives somewhere.  The closing credits were also the animated ones as you see here in the Bonus features, but no Roy Rowan voice over or guest cast references.  It is also the full two chorus orchestral theme vs. the choppy ones on the L-D Hour closing credits on some of the shows.

As a point of reference, when these film versions (prior to remastering to video, etc) were broadcast in the 70s on Channel 5, all but two used the ""Ford"" animated opening without sponsor mention and voice over, and the same animated closing credits with the full double-chorus theme, and referencing The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show.  When the Paul Douglas and Ida Lupino episodes were broadcast, they were in the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour versions you see here, with maybe a different tweak here and there for commercials, but mostly what you see here.  This confirmed I wasn't crazy, and remembered these openings from summer reruns on CBS in the 60s.  The animated ""Ford"" openings were new to me at the time.

The menus are adorable, but I wouldn't have used any incidental music from the half hour series, even if this is advertised as an I Love Lucy box.  I would have extracted some incidental music from the hour shows to add when you switch between the menus.  Glad the 1957-60 instumental opening theme is used at main menu start, even if edited.

I am also happy that the completed Westinghouse Promotion Video is included with this set.  It is a very necessary piece, and compared to the horrible edited versions with verbage printed all over it on bootlegged Good Times releases, you get to see it complete for the first time without interuption.

My only other peave with this set is some of the chapter marks.  There shoud have been an additional one or two added during the Geisha House scene in the Japan episode.  The last chapter marker is at the first scene of the guys at the table, and then you would have to fast forward to get to a specific place.  Should have added a marker either at the start of Tokyo Pete and/or at either when Lucy & Viv discover each other in the Geisha costumes, or at the break for commercial after Lucy dances, and then the last scene is set up.

Lastly, I am not sure if the Milton Berle Special that Desi refers to in the bonus features was a Desilu production, but broadcast on NBC.  Once prior to, and once right after her passing, this program was shown ""somewhere"", probably on Fox affiliates, with the latter broadcast  I remember being called MILTON LOVES LUCY, with Berle doing opening and closing comments on video.  I have this somewhere on VHS.  Based on the time of original broadcast, if it was a Desilu produced project and was available, I would have added this show to this set as part of a Bonus Disc, and also include the Danny Thomas Show episode with Lucy & Ricky, as well as the Ann Sothern Show episode with Lucy, since these both were definitely done at Desilu.  That would have really completed the package with a big POW!

Don't get me wrong.  A fan of my caliber has to point out all these things, but as a whole, this is a great package that entertains, provides historical background and gives us a glimpse of behind-the-scenes magic.  A few necessary minor details still need to be worked out, especially if a second pressing will follow.

Now that one full series is out, we can only hope for The Lucy Show, all of Here's Lucy, the 1976-80 specials & even Life With Lucy, and any other odds and ends in between (the 1960s special with Bob Hope, and the Lucy Goes To London Special with Anthony Newley).",1174003200,8,6096,4.615027829313544
2709050,3,B000LE16W6,"Very enjoyable overall, but sad that the ultimate episode in this collection, 'The Celebrity Next Door' is an edited version. I wasn't alive in the 50s, but while living in LA in the late 80s, this episode was shown on TV without the cuts on this new DVD. The giveaway is the plotline about Bankhead being allergic to strawberries, in the unedited version, after the strawberry pie had wound up splattered on Fred in his butler uniform, Bankhead told someone in the show ( i can't remember, but likely the Ball, Arnaz, or Vance character) that it was a good thing, because she was deathly allergic to strawberries. That footage is missing here, and there's only a short mention of it when Ball brings Bankhead some home-made jam and assures her that it's not strawberry, ""so you don't have to worry about your hives"". With the missing footage, there's no reason for Lucy to have said this line, but it does set-up the ending of the episode but would have made more sense if Bankhead's original comment had been left in tact..This small point does figure promininently in the finale of the episode, so its kind of sloppy to have it missing.  Too bad.  Enjoyable collection, otherwise.",1173916800,7,1183,4.7101449275362315
2709051,3,B000LE16W6,"This set is great looking and has some terrific features. However, in the Tallulah Bankhead episode there is important footage missing.

Some of the missing parts of scenes for the episode are shown in the Bonus Feature section (they was deemed too poor in quality to reintegrate--especially since the excised footage is in 16 mm and the masters are from 35mm).

The key plot point footage that is missing, however, involves Miss Bankhead telling Lucy that she is allergic to strawberries (something important to what follows later on).

The footage exists somewhere, I have it on videotape, and would have been great to have had in the set.

Otherwise, it's a beautiful job by all involved.",1173916800,6,691,4.931034482758621

I grew up watching the old reruns on Fox, but I've never seen all the episodes in order until now. In retrospect this final season(s) (The Desilu Comedy Hour) is my favorite season. The 1st Season was hilarious and original, as was season 2. They kept it fresh by traveling to Europe and California. I thought season 6 was the worst season of them all, which was disappointing because I thought it was the last season and didn't know about the comedy hour. Caroline Applebee was a real drag with her over dramatic acting, and she sucked the life out of every episode she was in. Thankfully she's gone in this last season and it shows. They keep this season fresh by actually leaving the set and going on location to many places, upping the effects and stunts, mixed with the familiar Lucy gags, to create a final and funniest I Love Lucy season ever! If you're a big Lucy Fan, of course you will buy this set, but if you are just a casual fan, put this season at the top of your list!",1173830400,4,1087,4.230769230769231

2709055,5,B000LE16W6,"UPDATE: March-22-07

(The ""I Love lucy Movie"" not to be included in the set! from what I have read Paramount is going to be bringing us a seperate set with the ""I Love Lucy"" movie and a lost scenes/shows set with bonuses. Look for this set in the near future, this is probably another way for Paramount to make money.) Also in the show ""The Celebrity Next Door"" this episode is cut because it does no explain how Talula is allergic to strawberries, when originally aired Talula said that she got hives whenever she ate strawberries but on this set it does not explain that. All of the other episodes are perfect and funnier than I remembered them!

Update: May-14-2007

A DVD set was just released called ""Lucy's Really Lost Moments' and it will include many lost I Love Lucy scenes and tons of other bonuses including Desi and Lucy appearing on a game show and much more. It is available online through Amazon and other websites and you may be able to purchase it in some video stores also! The average price this set costs online is $10 to $13 and is a GREAT value, I just reserved my copy and can't wait to watch it!!!

I am so exited about ""I Love Lucy"" season 7-9 coming to dvd and I just can't wait to get it at my door. This set was originally aired on television as The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour and the name of this set has been changed to ""I Love Lucy,"" as that is what it is and should have been called in the first place. The only difference in this set than in Season 1-6 of ""I Love Lucy"" is that these shows were one hour long episodes instead of half hour episodes, and it continues where Season 6 left off in Connecticut when the gang moved to the country.

These seasons have not aired on cable television as much as the other ""I Love Lucy"" shows, and it is such a disappointment because there are GREAT shows on here. Why do they not air much??? This dvd box set includes 13 classic episodes at each being an hour long and so you get over 13 hours of fun with this set, not mentioning the many bonuses. There will even be some scenes from ""I love Lucy"" to be set in color and  deleted scenes and flubs and fun commercials as well. You will also receive the ""I Love Lucy"" movie!! It is 3 shows with a continuing story line and has never been shown before, EVER. They were suppose to air it back in the 1950's but it was cancelled due to the Release of ""The Long Long Trailer"" and it has been lost and forgotten for over 50 years and now we all can own this. They figured that since ""The Long Long Trailer was being aired that there was no need for this movie and decided not to air it.

One of my favorite shows on this set is ""Lucy Takes A Cruise To Havana,"" in this episode there will be a flash back of how Lucy first met Ricky on her cruise to Havana. This episode was first originally aired as 75 minutes long but 15 minutes had to be cut out and Paramount is including the 75 minute long episode with this set, which hasn't been seen since It's original broadcast. Desi Arnaz did not want anything cut on this episode and he talked CBS in to keeping the added minutes. It took the full 75 minutes to make the episode perfect and Desi wanted everything, he would not settle for edited content. When this show was first originally aired back in the 50's it was the full 75 minutes with commercials but every since than it has appeared on cable edited. Desi Arnaz would be very proud to know that the full content is being released!

Here is the episode List:

1.) Lucy Takes A Cruise To Havana
2.) The Celebrity Next Door
3.) Lucy Hunts Uranium
4.) Lucy Wins A Racehorse
5.) Lucy Goes To Sun Valley
6.) Lucy Goes To Mexico
7.) Lucy Makes Room For Danny

2709056,5,B000LE16W6,"I have to say that this is the best season from ""I Love Lucy"" because it shows the Ricardo's and Mertz in various locations and in a new setting.

Although it still has the same characters, plot, theme and story line as ""I Love Lucy"" did. There's also a lot of extras that come in this set, you get the ""I Love Lucy""  movie that was going to be released around the same time as Lucy and Desi's other movie ""The Long Long Trailer"" but was shelved because the studio felt that since ""I Love Lucy"" was so big at the time being the number one show in America, it would harm the sales of ""The Long Long Trailer"".

8161829,5,B000LE16W6,"Can't believe it's been 8 years since I purchased this DVD.  Time flies.

After watching it for yet another time was checking Amazon and realized I'd never commented on it.  So, thought I'd give it a shot.

First, the quality of the DVD is top notch.  The picture is clear.  Each episode is complete, as aired, from 1957-1960.  It contains a lot of extras, such as details about the series, cast information, series history, behind the scenes stories and pictures.  Each episode is broken down into parts with insights.  Extras include intros and even commercials Arnaz and Ball did for the sponsors.  Great work.  Shows what you can do when you take the time and do it right.  The total opposite of the My Three Sons DVD offerings.

For many people out there seasons 7-9 aren't really 7-9 of 'I Love Lucy'.  In reality the series ran as independent specials.  In 1957-1958 it was sponsored by Ford Motor Company and featured 5 unique episodes spread out over the broadcast season.  Each would run for 1 hour.  Season #1 has been rated the best, by far, of the 3.  Most agree the best episode of the series was #2, featuring Tallulah Bankhead.  The other 4 were up and down.  #3 marked the first tv work by Fred MacMurray, who turned up in his own series , 'My Three Sons' in 1960 (which was produced at Desilu Studios).  So, the next season, #2, running in 1958-1959 again had 5 original episodes of 60 minutes each.  However, in this and the final season, the specials were part of the 'Westinghouse-Desilu Playhouse' and aired spread out like #1.  Season #2 was highly rated but the quality of the episodes open to debate.  Season #3 (1959-1960) featured only 3 episodes, none of which were very good as those in the past, but are enjoyed by true fans of the series.  Moved to an new night, and spread out from September to April, its ratings dropped which helped bring down the entire series of the Playhouse.  And, it was the end of the 'I Love Lucy' franchise.

Never before, or maybe since, had a series demise been so traumatic.  Ball and Arnaz were buried in irate fan mail, begging them to return.  Ball said letters like that came in the thousands each week for months.  She said that she was still getting them in the 1970s.  When her 3rd series went off the air in 1974 she said letters poured in begging her to remarry Desi and go back on the air with 'I Love Lucy'.  Arnaz said people called him Ricky for decades.  Such a great series, even one that went downhill in quality towards the end, was still very popular.  Arnaz believed that the viewers had grown close to the characters, as if they were old friends or family.  And, for years, he was seen as the guy who ended it.

Makes you wonder, especially as you watch the last episode of 'Comedy Hour', what could have been.  All the cast, sans 'Little Ricky' are now gone.  But, maybe there are still fans out there holding out for one last return of the series, this time with 'Little Ricky' as its star.  What a concept that would be.  A return of a series off the air (new episodes, of course) since the year JFK was elected, 58 years ago, would be something to see.  Could it be done?.  Hell, why not?

In the meantime, we have this final 13 episodes of the series all in one place to watch.  And maybe think of some new scripts for its return.",1517443200,,3317,4.411570247933884
