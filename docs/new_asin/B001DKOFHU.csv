This is a hard sell for the US market: not because it isn't worthy, but because it wasn't even well promoted by the BBC back in Britain. I didn't see one trailer for it, or any previews in the press, which is really odd. On the face of it, and in my opinion, despite the show being packed with well known stars of British TV and film, a very sharp and (adult) whitty script, with adult themes of a sexual nature, fast paced, well edited and shot---the BBC lost it's nerve and dropped support for a second season. I loved it--and laughed out loud quite a lot. ''In the good old days'', a show like this, with a cracking script and terriffic cast, they would have allowed the public time to get to know the show'---this is exactly what happend with ''The Office'', a world smash, eventually. I remember watching the Office late on a weekday night, shown on a minor channel ( after a long boring Political disscussion show') with next to no publicity----until the 'word of mouth' via public approval, caused an explosion---I'm not claiming 'Mutual Friends' to be a similar sleeper, just that it is far better than the lack of all round support might imply. This is a quality piece of adult entertainment, well worth the low cost---take advantage, I don't think you will be disappointed.  P G Croft  UK",1395187200,4,1361,4.596707818930041
