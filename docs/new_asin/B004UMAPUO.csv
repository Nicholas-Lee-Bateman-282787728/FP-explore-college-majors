4469082,3,B004UMAPUO,"Love these kinds of movies with my favorites being Braveheart and Spartacus.  The story of the 9th Legion is often told in many different ways since the true story is lost to history.  Last year was the bloody Centurion which I liked, and before that we has The Last Legion.  The Eagle starts off well with a brooding Channing Tatum taking his post in Britain trying to salvage his families' honor after the disappearance of the 9th which was commanded by his father.  Not much set up before you get right into the action.  Some nice small battle scenes.  Then the movie becomes less an epic and more an adventure as Tatum sets out into the wilds of northern Britain to find the Eagle standard of the 9th.  The end of the movie wraps up with another small battle.  The movie is very good in places like the beautiful locations and period look as well as a strong performance from Channing.  Points where it lacks are the failings to live up to the word ""Epic"", some gaps in logic and believability as well as giving you any surprises.  I did enjoy the movie and will purchase it when it is released on Blu.",1298073600,38,1106,4.403940886699507
4469083,5,B004UMAPUO,"The story and acting have heart even though the The Eagle is absolutely a ridiculous fantasy in so many different ways! But Donald Sutherland is one of my favorite actors and his performance is wonderful. To see him act one more time on the big screen was worth the price of admission! There's also an anti-war message clearly expressed at the end of the film. It's more enjoyable to have one true-blue friend than it is to kill or be part of the military. The soldiers may have honor, but the politicians that tell the military what to do certainly do not!

There's also a lot of testosterone running through The Eagle that is delightfully homoerotic! It's a pleasure to watch so many incredibly fit men show off their bodies and prowess! It's just a shame all this libido is wasted on intense violence!",1297814400,3,804,4.583333333333333
4469084,3,B004UMAPUO,"Set in about AD 150, the protagonist is a Roman whose father was the leader of the Roman 9th Legion, a military unit lost to the mists of time and whose sacred standard--the Roman Eagle--was lost, casting dishonor on the family.  The protagonist goes into Scotland looking for the Eagle with the help of his trusty slave, a Celt.  All is made right in the end as the Eagle is recovered, the slave is set free, and the dishonored legionnairies are restored.

This is no oscar contender.  The first half, comprising the introduction of the characters and scenes of Roman Britain, Hadrian's Wall, and the Scottish Highlands, was very enjoyable.  The second half, comprising the capture of the protagonist, discovery of the Eagle, and flight back to safety with said treasure, was quite boring.  It could have been the fact that I ran out of popcorn, but I don't think so.  The first half was an obvious attempt at setting an historical mood, while the second half could have been any lame action flick.  The movie even ended on an anachronistic note as the Romans honored their fallen enemies.

The acting and writing was mediocre at best.  Although praised by others, the casting was actually done poorly, and the actor playing the protagonist was not able to carry the film.  His slave was the best actor and best character in the film, although I didn't want the film to be about him but about the Romans.  Cinematography was acceptable, and some early scenes were well done.  Shots of the Highlands were either done on location or very good approximations (I've been there and seen Hadrian's Wall).  This is a film I could have watched on DVD so I could've fast-forwarded through parts.",1297555200,2,1687,4.732876712328767
4469085,4,B004UMAPUO,"The film had Picts and other Celtic tribes fighting the Romans, as well as beautiful shots of the Scottish Highlands. It had just about all I could want, therefore, although the script could have been a bit tighter and the acting better. Based on the novel The Eagle of the Ninth by Rosemary Sutcliff, the story takes place in 140 AD.  Channing Tatum plays a young Roman centurian, whose father commanded the Ninth Legion, which had 5,000 men almost all killed by the Celts--at least in the film. First, Tatum is commander of a fort, which has to repel an attack; then, he and a Celtic slave (played by Jamie Bell) head north of Hadrian's Wall to retrieve the Ninth's eagle standard, held by the blue-painted Seal People.

Somehow, a handful of Roman deserters are there to help Tatum and Bell fend off a Seal People attack. Their existence seems very unlikely, but apparently, according to historical accounts, some of the Ninth's men did survive and served in later campaigns (although they were not hiding in the woods for two decades, as they were in the film). Nevertheless, this battle scene and one around the fort are stirring!

All in all, I feel that this is an entertaining and historically interesting film.",1297468800,10,1219,4.740566037735849
4469086,4,B004UMAPUO,"Back in the early second century, the Ninth Legion disappeared from history. The current going theory is that they were wiped out in combat in the Eastern Provinces, but there's also a theory that they were destroyed fighting the Picts in what is now called Scotland. That's the jumping-off point for The Eagle, a rather lightweight sword and sandals film staring Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell.

Tatum plays Marcus Flavius Aquila, son of the commander of the Ninth Legion. He's gone into the army himself and worked hard to get sent to Britannia, where he hopes to not only recover his father's honor, but also that of the Legion and to recover it's beloved standard; a gold eagle. The Roman legions fetishized their eagles (or ""aquila"", a word suspiciously similiar to the last name of our hero), to an impressive degree. Better in many ways to lose every man in your legion than to lose your standard.

Anyhow, young Marcus gets to Britannia, takes command of a legion, promptly gets injured and drummed out of the service, then acquires Esca (Jamie Bell), a young slave. He eventually hatches a plan to find the Eagle and along with Esca, heads north into darkest Caledonia. Along the way the two fight, bond and generally have an interesting time of it.

I really enjoyed this movie. It was entertaining, well-done and well-paced. Several of the plot twists were telegraphed well in advance, including the biggest one, which was shown to us in the trailers. But that minor complaint aside, it was good. The historical accuracy was decent (though some of the tactics the Romans employ made me roll my eyes. Where's your pila, boys?), and anytime I see a movie with Romans not using stirrups I get a least a bit happy. Plus it was cool hearing the Picts speaking Gaelic. Yes, it wasn't Pictish, but it was the best they could do, and at least it wasn't the Pictsies. Also, the acting was quite decent, and Channing Tatum seems to have done a good job of redeeming himself after some of his other works.

This is minor escapist fare. It's nothing great, but it is pretty fun and on the whole there's certainly far worse ways to spend a couple hours.",1297468800,171,2150,4.66490765171504
4469087,3,B004UMAPUO,"I didn't know much about The Eagle going into it. I had seen a TV spot or two, but it was pretty underwhelming and didn't seem to reveal much of anything about the plot of the film. Something about a war in Roman times starring the guy that played Duke in the G.I. Joe movie. When I realized I was going to a screening, I purposely avoided more TV spots and full-length trailers. The less you know about a film going into it, the better the experience will be. I also wasn't sure what to expect from Channing Tatum since he's been pretty mediocre at best even when it comes to the films he was a part of that I enjoyed. In the end, The Eagle may be some of Tatum's best work but I'm not exactly sure how much of a compliment that really is.

For at least a few years now, I've firmly believed that a film can be good despite what its rating is. I still believe that. A good film is going to be good no matter what not just because it shows blood or nudity or just so happens to be family friendly. With that being said, I'm also under the impression that films revolving around heavy warfare should aim for the R-rating. War is brutal, relentless, and unforgiving. I believe it should be depicted that way on screen. The Eagle is obviously about more than spending time on the battlefield. War is more of a backdrop to the relationship between Marcus and Esca and the journey to find the Eagle in addition to its meaning to the Romans. However, no blood being shown during the most intense battle sequences of the film made it feel censored at times and seem weak in comparison to the films it'll make you reminisce about throughout its duration.

Channing Tatum carries the film fairly well. There's one scene right before he heads off to try and find the Eagle where he's talking with Donald Sutherland and he makes a speech that Tatum just manages to put such power and emotion into. It's a short scene, but it's probably his highlight and helps display the passion Marcus has of restoring honor to his family's name. Jamie Bell's Esca was mostly interesting due to his true intentions being fairly unpredictable throughout the film. His British blood runs thick, but he owes his life to Marcus who happens to be a Roman. One of them eventually has to give. Seeing that play out is the main attraction to the Esca character. Donald Sutherland's appearance in the film isn't nearly as noteworthy as his appearance in The Mechanic. Sutherland seemed to make the most of his short screen time in The Mechanic while being rather flat in The Eagle despite having a bit more screen time in comparison. Sutherland's Uncle Aquila also stands in the way of his nephew Marcus in a roundabout kind of way by encouraging him to stay put and repeatedly informing him he has no chance of surviving north of the wall. Both characters Sutherland portrays are so different in comparison, which is probably a good thing at the end of the day. Mark Strong may be practically unrecognizable in this, as well. I'm convinced (and this is a partial spoiler) that he took over the reigns of only taking characters that die at the end of a film from Liam Neeson. It seems like Strong dies in every film he's a part of, doesn't it? Lastly, there's Tahar Rahim who has a very strong showing here. After seeing him in the outstanding A Prophet, it was great to not only see him in something else but see him perform just as well.

Yet another film that suffers from shaky camera techniques during the most intense sequences in the film. Is just filming scenes like this normally just too boring for directors these days? If an intense fight sequence is edited well, do you even need the shaky bit? I never realized how often this technique was used until recently, but it seriously needs to go away more than any other trend currently taking place in Hollywood.

The Eagle is a captivating drama with heavy hitting action sequences and a well-rounded cast that contains elements of 300, Gladiator, and even Valhalla Rising. Unfortunately The Eagle isn't anywhere near as good as any of those films and falls a bit flat in the end. Nevertheless, The Eagle is an adventure worth taking.",1297296000,8,4159,4.51925630810093

4469111,5,B004UMAPUO,"I realize that this film is unlike the book and the book was much better, but I am judging the film in its own right and I can say I enjoyed it. It is true that there are more than half a dozen events in the film that did not make sense to me. An example is how could our hero prove that his dad was a hero based on hearsay, especially when it was heard from a man who changed what he was willing to say. But there is a Yiddish saying which I think about when I see most films: ""Auf a maseh fregged men nished a kasha."" Paraphrasing the Yiddish, it says, ""We don't question a story.  We accept the illogic in the tale. (After all, its just a story.)"" I also ignored the film's false version of the history of the times, the cultures that existed, that all the British people were savages, etc., for the same reason. I accepted the untruths as true and enjoyed what I was shown.
We watch a tale of a Roman boy around the second century CE who loved his father, who wanted with all his heart to be like him, a soldier in the Roman Legion.  Years later his father lost his life in battle against the British in northern England, or perhaps it was Scotland. He joined the military and rose in rank to lead a Legion himself. When he was discharged because of an injury incurred when he fought heroically, he decided, against the advice of Roman officials, to go north and recapture the eagle, the symbol of the Legion led by his dad, and restore his fathers honor, for no one in Rome knew how his father died, as a hero or coward.
He took along as his slave, a British man who he had saved, who owed his life to him. This is another of the inexplicable events. The disabled warrior continually told the British man to obey him even when the two had left Roman land and were in the land of the British, because he was his slave. True, the soldier had saved his life, but should he continue to act as a slave when he had the ability to be free? But, these issues aside, as I said, I enjoyed the film. Besides, one can read into the events ideas that are not explicit, ideas that will explain everything.",1492992000,,2096,4.1474201474201475
4469112,2,B004UMAPUO,"Incredibly disappointed in this movie. While I understand that events often have to change to condense a book into a 2 hour movie, people should not, particularly when the hearts and relationships of those people are the strength of the book.

In the book, Esca and Marcus have a deep friendship defined by mutual respect and abiding love for one another. Marcus calls Esca ""Brother"" often. It is this relationship that makes their quest to find the Eagle possible, the trust and willingness to sacrifice for each other were necessary for their survival. The relationship is important also because it defines both men, showing us that they were able to go outside of traditional mores of their time and live consistently with what they believed to be true. They should have been enemies, but both saw the other as men, as human beings separate from their political culture and circumstances. Their friendship is how we know they were great men- honorable, self sacrificing, loving, with true integrity not shaped by any outside influences. It is the foundation of the story.

In the movie that relationship is wholly changed. There is bitterness, selfishness, and deceit between them. Because that relationship is so changed it in turn changes the men. They are not Marcus and Esca. The movie should have told its own story and not changed the heart of Sutcliffe's masterful telling of not only the tale of the quest for the Eagle, but a tale of friendship, devotion, honor, and love. On its own merit the movie could have earned 4 stars for outstanding casting, excellent sets, and an action packed adventure. Instead they twisted a beautiful moral tale into something it wasn't.",1491868800,5,1680,4.932862190812721

4469114,4,B004UMAPUO,"After being irreversibly wounded in battle while on the British front of the Roman Empire, Marcus is honorably discharged from the Army. He then hears rumors that  the eagle of the Ninth legion, that his own father commanded and lost 20 years ago in the British territory beyond Hadrian's Wall, had been seen in the possesion of a Northern Clan. He decides to retrieve it to restore his father's honor, and his only companion in his travels is a British slave, Esca.

I read the book just before watching the movie, and the two have a slightly different ""feel."" Most of the plot and incidents are the same as in the book, except a couple of significant changes-- especially when Marcus and Esca arrive at the clan that has the eagle. I suppose the writer felt that they had to to ramp up the tension at that point, which results in a different quality of relationship between the two main characters. There also seems to be an indication that Marcus needs to understand the issues of his own Society by living the life of the other side. It's a very modern message that Sutton doesn't really seem to address, although she does depict the tensions between the two sides as a central issue in the book. As such the book has a much more relaxed tone, even though many of the grim incidents in the movie are actually depicted in the book in a less intense way.

I disagree with a lot of other people that the actor who played Marcus was not a good actor. I thought he did a great job at depicting this character, as did the actor playing Esca. A couple of other actors seemed a little out of place though, especially Donald Sutherland. The fact that the Romans spoke with an American accent served to contrast them with Esca's British accent, so it was appropriate.

Huge amount of effort seems to be invested in the cinematography and the details of Roman British life which I really appreciated. That aspect in itself was worth at least an extra star. The music was very good too. And

**SPOILER**

although unlikely and straying from the plot of the book, I found the return of the 9th Legion very touching.

**END SPOILER

Despite all this, there was something still a little un Msatisfactory in the overall mood of the movie. There are many emotional and moving moments and the direction was really great sometimes, such as Marcus despairing over his discharge from the Army. But the movie lacked the Beauty of the book's quiet emotional moments and the sturdy sense of friendship between the two main characters. I was also disappointed that they do not include cub in the movie.

Note: I was amused to read that people liked the lack of love interest on IMDB, seeing that the book had a love interest for Marcus, a British girl called Cottia. (You kind of-sort of glimpse a girl in the arena scene that could have been her.) But yeah, she didn't have a lot to do and, ironically, I'm sure people would have thought that the modern writers put her in!",1488758400,,2953,4.535714285714286

4469125,4,B004UMAPUO,"The Eagle is a self-proclaimed sequel to Centurion, one of the few Roman-themed films I actually like, probably because it doesn't contain as much Roman-themed stereotypes as usual (I admit that it contains a lot of Celtic and Pictish stereotypes, though). There are also some nods to Gladiator, a heavily Roman-themed film I happen to like. Perhaps it's just my imagination, but I also spotted some nods to LOTR!

The main character of The Eagle is Marcus Flavius Aquila, the son of Titus Flavius Virilus, the commander of the Ninth Legion. The Legion disappeared 20 years earlier when on mission in Scotland, north of Hadrian's wall. Its golden eagle was captured by a particularly wild tribe of Picts, the Seal People. To restore the honor of his family name, Flavius Aquila enters Scotland together with a Celtic slave in search of the eagle, while also trying to solve the mystery of the Ninth Legion's disappearance

The Eagle has a very easy and straightforward plot, much less complex than Centurion. Essentially, the two heroes are chased by barbaric Picts (or are they Orcs?) most of the time! The concept probably doesn't work if the Mohikan-like appearance of the Picts strikes you as embarrassing. If you think the Seal People are all the rage, though, I think The Eagle works well enough as light Friday night entertainment. And yes, Aquila (the name means eagle in Latin) does get his honor redeemed at the end of the film.

Perhaps not really worth more than three stars, I will nevertheless give it four. Ave!",1480032000,,1526,4.861538461538461

4469174,5,B004UMAPUO,"This mesmerizing 2010 film THE EAGLE - starring Actors: Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell with co-stars Donald Sutherland and Mark Strong, head a cast of hundreds within this outstanding motion picture from Focus Features. Based on the novel ""THE EAGLE of the Ninth"" by Author: Rosemary Sutcliff, this color, single-disc, DVD from the Spotlight (Movie) Series, comes to it's audience in spoken English, French and Spanish, complete with subtitles of the same. In addition, it comes in both the theatrical and unrated versions (yes..., on this same DVD), with the bonus of an alternate ending, deleted scenes and a Feature Commentary with Director: Kevin Macdonald. This film comes in widescreen format, is approximately 1-hour and 54-minutes long (the unrated version), and has a superb screenplay, by: Jeremy Brock. Within this thrilling action and adventure, epic film set in the year 120 a.d. which is based upon the actual history of the infamous and seemingly long lost, 9th Roman Legion, that was... for 20 long years, disgraced in memory by the Barbaric hordes within the far region of what was then known, as: Britannia. Disgraced - how and why? Two reasons: 1). For a military defeat and 2). For the shameful loss of the Roman EAGLE, the very symbol of Rome's power and might. And so, from within the Legion with 5,000 soldiers having been killed, disbanded or enslaved by their conquerors, the mysterious 9th Legion was never heard from, again. And, to add insult to injury, the Roman Emperor - Hadrian, was so incensed by the two-fold embarrassing loss, that he had a wall erected across Britannia (modern-day England), so as too permanently separate the unconquered Northern Terrain which was inhabited by numerous Barbarian Tribes. As well as, too further isolate and keep them from invading the occupied Southern Region, which Roman troops had previously... in years gone by, successfully conquered, ruled and inhabited. Twenty, long years had passed since that unimaginable defeat and loss of THE EAGLE, had taken place. And now, twenty years later... a young, aspiring, Roman Officer, named Marcus Aquila (Tatum), who was acutely aware of the history of Hadrian's Wall and the disappearance of the 9th Legion, specifically requested to be stationed, there. Why? Because his very own father, was once a soldier and an officer within the infamous 9th Legion. And it was said... that his father was the one, who was solely at fault and responsible for the humiliating loss and subsequent theft of THE EAGLE. And so, after a series of events and the near loss of his own life, Marcus - along with his personal attendant, bravely journeyed past Hadrian's Wall..., in search of not only THE EAGLE but also, of the actual truth of what 'really' happened to his father and the 9th Legion. This enthralling, action and adventure film that encompasses the strength and  might that is Rome, along with the dark and mysterious unknown that lay awaiting them just north of Hadrian's Wall, is riveting, compelling and unique. Light and darkness within a movie, is almost always, a Box Office draw...! This film comes equipped with all the intrigue and movie drama that makes for a captivating, motion picture. So, if you like epic films and you haven't yet seen THE EAGLE, then definitely add this to your 'must see' and 'keep', list. Nina Kish",1436486400,,3342,5.0
4469175,4,B004UMAPUO,"The Eagle
 The Eagle in the title of this period action flick refers to the sacred standard of the 9th Legion, taken by wild Scots tribesmen in a fictional fracas in the far North of Britain.  Thanks to the writing of Jeremy Brock (Last King of Scotland) it also refers to the hero who bears the family name Aquila, eagle in Latin.  No women appear in this film dedicated to the manly virtues of courage, steadfastness, loyalty and perseverance.  The last film set in this time and place many thought flawed by the appearance of Keira Knightly as a half naked Pictish (very primitive people in Scotland) warrior.  None of that nonsense appears here.
 The now veteran actor Channing Tatum broods, bleeds, flees and fights in his starring role as Aquila.  He and his slave side kick, Jamie Bell-another young but veteran actor-are engaged in a quest for The Eagle, an emblem of such power that it is used by the primitives as a holy relic.  They penetrate the desolate, and beautifully filmed, wilds of the Scottish Highlands and eventually encounter the dreaded Seal People, a fantasy depiction of the Picts.  The actors do fine and there is just enough chemistry between the Roman master and the Brigante (a British tribe) slave to be interesting in its own right.  Donald Sutherland graces the screen in a brief role as the uncle of Aquila.
 This is a directors film, all due obeisance to the writer and actors.  Kevin MacDonald (Last King of Scotland) has invented a world that lives and breathes as second century Britain might have been.  The costumes, uniforms, armor, weapons, and the utterly primitive habitations of the poverty stricken Scots are spot on.  He films the (historically not exactly accurate) fight scenes with a vigor that makes them fresh, exciting and entertaining, not easy to do after the hundreds and hundreds of action films that Hollywood has churned out over the decades.
 This PG-13 (blood, fighting, human sacrifice, murder) film runs one hour and 54 minutes.  We rate it as better than the average action movie and award it a satisfactory three and a half saw blades.  I enjoyed it after several weeks of watching thinking movies and chick flicks.  If you want a dose of unapologetic heroism served straight up, this might be your concoction.",1435968000,2,2275,4.819587628865979

4469197,3,B004UMAPUO,"This movie had some ups and downs to it. First off, let me say that the movie seemed pretty authentic, both in its script and research, and in its production design. Those elements get 4 or 5 stars. However, I was hoping for several ""Braveheart"" style massive battles that really delivered some action. The thing that diverted this off into being three stars as opposed to 4 or 5 was the fact that it wandered off into territory where the lead character (played by Channing Tatum) was simply going on a solo mission, and it kind of turned into a ""journey flick"" instead of a movie where there were huge pitched battles. It kind of toned the excitement down. As far as being a rather gritty, realistic movie, this one did well. Also, I don't usually think that Channing Tatum is that great of an actor, but in this movie he did a commendable job, mostly due to the well written script with good dialogue and solid characters. At the end of the day, I'd put this movie in roughly the same category as ""Braveheart,"" I'd just put it a notch or two down.",1421107200,,1049,4.412371134020619

4469199,3,B004UMAPUO,"Oh dear, here we go... another Hollywood stab at ancient history. Well, actually, it's not that bad (things have certainly improved since Kirk Douglas' day) and in fact it's only half Hollywood, the other half being financed by Film4. There's no reason Romans shouldn't have American accents; do we want subtitles with them speaking ancient Greek? No. Is it silly seeing ancient Britons trotting about on great Arab steeds? Yes. Are the half clad Pictish Seal people somewhat improbable given the Scottish climate? Yes. Do we really care that much about the above and the rest of the silliness? No. What we're given is a reasonably faithful'ish adaptation of Rosemary Sutcliffe's classic Eagle of the Ninth with lots of presumably authentic grime and gore, plenty of atmospheric cinematography and sweeping Scottish landscapes. The film is what the book is; an allegorical tale on the value of friendship, loyalty and honour and in that, it succeeds.

Marcus' motivations are to save his family's honor, but will Esca remain a faithful slave or slit Marcus' throat at the first opportunity? Donald Sutherland has a significant side role as Marcus' uncle.

""The Eagle"" (2011) is reminiscent of films like ""Centurion"" (2010), ""Black Death"" (2010) and ""Black Robe"" (1991). It lacks the greatness of the latter two, but it's almost on par with first one. As a matter of fact, ""The Eagle"" is the unofficial sequel to that film (more on this below). ""Black Death"" has deeper, more interesting themes while ""Black Robe"" is in a league of its own as far as gritty realism goes.

Where ""The Eagle"" shines is the authentic Scottish locations, the beautiful cinematography, and the mysteriousness of going into the unknown, as well as the depictions of the various warrior tribes and the quality score. Unfortunately, the story is only moderately compelling and the relationship between Marcus and Esca isn't that interesting. Furthermore, there are no women, except meaningless side characters in the distance; the other three films noted above, as well as ""King Arthur,"" didn't make this mistake.

Also, there is a roll-your-eyes sequence in the last act where some tribesmen (and a boy) on foot are able to keep up with two guys on horses over the course of a couple days. Why sure!

Still, if you like any of the other four movies noted above ""The Eagle"" is a must.

Be sure to catch the aforementioned ""Centurion"" because it chronicles the fate of the ninth legion and Marcus' father two decades before the events of ""The Eagle"" take place (even though it's just cinematic conjecture, of course). Although ""The Eagle"" has a way better first act and more gritty realism, ""Centurion"" is more conventionally entertaining, contains important female characters and has a better final act.

The film runs 114 minutes.

They are barbarians after all. The whole movie is pretty violent and even disturbing at times. Its also a real bromance between Tatum and Bell who are pretty good together. I wouldnt say this was a bad movie, but it was kind of a throw away movie. Tatum does a pretty good job in a serious roll. He isn't the greatest actor, but he always seems to really try his best.

4469234,5,B004UMAPUO,"About fifteen years ago, I awakened to the power of movies and television.  I crammed several decades of movies and television in during the following couple of years as my fresh awakening allowed me to be moved intensely by a range of programs including the 1973 Jesus Christ Superstar and 1976 Hair to the HBO Series Sopranos and WB networks Roswell.  I also came to greatly appreciate actors and actresses including Robert De Niro, Olympia Dukakis, Robin Williams, Johnny Depp, Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie, Sigourney Weaver, Bruce Willis, Susan Sarandon, and Rene Russo.  But, not since those couple of years have I been moved as deeply by media as from Kevin Macdonalds The Eagle.  If you enjoy allowing movies to demonstrate what spiritual beings are willing to reveal of themselves through art, there is a great deal here to consider.  If you enjoy cinematography, this movie will delight.  If you value brotherhood and loyalty, this movie is a must.  If you enjoy military tactics, this movie is powerful.  Then, to sweeten the pot, if you enjoy either Channing Tatum or Jamie Bell as actors, this movie will certainly please (a wonderful plus is Donald Sutherland in a key role).  The Eagle is a gorgeous, engaging, and intense adventure.",1407715200,2,1249,4.966346153846154

4469249,5,B004UMAPUO,"That's right. I have seen the Eagle three times now. I'm a student of history in any case. This is fictionalized history at its best. Yes, Britain was split in two between civilization and tribal kingdoms. Channing Tatum is the epitome in leadership. A true and honorable Roman. What is really interesting, and missed by many, is the description of the ""Seal"" people. They wore war paint, took scalps, dressed lightly, and looked a lot like the Iroquois in the northeastern United States---especially the hairdo. Might be something to the fact our Indian brothers came from Europe; at least on our east coast. Terrific movie.",1400371200,,625,4.961904761904762

4469251,5,B004UMAPUO,"I love tales of Roman or Arthurian Britain, but I never expected to see one that was
also a buddy movie. Other reviewers can fill you in on the plot, but watch out for
spoilers, because there are quite a few surprises here. The main thing is how well
the movie is put together, how beautifully photographed and how well acted. It was
odd that, with all of Scotland to travel through, various characters never had any trouble
hooking up with each other, even in little culs-de-sac far off the highway. I found it
very offbeat, too, that a tribe of primitive Scots dressed, moved, tracked, and danced very like
American Indians do in the more ambitious westerns. Somehow I expected something
more...well, not Brigadoon exactly, but certainly something more Scottish in flavor.
Anyway, this is quite a thriller. The whole last half will have you on the edge of your
seat.",1398902400,,868,4.717105263157895

4469257,4,B004UMAPUO,I usually do not like watching Tatum Channing but found 'The Eagle' to be a very good movie.  It seems to sort of copy 'The Last Legion' somewhat (with Colin Firth which I loved!).  The Roman Legion outfit is in one of their farthest outposts (in ancient England) and they have to fight the people up there who are pretty wild & barbaric.  No need for me to rehash this for you.  Just watch it.  It held MY attention.,1395360000,,417,4.227848101265823
4469258,3,B004UMAPUO,"The book ""The Eagle of the Ninth"" was great. The movie ""The Eagle"" was very well done. Unfortunately, it doesn't match the book at all. All the characters and some of the plot were in the movie, but the movie departed from some very key plot lines and created plot parts that are not even in the book (suddenly Marcus is Esca's slave???).

This time the storyline tries to solve the mystery of the slaughter of the Legion and to retrieve the 'Eagle', the golden emblem of the IXth.

It's another enjoyable movie to watch but don't expect a history lesson.  It is, after all, nothing more than a movie.",1394582400,,534,6.47887323943662

4469263,4,B004UMAPUO,"This movie surprised me.  I didn't expect much more than Hollywood
revisionist history.  The story, of
course, is a Hollywood version of a true event but the script is welk-written and the plot believable.  Channing Tatum is quite good in the movie.  For historical accuracy,
this is not recommended.  But for entertainment set in a period of time that romanticizes war, alliances, cruelty, acquisition by force; this movie captures the state
of human development at it's best and worst.",1393459200,,487,5.113924050632911
4469264,3,B004UMAPUO,"There's some blatant homo-eroticism imagery which I just found patently humorous to the point of laughing out loud when I watched this film.  If the movie wanted to make a statement about homosexuality in the Roman empire, or among military types, then why not just make that movie?  I don't get it.

I'm not gay myself, so I wasn't sure where this movie was going.  But, much to my surprise, instead of exploring that social issue, the movie trudges forward on a conventional note, and then actually tries to inject traditional heterosexual romantic intrigue into the film, which really had me scratching my head.  I mean, what was this film supposed to be about anyway?

All in all, plot wise, it's about the disappearance and reforming the 9th to confront a Cherokee like knockoff of some tribal Picts that are marauding the northern lands.

The battle scenes are okay, but, as usual, the good guys pay such a heavy price that it's a wonder that this film was made ata all with the title in mind.  Oh well.

Give it a shot if you're into historical military films.  It might prove interesting.",1392940800,,1096,4.661458333333333

4469277,5,B004UMAPUO,"This is a wonderful movie.  It's a journey of a young man in search of the truth behind the disappearance of his father, and a Roman legion several years before.  The movie is based on Rosemary Sutcliff's book, The Eagle of the Ninth.  The book is fantastic and the movie does it justice.  We added this to our library and have watched it a few times.  It's great historical fiction  - you will learn a great deal about that period in history and enjoy a wonderful story in the process.",1389571200,,486,4.344444444444444
4469278,4,B004UMAPUO,"This kind of movie usually isn't my cup of tea, but I was patient and stayed with it while the plot fell into place, and Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell (a star since 2000's ""Billy Elliot"") definitely surprise and are both formidable actors in this heavyweight Roman epic that looks like it was made just for them (though Bell slightly out-acts Tatum).  The original story also keeps you guessing, as I doubt you've seen one like it before.  Donald Sutherland (father of Kiefer Sutherland, TV's ""24"") is also very good, as usual, in a supporting role (curiously, though, there are no major female roles, either as leads or in supporting roles).  It's sad that such a grand, fantastic spectacle like this with such great performances flopped at the box office while, instead, vampires and ""Madea"" are raking it in; I don't get it.  ""The Eagle"" is a welcome surprise and deserves high praise.",1388793600,3,888,4.784313725490196

4469282,5,B004UMAPUO,"Pretty accurate on Roman and Celt tactics, and made a point of giving both sides. Everybody is guilty of barbarism.

It is violent, but not gratuitous.

It accurately shows this was a time where when you stabbed someone, it was considered civilized to then slit their throat so they wouldn't suffer a slow death.

The natives speak Gaelic, and they are subtitled, and this gives an eerie realism that wouldn't otherwise be there.",1387756800,,429,4.8493150684931505

4469285,4,B004UMAPUO,"We read the book, Eagle of the Ninth, as a family read-aloud, and really enjoyed it.  We were quite excited when The Eagle came out, and checked the DVD out from the library.  I enjoyed the movie enough that I bought a copy of the DVD and watched it again.  The first part of the movie was pretty true to the book, though I was disappointed that the wolf was left out altogether.  I am very glad that we read the book first, because that was how we knew what was really behind all that went on in the movie.

I thought the director did a subtle yet compelling job portraying the respect the men developed for Marcus after he called the nighttime attack.  They went from grumbling and derisive to respectful and admiring, and for good reason.  If you didn't pay too much attention to Donald Sutherland, the time Marcus spent at his uncle's house gave us some important information and background as well.  When Marcus and Esca leave, their journey is a bit vague, but if you work at it you can get past that.  However, when the Seal People showed up painted completely blue (or rather, more of a blue-gray) and looking more like American Indians than Celts, the movie dropped in my estimation.  The Britons at the beginning of the film were well portrayed, but the Seal People . . .

I always have a hard time writing movie reviews, because I don't like to say things that will spoil someone's surprise when they watch it.  Had I not read the book, the departure from the story would not have bothered me.  The portrayal of the Painted (Seal) People really did bother us though, as my son has studied Celtic history fairly extensively.  He almost left when they showed up, but we convinced him to stay and watch the rest of the movie, though we did have to ask him to groan a bit more softly.

He did inform us that the Celts did not paint their entire bodies solid blue, but instead painted spiral designs on their bodies, and the paint was bright blue, not a dingy blue-gray.  They also combed lime through their hair to make it spiky, and their hair was typically shorter cropped in the front and sides, and their hair color was more likely in the brown range, not black.  They certainly did not wear their hair in mohawks!  They did not wear ""Indian"" bone necklaces either.  And our Roman friend towered over most of the Celts, but in reality the Celts were actually much taller than the Romans.

The Painted People in the movie had weapons that looked suspiciously like tomahawks.  The real Celts were masters at iron work, and would not have carried stone weapons.  The Celts were also pretty good horsemen, yet the Seals pursued their enemy on foot, from Northern Scotland to the far south - Hadrian's Wall.  I don't believe I've ever heard of anyone being able to jog the entire length (north to south) of Scotland in five days.

It seems to me that if a teenaged boy can find out these things, that a big Hollywood director should be able to do the same, especially since he probably has other people he can send to do the research.  Perhaps he was just appealing to what the majority of people think of when they think of ""savages"" (to quote a character in the film).  Many people are not going to know much about this part of history, so it may not bother them.

Also, in the book, Marcus was disguised as a Greek eye ""doctor"", which is what allowed him to move around without being killed.  He actually helped quite a few people, and grew to feel pleasure and pride in what he was doing for them.  In the movie, he was just a Roman riding around with a Celt, and that was that.  In reality, the chances of that happening were not very good.

That being said, I was able to look past all this and enjoy the movie, and I especially enjoyed the development of friendship, trust, and true loyalty between Marcus and Esca.  I could have done without the ""ethereal"" flashbacks that were scattered here and there, always with eerie music.  But I really liked the comeuppance dealt to the ""politician's son"" at the end of the movie.

I really appreciated the fact that there was not a major woman's role written into the script.  For crying out loud, it is not necessary to put a woman in a story that didn't have one in the first place.  I find it irritating and patronizing when this occurs in movies, and I say kudos to the director for keeping the story what it was, a story of men.  That being said, the movie ignored Cottia completely.  I don't think the movie was any worse for that, but if you read the book you did find yourself wondering what had happened to her in the movie.

I thought that Tatum did a fine job of portraying Marcus.  The main character was a brooding man, because the shadow of his father's disgrace had haunted him his entire life.  I thought that he brought forth that brooding and pensiveness quite well, keeping his turmoil and emotions tightly controlled and maintaining his ""Roman-ness"".

In the book, Marcus and Esca developed a true and deep friendship, but it was rockier in the movie.  The scene where they tumble off their horses to fight one another could not have happened in the book - in fact, it didn't.  The end of the movie did manage to show some of the depth of their friendship, though it came as a bit of a surprise after the mistrust that had been prevalent through most of the movie.

Because in and of itself, The Eagle is an exciting film and it tells a good story, I rate it 4 stars.  I enjoyed the movie the first time I watched it, and I enjoyed it again this afternoon, when I watched it for the second time.",1386892800,4,5571,4.4017595307917885
4469286,4,B004UMAPUO,"I had never heard of this film until I came across it on cable.  I thoroughly enjoy historical period pieces--especially those centered around the Roman Empire--so I pulled up a chair to watch THE EAGLE, the story about Rome's IX Legion disappearing in what is now Scotland, north of Hadrian's Wall in the Second Century.  It's also the story of Roman officer Marcus Flavius Aquila (Channing Tatum), whose father commanded the IX Legion, who ventures north of the wall to find the legion's emblem, a golden eagle, accompanied by his slave Esca (Jamie Bell), who happens to be a member of the native Brigantes tribe.  (And as such, despises Rome.)  To Marcus, retrieving the eagle will restore his family's honor, plus he may learn what became of his father, and of the legion.  Yet it's a dangerous journey, as the natives are extremely hostile, and suspicious of Esca's intentions.

I enjoy authenticity, and this was a gritty, brutal time in which to live, and THE EAGLE takes no shortcuts.  The violence is graphic, the conditions primitive, the emotions raw.  Skilled actors Donald Sutherland and Mark Strong comprise the main portion of the secondary characters, and it's good they are in this film, as Channing just isn't solid enough to anchor an historical epic such as this.  He was definitely the weak link.  And at over 220 minutes the film is too long, and bogs down here and there as it moves towards its predictable (yet satisfying) ending.  Yet the vistas (you can't go wrong with Scotland), the action, the story, and the ever-growing friendship of Marcus and Esca, make THE EAGLE a grand historical tale not to be missed.

As well the props/costumes and cinematography were on a similar par IMO (and it's hard to beat Scotland for scenery). At any rate this flick is profoundly better than ""Centurion"" which is about the same subject but from a slightly different perspective, and if you are looking for something in the Roman-Britain genre, I would choose it over ""King Arthur"" (even with Keera Knightly).

4469295,5,B004UMAPUO,"I was very entertained by this movie which reflects the mystery of the lost 9th Legion of the early 2nd century which led to the building of Hadrians Wall in Northern England.
I have been to the area in England several times in my life but over the last few years after viewing this film set out to explore the stories of the Roman occupation.  This occupation occurred from 43 to 407 AD.  There are many ruins related and attributed to the 9th Legion which was last based in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire prior to their alleged disappearance.
This story was obtained from a novel of the same name which has some historical grounding.  As a Greco-Roman descendant I can understand the pride of Marcus Aquila in restoring the honor of his Roman family, but as the movie continues the viewer develops compassion for Esca, his family, and his heritage of the Celts and Picts of Northern England.
The end of the story finds both Marcus and Esca uniting to obtain the mission of securing the Eagle, the standard of the lost 9th Legion.  The viewer feels for both cultures and their respective struggles in the ancient world.  Both fierce enemies become friends for an accomplishment which was thought impossible. The scenery of Northern Britain and Scotland is worth the price of the film.

4469307,4,B004UMAPUO,"The Eagle, I have to say, impressed me.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kevin-MacDonald/dp/B000MVXB26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kevin MacDonald</a>&nbsp;keeps the film on slow-burn tension, with gorgeous cinematography, realistic costumes and settings, and a fine cast (minus the Channing). I felt it was a real old-school epic; little to no CGI, lots of extras, real sets, gorgeously lush and atmospheric locations, a simpleminded but rousing storyline about a man who puts honor and the safety of his men first, and some good old fashioned action.

A pity then, that it's lead,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Channing-Tatum/dp/B0096HIEE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Channing Tatum</a>, is so...uninspired. He really shows no emotional arc or even any emotion, period, in the film. His drama scenes fall flat, and his accent is as lost as the legion. Don't get me wrong, I thought he was great in the fighting scenes; a good-looking, sword-wielding centurion, but I wished there was a more mature actor in the role of Marcus Decimus Merid--erm...Marcus Flavius Aquila. Thankfully, he is backed up by a more than able cast.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jamie-Bell/dp/B001Q7JD5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jamie Bell</a>&nbsp;gives a subtle, sympathetic, and excellent performance as the slave Esca, and his relationship with Aquila is riveting and interesting. He was perhaps the highlight of the film. This is a mature actor that we all want to see more of.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donald-Sutherland/dp/B007QJ83KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donald Sutherland</a>&nbsp;is an accomplished actor, so there was no reason he had to use his Canadian accent instead of a more authentic, or at least believable, ""Roman"" accent. I'm kidding, there is no such thing as a Roman accent, but at least a British one would be less jarring. Still, he is beyond criticism.

The big highlight for me, though, was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mark-Strong/dp/B0038P59A0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mark Strong</a>&nbsp;as Gurn. Strong is one of my favourite actors. He's incredibly talented and versatile, tough, cool, and always gives a nuanced, scene-stealing performance. He was the high point of the film, and his deserting legionary was an engaging, interesting, and awesome character.

The villains are dastardly. Painted, tattooed, plumed, dressed in seal skins and carrying weapons of wood, flint, bone, and salvaged steel, the Seal People are both effectively interesting, realistic, and menacing. The film isn't really clear on who's bad and who's good. Like most wars, both sides have their tragedies and heroes, and both sides are relateable and sympathetic once you hear their side of the story.

From a technical viewpoint, the film is superb. The cinematography is grand and realistic. The world of The Eagle is a world of wet dark forests, moors, glens, tall mountains, and cold and mud and heather and fire. It is incredibly atmospheric; so much so it's surprising how much a film that did not connect at the box office, or with critics can linger in the mind. There are images I remember even now; Marcus Aquila standing wounded by the Eagle standard, the funeral pyre of a beloved warrior, sparks floating into the sky, the last stand of the Ninth Legion, the endless moors divided by Hadrian's Wall - the end of the world.

The costumes are incredible; authentic, lived-in, muddied in, well-researched and period accurate. The armour of the Roman legionnaire's are scuffed and worn, muddied and bloodied. The Celts and Britons wear furs, bound roughly with thick thread, homespun, and wool.

The action, when it comes, is engaging and well shot, though at times I wished for less shaky-cam. It is frantic, frenetic, down and dirty brawling with swords and clubs and bows. The contestants always seem real to us, so we wince when one falls. The final battle was very memorable and haunting.

Let's talk cons. Number one, the screenplay. It sags near the middle, with the recovering Marcus, and at times feels like it should be more action-packed. But as I said, The Eagle is not over the top and in your face, but more subtle and slow-burning. Number two, the convenient arrival of the last remnants of the Ninth is both unrealistic and smells of Hollywood cheese, as does Tatum's final one-liner (""What shall we do next?"" ""You decide""). And I already mentioned Tatum's acting. He must have confused the worlds solid and laconic with ""do nothing and stare pinefully into the camera.""

But on the whole, The Eagle remains a pleasant surprise. Kevin MacDonald is an adept director whose film is visually stunning, technically excellent, very realistic, dramatic, and atmospheric. Tatum's performance is best when he has a sword in his hand, decapitating people, but the rest of the actors are excellent, turning in subtle, sympathetic roles. The story may, at times, lack drive or action and smell of uncharacteristic sentimentality, it is, on the whole, an old-school, refreshingly realistic sword-and-sandals adventure! Colour me impressed.

My rating? Four eagles out of five.

Tatum does a decent job with the role as Marcus Aquila and Bell was amazing as Esca. One disappointing change was that Esca was not freed until Aquila had used him all he could, which made Marcus rather despicable.

4469313,5,B004UMAPUO,"""The Eagle"" is based on ""Eagle of the Ninth"", a children's book by Rosemary Sutcliff.  For the most part, the story stays true to the book.  ""Eagle of the Ninth"" is historical fiction based on two facts: 1. A wingless Roman-era eagle was uncovered near Silchester, England, 2. The Ninth Legion no longer appears in historical records in 165 AD.  As it turns out, the eagle found was not a Legionary eagle, and the Ninth Legion DOES appear in present-day the Netherlands and Germany after their supposed destruction.  But thanks to Sutcliff, many believe the Ninth was destroyed in northern Britain in the year 117.

I am a history nut.  Sutcliff did an excellent job of bringing Roman Britain to life, and Montgomery does the same in ""The Eagle"".  This is a manly film about honor and courage.  Think ""Blackhawk Down"", but with swords and shields.  I can't believe how underappreciated this film is, I suppose because it is history too far removed from us today.  My biggest problem with the film is the ""Seal People"".  They are a tribe wholly invented, though Montgomery claims to have based them on historical finds.  He could just as easily identified the Caledonii or other northern tribes as keepers of the eagle after the Ninth's defeat.  The other disappointment was the lack of ""camp followers"" surrounding the Roman fort in the film.  Sutcliff describes in great detail the towns that arose around Roman forts, local merchants seeking to profit from the soldiers, and the wives and mistresses of the soldiers who were always camped just outside fort walls.  In all other respects this movie is Roman-era Britain come to life.",1372118400,2,1634,4.8483754512635375
4469314,5,B004UMAPUO,"I bought this film not knowing anything about it and not having heard of it before, so in watching it I had no anticipations or expectations. I really enjoyed this clever, witty, interesting film all-told and enjoyed the story and idea behind it too.

Although it's ostensibly a story about Rome in Britain, I think it's also basically about a friendship between people from completely different walks of life and perspectives; it could be a kind of buddy movie too. The story centres on a Roman Legion 'the 9th' having completely disappeared in Scotland, that wild and barbarous place, twenty years before the story begins. The son of the commander of the legion wants to find out what happened to his father and his men basically. So, the two men, one a Roman and the other a British slave go into Scotland to find some answers.

They meet, and fight with, the Picts, but eventually are befriended by a Pictish tribe, although they eventually fall foul of these too. I won't go on anymore about the plot but will say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it was well put together and executed and gave me a feel of that long past time.

One point to note; the actor who plays the Pictish king's son is Tahar Rahim, who was the lead role in the film 'A Prophet'.

4469322,4,B004UMAPUO,"It is sometimes hard to imagine that the Romans occupied Britain from around 34 BC until 410 AD. This film takes place around the year 100 AD when there were multiple wild tribes, many of Celtic ancestry, surrounding the isle of civilization that the Romans brought to the British island.  It is correct to say British when referring to the island during this period. It is not until the Anglo-Saxon invasions and occupation that the term England began to be applied. Anyway, back to the review, this is the story of a young Roman officer assigned to the British island at his own request to explore, discover, the facts around his father's disappearance along with the Roman Ninth Legion which his father led.  One nice touch in the movie is the contrast between the Mediterranean style villas and gardens as compared to the animal skin huts of the wild tribes. The Romans brought written language, law, procedures, and a host of other technologies that helped them subdue the British wilderness. The story is a fairly predictable tale of adventure, of conflicts and misunderstandings revolved, of escape from danger and setting the world right again. It is an adventure tale and in my opinion was pretty well told. The primeval forests and rocky coasts of Britain are beautifully photographed.  Roman soldiers who served for 12 years were given a farm in a conquered nation and the rough soldiers certainly earn their living when stationed on the outskirts of the Empire in Britain.

Channing Tatum does a respectable job of acting in the film as does Jamie Bell. Channing Tatum, as Marcus Flavius Aquila, is the son of the commanding officer of the Ninth Legion who crossed Hadrian's Wall and entered the depths of wild Caledonia. Aquila shows considerable leadership skills and bravery, is given honors and an honorable discharge, but then decides to stay in Britain to solve the mystery of the missing legion and the fate of his father, whose reputation has been disgraced by the disappearance of a full legion of men. The film is also about the relationship between Centurion Aquila and his Celtic slave, Esca, played by Jaime Bell. Together they cross Hadrian's wall and enter the wilderness north of the Roman territories.

The film is successful because it is not overly ambitious. There is a story to tell, characters to be developed, and this it does with realistic depictions of hand to hand warfare and the dirty living conditions of life at this time. Neither the Romans nor Celts are depicted as evil, just men in conflict with men, occupiers against the occupied.

Donald Sutherland plays the uncle of Aquila with wit and humor. The striking Tahar Rahim plays the son of the tribal chief of the Seal People who play a major role in the issue of whether the Roman Ninth Legion regains its honor.

4469325,5,B004UMAPUO,"Here is a film that was almost tailor-made for the lead actor.  Tatum just about radiates the forceful, violent, yet all too human macho-male.  This story line has been told and re-told so very many times.  The story of the complete diappearace of the Ninth Legion in Britain has developed almost a legend onto itself.  What is different is the love story that is told adjacent to the main.  It actually provided the audience with a characteristic aside from the main turmoil and violence.  It is just an under current to the main theme but shows the audience of how two men in totally different backgrounds become inseparably bonded together.  No, there is no overt behavior or sex but, the the sub-current is there to see, especially how it developes.  This main story line is about honor and the loss of it in the loss of the Eagle Stantard of the Ninth Legion by his father.  Your can call it a quest, crusade, cause de celebre but, these two men are totally immeresed in this single minded action.  Of all the films that have been made about the Lost Legion, this one has the most telling picture of the human side of the story.  This film, while very violent at times, shows the level of life during these troubled times.  Unless you have studied the early cultures of Britain, you cannot appreciate the magnificient pictures that are created in this film.  That, along with the inter action of the Romans gives an unbelievable scenerio a life of its own.  Take the one you cherish and love to see this flix.

4469327,3,B004UMAPUO,"There were some good parts of this movie, some bad parts, and one part I really just cannot stand.  I was tempted to give it two stars, but I did sit through the whole thing and I never felt the urge to get up and leave (mind you, I rented it from the library, so it would have been very easy to go ""nope, watching the NCIS marathon instead"").

**MINOR SPOILERS**

Good parts:  Channing Tatum actually does look like a Roman statue.  While not always very realistic, the look lends itself to a Hollywood production.  You can definitely see him as a Roman commander.  His acting was not exactly award winning, but I didn't find it to be bad the way some other reviewers have (there is some BAAAAAD acting in this, which I will point out later).  I found the premise of the story to be very interesting and realistic enough to warrant belief, but farfetched enough to make a great story.  Romans really were very honor conscious; soldiers especially were attached to the eagles they carried with them.  It's the same idea as battle flags in the 18th and 19th century:  losing them was a huge disgrace to a unit.  Another great story about someone trying to redeem their unit's honor is Bernard Cornwell's ""Sharpe's Eagle.""  Something I really liked was having the Celts speaking some sort of Celtic language (I'm assuming it's modern Scottish Gaelic or Welsh, though I would be thoroughly impressed if they actually used Old Brythonic).  Another reviewer noted that Esca (Tatum's slave/sidekick) seemed to know all the languages of the world, making this very unrealistic.  Actually, it's not as unrealistic as it might seem.  Many of the British Celtic languages had not diverged as much as they have today and would have been fairly mutually intelligible to each other.  Also, as a slave and gladiator, he probably would have picked up Latin fairly quickly just as a survival measure.  So, I'd say Esca's character is pretty realistic.  The movie also just in general looks good.  Nice scenery, decent costuming (I don't know enough about Roman uniforms to know how accurate those were, but they seemed close enough from the little I do know).

Not so good / bad parts:  A lot of the acting is mediocre at best.  Sutherland especially just seems bored and ready to be done.  The actor playing Gurn (sp?), the Roman-soldier-deserter-turned-Celt, is probably the worst of the bunch.  Every time he spoke, I rolled my eyes.  His acting was at the level of a middle school play.  In general though, the acting in this movie is mediocre at best and pretty terrible at worst.

BAAAAAAAD part:  The ending.  Tatum brings in the eagle, drops it on a table, restores his honor, and is offered command of the legion.  Then, he and Esca are about to leave.  Esca asks, ""What next?""  Tatum:  ""I don't know, you decide this time."" (or something like that).  They walk out the doors together into the sunset, ready for more adventures.  ....  I feel like they just took a scene from a western, slapped togas and tunics on the cowboys, and they strut out of the saloon to find another train robbery to stop.  This is about as lame as it gets and I feel like the director didn't know how to end the movie and just slapped this in.  If this were done as an Indiana Jones style movie (Indianus Jonius?), this would make sense, but it's not!  Give the movie an ending it deserves!

Overall assessment:  Meh.  This is definitely not on par with ""Gladiator"" by any stretch of the imagination, but I think it is worth at least one viewing, in spite of the ending.",1362355200,,3541,4.61637239165329

4469329,5,B004UMAPUO,"My fascination for the Roman occupation in Anglo and Celtic lands was brought to life beautifully.  The scenes of the seal people and the lost father who has joined them (and bears the missing father's ring) were not only visually captivating but very creative.  The bond between the two protagonists (ex-slave and retired legionnaire) shows the bonds between two people despite the disharmony of the empire vs its occupied subjects.  The beauty and mystery of wild Scotland blows the mind.

Overall, I felt that Channing Tatum's performance was masterful in its subtle dignity--not overdramatic and not too ham-headed.  Jamie Bell was stellar as usual, and his lesser stature was jarring only physically.  The inequality of his people against the physical superiority of a bunch of Roman soldiers seems so overwhelming, but regardless of sides, the heroes of the film show far more than a physical strength.  The elderly return to fight out of brotherhood, the weak arise to die in the ring rather than fight a gladiator for the Roman audience's amusement, and a slight young companion becomes a formidable  secret ally in a few tight spots...loyal beyond common sense, quick-witted, and able to keep the deepest secret to protect his best friend's vision of his own father.

The ending was a freeze-frame and completely dorky...but it was fun fun fun.  It gives ya energy...and if you can handle the cheese you'll enjoy the classical beauty and depth in the bargain.  Don't forget that along with the famous Jamie Bell, you get an awesome side character in Donald Sutherland.  You'll also see a familiar Roman face...the guy who sold and rebought the ponies in True Grit.",1361404800,,1673,5.021739130434782
4469330,2,B004UMAPUO,"I'm not articulate enough to really explain what is wrong with this movie besides the acting. First of all, the Romans were the bad guys. Why is this film putting you on the side of the bad guys? And why does the Celtic slave suddenly change his mind and decide to help the Roman? It was a completely spontaneous moment that made no sense. And why IS it noble for a slave to have loyalty to his keeper against his own people. Just stupid.
Also, let's be clear. The Picts were not Native Americans. The inappropriate co-opting of Native American imagery to dress up the Picts was annoying. The mohawks and tomahawks were out of line. It was like Dances With Wolves against the Pawnee.",1361145600,,683,4.472
4469331,5,B004UMAPUO,"Rarely does a film adapation of a novel transcend the story.  Brock's focus in THE EAGLE did.  Where Sutcliff's YA novel merely skimmed events, the movie focused on the more credible complex human relationships resulting from those events. The conflict of disparity was intense throughout the entire film, just as it needs to be to create enthralling cinematic drama.  Any warrior culture depends on living a code of honor and this film delivered that view of honor and the ultimate test of male bonding from beginning to end.  This film needs to reside in a lexicon of movie classics as the epitome of successful  adaptation. The directing, editing, acting by Tatum & Bell and cinematography were close to perfect.",1361059200,,715,4.974789915966387

The attention to detail and casting for Braveheart is not comparable to this film. I do not dislike any of the actors but I think this story would have made more sense if the actors at least spoke the dialogue of the time period they are attempting to portray. At one point during the movie a native american (sounding) score was played which reminded me of a cherokee chant.

Also the angles were adjusted to excessively minimize the costs of production. It was no fun to watch since the camera tended to cut away when someone would get injured in the fighting scenes.",1360022400,,860,4.657894736842105

I speculate, but given the wave of films that attempt tie Rome to pivotal myths in British history - we'll eventually find a legion's eagle at The Battle of Hastings.

For a guy who started out as an Abercrombie & Fitch model, he did a fine job in this movie.  Some reviews here have called his acting ""wooden"", but Roman soldiers were manly stoics and he represents that sort of masculinity very well.  Plus, his natural athleticism brings a lot to the role.

Frankly, I'm glad the guy is around.  Hollywood needs his type of leading man - there are only so many metrosexual actors one nation can stand.

As for the film itself, it had its flat spots, but the screenplay was believable and the action sequences were satisfying.  There was one long scene that had me chuckling - when the primitive Scottish Seal People warriors were performing their drunken coming-of-age dance ceremony, I couldn't help musing that it looked like a homoerotic modern British rave party, but with fewer tattoos.",1354924800,,931,4.78125

Rather, what makes the movie compelling is the unlikely friendship encased in stoic old-world mannishness and the uneasy alliance that comes to exist between Tatum's Marcus Flavius Aquila and his barbarian servant Esca (played by a fierce Jamie Bell).  These two move through many relational phases (owner-slave; slave come to power over owner; mutual admirers; brothers-in-arms; friends and, finally, equals) that are played out with nuance and sincerity and natural connection to the circumstances that they are involved in.

Channing Tatum plays Marcus Aquila, who is determined to get the symbol returned for gods and empire, lost by his father. In the beginning he assumes command of the Britain outpost. His men see him as a little ""wet behind the ears."" However, his attention to detail and heroics save the fort.

In one early scene, it wasn't safe to send out a patrol because a Druid priest was going about the villages. hmmm. Marcus is injured and is moved to a hospital, given numerous awards for bravery and discharged because of his wounds. He saves the life of a slave, Eska, who lets it known he hates Rome and everything Marcus stands for. Marcus, joined by his new slave go on a mission to cross Hadrian's Wall and recover the lost golden eagle, thus restoring honor to  Rome and his father.

While Marcus talks about the glory of Rome, Eska talks about their atrocities and how his family was slain at their hand and lands stolen. About this point in the fictional narrative one should figure out the tale is meant to be symbolic for our own country.

4469360,5,B004UMAPUO,"This seems to be one controversial movie reading all the reviews that have been written about it, but I'm going to give my two cents here as well. Rosemary Sutcliff is one of my favorite author's, if not my favorite, and I thought that, while this movie was not exactly like the book, it was still a good version of the story, and it didn't not do justice to Sutcliff's story. At least the characters were in character. I thought Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell made a very good Marcus and Esca, especially Jamie Bell. He has that thin chiseled look that it so very Celtic. And by the way, all you people who think there's any ""romantic"" interest between these two, don't you know what platonic brotherly love is? Does anyone anymore? Marcus and Esca had an amazing BROTHERLY relationship. The movie and book was about brotherhood despite the fact that Esca was British and Marcus Roman. Anyone who says differently is shallow and please stop saying it because you are ruining it for everyone else!

There were a few things that I have to point out. One is that as much as I love the Gaelic language, they probably wouldn't have spoken it, besides the Pictish clans in the far North. And Esca, being a Brigantes, (which were from modern day Northumberland/Yorkshire area) would probably not have had cause to learn Gaelic. Their language was more like Welsh. But I'm not one to nit pick in movies like this, not when they have such lovely scenery. The wildness of Scotland, went so well with the costuming in this movie and the amazing score to create something that actually looked like it was from the wild, harsh yet beautiful days of Roman Britain.

I do wish they had kept several elements of the book though, top of my list would be Marcus' love interest, Cottia. I don't mind that this was a brotherhood story without a lead female character, but it might have kept certain immiture people from thinking Marcus and Esca were gay. Also I totally loved their wolf pup, Cub, in the book. I also wish there had been more between them and Tribune Placidus (I actually wish one of them had gotten to slug him, but I guess that would have been a breech in rank ;)

Besides the few flaws, this is still one of my favorite movies. I rarely buy movies, but this was one I felt I had to add to my collection. If you love Scotland like me, then buying this movie for the landscape alone is worth it. I really hope this is not the only of Rosemary Sutcliff's books that they make into movies.",1338768000,5,2484,4.466960352422907

Some reviewers here have called it a ""bromance"" between the two main characters--Aquila the Roman legionnaire and Esca his British slave--and I did notice the curious absence of any women who played any real part in the film, although I suspect that at this time --in terms of power and ""agency""--it really was a man's world.

This movie had great, evocative cinematography, sweeping scenery, and very nice score.  I thought the acting was pretty good (and especially Donald Sutherland), and I liked, too, the better than usual attempt to recreate a sense of life in 2nd century A.D. Britain, including the scruffy look of the Roman fort and the legionnaires manning it, which I suspect was probably accurate.

From what I have read, not a tremendous lot is known about the details of life among the various British tribes during the Roman occupation, and I suspect that the ""rogue"" warriors of the ""Seal People""--who were very reminiscent of American woodland Indians--were just made up.

*SPOILER ALERT*

My chief problem with this film was the use of a ""deus ex machina"" to save the day when all looked hopeless i.e. Aquila,  with essential help from Esca, had miraculously stolen back the Roman Eagle of the IX Legion right out of the middle of the Seal People's camp and killed their Chieftain, who had killed Aquila's father.  The two were being pursued by what looked like 50-75 rogue warriors, and during a five day scramble South to reach Hadrian's wall the two eventually exhausted their horses and were reduced to fleeing on foot, Aquila was injured and bleeding, soaked to the bone and unable to continue, and the rogue warriors were closing in.  Just in the nick of time, Esca, who Aquila had just given his freedom--and who had run off to get help, miraculously showed up with a couple dozen old men with their swords, shields, and dressed in bits and pieces of armor who were the survivors of the annihilated IX Legion, who then fought and killed the rogue warriors with great loss of life among the old Roman soldiers, allowing the legionnaire and his now freed slave to return the Eagle to Roman control.",1337472000,,2303,4.7808564231738035

4469364,3,B004UMAPUO,"Inspired by the Roman Ninth Legion's mysterious disappearance in the year 120 AD (which served as a loose basis for Neil Marshall-directed ""Centurion"" starring Michael Fassbender), ""The Eagle"" follows the story of a young Roman soldier Marcus Flavius Aquila (Channing Tatum), who intends to restore his family's dignity by recovering the lost golden eagle standard. To do so, Marcus enters deep into the forbidden territories with a British slave Esca (Jamie Bell), whose life he saved.

Based on a Rosemary Sutcliff book ""The Eagle of the Ninth"" published in 1954, ""The Eagle"" is a story of war as well as friendship. The action sequences with brutal close combat fighting are expertly handled without relying on computer graphics, and the story of Marcus and Esca is fairly credible. Director Kevin Macdonald (""Last King of Scotland""), however, fails to infuse life into other characters including Guern played by Mark Strong, a talented actor again wasted because of underwritten character.

One good thing about the film is that there is no romantic subplot, a mistake that many historical adventure films have committed. ""The Eagle"" (shot in Scotland and Hungary) also benefits from the photography of Anthony Dod Mantle (""Slumdog Millionaire"") that captures the beauty and harshness of the nature.

Yes, photography is very good, and so is the storyline, but they are still not good enough to completely overwhelm the ""been there done that"" feeling we occasionally have, and Macdonald's rather uninspired direction in describing the hero's attempt to recover the family's honor.",1333756800,,1584,5.328
4469365,4,B004UMAPUO,"Having its release pushed back to avoid Centurion and its title changed from The Eagle of the Ninth because someone in market research thought it sounded like a golf picture, Kevin MacDonald's The Eagle didn't find much luck at the box-office, which is a shame because this adaptation of Rosemary Sutcliff's much-loved Roman novel is a terrific and almost entirely satisfy old-school adventure story. Channing Tatum is the centurion who asks for a post at the very edge of the empire on the Scottish border in hopes of covering his family name with so much honor and glory it'll drown out the shame that has attached itself to it since his father led the Ninth Legion to an unknown fate north of what would become Hadrian's Wall. Despite getting off to a good start by winning over his men and saving his fortress from attack not once but twice, his career is over almost as soon as its begun when he is invalided out of the legion. Recuperating at his uncle Donald Sutherland's villa where he saves the life of a British slave (Jamie Bell), he sees a chance to challenge fate and redeem the family's honor when rumors start that the Eagle standard of the Ninth Legion have been seen beyond the wall...

Andrew MacDonald's film is very much a classic old-fashioned adventure film seen through modern eyes but managing to avoid many of the clich&eacute;s of the genre, old and new. It reverses the classic casting approach by almost entirely using American actors instead of British ones for the Romans (with the exception of Mark Strong's Dennis Hopper-like legionary gone native), a conceit which works surprisingly well. Aside from a misjudged shot of a ranting druid and a brief fight with some rogue warriors it avoids the excesses of shakeycam and overediting for a smoother visual approach to the action scenes, the desaturated photography managing to turn the Hungarian and Scottish locations into something that looks almost like a lost world while just managing to avoid the tiresome orange and teal visual clich&eacute;s of most modern action films. There's even a nicely imaginative use of sound in the climax when the sounds of the final battle are reduced not to the usual silence and soaring orchestral chords but those of the two central combatants in a sequence where the audio briefly becomes more impressive than the visuals. Much of the big action is at the front of the picture, slightly unbalancing it for those hoping for the kind of big action movie it seems to start out as, the scale shrinking as the focus narrows and the landscape conversely expands, but it never feels like its dragging its heels or padding things out.

The film initially manages to give a good sense of how the ancient Roman world worked without letting the details get in the way of the story before plunging into the dark savage world beyond the wall, where hard country breeds harsh tribes with more in common with Native Americans than the usual righteous oppressed locals fighting the empire for their freedom. Indeed, when the hero and his slave go on the run pursued by the relentless Mohican-like Seal People, you could easily be watching a Western. Yet even here the film manages to avoid falling into easy good guy-bad guy stereotyping, with Tahir Rahim excellent as their relentless nemesis, managing to create a believable and human character despite having little to work with. Nor does the film opt for an easy hero/villain position on Rome itself, choosing to stake its colors on heroism and courage on either side. Those expecting an epic or a relentless action movie may be disappointed, but as a large-scale old-fashioned adventure, all in all it's rather terrific.

The US Blu-ray offers a decent 2.40:1 widescreen transfer of both the theatrical and unrated cuts, director's commentary on the unrated cut, a perhaps slightly better alternate ending that gives the Eagle itself more value than the one finally used, a couple of deleted scenes (one explaining why Douglas Henshall gets prominent billing for just a couple of shots as a charioteer who Tatum kills: the rest of his part never made the final cut) an d a making of featurette. Universal's European Blu-ray only includes the unrated version but does include a more substantial 48-minute making of documentary that didn't make the US release.",1332806400,,4318,4.888130968622101
4469366,5,B004UMAPUO,"The previous 92 reviews raise many of the problems with this nevertheless excellent film, yet I hope that I can add something.

When people nitpick a lot about films that have a lot going for them, it looks like the film is not working on some deeper level for them. One can nitpick about ANY film, but we generally let the small things go when there are bigger things that we appreciate. I do the same. I like sci-fi films and Westerns and love stories that are not completely realistic and so on if they work overall. I wish all the nitpicking reviewers of the Eagle had articulated what it was that made them dwell on the rough spots. But of course it is hard to ""know thyself"" and easier to nitpick.

What kept me involved with the film? For one thing it was beautiful to look at. There was well photographed scenery and attractive and believable sets and well photographed interactions. The Seal People were necessarily made up images, but they were great images. Donald Sutherland was wooden at times, but he made up for this overall and as a distinctive character. Etc. Channing's acting seemed right and convincing for a serious young soldier who had a special motive for being in the thick of things. The ancient Romans are said to have been serious business like people and that is how he played the lead. If he has played it as young Hamlet it would have been inappropriate.

Maybe I would have kept watching it with the sound off -- I am not completely serious, but I am trying to make a point that it was easy on the eyes.

Perhaps what really  kept me involved was that  it it was pretty clear early in the film that it was going to be character and mood driven and would not depend simply on blood and sandals spectacle.  Young men driven by honor and loyalty to do crazy things is a fascinating topic in my mind. This  part was pulled off very well in my opinion. It kept me in suspense as a matter of ""human interest"" -- how far would this kid go to get back some stupid eagle? How far would his slave go out of loyalty to his master, despite his ambiguous feelings about him to begin with? Parts of their ""buddy adventure"" could be seen as tedious but for me they just kept up the tension of when will one or the other reach a breaking point?

Obviously viewers who can not empathize with boys who go into insane war conditions out of a feeling of honor or pride in the flag and who have over the years seen many of them disillusioned would not relate to the film this way. And obviously people who do not empathize with people who go overboard out of loyalty to friends and then have seen the loyalty reach a breaking point also would not relate to the dramatic tension in the film the same way I did.

Thus one thing I want to say here is that I really appreciated the alternative endings that were presented, because they were important parts of the whole story for me. I watched the non-rated blu ray version. The theatrical ending was really lame in my opinion, but it was probably the crowd pleaser. Mission accomplished, the eagle is brought back to the big shots and then the kid has earned the right to tell them off. Cliche #10,000.

The alternative ending was also a cliche, but it was in my opinion more fitting with the rest of the film because it suggested that the boy warrior had learned something and matured from his contacts with ""the enemy."" Most superficially he had learned that the symbols were not that important and that the esteem of the rulers was not that important. What was important was people and their substance regardless of rank and honors.

This gets us around to why I say it was good enough to be controversial. The film is sell enough done to get you involved with the characters and wonder SHOULD they just keep going with honor and loyalty. Is being patriotic to Rome really worth all this? How sane is honer taken to this level, which is not entirely unrealistic for some guys. There is something admirable, and I am not putting it down. But it is debatable and worth discussing.

Yes then as former slave and master go off into the sunset all but holding hands this might look sort of corny, but it does tie things together. They had both grown into real people instead of puppets of their cultures.

Some have called their relationship homoerotic. Well, maybe. Who knows? Who cares? What would that have to do with anything? It was a buddy film, and buddies can come to love each other in buddy ways as brothers or whatever. There was intimate male bonding and that would be natural after all they had been through. Is that really corny or even unusual when you think about it? Male intimacy is still awkward for many guys in our culture, and there are some women who see male coalitions as threats. So that part of the alternative ending may have been objectionable to some because of ""deep"" psychological reasons, and it might be tempting to ""dismiss"" it as homoerotic (whatever that means). But painting labels like that is a distraction from the simple fact that the two had been though a heck of a lot and obviously had developed the trust and mutual respect to consider making a life together as partners. So this was the consistent ending in terms of the tension all along that had been working itself out in their relationship.

In addition to the alternative ending -- that I would say is a must watch -- the deleted scenes were substantial and worthwhile. The ""making of"" was better than most but not tops. I confess that I got tired of the director's commentary and stopped watching. But then I was coming down with a bug.",1331769600,11,5595,4.4555229716520035
4469367,5,B004UMAPUO,"The Eagle was a deeper and a much more penetrating drama than I had thought it would be from the reviews I read. Maybe it's me? I loved the characterizations of the leads and the interplay between them. Honor!

4469371,4,B004UMAPUO,"20 years after the disappearance of the 9th Legion in the mountains of Caledonia young centurion Marcus Aquila(Channing Tatum) has come to Hadrian's Wall to restore the reputation of his father the commander of the 9th,who never returned, and retrieve the lost Eagle of the 9th Legion. From Hadrian's Wall he sets out with Esca(Jamie Bell)his British slave,despite the warnings of his settled colleagues and uncle about the savage Pictish tribes, who painted their bodies for warfare,highland tribes existing beyond the Forth-Clyde isthmus. Sutcliffe gives them the name of The Seal People to describe their exotic alienness,half-way between Aztecs and Red Indians,speaking an alien tongue that Esca,the Brigante understands and can speak.

Marcus earlier saves Esca from death-by-gladiator, empathizing with the boy's bravery, and part of The Eagle's excitement derives from Marcus and Esca psychically sizing each other up throughout their adventure. The filmmakers don't have to linger on the atrocities that rationalize the oppressed Esca's contempt for Marcus, a representation of the arrogance of empire, because the torment is in Bell's face: how his character struggles to separate the Roman who saves him from death and the Romans who took his people's land and murdered his family. Who did what to who matters less in the end than what we promise to each other that we will become.

Roles are reversed or dissolved,Esca must play the master to Marcus's slave in order for the men to ensure their survival,also boundaries between Pict and Roman,victim and victimizer, even language. The overall theme is the need and struggle for brotherhood. Macdonald's collaging of visual planes is expressionistic, the ensuing battles between the Romans and warrior Picts are shot with a phantasmagoric intensity that foregrounds the confusion, noise, and brutality of battle, and the overall effect is closer to the existential poetry of Terrence Malick's The New World. The acting is excellent,Tatum suitably romanesque,Bell suitably British and the period detail and set design are good. Good to compare this restrained take with Centurion.",1329609600,,2139,5.459214501510574
4469372,4,B004UMAPUO,"A Roman Century varied between 80 or 100 men, depending on the timeframe.  In the context of this movie, it would've likely = 80 men.  It was led by a senior enlisted fellow who was known as a Centurion.  6 Centuries made up a Cohort, and 10 Cohorts comprised a Legion.  Why am I telling you all of this?  you ask.  Well, this terminology is used throughout the present film, so it's useful to know what they're talking about.

The movie centers around a Roman officer who is medically dishcharged (Channing Tatum) but finds himself obsessed with figuring out a way to bring honor to himself and Rome.  His father fought with the IX Legion, which disappeared north of Hadrian's Wall a few decades earlier.  Along with the Legion, its guidon (the eagle) was never found.  Recovering the Eagle might be JUST the thing to salvage his brief military career!

This is not a great movie, but it is an interesting one.  It does a good job of making you feel like you're back in England during the days of the Roman occupation > the Romans built the wall to keep the Caledonians out.  The final battle scene was a little incomplete, but for the most part this was a well done film.

So, if you're Italian (or Scottish) and / or interested in Roman history, this is a worthwhile venture to undertake.  It does point out, correctly, just how sacred the Eagle was to the Roman Legionnaires.  It's also not by accident that the symbol for the U.S. ended up being a Bald Eagle;  to the founding fathers it was an Americanized version of what the Romans hoisted to lead them into battle.",1329264000,,1573,4.482394366197183

Were they rushed through production, have problems on the set, not getting along, strung out on coke?

The main character acts like a less than intelligent protagonist and I found myself fast forwarding to get past the drawn out ..gee it's not hard to guess where this is going and how could he possibly believe that or think that...next scene.

 If you can watch the movie without thinking you may enjoy the realistic costumes and sets, the fantastic English country side. Maybe if you turn the sound off it won't seem so terribly hard to buy into. I have seen fantasy movies that were easier to believe in. Awful!",1329177600,,868,4.697368421052632

Haunted by the disappearance of his father, who vanished with the Roman Ninth Legion on an expedition into the north of Britain, centurion Marcus Aquila(Channing Tatum) sets out to unravel the mystery and recover the legions lost eagle standard.  But in the wild of Caledonia, the soldier and his British slave, Esca (Jamie Bell)encounter fierce native tribes and other dangers.

The Goods:
SPOILERS ALERT!!!
  Okay, as weird as it may sound, I like how dirty the movie is.  Not in ""bad"" dirty, but in realistic dirty.  Hey, ancient Romans would not be the cleanest of people.  The costumes were not theatrical, for a change, and the uniforms actually looked USED.  Like the soldiers wore them every day.  While on their journey, both Marcus and Esca get more ragged and dirty.  Although both of them manage to carry along those razors that come in handy on quests to keep them with five o'clock shadows.  The gladiator ring scene was great, and Esca was great.  Channing plays the role of Marcus, a stoic centurion very well, and makes a very good Roman.  Bell was AMAZING!  He plays the role of Esca beautifully.  Even though (I think) Marcus is better looking, Bell's thin, wiry looks make a good contrast.  Also he plays the role unpredictably.  I spent half the movie trying to figure out what he'd do next.  (Will he run away?  Will he try to kill Marcus?  Did he actually betray him?) He delivers some lines very different from what I thought most people would say.  For example, when he's telling how his family died, there's no yelling at all; just very soft spoken lines.  The locations were amazing(the most epic parts of the movie), and I thought the cast did a great job.  One of the best part in the movie(!!SPOILERS ALERT!!)is when Esca meets the Seal guys and tells them Marcus is his slave.  He tells them that he tricked the Roman to get him north of Hadrian's Wall.  When Esca started saying that I was thinking either he's for real, or the character is as good an actor as the actor playing Esca.  Either way, an extra scene would have cleared that up.  If he's faking hating Marcus, and says the Roman's his slave to save the guy's life, why doesn't he make some attempt to tell Marcus that?  And if he's for real at first, and only later on changes his mind about Marcus, a flashback scene would help.  Him remembering Marcus saving his life in the gladiator arena would maybe make up his mind about what to do.

The Bads:  I don't think that even if there were Seal People, they'd look like blue skinned Mohawks.  I mean, if they wore leather jackets instead of animal skins, they'd look right at home on motorcycles.  And...the battle sequences were speeded up.  Noticeably.  One of the most unbelievable part of the movie is when the Seals kill the boy that Esca befriended.  I'm not surprised that he was killed for letting them go without raising the alarm, and betraying his tribe, but you're telling me that, while trying to catch up with two guys on horseback, Seal People on foot would lug along a nine-year-old boy, JUST TO KILL HIM??!! Also,some of Channing's dialogue sound a bit stilted, like when he's talking to his dead father, or the gods, or whoever he muttering to.

And The Maybes:  During the scene where Marcus makes his first brave, (if SLIGHTLY hasty and stupid) attempt to rescue the standard, I think the Seal People's getting...I don't know...drugged up or drunk, or just a little nuts, was a bit hokey.  Marcus, you're a centurion, and you didn't get to that rank by charging, unarmed, into about fifty armed, fierce Painted Men of the Seal Tribe.  Even to rescue the eagle standard.  And finally, a scene with two guys eating a raw rat is not necessary.  It doesn't help the plot, doesn't strengthen the relationship between the two; just makes you feel a little queasy.

And the ending reminded me of National Treasure.  The exciting, finale music, Marcus and Esca walking out the door together, carefree.  Heck, if you put in Ben Gates and Riley Poole, and change the costumes, I could be the ending of the next National Treasure.  Except Ben and Riley aren't as close as Marcus and Esca by the end of their movie.  Even the dialogue:

Esca: So what should we do now?

Marcus:  You decide.

4469379,3,B004UMAPUO,"I accidentally stumbled onto this flick just at its beginning on a TV movie channel without knowing the title. I could tell from the costumes and settings it was likely about the Romans in Britain. I've studied the Celts and Romans in depth, once had a pretty good artifact collection of museum quality items from Roman-occupied Britain, and wrote a 285 page historic novel about the Boudican rebellion. I've also visited the Roman baths at Bath, small Roman amphitheaters in England and Wales, the Roman fort at Housesteads, and many places along Hadrian's Wall. I've been a consultant for several published books on the Picts, Romans, and Celts, and I know British Roman history pretty well. The DVD starts with an insufferable set of uninvited previews of Universal films that seem to drone on and on. The old Universal producers would not have abused their paid audiences this badly.

That said, I was impressed with much of this film's depiction of a typical Roman frontier fort and the area near Hadrian's Wall in Britain. The buildings, their construction, the costumes, and many other things depicted in the film were spot on. Even the circular Celtic thatched houses were very close to those of the Butser experimental ancient farm near Chalton in Britain. The dwellings further north resembled those excavated at Skara Brae, Orkney, in north Britain, giving the viewer a rough idea of what life there might have been like. For me, the scenery and settings were what made this movie worth watching. The weak screenwriting, poor story development, and several hard-to-accept events were the main reasons I gave it only three generous stars as a movie. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the acting bad. To me, sacrifice of the young boy for clann betrayal was acceptible and not a problem, knowing ancient Celtic culture. The ""Master of Animals"" costume of the shaman, similar to that on the Gundestrap Cauldron, was also a nice touch.

It would have been so easy to make the entirely blue painted and ludicrous ""Seal People"" tattooed or woad-painted Picts instead of having them look like American Mohawk indians. Sheer unbelievable idiocy. And these folk on foot could outdistance horses in the long chase south? Not bloody likely. Then there was the matter of surviving hypothermia in a bitter cold Scottish river? Again, not very believable. I could stretch a point and accept the miraculous and too-quick appearance of remnants of the lost IX'th Legion, but only barely, for the sake of a difficult plot resolution. The film trailer stated that the IX'th Hispana legion composed of 5,000 men disappeared north of the wall, never to be seen again. This is incorrect. The IX'th legion reappeared later in Israel.

Also, Celts never put rotating blades on the hubs of their chariot wheels, regardless of the sculpture artist's misconception of how the unfortunate British bronze statue of Boudica should look. Putting blades on Celtic chariots was pure fantasy and the consultants should have said emphatically,""No!"" But at least the chariots were there. We know from excavated burials that the real ones were very lightweight and fast, carrying a warrior and his highly skilled driver. Celts often fought in the nude, and this was almost alluded to in the brief fight with the rogue warriors. Another good depiction of reality that probably escaped most viewers. That said, there was the error of wearing their crossbow fibulas upside down. I've had and conserved about a dozen at one time or another and still have one in good wearable condition. These fibulae were always worn with the crossbar at the bottom and the latch catch at the top where the wearer can see to latch it. Someone should have spotted this error.

Despite its many weaknesses there were also many good aspects. I ordered a DVD copy because of the great visuals in the film that depicted life in a Roman frontier fort and how it might have been north of the wall in the Britain of 2,000 years ago. Just producing the film was a courageous gamble that could have resulted in an epic if only it had been better crafted and had a slightly more believable story. It suffered from badly informed consultants on the ancient Britains, Celts, and the people of the far north. The DVD extras included an alternate ending, which I won't spoil for you. It also included several cut scenes. One was an excellent depiction of a Celtic chariot race.

Not exactly bad, but it could have been much better with very little effort. ... nonetheless, still better than most,  and worth watching, if only for the well filmed visuals.",1326326400,,4598,4.903598971722365

4469381,3,B004UMAPUO,"I will not nitpick over some incongruities of details of costuming or plot. Suffice it to say, this is a fine old adventure story, derived from Rosemary Sutcliff's series of novels about ancient Rome. Yes, Channing Tatum at times is stiff and one hopes for  more subtlety, but Donald Sutherland does not fare much better, coming across more like Sergeant Oddball from ""Kelly's Heroes"".

The scenes of the fog and rivers and rolling hills are quite beautiful. And the legionary outpost at the beginning of the film is well staged.

The big reason I gave this film only three stars is because of the cinematography. When will directors finally stop pandering to the TV-reality series style of shaky camera work during battle scenes and other scenes? Hello!!! There's a bigger audience out there than just the plugged in brainless teenyboppers who go to the cinema for a visceral roller coaster ride.

The human eye (and brain) needs more time to absorb, and appreciate, every image. To confuse the viewer with rapid cuts, missing frames, and light-speed pans is a very cheap way to produce ""excitement"". Unfortunately, nowadays this seems to be a case of the blind leading the blind in Hollywood.

Furthermore, when the cinematographer's color palette becomes either monochromatic or purposely overexposed or purposely unfocused, where is the pleasure in appreciating composition, contrast and a reflection of nature's beauty?

Gone are the directors who carefully planned these relationships and structured their composition. So sad.

To my mind the visuals are the biggest regret with this movie, that had a real chance to fly, and even with all that having been said, is still more enjoyable than the overblown and gimmicky ""Gladiator"".",1326240000,2,1737,5.138297872340425

I believe the videographer is an academy award winner, but regardless the camerawork and locales look tremendous. I believe most of the movie is shot where the story took place thousands of years ago.

If you are expecting tons of fight scenes and meat-head soldier battles like a movie like '300', this movie has a handful, but it's not about that. I am a buff of the fantasy/old-world genre so I liked the movie, but if you are not you might not appreciate the setting so much. The story doesn't make much sense as it is a quest for an eagle prop ornament that does nothing, but I guess it is nice to see symbolism and the real world, instead of expecting some cheap magical movie item.

4469387,2,B004UMAPUO,"I suppose the best thing I can say about ""The Eagle"" is that it isn't your typical sword-and-sandals gladiator/ancient warrior epic. It does not follow the generic formula of such a film, it lacks a one-dimensional villain, the fate of the world does not hang in the balance, and there is no female love interest for the protagonist to rescue--in fact, there are barely any women at all in this film. ""The Eagle"" tells the story of Marcus Aquila (a woefully miscast Channing Tatum), a young Roman soldier who longs to venture north of Hadrian's Wall in order to retrieve the titular standard and redeem the honor of his father, whose legion was slaughtered in the region and whose defeat brought dishonor to Rome. While recuperating from a serious injury he suffered during an act of valor, Marcus rescues a young slave, Esca (a surprisingly intense Jamie Bell), from death during a gladiator battle. As they journey to the north in search of the eagle, the growing bond between Marcus and Esca betrays a small degree of homoeroticism, but any hint of that is quickly quashed when they are captured by ""savages"" who look suspiciously like American Indians. The film then degenerates into a series of set pieces that exemplify loyalty and honor, and the film ends with a dialogue exchange between Marcus and Esca that seems to be lifted directly from the script of any B-grade cop/buddy flick you can name. I can't quite imagine who the filmmakers thought this mess would appeal to, but regardless of the target audience, this film misses the mark by a wide margin.",1323475200,2,1564,4.796296296296297

4469392,3,B004UMAPUO,"Overall, I really enjoyed what seemed to me to be the authentically artistic (but not historical) character of the movie. Mostly that meant not including standard movie cliches, and having an inspiring story, a complicated plot with no true good guys or bad guys, and good action. By cliches, I mean specifically that I really appreciated the lack of a gratuitous sex scene, and the lack of a scene where the good guy is almost beaten, kneels on the ground, the bad guy swings, and at the last second the good guy jerks up and kills the bad guy. The fighting in this movie is actually good.

But I deducted two stars because of the historical problems. While there is an ancient Roman Republican tradition of Roman fighting prowess, and this movie suggests a great conflict between that republican martial tradition and the developing bureaucratic and soft elites under the empire, this movie doesn't do anything to portray the natives of the Island of Britain in an historically accurate way. The setting of the movie is in the 2nd century AD, but Gaelic-speaking Scots-Irish didn't arrive in Scotland from Ireland to establish the Dal Riata until the 5th century. In the 2nd century here were no Gaelic-speakers in what is now Scotland, and there never have been any in central Britain where supposedly ""Gaelic"" speaking Esca came from. His tribe, the Brigantes, spoke an ancient ancestor of the Welsh/Cornish/Breton languages, a completely different branch of the Celtic language family from Gaelic. The people north of Hadrian's Wall were the Picts, and we have no idea what type of language they spoke - The strongest hypothesis is that it wasn't Indo-European at all, just like Basque & Etruscan are/were not Indo-European. It's extremely unlikely that Esca could have spoken with the people north of Hadrian's Wall, and there's a 0% chance that either he or they were speaking Gaelic.

Come on. Can script-writers and movie producers check Wikipedia? Could they at least hire a linguist and an historian to both do some fact checking if the movie people didn't want to take a couple hours to read up online about the actual cultural and linguistic landscape of the time period and area that is the movie's setting?",1316736000,6,2221,4.904255319148936

He wanders off to the north alone with a slave whose life he has saved ,wanders around a bit before bumping just in the tribe who got the eagle after the battle that destroyed the legion.

4469402,3,B004UMAPUO,"In the Roman Empire in the Second Century A.D., Hadrian's Wall, in Northern Britain, marked the official Roman ""end of the known world"" between Roman-occupied Britain and the untamed territory north.  The protagonist in this story, Marcus, is the son of a Roman officer who lost an entire Legion of 5,000 soldiers when it forayed north into this uncharted territory.  Worse for Roman military honor, the Legion's Standard (its ""Eagle"") was lost as well.  His family name had been tainted by the loss, and he of course seeks to reclaim the Eagle, find out what happened to the lost Legion, thereby restoring his family honor.  Towards this end he asks to be posted at the northernmost Roman garrison in Britain, which is considered to be a backwater posting that no one would want.

No spoilers here, but basically Marcus journeys north of Hadrian's wall in search of the Standard, accompanied by his British-born slave.  More would be telling.

The most impressive aspect of this movie is its moody cinematography.  One truly gets the atmosphere of a British landscape (Scotland, actually) pristine and almost untouched by man, and completely untouched by civilization.  Never have I seen a film that conveyed this impression more powerfully.

The story here is straightforward, and not especially complicated.  Nor is the acting anything terribly impressive.  The story moves along at a brisk pace and holds the viewer's interest, but the real power of this film is the cinematography, not the storyline or acting.

4469403,3,B004UMAPUO,"Full disclosure:  I am a great fan of Rosemary Sutcliff.  Her stories frequently follow or flesh out Kipling's fantastical kids' history of England, Puck of Pook's Hill and Rewards and Fairies.  Also a great fan of Kipling.
Th0at said:
The DVD has the usual making-of-the-movie prequel.  The more they talked about all the work they did to make even the smallest details believable, the more I feared the movie was going to be a loser.
It was. Some of the items were technical. Aquila is a centurion.  In Sutcliff's world, and Kipling's world, the centurion is something like the junior commissioned officer in the British Army.  Not so.  To the extent we know something, a centurion is something like a jumped-up platoon sergeant without a platoon leader.  He commanded about eighty men and there may have been a hundred of them in a full Legion.  A new centurion--which Aquila is--doesn't go to command a fort, as he does in the movie, even a small fort.
The initial battle scenes are pretty good, working with what we know of Roman and barbarian tactics. The Romans were trained, disciplined pros, used to working in coordinated units. The barbarians were, most likely, skilled individual fighters who depended on the wild rush and battle fury. Those were both laid out skillfully in the fights and in the other scenes.
After Aquila is wounded, he is hauled two hundred miles in a mule cart.  Hope the dialogue didn't say two hundred ""leagues"" which would be about six hundred miles and you can't go that far in a straight line in England.  The bum leg, fixed by a better surgeon in order to allow the plot to go forward is a stock contrivance in, at least, old Brit action lit.
The fort scenes, the officers' mess, the barracks, all seem to fit quite well with what we know of Roman practice, which is quite a lot, and the facilities at Hadrian's Wall.
The gladiatorial scene in which Aquila gets involved with Esca, the Brigante, demonstrates the fact that many places in the Empire had their little bush-league stadium where the cut-rate touring companies did their sordid thing, with what looks like normal people in the stadium screaming for real blood.  A good move, adding what Sutcliff did not, she having Aquila buy Esca before he entered the arena.
Once they go north of the wall, Aquila and Esca are the only two in the north who shave every day.  Get haircuts and everything.  Except for the Seal People,a Sutcliff invention.  None of them them had beards and they had vaguely Iroquoian scalplocks.  The producers had to invent everything else about them and, if they had existed on the remote headlands of the North, they might have been indian, some few having come across some how. But they didn't exist. It was a  good job fleshing them out, though.
After Esca and Aquila get the Eagle and flee, the Seal People chase them for days.  Among other things, the horses the two heroes ride don't die from overwork for days, instead of collapsing in a couple of hours.  That kept ringing my bell, saying, ""this is a movie"".  When brought to bay, the Seal People's warriors, who have run the men down after days of chase, have with them a nine-year old boy.  How did that happen?
It is not my purpose to tell how the movie differed from Sutcliff's book, although when it did, it suffered.  The exception is the gladiatorial game.
At the end, Esca and Aquila march into some gilded palace full of Romans in togas looking vaguely like Charles Laughton in some old swords&sandals flick.  They scornfully put the Eagle down on a table and get all kinds of praise.  After which Aquila says to one, about Esca, he knows more about honor and courage than you ever will.  BZZZZT!  We don't know where this building is.  Rome?  Unlikely.  The seat of Roman government in Britain?  The comment is a complete non sequitur, referring to nothing that anybody in the group had ever said.  What is this all about?
This is not how the book ended, which is more believable and lays some groundwork for a further book.  Nevertheless, the movie's ending was clumsy and poorly done.
This could have been greatly improved by having somebody, anybody, read the screen play.  You don't need to know a lot of history, nor even have read any of Sutcliff's work to be able to see the clangers like the shaving, the nine-year old boy, the occasional dialogue cliches.
Still, the acting was good, the details were fabulously interesting, and the scenery fantastic.
Don't let this put you off Sutcliff, the finest writer of YA historical novels ever.",1313193600,5,4533,4.683080808080808
4469404,4,B004UMAPUO,"The Eagle is a Roman Period Piece, set in the year 140 AD, during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pious, after the reign of Hadrian. It tells the story of a young Roman officer (Channing Tatum) searching to recover the lost Roman Eagle that disappeared with his father's legion in the northern part of Great Britain. With his slave (Jamie Bell), the two set out in the highlands to recover the Golden Eagle. The story is very engaging, but possibly weighed down by the first 30 minutes, when we see him at his new post. Honestly, I didn't care about his new post, and I didn't care about his uncle, played by a dead looking, and acting, Donald Sutherland. It wasn't until you started to find out about his slave Esca's life, played wonderfully by the very talented Jamie Bell. Once they saddled their horses and journeyed beyond Hadrian's wall, the story picked up nicely, and I was engaged. However, one aspect that constantly made me cringe at times was Channing Tatum's performance as Marcus. Yes, he has proved himself to be a teen heartthrob in Dear John, and of course a badass in G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra, but for me it seemed as if he almost didn't fit well in this movie. And to tell you the truth, I cared more about Jamie Bell's character Esca than I did with Channing Tatum's character. And last but not least, The Seal warriors that chase Esca and Marcus at the end looked like the Na'vi from James Cameron's Avatar!

4469406,3,B004UMAPUO,"Let me say first that there is much to like about The Eagle in terms of its movie-making quality and visual style. That said, watching this film is something like watching a 1950s Saturday morning western about cowboys and Indians. You know the ones where the bloodthirsty savages were for, no discernable reason, trying to kill the nice white people who were trying to settle their land? This has the same tone.
In the second century A.D. Emperor Hadrian of Rome sends a legion north through Britain to conquer the region. The legion never returns and the golden standard of an Eagle that it bore is lost, to the great shame of the empire and specifically the family of the commanding officer. Clearly Hadrian's only recourse is to build a wall that cuts Britain in half, and to declare the wall to be the end of the known world.
Twenty years later Marcus, son of the dishonored commander, is placed in charge of a fort in Britain. Though inexperienced he wisely anticipates an attack and saves his men from being slaughtered by the Britons. He is severely wounded and honorably discharged, thus ending his military career and his hopes of restoring the family name.
When rumors surface that the Eagle standard has been seen Marcus takes off for the North with his Briton slave, Esca, in tow. Esca is honor bound to serve Marcus, though he hates him, because Marcus saved his life.
In the wild north the two men discover something about each other and here the film has inklings of Dances with Wolves or James Cameron's remake of the same (cleverly set in space and called Avatar so we will not know it's the same film). Marcus dismisses Esca's inability to understand the `glory' of Rome. Esca in turn tells Marcus how Roman legionnaires tried to take his village when he was a boy. His father, the chief, was killed as was Esca's entire family.
It is here that Marcus is shown the cruel reality that is Rome and some serious personal conflict is introduced.
When a tribe of Britons finds Esca and Marcus, Esca pretends Marcus is his slave in order to save his life. Here we see a glimpse of the Britons as they really are, a proud people simply trying to protect their home. Yes, they can be brutal, but then so can the Romans who are, after all, the invaders.
*Here there be spoilers*
It is here that the film takes a downward turn. We are clearly shown that Rome is an empire built on brutality and savagery, despite its attempts to civilize the world. By this point in the film I had no desire at all to see Marcus find the standard and return it. The standard represents a brutal and bloodthirsty empire obsessed with expanding its borders at any cost. I thought there might be some wonderful cliche moment where Marcus decides to stay in Britain with the more civilized people. This is not to be.
Esca surprisingly helps Marcus find the standard, and kill his countrymen who have it, and the two must then flee south to escape the angry Britons. While we certainly don't want the heroes to die, I really see no way to justify their actions. The Britons have the standard as a mark of their victory over another people who were brutally slaughtering them to take their land. Seems fair enough.
There is a senseless killing of a small child during the final battle that I assume the writers put in to make the Britons seem like the bad guys. This way we can cheer for the Romans as they kill them and the film can end with Marcus restoring his family honor. To me it just seemed trite. Esca betrays his own people to fight with Marcus, though by the end of the film he is no longer honor bound. The film also attempts to paint the Britons as noble savages but then reduces them to simply brutal savages so it is seemingly alright to kill them. The story raises conflict in terms of Esca trying to deal with the fact that he is serving a man who represents the empire that killed his family, but in the end it seems Esca no longer cares because of his friendship with Marcus.
All in all the movie is worth a watch for the visuals. The film is violent, though not as violent as it could have been. Though there is no romance in the film, they do manage to work in shots of Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell in clothing (or lack thereof) so comically revealing it's clear they had to shave. While the film is entertaining for about the first two thirds, the ending takes an inexplicable turn for the worst and is sadly disappointing.",1313020800,,4432,4.479604449938195

The recovery of the Eagle wasn't a random snatch and grab, it was very carefully planned and executed.  I won't even start about the Legion re-assembling.",1312070400,4,739,4.451851851851852
4469410,3,B004UMAPUO,"The scenes are gritty and shot to give the feel that these are real scenes, but the movie is predictable to a point.

Dishonored father's son grows up to be a centurion like his father and command a northern garrison, a post he requested. On his first skirmish with the wild Britons, he is wounded seriously and honorably discharged with his leg damaged when a chariot he took down fell on him. He is a stubborn cuss and lives to tell the tale but lives in pain because his leg was not properly attended. A relative from his father's side of the family, another Aquilii, played by Donald Sutherland, takes him into his home and eventually find's a surgeon to fix Marcus Aquila's leg after Marcus saves a slave from a gladiatorial fight: slave versus gladiator.

The slave owes Marcus his life, although why a slave would have been allowed to keep his father's dagger is never mentioned. Once Marcus's leg is healed and his strength returns, he is determined to go into the north beyond Hadrian's wall and bring back the Eagle of the 9th Cohort with his slave Esca, who convinces Marcus to let him do all the talking.

There is the usual misunderstanding, Marcus and Esca change places as slave and master, and they travel north to where a clan of seal people on the edge of the world have the eagle. What follows is the usual rescue, fight, danger, and cavalry rescue (Romans not American blue boys). Pretty standard fare.

There are few women and those that do appear are merely background. This is a man's movie about men's affairs and women would have just gotten in the way, despite the fact that many clans fought side by side with the women. Anyone ever hear of Boudicca? The seal people look particularly fierce, more like wood ash and woad painted Mohawk Indians than clans from northern Scotland, but they are effectively fierce and warlike. The acting is what one would expect of this kind of movie: adequate but uninspired. Extra points for dressing Russell Edgington (Denis O'Hare) of True Blood excess in Roman soldier's garb and giving him some minor authority.

Channing Tatum is laconic and iron-jawed and Jamie Bell is subdued and secretive, but with a strong underlying rage kept in tight control. The scenes are furious clashes of arms and the dream sequences appropriately cryptic and telling of Channing Tatum's need to unravel the mystery of his father's disappearance and his family's honor. He has a lot to prove and throws himself at every opportunity.

The Eagle is nothing special, but it's not completely devoid of cinematic value. It is thrilling and exciting and full of men and costumes with very little needed or shown in the way of acting.

4469411,5,B004UMAPUO,"I wasn't sure about this film when i bought it. I love history and movies about Ancient Rome. The plot reminded me of HBO's Rome so I thought I'd see for myself.
I'm not disappointed. Channing Tatum is very Good as is Donald Sutherland....in a supporting role....The movie has a plausible plot, great cinematography and costumes and LOTS of action. For the ladies, there is no love interest for Mr. Tatum's character. He is instead entirely focused on reclaiming his family's honor.
Its fine once in awhile to have an action film that does not try to hard to appeal to everyone. My only complaint, is minor....the Brittanic tribes portrayed reminded me too much of American indians...were they that similar in real life in terms of culture or was that a ""reach"" by the director? It DOES NOT hurt the movie.

4469412,3,B004UMAPUO,"Well, being that Channing (Absolute Hottie) Tatum was starring in this film,
I decided to check it out. (-:  (Yeah, I said it!)
I wasn't disappointed, nor was I blown away.
I enjoy an ancient roman or greek period epic just as much as the next guy,
and this one had a pretty solid storyline; the usual roar & gore of the ancient
hand-to-hand / face-to-face battleground, both Channing Tatum and Jaime Bell did
a decent job in their respective roles....great supporting cast, etc.

The story takes place during the time when the ancient romans were trying to dominate
ancient Britain, who they saw as barbarians. Twenty years before, Channing Tatum's character's
father, all from a long line of proud, brave, and decorated roman solidiers, had literally disappeared
with his band of 5000 solidiers, as they attempted to conquer the northern part of Britain.
The north is reputed to be a very ominous & mysterious place, inhabited by some of the most
savage and fierce of the ancient british barbarian tribes. After such a crushing defeat,
the Roman emperor, Hadrian, decides to erect a massive wall, which becomes known as ""the end
of the known world"" to the ancient romans. Fast forward 20 yrs,  and it is now Channing's character
who is revered as a mighty warrior for the Roman conquest of Britain. But there is one blemish on
his family name, and in his own memories of his father...that it's been said that his father and a few
of his soliders, after being so utterly overwhelmed by the barbarian hordes, turned tail and ran.
Cowardice in the face of death, for a decorated general in the Roman army, be it real or percieved,
is something that Channing Tatum's character just can't abide. In the back of his mind, regardless of
what victories he has on the battlefield, he feels he must somehow redeem his family name, and retrieve
the standard of the golden eagle, that was the emblem which represented his father's ill-fated army.

After a brutal campaign against the southern british barbarian hordes, he is severely wounded, and while
in recovery at his uncle's palace (played by veteran actor Donald Sutherland), he goes to a gladitorial display,
where he witnesses a young slave, played admirably by Jaime Bell (of Billy Elliot fame), stand up boldly
in the face of what surely is impending doom in the arena, against a huge muscular gladiator.
Impressed, and perhaps even touched by this young slave's moxie, he stands up for him and overrides the
popular vote that he should die at the gladiator's hand. For this, the slave becomes his slave.
Not giving away anymore of the story, in case any of you haven't seen it yet, than I already have....
This is the point where the story takes it's shape and purpose.
But, long story short...there are places where the storytelling goes off the beaten path at bit,
some places where it slows to a snails pace, mixed in with moments of brilliant sequences.
Overall though, it's very uneven.
I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, becuase that would be a lie.
But this is not a GREAT MOVIE either...it could've been though.
My advice is that this makes for a better rental than it does a purchase.  ***3 Stars***",1311638400,2,3165,4.7368421052631575

While the actual story of the 9th Legion is lost to us, this movie continues the assumption that it was lost in battle in Scotland. I'd been looking forward to seeing this for a year, though its tardiness in hitting the screens down here and the very limited release it received, suggested that it was going to be modest fair. While there were some good passages, this turned out to be the case.

The opening scenes were the best, with the first battle being very exciting. They ultimately weren't what they could have been though, due to the scenes being disjointed and rushed. The chariot attack scene was simply just too short! I didn't mind the subsequent journey of the two main characters north to find the 9ths lost Eagle standard but I felt it was undone by the depiction of the Seal village. The Seal people looked impressive in the Trailer but I found myself underwhelmed here. I didn't mind that they seemed to borrow from American Indians for their `look', it was partly that the name `seals' just doesn't carry any gravitas. As well, they were probably just a bit too primitive looking and I didn't find the chief to be at all imposing. All up, they just didn't quite work for me. The two leads were fine but by the end they couldn't do much in a movie that had kinda lost its way.

I'm conscious that the movie is based on a book that was written for young adults, so the director may well have made decisions to keep it suitable for that audience. The final confrontation seemed to confirm this for me. The low level of violence too also points to this. But to me, if Centurion had a bit much gore, this didn't have enough.

This said, I enjoyed the film (and may well have loved it if I were still fifteen). It's totally ok that a film is made for teenagers but it really had the potential to impress on a higher level. So there were good elements but overall it was not quite satisfying. 3  stars",1311552000,3,2004,4.408108108108108

4469419,3,B004UMAPUO,"As of this writing the user reviews on Amazon for this movie average three and a half stars and I couldn't agree more.

Here's the scoop. The Roman 9th legion is in the process of conquering Britain when they meet their match and are decimated by some of the Northern tribes. For all intents and purposes they disappear along with the Eagle of the title. Nine years have passed and the son of the legion's commander has come up in the ranks and wants to retrieve said Eagle and square his father's name.

This movie is a shame. There is so much good here that ends up getting pulled down by some bad decisions. First is the casting. I like Channing Tatum well enough but he needs a few more projects under his belt to develop enough gravity to handle a role like this. And Donald Sutherland, as Tatum's uncle, was entirely miscast, as was Denis O'Hare as Lutorius. But then you have Jamie Bell as Esca and Tahar Rahim as the Seal Prince who ,among others, do a great job. Same with the directing. Much of the first act is almost hack level, but when Tatum and Bell head North on their mission things pick up in a big way. The landscape is used as well, if not better than any movie I've ever seen. It's near breathtaking. The sense of movement within the frame also gets better. It's almost an entirely different movie. And when they meet up with the Seal tribe it maintains a great level of authority. But then there is some clunky dialogue and the end is a bit too cool and it's frustrating to see.

""King Arthur,"" and ""Centurion"" do a decent job of touching on Rome's time in Britain and, for my money, this does a better job in many respects. But the few mistakes here and there keep it from being a true masterpiece.",1311379200,,1721,4.338509316770186

4469421,3,B004UMAPUO,"When I first read that 'The Eagle' was going to be filmed I was elated that a production company was going to finally bring Simon Scarrow's Eagle series to the screen. Anticipating seeing his characters Marco and Cato to the screen, I was somewhat disappointed to discover that the film was based not on the Scarrow novels but on Rosemary Sutcliff's 'Eagle of the Ninth', the first of a very good series of children's books written by her in in the 1950's. Sutcliff specialized in historical fiction for children and her 'Eagle of the Ninth' series is one the best children's historical series ever, the third in the series winning the Carnegie Medal. Sutcliff's books were a favorite of school librarians worldwide and is itself a worthy basis for a film on Roman Britain. Her books were popular with young adults as well as children and was filmed once before by the BBC.
 'The Eagle', directed by Kevin Macdonald, is an adaptation of Sutcliff's children's book with a plot line altered to appeal to modern audiences. Macdonald attempts to straddle the line between the original children's book and adult tastes for more action.
 The film gets a lot right. Roman Britain, circa mid 2nd century AD, is portrayed correctly, From the the uniformity of dress of the legions, the design of the Roman villa, and Roman battle tactics, the film's portrayal is authentic.  His portrayal of the Seal tribesmen is guesswork because not much is really known historically but his interpretation is good enough. Gaelic is spoken in the film however, a language probably not spoken by the Pictish people of northern Britain. The director also does not make the same mistake that so many filmmakers do in having Romans speak with British accents. All the Romans speak American English to differentiate them from the British, Gauls, and other cultures that were commonly part of Roman forces in the 2nd Century. It may be jarring at first, but the language choice makes sense.
 Unfortunately, the film gets a lot wrong as well. Maintaining viewer's interest in the the main characters is the key to this story and it fails because of the poor acting of of the lead characters. The film lacks drive. It is too pedestrian a production. The beauty of the setting is marred by lackluster direction and mediocre acting.

The main characters are a roman centurion played by Channing Tatum and a enslaved briton, Jamie Bell. The dvd contains two versions of the movie, unrated and theatrical.  An alternate end, which adds nothing which is why its an alternate and deleted scenes which add little to the narrative and one could see why they were ommitted.  If one has watched Arthur and has read the book then you will be familiar with the tale of a romans honour dictating that the Centurion must retrieve the lost eagle standard of his fathers missing, presumed slain legion dragging his slave along as guide to the unconquered lands north of hadrians wall.  Once in the north the roles are reversed but is this the end of the quest?

At nearly two hours long, the narrative slows a little in places but the film is well shot, money has obviously been spent well on the intermittent action sequences and the pace rarely falls flat and whether one believes the story of a slave retaining loyalty to his master the leads convince in the main.  An interesting twist on the road movie and good against evil which will stand more than one viewing. This film has found a place in my collection and lead me to the library to reread a classic.

4469425,1,B004UMAPUO,"Remember that attention to details is the difference between good+ and whatever lies below.
Props example: In this case we have a Northern Briton remote Roman garrison around 140 AD and the soldiers all wearing the IDENTICAL (mass production techniques came sooner to the Western world than anyone knew) armored uniforms that coincidentally had zero markings showing any use and nary a spot of dust (must be those airtight containers).
Casting example: Casting director totally miscast this film besides a lack of authentic period creating effort on the part of the actors who instead gave us their world wide accents and appearances just acted more like tourists in a 21st century cafe in Rome, but the prime example was Sutherland whose ""acting"" consists of imitating himself. The same physical mannerisms, facial gestures, head turning, dialogue and enunciation that he presents in all his movies.
Battle scenes: The formation the soldiers used against the Brits would have been more effective against arrows or calvary not a mass of enemy that outnumbered them 10 to 1. Anybody who has been to an European soccer match would know that these few soldiers with shields in front of them while plodding a couple of hundred yards would have been crushed by the mass of rabid enemy fans.
Battle scenes 2: Brits that, unfortunately, looked more like northeastern American natives with sword fighting skills as good as the Romans was out-of-control imagineering by the director.
Storyline example: Too formula driven e.g. son defends family honor; treks across hundreds of miles to coincidentally come right to the location of a lost metal eagle; steals it back and despite being wounded rides hundreds of miles back mostly on horseback but for some not clear reason was not able to outdistance the on-foot Brits. They must have been spending their entire lives just training to be ultra ultra marathoners. Finally, only to have his now faithful slave within days round up some ex-Roman soldiers hidden in hundreds of square miles of wilderness to again defend the eagle.

4469426,4,B004UMAPUO,"Although ""The Eagle"" is not without its flaws, taken as a whole, it is riveting. However, the story begins as a Roman story--young leader takes over the dreaded outpost of Hadrian's Wall in order to assuage his father's honor and restore the Eagle emblem to the Roman Empire. Not long into the story, the emphasis shifts to young Marcus's recovery from injuries sustained in battle. Then there's a long ride by Marcus and his new slave Esca to find the Seal People, a sub-branch of the little-known Picts and recover that Eagle emblem.

As I rode the rugged hills and mountains with the two, I thought that viewers looking for a thrilling Roman rout of Celtic peoples must be getting bored. However, I found this story--this quest--more riveting than battle and, of course, thought the landscape breathtaking (filmed in Scotland and Hungary) and anticipated that the journey would lead to new movie thrills. I was, of course, correct.

The back story: Marcus's father was the leader of this post when Marcus was small. He and his 5000 men all disappeared, along with the Eagle emblem. It was considered dishonorable to lose the EAgle, even if no one knew what happened those years ago. Marcus grows up to take his father's place and rectify his honor. Early in his rule, he prevents his troops from being slaughtered during a surprise attack during the black of night by rousting them to duty in time for battle.

Edited 8-30-13: How in the world did I fail to mention Channing Tatum? I've most of his movies since this one and simply find him enthralling.

Much of the framework of the story is based on fact and is taken from Rosemary Sutcliff's young adult novel, ""The Eagle,"" one of three novels in her Roman Britain trilogy. I've always heard about the Picts, those painted-tattoed peoples on the edge of the Celtic nation. Not much is known about them, but Ms Sutcliff and the film lift up that curtain and show us a culture alien to even the Celts in general. History tells us that Hadrian built this 90-mile wall to prevent Celtic invasions into northern England which the Romans had added to their empire. The ferocity of Celtic fighting along this wall was daunting even to Roman soldiers.

Enter Marcus and his slave, Esca, who was given to him, as a result of battle between gladiator and captive. Esca is a Breton, another branch of the Celts. In the film, all the Celts spoke the same language, so that Esca can communicate with each new group he and Marcus meet on their quest. As Celts hate Romans, slave and master turn about and Esca does all the talking.

Finally, they arrive in the land of the Seal People, far north into modern Scottish territory along the North Sea. Marcus learns what it means to be a slave, but, more importantly, what it means to have a friend. There's also the revelation of some of the lost legionaries who adapted to the way of life of the Celts, the meaning of honor and courage and making things right.

I really enjoyed this film because of the story and the setting. Both were exotic in a wild, enduring way. ""The Eagle"" is also the first movie I've ever seen which features the Gaelic language. That in itself was worth the admission.

4469431,4,B004UMAPUO,"Having read Rosemary Sutcliff's novel, ""The Eagle of the Ninth,"" and seen the trailer for this film, I wasn't quite certain of what to expect. Sutcliffe's novel, first published in the 1950s, is a well-written adventure story about Marcus Flavius Aquila, a young Roman centurion on a quest to discover the truth about the fate of his father, a commander of the Ninth Legion, and the legion's eagle standard. The Ninth, which marched into the wilds of the Scottish highlands, vanished into thin air when Marcus was a child, an event still viewed by some as a blot on the Aquila family honor. Marcus is accompanied in his quest by his Briton slave Esca, who, in the novel, is also a close friend and comrade worthy of trust.

The film takes a somewhat different tack, and simplifies the story, eliminating many details and characters, including the novel's only female element. As in the book, Marcus (Channing Tatum, who looks great in armor) has rescued the slave Esca (the excellent Jamie Bell) from a gladiatorial ring in Roman Britain. The film's Esca, not surprisingly, loathes all things Roman, and serves Marcus only as a repayment of his life debt, at first exhibiting none of the feelings of friendship and spiritual empathy displayed by the character in the novel. Master and slave set off into Caledonia, as the Romans called northern Scotland, in search of the Eagle and information regarding the fate of the Ninth Legion -- only to be captured by one of the native clans, the ""Seal People,"" who are led by a fierce, unpleasantly violence-prone mohawked prince played by Tahar Rahim. In the meantime, they have encountered a lone survivor of the Ninth, a Roman who has adopted the native lifestyle and a Briton name for self-preservation, and Marcus has heard the tragic story (movingly told by Bell) of how Esca came to be a slave. The conclusion of the film is entirely predicatable, and the final scene rather abrupt, but the battle scenes, throughout, are rivetting and well choreographed, and the sweeping vistas of the Scottish highlands provide a dramatic backdrop to Marcus and Esca's hazardous travels.

The stripped-down nature of the storyline places responsibility for the film's success on the two young actors, Tatum and Bell. (Donald Sutherland makes a brief appearance as Marcus' genial uncle, but he has little impact on the film's overall atmosphere.) The buff Channing Tatum, with his hair dyed dark and his eyecatching Abercrombie-and-Fitch physique, is surprisingly effective as Marcus Aquila. One would imagine a Roman centurion to have the kind of abrupt, stoic delivery that Mr. Tatum starts off with (he becomes much more expressive, believable, and at ease with his role later on in the movie). In any event, he is quite likeable. Jamie Bell's intense, nicely nuanced Esca, who goes from tight-lipped, cold-eyed hostility to reluctant comradeship and eventual friendship, is sympathetic and appealing, and his lithe, offbeat good looks and slim physique make an interesting foil to his co-star's robust mainstream hunkiness. Those who still associate Mr. Bell with Billy Elliot will notice that he has added muscle and definition to his slender frame, and that his very impressive acting chops are as well-honed as ever.

""The Eagle"" may not be a remarkable piece of cinema, but it contains some fine period detail and cinematography, striking scenery, and a nice, edgy bromance between the two protagonists. Interestingly, the Romans speak with a variety of American accents (a touch of social commentary, eh?), while the natives speak Scots Gaelic (less problematic, I suppose, than having them speak Pictish).

4469433,4,B004UMAPUO,"I love ancient history, and I'm always excited to read about a new historical movie that deals with some ancient event, especially if it is in an epic style.  With the Eagle, my excitement was tempered with some reservation, however, because of the main character being played by Channing Tatum, who I had only seen in the Step Up movies (my wife made me watch them) and in G.I. Joe (which was disappointing).  Tatum's character in Step Up was so repulsive to me that I could not imagine him playing a dignified Roman in this movie, yet within the first ten minutes of The Eagle he had layed my fears to rest by being not only convincing, but somewhat likeable.

The setting puts me in mind of another good recent movie about the Roman occupation of Britain, called Centurion.  They are stylistically different movies, but I don't think that its stretching it to view them as companion pieces.  The Eagle is gritty and filmed with thick saturation and sweeping cinematography. The battles are exciting and coherent, with only a minimum of the shaky-camera effect that plagues so many movies.

I'm not certain that this movie is based on a historical event, per se, but the costumes and cultures seem to be mostly accurate in their presentation. Surprisingly, there is no love story in this movie.  That is not a bad thing.  The plot leaves no room for an impromptu romance, and allows the movie to focus squarely on the main character's quest to regain his father's honor.

If you're a fan of Gladiator or Braveheart, or even Troy and Alexander, this movie will not disappoint you.  If you want a 300-style comic book extravaganza, this is not for you.

The good:
Beautiful well-done shots throughout the entire movie that look better the bigger your screen is.  The pacing and plot is very straightforward flowing from start to conflict to climax to finish that makes it remarkably easy to watch.

The bad:
While the acting isn't terrible, the actors just aren't given much dialogue to work with and they seem to bond irrevocably after 10 minutes.  There were plenty of missed opportunities to explore lore or explain personal motivations that could have brought the characters out much more.

The ugly:
There aren't too many historical inaccuracies or plot holes in this although the few do stand out.  The Roman military didn't discharge wounded soldiers and an organized attack on a Roman fort deep inside Britain should have been a much bigger deal.

That said, things like acknowledging the Roman reputation for brutality or the terrain of Scotland are nice pluses.  You probably won't watch this movie more than once and a previous entry 2 years ago, Centurion, may be more entertaining.",1309219200,,1167,5.005181347150259

I, too, liked the movie ""Gladiator.""  And ""The Eagle"" is no ""Gladiator.""  But ""The Eagle"" has an equally powerful story to tell about honor and loyalty.  A Roman Centurion and his Roman-hating slave embark on a mission to retrieve the Eagle, the symbol of mighty Rome, from the barbarians in North Britain where a Roman legion was lost decades earlier.  The relationship between master and slave, their adventures at the ""end of the world,"" and the switching of roles are compelling to say the least and they keep the story moving and the audience guessing to the very end.

4469442,1,B004UMAPUO,"Granted ""Gladiator"" wasn't the most original movie either but it was quite a grand sweeping epic. ""The Eagle"" is not so much epic, as its an epic fail.

The story takes place in the early 2nd century where 20 years ago a group of 5,000 Roman soldiers lead by the father of Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum) disappeared in the highlands Caledonia along with the golden eagle emblem that represented the group called The Ninth. After defending a fort and the soldiers he was assigned to lead, Marcus sets out into the highlands with his slave Esca (Jamie Bell) to retrieve the eagle and restore his father's name and of course to find out what happened to him and his group of soldiers.

Of course if you've seen the trailers you know these two encounter an evil tribe known as the Seal People. The whole movie is pretty predictable along with lots of stale acting, lame dialogue and very boring fights. A lot of the bad acting comes from Channing Tatum, who was fitting in G.I. Joe, but doesn't have the chops for these types of movies. The dialogue is very bland I mean you don't ever feel like the actors really seem to care, though I admit Bell does at least a halfway decent job and Donald Sutherland is his usual self as Marcus' uncle.

One thing I will say is the movie does have good cinematography, its well shot and looks good. There is a decent story here but it gets marred by the bad acting and lack of interesting characters. Apparently the book was much better, which honestly doesn't suprise me.

Some may like ""The Eagle"" but I was honestly bored as I didn't feel drawn into the story (the main one or side stories for that matter) and I was checking the clock a lot to see how much time it had left. * out of 4 stars.",1309046400,2,1730,4.38006230529595

4469446,3,B004UMAPUO,"THE EAGLE is based on quasi-historic events written by Rosemary Sutcliff in her novel 'The Eagle of the Ninth' and adapted for the screen by Jeremy Brock. In the hands of director Kevin Macdonald the re-enactment of the Roman wars in Britain become more a study of relationships and moral duty and that is probably the reason the film comes across as a rather quiet, contemplative piece rather than an epic. That is not a bad decision and were it not for the lack of a strong actor in the lead role, it likely would have been a theatrical success.

The story begins in 140 AD in Rome where young Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum), the son of the soldier who allowed the Eagle symbol of Roman victory to be lost in a battle in Britain in 120 AD, becomes a centurion: he asks to be stationed in Britain where he promises his father's departed spirit that he will restore honor to his family by regaining the eagle. Though advised against such a futile mission (the Roman legion south of Hadrian's wall has been unsuccessful in conquering the Britons),  Marcus is determined.  He is more a devoted son and humanist: he prevents the killing of a young Briton, Esca (Jamie Bell), in the gladiator arena and to repay the debt of saving his life Esca agrees to be Marcus' slave despite the fact that he loathes Rome and Marcus for the damages Romans inflicted on his people.  The two men set out to Britain where Marcus assumes command of the tired and disenchanted Roman legion, but with the support of Lutorius (Denis O'Hare) and because of wise decisions about strategy his legionnaires grow to respect him.  Marcus' courage results in his being injured in a confrontation with the rogue warriors  and he is transported to a hospital with Esca at his side. At the hospital he is tended by his uncle Aquila (Donald Sutherland) who assures his return to health and informs him that Rome has honored his bravery in battle and has rewarded him with an honorable discharge.  But Marcus is determined to restore his father's good name and sets off to the north with Esca to gain the eagle.  On the way Marcus and Esca become close and Esca provides leadership abilities when the two confront the Seal People lead by the Seal Prince (Tahar Rahim).  In a turn of events the Seals capture Marcus and Esca and to save Marcus' life, Esca tells the Seals that Marcus is his slave - a reversal of roles that indicates the relationship between these two men.  Once the eagle is discovered and recovered Marcus and Esca flee, Marcus gives Esca his freedom but Esca stays with his new friend, encountering the last of the lost Ninth including Guern (Mark Strong) and  Marcus is reassured of his father's bravery and valor and the story speeds along to the expected end.

The film is shot in Scotland and Hungary and the scenery is the star as captured by Anthony Dod Mantle.  The original musical score is by Atli &Ouml;rvarsson and adds considerably to the atmosphere of this rather dark film.  Jamie Bell is excellent as Esca, finessing the transition from hateful slave to respectful freed friend.  Channing Tatum is rather monotoned and monotonous as Marcus, a role that would have been better suited in the hands of a well-schooled actor rather than an Abercrombie & Fitch model.  But the director makes the most of Tatum's presence and the story is not impaired by his presence: it is just not enhanced by it.  THE EAGLE fares well on DVD with subtitles provided for the Gaelic conversations with the Seals.  It may not be a great movie, but it is fairly solid entertainment.

4469448,5,B004UMAPUO,"I have never given a five star review before, but then I've never seen a film at the cinema more than once. I saw this five times and paying for an US import I love it so much.

On the surface the story is a classic quest tale for the lost Eagle Standard of the lost Legion IX. The real story however [and Marcus' character arch] is Aquila's search to discover his father's fate and atonement with the memory of his father.

Kevin MacDonald has made a very clever film that incorporates little known details about the Roman period [enslavement of Romans after the Battle of Teutoburg Forest for one.] The cinematography is stunning. To me, it is the film that Jim Henson never got to make [not surprising as Duncan Kenworthy was trained how to make a film on The Dark Crystal.] A potential cult classic in my view.

All the actors were fantastic. This is not the Channing Tatum of Step-Up or She's the Man, but of A Guide to Recognising Your Saints and Stop-Loss. Jamie Bell does a brilliant cruel turn as Esca, and had me convinced he had betrayed Marcus. Of course, Donald Sutherland and Mark Strong can never do no wrong.

People will criticise the film for changing the plot of the book. Cottia is there in Games scene, but I suspect that a relationship between a 26 year old Marcus and a 12 year old girl would cause an uproar amongst modern audiences, no matter how historically accurate. As for Cub's absence, it would have been far too Disney [but if you re-read the book you will realize that Esca takes on the role of choosing to return to Marcus, instead of returning to the wild. I was pleased that they changed the chase scene, as the book ends with Marcus and Esca fleeing back to Hardian's Wall with only the slightest scuffle. It was as though Sutcliff was afraid to put Marcus into a suitation of danger and conflict, where MacDonald has Marcus looking failure direct in the face.",1308787200,2,1897,4.473988439306359
4469449,4,B004UMAPUO,"Last year I watched a movie called Centurion, which told what (apparently) happened to the ill-fated 9th Legion when they disappeared beyond Hadrian's Wall into the depths of primitive Scotland. The Eagle tells a different story - Marcus, invalided out of the Roman army with a leg wound, nips off beyond Hardian's Wall into the depths of primitive Scotland to find out what (apparently) happened to the ill-fated 9th Legion. Not the same at all.

To be fair, although both are drawn from the same basic source material, the two stories are not the same - Marcus' journey as far more of a Roman buddy movie, although ""buddy"" is perhaps straining things a bit. Marcus (Channing Tatum) is accompanied by his slave Eska (Jamie Bell), and there is a subtext of honour, obligation, and trust running through the film as the two of them go into the wilds to try to recover the lost Eagle of the 9th, and find out what happened to Marcus' father..

The Eagle is filmed on location in Scotland (which looks very Scottish) and Hungary (which often doesn't). Though it isn't as bleak as Centurion, it still looks pretty cold and wet and miserable much of the time. There's lots of action, much of it bloody, a couple of other well-known faces (Mark Strong, who isn't in it very much, and who sports an incongruous American accent, for instance), and vast numbers of Hungarians in supporting roles and as extras. The script isn't bad, and it's quite entertaining.",1308787200,2,1452,4.735177865612648

4469453,4,B004UMAPUO,"I went into this movie not expecting anything great, but I'd read the book and was hoping some of what made that story so unforgettable would translate to the screen. Surprisingly enough, while this was sort of an abridged version of Rosemary Sutcliff's 'The Eagle of the Ninth', basically covering only the highlights, it was both entertaining and captured just enough of the original story to make this something more than another brainless action flick. Even the action sequences were relevant to the plot and not tedious... in fact, its been a while since I enjoyed an action movie so much. Maybe because it wasn't really an action movie, when compared with other recent examples of the genre. Either way, there was not even a single boring minute.

I also found I was not in the least disappointed by the Marcus/Esca friendship, and while again, it wasn't as intricate as in the book, there is a definite sense of their loyalty to each other throughout. The fangirls out there will be positively giddy with delight with that aspect. It really was that slashy (and then some) and while it was worth watching for that alone, there was just so much more to this movie. I loved the message of loyalty, honor and duty. Just themes that never come across nowadays, and it was refreshing to see they hadn't been abandoned entirely.

While 'The Eagle' was blessedly free of CGI, don't let that fool you. From beginning to end every scene was visually stunning, and you'll find yourself getting so caught up in the story the lack of it will not be missed. In the least. I think that was even one of my favorite things about it.

The big question my customers keep asking is how the unrated fares versus what played in theaters, and the answer is much more along the lines of what a Roman battle film should be: It IS better and it would be rated R. The sound and picture are fine, but not what I would rate as anything special for color - as there is hardly any except one or two sequences. The DTS is adequate and was more about the small surrounds (dogs barking during the search, the cave sequence echoes) but the special features are what make this somewhat cheesy theatrical release a recommendation:

* Unrated cut, same run time. They left the sounds and sights of people being killed in this version (blood, a beheading, the sounds of throats being cut [removed in theatrical], etc. Cannot tell if they were removing the blood in the theatrical or adding it into the unrated, but either way it looks believable here.
* Alternate ending, 4:21 minutes. WAY better version and should have been used instead of that cheesy ending that ruined the main film. Some spoilers: they do not go back to Rome and they actually had written the dialogue correctly as to where their legion was from. Worth the watch.
* Making of, 12:12 minutes. A semi-narrated clip laden documentary that adequately covers most stages of production, informative and well made.
* Deleted scenes, 2 @ 6:20 minutes. Should have been left in as they added some nice character. A chariot race scene that would have made much more sense to the initial battle as to why he spears that driver; also the pig hunt sequence where you could tell they had cut out a long conversation by the river in the theatrical.
* Commentary, full length. This is a passion project for the guy so worth it if you are a huge fan of his work here.
* Dig Copy, non disc dependent.

Those first impressions were wildly off base. The Eagle is a serious and gritty mini-epic, a film that fully embraces themes of loyalty, friendship, and honor, set against the backdrop of sprawling vistas and historical authenticity. In previous films, Tatum displayed the charisma of aluminum foil and, while he's still a bit stiff, this is a good role for him--physical, jock-tough, brow-furrowed, and appears to be enjoying himself. However, as much as I love to champion under-the-radar sword-swinging actioners, I must stop short from a full-on chubby for this thing. The fights are filled with quick and choppy edits, which makes it tough to get a handle on the geography and the villain doesn't nearly get the comeuppance he deserved.

The current going theory is that they were wiped out in combat in the Eastern Provinces, but there's also a theory that they were destroyed fighting the Picts in what is now called Scotland. That's the jumping-off point for The Eagle, a rather lightweight sword and sandals film staring Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell.

Tatum plays Marcus Flavius Aquila, son of the commander of the Ninth Legion. He's gone into the army himself and worked hard to get sent to Britannia, where he hopes to not only recover his father's honor, but also that of the Legion and to recover it's beloved standard; a gold eagle. The Roman legions fetishized their eagles (or ""aquila"", a word suspiciously similiar to the last name of our hero), to an impressive degree. Better in many ways to lose every man in your legion than to lose your standard.

Anyhow, young Marcus gets to Britannia, takes command of a legion, promptly gets injured and drummed out of the service, then acquires Esca (Jamie Bell), a young slave. He eventually hatches a plan to find the Eagle and along with Esca, heads north into darkest Caledonia. Along the way the two fight, bond and generally have an interesting time of it.

I really enjoyed this movie. It was entertaining, well-done and well-paced. Several of the plot twists were telegraphed well in advance, including the biggest one, which was shown to us in the trailers. But that minor complaint aside, it was good. The historical accuracy was decent (though some of the tactics the Romans employ made me roll my eyes. Where's your pila, boys?), and anytime I see a movie with Romans not using stirrups I get a least a bit happy. Plus it was cool hearing the Picts speaking Gaelic. Yes, it wasn't Pictish, but it was the best they could do, and at least it wasn't the Pictsies. Also, the acting was quite decent, and Channing Tatum seems to have done a good job of redeeming himself after some of his other works.

But that hasn't stopped writers and moviemakers from speculating about what did happen. ""The Eagle"" is a solid adaptation of Rosemary Sutcliff's novel ""The Eagle of the Ninth"" -- a gritty, mud-slicked quest movie set in a time when Rome still ruled the world. Channing Tatum is a little wooden, but he's more than made up for by Jamie Bell's subtle performance.

Centurion Marcus Flavius Aquila (Tatum) is the son of the Ninth Legion's commander, and is determined to regain his family honor. But after he's horribly wounded in battle, he finds himself honorably discharged and facing a life of boredom... until he hears rumors that the Ninth Legion's golden eagle has been seen north of Hadrian's Wall. If he can get the eagle, his family's honor will be restored.

The problem is, no Roman has gone past the wall and lived to tell about it. So Aquila sets out to northern Britain, with his Briton slave Esca (Bell) as his only guide -- and quickly runs into deserters, rogue warriors, and the deadly blue-painted Seal People who helped destroy the Ninth Legion. Can they rely on each other long enough to find the golden eagle... and can they make it back to Roman land alive?

Of the three movies made about the Lost Legion in the last few years, ""The Eagle"" is probably the grittiest and most realistic -- there are no glorious battles, Hollywoodized Celts or Arthuriana. Instead, director Kevin Macdonald fills the movie with mud, rain, cold pale light, grimy little outposts, frenetic small battles and the spare expanses of Scotland.

And for the most part, the movie succeeds. It's a small, lean movie with a lot of underlying tension, and some hauntingly atmospheric scenes like the Seal People's firelit ceremonies, complete with a horned-god figure and lots of dancing/chanting. Also a nice touch: all the Britons speak Gaelic. It isn't entirely accurate, but is a nice change after countless movies where everybody speaks English. Even better, there are no subtitles, so we're as lost as Aquila whenever they speak.

The one downside: the climactic battle is visually beautiful -- it's savage, bloody and wild. But the conveniently-timed arrival of Aquila's allies is just too ""Hollywood.""

And Macdonald avoids identifying either the Romans or Britons as ""bad guys"" -- they both commit atrocities, but they both also have good honorable people as well. Esca and Aquila represent both their peoples in this story, so obviously the movie rests on the shoulders of Tatum and Bell. Tatum is rather wooden at first, but he gets more flexible and emotional as the movie goes on; and Bell gives a pitch-perfect performance as a proud young Briton with an iron-clad code of honor.

Sure, there are a few other actors of note in here -- Donald Sutherland and Mark Strong have brief, well-acted roles, and Tahar Rahim does an excellent job as the blue-skinned Mohawked prince of the Seal People, but the star roles are really what this story depends on.

As for this blu-ray edition, it will apparently contain the original PG-13 version, plus the unrated version. There is also going to be an alternate ending, deleted scenes, directorial commentary, a featurette about the making of the movie, smart phone interaction and something called UHear.

""The Eagle"" is a movie that feels very richly authentic, and has just enough mud, blood, rain and heather to make it seem as if you've traveled back in time.",1302480000,130,3547,4.916387959866221
4469468,5,B004UMAPUO,"The Eagle is a great film. The actors were well cast and the action is nonstop. Fans of the book should note that the movie is very different from the book, but both are wonderful and worth experiencing.",1301788800,6,203,4.368421052631579
4469469,4,B004UMAPUO,"Well, we've had tons of people slamming the film -- many whom I doubt could themselves act their way out of a paper bag -- and I am always amazed at those who have never done the work, nor been in the business (not even their backyard little theater), who render such wondrous opinions of who can act and who can't.

We've also had input on the historical accuracy involved; and a run through of the whole plot.  So what's left?

I went because I always look forward to ancient ""historical"" films, whether wonderful or not.  Many are terrible; the latter ones have definitely come up since the 50's.  (Among one of the worst ever, was Richard Burton's ""Alexander the Great."")  And while I would love to have seen more/better results from this film... I was very well pleased with what I saw.  Even if I could not for the life of me understand why Donald Sutherland would choose to have an estate in such a god-forsaken place, as much as if his were the only residence in that part of Britain.  How did he survive from being bored to death?  To leave the comforts of most Roman cities for a backwater?  And then, yes, the business of the Seal People reminded me definitely of ""American"" Indians, more than northern British savages.  It was also obvious the producers were on a tight budget, and spent their money judicuously.  But I was still pretty happy with the results.

Here, I saw Channing Tatum as one of the most perfectly cast Romans possible.  He had the look, the bearing, the character, and the attractiveness.  I've never seen him act before, but I was impressed enough to call this role for him: star-making.  (Wooden?  Go back to bed, people.  You wouldn't know a post from a stone.)  Granted, to enhance his standing, if Tatum could take off a year and enroll in the Actor's Studio, he might definitely be a true force in the making.  (From interviews, I understand he's never had any lessons.) Jamie Bell is also a pleasure to see, as well.  Something odd and intense and deep about him, both hard and sensitive  (The kid who made ""Billy Elliot"" magical.)

Further, while the characters of Channing and Jamie were supposed to be in strong cross-conflict with each other...
maybe this failed on both their parts.  No matter what they did, or what the script called for, or how they read their lines -- you just could not dismiss ""sensing"" the love these two guys had for each other, whether expressed or not, it was just there somehow.  And I was really pulling for their friendship to be shown, which it was eventually, but had to be somewhat repressed for the film.  (All this confirmed in later interviews, that they got along famously in person.)  So great!  Yeah, an undercurrent of homoeroticism -- so what?  It made the film alive, for me.  And probably saved it from being just a very dreary-some adventure in barren north Scotland.

The only other thing I missed was maybe somehow a greater emphasis on the symbol of the eagle.  It was there, but for me, not quite strong enough.  And too, I never could quite get over ""how"" the Seal People could buy the story of Marcus being Esca's slave.  Marcus was just too much of a standout, physically, etc.  It just didn't ring through.  However... the film itself had me groaning for more -- .  Loved it far better than ""The Centurion.""",1301702400,15,3303,4.5561224489795915

4469471,3,B004UMAPUO,"When my kids were young, I read them Rosemary Suttcliff's ""The Eagle of The Ninth."" We all really enjoyed the book--not just the story of Marcus and Esca (and Esca's tamed wolf) but the history of the Romans in Britain. My kids--now young adults--and I were really looking forward to seeing the movie.

Other reviewers have gone into detail regarding the plot, and some have pointed out that this film did okay as far as incorporating historically accurate elements. Basically, Marcus and his slave Esca venture into the wilds of Britain--beyond Hadrian's Wall--to retrieve the eagle standard of the Ninth Legion, which was under his father's command. As long as the standard remains lost, so does the honor of the Ninth Legion and Marcus's family.

As for the movie, I can't decide whether to give this a:

Thumbs up/Life, life!--Except for skipping the part about the wolf (save for one shot of a caged wolf cub), the movie stayed faithful to the book. During the initial battle scenes, the lorica musculata was a flattering look for Channing Tatum and crew.  Donald Sutherland, while he didn't have a big role as Marcus's uncle, is always good. The scenes with the warrior Seal People were pretty tense, too.

Or a:

Thumbs down/Death, death!--It's too bad that the dramatic tension wasn't sustained throughout the rest of the film, which dragged in some parts. That was disappointing. The dialogue was a bit stilted and cliched, but again, that was in line with Sutcliff's writing. It came across better in the book.

And why did Donald Sutherland serve eggs to his dignatary guests even though Marcus and Esca just killed a big boar? Wouldn't you think he'd prepare a rack of ribs?

In any case, we all agreed that this movie was just okay, and no match for the book.

Though billed as some sort of soldier/daddy-worship epic, with nary a woman in sight, this movie unravels into an amazing bromance that seems more like a love story between two young men from different walks of life than anything else.

Marcus(Channing Tatum) is forced out of his career as a soldier by battle wounds received while defending his first command post in distant Britain. The son of an infamous Roman commander who marched 5000 men into northern Britain and subsequently vanished, Marcus's dream of winning back his family's honor through soldierly deeds is summarily crushed by his discharge from service. Languishing in civilian life in his uncle's villa, Marcus' hatches a plan to win his family's honor back with the help of his Briton slave, Esca (Jamie Bell), by different means. Marcus will find the eagle standard of his father's lost legion by traveling into the hostile unconquered northern lands (Caledonia, or modern day Scotland) and Esca will lead the way. The tension and conflict between The Eagle's two main characters powers the movie along to its surprisingly up-beat conclusion.

It is a rare treat to see a movie that takes place in pre-Christian Britain. The costuming is impeccable and the people are gritty, filthy and refreshingly normal looking: no magic Hollywood showers or supermodel background characters ruin the believability of the time and place this movie hearkens to. As far as visual storytelling goes, I was impressed that so many plot points, shifts in attitude, and changes in relationships were indicated by simple glances, a change in wardrobe or what a character happened to be holding in a scene, without any dialogue whatsoever.

The strengths of this movie lie in its visual story telling, its pacing, and in the acting skills of its secondary characters. Jamie Bell gives an incredibly believable and understated performance as Esca. One of the most heart wrenching moments is the movie (and unquestionably the best acted monologue) is Esca's tale relating the fate of his family. There is no flowery verbage, no dramatic shouting, yet this simple soft-spoken monologue brought tears to my eyes. Tahir Rakhim's portrayal of the Seal Prince (a group of people entirely invented for this movie) was also done  with  staunch  realism and believability. The inclusion of Gaelic dialogue was a pleasant surprise that helped emphasizes the social and cultural differences that existed between the people of the British isle and the Roman invaders at that time. It was with the Roman actors that I felt a bit of a disconnect, finding the mannerisms and verbal ticks of Strong, O'Hare and Sutherland to be a little too modern, though Sutherland's up-beat performance was remarkably refereshing in an otherwise emotionally heavy movie.

I'm very fond of this movie but will admit its most immediate faults. A common historical inaccuracy is perpetrated in the gladiator scene, with the thumbs-up/thumbs-down being reversed. I fear that this may be a mistake the movie industry never rectifies. And while the movie holds together beautifully up until the final battle with the Seal People, around then the dialogue gets clunky and loses some of is brusque magic. Guern's "" I just have to tell you real quick yer dad wasn't a coward"" speech as well as Marcus's pyre speech made me cringe a little. Both were very heavy-handed and awkwardly performed. Also, a rather large plot hole was torn open with the murder of the Seal Boy. Are we actually to believe that while chasing Marcus and Esca down on foot, the Seal Warriors carried this kid along just to kill him? After the boy is laid down in the water, he is never seen again. Guern receives a hero's send off, and the child Esca befriended is nowhere to be seen. I doubt the boy's murdered needed inclusion at all. If his death was only to induce Esca to fight, well...it was already fairly reasonable to believe that because of their bond, he would have fought with Marcus anyway.

Overall, this movie is visually stunning and emotionally intense without being melodramatic (at least until that end bit), and so I happily recommend The Eagle to history buffs, fangirls and fangirls of history. It may not be perfect, but The Eagle has the rare ability to transport a viewer to another time and place for two hours. Give it your time, and you will certainly be amused.",1298419200,110,4842,5.198717948717949
4469476,5,B004UMAPUO,"I have not read Rosemary Sutcliff's book (The Eagle of the Ninth) but I understand that the book is more of a mystery whereas The Eagle is an action film.  Understandably, lovers of the book will be disappointed but, of course, translating a book to the screen is rarely satisfying.

I found that The Eagle was better than I expected. The opening of the film, set in the reign of Antoninus Pius (around 140 CE), gives a gritty picture of Roman camp life.  Marcus Aquila has arrived in Britain to command the same cohort commanded by his father, who is responsible for the loss of an eagle standard.  The film wavers a bit in being precise about the organization of a cohort and a legion but this is not critical to enjoy the film.  The day-to-day life in camp is nicely depicted with the high point begin a battle with the Britons who have captured the members of a Roman patrol.  The discipline of the Romans is nicely portrayed as they form a testudo formation to rescue their comrades. The costumes are not bad but reflect more of the Hollywood version of ancient dress. The soldiers have the correct footwear but the armor is segmented leather.

Spoilers below.
Marcus is wounded and recovers at a villa owned by his uncle, nicely played by Donald Sutherland. During a gladiatorial combat, Marcus sees a salve named Esca who refuses to fight and saves his life, becoming his slave in turn. Marcus decides to bring back the Eagle to restore the good name of his father and sets of with Esca acting as an interpreter. They make their way into the Scottish highlands where they are captured by the Seal People, who paint themselves a gray-blue.  Esca turns the tables on Marcus by claiming the Roman is his slave.  The Seal People look more like American Indians by their clothing and wearing bones for decoration.

End of spoilers

Channing Tatum is well cast as Marcus. He is the very image of a Roman soldier, brooding over his family's loss of honor and conveying a strong sense of loyalty to his soldiers.  Jamie Bell also fills his part very well conveying Esca's reluctant but growing admiration of Marcus.  Mark Strong makes a brief appearance, this time not as a villain, as one of the Roman soldiers that survived the massacre of the cohort and went native.  Overall, The Eagle is a good action film that keeps your interest. It is beautifully photographed and well acted.",1298332800,6,2383,4.629453681710213
