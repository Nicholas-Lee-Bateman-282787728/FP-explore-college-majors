3830365,5,B001ZGUJT0,"Bwa ha ha -- the master of the midnight movie is back, after far too long an absence from the scene, with what one might actually accept as the ultimate ""grrl power"" flick.

But acceptance is not Henenlotter's purpose here.  His aim as usual is to entertain, shock, and amuse, and he attains his goals on his accustomed shoe-string budget.

Indeed, part of the fun of this DVD is listening to the commentary, in which the outre auteur and his young white-boy-rapper producer describe the guerilla movie-making techniques they employed to realize this bizarre sexual fantasy.  The fact that they accidentally set fire to the 150-year-old mansion they rented for a whopping $4,000 as the film's primary location -- and then extinguished the flame with diet soda -- gives you some clue that this was not a normal shoot!

And then there are the purple-hued ""penis-cam"" shots...

Suffice it to say that if you enjoy ""Something Weird"" videos, you will likely enjoy this film, which also features one of the most tragic ""happy endings"" you will ever see.

As the director says on the commentary, at the consummation of this unusual love story, ""Now there's something you don't see every day.""  That's what makes this film -- and Henenlotter himself -- so special...",1265760000,3,1258,4.873239436619718
3830366,1,B001ZGUJT0,"I anxiously awaited the release of Frank Henenlotter's new opus BAD BIOLOGY.  After all, his BASKET CASE, BRAIN DAMAGE, and FRANKENHOOKER are master works and three of the funniest movies ever.  They are films that work on several levels.  Entertaining from start to finish, they're imaginative, extremely well written, edgy, and have underlying, serious themes explored intelligently.  BASKET CASE examines alienation in society and within families.  BRAIN DAMAGE is a hard look at the horrors of drug addiction.  FRANKENHOOKER touches on losing a loved one early in life.

I even love the liner notes Mr. Henenlotter wrote for his Special Edition series released on Something Weird Video.  It's obvious as well that he's probably one of the nicest guys in show business.

BAD BIOLOGY, like the others, is professionally-made on a small budget.  However, its content is thoroughly ugly and unfunny.  There's no compassion shown for the leads, and no wit to speak of.  The best moments are but brief and pale imitations of the earlier movies.  Even the climax is dull viewing.  I'm inclined to place all the blame for this confused mess on producer and co-writer R.A. Thorburn.  His god-awful rap-video, included on the dvd, has him throwing gallons of his fecal matter on a lovely nude woman.  That he thinks it's entertaining is depraved.  It doesn't even have shock value.  It just disgusts, and mostly conveys he has no musical sensibility whatsoever.

I suppose I'm predjudiced because I didn't like Mr. Thorburn much the first time I saw him, revisiting locations with Mr. Henenlotter on the Special Edition of BASKET CASE.

I imagine the movie couldn't have been made without Thorburn's financial contribution.  It's a shame he didn't simply choose to be a silent partner and leave Frank alone to do what he does better than anyone else.  A great opportunity has been wasted.",1264982400,4,1882,5.061889250814332

 ________________________________________________________________________

Director Frank Henenlotter always walks the fine line between psychedelic brilliant freak show extraordinaire and abhorrent immature smut peddlin' freak.  With bizarre little gems like Basket Case, Brain Damage, and Frankenhooker, he always keeps you off balance.  And here with Bad Biology, he pushes you completely over the edge.  This has got to be his craziest stuff yet.

Jennifer is born with a gift (or curse) from God--some extra sweet spots below the belt.  7 of 'em, in fact.  This caused her to start menstrating at age 5, and currently makes her reproductive organs function at an accelerated rate.  Plus she suffers from ESAS (Extreme Sexual Arousal Syndrome).  Her crazy libido nearly controls her every action, and this heightened sexuality often turns deadly for her bedroom partners.  She gets a little too crazy-hot-excited, to put it mildly.  And to top it all off, she frequently gives a quick birth to some mutated monster babies, which she quickly discards in the nearby trash.  Sheesh!

Next we have Bax, a man with some private problems of his own.  On the day he was born, the doctor made a horrible mistake when attempting to cut off his umbilical cord.  Ouch!  Bax got stitched up, but had problems functioning when he got older.  So he decided to inject steroids and some growth hormones, and the problem expanded out of control.  So he is toting around a monster with a mind of its own, in which he constantly has to search for the proper prescription (and non-prescription) drugs to appease this thing.  Double Sheesh!

I know, this story is completely ridiculous.  It gets even worse when the two hookup.  But before that special outrageous love connection is made, another huge disaster occurs.  I better stop here, I don't wanna spoil it for the one guy who is actually thinking about watching this movie.

Just classic Henenlotter.  Low budget, bizarre, and spewing with raunchy creativity.  Hilarious stuff.  Recommended for demented B-movie fans only.",1264982400,11,2224,5.235795454545454
3830368,2,B001ZGUJT0,"The horror films of director Frank Henenlotter are always narratively outrageous and visually over-the-top, so when moviegoers familiar with his approach to horror stories and his cinematic style see the name HENENLOTTER on a project, they expect to get an eyeful and an earful.  But with his earlier films like BASKET CASE (1982), BRAIN DAMAGE (1988), and FRANKENHOOKER (1990), the writer/director delivers more than bizarre story lines and over-the-top gore and FX.  While outrageously fun in a grindhouse kind of way, each of these films also has a subtext that offers a culturally relevant, highly satirical commentary on Western society and human foibles.  However, after watching BAD BIOLOGY--the director's long-awaited return to the movie biz--fans of Henenlotter's other films will be left scratching their heads and wondering WTF?

Like Henenlotter's FRANKENHOOKER, the writer-director's BAD BIOLOGY tackles the themes of human sexuality and Western sexual mores.  The problem, though, is that the once witty and iconoclastic filmmaker doesn't seem to have anything left to say about such topics.  His story revolves around a girl who was born with a vaginal mutation that makes it impossible for her to be satisfied by any normal man or woman, and in her quest to rectify her problem, she stumbles across a boy who, because of his own genital deformity, just might be able to satiate her every need and desire.  Unfortunately for her, the boy hasn't emotionally adjusted to his biological defect as well as she has to her own, and because of his reluctance to let nature take its course, his (ahem!) manhood has decided to take matters into its own ""hands.""  Clearly, the film's plot is paper thin and somewhat cliched, but it could be a vehicle for biting satire in the hands of a master like Henenlotter. Sadly, however, the filmmaker's usual sarcastic and curmudgeonly sense of humor is almost totally absent.  Instead of delivering wry observations about the absurdity of human behavior and the hypocrisy of Western social practices and traditions, BAD BIOLOGY offers little more than copious T&A shots and a little (very) soft-core porn action.  Even the film's bizarre climax (excuse the pun) seems to be nothing more than an excuse for Henenlotter to be inordinately blasphemous while delivering a couple of bad (as in NOT FUNNY) sight gags about male genitalia.

Shriek Show's DVD edition of an unrated version of BAD BIOLOGY offers the film in its intended aspect ratio of 1.78:1 (not the 1.33:1 ratio indicated in some reports), and the transfer from 35mm film to digital is stunning.  This is a real plus, especially considering that the cinematography is one of the best things about the film.  The sound quality, however, is another story.  Audio is offered in both 2.0 and 5.1 Dolby Surround, but in both mixes, dialogue is often muffled by the ambient sound and FX, especially when a scene is set in a public place such as a nightclub.  DVD extras include some behind-the-scenes footage, a Henenlotter-directed video from R.A. The Rugged Man (a rap singer who produced the film and contributed to the soundtrack), and a feature commentary with the director and the producer.

Warning: There is a bug in the DVD's menu system that causes the disc to stall when it is loading on a blu-ray player.  Fortunately, users can get around this by hitting the player's MENU button, which then opens the disk's root menu.  As far as could be determined through testing, this bug only seems to manifest itself on blu-ray players and does not seem to occur when the disk is played in a standard DVD player.

In short, BAD BIOLOGY is an unsatisfying horror film, especially for fans of Henenlotter who are hoping, after a long wait, for another one of the legendary filmmaker's over-the-top but meaningful satires.  If T&A, bad sex jokes, and groan-generating sight gags about genitalia are all you're after, this might be the film for you.  Otherwise, you'll just have to keep waiting to see if Henenlotter makes a true comeback.",1264809600,4,4042,5.011958146487294
3830369,4,B001ZGUJT0,"Director Frank Henenlotter outdid himself with this film. I can see it becoming a cult classic in no time at all. It's funny, weird, and entertaining all rolled up into one sick package. In a nutshell, the movie is about a photographer named Jennifer who's a nympho that was born with seven clitorises! So yeah, Jennifer is a bit of freak, but she's one horny freak who sexually satisfies herself by way of one-night stands in the hope of finding Mr. Right, but in mutant form much like herself.

Charlee Danielson, who plays the quirky Jennifer, is sexy and funny. She manages to pull off the role very convincingly. I'd like to see her do more roles like this.

Anyway, once I reached the end of the film, I was left feeling disturbed by what Jennifer had done and yet amused, too. It's a strange feeling. Guys, you better see this with your male friends because it may be too far out for the ladies.

I will definitely buy this for my collection. Hey, what can I say.",1257984000,3,970,4.438202247191011

3830371,1,B001ZGUJT0,"Bad Biology (Frank Henenlotter, 2008)

About half an hour into Bad Biology, cult director Frank Henenlotter's first film in sixteen years, there's a scene that typifies everything that's wrong with the movie. We get about five minutes of entirely unintelligible street patois, and then we cut to a scene of a man berating a woman because he can't understand what she's saying. It's that sort of thoughtfulness that makes me wonder why Henenlotter didn't spend another sixteen years revising the script.

I love the premise of this movie: two people who, shall we say, get overexcited when they're making love (this inevitably results in the deaths of their partners) are living in the same city, but are unaware of one another's existence until a chance meeting. It's obvious they're made for one another, but they've both had such terrible experiences before that they're shy around one another and afraid to reach out. It's a great idea. Unfortunately, the execution is a little off. In fact, aside from the idea, there's not a single thing about this movie that makes me want to recommend it. The acting is competent at best (and isn't usually as its best), the direction is lackluster, the soundtrack is far more horrifying than the special effects, which are at least amusing at times, in that sort of toilet-humor way we're not supposed to find amusing after fifth grade, but is a guilty pleasure for almost everyone I know.

If you find yourself watching this, don't think about what is. Think about what might have been, and pray for a remake. *",1242950400,2,1553,4.8528301886792455
3830372,5,B001ZGUJT0,"Allllrightty!!!  The king of shlock-horror, studly-perverse director Frank Henenlotter (Basket Case, Brain Damage, Frankenhooker) returns after a 16 years hiatus with BAD BIOLOGY.  And dang it, I gotta know...WHEN IS THE REGION 1 RELEASE?  Anybody?!?!  (cricket, cricket)
I can't stand this torment and anticipation!

It's the story of Jennifer, the sex-maniac that can't find a man who can satisfy her.  This is most likely due to the fact that she possess 7 uh...uhm...Sweet Spots? between her legs.  Yeah, she is the ultimate vortex of fierce sexual energy.  All the fellas inadequacies will cost them dearly.

Then she finally meets a young stud.  A man with a 5 dollar foot long.  No, I'm not talking about Subway.  Heck, he might be packing a 2 footer.  Anyway, he injected some steroids(baseball player?) into his Johnson and is now ready to do some damage.  This is what it's like when worlds collide!

I think there is a mutant baby involved in this story too.  Probably lots of nudity and gory madness.  Sorry I can't say for sure.  Anyone with any info about this please share!

3830378,4,B001ZGUJT0,"This film is 25% Cronenberg and 65% Henenlotter & 10% hip-hop.
While we get the same themes Henenlotter took from the Tom Reamy story The Detweiler Kid (if his oeuvre wasn't inspired by this F&SF story I'll eat my hat,)  he had never addressed the female aspect of it, (well, he kinda did in Basket Case II & III, but not to the extent he does here.)

Bad Biology is apparently a natural progression from Basket Case and Brain Damage (with a definite hip-hop sensibility which might seem strange for someone of Henenlotter's generation, but if you think about it maybe not so much.) Is this the movie Henenelotter wanted to make all along?

The monsters here are a mutant female (the Cronenberg inspired portion) who would fit nicely in Rabid, Shivers, Dead Ringers, etc. and a guy who seems, at this point, to be your typical Henenlotter hero.
The movie is basically set up to have them 'meet cute.'
So what we get is a sort of live action, horror version of a Tijuana Bible (strange that I recently mentioned Eveready Harton / Buried Treasure in another thread:

http://monsterkidclassichorrorforum.yuku.com/topic/59834/Talk-to-Her-2002-aka-Hable-Con-Ella-spoilers#.VawMuqRVhBc )

...or maybe some kind of variant of The Horny Goof (by Moebius) or, at least what story is implied in some of its panels.

The overall story is somewhat weak, the acting often seems amateurish, with scenes with crazy, colorful characters which don't integrate well to the overall story.
Effects are mostly physical with a crude, old-style charm: fans should find these perfectly acceptable. The film does lack the charm and personality of a Belial or Aylmer character. We also get the constant struggle to exploit, but to also include feminist commentary and themes as possible justification(?) or maybe just appeasement of potential critics.

3830383,2,B001ZGUJT0,"Jennifer (Charlee Danielson) describes herself as her own species. She is different from other women. She says to camera that she has 7 clits. Furthermore, after having sex she gives birth to a mutant baby only 2 hours later - babies that she just abandons to die.

Batz (Anthony Sneed) has a problem with his penis. It is enormous and seems to have a mind of its own. When he has sex with a woman she continues to orgasm hours later.

Jennifer witnesses this and wishes to have sex with Batz. The result is a disaster for them both.

I gave this film 2 stars for originality. It gets no more than this because of generally poor acting, and a script ending that makes no sense. The mutant penis breaks away from Batz and goes on a rampage of raping women. There is no apparent reason for this and we don't ever see what results. However each time the mutant breaks through floor-boarding so it seems the director is obsessed with this effect/image. There's quite a lot of nudity as we see about half a dozen different women being attacked - albeit very very briefly and not very explicitly.

Jennifer kills a couple of her lovers for no real reason either. Her attitude to her abandoned babies is amoral.

Further confusion is where she talks to camera like in a documentary, even warning the camera not to go to the bathroom to visit where a screaming mutant baby lies abandoned. The camera ignores her and we get to see it. Is it a documentary/1st person film? Not in other bits.",1363219200,,1481,4.470370370370371

3830385,4,B001ZGUJT0,"After more or less retiring in the early 90s after Basket Case 3, Frank Henenlotter is back in the game!  It's a welcome return and he certainly hasn't grown up, which is good.  In recent years he has teamed up with a rap artist called RA The Rugged Man.  RA did the music for this film and co-wrote it as well, which probably accounts for the large number of white rapper types in the film.
Bad Biology is billed as a ""God-Awful Love Story"", but to me it's not much of a love story at all, god-awful or not.  The two leads don't actually meet until the end of the film, and it's not even the least bit romantic.
The two central characters are a man and woman who each have enhanced and/or added sexual equipment.  In Henenlotter's world this translates to mutated and deformed!  This causes problems for their sex partners/victims who seem to suffer from coming in contact with them.
The two leads are more or less made for one another to engage sexually.  Like I said though, their meeting isn't until the last act and it doesn't run as smoothly planned.
This isn't Henenlotter's best I must say, but that also means it's much better than a lot of stuff out there that tries for the old grindhouse vibe.  It's as sexually crude as possible without becoming pornographic, so don't watch it with the kiddies.  That may be one of the problems too is that it's more or less a nonstop sexathon when a bit more story could have been focused on.  Henenlotter's films, while outrageous, were always a step ahead because of good characters and story.  Nobody here is all that interesting to be honest.  Also, the stop motion animated disembodied penis with a sinister mind of it's own was done before in the Russ Meyer tribute film, Pervert!
But even with that being said, it's still pretty entertaining and occasionally quite funny.  In this crappy age of digital, Henenlotter gives us the added treat of shooting in 35mm!

The first half of the movie is rather slow considering it shows one sexual encounter after another until the two main characters meet.

The movie does show some interesting techniques to ummm deal with the main characters' issues but aside from a few of those we found rather funny (and I am not sure they were ment to be funny) that was pretty much all we got out of it.
