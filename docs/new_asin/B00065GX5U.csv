This is a fun, colorful way to explore the time-line of art.  You will see pieces from post impressionism to pop art and modern art literally transform and transition into another.

8038929,5,B00065GX5U,Saw this for the first time finally.  Wow!  How'd she do it?  Absolutely incredibly amazing morphing artistic abilities.,1246579200,,120,5.555555555555555
8038930,5,B00065GX5U,"My wife (an art major) and I (a hobbyist animator) saw the title feature on PBS' ""The Territory"" last night, great fun trying to guess all the many art works.  Munch's ""Scream"", Warhol's Marilyn, Picasso, etc., etc.  Sort of a stream of consciousness dream tour through a really good modern art museum, via a cool animation technique (""clay painting"" I think they called it - more 2D than claymation).",1146009600,,401,4.797101449275362
8038931,5,B00065GX5U,"I've got to hand it Hen's Tooth Video - they've put together a great little package here.  You get the Academy Award-winning ""Mona Lisa Descending a Staircase,"" as well as three full-length bonus shorts ""The Dowager's Feast,"" ""Pro and Con,"" and ""The Dowager's Idyll.""  The transfers for each are terrific, and if you're not familiar with Joan Gratz or her work, you get a nice ""Artist's Statement"" and ""Biography"" printed on the inside cover.  For people who appreciate clay animation, experimental animation, art history or a woman's rightful place in the history of animation, this DVD is a must-have!

Don't be surprised if you start looking into the work of Joanna Priestley (who has begun to put out her own DVD compilations - check them out!) as well!",1107043200,,757,4.890625
