7626554,4,B01BCNJ7TS,"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, especially when it's the 1985 Chicago Bears football team ripping a hole in yet another opponent on its way to winning the Superbowl as the 2016 E.S.P.N. television documentary THIRTY FOR THIRTY: THE EIGHTY-FIVE BEARS recalls.  As I selected this title on my movie streaming service, I thought the film's one hour, 41 minute running time might be too long, considering it was about but one season in the history of an N.F.L. franchise but it holds your attention.

While players Walter Payton, Jim McMahon and William Perry as well as head coach Mike Ditka were the stars, THE EIGHTY-FIVE BEARS reminds us those four could not have have been in a position to stand out if not for contributions from individuals only hardcore fans can name without a scorecard.  As if to drive the point home, the film prominently features some of those team members and assistant coaches, the observations and recollections they share proving as compelling as the comments of the star players who sit for interviews.

As I write this in 2016, only eight teams have won two consecutive Superbowls (and none has had three victories in a row) the 50 times the game's been played.  Considering how dominant the Bears were the year they won, THE EIGHTY-FIVE BEARS notes some feel as though the team might have repeated or at least won another over the next couple of seasons had certain individuals' skyrocketing celebrity not distracted them from the job of winning.  The documentary also suggests the club was a victim of its own hole-ripping style, as their opponents used it against the Bears in subsequent seasons.

Finally, THIRTY FOR THIRTY: THE EIGHTY-FIVE BEARS leaves you with a sentiment shared by a number of the team members: The pain and sacrifice it took to win the Superbowl was worth it, and they'd pay that high price to do it again.",1459296000,5,1877,4.7746913580246915
7626555,5,B01BCNJ7TS,"Just watched this documentary on ESPN 2 & it was like traveling back in time to 1985 to see one of the greatest football teams that ever took the field (Some even say the best of all time).  There are lots of great stories & video clips from the various games during the '85 season and some of the topics include: the tension between Head coach - Mike Ditka & Defensive coach - Buddy Ryan, making it to the Super Bowl, the reason they weren't a dynasty (even though many thought they could've been), the craziness of being celebrities when they were off the field & the eventual health problems that were a result of yrs of injuries & concussions.  There's also great interviews with coaches Ditka & Ryan, several players like Jim McMahon, Mike Singleterry, William ""The Refrigerator"" Perry & sports journalists who covered the Bears.  It's also well narrated by actor & Chicago native - Vince Vaughn.

Anyway, this show is very informative & interesting to watch & it's hard not to respect and like these guys. Even if you're a Lions fan like I am.  Haha.",1455148800,17,1056,4.5661375661375665

7626558,5,B01BCNJ7TS,"I'm a huge fan of the 30 for 30 series. It has some of the best sports documentaries ever made, and this MIGHT be THE BEST of all of them. ANY football fan will love this, Bear fan or not. I remember the '85 Bears, the SuperBowl Shuffle, The Fridge, etc. This documentary does a great job of showing all the characters of one of the greatest NFL teams of all time & just how incredibly dominant they were. The interviews show how much larger than life these guys' personalities were (Steve McMichael, Ditka, Dan Hampton, The Fridge, McMahon). Mongo's interviews are some of my favorites. You can't help but love how he talks about Sweetness (Walter Payton).

The part that really gets me is when they hand ""The Letter"" to Mike Singletary. I always think of and his piercing gaze and him being mic'd up, yelling: ""We gon' be here all day, Baby...I like this kind of party!"" He'd always had the reputation of a dominant, passionate defensive field general. His reaction is one you wouldn't expect.  It exemplifies how those defensive players feel about Buddy Ryan.

ESPN, it will be incredibly difficult to top this one. I don't think you can.",1490745600,,1141,4.610837438423645

7626566,4,B01BCNJ7TS,"This is a sad story, as this team could have, should have won more and had more than just this one dream season, and the players and coaches acknowledge that... and they have other sadnesses, too, as some members of that team tragically were no longer with us by the time the film was made.

7626569,5,B01BCNJ7TS,"If NFL fans were polled to determine who was the best team of all time, the '85 Bears would win by a landslide.

There were that good, plain and simple. It started with Buddy Ryan, the architect of the 46 defense.

The 18-1 team had 9 Pro Bowlers and outscored their opponents 91-10 in three playoff games including 2 shutouts. They allowed a total of 198 points, an average of 12.4 points per game. Even more famous than their playing were the personalities on the team. Out of the team grew the ""Da Bears"" skits and ""The Super Bowl Shuffle"" which is the only hit single ever by an American professional team of any sport.

What a great collection of talent. The documentary is their time capsule to those who witnessed the season and to those who never saw them play. There will be never another team like the '85 Bears.

All in all, '85 Bears is the greatest NFL team of all time.",1482710400,,883,4.365853658536586

7626578,5,B01BCNJ7TS,"I am not a huge football fan, but I love this documentary! My wife even enjoys it. We have watched it many times. Who would not like a story about one of the most amazing sports teams to ever come together.  I am not referring to the Chicago Bears, I am referring to the players and defensive coach that made up the 1985 Chicago Bears.
I never claim loyalty to a brand or company. I give no loyalty to anything that cant give loyalty back. I only give loyalty to people and that is what we see with the 1985 Bears. They were a true team. They broke the rules and were dysfunctional in all the right ways!
This is not just a great documentary centered on football, it is a great one about leadership and working as a team!",1472860800,6,721,4.15
7626579,5,B01BCNJ7TS,"The 1985 Chicago Bears were the greatest team ever!  Defense was an A+, and, let's not forget ""sweetness"" (34), Walter Payton, the offensive line, receivers, and their crazy fun quarterback.  They played with joy, and, we loved every minute.  This film captured the love these guys had for each other and the game they played with total abandon.",1472601600,2,345,4.913793103448276
7626580,5,B01BCNJ7TS,"Another great episode of ESPN's excellent 30 for 30 series. This one chronicles the controversial and dominant Chicago Bears 1985 team that steamrolled past the rest of the league on their way to hoisting the Lombardi trophy. This places particular emphasis on their dominant defense, coached by the late Buddy Ryan, who was still alive but in bad health for this episode. His scenes and the bond evident that he still had with his former players provide the most compelling moments of this documentary but the whole thing is excellent and gives you unprecedented insight into this legendary and complicated team.

A note about the specifications of this DVD: there are a couple bonus features, which are quick statements by the director about the film. Also, the running time listed (77 minutes) is incorrect. Luckily, it's actually about 25 minutes longer, running at close to 102 minutes!",1472601600,8,891,5.061224489795919

7626583,5,B01BCNJ7TS,"Gingus Kahn would have been proud of this Bears team.  Not only did they vanquish their opponents, they left mangled carnage in their wake, and terror among their foes unlike any team before them.  I was fortunate enough to know a few of them and to be in Chicago in the middle of their violent, beautiful coup of the staid, stiff NFL empire.  This band of barking marauders smashed the walls and seized the NFL throne like the Vandals trashing Rome.  The entire team was uber-talented, nasty and unbeatable and they knew it, and so did the league.  This film does a great job of re-capturing a bit of the zany and fear-inspiring escapades of this team on and off the field.  It also found the soft underbelly of this beast of a squad by featuring Buddy Ryan's genius, and tough love of his warriors.  A profound love that was reciprocated by every man on his roster--even the offensive players.  I must admit, I went through a few tissues.  The city of Chicago took on the personality of this fearsome group and we were caught up in the insanity with them.  There are so many more stories and sidebars that could have been told here.  It's no wonder the '85 Bears live on in myth and might among their legion of sycophants like me.",1470873600,7,1232,4.455357142857143
