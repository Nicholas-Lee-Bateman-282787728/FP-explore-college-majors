I have learned the first part of this form from Chen Zhenglei's dvd.  It's a good way to start if you don't have a local teacher, I know it takes a long time to understand the moves on a deeper level but these dvd's give you the opportunity to start studying with a master of Taijiquan.",1372464000,,435,3.9655172413793105
