7964567,3,B000068TRJ,"HOT 4 HAVASU is another DVD of girls in their late teens/early 20s in swimsuits flashing the camera, this time at Lake Havasu in Arizona. There are lots of girls and guys both on boats, but it's only the girls that are shown naked. This is a pretty good DVD, but not as good as the best in the ""Crazy Chicks"" and ""Girls Gone Wild"" series. The vast majority of this is topless shots and swimsuit T & A shots, but there is a slight bit of full nudity. There's not as much nudity on here as on some DVDs of those other series I mentioned, but the bikini shots are very nice too.

There are plenty of good looking girls on here for sure, and a bunch of them are considerably stacked.  However, the cameras here are a little more wobbly than on some similar DVDs, and a few shots are way underexposed, yet most of the time picture quality is acceptable if you're not too picky. Sometimes it looks like the camera person was extending the telephoto lens way out to show some girl with her top off, and that made the image wobbly. The sound is mostly live, with looping rock music usually going in the background. Image ratio is 1.33:1, and run time is 50 minutes, which is rather stingy. Editing is decent. The disc has a chapter search, and long trailers for 3 other DVDs.

Despite my reservations, this DVD is worth having, especially if you can get a good price on it.",1393891200,,1365,4.282945736434108
