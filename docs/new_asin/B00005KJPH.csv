7943534,5,B00005KJPH,"""Diana, the uncrowned Queen, will always haunt the family that rejected her."" That about sums everything up. Diana was certainly the only one worthy of continuing the British royal family. At a time when it makes no moral or financial sense to continue this ""monarchy"", Diana's mix of compassion while maintaining ancient family heritage proved that a royal could hold their station and care about the people at the same time. None of the British royal family can say the same, not even Diana's kids who have completely given over to the dark side. The British royal family are so out of touch with the people, there is no reason for the people to support them anymore.",1512259200,,669,4.726495726495727
7943535,5,B00005KJPH,"Touching biopic about the late, beloved Princess Diana (may G-d rest her Soul). A nicely varied documentary with mixed footage about the beautiful life and ultimately tragic death of this philanthropic aristocrat and royal. This doco about a woman who touched the heart of the world in a unique way is worth watching.",1483747200,,317,5.0

7943537,5,B00005KJPH,i've seen a lot of Lady Di videos and this one is by far my favorite!  Really well done and loads of insightful interviews and clips from various parts of her life.,1385769600,4,164,4.125
7943538,2,B00005KJPH,"This DVD is not about the Princess's life, it contains no interesting footage, like one from her wedding or from the early 80's...",1106611200,5,130,4.695652173913044
7943539,1,B00005KJPH,"In the strange mirror-world of celebrity people are very often the reverse of what they seem. JF Kennedy a faithful husband? Diana was not what she seemed to the hoi polloi. To put it bluntly, she couldn't even keep staff for very long before they tired of her psychotic antics.",1102464000,2,278,4.58
7943540,1,B00005KJPH,You'll be disappointed if you spend anything on this DVD. Please do not buy it.,1100736000,4,79,4.333333333333333
7943541,2,B00005KJPH,I was disappointed with this DVD because most of the footage seemed to have been filmed after Diana's divorce. I was hoping for more older footage from the 1980s.,1099267200,13,162,4.620689655172414
7943542,3,B00005KJPH,I gave this 3 stars for lack of origional material.  The old footage is still nice to have in a compact format.,1024358400,10,111,4.045454545454546
7943543,4,B00005KJPH,"This program was based on copyright 1998 material so it is dated but still one of the best Diana DVD's out there. I know of three, Diana: People's Princess (hard to find but look for it), Diana & Dodi (the worst one of the bunch), and this one. Here you get a selection of scenes from throughout the Princess's life, even a few that I hadn't seen elsewhere on tape or DVD. The price is fantastic, the picture quality is good considering the source material. Not much to complain about except the editing, some material is arranged in an odd order or needs renarrated to give a stronger Diana angle. You get the usual crop of interviews from the usual people (just once I'd like to hear her really close friends), some material appears to be duplicated from the Prince William: Future King video.",1007856000,36,795,4.527777777777778
