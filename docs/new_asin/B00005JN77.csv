7940095,5,B00005JN77,I saw the kurt russell one. This is the winner. It does not rely on a huge budget or lots of name stars. It has some stars. It shows how the team was formed. It shows the hardships. It is also shows the real team at the end of the movie. It also tells what happened to members of the team after their victory. Great movie!,1489795200,2,322,3.893939393939394

7940097,5,B00005JN77,"""Miracle On Ice"" Was a Great movie starring Karl Malden as Head Coach of the 1980 USA Olympic Hockey Team that Beat The Russians as one of the Best Hockey Teams in the World. The USA Olympic Team last Beat the Russians on the Ice was 20 Years earlier in 1960. If you are a Hockey fan or a sports fan you need to see this movie!! Even the non sports fan should see this movie especialy if you are an American!",1297036800,2,408,3.9878048780487805
7940098,2,B00005JN77,"If you read my review for ""Miracle"" (2004) I will repeat this once more: ""STEVE GUTTENBERG AS JIM CRAIG?! PETER HORTON AS JACK O'CALLAHAN?!"" Well I finally found a copy of ""Miracle on Ice"" (and so can you- [...]) and I agree with everyone who watched this with a spoonful of logic, Karl Malden was too old to play Herb Brooks. But this ABC Sunday night family teledrama was definitely not a vehicle to display anybody's acting talent.

But I will admit this, MOI was made on the cheap and produced clumsily chock full of 80s cliches and overacting (with Jerry ""Killer"" Houser to round things out), but it follows Boys of Winter down to Jimmy's net hogging snobbery and Herb's hate-hate relationship with Kaminsky. However I can't help but agree with Danny Brooks, both Russel and Malden portrayed Brooks too softly. The real Mike Eruzione was the on-set consultant between his special appearances and motivational speaking gigs, but I can't help but feel that Andrew Stevens dumbed Rizzo down a bit.

The clips from USA Hockey's tourney tour, Olys footage, and the entire medal ceremony was the best part, but Bah's singing was sickeningly over the top. I can't help but feel this was yet another way for the Olympic network at the time to cash in further on USA Hockey's success. I am glad that it tells a story about the team rather than just focusing on Brooks' angst, regardless of the questionable quality. Enjoy it as a corny TV classic, because those golden days are long gone.",1256428800,3,1484,4.703846153846154
7940099,5,B00005JN77,"This is a great movie.  I loved this movie just as much as the late Kurt Russel version, Miracle.  Moreover, they are almost the same movie.  What makes this one more special is all the original footage (at least it appears to be).  Any movie or documentary on the greatest moment in sports is a must-see.  This movie makes you really miss the amateur days as well as the ""us versus them"" hype of the olympics during the cold war.  Indeed, it was a different time, a different country and a different people....",1139788800,9,511,4.440860215053763
7940100,1,B00005JN77,"I saw this version on TV, and while Karl Malden is a fine actor, nobody could have made this incredibly lame script believable, and Malden just didn't get Herb Brooks.  'Miracle' is a much better movie, with a much better screenplay.  They were painstaking with the recreated hockey scenes in the later movie, and went into much greater detail. Watch 'Miracle,' especially the extra bonus features on the 2nd DVD. The other reviewer probably praised the acting and script of Revenge of the Sith as well.",1118707200,6,503,4.837209302325581
7940101,5,B00005JN77,"This original 1981 movie of how the Americans beat the Russians in the 1980 Olympics is much better than the bogus remake""Miracle"" starring Kurt Russell. It's a must see!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1117497600,10,184,5.379310344827586
