8750061,5,B01BGDI664,"Taken as an example of corrupt Russian officialdom, it's rather a universal drama of the moral turpitude of life-and-death power.  One decent police officer stands against the system that tries to protect him; but in order to save himself and his own family he must execute the innocent anyway.  I see no problem with transposing this story to anywhere in the world - even to all-American locales such as Ferguson, Missouri.  Say what one will for the ""Russian system"" exposed here: Russian cinema at least tackles these issues (as also in ""The Fool"" or ""Leviathan"") in all their excruciating complexity, unlike the hero worship of guns and badges required in Western film culture.",1502323200,2,681,5.008849557522124
8750062,5,B01BGDI664,"A moving and inspirational film that demonstrates that the police services of Russia have not changed that much after all. And when one of their own actually does realize that he actually has a conscience, he is put on alert that he is next if he does not conform. This was a gritty and realistic film. It was fascinating to watch, but so disturbing that it will be a while before I want to watch it again.
But isn't that the definition of an excellent movie?",1495411200,,459,4.348837209302325
8750063,5,B01BGDI664,"Winter. A phone rings. A light turns on in a tall apartment block on the citys outskirts. Sergeis wife is in labor in Ryazan. He rushes off to the maternity hospital.

But he is not careful. He is reckless in fact. He speeds. There is a boy and his mother at a bus stop. Ice. A horrific accident.

Panic ensues. The accident is Sergeis fault. He has taken a life. He wants justice to be done. He wants to go to jail.

But there is a problem. Sergei is a police major, and admitting a mistake will give others an opportunity for score settling. As his superior officer (the esteemed actor Boris Nevzorov) says, Dont complicate things for yourself or others.

Nonetheless, Sergei insists on acting against his personal interest, while the other cops try to cover things up for him in the worst way possible. The calamity grows in size, which only seems to strengthen Sergeys backbone.

The Major is a tense, well-acted, well-written drama about a decent man trying to opt out of a corrupt system. The brooding Denis Shvedov is convincing and powerful in the lead role, and writer/director Bykov is despicable as his cowardly, corrupt colleague Pavel Korshunov  a role that earned him a Nika (Russias top film award) for Best Supporting Actor.

The films grim, starkly horizontal, rural backdrop adds an element of bleak hopelessness that serves to magnify Sergeys dilemma, well summarized by Tolya, a police colleague: Were all people, until we cross the line.
