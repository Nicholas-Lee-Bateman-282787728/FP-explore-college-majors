1348751,5,B00004T1JO,"I agree with the other comments just get the entire season.
This was one of my favorites as a kid and I hadn't seen in
long time! I got this for $5 so I figure 8 episodes is enough.
WRONG! I forgot why I loved this so much. Every show is a classic.
This is comedy! Great crazy characters. Every line a zinger!
I will give this to somebody and buy the entire collection.
You should do the same! If you like classic comedy without
having to make nasty and sex jokes to get laughs!",1325289600,5,478,4.042105263157895
1348752,5,B00004T1JO,"This DVD contains the first eight episodes of the first season of the series. I ordered it together with the three DVD packets of the first three seasons but it arrived much earlier than the other DVD's so I enjoyed very much watching them. But when you are a real fan,
order the real stuff.

First and last time I saw the series here in the Netherlands was around 1982 but it still is brilliant. I also ordered a Petticoat Junction DVD (a kind of prequel for Green Acres)
and I have never seen that here in the Netherlands but it's really nice, but not is
surreal as Green Acres (surreal is good ;-).

In the series Newsradio there are a lot of references to
Green Acres.

I had to take a gamble because these DVD's are in NTSC instead of
PAL and restricted to region 1. (Why for a product like this?).
Well I have at least one DVD-player that I got de-regionized
and that can turn NTSC into PAL. Haven't tried the others yet.",1309305600,3,927,4.255681818181818
1348753,2,B00004T1JO,"This is Carol Butler's son.  ""Green Acres"" has always been one of my favorite classic TV shows.  But, this tape made me kinda upset.  The shows were of inferior quality, and edited very badly.  Especially the second episode.  But, the worst thing of all was that the theme song was taken away, and replaced with an instrumental song, that sounds slightly similar to the original.  But, it just doesn't fit with the images seen in the opening, especially when you see Lisa sneezing.  We all know why she sneezes, but, you can't hear it on this tape.

The best thing about this tape is the commercials.  They're not the the original commercials from the show, but, they add a nice touch.

If you must have this, buy it.  But, like I said, the only good thing is the commercials.",1299542400,3,776,4.510791366906475
1348754,3,B00004T1JO,"This is Carol Butler's son.  My mom ordered this set for me because she knows how much I love old TV shows.  After watching every single episode, I can honestly say that I wasn't very impressed.  Sure, the episodes were funny and very enjoyable, but the detracting factors are that the episodes are ones from the public domain which have been terribly edited (literally cut with many splices throughout) and they all have very scratchy film prints.  Plus, the theme music has been altered at the opening and closing of every episode.  Instead, they use an instrumental theme that somewhat resembles the classic theme we know and love.  So, do I recommend this set?  Only if you're a die hard fan and aren't able to spend the money on the DVD sets that are awesome.  Otherwise, I wouldn't waste your money.  I believe it still comes on TV Land, so you'd be better off there.",1235692800,,873,4.580645161290323
1348755,3,B00004T1JO,If you have never seen green acres then I would recommend that you buy a copy to see if you like it but if you have already seen green acres then I would buy the complete season that has been released so far.  If you are a big comedy fan or just love comedy then you will for sure love this so I would buy the complete season of each one as well. I have all three seasons and wishing they would release the rest of them so I can complete my collection.,1189382400,13,452,3.860215053763441

1348757,2,B00004T1JO,"This DVD is just the first 8 episodes of the first season - not really ""Farm Favorites"".  I enjoyed them - but wish I had just paid a small amount more and bought the entire first season.  The pig, Arnold, wasn't even in these episodes!",1136419200,93,236,4.222222222222222
1348758,1,B00004T1JO,"If I could, I would rate this product NEGATIVE five stars. This has got to be the worst tape I've ever seen. The picture quality is as though it were recorded off brodcast TV (with poor reception!). The beloved Green Acres theme song has been replaced with some instrumental muzak nonsense. And to cap it off it has BEEN CUT FOR COMMERCIALS!!!! That's right, you do not get to see it in it's original form!! The sale of this tape should be a crime! This product makes Amazon look very, very  bad, and I hope they will pull it from their ""shelves"". PLEASE, PLEASE do not make the same mistake I did.... DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!!!!",988502400,38,627,4.358974358974359
1348759,3,B00004T1JO,"This is one of my all time favorite classic tv sitcoms. I collect lots of shows and this show brings back lots of fond memories. This video was good but buyer beware....you should only get it if you truly just have to have the commercials. They are truly a  treat. The show itself has been edited, this might be due to the commercials and the show was a rerun at that time and was cut for time, surely they didn't do that on it's original run. And the worst thing is the theme song has been edited out and a strange new beginning and ending are installed. It's almost scary seeing Oliver and Lisa doing their opening to a strange instrumental song, it almost sounds like it has been added by the company who put the tape out....WHY!!! Buy it for the commercials not for the show.",984614400,17,779,4.299319727891157
1348760,4,B00004T1JO,"So might say Mr. Kimball about one of my favorite TV shows of all time  (lest we forget the original Twilight Zone).
This is the only show that I  can enjoy even more at the age of 33 than I did at 8. The humor is  sophmoric and sophisticated at the same time. There's even subtle humor.  For instance, in one episode (not in this collection) Lisa (Eva) is sitting  in front of a mirror staring at a myriad of cosmetics. She states,  ""These aren't even mine. They're my sister's."" Is that a diss or  what?
These first two episodes are good but not yet up to pace yet. The  first episode depicts, documentary style, how Oliver acquired  ""rustic"" Green Acres. The second episode involves settling in and  Lisa's introduction to cooking, serving up a plate of cement pancakes and  thick black coffee.
This collection includes actual ads from 1965, which  is kind of cool. I like the Playskool Camper spot, and also the Sears  Dynaglass tire ad with the old Sears logo. Memories.
Buy this if you love  Green Acres. It's certainly a bargain. Only one weird thing. The theme song  is different. Huh.",968976000,25,1093,4.533333333333333

7922167,3,B00004T1JO,"My rating is for the VALUE, here, for the first 8 shows in a season where there are FOUR TIMES
that many... for that price, or lower. From time-to-time, the first two seasons are available at a 2-fer
price.
Since the third season is on four DVDs, instead of the, 2-each, flipper-discs of season 1 & 2, you'll
pay more for it.
I recommend you just, therefore, buy the first season, instead.",1432598400,,389,4.416666666666667
