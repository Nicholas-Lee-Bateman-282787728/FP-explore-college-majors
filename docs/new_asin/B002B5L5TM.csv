8360731,5,B002B5L5TM,"An excellent overview of the Indian identity and cultural history with some dazzling imagery and nice little stories within the episodes to illustrate certain themes. The episodes are an hour long and certainly not exhausting. Some of the themes do imply certain background knowledge including the caste system, some idea of Hindu mythology and religions, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. This is more for Indian audience but other audiences may enjoy just as much. Based on Mr Nehru's book and delivered in his persona it is very engaging.",1421798400,,541,5.159090909090909
8360732,4,B002B5L5TM,"This entire series is brilliant.
Perfect if you want your NRI kids something about India. But keep in mind that it is about 15-20 years old so sometimes it does fee slightly dated.

The packaging is terrible and very low quality. Makes this 165 bucks package look almost childish and amateur.",1395705600,,292,4.7254901960784315
8360733,5,B002B5L5TM,"The Shyam Benegal series based on the 'Discovery of India' is a classic. It provides quite a lot of information on the history of India as Pandit Nehru wrote it. Well-written, entertaining, and well-performed by all artists, it is a superb achievement by all involved.

While there are a few  full-throated songs, enthusiastically sung by super-talented singers, the best music is in the two Sakuntalam episodes. Based on Kalidasa's classic Abhjnanasakuntalam, shows 18 & 19 are full of drama and music beautifully blended. They are considered to have been inspired by Kirloskar's Marathi musical Shaakintal.

The Cupid Song and the 'Beautiful eyed' song are well worth listening to, again and again. In the whole series of 53 episodes, the two Sakuntalam shows truly stand out for music and drama.",1345420800,5,798,5.170542635658915
8360734,4,B002B5L5TM,This is a great dvd set. It took me back to the days when i was growing up bank in India. The print quality is very good.,1288483200,3,121,3.5185185185185186
8360735,5,B002B5L5TM,"Shyam Benegal, one of the best directors from India today, has given one of his best works in these 53 episodes of ~50min each. Each episode is a pleasure and takes yoo to the very core of Indian psyche with a snap-shot or with a piece of music...The background music carries an undeniable signature of Benegal and is chosen to reflect the locales of which the hisotry is shown on screen...This was genius since apart from giving the visual, factual, hisotric introduction to the core of India, it also gives a taste of the sounds from that region. This whole series is a gem to be preserved for ever...A part of the credit should also go to the original book: the Discovery of India by Jawaharlal Nehru.",1267488000,8,704,4.551181102362205
