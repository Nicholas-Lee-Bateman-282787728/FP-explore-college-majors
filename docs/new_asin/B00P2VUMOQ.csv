6787412,5,B00P2VUMOQ,"This is such a beautiful but overlooked film. I originally saw it at a private screening in Los Angeles prior to it's theatrical release and fell in love with it. Sadly, it was a commercial failure. Then I discovered that there was a large chunk of the movie removed from the US release. My search for an unedited copy took years. I happened to be in Italy and walked into a video store where I saw the original, unedited Italian version on DVD. It wasn't for sale, but a few months later my girlfriend surprised me with that same full-length Italian version she obtained from an Italian website (luckily I had a region-free player). A couple of years ago the shortened version was released in the US on Blu-ray but I decided to wait and see if it would be released uncut. I was thrilled to find this full-length version on Amazon at a very low price. It is from Korea but is region-free. And it is beautiful! I recommend this film and especially this version to anyone who wants to be enchanted by a wonderful film.",1439424000,16,1016,4.438502673796791

6787414,4,B00P2VUMOQ,"I had never heard of this movie and I took a chance on it just to fill in some time. And then I was delighted.  Its a period drama set in the early 1900s, and the story is like a fictional biography of a musical genius who live his whole life on a luxury steamship.  How he developed his musical talents is not really explained but the music will appeal to anyone who likes early jazz (and especially ragtime, both Gershwin and Joplin style)). The lead actor, Tim Roth, seems perfect for his role (with some real skill on the piano) and the settings many other production values are very strong.  Except for a few quirky characters that - for reasons unknown - Italian-made movies simply must include, most of the story is almost realistic enough to be believable.  The movie is nearly 3 hours long so be prepared to spend an afternoon or a full evening being captivated by both visual and musical effects this movie will offer.  You'll really enjoy it.",1524873600,,953,4.485549132947977
6787415,5,B00P2VUMOQ,"Love this movie.  Excellent acting.  Funny, relaxing, wonderful story.  I will see this again.  I hope anyone who loves a good story sees this movie, you will enjoy it, and like me even love it.  Love 1900 and his music.",1524700800,,220,4.4

6787419,5,B00P2VUMOQ,"Glad to see the 4-5 stars for this film. It's a gem of an fairly unknown film that I've seen maybe 3 times in the past decade or two (Made in 1998). Unique and magical and sober and delightful all in one; a great story which I'm looking forward to seeing again now that it's on Prime / Streaming. Unfortunately, as the other reviews say, there was an edited version, which is the one I'd seen before; which I prefer. I feel that what was cut out in that edit made for a much better movie overall. Having seen it before 3 times, as I said, the 'added/uncut segments' were apparen. They seemed unnecessary and occasionally unpleasant. Still, enjoyed seeing this again.",1522627200,,666,4.467213114754099

6787421,5,B00P2VUMOQ,This has always been one of my favorite movies since high school and I just am so happy I was able to find a copy. Quality is great considering it was filmed with a lower quality cams then we're used to in 2018. Very happy.,1520294400,,223,3.977777777777778
6787422,5,B00P2VUMOQ,"A colorful gem.
Ok Amazon, that wasn't enough for you so heres my second try.

This is a colorful gem of a movie.  As in the language sometimes is colorful.  The movie is a gem.

This movie is about a guy that spends his entire life on one single solitary ship.  Even more so this movie is about that guys music.

Also, in this movie the guy is challenged to a duel:  This was a penultimate piano duel.  One musician plays something memorable; something representing Xmas come early; the other acknowledges it as a heavenly peace.  The victor is finally compelled to play something smoking hot.  Yet this isn't the best music played.

For that you need to keep watching for the girl.  As in the young, beautiful woman; the northern-Italian belladonna.  Keep listening for the music she inspires.  This is where some random senator says oh 19!  That was one amazing piece of music! and Its gotta have the right title though.  Something catchy like swingin in the breeze?  [or] sweet 19?  What is it called?

Beautiful Swansong c 1900.",1519689600,,1033,4.607734806629834

6787427,3,B00P2VUMOQ,"As others have written, this is the longer version (director's cut? European cut?).  I have to say while I loved the shorter version, this one dragged on.  None of the stuff that was cut out of it in the shorter version really was worth watching.  I bought this the way a fan of a Hobbit movie might want to get the extended version with director's commentary... I was a fan of the shorter version of the movie and wanted to see what I had been missing.  Now I see I really wasn't missing anything, and the shorter version is just a much better/tighter movie.  I should have saved my money.",1502064000,8,590,4.327272727272727

6787429,2,B00P2VUMOQ,"So, this is one of my favorite films of all time.  Having not been able to find it on any of the digital movie purveyors (Apple, Amazon, Whatever Ultraviolet is now...) I decided to upgrade my decades old DVD to a nice fresh Blu-Ray copy.  Underwhelmed and disappointed.  This is (and keep in mind it says this nowhere) some type of ultra extended Directors Cut, with roughly 45+ minutes of extra footage.  Normally I'm all about extended versions, (providing the theatrical version is still on there...which it isn't), but this is laborous, and ultimately a different movie.  The original had such a spark, such a fluid almost ""action"" pace to the music and dialogue.  I can see why these long silent and dull (and sometimes confusingly out of character) scenes were cut from the original film.  I want my 1900 back!!",1493769600,2,818,4.75886524822695
6787430,5,B00P2VUMOQ,"One of the most under-rated movies EVER. Cinematography is top-notch, acting is superb, and the story is original and captivating. Looks fantastic on blu-ray! More f-bombs than I expected but it's a long movie so no biggie LOL.

Oh, did I mention the music is BEAUTIFUL?!",1493251200,,271,4.891304347826087
6787431,5,B00P2VUMOQ,Fantastic movie by a director of 'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso' Giuseppe Tornatore. It is a rare case when short version of a good movie is somewhat better then a full one.,1490832000,,165,4.533333333333333

6787440,2,B00P2VUMOQ,"This is completely a different movie - the US release had mystery and darkness.  The full length blu-ray alters that beauty, hitting you over the head with its themes.  Over acted.  Over directed. It's a shame the bluray version doesn't contain both versions and let the viewer decide.",1466035200,2,285,4.895833333333333

8686296,3,B00P2VUMOQ,"on the fence about this one, there are moments of true beauty and moments of scripted tedium.  sometimes Tim Roth look was so odd that I laughed, when I know he was trying for something serious.  And what was with the sexual molestation bit?  perv creeps on sleeping teen and kisses her without consent?  bizarre.  won't watch it again",1529280000,,335,4.610169491525424

8686298,5,B00P2VUMOQ,"I take a very interpretive approach. Man at the turn of the century. A child raised in the industrial age, a musical prodigy with a gift and promise for the future....but never quite makes it ashore. Love nearly brings him to the rest of humanity, but could not bring himself to dissolve into it, to lose himself in it, to lose his gifted individuality. Perhaps it is about individuals who value themselves more than the rest. Perhaps it is about man in the post-modern age living their wholes lives on a ship never really connecting with the rest of the world.

The Legend of 1900 is not about single individual. It's about a ship a vessel where a man lived and  his story. The story of a man who made wonderful music, almost forgotten except for a Story. Of course it is the story of all of us.",1527811200,,796,4.371621621621622
8686299,2,B00P2VUMOQ,"It's a Quality Production, but there were a couple of key casting weaknesses, and the Plot was pretty much Laughable.
They try to make it seem like this wistful romantic tale, but it just comes off as lame.

It had potential, but the main guy they cast, to tell the story, was absolutely the wrong man for the job.
Hearing this guy reminisce was unimpressive.

That was enough to deal a killing blow to this film, but what really sunk this ship was the ending.
I won't spoil it for anyone, here, but it was the worst possible way to end the movie, and it made absolutely Zero Sense.

They try to play it off as this romantic, too-cool-for-school sort of farewell, but it was just outrageous.
Preposterous, I tell you, Preposterous! xD

I will also touch on the music, because I think, for a movie that is completely focused around the Music of the Early 20th Century, I found it disappointing.
Don't get me wrong, because Ennio Morricone is one of the greatest film composers of the last century.

If I recall, he did ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"", ""A Fistful of Dollars"", and ""The Mission"", among other things.
All very noteworthy, to my recollection, and the theme from ""The Mission"" was especially moving.

This, however, simply did not Shine.
A lot of busy music, and nothing that really got my attention, but the weird thing was that they always talked about it, in the movie, as though it were spectacular, when it was really very plain.

Not to say that this isn't a movie worth watching, but rather that it was a movie with a lot of quality elements, and a few poor choices that brought it down in big ways.
This had A LOT of potential, but it didn't come through.",1527638400,,1676,4.457516339869281

8686303,1,B00P2VUMOQ,"So, interesting mystery to begin with but the ending was unsatisfying. I will not post any spoilers, but bottom line:I thought 1900's reasons were ludicrous. If you watch it, you may agree with me!",1526774400,,197,4.823529411764706
