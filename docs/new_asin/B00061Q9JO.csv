2156822,5,B00061Q9JO,"I loved this DVD. The instructions are presented in a personal training manner, just what I was looking for. Rael stands next to the participants and leads them through a challenging yet very detailed workout. There are a lot of modifications presented throughout. I especially liked the cues and the visuals presented...he is a true professional and his passion for Pilates is obvious. This goes for all his system DVD's (7, 17, 27).",1111449600,11,434,4.958904109589041
2156823,5,B00061Q9JO,"I've been doing yoga for over 2 years, along with latin dancing, the hula & bellydancing for almsot 2 years. I don't know much about pilates, but I enjoyed this dvd. I felt refreshed after, my abs were burning, and my spine felt more straight immediatly.

This disc comes with a 5 min interview with Rael, comes in 5.1 sound, the music is not annoying & the director & producers have won golden globes, emmys, etc. for other tv shows.
Rael Isacowitz has been doing Pilates for 25 years, is one of the few who can perform the entire repertoire & teaches other pilates teachers. He's one of the only people who can do the entire workout & has a masters in dance which shows in how he moves & speaks. He is very greaceful when he moves, has a lot of charisma when he speaks & doens't miss anything when showing how to do the movements. He sees the body as a dancer & is amazing in knowing how the body responds to small differences in movements such as which way the palm should face.
The set is simple in orange with 3 women demonstrating the movements on a pilates table while Rael tells you how to move, what to watch out for all while keeping perfect pace of always tellling you when to inhale & exhale in charming manner that's never annoying. He also demonstrates the more advanced way of doing each movement w/perfect precison & grace. The pace is relaxed to emphasis body awareness. The moves seem to be yoga-based with a hint of aerobics. The # on the DVD is how many moves it contains.

If you want a trailer, there's one on collagevideo com You can also get info at raelpilates com",1110153600,29,1589,4.346801346801347
2156824,2,B00061Q9JO,"I bought this DVD based on all the excellent reviews but was disappointed. You spend too long on each move (2 minutes of single-leg stretch-seems ok, but feels like an eternity) and it gets boring, but despite the almost constant exertion, I did not break a sweat or raise my heart rate very high. Also the exercisers were completely emotionless throughout the entire workout. It was like watching a bunch of robots. The good thing about this DVD is its attention to form. Rael clearly knows what he's talking about, so I would recommend this workout for people who are interested in the science of pilates, but for a regular exerciser, it's not worth it.",1291507200,,655,4.7043478260869565
2156825,5,B00061Q9JO,"I was looking for a replacement for going to the gym.  This does more than I thought it would.  It does a great job of using your own body to create the resistance you need for a tough workout.  When I topped out on results, I added ankle weights and am getting an even harder workout now.  Great product!",1245110400,3,305,4.11864406779661
2156826,5,B00061Q9JO,"Rael builds on system 7, in a logical way here.  System 17, has a couple of different moves.  Definitely get the videos if you read his book Pilates.  I like Rael's style of teaching, he gives very good verbal instruction so you can work alongside while the video plays.",1244505600,,270,4.469387755102041
2156827,5,B00061Q9JO,"I already had the system 27 and love it and I bought this to see if it were different, but its the same as system 27 but less challenging. Its still a good buy.",1228089600,5,160,3.735294117647059
2156828,5,B00061Q9JO,"I bought system 17 instead of 7 because I had gone for 2 full courses on Pilates beginners. System 17 proved to be challenging but yet doable for a beginner going on to intermediate Pilates. What I like about this DVD is Rael's clear instructions, most of the time, I don't even need to follow what's on screen...by listening to his voice, I can do the movements alongside. Though it can be quite challenging at times, but once you persevere right to the very end of his session, you will feel so much relaxed and rejuvenated. You can just feel that your body is screaming away saying that it's happy and fulfilled!",1218844800,,615,4.5
2156829,5,B00061Q9JO,This Pilates dvd is the closest I've come to my awesome pilates instructor at the gym (beginer).,1213315200,2,96,4.705882352941177
2156830,5,B00061Q9JO,"I have been doing this DVD off and on for about a year now.  Even if you do not complete the pilates demonstrated, you can breathe when instructed and still learn a lot.  The accompanying music helps guide the flow of pilates.

As a growing investor in home DVD workouts and mind-body buff, it is a comprehensive 35 minute set of stretches.  For me, it permits my body to gently inform my mind of what is aching.  Consider my bias though, I am a mat pilates die-hard fan.

At this point, I have done this DVD work out with someone watching me from the couch, a 2 year old under my legs, and a cat dangling off the side of the pilates mat.  It is a good ""one size fits all"" and thus one of my favorite ways to start the day.  All you need is some loose clothing, a flat surface to do the exercises, and something to play the whole thing.",1151884800,11,836,4.085889570552148
2156831,5,B00061Q9JO,"Intermediate Pilates students will appreciate RAEL PILATES SYSTEM 17, which covers 17 poses for strength and flexibility. Ten additional poses are added to the basics: leg circles, cat stretch and more. Any with the basics down will easily move beyond with SYSTEM 17 on the box!",1145404800,,278,5.065217391304348
2156832,5,B00061Q9JO,"Rael is the best!!!!!  His voice is so soothing, confident and commanding.  This just takes 40 minutes, so if you want to get centered in the morning or a quick workout between getting home and dinner - this is for you!  If you do this every day or at least five days a week you'll notice a difference",1142467200,4,301,4.155172413793103
2156833,2,B00061Q9JO,I was so excited when I read the reviews for this intermediate level Pilates tape. Thought I would purchase it for variety from my 'The Method' Pilates tape. I was very disappointed. The tape does not even allow you to get your heart racing much less to break a sweat. I didn't feel like I got a good tone workout. I actually wanted to fall asleep. I felt it was 40 minutes of stretch for an intermediate level student. I give two stars because I do believe he knows what is talking about in terms of form but I shall be passing this on to an elderly relative.,1138924800,4,560,4.194444444444445
8036426,3,B00061Q9JO,Mr Isacowitz is a master teacher. This DVD provides a 30 min workout with cues and demonstration. The interview at the end is unfortunately the same as on the Beginner DVD so is nothing new. This DVD gives great insight into his approach if you can't get to a workshop.,1487894400,,269,4.4
8036427,5,B00061Q9JO,GREAT WORKOUT!,1458345600,,14,6.5

8036429,5,B00061Q9JO,"Excellent instruction. After reading many instructional books on the subject, Isacowitz puts it all together with his personal input on how the exercises are to be performed. All my questions have been answered on Pilates. With this tape you don't have to leave the house and go to a gym or studio to work out.",1427241600,,310,4.654545454545454
8036430,2,B00061Q9JO,"Waste of money really.  Wish I could say something nice about it, but I cannot.  Boring, slow and not much to it.  Hope I get $1.00 at a garage sale someday.  For now it just collects dust on the shelf.",1419811200,,202,3.975
