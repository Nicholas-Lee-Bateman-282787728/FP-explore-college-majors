8137820,3,B00003ETPJ,"If you're looking for action packed video of F5 tornadoes rippin homes to bits you'll be deeply disappointed. Instead this so called Tornado Video Classics sequal is nothing but now to build a tornado model. There's maybe 5 minutes of real life tornadoes that they compare to the model. There's about 20 minutes of other tornadoes that the footage is shakey and have stupid responses from the audience. The back says something about the best of the Jarrel, Tx footage, maybe about 30 seconds of the beginning then to helicopter shots of flattened homes. And on the website it says footage of the 1996 Oakfield, WI F5, NONE!!!!! The only reason this got 3 stars instead of one is the final 13 minutes is of unnarrated chase video. I recommend TVC I or III and TLC's ""Tornado Chasers"".",1128470400,,783,4.681159420289855
