It is on the picture of the cover, but you have to click and enlarge the picture to see it. And as it is a DVD collection I didn't feel the need to inspect the photo.
And it was super awesome since I couldn't return this item because it arrived with the cello wrap torn and you can't return items that are opened.",1434672000,17,426,4.144578313253012

5152868,1,B008CZDVUQ,"We purchased this item as a Christmas gift and when we received it we were surprised to see that the box and titles were all in Korean! As the product description does not mention that these films were foreign language editions, we were quite disappointed. Looking at past reviews, we can see that this has been a problem for other Amazon users as well. Perhaps an indication in the description can say that this is not an English collection?",1388966400,13,442,4.6075949367088604

8526899,5,B008CZDVUQ,"This is a great set and reasonable. I was originally looking for Roman Holiday, since this is one of few Hepburn films not on Blu Ray, and this set popped up. This is Region A (which plays in US DVD players - also Korea and other countries), which was great. It also shipped via Amazon.com, and not a third party, while this doesn't make a big difference, I knew I could return it if it was really shady, especially from the negative reviews. The price of the DVD for Roman Holiday was $10, while this set was $10 for six movies. That's a really good deal and decent quality.

Once I turned off the subtitles (go the set up menu, click ""none"" for subtitles) the picture was really good. My remote also turned off the subtitles without going through the main menu as well. The main menu display for each of the movies look bootleg, but I'm guessing that's just how the set was released in Korea. no complaints, since it is the movies I wanted. The sound and video were good quality for a DVD set.

The picture can be misleading. It makes it look like the set comes in a box-like case, but it's actually one big plastic DVD case and the DVDs are in soft sleeves on the inside (versus disc tray). Which I thought was interesting, and I can see why others thought this was a bootleg release. The entire box art is in Korean, but I expected that since this is a Korean release.

Either way, $10 for six movies, which all look like official Korean releases, is a darn good deal. If you're looking for Audrey Hepburn movies for a decent deal, take a look at this if you don't mind the Korean language or taking an extra step to turn off the subtitles.",1471392000,6,1644,4.296774193548387
