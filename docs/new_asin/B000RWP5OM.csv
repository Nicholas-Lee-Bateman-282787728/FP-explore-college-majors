There were a total of 5 boardwalks over the years. Presidents came here. Miss America was crowned here. The beautiful theatres. The Architecture alone is a knockout! The original land was purchased for 4 cents per acre. It sat for over 100 years before it started developing. Two railroads brought the visitors to the beach. Oh yes, the sandcastle builders have been sculpting for more than 100 years. The Deocratic Convention was held here. Marilyn Monroe, Barbara Stanwyck and more are shown. The fantastic black community. The guest houses. The big bands. This is a treasure!",1296086400,2,721,4.918032786885246
