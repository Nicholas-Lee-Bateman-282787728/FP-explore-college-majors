Fine casts, good storylines, rousing music, good production values overall. Richard Greene's bravado and dimpled charm are hard to surpass. Only Errol Flynn out-beloved rogues him. The sheriff isn't much with us in these episodes, and I am rather partial to Bernadette O'Farrell's Maid Marian, but still, this is sheer delight. Wonderful adventure, delicious mind candy.

3910521,5,B002DH20QA,This series was about the right length.  The content was very good without the filth that you see in modern serials. Exciting!,1254441600,3,126,4.7272727272727275
3910522,5,B002DH20QA,"This wonderful series from the mid-1950's has a heart, a mind and a social conscience.  The acting is top notch and the production values very good.",1254441600,6,148,4.6923076923076925
3910523,5,B002DH20QA,"I've purchased every season of this classic series and have not been disappointed by any of them. Each episode is a self-contained adventure featuring the well-known characters from the Robin Hood story legend. The stories hold up surprisingly well for their age, though the action is very ""PG"". The violence is not graphic, and, of course, it's not as realistic as modern drama. The main selling point of this show over other 50's shows is that it's not cheesy.

If you like something gentle and light to entertain you on a weekend afternoon, these stories are perfect. They're also good for families with children.

Note that the series is quite old and the quality is not pristine (though certainly not bad at all). If you're looking for something which will blow you away with quality and effects, this is not your show.",1253404800,4,824,4.795774647887324
3910524,3,B002DH20QA,"I pre-ordered this item about 3 months ago and very excitedly received it just a week ago, only to find that the first disc, supposedly containing 13 episodes, only contains 10. It is missing ""The Loaf"", ""Tuck's Love Day"", and ""Six Strings to His Bow"". Not only that, but the rest of the remaining episodes are out of order as written on the disc and the guide on the back, making it a bit confusing (they don't jive chronologically). I loved the first three seasons that Mill Creek put out, they did a wonderful job, but I wish I hadn't pre-ordered this one because of the quality of the others... apparently, since I have had it ""ordered"" for more than the 30 days return policy, I can't return it. I will work on this through Amazon, they are usually accommodating, but if you are considering ordering this Fourth Season, you might want to wait until they have worked the bugs out of their new release.",1252108800,21,905,4.490909090909091

8365226,3,B002DH20QA,"I watched ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" when I was a kid and loved it. So when it came out on DVD, I snapped it up, one season at a time.  I began watching the whole series in order a couple of months ago and started the last season this month, Feb. 2013.  I loved the cast and thought Alan Wheatley was the most nasty and marvelous Sheriff of Nottingham ever.  So it came as a shock when at the end of the eighth of the 26 episodes, the sheriff rides off for London, leaving a deputy appointed by Prince John in his place.

Surely this was temporary, I thought.  No, the deputy appears in that 8th episode with Wheatley as the two villains plot and counterplot to capture Robin Hood once and for all, while trying to discredit their rival for power. The real sheriff never returns.  The advent of this new character turns the series ugly and unpleasant, as if they ran out of ideas.  I watched the next episode, ""Farewell to Little John,"" in which the deputy tries divide and conquer.  Too depressing by half.  I may never watch those final 17 episodes.",1361836800,,1055,4.341836734693878
8365227,5,B002DH20QA,"The Robin Hood series is just great fun to watch.  The episodes are healthy entertainment, humorous and they always have a fun moral to the story. They do a wonderful job of casting the same characters in many new and diverse roles. We never tire of viewing the stories over and over after a couple months go by.",1322524800,,312,4.379310344827586

I have purchased 3 of the 4 seasons from Amazon and have found them all to be entertaining and fun. My boys even love them.",1267488000,,285,4.296296296296297
8365229,5,B002DH20QA,"Thanks to the warning from Ms. Grant, I checked with Mill Creek before ordering the fourth season from Amazon.  The project manager assured me that the problems had been addressed, and I am happy to say he was quite right.  The episodes Ms. Grant noted as missing have been restored, so buyers can order with confidence that they will be receiving a set of just as high a quality as its predecessors.",1265587200,8,400,4.541666666666667
8365230,5,B002DH20QA,great for the whole family and good to complete the set but the complete four year collection can be found cheaper than piecing the four year collection together.,1264982400,,162,4.821428571428571
8365231,5,B002DH20QA,"I forgot how good this show was.
Well written little stories.
Better now that I understand English history better.
Other than Robin and the sheriff, the history is
close to being correct except I don't believe there
ever was an English mark coin.",1255824000,3,246,4.744186046511628
