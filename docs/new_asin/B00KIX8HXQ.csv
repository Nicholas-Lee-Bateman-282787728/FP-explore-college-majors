8659399,5,B00KIX8HXQ,"Divided into two lengthy segments, Disc One has two parts in HD, each dedicated entirely to the Normandy invasion and its aftermath. It is a very thorough visual exposition depicting the pre-June 6th preparations, the Omaha Beach landing, and the fight to avoid an almost disastrous first day in the fight to secure the beach-head.  There are extensive visual clips of the carnage on Omaha Beach, excellent graphics, and film clips detailing the struggle to advance and push through the treacherous bocages in the protracted effort to occupy Saint Lo and secure the complex of crossroads leading into the interior of France.

Disc Two includes the History Channel's excellent 360 visual breakdown of the naval battle of Santa Cruz, providing the ferocious backdrop of naval and air battles in support of the 10,000 or so marines on Guadalcanal, in August-November of '42, who fought to safeguard Henderson Field against continuous Japanese ground attacks while dug in to protect themselves from heavy Japanese naval shelling. But, it primarily showcases the travails and ultimate victory of the U.S.S. Enterprise against Japanese naval forces in the Battle of the Solomons.

This two disc set is well worth the cost of admission!!",1437264000,,1230,5.202020202020202

8659401,2,B00KIX8HXQ,"Two segments called D-Day in 3-D on disc 1 are just okay; the second covers weapons of WWII and covers nothing new yet the title say ""75 Years of WWII"" which doesn't make sense. I love the shows produced by the History Channel, but this was a flop.",1409961600,,248,4.1875

8659403,4,B00KIX8HXQ,"While I liked this 2 set DVD, the title is a bit misleading. It should have been titled ""D-Day in HD"" and ""The Enterprise, Battle 360"". Both of these DVD's were entertaining, and I enjoyed them, but if you're expecting more than the above I listed you're going to be disappointed.",1409616000,4,280,4.509803921568627
8659404,5,B00KIX8HXQ,"This is a 2 disc set that documents WW2. The first disc is History Channels new mini series ""D-Day In HD"" the other disc is a collection of other HC WW2 documentaries. Good price too!",1409529600,2,183,4.257142857142857
