8401550,5,B003OCJLD8,"I watched this series on the French channel TV5 Monde, and was impressed with the range of viewpoints, documentary footage, and commentary, so much so that I searched for, and happily found, the series on Amazon, and now I can pass this on to the grandkids, who are just beginning to learn about the war in school.",1397692800,,314,4.526315789473684
8401551,5,B003OCJLD8,"This 4 DVD set is a must view for those interested in WWII, for the younger generation who are unaware of this history, and for those of us who need a refresher. The music is amazing, the documentation includes rare footage from the time, and the narration is interesting and informative. They don't go into a lot of detail, (for that I would recommend ""Bloodlands: Europe Between Hiter and Stalin"" by Timothy Snyder).
Excellent for young people and for high school teachers who want to show their classes a funky graphics, entertaining brief overview of the propaganda used to coerce and control people during the 1939-45.",1346976000,,623,4.886792452830188
