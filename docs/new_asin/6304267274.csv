Even my toughest classes loved this movie.  It has an engaging plot and lots of great music.  There are also good scenes of people playing instruments from the time period, which the students enjoyed.  Highly recommended for ages 7 and up.",982195200,12,374,4.707692307692308

7867041,4,6304267274,"Handel's Last Chance is an enjoyable DVD for elementary students.  I recommend the product.  It's a good supplement for teaching about Handel, but I would like to see less fiction.",1225756800,2,180,4.966666666666667
7867042,5,6304267274,This is to let you know that this dvd and I guess I will enjoy watching it after all ( Now mind he never was married but he did run around a bit )I might like seeing what my great-great-great-great great-great-grandfather did have a illeage son and he moved to America and change his name from Handel to Hendel.

7867043,5,6304267274,"This is a FANTASTIC film that should be in the libraries of every elementary and intermediate grades music teacher.  I have used it as a way to introduce Handel's music and talk about the Baroque era.  I teach inner-city kids, who loved the film and were VERY open to learning more about Handel and his music after seeing it!
The story is entertaining and funny--fictional, of course, while providing some of the very basics of Handel's life and work.  Of course, you hear his music almost all the way throughout!
Don't let the college professor nay-sayers sway you from this one.  If you're in the trenches with a music classroom full of kids everyday, like I am, this one's worth its weight in gold.",1054166400,17,701,4.629032258064516
