2820017,5,B000PGTNFM,"a review of the Russian revolution, which was a long process and really several revolutions. well-done, riveting. one of those documentaries that you don't have to be a history buff to enjoy.",1332028800,,191,5.0
2820018,5,B000PGTNFM,This is excellent.  I have asked by students to read Ayn Rand's We The Living and wanted to give them some background.  The students enjoyed and I am pleased with the results.,1329523200,,175,4.4375
2820019,5,B000PGTNFM,"This is an excellent documentary of the Bolshevik Revolution, with emphasis on the Kronstadt garrison and sailors, a key component of the revolution. I was initially put off by the idea of it being in color, thinking of the crap from Ted Turner, but you immediately forget the coloring as the details come out. The historical facts are presented, including little details usually overlooked.

Whereas previous depictions of the revolution focus on the Bolshevik leadership and ignore Kronstadt altogether, this particular documentary omits some of the parallel (to Kronstadt) events going on with the leadership, such that Stalin, Kamenev, Zinoviev and others are ignored---but this is not to the detriment of the documentary. I just feel that those events with the leadership should have been mentioned, even if cursory. However, this is nitpicking. It's a great documentary and I, for one, am going to purchase it for my collection.",1323648000,2,934,5.268456375838926
2820020,4,B000PGTNFM,"When it comes to documentaries, I am primarily concerned with their applicability to a classroom (high school).  In terms of time, this one is very nice, as it breaks cleanly into 2 parts, each of about 45 minutes; perfect for two class periods.  I wouldn't want to spend any more time on it than that.  The narrative is clear and understandable, and the producers are not so impressed with themselves that they belabor the point or ruin the film with gimmicks.  The production quality is good.  The colorization of the old film footage is actually quite appealing, especially to our generation of students who are immediately turned off by black-and-white footage.  This footage is also interspersed with modern reenactments, which have been doctored to appear as though they are part of the old footage.  It's fairly convincing and looks very clean.  Overall an appealing account of this historical event.",1265932800,41,907,5.040268456375839
2820021,3,B000PGTNFM,"I purchased this Item to aid me in a Russian history class I am taking.  It has a somewhat limited perspective of the Russian Revolution, but it was helpful.",1257552000,2,157,4.413793103448276
2820022,5,B000PGTNFM,"This documentary contains a mix of extraordinary historical footage and well done dramatic reenactments of the Russian Revolution and the ensuing Civil War between the Reds and Whites. But with a narrative structure that is centered on the naval officers of Kronstadt, who played a vital role in the overthrow of the Romanov monarchy. But who also tried, unsucessfully, to prevent the revolution's democratic principles from disintegrating into Bolshevik tyranny.

Reviewer Alfred Johnson, apparently a die hard Communist, claims this doc is told from an anarchist perspective. But this is clearly not the case. Rather the failures and brutality of Lenin and the Bolsheviks are discussed by various mainstream historians, both Russian and Western.

Recommended for those who want to learn more about one of the most important events of the 20th century.",1217980800,5,853,5.406015037593985
2820023,4,B000PGTNFM,"This is an engaging documentary that tells an under reported story about an important event. Most Americans do not know that there werre two revolutions in Russia in 1917--even if they were aware there was one revolution that year. The original footage, colorized for modern consumption, brings the events to life. However, if using it in the classroom, care must be taken to teach the students to spot the differences between the actual footage and the reenactments, because they are so skilfully edited together that an uneducated eye will have difficulty discriminating between them.",1213401600,38,586,5.24468085106383
2820024,4,B000PGTNFM,"The sailors of the Baltic Fleet stationed at Kronstadt on the entranceway to Petrograd played a vanguard and heroic role in the various stages leading up to, and including, the October revolution in Russia in 1917. The sailors of the Baltic Fleet played a vanguard and heroic role in defending that revolution on the many fronts of the three-year Civil War against the Whites. According to the premise of this docudrama, tinged as it is in anarchist and anti-communist colors, the Kronstadt sailors also played a vanguard role in defending the premises of that revolution in their uprising against the seemingly power-crazed Bolsheviks in 1921.

That is where Bolshevik sympathizers, including this writer, part company with the creators of this work on the virtues, especially the political virtues, of the sailors. And it is, whether viewed tragically or not, also the point of departure for those who saw the necessity of defending the Bolshevik experiment, arms in hand, as it lay prostrate after years of civil war and those who later, mainly from their cozy armchairs, made this the definitive point of the degeneration of the revolution of 1917. Moreover, apparently until the end of times someone, somewhere, in some cozy armchair, is going to pose the question of the Kronstadt uprising of 1921 as the defining moment in the process of degeneration of the Russian revolution. I, like the exiled Bolshevik Left-Oppositionist Leon Trotsky, ask the simple question- why? For what purpose? (See archives article entitled Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt, written by Trotsky in 1938).

This two-part docudrama (The Fight For Freedom and Civil War) adequately highlights the social facts that made the Baltic sailors play an important role in the various stages of the revolution during 1917. Their skill levels, their camaraderie and their ties to the peasantry and working class back home made them a lynchpin for all kinds of actions planned by the Bolsheviks once the sailors were won to the need for decisive actions. In fact, as the docudrama points out, at a couple of points-the April and July Days they were ahead of the curve of the revolution. Moreover, the sailors played a decisive role in the actual physical overthrow of the Provisional Government in October and later the dispersal of the Constituent Assembly. Throughout the period, however, one should recognize that they did not act as an independent revolutionary factor but acted, for the most part, as agents of a civilian revolutionary party- Lenin's Bolsheviks.

Needless to say when the storm clouds of civil war raised its head with the uprising of the Czech Legion and the intervention of the united imperialist powers the Kronstadt sailors were at their posts, especially at the critical moments in front of Kazan. They laid down their heads on all the fronts. I should note here that the pen name that I use in this space, Markin, is to honor one of those heroic sailors who laid down his head on one of the many fronts being contested by the Red and White Armies. It is also rather germane to note here that the bulk of the cadre sailors from 1917 either shared Markin's fate, took administrative jobs with the Bolshevik government of otherwise provided service to the revolution. The upshot, of all this, is to point out, as Trotsky did, that those sailors who rose against the Bolsheviks in 1921 were not the same cadre that performed heroic service earlier.

That view has been contested, and is contested here by some of the inevitable `talking heads' that are interspersed between various action segments. And that is the rub. As pointed out up above the creators of this film have their own axes to grind. So we get the inevitable diabolical Lenin and the Bolsheviks as the personification of evil, all hungry bureaucrats ready to pounce on any political opposition. In short, the traditional anarchist/anti-communist litany that we have heard for the past 90 years.  Here, beyond the specific chronology of the Kronstadt uprising itself (and the point Trotsky was trying to make in his 1938 article mentioned above) is the key question of when the revolution degenerated  (the whys and what to do about it we will leave for another time).

I would argue that if 1921 is the point of qualitative degeneration (and therefore the point that a third revolution is necessary) then the whole Bolshevik experiment was wrong from the beginning. That means, and here we have the benefit of hindsight such as it is, that the working class is organically incapable of making a working class revolution to implement socialism. I do not subscribe to that opinion but that should send those who are stuck intellectually imprisoned in Kronstadt 1921 cause for pause.",1208217600,14,4735,4.9785082174462705
2820025,5,B000PGTNFM,"The ""in color"" part of the title refers to colorized original newsreal footage used in the documentary.  In addition, the DVD features interview with experts on the period (both English and Russian)and historical re-enactments played out under the narration. All of these elemenents, along with the natural drama of the story, make this a very compelling documentary.
The documentary tells the story of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and ensuing Civil War by focusing on the story of the sailors of the Kronstadt naval base near St. Petersburg (at the time, Petrograd).  This works extremely well as a framing device since these sailors played key roles at several points in the historical events.  The documentary does not follow the sailors exclusively, but moves on to other people and places for extended periods when these become central to the story.  Still, by always returning to the sailor's the documentary retains an immediacy and a coherency it might not otherwise have.
All in all an excellent introduction to and overview of this important historical event.",1196035200,63,1071,5.173410404624278

2820091,2,B000PGTNFM,"This ""documentary"" was very disappointing. Although it is admittedly impossible to provide a thorough account of the Russian Revolution and Civil War in 1.5 hours, this film compounds the problem because of some fairly egregious inaccuracies when very briefly mentioning the role of the Czechoslovak Legion, the actions and mindsets of the White Generals, and the intervention of the Allies in the Civil War, as well as the policies of the Bolshevik government during the Civil War (for example, the purpose of confiscating the peasants' seed grain was a tactic to quell resistance and control the population, not to feed the urban population). It is disappointing that even now, there is little effort to provide an accurate account of the Civil War. The generals and other leaders of the White Guard were focused on overthrowing the Bolshevik regime, which had proven itself to be brutal and repressive from the outset. They were not uniformly monarchists and, in fact, the case could be made that they lost the war because there were so many different factions included in the White movement while the intervention of the Allies was, by and large, detrimental to the White movement.
The archival footage is interesting (although I prefer archival footage to remain black and white) and the focus on the Kronstadt sailors is of interest but I would not recommend this film.",1408233600,29,1375,5.061674008810573

2820093,4,B000PGTNFM,"As an educator of Freshman-age high school students, I found the film to be just what I needed as an additional piece on the Russian Revolution and civil war.  So often the students get confused with all of the events which happened over an 8 year span but so drastically changed Russia and, commensurately, our world.  The history of all that happened, from ""abdication"" by the Czar to understanding the motivation for Allied direct involvement in Russia's Civil War (and the long term consequences), makes the concepts at play fairly complex and I feel the film makers did as complete a job as can be reasonably done in two, 45 minute segments while not injecting an overload of the minutiae (for a ninth grade audience) that one typically sees in the telling of this history.",1399852800,,778,4.7555555555555555
2820094,5,B000PGTNFM,This was quite the good documentary about the Russian Revolution. It is very detailed about the struggle of the average Russian during the events of the Revolution. It begins with the very beginning of the Revolution. The Sailors serving in the Baltic sea. How the famine forced Russian working class to take to the streets in an attempt to simply get bread. How it evolved from a simple riot because of a lack of bread to a full blown occupation demanding the removal of the Tsar. The Tsar in response bringing in the Cossacks after it was obvious that the average military could not contain the situation. They however did not fight the protesters and instead joined them. The Tsar had lost control of his own military. Mind you that while this documentary has the usual monotone voice narration but it supplements this with reenactments to try to depict events. And where they did not do this they had old footage from the era re-mastered in color. This really gives the documentary a unique feel to it. Even the video that is filmed in modern times has a feel of old video. This film has a interesting take when telling more personal accounts. Telling it from a near omnipotent narrator narrating scenes while the actors speak fluent Russian. When appropriate the narration even stops as it becomes obvious what is happening and it shows that unlike some modern video's they took the time to make sure that all of their scenes made sense. I believe that this documentary would also be relatively good for a quick overview or crash course in the Russian Revolution. Although I would probably say that it would be better high school level students than college. while it does have quite a bit of detail i don't believe that it would cover the necessary topics for a Russian history class. Yet even while saying that it does provide quite an extensive breadth of knowledge about the influence of the foreign powers on the White army during the Russian Civil war. Even being interested in Russian history as I am I didn't even know a lot of the information presented in this Documentary. I believe that this is a great documentary especially for the price being asked.

First I was hoping that it would at least show some good footage..which it does for 1/20th of the program. The rest of the time..is ""drama"" acting out the events that supposedly ""happened"".

Very very superficial study of ""the Russian Revolution""..just the surface story that might have been on display to read  in the newspapers to read at the time the supposed events chronicled in this documentary were ""happening"".....however..more in depth study should have been an objective background of ""The Great Depression"", American & western European financial investments that had been going on since Peter the Great, but especially that which was expanding in the 1800s and right before World War 1 ,as an introduction.

Of course, it is COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE to ""accurately"" portray a historical process as complex as the Russian Revolution in a 70 minute TV program.  This program makes a decent and compelling attempt using period footage (colorized) as well as reading letters from involved participants.  The main perspective presented is one of the most influential and pivotal groups through the revolution: the sailors of the Kronstadt naval base near St Petersburg.  This program also draws a clear distinction between the soviets (simply Russian for ""council"", which were direct democracies) and the Bolshevik Party led by professional revolutionaries.  The Bolsheviks ended up taking the name of the soviets and running one of histories greatest and most brutal tyrannies with it.

This film puts a personal touch on the events by staying with the perspective of individual sailors (historical actors) throughout the program, all the way up until their bitter flight from Russia and/or executions by the Bolsheviks they had helped put into power.  Remember the Kronstadt Rebellion!

For the commenters in support of the Bolsheviks, they were funded by Wall Street: http://www.amazon.com/Wall-Street-Bolshevik-Revolution-Capitalists/dp/190557035X/",1456617600,,1394,5.760975609756097
