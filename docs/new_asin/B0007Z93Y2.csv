8054625,5,B0007Z93Y2,"I have many, many VHS and DVD documentaries about World War II.  Hunters in the Sky is probably the best of all of them.  The number of fighter pilots interviewed to make this documentary is nothing short of amazing.  Equally as amazing is that the pilots were not just American Airmen.  The list includes American, German, Japanese, Russian and other pilots as well.  All of the pilots interviewed in this documentary were ""Aces,"" five kills or more.  The gun camera footage from the planes is some of the best and the comments from these men are profound and interesting.  For World War II buffs, the other best feature of this video is that it's quite long.  I have a profound respect for the Airmen of World War II.  More American Airmen were killed in that war than any other branch of the U S armed forces, which is saying a lot.  Had the Allied Air Forces not been able to take control of the skies in the areas where they fought, it is doubtful we (the allied forces) would have won the war.",1424995200,,999,4.409836065573771

He was very pleased with this & even gained info on a person or two that he had known from the past. He was very glad to have this in his library.",1178928000,2,265,3.75
