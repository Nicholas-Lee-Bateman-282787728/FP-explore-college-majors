3854196,3,B0026KELN4,"I like the drama, but the quality of the dvd is terrible.  It looks like is being recorded one time after another, but from the copy, not the original.  The sound is terrible too. I don't recomend anybody to buy it.",1361059200,,215,4.219512195121951
3854197,1,B0026KELN4,"Es la serie original que pasaban por television, pero es una mala copia. El audio esta desfasado y la calidad del video es muy baja... Los tres volumenes tienen el mismo problema.",1307923200,5,179,4.625
3854198,1,B0026KELN4,"No entiendo porque Amazon no ha censurado estas publicaciones ya que el vendedor ofrece productos Piratas y copiados que ni siquieran son de discos originales.

Me aventure a comprar una vez y de verdad la calidad no es la esperada para el precio y las condiciones del producto dan mucho que desear.

Acostumbro a ser buen cliente cuando encuentro un buen vendedor. Les aseguro que no sere cliente de este vendedor una vez mas.

Por el contrario, les recomiendo a los amigos de Kat's Anime que a pesar de no listar en Amazon, ofrecen material de excelente calidad: Candy, Remi, Mazinger, Heidi, Dragon Ball, Saint Seiya y cientos de series clasicas y peliculas y de verdad a mi parecer, se esfuerzan bastante bien para dar satisfaccion a sus clientes..

No puedo colocar aca la direccion de su pagina web, pero si googlean usando el tag Kat's Anime los podran encontrar en la primera posicion de resultados. Su pagina es muy famosa en Venezuela. Envian a todo el mundo y aceptan PayPal como medio de pago.

Bueno, tal vez mi opinion no ayude a todos, pero espero ayude a muchos a encontrar un buen grupo donde adquirir sus colecciones de oro.. como yo lo hice. Los recomiendo!.

Saludos.

3854199,4,B0026KELN4,"I agreed with the reviews that the video quality is poor. However this story is so touchy that it doesn't really matter the quality. I cried when I finally watch the episodes. It reminded when I was a young girl having only Heidi to watch. We did not have cable and the show was every day in my home country.
My son is really enjoying. I wish there were more kids stories like this one. that is what is missing in our generation.",1284508800,6,429,4.180722891566265
3854200,3,B0026KELN4,"I had ordered and viewed all three volumes of ""Heidi-La Nina De Los Alpes"" (Heidi-The Little Girl of the Alps)  because I fell in love with pure and wholesome story that it told.  Isao Takehata's animated masterpiece based on Johanna Spyri's book ""Heidi"" has touched the hearts of millions around the globe; and mine is one of them.

However, the quality of this product and its corresponding volumes will leave something to be desired.  The video quality is equivalent to that of someone using a VHS to DVD converter with a very old and scratchy VHS.  In other words, the image and audio quality is very poor.  This is the only reason why I would rate any video product of ""Heidi"" with a mere three stars.

Regardless, this is the only physical copy of ""Heidi- The little Girl of the Alps"" that I have been able to find in any United States internet storefront.  Why this story is not more popular in the US is beyond me, however is this product worth buying?  I say, it may be worth importing a higher quality version from another country.  But if you don't feel comfortable with that, the story alone is worth it.",1278115200,12,1116,4.507462686567164

8352882,5,B0026KELN4,"I love this story from my childhood days, the picture is fairly good, is not HD or anything fancy, but is not blurry either, the sound is loud enough for me, I say that from the scale of 1 to 10, is a 7 on sound,. The price was very good and is a collector item really, I got it to complete my collection, I had volumes 2 & 3 and now I have them all. Great find.!",1506470400,,363,3.6666666666666665
