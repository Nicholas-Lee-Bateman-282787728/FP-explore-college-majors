7886536,4,6305279268,"Just one of those movies from the time era everyone should have.  The quality of the picture is nothing compared to today's feature films but, if you want to get motivated to be the best in your sport this is a movie to add to,your collection.",1357430400,,243,4.282608695652174
7886537,4,6305279268,"I have been waiting for this movie to be available on DVD for a while now when I finally found it. This was one of my favorite movies growing up. Would it be a great movie by today's standards: NO. But that is not what I judge it by. Getting this movie was more about nostalgia. It is still a movie about soccer with Pele. I enjoyed watching it again, and will re-watch it again and again in the future.

As far as the quality of the video, it was poor. When it was converted to DVD, it was not digitized. Once I adjusted the picture settings on my television, the problem was not that bad.

But, with that being said, I would high recommend this movie to fans of it from the past. You will still greatly enjoy reliving a slice of your childhood/early years. If you have never seen it before, you may want to wait until it can be cleaned up and remastered.

Side note: the DVD case says it is rated R, but that is in no way accurate.",1356912000,,933,4.087431693989071
7886538,1,6305279268,"I would think, that the fact that this movie was put to DVD it should have been cleaned up.
The entire movie was dark to the point where Pele cannot be recognised other than a dark outline.
There are a few parts in daylight yet the movie is dark.

Good old movie, horrible DVD

Do not waste you $$$$ you WILL  be disappointed.!!!!",1335571200,,330,4.2063492063492065
7886539,2,6305279268,"The quality with converting VHS to DVD is poor.  It's too bad, because this is such a great movie, but it's hard to enjoy it with poor visibility.",1255824000,,146,4.214285714285714
7886540,5,6305279268,"This is the greatest movie that i have ever seen. if you are a soocer player or not you will enjoy this film.  it is a story that every athlete can relate to.  it is about courage, heroism, passion, determination,  betrayal, and friendship. this movie portrays the life of an athlete, who  wants nothing more than to be the best. Hot Shot is without a doubt the  best sport film and possibly the best drama movie of all time.
WATCH THE  MOVIE. I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LOVE IT",963532800,11,472,4.306818181818182
7886541,3,6305279268,"Well, I've seen only half time of the video but, i like to listen and to have more info about sountrack, artist such as pele, and how this movie was filmed? thanks!",961113600,2,164,4.15625
