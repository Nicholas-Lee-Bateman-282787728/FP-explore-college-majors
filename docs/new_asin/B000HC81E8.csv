2634092,3,B000HC81E8,Part of it is drama and comedy awesome movie back years..i like movies in korea hope they would have english,1389657600,,108,4.45
2634093,3,B000HC81E8,"It's hilarious though it's kind of expected how the story goes...with a twist in the ending where they remain rivals, not lovers?",1388707200,,129,4.909090909090909
2634094,4,B000HC81E8,"Even if you love romantic comedies, but especially if you're tired of the same old stories, this movie is a nice change of pace.

The two protagonists have both become experts in the ""art of seduction"". That is, snaring a lover, taking advantage of them for some time, and then cutting them loose. They know all the tricks, or at least have developed their own set of effective ones to reuse on each victim.

Then, they meet each other. If either had really had any sense, they would have recognized that ""playing a player"" was going to be an uphill battle at best, and completely futile at worst. But it seems that the thrill of the challenge is too much for either to resist. Will they succumb to actaully falling in love? Or do they in the end find that they've simply each met their match?

To those interested in lasting, meaningful relationships, the behavior of these two is foreign, repugnant even. The obvious response is ""these two deserve each other, and who cares what happens to them?"" Yet the film manages to present them in a sympathetic way without making us feel like we have to approve of their tactics.

It's a fine line, but I found myself actually caring how things turned out. Even more there are lots of great supporting characters, and plenty of laughs. No one's taking themselves too seriously, which makes for a very entertaining, light-hearted comedy (except for one scene, completely out of place in this film, in which one of these two literally poisons the other...don't worry, the movie gets right back on track after that bizarre detour).",1383696000,3,1570,4.698181818181818
2634095,3,B000HC81E8,It was okay.  the story was alright but nothing really special.  I guess it wasn't something I could relate to but maybe there are really people out there who are like this.,1379116800,,173,4.375
2634096,5,B000HC81E8,"The movie looks like a cliche, and it absolutely is. However, unlike many other copies this movie is actually entertaining, and the female protagonist is not an absolute doormat. ""The Art of Seduction,"" does include mentions of sex and actual condoms- I really appreciate that the director did not focus on the tired, ""pure,"" girl. Plus, it shows two intelligent adults engaging in protected, consensual sex! Consent and the use of protection is always a positive thing.
The male protagonist is also very clever, and both protagonists know that this is a game. They're very adept at playing on each other's expectations, which draws out the whole plot.
While this isn't mind-blowing and amazing, it is very entertaining, and lends itself well to a girl's night-in.",1379030400,8,764,5.071428571428571
2634097,2,B000HC81E8,"Seemed like such a cute movie...But maybe the essence of the concept was lost in translation. Acting seemed contrived, basic emotions seemed flat. An uncomfortable waste of time.",1376524800,,178,5.392857142857143
2634098,5,B000HC81E8,Highly recommended. This movie kept my attention. I loved it. I should not have to have a word required status to rate a movie!,1369785600,4,127,4.333333333333333
2634099,2,B000HC81E8,"I bought this movie because i saw Song il-kook in Jumong and am a very big fan.  I was very disappointed in the ""silly"" plot line.  He also was not that believable as a ""playboy"".  He was much better in Jumong and Emperor of the Sea.",1194566400,3,233,4.021739130434782
2634100,4,B000HC81E8,Not a bad film.  Funny moments and some notes to write down if you're on a date and you want to win by wooing the opposite sex!,1175472000,3,127,3.7037037037037037

8138405,5,B000HC81E8,"Absolutely adored watching these master players pitch their skills against each other. Even if you are not a fan of sub-titled shows, don't pass having a great laugh.",1432944000,,166,4.964285714285714
8138406,3,B000HC81E8,"It was ""just OK"".  I love Song Il Gook and Son Ye Jin.  They play their characters as written, but the script was skimpy.  Think that I would love another drama with a better script that this one for these two to interact in.",1425340800,,225,4.068181818181818
