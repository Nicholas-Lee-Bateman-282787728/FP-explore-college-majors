7985182,5,B00008J2KT,A very well gone summary of the recent and past (Chapman) discoveries of dinosaur remains in the Gobi Desert,1403913600,,108,4.7368421052631575
7985183,3,B00008J2KT,"This program has great footage of an AMNH expedition to the Gobi in the 1990s and cool archival footage of an expedition from the 1920s. It milks the adventure of working in this corner of the globe: the truck breakdowns in the wilderness, getting lost, roughing it. But the filmmakers don't seem to know how to make the science or the finding of fossils exciting (well, it is tedious work). The stilted dinosaur animation is embarrassing even by '90s standards. And they stoop to a corny dino Romeo and Juliet narrative, the sort of shallow tactic these pop science shows take when they don't think the science is in and of itself interesting enough. That said, there is also a nice time lapse sequence of a preparator exposing a dinosaur skull out of the rock. A flawed production but very much worth a look by anyone interested in dinosaurs or paleontology.",1343952000,2,860,4.701986754966887
7985184,5,B00008J2KT,"Dinosaurs are almost everyone's favorite fossils. More books have been written and movies made about dinosaurs than any other group of fossils. Dinosaurs are replicated or included in numerous children's toys. Does anyone not know about Tyranosaurus? There's ""Jurassic Park."" There's Barney. Our culture is overrun with dinosaurs.

So, how did all of this come to be? Well, dinosaurs are among some of the most spectacular fossils known and were collected way back in the early 1800s when the science of Geology was in it's infancy. But they are not particularly abundant. They are only found in sedimentary rocks deposited during the Mesozoic Era. They are very difficult to collect and display. An actual collection of dinosaurs or dinosaur remains is exceedingly expensive and well beyond the means of the average person.

I'm not certain where or when I got this video as I discovered it hidden away in my DVD library and it's probably been there for at least a decade or more and dates back to before the time that I began reviewing things for Amazon. In any case, in this DVD The National Geographic Society presents ""Dinosaur Hunters,"" the ongoing story of exploration and extraction of some extraordinary dinosaur remains from the Gobi Desert interior of Mongolia. The film outlines and emphasizes one of the expeditions. If there are any stars in this documentary film, they are Mike and Mark, two vertebrate paleontologists from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The DVD chronicles the extraordinary difficulties of traveling to central Mongolia. The journey itself is a formidable task, but the scientific party also have to discover, extract and transport the fossils back to NYC. The difficulties are incredible! It takes an expedition of perhaps 50 or so people and all of their provisions have to be transported along with them because the countryside they are exploring is largely uninhabited desert. Even roads (as we know them) are absent.

Well, in spite of all the incredible difficulties, paleontologists Mike and Mark and all their scientific colleagues, camp workers, drivers, etc., etc., etc. managed to collect some excellent specimens of three different suborders of dinosaurs and specimens  of other fossils and managed to get them back to NYC. It's a fascinating expedition story, well documented by the National Geographic film crew and well illustrated with diagrams and animations. The dinosaur remains are explained as a part of the extraction process. It's a fascinating story. If you really want to know what Dinosaur hunting might be like, this video is excellent.

Let me add a final personal note to this review. Mike Novacek, of Mike and Mark, was a student of mine back around 1980 at San Diego State. He was a graduate student in vertebrate paleontology and on our campus that subject is taught in the Biology Department. I was a Geology Professor and Mike took about four of my Geology courses and I served as an outside member on his MS thesis committee. Mike was a pleasure as a student. He was the type of guy that could sit in my office and talk about Mesozoic stratigraphy, and then the conversation might drift over into some of the latest trends in Punk Rock and New Wave music. It was a pleasure, and it's so great to see him included as a major part of this National Geographic Video.

7985185,5,B00008J2KT,This is a great documentary on fossils found in the Gobi desert. It gives some history (with Roy Chapman Andrews expeditions) and then of course follows through into more recent treks into Mongolia with Mark Norell and Mike Novacek. My 5 year old son loves this program. This DVD is what influenced him to request a trip to the Museum of Natural History for his 5th birthday.,1256342400,,375,4.611940298507463
7985186,5,B00008J2KT,"I purchased this video hoping to learn more about dinosaurs and the paleontologists that enrich this prehistoric world for our families.  I was not disappointed.  This was a great look into a cross section of paleontologists' lives, their efforts, their disappointments, their failures and successes.  Good education and entertainment for the whole family.",1219968000,5,356,5.679245283018868
7985187,1,B00008J2KT,I came to say the same thing.  This is NOT the TV movie that stars Henry Ian Cusick.  I've let Amazon and IMDb know and they just aren't listening.,1216944000,3,147,4.0344827586206895
7985188,1,B00008J2KT,"If you're buying this DVD to see Henry Ian Cusick, as I did... you will be disappointed as this is NOT the show he was in.
His was a different ""Dinosaur Hunter"" which was a TV show made and shown only in the UK. That show has been impossible to find.",1206662400,6,250,3.9215686274509802
