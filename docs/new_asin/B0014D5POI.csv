3129609,4,B0014D5POI,"This is a concert DVD, but doesn't have the feel of the concert we went to a few months ago.  It's like watching all the ""concerts"" on each episode,back to back, but it's a nice change.  I'd recommend this.  25 songs one after the other, most I've heard, some I hadn't.  I only wish this DVD was longer than 55 minutes.  We got it last week and have watched it over and over.  I would recommend the concerts, if you haven't been to one.  They were really good.
One less star because the USPS damaged the DVD box (DVD comes in a box w/ a kazoo above it) as well as the Kazoo that comes and the DVD was loose in the box.  This should have gone out in a box and not a padded envelope.",1210723200,,681,3.9558823529411766

8255244,3,B0014D5POI,I got this the day it went in stores. I have to say it isn't what I expected. The sing-along didn't show back-up vocals.  I thought it would be a live concert and it isn't. It was alright.  (Comments from my 9 year old daughter),1214784000,,228,4.044444444444444
