3171483,4,B0017DQF94,"Terrific story told about this tragic hero of our times. Outstanding ballplayer who faced the cultural challenges of being black and latino, from Puerto Rico, in the big leagues before Civil Rights legislation was passed. His life ended trying to help others. Worth adding to your video library.",1384819200,,295,5.166666666666667
3171484,5,B0017DQF94,"~ This 60-minute documentary is part of the excellent PBS American Experience series.  It documents the life and times of Roberto Clemente from his birth in Puerto Rico to his untimely death on a flight to Nicaragua. While his baseball career is of course discussed, that is not the main main purpose of the documentary.  The main focus is on his experience coming to America as one of the first Latin American baseball players to appear in the major leagues.  The documentary deals sensitively with the prejudice he endured and how he rose above that prejudice to become not only an excellent athlete but a role model and hero to people throughout Latin America.  Indeed, most of the documentary deals with how Roberto channeled his energies into serving his community and his family.  Even today, decades after he died on a flight taking supplies to earthquake victims, he continues to inspire others.
~ If Roberto Clemente had played out his career and retired, he would be remembered by a few as a great baseball player.  Instead, because of his pride and social conscience he is remembered by many as a great man.
~ Highly recommended.",1382313600,5,1140,4.82051282051282

3171491,4,B0017DQF94,"Roberto Clemente was my baseball hero as a young boy growing up in the Midwest. I have a couple of books about his life and was really excited about getting this DVD. (I had missed it when PBS aired it several months ago)
The DVD is good, really good, but not great!
Before viewing this DVD, I just knew that it would show Clemente's famous batting stance and style. But, there was none of that. How I remember him taking forever, it seemed to rough up the outside line of the batters box prior to batting. He stood so deep in the batting box, that the pitcher was eager to blow one past Clemente. It was then that he would step into the pitch and solidly hit the baseball. His final hit was number 3,000!
Maybe someday someone will make a better film of this truly great baseball hero. Until then, I will watch this one with great delight.",1275609600,5,840,4.289308176100629
3171492,5,B0017DQF94,"This DVD contains a wonderful recounting of the life of one of baseball's true greats, and it isn't only for baseball fans.  Roberto Clemente was the first great Latin American baseball star in the US.  Clemente's life is recounted from his very humble beginnings in Puerto Rico (his father worked in the sugar cane fields) to his stardom with the Pittsburgh Pirates to his tragic death.  The story is told in such a way as to really bring Clemente to life.  There are interviews with many who knew him, including his wife Vera, his teammate Manny Sanguillen, as well as Orlando Cepeda and David Maraniss (who wrote a terrific biography of Clemente a few years ago which I've reviewed previously).  They show some clips from some interviews he gave with reporters, and you'll get a sense of how surly he could be.  Of course his achievements in baseball figure prominently in this tale.  The 300 hits, the 2 World Series, his being robbed of the MVP.  Beyond the purely baseball aspect though, you'll learn how Clemente was a many of dignity, with a tremendous amount of pride and respect for his family and for his fellow Puerto Ricans, and a man who ultimately died trying to help others.  He is what we would hope all our sports heros would be like.  This DVD is a great homage to a great baseball player, highly recommended.",1240531200,20,1328,4.636752136752137

3171497,2,B0017DQF94,"Yes, this film is done professionally & has good stock footage. I give 2 stars as partial credit for the fine professionalism. However, this film misses the boat regarding the theme of Clemente's life. I recommend Richard Rossi's film ""Baseball's Last Hero: 21 Clemente Stories"" which shows how the motif of his life was the Bible verse ""Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends..."" Despite the central importance of this scripture to Clemente, this movie ignores it. As the article the Christian Dreams of Clement states: ""This 2008 production manages to devote sixty minutes to Robertos life and career without once mentioning God or Jesus Christ. It is a curious documentary trying to cover his whole life, while omitting its most important aspect. To make matters worse, the documentary struggles to capture what motivated Clemente, depicting him as a mysterious introvert.  After the narrator informs us that Clemente had some eccentricities, David Marannis, his most recent biographer, comments:
  Clemente was kind of New Age before there was New Age. He was an incredible masseuse. He was constantly taking different proteins and odd concoctions of shakes to try to stay healthy. He believed in mystical connections between life and death and people who were no longer around.
  Yet those closest to Clementehis family, pastors and friends have made clear that Roberto was a committed Christian, who grew into a full-rounded Catholic, and that is what decisively shaped his life. To mistake Clementes serious nature with an eccentric mysticism is to miss the whole meaning of his life."" Order the far more spiritually insightful feature dramatic film on Amazon, ""Baseball's Last Hero: 21 Clemente Stories"" which has garnered fans around the cause of the canonization of Clemente.",1401840000,,1823,5.187074829931973
