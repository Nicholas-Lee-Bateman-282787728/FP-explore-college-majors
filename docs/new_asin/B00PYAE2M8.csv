6826506,3,B00PYAE2M8,"""Tales from Earthsea"" is a Miyazaki movie. Just not THE Miyazaki.

No, this extremely loose adaptation of Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea series is directed by Hayao Miyazaki's son, Goro Miyazaki. And it has the earmarks of a promising first effort -- the visuals are hauntingly lovely, the dialogue is sometimes beautiful, and there's raw passion in its making. But honestly, the story is often confusing, and fans of Le Guin's books will probably implode with rage over the story changes.

The archmage Sparrowhawk encounters a young boy named Prince Arren in the desert, and takes him under his wing. Arren is on the run from his own kingdom after committing a horrible crime, and Sparrowhawk is out to find out why magic seems to be draining out of the world, and darkness is creeping into people's hearts.

After some misadventures with slavers, they make their way to Sparrowhawk's friend/love interest Tenar, and her adopted daughter Therru. Unfortunately, the malevolent mage Cob has learned of Sparrowhawk's presence nearby, and plans to use Arren in his quest for eternal life and revenge againt Sparrowhawk... unless Therru can help her friend come to terms with his inner darkness.

Like most movies from Studio Ghibli, ""Tales From Earthsea"" is visually stunning almost beyond belief -- ivy-draped cities, azure seaports, dark looming castles against twilight skies, and long sweeping green fields dotted with trees in the morning sun. There's a genuine sense of magic and mystery to this world, and you can really feel the passion that Miyazaki had for his story and the way it's depicted.

However, the story itself is kind of mixed. The dialogue is strong and often hauntingly powerful (""But only to men is it given to know that we must die, and that is a precious gift""), and the story has some scenes that linger in the mind afterwards. But the narrative is often confusing -- the murky cosmology, undeveloped backstory (what are the tombs of Atuan?), and the whole subplot about Arren is just befuddling. His initial actions -- before we even get to know him -- are baffling.

Most of the story's character development centers on Arren. He seems like a nice polite young boy, but from his very first shocking scene we see that darkness and despair are slowly consuming him. Miyazaki crafts a solid father/son relationship between Arren and Sparrowhawk, and the archmage is also a powerful character -- understanding, forgiving, and universally kind.

Miyazaki also spins up a solid bond between Sparrowhawk and his old friend Tenar, who have the comfortable feel of an old married couple who know each other so well that they can practically finish each other's sentences. Therru is flawed, though -- she's not really fleshed out much, and she does something near the movie's end that left me scratching my head. It wasn't really foreshadowed or hinted at -- it just happens.

As for the villain Cob... uh, he seems like just a pallid effeminate villain at first, but he gets progressively creepier as we see more of him. Example: the scene where he slips Arren a roofie to get his true name. That was... disturbing.

Goro Miyazaki isn't the master that his father is, but there is still plenty of power, beauty and promise in his movie debut, ""Tales From Earthsea."" Beautifully rendered, but flawed.",1420502400,39,3312,4.942446043165468

DVD + Blu-Ray Discs of a movie called ""Tales from Earthsea""
Some codes for use to unlock Disney Movie Rewards

If you are a fan of the Earthsea Cycle from Ursula K LeGuin, this movie will be almost completely unrecognizable to you. Aside from the names of the characters being correct, they are almost nothing like the actual characters. The setting and locations of the movie are wrong, the relationships between the characters are mostly wrong; it's almost incomprehensible that the original story would have to be changed in such a way to create this movie.

From the very beginning when we see Prince Arren murder his father - never happened. To the way he meets the Archmage - completely wrong. To Cob being in charge of the slavers - never happened. To Arren meeting Therru before he becomes king - yeah nope. The list goes on and on.

I tried to set aside the actual story of Earthsea to see if I could appreciate the movie for what it was - a completely different story that had nothing to do with the original. And I just couldn't do it. The voice acting was weak all around - Tenar had none of the strength and power that she should have had; Cob was portrayed as this feminine creature living in a castle - no idea where that came from. Timothy Dalton's portrayal of the Archmage was tolerable but only because he has such a striking voice. There was nothing of Therru's personality or tragedy in the portrayal, and I was overcome with the sense that these voice actors were just completely lazy in their reading. Maybe they had read the books too and were as shocked to discover this movie was nothing like them.

Changing the original story is often the case in movies, but the changes made here and the chaotic nature of the storytelling simply made no sense at all. I'm not even sure what story was actually being told. There was none of the rich tapestry of Earthsea present in this film - it was merely titled ""Tales from Earthsea"" but had nothing to offer of Earthsea itself. It's a stretch to say this movie is even ""Based on"" the original books.

Visually, the movie is beautiful. The scenery and attention to detail of simple things like flowing water, ivy growing on columns, and brickwork - splendid and tremendously creative. It didn't come anywhere close to salvaging this movie, however.

If you know anything about Earthsea, avoid this movie. It, like the made for TV movie do a complete disservice to Ursula K LeGuin, and the writers should be ashamed of themselves for such disrespect to the books.",1470614400,7,2553,4.575492341356674

6826538,2,B00PYAE2M8,This is the worst Miyazaki film and I've seen even the more obscure ones. They don't bother to be clear that's not by Hayao Miyazaki on the cover (but by his son). I find that to be misleading. The movie makes very little sense. Bad storytelling in my opinion. I even tried to watch it twice to see if it made more sense the second time around. The answer was no.,1456704000,,363,4.126760563380282
6826539,5,B00PYAE2M8,"Just watched this movie last night after wanting to see it for so long since I only watched it part way in the past. Without giving to much away, this movie is about a depressed boy who murdered his father and when found out in the wilderness, joins a wizard on his journey to many different places in the movie. The main villain is named Kobb (haven't read the Earthsea books, so I am not familiar with the spelling of the villain's name) and the main characters eventually confront Kobb in various situations eventually leading to the final confrontation of Kobb. One of the things I will pick at in this movie is that Kobb can't stand dealing with women and says so in the movie a couple of times. I just thought I would warn others about that if it would bother them too much. Also, since Kobb's voice is like a whisper in the movie, you may have to turn the volume up in order to hear him, lol. The voice actor for Kobb, in my opnion, did a great job voicing him. Also, if you a letting your children watch this movie, keep in mind it is rated PG-13 for a reason. The movie has blood in it coming out of dragons in one scene, the movie also has slavery in it, and someones hand gets hacked off in the movie. I won't say who's and by whom, but if you think that would bother you too much to let your kids watch the movie or would disturb your children, I would not let them watch this movie until they are mature enough to watch those kinds of scenes in movies. But if my 4-5 year old nephew can watch this movie with no problems, I'm sure your children can handle it too.

All in all, I enjoyed the movie very much and I am so happy I was finally able to watch it. Years of yearning to watch this movie not wasted! Like all Studio Ghibli films, it is a very good film and if you enjoy other Studio Ghibli films, you should watch this Studio Ghibli film as well! I recommend it to you and I am sure you will enjoy it!",1454371200,2,1921,4.095490716180372

6826561,2,B00PYAE2M8,"A big fan of Hayao Miyazaki's work, I was excited to see if the same skill and attention to detail were passed on to his son. If only judging by this film, I can't say that they have. Poor pacing, confusing character motivations and a disappointing climax made me wish I had rented this instead of buying it for my Ghibli collection.

Highlights include the background for the main city that they visit, and their are a handful of moments were Goro breaks away from cloning his father's style and finds his own voice. Unfortunately, most of those scenes revolve around the more violent aspects of the film (warning to parents, this earns its PG-13), in stark contrast to his father's hallmark of finding serene character moments. Luckily, I was able to throw in Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind immediately after to balance myself back out.

I have not read the books from which this movie is based, so I can not say how faithful an adaptation it is. If you are a fantasy or Ghibli junkie, I would still recommend borrowing before you buy, unless you absolutely need it for your collection.",1438214400,,1092,4.5948717948717945

6826579,5,B00PYAE2M8,"I am not going to write much about the story as to how closely to the book this film follows.  I have not read any of  Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea Books yet.  But, after seeing this film I would like to read them.  So, all I will address is the story in the film which I could follow but I did need to pay attention since there were many details and it could be confusing for anyone who doesn't watch carefully.  I'm a 62 year old grandma who purchased this to watch with my grandchildren when they visit me.  They love anything by Studio Ghibli especially the fantasies.  I have always loved the drawing in them because they are so beautifully done.  It didn't disappoint!  In fact, this ranks right up there with my other Miyazaki favorites Grave of the Fireflies, Spirted Away, Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbor Tortoro and Ponyo.  Sometimes I'm in a simple childlike mood and other times choose a more complex one for the imagery

One other thing I point out to Christian parents.  If you are wondering if you want your children to see these fantasies of Studio Ghibli since there is clearly new age content and especially Shinto beliefs, since Studio Ghibli is located in Japan.  You will have to decide that for yourselves based especially upon the ages of your children.  In our household we have watched films like this WITH our children/ grandchildren so that as subject matter has come up we could pause the film on the first time through to talk about our beliefs and why we choose to not believe the same way as the story tellers.  But, as our children have gotten older I think this is an important part of parenting to educate our children in philosophies that they will be encountering.  Lastly, for the sake of fantasy and just plain enjoyment of the world through a child's eyes where buses are shaped like cats and transport us to wherever we need to be going or a fish can look like a playmate.  It's ok to have a bit of whimsy and so for our family we have introduced fantasy into our children's lives encouraging it and have gone there with them.  Who hasn't observed that children pretend all the time anyways.  It's called playing!

I will end by saying that I am looking forward in years to come to see how Goro Miyazaki develops as a director following in his father's big footsteps.",1430352000,18,2309,4.478468899521531

6826612,4,B00PYAE2M8,"Let me quickly summarize my feelings of the movie for those that don't want to read more than a couple sentences: Tales from Earthsea is a gorgeous and mysterious movie that focuses on how the mutual love and respect of 4 very distinct characters ultimately overcomes the dangerous plans of an evil wizard. It has very little to do with the Earthsea books to be honest, but it stands on its own as a very unique and underappreciated movie. For me, it is a must-see for any fan of traditional fantasy and Ghibli-style animation.

For starters, this is an absolutely gorgeous film that holds up to the best of Studio Ghibli animation. Colors can be exceptional, especially on good plasma sets. The scene where Arren is wandering through the swamps before Cob steals his body is one such example of the absolutely sublime and beautiful color that is hidden in this film. And the shots of Theru's house in the summer, with its deep blue skies and rich green grasses, are a perfect contrast to the dim and bleak palette of Cob's fortress. There's something very honest and straightforward about this animation. It might not knock you over the head like Spirited Away, but it has a childish enthusiasm (and adult talent) that sets it apart from most other anime of its time. It's accomplished without being perfectionist.

As for the story, you can nit pick it all you want, and there are some valid points to be made about its meandering nature and vague back story. However, I think its true message still shines forth. The movie is really a story about how two troubled children - one abused by her parents and taken in by a lovely and caring woman, the other possessed by an evil alter-ego and on the run from it - develop a love for each other that is the key to thwarting the apocalyptic plans of a deranged wizard. That's about as fantasy as you can get, and I wholeheartedly enjoyed the simple and traditional storytelling. And in typical Ghibli fashion, we are shown the hopes, fears and joys of these simple characters, and while the end result may not be as emotionally powerful as those in Hayao Miyazaki's own films, it is every bit as genuine.

The English dub is exceptional with Timothy Dalton especially standing out as a perfect voice actor for Archmage Sparrowhawk. His lines are delivered with perfect poise and restraint, in the spirit of a wizard from a world like Guin's. Willem DaFoe also does a terrific job, transitioning between the overly-confident ""first"" Cob to the desperate, maniacal ""second"" Cob. While I admit there could be some better exposition and clarification to these characters and their motivations, all the actors do a great job with the lines they are given. I can't imagine different actors taking over these roles, so kudos to the English casting team for putting together a diverse and capable cast.

Also noteworthy is the accomplished sound mix presented on the BluRay. I was immediately immersed in the world of Earthsea, and was quite impressed by the level of detail and the mix between the sound effects and music. It is an easy 5/5 for this kind of movie and is best enjoyed in a nice surround sound environment. Cheers to all the sound recordists, foley artists and music producers involved in this project - you guys never seem to get the credit you deserve, but you definitely deserve it for this one!

All in all, Tales From Earthsea is a surprisingly capable and accomplished movie that really deserves attention, despite its usually critical reviews. It looks beautiful, is voice acted perfectly, sounds incredible, and fulfills all the basic requirements of a good fantasy story. The characters aren't fully flushed out and motivations are murky, but if you like Studio Ghibli animation, and are a fan of good old fashioned fantasy storytelling, give Tales From Earthsea a shot - you won't regret it.",1424217600,11,3856,4.775112443778111
