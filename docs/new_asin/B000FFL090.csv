2562929,5,B000FFL090,"This film was an eye opener for me as I live in California.  I love the raw footage and pure emotion that comes with this film.  The actors portray real life...as it was.  They simply give the viewers what they were thinking, feeling, seeing, and hearing.  As devastating as Katrina was, its power is caught in this film.  It changed millions of peoples lives, but Justin gives everyone a first hand look into what one man can do to help. I would recommend this film to anyone!

2562930,5,B000FFL090,"The twenty-four year old, Justin Pierce, is full of talent.  He has created a memorable dvd of Katrina's Hurricane disaster for people to treasure.  This is a great dvd to add to a collection of memories and the turning point of the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  I would like to thank Justin for taking the time to create such a wonderful dvd that is worth more than words can express.",1146441600,3,380,4.478260869565218
2562931,5,B000FFL090,"I'm a Biloxi native, and to this day, it is still difficult for me to drive down the beach because of the ghosts that still haunt my memories...of the places I used to frequent...of the trees and grass so green...of all that is dead and gone.

This documentary is like no other made of the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina.  It tells a personal story through one man that can be shared by so many others.  It's not just before and after shots with sad music.  It gives the audience a peek into the state of mind of many Mississippi residents--why so many chose to stay--why none of us will ever stay again.

Thank you to J. Justin Pearce, et. al. for sharing their experience with the rest of the world.",1146441600,3,706,4.358778625954199
2562932,5,B000FFL090,"This documentary is a raw, first-hand look at the Katrina disaster from a local's perspective.  The pre-storm and other previously unseen footage is what makes this film truly unique.  Growing up on the Gulf Coast, I have many memories of the Biloxi area and the beauty it once held.  Seeing these images from the storm is a very moving experience for me; the coast is almost unrecognizable.  Unfortunately, the level of damage was, and still is, ignored by the media.  This film definately makes you appreciate the power of nature and makes you think about the things we take for granted every day; especially for those of us still living on the Gulf Coast.  I loved the film and would recomend it to anyone interested in learning more about the hardships caused by Hurricane Katrina.",1146182400,9,785,4.777777777777778
2562933,5,B000FFL090,"This Hurricane Katrina documentary is the best I've seen!  The mere fact that the pre-Katrina footage was shot with the storm not being taken seriously adds a powerful impact to the film.  The post-Katrina footage is heartwrenching. For those who really want to see what occurred on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, this is a must buy!",1146182400,5,330,4.875
2562934,5,B000FFL090,"I have bought all the other videos and books on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina available on the Gulf Coast. This is by far the best I have seen. Both the people and the scenes are real and will touch the hearts of anyone who lived on the Gulf Coast or has who friends and family who were touched by the storm. There are several original songs on the DVD that hammer home the fellings of those of us still here. In addition to the film, there are also tons of special features that are sure to be a treasure for years to come.",1146182400,4,529,4.096153846153846
8121878,5,B000FFL090,"There really are no words to describe how spectacular Pearce was when he created this film. I am grateful to be one of the first, very privileged, to get to view this shortly prior to release. I can say I know, first hand, what that area looked like before Katrina came ashore. I was stationed at Keesler AFB, as a new Airman in the Air Force from 1999-2001 and had both my children at the base medical center. Then I returned for some additional training, Jan 2006, months after Katrina. I felt like my world had crumbled all around me seeing my once home so very sad and gray. I have thousands of photos and memories, before and after. Pearce did an excellent job at showing all aspects of Biloxi's life before and after this tragedy. This film will be kept in my family, along with all my other photos and memories, for a very long time as a reminder of what can happen 'in the blink of an eye' and  how residents work together to rebuild. This will be handed down to my children. Thank you, Pearce, for allowing others, outside of Katrina's path, to experience Biloxian's lives!",1451174400,,1082,4.437185929648241
8121879,5,B000FFL090,"As a California tourist who was trapped in the Superdome during Katrina, I was especially interested in seeing this film.  I knew that it wasn't a big budget professional job, but with the resources available and the creativity of the filmmakers I was incredibly moved by the film techniques used.  The before and after shots and the stark contrasts presented by people who had lost everything really brought home the reality of the devastation of Katrina on the Mississippi Coast.  Much attention has been paid to New Orleans and the levee failures and much more work still needs to be done to rebuild but the City, but this  film gave a first hand account of another neglected area.  I hope to see other films from these upcoming artists!

8121880,1,B000FFL090,"Unfortunately, I let the 13 existing reviews influence my decision to purchase this one.  I read the words ""raw footage"" and ""amateurish"" in some reviews, but I thought ""How bad can it be?  Thirteen people liked it.""  Let me tell you, it's very, very bad.  Horrible camera shake is present throughout the entire film.  The editing is hit-and-miss, with far more miss than hit.  It seems like half the film is shot from a moving car (maybe more), and the camera is bouncing from subject to subject continually.  Even when not in a car, the motion is non-stop.  I truly believe a 4-year-old could hold a camera still enough to let you focus on something occasionally, which does not happen in this film.  I also read these words in other reviews: ""graduated with people in the film"", ""lived in Biloxi"", etc.  Maybe the closeness to the situation helps those viewers get more out of the film, but if you want to experience the hurricane, get something made by someone who knew what they were doing.  After watching this one time, I'll be happy to sell my copy for $10, and I'll pay the shipping. I fully expect to throw it away.  I have never wanted to take the time to review a product before, but this time, I felt I had to keep someone else from wasting their money.",1288828800,3,1266,4.4803493449781655
8121881,5,B000FFL090,"Think Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans??  Think again.  The eye of the storm uprooted the culture-rich coast of Mississippi.  A first-hand story of how life is easily taken for granted, these adventure-seeking young men were content with staying home until the storm passed.  Escaping life-taking torrent merely moments before the wrath, the only thing these boys saved---was their very own breath.

I highly recommend this film for all viewing audiences.  Prepare for an awe-inspiring, breathtaking experience... as nature's fury on planet earth becomes uncomfortably personal.",1254441600,,579,5.752941176470588
8121882,5,B000FFL090,"This documentary touched home on so many levels. I went to school with several of the people included in this documentary, including the film maker. I was blown away at the accuracy of emotion, and the general good humored nature...'before the storm'. I grew up in Biloxi, St. Martin & Ocean Springs. I was in OS at the time the storm started to roll in, and as as Pearce and Trocesset documented, my friends and family all laughed this storm off, as we'd done our whole lives. Never did we know the chain of events that would occur. We never knew that evacuating on August 28th would mean splitting up friends and family for months and years to come. I never knew that when Jim Cantore said, ""Take a look folks...you'll never see it this way again,"" that he MEANT what he said. I would have taken more pictures. I would have driven down the beach once more. It is nearing three years since this happened, and though so many good things have come from Hurricane Katrina (including meeting my fiance), I still weep when confronted with the reality that we Mississippians all faced. Who knew on August 28th-while we rode the calm before the storm-that we would return to rubble, searching morgues and shelters for our loved ones, and and entirely different way of looking at life as we knew it. J. Justin Pearce put this documentary together not only as a film maker, but as a resident. It was an emotional ride between seeing my home as it was before Katrina, and afterward. Thank you so much for the opportunity to see it from a resident's eyes.",1200268800,,1545,4.541218637992832
8121883,5,B000FFL090,"This was an awesome film! i really did hit home considering i live in Ocean SPrings and i did not evacuate...i was in the attic and could feel our roof starting to come off..this film is the only one i know of that actually shows biloxi and ocean springs, ms and not New Orleans...Bravo! Also, the girl in the film, Erin Redmond, graduated with me in Ocean Springs 2002..",1175472000,2,371,4.391304347826087
8121884,5,B000FFL090,"When I found this movie about Hurricane Katrina with NO mention of New Orleans, I wanted it immediately. I hoped I would be seeing something no other media outlet's shown before, and I was not disappointed. I live in Virginia, I have never been to southern Mississipi or the Gulf coast and I've never experienced such life-changing destruction. Yet this movie really hit home. The people in the film could be MY friends and family - the conversations, the banter, the laughter. The gorgeous homes on the coast could have been from my neighborhood. The denial that something truly bad could EVER happen to my home is so personal, yet universal. It's those connections that make the devastation shown throughout the film that much more powerful and humbling. This film makes you feel like you are a part of Justin's life. I think every American across the country should see this. You leave it feeling awed by the power of Mother Nature, but also inspired by the strength of her survivors.",1150588800,4,987,4.777777777777778
8121885,5,B000FFL090,Just wonderful!  A very powerful movie.  The best DVD I have seen on Hurricane Katrina. It was heart wrenching to watch the devastation of so many lives.  Enjoyed the small window showing the Gulf Coast before Katrina while seeing the after effects of Katrina.  This movie really shows the power of a hurricane.  One can really get the feel of the lives that were effected by the hurricane and see just how beautiful the gulf coast was before Katrina.  It also shows how people do not always take warnings seriously.,1147824000,4,516,4.677777777777778
8121886,5,B000FFL090,"When I left Biloxi in November of 1969, we had been destroyed by hurricane Camille. Watching this film brought it all back and more. My heart goes out to ya'll and Justin did a great job. Thanks for including tunes of our new cd ""Take Me Back Biloxi"", I'm glad I could add a small part to your film. I highly recommend this film.

8121887,5,B000FFL090,"There's something special about this little story.  The film is raw but resilient, as is the wounded Mississippi Coast, and the people in the viewfinder are just as real.  Amateurish, yes, but you can't stop looking.  The risks taken by Pearce far exceed the typical ""clever"" dime-a-dozen documentaries.  The disaster footage is incredible and there's real art within this diamond-in-the-rough.",1146787200,3,394,5.516666666666667
