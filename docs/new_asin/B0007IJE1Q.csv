2212283,5,B0007IJE1Q,"Dr Hu is a good and generous teacher. These exercises are an excellent introduction to qi gong, although it is always better to go to a class.",1347494400,,142,4.296296296296297
2212284,5,B0007IJE1Q,"The first time I tried this DVD, I was sore days after; and I didn't overdo it either.  I have been enjoying it ever since.  I was also impressed by the fast delivery to my home.  I so love Amazon.com!",1320796800,,201,3.975
2212285,1,B0007IJE1Q,"Something about the instructor and routines just didn't resonate with me.  I tried the DVD and gave it a chance, but it's not for me.  Maybe if your muscles are super-inflexible, this is a good one?  Anyway, I didn't care for it, and will be looking to sell my copy.",1297987200,3,266,4.28
2212286,5,B0007IJE1Q,"Hu is the first Qi Gong teacher I've found to be playful and have fun with his exercises which makes them way more enlivening to do.  I can see (or sense if you must)the Qi in his hands and between his hands and his body; he's just very alive to it which made me more awake to my own.  He is not the least bit formal, tight, scared, or proving his worth, but relaxed and helpful, talking and demonstrating all the way through.  There is a group of standing exercises, then a few sitting (which I do standing because of a knee situation) and then some crazy walking exercises.  He helps you make these forms your own by relaxing into them.
He's a gem, all the more special coming out of a very formal culture and martial arts background.
I loved that when he was outdoors in different segments that he was on the ground.  If a bit unlevel or rough, he just adjusted.  Other teachers seem to need big wooden platforms to stand on while in nature.
I am pleased beyond any expectation.",1294876800,21,981,4.304347826086956
2212287,4,B0007IJE1Q,DVD arrived safely and securely and timeously.  Enjoy learning and practicing the Wild Goose routines and to spending time each year with teacher.,1289692800,,146,5.3478260869565215
2212288,5,B0007IJE1Q,"It is not always easy but smart, elegant and skillful. This master knows how to dance with energy.",1280534400,4,98,4.5
2212289,5,B0007IJE1Q,These are really wonderful exercises!  I highly recommend this DVD.  I've taken classes from his students and found this style to be very healing and vitalizing.,1256601600,12,161,5.153846153846154
2212290,5,B0007IJE1Q,"This DVD has really helped me gain a lot of flexibility that long hours at the computer had not helped with. My massage therapist comments that I am now extraordinarily flexible. I use the first six standing QiGongs daily, and sometimes do the sitting ones, am still learning the final walking ones. Dr. Hu is a pleasure to watch. I found it easy to learn this from a DVD, often repeating one segment a bunch of times till I got it.

Highly recommended!",1233792000,29,453,4.457831325301205
8047511,5,B0007IJE1Q,"This is an excellent Qigong DVD. It is very effective in increasing flexibility and getting the qi flowing. I enjoy doing it either alone or  as a warm to resistance training i.e. Kettlebells ,clubs or sandbags.",1521417600,,211,4.861111111111111
8047512,4,B0007IJE1Q,I have been watching this video and really enjoy 5 of the six standing forms and 2 of the 3 sitting forms. Perhaps I'll grow to like the Swimming Dragon form as I become more flexible and can get into a lower squat. I haven't done the walking forms enough to have have a solid opinion yet.,1514851200,,289,4.087719298245614

8047515,4,B0007IJE1Q,Just tried it yesterday. Was at a retreat that we had a class in Qigong and know I will use it plus my gym and walking.,1478649600,,119,3.6153846153846154
