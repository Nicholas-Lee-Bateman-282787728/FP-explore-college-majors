2660217,4,B000ION762,"What a pleasant surprise. While the concept of a group of friends reuniting at a cabin in the woods for some R&R and, through various means, summoning something, isn't new in the horror genre, the execution of this version was actually quite good. Mainly because the writer didn't rely on the typical cliche (at least not overdone) for each character.

Most horror movies have the obligatory promiscuous, stoner, outsider, smart girl and nerd. But these actually seemed like a reasonable group of friends with pretty normal dialogue without being over-the-top. It was almost 40 minutes into the movie before you'd even know it was a horror movie. And even then it didn't have the eye-rolling, ridiculous decision-making at every turn. Of course, it's never a good idea to accept a dare to utter anything 3x in the mirror, but at least it wasn't a ouija board with ditzy participants.

I'm tempted to use the word ""subtle"" to describe how this built into a free-for-all horror movie. It was well done and the use of insecurities and jealousies between the characters was nicely handled.

Combine that with pretty competent acting by all and it was a nice little horror/thriller that for the most part kept you guessing throughout. Certainly worth a watch and one of the better executions, scripts and especially, dialogue I've seen in a while.",1485648000,7,1342,4.929203539823009

2660324,3,B000ION762,"Four couples spend a vacation at a cabin in the woods. While the girls sunbathe in bikinis, the men drink beer, smoke pot and (dead Canadian give-away) talk about ""the relationship."" It seems Matt and Kim (Dominique Swain) have broken up and are just going through the motions of being there. They had an open relationship and Matt cheated on Kim and didn't tell her. (Who writes this stuff?)

As the evening rolls around, the gang is still popping beers and the tension between Matt and Kim escalates. One girl, Lilly (Maggie Castle- B movie star), who is 22 and a little younger than the rest of the group (and new to the group) refrains from drinking Canada's finest. Suddenly Kim gets the idea to play a kids game called ""Dead Mary"" the Canadian version of ""Bloody Mary."" Each person takes a candle and goes into a dark bathroom and stands in front of the mirror with their eyes closed and says ""Dead Mary"" 3 times then opens their eyes. The poor lighting and power of suggestion and good imagination can make one think they see a dead witch for a fleeting moment.

As it turns out the spirit of Dead Mary is invoke and the night becomes very interesting as if it took a page out of the ""Book of the Dead."" When one in the group is killed, then comes back to life they suspect someone in the group is Dead Mary and they all arm themselves with makeshift weapons. The problem with the movie is that when it is supposed to pick up, it doesn't measure up to expectations.

Good horror for teens who are still young enough to play Dead Mary.

2660325,3,B000ION762,"It may too simplistic, but the suspense thriller Dead Mary (2007) as some have noted, plays out much like John Carpenter's The Thing, but set in the woods.  It starts out innocently as a kind of moody melodrama, but then becomes a violent tale of pseudo-supernatural terror, with some bold plot jumps that shows remarkable insight and ruthless determination.  Some spoilers ahead, so proceed as you will.

A group of seven twenty somethings gather at a cottage in the woods for a weekend of reminiscing and fun.  Life has had its ups and downs for them all, and there is much history and some current intrigue between some of them.  Lily (Maggie Castle) the girlfriend of Baker (Steve McCarthy) is the newcomer, and the group introduces her to the game called Dead Mary.  This involves looking into a mirror, and by candlelight, repeating the phrase ""Dead Mary"" three times, which supposedly will cause an evil spirit to appear.

Several in the group go through the ritual in the bathroom, and nothing noteworthy happens, but when Matt (Jefferson Brown) tries it, his candle is blown out and he finds drops of blood at the sink.  Later that night, Matt wanders out into the woods, where he is killed.  Lily discovers his body, and the rest of the group is there when the seemingly deteriorated corpse reanimates and grabs his ex-girlfriend Kim (Dominique Swain), and begins to regenerate.  With little hesitation, Kim beats Matt with a shovel, and then chops off his head.  When the body still shows signs of life, Dash (Michael Majeski) douses it with gas and sets it on fire.  Lily claims that she saw Eve (Marie Josee Colburn) with Matt, but no one believes her.  Lily is tied up and locked in a bathroom, and while Dash's wife Amber (Reagan Pasternak) watches the prisoner, the rest of the group try to figure out who else may be possessed by the evil that has been unleashed.

Much like Carpenter's The Thing, the survivors isolate those that are suspected, and keep watch on everyone else, just in case.  It is surprising how fast the group accepts Kim's decision to kill Matt, but seeing a corpse reanimate can apparently be very convincing.  For once in a horror film, there is almost no hesitation as the group seems to figure out almost immediately what they are up against, and quickly shifts into survive at all costs mode.  After this drastic turn, the film becomes a dark tale of distrust and suspicion, where old friends and even lovers can instantly turn on each other, and murder becomes very easy.

If you accept the huge leaps the film makes, then the paranoia and escalation of violence and torture that follows, may make some sense.  Otherwise, you may find it troubling that people seem to become disposable really fast.  The nature of the evil is not made clear, nor is the bleak fate that apparently awaits all mankind.  These are just some of the many questions that are left unanswered, as characters disappear then reappear in the final act.  The cast does what they can, with a script that turns them into ruthless killers, but it is pointless looking for rational answers, as Dead Mary is not a film that holds together very well.  Directed by Robert Wilson (The Warriors of Terra), the special effects are competently done, although almost everything occurs at night or in relatively poor lighting.  The lack of subtitles in this edition is a surprise.",1300838400,,3382,4.751712328767123
2660326,4,B000ION762,"Dead Mary is a pretty good horror movie, however it's not without its faults.

First of all, what sets this film apart from other ""slasher teen"" type films is that it combines psychological elements with lots of blood and killing, and it combines the two beautifully.

The storyline is that upon saying ""Dead Mary"" in a mirror 3 times in a row, a witch will come and turn everyone into destructive lunatics.

What I like about the way this film approaches its storyline -and something that easily makes it stand apart from other similar horror films- is that none of the teenagers seem to *like* each other very much.

So instead of witnessing teenagers doing all their normal typical things such as partying, drinking, smoking... in Dead Mary you see the teens not really communicating with each other on very good terms the entire time.  It makes the atmosphere unsettling and negative right from the very beginning.  A welcoming change compared to other movies in the same style where everyone appears happy and full of life which is totally unbelievable.

Now you never actually see a witch make an appearance- what happens is that the evil spirit of the witch appears inside the teens and turns them into relentless killing machines.  The amount of blood is high, and the violence is satisfying to a huge horror fan like myself.

The setting is wonderful too- it takes place inside a small cabin in the woods, and really all you ever see is the cabin, the woods, the lake, and a lengthy rainy segment near the end.  It's great.

Overall, a terrific and underappreciated movie.  The only fault is that sometimes there's a bit too much talking and not enough killing, but that's a very small and disposable complaint in comparison to the many things the film does correctly.",1288224000,,1777,4.752442996742671
2660327,4,B000ION762,"This movie is really weird (emphasis on ""REALLY""). But I think it was a pretty good and interesting little low-budget b-horror film. If you are the kind of person who doesn't really like scary, gory, low-budget, and slightly awkward horror movies, than you should get as far away from this as possible. But if you do like movies like this, than you should give it a try (sorry if I am not being specific enough)and maybe you'll like it. I know I liked it.

Whoever recorded the main song must have been a friend of the producer who was owed a favor. The music was boring, a perfect match for the rest of the movie. I would have given this movie 1/2 of a star, but this review doesn't allow for it.

2660359,1,B000ION762,"Late night is the best time for a horrific b masterpiece. Over the years the window in between 12:30 am til 4:00 am has been such a huge source of our reviewing materials by revealing the straight to video side of films. For about the past month, every Friday night around 1 am this fim Dead Mary comes on. After checking it out partially here and there it was finally time to sit through the film in its entirety. Just from the description explaining a group of friends are terrorized by a supernatural force they summon lets you know what to expect. This is the same description for about 500 other horror titles that are shown late night, but thats all part of b.

When pondering this film you may wonder, why the title ""Dead Mary"" instead of the well known tale of Bloody Mary? The one thing that came to mind was some type of copyright nonsense. Which turned out to be exactly the problem. The original screenplay was called Bloody Mary. The title was cleared in every territory except Japan, where the name Bloody Mary is copyrighted, and it was suggested that the title be changed to Dead Mary for release in that country alone. When the film's producers discovered that another film, also called Bloody Mary, was being readied for release around the same time, it was decided that the film's title be officially changed to Dead Mary in order to avoid confusion. But with a direct to video release does it even matter?

As we begin we are introduced to yet another group of d bags who are having a little reunion in the woods to reminisce of old times. So for once we don't have a group of high school kids getting killed in the woods. Instead we have older versions of high school idiots who are probably more irritating now then they were in high school. Go Dead Mary! They finally arrive at the cabin and not much of anything happens for the first half hour. There is a lot of dialog which amounts to absolutely nothing. It gets so boring you may even consider just shutting it down. As night rolls in they are hanging out having some drinks when one of the girls suggest they play Dead Mary. After she starts challenging the room they finally give in and one by one go into the bathroom. With only a lit candle they stand in front of the mirror with their eyes closed and repeat Dead Mary 3 times. This part actually was a bit creepy. The atmosphere was very dark and provided some element of horror, but nothing too amazing. The one kid has an odd experience as his candle goes out and turns the light on to find blood on the sink signifying Dead Mary is one the loose. See this was a disappointment. It would have been cool to see some old decrepit spirit come smahing through the mirror but we get nothing. Everyone now decides it's bed time and one guy continues to get loaded by himself in the living room where he eventually passes out. He awakes to some odd noises which for some reason make him run outside. Once outside he gets killed. The friends go running as his corpse begins speaking revealing secrets within the group of friends. So instead of a cool Dead Mary running around have people getting killed and possesed by her spirit which makes them come back only to reveal each other secrets. It's absurd. The rest of the film moves at the same pace with nothing to offer. It feels like you're watching more of a therapy session then an actual horror film. All thats revealed is this group of losers dirty laundry in a weak attempt to create some chills.

After the viewing you're going to wonder why this is a horror film. After some research we found out that the original script called for Dead Mary, when summoned by the chant, would rise from the lake and murder each character. Instead of that director Robert Wilson decided it would be much better if Dead Mary was never seen. She wuld just manifest herself in the characters causing them to spill the beans about their friends. He should have picked the first idea which would have been a far superior film. It's good to take an approach outside the whole slasher idea, but there has to be some element of horror to make it work. This one just came up short where the rapidly aproaching ending was all you're rooting for. Don't bother with this unless up very late with nothing better to do.",1221264000,4,4274,4.448979591836735
2660360,3,B000ION762,"An decent flick for the direct-to-video horror genre. There's a kind of a ""The Thing"" feel to this with a sprinking of ""Candyman"" which works (surprisingly) fairly well for the most part, even with the ambiguous ending. It allows for some suspense and a few genuine scares. Pretty good performances from the cast and excellent atmosphere make this watchable.",1208304000,2,358,5.084745762711864
2660361,5,B000ION762,"Starts off like a sleazy version of Dawson's Creek. We watch as Kim (Dominique Swain) and all her friends set up at a cabin for a long weekend. The first half hour of the film is spent getting to know the characters; right off the bat Kim and her boyfriend Matt are at odds (blah, blah, blah) and that sets the framework for some of the other drama that follows. Bottom line is they're all friends who have no problem with screwing each other over. Kind of illustrating the sort of blank existence I've seen associated with extreme stereotypes of Gen X-ers, cynical to the point of melodrama. However, I did find that it reinforced the feeling of seclusion and paranoia central to the theme of the movie and while slow paced in the beginning it kind of made up for it at the end.

The pace starts to pick up a bit when the group is hanging out having drinks and the conversation turns to Dead Mary. I was happy Kim at least referenced the Bloody Mary urban legend and acknowledged the variance giving the story a small touch of realism(tee hee). After a few of them go into the bathroom to inadvertently conjure a demon, which we later find, possesses or infects a person, then forces the possessed to kill thus spreading said possession or infection, the action ramps up a bit. Fade to black (Literally).

From here on out, I have to say, I loved this film. The subtlety throughout the story was notable; there was never that feeling of any danger until something happened and caught me off guard and also had me saying ""Wait a minute what just happened?"" This for me made the entire film very worthwhile. An added worthiness was the fact that the supernatural force stalking the group worked more like a spiritual possession / virus enabling the possessed / infected to see and share everyone's darkest secret at the other's expense. Also, the awesome thing about this is that you can literally mangle the person, watch them die, and then a few minutes later they regenerate all while spouting party fouls and faux-paus and this alone made up for the slow character build-up at the beginning of the movie for me. This element would not have worked nearly as well or been half as gratifying when we find out which character banged the other friend's significant other if the viewer had not had some insight into the characters lives and secretly wanted them to die just so they would stop talking.

This movie is definitely achieved cult status in my library. Dead Mary does a great job of building that feeling of seclusion, a common byproduct of paranoia. I'll admit going into this I wasn't really sure about it but I was so pleasantly surprised. There was a decent amount of gore, excellent pacing and some great one liners; ""Stop hitting my face with garden tools!!"" Ha! Buy, rent, or watch this film.",1201824000,10,2807,4.587649402390438
2660362,3,B000ION762,"You know what it's all about so I'll get to the point.  It's not so bad, the acting doesn't suck and it does have gore factor and scare.  I wasn't fascinated, but it held my attention.  I have definitely seen worse!",1201478400,,215,4.195121951219512
2660363,4,B000ION762,"""Dead Mary"" is a very good horror flick.  For those that liked the understated creepiness of ""Session 9,"" ""Dead Mary"" should work for you.  The acting is far above average for a horror flick, with each character/actor showing nuance and complexity as people rather than horror show types getting picked off as the movie goes on.  In short, the story is about a bunch of late twenty(or early thirty) somethings going for a reunion at a cabin in the wood.  But underneath the surface there's a bunch of sexual tension between partners - and former partners.  ""Friends"" this is not.  Too much drinking, pot, and barbed comments make for a sour stroll down memory lane.  Finally the campfire game ""Dead Mary,""is suggested, almost like a gauntlet being thrown down. Things get more frisky after the game, and as others have pointed out, Carpenter's ""The Thing"" comes readily to mind.  But there are other echoes.  Without tipping off the coming story, I noticed how the director, skillfully  signals some of these influences:  ""Blair Witch Project""(the too quiet woods, the cabin), ""The Exorcist"" (bumping on the roof), the grainy darkness and the half seen undead (the original ""Evil Dead"").  A few criticisms I did have: trouble  hearing some dialogue, which may just be due to watching it on cable; and trouble seeing what was going on at times - which could of been by design, given the general ""look"" of the movie.  I'm definitely interested in seeing other movies by the director, Robert Wilson.  He knows horror is all about establishing a sense of dread, and establishing it with real people - and in ""Dead Mary,"" he has succeeded.",1198454400,3,1634,4.8483754512635375
2660364,1,B000ION762,"I am a fan of Dominique Swain, otherwise, I would never have spent $4.65 to rent this movie. This movie does not focus on her, so the viewer is subjected to lots of not-so-bad yet boring acting/dialog. This struck me as a different version of ""Cabin Fever"" but with a crappier ending. I would only suggest this movie if one did not have to pay for it.

The ""making of"" feature was rather boring but you can tell that the actors somehow managed to feel rather passionate about their project. I had the thought that they might have been paid to feel so excited about their part in this monstrosity.",1197676800,,596,4.418181818181818

Anyways, this film is not exactly art, and I honestly have no idea who Swain is and I have not looked her up in IMDB, but I kinda liked the Actress who played the Character who eventually becomes Bloody Mary. And Whilst it is not a super high FX scare, it does work if you let it. I had a blast with it, and was quite happy with the purchase. I don't think that the teeth are as bad as some might make out... I would certainly get a fright with that set of choppers around me. I can't compare it to any of the high brow horror, but it works in its own little way to make a fun time for those seeking a peek beyond.
To my mind, it has a good set up, the FX pieces are appropriate but not too high tech: the scare FX owe more to certain genre films, but the basic point is watch it, I think you will get a good scare out of it, and have some fun as well.",1190073600,,1034,3.859154929577465
2660367,3,B000ION762,"You know when I saw the title I'm thinking ok....rehash of the bloody mary urban legend you know where you say bloody mary 3 times in the mirror and pray she don't show up and you go tits up! In fact they did make a movie called bloody mary.  And they even cover the urban legend in the first Season of Supernatural.  However even as the bloody mary legend is mentioned in this film, the scary original game of ""Dead Mary"" is borne.  Yeah Whatever! First this movie...all 103 minutes of it moves at slower than snail speed for the first half.  I felt like I was watching some twenty something drama about interpersonal relationships and trying to find out what happen to the glory days of high school and college life.  Reguardless things are already amiss at the beginning of this film from the opening sequence when Dominique Swan is waiting for her boyfriend to return with gas for broken down car. Even when he returns he mentions that there was no one at the gas station....anywhere.  Then theres the mysterious absence of the mutual friend  ""Ted"", who by the way never shows up anywhere in this movie.
As things progress....slowly, after all the key players are introduced we find them in the common room of the summer cabin(of coarse where else would they be? miles from anyone, with minimal gas, and no cell phone signal and no sign of anyone anywhere.) playing the game dead mary. 3 participate things progress with a couple of jumpy scenes(nothing to get yer panties in a twist over).  With some strange noises and a little paranoia the character ""Matt"" investigates noise in the woods.  Thats when the weird stuff happens.....mysterious death and his eventual supernatural ressurection/possession prompts the rest of the characters to do him in a second time. A shovel through the face and a quick burning make for some creepy scenes.  This film is not that gory, but some interesting shot angles and eerie lighting make for some uneasy viewing.
Now that the characters realize that the possession is jumping from infected person to infected person, but whose infected.  This question leads to one of the biggest plot device rip off I've seen in a while.  John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) with Kurt Russel. In that movie an alien Polymorphic doppelganger virus infects a science crew in the arctic, its up to McReady(Russel) and others to figure out ""whose the Thing?""  This is drawn out a little much in ""Dead Mary"" as everyone is jumping to paranoid conclusions about their own friends.
What I did like about this movie is that the plot was actually so much more than just a game of Dead Mary,  the possessed, when tortured and questioned hinted at world domination through armegeddon.  which answered some of the questions posed in this film, like Where the hell is ""Ted"", or the neighbors, or why wasn't there anyone at that gas station on the way up here.  It would be interesting to see a sequal to this movie, but their would have to be more action, more gore, and less relationship drama ca-ca! I gave this movie 1 star for the acting, and 2 others for the second half of the movie. If there was a bit more gore(something I kind of expected to see with an ""unrated"" tag on the box) would have prompted me to give it one more star.  Bottom Line:..............not bad, if you can wade through 51 minutes of boredom until the creepy stuff begins.",1188691200,3,3363,4.653716216216216
2660378,2,B000ION762,"Dead Mary (Robert Wilson, 2007)

This has the feel of an odd low-budget remake of Candyman with a stiff shot of Carpenter's The Thing tossed in for good measure. It should come as no surprise that it's not as good as either of those movies, but then, few movies are. I'm trying not to judge it based on any possible relation to those two films, and so I probably gave it more thought than it really deserve; it's an interesting concept, with better acting than the average no-budget horror flick, and there are some rather good points. In the end, though, while the good may balance out the bad, it doesn't really overcome it.

The worst thing about the movie is that, simply, it's all been done before, and better. Not just in the two movies mentioned above, of course; the idea of demonic possession predates the idea of film by centuries, and the Bloody Mary game probably does as well. Wilson (who also directed Warriors of Terra, though he's probably best known as a line producer for Metal: A Headbanger's Journey) tosses the two together, and then assembles the best thing about the movie: its cast. Dominique Swain (Lolita), Steven McCarthy (The Skulls), Maggie Castle (The Woods), Reagan Pasternak (Beautiful Girl), Jefferson Brown (Cake), Marie-Josee Colburn (Timeline), and newcomer Michael Majeski are not the cast one would expect in a straight-to-video shocker, but there you have it. There's some overacting during the demonic possession bits, but then, that's to be expected. The acting is almost good enough to allow the viewer to overlook the almost complete lack of plot, but not quite. What little plot there is is about as predictable as they come, especially once the blood starts flowing. The movie does try to redeem itself at the end, and comes relatively close to succeeding; the ending, were it tacked onto a stronger plot, would definitely be worth a whole lot of words in a review. As it is, though, it feels like a movie that's trying to make up for lost time. It does give me some confidence in Wilson's abilities, though, so I'll keep looking for his stuff as time goes on. ** ",1185926400,,2109,4.741144414168938
2660379,2,B000ION762,"If you can survive the excruciatingly boring first half hour of Dead Mary, you'll find a watchable horror movie.  If the plot were a road, you couldn't walk on it because of a limitless number of potholes, the whole thing doesn't really make much sense, and Dead Mary herself really has nothing to do with what happens, but you can't help but enjoy seeing very bad things happen to such whiny, annoying characters you've learned to hate with every fiber of your being.  If you were to take Candyman, Evil Dead, and Cabin Fever, mix them all up together, and extract most of the enjoyable essence that bubbles to the top, you'd have Dead Mary.  Actually, apart from the first half hour, I found Dead Mary even more enjoyable than Cabin Fever (but that's not saying much, as I found Cabin Fever extremely disappointing).

Apparently realizing that there have been plenty of movies already featuring a bunch of dumb kids ruing the day they played Candyman or Dead Mary or Dead whoever in front of the mirror, the filmmakers made the bold decision to assemble a group of thirty-somethings playing the same old scary parlor game.  Unfortunately, that doesn't happen until we've been forced to mix and mingle with these miserable human beings for far too long.  Let's just say this isn't the fun-loving reunion the characters expected it to be.  Matt (Jefferson Brown) and Kim (Dominique Swain) are in the middle of breaking up and thus are at each others' throats, the marriage of Dash (Michael Majeski) and Amber (Reagan Pasternak) seems to be based on mutual cheating, the loner Eve (Marie-Josee Colburn) is almost hot but just can't pull it off, and Baker's (Steven McCarthy) new girlfriend Lily (Maggie Castle) feels out of place because she doesn't know anyone.  The first half hour is devoted completely to general bitching and stories about who is screwing whom.  Then, finally, the Dead Mary gauntlet is laid down (you know, say ""Dead Mary"" three times in front of a mirror and you'll see her).

I was happy to see the character that annoyed me the most be the first to die; it's never all that clear how that person dies, but it happens in such a way to introduce some mutual suspicion among the others.  It's obviously not a normal death, as most dead people don't reanimate themselves and start telling everyone else's secrets.  Somehow, this is enough to convince the others that one of them could have the same deadly affliction (I'm going to call it Evil Dead-itis) but still appear normal - and that you can only catch whatever it is when you're alone.  The movie does succeed to some degree in keeping the viewer guessing as to whom the monster in disguise actually is, but the best thing it has to offer are some moderately gory scenes and the satisfaction you get from watching such miserable human beings meet such gruesome ends.

One character was smart enough not to even show up.  Throughout the really long weekend, everyone keeps waiting for this dude named Ted to arrive.  You would think the mystery of Ted's failure to appear would be an important plot point sooner or later.  Well, that kind of reasonable expectation is quite wasted on Dead Mary, a film that fails to explain quite a bit about itself.",1182643200,6,3225,4.720142602495543

The best and most effective part of the film was not the acting, or the effects.  It was when, late at night, they're bored, sitting around the cabin, drinking, and start talking about Dead Mary and decide to see if they can summon her, none actually believing they can do it.

2660382,3,B000ION762,"This is a fun little popcorn type horror flick that amused me for the hour and a half it took to watch it. Its not the grandest idea, although it was refreshing to see a spin off the standard slasher flick premise. And for a B-grade horror flick it did have a decent amount of character developement, not enough to make the characters truly likeable, but they did end up being a little above cookie cutter character A & B. And to tell the truth the added scenes of character developement did kind of make the movie drag a little bit more than the typical fast paced horror flick, but not bad enough to say it was yawn inducing.

So if you are bored one night, nothing to do and your a horror fan, this would be a decent rental. I don't think i would recommend a purchase, as I don't quite think this is worth repeat viewings.

And to those who are craving nudity and a bucket load of guts, look elsewhere cause this movie has neither. Although there are a few bloody scenes in it, this movie would not be out of place on a late night cable channel program like USA or TBS, (save for the F-bombs).",1176163200,5,1096,4.214285714285714
