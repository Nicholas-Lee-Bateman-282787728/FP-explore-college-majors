It depicts African American men and women training to go to war, and in various wartime posts on and off the battlefield.

I had really wanted to see this film because my Dad served in the Army during the war, fighting in Italy.

As ever, Capra knew how to inform, entertain and pull the heart-strings.  We can see the pride with which African Americans served their country.

Although I am sure it was an effective piece of propaganda, my Dad did not join up because of this or any other film.  He joined up in 1940, before the U.S. entered the war, because he didn't have a job.

Similarly, as Michael Moore said in<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bowling-for-Columbine/dp/B00008DDVV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bowling for Columbine</a>, the armed forces today recruit in poor neighbourhoods where unemployment is high.  Then they send people - many of whom are Black - to places like Iraq and Afghanistan as cannon fodder.",1306540800,,1441,6.622340425531915
