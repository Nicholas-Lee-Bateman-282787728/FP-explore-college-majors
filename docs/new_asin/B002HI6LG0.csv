The plot is simple straightforward yet entertaining. Overall, the movie was really good....SANKAT CITY is a small little gem that deserves a watch.",1300838400,,293,5.125
8370387,4,B002HI6LG0,"Kay Kay Menon is Guru a small time con artist who makes his living stealing cars and then selling them after changing their license plates and paint with the help of Dilip Prabhavalkar as Ganpat. One day he steals a Mercedes and finds that  it contains one crore rupees but t he does not know that the car and the money belong to dreaded gangster Faujdar ( Anupam Kher) So he has to return the money but the person who has hidden the money i.e. Dilip Prabhavalkar has lost his memory. There are many subplots, characters, situations and twists in the storyline to give you a short synopsis apt but the end result is loads of fun. The movie borrows from many cliches that have plagued Indian Cinema like lost and found treasures, the long lost brother formula and the eternal amnesiac syndrome these are the themes that abound in this fun filled movie. The movie marks the debut of another director Pankaj Advani who instantly in my eyes becomes a director to watch out for. Cinematography is splendid as Mumbai has been captured in all its gritty glory. Some scenes stand out, the scene at the garbage dump at the end, the Gay swami and his meeting with faujdar's driver. If you liked Victoria No 203, Hungama, Ek Chalis Ki Last Local and Johnny Gaddar, you will love this sankat. 4 stars 1/7/10",1265587200,,1295,4.534188034188034
