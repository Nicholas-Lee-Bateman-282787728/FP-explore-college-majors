7869459,2,6304369190,"From the gratuitous and pointless violence that did nothing to drive the plot, to the terrible acting and cheesy lines spoken by the characters, I am confounded as to why this movie is a cult classic. I have a pile of dog rubbish in my backyard. Why aren't people gathering around it and applauding it as well?",1455580800,,310,4.456140350877193

7869463,1,6304369190,"I remember watching this show when it aired on TV in the early 90s.

I was watching this DVD and noticed most of the comedy parts where cut out especially the First episode when Melvin fell into the toxic waste, He first turned into a school teacher then a movie producer then a hideously Deformed creature of Super Human size and strength.the part with the teacher and movie producer were cut. The second episode featured a really funny magoop 83 bubblegum song that was cut from the last part of this episode. the subtitles are cruddy cause they're green and very hard to read since there was no black out line plus there were 5 episodes not 4 So don't waste your money on this cheap DVD cause it's a waste of time.",1165449600,,717,4.390977443609023
7869464,4,6304369190,I just finished watching this and it was pretty radical. It's so funny that they made a Saturday morning cartoon based on a Troma movie. I love the animation in these old shows. It is far superior than the horrible animation on the cartoons today. The characters are real cool but the plot kept on repeating it self. The bad guy would come up with a way to destroy Tromaville and then his plans would be foiled. But it was totally awsome nevert the less. I f you like cartoons from the 80's and early 90s you should buy this.,1140739200,2,525,4.26
7869465,4,6304369190,"I remember the Toxic Crusaders cartoon from when I was a kid, and to say using Troma's Toxic Avenger license for a kids cartoon raises a few eyebrows is saying it lightly.  Toxie is here, tu-tu and all, in all his animated glory as we see a young geek become a mutated hero of ""super size and strength"", and he is soon joined by a few allies as well as he takes on evil henchmen who are bent of polluting the planet.  It's not Shakespeare, but it's a worthwhile buy for a nostalgia trip, and parents today could even pick it up for their kids (just don't pick up the Toxic Avenger movies, they are definitely not for kids).  The animation is typical early 90's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles-ish style, with plenty of nice shots and artwork.  All in all, those who remember the Toxic Crusaders will definitely want to pick this up.",1107820800,4,829,4.398692810457517
