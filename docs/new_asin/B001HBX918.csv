3629287,5,B001HBX918,"I bought this production of the Nutcracker because my three year-old was still begging to go back and see Clara two months after we'd seen a local production at Christmas.  She adores it and watches it every day.  It is just the right length for little ones and adults can appreciate the quality of the dancing, set, costumes, and choreography.  I especially like the touch of San Francisco the director added.  I highly recommend it.",1236556800,2,434,4.746666666666667
3629288,1,B001HBX918,"Frankly speaking, this DVD is a disaster. Sorry to say, but film director Matthew Diamond and his cameramen explicitly ruin the show.
You can see the whole stage for only a few seconds in every scene. You see the whole stage, and say ""wow, what a wonderful decoration, oops.."", then the camera zooms in, you see the smiling faces of dancers. Not their feet, not their body, but their faces. I can say that, Chinese snow queen is a beautiful woman, but I could not appreciate her dance. I'm not exaggerating, camera does not stand still more than 3 seconds. When 3 seconds pass, camera moves, or zooms in, after an additional 2 seconds, then another camera is in action. What a technology!?
I saw many choreograhies of Nutcracker, I think this was a very good one, good dancers, good orchestra, but extremely disappointing film. Not worth buying.",1236297600,79,845,4.716216216216216
3629289,1,B001HBX918,"This performance could have been one of the most pleasant of Nutcracker performances available on DVD, if we could see the dance as it was choreographed and performed on the stage.  But we see only bits and pieces of the dance shown through endless camera close ups.

During the entire dance we don't see the stage for more than 10 seconds at a time.  What we see is close ups of faces, medium shots of one or two dancers in a small area of the stage, the panning of the camera to move along with the dancers from one side of the stage to the other and so on.  We get a constant barrage of zoom in, zoom out, pan and scan.  At some points if you are not suffering from motion sickness and frustration to the point of closing your eyes, you will notice that while the camera is panning you actually end up seeing blurry images of the dancers.  So we get to watch the camera do its thing while the dancers do the dance on the stage that we don't get to see because they are not shown.

I don't know about anyone else but I don't watch a ballet for the smiling faces of the dancers.  Furthermore, I'd like to let my own eyes do the panning and scanning of a ballet performance on the stage.",1231459200,70,1187,4.130434782608695
3629290,5,B001HBX918,"This is by far the best performance of the Nutcracker I've seen, live or recorded.  The fresh setting (both time --1915, and location--San Francisco), as well as the beautiful costumes and the fabulous twist on the pas de deux make it a pleasure to watch.  The use of the World's Fair Pavilion as a backdrop for Act 2 is also a fun change.

This production is more child-friendly than many others, because it lacks the creepy persona that Drosselmeier is often given.  There is also a more playful nature to many of the dances (the Chinese dance with the dragon comes to mind) which children love.

Helgi Tomasson should be commended for choreographing an old standard in a new way that makes it exciting to both new viewers and those who have seen the ballet many times before.",1230854400,5,778,4.608695652173913
3629291,5,B001HBX918,"Having seen Nutcracker in several productions, I can say that this one is incredibly beautiful, from the colors, to the coreography. First act is charming with a party scene with little boys and gilrs. My daughter favorite are Clara's friends, expecially the smaller one with the yellow dress. The snow scene is a classical beauty with great snow and lights effects. The second act starts with a scene that reminds me of Midnight Summer Dreams, flowers and dragonflies and cute small ladybugs dancing with the Sugar Plum Fairy. This scene is best appreciated from a distance as the coreography creates circle of flowers that open and close in delicate shades of yellow and orange.  The Russian Dance is also one of my favorite. Madame De Cirque and her buffons are as cute as ever. A well deserved applause to these little dancers.",1230249600,5,831,4.852112676056338
3629292,5,B001HBX918,"I was actually present at one of the taping sessions for this magnificent ballet.  One year later, it is a joy to watch it over again.  This is a visual feast.  The dancing is beyond compare and the musical score magnificent!",1229904000,6,225,4.439024390243903
3629293,5,B001HBX918,"This is a spectacular performance of the Nutcracker with lots of little twists on the traditional dances. My parents who are classical music, ballet and opera lovers said it's the best Nutcracker they've ever seen. The dancing is marvelous, and the costumes are elegant and beautiful, set in the period during the San Francisco 1915 world's fair. If this is not the best Nutcracker, then it's got to be in the top two or three. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this DVD.",1229558400,40,479,4.714285714285714
3629294,5,B001HBX918,"We purchased this to prepare our two sons to see a local live production of the Nutcracker. We love it! The quality of the production is just beautiful, especially in HD. It makes explaining the story to children  much easier. (There is also a synopsis on the DVD, which is very helpful) This production includes the applause of the audience, which helps to make it feel like a real performance and not a silent stage set. It is a bright, lively performance.

The DVD is organized in chapters, which makes it easy to navigate from scene to scene. Our four year old has asked to watch it again three nights in a row, and we can easily skip from one favorite part to another. (Right now, he likes the Children's March and the battle scene the best.) My favorite is the Snow scene, which is absolutely gorgeous.

The storyline doesn't stray too far from the familiar tale, but there are some interesting twists. Drosselmeyer is mysterious, but not scary, and we enjoyed watching the opening bit in his clock shop. The stage magic is entertaining and fun. The young Clara transforms into an older version of herself in Act 2. There are some fun surprises in Act 2, with little twists on the usual dances. Even the Arabian dance, usually my least favorite, is fun to watch.

Whether you are looking for a first Nutcracker, or you want to add to a collection, this is a great performance to buy. (Parents and teachers: The San Francisco Ballet has a wonderful teaching guide on their website, with additional background and activities.)",1229472000,74,1530,4.655555555555556

The physical mounting's sumptuous, witty, and the San Francisco references seem playful, not forced.  There are moments of such stunning beauty in this performance, the music, design, dance and storytelling combine to transport the viewer instantly to a happy, marvelling state of childhood.  Would serve as an ideal introduction to the NUTCRACKER for young viewers, and there's plenty for their parents to enjoy, too.  Highly, highly recommended.",1229299200,57,556,5.430232558139535

3629333,4,B001HBX918,"This is a beautiful version of The Nutcracker. While it's not my favorite (my absolute favorite is Baryshnikov's 1979 production), it is one of the very best productions, in my opinion. This is not as traditional as some Nutcrackers (such as New York City Ballet's version), but rather a magical and unique take on the perennial holiday classic. The time and location have been shifted from 19th century Germany to 1915 San Francisco. The first act takes place in a Victorian ""painted lady"" mansion; the second act, traditionally set in The Kingdom of Sweets, instead takes place in a pavilion at the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition. I usually enjoy the second act more than the first, but in this case, the second act felt a little rushed to me, and as some other reviewers have noted, some of the costumes are surprisingly drab and/or uninspired. Nonetheless, this is a rich production. The ""Waltz of the Snowflakes"" is a must-see. It's simply spectacular--the best I have ever seen.

The bonus features are also worth watching. Helgi Tomasson (choreographer, artistic director), Michael Yeargan (scenic designer) and Martin Pakledinaz (costume designer) discuss their roles in creating the production. There's also a mini-documentary of the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exhibition. Unfortunately, none of the dancers were interviewed. I think it would have been nice to hear how they had prepared for their roles. Among the dancers, a young Elizabeth Powell, just 15 when she filmed the part of Clara, Damian Smith as Uncle Drosselmeyer and Davit Karapetyan as the Nutcracker Prince really stood out for me--but the entire cast is sublime. I love this production and don't really understand some of the negative reviews. I could watch this over and over again--at any time of the year--and never grow tired of it.",1415059200,,1834,5.133779264214047

3629416,4,B001HBX918,I had seen this program on PBS and enjoyed that experience. This Bluray has a lot of added information about San Francisco back in the early 20th century. The Christmas Party is set in a San Francisco town house around 1915 rather than in a Russian mansion. The ballet dancers and music quality are very good. Loved the Rat King section.

However I felt a let down in some area:
There is no chorus in waltz of the flowers, too sad. The beautiful chorus is one of my favorite in that scene.
The main characters seem to more focus on technical excellence, while less on emotion.
The final Pas de deux isn't that exciting, Elizabeth Powell's dance is fine but not exceptional.

Overall it's not as good as the Bolshoi version (danced by amazing Nina Kaptsova and Artem Ovcharenko), the set, dance and orchestra are close to perfection.",1355011200,5,812,4.517006802721088

I immediately ordered two copies - one for myself and one for my granddaughter, who is a professionaly trained ballet/contemporary dancer.  The presentation is beautifully staged, and danced, to highlight all the wonderful aspects of this traditional Holiday favorite.  The original story line of The Nutcracer is faithfully followed, and the costumes of the actors and dancers are extremely rich in detail. The addition of this truly sensational video to my library will furnish great entertainment to me and my family for years to come - even non-holiday times!

I would highly recommend this presentation to all ages - it should certainly have a universal appeal to all!!!",1350518400,,774,5.168
3629423,4,B001HBX918,"This is a fine alternative to the more traditional productions such as that seen in recent years at Covent Garden (Royal Ballet).

I would not describe this as a lavish production in the manner of staging such as at the Kirov, the Dutch Ballet or the Royal Ballet but it is freshly appealing with an essentially kind approach to Clara. The concept of this production was to set in in San Francisco at the time of the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition with the intention to make the ballet more relevant to American audiences than the usual earlier period European settings normally seen.

In reality there is little to choose between the first act as seen here and the more traditional settings as the story and characterisations are practically identical. The main differences at this stage simply lie in the period costuming and more modern dwelling which make for a pleasant and interesting alternative. The waltz of the snowflakes is a particularly attractive link to the second act and that is where this production is radically different to others. However, the second act is radically different with the complete rejection of the usual fairy tale settings usually seen and their replacement with a pavilion setting intended to represent an area of the Exposition and as dreamed by Clara.

The delights of the second act are centred on the new choreography, the related traditional dancing skills and an interesting new and imaginative take on the set dances in Act 2. I found the Arabian Dance particularly attractive - and very different to usual. The Spanish Dance is also effective and the Chinese Dance makes imaginative use of a Chinese dragon characterisation. The Russian Dance is rather more basic though despite enthusiastic applause from the audience. The use of ribbons in the Mirlitons also lacks the sheer imagination of Frederick Ashton's use of ribbons in his La Fille Mal Gardee for example. The Madame du Cirque plus dancing bear makes for an interesting extra item. The whole of the second act produces a clear 'feel good' factor for the audience and the dancing is of a good standard. Where this production falls short in my opinion is in the extremely sparse setting of the pavilion with no attempt to fill in the large flat wall space between the floor and the ceiling. This would have been so much more effective if any attempt at 3D has been included. The absence of onlooking dancers/audience also contributes to a very sterile atmosphere which lasks character interaction throughout this act in my opinion. Interaction would surely have been a major factor in the original Exposition and is sadly omitted here.

The production is well recorded in the Opus Arte manner with crisp and clear imaging without movement blur and with full-ranging surround and stereo sound options.  There is an informative booklet which fully explains the ideas behind this concept and this is supported by interviews in the form of 'bonus' material which also deals with the 1915 World's Fair. There is also an illustrated synopsis.

I would expect this essentially enjoyable version to give considerable pleasure to, and be highly recommended for, those who fancy a tasteful change from the usual choreography. For my own taste, I feel that the second act setting is too Spartan for total involvement and those who enjoy more opulent settings with more character interaction at that point are likely to feel the lack of it. The costumes throughout are attractive as is the dancing. Overall therefore, I feel that this is more of a 4 star rather than a 5 star disc but much will depend on individual views as regards the pavilion setting in act 2 as described above. I would buy this as an interesting and enjoyable supplementary version rather than as my only version but that is very much a matter of personal taste.",1342742400,8,3840,4.91820987654321

There are no dead spots; it keeps your attention, beginning to end.  The orchestra is superb, the dancing is first-rate, the sets are beautiful.  I've loved this music for most of my life, and stumbling onto this particular production was one of the happiest discoveries, and best Christmas gifts, of my life.

3629435,2,B001HBX918,"Helgi Tomasson, though presenting some additions of clever themes, botches an already over-done and clich-ridden Nutcracker. This contemporary re-telling of the story is set in San Francisco during the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition. The first act is laden with high fashions of the time and beautiful sets. Notable performances in the first act include a jack-in-the-box and a ballerina doll, though notable for the dancers themselves, not the choreography. The Nutcracker doll itself is hilariously frightening, with bizarre blue eyes, and electroshocked red hair. It's also odd that, what with such a big company and huge school, the stage looks somewhat bare with just 6 couples of children and relatively few adults. Clara, the 13-year old lead, danced by Elizabeth Powell is already so much taller than the rest of the company, and has so much make-up on that she looks as if she's 20, at the least. Opposite her, Damian Smith performs an eccentric and original Drosselmeyer. The fight scene is done very well, the costumes and sets look fantastic here, and the mousetrap (instead of the shoe being what kills the Mouse King) is a clever addition. However, once snow begins, the production begins to fall apart. Yuan Yuan Tan, a beautiful dancer, shines as the Snow Queen, though it's difficult to actually even see her role due to the constant camera changes, specifically displaying her lovely face. The choreography for the corps de ballet in the snow scene is disastrous, though it looks slightly more acceptable what with gallons of fake snow drowning it out.

The second act, now set in a surreal idealized world, with minimalist sets based on a famous building from the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition, keeps the standard falling. The very beginning, where the Nutcracker Prince describes his perils to the Sugar Plum Fairy is over-done with bravura tricks, which have no place in this part of the ballet. The character dances, for the most part, are choreographically decent. The Arabian is pretty, but dull. The Russians do have a clever theme to them, bursting out of golden eggs. Also, the (traditionally) gingerbread mother (or Jokers/Fools in some Russian versions) is instead a 'carnival' mother, showing off dozens of children and a circus bear; which is something new, unexpected, and very cute. Chinese, Mirlitons, and Spanish are aesthetically pleasing and very well danced. The Waltz of the Flowers is disastrous. The choreography is unexciting and completely anticlimactic, and the costumes tacky. It is also evident that here (and in the Waltz of the Snowflakes), some of the corps de ballet dancers are blatantly overweight, and shouldn't be dancing these classical roles, when present times call for a certain look (which is longer and thinner).Then, the jewel of the second act, the famous grand pas de deux, is massacred. Though the Nutcracker Prince (Davit Karapetyan) and Grand Pas de Deux Ballerina (Maria Kochetkova) are technically very proficient and beautiful, there is nothing in the choreography that suits the story, it might as well have been any array of classical movements. The pas de deux is very anticlimactic as well, and proves a huge disappointment. Finally, Clara wakes up, and the ballet is over.

Though the dancers themselves are technically proficient and beautiful (when not looking too directly at some of the overweight corps de ballet), the choreography is bland and unexciting. The costumes are elegant (for the most part), and the sets (especially in the first act) are very aesthetically pleasing. Helgi Tomasson brings forth some clever and exciting new themes to this San Franciscan retelling of the classic story, though his choreography ruins it. I'd recommend a different Nutcracker to ballet fans, either the Kirov Ballet's version (1994 with Larissa Lezhnina, in Petipa/Vainonen's version), or the Bolshoi Ballet's version (1987 with Yekaterina Maximova and Vladimir Vasiliev, in Grigorovich's version). However, to devout fans of San Francisco Ballet or those completely in love with the Nutcracker, this would be an edition to own, but mostly just for the new, clever themes presented by Tomasson.",1326240000,5,4195,5.241071428571429

Staging, Performance and HD video and sound were all awarded ""A"" ratings, with several members saying it ""reminded them of their childhood"". In particular, two members who had seen over half a dozen productions either live or recorded in France, the UK and the US) said that this one outshone them all for its originality and grace! The enthusiasm is quite obvious in this ""Video Crit"" which can also be seen on the ""Operadou Archives"" page devoted to this production. Heartily recommended for ballet connoisseurs and newcomers to the genre.

3629438,5,B001HBX918,This is a really good Nutcracker version to watch with the kids. My 2.2 year old daughter loves this DVD. The costumes are beautiful.,1295308800,,133,4.583333333333333
3629439,4,B001HBX918,"This staging by the San Francisco Ballet has a lot going for it. The turn-of-the-century setting is perfectly executed. Dancing and mime are top-notch throughout. The costumes are exquisite; check out the range of antique pastels used during the party scene.

The Christmas tree transition is really magical. Unlike many productions, this staging makes it clear that it's not the tree that is growing, but Clara who is shrinking down to a few inches high. The Mouse King is deliciously nasty-looking and melodramatic.

The ""Dance of the Snowflakes"" is particularly lovely, especially near the end, when the stage crew creates a near-blizzard of paper snow, dazzling to watch in high definition.

Unfortunately, the camera work is quite obtrusive. The credits list nine camera operators, and the video director was apparently determined to employ every one of them as often as possible. The result is a frantic sequence of closeups, pans, zooms and cross-cuts, with a new angle appearing every few seconds. In some numbers, the cuts actually occur on each bar of music, a cheesy effect that quickly becomes wearisome. The entire stage is rarely shown, and then only for a few moments. During the Act 1 party scene, the editing is so fast and furious, I never got a complete sense of what the set looked like. Things calm down a bit for Act 2, perhaps because the poor camerapeople were exhausted.

The set in Act 2 is disappointingly bland. I think it's supposed to represent the dome of the Palace of Fine Arts, but it seems rather dreary and industrial.

The score is well-played and recorded, although the percussion section sounds a bit distant compared to the rest of the orchestra.

A good disc overall, despite the caffeinated cameras. I would love to see this production performed live!",1293235200,24,1793,4.96

3629441,5,B001HBX918,"I've seen Nutcracker productions from the Royal Ballet, Kirov Ballet (live), ABT (the Barishnykov one), Bolshoi Ballet, and the previous (to this one) San Francisco Ballet production.  This newest production from San Francisco Ballet beats them all, hands down!  The update of the setting to 1915 San Francisco works well and doesn't intrude on the story.  There are a few twists and ""oh, that's what that's about"" moments but they are pleasant and charming.  Right from the rising of the curtain, the characters are well-defined by the dancers, with each one dedicated to not just half-heatedly play his/her role. I'm sorry but I don't remember the names of the soloists but they are all superb with special kudos to the king and queen of snow and their leading of the most joyous snow scene I have ever seen.  The corps is tight (especially in the snow scene) and their steps are in as near perfect unison as you can get.  I've watched many times and am always amazed at the precision.  The party is fun and has great little touches of children occasionally interacting with their ""parents"" (showing presents, shying away from Drosselmeyer, etc.).  Watch for the little girl asleep in the chair as the guests start to leave.  The mime is clear and the story is easy to follow.  There is a thorough synopsis on the disc that can be read before viewing, too.  The second act is well done and Helgi Thomason has done a great job removing the stereotype choreography you normally see (especially in the Arabian and Chinese dances).  The sets and costumes are sumptuous and there's quite a snow storm going on at the end of act 1.  The orchestra plays tightly and obviously knows all the nuances of this score.  They are well conducted and the tempos are close to those called for in the score (see my review of the Gergiev/Kirov CD for a more in-depth explanation). The sound and picture quality are excellent and the director for this video did an excellent job with it.  There are extras on the disc about the design of the production and the 1915 International Exebition that are very interesting.  This DVD is well worth having and will not disappoint you.",1287532800,6,2158,4.714666666666667

One personal note for impressionable younger viewers: the role of Uncle Drosselmeyer is conceived as a threatening, morbid character and detracts from the magic of the ballet and story.",1265155200,5,421,4.702702702702703

Set in SF in the early 1900's, it is definitely on the more playful side which keeps the attention of my little ones.  The lighting is brilliant, costumes and background absolutely stunning, and the dancing is captivating.  As a parent, I appreciate the fact that my girls are learning to appreciate art both in dance and music.  Having seen 3 live performances, this DVD by far has held our attention and kept even the smallest ones entranced.

3629474,5,B001HBX918,"I Agree to a certain extent with those who felt there were too many close-ups. However, I believe the ensemble dancing was well covered with long shots as were most of the solos, pas-de-deuxs, etc. In addition to the ballet, there are extras on the blu-ray version (which I am reviewing) and, I assume, on the standard DVD, including the wonderful short documentary of the 1915 World's Fair which inspired the lovely production design and choreography by Helgi Tommason and others. The performance on this disc was in 2007.

It is unfortunate that the Blu-ray recording is not available in the U.S. I ordered my copy from a private vendor in the U.K. through Amazon.com United Kingdom. The audio is recorded in PCM 5.0 and is very good with a wide dynamic range. The price for the imported Blu-ray disc is a little ""stiff,"" but if you want the best ""Nutcracker"" available in high def, you might find it worth it. It is far superior to the ugly Marinsky production (also from Opus Arte) and more suitable for children. So far, foreign imports I have bought on Blu-ray have not been regionally encoded and, therefore, you will have no trouble playing this disc on any Blu-ray capable component. If you wait, it may be offered in this country at a somewhat lower price, but I see no indication that this Blu-ray HD recording will be available here in the near future.",1257033600,5,1364,4.659751037344399
