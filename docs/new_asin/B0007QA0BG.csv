8050445,2,B0007QA0BG,"For _regular_ swimmers trying to improve this may help a lot.
But if you want to learn butterfly from scratch forget about it.
The DVD is centered on 6 basic points of the butterfly stroke where most swimmers have problems and there is excellent footage of Misty swimming and there are detailed instruction on how to get each point right. For some odd reason the footage of people doing mistakes depicts children ages between 5 or 11. I guess the assumption is that adults' swim is flawless? The cover says ""includes laminated drill guide"", this is very _misleading_ advertising. First because they are not drills, they are the 6 points that Misty goes over, seriously the laminate has only six sentences which are of things like: ""two kicks per stroke"", ""think like a dolphin"", etc... No specific drills, no number of repetitions, etc... Also the price is insane! The DVD is too short, less than one hour. I imagine that it is too expensive because only swim clubs/departments or the occasional ""duped"" like me buy it?",1250380800,2,1019,4.795454545454546
8050446,5,B0007QA0BG,"Its pretty good video, and she knows what she is talking about when it has to do with butterfly. I learned alot from this video.",1159574400,,128,4.16
8050447,5,B0007QA0BG,"I actually learnt a lot from this dvd. I had been trying to swim butterfly for two months before buying this, and watching misty suddenly put things in place. Suddenly after watching the dvd, I understood the 2 kickd per stroke secret of setting up a rhythm in butterfly. The specific position of the arms, at the point of the kicks was a great learning. There are a few drills through the course of the dvd.. overall it worked for me and i have watched and re-watched the dvd many times..",1156723200,3,489,4.384615384615385
8050448,3,B0007QA0BG,"It's basically only 30 minutes of Misty swimming butterfly filmed from the all possible angles and in slow motion too.

Divided in 6 chapters/tips which she considers the most important and which she demonstrates.

It could be easily added another 26 tips that still wouldn't work for everyone.

No drills, no turns/starts/finishes, no gradual building of technique, nothing - just Misty swimming ( what's the most amazing, in case this is her personal promo, ""The Race"" on Olympics is not included! )

She swims very nice, but you can see almost all on the promo clip on goswim.tv and 40$ can be spent more effectively",1133308800,23,619,4.866666666666666
