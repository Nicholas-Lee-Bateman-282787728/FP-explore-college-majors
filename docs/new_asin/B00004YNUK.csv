These are the guys who have dreams of being the baddest guy on the planet and want to fight in the UFC to prove it. Most are new faces who've been training for the last 4 or 5 years in both striking and grappling, but some are losers from the UFC who have added another dimension to their training hoping to redeem themselves and make it back to the big time of Mixed Martial Arts events. A couple of the stand out fighters in this event are John Matua and Ricco Rodriguez. John Matua is the 400 pound guy who got KO'd by Tank Abbot a few seconds into their UFC fight, making Tank an instant UFC legend. Ricco Rodriguez will probablly be the next Mixed Martial Arts superstar. He has a combination of Hollywood actor good looks with skills and athletisism to rival any of the best Mixed Martial Artists.
