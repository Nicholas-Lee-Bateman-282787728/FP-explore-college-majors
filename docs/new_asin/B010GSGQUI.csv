7310997,5,B010GSGQUI,"This is one of those films that surpass your expectations. Yes, it functions as a biography of sorts for one of the comedy greats of the 20th Century  Irwin Corey  but it is so much more. In many ways it is an oral history of the counterculture in the US in the '50s, 60's, '70s and beyond. Irwin was always there, on the money whether the issue of the day was commies under the bed, reefer madness, never-ending war and all the other foibles of post-WW2 America. Irwin knew everybody from Victor Lowndes to Hugh Hefner and was directly or indirectly responsible for the launching of many a comedy career, including Dick Gregory's, as the latter states himself in the film.

Through it all, Irwin's wife Fran was at his side and the film is also a loving tribute to their enduring relationship. Family friends Susan Sarandon (narrator) and Jordan Stone (director) deliver a classic. Highly Recommended.",1442275200,3,902,4.732484076433121
7310998,4,B010GSGQUI,"Note: This review is based on the DVD release. I received a review copy in exchange for an objective review.

Unless you are over 60 years old (maybe even older) the name Prof. Irwin Corey probably means nothing to you. Except for one brief visit to David Lettermans show in the 1980s the comedian best known as The Worlds Foremost Authority has been out of the limelight since the 1960s  when he was a staple on TV variety shows and in nightclubs like the Playboy Club and The Hungry i. Im old enough to remember him and I looked forward to learning more about his early life by watching this film. But during the 83 minutes (which dragged a lot for me) I learned a lot less than I hoped for. Part of this is the fault of the director Jordan Stone. The scenes consist of four types (a few repeated a bit too often for me). First there is Corey (who was 95 at the time of most of the interviews) and his wife of 73 years, Fran, sitting at their kitchen table in the Murray Hill section of New York City. Its the only time we see Fran and she barely says a word except to complain to Irwin.  Next we see Corey on his paper route in the neighborhood. Yes, he piles a variety of New York dailies on his walker and heads out to sell them (half price today; only a quarter). This was neat at the beginning but we see virtually the same scene three times throughout the film. The third type of scene is an extended interview with comedian Dick Gregory (filmed in a Washington, DC studio). (You find out what the main connection is between the two but I won't reveal it here.  The fourth type is where the film works best. Stone has licensed archival footage of Corey in his TV appearances and we see how funny Corey can be. (Of course you have to enjoy a double-talk artist to like this, but that was his specialty.

We do learn early on that Corey was a welterweight boxer in his youth and that he got his first Broadway break in the play Pins and Needles a revue about the pro-labor movement. And in the 1950s Corey was blacklisted  though he never went before the McCarthy commission. But the time spent on these topics is fairly short and we are back to long stretches of Corey at the table, Fran saying she needed to go to the toilet and watching Corey deliver papers again!  Personally I would like to have heard about and known more about his early life and work before the nightclubs. Yes, his mind was still active (and he was able to use his cell phone with no issues) at 95 and the film goes up to a revisit with him two years after Fran died and he was approaching 100. (He is still alive and making appearances with screenings of this film at age 101!)

The film is narrated by his friend and fan actress Susan Sarandon but that narration is kept to a minimum. Mostly we hear from Corey himself with Gregorys comments inserted later. Both comment on their friend Lenny Bruce (another regular at the Playboy Clubs and venues in Greenwich Village and San Francisco.

There are 13 minutes of bonuses on the DVD. First comes a 7 minute outtake of the Dick Gregory Interview. And then there is Coreys portion of the Friars Club Roast marking his 100th birthday.

I was really tempted to give this a three star rating (Its Okay) and but the archival footage and hearing some of his stories about the blacklist bring it up to 3  stars for me. Since that doesnt exit Ill round it up to four stars. I did Like much of it. I just wish that Stone had edited a bit more and added at least 30 minutes about Coreys growing up and early like and even more about his boxing years.  Be prepared to laugh at a few points but the older Corey is smart here, just not that funny. And be prepared for a good deal if expletives too.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7310999,5,B010GSGQUI,"I caught this at the NY premier where luckily Professor Corey was also in attendance. Following the film he did a Q&A and a bit of a performance as well. Filmmaker Jordan Stone was also in attendance and related some of the back story on the 'making of'.  It was truly inspiring as is the film.

Irwin & Fran is not your typical biography by any means. It opens with a dialogue by Irwin as the beginning credits start to roll. The man is a comic genius as he instructs an introducer on how to introduce him. Laaaaaadeeeees and Gennnnntlemennnnnn... You know you're in for an insightful film before it even starts.

Stone has created an art film biography about a man who tells his story without ever telling his story. Irwin does it for you through his logic, memories and current comedy. Amazingly Professor Corey has never gone out of date. His observations on life are far from stale and his retrospect is very much 'on it'. Needless to say, Corey was funny. He remains so... and is very much still at the top of his game.

You're brought into Corey's life with his wife Fran at his side. NYC (where he still resides) serves as a backdrop. At the age of nearly 100 during the filming, and now 101, Corey remains a seller of newspapers (the opening scene is one of the most charming I've ever seen), and a major social thinker. You're taking through his blacklist years and his 1960 run for the presidency on Hugh Hefner's Playboy ticket. And, for incredible color commentary, Stone was lucky enough, and talented enough, to find activist, comedian Dick Gregory who lends wonderful insight into Corey while also relating incredible history about and insight into a man that Lenny Bruce called ""genius"".

Irwin & Fran is a uniquely filmed portrait of one of comedy's greatest legends. From his appearances on Jack Paar, Johnny Carson, Ed Sullivan, Andy Griffith and almost every other major TV talk show, the film is a bulls-eye for comedy fans, but importantly it is also a socially relevant portrayal on aging.

I can't recommend this more than by saying ""highly recommended"".",1435881600,7,2079,4.682191780821918

8722496,5,B010GSGQUI,"I remember Steve Allen (and Dave Garroway before him) doing The Tonight Show, and two of my all-time favorite comedians to show up there were Buddy Hackett (""Good luck, Mr. Gretzky!"") and Professor Irwin Corey, the World's Greatest Living Authority! I hope that last bit's still true, but his comedy and legacy will live forever. I had no idea of the remarkable history of this clearly, singularly original comic genius. Blackballed for political interests like Constitutionality? Verboten topic in a military household. Dick Gregory? The closest I came to hearing Dick Gregory was caricatures in Mad Magazine, until I got out of that environment. But Corey's acerbic and spot-on skewering of verbose pundits (while making absolutely no sense whatsoever!) is tremendously appealing to me, and I cop to it: I've adapted part of that philosophy into my own public persona, and simply to be the ""class clown"" from time to time I'll drop a malapropism into a conversation. (I didn't realize he coined one of my favorites: ""I feel a whole lot more like I do now than I did when I got here,"" e.g.)  I find my malaprop character is becoming less and less an act as years go by, which is still (fortunately) entertaining to my friends but increasingly fretful for myself. (I mean, how do I know I've forgotten something if I've actually forgotten it? I remember odd items, but so many are comedy routines that sometimes I wonder where the philosophy that ""Laughter Is The Best Medicine"" ends and I begin? It doesn't matter much: a world without humor is hell, a good pun is its own reword, and Thank Ghu for Professor Irwin Corey, National (nay, WORLD!) Treasure! May I be as young as he is when I get to be as old as he is. ...
... and regarding Buddy and Mr. Gretzky: Look up a space website called ""The Apollo Lunar Surface Journal"" and I think they've even placed a disclaimer regarding the late great Neil Armstrong having ever said anything like, ""Good luck, Mr. Gretzky!"" after stepping foot upon the moon and flubbing his own line. (""That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."" He told Sir Arthur Clarke later, ""That's what I wrote, that's what I meant to say, that's what I thought I said!"" but the world heard it wrong.) But (and I urge you to look it up, it's classic!) it is a slightly lurid tale of young Armstrong retrieving a baseball and overhearing a conversation between his neighbors. Google it. ;)",1468281600,6,2429,4.688524590163935
