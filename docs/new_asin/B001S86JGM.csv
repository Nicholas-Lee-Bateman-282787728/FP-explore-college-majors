8339457,4,B001S86JGM,"The easygoing American guide to European travel gives sound and accessible advice about various parts of France. This DVD contains eight episodes of his PBS show. Rather than trying to cover the whole country, he focuses on the sights and experiences that he likes the best. Generally that corresponds to what the average American likes. If you have seen his show, you know how he is: like your next door neighbor. He picks out a few neighborhoods in Paris, walks with some friends, who are usually local tour guides, and picks out his version of the good places to go. The major museums, neighborhoods, cathedrals and parks are all covered. If you want recommendations on hotels, restaurants, and other details, you will need to get a copy of his book. The videos give you a better idea of the surrounding, but the details are missing. There are a few momentary shots of hotels and restaurants, but almost none are mentioned by name.

Rick narrates the journey, giving a bit of history, local geography, and brief travel advice. He uses his murderous French accent, but the locals don't even flinch. They know that a cameo on his show will pay big dividends to their tourist business. And that is the main problem with Rick Steves. He is so popular that once he mentions a picturesque little town, hotel, or restaurant, it becomes a destination for hordes of Americans. While the prices go up, the quaint, unhurried atmosphere vaporizes. If the proprietor doesn't seem terribly friendly, that's because you are undoubtedly the umpteenth American they've seen this week, clutching a Rick Steve's guide, asking the same questions they have answered a thousand times. Still, he has a good eye for the places you will want to see, and most of them are going to be touristy anyway, so don't worry, just enjoy them. After all, if you go there, you probably are a tourist. What's so bad about that?

I don't worry about the popularity of these guides. They are an excellent source of information, from a reliable source. While his tastes don't exactly coincide with mine, he gives a great overview, with some good recommendations.  If he covers a place, I always check Rick Steves before I travel.",1339804800,4,2191,4.8063660477453585
