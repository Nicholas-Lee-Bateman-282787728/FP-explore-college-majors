1083023,5,6305786372,"I already reviewed this earlier when I first starting using it, but now it has been about 3 weeks and just wanted to say I am definitely seeing results.  I am not a new mom, youngest is 21/2 but I have found this  workout works regardless.  I usually run on my treadmill about every other  day but have really never done any strengthing exercises with weights,  situps, pushups, etc.  I have been doing Workout C consistently 4 times a  week and I feel so much stronger.  I can do all the pushups now, whereas  when I first started I could only do 2.  The situps still kill me, so am  still working on them! There's not a lot of cardio work but for toning and  strengthening its great.  I am thoroughly enjoying this workout!",958003200,24,725,4.32089552238806
1083024,5,6305786372,"Although this tape is geared to new moms and women, men can find a solid workout in this tape.  Workouts B & C, developed by pro Kathy Kaehler are good intermediate cardio/sculpting routines. You can adjust the weights  for what's appropriate for you.  The ""card squats & lunges""  are killer. Who'd have thought playing cards would pack such a punch! As  with her previous videos, Cindy delivers a visual feast; great  cinematography, music, settings.  You won't be bored.",955238400,51,472,4.9743589743589745

1083064,5,6305786372,"This DVD got me through post-baby months and got my body back into shape. I have revisited it ever since because of the quick segements that focus on flexibility as much as toning and slow, steady weight loss. I was never a ""Cindy fan"" but I did gain some respect for her through this video - it provides glimpses into her world post-baby with husband, friend/fitness pro, and her quest to get back to shape without appearing unrealistic. She says in quite candid manner that she knows that bringing a baby into the world clearly changes your attitudes, body, emotions, etc. and that her intention with this video is to share her methods for focusing a little on self for the good of herself and her relationship as a role model to her baby. Kudos to Cindy for making this DVD. I have bought it as gifts for new mom's several times since first buying it.

I love the fact that I can choose what level to do depending on how I am feeling and how much time I have. Very easy to follow and it is enjoyable. Give it a try it ill not disappoint and you will see results. No issues with shipping.,1407456000,,394,3.7590361445783134

1083084,4,6305786372,"When I bought this, I didn't realize that it was designed for new moms.  However, anyone new to working out or starting over, might like this.  I bought this because it's Cindy Crawford, and I had her first workout on VHS and remember liking it.

This DVD was a very pleasant surprise. It's a calm workout, which I liked - it's like no other workout DVD I own or have used. Even though it's relaxed, if you do workout C, the workout itself is challenging, but because of the music, the visuals changing, and both Kathy and Cindy being relaxed and not annoying, it's a pleasant workout experience.  Who knew that a challenging workout could be effective and relaxing?!

Workout A is more like a stretch, with some lunges and squats thrown in. Since this was designed for new moms, I can see why workout A would be appealing - gentle, but it gets you moving.  Workout B is more challenging than workout A, and it's the next step. Workout C is a full-length workout and is definitely the most challenging.

Pros:  It features Kathy Kaehler, who has a calm demeanor, and is very likeable. Cindy Crawford is relaxed and likeable, unlike so many of the celebrity workouts.  The music features original artists that are upbeat and calming. The different sets include a high rise with views of a city, an ocean, a house that looks to be on a beach, and a few with Cindy in a bedroom setting, showing that you can do workout A barefoot and in your pajamas.

It's like working out with your friends.

I'm so glad I didn't read the cover and see that it was for new mothers.",1388275200,4,1563,4.4491228070175435
1083085,5,6305786372,Great all around workouts with Kathy Kaehler. Three workouts. The C workout being the all around workout with cardio and lasts about 40 minutes. I like that one the best!!,1383436800,,171,4.733333333333333
1083086,4,6305786372,"My sister and I completed this entire DVD today. We both agree that Part A on its own is a warm-up, and nothing more. Part B will get your heart rate up, but isn't an adequate workout if you want to see results. Part C is killer. We found a lot of the movements awkward, and off time. At times, it was hard to see what Kathy and Cindy were doing. Nonetheless, by the time I got to Part C, I was drenched in sweat. Overall, I rate this workout highly, because if you do all 3 parts back-to-back, you get an extremely tough, but doable, workout.

Notes: - Other than a quick water break, we took no breaks. I believe this is why I got so much out of the workout.
  - I used 3 pound weights whenever weights were used, and 4 pound weights when Kathy asked for 2 weights in one hand. Previously I have done this workout with 2 lb weights, but 3-4 lbs made it so much tougher, so if you're not getting results, use more weight.",1381017600,2,922,4.054945054945055
1083087,5,6305786372,"There are a lot of things I like about this workout!  C (the last part) is my favorite.  It's great for busy new mothers and can be done at home.  The music is good.  The abdominals don't hurt the back!!  It gets the heart rate up if done all together, and is extremely good for flexibility.  Heavier weights can be used, eventually, on some of the exercises.  (Not others if damage might occur.  Be careful:).)  My baby isn't a baby anymore and I still get a good workout, paring it with other things.  Thank you Cindy and Kathy!  You did a great job.",1380758400,,552,4.262135922330097

1083089,5,6305786372,"Not a grueling workout by any means, but a gently effective allover body conditioning routine that nearly anyone can do. (I'm referring to workout C, the longest program.) I love the relaxed vibe, the peaceful pretty music and the lovely cinematography. Hardly any talking from either Cindy or her instructor Kathy, another plus. The weights used are light - beginners can start with just a pair of 3 lb weights (I use 3-8 lbs upper body, heavier for lower body) - the steps (too simple to be called choreography) are easy to follow and, apart from a few modifiable jumps, it's entirely low impact. Basic enough to allow for some progression; safe enough to be done every day if desired. All these factors combine to make this the perfect 40-minute no-dread routine for early morning exercise. Ahh, what a terrific mellow way to start the day and get in some stretching, light cardio and body sculpting.

I often follow up later in the day with additional cardio or some Pilates/yoga but if my day becomes too busy and I can't, then at least I've already done something wonderful for my body.",1364342400,2,1092,4.717277486910994

1083129,3,6305786372,"I should be clear that I have NOT just had a baby, though I just recently started working out regularly again (about 8 weeks ago), having done nothing for two years due to some injuries.  I have been doing the classic FIRM videos and Crunch workouts so I have a ""base"" but I wouldn't say I'm in any way ""advanced.""  I'm in my late 30s, and I've done other Cindy C. workouts in the past, so I thought this might be a good workout for me.  Despite what some reviewers have said, however, I found this workout to be waaaaaaaay too easy.  I figured I'd start with workout B and run it straight into workout C.  Workout B had just barely gotten going when they started the cooldown!  So I skipped ahead to workout C expecting a better challenge but I was rather disappointed.  The cardio sections are very brief, you barely get your heartrate going and then you stop and do some weightlifting which brings the heartrate right back down again.  So this was not the right workout for me.  For those who already have a fitness ""base,"" I'd say try Cindy's ""next challenge"" workout if you're looking for something a little (though not much) harder, or try the Firm classic workouts.  They'll kick your butt.",1267315200,,1197,4.474654377880184

1083131,5,6305786372,"I have worked out to her other tapes previously and loved them.  But that was also back when I was a teenager.  I am now 28, mother of three, and had not exercised in a decade.  ""A New Dimension"" is a tape that I grew with.  It took me four months to work through all the work outs and to get to a level of competency on workout C.  I started with A a few times a week and did not attempt to do it twice until my body was ready.  I once attempted workout B before I was ready and found that was hard.  I went back to A and worked up to every combo I could think of (except for pairing anything with workout C) when I felt my body was ready.  These routines woke up my muscles and were a soothing introduction back into full force exercise.  My body needed it, and I can't thank these two women enough for marketing these routines.

This tape set out to do what it was DESIGNED to do:  to help postpartum mothers and those who had been off the fitness bandwagon for awhile.  I do not recommend this tape for those whose fitness levels are intermediate or advanced.  I do not recommend this tape to anyone who likes certain celebrities (i.e. don't buy the tape just because it says Cindy Crawford on it as other reviewers have found out the hard way).  Buy it based on your fitness level.",1260921600,7,1286,4.112449799196787

1083154,3,6305786372,"I found Cindy's other DVD, The Next Challenge Workout, to be much more effective in terms of a workout.
There are three workouts on this DVD (workout A is 12 minutes, workout B is 16 minutes and workout C is 41 minutes). Honestly, I'm not really in shape (I'm right where my BMI should be but I can't run even a mile probably) but workout A and workout B are a joke. Even when I combine workout A and workout B together, it feels more like a stretch than anything. Workout C is a bit better but it's not challenging at all. I would recommend Cindy's Next Challenge DVD. Or, if you're on a time constraint and love a good workout, try Kathy Ireland's Core Workout (there are three, 12 minute workouts each).
What I do love about this DVD though is the setting and the way it was produced. Beautiful scenery, the footage is amazing and I would say it's probably the most esthetically pleasing workout DVD I own! Too bad it's not more challenging. I really really doubt you would find this to be enough to get flat abs after a pregnancy - but I'm sure this is a good DVD to slowly get yourself back into working out since it's slow paced and it's better than doing nothing or starting out too hard and discouraging yourself.",1231372800,3,1221,4.336244541484716

Kathy Kaehler is a great trainer and inspiration and I have always listened to her advise. You won't be dissapointed with this dvd.

This isn't an intimidating workout -you feel as though you are looking in on Cindy's personal training session.  There are even scenes of Cindy working out in sweatpants and pajamas which make it more relatable.

(I let it slip a little) now its time to start again for my up coming wedding and this tape is the ticket..)  Some exercises take a little time to get used to the steps but I really like the combination of abs, legs, arms and cardio.  I did do some gym time along with this tape about once a week for the eliptical with a tiny bit of weights at the gym but this tape got me going.. I used to like her first work out best.. but this one is my new favorite..If you want to get in shape, tone up and just shave a few pounds, this is a good workout.. but makesure you change it up with a few other ones or it will get stale after a few months.. also remember to watch your portions!",1167782400,2,982,3.9

Her first two tapes (yes, tapes, I got them when they first came out) are the best workout tapes I've owned.  They aren't cheesy or annoying, like many are with annoying hosts, and the music is upbeat and still relevant today.  Even after years of doing them, they are still challenging and I can actually tell I did something afterwards.  I know there was some controversy with the first workout being ""unsafe"".  Personally I feel like that was all blown very out of proportion.  In my opinion that just had to do with a viewer's common sense.

After reading the review that this video was actually designed for women who had recently given birth, I figured this DVD would be a good place to start to gently help me exercise, until I could increase my strength for more of a workout.  This video is wonderful.  The first workout appeared to be ""too easy,"" but I would recommend doing it for at least two weeks, then trying the second workout.  The second workout introduces a little bit of aerobic exercise, which Cindy normally doesn't do, and it's fun.  Do this one for a about 4 weeks before going on to the third video to build your stamina/strength.  The third is definitely the most challenging and the longest workout, but it's fun, and you will notice results quickly, which makes you want to continue working out with this DVD.  Cindy and Kathy make a good team here.  It's easy to see what each of them contributed to this workout.  I strongly recommend it for anyone recovering from an injury, or anyone who is looking for a beginner's workout.  This video goes from beginner level (workout #1) to intermediate/advanced, it's an enjoyable workout, and the results received from this workout are all the motivation you'll need to stay in shape.",1157241600,7,1373,4.679166666666666

I used shape your body while I was pregnant 10 years ago ( Don't be horrified )  living in the tropics and with a few adjustments I did that workout in the pool minus the situps combined with walking. I had my first birth naturally and within 3 Hours and had the best legs ever.

My first impression of Cindy was that she is honest. She does not pretend to be the expert and she really has a Genunie interest in exercising this shines throught on the DVDs.  I have tried many other celebrity videos and you just don't feel comfortable with them. She does not try to exercise and be perfect at the same time. Really  she is there just to help and with alot of sympathy. You cannot help but like her.

New Dimension is fantastic I have started doing the 10min workout everyday. You do not have to do alot to get results just target the right areas. People can workout for an hour and not get the same results.

New Dimension is not just a post pregnancy DVD . This is great for women over 35 that want to control their pelvic muscles the other two workouts on the DVD are more than you will ever need to work all your body . I still mix it up with first two DVDs

I have just purchased the set of three DVds again to replace worn out copies . Cindy looks like she will be in my lounge room for a very long time.

  --I enjoyed the different length workouts.  You don't always have 45 minutes to workout, even if you aren't a parent.

  --These workouts are lead by Kathy Kaehler, not by Cindy like her other tapes.  I found Kathy uninspiring and uninteresting.  Cindy does not seem as familiar with this workout as she is with the Radu ones.  She is more ""window dressing"" in this video.

  --The amount of repetitions for the movements varies greatly, which I found very annoying.

  --The warm-up and cool-down are very, very short, even on the 40 minute Workout ""C"".

  --The music will put you to sleep.  I suggest hitting the ""mute"" button on your TV and listening to your own music.

If you are a new mother or beginner, this is a good tape to ease you into a workout routine.  However, I believe you will quickly outgrow it.",1146009600,11,1051,4.551351351351351

Then I saw a special on models on VH1.  Again I was intrigued.  A friend recommended this video saying her roommate did it faithfully and got a great body.

Basically the video has three segments.  One 10 minute, one 20 minute and then one 40 minute.  It incorporates simple lunges and squats with some aerobic cardio and weights.  Cindy and Kathy and very upbeat, but not in a cheesy way.  Cindy is way impressive since she just had a baby.  You might think you would pass on this video since it is for post natal exercise, but I am telling you to keep it.  It works!

I worked out with the video a couple of times this week and I love it.  It was beautifully shot and had pleasant music.  The workout wasn't hard, but it wasn't easy.  I woke up the next morning completely sore and unable to barely sit down.  This work out definitely sneaks up on you.

I have never seen any exercise video as watchable or adaptable to my different phases of fitness over these years as Cindy Crawford's New Dimension. Not only is the exercise content appropriate, well balanced and effective but the pacing, music and settings are appealing enough to not jar me at a 6AM workout or after work either. Most exercise videos are the opposite - too loud and peppy. This lulls you into working out and gets you energized without irritating you. Even on the multihundredth viewing. Whether you are a new Mom, a couch potato or an advanced aerobics queen, this video contains 3 highly adaptable workouts. Cindy has a great partner that guides her & the audience to correct form and is equally easygoing but firm and professional. It's my favorite for all of these reasons, and I only wish there were more out there.

1083256,3,6305786372,"I have a wide variety of exercise videos & while I don't usually buy the ""celebrity"" workouts, I thought I'd give this a try. I'm somewhere in the intermediate level of fitness ability, so Workouts A & B were a complete waste of time. Workout C is better, so is here are some of the things I liked and disliked about this workout:
Pro's:
Nice variety of scenes (from outdoors to indoors, inset scenes, etc).
You get a full-body workout in about 40 mins (great for when you have little time).
Intense & challenging abs workout.
No cheesy lines like ""you're doing great!!"" (instead Cindy complains ""I don't wanna do any extra's!"") and no ""whoo-hoos"" that can be annoying.
Con's: Wow do they lift weights FAST. I found that I was feeling almost faint when doing the weights section until I realized that it was because I was breathing out on the exertion (which you are suppose to do) but they go soooo fast that I was actually hyperventilating...YIKES
Sometimes during the cardio parts the editing isn't very good and  when the scene switches from indoors to outdoors they're suddenly on the opposite foot (e.g., step-touching left to right, you tap down on the right, the scene changes, and now they're on the left foot). don't worry though, if you stay in time when the scene changes back they're back in time with you.
  Ok, so overall not a bad workout, but if you're looking for a whole-body workout that works both the lower & upper body and includes cardio AND includes a celebrity I much prefer the Elle Machpherson featuring Karen Voight workout (which has been out for at least 10 years now but I still really like it).",1119139200,3,1627,4.603448275862069

Way to be motivational and work hard Cindy! Anyway, I think that overall the exercises in this video are good and effective, but you have to modify it to your skills and needs. You also really need to be careful that YOU do the exercises correctly, even if she isn't. I have all three of her video's and I must say ""Cindy! Are you EVER going to go up in weight?""

1083291,4,6305786372,"Cindy Crawford used the routines in this video to get back into shape after her second child.  With the help of fitness expert Kathy Kaehler, she designed this workout to help new mothers ease back into fitness.  Although I've never had a child, I was interested in the variety of workouts that this video had to offer and decided to give it a try.  Throughout the video, Cindy and Kathy work out together in various settings, and Cindy is also shown working out alone in her bedroom and on the beach; at times, images of Cindy with her baby and her husband are woven in as well.  The background music includes some popular hit songs but is generally unobstrusive.

Workouts A and B are both short (12 and 16 minutes, respectively), fairly gentle routines to help you slowly get used to moving your body and beginning to work your muscles.

Section A starts with a gentle upper body stretch, moves into slow plies and lunges, and continues with just a bit of abs work (Kathy shows how to modify if your abs muscles were torn during labor).  This section ends with Kegel exercises and pelvic tilts, both of which are included in all three workouts.  Section B begins with a 4-minute warmup and stretch using a chair.  It then moves into a segment described as cardio, but it is really only a few minutes of side to side moves, knee lifts, etc. which can be performed with or without light weights.  Next are a few sets of squats and lunges using playing cards which you pick up off the floor, and then it's on to the floor for pelvic tilts, Kegels, and a bit more abs work.  As an intermediate exerciser, I found these first two segments too easy, and I was disappointed by the lack of cardio and upper body work.  Although I don't expect to use these sections often, they are likely to be perfect for their intended audience of those trying to get back into fitness, especially since the time went by very quickly in both workouts.

To my surprise, the third section made a pretty big leap from the first two, as it was actually quite challenging.  Again, there was not much cardio work:  only two short cardio segments were included, and as in Section B, these consisted mainly of very basic moves such as knee raises and side kicks (the second segment used light weights to increase the work).  On the other hand, the toning segments in this section really worked the muscles, particularly in the upper body.  After a brief stretch, Section C begins with upper body toning using the weights and working shoulders, biceps, and triceps.  Next is the first cardio interval (4 minutes), and then a lower body focus which includes plies and lunges (again using the playing cards), glutes work (using a chair for balance), and more upper body with push-ups against the chair.  Following the second cardio interval (3 minutes), there is additional toning work for the arms using the chair, a tough push-ups segment (with Kegels inbetween), some pretty strenuous abs work, and finally, pelvic tilts.  This section ends with a 2-minute stretch.

I will definitely continue using Section C when I want a full-body strength workout that I can do in a relatively short (40 minutes) period of time.  Although I think those new to or returning to exercise will enjoy the gentleness of the first two sections, keep in mind that it might take you quite awhile to work up to the third segment.  This is definitely a video which allows for growth and which can provide some benefit to all but the most advanced exercisers.",1093046400,13,3506,4.6284329563812605

1083308,5,6305786372,"I made a vow to myself over a year ago that I had to work out every day no matter what.  Now that is a hard commitment to keep when you are exhausted, your days are overburdened as it is, or you are just plain lazy. Yet, I have managed to keep that promise and then some. This workout is divided into three sections:  12 minutes, 16 minutes and 41 minutes.

 So, if I come home from work exhausted, the 12 minute section is perfect.  It includes a lot of stretching (great after a hard day), but also plie squats, lunges, Kegel exercises, ab work and pelvic lifts as well as a good cool down.  So, even though it is only 12 minutes, I have gotten in some exercise (and kept my vow).  Now on the days where I am just plain lazy, I tell myself I can spare 12 minutes. But after that is over, I get on a roll and go for the second workout which is only 16 minutes.  It starts with a nice warm-up, includes weight work with 3 pounds, a short cardio section, lunges and squats (with playing cards), push-ups, abs, kegels, pelvic lifts and a longer cool-down than in Section One. I have just gotten a great 28 minute workout but here is where the beauty of this tape really works:

Because of the visuals (Cindy exercising by the ocean, in an exercise room, in a beautiful blue spare room overlooking the water), the music, and Kathy and Cindy's rapport, I oftentimes go right into Section Three.  This is a complete workout and includes Cardio sections, a great weight workout, tough push-ups and tougher abs, as well as a challenging butt workout.  It also includes Kegel exercises (important to all women, whether you've had a baby or not).  So, I start off not wanting to work out and end up working out 69 minutes (when I have the time) and feel great.

I alternate this workout with other videos that use heavier weights (The Firm and FitPrime) so I never have to worry about overtraining.  Kathy is a great instructor and there are some innovative exercises in this video.  Because of both the aesthetics and the workout itself, in the three years I have used this video, I have never gotten bored and I have kept my everyday workout promise.  I wish Kathy and Cindy would collaborate on another video because this is one of the best.  Thanks, Kathy and Cindy!",1066003200,9,2261,4.383693045563549

This one is very good about giving you some options to make the moves less hard on the body, too... except those darn deep knee lunges, which are just hard on the knees.  Cindy is really confident on this one, and it is also nice to see her trainer (a more realistic body goal) who is also post-pregnancy & they mention different ways they do certain excercises because of their build, and the differences in their pregnancys.

In addition to helping me lose my pregnancy weight (all gone in just 12 weeks!), the stretches in particular were invaluable in helping ease the tension in my neck and shoulders.  (I also did the neck and shoulder stretches after each 2:00 a.m. feeding.)  You don't need any special equipment with this video, just a mat, some weights, a chair and some playing cards.  I used what I had handy, including a chair from the dining room and coasters from the living room table in place of cards.  Unlike some videos, the music and scenery of this video are beautiful, and are a welcome change from the hectic pace of caring for a newborn.  I wondered if I'd feel intimidated by the ""Supermodel Factor,"" but I found Cindy to be inherently sweet and likable.  The footage of her husband and baby are pleasant and add a very personal touch.  Well done!",1057449600,5,1271,4.412017167381975
1083312,5,6305786372,"I have already lost 19 pouns in the last two months using this video. I started using it when I first gave birth two years ago, but stop and gained more wait.  The three step video really helps you get back on track and in shape.  I think this is great for new moms.  A and B workout are not for non new mothers. Believe me working out of 10 mintues after giving births is hard, and as a former Marine (less than one year out of the service) I know a hard workout when I experience one.  I alternate with Denise Austins Pilates video.  I have not reach any plateaus yet.  I am looking forward to be reaching my goal weight in a month.  Thank Cindy for doing this video.

1083313,3,6305786372,"I've been working out using Cindy's videos from 5 years. My favorite one is the ""Next Challenge"" tape. Anyway.. I bought the ""The New Dimension"" 2 weeks ago. I was curious to see what the new workout would be. Workout A and B are way too short and easy for me, but part C had some really new and challenging parts such as the push-ups. The cardio part is fun - aerobics. There are not enough exercises for your legs though. It seems that they focus more on the arms. Also, I don't think the stretching at the beginning and the end is enough. So, if you are advanced in your work out, this tape might be way too easy for you. On the other hand, if you are tired of the same routine and the same excercises you do over and over again, it might be fun to workout along with the ""New dimension"". What I do to keep me focused, motivated, and definitely excited about working out is that every day i work out I use one of the Cindy's videos. In this way I'm not getting bored doing the same tape and exercises. Buy this video if you want something easy and fun.",1049932800,2,1055,4.12621359223301

Even though I didn't just give birth, one of the three segments are wonderful to add to your daily exercise program or to use one of the segments alone. I do wish I would have had this video when just a new mommy. Cindy and Kathy really make you feel as though you are right there with them hanging out and doing something wonderful for your body.

She sold out to make this, and with all the wild affects, it should win an emmy or something for all the great beuaty shots, i think more time was spent on the production than the actualu choreography of this workout.

Well it is the best of cindy and kathy kaehler is the best trainer. being a mother herself, she takes you step by step into each session with a calm demeanor yet she makes you feel that you can do it. This video is divided into a 12 min, 16 min and 40 min workout. Use it as much possible together or alone. the 40 min workout is a tough one but 2x a week is all it takes to make you firm. i am happy to back in the best shape even better than before i had my kids, thanks to this video. i now have a love for working out and staying healthy and use this video along with several others i also do now. thank you cindy and kathy !!",1042675200,7,963,3.913265306122449
1083357,4,6305786372,"I checked this tape out from the public library. I had no idea it was a post-pregnancy tape; but I tried it anyways, to see how it was.
It consists of 3 workouts, A, B, C.
workout A has some stretching, workout B, has some more stretching, and workout C is the real 'workout'.
its about 45mins long, has the usual warm-up, then its arms/lunges and some cardio sets, some more arms and buns/abs and then a cool down.
This tape doesn't look hard when you first watch it, but when you actually do it, it can be a good workout.
I like this tape, I specially like the arms and abs parts.
But i really don't think that this tape will get you back in shape! you need more cardivascular! this is more of a change of pace tape!
The background is nice, it's in some living room and changes to the beach; the trainer (Kathy Kaehler) is always there with Cindy, and the music is good.",1037664000,4,872,4.196428571428571
1083358,4,6305786372,"...Workouts A & B are snoozers, but, consider this video if you are just getting started, and not ready to join the thong-clad-kick-boxing crowd. When I started working out this was fairly simple, unintimidating and effective.  You will move ahead fairly quickly so pass it on to a friend in need when you are ready for a more intense workout. I used heavier weights in the upper body workout(use caution work up to it). I liked her self deprication style and -- what do you know -- she's a little bit klutzy like me.
Try it, you might like it if you are starting out or starting over.",1018569600,3,585,4.416666666666667
1083359,4,6305786372,"I was a little bit dissapointed with this tape. I have workout to cindy's other fittness tapes and i have grown attached to her. But not all of this tape was inefficiant the second and expecialy the third section of the tape really had great tonning excesises. I felt the cardio secion of the tape were a bit weak but it does have awsome moves for your abs, arms and [rear]. Those four count pushups KILL!!! Really i like the tape for the tonning but not to burn calories. I will probably save it after i have a child and do it riligously it seems like a very good tape for a new mom. Also i think cindy is sooooo much more personal and realaxed in this video as opposed to her last ones I overall really like this tape.",1016928000,5,720,4.15
1083360,5,6305786372,"I purchased this tape before I became pregnant, since I hadn't worked out in a while and needed a program that would allow me to ease back into a routine.  After working out with the tape for a few months, I became pregnant, and I pretty much quit working out until about a month ago (my daughter is seven months old now).
This tape addresses many of the issues new moms have: they show you how to do crunches if you have torn abdominal muscles from pregnancy, and Cindy is often pointing out that this is a workout she eased into- in other words, she knows it's a hard workout, and she doesn't want the viewer to feel badly if they can't do all the reps that she can.
I now have all of Cindy's tapes, and I use them all on a rotating basis, so I don't get bored.  Although this is the ""easiest"" of the three tapes, don't let that term deceive:  I sweat just as much with this tape as I do with the Next Challenge.
One of the things that I really like about Cindy's workouts is that she is not a chipper personality: perky size-two women jumping around on my television proclaiming, ""You can do it!"" doesn't exactly motivate me.  Cindy and Kathy are more of the mindset of getting the job done- after all, most new moms certainly don't have very much time to work out before the baby wakes up again.
The tape starts with two short workouts to help get back into an excercising routine.  The movements are slow at times (perhaps a little TOO slow, in my opinion), but they really focus on having the correct form and the lowest risk of injury.  For me, the first two workouts were very easy, and after working out with those for a few days I was ready to move on to the more difficult workout, and I haven't gone back to the short ones since.
The third workout is a more intense workout.  Lasting about 40 minutes, it excercises all of the muscle groups, combining primarily strength training with dumbbells and adding a little light aerobics for variety.
Something else that really helps put things in perspective when working out is that even Cindy admits she doesn't look the same now as she did before she had her baby; and we shouldn't expect to look the way we did in high school.  Having a supermodel admit that yes, pregnancy DOES have an effect on your overall apperance helps me remember to be happy with the way I look, and to know that although I won't look the same as I did pre-baby, I can be in better shape.",1015545600,11,2422,4.3076923076923075
1083361,5,6305786372,"After 16 months of holding on to baby weight, I finally decided to take action. I never exercised regularly and couldn't do 10 situps in a row to save my life, but I thought I would have to start somewhere.  I don't know why I chose this tape, I cant stand supermodels who think they know it all.  Im glad I did because this tape is exactly what I needed without the holier than thou supermodel.  Even though Cindy hasn't seen a fat day in her life, she really comes off as a down to earth new mom.  She doesnt act as if she knows more about fitness than she does and it was very encouraging to me to see her getting tired, complaining a bit, and yes, I even saw a glimmer of sweat.  The real star of the tape is Kathy Kaehler who is very laid back and explains the exercises well.  She is not a drill sergeant or sickenly peppy. I love the way she eases you back into exercising.  The first part is a short 12 min routine with alot of stretching, a little bit of leg and ab work.  This is perfect for those first starting out.  The second part is longer (16 min, I think, but it may be a bit longer) with cardio, ab, weights, squats, lunges, push ups, kegels, pelvic tilts, and the all important cool down.  The third part is 40 min and it is a butt kicker, but I was able to get through the whole thing the first time I tried it.  This part involves more complicated abs, pushups, weight work, 2 mini cardio sections, stretches, kegels, squats and leg work.  All you need to do this tape are 10 playing cards (for squats), a chair, weights (3 lb), and a towel or mat.  The concept and layout of the tape are wonderfully done.  The music is mellow and modern, not generic aerobic music.  The variety of scenes (Cindy on the beach, in her apt, even of her in ratty sweats and pjs with no shoes) keep the tape from getting dull.  I highly recommend this tape to anyone who wants to ease their way back into shape and still achieve results.  Ive done this tape for two weeks and have lost 5 lbs already.",1010793600,10,2001,4.142487046632124

It has aerobics and weights for a good all over workout and has worked fast to get my recently neglected arm muscles back into shape.

I had bought this tape when my first baby was born and had stopped using it when I found out I was pregnant with my second child.  I enjoyed the tape so much, at that time I was determined to get fit and use the tape right after my second child was born.  As Cindy explains, she tells the viewer her fitness system...workout A she did for a couple of weeks after giving birth, wkout B for three weeks, and workout C thereafter.  I did exactly what she did and kept on a somewhat healthy diet, and today I have lost a total of 25 pounds.  I thought the tape was very much motivating that watching her made me want to have a body like her (I don't think I'll ever will but it keeps me going).  I especially enjoy it because when I don't have time I'll exercise with her workout A.  About a month ago workout C had become not so challenging as I became stronger, so I changed my three-pound wieghts (she uses weights in the workout) to five pound wieghts.  Now I'm sweating as much as I did when I first started to do workout C.  Kathy is also a great trainer.  She has a soothing voice and I don't mind listening to her every day.  You have to keep in mind to not be discouraged if by three month after giving birth you'll look like Cindy.  Remember Cindy has a personal trainer, probably a cook, and of course a babysitter to care for her baby whenever she wants to workout.

This tape has a really good learning curve and is especially good for anyone who hasn't worked out in a while. It really encouraged me to see that Cindy seemed to get tired out too. I have to admit that I skipped the push-ups (never could do those!) as they were too hard for me but it's good to have something I can grow into.

1083399,4,6305786372,"This tape, which contains three workouts, is for beginners or those who want to ease their way back into exercising. It's also a good backup for  days when you too tired to do your regular workout. Although Cindy Crawford  recently gave birth, the exercises are suitable for everyone. The third  workout program, which is 41 minutes long snd the only one of the three I  use, is soothing and beautiful to watch. The music is just right, in my  opinion, and Cindy's trainer does a good job demonstrating the right and  wrong way of doing the movements. To its credit, this video lacks the jerky  movements and MTV-like atmosphere typical of Cindy's previous exercise  videos. You probably won't work up a sweat with the cardi sections, and the  upper-body workout with weights is too short. But the push ups and  abdominal sections are challenging. If you want fast results, you'll  probably outgrow this tape fairly quickly. Or you'll need to supplement  your program with more vigorous workouts. I alternate this program with  some Crunch and Firm. The first two workouts are short--10 minutes and 16  minutes.
