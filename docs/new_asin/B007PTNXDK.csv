As a nature lover and long-time resident of Arizona, I thought I had experienced much of what Arizona has to offer, but this video takes me places and shows Arizona from a point of view I would never otherwise experience on my own.

I have already watched this video several times - the beautiful landscapes and relaxing music are very soothing and enjoyable.  I look forward to sharing this video with others too as it would make a wonderful gift.",1340409600,,683,4.803418803418803
8520688,5,B007PTNXDK,"I wouldn't think it was possible to capture so much of the beauty and diversity of nature that Arizona has, but Phil Giriodi's video does just that. I was enchanted with the exquisite overlay of wonderful soothing music with the magical images of nature and animals. I like that the animals and places were each identified and there were also beautiful and thoughtful quotes interspersed through out. I loved the thunderstorm scenes so much - the sound of the rumbling thunder and the beauty of the darkened sky on the landscape. It was just magical to see. Now I have a list of the few places I haven't had the pleasure to visit myself (The Crystal Forest, Antelope Canyon), but I have those gorgeous images of yours to pull me there and show me what might be hidden and waiting.  Now, I only wonder when will you do justice to Arizona's enchanting neighbor, New Mexico, Mr. Giriodi? I would love to see that one sitting on my shelf with this wonderful video.",1338768000,2,960,4.5813953488372094

The videography and editing are excellent. This video is a work of art.",1337212800,2,243,4.674418604651163
