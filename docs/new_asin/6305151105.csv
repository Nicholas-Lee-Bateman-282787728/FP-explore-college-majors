After a while it being in a different language doesn't matter. You  get so into the story you don't notice it and the voices are much better in  the subtitled version.",925084800,,319,4.0476190476190474
975267,5,6305151105,"Hey, I love this series. Even though I am currently getting the dubbed version(*hissing* from die-hard otakus), I have seen the subtitled version. I may get it one day, but for now, I'm happy.
This series has everything; action, drama, romance, comedy, friendship, killer music and dialouge and some of the sexiest guys you could dream of. (Yes, I KNOW they're cartoons)
I just want to say that...CHICHIRI RULES no da!! I have nothing against the others either. Tasuki and Tamahome are tied for second, Hotohori and Mitskauke for third, Nuriko and Chiriko for fourth(only because I don't have the WHOLE series yet, these guys may still shift)
Anyway, I seriously recommend this series to everyone out there. I'll let you decide on which type.
To my fellow otaku, arigatou and sayonara, no da!",982195200,,792,4.917910447761194
975268,4,6305151105,Alright I'll tell u right now why i only gave it 4 stars. The gliff hanger at the end will leave u wanting more! The show may seam like a light hearted romp through ancient china. But it has some dark under currents. I'd give it a 12 + rateing. The story is unique and has some what of an addictive quality. The visuals are exellent except for same simplistic crowd sences and the songs are superb but during the ending song where it should go fast it gets slower and slower till your almost completely boared with it. I would sugest the subtitled virsion considering the songs r in their original unchanged version and chichires no da was y know. Anyway get this tape but i also sugest the box set if you have the money otherwise don't even bother if u get addicted easily.,982108800,,774,4.308219178082192
975269,2,6305151105,"Now lets see...how do I describe this show...well first of all I can start off by saying its definetly Shogo.  Yup 100% Shogo.  For the unlearned souls out there that means that this show is sorta like Sailor Moon.  While Shogo doesn't mean that it has to be Sailor Moon exactly (its really a style of art, but then again most stories written in that art style are Moon-ish)...The thing that struck me right off about this show is that first of all there seems to be well...no plot at all.  I couldn't bear to sit through the first tape and I might as well give it away to a two year old to watch.  While the dubbing was ok the series itself was just plain bad.  I would not reccomend this to anyone.  If you want a good fantasy show go check out Slayers, El Hazard (magna only I don't like the anime), Ranma, or way to many other good fantasy shows.",977011200,,850,4.177914110429448
975270,5,6305151105,"Fushigi Yuugi or Mysterious Play is one my favorite anime series. Sailor Moon is what got me hooked on anime, but I have enjoyed this series just as much if not more because its targeted at a more mature audiance ages 13 and up whereas Sailor moon is Y7.  The animation and the plot work together to produce excellant results.  Some anime has great animation but no plot, this does have plot and its interesting. The story is about a junoir high graduate named Miaka Yuki.  She is a little ditsy like Serena from Sailor moon but with a little more brains.  It starts out with Miaka and her friend Yui at the national library. While Yui goes to return a book,Miaka finds the vending mashines to buy a soda.  She forgets to buy it however because a red phionix appears and flies by her.  She follows it into a referance room, and sees a book lying on the ground open.  Yui joins her and the 2 start to read the book.  Its an anchient chinese novel called The Universe of the Four Gods.  Yui translates the chinese while Miaka listens to her read.  Suddenly a red light flashes and the 2 girls are pulled into the book.  Now Miaka is the main character of the story. When they first arrive they are attacked by slave traders. A man with an ogre simble on his forehead saves them. He then asks to be paid for his services. Yui tells him they have none he sighs and walks away.  Miaka filters for some money in her pocket but while she is not looking,Yui is taken back to the real world by the same red light. Miaka turned around and cannot find Yui so she thinks the man kidnapped her so she walks down the road to find him.  Later he saves her again and decides to help her find Yui.  His name is Tamahome.  The rest of the tape introduces Hotohori(the Emperor),Nuriko( a maiden with great strengh), and the reason Miaka was summoned to the Konan Empire.  I can't wait to get the next tape.  This series is awesome and has great lines and characters.  Each episode leaves you with a cliffhanger so you beg to see more.  Fushigi Yuugi is one of the best anime's out there.",973468800,6,2068,4.297157622739018

975273,5,6305151105,"What a great anime! What we have is a shojo of unbelievable quality. Yes, I did say shojo. I can't believe how beautiful this is! The storyline, the characters, the voice acting, it was almost perfect! The characters were  all unique and creative, and as with all good stories, there is no black  and white... only shades of gray. All the characters were very deep and  always had something deeper to reveal. I can't say this video itself is a  complete story, as it just sets up the main characters and doesn't have to  much intense action. Just some complex love polygons and some story  setting. The story sounds interesting so far, with the 4 gods and all. The  story itself is pretty religious, but I can't say you need to know a lot to  understand it. (You probably should get the dub if you're new to anime) I  can't help but think this is the beginning of an incredible saga. I MUST  see more, for three reasons:  1. I think this is going to get MUCH better  2. I think Yui is a cool character and to restrict her to the role of  ""story teller"" just isn't fair. 3. I would be a terrible otaku to  not watch this. Really, you need to see this incredible series. It's  something all anime fans should experience. ^^",960768000,,1221,4.34070796460177
975274,3,6305151105,"This video contains the first installments of the Fushigi Yugi/Mysterious Play saga, the story of two Japanese girls who are magically swept into an ancient Chinese book and its story.  Don't get this video expecting to be  satisfied at the end of the fourth episode; this story unfolds like a soap  opera, with little or nothing resolved at the end of each segment but with  enough suspense to keep the viewer wanting more.  Other reviewers have  mentioned this series' addictive appeal, and I agree.  Unless you can spend  the money to buy all episodes, or have access to a video rental store with  a wide selection of anime, don't enter into this story.  You'll want to  know how the love triangle is resolved, the outcome of the impending war,  and whether Miako and Yui return home to their mundane lives.
The  animation is so-so, with lots of shortcuts (still life art as filler), but  has moments of beauty and fun.  If you aren't familiar with anime  conventions, you'll have to get used to the way the characters' faces  change during comic scenes.
My twelve year old daughter is hooked on this  series, and I understand why.  I wouldn't recommend it, however, for  younger children: there is a transvestite whose presence brings up issues  of homosexuality, and Miako is often threatened by men who want to sell her  into slavery.  Still, as anime goes, this is relatively tame.",959731200,,1388,4.763713080168777
975275,5,6305151105,"The story is about a girl named Miaka and her best friend Yui. Both girls are in 9th grade and are preparing for high school exams. The two girls are headed to the National Library for Yui has to return a book. Miaka, who has  never been to the National Library before. As she waits for Yui to return  her book, Miaka goes to a juice machine, but drops her coin on the floor.  As she bends down to pick it up, a red bird flies over her. Curiously, she  follows it's trail up a stair case to the Important Documents Reference  Room. Yui finds her in the room and laughs at Miaka's story about following  the bird. Then suddenly a book falls out of a book shelf. They sit down and  pick up the book which is called,  ""The Universe of the Four  Gods."" Yui looks at it and says it is an anchient Chinese novel. They  open the book and start to read it. It says:
  ""Thus, the girl of  the legend opened the door of another world. This is the story of a girl  who gathered the Seven Sei of Suzaku. She obtained omnipotent power, and  made her dreams come true. The story itself is an incantation. Whoever  finishes reading it will recieve the main characters power. As soon as the  page is turned, the story will become truth and being.""
  They turn  the page and there is a bright red light the two girls vanish into the book  and our story begins.
  This is by far the best Anime I have ever  seen!  The art is amazing! The episodes are in the form of a story that  progresses as we go through the episodes. I would say this is most likely  for 13 and up. If you have ANY questions of any type, please let me know!  E-mail me at Boopsie1@aol.com.",955843200,,1642,4.126984126984127
975276,5,6305151105,"Being the first Pioneer volume of the series, ""The Universe of the Four Gods"" acts as the exposition of the whole, complex story. Overall, it is very light-hearted and introduces the main characters, Yuki  Miaka and Hongo Yui. There is also some subtle, hidden foreshadowing  (Miaka's line ""Are you really my best friend?""). Even if the  rising action doesn't *really* begin until a couple of volumes down the  road, this first volume is a memorable one, worthy of your anime  collection.

Of course, just because it is light-hearted doesn't  mean it was made for everyone. The rating of 13-and-up is a good, solid one  because this volume does contain sexual implications (rape was attempted in  the first episode alone).",955324800,,722,5.0
975347,5,6305151105,This is the best series. I'd recommend if you never seen a anime video before get this one.

975348,5,6305151105,"I just received this video from Amazon and had the chance to watch it for the first time yesterday. It is the best anime I have ever seen!
The first time I heard about Fushigi Yugi was when I decided to check out all  the anime Amazon had to offer.  I looked at all the volumes and read what  other viewers had to say about it.  Everyone commented that 'It was just so  great.  One of the best shows out there'.  That's what helped me to decide  that I should check it out!
I know there are a ton of anime's out  there, but I am really only familiar with Sailor Moon.  It has always been  my favorite show, but...after watching Fushigi Yugi, I have decided that I  like it better!  Fushigi Yugi just has so much more to offer.  It always  has suspense(great fighting scenes!), alot of romance, and is extremely  humorous. It also has a ton of cute guys (where SM just has one,  Mamoru)!
Plus, there is always something new going on in every episode  where in SM it seems like every episode is the same with that 'killing the  youma of the day' routine.
The only downside I could find was that each  tape is kinda expensive $$ (for me anyway).  And it makes me sooo mad  because FY is so very addictive!
Fushigi Yugi touches my heart in a way  SM never could.  (SM certainly never made me cry the way FY does!)  It's  just a very emotional series.",952819200,3,1346,4.200787401574803
975349,5,6305151105,"As an avid Fushigi Yuugi fan, I must admit to a certain level of bias concerning this particular subject.

975350,4,6305151105,"Okay, I admit I had SEVERE doubts about this series, so, instead of buying it, I rented it just to try it out.  It turned out to be better then I thought, and now, *sigh*, I'll probably have to buy the videos just to see  what happens next in the series! Arg!  The only bad points in this video,  and throughout the entire series, is: 1) Miaka is a ditz. I'm sorry, but  she JUST IS. I would prefer if Yui was the main character, but I guess  that's not gonna happen anytime soon. Miaka's annoying, yes, but you get  used to it after awhile..., and 2) the HORRIBLE theme song!  Blegh! It  starts out okay, but where it should speed up it starts into this  SLOOOOOOOOW part, and I myself prefer fast theme songs that make you want  to jump around the room.  *Like Sorcerer Hunters, or even Magic Knight  Rayearth*  Beyond that I recommend trying this out...especially for all the  cute guys!",947894400,3,890,4.341463414634147
975351,4,6305151105,"Although this isn't THE best thing I've ever seen, it's definately cute, and I heartily recommend it. The main character, Miaka, and her obsession with fast food lead to some hilarious scenes.
That doesn't necessarily  mean that the whole show is fun and games. There is some conflict, and love  triangles, love cubes, and such and such. It is quite an involving show,  and the opening and ending themes are very nifty (hehe). Even if they play  them 4 or 5 times throughout the first tape.
The animation is quite good,  except it originally being a TV show, at times it slacks off. The colors  are nice, and the character design and voices are great. Every aspect of  the it, although not an incredible masterpiece, is still a great series and  a fun tape to watch when there's nothing to do.",947635200,,793,4.574468085106383

7884249,4,6305151105,"Fushigi Yugi is a thoroughly fun series, with beautiful animation, fun comedy, sweet romance, and great drama.  While this video is really good, it's not the best ever.

Miaka Yuki is an ordinary, if slightly ditzy and gluttonous, junior high school girl.  One day, when she went with her best friend Yui to the national library, they were ""sucked"" into the book, the Universe of the Four Gods.  There they are attacked by a group of men, and rescued by the gorgeous-but-greedy Tamahome.  Yui is spontaneously brought back to her world, and Miaka is left alone.  After some time searching, she finds Tamahome, who inadvertently agrees to help her find Yui if Miaka gets one of the emperor's jewels.  When Miaka tries to do so, they are arrested and taken prisoner of the emperor.  There she is made the Priestess of Suzaku, and must find the Seven Celestial Warriors of Suzaku.  Tamahome is one, and so is the emperor, Hotohori.  Throughout the course of the video, Miaka also finds Nuriko, the third warrior, who is a beautiful court lady, and fights with her until Miaka wins her over.  Also, Hotohori falls in love with Miaka, and Miaka falls in love with Tamahome, who claims not to love anyone.  Nuriko also tries to seduce Tamahome, but is in love with Hotohori!

Fushigi Yugi is definitely a five-star series, but this video alone is only four stars.  Why?  Several reasons:

1. The animation: Yeah, yeah, I know it's superficial.  But the animation in the first few episodes are notable inferior to the rest of the series.  They often have still frames, which are okay every so often, but they use them in abundance.  At times, the motion is stiff and jerky, though not always.  Also, it can be noted that while Miaka is chasing Tamahome and yelling at him, the background repeats itself.  The art, nevertheless, is gorgeous.

2. (Lack of)Characters:  Part of what makes FY so fun is the lovable (and hate-able) characters.  In this volume, the only major characters introduced are Nuriko, Hotohori, Tamahome, Miaka, and Yui.  While these characters are all great, other characters such as Tasuki or Chichiri greatly add to it, and their absence definitely takes away.

3. Development: I love series with complex, twisty plots, and multifaceted, strongly developed characters.  FY definitely has one of those!  However, at this point, the plot is still simple and the characters are still shallow.

7884254,4,6305151105,"Fushigi Yugi (which translates roughly to ""the mysterious play"") is somewhat of a phenomenon in Japan. It began as a comic which catapulted its author, Yu Watase, to fame, and has spawned a TV series, a series of direct-to-video side stories, and innumerable other pieces of merchandising.
Fushigi Yugi centers around Miaka Yuki, a junior high school girl who's an utter ditz. When she gets sucked into ""The Universe of the Four Gods,"" a book she finds in the reference section of the National Library, she ends up in ancient China with her best friend, Yui. They're saved from leering bandits by Tamahome, a money-hungry mercenary with a heart of gold.
Eventually Yui ends up back in her own world, following Miaka's adventures by reading ""The Universe of the Four Gods,"" while Miaka meets the Emperor of the Konan Empire, Hotohori, and finds out that she is the Priestess of Suzaku. With the title comes the responsibility to find the Seven Warriors of Suzaku and assemble them to save the Empire.
Later developments in the series take it to a darker level, when Yui returns to the world of the book and becomes the rival Priestess of Seiryu, and small children probably should not watch Fushigi Yugi: both for the semi-mature content -- a Warrior of Suzaku, Nuriko, who is infatuated with both Hotohori and Tamahome turns out to be a cross-dressing man -- and because a lot of the show would sail over their heads.
The series has some areas where you must suspend disbelief (why would both Tamahome and Hotohori fall in love with a whiny dimwit like Miaka?), but it's a touching story that continues through two seasons of the TV series. The dubbing, while not great, is not as cringeworthy as other anime series'. While it won't appeal to everyone, if you're even remotely interested, this tape is worth seeing.",991094400,,1815,4.7834394904458595
7884255,1,6305151105,"Fushigi Yuugi has gotta be one of the most overrated animes ever; it gives anime a bad name.  The formulaic plots, the 1 dimensional characters (I know it's a cartoon, but I've seen more depth in one episode of SponegeBob SquarePants!), the cheesiest dialogue and the [worst]animation ever produced by Studio Pierrot.
In any case here's what's in store for you if you get volume one.  The series begins with a young Japanese schoolgirl named Miaka journeying into a different world (actually it's Ancient China) through a book. Inside, she meets Tamahome, a rebel-without-a-cause prettyboy, and of course, they instantly fall in love.  In a wild outburst of stupidity, Miaka chases after the Emperor's wagon, and when she idiotically reaches inside to get his attention, she is arrested and brought to jail with Tamahome.  Miaka manages to escape, and meets up with Hotohori the emperor. At first she thinks he's a woman, but then he tells her he's ""No, I'm a man and I'm the empororer!"".  And BIG SURPRISE, he instantly falls in love with her.  Hotohori then tells Miaka that she is the ""Priestess of Suzaku""  and that he's been waiting for her his whole life, and that he is a ""Suzaku Warrior"" sworn to protect her. Tamahome is also a Warrior of the Suzaku, it turns out, and The Priestess supposedly will have great power when her all of her warriors are assembled, and the series takes off from there.
Now that I've gotten the ""plot"" out of the way, you're probably saying to yourself, ""Hey, that doesn't sound so bad!""  Yeah, written down it really doesn't sound so bad.  It's the way this anime was executed and especially the way Miaka is portrayed that makes this such a terrible show.  Miaka is your standard whiny, obsessive, skinny chick heroine who eats too much and whines to much.  Now sometimes a character like this can work, but not when every man in the show falls in love with her.  It just makes no sense, and it becomes very annoying.  The final straw for me was when the gay guy fell in love with her; I knew it had gone to far--but I've said too much.
The animation is static, the backgrounds are rushed, the music is shrill.  The characters are all drawn to be ""pretty"" and at times it's hard to tell them apart.  The use of ""Super Deformed"" characters is abused for, I guess, humor effect, but it falls flat for me every time. The men especially are very bland, and after the first couple of episodes the action really slows down.
Yes, so there's my two cents on this show.  But most people seem to love it, so use your best judgement here.  People looking for deep, emotional entertainment need not look here.  If you just want to stare at colorful pictures and listen to whiny characters being all romantic then this is SO for you.  I would recommend titles like ""Rurouni Kenshin"" and ""Cowboy Bebop"" to people with more sophisticated tastes, and not for fans of this horrible show.",987638400,,2908,4.622568093385214
