8245439,1,B0012ECXIU,"Below is the review I posted on the Amazon Video page for this film:

This movie has at least 4 fake 5-star reviews -- and likely more. But the gushing ""best ever"", ""worth every penny"" reviewers who say nothing specific about the film & who have posted only one review are surely fake. If not, then child protective services ought to investigate the wildly enthusiastic mother who claims to have enjoyed watching this vicious tale of horror in the Old West with her 14 year old son. If this had played in theatres it would have had an R rating. The high quality production values are very good, and the scenery is fabulous. But neither of these things makes it worth watching.

The movie takes place in Western US & Canada around 1870, and in Hollywood in 1923. The western story starts in Montana but moves to Canada. If you are actually interested in late 19th century Montana/Old West you can find a very authentic picture from Thomas Dinsdale, an Englishman who emigrated to Montana in the 1860s and wrote&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vigilantes-of-Montana/dp/0762725680/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vigilantes of Montana</a>&nbsp;in 1864.

A comparison of Dinsdale's book from the period vs this film is very revealing:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vigilantes-of-Montana/dp/0762725680/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vigilantes of Montana</a>&nbsp;tells the story of a Wild West populated with people trying to tame the frontier. Lawless bandits & murderers preyed on miners, bankers, etc. who had to travel lonely roads while physically transporting gold and other valuables. This made them easy prey for the criminal class. But Thomas Dinsdale's perspective is clearly that these men WERE criminals; they lived on the margins of decent society and they deserved the harshest justice. In the rough & tumble of the Western frontier, they were a minority who took advantage of the remote distances & limited law enforcement. They were not celebrated as anti-heroes; they were despised as moral monsters who well deserved the frontier justice of hanging.

This film, on the other hand, traffics largely in stick-figure stereotypes & the Old West is populated virtually entirely by this criminal class of hateful, lawless predators . But at the same time as we are intended to despise almost everyone, the filmmakers cleverly elevate the worst criminal brutes to the status of anti-hero. Their cruelty & viciousness to humans (emigrants & Indians) and animals is depicted on-camera in loving detail intended to excite and titillate us for entertainment.

The filmmaker has an agenda. If you share the values and worldview of the filmmaker, you may enjoy this obscenely vicious entertainment, and may wish to share it with your 14 year old son to teach him that his country (whether the US or Canada) was founded and built pretty much entirely by despicable, hateful, vicious sociopaths & their fellow travelers.

Personally, I prefer my histories of the authentic Western frontier without the overlay of the contemporary social justice warrior agenda & its distorted cultural marxist prism. So I will hope the authentic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vigilantes-of-Montana/dp/0762725680/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vigilantes of Montana</a>&nbsp;and the oral histories of Montana pioneer women&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nothing-to-Tell-Extraordinary-Stories-of-Montana-Ranch-Women/dp/0762779098/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nothing to Tell: Extraordinary Stories of Montana Ranch Women</a>&nbsp;are someday made into movies.",1465603200,,3701,6.135135135135135

8245442,4,B0012ECXIU,"This was a border-crossing novel of the old west by Guy Vanderhaeghe. To my discredit I have yet to get around to reading the book but last night I re-watched the DVD.

I could not remember having watched it the first time. The character of the title loses his Englishman in the opening scenes and takes up with a group of wolvers who, in the words of one of the actors in one of the supplements, are not very nice people. The action jumps from a movie set in Hollywood in the present which here is the 70ies, to a cabin on a rundown ranch in California, to a trail ride at the turn of the century as Harry pumps the aging Shorty for his memories of his life on the trail as the boy in question.

This is a better than average Canadian Production in which rival CTV and CBC each apparently had a hand in. A fair number of well-known Canadian actors are involved. There are two major issues. In casting no attempt was made to find actors to play the youthful and aging Shorty who in any way resembled one another. The action jumps from one place and time to another so often it leaves the viewer somewhat confused more than a few times.",1431820800,,1135,4.225806451612903
8245443,5,B0012ECXIU,Great movie with a tough story line. The acting is superb and the story is easy to follow even though it switches frequently 50 years in the past.,1419724800,,146,4.25
8245444,5,B0012ECXIU,Very nice Cd- The movie was very good- a bit violent at times but it is reality of how it really was then. Excellent dvd and quality and the packaging was also very good. Thanks so much!,1354838400,,186,4.054054054054054
8245445,4,B0012ECXIU,"If you can find this movie (a Canadian TV micro-series), it is worth watching because it was as a response to this incident that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was started.  Although this story is highly fictionalized, the Cypress Hills Massacre really happened, and the movie is factual enough to mention John 'livereater' Johnston, who ate raw game livers, only one of the wolfers (who poisoned buffalo kills to kill the wolves and other animals that fed off the kill) was killed by the Assiniboine warriors, and the presumed thief was decapitated and his head put on a stick.  [In the movie, the chief's head, not the thief's head was severed.]

Another theme in this movie is how the movie industry produced 'revisionist' Westerns that, at times, where the exact opposite of what actually happened.  I don't think anyone, especially those who like Westerns, will find the near three hours of this movie to be dragging.  The Englishman's boy, some fifty years later as he tells his story, uses almost constant profanity, but the rest of the movie is much better.  There is one scene where an Indian girl is gang raped, and she is shown lying naked on the floor, face down.  Hopefully, if your family sees this movie, your teens will find it interesting enough to study the history of the Cypress Hills Massacre.",1237939200,6,1317,4.800884955752212
