2474475,2,B000CSTKHE,"Bunshinsaba (Byeong-ki Ahn, 2004)

Mediocre and derivative Korean horror flick that draws on years of better work without offering anything new or interesting to the mix. Yu-jin (Se-eun Lee) and her mother move back to her mother's old village. In true outsider fashion, the local kids gang up on her, and she places a curse on the four ringleaders with a ouija board. (Does this sound familiar?) They start to die off, and Yu-jin has to figure out what she's done, and how to undo it, with the help of a couple of sympathetic teachers. It's not a terrible way to kill an hour and a half, because it has the usual Asian-horror-film atmosphere in spades, but if you grab another Tartan Asia Extreme flick off the shelf at random, you've got a pretty good chance of finding something scarier/more interesting/more original/etc. **",1219190400,,828,4.79020979020979
2474476,5,B000CSTKHE,"I have to admitt that when I saw this movie I thought it was going to be the normal terrible remake of an old film that I watched when I was younger. This movie, however was an unexpected delight. I love foreign films anyways but even if you don't it's definitely worth watching and reading since it's subtitled. If you like suspense and trickery than this will be a great find for you.",1211673600,,386,4.301369863013699
2474477,4,B000CSTKHE,"The theme has been done before, but it was still entertaining and I liked the characters.",1186185600,4,89,4.625
2474478,5,B000CSTKHE,This is korean horror at it's finest. The plot is good. The acting is good and the story line moves at a fast pace with little scary suprizes. It has a classic revenge theme featuring some young (and rather attractive) korean females which I thought was just fantastic! Highly recommended!,1184544000,8,289,4.8
2474479,4,B000CSTKHE,"I picked up this DVD, ""Bunshinsaba,"" along with about 14 other Korean and Japanese DVDs a few years ago when one of the Asian Video stores where I lived was relocating and having a bargain sale. All were new and in packaging: And since I never saw any of these horror films, and the price was great, I decided to purchase them. I don't regret it one bit. This is a very good film. I have seen my share of Korean and Japanese horror films, and think that the director, Byeong-ki Ahn, who also directed Nightmare [aka: Gawi] and ""Phone"" did an excellent job with this film. First of all, it was very different from many in the horror genre in terms of suspense and creepiness.

Some of my friends do not particularly care for this film, therefore, I would suggest you rent the film first. But I do think it is well worth the purchase. And although there are similar traits in this film as with other Asian horror films, this does not detract from the film one bit: due to the fact that this film is very well acted and directed. There is not too much scare factor in this film, [although it does have its share] as much as there is suspense. The film begins with a bullied classmate at an all-girls school named Lee Yu-jin (Se-eun Lee). Being fed up with the constant harassment, she decides to put a curse on the other girls who are picking on her. Moreover, two of her friends participate in this activity. They make a special numberboard; and after chanting the name 'Bunshinsaba' a few times, the curse is in effect.

The girls who were picking on them begin to die. A sort of self-suicide, as each student sets themselves on fire on different days. As these students begin to die one by one, the film veers towards another area at the school: The administration. It appears that the principal and his entire staff, along with the people of this town have been covering up a terrible deed from long ago. Yu-jin does not realize that a student was killed over 30-years-ago [no spoilers] and her name was Kim In-suk (Yu-ri Lee). Also, (Yu-ri Lee) did a very convincing role in her part. Plus, there is something peculiar with the new teacher in class, Lee Eun-ju (Gyu-ri Kim). There is more to her than meets the eye. The ghostly haunting and revenge in the film is great, and the conclusion is very good. If you like Asian horror, then I recommend this film highly. [Stars: 4.5]",1170028800,24,2379,4.454128440366972
2474480,4,B000CSTKHE,"I liked this film. It kept my attention, and the plot wasn't as confusing as other Asian films. ""Bunshinsaba,"" however, is just like most of the Asian films circling around today. The CREEPINESS (not so much the plot) is very similar to ""The Ring,"" and the ""The Grudge,"" amoung others. But it works! No matter how many times I see movies with a female ghost and long black hair in her face, who walks funny and suddenly appears right behind you--- it still freaks me out! I also enjoyed the film, because although it is horror, it was also very sad.",1169769600,13,549,4.445544554455446
2474481,5,B000CSTKHE,"this film really surprised me...it was very creepy, the story line was so-so...but that is one angry ghost....very well done film....",1167609600,6,133,5.380952380952381
2474482,4,B000CSTKHE,"This is NOT, as the previous reviewer suggested, part of the Whispering Corridors series. The other 3 are: memento mari, Wishing Stairs, and Voice Letter.

This film also follows a similar girls in school formula, but it really has more elements in common with the One Missed Call 3 DVD series, and The Eye.

Three girls summon a spirit from chanting and a piece of paper, to go after the enemies on their list. Their enemies are nasty girls who pick on them, the lead character in particular. Everything gets out of control when one girl peeks. It then flashes to a completely different scene in the future and continues from then on with a few flashbacks. The bad girls start dying by catching on fire. Soon, her friends betray her, and the rest of the girls try to escape only to be killed one by one. That is when the story of a mistreated student from the past comes to light...could she be the spirit the girls summoned? What does she want?",1159488000,2,946,4.46242774566474
2474483,2,B000CSTKHE,"This is the latest unofficial entry in the Korean horror series that started with ""Whispering Corridors,"" a series that is linked mainly thematically by taking place in all-girl high schools, where students feel the modern effects of a past wrong doings and the wrath of vengeful ghosts.  Unfortunately, it seems the series has gone on too long.

""Bunshinsaba"" (Alternately known as ""Witchboard,"" ""Ouija Board,"" ""Kokuri san"" or a variety of international titles), starts with a group of three friends who are the target of bullies at school.  Seeking revenge, they make a version of a Ouija board and summon Bunshinsaba to do the job.  While summoning the spirit, the three girls are warned not to open their eyes, but one girl, Yoo-Jin doesn't follow the rules and sees a ghostly girl peering over their shoulders.  Predictably, one by one the bullies start to die, all by the same horrible method, their heads burned to a crisp.  Meanwhile, a new teacher in class starts doing roll call, and has a conversation with a non-existent student named Kim In-Sook.  It turns out that Kim In-Sook was a girl burned alive by the townspeople years ago, and she cursed the village, her spirit biding her time before she would be summoned up and able to enact her own revenge.

What's really missing from ""Bunshinsaba"" is mood.  The story of Kim In-Sook is complicated, and takes too much time for the various people who remember her tale to each add their bit.  All the exposition stops the chills in their tracks, blocking any suspense that had been built up.  Its too bad, because the director has crafted some very chilling scenes, that work really well and make you wish for a better movie.  The method of death behind Kim In-Sook's revenge is particularly horrifying, and gave me a genuine shock.  Those few scenes raise the film up from being a total loss, but aren't enough to save the whole thing.

I can forgive a horror movie for being predictable, if it is pulled off with some style and flair, and if it delivers sufficient scares to get me glancing behind me.  But it is hard to forgive one for being boring, and any horror movie that has more people sitting around a table talking than dark corridors and spooky ghosts, just doesn't cut it.",1158192000,3,2245,4.720512820512821
2474484,2,B000CSTKHE,"I saw it a long time ago and I couldn't remember what was going on so I re-watched it and I must say I will never make that mistake again. I couldn't find anything that I liked: bad performances, bad directing...The story is OK, and could have been great in the hands of a more capable team. What a shame...",1399939200,,307,4.133333333333334
2474485,4,B000CSTKHE,"The acting is really good and in this dubbed version the voice acting is great, there is only one girl whos voice seems a bit off. Witch board is a story of the typical bully and the misfit. A young girl is shy and happens to be new at a school in a mountain village, so she becomes the prime target for a click of social queens who decide to bully her at school, after school, and on random encounters around the village. It just so happens that a similar incident happened in the town many years ago that led up to the mysterious death of a girl that use to go to school there. The new girl gets tired of all the crap and decides to call upon a curse. The curse once invoked will punish all the people whos names are on the Bunshinsaba by slow-painful death. The ghost is creepy, but don't expect a huge scare and scream viewing. The story has a mystery that is unraveled, the story is creepy, but not full of gore. A nice haunting tale that will give you that eerie feeling without causing night mares.",1381276800,,1005,4.185567010309279
2474486,4,B000CSTKHE,"I watched this with my younger sister and she was sooooo scared!  LOL.  The acting is surprisingly good in this one.  I didn't find it as scary as my sister did--she scares easily--but, I still think it was worth purchasing.",1375833600,,224,4.55
2474487,4,B000CSTKHE,"Bunshinsaba, or Witch Board, follows Yoo-Jin and her friends after they set a curse on their bullies. During the Bunshinsaba curse, Yoo-Jin opens her eyes, despite giving the warning herself, causing the ghost to possess her. It's a bit more complicated, but for the sake of this review's length I'll leave it a that. Bunshinsaba is a spooky ghost vengeance tale.

The story is very creepy and effective, using jump-scares, tension, and disturbing imagery wisely. It does have a rough start, but eventually smoothens out and becomes easier to follow. It's consistent, as in it's a balanced story that doesn't solely rely on one type of scare and it moves at an acceptable pace. The ending of the film was also creepy. It really is a scary film, although it is similar to other ghost-revenge stories from the region. The acting was great, and so was the music. The visual effects/make-up was also creepy and effective.

Overall, Bunshinsaba is a creepy supernatural horror film, with great jump-scares and eerily disturbing imagery. I recommend a purchase for fans of horror, and a rental otherwise.

Bunshinsaba has strong violence and blood.",1367193600,5,1142,5.031746031746032
2474488,4,B000CSTKHE,From the same director as Nightmare and Phone comes Witchboard.  A very good movie for the creepy atmosphere.  A story of classmate torment and the resultant unholy spirit revenge that always goes too far.  I am a big fan of the Asian horror genre and this is a great movie.,1362787200,,274,4.44
2474489,5,B000CSTKHE,"Part of that great Whispering series. Incredible acting by all the players in this deeper than most Psychological Horror flick.
Will not run over the plot...it is always the same. The talent is in how they put a different spin on an old story...Great",1357776000,,250,4.704545454545454
2474490,5,B000CSTKHE,"Just got my copy today in the mail and watched it, and it was excellent! Of course, I knew it would be excellent since I have two other films from this director (Nightmare & Phone). I'm a big fan of all asian horror and I mean anything asian horror. I'm not one to put up any spoilers on my reviews and plus other reviewers have already given what the stories about. What I will say is that this is an excellent movie all around, great story, acting, sound & picture. Film is in excellent 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen picture and 5.1 Dolby Digital surround. Special features include trailer, previews, music video, and audio commentary.",1356912000,,636,4.6371681415929205
2474491,3,B000CSTKHE,"I really enjoyed the three previous Witchboard movies that were released in the U.S., so I figured I would give this one a try. After all, the 3rd one was released in 1995, so I figured nine years later would be a nice touch into making it an awesome film. Wrong! This one is definitely unique from the other 3, I will admit that. It dosen't have as much scare as the other three previous films, and I found this one to be a little boring at times. The other 3 held my interest the whole time. I can't say I hated this film, because there are far worse films out there. I got it to complete my Wichboard collection and only viewed it twice. If you want it to complete your set, by all means go for it. But you won't want to view it more than twice. If you decide to buy it, try getting it at a cheap price. This one is an expensive title, but just isn't worth the price. Hopefully if another sequel is made, there will be a better plot and script. Something that will keep our attention.",1299974400,,987,4.092783505154639
2474492,4,B000CSTKHE,"OK..I LOVE ASIAN CULTURE, ASIAN FOOD AND MOST ASIAN PEOPLE; I STARTED WATCHING ASIAN EXTREME ON SUNDANCE CHANNEL AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE FILMS THEY SHOWED; I SCARE EASY AND THIS WAS SCARY. I LOVE IT! I WAS LEERY BECAUSE OF IGNORANCE, THAT ONLY AMERICAN FILM MAKERS COULD SCARE U; I WAS WRONG! THE FILM IS ABOUT A GIRL WHO IS BULLIED AT HER SCHOOL, SHE FORMS A CLUB AND BEGINS PICKING OFF HER ENEMIES ONE  BY ONE( MOST ARE SET ON FIRE, ONE IS RAN OVER BY TRUCK); THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO STORIES AT WORK HERE. FIRST THE BULLIED GIRL, WHO IS A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG ACTRESS FROM KOREA, WHO MADE A COUPLE OTHER FILMS. ANYWAY, THE OTHER STORY IS SOMEWHAT OF A GHOST STORY; ABOUT A BLIND GIRL WHO IS BURNED ALIVE BY THE TOWNSPEOPLE WHO FEAR HER..IT TIES TOGETHER IN THE END TRUST ME. OVERALL, THE MOVIE IS VERY WELL DONE, AND HAS AN EXTRA C.D. OF BEHIND THE SCENES, OUT TAKES, ETC...AND YOU CAN SET IT FOR ENGLISH IF YOU WANT. THIS IS A TWO KERNAL POP CORN FILM, ENJOY AND DO NOT WATCH IT IN DARK...(IF YOU SCARE EASY)...BOO!",1293321600,,1012,4.216494845360825
2474493,5,B000CSTKHE,"This movie was on the Sundance channel this weekend and I usually have a hard time with subtitles. I was completely sucked into this film. The suspense and ""jumpy"" moments were just right. No overkill. And the plot kept you wanting to watch it to the end. It kind of reminded me of The Lottery a little.",1228089600,,303,4.333333333333333

8102260,3,B000CSTKHE,"The movie was great but, the packaging and dvd itself was terrible. The packaging was torn as if someone had ripped into it and the dvd settings for the movie were inconsistent. I had to watch the movie on mute. I couldn't turn the commentary off and have english subtitles on at the same time. I spent about an hour fiddling with the settings and nothing changed sadly. I had the same result continuously.

Aside from the packaging and settings, I throroughly enjoyed the movie. The story was cohesive, easy to follow and very entertaining. It was not scary in my opinion. I think the original Evil Dead is scarier than this movie. It was more of a supernatural or suspense movie rather than a horror film. I would purchase this movie again because I enjoyed it. I would just recommend purchasing this movie from but from another vendor.",1451952000,,838,4.624161073825503

8102265,3,B000CSTKHE,Everything about this movie was predictable and boring. I didn't really like the plot it was to much like the grudge. Then it just gets weird but still predictable and not as good as other asian horror movies. I also though the dub was pretty terrible almost unbalance sometimes.,1415318400,,279,4.714285714285714
8102266,3,B000CSTKHE,The movie was good. This movie was a quick order delivery. Thanks.,1406419200,,66,4.583333333333333
8102267,3,B000CSTKHE,"Yu-Jin is the new girl in school and gets picked on. Along with two other girls, they invoke curse 29, a spirit that Yu-Jin is in contact with. Yu-Jin gets possessed by the spirit which who gives her a cloudy set of contacts, memory blackouts, and a bad hair day. Soon the bullies start to kill themselves by setting their head on fire. The town goes crazy as the spirit of seat #29 that of Kim In-suk (Korean for Carrie?), who was killed 30 years ago finds her way back.

The film didn't seem to scary. A young girl with smokey contacts making people off themselves. It has its moments, but there are better Tokoyo Shock films out there for the money.",1400803200,,652,4.344262295081967
