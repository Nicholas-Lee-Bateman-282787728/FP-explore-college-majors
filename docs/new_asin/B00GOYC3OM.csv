8625826,5,B00GOYC3OM,I'm a big fan of Marc Maron and was happy when this arrived. It was as if it was brand new.,1499731200,,91,3.380952380952381

8625828,4,B00GOYC3OM,My face hurt from laughing so much. Marc has been a hit or miss with me. This was one of his best shows for me and it wasn't even a real show. It was just Marc basically telling stories and it was very very funny. Maybe not fall out your seat funny but funny enough to make your face hurt.,1444780800,,289,3.8333333333333335
8625829,5,B00GOYC3OM,I've watched Marc on his tv show and listened to his podcasts. Not frequently but enough to be familiar with his general style. I had never seen him do an actual comedy stand up show though. This was my first and I was startled to discover that he was absolutely terrific. The unusual thing about his style in stand up is that it is like you are in his basement with him and there are maybe ten of you and you are personally experiencing an evening with him. How he has managed to pull this off on a video I cannot even imagine. It is funny but more than that it is like spending an evening with a friend. I especially liked his telling us what it was like dating a woman twenty years younger than he is. She also wants babies so he of course had to weigh the pros and cons of that with us too. I wonder if he was always this good at stand up or if life has mellowed him to this point. I pictured him as being a lot more maniacal than he was here. He wasn't maniacal at all. Amazing.,1436918400,,983,3.99492385786802
8625830,4,B00GOYC3OM,"I really dig this because he gets deeper into his music fandom. I haven't been catching his podcasts of late where he does this even more, but sure would love a collection of his best music interviews etc. as well. Go for it, Marc! You're better than a whole lot of rock critics, and we love your salty bastard ways.",1409788800,,316,4.283333333333333

8625832,5,B00GOYC3OM,"Marc at his anguished best, making you laugh while he looks like he is about to have a break down :) I loved it.",1398038400,2,112,3.7083333333333335
8625833,5,B00GOYC3OM,"I have been binge watching Marc Maron and listening to his podcast for a few weeks now and found this on Amazon and I knew I had to watch this. There is something about Marc Maron that just resonates this delicious sort of dark fragility and humility while at the same time bullets of wonderful biting wit. I enjoyed this very much, especially considering how he went into this with no script and basically just winged it, it felt very intimate like he was just hanging out telling stories.",1396569600,,490,4.51685393258427
8625834,5,B00GOYC3OM,Its Marc Maron. He seems more adjusted to his skin now. And amazingly enough that doesn't take away from his comedy. Its like Maron Unplugged. And it works.,1393632000,2,156,4.607142857142857
