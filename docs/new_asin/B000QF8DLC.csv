2836923,5,B000QF8DLC,"This is a great series and I recently got the DVD boxed set.  I first got into this series by watching the Condor Hero Series recently put out in Taiwan in 2006.  After speaking with several friends, I was notified that the original Condor series (Legend of the Condor Heroes, Return of the Condor Heroes and The Golden Sword and Dragon Sabre) done in the 1980s was even better.  While Return of the Condor Heroes is the most popular of the trilogy, this series does a great job in presenting background information about the various characters in ""Return"".

These series are based on the martial arts novels by Louis Cha aka JinYong, who is the number one martial arts novelist in Hong Kong.  The character development is deep and the most of the plots are tied up to a good conclusion.  The pacing is balanced and does not feel hurried.  The series creators also did a great job in adhering to the basic plot of the novel.  Obviously it would have been impossible to fit everything in the novel into the series, but the general gist in portrayed.  The special effects are obviously a little outdated, but its still amazing to see how advanced they were for the times.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone.",1179792000,12,1218,4.571428571428571

8195922,4,B000QF8DLC,"This is a series my wife and I both really enjoy and the set is great.

The interior/ how the discs come isn't the most convenient design ever, and that's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. The story, the video quality, the title screen etc are all easy to navigate and wonderful to use.",1391558400,,295,4.175438596491228
8195923,5,B000QF8DLC,Captured an old soap opera type movie my husband watched as a child.  Nice to have it in DVD version.,1364169600,,101,4.05
8195924,4,B000QF8DLC,"I grew up watching this series, it's sequel, and prequel, and was very pleased to have found it on Amazon. It was everything I remembered as a show. I like that it has both Madarin and Cantonese dialogue. I deducted one star because of the English subtitles. I'm currently watching the series with my husband, who does not speak Chinese, and the subtitles are flashing by too fast for either him or me to read. This is an inconvenience, and as we are both speed readers, an annoyance to have to rewind several times for him to catch significant dialogue. That, and sometimes it loses something in translation, so I am hipping him up to some of the more arcane idioms. Otherwise, couldn't be happier with my purchase! :-)",1359244800,,720,4.589147286821706
8195925,5,B000QF8DLC,"I happened visited a relative, who is watching the VHS of this series.  I sat down for a minute and was hooked.  Then I owned the VHS, VCD, and DVD.  I watched it over and over years after years and still am enjoying it.  It is the best of all versions of remake.",1332115200,,263,3.9056603773584904
8195926,5,B000QF8DLC,"Anybody who loves the condor series should know even this classic shouldn't run over 150 dollars. That's just ridiculous pricing when you could buy it else where for a lot lower. I got mines for 45 bucks at another site. I don't want to point where but let me give you a hint, just say ""yes"" to ""asia"". This is an awesome series that should not be missed, highly recommended by many. LOVE LOVE LOVE this series.",1330300800,9,411,4.35064935064935
8195927,5,B000QF8DLC,"This movie is known all over the Asian countries for its great story line, casts, and martial arts.  This movie was dubbed in India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, you name it!  The actors are the main reasons people love this movie above all other remakes of this movie, I think.  Casts are Felix Wong, the late, beloved Barbara Yung, and Michael Miu.  Check out The Fearless Duo and the just released The Adventures of Chor Lau Heung which starred Michael Miu and Barbara Yung.  YESASIA.com is selling these titles on their site with English Subtitles and at a very good price.",1311465600,2,588,4.782178217821782
8195928,5,B000QF8DLC,"Very good quality DVD.  Love the fact that there are multiple language options with various subtitles.  I watch it in Cantonese with traditional Chinese subtitles.  I will try to watch it in English or with English subtitle next time, perhaps with my son or husband who do not understand Chinese.  Would be fun to introduce them to this series.  Love the female lead - she's absolutely adorable.  The story and the look of the show are timeless as they still look awesome after almost 30 years.",1307836800,,494,4.686046511627907
8195929,5,B000QF8DLC,"I purchased this series for my wife, who is from China, and she told me that this series was very popular years ago, and thought I also would enjoy it.

This series was like a drug, started a little slow, became a little more interesting, started caring for the characters, started getting mad at some of the others, couldn't wait to see what was next, had to start watching more than one episode at a time, next ting you know it's over......and I want more!

For you guys out there, it is a Chinese ""Soap opera"", but the plots have more to do with stealing Kung Fu techniques, developing Kung Fu skills, epic historic battles, lies, deceits, and finding love (ok, it's not all just traditional ""guy"" stuff).  The quality of the film is good, but like watching Soap opera film as opposed to a major film.  The special effects are a little ""cheesy"", but it was a TV series, and from the '80s.  The English subtitles are pretty good, but sometimes they come and go so fast that you have to go back and ""freeze"" the frame to read them.

Loved this series, and have just found out that there are two continuing sets for this story.  The only sad thing my wife told me is that the main actress in the film who played ""Rong"" (Yung Mei Ling) passed away after this series, and she will be hard to replace.  Just one of those characters you fall in love with- she ""made"" the series for me.  She will be missed.",1242950400,14,1402,4.320610687022901
8195930,5,B000QF8DLC,Enjoyed the DVD series very much.  My wife had the orginal VCR series in Vietnamese years ago and I always wanted to be able to watch it in english or with english subtitles so I could understand it better.  Now I will have to get the next series so I can continue the story.,1224806400,6,275,4.074074074074074
