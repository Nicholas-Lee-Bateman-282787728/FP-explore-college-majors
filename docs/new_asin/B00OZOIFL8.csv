6779834,1,B00OZOIFL8,"Have you ever watched a really bad movie,& said ""well at least the FX were good"" not this time. This floater stunk on every level.",1425081600,,130,4.24
6779835,1,B00OZOIFL8,"If this is the stuff I signed up for, I'm sorry I did. Love disaster movies. Hate this. Not worth the $3.99 I paid. Will not rent anymore. Very sincerely, Nancy Holman",1423267200,,167,4.25
6779836,1,B00OZOIFL8,"First, I just have to say- I LOVE bad disaster movies-but this was so bad- not even so bad that it was funny. This was not funny.  The acting was atrocious and the 'special' effects were worse.  The camera seemed to automatically find the thong booty shots as well as side boob shots. Guess we know what was on the mind of the camera operator. Don't waste your money!",1422230400,4,367,4.304347826086956
6779837,1,B00OZOIFL8,"Love disaster movies but this one did not make the grade at all. Do not do what I did and waste your money on this movie! It was not action at all and the special effects, they could have done a lot better. They could have cut the time out and put more time into the effects part. Do not waste your money please!",1421971200,6,312,3.890625
6779838,1,B00OZOIFL8,"This was the sorriest excuse for a movie as I have ever seen.  I love disaster flix but this.....extremely poor acting, bad special effects shoddily done.  This one was a NEGATIVE 4 stars.  Glad I only rented it in SD,  WASTE OF MONEY.",1421539200,6,235,4.395348837209302
6779839,1,B00OZOIFL8,"This rates right up with one of the worst movies of all time. The acting some of the poorest you'll have the misfortune to see. The scrip, well my 12 year old grandson could have done better. The special effects who ever did them should find a new job! The only good thing was when at long last it was over.",1421280000,7,307,4.049180327868853
6779840,1,B00OZOIFL8,"I am a disaster movie buff I watch some of the cheesiest ones, but this one I feel I wasted my money completely it should have been $1.99 or free but not $5.99 I paid. The story line would have been good with acting but since no one was a descent actor/actress the story line was lost, should have watched the football game with my husband.",1420934400,11,340,4.166666666666667
6779841,3,B00OZOIFL8,"First off a Gunnery Sergeant is a Marine rank not an Army one but at the end of the movie he was in an Army uniform of the rank of Major.
This movie should have been classed as a ""C"" movie, it was not worth the $5.99.
For the wave scenes I could see the wake that follows behind a boat, what with the technology we have today that could have been photoshopped out.
Reminding us how much time was left became very boring.",1420675200,,420,4.011904761904762
6779842,1,B00OZOIFL8,"The only thing good about this movie was Mr. Reggie Bannister and he was killed off WAY too early. Other than that wish I hadn't spent any money buying it, sorry to say. Terrible special effects. Needed more than just shots of the girl's butt cheeks. Fast forwarded through most of it after I realized that the producers thought that could carry the movie. I have seen a lot of ""B"" movies and this one doesn't deserve a B. Maybe a D minus.",1462147200,,439,4.301204819277109
6779843,1,B00OZOIFL8,"It had such promise for a Friday night B movie.....poor graphics, ridiculous premise, but it was just a bad movie. It was so unlike ""Superstorm"" or ""Ice Quake""----now that's some pseudo-science, B movie gold to give you a good chuckle!",1461715200,,235,4.9
6779844,3,B00OZOIFL8,Not as good as I anticipated.,1458000000,,29,4.0

6779846,1,B00OZOIFL8,"Horrible movie.  Rented it thinking it was a ""bad weather"" movie in the vein of Twister.  Not even close.  Bad special effects, rotten dialogue,  low budget everything.  Even the brief tsunami and earthquake stunk",1447113600,,213,5.147058823529412
6779847,1,B00OZOIFL8,I am an avid fan of disaster movies and own over 100 DVD's.  This movie Is AWFUL.  There is little or no actual disaster footage and the acting is Terrible!  I wish I could get my money back along with getting paid for actually watching this.,1445731200,2,242,4.217391304347826
6779848,2,B00OZOIFL8,I thoroughly enjoyed Reggie. Too bad he wasn't in all of it.,1445558400,,60,4.083333333333333

6779850,1,B00OZOIFL8,This must be on the top of your list of movies not to watch. The acting was awful and I can't remember special effects that were as bad and fake as these. 50's scyfy had much better effects. It was a complete waste of my time and money.,1443398400,,236,3.9375
6779851,1,B00OZOIFL8,"Horrible, please do not waste your time and money.  Wish I could get a refund.",1443139200,,78,4.2
6779852,3,B00OZOIFL8,"Yet another SyFy channel like movie - not too great acting and poor special effects, but if you love these corny movies like I do, you will love it too.",1442275200,,152,4.1
6779853,1,B00OZOIFL8,"This was a complete waste of time. The acting was pitiful. There were zero special effects. This would not even qualify as a B movie. I do like sci fi and disaster movies, but unfortunately this falls under the category of a ""disaster.""",1442102400,,236,4.511627906976744
6779854,1,B00OZOIFL8,"You know, I actually enjoy many cheesy sci-fi and disaster B movies. Some of them are unintentionally funny and this one was downright hilarious only because it was SOOO bad that we spent the whole time mimicking the characters who ALL seemed to be heavily medicated or at least had IQs below 50. But curiously, there were several scenes and characters that had NO relevance to the story, other scenes that only served to illustrate some cliche profiling sterotypes, and gratuitous flashes of female body parts (the Sharon Stone effect) which were apparently only due to unfortunate camera angles. As for special effects or CGI content ...it was probably the worst I have ever seen. The tsunami was seemingly a Magic Tsunami that didn't actually destroy anything. Instead things just faded and disappeared while the unmoving wave hovered in the background spitting out what looked like puffs of dust. A second grader's cardboard shoebox diorama would have worked better. If I were rating this on the amount of thigh-slapping guffaw laughter it generated, then it would be five stars. But since money would have to be spent to see it, something I would like to get back along with that hour and a half of my life, then I have to go with a one star rating only because I cannot choose negative numbers of stars.",1440979200,5,1309,4.79646017699115
6779855,1,B00OZOIFL8,You shouldn't have to pay more then a $1 to rent this bad movie,1440460800,,63,3.5714285714285716
6779856,1,B00OZOIFL8,"I really love a good disaster movie. Unfortunately, this is NOT that. This appears to be a movie put together by two drunken high-schoolers, over a weekend  and not even a LONG weekend, at that. The science was nonexistent; the pacing, leisurely. The dialogue between the strange & unbelievable characters was so relaxed that even THEY seemed unconvinced a disaster was going on. The special effects were interesting; I believe the ""giant tsunami"" footage was just close-up footage of WATERFALLS. This was an imaginative answer to having no SPFX budget, except that the ""towering waves"" just sort of hung there offshore and never actually HIT much of anything. And in the end [SPOILER ALERT], the scientists saved the coast using a method all agreed could not work... Then suddenly the credits are rolling and I'm thinking, ""Seriously? THAT'S the end?!?"" ... This wasn't even silly enough to be campy. Don't waste your money on this one. (Fortunately I didn't; I got it in trade credit at a used DVD store, and it's going right back there.)",1438992000,,1040,4.909090909090909
6779857,3,B00OZOIFL8,"This movie has the feel as a film student film project for college thesis. I have seen low budget films before but this  one was a bargain basement budget. Unknown actors and actresses doing what they could with a weak script and homemade special effects. I thought the movie did try to tell a story even though the budget and directing fought to stay on a budget and still save money. The furniture was what was found at Wal-Mart and the chairs looked like old dinner table chairs from someones kitchen. Even the actress playing the vice president had the look of someone that had a few belts under her belt. There was no attempt to add realism. The story was poor but somewhat interesting but the creation to completion was slowly being told by the actors and actresses. who wanted to show case their talents the best they could, but these performers were not A-list but  more C- level working on their movie trade craft by learning from their mistakes. Working their way up to being offered B-level parts. The idea was interesting",1435881600,,1033,4.608695652173913
6779858,1,B00OZOIFL8,"The acting was disjointed and ""stiff"".  Thought they might have just grabbed people off the street to play the parts.
The premise of tsunami vs. earthquake is not believable.",1435449600,,174,5.0

We can borrow my mom's video camera and we can use the garage for the movie set!"" Well YOUR home made movie would have been an academy award winner compared to this one!

6779870,1,B00OZOIFL8,"I am all about these B Grade disaster flicks, but this one was so bad it was painful. The plot jumps all over the place, the acting is terrible, and they felt it necessary to stick one character in a bikini for the entirety of her part (which was not small)... I want that hour of my life back please (yes, I stopped watching before the end).",1427587200,5,342,4.119402985074627
6779871,3,B00OZOIFL8,"This could have been another good movie, but they tried to get their audience by sticking a skinny girl, wearing a very small bikini's, butt  in our faces to the point of nausea.  When she really glad when she finally got killed off.  The rest of the movie was alright, but for some reason a few of the main characters seem miscast, the scientist working for the government should have been in a drunk movie and the boy who worked with the elderly scientist seemed like his was on drugs and half asleep.  His girlfriend was also not good in her part either.  The soldiers looked like a real soldier however, and the vice president bless her heart had not aged well.  I am sorry, the movie was just okay for me, to many bad distraction to",1425340800,2,737,4.343065693430657

It was the worst movie I have ever bought and watched on Amazon.  I went by the trailer and did not paid attention to the ratings.  I'm not into porn but it seem like the makers tried to use it to make up on how bad this movie really is.  Please, save your time and money.",1463702400,,416,3.802325581395349
