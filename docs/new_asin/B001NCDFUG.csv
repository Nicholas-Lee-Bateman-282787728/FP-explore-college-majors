3712220,4,B001NCDFUG,"Love the Penguins and the funny voices behind them. Great story! The brightest point of the whole movie is ""Sasha Baron Cohen"" and his weird Indian accent. Very funny! Your kids will like this and even adults might enjoy this good animation.",1234051200,2,241,4.761904761904762
3712221,5,B001NCDFUG,"""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" is entertaining to all ages - the movie has an immediately engaging storyline full of lovable characters:  Alex the lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman (the Giraffe), Gloria (the Hippo) , King Julien (the Lemur), Maurice and the penguins and the chimps are comic and well defined in this movie.  If this is the sequel, Madagascar 1 is a ""must see""!  So not knowing much about Madagascar 1, I was still able to enjoy and understand the story of this movie.  A group of animals (Lion, Zebra, Giraffe, and Monkeys) from a New York Zoo trying to understand their roots after arriving in Africa after spending most or all of their lives in captivity.  The Penguins are a hoot - and the movie is a fascinating funny romp.

The film evidently picks up with them trying to fly back to New York in an old World War II fighter plane - shot through the air with a giant slingshot.  After a hilarious take off and flight for a short period of time, the plane crashes in Madagascar - and through luck, Alex, the Lion somehow finds his father and mother and the other animals find their own kind as well.  Alex must prove he is ""King"" and take over the title from his father.  Alec Baldwin plays the villain as his rival Makunga.

There is also a hilarious role of hippo-Casanova Moto Moto who is romancing Gloria  (the Zoo hippo - who does not realize the Giraffe has always been in love with her.  The movie is full of sub-plots and animal drama and great laugh lines.  It is a madcap romp - and Africa seems like a great place - but we wonder if it is better than their Central Park Zoo?

Lots of friendship, love, teamwork, and family bonds are developed with this entertaining movie.  There is a tough tourist -granny - who manages to steal some laughs from the crazy escape artist penguins.  Granny stands out as she is a real fighter.  Every character delivers and the happy dancing Alex (the Lion) and other animals always deliver the fun on many fronts.

The voice casting is perfection! Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith are fabulous-should win a ""voice Oscar"".

And - FUNNY - with spectacular animation and lovable characters (King Julian the Lemur was too funny describing why the gods needed a sacrifice-Laughing still)  - A must see movie for all ages.",1234051200,5,2306,4.550970873786408
3712222,5,B001NCDFUG,"My Grandson is four and he very much enjoyed the comedy, music and characters. His Grandpa loved it as much,if not more. We all three found it to be even more entertaining than the first Madagascar film. My favorite characters were the penquins.",1233964800,3,245,4.72093023255814
3712223,5,B001NCDFUG,"After the Furious Five fiasco, Dreamworks has decided to give you all the goodies--and more--in the Blu-Ray release of Madagascar 2.  Not only do you get the behind-the-scenes, commentary, and other extras of the DVD, you also get the two Penguin cartoons from the 2-pack DVD bundle...and...

Easter Eggs!  Go to the Penguin episodes menu.  Highlight an episode.  Move the directional controller on your remote and a penguin appears!  Each episode will let you slide off the menu to two penguins, for a total of four extra ""short"" animations that launch when you select the penguin.

The Penguin episodes (and shorts) are hilarious.  The quality of the Blu-Ray version is eye-popping:  while Kung-Fu Panda produces lots of color and detail, Madagascar 2 goes it one step further with some pretty amazing depth of focus.  Some of the panning shots, for example, seem to pop off the screen.

In addition to all this, BD Live will connect you to other extras:  we watched a pretty good short documentary about lions, for example.  The way the menu is built makes me think there might be more to come.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, Madagascar 2 is a bizarre and hilarious sequel.  It introduces new characters, keeps the favorites from the first, and adds yet more movie spoofs and references for the grown-ups, some of them obvious (the Lion King) and some more obscure (The In-Laws).  If you're buying for a small child, chances are they might not follow the nuances of blu-ray:  the DVD will upscale enough on most players.  But for the best experience, this blu-ray is the version to buy.",1233878400,9,1595,4.801470588235294
3712224,2,B001NCDFUG,"I am very disappointed with this movie. The first movie, like most movies, was excellent. My toddler loves it and it is some what appropriate for him. We counted down the days until were we able to but the second so we could finally see it.
I watched this one with him for the first time and was blown away by the violence. Within minutes of the movie, a gun was being aimed at a lion cub.
It also has adult human throughout and the violent acts are just looking to be imitated.
And the plot, well, I think that Dream Works could have come up with something better than imitating the Lion King.
The first was an incredible movie and I am so sad that the second is not as good as the first.",1233878400,4,689,4.111111111111111
3712225,5,B001NCDFUG,"A couple of years ago, while my wife and I lounged around the house, desperately attempting to find something worthwhile on television, we stumbled across ""Madagascar."" Not expecting much from something that was ""just a cartoon,"" we nevertheless pushed the ""play"" button to access the movie, sat back, and proceeded to enjoy the heck out of that little movie. The monkeys were great, the penguins were better, the hypochondriac giraffe was hilarious, and the situations these characters got themselves into were unique. Years later, we still frequently make references to that film.

So yes, I am biased to this series. When we discovered that a sequel was in the works, a pearl of wisdom--a quote which could almost be described as soul poetry--from the preceding movie sprung to both our lips almost simultaneously: ""...If you have some poo, now would be the time to fling it."" However, as a devout cynic I always am convinced that sequels to which I look forward will nonetheless disappoint terribly (i.e., ""The Grudge 2,"" ""Matrix Revolutions,"" etc.).

How pleased I was to find my innate pessimism squashed flat by this comedic gem of animated cinema. ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" (ME2A), directed by Eric Darnell (""Antz"") and Tom McGrath (""Shrek the Third""), is filled to the brim with more jokes than could ever be processed on the first viewing, energized cartoon action sequences guaranteed to startle, and even a couple genuinely touching moments.

The film opens with a glimpse into Alex the lion's (Ben Stiller) past, before rocketing us <x> years into the future, where the gang is attempting to escape from Madagascar and return home. Alex, Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer), and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) board an ancient cargo plane mechanically resurrected by the quasi-militant group of penguins from the first movie. The mode of launch is, of course, a giant slingshot. As one may expect, the trip does not go entirely as planned, and our happy group of friends, along with King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen), Mort (Andy Richter), and even a couple of chess-playing monkey intellectuals crash-land rather dramatically somewhere in Africa. Along the way, Alex discovers his heritage, Marty come face-to-face with his individuality, and Melman and Gloria share perhaps the greatest discovery this side of the mortal coil. The rest is worth finding out on your own.

The animation, especially the water effects, was beautiful. Music and sound effects enhanced the atmosphere without becoming it. The overall plot was entertaining if a tiny bit predictable, and the side-stories in general augmented one's enjoyment of the film. Acting was uniformly excellent with the exception of Cohen's vocals, which were, quite simply, perfect. The take-off, flight, and crash sequences early in the movie were easily worth the price of admission by themselves--the rest of the movie was just gravy. When people say that they laughed so hard it hurt, you know that they are almost always exaggerating just a wee bit for storytelling purposes.

Read my words--I laughed so hard it hurt. I laughed so much that I cried. I laughed so violently that I began to cough. People in front of me began to move farther down into the theater, afraid that Whooping Cough Man would infect them. I probably still have tiny hemorrhages in my conjunctiva from the force of my laughter, especially for the airplane and ""hijacking of vehicles"" sequences. There are simply too many jokes churning your brain to goo for most of the movie, and you'll love every minute of it. Your kids will either love the movie, or love the idea of boring mom and dad laughing their butts off having a great, gorgeous, fantastic time.

This is highly recommended for all ages. I would have give four stars for some slightly familiar plot ideas, but the sheer fun inherent in this film pushes it straight back up to five stars.",1233792000,3,3934,5.016845329249617
3712226,5,B001NCDFUG,"Wow. One could spend some serious paragraphs dissecting all that is great about this one. Clarity, picture, colors, sounds, extras - they are all there.

As listed earlier, the much sought after Penguins episode is included on this BD, along with four music videos, fun games, trivia and plenty of material to give the kids some additional insight about all the that is Madagascar - and all in hidef! Oh yeah, the story is funny and has lines to keep both the adults and kids entertained.

The movie has been a hit in the store and shows off any HD display beautifully. The sound and music are mixed very well but the animation clarity even shows through enough for kids to say how ""totally cool"" it looks. Just had a pre-school class of girls visit the store for a field trip and all 7 of them loved it.

Hope you enjoy...forgot to mention: I laughed out loud more than a few times, those penguins are great (""...you're all males.."") - gotta love it.",1233792000,4,951,4.485549132947977

He feels really bad when his best friend, Alex, cannot recognize him. They become friends again. Gloria decides she wants to find a mate. She looks at all of the hippos and goes on a date with one. Melman, the giraffe, becomes a doctor. He is in love with Gloria and proclaims his love to her. She falls in love with him. The king lemur goes along on the journey as well.

The introduction of some new characters (Alex's parents, a rival lion, Moto Moto, etc) along with some existing (the old lady from the subway station, King Julien, etc) keeps it interesting.

3712366,4,B001NCDFUG,"`Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa` is pretty much your typical animation. Following the format of the first film this has plenty of fun and humour for the kids, as well as some `in jokes' and touches to keep the adults entertained and well. This film follows the same group of animals as they try to return to New York from Madagascar and end up returning to their roots in Africa instead. You get the same great cast doing the voice overs from the first film and some extra voice talent to compliment them. You may also be glad to hear the penguins are still there in all their evil, brooding glory and the Lemur King Julian manages to hitch a ride as well. In fact King Julian comes out with some of the best lines in the film. The animation is ok, not as good as other films I`ve seen but still credible and solid competition to films released by the Pixar studio. The music is pretty good as well. You can also watch this as stand alone film if you haven't seen the first film as some back story is supplied. This is light hearted and fun, about all that it sets out to be and if you enjoyed the first film or are a fan of animation in general then this is well worth checking out.

3712369,4,B001NCDFUG,"In the event that you missed my review of the first Madagascar (gasps), allow me to summarize the bottom line: It was funny and it was pretty.  It could have been funnier and it could have been a lot funnier but it was pretty.  It earned its 3.5 star score the old fashioned way even if my own elevated expectations resulted in a bit of disappointment.

Fortunately the powers-that-be saw enough potential in the zoo escapee quartet to warrant a sequel (and actually a weekly Penguins spin off on Nickelodeon shortly thereafter).  I can start by cutting right to the chase here- Madagascar Escape 2 Africa is a worthy sequel to the first film, swapping around a few strengths and weaknesses while managing to maintain a pretty similar wacky vibe.  The original case and directorial team returned for the sequel which immediately puts this one in a tier above such direct-to-DVD sequels as Open Season 2.

But before all that, let's talk about the plot.  The core of this tale, written by Etan Cohen and directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, once again follows the exploits of Alex (Ben Stiller), a showboating lion who, along with his buddies, escaped from caged captivity to the wild. Accompanying Alex are the wisecracking zebra, Marty (Chris Rock); the neurotic giraffe, Melman (David Schwimmer); and hippo with ever-expanding junk in the trunk, Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith).

When last we left this ragtag group of refugees, they found themselves trapped on the lush island of Madagascar, far from their destination (Africa) but even farther from their home in New York City.  This time the film opens with the later phases of their apparent final farewell to the island via a rickety formerly-downed plane operated by none other than the militant penguin crew.

After a launch that looks remarkably similar to the paper airplane exploits of my youth, the gang finds themselves crash-landed on their original destination: A game reserve on the savannah.  Here the plot becomes a bit bumpy- the penguins (with some help from the genuinely funny chimps) begin reconstruction of the plane that got them here but the viewer isn't quite sure that, as seeing how the gang is finally united with others of their own species in the wild, if the long term goal is to stay or return to the zoo where the adventure all began.

It really doesn't matter though either way because the film wastes little time setting up a whole bunch of subplots/ gags that detract from the greater plot purpose.  Alex finds himself attempting to gain acceptance in his parents' pride, Melman is deemed a profit to the fellow giraffes, Marty discovers that he is simply a clone of all of the other zebras in the herd, and Gloria learns that her voluptuous nature is just the ticket to attracting a smooth-talking hippo playboy.

Of course even the film's writers and directors realized that some of these same old gags (yes Alex manages to tangle with the little old lady again) are a bit tired so there is no shortage of side characters to break up the monotony.  The penguins are back, the chimps, and the lemurs as well.

Ben Stiller really manages to elevate the game just as he did in the first film with his infectious energy and Jada Pinkett Smith (thankfully) seems to have realized sometime between Madagascars that acting occasionally requires you to play someone other than your real life self as Gloria actually has a personality this time around.

The backgrounds are pretty darn spectacular again but, and not unlike in the real world, much more bleached out and open (opposed to the colorful lushness of the first).  There are a whole host of new characters brought into the fold (including one of the final performances of comedic mastermind Berne Mac as Alex's dad, Alec Baldwin as the antagonist lion and the pop singer Will-I-Am (of the Black Eyed Peas) as Gloria's hippopotamus suitor).

In all Madagascar succeeds on several levels but is by no means a masterwork on any particular aspect of filmmaking.  Some of the original gags feel a bit overdone this time but at least the further development of the characters offsets some of this.

As much as I wanted to say that this film was superior to the original, the fact of the matter is that it isn't.  Fortunately it's no worse either.  Rather, what we have here is essentially the same formula of the first film over again: A few humorous moments, some impressive visuals, a few annoying moments, and a bit of soaring prose.  Fans of the original will surely find much to like here but on the same token, if the original didn't tickle your fancy, this one is probably better avoided.",1286064000,3,4630,4.780426599749059

3712380,4,B001NCDFUG,"The movie starts as a prequel and gets the audience caught up to a modified airplane that gets shot out by a slingshot and away we go!  Even before the movie begins, the Dreamworks logo with the boy with the fishing line was cute until he gets attacked by penguins.  Hilarious!

The movie has an overall theme a'la The Lion King, where Alex discovers the tribe he originally came from, complete with an ""origin of"".  The greedy uncle, creepily voiced by Alec Baldwin, tricks Alex and his dad and ends up getting everyone kicked out.  The story is pretty predictable but I think younger kids will like it.

The penguins and the crashing plane scene is worth all four stars, funny!  I don't want to spoil the jokes but the whole thing was played out so well.  The head Penguin's love affair with his spring doll is kinda silly too.

The DVD has other sprecials -- tons of classic rock sung by our favorite Dreamworks characters from their earlier films (Shrek, Madagascar, Bee Movie, etc.) that I think younger kids will like.  A silly penguin game is added which was probably programmed for very young children -- Halo it's not!

Really enjoyed the director and crew's take on the film, what they thought of it, the scenes in studio watching the actors get in character was fun and interesting to watch as well, if you are interested in the filmmaking process, storyboarding and scripting and so on.

I would have liked a bit more screen time with the penguins and the monkeys.  The Gloria love affair with her Moto Hippo was kinda bizarre.  Move-it, Move-it with the plot all ready!

Not a bad package:  Movie, games, several animated rock videos and several ""making of"".  Can't go wrong with this one.

3712382,3,B001NCDFUG,"Funny movie that had some great parts for kids and adults.  Not a side-splitting funny movie, but worth to watch if there's nothing else on.",1256515200,,140,4.6
3712383,4,B001NCDFUG,I am a sucker for a good animated film and the original Madagascar was a very good example of the genre. This sequel retains the charm of the original even if we feel we've been there before. The animation is stellar and the voice work inspired in this colorful film. I love the pop culture references and sometimes wonder if these films are made for adults or children. Fortunately this film works for both!,1254441600,,408,4.527027027027027
3712384,5,B001NCDFUG,"I found Madagascar 2 much funnier than the first one, probably due to the fact the first one focused more on zany dancing scenes.  This one however, has almost no dancing whatsoever (or at least, no lengthy dancing scenes that are somewhat of a distraction because they feel a bit pointless other than to show off the brilliant animated work).  I still love the first Madagascar though.

The lion, zebra, hippo and giraffe have all returned and are honestly really darn funny this time around.  They also act serious when the moment arrives, and it's believable enough that you the viewer actually FEEL for them, so the emotional scenes really work.  It's rare when an animated comedy manages to pull THAT off.

The entire airplane crashing scene was hysterical, and the penguins, while probably not as funny this time around, offered a ton of laughs.

The funniest part of the entire movie however, was the old lady battling the lion by completely kicking his rear-end up and down the fields, haha.  The bizarre and twisted animation showing the old lady do all kinds of wild flips in the air and crazy spin moves while fighting the lion put the icing on the cake for me and made me convinced that THIS is a hilarious animated film and a winner for kids and adults alike.

The story once again focused on the lions, and specifically the younger one that plays the main role.

I just think Madagascar is one of the funniest animated comedy movies you can possibly ask for.  The beautiful and colorful animation is second only to the Simpsons.  Seriously, I'd put the animation on the same level as the almighty Simpsons.  It's THAT good, and whichever group of people was in charge of writing such a wonderful, creative, and inventive storyline deserves some kind of award.  Splendid work all around.",1253577600,,1800,4.727564102564102

3712386,4,B001NCDFUG,"Favorite characters are back, plus some new ones.  Wil.i.am as Moto Moto is great!  Best for older kids, as the kick-butt granny is even more so in this movie.  The knock-down drag out between her and Alex was probably not necessary, but otherwise, my kids and I enjoyed it as much as the first Madagascar.",1250380800,,306,4.527272727272727
3712387,3,B001NCDFUG,"Didn't realize it was PG (why didn't I read the package) until I watched it with my 3 yr old.  Too advanced/mature for him.  I didn't even get some of it.  Very silly humor.  Needless to say, we haven't watched it again.  Maybe when my child is a little older we will try again.",1249603200,,278,4.074074074074074
3712388,4,B001NCDFUG,"But I won't say better.

Sequels RARELY live up to their hype, but this movie was just as funny for me as the first one was.

I enjoyed the extra penguin screen time a great deal.

Surprisingly, the new story line (of still being lost) held up mighty well considering it was a redo.  The addition of new characters and the return of favorites (like Julian) tickled me throughout.

Didn't happen to watch this one with a child present, BUT I do know that the 'Likes to Move it Move it' song is highly popular with the youngins as whenever I'm around my nieces or nephew they eventually break out with singing it for now apparent reason.

Again, another fun family recommendation for all.",1248307200,,686,4.491935483870968

Two scenes come to mind immediately.  Both are near the beginning. 1. Look at the early scenes where the young cub is around a grassy area.  The detail in every blade of high grass is amazing. 2. Look for the scene during the capture when the thick rope is thrown toward you.  You feel like you could jump up and grab the rope right out of the screen.

The entire movie is filled with ""wow, look at that"" scenes and by the way, the movie itself is wonderful fun.  We were dancing to ""you've got to move it move it"" in our living room!

Needless to say, Africa isn't all they expected. Add in a little old lady from New York and you have some serious entertainment.",1244937600,,393,4.383561643835616

3712395,5,B001NCDFUG,"A WONDERFUL animated comedy, Madagascar Escape 2 Africa, picks up from where the first Madagascar film left off; the movie brings to the screen the story of four animals who after escaping from a NYC zoo (and their ""sheltered life"" therein) and end up in the wilderness on the island of Madagascar off the coast of Africa, find passage on a derelict plane only to crash land on mainland Africa. There, they discover something unexpected: their roots.
Madagascar Escape 2 Africa is a film about friendship, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, integrity, and inner strength.
Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jada Pinkett Smith, Chris Rock, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation comes ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all EXCELLENT!
In short, Madagascar Escape 2 Africa is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection, while for those with a major soft spot for animated films, the Shrek and Ice Age movies, Antz, The Ant Bully, Bee Movie, Cars, Flushed Away, Happily N'ever After, Hoodwinked, Monsters Inc., Over the Hedge, and Ratatouille, are definitely your must-see films.",1243468800,,1482,5.024390243902439

3712398,4,B001NCDFUG,"My two kids love both Madagascar movies, but to me they're both rather disposable excepting, perhaps, the hilarious penguins and the wacky King Julian. I own both dvds and saw both films at the theater because of my kids. Neither is a masterpiece of comedy or animation, but I found the sequel somewhat more likeable and watchable. When the boys watch the first film, I always go find something else to do, but when they watch the sequel, I usually sit down with them. In the first film the 4 main characters escaped the Central Park Zoo and wound up in Madagascar. The high point of that film was the penguins as (at least to me) the leads were quite forgettable.  It's no different this time around as the penguins set about repairing a decrepit crashed airplane to fly them all back home to New York. The plane (understandably) crashes, landing the crew in Africa. I found their adventures more charming and funny than in the first movie, and I also noticed that I laughed a lot more. The first film was predictable with mundane jokes and nothing special to claim. By playing up the minor characters (penguins, monkeys, King Julian) this film found more humor than the first time around. Throw in Alex the lion's long lost family and an oddball love story (or two) and you get a movie that's fun for kids and that parents can probably at least tolerate and maybe even share some laughs with their children.",1242864000,,1409,4.591269841269841

3712400,2,B001NCDFUG,The story line is not impressive. It seems that it has been put together in a hurry. It really suffers from the bad sequel syndrome. It is fun but not the quality which Pixar or Dreamworks is expected to put. Looks like some third grade studio's apprentice-like effort. The visuals are good. Penguins are upto their notoreity and the old lady is bashing poor Alex... donno why!!! Some un-natural romantic angles also come up... and the ever irritating king julian is there to move it move it..,1242345600,3,493,4.67816091954023

Theres a lot spent on building up the story, which is hardly a story.  The main plot seems to be abandoned by the movie altogether for a coming home of the ""lion king"". A major subplot about a damn is finalized with little to do, various subplots are more interesting but neither here nor there.  Did they even story-board this movie or just the parts?

Each subsequent happening made me beg for less plot and more jokes?  Admit it, its a comedy and were the jokes fun and quick to come, no one would care about the failures of any plot.  Here we don't even get that.  Sigh.

All said, its not a bad movie and probably fine for a light viewing.  To me it seemed like a so-so effort that had a lot of potential but left me bored.

3712448,5,B001NCDFUG,"Well, so far ""Madagascar"" is two-for-two in the laughs department.  This is just as good, if not better, than the first film.  It's the ""new"" (last 10 years) kind of animated feature film that adults can enjoy just as much as the kids.  In some cases, perhaps like this one, adults would laugh even more because many of the gags might over the kids' heads.  I'm not talking sexual innuendos, just references to things older people could recognize.

It isn't just the writing that is excellent; the artwork is spectacular, especially on Blu-Ray. The colors and the detail are just amazing! Check out all the details on the airplane near the beginning of the film. More than once, my jaw dropped at what I was seeing on the HD TV screen.  Like the first Madagascar, the high-def images are truly spectacular.

3712450,1,B001NCDFUG,"""This movie warranted a sequel"" says Chris Rock in the embarrassing ""Making Of"" short on the DVD issue of Madagascar 2. He doesn't look like he means it, though, and that's because it's a flat lie. The original Madagascar was an OK movie but it was short on gags compared with its Pixar rivals, and rendered with a combination of realistic CGI landscapes and Hanna-Barbera-style cartoony characters that you either loved or loathed. The penguins were a bright spot, though, and together with the chimps they carried whole sections of otherwise dull fill-in between the mild action scenes. Well 2 is just more of the same, except you've now seen all these characters before. The script could have been written by a high school kid with pieces cribbed from The Lion King, and the tension is non-existent. The list of big-name actors who phoned in their hackneyed lines for a stack of cash is a roll of shame, and is likely to give this kind of thing a bad name in Hollywood.
A dumb waste of viewers' time, then, and hopefully another nail in Dreamworks Animation's coffin. This turkey came out while Wall-E was still around, and by comparison looks like a poor episode of Scooby-Doo.

3712454,2,B001NCDFUG,"I enjoyed the first Madagascar, even though in places I thought it just a wee bit inappropriate for children.

For the second installment, the producers seem to have zoomed in on all the moderately offensive bits of the first, and blown them way out of proportion in the second.  I guess they are just doing what anyone who wants to make money will do: pander to base human nature.

But this is aimed at kids, and I kinda draw the line there.

The movie has several instances of suggestive sexual inuendo that go way beyond the border of acceptability for children.

And top it off with the ""misunderstood, underappreciated dancer gets to save the day with his 'art'..."", and a clearly male character who not just suggests gener role reversal, but three times while dressed in women's ""attire"" says ""I'm a lady..."" and ""Which of you is attracted to me?""

And a ""hunky hunky hippo"" getting his Fabio groove on, coming up out of the water with closeups of his ""hairy muscular chest"" and ""tight (but large) 'buns'..."", and suggestive music with lyrics like ""I like 'em big... I like 'em chunky.  I like 'em big. I like 'em plumpy...  I like 'em spunky...""

Can someone please tell me who, at DreamWorks, thought this would be good for children?

And while it's true (like everyone says) that the Penguins definately delivered in this movie, that's just not enough to prevent this being a single-rent DVD for us.",1235347200,8,1408,4.663967611336032

It was King Julien and The Penguins (Skipper, Rico, Kowalski, and Private) who drew the most laughs from my sons in the original movie. So, while the sequel comes with the short film, The Penguins of Madagascar, most of this movie focuses on the main cast of zoo animals - Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo - as they crash land in Africa en route to their return home to New York.

Despite the reduced roles for the supporting cast Madagascar 2 is more than adequate entertainment for young children. However, this sequel solidifies my earlier opinion that DreamWorks Animation films are on a second tier below those from Pixar Animation Studios. Ten or twenty years from now, the Madagascar films won't age as well as classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-E/dp/B0013FSL3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall-E</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ratatouille/dp/B000VBJEEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ratatouille</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredibles/dp/B00005JN4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredibles</a>.

3712456,5,B001NCDFUG,"Hilarious and extremely entertaining!  If you enjoyed ""MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 AFRICA"" in the theater, you're going to enjoy the picture and audio quality on Blu-ray!  Fantastic!

The popular castaways of ""MADAGASCAR"" are back!

In the first film, we learned about how the popular animals that came from a New York zoo ended up in Madagascar but now, the gang try to return back to New York but things don't go quite as planned.

""MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 AFRICA"" is a very entertaining film and the animation just screams of CG awesomeness that can be seen from the hair on Zuba with the white strands among the darker strands of hair to the water and the physics of water and just the beautiful landscape of how the animators really tried to capture the beauty of Africa from its weeds, the hills, the trees especially the clouds.

Also, what was amazing is the number of talent used in this film and I didn't know until watching the special features is that ""MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 AFRICA"" was the final film which featured popular comedian Bernie Mac before his death and that it was screened for the family and even included a dedication for him in the ending credits.

The voice acting was very well done by each talent and again, I am totally impressed by the storyline and how beautiful the film looked and how great it sounds on Blu-ray.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is featured in 1080p High Definition (AVC-encoded) transfer that is beautiful!  Needless to say, when it comes to picture quality, DreamWorks Entertainment has not let anyone down.  If anything, I think there is a high anticipation that the film look great on Blu-ray and the animators successfully have done so.  Detail on nearly everything from the land, the clouds, solid objects, the water, the ground, the hair on the characters.  You name it, they went all out in making sure the visual experience of watching this film, videophiles will just fall in love for it.  For me, water physics is one of the most difficult things for animators to do.  And to see how far they have gone with making liquid look natural, especially in this film and how it reacts and how great it looks is amazing!  I didn't notice any artifacting and overall, the picture quality is perfect!

As for the audio, audio is featured in TrueHD5.1. Equally as impressive as the video quality, dialogue is clear, music is alive (especially how it's used in the rear channels) and a great use of ambient noise.  From the noise of the airplane to several actions sequences especially near the end of the film, really great delivery of audio.  Again, another perfect soundtrack to along with the perfect video quality!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

And DreamWorks didn't stop with the video and audio quality, they also added plenty of special features to keep ""MADAGASCAR"" fans busy.  Included in the special features are:

  * Commentary: Filmmakers' Commentary -  A very good audio commentary from co-directors Tom McGrath and Eric Darnell with producers Mireille Soria and Mark Swift in regards to animation, working with the talent, working with the design team and this commentary features optional English subtitles.
  * Commentary: The Animators' Corner - Unlike the commentary above, you can watch the four via picture-in-picture but this time you get certain animated storyboards and much more including brief shots of the talent in the recording studio.
  * Commentary: Trivia Track - The trivia track well thrown in tidbits that you will see via graphic on the bottom of the screen with tidbits from the film.  Such as ""animators named the clouds as individual characters when they were working on them"" or ""creating the movement of the water was one of the difficult challenges for the animators"" and many, many more information from the film.
  * Featurette: It's a Family Affair: The Cast of Escape 2 Africa HD - This featurette was highly entertaining as each talent was interviewed in regards to their role.  And you learn that Ben Stiller had his children involved in recording of the scenes, as did Jada Pinkett Smith had her daughter due the voice of a younger Gloria.  Moto Moto's sexy voice by will.i.am and much more.  Also, the director and Ben Stiller talking about working with Bernie Mac and so forth.  A very entertaining featurette!
  * Featurette: The Making of Escape 2 Africa HD - An overview on the production of the film.
  * Featurette: Crash Landing HD - A fun featurette in how the crew worked out the storyboard for the crash landing and even coming up with ideas using a couch and how the characters would end up flying around the plane by enacting certain scenes.  Interesting featurette on how that scene came about!
  * Featurette: African Adventure HD - In order to capture the essence of Africa, the director, producers and some staff had to experience it by going there.  Being near wild animals, seeing how they interact, how beautiful the landscape was and trying to capture that in the animation and more.
  * Featurette: Jambo Jambo: Swahili Speak HD - An informative featurette on learning swahili.  There is about 36 minutes of learning various words and phrases in Swahili (especially in how it relates to the film).
  * Featurette: The Bronx Zoo: Madagascar HD - The Bronx Zoo is one of the few zoos to have animals from Madagascar and featuring some of the animals from the exhibit.
  * Featurette: Popcorn Panic (#101) HD - An episode from the upcoming Nickelodeon animated series featuring our favorite Madascar penguins, Julien, Maurice and Mort.  In this case, a no feeding animals popcorn rule has been enforced and the penguins and animals are not too happy about it and try to get their hands on popcorn.
  * Featurette: Gone in a Flash (#103) HD - An episode from the upcoming Nickelodeon animated series featuring our favorite Madagascar penguins and characters such as Julie, Maurice, Mort and other zoo friends.
  * Music Videos: ""Move It, Move It"" Music Video HD,  ""Big and Chunky"" Music Video HD, ""She Loves Me"" Music Video HD
  * Alex's Dance Off HD - If your kids want to learn the dance moves of Alex, this is the way to go!
  * Music Videos: Sing Along HD - Sing along to the songs sung in the film!
  * Music Videos: DWA Jukebox HD - Featuring a music clip from ""MADAGASCAR"", ""THE BEE MOVIE"", ""SHREK 1 & 2', ""KUNG-FU PANDA, ""Over the Hedge"" and more.
  * Games: Test Flight of Air Penguin Game - A point and click video game for the family.
  * Easter Eggs: There are six Easter Eggs according to DreamWorks, I have yet to find them!

JUDGMENT CALL:

""MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 AFRICA"" is an entertaining and highly enjoyable film!

If anything, my son has had ""Madagascar in the Brain"" with his constant singing of will.i.am's ""Move it, Move it"" song and for Blu-ray, Paramount has released animated titles that were just solid in picture and audio quality and ""MADAGASAR: ESCAPE 2 AFRICA"" does not disappoint in any category.

The storyline was well-written, with so much talent involved, each has done a tremendous job for their characters and you really have to give the crew a standing ovation in accomplishing one of the most awesome animated sequences with the high amount of detail from the characters, outdoors, objects.  You name it, they did a spectacular job in making this film look so beautiful!  And of course, the audio is just as spectacular and the music and audio during the action sequences is just as alive.  To top it off, the Blu-ray is just filled with special features galore!

Overall, this is a great example of a perfect Blu-ray release.  Perfect in all categories and a release worth owning!",1235001600,5,7612,4.765876052027544

3712460,5,B001NCDFUG,"All of our favorite characters from ""Madagascar"" are back in this wonderful sequel which is more hilarious and heart warming than the original.  We learn how Alex arrived in New York City as a lion pup and became a celebrity dancer.  Alex teaches us that you don't have to conform in order to be great.  Just concentrate on your own talents.

  Think ""Roots"" meets ""The Lion King"" and you have ""Madagascar:  Escape 2 Africa.""  Thanks to the clever penguins, Alex and his buddies leave Madagascar in a plane that soon runs out of fuel and crash lands in Africa.  They meet others of their own species.  Only Alex has difficulty adjusting to his new life.  The pride of lions won't accept him until he proves his skills as a great fighter.  Meanwhile, the penguins begin stealing jeeps from safari guides to use for parts in building a new plane.  One of the irate tourists happens to be Nana the elderly lady from the train station who referred to Alex as a Mean Kitty while beating him with her pocket book.  This time her character is more developed and she practically steals the show.  She convinces the stranded tourists to band together for survival.  Nana becomes a formidable enemy of Alex and his friends.

  The hit song that we all loved from the original, ""I Like To Move It,"" returns as well as a new one, ""Big and Chunky.""  As contagious as the other, you will be humming and singing ""Big and Chunky"" at work and at play.  In one scene, King Julien, forever the comedian, is in the background singing Tina Turner's ""Private Dancer.""

  ""Madagascar:  Escape 2 Africa"" is one of the best animated sequels ever made.  It is also one of the most poignant.  Friendships are strengthened, love is expressed, and family binds are discovered.  It is an extremely entertaining film for the entire family.",1234828800,,1808,4.636075949367089
3712461,5,B001NCDFUG,"My wife, 3 year old daughter and I saw this at the ""big movies"" as she calls it and loved it. She (we) are fans of the 1st movie and now have both DVD's and she (we) think the 2nd installment is a little better than the 1st.

The creators of this movie did a good job of detailing the back-story of the very young Alex the Lion and how he ended up in NY. They then blended this seamlessly into the end of the 1st movie and the 4 ""New York Giants"" wanting to leave Madagascar. Throughout the movie the used all of the very funny supporting characters just enough to keep you laughing and interested. My favorites are King Julian, The Penguins, and the new character, Moto Moto. Moto Moto has now made it possible for me to say to my 5 month pregnant wife ""Girl you Huge,"" and ""You be Chunkin'"" because of the context in which it is said in the movie without getting smacked physically and verbally. It also helps that she and I have a good sense of humor.

This DVD is in heavy rotation for our 3 year old and so far I haven't gotten tired of hearing and seeing it. If you liked the 1st one you'll definitely love the 2nd. Get it and enjoy King Julian, The Penguins, and Moto Moto's antics. The main cast do a good job as well. Good clean fun to be had..................",1234828800,,1269,4.154471544715447

3712463,4,B001NCDFUG,"The first ""Madagascar"" (M1) wasn't a completely original idea, nonetheless it was a funny bit of storytelling, with giggles abounding. ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" (M2) is every bit as giggle worthy, with the same slapstick comedy that made the original film such a success.

The opening showing the origins of Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller) and how he came to the Central Park Zoo was dramatic and pulled at the heartstrings (especially little Alikai floating all alone on the ocean *sniff*). Then you roll right into the funny with our militant friends, the Penguins, promising to get the gang (Gloria the Hippo-Jada Pinkett Smith, Melman the Giraffe-David Schwimmer, Marty the Zebra-Chris Rock, King Julien-Sacha Baron Cohen, Mort-Andy Richter, and Maurice-Cedric the Entertainer) off the island in an old cargo plane (via giant slingshot, natch!). Of course, the brilliant plan fails, the gang crash lands, and hilarity ensues.

The casting of Bernie Mac as Alex's father, Zuba and Alec Baldwin as his nemesis, Makunga (complete with Elvis-style pompadour) is nothing short of brilliant. Also big props to the concept of a love interest hippo for Gloria, Moto Moto (who likes 'em ""chunky"").

""M1"" is a classic for any animated film lover's collection, and ""M2"" is following closely behind. 4 stars!",1234569600,,1300,5.2105263157894735

Spoiler Alert: There's a completely unnecessary gun scene where someone gets a hole shot in their ear, a scene where a little old lady beats the crap out of Alex the lion, and a scene where a group of penguins purposely hit the little old lady with a jeep.

While we loved the 1st Madagascar the sequel seems much funnier. The 1st one had more of a plot and the story got a bit deeper and here in this one it seems like they decided to hold off on any serious stuff and go for the laughs and in a breezy 90 nminutes or so it delivers solid laughs. The voice characterizations are brilliant and you got to love those penguins. My 6 year olds loved it and we still laugh after multiple viewings.,1234224000,,559,4.090909090909091
3712467,4,B001NCDFUG,"Dreamworks' animated films have not been able to hold a candle to caliber of Disney/Pixar films, but let's face it: who can?  That said, Madagascar 2 is learning from Pixar at the very least.  Animated films work when they are able to successfully blend humor, heart, and a good story to keep the audience sustained for at least 90 minutes.

Madagascar 2 starts in the right direction by presenting a very nice opening featuring a brief origin of Alex and how he got to New York.  It's probably less than 5 minutes, but already set the tone for the heart of the picture, which focuses chiefly on Alex fitting in with his fellow lions.  The other chief characters are also stumbling as they interact with their own in Africa.

Also back is the humor.  I sometimes feel like the movies would be funnier if the penguins had more screen time, but they are still funny in whatever scenes they're in.  The granny who beat up Alex in the first film is also back for some humor.  The humor is better and more consistent than the first.

The only flaw in the film is that it is fairly predictable.  The chracters are a little bit better here than in the first and it has a good heart, but sometimes they don't spend as long on the emotional aspect as they could.  It's still good entertainment and I like to see Dreamworks progress with their films.",1234051200,30,1340,4.44672131147541
