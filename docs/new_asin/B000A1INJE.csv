2349646,4,B000A1INJE,"For a ''Masterpiece'' collection, how can this not include ''North by Northwest''? For shame! This is not so much a masterpiece collection as it a collection of his most commonly known films, which unfortunately includes his lesser good films from the late 60s and early 70s, as well as a few skippable films from the 30s (which is a shame because the 1930s were the years he started establishing himself with classics such as The Lady Vanishes, The 39 Steps, Spellbound, Young And Innocent, etc., all of which are missing here).

If you want a more complete set, I suggest the Premiere collection and the Signature collection (however North By Northwest, which is available in the Signature collection, is bare-bones. I suggest the 50th anniversary edition of that film) on top of this one, which include classics such as Dial M For Murder, Lifeboat, Notorious, Rebecca and Strangers on a Train, amongst others (which are all missing from this set). Also noteworthy to mention, if you want a more complete ''masterpiece'' collection, are To Catch a Thief, The Lady Vanishes and The 39 Steps.

Also, the Universal Legacy Series version of Psycho, Vertigo and Rear Window all contain a ton more special features than the single disc versions of this set.",1409702400,5,1253,4.9336492890995265

2349665,4,B000A1INJE,"There are many pros and cons to this remastered/rereleased Hitchcock boxed set. I overall feel this is a great collection but found a few minor irritations. Mostly in the packaging, and mediocre enclosed booklet.

 The pros are that all have been remastered (all of them were previously anamorphic despite what other reviews have stated except for the first edition of ""Vertigo"" on DVD--read the boxes of the original releases or better yet watch them) and the remastering job has resulted in colors being bolder in many cases with slightly better resolution and sound. There is an exception to this--""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" actually looks worse than the previous release. While colors are good the image clarity and detail are off. I'm not exactly sure what happened here but it must have been during the  transfer process from film to video (and then DVD). This is based on a head-to-head comparison with the other edition of the film and isn't based on a bad DVD. Instead, it's related to the transfer not being quite as good for this new updated version. So if ""Man"" is one of your favorites I'd advise you to keep the previous DVD. Also, there's no paper inserts with chapter stops listed as on previous editions. Also, a couple of films didn't have a huge difference but they were still noticeable for the most part.

The DVDs are housed four to a DVD ""book"" with two on each side one on top of the other. I hated this packaging, as the the card board covers get stuck in the grooves of the crimson velvet box, wearing down the quality of the covers.  I also thought the movie selections were good but some were Hitchcock less impressive films.

Extras are exactly the same as the original releases for each disc. ""The Making of Psycho"" and ""All About 'The Birds'"" which were on the original discs themselves have been relocated to the bonus discs. There's also three new bonuses included. The first is a 15 minute excerpt from the AFI tribute focusing primarily on Hitch's droll comments when he accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award. I've long wanted to have this on DVD but do wish that Universal had licensed the entire AFI tribute as it was a charming and worthwhile evening. The second extra is a 30 minute interview featuring Pia Lindstrom and William K. Everson and is a vintage videotape interview with Hitchcock from the 70's. It's quite a revealing interview with Hitchcock charming the hosts as usual. He discusses quite frankly his likes (pre-production) and dislikes (method actors like Montgomery Clift). The third bonus is a 36 page booklet that, like the booklet  is hardly essential. It does include credits for each movie, some photos and brief comments about each film. It'll be something you might look at once or twice.

The box itself has a crushed velvet exterior and is quite attractive. The cover has a door that slides into the box to access the movies. But inside cardboard covers are cheap.  So the pros are better transfers for most of the films. If you don't have all of Hitch's movies on DVD yet, this is a great deal. The new extras aren't worth the price of admission if you don't already have all of these and while they look better, the difference may not be all that striking to you. With the release of Hitch's TV show and other Hitch classics it just depends on where you'd like to spend your money.

Some of Hitch's finest films are here ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""The Trouble With Harry"" (an acquired taste), ""Psycho"", ""Shadow of a Doubt"", ""Sabotage"", ""Frenzy"", etc but also some of his weaker thrillers as well. It's a good concise and inexpensive way to get them all.

2349683,5,B000A1INJE,"For those first building a Hitchcock collection this is the one to buy.
Bound beautifully in a velvet box, the contents within are the gems of his mid 1950s efforts all the way to his final outing.  (The only 2 missing after 1954's Rear Window are To Catch A Thief and North By Northwest). That's 11 of his modern classics and then add 3 others from the 40s and you have a substantial period covered. Also included are 14 documentaries and 9 featurettes.
At $69 for Amazon Prime it is well worth it and it forms the cornerstone of my own Hitchcock library.  You can read the list of the titles in the product description but, suffice it to say, the best of the 50s and 60s are included, all in tip top restored shape, roughly $5 a film not counting the extras.
The surprises to me are his last two; Frenzy and Family Plot. Even though I owned all of his talkies I had never seen these two from the 70s, assuming he had lost steam by the end. Hard to believe he could be going strong into his 5th decade of fimmaking.  Yet Frenzy is a taught and modern suspense thriller (and maybe too dark for even Hitchcock), extremely well cast and executed. Family Plot is quirky, charming and entertaining, almost a throwback to his British days, and makes a fitting swan song to his prolific career.
The point is, this box set not only includes many of his most well known but others one might not buy individually. I advocate strongly for this late period Hitchcock box set then building your collection backwards.",1383696000,3,1504,4.442028985507246
2349684,5,B000A1INJE,"1948's Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE is a thoroughly enthralling and disturbing look at a thrill killing perpetrated by two prep-school chums (John Dall and Farley Granger) possibly suggested subconsciously by their unwitting professor (James Stewart). This film has often been characterized notably only as Hitchcock's great experiment. He shot it in ten-minute takes contrary to his stylistic use of effective story telling through editing. This was a technique that he also employed to a lesser degree in 1949's UNDER CAPRICORN. However, ROPE is first and foremost a riveting tale bordering on the perverse. The use of color as the clouds turn red as sunset sets upon the city as prominently seen through the drawing room windows is riveting. There is blood on the hands of this duo but just maybe Stewart unwittingly fed to the fuel of their perversity and their decline into human degradation. This is a disturbing tale into the darkest regions of the human psyche.
SABOTEUR is forerunner of his NORTH BY NORTHWEST in this WWII espionage tale planted on American soil. SABOTEUR is an impressive bit of filmmaking from Alfred Hitchcock. He uses his familiar theme of the wrong man on the run from the law and implicated by those who are in fact guilty, our hero Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) must uncover the culprits before they carry out their next act of terror and destruction before he himself is apprehended. Simultaneously Kane must clear himself of the initial crime with the aid of Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane). Set against the backdrop of that familiar icon of freedom, The Statue of Liberty, our hero must undergo a death struggle both metaphorically and realistically demonstrating that we as Americans value our freedoms as well as all human life no matter how malevolent it be because it is in our nature to go the distance for all that is virtuous in the world. Otto Kruger's performance as Charles Tobin is very stylistic and on the surface he seems more sophisticated than our earthy hero Kane but Tobin's eloquence is superficial in every sense of the word. Jack Otterson's Art Direction and Joseph A. Valentine's Cinematography are standouts. John P. Fulton's un-credited Special Effects are impressive.
1943's SHADOW OF A DOUBT is an allegorical study of Americana seen through the naivete of a typical family in a quiet and slumberous community. When evil comes to town in the embodiment of the beloved Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) it is the perceptive niece Young Charlie (Teresa Wright) that slowly uncovers his true identity as the Merry Widow murderer. Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn spend their evenings concocting ways to commit the perfect murder unknowingly under the watchful eyes of the genuine article. Evil takes many shapes and hides behind many facades in broad daylight. Would the wholesome average American community recognize such evil and be willing to deal with it? These are questions that the transplanted Hitchcock would ask about his new home. Another transplant, Dimitri Tiomkin, composed a brilliant score utilizing American idioms laced with the darkness of the tainted soul. This remains one of Hitchcock's best films since it works, as a thriller yet remains a true reflection of a good-natured but generally complacent lifestyle. What is interesting is that Hitchcock shows his usual disdain for police by having the niece foil the Merry Widow murderer and not agent Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey). The vigilant individual is still the screen's most valuable asset.
1954s REAR WINDOW is a brilliant study on voyeurism and insatiable curiosity. Wheelchair bound James Stewart spies on his neighbors in the courtyard from the window of his Greenwich Village apartment. Convinced that he has uncovered a murder, Stewart maintains his vigil with his society girlfriend (Grace Kelly) by his side. Hitchcock asks the viewer about the ethics of interpreting what goes on behind the closed doors of our neighbors, as his courtyard is an allegorical cross section of American society and mores during the 50s.
These are four voyeuristic journeys into the dark regions of the human psyche from Alfred Hitchcock.",1382054400,,4151,5.151111111111111
2349685,5,B000A1INJE,"The progenitors of evil walk amongst us in SABOTEUR.  SABOTEUR is forerunner of his NORTH BY NORTHWEST, this WWII espionage tale planted on American soil is an impressive bit of filmmaking from Alfred Hitchcock. He uses his familiar theme of the wrong man on the run from the law and implicated by those who are in fact guilty, our hero Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) must uncover the culprits before they carry out their next act of terror and destruction before he himself is apprehended. Simultaneously Kane must clear himself of the initial crime with the aid of Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane). Set against the backdrop of that familiar icon of freedom, The Statue of Liberty, our hero must undergo a death struggle both metaphorically and realistically demonstrating that we as Americans value our freedoms as well as all human life no matter how malevolent it be because it is in our nature to go the distance for all that is virtuous in the world. Otto Kruger's performance as Charles Tobin is very stylistic and on the surface he seems more sophisticated than our earthy hero Kane but Tobin's eloquence is superficial in every sense of the word. Jack Otterson's Art Direction and Joseph A. Valentine's Cinematography are standouts. John P.

What is interesting is that Hitchcock shows his usual disdain for police by having the niece foil the Merry Widow murderer and not agent Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey). The vigilant individual is still the screen's most valuable asset. 1948's Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE is a thoroughly enthralling and disturbing look at a thrill killing perpetrated by two prep-school chums (John Dall and Farley Granger) possibly suggested subconsciously by their unwitting professor (James Stewart). This film has often been characterized notably only as Hitchcock's great experiment. He shot it in ten-minute takes contrary to his stylistic use of effective story telling through editing. This was a technique that he also employed to a lesser degree in 1949's UNDER CAPRICORN. However, ROPE is first and foremost a riveting tale bordering on the perverse. The use of color as the clouds turn red as sunset sets upon the city as prominently seen through the drawing room windows is riveting. There is blood on the hands of this duo but just maybe Stewart unwittingly fed to the fuel of their perversity and their decline into human degradation. This is a disturbing tale into the darkest regions of the human psyche. 1954's REAR WINDOW is a brilliant study on voyeurism and insatiable curiosity. Wheelchair bound James Stewart spies on his neighbors in the courtyard from the window of his Greenwich Village apartment. Convinced that he has uncovered a murder, Stewart maintains his vigil with his society girlfriend (Grace Kelly) by his side. Hitchcock asks the viewer about the ethics of interpreting what goes on behind the closed doors of our neighbors, as his courtyard is an allegorical cross section of American society and mores during the 50s. The Autumnal colors of New England seen in THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY are a beautiful backdrop to this dark comedy enhanced by Bernard Herrmann's reflective score. As life comes full circle the quirkily eccentricities of the human heart take on new meaning as an artist (John Forsythe) somehow, perhaps unwittingly, makes it all come into perspective. THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. 1956'S THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is Hitchcock's effective remake of his own 1934 version. An American couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) visiting Morocco have their young son kidnapped as part of an international murder plot which they can not help but be drawn into. Doris Day's performance is brilliant as the mother whose son has been taken from her. Her initial reaction to the news is almost unbearable to watch. This film is very suspenseful and disturbing, as the odds against the family regaining their boy seem insurmountable as the film progresses. This is reinforced by Bernard Herrmann's almost minimal score, which adds an undercurrent of discomfort to the psyche of the viewer. There are some very memorable scenes such as when James Stewart is followed by echoing footsteps in the empty London streets on his way to finding Ambrose Chappell. The suspenseful Albert Hall assassination scenes are brilliantly filmed and edited. The face of Reggie Nalder as Rien the Assassin is unforgettable. Brenda de Banzie turns in a complex performance as Mrs. Drayton. Bernard Miles as Mr. Drayton also gives an effective performance through the various identities he goes through. And that is one of the strengths of this film: people and places are not exactly as they seem. Characters constantly evolve. Some grow in strength while others are mere shadows of virtue. PSYCHO, THE BIRDS, MARNIE, TORN CURTAIN, TOPAZ, FRENZY and FAMILY PLOT all followed and are here.",1381190400,4,5975,5.121926229508197

The unfortunate thing is that when you order a box set that has this many movies, you might not be able to get through all of them in the 30 days you are given for a return period by Amazon.  I've had this box set for just over 30 days and have run into my first problematic disk.  I was watching ""Shadow of a Doubt"" and the movie just stopped about an hour into the film.  I pulled out the disk and looked for a scratch but it was brand new, without a scratch.  I tried playing it in a different DVD player and got the same problem.  There is nothing worse than having a movie quit on you after you've invested all that time into the story. I bit the bullet and rented it from Amazon instant video so I could catch the ending.

2349723,5,B000A1INJE,"I bought this DVD boxed set around the time it came out in 2005. I had already seen all the movies in it, because the content of each disc is identical to the ones who had already been released  individually but with a different packaging near the end of the 90s, even the menus are identical. The only new things are the attractive velvet box, the DVD of bonus material and the price who is really affordable this time. The picture quality of each movie is almost perfect considering the age of the films, in fact most of them have apparently been restored in the 90s by the respected Robert Harris and his team... If I understood correctly the restoration of the movie ""Vertigo"" alone costed one million dollars, and they created a new DTS 5.1 soundtrack for the version re-released in theatres. The only real technical flaw I noticed was a few minutes of the French language track of movie ""Marnie"", where the voices are in english but subtitled in french, I suppose the tape had been damaged... In my opinion the real problem with this boxed-set is the choice of movies... For one thing ""Topaz"" and ""Marnie"" are definitely lesser Hitchcock movies and shouldn't be put between true classics like ""Psycho"" or ""The Birds"", I even wonder if ""Torn Curtain"" and ""Saboteur"" belong there... In any case they're certainly not ""Masterpieces"", and personally considering the efforts Alfred Hitchcock seem to have put making those four movies, I'm not certain he would be that proud of them... ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is hardly a masterpiece either, but since it's reportedly Alfred Hitchcock's favorite movie among the ones he made it should probably be kept out of respect for him... The movie ""Family Plot"" is so boring, it could possibly be put in the list of  Hitchcock's worst movies ... The movies who in my opinion are true masterpieces and seriously missing in this set would be ""North By Northwest"", ""To Catch A Thief"", ""Strangers on A Train"" and ""Dial M For Murder""... I don't understand who wouldn't consider ""North By Northwest"" a masterpiece, with the infamous crop-duster airplane scene, ""Dial M For Murder"" is worth seeing just because of Grace Kelly... It should be noted that every movies of this set come with plenty of supplemental material, including a 45-minutes ""Making-Of"" documentary made in the 90s for each one of them, and sometimes a lenghty documentary about one of Hitchcock's most important collaborators like Edith Head, but no full-lenght audio commentary. The 2-discs ""Special Edition"" of the movie ""North by Northwest"" released recently contain good documentaries about Alfred Hitchcock who should be put there also on the ""bonus"" disc.",1332979200,2,2660,4.908888888888889

I popped the dvd into my player and --- wow. The Cinemax version made the dvd look like it was of vhs-quality. I think I got my recommended daily allowance of fiber just looking at all that grain on the screen for the 5 minutes I watched it. I know these aren't blu-ray and I wasn't expecting blu-ray quality, but it was really bad. Like watching it on a UHF channel on an old black and white tv with rabbit ears. I've watched many other regular dvd's on my tv and they are all of very acceptable quality.

I guess the graininess adds to the aesthetics of the movies. I'm sure that's how they appeared when they were shown in the theaters back in the 50's & 60's and if you can get over it, it may actually be neat to see them this way. And yes, I am a Moviefan, but the quality was just too unforgiving for me. After seeing Psycho in HD I just can't go back. I will pop some more movies in today and check the quality and if any of them are any better, I'll possibly update my review. Regardless, I think I'm going to sell this box set and just wait for the movies to play on some HD channel or better yet, pray they come remastered on Blu-Ray someday.",1325116800,3,1297,4.0271317829457365

2349759,4,B000A1INJE,"This 14 movie, 15-disc set of digitally remastered prints includes some of Hitchcock's best-loved films.  Here in one convenient package are breathtaking new transfers (anamorphic widescreen when appropriate) of timeless, suspenseful stories that brilliantly ""rub fear against hope"" including all time fan faves PSYCHO, THE BIRDS, VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW, SHADOW OF A DOUBT, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, and SABOTEUR.

I saw Alfred Hitchcock only once, near the end of his life.  He was standing in front of his famous bungalow office on the Universal lot waiting for a photographer.  Cherubic and surprisingly handsome in his $2500 Seville Row suit, he was the picture of success.  Everything looked perfect -- except the corner tip of the collar of his white shirt was noticeably bent.

Later, I discovered that Hitchcock had his tailor put an intentional bend in his collar because he was attracted to things that look perfect but in fact are slightly flawed.  He often said, ""a tiny flaw is always more interesting than perfection.""

Although his films usually combined murder, mystery, fear, suspense, and romance, he had no interest in ""who dunnits"" because that was merely an ""intellectual exercise.""  He wanted to trigger emotion in an audience.  Even more than that, he wanted to make them sweat.

Hitchcock's films have a seductive, even fetishistic subtext that's been attributed to his own personality.  Cool blondes in literally painful situations are a recurring motif (often as victims of psychologically flawed but otherwise charming individuals).

British born Hitchcock was a trained artist.  All his films, even the early silents, are carefully composed with an intuitive sense of where to place the camera to best convey the visual essence of the scene.  Dialogue was never of more importance than the flow of images.  And he rarely shot footage that was not part of the final film.  For him, plotting the story and designing the film shot-for-shot was what most interested him.  Shooting the actual film was almost an afterthought since every shot had already been carefully considered and finalized on paper.

Hitchcock's best films can be seen over and over.  That's the beauty of this great collection that also includes MARNIE, ROPE, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, TORN CURTAIN, FRENZY, FAMILY PLOT, TOPAZ and THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY.  There's over 14 hours of special material (14 documentaries, 9 featurettes, commentaries, newsreel footage and more).

2349775,5,B000A1INJE,"BOX DESIGN: a thin slipover cardboard outer part fits tightly over the main felt heavy cardboard disk case housing.  The slipover contains interesting information on the disks and should be saved.  However, it is troublesome to slip it off each time to remove a disk set from the main housing.  The main housing is opened by a nylon pullstrap that opens the housing side.  Four disk cases containing 3-4 DVDs are held TOO FIRMLY by internal plastic slides that are glued to the inner top and inner bottom of the housing.  A book is literally crammed between the spaces and for my case, some pages were folded even as a new item!  The housing is TOO BULKY and I was tempted to throw it away.....  it's tough to remove and put back the DVD cases .... it's impossible to remove and put back the book without damaging it...  Did anyone try the design before manufacturing 1000's of these???

MODIFIED BOX DESIGN:  to make the housing box usable, do the following: (1) remove the inside top and bottom plastic slides by folding one of the holders over a little bit and pulling it-- the glue is not so strong and it will peel off-- this will allow the FULL internal contents of the box to be used.  NOW, the housing can hold the 4 DVD disk set cases PLUS the book comfortably AND 2 more DVD cases -- I chose a couple of previously owned Hitchcock movies-- North by Northwest, etc.  ALSO, cut the thin slipover cardboard (back part only) and make it about the size of the book-- it can be put in the housing also.  With this modification, the housing (very attractive) can hold the full 15 DVD set + book + 2 of your favorite Hitchcock movies in DVD cases and the back cover information.  Try it, you'll like it!

PRICE: This set is well worth the $51 (USD) or 58 % off price that it sold for as a one-day sale item.

DVD cases and DVDs: these are the overlapping disk type made of hard polystyrene with the push-center to release type.  Not my favorite, but these seem to work.  Users generally prefer polypropylene slim-line cases as these are soft and allow the disks to be easily removed. DVDs are labeled and SINGLE-SIDED the way that they should be.

BOOK: some good information/trivia but it could be so much better.  The printing is cheap and the pictures do not match where the book folds.  An introduction to such a fine set of movies deserves better",1288742400,5,2353,4.450934579439252

Not much else to be said except: Point #1) If you are looking for film quality on a DVD, wait for Blu-rays.  The quality of the ones in this collection is good, but not perfection.  Personally, I'm not that picky and what I've seen so far in these is fine.  Point #2) Someone ought to get these DVD marketing departments under control -- Masterpieces?  Topaz? Torn Curtain?  Marnie?  Let's get real.  If you are going to put together a collection of films by one of the greatest and most prolific, you just about have to throw in some clunkers. We know that. We know that to get a true and pure ""masterpiece"" collection will always be next to impossible. So don't try to fool us. The only ones who might be fooled would be novices who want to learn about Hitchcock masterpieces and end up wondering what all the fuss is about. Maybe some of these films could be put out in a ""lesser works"" (like they designate paintings) package to round out the collections of purists. Point  #3) Definitive? That is laughable.  How can a collection be definitive if it doesn't include any of the earlier work and leaves out so many of the legitimate masterpieces?

All that being said, this is a nice way to get a bundle of Hitchcocks for a reasonable price and most of the films are so good. And there are always other bundles which include the films that aren't in this one that can be added to create a real ""definitive"" collection.

Being a film student, my first Hitchcock movie was Psycho and I absolutely loved it. It's one of my all-time favorites. Then I saw the excellent The Birds and the good Rope. Watching only this three films, I realized I need to see more Hitchcock films including the best of him (Vertigo, Rear Window, etc.) My grandpa bought this set for me and has been the best birthday present ever!!! It has 14 films digitally remastered and a bonus disc. I read a lot of reviews complaining the quality of The Man that Knew Too Much but it look good to me (perhaps this is because I did not had the previous edition which is supposed to have a better transfer). I have yet to see all films and the bonus material (and that will take a while) and after that I will update this review with my personal thoughts of each film.

For the moment, I have to recommend this set to everyone who loves Hitchcock or suspense. Excellent boxset with high quality transfers and lots of bonus material. 5 stars.

Personal Thoughts on each film:

First Box:
Saboteur- 4 stars:
This wartime suspense drama is really enjoyable but does not achieve great hights as other Hitchcock films. Packed with many of the  director's trademarks (wrong man accused, etc.) there's plenty of thrills to find here. There's a great amount of suspense that unfortunately get overlooked sometimes because of long dialogues and speeches. Being made during WWII, patriotic values crowd the picture. Robert Cummings is not spectacular as Barry Kane but it's not terrible either. Pricilla Lane is more enjoyable as is the supporting cast on both sides. While the picture suffers for some unnecessary scenes, all is forgiven when the awesome third act comes. The spectacular Statue of Liberty scene is worth the whole picture. Thrilling and suspensful as any Hitchcock film.
Saboteur is enjoyable and has some fantastic scenes (especially the at the end), but suffers from unnecessary dialogue and scenes that drag the picture too long. A good if unspectacular Hitchcock movie.

Picture-3 Stars
Picture is good and satisfying. Some minor grain and artifacts come and go throught the picture, but being a 60 plus year old film, it looks really good.

Sound-3 Stars
No complaints. Unspectacular but clear.

Extras-5 Stars

Shadow of a Doubt- 5 stars
Here is an example of a true Hitchcock Masterpiece. This underrated classic is the reason why Hitch is called ""The Master of Suspense"". A great movie packed with suspense, witty dialogue and great performances from all the cast, makes Shadow a really pleasant experience. Beginning in a simple, happy way, the film goes down taking us and our most horrible fears as it progresses, making us witnesses of the horror that can be inflicted in a little and quiet town. A fantastic nail-biter, no scene is gratious as each one adds to the film suspensful plot. Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten shine as the two leads making this film a must see for any Hitchcock fan. Definetively a masterpiece.

Picture-3 Stars
As with Saboteur, is satisfying but some grain and artifacts come and go thoroughout it. But, for a film this age it looks good.

Rope- 4.5 Stars
A ""failed"" experiment, like Hitchcock used to say, Rope nontheless is an enjoyable picture that delivers suspense with humor (as usual in a Hitchcok film). One of the highlights of the film is the cast. John Dall and Farley Granger are really effective as the two murderers and Jimmy Stewart is great as their suspicious professor. Again as with Saboteur, excess of dialogue prevents the film to be greater but you will find yourself completely taken by the suspensful plot. Another highlight is the limited environment in which the movie plays (an apartment- pretty much like Rear Window) because it concentrates all the drama and the suspense in one single spot which I found it very effective.  Aside from the long takes experiment, Rope also was an experiment in the way that it delt with homosexuality in a sophisticated way, a way that censors of the time failed to see. Rope may not be an instant Hitchcock classic, but it sure will make yourself chop off your nails wondering how it will finish.

Picture-4 Stars
The first Hitchcock film in color, Rope looks great in this new transfer. Some minor grain comes and goes but that is not a distraction at all. Great picture quality.

Rear Window- 5 Stars
Here was the film I was looking forward to see since I receive this boxset. Rear Window is said to be one of Hitchcok's great masterpieces and is absolutely right. On the risk that I might sound repepitive, this picture is now one of my all-time favorites due to the great artistry in it. Masterfully directed by Hitch and wonderfully acted by Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly and the supporting cast, Rear Window shows vouyerism at its peak. Balancing (as always) humor with suspense, this picture delivers great performances with great dialogue and unforgettable moments. You'll be sweating and your heart will be pounding really hard throughout the film. But after it, you will be smiling because you know you just saw an excellent film. MASTERPIECE.

Picture-4 Stars
Rear Window looks really good here but still is not a complete clean transfer. Some grain comes and goes but that will be the least of your problems while you're watching it.

Second Box:
The Trouble with Harry- 4.5 Stars
Here is a picture that seems completely different from a Hitchcock movie. Harry is a comedy (dark) that somewhat feels light in comparison to other Hitch films. So, if you expect tons of suspense and action, don't expect too much. Harry is one of the most relaxing Hitchcock films where you can sit and enjoy without having a heart attack. The cast does not have big names (Shirley MacLaine was not a big name at that time) but serves the film's purpose well and everyone do a fine performance. Vermont scenery is really beautiful and really adds to the film value.
What you can expect, is tons of dark humor that is delivered in a very sophisticated and subtle way. I assure you, you will be smiling throughout the film. A nice lighthearted film.

Picture-4.5 Stars
Harry looks impressive in its vistavision remasterized transfer. Almost no artifacts or grain. Excellent quality.

The Man Who Knew Too Much- 5 Stars
Another Hithchcock classic. I've never seen the 1934 version but this remake is a wonderful picture. I have to say that is an epic movie filmed in many countries and you can see the big budget it had. Again, a wonderful James Stewart is the lead sharing the screen this time with Doris Day. It's the first time I've seen her acting and I must tell you, she is wonderful here. The sceneries are beautiful and the plot will make you be at the edge of your seat all the time. The wonderful song Que sera, sera is an excellent addition to the film and Doris delivered it in a masterful performance. Following the footsteps of Rear Window, The Man Who Knew Too Much is Hitchcock at his best.

Picture-4 Stars
I think this transfer was pretty solid. Many complaints about the quality of the picture can be seen in this site, claiming that the previous DVD had a better transfer. While I do not have the previous DVD, I can say that mine looked pretty good, just some minor grain and even less artifacts. I think is a solid transfer overall.

Vertigo- 5 Stars
Mixed response greeted Vertigo in 1958. Since then, the film has crawled its way to the top and now its being considered Hitchcock masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made. Watching the film for the first time, I can truly said that all the praise is not unfounded. Vertigo is a masterful work that shows Hitch's potential in a 100%. Its plot is much heavier than previous films and is filmed in a grim tone, almost depressing. That really adds to the film's meaning. James Stewart gives here what I consider now, his finest performance as an investigador consumed by obsession. Kim Novak is absolutely stunning in a complex dual role. I don't think Vera Miles could achieve this type of performance. Novak is brilliant. Locations are fantastic as are the details in every single thing in the picture. The score by Bernard Herrmann is so powerful and engulfing, you will be remembering it after the movie ended. I think is his second best score (Psycho will always be first). Vertigo is not a grand scale film like The Man Who Knew Too Much but it is much more powerful and personal that you will want it to see it several times. A crowning achievement and a masterful film.

Picture-4 Stars
Excellent quality transfer with minor grain and artifacts.

Psycho- 5 Stars
What can I say about Psycho that haven't been said before? It's a landmark, fantastic, horrifying film. It's my Hitchcock favorite and seeing recently again it has been a plesure in this new remasterized transfer. Psycho is pure Hitchcock but at the same time is a departure from his usual themes and trademarks that has caracterized his previous films. Here we don't have a passionate story filled with glamour and big budget chases. No, Psycho is a low budget wonderful film that explores the complex layers of the human mind. It's a very unsettling story of love, murder, madness and more. Prepare to be chilled to the bone. The cast is terrific particularly Anthony Perkins as the serious transtornated Norman Bates. Herrmann's score is his best and one of the best of all time. This movie shows how some of the finest crew in the world was at the peak of its game and delivered a masterpiece. Hitchcock's best.

Video- 3.5 Stars
When I first saw Psycho, was in a very old fulscreen transfer. Watching it again in this anamorphic transfer with rematerized quality, it's like seeing it for the very first time. It's a pretty solid transfer despite some minor grain and artifacts.

Third Box:
The Birds- 5 Stars
This chilling story about nature's revenge is still one of the best horror films of all time. Similar to Psycho's tone, The birds is one of the most (if not the most) unsettling Hitchcock film. The clever story is presented as a romantic comedy when, without explanation, it turns to be a dark, scary one. The technical achievement that Hitch and its crew achieve in this film is superb. Dealing with real live birds and lacking the modern technology that we enjoy, they had to figure out how to do a believable plot. And they succeed in every ground. The lack of a score is really effective in setting the dark mood. The birds in the film are not mere animals, they are fully embodied characters that can think and prepare a full scale attack against humanity. The cast is nothing extraordinary but they serve the film's purpose. The Birds is one of Hitchcock's finest and most scary films. Alongside with Psycho, is a movie that will make you jump off your seat several times. Once you see this film, you will never see birds the same way.

Video- 4.5 Stars
The Birds looks spectacular in this new transfer. Some minor grain appears occassionally.

Marnie- 4 Stars
Marnie reunites Hitchock with his Birds star and discovery Tippi Hedren. She does a really good performance as the sexually repressed and traumatized Marnie. It's a far more complex character than Melanie Daniels and she acts it brilliantly. Sean Connery is also good as Mark, his caring but somewaht obsessed husband. Marnie offers you suspense, romance but at the end is a psychological thriller and is a really good one. Herrmann score as in very Hitchcock film is brilliant. What prevents it to be greater, I think is the excess of explanation in the plot and that does not offer shocking moments like Vertigo, Psycho and The Birds. Still is a really good Hitchcock film and it's worth a look.

Torn Curtain- 3 Stars
Torn Curtain has the reputation for being one of the lesser efforts by Hitchcock. After watching it, I have to say that is not completely true. Sure, Curtain is nothing compared to previous Hitchcock classics such as Rear Window, Vertigo or Psycho. But still, it manages to offer mild entertainment and suspense. Unfortunately many problems plague the picture. First, in this film Hitchcock lost many men of his usual crew with whom he delivered masterpieces. His cameraman and editor died and Bernard Herrmann was fired because Universal and Hitch wanted a more ""comercial"" soundtrack. I think that was a huge mistake. Herrmann had proven himself as one of the greatest composers and he had delivered excellent scores in all his Hitchcock film (The Trouble with Harry-Marnie). Firing him was the first of many mistakes with the movie. Other flaws are the characters and plot. The movie begins very slow and little suspense is shown. The first and second acts are rather dull (the murder scene is the only standout here) and makes you lost interest in the film. The third act is by far the best and here you can see that this film is pure Hitchcock. With suspense all over and chases thoughout Europe, here is where the film really rewards the viewers. I think Paul Newman and Julie Andrews are both wonderful actors but here is like they weren't trying too hard. That or the characters were very flat that they couldn't work with. Gone is the chemistry between the two leads that has been a characteristic in many Hitchcock film (Grace Kelly-James Stewart, Doris Day-James Stewart, and more). Andrews and Newman are not able to project chemistry with their performances and they seem uncomfortable between them. Nevertheless, putting aside all this negative aspects, Torn Curtain is not a completely terrible film. In fact, is rather enjoyable if you see past this shortcomings. At least is better than many other films out there and you should be pleased. But not as pleased as watching other Hitchcock films.

Video-4.5 Stars
Torn Curtain looks impresive in this transfer. Only minor grain is noticeable in some scenes. Great picture quality.

Topaz- 3.5 Stars
The 60's saw the peak and the ""decline"" of the Master of Suspense. Although his so called ""decline"" was merely from Outstanding and Excellent to Very Good. Since Marnie (which I actually enjoyed), Hitch wasn't able to connect with critics and audiences. Topaz came after the good but not great Torn Curtain and unfortunately followed that pattern (although I enjoyed this one slightly more than Curtain). Topaz is a spy thriller and the premise is a good one. Unfortunately the movie has some problems. First, the length. Running for almost 2 and a half hours, the film is too long for its own good. Many unecessary scenes and dialogue is present here. Another (minor) issue is the lack of well-known stars (many which worked with Hitch before) and that makes it more difficult to root for unknown actors. The overall acting is good but nothing extraordinary. Many loose ends plague the film, like both the husband and wife infidelities and how they happily return to each other at the end. That takes credibility from the film as does that all the ""cuban"" speak always in perfect english and not only with foreigners but between them when Spanish is their official language . Still, with this shortcomings, the picture has a lot of Hitchcock trademarks and many beautifully elaborate scenes (the best from Cuba). Suspense comes and goes but it will entertain you the whole picture. The ending is the most troubling issue. Filming three endings for the film, I have to say that after watching all three, none of them are completely satisfactory in wrapping up the whole picture. Still as Leonard Maltin says, second-rate Hitchcock is better than first-rate of almost everything out there. Topaz is not an instant Hitchcock classic but like every single picture of him it will entertain you (just don't expect great entertainment).

Fourth Box:
Frenzy- 5 Stars
Here is where Hitch demonstrated everyone that he was still at the top of his game. Frenzy came after the good but slighlty dissapointings Torn Curtain and Topaz. Set in London, Frenzy is a return to the macabre that Hitchcock knew so well and that he did not applied in any feature film since The Birds. But if the Birds was unsettling and graphic, Frenzy is much more graphic than any Hitchcock movie. Here you will find an explicit rape and strangling scene, corpes, nudity and more. No wonder is rated R, but this does not mean is lots of fun. Full of suspense and dark humor, Frenzy is a perfectly balanced story where you will laugh, horrorized and be at the edge of your seat. Here we also have lack of stars but the actors perform their roles extraordinarily well. Frenzy is one instant Hitch classic that deserve to be up there where his classic films are. Excellent film.

Family Plot- 4.5 Stars
Family plot is the last film Hitchcock directed and I must say is a really good one. It centers the story in four characters, all of them schemers but two of them use more extreme methods than the others to accomplish what they want. Family Plot is related to The Trouble with Harry, not in plot or characters but because maybe it uses dark comedy in an excellent way, pretty much like Harry. Suspense is present (as always) but it does not overflows the picture like previous entries. As Harry, Family Plot is lighthearted with some scenes that show peril. Performances here are brilliant, specially Barbara Harris as the delightful fake medium Blanche Tyler. She is the star of the film and makes it a fully enjoyable experience. Family Plot is a nice farewell from the Master of Suspense. Great film.

2349793,5,B000A1INJE,"I'm a big hi-def fan.  I love my Blu-Rays and don't buy too many DVDs anymore.  But I bought this.  The simple fact is that it's a great value, and we don't know how long it will be until each and every one of these 14 movies is on Blu-Ray.  Or if they all will be.  So far we've only now just gotten&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-by-Northwest/dp/B0017HMF6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North by Northwest</a>&nbsp;on Blu, and that's from a different studio and thus isn't included in this box set anyway.

HDNet did a marathon of many of these same Hitchcock movies, and I still had them on my Tivo to compare.  I think they do look a little better than the DVDs do upconverted on my Panasonic BD-60 player.  But I don't think that these are new HD masters from source, with the kind of cleanup we'd expect on a top-notch Blu-Ray transfer.  I think they probably just upconverted them from the same DVD source using better equipment than I have.  I could be wrong, but I suspect this also in part for simple economics -- if they'd spent the money to remaster them for HDNet, I'd expect they'd be pushing them out on BD pretty fast to cash in on it. And as far as I know, HDNet is not re-running these often.

So if you want BDs, you're probably waiting for Universal to decide it makes sense to spend the money on commissioning 14 different expensive remasters and releases.  And even if they do that, it'll be awhile before you see them anywhere close to this price.  And if on top of that you want a nice box set to have them all packaged up, it'll be even longer.  And if you want that box set at a good price, it'll be even longer still.

Therefore, even if you are lamenting the lack of Hitchcock on Blu-Ray and feeling like you should wait for it to happen, I'd still buy this if you're a fan.  Especially if you see a great deal like the Gold Box deal from early November 2009.  If/when some of your favorites start coming out in BD, you can upgrade if you see fit.  In the meantime, this is the best way to be able to enjoy 14 of Hitchcock's masterpieces whenever you want, and at a great price.",1258156800,,2153,4.4910025706940875
2349794,5,B000A1INJE,"Of the collections available, I'd say this is the best, with many of his top movies. Of course, with only 14 movies in this collection, there's sure to be a couple favorites that aren't included, but if you could only get one collection, this is it. Even if you needed to get more than one collection, this should be one of them.

With movies like Rope, Rear Window, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo, Psycho, and The Birds, this collection is already worth it, and there's eight more.

These films span 1942 through 1972, and include some notable stars. You'll find James Bond, Mary Poppins, Cool Hand Luke (the guy, not the movie), the very excellent Jimmy Stewart in a few, the girl from The Apartment, Perry Mason, Charlie's Angels' boss (that would be Charlie), the angel from It's a Wonderful Life, and even a guy named Ludwig.

They come in a nice, felt-like box, which is a little bigger than it has to be, yet takes up much less space than buying the 14 films individually.

I like this collection so much, I'm almost thinking of buying it again, but I really don't need it twice.",1258070400,,1090,4.48989898989899

2349810,4,B000A1INJE,"I wanted to wait until I had viewed all of the DVDs before I wrote this review. I'm not going into any deep detail about the plots or anything like that as many other reviewers do. I don't see the need for this since these films are already so well known.

First of all, I believe that most knowledgeable film lovers will agree that 'Psycho', 'Rear Window' and 'Vertigo' are true masterpieces. Many people would add 'The Birds' to this list, although I thought that one falls a little short. Don't get me wrong, I liked 'The Birds' a lot and it is excellent, but I don't think it is in quite the same catagory as the other three.

One of my favorites was 'Shadow of a Doubt'. Hitchcock named this as his personal favorite, and it is excellent. Joseph Cotton is very convincing as the serial killer known as the merry widow murderer. This film was made in the early 1940s and many people haven't seen it because they have some aversion to films that are made in black and white. These people need to get past this silly issue because they are missing some of the best films ever made. If you haven't seen 'Shadow of a Doubt' you really need to.

Altogether, this makes five films in the collection that, in my opinion, are truly excellent or better. There are several other films that I also liked a lot including 'Frenzy' (another serial killer), 'Rope', (very under rated) 'The Trouble with Harry', 'Saboteur' and 'Family Plot'. 'Family Plot' was Hitchcock's last film and although it certainly will never be considered among his best works, Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris are great, and the ending really made me smile.

There are a couple of films in this collection that I think are just so-so. I know many will disagree, but 'The Man who knew too much', and 'Marnie' just didn't do much for me.

Lastly, this set contains what I feel are two real clunkers. I thought 'Topaz' was a total bore, and 'Torn Curtain' wasn't much better. Both are cold war/spy films that just don't make the grade. Hitch would have been better off letting 'North by Northwest' (NOT INCLUDED in this set) serve as his lone cold war representative. ('North by Northwest' is my personal Hitchcock favorite. Too bad it isn't included.) Don't let my opinion stop you from watching 'Topaz' and 'Torn Curtain' at least once. Both do have some interesting scenes and many folks like them much better than I did. In 'Torn Curtain', I thought Paul Newman did a great job of looking terrified throughout the entire film, and there is one scene that is absolutely riviting. This one scene alone makes the film worth viewing at least once.

The bonus DVD contains very interesting and informative features on the making of 'Psycho' and 'The Birds'. The other DVDs also contain interesting bonus material.

As for the quality of the DVDs; I thought overall the quality was pretty good. I did notice a couple of minor glitches and just a little fading in color and contrast from time to time. These are hardly worth mentioning and it only happened a few times, but I thought I'd better mention it anyway. I have a very cheap and simple DVD player and I really didn't have any problems. Many people complain about widescreen clipping off a lot of the picture, but this can be adjusted on all DVD players with the zoom function. You clip a little of what would normally be seen off of the sides, but people who want to fill the screen can do so. Most of these films are formatted to clip a little off the top and bottom of the screen and that's how I viewed them. I don't know if this counts as widescreen, but the picture size can be adjusted on all DVD players.

I was not overly pleased with the packaging. The DVDs do not have individual sleeves, rather, they come in little booklets, with four DVDs each. I knew this when I bought the set, and this alone should not stop anyone from buying the set. I would have perfered individual sleeves, but at least this packaging makes the set very compact.

THE BOTTOM LINE: I'm giving this set 4-stars because of the packaging and the marginal and clunker films that it contains. I would never pay the list price for this set, and I would not even pay the normal Amazon price of $98.99. This set goes on sale from time to time, and I bought mine from Amazon in late July for $63. At this price it's a great buy, so be patient... it will go on sale again. If you are interested in this set, wait until it goes on sale again, buy it and enjoy!",1253318400,21,4451,4.464944649446495

2349817,5,B000A1INJE,"Fourteen titles. Fourteen films from the American period of Alfred Hitchcock, starting in 1942 and going up to the very last ones, all under the label UNIVERSAL. We will say they are the ripe fruit yielded by a fully mature tree. I will neglect the irritating commitment of Alfred Hitchcock to the political side of self-righteous blindness, the good old western side of the cold war. No distantiation, no relativization. Though a certain use of humor made that lauding song most of the time slightly off tune, but just slightly like the final stanza sung by the mother and the son in the Marrakech hotel in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (1956) that is a midget of half a tone off the tune. It sounds strange and we wonder if the great man really believed what he was depicting in such nave terms. That theme is heavily present in this  collection of films because after the war Hitchcock spent a lot of his creative time serving that side of the cold war. He could have gone back to England like Charlie Chaplin but he did not because he had no problems with that orientation of his, of Hollywood, of the USA. At times we can wonder if Hitchcock was not a bigot somewhere, someone who remained attached to very traditional values just because they were traditional and who was severely opposed to anything that disrupted these values (like the possible perverted and sublimated into crime homosexual tendency of the two young men in ""Rope""). Luckily he did not see the fall of the Berlin wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of the Chinese empire. He could not have survived that kind of trauma. The west becoming second, the USA falling to second, what a nightmare for someone who was defending the idea that the west was number one and in the west the USA was A++. But these films reveal too that Hitchcock was obsessed by climbing up and down, stairs or slopes or whatever, and he explored that side of life systematically in his films, treating that vision as a metaphor of life, insanity, society, whatever. But this obsession that becomes criminal in many films, or synonymous of a crime, a possible crime, a real crime, reveals a fear in Hitchcock and his fear is not so much that of a vertigo but that of something, someone, some authority that is sitting up there in some kind of a throne and casting its lightning ukases and thunder decisions down onto the poor humans under. Don't believe it is God, though Hitchcock's references to God and religion are numerous and very traditional, though at times he may scratch it slightly, but only on the side, like a chapel, not the church mind you, in the 1956 version of his ""Man Who Knew Too Much"". He lives with the belief that there is some higher level and stratum of power over our heads that menaces us constantly like a Damoclean sword suspended over our heads by a mere single hair. And Hitchcock does not try to reassure you by telling you that hair is a sturdy hair from a mammoth or some other thick-haired animal. He is really afraid of that higher tier. It is often political power and crime, the psyche of people and any kind of spiritual power, when it is not the police. That fear becomes traumatizing in a way when he shifts to the cold war since this time this fear of that menace leads him to stick to another power that is roaming and soaring over our heads too, and this time the political power of the west at all costs. Never did he manage to go over that fear and he never reached some kind of Kubla Khan dome of salvation. Even in ""Family Plot"" he manages to keep that dependence to that higher level of authority absolutely intact in front of crime. The endings are thus always good, even when they are tragic, like in ""Vertigo"". The bad one, the accessory to a major crime is frightened by that higher level of moral authority in the shape of a nun that becomes in her vision a glimpse of hell and the devil into jumping and causing her own just death. The art of Hitchcock, and that is what he will survive in our memory for, is the way he creates a situation in two brush strokes and the way he feeds suspense with little spoonfuls of sugar to let our disbelief get to enough suspension so that we can enter this nightmarish though always polished and shiny decadence. And yet that decadence comes to an end and everything comes back into order. He is best when one crime leads to another and then to a third, giving a feeling of total loss in front of that fatality. As soon as you cross a line you cannot come back and you have to go right through to the end that will mean punishment for the culprits and salvation for the innocents. And in that perspective his ability to recreate atmospheres and real situations in all their details is feeding our sense of recognition and our nostalgia when he deals with the past, a past we have known. If you haven't known that past, you can be sure that the slightest detail is right, even the very fruit sold in Covent Garden: they must be from the exact period he is trying to revive.

Unless you're a Hitchcock completionist, it's likely that you would be more than satisfied with this box set, perhaps supplemented by Strangers on a Train and North by Northwest, which are owned by Warner Bros. and thus not included in this Universal collection.

While not every film in this set is a ""winner,"" they are all at least worth a look.  Not to mention that four of them are absolute masterpieces -- Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho, and The Birds -- and that the price of purchasing those four separately is roughly equal to the current price of the entire boxset.  Shadow of a Doubt, Rope, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Marnie, and Frenzy are also all worth owning in my view, and it's worth it to purchase the entire set for those nine films alone, and then you get five others as bonus features, not to mention the extra material on all the discs.

Video quality is great, with all the widescreen films finally made anamorphic.  With regards to the The Man Who Knew Too Much, I've never seen the old disc and am unable to compare, but, while it's not as sterling a transfer as Vertigo, it still looks fine on my 32"" Samsung LCD.

You can get marginally better transfers for Vertigo, Psycho, and Rear Window through the recent 2-disc Universal Legacy releases, but the additional extras provided in those sets seem superfluous, with episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents and a new featurette or two.  What's here is more than adequate and presented quite stylishly within the red velvet case, which is slightly larger than I was led to believe knowing that the discs were housed 4 to a case, but it still fits fine on my shelf.  Some care will be required due to the way the discs are situated inside these cases, but they fit snugly when popped into place, and as long as you don't toss them inside like frisbees they should be just fine.

All-in-all, this is really a superb value.",1228003200,,2019,4.598885793871866

But when the box showed up I was thrilled to see the attention given to making this a classy, sleek presentation of some of Hitchcock's greatest works.  The box itself is of a sturdy build in a gilded, velveteen wrap, and the discs inside come in carefully designed sleeves composed of the posters and advertising materials from the films inside (there are 4 discs per).  Menus have entertaining bonus features and the remastered films are gorgeous to look at.  I grew up watching nasty, pirated VHS copies of these films.  To see them in such pristine condition is like seeing them for the first time.

I am a graphic designer and something of a cinephile, so I was hesitant to buy some random collection of films that I held in such esteem.  I do not regret this purchase.  I'd recommend them for the masterpieces within, as well as the beauty of their design without.

Cons?  I wish there were a couple other films included: North by Northwest and Dial M for Murder to name two. But I guess you can't have everything all at once.",1226966400,2,1264,4.5198237885462555

2349827,5,B000A1INJE,"First of all, I'm not going to review the movies themselves. They are classic's, and flat out worth seeing/owning. This review is about the Box Set itself, the packaging, etc.

Well, masterful is a good word to describe this ""Masterpiece"" of a Collection. The makers of this must of had extreme respect for these movies, because this is the coolest DVD Box I've ever seen. Velvet outside, imprinted Alfred Hitchcock silouette as you can see in the picture. And to unveil where the actual dvd cases are, you open the side and slide it back into the box. Stylish and slick! There are about 4 disks to a case, opening up both ways, 2 disks on one side and 2 on the other, half on top of each other. I could see how some might complain about this, but really not a big deal, it's not going to scratch the disks.

Picture quality is great, menu's slick and easy to navigate. Nice deaf and hard of hearing option too. This probably goes unnoticed by most, by this is nice for those who don't won't to lose how the original portrays the story.

Basically, unless you already own all the other movies individually (in which case wow!), you need to get this. A must-own for any Alfred Hitchcock fan and DVD collection. I'm just greatly impressed about how nice this box is, other makes really need make dvd box sets nicer for the people who are buying them. Really adds a lot to the value and life of the dvds themselves.",1223942400,,1412,4.423076923076923
2349828,5,B000A1INJE,"This collection comes in a beautiful velvet box with a booklet outlining the 14 films included in the collection. It pains me to give my favorite director's films anything less than 5 stars since some of his greatest creations are in this collection. However, I'm rating the box set and a box set like this should have expanded greatly on what is already available instead of just repackaging previously released DVDs.

So, what do you get for your $85.00? If you don't own all or most the 14 films included in this collection, you get the films and the extra features in one collection. But, if you already own these Universal DVDs, the answer is ""not much.""

I already owned all of these films on Universal DVD so as far as I can surmise after going through my newly purchased box set, my $85 gets me about an hour's worth of additional material. On the bonus disc you get the ""AFI Salute to Alfred Hitchcock"" (15 minutes long) and ""Masters of Cinema,"" a 30 minute interview with Hitch. On the Vertigo disc you get the alternate foreign ending (about 5 minutes long). The Psycho disc is the only disc where Universal added any new extra features. You get something called the ""Psycho Archives,"" which is basically just a collection of photographs and a few other minor features (more photos and storyboards and some newsreel footage about the release of Psycho) that are not on the original DVD. Strangely, the documentary, ""The Making of Psycho,"" which is on the original Psycho DVD is on the bonus disc as is ""All About the Birds,"" which is on the original The Birds DVD. All of the other 12 discs are practically identical to the previous Universal DVD releases.

One nuisance with the packaging is that there are multiple discs in each case. There are four cases within the box: the first three cases have four discs each and the fourth has two films plus the bonus disc. This means that the collection is really an ""all or nothing"" deal. You can't buy it and then resell the films you already have. In my case, the only thing really worth keeping is the bonus disc and maybe a few of the new extras on Psycho.

So, if you don't have these films-or you only have a few of them-this may be a good way to go about collecting them. If you already have these films, you'll have to decide if $85 is a good price for about an hour's worth of additional material wrapped in a pretty velvet box.",1222732800,2,2393,4.494252873563219

Although I haven't added these lesser films to my library I still enjoy renting them from time to time. ""Frenzy"" and ""Family Plot"" are a bit darker and more like TV movies than true Hitchcock styled movies. His early works almost seem like TV serials as well with the exception of a few like ""Lifeboat"", ""Foreign Correspondent"" and ""The Lady Vanishes"". I recommend you rent these movies in this masterpiece collection before buying them if you are trying to keep your video library from getting out of control. Good quality DVDs with several extras.

2349845,5,B000A1INJE,"Being that these are Alfred Hitchcock's last two films, FRENZY and FAMILY PLOT certainly seem like a dichotomous pair. The very British, very dark and yet wry FRENZY followed by the very American and very light FAMILY PLOT seem like a curious pair of films to end this director's brilliant career. I think perhaps they represent in an allegorical sense the full circle of Alfred Hitchcock's compendium of work from his native Britain to his adopted United States.

1972's FRENZY is a thriller that harkens back to the type of films he was directing in the 40's that combine his unique morbidity with incongruous humor and the element of the wrong man being accused of something he did not commit. However, the viewer (at least from my point of view) has no strong central character to identify with. Our protagonist Richard Blaney, played by Jon Finch, is a bit of an indifferent and somewhat grating sort of fellow who lacks both wit and charm gaining little sympathy from just about anyone. The true antagonist, the real Necktie Murderer and sociopath Robert Rusk, played with great charm and menace by Barry Foster, is very charismatic and demonstrates cunning intellect and perseverance throughout the film. At one pivotal and suspenseful macabre scene in the film Hitchcock actually has the audience identifying with the killer. The films macabre elements are counterbalanced by Chief Inspector Oxford (Alec McCowen) who must undergo pseudo gourmet meals, which are gastronomically hideous contrivances, served by his wife (Vivien Merchant). FRENZY is a very British treat from Alfred Hitchcock returning to his roots one last time.

1976's FAMILY PLOT was Hitchcock's final film. In an interview with Franois Truffaut, Hitchcock stated that in today's films you no longer had to close the picture with a kiss. The audience no longer needed it or expected it. The romanticism of the motion picture was dead. If not for the performances of Barbara Harris as a phony psychic and Bruce Dern as her taxi driving-detective-boyfriend this film would have indeed lacked any hint of romanticism. In a complex plot that involves the location of a missing heir, the lives of Harris and Dern become intertwined with the villainous pair of this piece (William Devane and Karen Black). Ultimately the film seems more akin to ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS than to Hitchcock's previous films. Yet it seems our beloved Alfred Hitchcock left us with just a hint of romanticism via the wacky on-again-off-again relationship of Harris and Dern throughout this film. The last frame of the film, and Alfred Hitchcock's final cinematic shot of his long career, has Barbara Harris winking out at the audience. Many critics at the time were dismayed by that wink as being hackneyed and clichd but in retrospect I think Hitchcock was just saying that he had a good run and it had all been fun. Godspeed Alfred.",1209168000,8,2886,5.022964509394572

Classics like Psycho, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo, Rear Window, The Birds, Shadow of a Doubt, Marnie, and Rope are shown in restored and clear pictures with excellent sound quality.

The box is a great display case (with a minor problem being that the DVD cases should be pulled out of the slots and put back in carefully, as the edges wear and bend over time).  The extras are what any DVD should come with: still photos, documentaries, interviews, production notes, etc.

The price is also exceptional.  For all you get besides just the DVDs, it is well worth it.  Considering the poorer quality of other Hitchcock sets, or extravagent prices, I recommend this one above all else.  The DVDs are guaranteed to entertain.",1208390400,,1163,4.579710144927536

2349895,5,B000A1INJE,"MARNIE is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. It has been highly underrated and misunderstood by viewers and many critics alike. It is not a straightforward narrative as it deals with the compulsive and obsessive nature of its two main characters (Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery). The viewer has to become absorbed and drawn into the film's sights and sounds. The viewer has to elicit from what is seen and heard to fathom the motivations of the film's two main characters. Some of its images are just unforgettable and disturbingly haunting. Sound too plays an important part in the viewer's experience. In accompaniment is Bernard Herrmann's low-key score. I watched this film again several times over. Herrmann's score is always present, yet never intrusive. I used to think this score was somewhat repetitive, but it is quite diverse. It complements the images in such a way that it almost evokes some hidden and suppressed experience from the viewer that creates an emotional bond with the main title character of the film. I found the DVD print to be of exceptional quality and most pleasing in the wide-screen presentation (a prerequisite in this format).

TORN CURTAIN was Alfred Hithcock's 50th motion picture. This film marked a departure from his most recent bulk of films at that time, not in directorial style, but in the absence of many of his close-knit artistic-technical company he had been utilizing. Distinctively missing is collaborator-composer Bernard Herrmann. However, John Addison does a commendable job in Herrmann's absence, as his score seems to fit this film very well with the passage of time. This was a cold war drama set behind the Iron Curtain. The hero of the story as portrayed by Paul Newman is motivated less by personal staunchness for democratic idealism, but rather by his inner confrontation coming to grips with his own failure as a scientist. This very suspenseful film is really about his own redemption for his perceived failure. This film is has been highly underrated.

1969's TOPAZ was Hitchock's second return in that decade to his earlier spy thriller films. Shot directly after 1966's TORN CURTAIN Hitchcock TOPAZ is a more matter-of-fact tale than a genuine thriller where real lives were at stake. Essentially an American intelligence head (John Forsythe) uses his friend in the French Intelligence (Frederick Stafford) to spy for the United States in Cuba and at the same time they try to ferret out a high French official passing on secrets to the Soviets. Roscoe Lee Browne as Philippe Dubois has the best scenes in the film as he has to get close to the Cubans visiting New York to photograph some secret papers from a high official (John Vernon as Rico Parra). These scenes were what Hitchcock called pure cinema. TOPAZ contains an interesting score by Parisian Maurice Jarre and the DVD contains the 3 alternate endings that Hitchcock filmed.

THE BIRDS metaphorically plays out the frailties of the human heart as befuddled humans' fears are visually juxtaposed against hoards of birds gone on a destructive rampage. Humans rebel against nature and each other as the birds represent nature in harmony turned against human progenitors who stand to disrupt harmony. Rod Taylor's solid performance, as the steadfast Mitch Brenner who gradually realizes (but cannot fathom why) that things are beyond even his control, is pivotal to the progression of the story. The importance of Taylor's performance has been long overlooked. This film is a masterpiece full of vivid histrionics running the gamut of human emotions.",1175644800,5,3570,5.099145299145299
2349896,5,B000A1INJE,"This is a terrific Hitchcock sampler that those unfamiliar with his films would especially enjoy. ""Rear Window"" is probably the most widely known of the four films and Hitchcock at his most entertaining. ""Shadow of a Doubt"" and ""Saboteur"" are great in their own right, however, and will surprise those who haven't seen them yet. ""Rope"" is the weakest of the set, in my opinion, but still is of interest for Hitchcock fans. The other three are truly special, however, and will stand up under repeated viewings.

REAR WINDOW

This terrific thriller from Alfred Hitchcock about our fear of intimacy and tendency toward voyeurism stars Jimmy Stewart and the lovely Grace Kelly and is one of his most entertaining films. There are no crop dusters or other devices to provide the tension this time and it works in the film's favor. Rear Window is a more character driven film and the suspense builds slowly to a fever pitch, a bonafide grab the edge of your seat nail-biter. Hitchcock understood that most people are more comfortable looking at the lives of others from a distance and explores this area of our personalities in a very enjoyable fashion.

Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is a professional photographer laid up in a cast due to an accident while on assignment and Grace Kelly is his doting girlfriend. We should all be so lucky. But Jeff is feeling claustrophobic, not only about his situation but about his relationship with Lisa (Kelly), whose patience and elegant charm as she tends to his needs and waits for him to ask her to marry him are put to the test. The no nonsense practicality of his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) makes for great entertainment as Jeff is bored and begins watching his neighbors across the courtyard through the lens of his camera.

Jeff becomes involved in their lives like he is watching a daily soap opera, much to the disapproval of Lisa. He takes to heart their loneliness and finds pleasure in their finer moments. But something darker begins to take shape when Jeff begins to piece together what he has seen in one apartment and fears he may be spying on a killer. Both Lisa and his cop pal Lt. Doyle (Wendell Corey) think someone is letting their imagination run wild, at least in the beginning.

His own disbelief and Lisa's early scorn turns into an obsession that becomes evermore dangerous for all of them as Lisa begins to believe him and becomes his legs. But the man who may have murdered his wife may believe Jeff has seen too much, putting all their lives in danger. Hitchcock uses his own lens to show the voyeuristic climate Jeff has become comfortable with dangerously changing to a one on one confrontation.

This is wonderful entertainment. It moves deftly from a light and breezy beginning to a more concerned tone, graduating to heart pounding suspense. This is a teriffic and enjoyable film and one of Hitchcock's best. Raymond Burr as the possible murderer creates terror just by his glance across the courtyard at the spying Stewart. Kelly and Ritter give this film its footing, making the events completely believable.

But it is Jimmy Stewart who hits this one out of the park to dead center. He gives one of his finest performances, conveying the irritation of being in a cast and the emotional helplessness when he may not be able to escape the consequences of his own voyeurism because of it. You'll watch this one many times over. A great film to pop in the vcr late on a rainy night.

SABOTEUR

This is a fun to watch wartime thriller about an aircraft munitions worker forced to take it on the lam and find a Nazi saboteur named Fry when he is wrongly accused of the act of sabotage which killed his best friend. Hitchcock's films often get compared unfairly to each other, but taken on its own terms, this is a wonderfully entertaining suspense film with some genuinely memorable moments.

Robert Cummings is excellent as munitions worker Barry Kane, in constant danger both from the police and the bad guys, as he traces a network of saboteurs to a man named Tobin (Otto Kruger) at ""Deep Springs Ranch."" Tobin knows who Fry is but also knows no one will believe Kane. But as Kane narrowly escapes the police and the Nazi sympathizers he is aided by some along the way who can see he is a stand-up guy, wrongly accused.

One of those people is the blind father of Pat (Priscilla Lane), a billboard model who doesn't share her father's faith in Kane. She starts out doing everthing she can to turn him over to the police but ends up falling in love instead, and in just as much danger as he is. There is a particularly tense scene at a huge party as Kane confronts the cool and slimy Tobin but can't expose the house full of secret agents because Pat has been captured and will be killed if he does.

This film has some great moments of suspense. One such moment, is a plea for help written in lipstick from a trapped Pat, floating down a skyscraper in New York, waiting to be found. The troop of a circus sideshow play a part in the couple's plight also, as his quest to clear himself takes him from Boulder Dam to Rockefeller Center to the Statue of Liberty.

There is a tight and witty script from Dorothy Parker, among others, and Hitchcock's famous little touches keep this one interesting. Robert Cummings, who had proved himself in comedy the previous year in ""It Started With Eve"" with Deanna Durbin, showed his versatility in this film. Priscilla Lane, pretty and likable, gives another nice performance here.

Taken on its own merits, this is a really good film, a great popcorn movie for a rainy night or a lazy weekend. There's nothing wrong with that.

SHADOW OF A DOUBT

Teresa Wright truly shines in Hitchcock's tale of darkness and evil coming to stay in Santa Rosa, California. A story by Gordon McDonnell was adapted for the screen by Thorton Wilder, Alma Reville, and Sally Benson and this slice of Americana is played out perfectly by a wonderful cast.

Teresa Wright is the bored young daughter of Emma (Patricia Collinge) and Joseph (Henry Travers) Newton. Life for her in the small town of Santa Rosa has become boring for the wholesome American girl. Wright's ""Charlie"" is the picture of lovely innocence that matches her small town.

The change she desires to shake things up comes to town in the form of her namesake, Uncle Charle (Joseph Cotten). Hitchcock has shown the audience that something is not quite right for the charming Uncle Charlie, however. But the special bond between he and Charlie will not be broken easily. Their unusual connection is explored in the happy and charming moments after Cotten's arrival.

Charlie's adoration of her uncle borders on a crush and leaves her open and vulnerable to anything Charlie wants. Hitchcock creates some almost uncomfortable scenes as you get the feeling any moment Cotton might just take the smiling and adoring Charlie in his arms and kiss her. And Charlie might remain passive if he were to do so, unsure of her feelings.

But strange behavior in her uncle and the attentions of a government agent after him who falls in love with her will change everything and break Uncle Charlie's spell, revealing a warped and twisted view of the world. The tune he whistles is the key to what Charlie has become in the years he has been absent.

Hume Cronyn steals every scene he is in as Joseph's good pal and mystery lover, Herbie. Their long talks on the porch as the two attempt to devise the perfect murder plays in humorous contrast to the real evil right under their noses. Even once Charlie knows about her uncle she can not tell and destroy her weak mother. But she has Agent Jack Graham's (Macdonald Carey) number and may have to use it when Uncle Charlie realizes the only thing standing between he and the gallows is young Charlie.

This is both a beautiful portrait of small-town America and a suspenseful thriller. Cotten underplays his role to marvelous effect and Teresa Wright is simply wonderful in this Hitchcock masterpiece. You'll have hours of fun and become a Hitchcock fan for certain after viewing this fabulous sampler of one of the great directors.",1174176000,3,8110,4.69247009148487

1.  Saboteur

Date:1942

Rateing: 6/10

Opinion: The oldest one of all the movies, and one of the few in black and white, and it  has some memorable scenes, most memorably, the Statue of Liberty scene.  But, it has its flaws.  The plot revolves around a man who is framed for firebombing a World War II airplane factory, by Nazis.  Then the flaws kick in,

 a sometimes wooden script, unatractivce female co-stars (the female star looked pretty good), and an offten stupid main charecter, and the traveling sideshow(Why is that there?).  Despite its flaws, its still a good movie.

2.  Shadow of a doubt

Date:1943

Rateing: 4/10

Opinion: Alfred Hitchcocks favorite movie, and one of my least favorites.  Its plot revolves a young girl (Charlie), who's uncle(also Charlie) may or may not be a serial killer, the marry widow murder.  Its not that interesting, the charecters are not that indearing, the story is slow, so slow.  But its not without its charms, such as the ending train scene, and Uncle Charlie.  Oh well, its in there.

3.  Rope

Date:1948

Rateing: 8/10

Opinion: The first color Hitchcock film, filmed exclusively in one room, in ten, seamless takes.  The plot revovles around two men(Brandon and Phillip), who decide they are better then God, and kill one of their ex-collage class mates(David), stuff his body into a trunk, then serve food off his coffin.  An ex-proffeser of their's though, knows somethings wrong.  The plot is exciting for some one who is anti-nietchze, and read about the Leopold and Loeb case of the 20's.  The slow parts happen when ever the two boy's are alone, because they can't bounce off other's personality's.  The movie was panned when released, and has only recently been re-discovered as a classic.  Oh well, I like it.

4.  Rear Window

Date:1954

Rateing: 10/10

Opinion: Wham, my personal favorite, and Jimmy Stewarts favorite Hitchcock.  The plot is about a photographer, (L.B. Jeffery's) who is stuck in a wheel chair, due to breaking his legs, and is confined to a two room apartment, a single window his only escape.  While looking out the window, Jeffery's spies across the court yard, a possible murder, and he and his girlfriend (From top to bottom, Lisa Carol Freemont), have to find out what happened.  Along with that, their are five sub plots, the married salesman and his invalid wife, the beutifull Miss. Torso who dnaces in her underwear,  The newlywead couple who seem perfect for each other, the middle aged couple who's life has the commitment that Jeffery's fears, and the musician who keeps playing the same song over again, and Miss Lonley Hearts who is dying alone, are perfect for each other and don't know it.  The plot is exciting, and the scene where we first see Grace Kelly is one of the best in Cinema.  Lisssssaaaaa

p.s. The Song playing in the movie, by the musician, is proof of Lisa and Jeffery's destney.  The song is Lisa's Song.

5.  The Trouble with Harry

Date:1955

Rateing: 7/10

Opinion: Slow at first, the movie grows on you.  The plot revolves around four people who stumble on a corpse named Harry.  Every time they get rid of him, and burry him, something forces them to dig Harry up.  This movie is, a comedy, which is something diffrent from Hitchcock, and, the more times you watch it, the better it is.  A stupid plot, but great charecters, and the first operience of crazy, but beutiful Shirley Mclane.  And, the first music score from the amazing Bernard Herrmann.

6.  The Man Who Knew Too Much

Date:1956

Rateing: 9/10

Opinion: One of the most exciting Hitchcock films produced, a remake of one of his earlier films.  The plot of this one involves an American familly vacationing in Turkey.  While their, a spy dies, in the husband's arms, and tells the two of them that a European Ambassador will be assinated.  Before they can do any thing, their son is kidnapped.  The Albert Hall scene is very well filmed, and much better then in the first.  The first version of this film is avalible on the internet, and isn't worh a crap.  It lacks the music of the second film, (Que Sara, Sara).  The music, so great, became another charecter.  Thanks Bernard Herrmann.

7.  Vertigo

Date:1958

Rateing: 5/10

Opinion: Conssidered one of Hitchcocks greats, this one never at right with me.  The plot involves an ex-cop, who is asked by a friend to trail his wife, who may try to kill herself.  The problem is, he has a parilizing fear of hights.  The Music isn't as good, and the plot is unbelievable, but the opening credits are worth 5/10.  Last Hitchcock with Jimmy Stewart (Rope,The Man Who Knew Too Much, Rear Window).  We say, adue!

8.  Psycho

Date:1960

Rateing: 10/10

Opinion: You've been waiting for this, the greatest Hitchcock ever produced, if not, then the most famous.  The Plot is divided in two parts.  The first part involves Marion Crane, who steals $40,000 to bail her boyfriend out of debt.  She ends up at he Bates Motel, with Creepy old Norman Bates, and even crazier Mrs. Norma Bates.  Then, the shower.  The second part would give away the movie.  All I'll say is don't take a shower.

9.  The Birds

Date:1963

Rateing: 9/10

Opinion: This one is also great and timeless, Hitchcocks unusual, unending terror.  The story was adapted from a short story by Daphne du Maurier, and the name explains itself.  The Birds is the first movie with Tippi Hedren, who was allmost the next Grace Kelly, and who would apear in Marnie.  The movie though could have been better with the original ending, which was a shot of the Golden Gate Brige, covered with birds.  But, the scene's when the bird's attack, the school scene in perticuler, are very well filmed.  Bravo!

10.  Marnie

Date:1964

Rateing: 2/10

Opinion: Oh, how the mighty have fallen.  After Hithcock directed three brilliant movies (North by Northwest, Psycho, and The Birds), this stinker came out.  Its the story of Marnie, a complusive theif, who tries to steal from her boss (played by Sean Connery[Who isn't American, or good at pertending to be]), who then shows his cronic bad chocies by blackmailing her into marring him.  Marine is scared of red, and lightning, making the movie amerture hour(two hours, four muinets) of thearpy.

11.  Torn Curtain

Date:1966

Rateing:7/10

Opinion: The last time Hitchcock and Herrmann worked together, as they had a falling out during the movie.  Oh well, its still got a good story.  The plot involves a professor and his wife going to East Germany, where the professor attempts to steal Soviet missle formulas.  The plot drags for a bit, but its exciting.  The escape is very well done, not overly complicated, and at the end, you cheer for the hero's.

12.  Topaz

Date:1969

Rateing:0/10

Opinion: Possibley the worst movie I've ever seen, the plot is non-existent, something about Cuba and missles and the French, and spies named Topaz.  The plot has no star, the person who was suposed to star (John Forsythe), was in the movie for tweenty muinets.  Then, some dull French Man, who isn't French, sleeps with a Cuban woman, who he's met before, but doesn't know.  Then, random people die.  And, it goes on for two hours and tweenty muinets (augh)!  Don't watch this, if you do, take the following clensing steps.

1.  Kill Self

2.  Repeat

13.  Frenzy

Date:1972

Rateing:8/10

Opinion: The first true serial killer flick, that opened the door for Halloween, and Silence of the Lambs.  The plot is about a man who is framed for being a serial killer called the Neck Tie Murderer, and now has to figure out who framed him.  Trust me, this is a good movie, and the first film in England, since Stage Fright (1950).  Memorable for the qoate of the day, ""Mr. Rusk, you're not wearing your tie"".  A classic, enjoy.

14.  Familly Plot

Date:1976

Rateing:9/10

Opinion: The last Hitchcock film, he had a pacemaker while directing this.  The plot revolves a fake psychic, and her boyfrined who figure out that they can make $10,000 by tracking down the nephew of a rich women.  The nephew though, has grown up to be a murder and a jewl theif.  Barbra Harris is so cute, she makes me drool.  The last Hitchcock, the last Hitchcock classic, enjoy.

p.s., Barbra Harris's wink at the end was improvised, and Hitchcock let her keep it!(wink)

The Set contains his big hits such as Psycho, The Birds and Vertigo but it also has some films that you may have heard very little to nothing about.

The Set Contains ""Psycho"" which I believe to be his best film. It is absolutly brilliant and is arguably THE best horror/thriller movie ever made, it contains the most widely known and popular scene on the big screen and is absolutly marvolously displayed on the DVD set.

I like all but one of these films and there are several that are fantastic!

I couold go on and on about how good some of these films are but I am pretty sure that you have already heard that ... One thinkg that I would like to put my two cents in about is the digital tech. and sound. The film is remastered and is very well put together all around, the sound is very clear and crisp.

2349924,5,B000A1INJE,"I am happy to say that, in spite of many scathing reviews of this box set, this collection of Alfred Hitchcock films is excellent in every way. I love the velvet box the disks are kept in and the cases (three or four DVDs to a case) are attractive (with poster art adorning the covers) and compact, keeping this set from being huge as it could have been, and I appreciate that. Although some people have complained of the picture and audio quality of the disks in comparison to the previous editions, I have to say that they are the same as before, not worse, and that is fine by me. The difference that I can see is that those films that were not previously anamorphic widescreen are now and that is reason to celebrate. Also the set is a deal, 15 disks for $90 is about $6 a disk and you can't beat that. Included in the set is Hitchcock's personal favorite Shadow of a Doubt, the interesting ""one shot"" experiment Rope, the classic Rear Window and delicious black comedy The Trouble with Harry, the masterpieces Vertigo and Psycho, the chilling The Birds and Frenzy, to the underrated Marnie and Torn Curtain, his final film Family Plot and much more!!",1129593600,60,1155,4.478672985781991
2349925,5,B000A1INJE,"For anybody who has not brought these films at the individual list price of $29.95, then this box set has to be considered (at under $6.00 a film) the deal (or steal) of the century.

The problem is that probably every Hitchcock fan has already purchased all or most of these films - as I did, at those advanced prices, and doesn't want to lay out any more cash. But anyone living in a major city should easily be able to get at least $6.00 a disc for their old Hitchcock DVD's at any used DVD store, and in the process they would actually be saving money and be getting a beautifully packaged box set in the process, along with a nice booklet, and the bonus of an extra disc.

Unfortunately, the extra disc, only includes (to Universal's disgrace) a mere 15 minute excerpt from the AFI life acheivement award to Hitchcock - that includes comments from Ingrid Bergman and Jimmy Stewart, as well as Hitchcock's complete acceptance speech. But missing are all the other speakers, like Janet Leigh, Francois Truffaut, John Forsythe, Anthony Perkins, etc.

This is my biggest complaint, because the entire 105 minute  program was easily one of the best AFI shows ever produced. So why couldn't they include the entire program on the bonus disc?

However, that aside, the bonus disc is offset by the incredible interview segements with Mr. Hitchcock, which only runs about 33 minutes, but includes comments from the master that have never been heard before. For a director like Hitchcock, who had been endlessly interviewed, I expected this to be a repeat of comments Hitchcock had made many times elsewhere. But guess what?  These 33 minutes of interview are almost entirely new material!  Most of Hitchcock's comments are entirely fresh, and not in the Truffaut interview book, or anywhere else, for that matter, making them very valuable indeed.

Kudos go the two interviewers, Pia Lindstrom (Ingrid Bergman's daughter) and the esteemed film collector William K. Everson for not following the same old paths and asking Hitch the kinds of questions (as Richard Schickel did in his documentary on Hitchcock for the PBS series, ""The Men who Made the Movies"" which basically repeated everything about Hitchcock that everyone was already familiar with who had read the Truffaut/Hitchcock book).",1129593600,110,2287,4.922077922077922

THE YEAR OF PRODUCTION IS BURIED IN THE BOOKLET AND THE MUSIC INTRODUCING THE FILM IS FROM HITCHCOK'S TV SHOW, AGAIN A VERY UNFORTUNATE CHOICE.

2349927,4,B000A1INJE,"O.K., I have the box set in my hands, and although I have not watched every movie I have scanned them all in order to write the review. I am not reviewing the movies themselves, just trying to clear up some of the confusion that seems to be surrounding this release.

First, the technical info is as follows:

The Birds, Marnie, The Trouble with Harry, Topaz, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Torn Curtain, Frenzy, and Family Plot are all Dolby 2.0, 1.85 Widescreen, Color.

Vertigo is Dolby 5.1, 1.85 Widescreen, Color

Rope, Shadow of a Doubt and The Bonus Disc are Dolby 2.0, 1.33 Full Frame, Color.

Rear Window is Dolby 2.0, 1.66 Widescreen, Color.

Psycho is Dolby 2.0, 1.85 Widescreen, B&W.

Saboteur is Dolby 2.0, 1.33 Full Frame, B&W

I actually thought the velvet box was rather nice, and I didn't mind the four discs to a sleeve. The booklet is very nice, printed with lots of color on heavy stock and includes trivia and facts on each movie.

I read a review that said one of the films didn't look as good as the others, so when I scanned them I tried to pay particular attention to the picture quality. I found all of the movies to be crisp and clean, so I would suggest maybe there was a bad disc in his box set (?).

My only negative is that only Vertigo is remastered in Dolby 5.1. I just don't understand digitally remastering the films and not the soundtrack.

However, the amount of brilliant filmmaking included in this collection is almost overwhelming. Every film is a treasure, and it's filmmaking that has rarely been equaled, let alone surpassed.

Look, everyone is always going to have something to complain about (didn't like the package, the sleeves, hasn't done justice to the master), even myself with the soundtrack issue, but Universal has put together a 15 disc package of great films for $84.00. What's that...$5.60 a disc?

If you are on the fence on this one, just click ""add to cart"" and go to checkout. This is the deal of a lifetime.",1128902400,296,1966,4.519774011299435
2349928,5,B000A1INJE,"If you are an avid Hitchcock connoisseur like myself, I highly recommend this box even if you already own these individually.

Very well put together and the incredible use of vintage (domestic and foreign) posters on the volumes within rules. Plenty to look at and some new material about (1 hour), but the films and menus are basically the same. It's just nice to see someone at Universal(obviously not some 20 something)put alot of thought into this box and it shows. Given the sad state of mainstream cinema today, it's quite nice to see the classic stuff

get a packaging overhaul. So go ahead and treat yourself, this box is definetly worth it AND more... (By the way, PSYCHO looks REALLY good. The old edition had been mastered with alot more grey tones to cover film blemishes. This new edition is high contrast B/W and grainy like it should be! Transfers on the rest rules as well!)",1128902400,5,891,4.6687898089171975
2349929,4,B000A1INJE,"PLEASE NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THE BLU-RAY BOXED SET BUT FOR THE DVD BOXED SET.

There are both pros and cons to this remastered/rereleased Hitchcock boxed set. The pros are that all have been remastered (all of them were previously anamorphic despite what other reviews have stated except for the first edition of ""Vertigo"" on DVD--read the boxes of the original releases or better yet watch them)and the remastering job has resulted in colors being bolder in many cases (Do a comparison as I did)with images being crisper and with slightly better resolution. There is an exception to this--""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" actually looks worse than the previous release. While colors are good the image clarity and detail are off. I'm not exactly sure what happened here but it must have been during the Telecine transfer process from film to video (and then DVD). This is based on a head-to-head comparison with the other edition of the film and isn't based on a bad DVD. Instead, it's related to the transfer not being quite as good for this new updated version. So if ""Man"" is one of your favorites I'd advise you to keep the previous DVD. Also, there's no paper inserts with chapter stops listed as on previous editions. Also, a couple of films didn't have a huge difference but they were still noticeable for the most part.

The DVDs are housed four to a DVD ""book"" with two on each side one on top of the other. I know what you're thinking--they'll get scratched--but I didn't notice any potential for that. Still, you'll need to be careful taking them out and putting them in and these holders are not as secure as the individual keep cases. Each cover is decorated with images from the original posters for each movie overlapping each other.

Extras are exactly the same as the original releases for each disc. ""The Making of Psycho"" and ""All About 'The Birds'"" which were on the original discs themselves have been relocated to the bonus discs. There's also three new bonuses included. The first is a 15 minute excerpt from the AFI tribute focusing primarily on Hitch's droll comments when he accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award. I've long wanted to have this on DVD but do wish that Universal had licensed the entire AFI tribute as it was a charming and worthwhile evening. The second extra is a 30 minute interview featuring Pia Lindstrom and William K. Everson and is a vintage videotape interview with Hitchcock from the 70's. It's quite a revealing interview with Hitchcock charming the hosts as usual. He discusses quite frankly his likes (pre-production) and dislikes (method actors like Montgomery Clift). The third bonus is a 36 page booklet that, like the booklet that came with ""Jaws"", is hardly essential. It does include credits for each movie, some photos and brief comments about each film. It'll be something you might look at once or twice.

The box itself has a crushed velvet exterior and is quite attractive. The cover has a door that slides into the box to access the movies. So the pros are better transfers for most of the films. If you don't have all of Hitch's movies on DVD yet, this is a great deal. The new extras aren't worth the price of admission if you don't already have all of these and while they look better, the difference may not be all that striking to you. With the release of Hitch's TV show and other new stuff coming out, it's a matter of spending where one can.

I gave this set 4 stars for two reasons; 1) There are a number of so-so Hitchcock films in this set (""Torn Curtain"", ""Topaz"", ""Marnie"" which is one that, despite Robin Wood's absurd arguments to the contrary, I find to be substandard Hitchcock and the enjoyable but light ""Family Plot""). 2)""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" should look BETTER than the previous edition but, in fact, looks a bit worse for the wear with less clarity and definition. 3)While we do some some new extras they are slim pickings. I would have loved to get more commentary tracks on these classic films from Hilton Green (Assistant Director on ""Psycho"" and a number of Hitch's TV episodes), Bruce Dern or Karen Black (on ""Family Plot"") and others on the important films.

Some of Hitch's finest films are here ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""The Trouble With Harry"" (an acquired taste), ""Psycho"", ""Shadow of a Doubt"", ""Sabotage"", ""Frenzy"", etc but also some of his weaker thrillers as well. It's a good concise and inexpensive way to get them all.",1128816000,380,4463,4.693486590038314
2349949,4,B000A1INJE,"I have been fairly tolerant of the Studios' habit of ""double dipping"" (and more) with certain titles.  This one takes the cake, though.  I paid $100 to basically get the AFI Salute To Alfred Hitchcock on the bonus disc.  What I got was a 15 minute excerpt from the show.  Needless to say, I'm very disappointed.  Others have stated that several titles for this set have been ""remastered.""  Other than the ""anamorphic"" transfers for PSYCHO, VERTIGO, and REAR WINDOW, there's not that much ""new"" here.  Shame on Universal/NBC!  Beware anyone wanting to get the complete AFI SALUTE TO ALFRED HITCHCOCK!  This set is really a rip-off.  I've never had this opinion before, so this is really saying something.  They should openly advertise that this set includes only a 15 minute excerpt from the AFI SALUTE!",1128729600,9,802,4.866666666666666
2349950,3,B000A1INJE,"This collection comes in a beautiful velvet box with a booklet outlining the 14 films included in the collection.  It pains me to give my favorite director's films anything less than 5 stars since some of his greatest creations are in this collection.  However, I'm rating the box set and a box set like this should have expanded greatly on what is already available instead of just repackaging previously released DVDs.

So, what do you get for your $85.00? If you don't own all or most the 14 films included in this collection, you get the films and the extra features in one collection. But, if you already own these Universal DVDs, the answer is ""not much.""

I already owned all of these films on Universal DVD so as far as I can surmise after going through my newly purchased box set, my $85 gets me about an hour's worth of additional material. On the bonus disc you get the ""AFI Salute to Alfred Hitchcock"" (15 minutes long) and ""Masters of Cinema,"" a 30 minute interview with Hitch. On the Vertigo disc you get the alternate foreign ending (about 5 minutes long). The Psycho disc is the only disc where Universal added any new extra features. You get something called the ""Psycho Archives,"" which is basically just a collection of photographs and a few other minor features (more photos and storyboards and some newsreel footage about the release of Psycho) that are not on the original DVD. Strangely, the documentary, ""The Making of Psycho,"" which is on the original Psycho DVD is on the bonus disc as is ""All About the Birds,"" which is on the original The Birds DVD. All of the other 12 discs are practically identical to the previous Universal DVD releases.

One nuisance with the packaging is that there are multiple discs in each case. There are four cases within the box: the first three cases have four discs each and the fourth has two films plus the bonus disc. This means that the collection is really an ""all or nothing"" deal. You can't buy it and then resell the films you already have. In my case, the only thing really worth keeping is the bonus disc and maybe a few of the new extras on Psycho.

So, if you don't have these films-or you only have a few of them-this may be a good way to go about collecting them. If you already have these films, you'll have to decide if $85 is a good price for about an hour's worth of additional material wrapped in a pretty velvet box.",1128643200,26,2395,4.494252873563219
2349951,5,B000A1INJE,"Unlike what some have claimed, this set is most definitely remastered and not just a simple ""repackaging"" of previously-released versions.

I have purchased and confirmed that indeed, movies such as Vertigo and Psycho which were not anamorphic in their prior release are indeed anomorphic widescreen in this release. And, the menus have been updated, etc.

Not all movies in this set are anamorphic - because not all were released in widescreen format.

However, the anamorphic/widescreen releases in this set are: The Birds, Marnie, Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Torn Curtain, Frenzy, Family Plot, The Trouble with Harry, and Topaz.

The set would have been ""flawless"" if it included North by Northwest, but I suspect that it wasn't because this title is owned by Warner, not Universal (who released this set).",1128643200,23,838,5.185185185185185

Rear Window is described as being in 1:66 aspect ratio. Well, on my widescreen set it fills the screen, so.... Hmmmmmmm. Oh well, that's really only a minor quibble. Although, if any director in cinema history deserves to have his movies viewed in their exact aspect ratio it's Hitchcock. Also, the set touts the inclusion of the AFI tribute to Hitchcock. Better to say it's a greatly abreviated version of it. First of all, there are NO clips. And I know they cut out more than just that. I remember Ingrid Bergman having a delightful anecdote regarding the key that was the center of one of Hitchcock's more famous crane shots from Notorious. And then she produced the very same key and presented it to Hitchcock. Great! That's what I remember. There had to be a lot of other stuff cut out. Grrrrrr! But it does leave in Hitchcock's finest hour - his wonderful (and quite sincere) tribute to his wife, Alma Reville. I'm certainly glad I got the set.

-now for my 2 cents on this box set. Like others have already said in one way or the other. This is just the Universal releases all in one package (a very tasteful looking box, in my opinion). However, I can't believe how much the price has dropped! Too bad I spent all that money buying these individually. So, in that aspect this box set is even more amazing and the best one to be released to date. That doesnt mean however that these films shouldnt be upgraded. Do it right! and charge more. But this may be a quick set just to replace the other universal Box Sets that contain the bonus 'Hitchcock Presents' DVD since they just released the first season set of those. SO, i hope that's what this is and that there are plans in the near future for upgraded versions of these films.",1128556800,5,1027,4.37696335078534
2349954,4,B000A1INJE,"Firstly, re: ""Why did they use the wrong picture for the cover?"" - actually, if you look closely, the famous Hitchcock profile is used on a neon sign visible from the apartment set in Rope.

Also, don't expect to see North By Northwest or Hitch's early British works in this set, those are with other studios - this is exclusively Universal productions.

I have been collecting the Hitchcock Universal films for a while now, but certainly have not collected all of them.  14 films for this price, remastered or not is an excellent value.  I did some comparison of Rope as well as Vertigo and the picture quality is greatly improved.  I cannot speak to sound apart from saying that as with the previous printings, Vertigo is in 5.1 and the rest are in 2.0 Stereo.  I will be holding on to my copy of Vertigo for the cover art (it's the older out-of-print swirl poster art version), but the rest will likely be sold to my friendly neighbourhood used CD store.

If you already have the films, you don't have to run out and buy this collection -- the special features, DVD menus and so forth are EXACTLY THE SAME as the previous offerings.  The new item is the Bonus disc including some previously unreleased featurettes as well as Hitchcock's AFI tribute.

Down the road, I could easily see this box set being regarded as well as the collection of Stanley Kubrick's Warner Bros. films.  Recommended, depending on the status of your Hitchcock collection.",1128470400,10,1450,4.650980392156863

2349967,2,B000A1INJE,"I repeat my earlier observation - The profile drawing of Alfred Hitchcock (done by Mr. Hitchcock himself) was ALWAYS associated with the TELEVISION SERIES, NOT ANY OF HIS MOVIES!!!  So WHY such an ILLOGICAL choice to put that picture on a MOVIE collection and NOT on the television collection?",1128297600,12,293,4.979591836734694
2349968,5,B000A1INJE,"I remember when the first Hitchcock DVDs came out from Universal. It was $35 per title. I bought a couple, but at that price, there was no way I was going to buy Topaz or Torn Curtain. The films were OK, but not worth the cash to put them in the collection. Thankfully someone at Universal got wise - hopefully the same person who came up with the Classic Monster collections at a lower price.

You can argue all day about the greatness of Hitchcock, but these films do the one thing debating film historians rarely do: entertain.  Rope, Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho...even The Birds are so much better than 99 percent of the stuff at your local cineplex.  There's a reason why so many directors rip off moments from these films - cause they're great.

Also you get to enjoy some of the best movie trailers ever devised - especially Hitch's tour of the Bates Motel to promote Psycho.",1128124800,6,883,4.5
2349969,1,B000A1INJE,"I was looking forward to this set with great anticipation. I had the old releases, but thought Universal would step up to the plate and give us great new transfers of all their hefty Hitchcock library. Although Warner Bros. has a great boxed set of some terrific and some just ""good"" title, Universal surely has the advantage when it comes to Hitch, even though his best film (IMHO-it's NORTH BY NORTHWEST) is elsewhere.

So I sold off my old copies, bought this set, and with the exception of a vastly improved, at last anamorphic VERTIGO (and we will even forgive those late '90s foley effects mixed with the 1958 soundtrack), it is shocking that what is my other ""favorite"" Hitchcock film, PSYCHO, is finally anamorphic, but obviously OUT OF SYNCH. Not a frame, but several. It's so obvious. How could they miss this.

Equally disappointing is that THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, a masterpiece that should glisten by virtue of its VistaVision photography, is muddy and sounds awful, just like it did before.

The packaging is marginal, the extras are mostly recycled, those formulaic pieces we've grown tired of from the man that does them, and the unkindest cut of all, I thought this set would have the wonderful AFI tribute to Hitch, but instead it only has a fragment.

Universal has a very impressive library, not nearly as impressive as some of its competitors, but there are hundreds of great films unreleased, but theit theme seems to be re-releases

(the 3rd or 4th edition of THE BREAKFAST CLUB?). For Hitch, I'd figure they'd do him proud.

Instead it's a partial injustice. No doubt some films look better this time around, but clearly this is a studio asleep at the wheel.

What a shame. I wish I had kept my old discs and waited for the HD-DVD editions, which will HAVE to be improved.",1128124800,122,1798,4.688888888888889
2349970,4,B000A1INJE,"What a pleasure it was to unwrap this nice looking box! And what a joy it was to examine the new transfers for most of these masterpieces! Let me say some positive things first: Twelve of these titles have indeed been spruced up nicely! Gone are the speckles and dirt visible on the earlier DVD releases. And what a joy to finally get ""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho"" in anamorphic transfers. The black and white films now look visibly more sharp and crisp, with fine contrast and superior sound. Also, the color on the Technicolor movies has been improved quite a lot. ""The Trouble with Harry"", ""Torn Curtain"" and ""The Birds"" now look especially lush! But it is undoubtedly ""Vertigo"" that has gained most from these new transfers. It's sharper, brighter, cleaner, well absolutely stunning compared to Universal's last go at it.

But - and this is sad: ""Rear Window"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" have NOT been improved! ""Rear Window"" was previously restored for DVD by the gentlemen Harris and Katz, but that was the worst thing they ever did (in fact, the ONLY bad thing they did). The colors are dark, drab and murky, the grain is rampant, and there's hardly a frame in decent focus. Universal must have trusted this older ""restoration"" to be the last word on this film, so the only thing they corrected this time around was to remove a stray speckle or two. Everything else is just as ugly as before.

And as for ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", it looks absolutely dreadful! I have just finished comparing it to my old DVD, and apart from the already mentioned clean up job concerning debris and sound, this new try has lost quite a lot of color, sharpness and contrast. Not that the older DVD was anything to shout about loudly, but it certainly was more pleasing to look at than this one.

Apparently, no joy can be complete. Please, Universal, make new efforts go give us Hitchcock fans what we think we deserve in terms of quality images. Why bother to do such a nice job with 12 films, and then include 2 that you allowed to slip through your fingers? I'll be glad to pay once more for ""Rear Window"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" if you decide to finally do them full justice!",1128038400,19,2176,4.50379746835443

However, I've just been to Universal's site and just double-checked the info that Amazon has here ......  Where's the official confirmation?

Before I pony up $85 bucks for this set, I want to know if they've simply repackaged the old titles, or if they've truly redone Vertigo. Seems to me that this information would be a major marketing tool instead of ""digitally remastered"" which is pretty vague.",1125619200,24,509,4.964705882352941
2349974,5,B000A1INJE,"Because some of the extras have changed and moved around to a bonus disc, we can be pretty sure that this isn't just a re-packaging of Universal's previous Hitchcock releases.

With any luck, this means we'll probably FINALLY get anamorphic widescreen releases of Psycho and Vertigo, along with some of the other Hitchcock movies that came to DVD before Universal started catering to widescreen TVs.

I'm surprised that some people are complaining about the absence of Hitchcock films (that Universal doesn't have the rights to!). One reviewer mentioned North By Northwest's absence, also saying that it was ""the one that needed to be restored."" Actually, North by Northwest, currently owned exclusively by WB, is available in a sparkling new transfer both on single disc and as part of WB's well-done Hitchcock ""signature collection.""

The price tag for this release is very reasonable, especially on Amazon, considering the number of films and features on the set.

If you don't own these films on DVD already (a few of them are only so-so, such as Family Plot) you'll definitely want to consider this set, especially to see classics like Psycho, Vertigo, Rope, The Birds, The Trouble With Harry, and Rear Window.",1124668800,12,1215,5.090452261306533
2349975,3,B000A1INJE,"Universal made an unfortunate decision to move documentaries from Psycho and The Birds DVDs to a bonus disk. How this can be justified? If this is a metter of disk space absence, so how higher the new transfer rates are? The Birds already had an anamorphic transfer, Psycho had not, but after all it's a BW movie. And what about Vertigo? I beleive it is the longest film of the three, the original mono sound mix is being added, and it's still can be hold on a single DVD!?

Packaging is another problem. Will every movie be packed in a separate case, or it's going to be a some kind of mega-folding box?

The third issue: there is no indication if the movies will be available any time later as separate DVDs.

So what's the bottom line? If you don't have these movies, yes, this will be a decent buy. But if you already owned ones you need, keep your copy of The Birds and Rear Window (both already anamorphic with original mono sound). Keep even Vertigo and Psycho: though we all were waiting for 16:9 transfers for both and better menu and original sound for Vertigo, I would wait longer untill they are available separately (and docu is put back on Psycho DVD)",1124409600,13,1165,4.434579439252336

However, the title of the set should be ""The Universal Collection,"" as it only includes the films made for (or whose rights are now controled by) Universal Studios, so no ""NxNW"" (Warners), ""To Catch a Thief"" (Paramount), or ""Lifeboat"" (Fox).",1124323200,6,454,4.973684210526316

It is too bad we did not know about this before the time to send it back!  It was not played until now because it was put away as a present for my birthday!  I am so disappointed! I still think I should be able to get an exchange but doubt if I will!  I buy from Amazon all the time!",1525737600,,442,3.610526315789474
