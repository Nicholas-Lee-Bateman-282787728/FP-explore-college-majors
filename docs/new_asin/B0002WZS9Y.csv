2128915,5,B0002WZS9Y,"This is a  TV series that  sadly,  did not last long, it started in  1981 and ended in  1983 and during this time, the series produced a total of 35 episodes.

This  DVD set brings together the complete first  season  of 21 episodes and,  the picture quality  is outstanding!

I always loved watching this series  and I fell in love with  the  girl  named  Lizette Winkler,she's just  so beautiful!

As each episode unfolded, there would be some fun times and  bad times.  As you watch  these episodes you do care  about  what  happens.

One of the neat  things about  this series is that  some of the guest  stars were at  the time, not known  and today, they  are well known. One little girl  in one of the episodes titled  ""A Horse From Heaven""  is none other then 10 year  old Christina Applegate!

This  DVD  set  consists of 6 DVDs and, this series  is a  series that  really  touches your heart  and, its really sentimental.

if you remember this series fondly,  then  you will love owning this series on  DVD!

As a sidenote, season  2 ,which  comes  to DVD on January  25th, 2005, will consist  of  13 episodes.",1102377600,33,1120,4.401015228426396
2128916,5,B0002WZS9Y,"I remember so well back in  1981  always looking forward to this series and, its sad that  only  a total of 35 episodes were made total.

I am so thankful  that  this has been put to DVD and, what  else is so nice is that  the picture quality  is outstanding!  it looks as if these episodes were made TODAY!!

This series will always bring happiness to me and will do the same for you as well!

I am so anxious for season 2!!!!!",1100995200,18,428,4.0120481927710845
2128917,5,B0002WZS9Y,"What a great show this was!  Glad they're bringing out all those TV Shows on DVD.  I'm such a fan of 80s type shows and if you enjoy the Waltons, Little House on the Prairie, all have themes about friendship, family, etc. then you will really enjoy this show.  I'm lovin' it.

2128944,5,B0002WZS9Y,"These are great stories with good values.  There's quite a bit of action involved with so many orphans, and one can watch them over and over.  I would recommend this to anyone, and have.",1390348800,,186,4.4411764705882355
2128945,5,B0002WZS9Y,"It is good, clean, family entertainment. It represents the old fashioned values that are missing in society today. Even one of the teenagers who swore that he hated movies set in this time period, throughly enjoyed this series.",1389052800,,227,5.0
2128946,5,B0002WZS9Y,i have already watched it 3 or 4 times. I will probably look for more like this one in the future.,1375228800,,98,3.7142857142857144
2128947,5,B0002WZS9Y,Father Murphy is an excellent family drama. I look forward to the second season being available on DVD in the near future.,1368489600,,122,4.590909090909091

2128977,5,B0002WZS9Y,"This show makes you feel good when you watch it. If you like the plot of doing the right things,living with faith,and honor you will enjoy this. Michael Landon had a hand in it and that made it of interest to me. Highhly reccommended. The children are cute and play their parts well. Merlin Olsen is fine as Father Murphy.",1361404800,,322,4.383333333333334
2128978,3,B0002WZS9Y,"Fun characters, family friendly with solid moral values and interesting plots. ""Fr. Murphy"" isn't really a priest, but he respects the position when he is acting in it, but only to fool officials.  All the orphans know he isn't a real priest and indeed, a priest does arrive and they end up getting along just fine.  Fun twists.",1361404800,,328,4.637931034482759
2128979,5,B0002WZS9Y,"This is a good heart warming series for the whole family. My family watched the whole thing and then started over and watched it again. Good, Clean viewing and a lot of morales . I would reccomend to anyone who is tired of what is available on tv today",1356393600,,252,4.163265306122449
2128980,5,B0002WZS9Y,Great series beautifully and tastefully done. Unfortunately the series didn't run very long as often is the case with clean wholesome shows.,1355356800,,140,5.409090909090909
2128981,5,B0002WZS9Y,"I enjoyed every one of the episodes.  Merlin passed away last year.  It was hard to see him go at such a young age, 69.  Watching him in this unique role was very enjoyable.  His personality shows through so clearly - gentleness, compassion, hard work, love, conviction, focus - and when needed some real intensity.  We miss him, but the Father Murphy episodes can help rekindle the memories.",1353715200,,392,4.705882352941177
2128982,5,B0002WZS9Y,"I love this box set!  I can't believe it's been around 30 years since Father Murphy was on TV.  I loved watching it then, and this has renewed my love for the show.  The quality is excellent. I wish the 2nd season wasn't so expensive-I would definitely purchase it and season 3 as well.",1348876800,,286,4.2592592592592595
2128983,4,B0002WZS9Y,The series is great but the lack of close caption is a problem.  The dialog is hard to understand at times.  My copy was missing disc 5 so it had to be returned and re-ordered.,1338768000,,176,4.0
2128984,5,B0002WZS9Y,This is one of the best. It's as good as the Little House on the Prairie series. The late great Merlin Olson is perfect in his role. I only wish there were 6 more seasons to watch. Each episode has something educational in regards to the hard knocks of life and human nature.,1335398400,,275,4.2075471698113205
2128985,5,B0002WZS9Y,"We watched the first few episodes of his series on a dvd from Netflix.  I decided to look it up on Amazon and couldn't believe the price was so low.  I ordered immediately.  Everyone from my 11 year old to my husband loved this show.  The plots are interesting and teach good morals.  The characters pray and have church.  Things seldom, if ever seen on todays tv series.  I wish I could give it more stars.",1327449600,,407,4.276315789473684
2129006,5,B0002WZS9Y,"Five minutes in and I knew this was going to be amazing. I am a huge fan of Little House on the Prairie and the style of filming is exactly the same. Jon Garvey and Joe Kagan are back, same personality, different characters! Highly Recommended!",1319155200,,244,4.444444444444445
2129007,5,B0002WZS9Y,Thoroughly enjoyable wholesome entertainment. I always feel good after watching. I love every episode on DVD and watch them over and over.  You just can't get GOOD entertainment on TV or DVD like this anymore.  :-),1315008000,,214,4.916666666666667
2129008,5,B0002WZS9Y,"To whom it may concern
When you say you have the complete series why don't you show it. I was interested in buying the complete series but couldn't find it. I think Father Murphy is a great show.",1312329600,,195,4.157894736842105
2129009,4,B0002WZS9Y,Father Murphy season one. a good clean show and a good price for this dvd . i like the show back in the 80`s and i love it now don`t see show like this no more. IT`S a feel good show to see. IF YOU LIKE A GOOD SHOW YOU NEED THIS ONE. thank you.,1307836800,2,244,3.4545454545454546
2129010,4,B0002WZS9Y,"Father Murphy is a great show for the whole family!  I will say that it is easy to see that Michael Landon directed this, because the same type of humor and story plots are seen throughout the series.  A few of the episodes have rather pathetic video and sound quality probably because some of the archives are now hard to find.  It is really great to see Moses Gunn (who uses his real name Moses) in this series!  I always wished he was in Little House more...he is a tremendous actor and completes the series.  It is a shame that it only went for a season and a half.

It does seem that the episodes have the same plot all the way through.  The group is constantly trying to keep the orphanage/school open while the villians are trying to close it down and bring the children to a workhouse.  So, in a way, that plot gets a little old after seeing it over and over.  There are some funny and strange episodes that are not quite predicatable as well.

Overall, this package is worth the investment and it looks that it may be hard to get one day!  Purchase now and you may have a rare find on your hands!  If you are a fan of Little House, then you will love Father Murphy!",1306195200,3,1174,4.191964285714286
2129011,5,B0002WZS9Y,"WOW!  What can I say, that has not already been said about this series. Great wholesome lessons for everyone.
This is truly a work of art.  If I could I would give it 10 stars!",1301961600,,176,4.0
2129012,5,B0002WZS9Y,Very quick delivery. Bought it as a christmas present for a 12 year old girl who loves Little House on the Praire.. She loved it!!! Thanks,1296259200,,138,4.346153846153846
2129013,5,B0002WZS9Y,This is a great series that I enjoyed when it was aired several years ago. It has been long enough that watching the series now is like seeing it for the first time. The DVD's are clear and a pleasure to watch. Great product.,1284854400,,225,4.136363636363637
2129014,5,B0002WZS9Y,I loved this show during it's initial run; it was just great TV simple and pure.  It's good to see something relevant instead of all the reality TV shows.,1271980800,,154,4.310344827586207
2129015,5,B0002WZS9Y,The first of a short but terrific series.  [Cut short by the production of highway to heaven.] We have enjoyed and given LANDEN films to family members. Wonderful for the whole family to view.,1227484800,,192,4.647058823529412
2129035,5,B0002WZS9Y,"One of my favorite series of all time, even though i am not much of a Merlin Olsen fan.
LOL, they must have found every blue and green eyed cute kid in Hollywood to be on the show, not an ugly kid around.",1223683200,,204,3.7674418604651163

2129037,5,B0002WZS9Y,"great series, showing these important values.
I find it encouraging and beautiful and touching to see how one can stand against adversity with faith, friends, tolerance and integrity no matter what.
inspiring!
and like the space given to the catholic church for a change :-",1190246400,,273,5.088888888888889

2129039,4,B0002WZS9Y,"Merlin Olsen disguises himself as a priest so territory officials believe the church is supporting his friend Mae's orphanage and school, and do not send the children to the hated work-house.

This series often has a new child guest star in an episode. Has a villain who shows up regularly trying different ways to close the orphanage and send the children to the hated work-house.

In real life, Merlin Olsen was a star NFL football player for the LA Rams.

""Father Murphy"" is closest to being ""Bonanza"" with kids. ""Little House on the Prairie"" and ""Road to Avonlea"" are a league above ""Father Murphy"". They have more of everything, bigger budgets, better writers, more charm (depth), more character-acting (Mrs. Olsen), and more character development (opportunity for personality). Several episodes of ""Father Murphy"" do reach the level of ""Little House"". The episode, ""The Horse from Heaven"", is good; the new priest is swindled into using the orphanage's last money to buy a race horse, to win money for food for the orphanage, but later finds that no one has ever been able to break and ride the horse. The tale of Amanda about the bank embezzler doing good deeds is good. Three of the 21 episodes did not interest me. In the league of the ""Christy"" series. The characters are likeable, but not the exceptional star charm of Michael Landon and Melissa Gilbert. ""Little House"" and ""Avonlea"" had the advantage of being based on great books. There are so few good shows on TV, that I was willing to work with ""Father Murphy"", and enjoyed both seasons.",1172966400,5,1553,4.830827067669173
2129040,5,B0002WZS9Y,"A wonderful family program, right up there with Little House On The Prairie.",1140825600,,76,4.923076923076923
2129041,5,B0002WZS9Y,"I thought this was a very enjoyable family show.  Both seasons were great, but what I think really ""killed"" this show was:  (1)Season Two got away from the main theme of Murphy imitating a Franciscan Priest in order to save the orphanage; (2)It followed too closely after the great ""Little House"" series in which Merlin Olsen had a continuing role after Victor French left the show - It was almost like a continuation of the Merlin Olsen Little House character on Father Murphy; and finally, (3) the executive producer of Father Murphy,Michael Landon, began work on his ""Highway to Heaven"" series leading a fan to believe he really wanted to end his ""stint"" with ""period pieces.""",1138579200,3,679,4.844827586206897
2129042,5,B0002WZS9Y,"Father Murphy is an excellent show for the whole family to watch.  I truly wish we had more shows like this on tv now adays.  It is a classic show set in the western days.
If you like Little House on the Prairie or Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, you will love this series too.",1122422400,4,271,4.0
2129043,5,B0002WZS9Y,"I have now watched all of the first and second seasons of Father Murphy, a short-lived program created by Michael Landon.  Merlin Olson and Moses Gunn which were brought over from Little House on the Prairie are 2 of the main stars along with Katherine Cannon and Timothy Gibbs. This is an excellent series and the episodes are UN-CUT and the DVD quality is OUTSTANDING!!  Image Entertainment did a fantastic job with these transfers, unlike the very poor job the edited versions of the LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE 7 seasons they so far have released.  I was rather reluctant to purchase another Image product but this series they did a fantastic job with.  If you like Little House on the Prairie you are certain to enjoy this series about an orphanage run by Father Murphy who really isn't a priest but had to pretend to be in order to keep the orphan children from going to a workhouse.  I highly recommend this series!!",1109894400,23,923,4.603658536585366
2129044,5,B0002WZS9Y,"I have never watched Father Murphy until now,I grew up watching little house in the prairie and higway to heaven(I'm half French,I grew up in France and little house on the prairie was and still is very big over there) so you can call me a Michael Landon fan but I've never seen that gem of a show that is Father Murphy before..until now.

What can I say it's a required taste but if you like other Michael Landon show I am absolutely sure you will love this.

So much things are charming about this show,I love the touching relationship Murphy,Will and Murphy,Mae allso the bad guy is just hilarious,he remind me a bit of Ms Oleson but much more Evil.

it's  such a shame the show didn't last longer,I wonder were it would have gone if it would have lasted as long as little house,it would have been great to see the kids grow up and all.

Anyway I highly recomend this show to fans of Michael Landon,how I miss him,watching Father Murphy will make you realise that they just don't do shows like this anymore.",1106956800,5,1010,4.379679144385027

8033825,5,B0002WZS9Y,"As of this writing, the DVD's have been out for over 10 years and there are ZERO 1 or 2 star ratings here on Amazon.  That tells you something right there about both this show and the DVD set.  It may be a lesser known show, but it's a quality production.

I just recently bought this series as a blind-buy because I also enjoyed Little House on the Prairie.  I don't think I had ever seen the show before.  I'm not going to say it's quite up to Little House standards (it's not), but it is a perfectly enjoyable family show that is lightyears better than much of what passes for entertainment today.  If you like Little House and like slower-paced shows, you're pretty much guaranteed to like this too.  I was worried about whether I could separate Merlin Olsen's character in Little House (Jonathan Garvey) from his character in this, but I found it to not be a problem at all.  I also honestly wasn't sure of the plotline of the series because on the surface it sounded like there's a lot of deception and lying going on that made me wonder what kind of values this series portrayed.  The good news is I found this concern to be mostly unfounded.

It's a shame this show got cancelled midway through Season 2.  For those upset about season 2 not currently being available, just an FYI that season 2 only contained 13 episodes and of those, honestly only a couple were anything to get excited about - the quality of the writing dropped a fair bit in season 2.  What's a shame is that with only 1.5 seasons, the distributor just didn't release them all as a ""complete collection"".  I don't know why they even bothered doing ""season sets"" for a 1.5 season show.  Still, season 1 ends on a perfect high-note that provides a good cap to the series as a whole.  So if you never see Season 2, don't fret about it much.  Rather than thinking of this show as short-lived, the best way to think of this show is as a long multi-part mini-series as it's kind of got that feel and the last S1 episode provides a great ""finale"".

For being a more obscure/less-popular show, it is exciting to see that the transfers on the DVD's are generally of good remastered quality obviously taken from the original elements.

They don't make shows like this anymore on TV, and that's a shame.",1469577600,,2269,4.426506024096385
