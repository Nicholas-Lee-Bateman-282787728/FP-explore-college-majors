8393000,2,B003AILXAA,"While this crime series has a different format then other shows I've viewed, It lacks the type of investigation I usually watch and find in other crime investigation series.",1373500800,,173,5.0
8393001,2,B003AILXAA,"The music in total is very poor, I consider it to be more the work of an amateur composer. All the tunes are really very very simple...",1359504000,,135,4.037037037037037
8393002,5,B003AILXAA,"Very good interview with Jeffrey Dahmer. I used to study him last year for a forensics class and this interview was probably one of the most thorough ones. It's weird because during the interview Dahmer is talking about a box he kept in his closet in which he enclosed a man's head and penis. Then towards the end of the interview he points at a black box in the room and says, ""The box was about that size."" That comment tripped me out for some reason.",1352937600,,453,4.27906976744186
