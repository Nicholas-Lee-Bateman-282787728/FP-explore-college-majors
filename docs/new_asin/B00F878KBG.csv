Nevertheless, I wasn't disappointed by anything in this film. It's a good story and doesn't get stupid trying to pander to any particular interest groups who want films to be about themselves and their pet peeves (or their kinky desires.) It is very sympathetic with the Tibetans, which is appropriate to anyone who thinks it's wrong to invade a nation and trash its culture, kill a lot of the people and re-make their society according to the demands of the invaders. That is to say, it is ABOUT the wrong done to Tibet; it's not a clever device to sneak the message in via another story. It's pretty honest.",1453852800,,758,4.460431654676259
8612921,5,B00F878KBG,"This is a movie that isn't a typical Hollywood movie. No car chases, no bombs, or shootouts. We have a fairly static country  town in a Tibetian/Nepalise area. A conflict between the older, wiser folks and the younger, more vigorous guys. There is a basic disagreement that splits the town.  A movie that will captivate you if you let it.  Did I mention gorgeous photography of the himalayas that is worth the price of admission?",1412467200,3,429,4.693333333333333
8612922,5,B00F878KBG,"Aside from the movie itself being beautifully remastered in Blu-Ray, I had no problems playing this.

As described.

I wouldn't buy again for me because I already own it, but I may buy it again for a future gift.",1403654400,,212,4.410256410256411
8612923,1,B00F878KBG,Disappointed in that I was / am unable to play the DVD in this region...I should have known better & presumably did not pay attention to your description.,1402617600,,154,4.535714285714286
8612924,5,B00F878KBG,"Not a movie critic by any means.....don't even know the proper lingo.  Won't attempt an ""in depth"" review.

All I can say is, ""I thoroughly enjoy this film"".  It was all great:  the life, the photography, the story and the culture depicted was wonderful!  I didn't have to sit through any contrived attempts at mind control or political correct social biases and subtle messaging with 2/3's sexual content. The story was as simple and rich as life in the Himalaya! Salt of the Earth isn't just NaCl!

Great entertainment, IMO.  I actually feel enriched by watching this film!  Unusual these days!",1398124800,3,596,4.8316831683168315
8612925,5,B00F878KBG,"The film is perfection. A rare gem of a non-western cultural-based story that has univeral appeal. Those of you who've suffered with the horrid DVD version can take comfort with this blu-ray release which has reference-quality picture and sound. The image is utterly film-like... detailed and rich without overzealous processing/DNR and no obvious electronic manipulation (like edge ringing). Just gorgeous. The lossless audio is full bodied with lots of natural ""space"" and acoustic cues. A lovely film for the senses as well as the mind and heart. Enjoy.",1393545600,6,556,5.329545454545454
8612926,5,B00F878KBG,"The picture quality is amazing and when one considers this was all filmed in very cold, windy and snowy conditions at extreme high altitude up on the border between Nepal and Tibet it is even more amazing. The crew did an astonishing job. The natural ability of the local people who had no training at all is also remarkable. This Blu-ray is a huge improvement over the DVD although it must be noted it is A locked so not suitable for Europe or Australia unless one has an Oppo or similar.
My only regret is that the most interesting commentary is a mixture of heavy French accented English and American English set against a quite loud main Tibetan audio in the background and as this commentary is not subtitled it is extremely difficult to hear and follow. This is a shame. It might have been better to have burnt in the Tibetan soundtrack as 99% of viewers will want it anyway, and to then used the optional subtitle track for the commentary. The making-of feature is also most interesting but is just ported over from the DVD and is very poor quality technically and far below the main film and has no subtitles when ""English"" is spoken.",1392768000,2,1142,4.521739130434782
