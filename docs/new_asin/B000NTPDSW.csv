2781000,5,B000NTPDSW,"I caught the HBO HD versions of all three movies.  I'm assuming that the HD versions are the exact same as the upcoming releases (if not better).

The HD versions were very nice.  The first two movies were grainy in some parts, for instance, during Michael's trial before the commission.

I think it is too difficult to perfectly transfer 35mm film to a digital format.  I think they did a tremendous job with the HBO HD versions and I hope the Blu Ray ones will be better visually.  I already know the sound tranfers will be great.

I can hear the opening trumpet now in TrueHD.",1214870400,5,579,4.40566037735849
2781001,5,B000NTPDSW,"I don't really care that much about the new extras, the real need to double-dip for this release is the improvement of the video for the three films. If you own the original release you'll have noticed just how un-watchable the three movies were, specially because of the incredible amount of specs and marks which I've found distracting and downright intolerable; there's not a +/-5 second period in which a spec does not appear on I & II while the video in III is affected by terrible color and brightness.
While watching the new release of the Bond fims a few months ago I concluded I couldn't be long before the GODFATHER series received a similar treatment and sooner rather than later, here we are. I really hope the price for this edition is brought down by Amazon from the 62.99 it currently stands but, even if it doesn't, two of the greatest films of all time are worthy of just swallowing and making such expense. I like III very much too but obviously it isn't in the same league with the first two, just about no other film ever made is.
10/13 UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW: Having finally seen this DVDs: fantastic picture, much improved sound. There are plenty of images and sounds there to find which simply couldn't be appreciated in past editions. But you'd think that for $62.99 they'd get the labels on disc 4 & 5 right ! $62.99 !!!! You can find this collection on e-bay for half the amount. Very sorry to say that for the last several months, Amazon has been pricing themselves out of being considered the best option in DVDs.",1211328000,35,1540,4.523297491039426

2781035,2,B000NTPDSW,"We are pretty much leaving the age of bluray and well into the era of 4K. They just recently restored this film in 4K and had a big gathering and showing at Tribeca and there have been generally positive reviews regarding the quality of the transfer. So why then does the studio not release the 4K version which they have on hand last year 2017, which was the 45th year anniversary of the movie?

Why put out yet another useless boxed bluray edition in the age of 4K? To milk the customers for whatever they can get until they decide to release this set on 4K. I have this set on DVD, absolutely refuse to buy a bluray set (even if they broke code and named it the ""Mafia Edition"" and it comes inside a fake horse's head) and will only get the 4K one when it comes out which I'm sure they'll charge an arm and leg for. This double dipping nonsense gotta stop. The 4K will be my definitive edition no matter how pristine the eventual 8K might or might not be...unless some unlucky accident was to befall me and get struck by a bolt of lightning and somehow survive. Then, I'll begrudgingly get the 8K but I'm gonna blame some of the greedy people in this studio and that I will not forget.",1522281600,,1188,4.256637168141593

2781225,5,B000NTPDSW,"I am not going to get into extensive detail on how great this film is, hundreds if not thousands before me have already done so and to good credit. As a Hollywood director has once previously stated on another non-Godfather film commentary track, watching the film is a cinema class in of its self... if you are going to watch only one film in your life, it is this one. I must agree, I watch this film repeatedly, not only to be entertained but also to study as a filmmaker myself.
Obviously the many directors who turned down the assignment to direct this adapted script had a strong moral objection to glorify the mafia, and I agree, there is absolutely nothing glamorous about real life gangsters in organized crime. But this is a fictional tale and Coppola used his own strong Italian American heritage to infuse the film with far greater themes and family bonding than any of the other directors originally approached would have done. He raised this film from the exploitative gangster flick that it was slotted to be by the studio (even wanting to change the novels 1940s setting to modern day to save money on the budget) to that of Shakespearian levels and the best example of film art in Hollywood films. Coppola well deserved the Oscar, fame and the money that followed the films release, in my opinion anyway.
Perhaps it is because I saw this film as a youngster and accepted the film as is(as many others I watched, good and cheesy), but watching it even now there doesnt seem to be a single bad shot or angle in the entire film, except one.... Diane Keatons false double-take reaction to the exploded vehicle in the back ground when she is confronted by Tom as  she returns to the Mall to see Michael. It always takes me out of the film.
The Godfather 2 is an equally great film even though at the time critics were divided to its back-and-forth flashback structure.
Like many people/fans I anticipated the arrival of Godfather 3 but was left cold by it. At the time I zeroed my dislike to the universally accepted scapegoat, Sofia Coppolas stale performance, after the talented Winona Ryder bailed on the project. After multiple viewings I suddenly realized that, for me anyway, Al Pacinos performance is what turned me off. He was not the younger, subtle and starving artist Pacino of the early 1970s as in the first two films, but the older super-star whose strong acting style had already by 1990, become a parody of itself.
The only thing I can fault this blu ray collection is the absent audio commentary from a film historian. Coppola gives his memories of making the film and they are interesting but he is also very humble in his approach;  perhaps, as he stated in behind the scenes interviews while filming Apocalypse Now, the last thing he would want is to be labelled as a pretentious a-----e college professor. This film DESERVES  to have a film historian pointing out what a watershed film this is. The director of any film should not be the one doing this and Coppola, being an intelligent man, knows this as a result to his humbling disaster of ONE FROM THE HEART which sabotaged his career at the beginning of the 80s.
A lot of the supplement material has been re-hashed from previous video collections and there are some new ones added.",1511395200,,3269,4.632758620689655

2781275,5,B000NTPDSW,"THE GODFATHER

RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.

MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, whos basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michaels American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the hysterical sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.

Im not big on gangster flicks because its hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually cant wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Baba). But, if you can handle this element, The Godfather is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.

Highlights abound, starting with Brandos great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michaels rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968s Bullitt); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent love at first sight moment in Sicily; Sonnys beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michaels men carrying out their wicked deeds.

Whats the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo from Puzos book.

THE GODFATHER: PART II

RELEASED IN 1974 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather: Part II"" is part sequel and part flashback to the first film with the main story focusing on Michael (Al Pacino) in the late 50s as the stalwart Corleone son who has taken over as Godfather with events taking place at Lake Tahoe, Miami, New York City, Havana (during the Cuban Revolution), and a congressional committee in Washington DC. The flashbacks concern Vito Corleone as a kid in Sicily and his arrival to Ellis Island with the story focusing on Vitos life in New York City when he was in his mid-to-late 20s (Robert De Niro) where he cleverly and boldly establishes himself as the formidable new Don.

MAIN CAST: Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom, while John Cazale appears as the weakest Corleone son, Fredo. Diane Keaton returns as Michaels wife, who tries to put out of her mind her husbands shady business with Talia Shire reprising the role of Corleone sister, Connie.

The good news is that the flashbacks pertaining to Vito (De Niro) are good, starting with the shocking opening scenes. The saga of Michael (Pacino), by contrast, is relatively dull, particularly the first half, which mostly involves overlong scenes of talky drama. Michaels story simply lacks the energy and highlight-every-15-minutes of the prior film. Moreover, Pacino is thoroughly one-note solemn as Michael, lacking the characters interesting story arc in the first installment and the dimension of the third. Im not blaming Pacino, as he simply played the role as written and does it well. Im just saying that hes not a very captivating character, particularly compared to Brando or De Niro as Vito. Hes just too one-dimensional and therefore uninteresting. Thankfully, things perk up in the second half culminating with an explosive showdown between Michael and Kay, which had to happen in light of the climatic scene of the previous movie.

The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Lifes hard enough without taking that shady route.

Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with some highlights, but IMHO its not in the same league as the first movie in overall entertainment. Its good for what it is, but its overrated by people who cant see beyond nostalgia-tinged glasses. If you're a fan of the first film its almost mandatory that you watch this one; just don't expect the same dynamic greatness. I know its sacrilege to say this, but Part II is on par with Part III in tone and quality, although I personally give Part III the edge in all-around entertainment value.

THE FILM RUNS 3 hours & 22 minutes (overlong) and was shot in Sicily & Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy; the New York City area; Lake Tahoe, California; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; Acireale, Catania; Las Vegas; and Washington DC. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo.

THE GODFATHER: PART III

RELEASED IN 1990 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather: Part III"" stars Al Pacino as aging Mafia don Michael Corleone in 1979, who seeks to legitimize his work in New York and Italy and avow for his sins. He mentors his bastard nephew, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), while trying to steer his teenage daughter, Mary, away from him (Sofia Coppola).

MAIN CAST: Diane Keaton returns as Michaels ex-wife, Kay, while Talia Shire reprises the role of sister, Connie. Franc D'Ambrosio is on hand as Michaels son, Antonio, who wants to leave law school and become an opera singer. George Hamilton co-stars as B.J. Harrison, essentially taking the place of Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) as Michael's chief financial advisor and attorney. Eli Wallach plays an aged don and Joe Mantegna the gangster Michael put in charge of Little Italy after semi-retiring. Raf Vallone plays a dubious Cardinal and Bridget Fonda a fornicating reporter in a small role.

Part III is on par with Part II in tone and quality, but I give this one the edge in overall entertainment value. Michael (Pacino) has much more human dimension here as opposed to his one-note grim depiction in Part II. His scenes confessing his sins to a priest in a Vatican City garden and, later, with Kay in Sicily are good examples.  There are several other highlights amidst the drama, like the break-in scene at Vincents abode, the Atlantic City massacre, the street festival hit, the entire closing opera sequence that juxtaposes the performances of the play with various violent attacks and the aftermath.

Andy Garcia brings fresh blood and vitality to the trilogy in a pretty significant role, as does Sofia in a relatively small part. Winona Ryder was originally cast for the part, but she was too sick to perform and so Francis chose his daughter at the last minute and shes fine in the role. Does anyone seriously think Winona Ryder would have taken this peripheral part and done it any better? I heard all the ridiculous criticism over Sofias performance before viewing the film and therefore kept waiting for a serious train wreck, but it never happened. She did a fine job for a side character who's an unseasoned, slightly self-conscious (i.e. wooden), flirty teen. To those sheeple who have joined the idiotic critical feeding frenzy: Shut the fudge up and get a life!

The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Needless to say, Lifes hard enough without taking that foolish route.

Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with several highlights, but it doesnt rank up there with the first movie, which stands alone. If you're a fan of the first two films its almost mandatory that you watch this one. It lacks the thrilling greatness of the first film, but its about equal to the second, although I favor this one a little.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 42 minutes (or 2 hours 50 minutes, the longer version) and was shot in Sicily and numerous places on mainland Italy, including Vatican City; the New York City area; Atlantic City, NJ; and Lake Tahoe, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo.

Oh boy. We are coming up on the 45th anniversary of Coppola's undisputed masterpiece and you can just imagine the conversation that took place over at Paramount. ""It's the 45th anniversary. We have to release SOMEthing."" And... the jokes pretty much write themselves. ""It's an offer I CAN refuse."" Or ""Take the cannoli, leave this box set.""

Let me just state right up front... The Godfather and Part II are my favorite films. I watch them once a year. I always will. To me, they are perfect films. I know there are many that disagree with that assertion and many others that agree wholeheartedly. Therein lies the rub. With a film that has this much acclaim and this much nostalgia for so many, any new releases will be scrutinized heavily and judged harshly. There have been many previous releases of the trilogy over the DVD and Blu-ray era, including a 40th-anniversary edition and the more recent ""Coppola Restoration"" edition. This ""Omerta Edition"" does not contain any new content pertaining to the films, such as commentaries, special features or documentaries. What it DOES have, are new collectible Trivia Cards, Magnetic Poetry, an Anatomy of a Scene fold out and Quote Cards. It is also limited to a run of 45,000 copies. That's nice and all, but the fans of this film already probably have the Coppola Restoration on their shelves and might even have a VHS copy of The Complete Epic displayed prominently, which they rub in the faces of their friends who don't own it. *cough* I digress.

The point here is that this is pretty much a needless dip by Paramount that will be mostly appreciated by newer fans who have yet to own these films. I will readily admit that it is a gorgeous set and part of me covets this just to be a completist, but unless it goes on a deep sale around Black Friday, I'm going to pass on this release. Now that we are in the 4K era, fans of these films are waiting patiently for that upgrade/release. The fans would also be heartened to see the always divisive but absolutely fascinating Complete Epic version released on Blu or 4K. Why haven't Paramount released these other versions? Maybe that's why this is the ""Omerta"" Edition... because there is a code of silence about this at the studio. Just don't tell me that you can't release a 4K version. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. Five stars for Part I and II. Half a star deduction for Part III. Half a star deduction for the quintuple dip.

I'm just going to pretend that this edition doesn't exist, the same way I pretend that Part III doesn't exist. Problem solved.",1504396800,22,2722,4.641078838174274

It does have the deleted scenes that are included in the ""Epic Edition"" however they are ""Extras"" and not re-edited back into the films.  I can watch this movies almost every week and never get tired of them.  The word classic is not a good enough word for these films.  In a nutshell this is the story of a crime family.  The father who almost had no choice about the events in his life.  And then there is the story of Michael who slowly becomes the devil on earth.",1503014400,,589,4.261261261261262

2781440,5,B000NTPDSW,"The Godfather 3 movie collection was truly amazing to watch all 3 movies in a row over course of a weekend.  Never watched the movies until now when I ask my mom to buy it with her Amazon Prime account for 7.90 for all 3 movies roughly comes to 2.63 for each movie well worth the price for a trilogy.  I personally enjoyed all 3 movies even though with the first movie had a few slow moments here and there, but with part 2 loved how they keep flashing back and forth from the 1950's to 1917.  Then with part 3 having some great actors in that also made it very fun to watch, if your a true fan of The Godfather movies you must buy this set for your collection and be prepared to have jaw on the floor from the beautiful camera work to the amazing shots of the areas were it was filmed.  In closing a DVD set well worth the price of roughly 8 dollars and an great add on to anyone's film collection and like a said for any movie fan or buff a must have for their collections.",1500249600,,975,4.010309278350515

2781442,4,B000NTPDSW,This is a very good collection. The quality is quite good; picture and sound and availability of subtitles.  I did notice that a couple of minor scenes were missing though. If you're really into having the best versions of the Godfather movies you should pass on this set.  But for me it's satisfactory.  At about 9 bucks for all three movies you definitely get value for money spent.  And it's cheaper than renting the movies individually.,1500076800,2,440,4.75

The third movie is a stinker. Diane Keaton in all the movies  was always hard to watch, they should have chosen a woman with acting abilities. Sofia Coppola in part three was a trainwreck. The only reason she got the part was nepotism. The cost was excellent for even one movie so it's still worth it.",1498348800,5,475,4.21978021978022

2781578,5,B000NTPDSW,A great trilogy!!  Don't miss it if you haven't seen it before or if you have seen it see it again.  A classic!!!,1490140800,,113,3.869565217391304
2781579,5,B000NTPDSW,"If you're like me, and the vast majority of other reviewers of this set, you consider the three-part Godfather series, particularly part Nos. 1 & 2, to arguably be the greatest movie production ever and without question among the greatest.

I cherish my film library, in large part, because I have a propensity to buy the ""better"" versions of movies and other collectibles. There's another three disc Blu-Ray offering of the three part Godfather film and it currently sells for about $10 less than this one. The exceptional digital transfer quality is identical for both sets but if you are a collector of films, books, coins, etc. you know that saving $10 for a set that offers more, including better packaging, is analogous to those leather bound Easton Press books or your complete Glenn Gould or Arthur Rubenstien CD sets if for no other reason that you've got something on your shelves that represents quality, and if you're a parent, a quality library that your heirs will inherit and add to  their heirs and so forth.

I bought this set in 2011 and have decided to write my review now, six years after purchase. I have watched the entire set at least once every year and two or three times in at least one of the past six years. I am not one to judge solely on cost. But even if I were, I'd still recognize that THIS IS THE SET TO BUY. Amortize $10 over God knows how many viewings and you'll find the true cost amounts at most, to pennies more and, eventually, even less that a penny more.

Even if the reasons stated in my first couple of paragraphs means nothing to a person, the buyer is, I grant you, paying more, but is also getting more which is the fourth disc of special featurettes ( The Masterpiece That Almost Wasnt, Godfather World, Emulsional Rescue: Revealing The Godfather, .And When the Shooting Stopped, ""The Family Tree/The Crime Organization"", Montage: The Godfather on the Red Carpet, Four Short Films on The Godfather, Audio Commentaries, Documentary: The Godfather Family, Behind the Scenes, Storyboards, Additional Scenes/Historical Timeline) so it's simply not an apples to apples comparison. And if you're that true film fanatic , as I am, buying this set over it's less expensive scaled down three disc version; well the decision to buy is really no decision at all. It's a no brainer that you'll buy and cherish this set.

I also enjoy it when guests are over and compliment me on my film, music, and book libraries. It's far more impressive and enjoyable to me to look at them as opposed to my Roku or AppleTV film library, iPod, iPhone, or some other MP3 player, and my bookshelves versus my Kindle. When I drafted my will, I felt better about leaving these tangible items to my children as opposed ""child # 1 gets my Roku"", ""#2 gets my MP3 player, etc as opposed to getting my tangible music, book, and video libraries. I think they'll appreciate what's becoming a lost art form far more too.

In economic terms this concept is known as the ""demand curve"" and/or ""marginal utility"". Which all boils down to, what's one's personal preferences and how does one calculate cost.

Anyway, These are fantastic films of which I never tire and in that regard, I think like just about everyone else on this review board as well as the review board for the less expensive set; except on that board you hear a lot of people talking about how smart they were to have chosen that less expensive one. I'm in the right place for me. Where do you belong?",1490140800,2,3476,4.633116883116883

Some scenes look amazing and look like they were shot within the last decade, however other scenes definitely suffer with excessive grain and uneven color. It feels like the team who restored these films ran out of money or ran up on a deadline quicker than expected and were unable to fully restore some scenes. Nevertheless, it looks better than its DVD counterpart. The great looking shots and scenes are quite plentiful, and outnumber the iffy ones.

My son turned him onto Blu-Rays a couple years ago.  At first my husband was skeptical regarding any noticeable difference, however after getting a new TV he has since noticed the difference.

2781808,2,B000NTPDSW,"I purchased this 3-movie collection of THE GODFATHER saga because I wanted to replace my older videos with DVD's.  Unfortunately, I did not bother to watch these movies when I first purchased the set months ago, therefore I cannot return. The problem is the DVD set I received was defective.  I tested each disk on my two DVD/VCR players, and also on my newer DVD [up-scaling] player.  In each instance the picture quality was very dark; too dark for viewing.  Also there was 'skipping'.

I called the manufacturer [Samsung] technical support of my flat-screens for assistance.  However, after many trouble-shooting attempts with the settings, etc., it was determined that the problem was the defective DVDs.

I love the Godfather trilogy, but will not purchase another 3-movie collection for fear of an inferior picture [quality].

The lesson here is to 'test drive' all purchases prior the return deadline.  Therefore, I conclude: BUYER BEWARE when purchasing lower-cost DVD movie collection sets!

I have to say I was somewhat disappointed in the quality of the high definition transfer. Sometimes it looks fine sometimes it looks great but way too often it looks like crap. In quite a few low-contrast low-light scenes the images pixelate and break up like some kind of bargain bin VHS tape.

And I have to say I really don't get it. Landmark films high definition Blu-ray and still there are scenes that just look like crap. Are we going to have to wait for a specialty company to license these movies to get a decent transfer?",1460073600,,706,4.693548387096774

2781983,5,B000NTPDSW,"The Godfather saga is one of the most popular movies about a crime family that have ever been created. Indeed, it is truly an epic masterpiece of film making by Francis Ford Coppola.  This trilogy tells the story (The Godfather 3 movie collection) of a crime family, headed by Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando.

The first movie in this trilogy begins with the wedding of  Vito Corleones daughter, (Connie).  While the large outdoor celebration party is going on, Vito Corleone is meeting with various people. This is our first introduction into the Sicilian tradition of granting requests of anyone asking a favor on the day of a daughters wedding.  This incredible movie stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duval.  There is plenty of intrigue, suspense, vicious revenge scenes in this movie.  This short review cannot due this justice to this amazing movie.

The second movie is in my opinion is even better than the first one. In this fantastic film we are exposed to the early years of Vito Corleone when back in Sicily his father, brother and mother are killed by the local crime boss.  It shows the young 9 year old first coming to America with the statue of liberty in the background. It truly had to be a heartfelt moment for immigrants coming to America.  It also follows his development as a young man and how he becomes the respected head of a crime group beginning with the opening of an olive oil business to cover other criminal activities. This excellent movie stars Al Pacino, as Michael who now heads the Corleone family, Robert DeNiro playing the young Corleone, with Robert Duval and Diane Keaton.

The third movie does not come up to the same level as the Godfather 1 and 2; nevertheless, I personally also love this movie.  In this final saga Al Pacino plays the aging Michael Corleone, as he is still attempting to make the Corleone family business completely legitimate.  The crime bosses of the other families want to pull the Corleone back into the seedy criminal business. They are not happy and in an attempt to clear things up with everyone sets up a meeting to set things right. He gave each of the other crime family heads a check except one. This movie has a very sad ending but completes the crime family saga.

If you loved the Godfather trilogy at the movies, you may want to get this 3 film DVD collection. Even though I had seen the three movies in the past I really enjoyed viewing them again in this DVD set.

The color and clarity in 1080p HD Blu Ray gives these films new life and will give you an even bigger and newfound appreciation for these landmark, history making films.

If you're someone who has never seen any of the Godfather films and is wondering if this is worth buying:  the short answer is yes.  You will not regret it.  Godfather Part 1 & Part 2 are regarded as two of the best films ever made in history, sporting a stellar cast and amazing screenplays.

You have to use a Paramount App that I'm not sure is safe to use on a Kidle because you have to accept apps from outside sources.
The packaging is good. It's nothing fancy. A regular DVD case holds the 3 discs. They are held securely in case you're worried.
You probably already have your own opinion about the 3 movies. I started at the first one and made it half way through the second movie. I plan to pick it back up someday but I will need to be very bored. The trillogy sort of lost me in the middle.  I'm sure I will be happy or hope to be happy when I finish the entire trilogy.

2782077,5,B000NTPDSW,"Godfather I (One) II (tow) and III (three) versus Curious George I (Curious George)  II (Follow that Monkey!) and III ( Back to the Jungle)

  I seldom am able to answer questions like what is my favorite book, movie or flavor of beer and food that goes with beer. Movies? I usually fall back on the Godfather I and II but III always leaves me with bile in my sensitive belly.
  Recently I was given the opportunity to watch Curious George I II and III which has made me rethink my favorite fall back on film and sequels. Godfather II has always been bar none the best sequel ever. Curious George II eclipses Curious George I and Curious George III is not the best but is not a let down like Godfather III.
  Michael Corleone ( Al Pacino) is the main character in the Godfather film trilogy, written by Mario Puzo. Curious George is the main character in the film trilogy played by a lovable animated monkey based on a series of books written by Hans Augusto Rey and Margret Rey.
  I suspect you already see the  is it just coincidence of these two classics.
  Did Puzo borrow from the Rey's early books and did the Rey's borrow from Coppola's ( a popular movie director, screen writer and wino) movies?
  Myself? I call it a draw. The Godfather trilogy is a bit dark and violent . The Curious George trilogy is full of stunts and danger but something you could take a child to. Not a random child but one that might be your own, or someone related to you...After six months of research and interviews I have have discovered that people are as conflicted as myself on this question.

It's basically the same from the previous release, but with a few enhancements. Like the 2001 and 2004 DVDs, the 5.1 remix adds new sound effects which kind of ruin the film to me. However, for this version, they did include for the first time the original mono tracks for the first two films, so classic movie fans can hear what the films originally sounded like back when they were first released in 1972 and 1974. But overall, this is a perfect release of the films. I would recommend you own this timeless classic in your movie collection. BTW, The first one is the best, why? Two words, Marlon Brando!

2782131,2,B000NTPDSW,"After debating over the reviews, I finally decided to buy a copy of ""The Coppola Restoration""  on Blu-ray, thinking that maybe, just maybe, everyone was being a bit too picky.

I could not be more wrong.

Yes, it looks a hell of a lot better than my beloved DVD copy; otherwise the complaints from everyone are valid.

Forget film grain for a moment. And no, I'm not a photographer. I do, however, have a fair enough judgment of quality to see that the picture is murky. Not the darkness of the shadows and hues, but just a dinginess. When you add that to the graininess of the face and ""digital fuzz"" in the backgrounds, amounts to what looks like some kid's 16 mm film project, rather than the greatest film of all time.

I have not looked at the extras addressing the so-called ""restoration,"" but I don't need excuses. The majority of HD transfers I've seen have been stunning, or at the very least acceptable substitutes for their DVD counterparts. This includes many films from the same era--""Serpico"", ""Marathon Man,"" and ""Days of Heaven."" Heck even ""The French Connection"" looked better than this, and we all how Friedkin screwed that transfer.

Undoubtedly the next generation of media will attempt to fix this atrocity, and fans will be on here talking about how it vastly improves on the Blu-Ray, because as of right now the majority of you are in serious denial about these disks.

I'll also comment about the packaging: typical slim-line eco-friendly crap. All 3 disks shoved into one snap case with a simple slip cover. Nowhere near as stylish as the ""bookish"" style DVD package. And as previous reviewers have asked, why would the booklet be just big enough to not fit in the slip case? All in all, a lazy attempt to extort more money out of a priceless gem that's been dipped in crap and dried to a crusty, skid-marked perfection.

Bottom line: this is a bad presentation of one of the most important film series of all time and we're paying for it.",1429747200,,1964,4.623563218390805

2782192,5,B000NTPDSW,"First there was the book; then there were the movies. In 1972, three years after the publication of ""The Godfather,"" Mario Puzo's runaway best-selling novel of the Mafia, Paramount Pictures released the movie ""The Godfather,"" a film that would change the course and tone of gangster films forever. Two years after ""The Godfather,"" came the sequel, ""The Godfather Part II;"" and sixteen years after that, the third and (to date) final sequel, ""The Godfather Part III"" was released. And nothing was ever the same again.

 I could spend countless paragraphs rhapsodizing about these three iconic films, and about how good I think they are. Suffice it to Say, ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Part II"" are genuine masterpieces of filmmaking that rightfully deserve their spots on the American Film Institute's list of the ""100 Greatest American Films of All Time."" And while ""The Godfather Part III""  doesn't quite rise to the level of excellence as its predecessors, it is nevertheless a good movie.

Over the years, I've owned home video versions of ""The Godfather"" movies in nearly every format - VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. I make time at least twice a year to watch `em all. Until recently, I watched ""The Godfather"" films on my ""The Godfather DVD Collection,"" a first-generation set of DVDs that marked the very first time these movies appeared together in this format. I expected the DVD versions to show a dramatic improvement in video and audio quality over the clunky VHS videocassettes, with their annoying 1.33:1 pan-and-scan aspect ratio, that I had previously used; and while there was some improvement, (most notably the correct 1.85:1 aspect ratio,) the DVDs were still a disappointment to me. I saw little difference in the overall quality of video or audio. I was especially irked by the fact that ""The Godfather Part II was put on a ""flipper"" disc.

Then, about a year ago, I discovered ""The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration,"" a four-disc set with each of the three films on its own Blu-ray disc, and a fourth disc containing a wide range of fascinating bonus features. This set - commonly known as ""The Godfather Collection"" - was first released in 2008. It's a complete 4K digital remastering of all three films.  Each of the movies has been meticulously restored frame-by-frame by director Francis Ford Coppola and cinematographer Gordon Willis. The results are astounding; colors are much brighter, images are sharper, the film grain is left intact, black levels are superb, there's no evidence of noise reduction or image enhancement, and the Dolby TrueHD lossless 5.1.soundtrack is totally immersive. Some Blu-ray purists will probably criticize the look of the films as not being ""Blue-ray enough,"" but, in fact, these films now look exactly as I remember when I saw them in theaters forty years ago.

I never tire of watching ""The Godfather"" movies. I saw them repeatedly in theaters, and they were among very first movies I purchased on VHS and DVD when those mediums became widely available to the general public. Now, with ""The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration"" on Blu-ray, I can proudly say I own the definitive collection of the three most iconic and influential greatest gangster films of all time.  I'm sure it will remain one of my most often viewed trio of movies in the years to come.",1424044800,4,3319,4.967567567567568

However, the Godfather, at least, is NOT the theatrical release as it is described. The offensive words have been dubbed over with  ""guinea"" (wherever that comes from). It could have been shown on broadcast TV in the 1970's. And the dubbing is very poor quality, ruining the film.",1419206400,,514,4.576086956521739

2782280,2,B000NTPDSW,"I saw The Godfather when it was originally released in theaters.  A few years later, I was working as an usher at the local mall cinema when Godfather Pt. II was released.  Since I was required to stay in the theater for the entirety of every showing, I wound up watching Godfather II three times a day, 7 days a week for three weeks.

First, I have to mention that yes, Godfather and Godfather II are two of the greatest American films ever.  If you have never seen them or only saw them on TV years ago, don't let anything I say dissuade you from purchasing this Blu Ray release.

Second, it feels like I'm going crazy because such a monumental restoration was undertaken by Robert Harris, with much of the original negative scanned at 4K resolution and both Coppola and Gordon Willis (the cinematographer) have spoken how wonderful the restoration looks.  Gordon Willis even answered the question of how closely the restoration matches his original photography with two words, ""Dead. On.""

And yet ... what I see in this Blu Ray release is not what I watched 63 times in the theater.  Yes, the film was intentionally grainy when shot by Willis.  Yes, both films were shot with a ""brassy"" patina to give it an ""antique"" look.  But when someone like Gordon Willis talks about additional grain, he's talking about a very subtle increase in the film's texture.  The additional grain in the Godfather films when first released was imperceptible to the audience.  Back in 1972 and 1976 no one was talking about the films being grainy!  The ""brass"" patina was a much more subtle effect as well in the original theatrical prints.  The only thing ""controversial"" about the photography in these films is how dark some scenes were shot.

I'm not a film historian.  Bu I have worked in film restoration.  (I worked on the Citizen Kane 50th anniversary release, pulling a large assortment of intermediate negatives, inter-positives, fine grain masters to try and make up for the fact that the camera original negative was destroyed many years ago.)  And I do have my extremely indelible memory of 63 viewings of Godfather II.

So I'm stuck between two realities.  One where I cannot recognize this Blu Ray edition being very close to the films I watched in the theaters.  And the other where I have no reason to question the hard work of the people who did the restoration and certainly no reason to question Coppola and Willis' extremely positive reactions to the restoration.

There's a small number of people out there who agree with my assessment.  (I refer you to Unlucky Frank's thoughtful review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ISEN3A8CF97/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R35ISEN3A8CF97 )

But I keep playing these Blu Rays and then playing the older 2001 non-Blu Ray DVDS (not from restoration) and I just sit there shaking my head because I see very little to no difference whatsoever.

As an example I will focus on the opening Lake Tahoe scenes in Godfather II ... the film I watched 63 times in the theater when it first was released.  While some shots look very good, other shots, particularly in some of the darker scenes both INT and EXT completely lose the deep blacks Willis shot.  It seems to me that Harris and the restoring team did an overall evaluation of the film's contrast, color timing, etc and duped the whole film with the same settings ... instead of making adjustments for each or any of the scenes that came out looking poor.  So you'll be watching a scene where most of the shots look fine, but then the film cuts to some dark exterior night shots and blacks are gone ... replaced by video noise or just a terrible contrast setting that completely ruins the blacks.  These shots look like the original negative had some light fogging.  But that is not the way they looked when released in the theaters.

Also, the color timing will shift from shot to shot.  Scenes in Michael's dark office will look pretty good until suddenly there's a shot where someone's face is GLOWING ORANGE.  There's even a shot of Pacino where not only is his skin color overly orange that it's even picked up a green tinge in the darker areas of his face.

It's very disappointing because you can go for a while in many scenes where the image quality is quite good, only to be confronted with other shots that are so different in brightness, contrast and color that they stop your enjoyment of the films.

I'm amused by so many reviewers here who claim that this version represents the movies as they looked when originally released.  I have a sneaky suspicion that most of these people never saw the films theatrically when first released and are just aping what they've read previously.  All this talk about Willis' ""controversial"" photography being grainy and yellow is nuts.  Willis specifically applied the ""brassy"" patina to the flashback scenes.  If there was any inclination toward yellow in the non-flashback scenes it was originally very subtle.  Trust me, there was never any scenes in the original films where people's faces GLOWED ORANGE.  Indeed, one of the great things about Willis' photography was to shoot dark scenes that had plenty of black in them, and the blacks were crushed to be inky and impenetrable. And you will find that some shots in this Blu Ray edition translate those blacks very close to the original.  But in other shots, whoa, they look like the contrast was turned way down to compensate for those crushed blacks.  Some of these shots are so bad that they look like they came from a bootleg VHS.

I was originally befuddled how such an intense restoration could have created such uneven results.  But now I believe that for some strange reason once the elements for the negative were built, cleaned, repaired, reconstituted to make a new ""restored"" print, when they finally went to make the digital dupe for the Blu Rays, there was no adjustment for the shots that were coming out wrong.

Somewhere at some point, there was a lack of diligence to make sure all the shots looked as good as the shots that were coming out with high image quality. My guess is about 20 - 30% of the shots have poor image quality, but no one took the time to go back and re-dupe these shots to get them to look as good as the other 70 - 80%.

Hopefully someday someone will go back and fix those shots.

Until then, I have to agree with Unlucky Frank.

I just can't agree that this ""Coppola Restoration"" is a better version of the movies than the 2001 non-Blu Ray DVDs.

UPDATE: Dec 5 2014

I watched the documentary on Robert Harris and the restoration process.  At one point he says that they had to find other elements to use where the original negative had been damaged beyond repair.  The doc actually shows what happens when you are watching and suddenly see a shot where the blacks go cloudy, the color gets murky and sometimes oversaturated.  These shots are from when they were forced to use a dupe negative to fill in the shot.  The dupes are a copy from a copy.  Willis shoots for a complete negative, which means down the line in further dupes, lab techs will find the dupe negs cannot hold the values of the original negative.

So when we see these terrible shots in the movie, it's because those shots were from dupe negs.

And in the doc, Harris never mentions how they digitally fixed those shots.  So it appears, digital restoration either didn't work for those shots, or they simply didn't have the time or money to fix all those shots dispersed throughout the film.

Bottom line:  If you are going to sell this blu ray as the essential collectors item, a top notch restoration job supervised by the director, you really need to spend the time to fix those horrible shots.  So disappointed that these dupe negative shots were left in the film as is.  This issue does not hold up to what it claims to be.",1417392000,5,7825,4.670562454346238

2782345,5,B000NTPDSW,"This is the definitive ""Gangster/mobster"" movie trilogy, with so many quotes that are now incorporated into American jargon.  A gripping series, from the first blockbuster release through the second (in my opinion) superior sequel to the third, somewhat less well-scripted conclusion of the three.  It sets the bar for all of the subsequent films of the genre, and there's no trouble for most anyone to identify with the characters; some endearing, some repulsive.  Great storyline that tells so much background of the first movie in the second movie.  Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, the late (great) John Cazale, Brando, Keaton, Duvall....they all became instant superstars.  Essential films for anyone who appreciates theater. Admittedly the third movie is the weakest, but it is essential for closure if you've watched the first two.  Tear open an orange, sit down and enjoy! Oh, and leave the gun; take the cannoli!",1412380800,,915,5.190476190476191

2782410,5,B000NTPDSW,"For the past few years of my life, from a dark era where I had no hope for my life until now, I have always considered The Godfather Trilogy (along with the third film) to be the single greatest film I have ever seen, one that changed my life. Nothing can explain how much this film as influenced me, changed my views on life, and even made me a better person.

From watching the films censored on AMC's Mob Week to the DVD copy of this collection, it was a complete shock and surprise to see these masterpieces on Blu Ray. Some people have stated that there is no difference between this and the DVD prints in terms of picture quality, but here, you are seeing more details of the film and be able to see more of the aging on the character's make up, something I appreciate a lot.

The special features are the same, the little things are the same, etc. If you just want the films and don't care about the quality (which I kind of question your logic unless you don't have a Blu Ray player), then the DVD's will do you just fine. If you need great quality, then buy this set. Believe me: this is an offer that you can't refuse.",1406160000,,1128,4.193548387096774

2782466,5,B000NTPDSW,"I have seen 'The Godfather' films so many times I've lost count. I also own the 6 VHS director's cut which puts the three films together in chronological order and adds well over an hour of great footage (My favorite cut by far!). I was contemplating buying the new restored Blu Ray edition and I'm very glad I decided to go ahead and buy it.

Like a lot of other reviewers have stated the films look better than they ever did, but naturally they do not look like state of the art films made recently. The Blu Ray version is a very noticeable improvement and the films look bright and as clear as they will probably ever look. Coppola wanted a certain grainy look and to remove it completely would be like scrubbing the grit out of The Rolling Stones classic album 'Exile On Main Street'!

Of course I'm talking mainly about the first film as part II looks better although many scenes are still a little dark.  Part III looks exceptional and helps the overall experience of the film since it is by far the least of the three. The extras disc is full of hours of good stuff for hard core fans to navagate through including the extras from the 2001 DVD release which was a nice addition.

The first film is the greatest mob film ever made with the second film rating a very close second (maybe a tie with 'Goodfellas for second place?). Part II has a much more ambitious story and probably deserves top seed, but the character's of Don Vito(Marlon Brando), Tessio(Abe Virgoda), Clemenza(Bruno Kirby) and Sonny(James Caan)are sorely missed in part 2. That's not to say that the second film doesn't have great characters, I just prefer the original characters to the characters in part II.

What is incredible is the casting of Don Vito(Robert DeNiro), Clemenza(Bruno Kirby) and Tessio(John Aprea) in part II, it's very believable that these young guys are those older guys in the first film. The very underrated John Cazale gives a fantastic performance in part II as Fredo. As good as Pacino is in these films, he is not very likable and I find the other characters more appealing and interesting. I could have watched an entire film just following the young Don, Clemenza and Tessio for part II.

I know the third film has been bashed to bits, but how could part III have not been a disappointment? With what it had to live up to, it's surprising it was ever made. I have grown to like it more over the years. If only Duvall and Coppola could have come to a money agreement, I think the film would have been much better. For one it would have added another brilliant actor in the film and maybe that would have forced Coppola to edit out some of the religious overload.

If you have a Blu Ray player this is a must have as these films will probably never look better. My only gripe is they should have made this a deluxe box set with the director's cut of all three films included too, it has never seen a DVD release. I guess, I won't be retiring my VCR just yet. It's an amazing piece of work with a lot of stuff that was cut out of the original films. I'm not talking throw away stuff either, it's as close to watching a book as you'll ever get. Hopefully they will release it someday soon!",1399507200,2,3192,4.427597955706985

 Well though my husband does enjoy Robert De Niro and Al Pacino movies generally very much, this happens to not be one of his more favorites! Shock to me!!
 I could swore about 15 years ago when it came out he just loved it!! But as he says compared to Raging Bull or Scent of Woman he rather enjoy those but this is very enjoyable movie just he like others bit more. You just cannot win trying to do something nice for your spouse at times!
 I still think though, once it is on, he will again be mesmerized with wonderful acting and mob way of killing people as if it has no damage on one's souls...or as my husband say it really does not on some. I choose to believe eventually near end of one's life they do have regrets.
 i know he love the scenes at Tahoe though i caught that they were filming it from different areas of the lake having grown up and realize exactly where the main party scene is held. I love looking at Mt Tallac across the lake...but than it is not lol! as i we climbed it numerous times for easy jaunt on slow day.
I do think this is such a well written and directed movie that one both men and women will enjoy. I just did not like the horse head and keep saying to myself it is a fake...how could someone do that to such a beautiful creature?
I wish that Sonny had not become the man he did and regrets it ...is it destroying of his soul or that period? Both?
Al Pacino should i wish could do or get some better roles or move forward to different style as De Niro and Nicholson has gone to do so well in lighter romantic comedies. Where both female and male leading stars are aged, not so great bodies but with just a look, a touch, a lifetime of knowing what real love passes out to the audience.
 I wish Pacino who started this in Scent of Woman had continued do make few others as he was so wonderful and realistic in both tired of painful lonely life and finding life again right at last moment.
So of course this is great movie....just not as great as i hoped my husband would have thought it be on fowl weather day with us home alone.  Maybe says something about each of us?",1395705600,,2326,4.087719298245614

Had to send the first two sets back because III wouldn't read - and I had never seen it. The 3rd set read fine - unfortunately - what a turkey of a movie. The great copy of The Godfather (I) was worth the price - and five stars.,1395273600,,335,3.732394366197183

2782536,4,B000NTPDSW,"Love how it came with all three movies, great movies. Incredible storylines, expect, Godfather 3.
Really weak way to end your franchise, but then again, what can you do, you did everything else in the first two.
Any fan should buy this set of the movies, also a problem with it is that they came in tiny thin dvd cases. I would have preferred maybe a flip open cases, but I already knew what I was getting. But it all great movies, weak ending, alright dvd cases, and 4 stars.",1394668800,,476,4.3

2782538,4,B000NTPDSW,"I have nothing new to say about I and II, cinematic gems without question. Part III fails to hit the heights mainly due to bad casting, Sophia Coppolla obviously, losing Robert Duvall and replacing with George Hamilton and Al Pacino's lapses into overacting. That said it is not a bad film and still very watchable. All three films look fantastic on Blu-Ray, worth replacing my old dvd versions.",1394668800,,395,4.823529411764706

For people that say ""it doesn't look like blu-ray, or the videos don't look ""perfect"", you ahve to understand when these films were made...Back then, there was technology that we would consider ""stone age"" today....In fact, I am surprised that they came out as godd as they did....More than satisfied.",1394323200,,576,4.877551020408164

If you have this series already on DVD I would highly recommend the upgrade to ""The Coppola Restorations,"" it's like watching entirely new films.",1394064000,,324,4.551724137931035

2782558,5,B000NTPDSW,"I normally have no reason to buy Blu Ray discs for something clearly not formatted for the media, but this is the restored version and it's all 3 movies in a single package. I got this when Amazon dropped the price to $16 and simply couldn't resist. Keep in mind the age of this movie and understand you will see plenty of flaws and grain. Even though it's been restored the movie was made in the 70s. Never the less, it's a great bundle, a good transfer and the movies are still incredibly enjoyable. I had the previous boxed set and grabbed this because of the sale price.",1393977600,,574,4.324074074074074

2782561,5,B000NTPDSW,"I consider the Godfather film to be the best ever, excellent story, superb acting. This restoration plays well on the large video screens and the audio is very good on the sound bars of todays TV sets. Having never played an earlier original Godfather on this hardware I cannot say with authority that the restoration was better than the original, although I believe the restoration is superior to the earlier productions.",1393977600,,422,4.957746478873239

2782566,5,B000NTPDSW,"This is such a great collection, with a whole extra disc full of bonus material.  These films are masterpieces.  I love watching the progression of Michael from the beginning of the first film, where he is kept completely out of the family business, through to the end of the last film, when he is decidedly in the family business.  These restorations a real treat, being able to see the films so clearly.",1393891200,,405,4.597222222222222
2782567,5,B000NTPDSW,"Very well thought-out recreation of the original.  Very expensive, too, but well worth it.  No one has ever put this much time or money into restoring a film into a Blu-Ray, much less a DVD.  Quality is excellent.  It;s like watching it again on the big screen in the '70's.

2782569,5,B000NTPDSW,"What is there to say?  A beautiful, scrubbed transfer of an absolute masterpiece (we're working under the assumption that Godfather 3 does not exist here).  Every performance is brilliant, every shot a work of art.  The new print looks crisp, giving detailed glimpses of never before seen detail, while still retaining the rich atmosphere.
Sorry to come off like a cliche, but this is the perfect film, presented as perfectly as technology currently allows.",1393891200,,457,5.148648648648648

The third one isn't the greatest, but the first two are so good it doesn't even matter. Seeing them in Blu ray only re-affirms my opinion. Francis Ford Coppola will be remembered as one of the greatest filmmakers ever. This trilogy is must see.",1393891200,,378,4.338028169014085

Sadly, the 3rd Godfather movie is a letdown, but for the price of this set, it's like you're getting a third movie as a bonus.

2782585,5,B000NTPDSW,"Watching this movie over 30 years after seeing it for the first time, now with my wife and 15 yr. old son, was quite an experience.  This movie is masterful.
Still gory, though not as bad as the more recent trend in graphic violence, I caution those with delicate sensibilities.
The values of the characters are so horrible and the contradictions in their beliefs so obvious that it's still amazing to me how individuals can compartmentalize such things.

The actors who were, or became super famous from this movie are breathtaking:
Brando was already a star, but continued in this iconic role.
Al Pacino was the new and increasingly powerful star.
Diane Keaton's role here was limited, but she went on to bloom as a fine actress.
Robert Duvall started here and went on to become do legendary acting.
James Caan was featured here and continued a fine career.
Talia Shire, who I did not remember was in this,  went on to do a great role in Rocky.
Abe Vigoda was an excellent character actor.

If you have time, treat yourself to this magnificent work.
And note, that the mob makes it's money from the things that government makes illegal, but which people will buy anyway:
booze (prohibition, not in this movie), prostitution, gambling, drugs, etc.  And along the way, the police, courts, politicians and even the church are totally corrupted with the mob's undue profits from those businesses being illegal.",1393891200,5,1408,4.825726141078838
2782586,5,B000NTPDSW,"So far, I have watched only the original Godfather, so everything I say is based on that.  This is a terrific movie, at least a top contender for my all-time favorite.  Over all, I was very pleased with the restoration.  Some other reviewers have complained about artifacts, and the artifacts are there.  You'll see them if you look for them.  But they are not obtrusive.  Once I got caught up in the movie, they vanished.  I simply didn't see them any more.  This is a terrific restoration, and I'm very glad I bought it.",1393891200,,522,4.4787234042553195

2782593,4,B000NTPDSW,"This is a beautiful restoration, which I purchased on a 1-day special under $20. Frankly, I had never seen ""The Godfather"" or its sequels because I was an NSA operative near Vietnam at the time of release in 1972. Coppola obviously gave great care to this collection and it's current restoration; a wonderful thing.

Some of the young cast, including Pacino, have gone on to huge careers. It was interesting to see them as young men.

I'm not a Hollywood Technical Director, in fact I can't spell Dolby. However, I enjoyed watching ""The Godfather.""

I love both of the first parts of this trilogy but find Godfather III disappointing and it's all I can do to wade through it.

The picture quality is obviously much better than the old VHS -  and while it retains the graininess of the original movie there is still a marked improvement in the clarity. Please note that I upgraded from tape to blu-ray; I'm not certain how much difference there would be from dvd to blu-ray.

The main advantage of getting the full collection instead of just buying ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather, Part II"" is the fourth disc of features and extras, which are not included in the stand-alone Blu Rays.  I probably would have never watched ""Part III"" were it not part of this collection and it's worth watching, although I won't wear it out like I will Parts I & II.",1393891200,,530,4.443298969072165

I will say that after watching my copies on DVD over the last 10 years, seeing these restored Blu Ray versions is almost like watching a new movie. It is so crisp and clear, it's an entirely new experience. I was sucked in to the movies in a way I've never been before.

It's almost like watching a VHS tape recorded to a blu-ray disc. If all you care about is seeing a masterpiece, whatever the quality, then this is the set for you. If you want a masterpiece in blu-ray quality, then avoid this set. You'll be very disappointed -- as I was.

The Corleone family could certainly not ber viewed as boy scouts.  Deceit and murder were their stock in trade, as it was with the other Mafia families.  The struggles for power, the greed, and corruption, are all factors in the lives of these criminal organizations.  One can watch these films over and over again.  And still find new insights into the crimial life style.  I purchased these films for their excellent portayals of organized crime.

I rented a DVD Netflix version of part 1 and it was terrible from the poor copy it was made from.

2782776,5,B000NTPDSW,"This review is for the ""Coppola Restoration"" Blu-ray. The restoration work is fantastic, the movies all look vibrant and the original mood, color and lighting of each scene as determined by the Director and the DP have been retained. The extras include many scenes that have been included in the TV and alternate versions that have been shown, but the 3 films have been restored to their original cinematic versions. I am one of the fans who simply cannot not watch any of these films if I catch them on while channel surfing, and I am very happy I have these restorations. And yes, I even think part three was amazing despite the rather dull acting of Sophia Coppola.",1376870400,,668,4.621848739495798

It all sounded so good with so many 5 star reviews that I just plunged in and bought it.  Fortunately I was able to return the DVDs for a refund.  I give Amazon 5 stars for that.

I will either have to upgrade my DVD player (not likely) or purchase a different version of these great movies.  Incidentally, the DVDs did play but the quality was nothing to brag about.  Maybe that's only because I need to upgrade.  I'll never know.  The problem with the DVDs was that some menu functions were inaccessible or non-working and some functions operated from buttons on the remote labeled for an entirely different function.  At one point the DVD player froze up and only by unplugging it from the power outlet was I able to turn it off.  So buyer beware.",1375142400,5,1110,4.522613065326633

My biggest complaint is that the jacket it came in was very abused. All the corners were beat up and torn. It didn't appear to be the packaging but rather that the item was sitting in a warehouse for a while. The person who packaged should have noticed the damage.

So I called Amazon and after maybe 30 seconds on hold I was speaking with a very helpful representative who laughed with me and apologized deeply on behalf of Amazon.  He told me that it would ship out right away and that I would get the shipping info to return the empty case at my leisure.  And that was that, they were easy to deal with on the phone, the whole call process took less than ten minutes and the best part is it was shipped next day priority!

2782908,5,B000NTPDSW,"I have alwasy love ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather part 2"". They are great movies. Unfortunately, ""The Godfather part 3"" was just a way for Coppola to grab more money off the Godfather name. It should had never been made. If you pay close attention to part 3, it just a replay of the other two movies, without the great story line behind them. IMO, it's a toatal waste.

The Blu-ray version is very good PQ. It's what these movies needed, specially after all these years. If you're a fan of ""The Godfather"" movies, you should get this Blu-ray. For me ""The Godfather is a movie I can watch over & over.

I have one wish. That Coppola would release in Blu-ray ""The Godfather Saga"". This was on tv many, many years ago...I believe on Bravo as a mini series, (before Bravo went to the trash reality shows.) It showed the story of the Godfather and Godfather 2, but in  chronological order. It starts in Sicily like part 2, and takes you all the way to where Michael takes over as Godfather. I can't remember if it takes you to Las Vegas and where Michael becomes so paranoid. But IMO, it's the greatest version of the Godfather that was ever made.(This was way before Godfather part 3 was even an ideal.)

So get it and get a few cannolies to have when watching it...oh, don't forget, leave the gun, but take the cannolies!",1364256000,13,1322,4.42798353909465

Godfather 1 and 2 are iconic films that do not lose any of their appeal with time. The color and sharpness of these films almost tempts me to watch Godfather 3 but I have not succumbed to that yet.

Coppola's own understanding of families rooted in a non-American culture (Italian and Sicilian for this purpose) gave him an unique perspective on how to approach the development of the entire story and the characters involved in it.

His high care for all details setting the frame for the story, both in terms of physical setting and human nature, gets the reader of the trilogy a capability to participate in the plot almost as a silent actor.

He shows a lot of respect for the foreign culture and language of the characters.  I really enjoyed the trilogy and I highly recommend it.

Also if you don't finish watching it in one setting, when you go back to finish watching it, instead of starting where you left off, it STARTS OVER AND you have to fast forward it to the place you left off watching.

Most of the features are carried over from the dvd's but i didn't have the dvd of part 3 so I enjoyed hearing the commentary track for that film. Overall you can tell a lot of love and care was put into this restoration and set and the packaging is great comes with the slipcover and plastic case.

There was some damage/deterioration to the originals which was painstakingly corrected along with much better sound quality. All of this is explained in the bonus DVD which is just another perk to owning this set, as well as a little cast/movie booklet.

If you have never seen any or all of these movies, this is a must-see movie collection. I had never seen parts II or III and was very pleased to finally understand the Godfather saga.

The movie stories are well acted and intriguing depicting the life of Mafia types including the killings as well as the commitment to ""family"" showing honor along with treachery. Truly, very exciting cinematography...Movies to be seen again and again.",1360108800,,926,5.0064935064935066

Too bad my VHS copy looks better!

Now I know why it was only $18 on Amazon - because only Coppolla has the brand spanking new bluray player required to view this presentation properly!

2783060,5,B000NTPDSW,"I was a regular watcher of the Godfather movies on cable, because they are great films and I did not own them. The first time I saw the Blue Ray edition of Godfather was when AMC (I think) showed it on cable when the Blue Ray came out. I remember watching it and thinking, ""Wow, is this the same movie?"" This reaction was even though I have a HD tv but don't subscribe to HD content. Even then I could see the difference.

The Blue Ray Coppola Restoration is a wonderful visual feast, and much better audio quality. The restoration is so much clearer, it's almost like seeing the movies for the first time. The audio on The Godfather was good, but the audio punch of machine gun fire into Michael's bedroom near the start of the second movie, actually caused me to turn it down but then turn the volume up a bit and kept at that volume. The audio is MUCH better than previous movies I've seen on cable.

At first, I thought one of the discs was defective, but it turns out, it played fine but was Godfather III.

2783065,5,B000NTPDSW,"As I slowly upgrade my DVD collection to Blu-ray (a process I expect to finish right around the time Blu-ray's replacement becomes common), I caught this set on sale and snapped it up without a moment's hesitation. I already owned the 4-disc DVD collection that came out in 2001, and all things considered, I probably should have just stuck with that edition.

That's not to say there's anything wrong with this collection. There isn't. It's as perfect as can be - not just the films themselves, but the transfer and the presentation as well. The extras are excellent, as well. Parts of the transfer are better than the older DVD edition. And strangely, that's the problem.

Over the years, the original negatives for the first two films were essentially destroyed. A great effort at restoration has been made for this collection, and where it worked, the effect is stunning. In those scenes, the film looks like it was shot yesterday - perhaps not as sharp as one might expect, but the colors are vibrant and edges are much sharper than before, without losing that beautiful grain or the warmed tones so characteristic of these films.

That's where the restoration worked. In some scenes, however, scans had to be taken from different prints, or so much reconstruction was necessary that the finished scene simply looks different from the ones before and after it. These interludes are brief and rare, but I found them difficult to ignore. Conversely, watching the DVD with upscaling in my BD player - even though that transfer was roundly criticized for being dark and somewhat murky - offers a much more uniform ""look"" throughout viewing, and with nearly the same level of sharpness. It's less distracting.

If you don't already own a copy of this utter masterpiece, shame on you, buy this right now. If you don't think you'll be as annoyed by the visual inconsistency as I am, buy it. You'll rarely find treasure for so low a price. I certainly plan to keep my copy, and will in all likelihood part with the DVD (the Blu-ray has the distinct advantage of taking up half as much shelf space) but this is one of those rare times when I would have liked an ""unrestored"" option to be available. With only one film per disc, there certainly was enough room.",1359417600,14,2256,4.732824427480916

The supplements from the 2001 set release are all here and are in their original standard definition. The commentary by Coppola is also carried over (but it is never really exciting; though it can be interesting for a few minute details at times). The new extras for 2008 are all in high definition. Of the new extras, I really only found the featurette of ""The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't"" and the featurette on the restoration process to be of any interest. The rest are throwaways, and some are damn silly at that.

I can't remember the last time you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship. And you feared to be in my debt.
Bonasera: I didn't want to get into trouble.
Don Corleone: I understand. You found paradise in America. You had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. So you didn't need a friend like me. Now you come and say ""Don Corleone, give me justice."" But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me ""Godfather."" You come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder - for money.
Bonasera: I ask you for justice.
Don Corleone: That is not justice. Your daughter is alive.
Bonasera: Let them suffer then as she suffers.
[the Don is silent]
Bonasera: How much shall I pay you?
[the Don turns away dismissively, but Bonasera stays on]
Don Corleone: Bonasera, Bonasera, what have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, this scum who ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by some chance an honest man like yourself made enemies they would become my enemies. And then, they would fear you.
Bonasera: Be my friend... Godfather.
[the Don at first shrugs, but upon hearing the title he lifts his hand, and a humbled Bonasera kisses the ring on it]
Don Corleone: Good.
[He places his hand around Bonasera in a paternal gesture]
Don Corleone: Some day, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, consider this justice a gift on my daughter's wedding day.
[a gratified Bonasera offers his thanks and leaves]

All three films look amazing. The best they ever have. The first DVD release was a huge improvement in picture quality and clarity over the VHS, and this Blu-ray takes it even further.

The picture looks perfect. For years, the image was murky, and a bit too dark, but here it is brought back to the way it was meant to be seen.

Now, I know no one likes The Godfather Part III, and because of this, some people may instead opt to go for the standalone versions of The Godfather and The Godfather Part II in order to save a few bucks. But, considering the wealth of special features, most of which are not available on the standalone sets, the extra few dollars for this set is worth it.

The only thing I wish this set has was the edited-for-TV version of The Godfather Parts I & II, as it would be cool to sometimes have the option to watch those two movies in chronological order.

2783127,3,B000NTPDSW,"We all know how great this trilogy blu ray is - all those reviews can't be wrong.

I'm just fairly upset as I received this in the mail yesterday and to say the box was beat up would be an understatement.  I know it wasn't the carrier's fault as I purchased about 7 or 8 other blu rays in the same amazon order & box - all were in perfect condition.

The back of the box is unfortunately where the glossy godfather linear notes booklet is contained - one of the corners was completed folded in half beyond repair.  Both top and bottom of the glossy notes, as well as the box itself were beat up 'almost' to the point of being ripped.  They can't be creased back into shape.  The plastic case insert holding the godfather 3 blu had been torn off the hinge.  Luckily the discs themselves appear fine.

I got this at the current discounted price of $19.99 but, it's the principle of the purchase..  A brand new product should not be in this condition.  If I bought this used from an ebay seller I'd almost give negative feedback based in the condition of this box, let alone a brand new sealed set of blu rays direct from amazon.com.

I know I could probably seek replacement through amazon but, without being intimate with the process, I'm guessing I'd have to send it back, and wait for a new one.  I'm in Australia so the process would probably take a month in shipping time back and forth - for a $20 purchase, I just can't be bothered.  However, for note amazon : pick up the Quality Control of your products before shipping please.  New.. = new condition.  A real let down and disappointment on what is otherwise one of the best blu ray releases ever - one that I should have been able to cherish with pride of place on the shelf, with the rest of my 1000 strong collection of blu rays!

The transer to blu-ray is amazing and really does the movie justice especially in the darker parts of the film.  This was Coppola's masterpiece and you can tell they took the time to make it look as good as possible.  They added a few special features in 2008 that wasn't in some of the past release of the Trilogy, and with those, there is A LOT to look forward to if you're a fan of the films, or even film in general.

It is inexcusable for this landmark piece of American film history. Amazon has the spec wrong, and the packaging conveniently does not list the aspect ratio.

So I'll make this review short and to the point.

This set has the terrifying ""Discs made in Mexico"" sticker that is synonym of cheap labor and low quality control. You better check your discs for fingerprints and even scratches on the data side.

I knew that there was something up when I bought this boxset for only $22.49, it just didn't occured to me at the time that this was the reason for the dirty-cheap price.

Even then, I've decided to knock only one star down from this review, because, like I already said, these movies are masterpieces and I was really happy to finally have them on my slowly growing Blu-Ray collection.

So for all of you guys that are always concerned about the country of origin of your products, this is a Mexican boxset.",1341619200,3,886,4.547169811320755
2783146,5,B000NTPDSW,"I had never seen the Godfather movies, but after ordering this I've definitely falling in love with these films. The first two are phenomenal while the third is still good, but somewhat subpar when compared to the first two. The quality is great on all the films, with this being the best transfer ever made. The sound is also great. For any fan of Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed, and other gangster movies, The Godfather is definitely the original that inspired them all. GREAT COLLECTION GREAT MOVIES.
The only gripe I have is with the packaging. The slip cover folded up on the side a little too soon for my taste (after a couple days) and the little insert booklet barely fits inside the package, but overall a great buy for the price.",1340409600,,741,4.621212121212121

2783148,4,B000NTPDSW,"I have to say I love the godfather trilogy. I purchased the collection on DVD way before the Coppola restoration came out and I just loved them. I have seen each movie at least 6-7 times a year since I bought them.
With them coming out on blu-ray, I was really having high expectations that the movies would look great in 1080p. Boy was I wrong (with the exception of the godfather 3 but I'll get into that later)
The first and second movie looked exactly as the DVD version did, though maybe not as grainy in some parts but for the most part, it looked identical, the sound and color had been enhanced a bit but nothing that said ""WOW"" to me. I can totally understand why, the technology wasn't present when they filmed them over 30 years ago, but come on, this was billed as ""like you've never seen"" and it wasn't.
The third movie was great in my opinion, others my disagree but I thought that it was filled with as much deceit, intrigue, and murder as the others before it. Maybe this one was too much centered on action and the needless inclusion of Sophia Coppola (Why Francis why?)  as Michael's Daughter. but anyways, back to the review. The picture looks totally better than the dvd version. I could actually see fine detail that I didn't think I could.

So should you buy this Blu-ray box set?
yes-only if you don't have the dvd version.
no- if you have the dvds, don't bother, except for the third movie.

2783157,5,B000NTPDSW,"With this Blu-ray, I have no objection to the grain level, the darkness, the washed-out whites; they all add to the effect and most of these ""flaws"" were part of Coppola's and his cinematographer's vision.  I think the film is stunning on Blu-ray; it's like watching it again for the first time, so many details I never noticed before.

However, the super-saturated yellows of the film, very much a part of the artistic vision (Willis showed it to Coppola in the dailies after a day of shooting and Coppola loved the colors) I am sad to say I find too much to take for the length of the film.  I do love the golden yellows for about a half hour.  It's beautiful.  But I gotta reluctantly join the crowd who eventually, at some point in the otherwise blissful viewing, have to say, ""GOSH DAMN THIS IS SO ORANGE I'M GOING TO DIE!""

The solution is easy.  It also may be seen by some as total heresy to be thumbsed down with all the power of God's own keystroke.  Go into your HD television's manual or advanced manual picture menu and turn down the color.  No, wait!  Don't kill me!  Hear me out.  I'm not saying to make it less yellow in relation to the other colors.  That, I admit, would be a sin.  But just turn all the colors down some.  And look at the result.  If you're like me, you won't want to love it.  It's too close to saying the film made a mistake in it's famous yellowness.  But frankly, with just a litlle desaturation, you can turn this near-radioactive yellowness into one of the most beautiful movies you ever saw.  The relief my eyes felt at the calmer colors relaxed me and I took in so much amazing detail.  After 50+ previous viewings of The Godfather, it was like I finally got to see it in all its glory.  The slightly desaturated, Blu-ray viewing of The Godfather is, in my opinion, the best home-viewing experience ever to be had.  Try it out.  If it doesn't make you feel too dirty, I believe you'll thank me.",1337990400,,1937,4.349162011173185

Just a little note, not all Italians are members of the mafia, as a matter of fact, very few are.  I'm Italian and before I got married to my husband, my mother-in-law asked me if I had a Godfather.  Having been raised a Catholic, I said yes.  Her next question was, does he always carry a gun?  I looked at my soon to be husband because I was confused, and he said she had just seen the Godfather movie and was refering to a mafia Godfather.  I assured her that my Godfather happened to be my baptisimal Godfather in the Catholic Church.  Thought you might like this true story.

At times the Blu-ray will be clearer but not often...and they did something with skin tones making them look less natural sometimes blotchy.

I just absolutely can't believe how clean the Godfather movies look compared to how they looked when each of them premeired. The Godfather I and II looked like they were made yesterday because There are absolutely no scratches, blemishes, discoloration or color fading. The Godfather III looks really wonderful to considering it's not as old as the first two. The restoration must have been really expensive to make the movies look this good. The bonus features are really good to, even though they were passed over from the previous dvd edition. The one thing that could have been good, though, was if they put back the original Paramount logos from the 1970s for the  Godfather I and II, but I don't think it really matters, because the movies look nice and clear anyways.  Like I said, the restoration the the Godfather trilogy is wonderful!

No explanation why they didn't know until long after everyone else knew.

While Michael is in Corleone he marries a beautiful local girl who is killed by one of Michael's bodyguards. The scene showing the revenge killing of the bodyguard in America, is cut.

In Godfather 2 the scenes of Vito's revenge on the guards that searched for him when he was a young boy, threatening anyone that would help him, cut. You get the idea, many scenes known to the fans of these movies were cut by the director!

These restorations are BEAUTIFUL and I'm so glad that I have them all at the great price of $25.00 - I was skeptical when the offer came out but after watching the restoration of the first movie along with most of the second, all I can say is - ""WOW!""

The scenes in Cuba in Godfather II are nothing short of breath taking and the sound quality is great! I have a 46"" Samsung flat screen and a high quality surround sound system and I was absolutely blown away. Is it dark? It most certainly is...but the original producers/directors meant it to be. If you watch the extra on DVD #4 ""Emulsional Rescue Revealing The Godfather HD"", you will understand why everything is dark. My father remembered seeing this in the theatre in 1974 and said these scenes were as good/better than he remembers.

Order this and watch it...you won't be sorry. For all those who talk about aspect ratio; mine played just fine in 16:9 aspect ratio and filled the whole screen. The only way I could get it to play in Letterbox was when I forced the TV to do so. I am SOOOOOOOOO glad that I went through with this purchase and will enjoy it for many years to come.

2783194,5,B000NTPDSW,"Do not listen to the reviewers who say the blu-ray transfer is not good. Are you kidding me? These people must be blind or have a terrible monitor. I also own the DVD Godfather Collection and I did a comparison on my Sharp 70"" Aquos (which is one awesome looking HD tv) and the difference between the blu-ray and DVD is outstanding! The DVD color is washed out, whereas the blu-ray color is vibrant and alive! I honestly could not believe the difference. It was shocking how bad the DVD looked. I know that regular DVD's can look bad on large flat screens, even with the upconverter players, but this was unbelievable. The DVD was dull looking and very grainy. The blu-ray brings clarity to the picture. I know the DVD probably looks good on a smaller HD tv but it looks absolutely horrible on a 70"". By the same token, blu-ray practically looks 3D on the newer large screens that are not 3D.

There is some grain still on parts of the blu-ray on Godfather 1, but it is 10 times worse on the DVD so I was not upset with that. The movie is 40 years old.....only so much you can do with it, to be sure. Only thing I wasn't so impressed with was the new 5.1 sound....it was a little hollow and needed some bass. Again, 40 years old. Godfather 3 looked stunning, picture-wise, no grain at all.

Definitely worth the money if you are a fan. And I'm not sure what all this talk is about it being in 4:3 ratio. Mine was not and the format is not 2.35:1, nor is it advertised as that. It actually just says ""letterboxed"". But in any case, the correct ratio for these movies is 1.85:1, which fills a widescreen tv without stretching or zooming.

I saw the can't beat bargain price of $25 for the Coppola Restoration Bluray Set - great deal.  Unfortunately, the quality of the bluray transfer is not good.  I thought I was watching a VHS version on my big screen LCD TV.  This is just poor...I thought maybe the indoor scenes were grainy because of the low light but the outdoor scenes (Wedding and dancing) are just as bad.  Not sure what happened here but this is not Bluray quality at all.  Disappointing and a bad product.  Wait for a new digitally remastered release I guess.",1331164800,,633,4.405172413793103

2783201,1,B000NTPDSW,"So, I love Amazon.  I'm a Prime member, and happy to pay for it.  I've spent hundreds already this year.

Anyway, this is my first truly bad experience with Amazon.  I ordered this item&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather-Collection-The-Coppola-Restoration-Blu-ray/dp/B000NTPDSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather Collection (The Coppola Restoration) [Blu-ray</a>] as a Deal of the Day on Feb 21.  You'd think, being a deal of the day, they'd actually have some in stock.  Nope.  I'm told I'll get the item sometime in mid March.

I leave a comment about it, and I get an apology and I'm told they'll rush my order.  This moves the expected delivery up ONE WHOLE DAY.  Not a big deal in the end, since I've now received the item.  Fair enough, right?

Nope again!!!  I open the item (it's mine now, isn't it?), pop it in the PS3, and we've got us a nice enough looking picture, but it's 4:3 (or thereabouts).  Certainly not the advertised 2.35:1, or the suspected actual 1.85:1 or 16:9 that others are reporting.  No, this has thick black bars on either side, and no, it's not my PS3, because everything else fills my screen.  My TV auto-detects the resolution of the input, and when the disk plays, it tells me it's changing from 1080i to 480i.

Not pleased at all.  We'll see if they let me return it.

Edit:  2nd set has arrived, and the same issue is present.  The product page now reads,

""Item Under Review

2783204,5,B000NTPDSW,"I was 12 when I walked into the den and saw a lavish wedding on TV. I asked my mom what movie was playing, and she said, ""The Godfather."" I asked if I could watch. She warned me that it was violent and had sex in it, but I still wanted to watch it. That was the first time I watched an R - rated film, and the first time I was introduced to the wonder that is the The Godfather Saga.

I got this DVD set for Christmas, and I have no complaints about the quality of the picture. Yes, it's very a very dark picture at times, but that only adds to the mood and beauty of the films. The commentary by Francis Ford Coppola is entertaining and informative, and even the deleted scenes are great. I haven't watched the documentaries yet, but I'm sure I'll enjoy those as well.

Of course, there are naysayers who think that since it's not surround - sound and isn't crystal clear like today's movies that it's an inferior product. I disagree; this is a great print of the earlier films, and you don't need it to be up to the standards of, say, AVATAR, to be beautiful cinematography. Moreover, I don't need to be assaulted on all sides by gun blasts to appreciate the fact that a character is getting shot.

Well my chance came back week before last and it was in the Gold Box again and I didn't wait this time. Yes there is some graininess but in all honesty I feel that just adds to the movie and the entire feeling as a whole. Myself personally I feel this collection is great; there are some touch-ups done but for the most part it is intact and enjoyable for me. I love these kind of mobster flicks and they make up a good bit of my collection and I will say when it comes to mobster type movies this one is at the top of the list. If you want something that is the latest and greatest just wait for a decent mobster flick to come out but you will be missing out on this classic that is for sure.,1330560000,,825,3.9166666666666665

I don't understand how people can say these Godfather Blu-Rays look good.  I was very disappointed.  I thought they did a terrible job making these Blu-Rays.  I saw these movies on Satellite in 1080i HD, and I thought they looked better.  After watching all 3 movies on Blu-Ray, I put in my DVD of the Godfather, and my intitial thought was that the DVD was better.  The DVD seems brighter, with less grain. But, then I turned on the Blu-Ray again, and decided the Blu-Ray was better, and had better detail.  But, there is not much difference between the Blu-Ray and DVD.  The Blu-Ray has more grain, but does have better detail.

Amazon did change the product description to list the aspect ratio as 1.85:1, which is what it is.  2.35:1 was previously listed.

How can some of the reviewers say this Blu-Ray presentation is great?  Are there two different Blu-Ray versions of these movies?  Do I have the ""bad"" version?",1330387200,3,1022,4.636871508379889

I knew it was too good to be true when reading the package details and regret selling my previous 'Godfather' box set. As for the new bonus material, I enjoyed most of it (some of it is useless FLUFF!), but all of the extras could've been placed on a single disc.

I can't add more than the others about this series, but you know that at least the first two are generally regarded as some of the all time great movies in cinematic history.  Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Deniro...some of the all time greats.  Highly recommend.  Especially if you can get it cheap!",1329955200,,462,4.428571428571429

Finally saw Parts I & II following my high school graduation and have been a fan of both movies ever since.  Like most Hollywood classics, they never get old.

2783213,5,B000NTPDSW,"DVD Running Time: 2 hours, 56 mins. Rated ""R"".
It was the first, The Godfather (1972), that set new standards for movie-making. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, don't be fooled by the title. This is not an innocent, family movie by no means. American movie theater patrons had never seen a movie so violent. The story content and the way it was filmed would change Hollywood movies forever.

 The Godfather is based on the life of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He has a large family in New York. This is the day of his daughter's wedding. Men that Mr. Corleone has been friends with are now coming to him for the help they need. He is a powerful man in New York. He is respectfully called ""Godfather"". One man tells Godfather, in his darkened office, that his daughter was raped. In order for Godfather to take care of the matter, you will be asked to do a job for him someday.
  Johnny Faontane (Al Martino) wants a part in a movie. The director, Jack Woltz, (John Marley) doesn't want him for the role. So The Godfather sends his private lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert DuVall) to California to talk to the director. As a friend, give The Godfather what he wants. The director refuses to put Johnny in his movie. Hagen says Mr. Corleone insists on hearing bad news immediately. By morning, the director finds out how serious Mr. Carleone is. Never refuse him and say ""No"".

Cast: Marlon Brando, Robert DuVall, Al pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Costellano, Abe Vigoda, Al Lettieri, John Marley, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, John Cazale, Al Martino, Morgana King, Alex Rocco, Vito Scotti, Salvatore Corsitto.

 11 Academy Award Nominations. Only won for Best Picture, Best Actor: Marlon Brando (He refused award), Best Writing.

 Talia Shire was brilliant in the fight scene with Gianni Russo as ""Carlo"". Some of it was ad-libbed. Who will never forget that Italian curse word.

 The story continues in 1958 as Michael Corleone is the new mafia Godfather. First we are taken back to the past in 1901 in Sicily when Vito Corleone was only 9 years old (Oreste Baldini) and his father's funeral is taking place. His father was killed for making an insult to the mafia chieftain in Sicily. Over the course of the movie, we will see how the adult Vito (Robert DeNiro) became the powerful Godfather.
 Back to 1958, Michael (Al Pacino) now lives in Lake Tahoe and owns and controls two major hotels. He intends of acquiring four more hotels against the dislike of Senator Geary (G.D. Spradlin) who does not like the Corleone family in Nevada. Micheal tells the Senator he intends to pay nothing for the hotels and the Senator himself must put up the money for them for the licensing fee.
 Someone is after Micheal.

Also in the cast: Robert DeNiro, Bruno Kirby Jr., Lee Strasberg, Danny Aiello, Gwen Verdon, Michael V. Gazzo, Troy Donahue, John Apera, Roger Corman.

 Al Pacino refines his performance as ""Michael Corleone"". Diane Keaton practically steals every scene as ""Kay"". Even Talia Shire gives her best.

 I noticed the background sound effects are well placed in this movie. Even a distant sound of a car-horn gives a scene, inside a room, more authenticity.

 If you have seen The Godfather (1972), the second movie, The Godfather, Part II (1974) must be seen.

 Also see, The Sicilian (1987)

 7 Academy Award Nominations. Won for Best Picture. Best Actor in a Supporting Role: Robert DeNiro. Art Direction-Set Direction. Best Director: Frances Ford Coppola. Best Music, Original Score.

 Author, Mario Puzo died July 2, 1999.
 Francis Ford Coppola had said in 2001, their would not be a Godfather 4.

 In real life: Gaetano Riina, brother of Salvatore ""Toto' Riina, the accused head of the mafia in Corleone in Sicily, Italy, was arrested July 1, 2011 with charges of Extortion and Criminal Association. His two grandsons and an associate are also charged the same.
  The local mafia clan was known as ""Corleonesi"" and led the mafia in the 1980's and 1990's. In 1993, Gaetano took over for his detained brother, Salvatore. Salvatore Riina is serving numerous life sentences after being convicted of ordering a spate of killings in Carleone.

 *** Update: February 21, 2012. Anthony Puzo, the son and heir of creator & author, Mario Puzo, of the original ""The Godfather"" novels, has a new novel, ""The Family Corleone"" being published in May or July 2012.
 Paramount Pictures is suing him claiming they have ""sole and exclusive right: to make and cause to be made literary and dramatic and other versions and adaptations of every kind and character.""

 Sounds like to me Paramount Pictures is shooting themselves in the foot.

 I say: Allow the heir, Anthony Puzo, to allow the novel ""The Family Corleone"" to be published and to become a motion picture for any studio that offers to make it, if that is what Anthony Puzo and Ed Falco want with the right to write more novels.  It worked for J.K. Rowling.

The picture on the restored films is warm and vibrant. I didn't do a side-by-side comparison with the DVDs from the 2001 set, but that's not really necessary. Even the dark scenes have a clarity and definition that I don't remember in earlier versions.

It's also nice to have the films on single DVDs. I understand technical restrictions, quality control and the need to occasionally split feature films across multiple discs, but it's nice to be able to put the DVD in and watch it, period.

The sound is excellent, but I don't have an audiophile setup. Sounds great on my system, so that's all that matters to me.

I just received this and have watched the two restored films but have not yet seen the new documentaries. It was a wise marketing decision to carry over all of the ""bonus"" content from the 2001 set in addition to the three new documentaries.

And Godfather III? Well, it's still Godfather III, isn't it? Often referred to as ""misunderstood,"" that may be true. I've always enjoyed Joe Mantegna's performance, and the saga does benefit from ""closure,"" but...well, it is what it is. The real draw here is the new versions of the first two films, which are two of the greatest films in the history of cinema...as ""essential"" as essential gets.

My only caveat is to do what I did...keep an eye on the price and when the iron's hot, strike.",1322784000,6,2150,5.745283018867925

2783230,1,B000NTPDSW,"Two times in the last three months, I have tried to buy The Godfather Collection on Blu-ray from Amazon.  Both times, I have received the UK version instead of the US.  You can tell the difference because the UK version is an actual box set with 4 Blu-ray cases in it and a little ""15"" UK movie rating stamped on the front, whereas the US version is in a single thick Blu-ray case with all the discs in it.  The two items have different ASIC numbers, however, the UK versions that I've received both times have had a sticker placed on them with the US ASIC number.  The UK version is playable on US players, however, it does not include the original monaural audio tracks that the movies were released with theatrically and does not have the collectible booklet of the US release.  Both times that this happened, Amazon temporarily yanked it from their site until they resolved the stock problem, though it was never actually resolved.

I was allowed to return the item both times, however, Amazon has explained to me that since they get this item from wholesalers, they can't guarantee that they are receiving the correct item.  While they were more than nice about it and ended up giving me a credit for my trouble, that still doesn't get me a copy of the US version of The Godfather Collection on Blu-ray for my collection.

2783234,5,B000NTPDSW,"The opening title and scene of ""The Godfather"" is one of the most striking in cinematic history. The lone trumpet invoking the tragic melody which has become so synonymous with this film is the equivalent of the tenor voice from an Italian opera, lamenting the loss of a loved-one in song, similar in style to a theme by Puccini or Verdi. Strangely, this sort of aria would have occurred towards the end of a traditional opera, usually at the death of the leading lady. But here the grieving music begins the story, as if tragic moments have already occurred, although they will continue to occur, a fundamental part of the story which is to follow. The beginning of the film is in actuality the middle of the larger epic of the Corleone family in America.

The first spoken words are neither from the Godfather himself nor from one of those in his inner circle. The voice is an outsider. He is not only an outsider of the inner Corleone family but someone not originally from America. The first voice we hear is an Italian immigrant, ""I believe in America."" This is a story about American immigrants, and how they have attained great financial and political power in the United States which might not be possible elsewhere in the world.

Based on the original book by Mario Puzo (who also co-wrote the screenplay), ""the Godfather"" lives up to its name as both a title referring to a specific character and simultaneously a position of someone wielding great power within a particular social context. When the film begins with Signore Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto who will be ever-remembered as the first voice and face of ""the Godfather""), the Italian immigrant requesting a favor from the Don on his daughter's wedding day, we assume the Godfather is Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), which is correct by and large. But as the film progresses, we see the rise of his younger son Michael Corleone who at first disassociates himself from the crime activities of his family. But even he cannot help but be dragged into the dealings of his family. By film's end it is ambiguous to which the titles refers, an individual person or a high-power position, not unlike a nobleman from the time of the Italian Renaissance.

Strangely, traditions are portrayed in this film which have their roots centuries before the incarnation of the United States. All the main characters, with the possible exception of Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), are Catholic-Italian. The church, presumably on the outskirts of New York City, is in an architectural style similar to the medieval Gothic cathedrals of France and Italy. At the wedding at the beginning of the film, Italian songs are sung with traditional instruments. Only when a Frank Sinatra-like character, Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), appears at the wedding, do we remember we're in America in the 1940's and not a little town in Italy in the 19th century.

""The Godfather"" chronicles several intertwined stories which was certainly highly innovative when it was produced. The very beginning of a plot concerns Sollozzo ""the Turk"" (Al Lettieri) who is a high-stakes heroin peddler who wants to use the Mafia families to sell his goods. He has already convinced the other Mafia families that drugs are the future but needs the Corleone family because of their political and law-enforcement connections. Don Corleone declines his offers at a meeting. But Satino ""Sonny"" Corleone (James Caan) makes a fatal slip, letting Sollozzo know there is slight ambivalence in the family about getting into the narcotics racket. Don Corleone becomes a target, and Sollozzo hopes by getting him out of the way, the Corleone family will reconsider their position on the illegal drug markets. Eventually this leads to an inter-Mafia war among the five New York families.

The other story concerns Michael Corleone, his relationship with Kay Adams, presumably a WASP, and his initially tenuous relationship with his own family. Although Marlon Brando was top-billed for the film and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone has much more screen time. The film is really Michael's story, about his gradual involvement in the family business. Several of the most memorable scenes involve Michael Corleone rather than Don Corleone, not the least of which occur in the home country of Sicily when Michael is in exile.

Maybe a dozen films in existence could be characterized as perfect, nearly flawless, from beginning-to-end: Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Gandhi, Schindler's List, and Malcolm X, are a few which come to mind. ""The Godfather"" not only deserves a spot, it may be at the top of the heap. Every scene, even every line, furthers story, character, and even the world of the Corleones. Each of the other actors aside from Brando and Pacino could have won an Academy Award for their efforts, including James Caan, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall. In fact, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor, maybe the only time in film history three nominees from the same film were in the same category. ""The Godfather"" is one of the bona fide epic masterpieces of cinematic history, an opera without the singing.",1312588800,,5218,4.971363115693013
2783235,4,B000NTPDSW,"The movie itself deserves 5 stars because it is unquestionably the best movie ever made!

I will buy another set, and hopefully it won't have this problem.  While watching I was reminded of Singing in the Rain, when the leads on screen began talking out of sinc and eventually swapping lines, 'yes, yes, yes.'  'No, no, no.'

2783241,5,B000NTPDSW,"If I've seen this movie once, I've seen it a million times! I used to have the set on VHS but never went out and got the set on DVD again for some reason... even though I no longer have a VHS player.

First of all, I bought this item because I just love the trilogy and had to have it... couldn't always wait till they showed it on TV! Plus they always show it at some bizarre time during a week day! (Not really worth getting the talking to from the boss because you showed up to work as a sleep deprived mindless zombie over a movie!)

Secondly, after reading some of the reviews and their comments on how these movies were restored and how the picture and sound are pin sharp and such, I thought that it would be as if I was seeing it for the very first time... I guess my expectations were very high at first! But To be honest they were right... once you actually ignore the movie and focus on the image... you do notice it.. you don't see any of those fuzzy objects, blotches, and dust that shows on film or VHS tape... it is clear in that sense. In terms of the sound, it is a lot more audible especially when the characters speak in low voices, in the past you had rewind and crank the volume up to hear the dialogue... not the case with this restored version.

Thirdly, I always prefer buying movies in complete sets, even though I think that Godfather III was not up to par with the other two! Hey, it doesn't hurt to have it in there, especially at the Amazon price!

Fourthly, the price definitely makes it an obvious choice! Three classic movies for an amazing price in one pack!

2783259,4,B000NTPDSW,"The restoration seems even darker; not in tone but in cinematography.  With the interiors you feel like you are inside a large black, velvety fedora.  Was the director trying to make a black and white movie, but knowing he was forced to use color?  Though the sequel (II) is probably the better movie, it misses the presence of Brando.  After one has watched The Godfather twenty times one starts asking what if, but never to analyze it to search for deeper meanings or underlining gems of subtlety that suddenly showcase in your mind some lofty idea in the story that caused the director to shoot the movie in a certain light.  Orson Welles wanted the role as the Godfather.  It would have worked, but  with likely completely different results.  He would have been swarthier, more sedentary, looking more like a capo than a businessman.  In any case The Godfather is one of those movies you can watch again and again.  It is thoroughly entertaining.  If they made it today, Jim Carrey would play Sonny, George Bush would play Fredo, Johnny Depp would be Clemenza, Leonardo DeCaprio would be Michael, Robert Duval would keep his role and of course the Godfather would be played by Angela Joli...or maybe not.",1293494400,,1208,4.759615384615385

So, what you get, is a BEAUTIFUL outer box that is very nice, with four slim cases inside, which 3 of them are of course the 3 movies, and the fourth disc, wow, I haven't even gotten to that yet, you Godfather fanatics will be pleased with this, the fourth disc is 'Supplements' which is only available in the box set, not the individual releases which are available as well, but this set is the way to go, with the supplements, you get 2 discs, that have as follows, disc 1 has 'The Making of The Godfather' 'Addition Scenes' 'Filming Locations' 'The Corleone Family Tree' 'The Music of The Godfather' 'The Godfather Historical Timeline' 'Profiles on the Filmmakers' and photo galleries and storyboards, that is just the first disc, the 2nd disc is as follows 'Godfather World' 'The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't' 'When The Shooting Stopped' 'Emulsional Rescue Revealing The Godfather' 'The Godfather On The Red Carpet' and 'Four Short Films on The Godfather' these 2 discs clock in at 291 minutes, so yeah, you get TONS of extras, and even the extras are in widescreen.

So if you have the previous set like I did, and are looking to upgrade, look no further than here, there was a lot of hype running around this set around the time it was going to get released, and this set really lives up to the hype, not only have the films been beautifully restored and cared for, but you get the extras you've always wanted, now you can buy the individual movies, but you won't get the supplements discs, but why buy the individual releases when it would only cost about $5.00 maybe $10.00 to get this set, but decide for yourself!",1292976000,,2747,4.405511811023622
2783262,5,B000NTPDSW,"These films are absolutely fabulous.  If you are reading this then I am sure you already know this, so I am not going to spend any time on going into that.  What I would like to comment on is the artistic process that went into this film and some people's dislike of it on here.

Reading through the comments here I noticed that many of the three star reviews and less complain about it being too grainy and that they ""upscaled"" it to 1080p and that even 2001 looks better on Blu-Ray.  Worst of all are the people that complain about the yellowish/orangish hue in the first movie and that they are dark.  These people really don't know anything about the technology and as a result their comments are meaningless.  First of all; the films were shot dark on purpose.  That was an artistic choice, and I think it helps make it feel more like America in the 1940s.  Then there are those that say that video was upscaled because it's a 70's film and that 2001 looks better.  This is laughable.  How can these people call themselves fans of film, but yet know nothing about the technology. All three of the Godfather movies are shot on 35mm film.  Modern movies that aren't shot digitally are usually shot on 35mm film. (it's the standard) 2001 was shot on 70mm film hence.  This allows for a higher resolution when transferring to digital.  The reason the first film looks so grainy is because they made so many copies from the original negatives, that they were destroyed. They had to do a world wide search to find the very best negatives to make a new master with.  All of which were copies from the original. That's why some parts look better than others.  It's what they had to work with.  The yellowish/orangish hue was done on purpose in post production as an artistic choice.

I am sure even with all this said people will still complain and would prefer that they have a a very sterile, grainless, perfect color balance digital feel that digital cameras can give.  I for one prefer film for the master.  It looks far better in my opinion and gives films their own unique feel.  This is something I feel with be lost when everything eventually goes digital and the digital post production will look faked.

To sum everything up; If you are a film fan, these are a must have in your collection.  The restoration in every detail is as good as it's going to get with what was available.  Even the soundtrack is as equally amazing in restoration as the video is.  Enjoy it in all it's greatness.",1287792000,23,2495,4.481152993348116
2783263,5,B000NTPDSW,"I have to admit, having read some reviews here and elsewhere, I half expected the Coppola Restoration to be an ugly mess.  However, I decided to try it because the extras were so enticing.  I'm glad I did.  The results are great.  The complaints about dirt and color that I have seen are exaggerated and inaccurate.  Some people just have no idea how to adjust a tv.  Yes, there are a couple of spots in the first film that show a speck of dust or two, one big bit of debris in the middle for a moment, along with a few headlights and a lamp that look a tiny bit too bright - not a big tally considering this movie was released in 1972, and hasn't been seen in it's true glory since then.  I also saw some complaints about the picture and sound for Part 3.  Don't believe them.  It should be noted that Part Three is not really part of the ""restoration"" however.  It is simply included for completeness.  So, if you saw the previous dvd of Part 3, it will look the same here.

The extras are very good - better than most dvd junk extras.  A little self-congratulatory, but I figure the Godfather has earned the right to pat itself on the back.  The extra scenes are great if you've never seen them before.  They are far from essential, but satisfying for the completist.  Especially (SPOILER ALERT) a scene that ties up Apollonia's murder, Tom's return from his abduction which shows that he is, indeed, loved as a brother, and a bit more on the Consiglieri that Tom is supposed to replace.

Bottom line is, if you don't care about extras, and you own an older version that you like, this set is unnecessary.  But if you have interest in the extras, or always felt the older release looked dull and faded, this is the thing that will scratch your itch.",1287360000,4,1752,4.338461538461538

My review is just to say that the Blu-Ray restoration played very well and was significantly clearer than the original DVD presentation (which I own). It plays very nicely on a 52"" HDTV and even better on smaller HDTV screens. If you love these three films you can buy this restoration version with no reservations about the picture quality.

The box set contains numerous interesting specials on the making of the Godfather series as well as footage which had to be removed to reduce the playing time. All this footage is now available with this collection with a description of why each scene was shot, why it was removed and what its place was in the story line. This footage is not in high definition but still very interesting. Many other interesting special features included.",1281657600,,849,4.7687074829931975

So I decided, well since I got the blu-ray, let me get the blu-ray version of one of my all time favorite trilogies! Heck it is the The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration set, so the picture has to be UNREAL. Popped it in and the title menu was pretty grainey. So that was disappointing but I figure, just the title, no big deal. So I site back, get ready to experience my godfather flick in Blu-Ray, hit play and......WOW! STILL GRAINEY!! So really I was not sure why I just got rid of the DVD version to get the Blu-ray version!? But it is still the Godfather, I love the flick and can never get enough.

2783276,5,B000NTPDSW,"I have seen 'The Godfather' films so many times I've lost count. I also own the 6 VHS director's cut which puts the three films together in chronological order and adds well over an hour of great footage(the best version by far!). I was contemplating buying the new restored Blu Ray edition and I'm very glad I decided to go ahead and buy it.

Like a lot of other reviewers have stated the films look better than they ever did, but naturally they do not look like state of the art films made in 2010. The Blu Ray version is a noticeable improvement and the films look bright and as clear as they will ever look. Coppola wanted a certain grainy look and to remove it completely would be like scrubbing the grit out of The Rolling Stones classic album 'Exile On Main Street'! Of course I'm talking mainly about the first film as part II looks better although many scenes are still dark, they are as bright as they will ever be. Part III looks exceptional and helps the overall experience of the film since it is by far the least of the three. The extras disc is full of hours of good stuff for hard core fans to navagate through including the extras from the 2001 DVD release which was a nice addition.

The first film is the greatest mob film ever made with the second film rating a very close tie with 'Goodfellas' for second place. Part II has a much more ambitious story and probably deserves top seed, but the character's of Don Vito(Marlon Brando), Tessio(Abe Virgoda), Clemenza(Bruno Kirby) and Sonny(James Caan)are sorely missed in part 2. That's not to say that the second film doesn't have great characters, I just prefer the original characters to part II.

What is incredible is the casting of Don Vito(Robert DeNiro), Clemenza(Bruno Kirby) and Tessio(John Aprea) in part II, it's very believable that these young guys are those older guys in the first film. I also think that the very underrated John Cazale gives a fantastic performance in part II as Fredo. As good as Pacino is in these films, he is not very likable and I find the other characters more appealing and interesting. I could have watched an entire film just following the young Don, Clemenza and Tessio for part II.

I know the third film has been bashed to bits, but how could part III have not been a disappointment? With what it had to live up to, it's surprising it was ever made. I have grown to like it more over the years. If only Duvall and Coppola could have come to a money agreement, I think the film would have been much better. For one it would have added another brilliant actor in the film and maybe that would have forced Coppola to edit out some of the religious overload.

If you have a Blu Ray player this is a must have as these films will probably never look better. My only gripe is they should have made this a deluxe box set with the director's cut of all three films included too, it has never seen a DVD release. I guess, I won't be retiring my VCR just yet. It's an amazing piece of work with a lot of stuff that was cut out of the original films. I'm not talking throw away stuff either, it's as close to watching a book as you'll ever get. Hopefully they will release it someday soon!",1275782400,2,3190,4.4

The special freatures are great overall with several fascinating extras and documentaries that deliver some known and unknown info about all different ascepts  of these fine 3 films including all of the old features from the 2001 collection nad some great new features such as Godfather world and the masterpiece that almost wasn't and a feature at how the restoration process was done . All in all a very fine high-quality set with fabulous  bonus features and supplements and obviously the 3 films themselves presented brilliantly. In addition the quality, picture and sound are great as far as i can tell the menus look nice and the casing is attractive-looking.  The packet however is attached to the back instead of in the case so theres an obvious package mishap but still it offers some fascianting info even if we've heard some of it before.  overall  an excellent giftset for gf fans and dispite the grain the set is awesome with several likeable qualites to it and i'd say theres a lot to like here so if you think this is a fine-looking product i don't feel you'd be making a bad purchase with this it's definitely an offer you don't wanna refuse i had a lot of fun with it overall and definitely would recommend it to fans of the blu-ray the godfather series and cool collector sets that are a great addition to movie colletions and are filled with very many great features and qualities.",1275264000,,1812,4.611801242236025

Too often we are shown the personal lives and feelings and families of the men who commit atrocities, and we recognize qualities which are sympathetic, even sadmirable.  Make no mistake, however.

2783300,4,B000NTPDSW,"Their was a problem, and its gone, and their was nothing they could do about it, and that's that. What ya gonna' do?  We had nothing to do with it, It was between the directors.

Forgive my mixing of mob movie metaphors.
Their has been a lot of talk about the results of this restoration.  I think it can be split into two categories.  Image quality, and Image color.  The extras disc claims the movie was a victim of its own success, in that many more film prints for theaters were made from the original master than were expected.  This caused deterioration in the original master, and forty years later some of the frames in the original master are just gone and beyond repair. Can any of us say we haven't experienced some physical deterioration since 1970?  So they had to fill in the holes as best they could. This process is explained in detail on the extras disc.  In a nutshell, you can't fill in something with nothing, and the filler had to be consistent with the entire film or visa versa.  This is why it has been digitized, normalized, and has a bit of a video game look.  Given current technology, this is about as good as anyone could do.
Now about the Coloring, and blown out whites. This was a personal choice of the editors and director of photography who worked as a team during the restoration process.  According to the extras disc, Coppola signed off on the final copy but wasn't directly involved in the day to day restoration process.  The team claimed this is as close as possible as to what was seen at the theater when the film opened. The key words here are AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE.
So, in a nutshell, the Coppola restoration is that in name only, but still is as good as any team could do given what they had to work with.  Pixel peepers won't be happy with it, but seldom are anyway, and since Mr. Peabody and his Wayback Machine hasn't been able to retrieve the unharmed original master from 1970, this is about as good as it gets.  If your looking for the resolution, and sharpness of Avitar, then you will be disappointed because it was never there in the first place.  It's a great film, so sit back and relax and Forget about it.",1261785600,2,2162,4.396984924623116

2783304,5,B000NTPDSW,"I consider The Godfather to be the greatest film of all time, and I saw it in the theater the first week it was released.  At the time we were all struck by the beautiful cinematography -- the sun-drenched scenes in Sicily, the fall colors of New England.  When The Godfather came out on DVD I was subtly disappointed because the quality of the reproduction simply was not up to par.  Not terrible, mind you, but not up to the standard of the theatrical release.

This restoration goes a long way towards restoring the magic of the original release.  I cannot say for sure that it gets us all the way there, but it is a striking improvement. The colors are warm and vibrant, and there are few dust specs or flaws of that type. I am imagining that this is about the best that we can do, given that the film was originally released in the early 1970s.

I was sorry to see that a few scenes from the original theatrical release are not included here, in common with the earlier DVD releases.  Nothing major, but a few scenes from Tom Hagan's confrontation with Jack Woltz, scenes of Michael with Kay Adams, and perhaps a few others, are simply gone.  I was hoping that they would be here.  I have seen them a few times on television, but never on DVD.  Too bad.

The Godfather part I comprises maybe 3 or 4 of the most boring movies ever. It's about 10 or 15 hours of stupid, inane BS that nobody could possibly care about. I tried to watch it all the way through, but fell asleep after about 6 hours.

The Godfather part II is even longer, somewhere between 15 and 20 hours, which according to Godfather fans makes it better than the first.

The Godfather part III is so boring and awful that even fans of the first two movies can't stand it.

2783309,1,B000NTPDSW,"I don't like these Godfather movies, by gosh, bygolly.  Too much violence, not enough sex.

For example, we're told that Fredo Corlieone was ""banging cocktail waitresses two at a time,"" but correct me if I'm wrong, we never actually see him banging any of these waitresses.

Sure, during the wedding scene Fredo's brother, Sonny Corlieone, has wall-sex with one of the wedding guests.  But James Caan isn't even Italian!  So what's the dang-deal, man?

And poor Michael Corlieone.  He gets to be Godfather.  The King.  The Big Enchilada.  And who does he get to bang? ... Diane Keaton. ... He might as well work for the post office, man!

Then there's Don Corlieone (no relationship to ""Soul Train's"" Don Cor-nel-ius!).  The Don gets to bang Morgana King; but lemme tell ya, that's like drivin' over ten miles of bad road in a Yugo.

Troy Donahue got to bang Connie Corlieone, but since Talia Shire is far-sighted, rumor has it, she thought it was *Phil* Donahue -- which right there would make anyone's stomach turn.

Of course, other than Sonny's brief stand-up routine, we never got to see any decent banging; let alone two or three at a time.  The closest we came to checking out Fredo's action is when he asked Kay Corlieone to stand on a mirror while he drooled pathetically all over his nice Ivy League suit.  AND YOU CALL THAT FILMMAKING!  I've seen better banging at a high school drum & bugle contest.

Now take Tony Soprano.  Now there's a mafia don who sure'nuf can ""bang 'em two at a time.""  Three if necessary.

He banged more service-oriented members of the lumpen proleteriat in one teevee episode than the entire Corlieone patriarchy did in three goll-darn movies.

And Tom, Tom Hagen.  Why, you miserable sexless wretch.  Where's the beef, counselor?  Where's the strudel?  Where's the Ba-Da-Bing girls you're supposed to being bailing out on a regular basis? ... Sir, you disgust me!

In short, whatever happened to ""sex and violence""?  Don't they go together like a horse and carriage?  Like Frick and Frack.  Like Laurel and Hardy and Missus Laurel and Missus Hardy.

Like Dolly Parton.

Can you believe it -- a movie about Italians, and the only guy who gets laid is a James Caan, a bar mitzvah boy.

There are people who did not like it, and this for two reasons: 1) It does not look better than the DVD. This is simply not true. I have played both Coppola restorations in the same player and TV, and the difference between the upgraded DVD and the Blu-Ray is huge. The quality of the image in Blu-Ray is just mind-blowing (at least in this US edition). 2) It is grainy. This one is true, and yet, I have seen more grain in very recent movies. And, after all, it is the original grain of the celluloid, not some DNR artifact, so it is actually cinematographically great to see it; it is the way the director and photographer intended it to look. If you want pristine grainless clarity, forget about this one (and yet, it is not that grainy...I was surprised to see so little of it after having read some grain-haters reviews), but if you want to watch it as good as, or proably better, than in cinemas, this is it.",1250121600,8,1063,4.32

So of course I owned them on VHS... then I bought them again on DVD... and Now I'm the proud owner of the entire trilogy (plus a bunch of extras and an over sized booklet) on Blu-Ray.

Was it worth the money to buy this set again?  I guess it depends on who you are and what you like.  First of all, I generally prefer theatrical versions to any other versions of films - there are a few exceptions of course, but on the whole I prefer the theatrical release - which is what these BDVDs are.  Many people will not be huge fans of the graininess of the film or the orange hue of the film.  Expecially if you are used to watching the extremely sharp and crisp newer movies released on Blu-ray.  But there is something about that grainy texture and warm lighting that makes this film seem all the more immediate, they welcome the viewer in and you quickly forget yourself in the rise and fall of Michael.

So yes to me the investment was well worth the purchase, we have watched these movies hundreds of times and it feels like every time I catch yet another subtle nuance, gesture or deeper meaning.

Others will find this to be a waste of their hard earned money - they just want to see the movie.  Some people are content to just watch it when it comes on A&E - but to the true fans, the upgrade to Blu-ray is a must.",1247443200,9,1412,4.177121771217712
2783319,5,B000NTPDSW,"There are so many reviews on these 3 films that I will just comment on the quality of the restoration. This has to be one of the top 5, if not the best, jobs done on film restoration to date. Paramount used one of the best restoration labs in the world, owned by Warner Brothers, to restore this film only after a Kodak owned lab cleared it as being sturdy enough to run through the digitizing equipment. The whole restoration was spurred by a letter to Spielberg from Coppola asking him if he could get Paramount, who had recently been bought by Viacom if they would do a restoration on the Godfather films. The head of Paramount didn't even hesitate to cut the large check to fund the restoration. The result? Coppola says its more beautiful then he remembered it. The extent of the restoration is included on the Bonus disc. And in that the clip you will see that the filmographer instead of filming the scenes correctly exposed and then having the lab darken the frames went with shooting the scenes dark, the result being there is no detail in the black areas of the film. This explains how difficult it was to get this quality of a restoration, which meant finding the best copy available, which still left much to be desired, and going frame my frame and digitally correcting the image. What is impressive is that the WB Studio lab consulted the original filmographer. I don't know if there is an Academy Award for restoration, but if there is, I know this team deserves it.

NOTE: There seems to be some here that don't like the way the film looks. I suggest they watch Emulsional Rescue - Revealing the Godfather on the bonus disc. Anyone that buys the set, may want to watch it first too to see how the films were shot, underexposed and with an orange tint, and the care taken to restore that look and even in 1 scene improve on it. Watching this feature first will show that its the way it was shot and meant to look, not the restoration.",1246060800,22,1949,4.444134078212291
2783320,4,B000NTPDSW,"I've reviewed the three GODFATHER films in depth elsewhere on Amazon.com, so I am going to limit this review to the merely technical aspects of ""The Coppolla Restoration.""

First of all, it's important to watch the two ""Extras"" discs first, as they provide a lot of information about the restoration process, particularly the short named ""Emulsional Rescue.""

THE GODFATHER's original master negative was created on particularly ""thin"" photo stock, meaning that fewer top quality prints could be created from it. Ironically, THE GODFATHER ended up having a vast number of prints made from this thin stock. The quality of these prints deteriorated fast---much faster than with an average movie made on standard stock.

The master negative was in such poor shape when the restoration team began working that they inadvertently destroyed about thirty feet of it trying to save it. This meant that the restoration team had to find the best quality prints from all around the world and laboriously splice them together, often individual frame by frame, to reconstruct what they called their ""hero"" negative from which the restoration was made.

As a result, the restoration is not as good as a pristine master negative would be, even a ""restored"" one. This is as good as it will ever be, barring some new as-yet unimagined process.

Many reviewers have commented on the ""poor"" color quality of the restoration. I was fascinated (and a little befuddled) to discover that the ""tangerine hell"" one reviewer described in certain color scenes was intentional on the part of the cinematographer, as was the darkness of much of the film---there are scenes in which the blackness is so utterly black that it swallows the set.

No, we're not losing our eyesight.

I missed the point, too, until I thought it through. It makes a certain ""artsy-fartsy"" sense when the viewer recognizes that The Godfather lives in hell. Evil is pure darkness, and joy (such as Connie's wedding) is lit by fiery reds and golds---literally a ""tangerine hell.""

For a more intense example, look at the Sollozzo murder scene: Just before the shootings Michael is dark, while the out-of-focus red neon light on the Louis' Family Restaurant sign burns brightly over his right shoulder. That this is not bad filmmaking can be seen in the fact that less crucial scenes (such as the Don's funeral scene) have no such color distortion. It's subtle, and it is artsy, but mute the color extremes and THE GODFATHER would probably lose much of its visual impact.

On a more normative note, the restoration brings out a hundred little details: A sign announcing Jake LaMotta's defense of his title pops out of nowhere, presaging&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raging-Bull/dp/B00062IVKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raging Bull</a>; the appearance of oranges (always a harbinger of death in THE GODFATHER films) is more obvious; the dissolution evident on the face of the Black Hand extortionist Fanucci is highlighted; the sepia-tint quality of the early Twentieth Century DeNiro scenes in GODFATHER PART TWO is emphasized; and the intricacy of the sets is evident everywhere.

Fortunately, THE COPPOLLA RESTORATION is just that, a restoration, and Francis Ford Coppolla does not do what he has done before, re-edit, add, subtract, and meld these movies together. This is a purely ""technical"" restoration of the films (or at least&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather/dp/B0001NBNB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather-Part-II/dp/B001ISHBRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather Part II</a>; the less-worthy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godfather-Part-III/dp/B000USU98K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godfather Part III</a>&nbsp;gets no such treatment).

2783326,3,B000NTPDSW,"I am with mixed feelings about this set, but right now I'm leaning towards an all-out PAN of this Blu-Ray release of these movies. I've been noticing that a lot of the reviews say ""THIS IS A FAITHFUL RESTORATION OF THE ORIGINALS!!!!"". Well that wasn't what I got in this set.

I wanna know what the 4 and 5 star reviewers were smoking when watching this set. Now yeah it's true that this set contains less grain than the 2001 DVD release. But I want to know what Coppola was doing in the year it took him to restore the films.

As soon as I opened the set, I put in the disc for the first one and watched it. The wedding scene at the beginning is where I noticed how over-saturated the picture is. The whites look more blue than white. THe rest of the film wasn't more different. At times there was a noticeable and annoying red tint over some certain scenes that made the picture look bad.

Part 2 was not much different either. The opening scene with the kissing of the hand had an annoying orange tint over it. Upon seeing this, I asked myself ""Who restored this? Heidi Montag???"". There was notable print damage in some scenes too.

One reviewer stated that there were some parts that looked like they had adjusted the F-Stop, and it was distracting. I couldn't agree more. That happened a LOT throughout Part 3, especially the ending. Sad thing is, the worst in the series (Part 3) looked the best. I can't say the same for Part 1 and 2 though.

The extras were fine, no complaints. People are bitching about the TV versions not being on here- I beg to differ. I don't care a single bit about the TV versions. The audio is not bad, bough you have to have the right sound system for it.

In short, just keep the original set. If you need so desperately to buy this set, buy it for the extras only.",1242864000,5,1801,4.2823529411764705
2783327,4,B000NTPDSW,"Movies: GF1 is a very solid movie, exceptional in every way. It stays very close to the book. The final moments of the film are breathtaking. 10/10. I liked GF2 better than a first film. I found the story to be more interesting. The whole corruption plot in both family ties and in business world really engaged me in the story. The final moments of the film hold the same power as it's precedor's climax but the flashback endings wasn't very well edited in my opinion. 10/10. GF3 has a very big potential. Unfortunately I did not agree with F.Coppola's decision regarding the whole concept of the film. He was focusing too much on a family values, which did not really satisfy me or most of the other viewers. IMO PartIII should've been a strong finish based more on business. However, the ending of the film is very very very powerful and dramatic, the best in the Trilogy. 9/10

 Video Quality: Overall transfer is nice. Grain is still in effect, but the picture definitely looks sharp (In most cases) and HD quality is visible. Unfortunately not all scenes been fully transfered, take for example the scene from GF3 when Mary takes a pictures at train station - poor quality. 8/10

2783330,5,B000NTPDSW,"The first Godfather was released the year I was born (1972), but I didn't first see it until the mid-80's. Same goes for Part II ('74).

Despite the criticisms when it first came out, I first appreciated the grandioseness of this trilogy when I saw Part III in '91 and I thought it was an amazing and dramatic piece of work (especially the great score and dramatic opera scenes towards the end), which then led me to want to see parts I and II. My parents gave me a great education on them when we watched them together and I realized why these are must-have films for any movie collector.
My parents are retired commercial artists and they and many of their colleagues in the art field all consider the series not just ""movies"", but true works of art (particularly parts 1 and 2) and so do I!

A year or two back I bought the DVD trilogy and was particularly impressed with the audio/video quality of the first 2 (part 3 was and is still relatively modern and already looked pretty good and sounded pretty darn great in VHS Hi-Fi.) But of course, the DVD was worlds ahead of the VHS (not just image-wise, but Parts I & II also went from flat mono sound to crisp-sounding 5.1, which really brought them to life) and were surely the best it could look and sound... until I watched my Blu ray last night!

Now, in terms of video/audio quality, what others say here is true. First, it's not a ""reference"" Blu ray disc e.g., ""Iron Man"" or ""Transformers"". They restored the film as best they could without ""tampering"" with it. There is a good amount of film grain and a honeyish color tinge throughout that gave the film the ""sepia"" look of films from the 30s and 40s. Some will be turned off by that, but that is how Mr. Coppola intended to be.
But having said that, as my headline states, seeing Part I on Blu ray truly was like seeing it for the first time!

First, considering that there are so many dark scenes in the movie (purposely filmed that way and always harder for home video to reproduce) there is still an impressive amount of detail instead of the typical ""mush"" you saw in other formats. The outdoor scenes (except for the first outdoor scene at the beginning which I thought looked a tad too over-bright at times) were incredibly crisp, detailed and amazing to look at. (Especially the scenes in Italy where Michael tries to `hide' and gets married... the detail in the scenery and the colors were so amazing, I went back and watched it again!). The Dolby True-HD sound-quality is also stellar. I have a somewhat modest 5.1 home theater in a box and it sounded A-LOT newer than a 1972 film. I was impressed both by the ""crispiness"" of the treble and the fullness of the bass as well as the directionality of the sound effects. I think it definitely sounded better than the DVD version. (Imagine if I had a 7.1 HDMI receiver!). As for the special features, all the ones you loved from the DVD are in the Blu ray set, with many in HD!

All in all, this is simply a no-brainer Blu ray purchase. These films could not possibly look or sound any better even if you bought a film projector and a screen! To top it all off, Amazon's unbelievable price of $52.99 for this Blu ray set is LESS than the $60 I paid for the regular DVD set!!! Buy this set right here, right now on Amazon! Other retailers are selling this same set for $85 to over $100...Thanks so much, Amazon, for making so many great Blu ray discs like these very affordable for the rest of us!",1241481600,4,3464,4.381026438569207

The special features (most of which I had not seen before) were both fun to watch and instructional.

All the effort the Mr. Coppola and his team put into this restoration project is rewarded in the final result.  The price I paid was quite a bargain considering what I got.

2783335,5,B000NTPDSW,"I just purchased and finished watching all 5 discs of ""the godfather"" restoration gift set. After reading through a lot of the reviews posted I hope that I may clear up a lot of the confusion and critical comments that may be discouraging anyone from buying this classic and timeless film of iconic characters. The 2 special features disc were very interesting, enlightening and enjoyable! I own the ""the godfather"" on VHS I bought a decade ago and I was under the impression that the special features from my VHS would simply be transferred to the DVD. I was completely surprised to discover everything on both discs are all never seen before features! I felt like for once a DVD that advertised never seen before special features which actually lived up to the promotion.

Ok I've been hearing some viewers complaining about the color in the film. They added a bit of a tangerine color to give the movie a more warmer and updated feel which looks good in my opinion. Some people are giving the implication that the added coloring is consistent throughout the movie and its only in the scenes where its really dark or there's lighting with a shade that gives off that particular color. If you look in the area where the light shines you'll see the tangerine color and if you look at the window the coloring is very natural as daylight would look in any window. Reviewers must remember this is a movie that was filmed in 1972 and resurrecting it I'm almost certain was a difficult and delicate process, so if this is your favorite film give the studio credit for a good job in refining a film shot with old technology 35 years ago. So for the complaints about the color, I can only say to those critics to try adjusting the color settings on your TV.

Complaints about noise, I did not hear any loud subway or train like noises that overwhellmed the dialogue, except the one scene where Micheal was mentally preparing himself to kill Solotso and that was done purposely. So again to those complainting about noise try adjusting the sound settings on your TV or maybe you got a defective copy.

I read a couple reviews about something being on the camera midway in ""the godfather II"". I found nothing at all that was on the camera and not a part of the film, again maybe you have a defective copy. I honestly have no criticism for this gift set and in my humble opinion this film still looks like the masterpiece that it is and I strongly recommend it to anyone pondering purchasing it!!! Also to all the other complaints I've read about the special features I think its nonsense and your expectations are far too high. I hope that my genuine and honest feelings about this gift set will serve anyone who reads this review. Purchase it and enjoy it as I have and will continue to.",1240444800,12,2779,4.542914171656687

I made a side-by-side comparison on a 90"" home theatre projection screen, and the improvements on this blu-ray are substantial enough for one's viewing pleasure to be enhanced manifold. The images are sharper, but not so sharp until they lose their film-like quality. Colours are much more solid and vibrant. I know there have been many complaints about too much grain, but for a movie like the Godfather, grain is essential for the Rembrandt-like quality of the interior scenes, and the sepia glow of the exteriors. Over-zealous processing would have ruined its moody atmospherics. There is a point beyond which a restoration job robs a classic movie of its classic aura.

 In the original Godfather, performances still impress, especially Marlon Brando. Robert DiNiro in the sequel is still powerful.  But the way these movies were made, with long, long unbroken shots, a leisurely way of telling the story now come close to being boring. We have much dialogue, followed by silences and reaction shots, and many of us are impatient for something to happen.  In the beginning marriage sequence that starts The Godfather, minutes tick by until thirty minutes later, we're finally into a different scene.

2783351,5,B000NTPDSW,"""The Godfather"" (1972) was a stylized masterpiece. Its auteur director, Coppola, laced it with the subtlest Leftist message that may have avoided the radar of even longtime fans who have seen the film 10 or more times. When interviewed by producer Robert Evans, Coppola said he wanted to make a movie that was a metaphor for capitalism in America. Evans told him what he could do with his metaphors, but Coppola was brilliant and an authentic Italian, a Hollywood rarity at that time. His ethnicity was considered necessary in the making of a Sicilian mob picture.
In the classic Tahoe scene of ""Godfather II"", Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) tells a Nevada Senator that he is just as corrupt as he is. In the first film Pacino tells Diane Keaton (Kay) that his father is no different than the President, in that they are both powerful men who have other men killed. The ""family"" is depicted as a corporate empire that must change with the times like a car company, only the stock in trade of the mob was the transition from prohibition booze to heroin (although Michael's goal is eventual ""legitimacy""). What gives Coppola's work authentic panache, as opposed to so many heavy-handed liberal messages, is that in ""The Godfather(s)"", his messages have the ring of truth.",1233878400,3,1267,4.84331797235023

2783353,2,B000NTPDSW,"Since I bought this boxed set primarily for the Supplements, I will focus on those featurettes to hopefully help others decide whether or not to buy this edition for themselves.

Firstly, there are two discs of Supplements.  (The back of the slipcase's listing for the contents of Disc Four and Disc Five are reversed so that what is listed for Four is actually on Five and vice versa.  Somebody screwed-up.)

The supplements are as follows, along with my comments.

1) Making of the Godfather (a.k.a. ""Behind the Scenes""):  This is a bit confusing as there is ""The Making of the Godfather"" listed on the slipcase, but on the Disc this section is entitled ""Behind the Scenes"" and includes some of the items I single out below to discuss. ""A Look Inside"" is the first and longest section and covers alot of ground.  It is amazing to watch the screen tests of Al Pacino and, when the studio was still unsold on Pacino, we see James Caan being tested for the role of Michael!  And DeNiro being screen tested for the part of Sonny!  And Martin Sheen even is shown briefly reading for the part of Michael!  This is wonderful stuff to see.  Unfortunately, Brando's screen test is absent (it is minimally shown in a later extra, but I have seen much fuller footage of this historic screen-test elsewhere, and it SHOULD have been included in somewhere amongst these extras in a more extensive form.  It also seems that with ""Behind the Scenes"", way too much effort is expended in trying to push and promote the dubiously meritorious third installment of the Corleone saga.  We also learn practically nothing about Mario Puzo -  where he came from and where he came up with his ideas and what research was involved. Did a horse-head type incident ever happen in reality?  Was  the Johnny Fontane character truly based on Frank Sinatra and his bid for ""From Here to Eternity""? Things like that. There is also nothing of the Italian-American Civil Rights League's initial opposition to the production of the film. No discussion of the actual history of the Mafia is offered, even briefly. It would have been most interesting to say the least. And no mention is made of the great John Cazale's (Fredo)enormous contribution to Godfather parts I and II. On a scale of 1-10, this feature rates a 6, primarly because of the screen tests that are shown.

2)  Additional scenes:  I found these to be very interesting, some of course much more than others.  But on the whole, these deleted scenes from the three films are quite illuminating.  It is nice to know that Michael eventually avenges his Sicilian wife's death.  It is great to see Tom Hagen's wife, too!

3)  Filming Locations:  Interesting, but way too short.  The only location actually discussed is the use of a real street in the East Side of lower Manhattan.  Mention is made of a contemporaneous film student documenting the making of Godfather II on this street - and some of that documentary is shown.  It would have been nice to have seen the entire documentary, though.  But, given the world-wide backdrop of the Corleone saga, one would think that this featurette would have been more encompassing.

4)  The Corleone Family Tree:  this is simply a graphic.  Pure padding.

5)  The Music of the Godfather:  Simply a tape recording that Coppola made of Nino Rota playing various tracks on piano and a bit about Carmine Coppola that amounts to an exercise in nepotism.  I still haven't learned what Carmine did to deserve sharing the Oscar with Nino Rota.  This feature could and should have had so much more.  Commentaries by other film composers would have been wonderful.  This feature is short and lame.

6)  The Godfather Historical Timeline, Filmaker Profiles, Photo Galleries and Storyboards:  More padding.  Mainly text and stills.

7)  Coppola's Notebook:  This is a sub-section  of the ""Making of.."" While interesting to see how the director annotated the novel and broke it down into sections and kept all his notes in a big binder that - if it had been lost - was to be returned to Paramount for reward money...how much more interesting it would have been to learn more about Puzo's creation of the characters and the research involved.

On Disc 5, which is actually Disc 4, we find the following:

1)  Godfather World:  A quick overview of the cultural impact of the films.  Mildly interesting - but it mainly focuses on spoofs, cartoons and ""The Sopranos.""  The deeper, darker aspects of its impact are not explored.  This is mainly fluff - whereas it could have been a truly heady discussion with alot of talking heads involved.  I would loved to have heard what the actual crime family members made of the trilogy. Did John Gotti dig it? I would like to have heard from folks who hated the movies, also.  The Godfather making its way into Homer Simpson's world is amusingly interesting, but there are deeper ways in which the films have impacted and even changed American and world culture.  Few films have such an impact.  In not analysing this impact on a more serious level, this featurette falters.

2)  The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't:  This details Coppola's studio struggles - which are most interesting - but, again, there is nothing about the initial Italian-American boycott of the making of the film.  It was a stiff opposition and a tale that should have been told herein.  Studio opposition to Brando is mentioned, and all of two seconds of Brando's impromptu screen test are shown - but this featurette (as well as ""Behind the Scenes"") really doesn't examine Brando's contribution in any profound detail.  It would have been wonderful to see how his performance shaped the film and how the film resurrected him.  Somewhere in these two discs of extras, more should have been said about Brando.  Very little is.

3)  When the Shooting Stopped:  A brief look into some editing aspects.  Interesting, but not what I thought the title implied, and that was a  deeper look at immediate reactions and potential repurcussions to the crime families at the time.

4)  Emulsion Recuse:  Technical tour of the restorations.  Interesting if you like tech-talk.

5)  The Goddather on the Red Carpet:  Total garbage!  I thought this would have included coverage of the Oscar nights for all three installments of the Godfather saga, including the controvery surrounding Brando's win - and instead we get lame reactions about the impact the movie made on, of all people, the stars and makers of 'Cloverfield' while they stroll the red carpet.  Total padding, total nonsense.

6)  Four Short Films: These are nothing more than more pointless padding.  One is a short discussion on the relative merits of GF I versus II; one is a stupid ""riffing"" on Godfather issues with two comedians that is mercifully short. Blink and you'll miss it.  The last two deal with cannolis and Clemenza and are just as pointless.

On a whole, on the 1-10 scale, I would give the extras a 6.  They were good - but could have been much, much better.

One last note on ""Godfather III"" which I had never seen until I bought this set:  at about the point of the helicopter attack on the assembled mafiosos, I half-expected to see James Bond enter the picture!  Also...some of the dialog in the film is hardly better than that in a soap opera - and some of it is unintentionally downright laughable. I also haven't seen such a dragged out ending (the opera house sequence) in years.  And it is all so confusing, this installment, and the death of Michael's daughter is so utterly contrived that I couldn't believe this film had been made by the same man responsible for I and II.  Anyway -  I saw the boxed gift set in a store and, what can I say, it was an offer I couldn't refuse.",1232841600,6,7721,4.731780616078137

2783361,4,B000NTPDSW,"I didn't originally have the Godfather trilogy on DVD, so I decided I would finally go out and buy it. Unfortunately, the DVD set was re-released as the ""Coppola Restoration"" and I could not go out and find the original DVD set released in 2001 (which by now is far cheaper than the new set). Purchasing the new gift set, I went home and with great anticipation opened the box set and admired the new packaging and montage of photos from all three films aligning the front cover to the back in a blood-splattered animation. Included was new slim DVD cases for each individual film, and brand spanking new special features along with the previous special features from the first gift set encompassing 2 discs. Part II which originally was spanning 2 discs on the fist set is now compressed to 1 disc, which I find rather nice than having to switch discs in between the movie. However, the picture quality is sub-standard. Too grainy!!!! It looks like Coppola copied the films from the VHS versions of the movies and tried to sell it off as a restoration. I don't see any real problem with the tangerine colorization other reviewers are complaining about, but I do notice that some whites do get blurry when shown. But it does nothing really to effect the eyes. I'm keeping the Restoration as my copy of the films since I currently don't own a Blu-Ray player. I'd recommended this version of the trilogy for those who have Blu-Ray and recommend the first gift set for those who own DVD (I'm sure that some stores still carry it or you can buy it online, maybe from Amazon :-P).

2783363,5,B000NTPDSW,"THE GODFATHER (1972) was clearly ahead of its time, when it was
released, from its many aspects and from its 3 hour duration, much
can be said of it, mostly about Mario Puzo's imagination and
personality.

First, many will be critical of Puzo's opinion that Italian
civilization is the peak in human achievement, comprising wine from
grapes, olive oil, a peak in culture development comprising
sophisticated music, cuisine, high standard of etiquette, complex
marriage, baptism, funeral rites and ceremonies, multi-generational
households with grand parents and grand children living under the
same roof, etc. As such, this movie is an emotional outburst and a
shout to the world "" I love Italy"" which is not suprising, for an
Italian book author.

Secondly, in addition to the tribalism, another weakness is the
nostalgia expressed in the movie, such as being 21 years old again,
finding a spouse, entering adulthood and marriage, with all the
pressures that entails, the joy of Christmas and the family, etc.
This generosity by Puzo is in a part a gift to the feminine viewers
in providing entertainment, by underlining the personal, intimate
aspects of relationships, emotions, the birth of children, schools,
playgrounds, etc. But it shows that a man is multi-dimenensiol.

Clearly it is unrealistic to suggest that most or many Italian
Americans originate from cow pasture, bare mountain spots in Sicily,
from poverty stricken villages. In fact, Italy was and still is one
of the most prosperous nations on the Earth, and only a tiny fraction
of its population emigrated, the rest staying behind, most with full,
natural lives, obviously.

Thirdly, the movie shows a reluctance or a hesitance in the Italian
ethnic members in USA, in integrating into the mainstream culturally,
behaviorally, socially, such as, for example, in terms of the
sexually liberal conduct typical of  American. Puzo transposes his
own reluctance in letting go of his European and Old World beliefs
and values vs. present day-to-day society in USA. This is not
realistic, as 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants, for the most part,
lose all notion of their ancestors' language, cuisine, traditions,
ceremonial requirements, religious behaviors, etc, and that includes
Italian-Americans, clearly fully joining the mainstream.

Those aspects are only liablilities for those who do not descend from
Roman European countries, while for those who do descend, they are
curiousities, and paradigms, interesting observations.

The positives of this movie, is the full spectrum of emotions, wide
range of  experiences shown that comprise a human being ... the film
does require 3 hours to show those and does it well.

A surprising suggestion from Puzo, is that a Santa-Claus twin existed
in the USA at the turn of the 20th century, handing out favors, jobs,
contracts, promotions, justice as he saw fit, and people would turn
to him endlessly as if he was a witch doctor solving those ills that
nowhere and nobody else could solve, such as through the justice
system, a capitalist market, the responsible, good citizen conduct
from people at large. This is played by Marlon Brando, to perfection.

Another strength is the courage of the story in reflecting problems
at large, such as corrupt law officers, judges, politicians,
manipulated unions, personal animosities in companies that result in
rivals being left in the dust for trivial slights of ego, gambling,
prostitution, drinking rackets, etc, with the narco-trafficking on
the horizon, and the Las Vegas scene in its infancy.

Perhaps the most significant statement, in the movie, is Puzo
shifting from the early chest-pounding of Italian-Americanism, who
can do no wrong,  mid-way through the movie, as he focuses on the
inter-gang fighting among various crime bosses and gangs for
territory, each set on monopolizing the market, with betrayals,
traps, strategic  maneuvering behind the scenes, and gang-banging.

Puzo's wisdom, as well, is his notion that corrupted individuals are
not permanently bought, nor would they provide unlimited protection
or favors once bought. Brando is shown calculating mentally how far
his powerful personal contacts could go in  supporting various types
of mobster projects, this skill having taken him to the top of the
NYC underworld over many years, in addition to skill in reading
psychologically his opponents intentions from assessing them when in
their presence.

James Caan's character, according to Puzo, suggests a temperament, a
propensity to libidinous and hotheaded behavior that is not typical
of most Italian-Americans, which seems to stereotype needlessly the
latter group, as he's shown as having been an adopted son.

Overall, the movie is outstanding from the point of view of creating
tension, suspense, surprising viewers with the turn of events, in
connecting with viewers, showing culturally the struggle of Italian
Americans in leaving behind the civilization learn in the so-called
Old World as they take their space on the American continent.  The
mature subject will be difficult to take for many, such as brutality
from guns and car bombs and the taking out of fellow human beings as
mere pieces on a chessboard.",1231113600,2,5201,5.298906439854192
2783364,1,B000NTPDSW,"I will start by saying that, overall, the quality is 'okay'.  However, I don't have many good things to say about this set.

Firstly, there are two scenes (and I'm only 1/2 way through II) where someone was asleep, apparently, on the QA team.

Specifically, in part I, the scene where Michael confronts the baker in the hospital...Did they just decide to not touch that scene?

Secondly, in part II, there is a scene where all of the locals in Cuba are throwing televisions on the ground...etc... after the President steps down.  Right after the image of Corleone's plane preparing for takeoff.  There is some unidentifiable CRAP on the screen...

If this is what passes for 'quality', I'll pass.  Either I must've gotten a bad copy or someone just rushed this crap out the door.

I am not saying that if you had both a Blu Ray and non Blu Ray version of the Godfather running side by side, that you would not be able to see a difference. Just that with other Blu Ray movies, the difference to me has always been clear with a Wow factor. No Wow with the Godfather Blu Ray.

One plus that makes ""3"" still worth watching is Al Pacino's Lear like performance as the elderly Michael Corleone plus Joe Mantegna in his first major role adds menace to crime boss, Joe Zaza.

While The Godfather (which this review is chiefly concerned with) remains a towering achievement, with stunning consistencies of tone, a gripping narrative, and the sophisticated character arc of Michael Corleone, I wish I could say the Blu-Ray version tops everything. It doesn't. While colors are exceptionally rich and all scenes in the darkness of the Godfather's meeting rooms are finally truly viewable for the first time, you won't see a magical transformation to hi-def loveliness from the original film stock. Nothing can be done, for example, with the outdoor scenes, particularly the wedding and the scenes in L.A. I would recommend getting the Restoration DVDs instead and running them on a good upconverting player. I feel that the Blu-Ray version gilds the lily and doesn't add any value to what is already a masterpiece and one of the ten greatest films of all time.

 I find myself buying DVDs for the special features and that was the case here with two DVDs devoted to special features. Coppola's commentary is fantastic and there are some deleted scenes as well as some clever, interesting and then sometimes desperate, ""I'll use anything,"" special features.

The white spots are even more shocking esepcially when the films have  a dark composition.  Even if the spots are branded on the masters, they could have masked or removed these spots digitally, since they did a frame by frame restoration.

There is no point of the blu ray technology with its depth and resolution when we cannot get ""pure"" images as promised, and when white spots that could be easily fixed or removed ruin the images.

The studios should have a budget to fix this problem.  They could spend hundreds of millions on a film, but fail to spend a bit on fixing the white spots on the blu ray releases.  Blu ray should have a clean and perfect picture AT LEAST, and should surpass the theatrical experience with dirty and scratched prints (and those black spots when reels are changed), especially when Blu ray discs are not cheap.",1225324800,8,1053,4.598930481283422

II is a bit better but not much.  III is the best visually.  Given that many films from the same period as I and II look beautiful, I find this puzzling.  Coppola's real-time discussion of the first movie is fascinating in portraying yet another studio that was too stupid for its own good and nearly screwed up one of the greatest films of all time.  Godfather I is a fabulous film, if disquieting in its subject matter, but I wish Coppola would have incorporated the deleted scenes he included on a television version.  I was less enamored of II, which didn't know if it wanted to be a prequel or a sequel, so it did both and suffered for it.  I would have preferred a full prequel and made GFIII as the sequel.  Its higher operational budget is apparent, but the film is less satisfying.  Much more complex than Godfather I, I was often unable to discern the good bad guys from the bad bad guys.  Many have bashed III unmercifully, but I am not one of them.

I'll LOOK first.  Which I did with this: I rented it.  And I'm happy to report that it is as advertised, a restoration that's as good as possible, completely remastered, sound and all.  The grain level is more natural and the mottled highlights present in the first SD set are gone.  A couple of scenes are slightly blurrier than the rest, and there was one very, very brief scene that evidently could not be saved and looked as terrible as it did on the last SD set.  It was jarringly bad, but brief.  But the obvious effort that went into this suggests that the restoration team simply could not locate a salvageable print of that segment.  The rest of it is so good, I can accept this one ten-second flaw, and I'll definitely add this one to the collection.  Plainly put, this is it, as good as it'll ever be.  No matter how many times I see this, I'm still amazed at the level of acting, the rich characterizations brought to life with a thousand little touches.

Now I understand why these guys get paid so much. He even sounded like Marlon Brando let alone take on his mannerisms that he (Brando) had adopted for the part. Al Pacino did a sterling job as the linch-pin in all three movies and held the trilogy together in continuity terms at the very least but essentially gave the whole story some meaning in his role as the reluctant but necessary member of the ""Famiglia"" that tried to go legitimate.
As for this Restoration Edition the work that the studio did to clean up the thirty-five year old picture was nothing short of incredible. The transfer is so clean and precise that at times some of the outdoor scenes took on a three dimensional image and I don't think I have ever seen so many different shades of BLACK in a movie before. Overall this is a very dark movie (and I don't just mean its theme) and the Blu-Ray just brought it all out into sharp focus as I'm sure F.F.Coppola was aiming for in this beautiful restoration.

Over the years I have watched the Godfather and its brilliant sequel in various formats, film, VHS and DVD.

There is no comparison. The colors are deep and rich in Blu-ray, while they are faded and scratchy on the ""upverted"" DVD. The overall effect of the restoration is to bring that original movie onto that original theatre screen into my house. Even though Godfathers I and II have never lost their place in the pantheon of American film, we have for years been watching these films under less than ideal conditions. The darkness that surrounds Don Corleone and then Michael became more dark gray than near-black. In its 1080p restoration the vermillion Statute of Liberty rises from the flat marsh grasses looking more like amber waves of grain than a neutral killing field. Taillights twinkle against the buffed exteriors of post-war automobiles as Michael exits the restaurant after killing a rival don and a corrupt police captain.

In Godfather II the 1080p again recreates the feel of the original cinema release, subject to a few clearly enhanced scenes. In several of the lake scenes (excluding Fredo's last bite) the water seems bluer and the mountains purpler. As many Godfather aficionados know the lake house was actually on the California side of  Lake Tahoe. From the back yard the mountain profile Heavenly is unmistakable, establishing the California address.

The prequel segments featuring De Nero are bathed in sepia-like golden hues presumably as an antique finish that seems more reminiscent of Traffic than the theatrical rversion of Godfather II. It might be easy to say that the ""restoration"" has in some places done more than recast a damaged negative. However like the Star Wars recuts that used contemporary special effects technologies to create new virtual sets unimaginable in the 1970's, this restoration was the product of the original director in collaboration with the original cinematographer. These artists (and only they) are entitled to enhance their work using tools that help explain their original vision. this is not the colorized version of The Maltese Falcon whose pastels reeked havoc on a film noir classic. There is no reason these two films should not be works in progress by their creators.

The second issue relating to any enhancement is of course the viewer. It has been 36 years since the public has watched a fresh print of the Godfather. Since then we have seen it in less than optimal circumstances on over the air analog television, VHS, standard DVD and even Betamax. Each one of these formats substantially degrades the original film with poor resolution, pan and scan editing, and sloppy sound mixing. With so many exposures to these two classics under less than perfect conditions it is slightly presumptious to attempt to say what it looked like back then.

A 1080p Blu-ray version is a close as any average consumer is ever going to come to having a a fresh print. The bonus is that unlike a fresh print the digital imagery and sound will not fade, scratch or be formatted for television. In 38 years when Francis and Gordon (and I) will be likely be gone from this world this vision will be as fresh as it was today and in 1972 and 1974.

I have no comment on Godfather IIII, which is a poor cousin to the first two films. It is good to have, if only to show that money drives Hollywood and even great directors.",1223510400,14,5038,5.891780821917808

Even if you have the 2001 set, this new version has a much crisper picture and sound, making it a much better experience to watch and fully enjoy. The new extras are wonderful such as the great documentary on the problems making the film and how the film has impacted popular culture. The leftover extras from the first set are still great like the hour-long documentary on the making of the saga and the slew of deleted scenes that do add new layers (and for thos complaining about this not being the ""Saga"" set, some of those scenes are included in this category). So for any fan of either these films or just great movies in general, this set is a must-have in order to enjoy these classics to their fullest.",1223164800,2,807,4.386666666666667

I was very disappointed in the quality of the picture, the colors were just OK and a lot of things just faded into black throughout the scenes.
All in all it was a good buy but I really believe it could've been so much better. This film deservers it!",1222992000,3,434,4.117647058823529
2783409,1,B000NTPDSW,"I ordered this on blu ray after hearing about its release and seeing the good price on Amazon. What a complete waste of money. I've seen better quality on non blu ray. This is one of the most grainy blu ray movies ive ever seen. Not worth the money or the effort. I cannot believe this is the best they could do with this movie. Its all hype and no sustenance. Save your money and don't buy this.

Since I first received this I have bought a few ""older"" movies as well to see how they compare to this. I picked up A Clockwork Orange and also The Shining. How could they have messed up Godfather so bad in comparison? Both of those movies in Blu Ray are not even in the same ballpark as the Godfather ""restoration"". To me the studio and Coppola are doing nothing but ripping off the public with this version as it is just horrible. I stand by my original review and marvel at the loss of $62 on crap.",1222992000,11,899,4.137142857142857
2783410,2,B000NTPDSW,"I love Bluray and I love the Godfather so this appeared to be a perfect marriage. But, right from the start I was wondering if I had received the wrong discs or something. In some cases the picture quality seems to be not even as good as some previous DVD versions played via a BluRay player, in other cases the picture quality is downright terrible. What exactly did they spend that year they claim the restoration took doing? I understand that older movies won't ever look as good as other BluRay transfers but this is basically a rip-off. I have several other versions of these movies and wouldn't have bought this one if i had had any sense that the picture quality would not be any better....who would? I have the best possible set up from a player/television/connections standpoint so it isn't the equipment. Save your money and use one of the prior releases.",1222992000,4,865,4.623376623376624
2783411,3,B000NTPDSW,"I watched The Godfather Part I on Blu Ray, from Netflix, side by side, against the standard DVD, which I already owned. The Blu Ray  was played on a Panasonic machine, and the standard was played on a Toshiba HD machine, and so was upconverted. Both were watched on a Sharp Aquos 40 inch, and the input was simply switched back and forth to access one movie or the other. They were synchronized to play the same scenes side by side. And I have to say that I just don't understand the RAVE reviews amongst the videophile crowd, who seem to feel that the Coppola restoration provides levels of artistic fidelity hitherto unknown to mortal man. The fact is that some scenes were better on the Blu Ray (and as one reviewer on Amazon pointed out, very HD-like), and some scenes actually were better on the standard. In addition, there was a kind of hyper-contrast and orange-ness to everything on the Blu Ray, that not everyone is going to like. As for me, I wanted to like the Blu Ray better; I am something of a collector, and wanted an excuse to make the purchase, but in the end, I don't think that I will. For those who must, it won't be the worst investment you've ever made, to be sure, but please, let's stop with the hyperbole, already!",1222646400,94,1240,4.414847161572053
2783412,2,B000NTPDSW,As MOST BR titles this is another one that should be passed. BR doesnt highlight any (restored) improvements to this trilogy. I have been a bit more picky as of late on which titles I have been picking up on blu ray due to lame transfers. This is an improvement to the earlier dvd set however BR doesnt give it any advantage.

2783413,4,B000NTPDSW,"Let's put this behind us: the Godfather was, is and will always be 'grainy'. It's just the way they were shooting movies THIRTY-SIX YEARS AGO. So, yes, it's a 36 year old movie and it looks its age. It's true, '2001' looks a lot better on blu but, apparently, that's the best that could be extracted from the existing Godfather negatives - there is an entire 'extra' that explains how the transfer was done and the sometimes painful choices the restorers had to make. The transfer is grainy all over. It's grainy all the time. The whites are grainy and so are the blacks. In the end, it does not really matter or it didn't matter much to me because it's better than anything I've seen yet.

Moving beyond grainyness, the picture is steady like rock. I wasn't able to detect any major artifacts. The extra available on 'disk 4', showing the kind of work and the technology invested into this product convinced me that this is the best-looking Godfather except maybe the first screening at the Chinese theater in Hollywood that we are going to see in a long, long time. [A post blu-ray 'better' edition is possible in 10 years or so, when blu-ray is surpassed by a new technology, because the best negatives found were digitized on a resolution that's about 3 times higher than the current blu-ray.]

No major complaints about the sound. It's TrueHD 5.1, it's clear but don't expect any surround effects. I doubt the original was even stereo. It was a little bit low-volume on my stereo but it's probably my equipment to be blamed.

The extras on the 4th disk are actually worth watching. They are shot in HD. There's one where just about all major elderly and late-middle-age Hollywood directors and stars show up and say something, there's one about the restoration itself, a little short where some younger artists appear and say funny things. Overall... not too bad. Oh, besides the HD's, you also get the extras from the 2001 DVD edition and THAT's where you see the difference between Blu and the (previous) DVD version.

Now, for the bloopers section, get this: the blu-ray comes with the plastic disk case inside a cardboard boxy sleeve (very nice) but... there's also a nice 12-page brochure with the pictures of Coppola, Pacino, Brando and information on the contents of each of the 4 disks - coffee table style. Well... the brochure was meant to fit inside that cardboard sleeve, next to the plastic blu-ray disk case but it comes actually GLUED to the cardboard case because... it's too big. Someone forgot that the blu-ray cases are a bit smaller than the DVD's and, apparently, the brochure was supposed to be a 'one size fits all' kind of deal that doesn't fit the blu-ray. Sad.

Overall, I enjoyed the Blu Godfathers. While, yes, the picture is grainy and the transfer does not look like the Transformers or Ratatouille, not even like '2001', the blu-ray does look a lot better than the DVD version. This rendition of the Godfathers has many defects, it's far from perfect but, as far as I know, it's the best there is. I do not regret making the purchase.

I took away one star for the little brochure snafu and for the relatively high price (likely to go down) at release time.",1222473600,158,3193,4.652482269503546
2783414,3,B000NTPDSW,"I was very dissapointed in this transfer--
Specifically in the early G-1 wedding sequences, the whites are wayyyy
washed out and in fact there are some scenes where it appears as if they are adjusting the F-Stops during the transfer and the effect is distracting; There is additionally a short sequence when Michael goes to the hospital to check on his father...a short clip that appears to have been skipped from the restoration--damaged and grainy-out of whack with teh rest of the repair; THe seond half of G-1 looks OK and G-2 looks OK as well---but a very uneven opening for G-1 and I aggree that it prob was not worth the money to go to this Blu-Ray version.",1222473600,4,664,4.588235294117647
2783415,5,B000NTPDSW,"The restoration is perfect. The Godfather is a cherished film not a window of mob life. I was looking forward to the clear and sharp window like picture of today's blu-ray's. But as I watched The Godfather I realised this is the perfect picture for the movie. Most of all the colors pop with such a variety of dark colors and the blacks are real blacks and not the gray's with alot of noise in the dvd collection. I laughed when I saw the Mo Green hit. Me and my friend always made fun of it and now it is a brutal execution. Before it was a watery light pink that ran from his eye. Now it is darkened and even seems to have a thicker texture to it. The audio is crisp and keeps the original mostly front channel sound. The whole perpus of the restoration is not to make it the perfect picture, but to make it the perfect viewing exerience of the Godfather. And even though its not as sharp as the current blu-rays it is a vast improvement. Any True Godfather fan will make the upgrade.",1222473600,5,986,4.1947368421052635
2783416,2,B000NTPDSW,"If you already own the trilogy, this Blu-ray version is not an improvement.  Most of the movie is extremely grainy - you will notice very little difference over regular DVD. To be fair, though, strangely, some scenes are definitely HD.
Also, unless you have upgraded your sound system to TrueHD, you can forget about having digital sound in English. This disc does not play DTS or Digital 5.1 in English.  However, DTS is available in French or Spanish - if you happen to prefer the international theater experience.  It's not clear what the folks at Paramount were thinking here. VERY Disappointing!

Don't be fooled by comments indicating ""that's the way old films are supposed to look"" - 35mm film is capable of capturing far more detail than your HD/1080p TV can reproduce, so depending on the condition of the ""master"" film stock, there's no reason this film should not look great in HD.  Need proof? Check out ""Grand Prix"" starring James Garner (i have in HD-DVD), filmed in 1964, and released '66.  Picture will leave you breathless - looks like it was filmed in HD - a perfect showcase for your HD theater.
There are plenty of grainy, nostalgic-looking versions of Godfather out there, including the old VHS versions.  The blu-ray version is not worth the $60-80 upgrade.",1222473600,8,1279,4.839449541284404
2783417,3,B000NTPDSW,"This Review is based on The Standard DVD format Restoration, not The Blu-ray Version.

I'm on the fence about this New Restoration Box Set(The Restored GODFATHER III is a cleaner version), but I'm leaning towards an all-out PAN of this New Restoration. Unfortunately, I listened to some of the reviewers here and purchased this Set. (A couple of you owe me a few bucks.) It doesn't look like any of the reviewers here did a side-by-side comparison test of The New Restoration and The Original Versions of these films on DVD. I did mine on a 50"" Panasonic plasma.

Yes, the New prints have fewer scratches, dirt, and grain than The Original Set, (which is not as bad as some reviewers suggest). But, the COLOR ENHANCEMENT of The New Restoration Set is OVERLY saturated in many parts. Especially, in the Red Scale. Yellows and orange flesh tones are extremely pronounced, overly brilliant, and unnatural looking in this Set. And it still contains scratches, dirt, and grain. Not as much as The Original Set, but it's still there. A lot of the grain in certain frames has been removed, while other frames remain untouched and appear to be just as grainy as The Original Version. A very uneven transfer in my opinion.

In the opening shot of THE GODFATHER, the Undertaker is so overly saturated with yellow that as the camera pulls back to reveal Don Corleone's desk, it renders The Undertaker almost out of focus. Trust me, this shot looks far better in The Original Set. Compare the shot in THE GODFATHER of Luca Brasi in his apartment, donning his bulletproof vest, in preparation for his meeting with Sollozzo. The colors in The Original Version look natural, while The Restoration renders Luca's apartment in a blazing wash of bright sunshine yellow. These frames are entirely over-saturated with color. I assure you, certain frames of this Restoration DO NOT look anything like the Original film stock print. The warm and natural looking sepia tone of The Original film has been blasted away with digital color in many frames, almost making them look unreal.

THE GODFATHER II has been compressed onto one disc, while The Original Version was compressed onto 2 discs.

(By the way, I could care less about The TV Saga Version. It's not the way these films were shot, and it's not the way they were intended to be seen.)

Some frames of The New Restoration look very grainy, some look  incredible, while other frames make these films appear as if Ted Turner Colorized them. At times, I wasn't sure if I was watching THE GODFATHER, or SPEED RACER.

Is this version worth a Double Dip? I'm still on the fence about that. But, I think I prefer The Original Box Set over this half-baked attempt at improving this Classic with an over-saturation of color.

I get the feeling that The Blu-ray Version must look really odd. Blu-ray is great technology for newer films. Older films tend to suffer from over-saturation with this technology. The public is so enamoured with Blu-ray, they don't realize some of the classic older films don't resemble their original celluloid color exposures anymore. And that's a shame. It's going to take some more time before remastering technicians understand the remastering treatment that some of these classic older films deserve. Sometimes less is more.

If you must have The Restoration, turn the brightness and color way down on your TV.

I'm calling this THE GODFATHER: THE COPPOLA VIDEO GAME GIFTSET.

Act accordingly.

UPDATE:

There is no question that this Standard DVD Remastered Version is overly saturated with color. Here is a pretty SIMPLE ADJUSTMENT SOLUTION that seems to work quite well, reproduces truer color, and makes these Remastered films much more enjoyable. At least it did on my 50"" Panasonic Viera plasma. (I also use this for The Anniversary Remaster of SCARFACE which is also overly saturated with color.) Stay away from the VIVID and CINEMA Picture Settings. Use the STANDARD Picture Setting which will give you the following numbers: Picture 50, Brightness 50, Color 50, Tint 0, and Sharpness 75. Simply tune the COLOR setting down from 50 to 35. I found that changes to the other settings were not necessary. This should take care of the overly saturated playback color issue. I do not know whether this adjustment will work as well with an LCD, Projection, Tube TV, or Blu-Ray Disc.",1222387200,150,4343,4.867208672086721
2783418,5,B000NTPDSW,"Absolutely superb restoration - compared to the previous version the images have come to life, creating a whole different cinematic experience. The new sound is also very impressive. This is a must-buy.",1222387200,,202,5.34375
2783419,4,B000NTPDSW,"Obviously this isn't a review of the movies themselves, but the restoration and transfer to Blu-ray. Since The Godfather Parts I and II are two of the greatest movies of all-time, and also my two favorite movies of all time, I couldn't wait for this to be released. I'm sad to say it leaves me slightly disappointed. There was no ""wow factor"". It does not look a whole lot better than the original DVD collection. The main difference in Part I is, the restored version has a much brighter tone to it. Part II has more vibrant color. Part III looks almost the same as the original DVD. If these were DVD's, I'd say they were excellent. But for Blu-ray, they just aren't much better than an up-converted DVD. If I were going to show off my home theater system, these definitely wouldn't be the disks to use.
With all that being said, being a Godfather fanatic, it was still worth it to me. If you're a fanatic too, then you still have to buy it.",1222300800,18,943,4.363636363636363
2783420,5,B000NTPDSW,"NOTE: Opinions vary but MY review is designed to help those who haven't purchased the product decide whether or not they want to. If you disagree, write a review--the comments section IS for that but not the voting system.

A marvelous restoration job, ""The Godfather-The Coppola Restoration Gif Set"" includes all three original films as they were presented theatrical. It doesn't have the version that Coppola cut for TV and presented in chronological order. THe first two films are masterpieces and while the third is severely flawed, it does have its moments.

Keep in mind that these were restored for theatrical showings NOT for the home video market and, as such, these probably aren't the best Blu-rays to use to show off your home video system. Some people will no doubt be disappointed but, quite frankly, these films have never looked this good before on home video. Is this a big step up from the DVDs? Yes and no. The Blu-ray does provide better resolution but keep in mind it also shows the flaws inherent in the original films (and some people will regard the grainy images as being a flaw).

First keep in mind that ""The Godfather"" was meant to look grainy so those of you who hate grain will probably wonder why they didn't eliminate it.  That's because to do so would have required altering the look of the film not restoring it and the usual result of eliminating film grain is that you lose detail. The result also makes it look like the actors are walking wax dummies. Some scenes are much grainer than others but that's the way the film was meant to look.

According to Harris in an article at American Cinematographer, the original film was in extremely bad shape and, in some instances, frames from outtakes had to be subsituted because damage had crept into the frame area of the film.

""The Godfather Part II"" was in better shape for a variety of reasons and didn't require quite as much work on it as the first film.

""The Godfather Part III"" since it used different development techniques from the first three (and for other reasons you can read at the American Cinematographer website)and only required Harris to match the black levels and make sure the color scheme was done correctly.

Robert Harris has done a marvelous job on the restoration of the film. Colors are bolder than before with nice crisp images as cinematographer Gordon Willis originally shot the film. While the DVD looks terrific, the Blu-ray looks positively stunning. Does it look like a film released last year? No, of course not that would be impossible but Harris working with Coppola and Willis has brought the film into the 21st century without overprocessing the image (like the recent Blu-ray ""Patton"")and staying true to the original look of the original film elements if they were in pristine condition.

All of the previous extras from the boxed set have been ported over in HD along with some new extras including ""The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't"" documenting the difficult birth of the film from Paramount asking Puzo to initially change the period setting to 1970's Los Angeles to the constant threat of Coppola being fired during the shooting of the film. ""When the Shooting Stops"" covers the post-production efforts of editing and scoring the film.

THe humorous ""Godfather World"" has famous directors illustrated the cultural impact of the film and features bits and pieces from ""The Simpsons"" to ""South Park"".""Emulsion Rescue documents Robert Harris' restoration efforts of the aging film elements. ""Four Short FIlms of ""The Godfather"" is amusing as well.

The 12 page booklet included with the Blu-ray was clearly designed for the DVD because it's much too large to fit in the Blu-ray holder (it's glued to the outside packaging). It's odd to design the booklet like this as you'll have to either trim it down to fit inside, slide it in where it might possible become creased or store it separately to prevent wear and tear. It has a bit of info on the Oscars for the films and the credits. It's an odd extra to include because it doesn't have anything truly essential NOT included on the Blu-ray or DVD boxed set.

I'd highly recommend this compelling saga on Blu-ray and DVD. It's a huge improvement on the previous set, has new and previously released extras (including Coppola's often blunt commentary tracks)and looks terrific. For those looking for the TV version that ran in chronological order just be aware it's not here as part of this set although many of the deleted scenes used to assemble that one are included.",1222214400,184,4546,4.82904884318766

...And brand new Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround (48kHz/24-bit) tracks for all three films. Also included are English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640kbps), English Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono (192kbps) and French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640kbps). Subtitles in English, Spanish and French.

Now, if we think of the HUGE importance of these films, we have to admit this Blu-ray edition is IMPRESSIVE by any measure and should be regarded as the best way to enjoy those films.",1222128000,13,3418,7.080568720379147
2783423,5,B000NTPDSW,"For those crying for the ""Godfather Saga""/""Godfather Epic"" versions, you are missing the point.  Restoration expert Robert Harris (and countless others) worked for over a year from the best available print materials (as the original negatives are badly damaged and faded) to restore the first and second films to their original theatrical glory, which is something these iconic films of American Cinema deserve.  That is the point of restoration.

If you are looking for a ""wow"" disc to show off your Blu-ray home theater sound and video, this is not it.  If you are looking to experience modern American Gangster cinema in its 1970's glory, this is as close as you are ever likely to get, muted sepia-esque color, film grain and all.

These were not done exclusively for the home market.  The priority was that they were restored for theatres, because that is where they would be judged the most critically, and all indications are that they do not disappoint.  Never watch these films in your living room with the lights on.  Watch them like you do in the theater, lights out, to appreciate the effort that went into these films.",1222041600,557,1131,4.854166666666667
2783424,5,B000NTPDSW,"The new transfers for The Godfather Parts I and II are stunning. It really is like seeing them for the first time. All of the murky, faded colors have been restored to their original glory while still retaining the warmth of the film stock. Gordon Willis' then-controversial cinematography can finally be seen they way it was intended on these new discs. If you have the original box set, it is worth it to double dip if only for the restoration job on these two films.

Carried over from the original set are all of Francis Ford Coppola's commentary tracks for the three films. On The Godfather one, he appropriately enough, starts off by talking about the film's famous opening scene and how it was supposed to start with the wedding but a friend suggested he do something else. Coppola talks about how he organized the elaborate wedding sequence and shot it only 2-3 days! He talks about the pressure he was under by the studio and in read danger of being fired because they didn't like what he was doing. This is pretty solid track that we've come to expect from the veteran filmmaker.

Coppola's contributes another excellent commentary for The Godfather Part II. Initially, he had no interest in doing a sequel and dealing with studio bureaucracy. He suggested Martin Scorsese for the job. The studio balked at this idea and accepted all of Coppola's terms. The veteran filmmaker talks at length about the development of the Corleone family from Part I. Coppola is engaging and very articulate, delivering a top notch track that is well worth a listen for any fan of this movie.

Finally, there is Coppola's commentary for The Godfather Part III. One of the heated debates the filmmaker had with the studio was over Pacino's hair. He wanted Michael to look older and like a man in crisis, while the studio didn't want to mess with Pacino's distinctive looks. Coppola defends his casting of Sofia and feels that she delivered a ""real"" performance because she wasn't an actor. He also addresses the scathing criticism she received as in fact an attack on him. This is a solid track with good observations and analysis by Coppola -- better than the film itself.

The rest of the supplemental material is spread out of two discs. Thankfully for those who did not buy the first box set all of the extras from it have been carried over with a whole other disc of brand new material.

The fourth disc features all the brand new material and starts off with ""Godfather World,"" which takes a look at how The Godfather films influenced popular culture, including parodies on The Simpsons and South Park, and how it informed the characters on The Sopranos. All kinds of celebrities, from William Friedkin and Alec Baldwin to author Sarah Vowell who sing its praises with clips of shows and films that reference it.

""The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't"" tells the story of how Hollywood had changed at the end of the 1960s with the demise of the studio moguls and the rise of the film brats, the first generation of film students who became filmmakers. One of them, Coppola, ended up being picked to direct The Godfather. This is an excellent look at how the director almost didn't get the gig and why.

""...When the Shooting Stopped"" examines the post-production phase of the first film. Coppola battled with the studio over the length of it. Executives initially did not like Nino Rota's score for the film and samples of some of his original and revised cues are played.

""Emulsional Rescue: Revealing The Godfather"" takes a look at the newly restored transfers for Part I and II and how they preserve Gordon Willis' gorgeous cinematography. This featurette takes us through the restoration process, showing before and after examples.

""The Godfather on the Red Carpet"" is a forgettable featurette shot during the premiere of Cloverfield with various minor celebrities gush about the films.

""Four Short Films on The Godfather"" features celebs citing which one they prefer, Part I or II. Another one has Richard Belzer, and the man who adapted the films for the stage, quote their favourite lines, which turns out to be quite funny. The third one sees Coppola talk about his love of cannoli and how made it into the film. Finally, Coppola answers the question about what happened to Clemenza in Part II and why he died.

The fifth disc starts off with ""A Look Inside,"" a feature-length documentary about The Godfather trilogy done when Part III was being made. As a result, a lot of the major players were interviewed. We see Coppola at work on this film with on-set footage of the director working with Pacino. We also see Coppola working on the script with author Mario Puzo. The doc then goes back to the first film with Coppola's battle with the studio over casting Brando, Pacino, et al. with fascinating vintage screen tests and rehearsal footage. This is an excellent extra that goes into great detail.

""On Location"" revisits key locations in the lower east side of New York where they shot parts of all three films and how they transformed them into various historical periods.

""Francis Coppola's Notebook"" examines how he adapted Puzo's book into the first film. Coppola shows us his notebook that he used as his master document that he would constantly refer to. This featurette provides fascinating insight into the man's creative process.

""Music of The Godfather"" features an audio excerpt of a conversation Coppola had with composer Nino Rota about the music for the film. Also included is footage of composer Carmine Coppola (Francis' father) working on Part III. Francis talks about working with his father.

""Coppola and Puzo on Screenwriting"" features the author talking about the origins of his novel while Coppola discusses adapting it with Puzo into the films.

""Gordon Willis on Cinematography"" features the man talking his approach to the look of the film and the choices he made and why.

""Storyboards - Godfather Part II and Part III"" allows you to see sketches for the look of both films and see how Coppola planned to shoot them.

""The Godfather: Behind the Scenes 1971"" is a vintage promotional featurette done at the time of the production of the first film. This is a fantastic snapshot of the times.

""The Filmmakers"" are text biographies of key crew members.

Also included are 30 additional scenes from the four eras, spanning the entire trilogy. Much of this footage was inserted into the first two films when they were shown on television.

""The Family"" gives you a handy organization chart for the Corleone family. You can see who everyone is and how they are related.

Finally, there are ""Galleries"" with trailers for all three films, stills, a collection of portraits of enemies of the Corleone family, and footage of the Academy Awards wins for the first two Godfather films.",1222041600,711,6813,4.835051546391752

2783426,2,B000NTPDSW,"Dear Mr Coppola You Restoration idea is crap. It is an apology for a terrible DVD release. AND WHERE IS THE THE COMPLETE EPIC?????? The chronological one??? With ALL THE OUTTAKES!!!. This Version in many of our minds is the finest film. Do hand any damn excuses. Consumers: DON""T BUY  this totally incomplete box set. I have the VHS set of THE COMPLETE EPIC it's only weaknesses are VHS resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio. I am Making a BLURAY copy. Everyone with this version should do the same to preserve it before Coppola deep sixes his best version like he did with Abel Gance's Napoleon with his father's score. I believe in paying for a product BUT HOW MANY TIMES AM I GOING TO GET RAPED PAYING FOR INCOMPLETE AND INFERIOR PRODUCT? WAKE UP FRANCIS. Whattza matta you?",1221696000,12,771,4.586956521739131

2783428,5,B000NTPDSW,"I have been an avid fan of the collection of masterpieces that in it's whole is known as ""The Godfather Collection.""  Recent advances in technology in the film industry, that are capable of enhancing the film's look, sound and overall quality are here.  Blu-Ray format is perfect for the job.  I have the utmost trust in these skilled men to bring the film into the 21st Century.  May I offer a suggestion during the restoration, to allow some editing and splicing of the film to allow the film to follow it's chronological order.  Purists may argue it's desecration of the original.  It has been sold in VHS form already...perhaps a ltd. ed.",1219104000,4,642,4.6875
2783429,5,B000NTPDSW,"Yes, to have all three movies restored for Blu-ray release is fantastic, but die-hard Godfather fans are longing for a chronological release with ALL the extra scenes found in the Saga (1977), Epic (1981) and Trilogy (1992). There are so many enjoyable and important scenes left out of the original movies. The scenes of Sonny taking control after the Don is shot is invaluable. After Connie's wedding, the Don & his sons visit the dying Genco in the hospital. The scene in Part II of Don Fanucci singing a Sicilian song and later trying to fix up Vito with one of his daughters. There are too many to mention here, but having the movies in chronological order with all the deleted scenes would the ultimate Godfather collection. Please Mr. Coppola, give us this special set!",1218412800,7,775,4.7481481481481485
2783430,5,B000NTPDSW,"I have been waiting for ""The Complete Epic 1902-1959"" to be released on DVD for years. And now I want it on Blu-Ray. This isn't it. I'm talking about the 1981 VHS release of the first two films combined into one, in chronological order with additional scenes. Godfather II, as everyone knows, contains flashbacks which don't necessarily add to the narrative. Tell the story in the order it takes place, throw in some lost footage, and add the third film to that, and we have an awesome epic film that isn't interrupted by 3 sets of opening and closing credits, telling one continuous epic story... 1902-1979.

This release has its place for purists, but I want the saga edition.",1217635200,8,678,4.697478991596639

After all 2 of these films(Godfather and Godfather Part II won the Best Picture Oscar for the years 1972 and 1974!!! Looks likes it's going to be done right this time(not saying that the 5 DVD set was bad thing,I own that release too,but this Blu ray set is supposed to be TOTAL RESTORATION of these films baby,the icing on the cake!!! Four discs(3 for the movies,and 1 disc for the extras!)This is what us fans have been waiting for!!! Two thumbs up!!! way up! PS,Hopefully ""Apocalypse Now"" will get the Blu Ray treatment it deserves in the not to distant future,guess they want too see how this release does! My only quibble is not include the ""Complete Epic"" version as well(as other reviewers have stated),because Blu Ray Dics have tons of space which could allow this to be done,it it would be a true treat for us fans,but it seems that for now the remastered movies + extras is what's going to be on this set!!!

They have them on the extra disc, but not in the movie. I saw it on cable once, and loved it! It made more sense with the killing of the race horse, not just to strong arm the studio head, but because of the abuse of the child star!

For all of ous too young to have witnessed these movies on the big screen (or at least the first two), this will certainly be an entertaining experience!

Now, why the hell it's only region A (or 1, whatever you want to call it, US and Canada only)??? Will it take another year for Paramount to issue a Worldwide/Europe version perhaps, and that one will have missing chapters or messed up disc structure?
God, I really hate those guys and I wish I understood what goes on in their tiny brains...",1215993600,3,705,4.465116279069767
2783435,5,B000NTPDSW,"I love that these landmark movies got a squeaky clean restoration, added special features, and that Godfather II is on one disc instead of two.  As a Godfather fan, of course I've ordered this new set, BUT I can't wait for a definitive chronological edit to hit DVD someday (soon?).

Previous chronlogical edits include: (1) ""Godfather 1902-1959: The Complete Epic"" which is a VHS-only 402 min. chronological edit of Parts I & II not available on DVD or laserdisc.  Doesn't include Part III (171 min.) which would take it to 573 min. total; (2) ""Godfather Trilogy: 1901-1980"" which is a Laserdisc chronological 583 min. edit of Parts I, II, & III (std 171 min. for Part III); and (3) ""Godfather Saga"" (aka Mario Puzo's The Godfather Saga: The Complete Novel for Television) which is a chronological 605 min. edit of Parts I, II, & III with added footage (434 min. for Parts I & II plus std 171 min. for Part III) done for TV broadcast only.  This version was never issued commercially in any format.  Some lucky people like me were able to record it off TV.

ALL of these chronological versions are slightly different and all contain at least some footage not contained on the other versions!  Come on Francis, give the fans a super complete chronologiocal edit sooner rather than later!
