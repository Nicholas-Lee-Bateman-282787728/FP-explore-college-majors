8030388,3,B0002PYS1A,I enjoyed watching the DVD but didn't get too much out of it other than a recommendation to use 10th chords more often. The DVD is littered with interesting examples and techniques but Steve does not spend enough time on any one example to help you understand what is really going on. I would have preferred more explanation of the music theory and less 'just play this and it will sounds good.',1461542400,,395,4.5
8030389,4,B0002PYS1A,"I was amazed at Steve Allen's fluency with jazz even though I've seen him perform on his comedy show.
The lesson includes sheet music that made it easier for me to follow his instructions including some neat tricks.",1389312000,,215,4.684210526315789
8030390,5,B0002PYS1A,"Steve Allen was always enjoyable and this Instructional DVD is no exception. His instuction is folksy and engaging and provides some fun and helpful ""tricks"" for embellishment and bringing you improvisation up a notch(or several notches). He also puts the styles in historical context with stories and examples of various players throuout the years.",1371859200,,349,5.481481481481482
8030391,4,B0002PYS1A,"I found this video interesting because I used to like watching Steve Allen on TV years ago. Pay attention to the word ""Introduction"" in the DVD's title. The 80-minute DVD left me wanting a lot more material to work on. Steve has large hands and made liberal use of 10ths with his left hand. My hands are too small to play tenths, so many of the songs I can't play. Steve mentions other Homespun instruction tapes and working with a private piano teacher, so he obviously knows that his lesson is not enough. It comes with music shrunk down to about 75% and stuffed inside the DVD plastic box. It seems best suited as a motivational and informative video one would check out of a library to view once. It is enjoyable to watch.",1207267200,6,726,4.425373134328358
8030392,5,B0002PYS1A,"I enjoyed this DVD.  Steve Allen is both funny and clear.  He gives lots of little points that point us in the right direction.  The video is crisp and you can see what his hands are doing.  He touches on specific riffs, general principles, and who to listen to.",1200700800,7,262,4.285714285714286
8030393,5,B0002PYS1A,"The late Steve Allen was a modern renaissance man or maybe just a jack of all trades in music and performing.  He wrote and played popular jazz standards as well as being a funny comedian, an author, and a very likeable TV personality.  In this DVD made from a 1994 tape he shares a lot of little 'tricks' which he either discovered or learned from the greats of jazz like Art Tatum and others.

I'm just a beginner in piano and I can't pick up eveything he is doing the first time going though this.  It will be something you will want to go over many times.  There are a lot of things here that if you go over them on your own or better with a teacher can make you sound a lot better than you are.

The DVD is divided into 33 sections of 2-3 minutes each so you can find any of tricks to go over easily.",1178928000,8,805,4.0
8030394,5,B0002PYS1A,"This DVD presents a great insight into the world of jazz piano.  Taught by Steve Allen, this is a great how-to on the tips and tricks of being a successful jazz pianist.  Includes a number of great arrangements of standards.",1143763200,4,224,4.575
