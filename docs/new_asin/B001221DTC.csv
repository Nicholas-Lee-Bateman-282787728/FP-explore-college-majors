Only drawback for me was the language used, though not gratuitously, none the less it's a bit of a downside to an excellent story. It would never be shown on network TV in the USA because of that, however the acting and story line are first class.",1502496000,,300,4.472727272727273
8243529,4,B001221DTC,"I had never heard of marking time till i was on youtube and came across it. So i started watching it and loved it. It has a great story, great acting and real life events. Abe Forsythe (Hal) and Bojana Novakovic (randa) have great chemistry together and work well together. This story feels real because of the september 11 attack and how it can affect the people and change the world.
I def recommend watching this and buying it too!",1253577600,,434,4.4375
