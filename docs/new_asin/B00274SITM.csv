3857901,5,B00274SITM,"My 2.5 year old daughter loves all of the figures in this DVD.  This is the very first cartoon series that she watches and actually understands what is going on there.  And now she wants to ""go to China"" too.",1260403200,,208,4.175
3857902,5,B00274SITM,"My daughter's loves this video. I recommend anyone who has a child that likes
Kai lan to buy this dvd.",1254873600,,102,4.15
3857903,5,B00274SITM,"We are a interracial family and have really wanted our child to learn Chinese along with English.  Kai Lan truly has sparked her interest.  She is 4.  She is constantly coming up to us and asking us how do you say ""----"" in Chinese.  She also tells us words in Chinese that she learned from Kai Lan.  She loves watching this movie and insists on watching it at least twice a day.  She also now loves learning Chinese.  I have every intention of buying all the Kai Lan movies and/or books as they have been a huge plus in helping our child learn Chinese.",1253232000,14,553,4.259615384615385
3857904,5,B00274SITM,"My kids (ages 5 and 7) love Kai-lan. I was pleased that there was not as much [...] behavior on this one--it dealt with some fears about trying new things (and they always liked the new things--I think it would be better if sometimes they tried it--and liked the old shoes better). Great culture (shoes off in the house, spending time with older relatives, bamboo forest, naming ceremony) and vocabulary, catchy songs. An unofficial bonus is that for this midwestern girl, Kai-lan's super-Michigan accent in English is a comforting taste of home.",1252886400,7,546,4.945652173913044
3857905,4,B00274SITM,"I bought this for my daughter who enjoys watching the cartoom on nick jr. Like other nick dvds it is a collection of stories from the series. The characters are very cute and it tries to incorporate learning good manners like sharing,moods,etc.
We enjoy most of nick jr's dvds.",1249776000,,277,4.673469387755102
3857906,5,B00274SITM,"The main show in this DVD is A trip to China.  In it Kai lan and her friends board a plane and fly to China to meet Kai Lan's aunt and a baby Panda.  Of course it is a cartoon, so there are no realistic scenes in it from China, but it does show a little about the cultural difference. Eating noodles and putting on slippers in the house.  It also has a section with the famous changing of the mask.  The end has a lot of fireworks (which were invented in China).

The moral lesson is about trying new things, and it thankfully does not have the really negative behavior or actions like some of the other episodes.

The meeting the pandas is not realistic b/c it is a family that lives together and of course they talk --- but my little one (2 years old)  loved it because they introduced the panda as a bao bao.  Which is her Chinese nickname.  The main Mandarin word taught is Happy and there is a little song about it that has the word Happy through out it.

The other 2 episodes are Rain or Shine and The Ant Playground.",1248393600,31,1023,4.121212121212121
3857917,5,B00274SITM,Kids loved it,1454544000,,13,3.6666666666666665
3857918,3,B00274SITM,"It's adorable! Kids really love it. But, I would not say it's that educational, as there are very, very few words in Mandarin taught in the story. Those words don't connect to each other, either. They are randomly selected, such as watermelon, grandfather, grandfather's sister, happy, etc. There is some interesting parts where they talk a little bit about the Chinese culture, such as giving babies ""tiger head shoes"" as a way to repel evil spirits and how the Chinese address close friends as uncle, sister, brother, etc. The show is a good vehicle to introduce some Mandarin to young kids at age 4 or 5, but my pre-k and kindergartener students know much more words in 30 minutes than the whole movie. So, I would say that this show is good for entertaining purposes only.",1449705600,,776,4.713235294117647

3857940,5,B00274SITM,"We like this cartoon video. It's cute and easy to follow for my two and a half years old daughter.
She can understand the content and repeat the Chinese words and simple songs.
It's not bad at all for a few dollars' entertainment.",1408492800,,230,4.372093023255814

3857942,3,B00274SITM,"We love Ni Hao, Kai-Lan on Nickelodeon and this movie is an ok representation of the TV show.  I think my daughter gets bored watching it because it's not the regular length she's used to.  We've started making it a 2-part watching experience to make it more interesting.",1405382400,,271,4.625
3857943,1,B00274SITM,Does not teach any Chinese whatsoever and the story is silly and repetitive. Maybe cute for babies but not educational for preschoolers. A waste of time to watch it,1401840000,,164,4.689655172413793
3857944,5,B00274SITM,My granddaughter loves these movies. She just turned one years old a few weeks ago. The music is upbeat and catchy. Would definitely buy from again. AAAA++++,1399161600,,157,4.851851851851852
3857945,5,B00274SITM,"If you are only wanting to buy one Kai-Lan movie, this is it. We have several and by far this one is my daughters favorite and mine. As well as watching the show, my daughter and I love to play pretend ""flying"" to China (and other places around the world, but she usually wants to go to China) This one has so many great features, plus the other episodes on the disc. One of the reasons I like this episode so much is it shows the world map in relation to where they are and it covers traveling and also trying new things. Plus, PANDA BABY!",1396915200,,540,4.10377358490566
3857956,4,B00274SITM,"Used this in our Chinese New Year unit study.  As we have lived in China was concerned about the authenticity of the film - but it was well made.  Kai-Lan is good for working together, respect, and being aware of other's feelings.  Always something young and old can learn.",1393718400,,273,4.530612244897959

3857958,2,B00274SITM,"Not what I expected: I bought this DVD, hoping for my kids to hear some chinese language. But these stories are based on translating the basics such as hello and good bye. Then per story there are just two or three words they teach throughout showing a long english cartoon.",1387238400,11,274,4.5
3857959,5,B00274SITM,"Arrived on time.  This is a must have dvd for all Kai Lan fans.  I purchsed 5 of
these DVD along with Princess Kai Lan to give away to little kids in my family.
The 2 DVD set is perfect , combined they have 6 stories , each story teaches the children
how to share, play together , etc. I find these very educational . I  also like the other two
dvds that are out .",1385424000,,364,3.763157894736842
