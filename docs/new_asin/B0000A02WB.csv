1899324,1,B0000A02WB,"I would just love to launch into an abusive diatribe over this film, but I'll make the effort to restrain myself. Personally, I thought it was pathetic. This was not so much the lack of Macaulay Culkin in the role of Kevin. I thought the new kid did an okay job. At least he could act.
However, what completely and utterly ruined this for me was the use of French Stewart as Marv. Now, I'm sorry, but no one will ever equal Daniel Stern's performance as Harry's dopey sidekick. The facial expressions were hysterical, where French Stewart is a one-expression actor: squinty.
That is all he seems to know how to do - squint. Perhaps it's a throwback to his days on 3rd Rock, but if they just had to try to cash in on the Home Alone franchise one more time, why, oh why did they have to choose Stewart as the bad guy?
I'm sorry, I'm starting to rant.
Moving on:
The acting from the rest of cast is actually quite decent, and some of the stunts are funny enough to get some good laughs.
The movie follows the typical Home Alone plot. Child is left alone, for whatever reason. Child uncovers dastardly plot. Child foils dastardly plot, employing various lethal techniques. Child makes friends with social outcast. Child reunites otherwise dysfunctional family in time for end of movie.
Admittedly, they have attempted to provide H.A.4 with a twist or two, particularly involving the bad guy/s. But the decision to have Mother & Father McAllister separated, and Father A. shacked up with a rich girlfriend...? The only plus out of that was the 'automatic house' which Kevin so abley worked to his advantage.
Disasters are aplenty in this movie, the same as with its three predecessors, but unless you're a devoted French Stewart fan, I'd recommend renting this one only. Because the guy is just so damn wooden in his performance, it's painful to watch. (His one-dimensional acting spoiled a potentially good film in Inspector Gadget 2, as well)
Rent if you will, but otherwise don't waste your money.",1078185600,7,1995,4.686609686609686
1899325,1,B0000A02WB,"By now, most people agree that ""Home Alone 1"" was/is a classic holiday comedy. I mean, come on, who can ever forget Macaulay Culkin's ""AAGGHHH!"" face after putting on the after shave? ""Home Alone 2"" was great, as well. It introduced America to the Talkboy voice recording unit. But instead of going out on a good note, they had to keep pushing their luck. And ""Home Alone 3"" was just... ugghhh. No Macaulay, no Joe Pesci, no Daniel Stern, no McAllisters. Just another little snotty kid (who went on to have no movie career... at least Macaulay did a couple of other movies after HA 1&2) and some other stupid would-be robbers (one of which looking like David Schwimmer). And now this... I can't even find the words. Now they have some OTHER little punk kid trying to be Macaulay!!!!
WHAT!?!??!
That's like someone other than Dan Castellaneta doing the voice of Homer Simpson!! (Well, perhaps not that drastic, but you get the idea.) I wouldn't care about this movie (or at least not enough so to write a review), but it has the ""Home Alone"" title attached. WITHOUT MACAULAY CULKIN, JOE PESCI, AND DANIEL STERN, IT IS NOT - I REPEAT, NOT - HOME ALONE. Seriously, no more! Let the series die peacefully. Now, while it still might have a shred of dignity left. Anyway, avoid like the Noid. He ruins pizzas. HAH!!!
Seriously, do not view or buy this. Stick with 1 & 2 instead.",1077667200,19,1372,4.558704453441296
1899326,1,B0000A02WB,"This so called 'fourth' installment in the ""Home Alone"" movie series is the biggest joke in a movie series since ""Batman and Robin"" from six years before then. This movie is a disgrace to the 1990 original and the 1992 sequel and even to 1997's ""Home Alone 3"".
 Everything that came together on the first two in the series completely is rearranged and the timeline is altered but the result is totally disastrous on every level. Not even having one's brain turned off for a while is enough to make one enjoy this weak fourth edition.
 The acting is increidbly weak by everyone involved. Not to mention how they completely remade the McCallister family. The large extended family of Kevin was a riot to watch and although a bit obnoxious at times, it was funny watching Buzz get ticked off when he saw a bill for 986 dollars at the ending of the ""Lost In New York"" movie from 1992. ""Home Alone 4"" robs the family of all of it's charm by making them into just a nuclear family.
 Even the plot is utterly pointless with Kevin's parents spitting up and his father living with a new girlfriend at a rich mansion and Kevin stayign with him for Christmas but the mansion is robbed by would-be thieves but the slapstick jokes don't work on this movie. One scene is totally unrealistic where a faucet is left on to stop the thieves and the kitchen almost looks like an aquarium and is totally flooded. Hello! In real life, the water would just seep through cracks on the floors and walls and cause water damage to much of the structure. Plus it's impossible to turn a house into a human aquarium because the overflowing water would simply flood the room, and then the adjacent room and flow outside. You're house is far more likely to become totally filled with water if a flash flood occured (I.E. Hurricane or a large dam failed).
 The villain thieves are just incredibly devoid of any character and come off as being obnoxious, crass, petty and awfully stupid. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were perfect for playing Kevin's adversaries in the first two movies but whoever these clowns here who play them, their acting is weak and it sure looked like they were ready to leave the set.
 So this movie was a low-budget flick but even then, all of that money allotted into making this movie is utterly wasted in it's making. Whoever thought up of this should've looked at James Cameron's 1984 classic ""The Termintor"" to see how a low budget movie is made right!
 This movie is completely unworthy of one's time. Even the awkward ""Home Alone 3"" was miles above this rubbish!",1077062400,30,2560,4.5664488017429194
1899327,3,B0000A02WB,"It's no secret that many despise Home Alone 3. At least it had some kind of technical proffesionalism behind it. The first 2 (and a bit of the 3rd) movies also benefited from a very strong musical score that elevated them far beyond a typical family comedy. Home Alone 4 however has an extremely cheap score and feels rushed and empty.
The very lean running time means there is no house full of traps, not a lot of plot to be wrapped up and no emotional pay-off. Plus, if I am correct in assuming Kevin's age in this film, this happens the same Xmas he was Lost in New York. So what's it to be? Dad's girlfriend's house or New York? Plus Marv is played by French Stewart (who didn't even bother to grow a beard for the part) and the rest of the cast is a bunch of unknowns. And it's obvious this was not filmed anywhere near winter, the lack of snow robs the film further of any Xmas-y feel it might have had. And what's with the constant, terrible ADR? It's very distracting.
There were some funny parts to this film and the new kid playing Kevin did it well. But the hand-held camera thingy, the bare sets and lack of anything to do with Xmas make this film look like a poverty-stricken TV movie.
The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen and has a mediocre Dolby 5.1 track.",1068595200,16,1277,4.2809917355371905

A forth Home Alone film!! O.k. the first film is a holiday classic, the second was quite funny as well. The third Home Alone film was a Hollywood sin, and an unforgivable one. Now lets end this.. this direct to DVD film is not going to appeal to both adults and children, as the first two films did. It's very much on the same level as the third one.

This movie, a followup to the critically acclaimed box-office smashes ""Home Alone"", ""Home Alone 2: Lost In New York"" and the cinematic classic ""Home Alone 3"", starring Alex D. Linz, who was forever immortalized in Jim Carrey's ""Liar Liar"".
French Stewart of the critically-acclaimed TV series ""3rd Rock from the Sun"" and Missi Pyle, who stole the screen in this year's box-office hit ""Bringing Down The House"" alongside comedic geniuses Steve Martin and Queen Latifah star as the villians in this film.

Well, I actually enjoy Home Alone 4, because I saw a TV promo for the film when I was about 10 or 11, or maybe even 12 and to me, the trailer for Home Alone 4 looked rather amusing. The trailer was part of my childhood and I saw this film for free to find out if it was as funny as I thought that it would be. Call me crazy, but I enjoyed it for what it was. Why? Not because it's bad, but because I enjoy certain films that appeal to younger viewers. If you're younger than I am and enjoyed the first three films in the series, give it a shot or if you're a big fan of awful films (like myself), fans of awful films should give it a watch. Even if you just enjoy watching films for no reason, give it a shot!

1899406,1,B0000A02WB,"This is quite possibly one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. For starters, it was a made-for-tv movie. Kevin is still somehow 8 years old, they don't live in the same house, none of the other family members from the first two films are mentioned, and Kevin's parents are randomly getting divorced. A bratty annoying technology obsessed kid named Mike Weinberg plays Kevin this time, and he's awful. There was no way in heck he could ever try and replace Macaulay Culkin. To make things worse, they cast squinty-eyed French Stewart to play Marv.

Kevin's dad is now dating a spoiled rich girl named Natalie. Kevin wants his family back together, so he sneaks to Natalie's house and they just let him stay around for awhile and play with cool technical toys. Because Natalie is rich, she has to throw a party for some Prince from another country. While Natalie and Peter are out, Marv and his new wife, Vera show up at the house to rob it, so Kevin has to play 'Jigsaw' again and stop them. (The traps in this film are terrible, lame, and generic.) My only advice is avoid this 'sequel' like the plague. It makes Home Alone 3 look like a masterpiece. I definitely would not recommend HOME ALONE 4: TAKING BACK THE HOUSE!!!",1417996800,,1223,4.5590909090909095

1899408,5,B0000A02WB,"Most people seem to hate this Home Alone. Call me crazy, call me stupid, but from the very day I purchased this movie, I loved it and still do to this day. And for two reasons. One, I think Michael Weinberg gives an extraordinary performance as Kevin McAllister. Secondly, because John Hughes ain't involved in this one, the acting is stronger and more energetic. Stupid John Hughes always had his actors looking and talking like zombies. (Like Meryl Streep in all her roles). Now that he's out of the picture, some real acting surfaces. That's not to say I don't agree with some of the criticism about this film. First I don't understand how half the McAllister kids can be cut out. What happened to Lynne and Jeff, Uncle Frank and Aunt Leslie and their kids? What happened to Harry? Secondly I detest the woman the father lives with. One scene I particularly cringe at is when Kevin's in bed and she says to him, ""You want your father in your life, you better not cross me. Understand?"" Makes me want to jump through the screen and punch her. The selfish rich dame obviously hates children. So what made her want to be in a relationship with a guy who has them? I'm so glad when he comes to his senses at the end and dumps her. This film I think is kind of unhinged from the original story but still holds promise. Michael Weinberg is cute as a button and does a great job at holding the picture together. Maybe it'll never be a classic like the first and second HOME ALONE, but still it's a film and a worthy one.",1407283200,2,1516,4.379432624113475

1899433,1,B0000A02WB,"What a pathetic hack job of self-abasement. What's this all-around horrific film supposed to be, anyway? A crash course in S&M, or something?

The movie has hundreds of awful aspects, which the plethora of other reviewers have pointed out. But the most offensive and insane elements have been largely overlooked. These include...

A. The piss-poor character development, and astonishingly-feeble attempts at creating protagonists and antagonists

B. The downright disgusting promotion of ""family values"" at the expense of one's mental health and self-respect

Let's face it: Kevin's older siblings (Buzz and Megan) were complete jerks in this film. All they ever seemed to do was bully, torment, and insult Kevin -- unlike in the first two Home Alone movies, where his home life appeared much more decent.

So naturally, my own reaction at the beginning of Part 4 was, ""Get out, Kevin! Get out, get out, get out....Yes!""

He flees to his dad (Peter), who is currently separated from his mom (Kate) and is living at his rich fiancee's (Natalie's) mansion.

Well, personally, at that point, if I were 9 years old, I would've been in absolute euphoria: away from abusive siblings, surrounded by cool toys and gadgets galore, and bestowed with extra freedom to run around and mostly do as I pleased! And of course, in that situation I could always call my mom whenever I missed her.

Why on Earth would Kevin want to leave this blissful wonderland at Natalie's mansion, and return to his siblings' haughty house of pain?

Only in a loony la-la land of lackluster character development and righteous, moralistic ""family values at all costs"" monstrosity could such treacherous tripe spew forth. This film seems to imply that sustaining bad relationships is preferable to being lonely, and is a complete slap in the face to anyone with the slightest speck of self-esteem.

Well, next up on the set of silly flops are the flimsy attempts to antagonize Natalie.

Let's face another observation: Natalie wasn't a bad person at all. On the whole, she was very nice, pleasant, and friendly, with a few minor quirks. No big deal.

One evening she, Peter, and Kevin happily trim the Christmas tree together, only for Natalie to have it re-decorated professionally the following morning (Christmas Eve), as previously scheduled. In this scene, the movie tries to portray her as a shallow, heartless snob. But in fact, the royal family was going to arrive later that day, and she wanted her magnificent mansion to be in mint condition, in order to present a good face. This is perfectly understandable.

That night, with the royal family's arrival delayed until the next day, and following Kevin's second major house-damage incident, Natalie has a little chat with him. She delivers an ultimatum to Kevin, informing him that he'll be kicked out if he wrecks the house again. This, too, is totally reasonable. (And in my opinion, she's extremely generous in actually giving Kevin a third chance.) But once again, the misguided film makes an effort to antagonize Natalie in this part, and once more fails miserably.

Of course, she's a nontraditional ""career woman"" who doesn't have kids of her own, and is highly successful financially, so she must be an evil, wicked witch, right? At least that's what this ""fabulous family flick"" stereotypically tries to project.

And finally, oh boy,...there's the horrifically disgusting ending of utmost proportions.  ***SPOILER ALERT***

Let's reflect upon one more shiny little detail, shall we? Kevin's dad Peter had been sleeping with Natalie (i.e., the ""other"" woman) for quite some time. In other words, he'd been cheating on his wife Kate, with whom his divorce was soon to be finalized.

So, in the final scene, in front of all the characters, Peter announces his breakup with Natalie and reunification with Kate. Kate then rushes out to embrace him with tears of joy.

Oh my goodness...are you freaking kidding me? What kind of self-respecting woman (or man) who'd been cheated on would *ever* degrade herself like that? And just how long will it be until he runs off and cheats on her again?

Sheesh. No wonder Natalie needed a barf bag at the end. And for anyone else unlucky enough to endure this sickening train-wreck-of-a-flick who has even the smallest sum of self-esteem within, you have my sympathy.",1332374400,,4338,5.023709902370991

1899442,5,B0000A02WB,"Ah, how amusing be the failed attempts of others... I never had interest in 'Home Alone' beyond parts 1 & 2. I came across these reviews by accident, and such negative reviews made part 4 look so bad that I had to see it.

(the g'z up version of ""Jingle Bells"" is playing as I write this)

I expected sub-zero levels of acting & dialogue, and was certainly fulfilled! The two most horribly disturbing things in the movie are Kevin's irises. They are ridiculously enormous, almost filling his entire eyeballs. They are even larger than they appear on the DVD cover. They are horrendously awkward, and they seem about to jump through the screen and attack you. I truly can't recall such a disgusting child. All three children, for that matter, are entitled and snotty monstrosities... That ""type"" of rich spoiled kids who ruin the lives of everyone around them. They have that soft, pasty white, ""perfect"" look, which immediately conjures the pure necessity to vomit.

This fine film's most entertaining quality is the deliberate and overdone character introductions. It is fascinating to hear the characters say each others' names, repeatedly and unnecessarily, in order to remind us who the ""returning"" characters are supposed to be. I need that, because I am idiot, and if I have the proper help and if I try real hard, I can ignore minor discrepancies such as entirely different faces, personalities, and character traits.

As you can tell, I was truly touched by this warm masterpiece. I highly recommend that EVERYONE, should not only own this monumental piece of cinematic history, but should also invest in at least three backup copies.

Oh by the way - Mama Kevin takes Papa Kevin back with absolutely no hesitation, simply because he decides to come back after a lengthy live-in sexual romp with a young hot brunette.

1899444,1,B0000A02WB,"Some of the many problems with this film:

1. The criminals remind me of Bart and Burtha in Rusty, except that they are even more stupid. Yes, it is possible (unfortunately).

2. The story line is incredibly weak. If you thought Home Alone 3 was weak and overly childish, well, this film is so much worse.

3. Without pointing out any one actor, overall, each actor could have played his or her role better.

4. The film contains so many inconsistencies. For example, when Kevin's mother suspects that something is wrong at the mansion, instead of calling the police, she drives (very irradically) on the highway from her home to Kevin's father's mansion. Any sensible mother would have called the police rather than risk her own life and that of her other children (who she took with her).

5. The music in this film was nowhere near the quality of even Home Alone 3, let alone the first 2.

Note: There is no reviewer conspiracy to cause this film to be rated very low. The film really was very badly created. I have not even started to list many of the minor problems I found with this film. Suffice to say, ""too many little holes can sink a large ship,"" and ""too many little problems in a film combined with three of four major ones, caused any film to sink very, very quickly.""",1237334400,7,1282,4.48068669527897

I really wanted to like this movie, but I just can't help hating it.  Not only do they (unsuccessfully) revive the old characters with new actors, but the plot is weak, the script is weaker, and the acting is flat out embarrassing.  Kevin spends Christmas with his dad and his dad's girlfriend (his parents are divorced, which is another thing I don't like - it makes this less of a ""family film""), and he can't stop getting into trouble.  Just as in Home Alone 3, no one believes him about the crooks (Marv and his wife).  He keeps trying to explain himself but no one will listen.  The thin story ends as you might expect.  No big surprises, and no booby traps for the criminals.

Secondly, in this movie there is very little of the slapstick humor which made the first three so funny. In the first three, the boy set elaborate traps which the bad guys fell for. In this fourth movie, there are few traps set, and they are not original or that funny.

One other disappointing aspect of this fourth movie - in this movie the family is being broken apart by divorce. Although the divorce is not final yet, the husband has already moved in with his girlfriend and is getting engaged. Not the best for family values!

1899455,3,B0000A02WB,"We have to give a very special applause to C. Columbus. He is the mastermind behind the first two ""Home Alone"" movies. ""Home Alone 3"" uses different characters plus a different cast. ""Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House"" uses the same characters as the first two, but all the characters are a different cast. M. Culkin does not even play Kevin. As I watched this movie on ABC Family Channel, I was putting myself in Culkin's spot, thinking how he would think as he would watch this. I noticed spots that M. Culkin would have said different things in the script. There were certain spots that I noticed that the real K. McCallister would have said something different and/or would not have ""put up with"" certain people. I will give one example. When K. McCallister in this movie, ""Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House,"" saw his arch-nemises, Marv, in the drive-way of his father's home/mansion (they are divorced now, his father and mother that is), K. McCallister (the one played by M. Culkin) would have done something similar to saying ""Here comes some more fun"" and raising and lowing his eyebrows a couple times. This K. McCallister instead runs to the buzzer to buzz for the butler for help, like a wimp. All I know is, in the first two ""Home Alone"" movies, K. McCallister was no wimp, and M. Calkin proved that.

Lastly, Buzz and Megan, K. McCallister's older brother and sister are much younger in this film. Plus, the mother looks entirely different and the family (seen running around the house in the first two movies) was absent. I would strongly recommend that, if you still wish to watch this movie because you are a die-hard ""Home Alone"" fanatic like myself, keep an open-mind about it, otherwise it is just a waste of time, literally. My favorite of the four is ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York."" Remember this part?: ""Hold it right there!"" See if you can find that quote in ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" instead of watching this movie, it will be a better use of your time.

Something that could of saved this movie is the acting. Yes they brought back Kevin but the orginal Kevin is to old; why not a new charcher like Alex Pruitt from Home Alone 3. Home Alone 1 & 3 are really great movies that you can enjoy. Why bring back the ""McCallisters"" when you change the adults too even Merv which the orignal (Daniel Stern) played changed. This movie just dosen't make sense why is Kevien younger in this movie.

Home Alone 4 should have been made in 1999 and Alex D. Linz should have had the role a sequil to Home Alone 3; (like from Home Alone 1 ""1990"" to Home Alone 2 ""1992"".)",1133568000,2,741,4.181818181818182
1899458,1,B0000A02WB,"""Beethoven's 5th"" and ""Home Alone 4."" Back in the golden era of John Hughes, who was really something in the 80s, I couldn't imagine the day would come when we see his name in this direct-to-video sequels. Even if he only permitted to use (or recycle) the main characters, it is a shocking thing to witness this.

But the film is made by 20th Century Fox, one of the major studios in Hollywood, and to be fair, the production designs are decent, Yes, Kevin McCallister is no longer played by Mr. Culkin, but kids all grow up someday. And look, Marv, one of the original burglars comes back to Kevin's house, but sorry, it is NOT Daniel Stern. (It's French Stewart, who is not bad).

Some viewer, quite understandably, don't like the story about Kevin's parents who live separately, but it could be OK. Today that is not a rare thing. Some viewers again don't like the idea of different actors playing the main characters, but hey, that happened to James Bond or Dumbledore, and we didn't care.

[THE REAL PROBLEM ] is this. This time Marv doesn't steal. Why? For he needs money so desperately that he and his girlfriend (Missi Pyle) decide to kidnap Prince. I mean it, THE PRINCE, a child of the royal family. But from where? The big mansion of Kevin's Daddy's girlfriend. But how? Oh, this is a big surprise, but there's an insider. And what happens? Many slapsticks, many of them just unfunny.

But the most embarrassing is Kevin, the kid himself. Sorry but I must tell you. The character of Kevin is really awful, even offensive. Kevin not only frustrates the burglars' plans by booby traps (so far, fine); he also enjoys doing it! If you don't see what I am trying to say, see the scenes in which Kevin, sitting on a sofa, sees French Stewart and Missi Pyle literally trapped in the rotating bookshelf, which goes round and round, faster and faster. See how the boy laughs, like watching a movie on TV! Yes, he laughs with loud voice as if he's one of the Warner Brothers' animation characters. I saw all the `Home Alone' series, but this is the first time I really wished that the burglars would win and take everything away. They surely deserve that.

I thought `Home Alone 3' was enough. John Hughes and other people did think otherwise. Now I think `Home Alone 4' is truly enough, and really hope that they think the same way.",1132704000,48,2334,4.534441805225653

THEN CAME HOME ALONE 4!

They should really have named it something else- without the words 'Home Alone' in the title- because, associating this film with its three predecessors is an insult to them. Are we being unfair to this film by comparing it to the previous three? Is that the reason it seems bad? Well, let's put it this way: Watch this film before watching the other three, and you won't want to watch them at all! But believe me, this film is defintiely not a 'Home Alone'!

The black and the white of it: -

THE BLACK:-

- Weak story- putting a child in a gizmo-surrounded environment is a fun thing to do, but cannot sustain a film.

- The 'fun' and 'what next' elements are lacking- leave alone edge of the seat- you probably will not be sitting on any part of the seat.

- One thief (character: Marv) is the same- the actor is different. Not much of a problem, though. In the third film, too, the robbers were all different. That, in fact, creates a bit of a consistency-problem. Home Alone 3 decided to put an end to te storeylie of the first 2. Home Alone 4 decides to re-start it. Quite a mess, really. Why call the guy Marv when we associate the name with an altogether different face?

- SIMPLY, NOT AS FUNNY AT ALL!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE RIB-TICKLING, ""HA-HA-HA- I CAN BARELY BREATHE"" JOKES?

-The 'meticlous, almost snobbish buttler' was a weak attempt at being funny in the stereotypical way.

THE WHITE: -

- The thieves- Marv and his girlfriend, especially the girlfriend, are quite funny! She did a good job. Her mannerisms and so on were amusing and keep one anticipating 'a BIG BANG JOKE'- which, however, does not come.

ALL IN ALL- do not bother watching the film. However, watch it, if you will, to compare it  to the previous three. You will probably want to reach out to an actual 'UNDO' command, and erase this from your memeory- so that the magic of Home Alone is preserved!",1118016000,5,2195,4.4575
1899461,1,B0000A02WB,"This is simply awfull. Like Home Alone 3, we are introduced to the same 'people' as HA1 and HA2 but different actors who don't even look or act the same (Kevin McAllister has got younger!). The film looks rushed, is very poorly acted (with the exception of the young boy) and badly script and directed. I would advice you not to watch this movie. Enough said really.",1108944000,9,366,4.477611940298507
1899462,1,B0000A02WB,"This is not Home Alone. The producers of this film screwed everything up with their own dumb imaginations. I  don't care if I don't see this movie again, because I really don't want to. I AM TELLING THE TRUTH. The snow is computer generated because this must've been made in the frickin' summertime and nothing is the way it should be. Not even the best film makers in the world would be able to pull THIS off. I THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY THIS MOVIE. 1 star=dreadfully crappy.",1106092800,9,472,4.425287356321839
1899463,3,B0000A02WB,"I'll be honest, I didn't think Home Alone 4 was a bad movie.  It's better than other Amazon reviews make it out to be.  The real trouble is that this movie was advertised as being another sequel to the smash hit, Home Alone.  It clearly isn't.  Just because they use the same characters in the movie doesn't make it a sequel.  Kevin gets into trouble every time his dad and his dad's girlfriend leave the house, and like in the third one, no one believes him about the bad guys.  No traps for the bad guys this time, either.  This is not a bad movie, but it isn't Home Alone.  If you want a real Home Alone movie, get the first two.  The third one is very good too.",1105315200,19,665,4.093023255813954
1899464,1,B0000A02WB,"This movie makes the statement, ""It never should have been made"" mean something.

This installment in the series returned to the old, tired plot of Kevin and the burglers instead of expanding on the theme as was done in part 3 (the best of the series). The other reviews have provided plenty of info on the poor storyline so I won't even write about that mess.

Talk about political correctness run amok. The filmmakers tried to do a Home Alone where no one got hurt and failed miserably. The whole point of these movies is to do a live action Roadrunner cartoon where people are blown up and keep coming back for more. With that gone, none of these movies is worth watching. If a part five is ever made, here's some advice: kill the Kevin storyline and blow things up.",1103846400,5,769,4.446808510638298

1899467,1,B0000A02WB,"Oh god, how could they do this? If you haven't got the original cast of a film, then don't make a seaqull using the same names!
This movie could have worked, and just been an average movie to me. But they had to use the name Makilister. The name from the original 2 movies that starred Macully Culklin. Why oh why oh why would you try to pull off a brand new set of cast as the same people that made the original box office hit's over ten years ago?
The kid in this film looks nothing like the original Kevin Micalister, who resembles Culklin in now way, not to mention he's about 3 foot shorter, 2 pounds larger, and 10 times as less intelegent. Then they tried to pull off the parent's of the first 2, which look nothing like them either, nor did French Stewart trying to be Harry, who was original Daniel Sterns charactor.... they looked nothing like the originals, they didn't act anything like the originals, and why oh why would they even try to use the same name's of the charactors?
If they had have given them new names, and try'd to pull this off as beeing a completly different fammily then the Macalisters, then it could have been an OK, 2 or 3 star movie. But when your sickend by whoever's idea it was to use the same name, and expect the audience to be dumb enough to go with it, then it get's 0 star's.
YOU DO NOT TRY AND SELL A MOVIE AS BEEING THE SAME CHARACTORS AS THE ORIGINAL, IF THEY ARE NOT THE ORIGINALS, OR DONT EVEN RESEMBLE THE ORIGINAL ACTORS
If they beleive they have made a good movie here by using the original name's, then they might as well make a 5th seaqull to bury the franchise, and get a fully grown Chris Rock to play Kevin Macilster and Leslie Neilson to play the mother, Rosie O'Donnel can be the father, the brother can be played by the rapping granny from The Wedding Singer, and we can get a new guy to play the old man from part 1? hmmm.. maybe Jim Carey? they can expect the audience not to notice the diffrence in age appearence and persinalty to take your mind away from the bad casting arrangment's.
the movie could have worked if it was maybe a different fammily name, and not supposed to be the same fammily as 1 and 2's..or maybe even if they made it a cartoon? But don't mess with classic, reciginised names and charactors and expect people to buy into it? Whoever had that idea made a very big mistake.... ignore the fact that there supposed to be the same fammily, and that the kid is supposed to be Maculy Culklin, and you still will see it's not a great movie anyway. But it was a horrible idea to use the same name's, at least part 3 had a chance, because it wasn't meant to be the same kid!
On a final note: Just look at the rip-off and ridicules price they want for this film?! Then look at how many + how much, used copys are going for!?!?!?! The movie isn't even worth watching for free~!",1087257600,15,2850,4.231192660550459

New characters and the kids were younger then the original cast. Like 10 years younger from Lost in New York. Poor storyline and horrible acting!
