8269565,3,B0018D6BLU,"This film claims to be set in the 1940s but you could never tell by looking at the costumes or Sarita Montiel's hair and make-up. Strictly mid-1960s. BUT did I buy this for period detail? No. Nor for good dialogue or an intelligent plot. I bought for Sarita. She sings all my favorite songs of hers, albeit sometimes in very cheesy settings. But she is all she is meant to be and more.  I bought 'All Zones' DVD through Amazon and not the DVD described. Mine was clear, though it required a replacement as the first was horribly scratched (The disc, not the images. They just froze.) But to see Sarita at her most glorious, it would be hard to beat NOCES DE CASABLANA/BESAME or LA VIOLETRA, for that matter.",1230076800,,707,4.438461538461539
8269566,1,B0018D6BLU,"""NOCHES DE CASABLANCA"" is a nice romantic thriller which was lavishly produced in 1963 as a tribute to the 1942 classic ""Casablanca"" The film is a Spanish-Italian-French production in widescreen and color that also serves as a vehicle for the extraordinary talents of the legendary Sara Montiel. It also stars Maurice Ronet (his third film as Montiel's love interest), Franco Fabrizzi and other international actors.  Among the songs that Montiel sings in this movie are ""La Vie En Rose"", ""Besame Mucho"" and ""Quizas, Quizas, Quizas"".

All that said it'd be nice to purchase a DVD of ""NOCHES DE CASABLANCA"" but the one sold here should be avoided at all costs. This is just a shameless bootleg made in Spain to rip off consumers. To begin with it doesn't have any credits so you get no information about the film. On top of that there is footage missing including a couple of Montiel's musical performances. And, to top it all up, the last 10 minutes of the film go out of synch and the visuals do not match the sound!

The fact that such a rotten illegal product has received worldwide mainstream distribution makes a disturbing commentary on the sad state of affairs of the home video industry not to mention the ineffectiveness of copyright laws.",1215820800,2,1248,4.7953488372093025
8269567,2,B0018D6BLU,You will regret buying this bootleg.  It's missing about 15 minutes of film and towards the end the video goes one way and the audio goes another way.  Totally crazy! Note that the one reviewer who wrote good comments is not referring to this horrible DVD but to some VHS version of the same film. Don't fall in the trap.,1211846400,,321,4.333333333333333
