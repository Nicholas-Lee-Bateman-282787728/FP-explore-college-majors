6247221,5,B00I211L48,ok good one.  fun to watch,1407888000,,26,3.3333333333333335
6247222,5,B00I211L48,"It's both, dished up with style by the Norwegians. Am I wrong, or do the Scandinavians have a knack for taking us out of the same ole horror recipe, and delivering something where the police, forensics, and physicians are involved, besides a father of a victim who just won't give up on his daughter, who is in a pitiful condition. There aren't any malformed degenerates, no zombies(thank God) running around killing and devouring.
I won't go any further. It would really spoil the plot of this terrific movie.",1397692800,12,510,4.806818181818182

6247226,3,B00I211L48,"*** 3 Stars ***  A dark, disturbing and carefully paced flick that feels a lot like a low-budget '80s horror movie - if it was made by a bunch of crazed Norwegians on acid.  I mean, this is about as odd as it gets - but it's weirdly entertaining if you don't mind, well, people being attacked by power drill-wielding psychopaths (or are they alien zombies?)  And only in a European flick would the fearless hero (and I do mean fearless) be an overweight, middle-aged music teacher.  There are some pretty young women here - well, pretty before they start spewing toxic black vomit.  If you're feeling adventurous (and that means you won't post vicious reviews because you expected something a bit more mainstream), give it a watch.",1469232000,,731,4.6796875

6247233,2,B00I211L48,"This film from Norway is too weird to be interesting. A woman jogs through the woods and is attacked by a guy with a cordless power-drill. Her body rises in the morgue and she makes her way home. Her dad sees her covered in mud sitting at her computer and she says nothing and he just takes that as normal. Later in the night he wakes to find her still at her computer where she's typed ""Help"" over and over and over again.

Another woman is attacked. She also re-animates in the hospital.

Somehow the father is able to track down who's turned his daughter into a zombie. Guys in orange overalls are going around drilling holes in girl's heads and filling them with some black ooze.

Later on it turns out that the zombies can make other people zombies by vomiting the black ooze over them.

This film is too strange and has no point.",1454112000,2,835,4.333333333333333

6247244,3,B00I211L48,The movie is actually not bad a bit too long as it never really builds to any sort of explanation as to who was behind all the mayhem. The actors were not bad but the writing was weak causing you not to have any remorse for the characters causing the film to drag on. Great B-movie horror if your looking to be just entertained but don't get too excited if your a real horror fan.,1446681600,,380,4.08
6247245,4,B00I211L48,"Man, when the movie is a horror film with subtitles and you still scream, you know it has to be good!  This one got me.

6247250,4,B00I211L48,"A horror movie with good pacing, good acting and very suspenseful. You definitely get your money's worth. It has flaws but surprising good for a foreign film. Not gory violence so not for the teenagers and early 20's. The leading character is a middle aged father on the pudgy side so not Hollywoodish.
I would like to see a sequel to clean up the flaws and this could be a great movie. Love the 6 hour work week references in the film.
Flaws: Vaque exposition, parts of film not credible(nurse walks into totally dark room without turning on lights, mass slaughter in one area of town without police)",1446163200,,601,4.574074074074074

Horror fans, and those who aren't afraid to read subtitles will enjoy this film. Its arthouse-ish and interesting. One reviewer complained about movies needing a beginning and an end and that makes me laugh out loud! So many big budget films these days can't come up with an ending no matter how much cash they splash, and horror films have always been ""outside the box"" in every way, so to say this film wasn't good for those reasons is perfectly ludicrous. Four stars because it was unclear wether the digitalizing of some shots was due to internet connection or just (intentionally?) poor cinematography. Overall, I say watch this film if you are a fan of the genre, and give it more than the 5 minutes other poor reviewers gave it..",1427241600,,839,4.6375838926174495

It is somewhat slow moving at points, but the twisted last 20 minutes of the film made the entire movie tie together in an unexpected turn. At times somewhat comical near the end, it still delivers. I prefer to watch European horror style films so I have no complaints about the subtitles. The acting of the father is very realistic of what a man caught in his situation would do and his actions are also very realistic.

Very nice. Morbid plot, unforgettable horror images. Well acted. I found the protagonist especially sympathetic, the way he cares for his infected daughter at home, even though it's clear her case is hopeless. It's not realistic, there's no logic to it, it's just an expressionistic exploration of a creepy feeling made manifest.

When his daughter is attacked by a drill-wielding maniac, and the police seem unable to help, a father sets out to discover who and what this attacker is.  As the film progresses, the stranger things become and you are soon in the middle of an almost alien conspiracy.  While the gore exists, it is not over-the-top and there is no nudity or gratuitous sex.  The movie is well-acted and steady-paced.  If you are looking for a hack-and-slash, or zombie movie, you will probably be disappointed, as will those who need a nice, neat explanation for what is happening.
