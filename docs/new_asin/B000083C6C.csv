The stunning array of formations displayed in this video is astounding, staggering, and overwhelming in its implications, which the narration and interviews with researchers attempts to articulate. Are Crop Circles the imprint of the manifestations in our Reality of ""otherly dimensioned"" beings?  Do they signal the beginning of the end of an Era?

This video is a compelling argument for the existence of intelligent energies or beings or whatever-they-are communicating to those few who actually pay attention.

Two problems: one is that the audio is not sychronized with the video, a major malfunction; and second, that two of the commentators spin a christian theological interpretation into the meaning of these iconographic marvels. In that sense, Crop Circles, for all their sublime geometric order, can be sort of a Rorschach test for the true believer.
