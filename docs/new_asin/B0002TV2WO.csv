2120202,1,B0002TV2WO,"I was very disappointed in this boxed set. The movies, of course, are great but this boxed set was a big rip off. The only reason I didn't return it was because I promised someone my original copies of the first two movies. I already own the first two Harry Potter movies in their beautiful cardboard slipcovers. I was expecting this boxed set to have some continuity. Instead all they did was put the third movie (in a plastic case!) in a fancy box with the first two movies in their original (cardboard!) packaging. If you already own the first two movies do not waste your money buying this set. Just buy the third movie. You can always find your own box to put them in. If you want a boxed set, wait five or six years until all of the movies are released and buy it then. Maybe the packaging will be better. Yes Wolf, the third movie is in a plastic slip case not the nicer cardboard slipcase.",1101600000,164,897,4.2823529411764705

Or is it like the first two movies,Cardboard Case.

I would appreciate a reply,thank you in advance.

2120204,2,B0002TV2WO,"Boy do DVD release companies know what they are doing... In stores today we have releases of movies, with a remake of it in the theaters, out on the front shelves (examples I have seen the past few months: Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Grudge, The Stepford Wives, there are more...), and a movie released twice, one a few months after the other but now with ""bonus footage"" and labeled ""Unrated Version."" (Some examples: Daredevil, Underworld, Gothika, Wild Things, there are more...) Now, we have this: A nice looking box set of the first three Harry Potter films. All three films are AMAZING but DO NOT buy this! Anyone who knows the story behind these films, knows that there are going to be alteast 3 more, if not more films, one that is being filmed right now (as of November 24, 2004). I can guarantee you that when the fourth Harry Potter movie comes out on DVD, there will be another box set, only it will have the first FOUR films. This will be a continuing pattern until the end. This process isn't fair to us who have already bought the first two films. Now, we have to decide whether to buy just the third film and miss out on the nice box that encases it and the other two, or buy extra copies of the ones we already have, in order to get this nifty box set. As much as I would like this set, I'm waiting until the end. If I am going to spend good money on a box set (AND duplicates of DVDs I already have), I am going to wait for it to contain EVERY SINGLE FILM. Hopefully people will catch on and stop DVD companies from manipulating consumers. We ARE, after all, the ones who keep them in business. It's not fair for us to have to pay extra money. If you already have one/both of the first two films, don't waste your money on this. Wait for a mega-set with all the movies in it in the coming years. Go buy or rent the newest film by itself. Make a statement. Help stop these greedy DVD companies!",1101168000,36,1912,4.2699724517906334
2120205,5,B0002TV2WO,"In 1997, a children's book written by a then little-known author, J. K. Rowling, began to gain popularity in Britain.  Entitled ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"", the book's title was changed when it was released in the U.S. to ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"".  A year later, children who had been mesmerized by the first book got to read its sequel, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"".  Though a seemingly darker book than the first, more and more children (as well as adults) began to take interest in the amazing stories a boy name Harry Potter, who is also a wizard.  As J. K. Rowling wrote each additional book, interest continued to rise as bookstores began to open at midnight upon each book's release date to the throngs of children and their parents anxious to read the next installment of Harry Potter's adventures at the magical Hogwart's School of Wizardry Witchcraft with his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger as they battle the evil Lord Voldemort.  To date, five books have been written.  The third, fourth and fifth books are respectively entitled ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" and ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix"".

With so much popularity, it was only natural that film producers would approach J. K. Rowling about transforming her wonderful books into big-screen films.  The year following the release of her fourth book, the film adaptation of her first book, ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" was released in theaters in 2001.  The following year, the second film based upon the second book, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" was released.  Most recently, the third film based upon the third book, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", was released in theaters in 2004.  Finally, with the soon-to-be-released third film on DVD, all three films can be purchased together in a wonderful DVD set, ""Harry Potter - Years 1-3 DVD Collection"".

Starring Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, each of the three films is quite good.  Also starring in all three films are Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon Dursley, Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia Dursley, Harry Melling as cousin Dudley Dursley, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid and legendary actress Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall.  Sadly, the brilliant actor Richard Harris (1930-2002), who played Professor Albus Dumbledore, died shortly before the second film opened in theaters.  Stepping into the character in the third film was veteran actor Michael Gambon, whose seamless & identical portrayal of Professor Dumbledore was a true credit to his excellent acting abilities.

Overall, I rate all three films together with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend them.  In case you have a friend or family member that wants to watch/own all three Harry Potter films, but doesn't yet have any of them, the ""Harry Potter - Years 1-3 DVD Collection"" would make an excellent gift.",1101081600,22,3100,5.0234375

A review of each of the films appears below but I feel called to add something. For technical excellence, I would give each of them 5 stars. As far as MY OWN enjoyment goes, I rank them 5, 4 and 3 stars for the first second and third films.

HARRY POTTER AND THE SOCERER""S STONE - An Excellent Adaptation

Adapting a book for a film necessarily requires some adaptations and changes. These are usually for the worse. This film is an exception. Compromises have been made but it has been splendidly done. Most of the story from the book has been carried over and the work has been done in a creditable fashion. This is particularly nice in that a fantasy film is particularly difficult in this regard.

The story is of a young man who is unaware that he was born a wizard. After the death of his parents, he was raised by relatives who detest him and have tried to keep him from learning about his heritage or even knowing that there is any such thing as magic. The magic community has not forgotten him, however. The young man has a past and famous parents. He is also the only person ever to have survived a fight with ""he who must not be named"". He did this at the age of 2. Now, he has been accepted at an academy for wizards. His eyes are opened to numerous possibilities and soon he is involved in solving a mystery. Things are not all as they seem at the Hogwarts Academy. Foul things are happening and young Harry Potter is determined to figure them out. That in itself constitutes an education.

This is an extremely entertaining film for kids of all ages. It is well done and will appeal on different levels to people of all ages.

HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Good, But Not As Good

This, the second Harry Potter, manages to reclaim the technical excellence of the first but is not quite up to the same standard. Part of this is because more of the book is left out than was the case with the first film. Partly, this is because of necessity. You can almost never do a complete book adaptation. Something always gets lost. The first was notable for how well it succeeded in this respect. The second does well also, it just doesn't do quite as well. I suppose the other reason is that I just loathe snakes.

This story involves snakes. Especially, it involves a basilisk, the king of serpents, whose gaze can kill. This beast has as its mission to kill all those not of pure blood in the magical Hogwarts academy. This goes on as Lord Valdemort, the evil wizard, makes another bid to come back and achieve power. It is Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione who can put a stop to all the nonsense.

The magical effects are wonderful. So too is much of the cheeky repartee. While this one can be suitable to people of all ages, some of it may be a bit intense for the youngest of viewers. It is also contraindicated if you despise snakes. I do, but managed to enjoy the film anyway.

HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKEBAN - A Needless Letdown

I was disappointed with this film but my reasons differ somewhat from those given by other reviewers. This one still has the technical excellence of the first two in terms of effects and production values. It also does a fair job of following the book although there are elements that have to be cut in any such adaptation. It is certainly a darker episode than the first two but so was the book. My complaint is different. The new director needlessly made changes that didn't have to be made.

Some of the changes involve sets. The feel of the story is different. There is no real story telling reason for the change; it seems the changes were made for their own sake.

Other changes that seem to be made for their own sake do involve the story line. Nothing was accomplished by the changes. They don't seem to have added to the story and, I must admit, they don't really detract all that much. They are just different without having to be. It is almost as if the book was not good enough. That is a far cry from a book being too difficult to film.

The story involves Harry's 3rd year at the Hogwarts Academy for wizards. Once again, skullduggery is afoot and Harry and his friends are intent on straightening things out. This time, a fearsome wizard has escaped from prison and it is common knowledge that the wizard wants Harry dead. His being Harry's Godfather makes the tale more convoluted and the twists and turns really start occurring when many of the characters are not who they seem to be.

It's a good movie adaptation of a book but it is not in the same league as the others.",1133308800,5,4799,4.358342665173573

2120238,3,B0002TV2WO,"This review refers to the 6-Disc boxed set.  I was disappointed to find out that literally all this is is the original three movies combined and put into a box with some Harry Potter scenes on the outside of it.  I didn't expect them to actually create new DVDs, however they could have at least done something new with the packaging to enhance it.  The first two movies are in cardboard DVD cases, and the third is in a regular plastic DVD case, which looks wierd.  Also, after some use the cardboard cases fell apart.  The glue that held the clear plastic piece that actually holds the DVD came off and the plastic piece fell off on both of the first two movies. I had to tape it back on.

I gave it three stars because the movies are great, but the collection is poorly done and a waste of money. At least they could have thrown in a 10 page pamphlet or something to go along with it.  I would wait until a few more movies come out and someone does a better box set.

2120245,5,B0002TV2WO,"I finally took a gander at the Harry Potter films. Actually they are quite good. Intriguing to watch and although not much originality, but fun to watch. While I was watching I kept recalling other movies where I have seen that paticular scene in. But not to worry since these films are mainly based for children and younger teens, so there is slight damage to the film as it holds some childish but cute characters. Harry Potter and the sorcerer stone was not as good as the other 2, although the ending was about the best scene as far as its originality. Excellent acting and the visual effects is ok. The story really captures my attention mainly. My advice to you Harry Potter fans, If you have read the books first, Read the books again, they are far better then these films. If you have fans that are children, yes I encourage you to buy this collection, a great gift for your child that broadens their minds into the realm of folklore and fantasy, as well as mythological creatures.

2120249,3,B0002TV2WO,"J.K. Rowling did a wonderful thing when she wrote Harry Potter.  Normally, film studios wait until AFTER the entire series is over to make a film of it.  However, due to the HP hype, film studios wanted to make money off the popularity the BOOKS were gaining.  This caused them to rashly start filming the movies as the books are still being written.  The evident effect of this caused the films to lose the book's touch and present only half of the entire fascinating story that Harry Potter actually goes through.  The only way the movies could have been as good as the books was if there were done exactly sentence by sentence from the books because the books are THAT good.  These three movies do not live up to the books and area failure to reimagine Rowling's wizarding world.  Those executive ""wizards"" down at Warner Brothers Studios are nothing more than greedy, unappreciative Muggles.",1122595200,,895,4.735483870967742

2120253,2,B0002TV2WO,"I truly love the Harry Potter series.  My wife and I devoured the first five books and we take a day off from work to see the movies on opening day.  For Christmas, my wife got me the ""First 3 years"" DVD box set.  As we were watching each movie, but especially the third, we kept getting the feeling that something was missing.  At first I thought I was losing my mind, but, from some clues in the Prisoner of Azkaban, we figured out that certain scenes- some particularly pivotal- have been left off the box set.  Never mind the cardboard vs. plastic casing, leaving scenes out from the theatrical run is the antithesis of a DVD release where, allegedly, more scenes should be added.

The omitted scenes I know for certain are:

1. Sir Nicholas's party.  In the DVD, there is a scene of ghostly knights charging through The Great Hall, but with no follow-up scene(s) to explain this action.  What should come next, which was part of the theatrical release but was deleted for this box set, was a scene showing the knights entering Sir Nicholas's death-day party.  Then, there are more scenes of Harry, Ron, and Hermione at the party, the only ""mortals"" to attend.  They are baffled by some of the strange food and depressed by the atmosphere, so they decide to leave.  Sir Nicholas thanks them personally for coming on their way out.  I can distinctly see in my mind's eye John Cleese making some kind of feeble toast and then later on dejectedly bidding farwell to the Hogwarts kids.

2. There are some black and white flashback scenes of Harry's parents (at least his dad, from what I recall) poking fun at an obviously loner-type Snape, during their days as students at Hogwarts.  This scene explains much of the animosity Snape has for Harry.  At least one other main character (Sirius Black, I think, or maybe Lupin) appears in these flashback scenes.  Again, I vividly remember the black and white look of these scenes, and the students (Harry's parents, etc.) sitting beneath a  tree.  These scenes are so crucial!  Why would the filmmakers omit them?!

I'm really disappointed in the choice to omit these scenes.  While the Sir Nicholas scenes aren't integral to the plot, it doesn't make sense to leave them off the DVD box set.  And certainly, cutting the flashback scenes of Harry's parents on the DVD box set is just inexcusable, particularly considering the extra freedoms available with DVD releases.

What were they thinking?

Has anyone else noticed this?  Please let me know in your review.  Thanks so much.",1105142400,32,2525,4.705479452054795
2120254,2,B0002TV2WO,"I understand that the box set happens to have two cardboard cases( years 1 and 2) and one plastic case (year 3).

My question is if it's the ""WIDESCREEN"" set why is year three the ""fullscreen"" version?  Was it mispackaged?  Has anyone else encountered this problem?",1104364800,14,265,4.717391304347826
2120255,5,B0002TV2WO,"Although the books are much more imaginative, the Harry Potter films are a treat.  Beautifully filmed in old creepy English schools, playfully acted by a host of British veteran stars like Maggie Smith and other BBC movie regulars, this film collection is delightful to watch with the family.  You don't have to be 13 to enjoy it.",1104019200,4,330,4.771929824561403
2120256,4,B0002TV2WO,"I, like anyone else who watches these movies, am a huge Harry Potter.  I love all the books (currently reading Book #5)  and the movies are fairly good, but we all know you can never beat the book.

Movie #1 - alright.  I'd give it 4/5 stars.  i enjoyed it but the acting wasn't all that great, but we're talking about 11 year olds, so its not entirely their fault.

overall really good.

Movie #2 - The best of the 3 movies so far.  Acting has greatly improved.  my family really loved the character, Dobby, and we really enjoyed the Qudditch scene.  A lot more dramatic that the book.  Excellecent movie.  5/5 stars

Movie #3 - Not bad.  Better than the first movie, but noticeably shorter than the previous movies.  Only about 2 hours while the other movies were about 2 and a half hours.  Still enjoyable.  4/5

Great movies, so far.  Hopefully ""the goblet of fire"" and ""the order of the pheonix"" will not be as short as the 3rd movie.  I don't think you can take 730 pages and jam them into only 2 hours.  Can't wait for those movies",1102723200,8,1038,4.302083333333333
2120257,5,B0002TV2WO,Ok I am 25 and I admit a huge Harry Potter Fan.  Each movie is in its own package just like if you had bought them seperately.  The year 3 is in a plastic case unlike the first 2 which were in cardboard. I did buy this box set mostly due to my year 1 and 2 were given to my 10 year old brother so I needed to buy them again.  The Navy Exchange is horribly small here and I actually got the collection before my store even had them in.  Plus it puts all the movies into 1 nice collection.  Being that this is the first box set to be offered and knowing that more movies are coming I am thinking that years 4-6 will have a box set of their own untill they are put together.  But being as the Star Wars movies never had a whole collection that is just my assumption.  The movies are getting better and better.  I only recommend buying this if 1> you are a collector or 2>like me don't have the first two for 1 reason or another.,1101859200,21,925,3.909090909090909
