7022657,5,B00TULHKTE,"Love this show!  Too bad it was only 4 seasons.  It was excellent, couldn't help but watch it pretty much straight through.  The ending was not what i expected, but it was an excellent ending!  True and hilarious show and at times very sad as well, and it also really made you think about some things in another light.  Awesome!",1446508800,,328,4.4
7022658,3,B00TULHKTE,"It would depend on what you have come to expect from Wilfred as to if this final season will satisfy your expectation. It is not as free as the first couple of seasons with humor and episodes that don't necessarily apply to the deeper questions of Wilfred like who is Wilfred, Is this all in Ryan's head, etc...  It sticks pretty much to the point of unveiling most aspects of these questions and for some, the revealing of these answers may be a shock especially ones that aren't as big as the ones I listed before. This is not too say there is no humor but with the short amount of episodes and being the final season it seems to stick more on revealing the answers. As most endings to a show, things are wrapped up with characters such as future and what happens with them. Overall it was solid and if your looking for the answers and want to know what happens with the characters I recommend it. For me I found it quite short and rushed to unfold everything and caused it to miss out on some of its humor that it was well known for in its first couple of seasons.",1441843200,,1067,4.230392156862745
7022659,4,B00TULHKTE,"I must say that I 100% loved Wilfred in both the US and Australian versions, but the final season of the US series (especially the last few episodes) were a little off-putting.  Without giving away the ending, I sort of expected what Wilfred was to Ryan, but I was disappointed by the way it played out in the final episodes (even though it was still well acted by both leads).  In a way, the final episodes felt rushed and certain things done just for shock value to take away from the sense of it being rushed.  I will still re-watch the series, I may just skip past the final 3 episodes.",1436659200,,590,4.297297297297297
7022660,5,B00TULHKTE,"Where are the reviews for this?? An absolutely brilliant end to a brilliant show. SPOILER: I mean, anybody who thought it was really anything more then a mentally disturbed person hanging out and smoking weed with his dog was probably disappointed. But the show is about much more than that, obviously. For many of us, maybe suffering from some of the same problems that Ryan had, the show hit deep. A treasure.",1436313600,5,411,4.722222222222222

8703163,5,B00TULHKTE,"This was a great series, I kind of wished they would have done another season or two, but I can see why they ended it where and when they did, the final few episodes did keep you guessing, but in the end it was clear who and what Wilfred was to Ryan.",1459382400,,250,3.826923076923077
