7565701,4,B0199VU6KY,"London Spy (2015-tv). 5 episodes. Running Time: 4 hours, 48 mins.
Directed by Jakob Verbruggen. Written by  Tom Rob Smith.

Originally broadcast on BBC 2 and then BBC America in 2 months later.

In London, Danny (Ben Whishaw) tries to contact some one on his cell phone. He can't reach them, so in anger he throws his phone down and it breaks. A man (Edward Holcroft) is jogging along and stops to help him with the pieces of his phone and asks if he is okay.
  A couple days later, Danny wants to see him again so he waits at the same place. His hunch was right. Danny talks to him, but the jogger doesn't say much of anything. They go to his apartment. His name is Joe. As he takes a shower, Danny looks at his tidy and clean apartment. Danny sneaks on his laptop computer and turns it on. It looks like a bunch of secret formulas. Danny hears the door close and he quickly shuts off the laptop. Joe works in security. They go out to eat together.
  Danny confides into an old gentleman friend, Scottie (Jim Broadbent), whom is a former spy. He tells him about the mysterious jogger he met and wants to know him better.
  One morning, a couple days later, Joe knocks on the door of Danny's apartment, however, Danny never told him where he lives.  They go out to the beach and Danny questions him. The jogger says his real name is Alex. Later that night, they finally make love and a relationship begins.
  Eight months goes by and Danny allows Alex to meet Scottie in the club where Danny met Scottie years ago. Alex has never seen Scottie before.
  One day, Danny suggests that him and Alex go on a weekend trip.  Alex turns up the radio and says he has to get a new battery for the laptop before they leave.  When Danny returns to Alex's apartment for the trip, he is not there. As the 11 days goes by, there are no messages from Alex.  Danny goes back to Scottie for comfort, but the old man is being cantankerous. He tells Danny that he will get over it, but he can't hear anymore of it because he has something personal to take care of. Then in anger, Scottie asks Danny if he ever thought about what him Scottie wanted. Danny didn't realize that Scottie might be interested in him. Danny sort of strips in front of him saying is this what you want?
  At work in the warehouse alone, Danny receives a package. Inside is a key. The key is to Alex's apartment. He goes to Alex's apartment and with the key to unlock the door. He enters inside.
  You will have to watch the rest of this to find out what happens.

Also in the cast: Samantha Spiro, Charlotte Rampling, Adrian Lester.

While the story concerns gay characters, it is not a ""gay"" movie, could be anyone. Makes one really think about society and what is happening in the world.

7565704,5,B0199VU6KY,"My sister recommended this and I put off watching it because of the title - I don't usually like spy thrillers.

I don't like Ben Whishaw much either, but this pulled me in immediately.  The love story is convincing, as is the acting of Whishaw and Jim Broadbent as his improbable older friend.  The romanticism of Danny comes across as convincing rather than sappy, and provides the fuel for his improbable pursuit of ""the truth.""  I agree with others who found the ending unsatisfying or even ludicrous, but the idea that Alex's research was about detecting lies is at the center of the search and of Alex's fate.

I asked my sister why this series didn't get more press (I hadn't heard of it) or showing on PBS, and she said ""probably too gay.""  I think she's right, and it's unfortunate.  I'd recommend this to anyone who is reluctant to watch movies about gay relationships.  The ones here are realistic, intense, and to me, as a straight woman, utterly convincing and compelling.  The relationships in this series are what makes it worth watching.",1503446400,,1053,4.7103825136612025
7565705,5,B0199VU6KY,"Unbelievable.  Loved this.  Ordered another & gave as a gift.  Very thankful & surprised this is a series & not another cheap, cheesy gay film.",1501891200,,143,4.64

7565707,2,B0199VU6KY,"Lackluster plot or lost the plot? Whereas I adore Jim Broadbent and Charlotte Rampling and am not a big fan of Wishlaw, they are somewhat lost in this movie. Hugely disappointing film. Expected something aspiring to the level of the masterful John le Carre adaptations...not this movie sadly. How many times can Ben Whishaw cry his eyes out sitting on the side of the river Thames? Sorry prefer not to write reviews when I don't have anything good to say and with this series it is a challenge...",1500595200,,496,4.6477272727272725
7565708,5,B0199VU6KY,"I did not read any reviews until I finally got around to posting mine.  I particularly liked the review from the man who said he had to shut it off after just nine minutes.  He doesn't go into detail as to why but if you've seen episode one, it is pretty clear what his problem was:  a homosexual scene.  It truly amazed me how many reviewers just came out and said it.  If it had been two Victoria's Secret models they would have signed a petition to force Amazon to allow them to give the mini series ten stars!

It can be a little uncomfortable for some (me included) but I tend to get uncomfortable about a lot of things portrayed in movies and television.  Slavery, spousal abuse, war, child neglect and on and on make me uncomfortable.  I can name dozens of movies I have felt uncomfortable with that I felt were truly great successes.

I originally caught two episodes of this on BBC America.  I tried to find another airing and there were none.  I ended up buying this and getting to see all of the episodes in order.  I really enjoyed it.  I loved Ben Whishaw in the last two Bond movies.  In this mini series, he has the lead.  He pulls it off well.  The rest of the cast was also exceptional.  It kept my interest from beginning to (almost) the end.

If I have one negative comment, it would be that the writers had some difficulty in bringing the story to a close.  I am guessing there was a lot more material that could have added several more episodes.  It got a little disjointed towards the end before it came to the end.  This was mentioned by many reviewers and I couldn't agree more.  What I don't agree with is praising the actors and the cinematography and then giving it one star.

In my opinion, it is still worthy of five stars even with the somewhat convoluted ending.",1499904000,3,1793,4.318318318318318

7565710,1,B0199VU6KY,"Unfortunately, the 2nd disc would not work at all.  There was no apparent damage to the disk - so it must be shoddy manufacturing.  I watched the first 3 full episodes in full binge mode.  When I went to watch the last 2 eps, Disc #2  wouldn't work at all.  It wasn't recognized by my devices as a dvd.  Amazon sent a replacement & the same thing happened with Dfisc#2.  So there's some very poor manufacturing & apparently no quality control at the factory.

All that said, I enjoyed the first 3 episodes & my binge was halted by technical failure.",1496793600,,549,4.366336633663367

7565727,1,B0199VU6KY,"There's 5 hours of my life I'll never get back, and I still can't believe I watched every episode.  I kept waiting for something, anything to happen.  Kept waiting for the ""Spy"" part of the story to make an appearance; other than the fact that Alex worked for MI-6 and was a genius who figured something out (we never really know quite what) and that, as Jim Broadbent's character says, ""Everybody is against you"" there is no spy story here.  The plot is ludicrous and unbelievable.  The direction leans toward slow, meandering extended shots of walking on beaches and other  meaningless interludes.  I learned to recognize when these shots came up and fast forwarded through them.  There are constant 'set-up' scenes that either lead nowhere or finally expose themselves so much later in the show so to lead a viewer to ask ""Why?""  I kept saying to myself ""Ok, something is about to happen"" only to be repeatedly disappointed and frustrated.  Still kicking myself for not realizing that there is nothing worthwhile in London Spy.",1484438400,,1030,4.84

See if you can follow the mumble-jumble of the crotchety professor and if you can understand Danny's sudden insight into his own imagined culpability.

7565757,4,B0199VU6KY,"I'm a bit mystified by all the complaints about the ""ludicrous"" plot. One reviewer says the conspiracy involves 9/11 but that isn't true at all. Alex comes up with a formula or invention based on research that includes study of 9/11 but that's as far as the connection goes. Given the nature of the invention (which I won't divulge here), it would only be natural that lots of governments would be interested/involved. Those things might be far-reaching, but they weren't the problem for me. The only serious problem in the whole series is why the conspirators don't just kill Danny. Alex is far more important and well known, as is another character who is killed. If the bad guys can kill those people (and presumably even more), why not kill Danny? He's a complete nobody. No one would even miss him, much less call for an investigation. So all the truly elaborate ways the bad guys conspire to discredit him seem like a lot of work for little payoff. It would be easier to have him killed in a mugging. One character claims ""You're only still here because you're more trouble dead than alive,"" which is patently ridiculous. So the far-reaching conspiracy connecting several governments didn't bother me, but not killing Danny did. Of course, Ben Wishaw as Danny is the whole reason this series is worth watching to begin with. He's extraordinary.",1474848000,,1350,4.798283261802575

7565774,5,B0199VU6KY,"Just finished watching ""London Spy"" released by the BBC.
WARNING - At times ""London Spy"" is quite graphic in portraying sex and violence, and there is foul language spoken at regular intervals - so if you're easily offended, it's best that you pass this review, along with the series by.
""London Spy"" is an engrossing tale of love forcibly stolen away by multiple spy agencies who are desperate to a computer software program capable of determining when people are lying out of anyone's hands.  Yet is is the story of Danny, a romantic ex-party boy who finds an unexpected romance with Alex - who says he's an investment banker.  Both of these two diametrically opposed young men in London seem unlikely to fall in love, but they do because both are lonely in their own way.  Yet near the end of episode one, Alex is brutally murdered and the suspicion falls on Danny.  In order to prove his innocence, Danny must unravel the lies that is being spun to discredit him and Alex against a vast conspiracy of global spies who are intent on burying Alex's breakthrough discovery.
""London Spy"" is a tense Hitchockian thriller, that leaves the door open for a second season where Danny finds an unlikely ally in his quest to reveal to the world the truth of what happened to him and Alex in the last minute of the last episode.
Here's hoping for an equally tense and brilliant second season.
Strongly Recommended!

What is not stated openly (political correctness once again) is that this film is primarily about a male homosexual love affair, which might be objectionable for some viewers such as myself.. The espionage part of the film (which is why I made the mistake of buying it) is secondary and exceedingly vague. Near the end we find Alex, supposedly dead, to be locked in a trunk and held by the MI6 British spy agency for seemingly unknown reasons besides his alleged genius. Nor do we even learn what finally happens to Alex himself. Even stranger, at the film's very end Alex's lover, Danny drives off with Alex's mother to an unknown destination.

7565807,4,B0199VU6KY,"London Spy is a delicious mini-series that starts strongly but stumbles in it's finale. It's a shame too. Ben Whishaw (Danny) delivers a haunting performance as a man, longing for love, falling in love quickly, only to lose it under circumstances of ill-repute. Danny is neither extremely intelligent or wealthy. He is an average Joe who has made his fair share of mistakes - many that he still regrets. Yet, when he loses the love of his life, he is determined to find answers - at almost any cost. Between sheer will  power and what one character refers to as a 'female sense of intuition,' he finds his answers.
London Spy twists and turns in an elaborate spy thriller that is at times captivating and at times curious. Some character's purpose are presented clearly; others are more than a little murky. And while the main story line is wrapped up, some of what was presented is not. I watched each episode waiting impatiently for the next one. When all was said it done I had to admit that I loved this .. almost. I almost loved this one.",1466121600,,1043,4.547872340425532

A warning to Americans (which I am one): This is not a action/shoot-em-up that usually comes out of Hollywood. This is a psychological mystery. We only know what Danny knows. It is a well crafted British drama told slowly and hauntingly. In a lessor actor's hands it would be nothing. In Whislaw's hands it is a jewel.,1465689600,,402,4.676056338028169

I wish British tv series creators would come over to the US - land of cookie cutter criminal-murder series(think NCIS, and CSI of every major city in the US!)- and give our tv writers a lesson or two. In the US, if a new series is a success- they make 10 more with the same premise, change the city(CSI Miami, New Orleans...)- and each spin off gets a little more cheesy. London Spy is an excellently acted and shot murder/mystery that has a bit of everything-intrigue, romance, espinoige. It's original storyline will have you crying, swearing, and rooting for our protagonist every step of the way while he attempts to solve the murder of the man he loves but apparently knows nothing about.",1465516800,,756,4.607407407407408

As another reviewer already stated, if you're looking for a spy/espionage thriller, this is not it.  Lots of dialogue that goes nowhere and stifled characters that go off on the sexual tangents, but leads the viewers unsatisfied.  I drugged through the 5 episodes waiting for the lead character to get killed, actually.  That would have been a more plausible plot than the one they delivered.  Ben Whishaw really exposes himself as actor in a never-before performance and Jim Broadbent delivers an award-winning performance.  Charlotte Rampling does the same stoic delivery that she's done in a hundred other film/tv performances - nothing new here.  As I watched the bonus material, the whole crew - director, photographer, actors, and set designer were very excited about working on the project.  That's good - because they got paid.

Stretched to fill five episodes with lots of long long long camera shots focused on nothing happening. If Ben Wishaw was not such an engaging actor the nonsensical plot would not have been so palatable. It tends to be in hindsight that one starts to see how ridiculous the plot gets- it just doesn't make any sense once all the pieces are laid out. And though it kind of winds up the loose ends of the plot, the story has no resolution. I assume it is supposed to have a second season - though those final moments seemed almost farcical- seemed like almost an entirely different tone of film being proposed if it proceeds (and without mentioning details, those moments are oddly callous). Often pretty to look at. Disappointing overall.",1464566400,2,890,4.67515923566879
7565822,5,B0199VU6KY,"Very well written and acted.  The plot is intricate and requires attention - a thinking person's movie.  I think this is one I can watch over and over.  Ben Whishaw is excellent in his role as Danny, trying to solve the mystery surrounding his partner.  One thing I never figured out, though, is whether or not he works or has any kind of career.  But that doesn't detract from the story.  And Charlotte Rampling as Whishaw's partner's mother is well cast and just haughty enough for the viewer to have to think about whether or not she is likable or has any redeeming qualities.  And though the film is about gay characters and, to an extent, their relationship, it is ultimately a well-written spy mystery.",1464566400,,708,4.616

7565824,2,B0199VU6KY,"To paraphrase Dorothy Parker, theres less to  London Spy than meets the eye.

The first problem I had with this miniseries was the word Spy in its title, for if you're looking for an espionage yarn dealing with international intrigue (as I was), this sure aint it. It is instead a long winded and tiresome exercise in political paranoia. Its for people who believe in chem trails. If you take this BBC series seriously, MI-6 is the new SPECTRE. Some of the claims made here are quite outlandish, such as suggesting that folks in British Intelligence would purposely infect a pesky witness with the HIV virus in order to simply discredit him. Or that they would  do away with a recalcitrant employee by stifling him slowly inside a storage trunk. If they're really that ruthless, why not just push the poor sap in front of oncoming traffic or maybe go for the old Bulgarian walking-stick-with-a-poisoned-tip routine? Oh, well, I guess those kinds of solutions are not evil enough for the series disgruntled creators.

The second problem I had was with its central love story which serves as the launching pad for the plot. As unlikely a pairing since Oscar and Felix, it may cater to the more romantic souls among its viewers, but the reality is that there is no way someone like Alex would have anything to do with someone like Dan, beyond a disastrous one nighter, particularly in class conscious England.

You cannot blame the gifted cast who bravely carry on in the best British Acting Tradition, but the script is full of over the top set pieces that seem to be there for their own sake. Characters keep showing up with the promise of providing answers or clues, but nothing ever comes of it. Phoney portent and lots of hot air in Orwellian overkill is all we get. The director doesnt help matters by  training his camera on characters nostrils and the moles on their shoulders as they're holding secret conversations about supposedly life threatening issues. There are numerous buildups that go nowhere, probably to distract the viewers from the myriad of plot holes. Lots of symbolic cliches abound, however, for those in the audience of an impressionable age (a dying young man in fetal position trapped inside an antique trunk while his adoptive and duplicitous mother tries to talk some sense into him through the sealed lid). Poor momma hasn't faired so well since the Lansbury monster in the original Manchurian Candidate. Plus the whole 5 hours could have been told in less than 2.

I sat through the whole thing in fear that the final revelation would turn out to be much ado about nothing - and it was.

The final problem for me (and an insult to anyones intelligence) is its cop-out ending. Yes, after 5 hours of unrelenting pessimism, a forced Happy Ending (!), when any third grader knows that the Rampling character would never have such a sudden change of heart simply because it is not in her DNA.

On the plus side the production values are outstanding and the DVD set comes in 2 disks with subtitles in English and the usual self-laudatory bonus footage.

Give me Deighton and Le Carre any day. Yes, they're old hat, but at least their post war disillusionment with The System was understandable, and their plots were rooted in Cold War reality and not in New Age hysteria.",1464393600,8,3295,4.734729493891797
7565825,5,B0199VU6KY,"File this under things you'd never see on American television.  A hot, rather explicit affair between two men treated as would be any straight affair.  But there's so much more and by the end of the first episode you can't help but watch another.  And at the end of the 5th episode, you can't believe that there are no more.  It's a very methodically paced show, so if you're thinking from the Spy in the title that there are a lot of James Bond-esque scenes, you won't find them here.  The action is all mental and emotional and it's all shot beautifully.  And although it sounds cliche, it will keep you guessing until the end.",1464220800,2,629,4.426086956521739

7565827,2,B0199VU6KY,"The premise seemed promising but the execution is just ludicrous. The characters are continually required to make absurd choices to move the plot forward and eventually it turns into one big implausible mess. A stranger takes a piece of candy out of his mouth and places it on the ground. The hero picks it up, takes it home and shaves off the sugar to find a pill inside. Why would he do this? Because it's needed to set up the next scene. Every episode is filled with improbable moments like this and nothing about it feels natural or organic.

7565836,5,B0199VU6KY,"BBC has done it again  created a five part miniseries that is a well written, well directed, well photographed, well lighted and exquisitely acted cinematic exploration of a relationship drama refracted through the prism of the spy genre. Written by Tom Rob Smith and directed with great sensitivity by Jakob Verbruggen, this story takes chances on so many levels  the main characters are gay, there is a very sensual depiction of a gay sexual experience, the secret societies of all nations are involved in this tale of espionage, and the story is as much about a mystery as it is about a love relationship that is abruptly cut short, leaving many questions unanswered, and allowing the audience to feel the degrees of grief and conundrum that sudden loss of a loved one brings.

It is interesting how various synopses of this miniseries are interpreted: This is the story of a chance romance between two people from very different worlds, one from the headquarters of the Secret Intelligence Service, the other from a world of clubbing and youthful excess. And the better one, What begins as a chance romance between two people from opposite walks of life - one an antisocial investment banker Alex (Edward Holcroft) the other a slacker romantic Danny (Ben Whishaw) quickly unravels when the reclusive banker disappears under suspicious circumstances, exposing his real identity as a spy and forcing his lover down a dark path to reveal the truth. What these synopses fail to explain is the complexity of the relationship between Danny and Alex, the dependency of Danny on the advice of his only friend Scottie (Jim Broadbent) who recalls the old days in England when being gay was a crime, Dannys discovery of SMBD equipment in Alexs attic where Alex is discovered dead in a trunk, the clues that lead to the police (Samantha Spiro), Alexs strange mother Frances (Charlotte Rampling), a past shared encounter with an escort (Riccardo Scamarcio), and on and on.

To offer more would be spoiling the story  which is very convoluted at times. The first four episodes are brilliant, but things fall apart a bit in the final episode. Bt that does not hamper the brilliance of this excellent miniseries. All of the actors are excellent, but Ben Whishaw continues to demonstrate that he is one of the finest actors on the screen today. Very Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, April 16",1461974400,6,2377,4.917705735660848

7565840,3,B0199VU6KY,"London Spy's first two episodes are gripping, stunningly well acted, and effectively, sometimes beautifully composed and filmed.  It promises a great deal.  But, beginning in the third episode and increasing steadily through the latter two, the plot turns wildly convoluted and improbable.  The series is  as a whole, I suppose, a paranoid's nightmare or conspiracy buffs confirmation of all they've maintained.  But this particular conspiracy (I avoid details to prevent my spoiling anything) is so far ranging, all pervasive, and, in a sense unnecessary (since there are far easier ways to do what it wishes to accomplish) that it becomes ludicrous, absurd, and, after the initial episodes, seriously disappointing.  Given how intricate the plot is, the ending is in its own way oddly predictable and also quite improbable, especially the two smiling faces.

In brief, this series starts out well.  It remains throughout visually arresting and extremely well acted by everyone in it.  The problem is in the script more than in its direction or its realization.  No one should doubt that governmental agencies worldwide are capable of terrible, cruel, malignant, fatal deeds. History and the news make that evident.  In that sense, the film is pointed.  But this particular (and worldwide) conspiracy is so inclusiveMI 5, MI 6, other foreign governmental secret agencies, the Royal Mail, escort services, pharmacies, HIV clinics, possibly several universities, a successful, if louche rock star, one's parents, et ceteraand is so wildly over the top that it surpasses credulity.  A bit mysteriously since the explanation is given so quickly, it also involves 9/11.  It's too much.  The writer would seem to be throwing all he can into the mix just to keep it edgy and alive.  But that's is not the result.  No matter how elaborate a conspiracy might be, it must remain in same way, to the viewer and within the story itself, logical.  London Spy defies logic.

The series is a kind of allegory.  It's theme is the impossibility of there being a world, both governmental and human, in which it can be shown who is lying and who is telling the truth, 'impossible' in the sense that it would be intolerable to those in power or in control.  One character creates a mathematical means to demonstrate, scientifically so to speak, who is lying.  (It is not solely mathematical, but it is through complex equations that it is discovered.)  Since politicians and their like would do anything to prevent being shown to be the liars they are, they must stop it from being put into place, by murder if need be.  That theme is developed, more interestingly perhaps, in how people relate with and speak to  one another as well.  That is where the film is most searching.  It is too bad more was not done with that side of the film, the human side one might say, and less given over to the absurdities of its plotting.

All allegories have a way of getting out of hand.  They lose their grip on reality, whatever one might mean by that tricky word.  That is the problem with London Spy.  The allegory turns preposterous fairly early, and then it never regains its grip on what is plausible.  In other words, the more you question it the more ridiculous it becomes, yet it wants, most earnestly, to be taken seriously indeed.",1461024000,29,3311,4.888689407540395

I'm a total wash out as far as television heads would be defined, today.  Therefore, I'm left to notice how my partner responds to material to find any connection with you, if you're reading this, presently.  Upon her viewing of the first couple of episodes (which I'd already seen, but tried not to reveal,) she was already entrenched with Danny and his story, but ultimately, enthralled with the profoundly moving performance of Jim Broadbent in ""London Spy.""  He was the anchor of this ship, and the 5th episode (I think: Rovicorp has a fun time messing with me) appearance of Adrian Lester to explain in the shortest of terms - binary code, the predictability of human behavior, ""the end of all lies"" - the brilliance of our beloved Aleister...  The entire experience was as close as many viewers will ever come to synthetic opium, or perhaps the real thing.  I would not know that.  This was a great work for such a small screen.  My partner, by the way, experienced the death of one of her own daughters during the short broadcast season of this show.  It says something important, that she came to me one night, after her own tragedy to ask if I had recorded the rest of the episodes (after the second) or would we have to purchase them on Amazon, just to see how one story turned out.

The script is perceptive and penetrating, and the acting by the entire cast just couldn't be better; Ben Whishaw, Jim Broadbent, Charlotte Rampling and the rest of the cast are every bit as good as anyone might expect.  My one reservation is that Verbruggen's direction is unnecessarily flashily ""busy"" at at several points and distracted me from the action.  I also have to note an aspect of the series that no one else has mentioned:  There is no one in a better position than an out gay man to recognize and penetrate the masks used to cover dark secrets.

Not sure if you tried to slip one past us, but why not just say it's about a gay man and his lover; was Amazon trying to make it more broad in its appeal?  Sexuality plays a huge role in the story, and it seems like a relevant strain with very specific appeal.  To wit, I don't quite buy the feminine mystique as Danny's inner strength, and, as his lover's mother asserts, the contributing factor to Danny's ability to see through global espionage network.

7565894,4,B0199VU6KY,"Superbly acted by all characters, but especially Ben Whishaw, Jim Broadbent and Charlotte Rampling. The story begins slowly and meanders, frustratingly at some points, through a somewhat predictable plot: a genius within the security forces has something that they don't want to be exposed. There are several side plots to enable character development and many poignant moments which mimic true stories that have broken in the British papers over the years. Strangely though I felt it difficult to really sympathize with any of the players save Scottie and, as with many stories of this genre, found the inconsistency of Danny's treatment by the security forces, compared to other characters, mildly frustrating.
I started the series with enthusiasm, which held for the first 4 episodes, but the final part left me feeling unsatisfied. I assume this will remain a single series of 5 episodes to retain its integrity as otherwise I could see this rapidly becoming a parody of itself which would be a shame.",1456099200,2,1005,5.134146341463414
7565895,4,B0199VU6KY,"This is a powerful 5-episode miniseries.  Its creator, Tom Rob Smith, describes it (aptly) as a relationship drama refracted through the prism of the spy genre.  The story, in brief: Danny, a young gay man in London meets another young man who seems haunted and lonely.  The mans name is Alex.  They begin a relationship and then, suddenly, Danny finds Alexs nude body forced into a case in Alexs attic.  Alex is dead and his attic is filled with S/M devices (which he and Danny have never used).  Danny learns that Alex was actually Alistair, an MI6 operative and he quickly gets the point that Alexs /Alistairs handlers in the intelligence services are nearly all-powerful and simultaneously without scruple.  They will do anything to protect themselves and their operations; they are prepared to kill and they are prepared to infect meddlers with serious diseases.  Danny is trapped between his personal fears of the dark powers and his desire to find justice for Alex.  He is aided in his investigation by an older, gay, alcoholic, retired operative named Scottie (played brilliantly by Jim Broadbent).  In the course of their investigation Danny discovers that Alex has left behind an encrypted device which contains the results of research which all of the worlds principal intelligence services are seeking to suppress.  Scottie introduces Danny to others who might be able to help them.  In the course of their investigation they encounter characters played by Edward Fox, Harriet Walter andin a pivotal roleCharlotte Rampling.  Mark Gatiss (Mycroft Holmes in the Cumberbatch series) makes an especially upsetting appearance as a self-indulgent, cringe-inducing record producer.

So: very promising and engaging story, with Ben Whishaw at the top of his game as Danny and an estimable supporting cast.  The cinematography is nothing short of brilliant and the atmospherics and dark color palette are unforgettable.  The plot is a bit choppy at points and we are sometimes left with unanswered questions.  The pace (reinforced by a heavy duty score) is very, very slow, not ponderous or dull but very reflective and very ominous.  There are points at which we feel that we may have stepped into a horror film.  There are scenes of torture and interrogation that are nearly unwatchable.  This is a difficult series to endure; at the same time we desperately want to know the results of Danny and Scotties investigation.

While done with great skill, there is political correctness aplenty.  The lessons in victimology extend from the gay community to an ethnic-minority copper and an (always) evil businessman, while the intelligence services are represented as well beyond any reasonable conception of evil.  The sense of imminent threat and the realization that the paranoia which pervades the dialogue isn't really paranoia when they are really and truly out to get you make this a particularly difficult story to watch.  I give it an A for aesthetic skill, a C for thematics, an A for initial conception, a C for final execution, given that I found the conclusion to be very implausible, both from the point of view of likelihood and from the point of view of plausible human behavior.

The BBC would like to see a second series but the creator feels (quite correctly, I think) that, given the condition of things at the end of the final episode, a second series would necessarily be a spy story rather than a relationship story and change both the series genre and all of the subsidiary elements which make it what it is.

Bottom line: this is not a British mystery story that will relax and satisfy you.  It is a deeply disturbing story of desperate individuals attempting to find their way in a hollow universe where love and loneliness confront iron power with limitless resources.  Done with great skill, it includes moments of beautiful writing and memorable lines; it is not, however, the kind of story that you will want to see a second or third time.",1456099200,13,3969,4.981790591805766

The first episode was tantalizing but I am guessing his early character--so young and angsty-- is meant to be 'innocent' at first. I look forward to the Danny character developing more complexities as I find Whishaw so brilliant at embodying the multilayered and deeper adult character.",1453593600,4,432,5.013888888888889

8744543,5,B0199VU6KY,"Two men meet by chance on a London street. The attraction is immediate and magnetic. Danny (superbly played by Ben Whishaw) is fond of the party scene, but is basically a decent guy. Alex is shy, mysterious, and shares very little about himself. Nonetheless, the two fall deeply in love and have an affair that lasts for months, until Alex's tragic death. The remainder of this five-part series follows Danny's frustrating quest for the truth behind Alex's murder. I won't give too much away, but it seems Alex, a genius with numbers and patterns, has developed a type of software that could change the face of the world. Unfortunately, the rich and the powerful have a great deal to lose if it becomes openly available, and Danny's life is turned into a living hell by the faceless powers that be. Yet he continues his search for a deadly conspiracy with persistence and courage. A remarkable cast is often undercut by turgid pacing, but this is still a suspenseful and thoughtful thriller. Be advised - there are some disturbing scenes and images. Overall an excellent series.",1531612800,,1078,4.832432432432433
8744544,5,B0199VU6KY,"Excellent film. The central character is not the protagonist, and you see him mainly in flashback. Ben Whishaw is excellent; his character here is quite different from the one he played in The Hour. If you've only seen him as the new Q in recent James Bond films, you're missing out on a fine actor. Charlotte Rampling is downright chilling in her role. Highly recommended.",1530316800,,373,4.753846153846154

8744551,4,B0199VU6KY,"This was a dark, melancholy, yet exquisite journey. More of a tragic romance with a little mystery and suspense than outright mystery or suspense, Danny, our main character dealt with consequences and unanswered questions accompanied by the grief of losing someone he loved.

Its not an ideal love story, but an awkward one which rings true with a tender individuality and intimacy. Danny meets a mysterious man whos as thrown by their encounter as he is. The two of them find themselves falling in love. The man, Alex, disappears. Danny wonders what hes done wrong, only to find his lovers body in an attic.

The stage has been set for the two of them to appear to be something they werent. Forces from all sides try to convince Danny that his lover was a spy, a sexual sadist, a manipulator, surrounding him with lies to baffle and bewilder him.

He refuses to be baffled. He continues to search for the truth for tragic consequences.

The acting and photography in this is superb.

For me, a personal draw was the parallels between some of the characters to others Ive enjoyed.

Something about Danny and his Alex reminds me of Hannibal and Will. Maybe its Alexs accent. Maybe its the chemistry between them. Maybe Im just imagining it. The two of them made me think of what Hannibal and Will might have been like, if theyd been two different people, meeting in a different way.

One cameo role I loved, which I want to point out to certain Forever Knight fans was Mark Gatiss as Richie. He gave me delightful LaCroix flashbacks with his roll as tempter, trying to seduce Danny with the drug of his choice. Richies intimacy with Danny, his mockery, and his twisted truths.the parallel between the drug pusher and the master vampire was acute. Any Cousins of the Unnamed Faction still out there who miss their beloved Uncleyou may want to catch this before it gets away. :)",1512691200,,1875,4.663636363636364
8744552,5,B0199VU6KY,"Emotional, gripping, deeply personal - Whishaw, Holcroft, and Broadbent are superb, and the Nordic Noir-style direction (yes, I know the director is Belgian, but there are clearly influences; his other work includes the first season of The Fall) is just that bit off-kilter to make you feel as if you've been thrown through the looking glass yourself.

NOTE: the Region 1 DVD shown here has several important cuts/alterations from the originally aired UK version which affect the beginning tone of Episode 1. (I'm not sure about the other episodes yet.) In particular, in the opening scene where Danny is walking through the tube with Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love' blaring through his earbuds, the music has been changed (likely for copyright reasons: common with UK->US transfers; I don't know if the UK DVD has been altered as well); immediately after, when he's walking out of the club dazed, friendless, alone - the variations of his attempts to ring his friends (...acquaintances, anyone) - have been whittled down. He throws the phone, and Edward Holcroft retrieves it. The direction and Whishaw's sheer desperation in this sequence was what initially got me hooked, so I was baffled. There may be other edits as well - I haven't compared the other episodes - but it did look as if some material had been switched around. It didn't seem on account of graphic or sexual content, either, so this is baffling. Just a warning, as I enjoyed the original version much more.

(I don't know if the streaming version uses the original aired edit or this one.)",1509667200,,1555,4.908745247148289
