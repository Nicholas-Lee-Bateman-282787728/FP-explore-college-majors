1626425,5,B00005ML8T,"If you want to laugh out loud and non-stop for 90 minutes, don't miss Margaret Cho's brilliant ""I'M THE ONE THAT I WANT.""  Irreverent, crude, cleansing, shocking, inspiring, sad, outrageous, and life-affirming, Cho's sold out, smash, one woman show ranks with the best of the best (yes, I'm talkin' as great as Richard Pryor or Lenny Bruce at their peak).  I fell out of my chair, so strap yourself in or sit on the floor.  Brutally honest and hysterically funny.",1003190400,,463,4.7625
1626426,5,B00005ML8T,"Margaret Cho can't really be called a stand-up comic; to slap such a narrow label on her wouldn't do justice to her remarkable story-telling ability, her talent for sharing tales that are alternately sidesplittingly hilarious and unbelievably heartbreaking. I've seen her perform and read from her book five times in the past two years, because she's so entertaining and enlightnening. Any woman who's ever struggled with self-image issues (which is EVERY woman), anyone who's ever been ... on and ... off should buy this DVD. Because I said so.",1002585600,3,545,5.134831460674158
1626427,5,B00005ML8T,"As many other people have said here, this stand up comedy show offers more laughs than just about anything else you will see on film. No attempt at elaborate comedy could accomplish what Margaret Cho does alone onstage. Her performance made me laugh so hard when I saw it in the theatre that I embarrassed myself several times. Not only is it extremely funny, probably funnier than any other performance of any kind that I have seen, but it is also deeply moving. I very much recommend it; it is truly great.",1002585600,3,508,4.532608695652174
1626428,4,B00005ML8T,"For those of us who can't get enough of Margaret Cho when we hear sound bites of her live performances or read small passages from her various writings, here's a gift wrapped up with a giant bow: a live filming of one of her shows. Cho is every bit the superstar as she narrates her entire career, if not life, using the funniest impersonations of her mother (that are sometimes so touching they'll make you cry) and the scariest parts of her very colourful career. She's honest about her previous problems with drugs, her obsessions over her weight, and all the rocky relationships she's survived, making her comedy so important to her audience because of her candid confessions. Apart from that, she's the damned funniest woman in the world next to Jennifer Saunders, and this film shows us everything about what makes her so. Don't hesitate!",1001894400,2,844,4.787671232876712
1626479,5,B00005ML8T,This is one funny lady.  I saw her stand-up routine on TV and had to have it.  I received it in perfect condition and in the time expected.  JG,1374451200,,143,3.8620689655172415
1626480,5,B00005ML8T,"I love how honest Margaret is about herself. I can understand where she is coming from wanting to fit in or make people happy. I love when she talks about her mother. She's not afraid to tell the truth.  She is definitely one of my favorite comics. She can make fun of herself and I feel that listening to her makes me feel empowered. I don't think I really had a chance to watcher tv show when it came out. When she started a lot of people didn't believe in her, but look what happened. She has succeeded and definitely influenced other women and female comics.",1368835200,,562,4.30188679245283
1626481,5,B00005ML8T,This is the Classic Cho.  I loved this when I was in collage and had a CD.  I pretty much memorized the whole show.  If you like Cho.  This is the one that you want,1355443200,,164,3.6
1626482,5,B00005ML8T,"Awesome DVD... Everyone should watch it!!! I love her and laughed my butt off watching this movie. If you have not watched this movie, go get it now and watch it with some friends and be ready to die laughing!!!",1340409600,,211,4.3
1626483,4,B00005ML8T,It has a weak ending but is pretty darn funny.  Great for past time and even better with friends.,1234656000,,97,4.105263157894737
1626484,5,B00005ML8T,"My partner and I have all four of her shows on DVD, and this is still our favorite. Why? Because though she digresses and takes time to channel various characters, all the elements are still unified by the thread of her own story. She's a pottymouth, but not as gratuitously as in her later shows, and the timing (or the editing) seems faster.

This is a great introduction to the magic of Margaret!",1203897600,,399,4.465753424657534
1626485,4,B00005ML8T,"I've seen snippets from Margaret Cho's other comedy routines, but this, her first, is the only one I've watched in its entirety (and more than once).  You'd think I was afraid to watch the later ones--not because I'm easily offended or put-off--but simply because this show is so solid (laugh-out-loud funny, but also touchingly honest) that maybe I'm almost afraid I'll be disappointed in the follow-up films.  Definitely something to work on in this new year.

It's not that this recorded performance is perfect.  In essence, I'd have to agree with some commentators that her timing SEEMS to be off on occasion and that some bits are milked too long.  But I say ""seems"" because this is a recording of a live show and, obviously, quite a different experience from experiencing it first-hand.  A comedian sometimes pauses, in response to audience reaction, and that doesn't always come through on a videorecording.  And sometimes, it may just me the viewer (in this case, me) who's being dense and NOT getting it.  The first time I watched the show, I didn't understand the seemingly endless repetitions of  the ""Hi, my name is Gwen and I'm here...""  Second time through, I had  a ""D'oh"" moment, and it finally dawned on me that Gwen was going from hospital bed to hospital bed saying the same durned thing over and over.

How I missed that the first time, I'll never know.

Some will no doubt find the comedy-as-therapy approach to much of this material a little too much.  Again, I'd say you have to keep in mind that this is a film of a live performance.  The close ups capture the pained look in Margaret's face at some key moments--which is more than the audience can see at a distance.  But then again, they CAN hear the emotion in her delivery, and that's impossible to miss.  But if you think Margaret Cho is unique among comics in using her personal pain as raw material for comedy, you may need to go back and give other contemporary comics (well, really, comics from the last several decades) a serious re-listening or re-viewing.  Think Richard Pryor!  Think Chris Rock!  Comics have been ""bringing the pain"" for decades now (and longer if mother-in-law jokes count.)

Scrolling through some of the reviews posted on this site, I see one or two that talk about how much sharper and more focused her later routines are on the subsequent DVDs.  If that's true, I really need to get over my fear of disappointment and give NOTORIOUS C.H.O. and REVOLUTION a shot.  But this one will always have a special place on my DVD shelf.  It's a document of a very brave AND very funny woman finding her voice at last.",1202515200,,2616,4.6615720524017465
1626486,5,B00005ML8T,"One learns a lot about Cho from this DVD. While maintaining hilarity, Cho tells the story of her  time as a child star, and her battle with weight disorders.

Very great, and a definite purchase for a Cho fan.",1178409600,,209,4.333333333333333
1626487,4,B00005ML8T,"I like this film quite a bit.  Normally, I don't get into standup comedy films, but I like Margaret Cho for the most part.  She is usually very funny, and her audience is really having a good time here.  Some of my favorite parts are where she impersonates her mother and that ABC hired an ""Asian consultant"" for her horrible sitcom.  The mother bit is hilarious, and the ABC bit is hilarious as well as outrageous (maybe the folks at ABC didn't realise that Korea is considered part of Asia).  I did object to when Margaret talks about how she became a drunk, drugged out tramp after the sitcom was cancelled.  The term she used was she gave a lot of unnecessary h**d.  I understand that she needs to vent, but I don't really like to hear too much about the sordid details of her private life, and I doubt that her current husband cared for it that much either (guys do not like to hear their current squeeze's past, no matter how ""open minded"" they are).  I'm glad she's cleaned up, and I hope she stays that way.  She doesn't really go into too much political stuff here, which is good.  Too often Margaret's poiltical rantings become shrill and humourless, like a lot of political rantings tend to do.  But here she stays clear of that, which makes this one of the better comedy concert films.",1176595200,,1297,4.430379746835443
1626488,5,B00005ML8T,"Love, love, love, love, love Margaret Cho's I'm the One That I Want (and really all of her stand up films). It could be because she makes me want to laugh so hard that my body simply cannot facilitate the amount of laughter desperate to escape and I find myself on the verge of convulsions. Or it could be because she is one of the best social commentators of all time. It could be because she is so beautiful in every way and that she's an uninhibited, intelligent individual of a woman...or because she is aware--aware that all of us (at least us everyday freaky, yet normal, folks) desperately need to know that we're not alone in this world that seems so full of self-righteousness. That we don't need to feel so ashamed of our actions, our bodies, our minds. She frees us from that in telling us, hysterically, her own stories of how easy it can be to lose oneself in the quest for acceptance. One of the most profound moments in the film is her heartbreaking story about being signed on for a sitcom based on her own life that wound up forcing her to become someone she wasn't at all, which ultimately compromised her strong voice in the process. Well, her voice ain't lost now! In this film, she is back and she is stronger than ever. (and that strength continues to be reflected in Notorious, Revolution and Assassin...oh, and on her Web site and various other projects). You Go, Girl!",1173225600,,1393,4.488188976377953
1626522,5,B00005ML8T,"I'm not exaggerating. This is a 5 star comedy show. My friend showed this to me and I laughed my butt off. Margaret Cho is fun-nee. The stories she tells are amazing. My favorite is definitely ""The Gwen Story"". My friend and I still talk that one up. And of course what would a Cho show be without impersonations of her mother. This is a genuine riot. If you haven't seen it yet, repent and see it now.",1167264000,,402,4.166666666666667
1626523,5,B00005ML8T,"I laughed so hard I had tears come down my face. That woman is so funny! I love when she does her mother. And this one part where she is in the hospital and the nurse's aide comes to her bed and growls loudly ""I'M GWENDOLYN, AND I'M HERE TO WASH YOUR V****A!"" What a hoot! Her parents were in the audience for the first time. I wish the camera panned over to them so I could see the expressions on their faces!",1153958400,,410,3.9518072289156625
1626524,5,B00005ML8T,"I have to say, her impression of her mother will leave you laughing for days. The joke about Gwen will be something you'll probably remember for a long time to come, just because of how annoyingly funny and disturbing it is. I sure never want anyone I know to end up in a hospital with Gwen, that's for sure!",1149379200,,308,4.237288135593221
1626525,3,B00005ML8T,"The comedian's quasi-one-woman-show stand-up act is introspective, retrospective, and hilarious.  A must-have for Margaret Cho fans (obviously).  Includes a few DVD extras.  See also: ""I'm the One That I Want"" - the book.",1136246400,,221,5.636363636363637
1626526,5,B00005ML8T,"Since this is a standup act, i don't think theres technically any spoilers to give. But in case i run across something that might make a joke less funny ill put my regular ###s around it so you can skip over that if youd like.

""I'm The One That I Want"" is one of the three dvds of Margaret Chos work that i know of. Ive only seen one other (Notorious C.H.O.) so far while the other im waiting for when im in the mood for some standup again. Ive also seen her on Comedy Central a time or two and watched her tv show ""All American Girl"". Does it show im a fan? LOL! ;D

But this was a different Margaret than i had seen before. She had her usual topic that outlines all of her shows: Acceptance. Acceptance for gays, acceptance for Asians, acceptance for overweight people, especially women in her industry. Im not a regular part of any of these worlds (Im pretty average in my weight, im not Asian, and i live in the midwest where if you even have a homosexual thought they crucify you), but somehow whenever Margaret speaks i can relate it to my own life somehow. Its all about wanting to love and be loved.

What was different about this show was that it was after her television series had been cancelled. So, while the first half hour or so was about homosexual lifestyle, the bulk of the show was about her being Asian and an overweight woman. She isn't afraid to point out the steriotypes. She spoke about how people hadnt seen an Asian role model like her before because she ###""...didnt play the violin. I didn't f""k Woody Allen.""### She also mentioned how much the producers worried about her weight and how much they made her worry about her weight. It was a devistating thing when her show got cancelled because she was replaced by Drew Carrey who she says she loves but she still quips ###""They cancelled my show and replaced me with Drew Carrey because hes so skinny.""###

Margaret talks openly about her hardships during these hard times. The standup becomes her own little soapbox like usual, but this time it feels more effective (at least for a Cho fan who cares a lot about her). Her routine slips back and forth between funny and serious. A couple of times people weren't sure if she was making a joke or not so nervous laughter could be heard in small protions throughout the presentation. This was definently a theraputic act for Margaret and, after hearing what she went through, im glad she survived to tell her tale.

In the end Margaret comes to terms with who she is and the world around her. Even her wieght is no longer an issue. ###""Loosing ten pounds is a full time job so im handing in my two weeks notice and walking out the door.""### She even has some funny revelations. She tells a story of one of her first jobs was presenting on a lesbian cruise. She says she slept with one of the women on board so she ###""...went through this whole thing am i straight? Am i gay? And then i realized, im just slutty.""### Through the pain Margaret is still able to joke about herself. And the impressions of her mother are always worth the watch. Couldnt get through a review without mentioning those. ;D She does use a lot of vulgarity and she isn't afraid to say anything, just for some fair warning.

Margaret decides ""Im The One That I Want"" and theres no reason for her to be any other way.",1107475200,2,3316,4.383739837398374
1626527,5,B00005ML8T,"Margaret Cho describes the rise and fall of her TV show ""All-American Girl,"" her close ties with the gay community, being Asian-American, and her dead-pan impersonations of her mother.  By far one of the funniest stand-up films around, what makes this a great film is that she lets the audience see her human side.  It takes much courage to discuss the whirlwind of emotions as well as the physical and mental stresses surrounding her failed TV show -- the producers said she was too fat to play herself, she wasn't Asian enough, the alcoholism, the hospital time.  To go through that hell and still come out strong and with your sense of humor intact and then want to share it...she is to be admired.
This is one film that I truly can watch over and over.  Even though I know the jokes and though my friends and I quote some of the lines to one another (the line about Gwen will drive you mad!!!), I still laugh so hard and so loud and wipe the tears from my eyes.  The DVD extras are also worth watching.  A definite winner!",1061769600,10,1026,4.402116402116402
1626528,5,B00005ML8T,"Bought it at Capitol City Pride in Des Moines, Iowa last year.
Great DVD- Margaret Cho is hilariously funny.
Serious moments within the presentation also- a comedic autobiography.",1051142400,,179,5.428571428571429
1626529,5,B00005ML8T,"The show gets off to a slow start (the whole Karl Lagerfeld thing wasn't all that funny to me), but after that the show picks up.  I hurt myself laughing during the part where she talks about her mother leaving messages on her answering machine.  The part where she discusses her failed sitcom and her subsequent substance abuse was alternatingly funny and poignant.  I hope she never quits.  A sense of humor is a terrible thing to waste.",1044403200,,439,4.589743589743589
1626530,5,B00005ML8T,"While many comics stick to the safety of jokes with punchlines, Margaret Cho goes out on a limb.  She recounts touching moments in her life, and just as you're about to shed a tear, she punches you in the gut with her comic genius!
You may have heard some of this material before, but never has vaginal cleansing sounded so appealing!  Margaret's take on lesbian cruises, gay porn, and her mother's phone messages will leave you crying and gasping for air!
Her stories are brutally honest and life-affirming, but the best part of this DVD might just be found in the Behind-The-Scenes section.  When Margaret reads an emotional letter from a fan whose partner died of AIDS, your heart will explode with love, as she says that hers did.
... I've got chills, they're multiplying... And I'm losing control... The power she's supplying... It's ELECTRIFYING!
She's Margaret Cho, and we're not worthy!",1043280000,,894,4.868421052631579
1626560,5,B00005ML8T,"Just amazing. This is not only a performance of fabulous comedy, but also makes a number of important statements about our prejudices concerning weight, race, sexuality, and gender. It's no accident that Margaret's comedy is being used as an educational tool in many universities today. This one is not to be missed.",1040860800,3,316,5.096153846153846
1626561,5,B00005ML8T,"i have never laughed so hard in my life.  whether it be margaret poking fun at her weight, here ever-so-proud title of being a ""fag-hag"", or her insanely funny impersonation of her mother.  margaret is honestly one of the 4 or 5 funniest comedians in the U.S.  what i love most about her stand-up, is how brutally honest she is.  things that no other comic would dare discuss on stage, margaret does.  and being able to laugh about all her trials and hardships she has faced, is truly amazing.  this movie is for anyone who is on the road to self-discovery and who feels they do not fit in.  this movie is for those being persecuted for their gender/race/sexual orientation/weight/etc.  but don't let that fool you.  that does not take away from margaret's talent and ability to make you laugh.  but i have been inspired greatly by this, and my new philosophy in life is that ""i will not fail as someone else.  i will suceed as myself"".",1030492800,2,936,4.511904761904762
1626562,5,B00005ML8T,"Margaret Cho's show ""I'm the One That I Want"" is so funny, I swore I was tearing stomach muscles from my nonstop laughing throughout her performance.  Cho's humor, abrasive yet never hateful, pokes fun at her gay friends, compares straight porn to gay porn, and, most compelling of all, it details her struggle to gain acceptance as an Asian on prime time TV.  In a climate that favors thin, blonde women, Cho had to work doubly hard to gain respect, but despite her efforts, she faced adversity at every turn.  Probably the most humiliating blow was when one of the producers hired a consultant to help Cho appear to be ""more Asian.""  This, compounded with her rotund figure, led to some serious self-esteem issues and began a steady physical and emotional deterioration.  All of this may seem like too much baggage to be viewed in a comic light, but Cho pulls it off impressively and comes across as a true survivor.  There are comedians who take cheap shots for laughs, but Cho aims high, and the result is this winning comedy that never disappoints.",1028764800,2,1053,4.695652173913044
1626563,5,B00005ML8T,"I thought, when I saw this movie, Wow, this should be good.  I had previously seen her on Comedy Central and laughed like crazy.  You can tell it was funny in the beginning.  From her jokes about her mother, and her life dealing with drug and alcohol abuse, she makes it into a funny situation.  She knows what will tickle the funny bone, or what will make you say you go girl.  What intrigued me was she was Asian and not White or any other race.  THat was unusual, and made it twice better.  I think it shows how it is living on Polk Street and being a ... hag.  This is a must see for anyone who wants to laugh their heads off.  The only down part was the audience laughed so much, I was like shut up and let her make me laugh!",1027987200,,730,3.9793103448275864
1626564,5,B00005ML8T,I watched this over the weekend and was blown away at how funny it was.  Truly an enjoyable show to watch again and again.  Not just a bunch of jokes which will become stale as time goes on but rather a difficult and funny journey into Ms. Cho's past and present life in dealing with being who she is in the world that we live in.  Revealing as it is hilarious.,1026259200,,361,4.056338028169014

She takes her horrible experience with the Hollywood celebrity mill and makes us laugh. I thought the show was well written and Margaret on stage was great. Her faces were priceless!

This is a video to pop in the machine any time you're feeling sorry for yourself and need a good laugh.",1025395200,,444,4.285714285714286

The material is both comedic and tragic (they go together)The well blended material about reaching the heights in Hollywood and crashing to the bottom. Never once wallowing in self pity Cho takes us on journey through self discovery and how show learned to love herself. Well written and performed the DVD is going to part of my permamanet collection. There is so much to take in that with repeated viewings one would not get bored. I cannot recommend this more. I wish there were more than five stars to give which is not something I give lightly.,1016582400,,635,4.482758620689655
1626567,5,B00005ML8T,"The best comics pull from their deepest experiences. They are not afraid to be deeply serious, as well as hilarious. When the rare comic merges these two moods it becomes a magical form of performance art.
Margaret Cho has acheived this fusion with this work - the strongest of her career. In this one woman show she looses the anguish that she experienced at the hands of ABC during the run of her sitcom ""All American Girl."" She describes the hideous aftermath that she experienced, and her journey back to the light.
The true testement to Margaret as an artist, and not just a comic, is the humour she injects into a devestating situation. What evolves during the show is a sense of catharsis that is truly awe inspiring. I saw her perform this show live, and again in the film that was recorded months later - her performance was as fresh and heartfelt as ever.
Margaret Cho is far more than a comedienne, she is a performance artist of highest caliber. I look forward to what she has to offer in the future.",1016150400,,1012,4.505434782608695

We thought it was pretty much the end of her career, and that disappointed us greatly.  The beginning of this video didn't change our impression, either.  The first 25 minutes of pandering to the gay SF audience was so boring that my wife fell asleep.  But then something different happened -- suddenly she started talking about her failed sitcom, and she started to get very real, very personal.  Her stories were so intense that the jokes became more heartfelt and more intense as well.  45 minutes into the video I was alternating between laughing my throat hoarse and fighting back tears.  I doubt it will be that extreme of an experience for most -- I suspect it is merely that, being married to a Korean woman, I have seen first-hand some of the same discrimination that Margaret describes.  But it is nonetheless exceptionally funny, and hey, if all it does it make you laugh, well lucky you.  After all, that is why you're considering buying this video, isn't it?",1013299200,3,1089,4.56701030927835

Now, years later, this saucy Korean diva is back to talk about that traumatic time in her life and other personal points in her life as only she can.  This concert is a laugh out loud riot and I never get tired of watching it.  Margaret covers her love of gay men, her career and, of course, her mother.  If you want to invite some friends over, sit back and laugh until you have tears rolling down your face, you'll want this dvd.

Peppered with the trademark Cho humor, it confronts controversial, sensitive, and socially important issues . I love her no holds barred style of comedy, and as an Asian American woman I appreciate her willingness to attack steretypes, dismantle misconceptions, and address issues that lesser people run away from or avoid everyday. Her ability to cover personal and sensitive relationships, situations, and experiences is touching and reminds each of us to be introspective about our belief systems. I would love to have seen more behind the scenes stuff or even some brief pieces that outlined the things she was responding too --for example 'the american girl' episodes with her commentary mixed in...All in all, a movie you can watch over and over",1012348800,,839,5.0
1626602,5,B00005ML8T,"Cho's work is some of the funniest material I've seen in years, and what makes it most amazing is that she manages to combine all the humor with a serious message.
At one point, she was making me laugh so much I had to press ""mute"", cause I couldn't breathe if she said another funny thing!
The DVD extras are excellent, especially the documentary on 'The Making of' the film and the history behind the journey from stage show to the screen.
Cho's work is highly original, yet it appeals far beyond her cult status in the [homosexual] community.  She truly deserves a place next to Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor and George Carlin as a comedian who is not afraid to take the stage and not only makes us laugh, but also makes us think.",1011744000,,730,4.407407407407407

To be honest, I never expected Cho to be as affable, accessible and plain funny as she proves to be here.  Nothing she'd done that I'd seen before prepared me for the warmth and good nature she brings to the stage.  If you are like me and think that her jokes will only appeal to gays, lesbians and Asians, you are flat out wrong.  In an almost Lenny Bruce-like fashion, without as much fire and brimstone, Margaret Cho nails her jokes with ease, flair and an almost deceptively devlish good-girl grin.  I took a chance and bought this DVD after hearing good things about the movie release.  Not only am I thrilled I did, but I have since shared it with friends and family just to re-experience moments that are rarely seen in stand up comedy.  More abrasive than Ellen DeGeneres, Cho is part Richard Pryor-part Carol Burnett, and charming all the way!  This woman's got GUTS and laughs to last a lifetime!  But it - you'll love it.",1010707200,26,1045,4.457894736842105

Oh!  Brilliant...!  She's brilliant!  My mother and I went to see her in Cleveland with a few of my friends a couple years back and she had us laughing to the brink of incontinence!  She is completely politically incorrect and I LOVE HER FOR IT!
Do yourself a huge favour and just pick this DVD up.  Your life will be forever changed by her words.

1626605,2,B00005ML8T,Not Margarets' best.  Her HBO special was much better.  Still funny but I think I expected more.  It was too serious in parts and I think it has too many lulls.,1007164800,,160,4.096774193548387
1626606,5,B00005ML8T,"This DVD is a must.  I read the book of the same name, adapted from this performance, and saw Ms. Cho brilliantly perform excerpts from that book in NY earlier this year.  Nothing, however, prepared me for the uproarious performance captured here on DVD, taped before an audience of rabid fans in San Francisco, Cho's hometown.  This is perhaps the funniest (and arguably one of the raunchier) comedy-concert film of the past decade.  Cho reveals the extraordinary pain and turmoil of her young life, and managed to make me laugh harder than anything I can remember in years.  If you're a gay man, you will literally fall on the floor at her dead-on observations of gay life and ""fag-hagdom"", other open-minded viewers will laugh almost as hard.  Thanks, Margaret, for letting is in.",1006732800,3,783,4.849624060150376
1626607,5,B00005ML8T,"I must admit that there were a few segments during this show that I was in literal pain, clutching my stomach with one hand, and hitting my lap with the other, incapable of breathing, and incapable of controlling my laughter. This was, without a doubt, one of the funniest, most brutally honest stand-up comedy shows I have ever seen. And yet, I would not want to label it as ""stand-up comedy,"" since it was something much deeper and profound. This was not the expected list of witticisms and observations about society and pop culture that most people expect stand-up comedy to be. This is one woman's deep, penetrating look into herself, at good times and horrible times. She tells things to her audience about herself that most people would be too ashamed to say, but it is her hope that by revealing the bad things about her past, she can help others in her position. She talks about the discrimination she suffered, based both on her race and her weight, she talks about a long period of depression, boozing and drugging she went through, she talks about the producers of ""All-American Girl,"" her short-lived sitcom, and how they coerced her to lose 35 pounds in 2 weeks, causing her kidneys to collapse...All of this sounds like this show is a real downer. But, ya know what? It isn't. This, as I said before, is also one of the funniest performances I have ever seen. She finds humor in even the bleakest of situations. It is a real testament to her that she found a way to make dark situation funny, and yet not mock the situations themselves, or herself. She strikes a delicate balance between pathos and comedy, and does so perfectly. Having survived a dark period in her life and come out on top, she can now look back on it from a different perspective. And it is one worth hearing, especially for young actors or actresses who feel they have to change themselves in order to become famous.
But I must stress one more time...If you are just in the mood for laughs, do not run away from this film because of the dark parts. Because it is, once again, gutbustingly funny. There will be tears of laughter streaming down your face, and that is a guarantee.
Margaret Cho is a great writer. Her routines are so meticulously worded, and in most cases, you cannot foresee her punchlines. She throws you for a loop everytime, making the jokes even  funnier and more brilliant. And you must SEE her perform as well. Her facial expressions are priceless. And her accents are wonderful: her Valley Girl impression, her black gay guy impression, and of course, her impression of her Korean-born mother, which is both touching and hilarious.
I recommend you purchase rather than rent this concert. I have watched it repeatedly, and it is still as funny as the first time I saw it. I always liked Margaret Cho, but this one DVD has made me a huge fan of hers. Her talent must be seen to be believed. She is that great.",1004918400,14,2915,4.573613766730402
1626608,5,B00005ML8T,"Wow, it hardly seems that Margaret Cho has been in the business long enough to have endured the things she's endured.  But indeed she has, and she shares all in this hilarious video.
Having seen Margaret live a handful of times over the years, her timing and content are at their best in this video.  Building on material she's used occasionally throughout the years, she explores topics such as weight loss, her mother (of course), being attacked by midgets, fear of straight people and, in more serious tones, her sense of disappointment when her TV show ""All American Girl"" failed.
For anyone who's ever seen Ms. Cho perform, this is a no-brainer purchase.  For anyone else, trust us all - it's worth it. :)",1004227200,5,710,4.709677419354839
