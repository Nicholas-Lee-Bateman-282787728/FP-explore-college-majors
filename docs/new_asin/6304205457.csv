8223500,5,6304205457,"I was building a Charles Bronson collection and this was like the last movie I needed to complete my collection. I looked for this film for years and thought that this film had disappeared off the face of the earth. A collector in the U.K. told me that the movie had been renamed for the VHS release and I could buy it for less than $1 from amazon. This movie has only been released once to my knowledge on this obscure VHS. It was recorded in EP mode. That was a bummer but the movie was watchable and enjoyable. And there are copies available for sale for less than $1 right now. If you are a hardcore Charles Bronson fan like me, then don't pass this up because the film it good. Also features strong performance by Richard Egan.",1311552000,,732,4.273381294964029
