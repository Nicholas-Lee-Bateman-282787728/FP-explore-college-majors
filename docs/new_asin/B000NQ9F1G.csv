This movie is an inspiring story about the years following the civil rights movement.  Louis Gossett, Jr. plays Tom Hayward, a California preacher who has returned the South to pay his respects to Martin Luther King.  While visiting his old relatives, he is fed up with the local authorities and decided that somebody should do something to change the county leadership.  His friends in the area say that no man would be better than Hayward himself.  He commits to running for Sheriff on the condition that he do so on his own terms.

The movement around Hayward has a shot because the county he is running in is made up primarily of blacks.  The problem is that most of the are not registered to vote.  There is a backlash from some of the white leaders when they begin to notice Hayward's efforts, leading to one particularly nasty incident that stays unresolved until the movie's conclusion.

After the uphill battle, Hayward wins his election.  The movie would have been interesting enough if it ended here, but is even better since we see how he uses his new power.  He promises to be fair to blacks and whites and even works with some of the leaders who had tried to prevent him from running.

One of the major themes in the movie - even more than racial tension - is the main character's commitment to nonviolence.  He is constantly urged by his associates to lash out violently against the enemies of his campaign.  He is so principled in this matter that he ultimately decides against carrying a gun when he is elected sheriff!

The notions of violent versus nonviolent struggle addressed in the movie is based on real internal debates that happened amongst black groups in the 1960s & 1970s.  It is politically incorrect to point this out today, but towards the end of his life, Martin Luther King & the ideas of nonviolent resistance were falling out of favor with some of the prominent black radical groups.  This is covered in Michael Dyson's book 'I Might Not Get there With You'.

Louis Gossett's character is based on Thomas E Gilmore, a real life sheriff in Greene County, Alabama who was known for not wearing a sidearm.  His story was covered in the 1971 Time Magazine article ""Change Comes to the Courthouse"".  He served the county for 12 years.",1256601600,2,2387,4.6650717703349285
