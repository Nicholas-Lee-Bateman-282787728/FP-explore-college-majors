5062288,1,B0077PTWZK,"Not the worst but not that great either. A tables match ends by a wrestler accidentally breaking it himself? Victory for a Barney wannnabe funky fat man in spandex? Cena v Lesnar was good although Lesnar clearly should have won. I could have easily slept thru the rest of this bland presentation.

WWE will never put out a quality product until people stop supporting the current mindless SpongeBob Squarepants type nonsense.",1338336000,2,425,4.985915492957746
5062289,5,B0077PTWZK,"Falls Count Anywhere Match: Randy Orton vs. Kane - You knew exactly where this match was going from when the pipe (that both men had been using against each other for weeks) in the ring & used within the first minute.  As expected with a Falls Count Anywhere Match, they went into the crowd & brawled up the steps with Kane even doing a move unfamiliar to him in a charging low dropkick before going to the stage & backstage where someone who had his own issues with Kane got a few shots in himself before the cameraman even got knocked down because of the action.  They fought back to the ring where everything they could get their hands on was used from the steel steps to a chair to even Orton's hanging DDT off the announce table.  Both men were able to keep escaping & countering each other's signature moves but it took one move hit on the chair to finally put one man out.  This was a very entertaining brawl as we've seen in the match that started this feud months earlier to their WrestleMania rematch on SmackDown that they work the best in these ""no rules"" environments.

Brodus Clay vs. Dolph Ziggler - Dolph had Swagger & Vickie in his corner while Hornswoggle & the Funkettes were in Brodus.  Dolph had the strategy of grounding Brodus & was dominate throughout the bout with even Swagger getting a shot on the outside but had the tide turn when Brodus delivered a running headbutt through Dolph which Cole described perfectly as ""like a cannonball.""  This was the usual of what we see from Brodus but no doubt that Dolph was working hard with what he was given & not to mention was heavily over with the crowd as well for his effort.

Tables Match: Intercontinental Champion Big Show vs. Cody Rhodes - Big Show completely dominated Cody right from the start as he was chopping & tossing Cody both in & out of the ring to the point where he threw him from the crowd over the barrier to half way across the outside floor.  Cody was able to hit minimal offense in like his disaster kick when avoiding going through a table but it was him delivered a dropkick that caused Show's leg to slip off the apron through the outside table that payed off for Cody as he won on a technicality while Show was had this ""Oh Crap!"" look on his face because of what happened.  The match itself wasn't much as it was the same type of ""fluke"" win that we've usually gotten in these tables title matches (think back to the first two TLC PPV's) where it's eventually the champions beat themselves but stay tuned afterwords as Show definitely proved that he won't be without the last word...twice.

2 Out Of 3 Falls: World Champion Sheamus vs. Daniel Bryan - Although Bryan tried to heel the crowd earlier, they were heavily behind him in this town that was a regular stop during his days in Ring Of Honor while Sheamus came out with a shirt reminding them of their last encounter at WrestleMania.  Sheamus went for the kick early which Daniel avoid but later catching Bryan in a sharpshooter/boston crab combination submission before catching Bryan coming off the apron & slamming him into the barrier.  Bryan was able to mount some offense including a unique pinning combination locking Sheamus' shoulders with his legs & heavily targeting his shoulder with a grounded hammerlock & using the ringpost to his advantage.  Bryan from there kept beating on Sheamus with his aggression eventually coming back to haunt him but that didn't stop Bryan from being able to get the YES-lock with Sheamus able later to be get his kick in that turned Bryan inside out.  This was the yearly match on this PPV that was the quality of match we SHOULD have gotten WrestleMania (in this case, the previous two Mania's they had a scheduled match) because this was both men's best performance in recent memory & you saw just by how exhausted they were they gave you everything & told a story along the way.

Ryback vs. Aaron Relic & Jay Hatton - If you have no clue who the tag team is, don't even bother trying to figure it out as they were nothing more than bodies for the squash match for ""Goldberg"" (watch the match to get the joke).

Street Fight Match: WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. Chris Jericho - Punk not only returns home but also returns of ""the scene of the crime"" of where he first became a WWE Champion close to a year earlier in Chicago with Punk's family at ringside & both men dressed in their street clothes for this match.  You knew where this match was going when Punk brought in a kendo stick during the first minute of the match with Jericho kept going outside to break Punk's momentum & even went as far as to hide behind the referee to gain the advantage & use the stick himself.  Both men brawled on the outside with Jericho going as far as to taunt Punk's sister which made Punk ""snap"" resulting in Jericho getting slammed through the announce table hood before Jericho retaliated with the monitor & breaking the rest of the hood over his back before Jericho got too cocky & began pouring beer on Punk's back with Punk coming back with a low blow using the stick.  They went back & forth after this with counters to the Lionsault & GTS along, the unique escapes from the Walls Of Jericho & Anaconda Vice, a SAVAGE elbow through the announce table followed by a Codebreaker with a steel chair, and attempting to use the other's finisher.  They topped their WrestleMania match which was quality in it's own right as it really did come off as a brawl between two men who wanted to beat the hell out of each other with the added drama of Punk's sister being the crowd definitely helped.

Divas Champion Nikki Bella vs. Layla - Beth Phoenix was suppose to get her rematch here but wasn't medically cleared resulting in a mystery challenger in the returning Layla.  Nikki focused on Layla's previously injured knee while Bree would get involved when the referee wasn't looking including doing the ""twin magic"" at one point while Layla looked like she didn't miss a step including doing some new lucha styles moves like the armdrag & top rope crossbody.  This was too short to really made a note of anything but it was good for what it was but keep out for the ending as the ending came as a results of the ""Rude Awakening"" neckbreaker that looked like it really hurt.

Extreme Rules Match: John Cena vs. Brock Lesnar - For those trivia fans, this is a rematch from 9 years earlier this same month (called ""Backlash"" back then) with Cena having the rival chants again before the first entrance was made while it should be noted that Cena wore his own chain & lock to the ring from this ""Thuganomics"" days.  Cena charged Brock right away to take him down only for Brock to knock Cena right back down with a powerful clothesline going into his ""ground & pound"" offense bust Cena open at the top of his head within the first minute causing the match to be stopped twice.  Brock came back with back & back suplexes as Brock countered the second attempt & dominate Cena pounding on that open cut & his ribs.  Cena's arm was the next target for Brock with his kamara armbar in the ring & on the outside while also throwing Cena into the barrier & ringpost shoulder first.  The referees kept falling like flies from either getting in the way or getting knocked out themselves as everything they could get their hands on was used from the steel steps to Cena's chain that ended with both men bleeding.  Normally I don't like the ""Cena gets beat the whole match only to come back to win"" matches but that wasn't the case here as Cena definitely sold the beating from his head to his arm throughout & even after the match while Lesnar came off like the ruthless monster heel & with the the asskicking (don't know how else to put it) he gave to the point where it was believable that Cena had to use his old tactics to get an advantage.

This was one of the best top to bottom WWE events in a long time as there were so many standout matches (Kane/Orton, Sheamus/Bryan, Punk/Jericho, Cena/Brock) while some matches were good for what they were (Divas, Ryback squash, Brodus/Dolph) so I would give this a 4.5 but I'll go ahead & bump it up to 5 as this is probably going to be the best effort we can get from WWE at this stage so this is definitely a PPV I would check out.",1336348800,8,8250,4.454545454545454
5062290,5,B0077PTWZK,Now this is what I call extreme rules Brock beat the living hell out of Cena. Showing blood every once and while isn't going to hurt anyone and I'm glad Vince McMahon gave the ok. Brock and Cena wasn't the only good match on the card that night but so was CM Punk vs Jericho for the WWE Championship in a Chicago street fight. Sheamus Vs Bryan for the Heavyweight Championship was also good and the rest of the other matches. Would definitely buy on DVD.,1336348800,,454,4.290697674418604
5062291,4,B0077PTWZK,"Santino vs the Mix: Exclusive on You Tube (U.S title) match. Santino won with Cobra
  Kane vs Orton No DQ: They battled everywhere but in a predictable end Orton won with an RKO on a steelchair.
  Dolph Ziggler vs Brodus Clay: Longer than most Clay matches and Ziggler actually got him down, Clay won with the splash of course though.
  Big Show vs Rhodes: Cody won the IC title back in a tables match when he drop kicked Show's leg and Show fell off the apron and his foot went threw a table, yes his foot. Show then chokeslammed Rhodes through a table and then threw him over the top ropes through a table as well.
  Ryback vs 2 skinny jobbers: Ryback destroyed them as the fans chanted Goldberg.
  Daniel Bryan vs Sheamus (World Title) 2 out of 3 Falls: Long grueling match for both with Bryan kicking Sheamus until he got DQed the first fall, he won with the Yes Lock the 2nd Fall and got booted in the face by Sheamus to lose the last fall.
  Jericho vs Punk :Punk won with the Go to Sleep to retain the title in a fine match.
  Layla vs Milking Bella: (Woman Title) Layla won and who cares, should have been Kharma.
  Brock Lesnar vs Cena: Cena of course won since he actually fairly put over the Rock at WM, so he gets to beat Lesnar, the one guy who always beat Cena and Cena never beat. For a guy who didn't wrestle in years though, Lesnar owned Cena and carried the match, literly. Everything Cena did, failed until he finally hit Lesnar with a chain and Attitude Adjustmented him on the steel steps to win. I'm not impressed though, Lesnar deserved this one.",1335744000,,1569,4.303754266211604
5062292,5,B0077PTWZK,"Throw the rulebook out the window, turn them loose and watch the mayhem, its the one night the WWE superstars go all out and become extreme. Its Extreme Rules where we will see a Chicago Street Fight for the WWE title, a 2 out of 3 falls World Title match and a clash between two of the most polarizing figures in WWE history in an Extreme Rules match.

-Falls Count Anywhere Match, Randy Orton vs. Kane: After Kane won at Wrestlemania and Randy won on Smackdown we have the rubber match here, and its not a bad way to open the show. The weapons are brought out quickly, namely the lead pipe that Orton slams into Kane a few times sending him to the outside. It goes into the crowd Randy takes it to Kane beating him up, Kane regains the advantage and goes for the win but keeps getting just two. The fight gets to the entrance way, then to the back, Kane beats on Orton, Zack Ryder even got in a few shots before Kane disposed of him.

They go back to the ring, Orton hits his usual moves setting up for the RKO, but he grabs a chair and slams it into Kane's back numerous times. The announce table is getting prepared Orton counters the chokeslam, hits his patented DDT into the ring mat but only a 2 count. Kane counters the RKO, goes for the clothesline from the top but Orton hits a superplex for two, we have a chokeslam but just two. Randy ends up hitting an RKO on a chair and covers to win. 7/10.

-Brodus Clayw/Hornswoggle vs. Dolph Ziggler w/Jack Swagger & Vickie Guerrero: These two had a recent clash on Raw and so we have this contest, which is the usual Brodus type match. The Chicago crowd is very pro-Ziggler, Dolph does get in some good moves, knocks Clay to the outside where Swagger hits a clothesline on him. Dolph hits a leg drop but only for two, he even locks on the sleeper hold but the big man finally makes his comeback. Brodus hits the headbutt and the splash for the win and the crowd boos big time. 4/10.

-We see a preshow video where the stipulation was decided for Big Show and Cody Rhodes match, the Raw Roulette Wheel settled on a Tables Match, Show said ""Good luck putting me through a table"" and walked off.

-Tables Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, Big Show (Champion) vs. Cody Rhodes: After winning the title at Wrestlemania Big Show turned the embarring mind games onto Cody, so we have this which is the expected dominance by Show in the opening minutes, before Rhodes came back targeting the knee. Show sets up a table in the corner, Cody hits the Disaster Kick off the table knocking down the big guy, who roars back with a clothesline then grabs another table. Cody ends up kicking Show off the ring apron, his foot goes through the table breaking it and Rhodes is declared the winner. 5/10, for the cheap finish. Show attacks Rhodes and chokeslams him through one table, then presses him over his head and puts him through another one on the outside then Show leaves the ring. The crowd does cheer Cody as he leaves with the I.C. title.

-Matt Striker is interviewing Daniel Bryan who runs down Sheamus, then the Chicago fans, he does his patented ""Yes, yes, yes"" chant and leaves.

-2 out of 3 Falls Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, Sheamus (Champion) vs. Daniel Bryan: After losing at Wrestlemania in just 18 seconds Bryan gets his World Title rematch in a classic 2 out of 3 falls setting, Daniel gets a massive pop from the crowd, Sheamus not so much in fact he gets a heavy booing, however he is sporting an 18 seconds shirt to mock Bryan. There's some good wrestling in the beginning, Daniel dodges the Brogue Kick, Sheamus targets the left arm with a hammerlock and knees to the arm, then locks on a Texas Cloverleaf but Daniel gets to the ropes. Bryan goes for the running knee off the apron but gets a spinebuster into the barricade, Daniel does regain the advantage working on Sheamus' arms to set up for the Yes Lock.

We have one upping by each guy, Bryan hits a roll-up for two, works on the left arm some more, Daniel keeps up the offense but still gets just two. Sheamus hits the shoulder block from the top, Bryan counters the Celtic Cross, sends Sheamus into the ring post shoulder first, which Daniel targets with kicks and he won't let up so the ref calls for the DQ, so Sheamus is up 1-0. Bryan locks on the Yes Lock, Sheamus fights towards the ropes but ends up passing out and its now 1-1. The doctors are in to check on Sheamus and the crowd has a dueling, ""Yes, No"" chant going for a bit. Sheamus says he can continue, then hits the Brogue Kick out of nowhere but only for two, Daniel hits more kicks to the back then to the head but only gets two. Sheamus goes for the superplex but is sent to the ring, but Bryan misses a diving headbutt, Sheamus hits another Brogue Kick and covers to retain the title, 9/10.

-Santino and The Great Khali are backstage to watch the following match.

-Handicap Match, Ryback vs. Two Jobbers: If you've watched Smackdown the past few weeks you know whats coming. Doesn't matter what the two guys' names are, they do a lame promo then Ryback hits the ring and the crowd starts a Goldberg chant. He beats up both guys hitting a massive clothesline on one, a sit out type stunner, a muscle buster type move then covers both men for the win. 2/10, for the crowd's Goldberg chants.

-CM Punk is backstage, the crowd cheers him heavily, Punk then talks about his match with Chris Jericho where he says he will put Jericho to sleep.

-Chicago Street Fight for the WWE Championship, CM Punk (Champion) vs. Chris Jericho: Losing at Wrestlemania lead to Jericho doing his best to humilate Punk which bring us to this match, Punk comes out in street fight clothes and a new shirt, he also greets members of his family at ringside. The crowd is obviously pro-Punk since this is his hometown, Jericho gets the expected boos, the weapons come out, Punk hammers Chris with a kendo stick, Jericho tries running but gets a clothesline.

Chris does gain the advantage, sends him into the barricade scaring announcer Lillian Garcia (which was a funny moment to me), Punk hits some chops which get ""Wooooo's"" from the crowd. Jericho taunts him in front of his family leading to Punk's sister slapping Chris, then Punk turns it loose slamming Chris around the announce table, but Jericho hits him with a TV monitor then a piece of the announce table cover.

Punk does slip off the ropes and gets a kendo stick shot, Chris then brings out a beer pouring it on him, then grabs another but gets a kendo stick to the gut and a swinging neckbreaker. Punk hits the bulldog out of the corner, each counters the other's finisher, Punk hits the big elbow but only for two, but the crowd chants ""Randy Savage"". The GTS is countered again, Punk goes into a chair in the corner but kicks out of a roll-up at two, Jericho hits the Codebreaker, then locks on the Walls but Punk finally battles out of it, after using a fire exstinguisher.

Punk puts Jericho on the announce table and hits a huge diving elbow driving him through it, Punk ends up locking on the Anaconda Vice, Jericho grabs the kendo stick and beats Punk with it to get out of the hold. Jericho hits another Codebreaker using a chair but still just two, he taunts the crowd, sets up Punk for the GTS, Punk sends Jericho into an exposed turnbuckle, hits the GTS and covers to retain the title. 10/10.

-We see footage of the pre-show where Santino beat The Miz to retain his U.S. title.

-Beth is backstage and is told by Eve she's not medically cleared to compete in the Diva's title match, Eve says there will be a mystery opponent, but that its not Kharma which the crowd boos.

-WWE Diva's Championship Match, Nikki Bella (Champion) w/Brie Bella vs. Layla: Thats right after a year on the sidelines with an ACL injury, the brown, british bombshell Layla returns to action to a nice reaction, though the crowd does chant ""We Want Kharma"" some. Layla hits some nice moves, Nikki targets the braced knee with a low dropkick, Layla does come back with a nice springboard dive off the ropes. The Bellas try using Twin Magic but Layla hits a big neckbreaker on Brie and covers to win to title. 3/10.

-Laurenitis is backstage talking to Matt Striker and John says the matters he discussed with COO Triple H will be talked about on Raw and that they need to enjoy the main event tonight.

-Extreme Rules Match, John Cena vs. Brock Lesnar: The night after Wrestlemania Brock Lesnar made his WWE return and this is his first match back since Wrestlemania XX, he comes out in UFC style gear to a good amount of boos, Cena gets a chorus of boos as well. Brock hits a big takedown pounding Cena and busting him open on the top of his head, John locks on a front face lock but gets taken down again. The doctors are out to tend to the cut on Cena's head which angers the crowd big time, Lesnar beats up Cena some more and again the doctors tend to the cut causing more boos. John goes for the AA, but Brock hits two german suplexes then the ref gets knocked down, Lesnar keeps up the assault locks on an arm lock and sends him to the outside.

Brock brings the chain in, ties up Cena's legs and taunts him hitting a big clothesline, Cena gets tied up on the ring post by his legs and Brock targets the right arm slamming it into the ring apron. Cena tries battling back but gets sent into the steel steps, Lesnar throws the ref into the ring, hits the F-5 on Cena but the ref gets knocked down again, another comes down but just two, and Brock clotheslines him. Brock brings in the steel steps into the ring, Cena throws some punches but Brock locks on a Kimura and the steps but John won't quit and lifts him off the steps and slams him down.

Cena goes for the big leg drop but misses, Brock goes to jump off the steps over the ropes but takes a nasty spill in addition to sending John into the barricade. Lesnar tries for the dive again but gets a chain shot to the head, Cena is fired up and hits a massive AA onto the steel steps and covers to win. 7/10, cause of the rushed finish, would've been 10/10 if not for the quick finish. Cena then cuts a promo thanking the Chicago crowd for being great fans and saying that he may be going away for a while (whatever that means).

As the follow up to Wrestlemania 28 this was a solid PPV, the main event matches really told great stories and were given plenty of time to unfold and keep the crowd entertained. Extreme Rules is fast becoming a worthy PPV that fans need to tune in for as the hard hitting action really shows the hard work of a lot of the superstars.",1335657600,5,10749,4.389949748743718

The Tables match for IC title between Cody Rhodes & The Big Show while not a bad match,it has one of the dumbest endings to a Tables match,if not any match this side of WCW Uncensored but Big Show did end up giving the fans what they what in the end afterwards. The 2 out of 3 falls for the Worlds title between Daniel Bryan & Sheamus had good chian wrestling from Bryan and good brawling from of them and it really got intense in the end. The 2-on-1 Handicap match between Ryback against the team of Aaron Relic & Jay Hatton was a dumb,one-sided & pointless filler. The Chicago Street Fight for the WWE title between CM Punk & Chris Jericho was a hardcore,emotional,ECW-ish & intense bout. The Divas title match between Nikki Bella & Layla(Subbing for Beth Phoenix) was pretty good for a Divas title match.

EXTREME RULES 2012

Back in Chicago WWE would return and return with an Extreme event. This event would see the return of Brock Lesnar as he would take on ""The Face of the Company"" John Cena. Also WWE Champion CM Punk would return home to battle Y2J in what was probably my favorite match.

1.[FALLS COUNT ANYWHERE]KANE VS RANDY ORTON-really good opening match that was a part of a good feud for these two. I had liked that they involved the fathers [R.I.P. William] in the storyline and how Kane didn't care. They brawl all over the place from the ring to the crowd all the way to the back. Great moments involving different weapons happen all throughout the match but it leads to Orton winning the match, personally I felt Kane should have taken this one.

2. DOLPH ZIGGLER VS BRODUS CLAY-one of the better matches Clay has had even still today and I think that has a lot to do with his opponent. Clay of course delivered with the power in this match but it was Ziggler that looked the best in my opinion. Better match then I had been expecting at the time. Clay wins this since he was still new with the gimmick.

3.[I-C TITLE TABLES MATCH]BIG SHOW VS CODY RHODES-this was a decent match between these two though they have had better. Big Show really lays it on Cody here in this match dominating for most of it. Cody does pull off some good moves and his win here as he makes Show slip into the table was new. Not the best match from the two but not horrible, the aftermath of the match had the crowd going.

4.[WORLD TITLE 2 OUT OF 3 FALLS MATCH]SHEAMUS VS DANIEL BRYAN-great match here between these two and the match that we should have got at Mania in my opinion. Both guys give a great performance that would have been better showcased at the ""showcase of the immortals"". The crowd was into this and seemed like they were behind Bryan a lot here. Bryan worked on wearing Sheamus down throughout the match as Sheamus was more of the brawler. Great back and forth encounter with Sheamus getting the first fall and Bryan taking the second. As it came down to the third I had a feeling about who was going to win this one, and of course I was right. Sheamus ends up winning it not to long after the second fall and keeps the belt, personally I wanted Bryan to win.

5. RYBACK VS JAY HATTON & AARON RELIC-this was just another squash match that was meant to make Ryback look even more impressive. It is honestly nothing more than that.

6.[WWE TITLE STREET FIGHT]CM PUNK VS CHRIS JERICHO-this might be my favorite match of the night as these two really seemed like they hated each other. This of course was the street fight in Punk's home town so of course the crowd was behind him. Like any good street fight this match goes all over the place and different weapons were used. Both men come off looking good here with each dominating at certain points in the match. The fans were really into this one especially when Punk delivered that Macho Man elbow drop onto the table. Great match between these two that reminded me of older days. After a great back and forth match and some cool counters Punk gets the win after he makes Y2J GTS.

7.[DIVAS TITLE]NIKKI BELLA VS LAYLA-Beth was supposed to get the rematch she wanted here but no such luck. Therefore a mystery opponent was to be announced, that of course was Layla. This was a quick match that showcased Layla really well as she looked good in her return. She wins the title even with the Twins cheating.

8.[EXTREME RULES]BROCK LESNAR VS JOHN CENA-I remember actually being excited for this match because it felt like a big time fight. The WWE ""face of the company"" Cena taking on a returning monster that he once clashed with back in the day. Now this match was basically Brock destroying Cena with only moments of John coming back. Sure the outcome was Cena winning but this really was all about selling Brick as a destroyer. In this match we would see Cena smashed, refs bashed, and the fans clash [see what I did there]. For those who watch wrestling they know what I am talking about with the fans. Any way Brock looks great here even in defeat. He works over Cena's arm of course looking for the kimura. There was one part that looked real crazy as Lesnar went over the top rope, you will see. Personally I would have liked to see Brock get the win but maybe this sets up something down the line. They did try to make this a MMA themed fight but that is ok since Brock has that background although it was relatively short.

This was a great event and I actually liked every match on the card, one of the best of 2012. Things from this event would go on and others were ended which is what any event should do.",1365033600,2,4679,4.380184331797235

Cena vs Lesnar was a good match also.

Okay, I won't go there, but you know what I mean:here comes another guy out of retirement who thinks he can just step into the ring after being away for years. I was so happy he lost!

Yes, I will buy this PPV just to watch Lesnar get the hell beat out of him. If Triple H does it to  Lesnar then I may buy that one.

Edge makes a special appearance on Raw one week to wake Cena up before he goes into Extreme Rules, Cena is clearly outmatched, overpowered and faces his doom but he faces his most dangerous opponent head on.....but wait, there is more.

Extreme Rules 2012, which is basically the aftermath of Wrestlmania 28 or as I like to call it ""Wrestlemania Revenge 2012"" begins with:

Randy Orton vs Kane, falls count anywhere match.

The Viper wanted revenge on Kane and he took the brawl all over the arena, Zack Ryder, one of Kane's favorite punching bags, gets a measure of revenge by attacking Kane backstage and Orton nails Kane with an RKO on top of a steel chair, Orton wins. Good match, Overall 3/5

Brodus Clay vs Dolph Ziggler

The Show Off gets squashed by the Funkasaurus, it was a very entertaining and short match, brings back memories of WWE Superstars back in the late 1980s and early 1990s era. Jack Swagger helps Ziggler but his efforts still lead to Ziggler's loss and thus creating more fractures in their partnership. Overall 2/5

Big Show (IC champ) vs Cody Rhodes, Table Match for the Intercontinental Title

After Big Show had his Wrestlemania moment, he decided to give Cody a taste of his medicine and taunt him about his loss. Cody swore revenge and predicted he will regain his title. Show dominated with his strength and punished Rhodes throughout the match. However Big Show would become a victim of happenstance when he tried to re-enter the ring, Cody seized his moment and dropkicked Show's leg causing him to lose his balance and step on a table outside the ring (meant for Cody) but Show's weight caused him to break the table and thus Rhodes regained his title. After all, the first wrestler to go through a table loses the match, Rhodes' move caused Show to break through a table, Show beat up Rhodes and soured his victory, slowly the angry giant begins to emerge (to be continued.) Overall 3/5

Ryback vs 2 jobbers

Ryback or as he is known to wrestling fans as Ryberg (hardcore wrestling fans compare Ryback's style of wrestling to Bill Goldberg, attend any live event in which Ryback is wrestling and you will hear the crowd's chant or ""Goldberg"" or recently as ""Ryberg""). Ryback squashes 2 jobbers....the end. Overall 2/5  (one star per jobber)

Nikki Bella vs Layla, Divas championship.

The lovely Bella twins come out to the ring and await their mystery opponent since Beth Phoenix is not cleared to wrestle that night and out comes the equally lovely Layla. Layla finally gets her chance to shine (without Michelle McCool) and despite their best efforts, the Bellas manage to bungle their attempts to outsmart Layla with a bait and switch tactic but Layla nails Brie (Nikki slipped out and switched with Brie) with a neckbreaker for the win and title. Overall 3/5 (I know I am being generous with that one but I was happy Layla returned).

Sheamus (champ) vs Daniel Bryan, 2 out of 3 falls match

Finally, the match people were waiting for since Wrestlemania, Bryan's agility and intelligence nullifies Sheamus' power and intensity, but Byran's rage got him disqualifed (Sheamus 1, Bryan 0) but Bryan went to work on Sheamus' weaken shoulder earlier in the match and while he got himself DQ by not releasing his Yes lock on Sheamus, once the second fall began, Bryan reapplies the Yes lock and Sheamus slips into unconsciousness and Bryan evens the tide (Sheamus 1, Bryan 1) so the last fall begins with Sheamus nailing a half powered Brogue kick to Bryan's face. Both men were exhausted and weak but kept tearing at each other but Sheamus finally summoned up the reserves and Brogue kicked Bryan for the final fall and victory (Sheamus 2, Bryan 1). Overall 3.5/5

CM Punk (champ) vs Chris Jericho, Chicago street fight

Jericho kept up his verbal attacks on Punk after Wrestlemania and Punk finally wanted Jericho in a match where he can freely pummel him and knock his lights out, thus the championship match in a street fight. Punk unleashed his fury on Jericho and Punk's family were ringside to watch, Jericho pulled out all the stops and poured beer on Punk but all of Chicago were behind Punk and he rallied for the win, Punk celebrated with the crowd and got everybody fired up for the main event. Overall 4.5/5

John Cena vs Brock Lesnar, Extreme rules match.

This is it folks, the match we were waiting for all night, Brock entered the ring to both fear and admiration from the crowd. John Cena entered to his usual crowd (half love him, half hate him) but he charged head on and wore his classic chain necklace to the match, Lesnar was dressed for an MMA fight and he clearly enjoyed putting the fear and pain in Cena. Cena charged Lesnar who took him down with a doubld leg sweep and landed heavy shots to Cena's head, once separated, the damage was done and Cena was bleeding, the match was on pause with Lesnar enjoying every moment of it, Cena and Lesnar fought again and Brock targeted Cena's wound and caused more bleeding, Brock tore down Cena, he hung Cena upside down on the turnbuckles and mauled him, Lesnar used the steel steps to brutally beat Cena but nothing was more fierce than Lesnar's fists. Cena did stun Brock a few times but Brock's unparalleled rage and fury allowed him to punish Cena further. If the Bane vs Batman fight in the Dark Knight Rises is anything like this, it will be hard for people to see their hero get beat down so relentlessly and with out mercy. Lesnar applied his kimura lock on Cena and wounded his arm but Cena managed to break the hold, Lesnar proceeded to beat Cena outside the ring again, Lesnar went for another offensive move but Cena had wrapped his fist with the chain he brought eariler and nailed Lesnar on the head, the great unstoppable beast was stunned and his head busted opened. Cena capitalized on Brock's wound and hit the Attitude Adjustment on the steel steps for the victory. John Cena nursed a wounded arm, a wounded head but he held his head high as Laurinaitis' unstoppable enforcer failed in destroying him, Cena got thrashed, mauled, crushed, trampled and brutalized but he is still standing. Afterwards, Cena announces he will take a break (which is doesn't) and thanks the crowd and those of us at home for the support. Overall 4/5

In case you are wondering why such a high rating, well that match had everything going for it and delivered. Cena had promised to win over the Rock at Wrestlemania and failed, John Laurinaitis wanted to destroy Cena and sent the most brutal enforcer to tear him down and let's face it, Lesnar succeeded, Cena was beaten up before the event and during most of the match, while the crowd booed during the small pause to check on Cena's head wound, deep down, everybody hoped the match would continue because either you booed Cena and hoped Lesnar would beat him up some more or you cheered for Cena and hoped he would overcome this latest challenge. Great hero and great villain, Cena's journey does not end here and would continue in Over the Limit and No Way Out, but that is another story.

Dvd is bare bones by the way but with this event, you wouldn't need anymore.",1341878400,,7695,4.669128508124077

In more detail:

Orton vs. Kane: OK falls count anywhere match, but as I'm not really a fan of either guy I was a bit bored here. *1/2

Clay vs. Ziggler: A showcase for Clay with Ziggler doing the usual and bouncing all over the place.  A couple nice spots, but two short to be much. *1/2

IC title - Show vs. Rhodes: A very short tables match with a unique ending that I didn't mind, but a lot of people will hate.  **

Sheamus vs. Bryan: A great two out of three falls encounter finally showing what these two can do together.  My personal favorite of the night. ****1/2

Ryback vs. two jobbers:  Yep.  You know what you're getting here.

Punk vs Jericho: Slow start but built into a frenzy by the end.  Some neat uses of the street fight stipulation. ***3/4

Bella vs. ???: They took the belt off Beth Phoenix for THIS surprise?!  Not what was expected, and not a good match.  Zero stars.

Lesnar vs. Cena: An intense, brutal, unusual style match which is brought down by a couple of drawn out stoppages due to blood and an out-of-nowhere finish.  ****1/4

8511981,4,B0077PTWZK,"Thanks to a DVD rental I was able to check out Extreme Rules 2012 as the main feuds from WrestleMania were carried on here with gimmick matches but also the return of Brock Lesnar.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Randy Orton vs Kane. This feud took another turn with both men using their fathers for the psychological warfare only to get mixed results (check out the opening video to prove my point). Both men started off brawling as you would expect with the fight being taken into the crowd, onto the stage, into the backstage area with Zack Ryder getting his shots in on Kane allowing Orton to come back with a reverse back breaker. They made their way back to the ring with a steel chair & the steel steps coming into play along with impactful moves such as Orton delivering a DDT from the announce table, Kane's chokeslam to even an RKO on the chair itself. This was tons better than the match that they had WrestleMania & an entertaining opener to kick off the show with the crowd really getting into it towards the end.

Brodus Clay vs Dolph Ziggler. Despite Ziggler being the heel, he had the crowd support from the vocal Chicago fans. Ziggler was tryingn to use his speed & attempt to control Clay while having him down but Clay kept recovering which lead to Ziggler rolling away to buy some time. Dolph was again able to get some offense in before Clay's size would prove to be a determining factor. This was one of those matches that can be classified as a squash but I'll give Ziggler credit in that he worked hard to make the match as best as he could with even the crowd realizing that in supporting Ziggler.

Tables Match: Intercontinental Champion Big Show vs Cody Rhodes. This was similar to their WrestleMania match in which Show had the power advantage with Cody trying to come up with as much offense as he could despite the odds and the stipulations of the match working against him. However it was move that Cody was able to do that actually was a judgment call that was such a shock to Show that he snapped & put Cody through two tables including one on the outside. This match wasn't much past the stipulation & Show doing what he did afterwards.

2 Out Of 3 Falls: World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus vs Daniel Bryan. After back to back WrestleManias of both men being denied to have an actual match with their last match being 18 seconds, they got to have an actual one here with one thing to mention in that even though Bryan was trying to heel the crowd, he was the clear favorite here while Sheamus had a mixed reaction. Right from the start, Sheamus tried to make ""history repeat itself"" with the kick but this time Bryan was more than aware about it before both men went hold for hold with Sheamus not only using his power but also using submissions of his own such as a unique version of the boston crab. Bryan was able to work on Sheamus' shoulder with his series of kicks, the use of the ringpost & even a hammerlock slam before picking things up with aggression that might have worked against him but accomplished his goal in wearing Sheamus down. However that aggression came back to get Bryan as he seemed focused on punishing Sheamus & seemed in the driver's seat before leaving an open for that to change. This was the wrestling clinic that we should have gotten at WrestleMania that had both men leaving with more respect than they did the last time.

Ryback vs Aaron Relic & Jay Hatton. A bonus match here in what was nothing more than a dominate squash for Ryback who had chants of Goldberg directed towards him in the process.

Street Fight: WWE Champion CM Punk vs Chris Jericho. Their WrestleMania match was about putting on a wrestling clinic but this one took a different turn as it got personal with Jericho bringing up Punk's family history of alcoholism while I should point out that Punk's family was at ringside & that it was a year prior in the same building that Punk won the title in his hometown of Chicago. As I said their previous match was a wrestling clinic, this was a fight with both men coming out in street clothes with weapons being brought in like a kendo stick, a beer bottle & the steel steps. The brawl got taken to the outside with Jericho taunting Punk's family to the point where Punk's sister slapped Jericho along with Punk delivering a sick elbow drop onto the announce table from the top rope. They settled back in the ring using other weapons like a steel chair for their usual moves & even bringing in a fire extinguisher for a counter that I don't think I have ever seen prior. Even though I really enjoyed their WrestleMania match, they were able to top that match with a completely different match & a tell a story along the way with Punk's sister's involvement adding to what was just a physical fight between these two.

Divas Champion Nikki Bella vs Layla. With Beth Phoenix being out with an injury, the returning Layla took her place in this one. This didn't last long as it was kept short but both divas performed well here as Layla looked great after being out for a year while Nikki added more to her style by attacking the injured knee. The finish was something to see as the twins tried to use their identity switch only for that to backfire with one heck of neckbreaker by Layla.

Extreme Rules: Brock Lesnar vs John Cena. Lesnar's first match back in WWE since WrestleMania XX but also the second time that these two men have faced off after WrestleMania with the other time being Backlash 2003. Brock came out in his UFC/MMA gear while Cena actually wore his old chain & lock that we haven't seen since 2005. You got the direction that this match was going in from the start as Cena charged at Lesnar with Lesnar responding with a takedown followed by a series of vicious elbows that busted Cena open followed by a stiff clothesline from Lesnar causing the match to be stopped twice to check on Cena. From there, Cena tried rushing again & got a takedown on Brock but Brock just used his power followed by a series of belly to belly suplexes before going back to work on the cut. Lesnar was ruthless in his approach as he targeted Cena's ribs, then his arm to the point where he even tied Cena up in the corner with Cena's chain just to beat on him some more. The match really was starting to get out of control as Brock brought in the steel steps into the ring, applying a kimura before Cena slammed Brock onto them to counter & even attempted to execute his top rope leg drop only to miss & hit the corner of the steps while several referees were attacked by Brock whether accidently or intential. However just like Daniel Bryan earlier, Brock's aggression got the best of him as Cena was able to use his chain to bust Lesnar open & use of the steel steps based off one mistake Lesnar made. Now I'll be honest in that I wasn't a big fan of the finish due to the match being very one-sided ending with a fluke but in this case, it actually worked the story here well as Brock was just a monster, destructing everything in sight with Cena needing to catch a break to turn the tide.

Overall, this was quite the shock to me as this show just clicked from the top main matches all being standouts & topping the WrestleMania performances while the short matches were watchable along with extra credit to the great Chicago crowd just being red hot from start to finish makes this the standout event for the WWE in 2012 that I recommend checking out.",1382572800,,7435,4.441025641025641
