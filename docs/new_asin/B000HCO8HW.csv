8138472,4,B000HCO8HW,"Truthfully, when I first watched this in my 20's I was a bit immature. I was basically expecting soft porn with some techniques for me and my partner to learn from. If you want that I would suggest some tasteful erotic entertainment like Viv Thomas Productions (where the orgasms are actually real and the women look like they are really pleasing each other. not that saddistic/masochists junk that is catered to men anyway)

To enjoy this DVD I think you have to be on a spiritual path or have at least an introduction to the spiritual side of sex. The focus is about the sacredness of sex. It is possible. This DVD is an opportunity to become flexible in another way of thinking.

If your not of that mindset or at least open to new possibilities then you will probably react to this dvd the way my immature lesbian friends did when I attempted to show them this documentary. (Unfortunately, like 10 year olds playing the cootie shot game) I am in my 30's now and they were in their 20's.  Their idea of love is somewhat shallow, reactive, and very l-wordish. Sigh. I won't ding them too much on that. They are young and they just have a lot of growing to do and I know in time some of them will figure it out.

Most women unfortunately do not understand their own sexuality and what pleases them. Period. Gay or Straight. I would say watch this movie if you enjoy the idea of hearing women talk of their own take on sex and their journey to celebrate it. Tantric to me is a just a label of philosophies and ideas of what sex can help you accomplish. It's a frame of mind. Sex can totally be a healing experience. Sex isn't dirty or nasty like religion (or even the freakin' porn industry)teaches us. Oi Vey!

However there are a lot of cultural stigmas that will take time to erase and heal. Connecting with a spiritual side to sex, I believe is part of the many lessons (if you pay attention) taught in this DVD. Spirituality means lots of things to different folk. It's up to you to decide that. Although, how I experience spirituality is there is a sense of wholeness, peace and heartfelt love. I wish that for everyone on their journey.

And I believe I'm still pretty young and youthful and have much to learn, but the comment about the ""hippies"" was unfortunately my first response. I have to disagree with another comment ""that you learn nothing."" You can learn a lot. After entering my 30's and having enough lesbian heartache I can appreciate this DVD for its true essence. Learn to [love yourself] and then you will find great satisfaction in sex because I believe you will attract a partner that will find you just as [sacred] as you find them.

This documentary is just a starting point in allowing you to find better joy and satisfaction in your physical experience in this world. I would recommend studying many things that will assist you in understanding your sexuality. Like energy work, yoga, chakras, NLP, meditation, Huna, Abraham Hicks, Law of attraction etc.

Some may not be ready for this dvd. There are layers missing. The women in this dvd have years of experience between them and you really can't put it all in one dvd. There is a scene where one of the main speakers does this intense fire breathe orgasm technique. This is a true meditation and alignment of the body and senses. It takes years of learning about yourself and practice to get to this place.

Forgive me for putting this simply but great sex is just a [practiced] mindset! Study and learn what you like about what pleases you. Be kind and gentle with yourself. That in and of itself with be healing. I repeat, love yourself and I promise you, you will find sexual enlightenment and so much more.

Bravo to the film makers for being trend setters. The film is certainly a bit choppy and slow in some parts but they get tremendous credit for putting this out there. I needed to hear some of these stories. Unfortunately, there isn't yet lots of documentaries for us lesbians to learn and create safe spaces to dialog about an age old (and still taboo) topic. This will take time as the world begins to shift in consciousness. I would add this to your collection. If your ready for it.

Good luck.",1293667200,10,4191,4.508563899868248
8138473,1,B000HCO8HW,"This movie is a complete waste of money. You think when you purchase it that you will learn some new and exciting techniques. WRONG! The entire movie is a bunch of OLD HIPPIES talking about how great tantra is but NEVER once explain any of the basics of the method. A total waste of time. They even went so far as to put in some OLD porn star to talk about it. Again, you learn nothing from this dvd.",1231286400,18,400,4.075949367088608
8138474,5,B000HCO8HW,"A smashing hit in many gay & lesbian film festivals worldwide, HCO is the best gift your can give your (lesbian) lover! You don't have to be a Yoga expert to enjoy it . It is very informative and entertaining. Women of all ages will learn specific techniques (live demonstrations included!) along with the history and the philosophy behind lesbian tantra yoga. Don't miss it!",1221436800,2,375,4.7846153846153845
8138475,5,B000HCO8HW,"This DVD is definitely more of an overview than specific instructional, but it's an excellent and inspiring overview that piqued my interest and made me think: I sure would like a little more of that in my life! Yes, some of the women interviewed are a little new-agey, but if you get past that (or, of course, if that's your thing) the sincerity in their voices and testimonies really shines through. Of course this DVD will have special resonance for lesbian women, but I'm straight and still came away from it with a lot of great information (the most important being that the relationship you need to focus on first is the one with yourself.)

ETA: The 'Special Features' area does offer some more specific instructional sections/demonstrations, but you'd probably want to pick up a different DVD or book to really learn the practice and exercises.",1214006400,3,852,4.835616438356165
8138476,5,B000HCO8HW,"This brave documentary gives a glimpse into the lesbian tantric world. For the first time, tantric principles and exercises are laid out for our community. The film presents 3 different teachers, and gives a good foundation of tantric history and how to apply its principles to the gay and lesbian community.

Even if one never fully adopts a ""tantric lifestyle"" this film will expand your notions of both what tantra is -- much more than the mere sexual applications -- and what true partnership can be. It encourages us to slow down and take time ...... whether it is during the act of sex itself, or buy actually ""scheduling"" time on a daily basis to connect to our loved ones. Pretty sound advise I think. Further, the exercises designed to help one connect with ones own sexual energy and be able to move that energy -- through breath work, etc. -- gives us tools for healing past wounds as well as fighting things like ""lesbian bed death."" All and all very powerful in its possibilities.",1206662400,12,993,4.674285714285714
8138477,5,B000HCO8HW,"After taking workshops in which I was the only gay person/couple in the group, this video was a refreshing reminder that tantra works for same-sex couples too.  This DVD is a great intro to tantra for the gay crowd and after watching it I immediately signed up for one of Pamela's workshops.  She's a wonderful tantrika and I'd highly recommend both the DVD and her workshops.",1194912000,8,376,4.681818181818182
8138478,3,B000HCO8HW,"This video is more what I would call an educational documentary on tantra, almost clinical.  It was really not what I expected given other reviews.  Very 'New Age' and somewhat educational, I've already given it to a new agey friend who may get more from it than I did.",1170892800,9,269,4.469387755102041
