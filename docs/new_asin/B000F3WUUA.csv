8117075,5,B000F3WUUA,"This is a regular length very funny film about a group of Koreans taking an elementary English language course. Although not quite at the level of ""May Sassy Girl"" it is a highly enjoyable movie. The two main characters, a day dreaming female public service worker and a male shoe salesman, slowly develop a relationship that blossoms into a deep love. The woman who is a bit ditzy, falls for the man first and eventually wins him over. The supporting cast, which includes a very pretty Australian instructor, are all rather ditzy themselves. All in all a fast moving, highly amusing story with a load of very likable characters. The animation is cute and the credits at the end are really fun.",1253491200,2,694,4.69672131147541
8117076,5,B000F3WUUA,"This movie is Hilarious!  I'm an American pie type of girl that speaks Korean and lived in Korea for a year.  I thought this movie was funny before I moved there and then saw it again while living there and it was sooo much more funnier.  I showed it to my friend living in Korea who doesn't speak much Korean besides the ""beer please"" kind of phrases I taught him, and he absolutely loved it.  I think the rest of his time in Korea he would quote parts in it and told all the americans he met over here to watch it b/c it explained a lot about the culture and Koreans trying to learn English.  This is a great movie for anyone but so much more for those that understand how difficult it is learning another language or not knowing one but needing to know another.  Has english subtitles and english audio",1241136000,,805,4.228758169934641

Jang Hyuk can make me laugh even in dramatic roles but he's wonderful in this.  It's a lot more funny when you speak English yourself and can have a few extra giggles over the bad English",1230163200,3,301,4.084745762711864
8117078,4,B000F3WUUA,"I really enjoyed this film and after a friend showed me the movie I immediatley sought to add it to my own collection. It is a wonderfully endearing comedy and I would recommend it to anyone. Its not an artful master piece like the Jet Li movies, which is why I gave it 4 stars instaed of 5, but it is a great, unique film which made me laugh and cry.",1221782400,,351,3.9577464788732395

PTME is the story of an airheaded, but impulsive girl who works in a public office. Out of bad luck she is forced by her coworkers to take an English class to better communicate with the Western customers.
In the class she takes on the nickname Candy and meets a boy named Elvis. Elvis is a player, constantly hitting on beautiful women. But secretly he is taking English classes so he can communicate with his sister, who was long ago adopted by a family in America. Needless to say, Candy falls head over heels in love with Elvis, while the latter thinks her nothing beyond normal.
PTME is a cute, cute movie, whimsical in the same sense as Amelie. Candy is a bit of an airhead, and we often get her perspective of things. For example when taking a level entrance exam she imagines herself battling a'la Mortal Kombat.
 In fact what really helps carry the movie from start to finish is Candy herself. She's so affable, you want to see her make it through to the end.
The supporting cast is just as wonderful. The English teacher, though a bit harsh at first, finally opens up, and even Elvis soon comes around.
That being said, the movie did have some quirks. Some people may have problems with the way the movie jumps around. It goes from a comedy to a drama rather quickly, and the transistion isn't always smooth. The whimsiness of the film is dropped in the second half, and there are some horribly cliche movie moments (in particular, the subway scene at the end).
Even so, the comedy translates well for both the English and Korean viewer (I laughed or smiled through almost the whole movie). And the scene where Elvis, his sister and mother finally reconcile is the most touching moment. And if you watch the ending credits you will see an epilogue on all the students that puts a pretty bow on this package.
To make a long story short, don't judge the movie by the cheesy jacket. It's a funny, feel good movie, all around.",1182729600,3,1974,4.589235127478753
