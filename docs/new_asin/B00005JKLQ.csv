1432872,1,B00005JKLQ,"I guess i can't complain too much. I saw this movie for free while I was over seas in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. That was the only good thing about this movie. I love comedies, but this was hardly one. I can recall laughing only a few times throughout the entire movie. It was unrealistic, and hard to believe. The first 10-15 minutes actually decieved me into believing that this might actually turn ou decent, but I was horribly wrong. It seemed to drag on for hours. The plot was dry and predictable, and the acting was mediocre. Too many scenes seemed, well, forced. I applaud the effort to demoralize societies judgment system on ""attractiveness"", but maby they should have put more effort into making a quality film.
In summary i would probably never watch this film again unless I was bed-ridden, could not reach the remote and it was playing on TBS some Sunday 5 years down the road...but that wouldn't happen because they actually play good movies on TBS Sunday.",1023408000,3,973,4.630057803468208
1432873,3,B00005JKLQ,"This movie has a feel-good message, making it enjoyable enough for three stars. It says that we all deserve to be loved even if we're not physically attractive (in what it considers the ""conventional"" sense). But will it really change anything of what it deems mere ""convention""? Will Gwyneth Paltrow go on being an advocate for the inner beauty of obese people and others ""conventionally"" unattractive? I kind of think not. Her performance here is significant and may display genuine talent. But most likely her future roles will reflect a sense of glamour in slimness as much as ever, meaning nothing was really changed by the movie. Similarly, will Jack Black, after his similarly impressive performance be any more inclined than before to accept an obese woman as a girlfriend? I similarly doubt that. For all its feel-good message, SHALLOW HAL builds us up for a let-down when we realize its lack of realism. Many of us will go on with our inner beauty as underappreciated as ever because of outer appearances, and will still find hard to swallow that suggestion that prevalent standards of beauty run no deeper than convention.",1023062400,45,1133,4.93717277486911
1432874,1,B00005JKLQ,"The Farrelly brothers are known for tasteless comedy.  No problem with that.  But they too often revel in pure stupidity, which has merits alone, and THEN throw in moments of reflection, vomit-inducing happy songs, and a ""deep"" meaning so that we feel better after laughing at fat people, handicapped people, etc.
This film is offensive to your intelligence.  Cheap audience manipulation at its worst.  It forces you to stare at only one of the most beautiful actresses in film in Paltrow, but then be reminded that she is a 400 lb. porker who, and let's face it, most men wouldn't give the time of day in terms of a relationship.  And of course our protagonist falls for her, despite her weighing in just under Connecticut.  Let's face it, if Jack Black was YOUR friend (and thank God he isn't) you would have him committed before he hooked this one.
This is yet another Farrelly contribution to the laughing at... handicapped, disfigured people, fat people, etc.  Hey, you wanna make a movie about that, fine.  People will watch it, because sometimes EVERYONE is a jerk.  But when they try to throw in a good lesson, and any kind of mush involving FEELINGS after we've watched a 5th grade-level joke, it's offensive to any thinking adult.
Go and rent Kingpin instead.  At least that had the least amount of mush in it and plenty of laugh-out-loud dumb jokes.  Otherwise, stay far, far away from this thing.",1022544000,7,1408,4.729508196721311
1432875,4,B00005JKLQ,"""Shallow Hal"" (2001)
I will admit the rumours are true. The Farrelly's are going a little softer. Me, Myself and Irene and There's Something About Mary were quite sickening, but Shallow Hal comes a little more from the heart. While I enjoyed the Farrelly brothers' gross-out phase very much, I am immensely enjoy seeing them become less crude and try something new.
The performances in this movie are the best thing in Shallow Hall, even though the Farrelly's directing is fabulous (their directing may be a result of the performances though). Jack Black gets his first full-on leading role and makes his character seem both shallow and sensitive. Jason Alexander doesn't do his best with this performance, and one of his twists in the story is probably the worst aspect of the film, but he still manages to make us chuckle a little. Gwyneth Paltrow is the magic in the movie. Paltrow embodies her amazingly nice and ferociously fat character with warmth and depth. When she smiles, I smile. When she cries...well, I almost cried. And come on, this is from the Farrelly brothers! Not the response you think of when you hear the phrase ""from the directors of Dumb & Dumber and There's Something About Mary"", but this movie's performances work wonders thank to its dedicated cast and directing efforts.
The script in the film is of constant high quality. The idea was very original and the lead characters quite developed. The laughs in this movie were very funny and give the movie its crude humour. I actually preferred the romance in the movie. It felt less forced and not as fast as the jokes, the romance was very built up in the film. However the comedy was an important aspect of the film and the movie wouldn't have worked just as a romantic drama.
Shallow Hal's message comes across wonderfully. This movie is all about seeing the inner-beauty in people and not just looking on the outside for their personalities. This moral is given across very cleverly and clearly, and if you come out of the film and you see an overweight person you might have second thoughts about judging them on their appearance. I thought it was wonderful how this movie brought this point across, and it worked for me on a personal level.
Despite the excellence of the performances and message in the movie, there were flaws. As I mentioned earlier in this review, Jason Alexander's twist (won't ruin it in here) was just stupid, although it did make me fall on the ground with laughter, it was just silly. Some of the movie is quite predictable, and the hypnosis story could've been done better. Possible spoilers - After saying 5 words, a person wouldn't just click back into reality. Apart from that, the hypnotism idea did bring the point of the film across nicely sometimes, but the way Hal started seeing things normally again after Alexander's character saying 5 words to him over a cell phone is a little disappointing.
The thing that puts Shallow Hal's flaws aside is its touching story. With some flat faults, I would usually give a film a B, but this movie will get higher than that because it showed the true feelings of loneliness and depression when obesity is involved. This movie is truly touching, uproariously funny and one of the best comedies of 2001. Oh, and did I mention Gwyneth Paltrow wears nothing more than a thong in one scene? Now, tell me, how could you possibly resist?

1432876,4,B00005JKLQ,"THis is indeed a funny movie, trying also to give a message about prejudiced and shallow people who only cares about beauty and fashion (a common thing in our days). But, in paradox, Gwyneth is so marvellous and beautiful here, that the only thing you wish is to be with someone as wonderful as Gwyneth!!! Just joking...

1432944,3,B00005JKLQ,Jack Black plays a man who only sees the outer beauty of women.  After being stuck on an elevator with a self help guru he is hypnotized into seeing the inner beauty.  He meets a girl who he falls head over heels for not realizng she is a 300 plus pound woman.  Played by Gwyneth Paltrow who is very good playing the woman with self doubt and self image problems.  Jason Alexander plays his best friend and is even more superficial then him.  It's a very good movie with a lot of humor and a very good moral.,1518739200,,508,4.142857142857143
1432945,4,B00005JKLQ,"The idea of the movie is fantastic, something I would wish for a lot of people: to be able to see the inner beauty of a person reflected in their outward appearance, even though the person may not be beautiful in conventional or shallow standards. Lots of laughs, moral lesson learned, and a happy ending. Seeing Tony Robbins as the guru who gives Hal this power is quite apt and adds a highlight to the movie.",1518307200,,410,4.407894736842105

1433034,3,B00005JKLQ,"One thing I'm curious about in this movie is how the other characters in the movie (and even the title suggests) make such a fuss about Hal being shallow, but no one seems to care about other guys and women in this movie being so shallow too. Women in the movie are being shallow to Hal and his buddy Jason Alexander, such as in the club or at the frat party. It seems that way in real life too, that women, especially pretty women get away with being as shallow as they want, and everyone thinks it's OK, maybe that's the reason why pretty women are now more shallow than ever. If a parent tells their kid it's OK to smash dishes, the kid will only start smashing dishes even more.

Jason Alexander's character in ""Shallow Hal"" was also shallow, even more shallow than Hal. Maybe the reason was because women rejected him and Hal so shallowly, that it gave him the ticket to be real shallow also. And I personally agree, if someone is rude to you, do NOT react by being nice or you'll look bad, and you'll look like a doormat. If someone is rude, then be rude back. It will help you look a little better. When a hot woman is rude to an ugly guy, the ugliest thing is to see the ugly keep being so nice to her and kissing her ass like a doormat. People in general do not respect doormats in the 21st century. ""Kill em with kindness"" is oldfashioned thinking now. Anyway, Hal was not the only shallow one, Jason and many different women were also being shallow in this movie. So were several other guys when seeing Gweneth Paltrow's ample figure, such as the guys in the restaurant saying ""too late, look like the foods gone"" when seeing Gweneth. Also, the taxi driver's nasty facial expression after Hal told a looks challenged woman that she was beautiful, the woman who was going to spend the summer taking care of her grandma. I personally think it's very sad how it seems only the less attractive do things like devote alot of time to their grandparents or join the peace corps (which Gweneth does in this movie). The beautiful women  don't do any of that kind good hearted stuff because a) hot women are not good hearted, and b), hot women want to spend their time partying and picking up (good looking only) men. As Jason very correctly and tells Hal at one point ""beautiful women are not nice, well not nice to someone like us"".

They should've called this movie ""Shallow men and women"", or "" Shallow people"". I guess though that they called this movie ""shallow Hal"" because the main plot is about Hal learning (or at least bring hypnotized by Tony Robbins) to see Gweneth Paltrow for who she really is, as a beauty underneath, instead of as an overweight image. Tony should've used his hypnotizing power on alot of other people in this movie too.",1506643200,,2754,4.428007889546351

It's a stretch to think that any woman would date Hal let alone take him back after what he did.

1433485,3,B00005JKLQ,"This movie didn't quite make sense.

In the beginning of the movie, it is firmly established that Shallow Hal (Jack Black) is only interested in women for their looks. The ones with good looks. And then one day he bumps into the famous and popular personal growth expert and life coach, Tony Robbins (played by the real-life Tony Robbins).

Tony decides that Hal's shallow interest in women is impeding his personal growth, so Tony hypnotizes Hal so that he will be attracted to women solely for their inner beauty.

So, from that point on, due to the hypnosis, Hal is supposed to be attracted to women only for their inner beauty.

But that doesn't happen. It appears he goes right back to being attracted to women only for their looks, except for now he is only imagining they are physically attractive.

Yeah, yeah, I realize that these women's good looks are supposed to be nothing more than the physical manifestation of their inner beauty; but, dammit, why do they have to physically manifest their inner beauty? It still appears as if it weren't for their physical beauty, he wouldn't be pursuing them, so it's as if he's right back to square one, right?

But at any rate, Hal meets up with Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), an extremely fat girl who appears to be physically beautiful to Hal due to his hypnosis, and he falls for her big time (no pun intended).

In the meantime, Hal's best buddy and roommate, Mauricio (Jason Alexander), is disgusted with Hal for dating and falling for a fat girl; so he seeks out Tony Robbins and convinces him to dehypnotize Hal, which he does.

So how does Hal react to that? Shortly thereafter, Hal encounters a little girl from a hospital pediatric burn unit, whom he had met before but because of his hypnosis she appeared physically pretty to him. But Hal is now dehypnotized, so he sees the little girl's burn scars for the first time; but he doesn't focus on the scars, instead he focuses on the little girl's inner beauty. This motivates Hal to seek out Rosemary - the real, fat Rosemary, because he now believes he can appreciate Rosemary for her inner beauty as well. He tracks her down, and lo and behold, he is able to see beyond her heft and focus on her inner beauty.

You know, it seems to me that they could have gone from the scene where Tony Robbins hypnotizes Hal straight to Hal's encounter with the little girl in the burn unit. And then from there, he would meet Rosemary and fall for her inner beauty and not focus on her heft. The encounter with the little girl would have been an intermediate phase that would have had the audience thinking, If Hal can see this little girl's inner beauty and not focus on her scars, he could take the same kind of approach with a full-grown hefty woman. But the filmmakers didn't take this approach, because...why? Were they having too much fun with the fat girl jokes and the ugly girl jokes? I mean, after all, this movie was co-written and directed by the infamous Farrelly Brothers. So the movie is saying...what? It's o.k. to make fun of fat girls and ugly girls, but in the end it's more important to cherish their inner beauty? Whatever.

As for the rest of the film, I enjoyed the following:

-Jack Black. The first movie I saw him in was ""High Fidelity."" He had a small role as a record store employee, and as you watched him perform in that role, you're thinking Who in the hell is this?? You knew he had a film career in front of him. You just knew it. As it turned out, he was able to carry Shallow Hal quite easily. Whether he is mugging for the camera, playing slapstick, performing dramatic moments, or just being flat-out funny, he is quite enjoyable in this movie. Oh, not to mention that he is a very good dancer as well.

-Jason Alexander. The character he plays in this movie, Mauricio, is very much in the George Costanza mold, so if you enjoyed him in Seinfeld you shouldn't have any problem whatsoever with him in this. Funny as hell.

-There are a number of good songs on the soundtrack. I especially enjoyed ""Too Young"" (by some group named Phoenix), the song that plays on the dance floor in the bar where Hal and Mauricio go to look for girls shortly after Hal is hypnotized.

-Tony Robbins was only in two brief scenes but they are important, pivotal scenes and he handles his acting duties quite well in them. Tony Robbins satirizing and parodying himself - quite funny.

-Finally, as for the fat girl and the ugly girl jokes, I laughed at a lot more of these jokes than I normally would, only because Jack Black's character, Hal, wasn't in on them (remember, because of his hypnosis, he saw these girls as being thin and attractive). If Hal had been in on the jokes, it would have been an entirely different movie and I don't think it would have done the big business that it did. Critics and movie-goers most likely would have justifiably labeled it mean-spirited.

That's about it for Shallow Hal.",1441238400,,4927,4.537767756482525

He thinks he is cool and only chases after the beautiful girls.  After being hypnotized he sees the inner self of people.  That's good, but how can you just look at someone and know what their really like inside without meeting and talking to them.  Anyway he sees Rosemary, an over weight blond, as slim and trim Gwenyth Paltrow and falls in love.",1411430400,,505,4.387096774193548

OK - we've suspended our disbelief enough to buy that he sees a severely fat girl as slim and attractive.  Did the writers really have to make him insist on some of the things that she is never going to buy?  It makes him come off as a liar and cruel.  Good writers would have just avoided such comments instead of going for the cheap laugh/cringe.  The movie would have been funnier without that stuff.

1433831,4,B00005JKLQ,"This is neither a bad nor a great movie. Its message is straightforwardnamely, true beauty is not outward but inward and that Hal must learn this lesson. This is about the greatest depth to which this movie goes. Having said this, I will also say that there are a number of really funny scenes and a couple poignant moments. It's the sort of film that one may enjoy watching on an evening when one wants to sit back and not have to think too much.",1392595200,,447,4.270588235294118

Gwen's performance is quite moving, and Jason Alexander is funny as always, but Jack Black seems very disingenuous as the kind, clueless guy. I have enjoyed his performances much more in better movies.

I wanted to turn off my brain and enjoy some light-hearted fun, but was just too distracted by an unfunny Jack and an overly saccharine, insulting execution of a valuable ideal concerning ""real"" beauty.",1391558400,4,586,5.030927835051546

1433886,5,B00005JKLQ,great moral.... funny relationship flick. Youve got to love it when a movie cathes the miscegenistic male attitude so well and turns it around to show an unexpected human side. I love this movie because the first time I watched it was with my mom and it just gives me great memories of laughing with her. Jack Black is awesome in this movie.,1385856000,,341,4.428571428571429

1434074,5,B00005JKLQ,"Anyone who's offended by jokes that target the overweight population, I HIGHLY recommend avoiding Shallow Hal like the plague.  It's nothing but one highly offensive joke after anothr pertaining to overweight people.  Many of the jokes lean towards animal comparisons and chairs breaking and falling apart the moment one of the overweight actresses sits on them.  It's disturbingly tasteless (especially considering just how close to home this movie hits for many people, including those I admire and respect and love).

However I *do* think the writing is pretty spectacular and there IS a positive message at the end of the film about the consequences of disrespecting overweight girls.  It WILL come back to haunt Jack Black and it won't be pretty.

A lot of the dialogue -especially the one segment with Jack Black's character having a conversation with his overweight girlfriends father at a dinner table- are mighty fine examples of exciting writing.  Despite the obvious poor taste involved that directly insults those who are chubby, I have to admit that the humor usually hits all the right spots thanks to a well-executed storyline.  The movie writers were on top of their game when they came up with this, hence the 5-star rating I believe it deserves.

Plus it's interesting how Jack Black walks around seeing nothing but inner beauty but his friends see what the girls REALLY look like.  As a viewer you get to see both sides which is actually great writing, I have to admit.

As for Jack Black, I'm definitely not a fan.  Other than the movie Year One and maybe *maybe* King Kong, Jack Black never really seems to excel as a supposed big name Hollywood actor.  More often than not, he's mediocre.  All opinion of course.

Overall... yeah it's crude, yeah it's insulting and yeah if I were overweight myself I wouldn't be laughing, but I can't deny several of the jokes and the well-designed storyline really won me over in the end.",1331510400,,1945,4.869300911854103

Because of his not so attractive looks Hall finds it difficult to get every beautiful woman to date or even look at him. After being stuck in an elevator with a Hypnotizer and telling him about his trouble with women The Hypnotizer tells Hall that he can put a spell on him that will allow him to have every beautiful woman he sees [From now on when Hall looks to a woman he won't see her physical appearance but he'll see the reflection of her soul]. Hall no longer sees ugly women as ugly but as beautiful and splendid ! He no longer sees fat, overweight women as fat but as slim and radiant.

After being Hypnotized, Hall runs into the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen Rose Mary (Gwyneth Paltrow) who's actually overweight and is 300 pounds. After a while they start dating and Hall falls in love with her inner beauty. But unfortunately Hall's equally shallow friend is unhappy with the change he sees in his friend so he tries his best to break the Hypnotizer's spell. Will Hall leave his beloved Rose Mary after seeing her for her real appearance ? Or will his shallowness overcome his love and compassion ?

This movie might sound dumb but it's really not.

Shallow Hal is smart, funny, well-made, and carries a critically important message for our times:  It's what lies within a person (character, personality) that makes a relationship worthwhile, not the packaging (body/looks).

The bonus features on this disc are both informative and enjoyable.  If you want to laugh while biting your teeth into something far deeper than fluff, I recommend Shallow Hal.

1434083,4,B00005JKLQ,"Its funny when you walk into a movie expecting cheap laughs and wind up rather impressed with how emotionally centered the film wound up being.  That is kind of the feeling I get with `Shallow Hal'.  Sure, some of the laughs are cheap and this is by no means an Oscar contending `message film', but there is a surprising depth found in this `shallow' film.

The film revolves around Hal, a looks obsessed man who is rather obnoxious and is virtually alone thanks to his `high standards' and lack of any real tact.  He is constantly warned by others to look for the inner beauty, but he basically refuses to do so, instead divulging his time seeking after hot-tail that always turn him down.  He's saddled with a possibly even shallower best friend who uses the minutest of reasons to disregard the women he is with (and how he manages to get the woman he is with is beyond my comprehension).  When Hal winds up stuck in an elevator with a hypnotist his disease is cured and he is given a new outlook on women.  He only sees their inner beauty.  So, when he meets the obese Rosemary, he sees the gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow.

The humor here is surprisingly subtle, which I wholeheartedly enjoyed.  Sure, I love it when the Farrelly brothers go overboard (well, sometimes) but it was nice to see them wear their hearts on their sleeves for a change.

Now, as some may be aware, I am not a huge Jack Black fan.  I kind of find him `too much'.  There is a lot going on with his `humor', but not enough payoff in my book.  Here though, he actually follows through and delivers probably his finest comedic performance.  It's outlandish (as are all of his offerings) but there is an emotional depth to his antics that he doesn't often find.  Gwyneth Paltrow is the real treasure here though.  Despite her radiant beauty, she understands how to play Rosemary in a way that makes us wholly aware of her awkwardness.  She effortlessly puts on the front of being overweight while looking next to angelic.  Aside from the physical acting she captures, Paltrow also handles the films comedic and dramatic layers like a pro.

I really wish we saw MORE of her.

Like some have mentioned, the humor is subtle and at times it can seem as though the film forewent the laughs all together, but I think that in the end this serves the film well because it creates a more heartfelt and `poignant' feel.",1278028800,2,2378,4.509345794392523
1434104,4,B00005JKLQ,"So, Shallow Hal isn't exactly the greatest comedy ever made, nor is it the worst comedy within the past 10 years, so we can safely say that it falls somewhere in the middle.

The movie gives Jack Black's character, Hal Larson, a very shallow personality, he is only into the outer appearance of women. Little does he realize that he isn't much to look at himself. His best friend, played by Jason Alexander, would fall into the same category.

Eventually, Hal meets a motivational speaker, Tony Robbins, who is able to alter his perception. He alters it enough so Hal can only see the inside beauty of women. This all makes for some very funny and quick jokes throughout the film.

Gwyneth Paltrow plays the character of Rosemary Shanahan, who doesn't have the highest self-esteem, but has a charm and sense of humor that is bright and innocent. As Hal meets and gets to know Rosemary, he forgets about her looks and starts to fall in love with who she really is. Eventually, the story takes some quick twists and turns and Hal finds himself in a predicament. Not giving away the majority of the film, Hal realizes that beauty is really skin deep.

This is definitely a movie I would recommend to watch on a rainy day, one that helps to pass the time. Watch it also for a very beautiful and charismatic Gwyneth Paltrow, who pretty much steals each scene she appears in. Jack Black gives a very quick-spirited and honest performance. Jason Alexander plays the very loyal lacky to Jack's character.",1271894400,,1496,4.65530303030303
1434105,4,B00005JKLQ,"3.8 stars

While not as deliriously funny as the Farrellys' comic masterpiece There's Something About Mary, Shallow Hal is entirely likeable in its own right. Black is perfect as Hal, Paltrow and all the supporting actors are good, and it's Alexander's best role since Costanza. It bogs down a bit towards the end as it circles the runway and attempts a typically clumsy romantic comedy landing, but Hal is in full flight during much of the opening hour.

Perhaps the best scene is the opener; Hal's dying, heavily medicated father leaves him with some ""pearls"" that are among the funniest bits of advice I've heard in a long while. The morph into present-day Hal is perfection, and in general this entire flick is tightly shot and directed, with the script providing enough highlights to keep one amused throughout.

There is one scene near the end that is actually surprisingly powerful, with Black and a little girl, and I defy anyone to not feel a tear welling during that. It's beautifully done and makes one realize how well constructed the rest of the film has been to induce such emotion on such short notice. Bravo to the Farrellys for that moment, and for the heart on display here in general.

Most every comic film likes to bill itself as a ""feel-good comedy"", but Shallow Hal actually qualifies.",1269820800,,1308,4.774336283185841

I'm glad to see a comedy come out of Hollywood which actually had a decent message:  You can't always judge a book by its cover, you have to look within.  This movie really drives that point home, hence the title ""Shallow Hal"", as in the beginning of the movie Hal is yet another shallow idiot fascinated by appearances, yet ultimately he sees the error to his ways and repents.  Good movie.",1264809600,,458,4.416666666666667
1434107,4,B00005JKLQ,"Hal (Jack Black) is a very shallow Joe-Nobody type fellow who incessantly hits on women who are way out of his league.  His criteria for whom he asks out is pretty simple:  is she a hottie?  If so, she's on his list.  If not, then he's not interested.

One day, while stuck in an elevator a charlatan casts a spell on Hal.  When he gets off the elevator, he is able to see the inner beauty in women.  Women who are homely / overweight appear to be Victoria's Secret models.  And, it works both ways:  women who are gorgeous on the outside but have despicable personality traits appear to be hags.

There is even more to it than that.  Men who are nerdy / ugly and yet have good hearts appear to Hal to be buffed-up athletes.  No matter what the person looks like, or what gender they are, Hal sees what kind of persons they are.

Along comes Rose.  Rose is very overweight, but to Hal she is absolutely perfect.  Fittingly, Rose (both versions!) is played by Gweneth Paltrow, who IS one of the most perfect women on the planet!  Paltrow's performance drives the rest of the movie, for she's able to encapsulate the pain of a woman who has been overweight all her life.  She's a person who has had to deal with heckling, and has grown wary of it.

SHALLOW HAL is what I would call a dark comedy.  It does have some funny moments & its concept is original.  However, it's a movie that is a satire on how we as human beings treat each other (myself included).  It also points out how all of us have our human imperfections.

1434109,5,B00005JKLQ,"""If you can see it and hear it, isn't that reality?"" so asks ""shallow"" Hal (Jack Black) after he shockingly discovers that his friend has taken him out of guru Anthony Robbin's ""trance"" to see the ""beauty"" of his fat love, Rosemary.

Hal, as we know, has been tasked from young by his dying dad to pursue only pretty looking gals. One day, he finds himself stuck in a lift with the famous positive-thinking guru, Anthony Robbins, who zaps him with a new definition of what beauty is and can be defined. So begins Hal's adventures in discovering women and his own self.

This movie makes the point clear that beauty is defined by whoever sees and defines it as such. Culture, society and Hollywood-infested mass media define our mainstream definition of beauty and success from outward appearances and achievements. Most people in today's society just can't keep up with the Joneses but are expected to by society's demands. Tony Robbins allows Hal and us to redefine beauty from at a more deeper or 'spiritual' level as one's inner virtues which transforms one from within. Usually disempowered people could be empowered by the message of this comedy.

Stop chasing the useless Hollywood culture and go join the Peace Corps!

Another reason to watch this movie: Gwyneth Paltrow looks hot and adorable! ;-P
If she's really like that in real life, that's hot!

Now, how about a movie that glorifies skinny people?

Fat people may be the butt of jokes but reality is that they get hitched, they get the chance to find mates! I know a lot of married fat people! What about skinny people? No way, I don't see skinny MEN getting hitched! Females are spoilt for choices. Whatever their size or looks, females of all kinds can easily get mates simply because they're female, no matter what some jokers think, but males don't have too much fun.... that's the reality I see today. How about a little male empowerment? Is there such a theme in any movie?",1256083200,,1943,4.716814159292035
1434110,4,B00005JKLQ,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie when I saw the opening credits.  It's not a movie I ever would have chosen to rent -- Farrelly brothers, Jack Black?  It seemed too ""high school"" for my tastes.  However, I was recently stuck with it on a Greyhound bus in Australia.  The buses there are equipped with TV screens and DVD players, and drivers often pick a movie or two to show on long trips.  Then the passengers are stuck listening to it for however long it lasts, whether interested (or trying to sleep) or not.  Usually, these movies are action flicks that appeal to the backpacker set but not to me, and I was prepared for this one to be of the crude comedy genre, since that also would fit into the backpacker meme.

Surprise, it is actually a romantic comedy.  As a heavy gal myself, I was uncomfortable for about 5 minutes once I realized what was going on, but was gradually won over because so much of the movie rang poignantly true with my own experience, in ways that inspire thought more than laughs.  That scene where Hal walks right past Rosemary at the restaurant, her presence not even seeming to register, is right out of real life for many heavy or otherwise not-conventionally-attractive gals.  And when she bursts into tears and runs away, well, some might think that to be overdramatic, but it's real, too.  Many of us have as our fantasy to be loved, because we never have been.  And when that fantasy seems to be shattered after one's waited a decade or two or three for it, and dared to hope that it might actually be coming true, one's reaction can be strong.

The bus driver's timing was absolutely karmic, because that is exactly the movie that I needed to see at that time.  I'd just been dissed by a friend, after I expressed disappointment that I spent over a thousand dollars to come visit him for 4 days and he wasn't making more than a couple hours a day of time for me.  Turns out that the ""wow, body like a sports illustrated swimsuit model"" (at 40+? I beg to differ on that...) thin girlfriend who dumped him last year decided to reconcile with him 3 hours after my plane landed in his town.  That meant he had little time to spare for me, lest he risk losing again a woman for whom he quit his job after she gave an ultimatum that it was taking him away from her too much, but who broke up with him anyway after that.(?)  Daring to take issue with his sending constant text messages to two other girls when with me, and leaving me hanging, waiting for a call from him (he wasn't answering his phone at all, let alone text messaging with others, when with that girl) for hours, and then cutting short our evening out when the girl called in a panic about a case of hives, I found myself on the receiving end of a TEXT MESSAGE ending our longtime close  friendship.  What set him off?  Apparently my strong emotional reaction to his cutting our last evening short so that he could go help the prodigal girlfriend with her hives.

Funny thing, before he saw me in person a few years ago, we chatted every day online for multiple years and yes, he used the ""L"" word weeks before I did.  He tried to, but could not, hide from me his disappointment when he saw me for the first time and realized I was no size 8.  After that meeting, it has been arms-length most of the time and I certainly never again heard the ""L"" word -- very different from the relationship we had before he saw my physical appearance as I truly am.  My inner beauty, such as the grace and real concern for him as a close friend that I displayed when he (after ignoring me for 6 months on the insecure girlfriend's request) emailed me to say he was homeless and jobless, and I treated him like the prince I see him as, putting him up in the larger of two beds in my 4-star hotel room and buying meals for both of us when I came to visit last year, and not saying ""I told you so"" about the ex girlfriend's poor treatment of him, is apparently overshadowed by my being a size he does not find physically attractive. Real life can indeed be as strange as fiction.

Oh, and to the person who went on and on about guys not falling for fat chicks being a form of natural selection.... the anorectic make poorer bearers of children than do the moderately overweight, as they often suffer from various nutritional deficiencies due to lowered food intake and don't have the muscular structure to support preganancy well.  (Check your cultural anthropology books.  To many cultures throughout history, a solid build has been an indication of a healthy potential mother.)  Also, size (or other physical limitation, such as the guy with spina bifida but tremendous arm strength in the movie) and physical fitness don't always correllate.  There are many women 2/3 or even half my size who can't do a 100 mile bicycle ride, or can't do the splits, but I can.

Thumbs up to this movie for telling it like it is for many (not all) not-conventionally-attractive women, and for giving those of us who still dare to dream of being loved, a reason to hope.",1243814400,3,5044,4.409924487594391

But, if you can laugh at yourself, you'll enjoy it too - and especially the message this film brings in the end.

Jack Black was pretty much of an unknown actor when this came out, but he's well-known now.  Gwyneth Paltrow everyone knows. She looked very pretty in here, maybe the best I've ever seen her. Jason Alexander and Joe Viterelli provide good supporting help. By the way, it was strange hearing Viterelli with an Irish accent. This is a guy who almost always plays Mafia types.

The only thing offensive to me was the beginning with some irreverent humor that was not needed, not part of the story, just a cheap shot against ministers. Also, for a lightweight comedy, the profanity could have been less. Can't someone make a modern-day comedy without language and sex issues? It can be done - just look at the classics!

More effective to charm the audience with warm, likable characters and their weight-related struggles. Maybe the forced, artificial dialog had an impact on the acting. Moreover, they don't need the gratuitous sensuality-this story idea can carry itself just fine without it. With the right dialog.

1434113,4,B00005JKLQ,"""Shallow Hal"" is a modern fairy tale.  Like the beast in Walt Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" Hal (Jack Black) is obsessed with outward beauty.  One day, Hal is hypnotized by self-help guru Tony Robbins.  Now he only sees inner beauty.  Soon he is falling in love with an extremely overweight Peace Corp volunteer, Rosie, who has a heart of gold (Gwyneth Paltrow).  This is a very heart warming movie that teaches the viewer the importance of inner beauty.  Helping those less fortunate than ourselves is more important and everlasting than having a temporary romantic fling with someone you've met at a nightclub.  Unfortunately, there is a little bit of Hal in all of us.

  I wish the language and the sexual innuendoes in ""Shallow Hal"" had been toned down to give it a PG rating.  Everyone in the family needs to see this film because it has an inspirational, upbeat ending and an excellent message.  Everyone should treat people with respect and kindness no matter what their handicap, deformity, appearance, etc.  The world would be a nicer place in which to live.

  ""Shallow Hal"" is hilarious thanks to a great cast and a great script.  Hal is constantly opening his big mouth and getting himself into embarrassing situations, but he manages to come though them unscathed.  At the beginning of the film, he is driven by male hormones; however, he experiences a character transformation and it is his heart that drives his actions.  ""Shallow Hal"" is in the top ten of my favorite romantic comedies.  It is my desire that everyone watch it and learn to concentrate more on inner beauty and less on exterior appearance.  Furthermore, I must also add that the soundtrack is wonderful.  I especially love the song during the closing credits, ""Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes).""",1220140800,,1784,4.837748344370861
1434134,3,B00005JKLQ,"Rather than looking at this movie from an optimistic perspective, one in which the viewer is supposed to believe that this movie's plot is supposed to be about seeking the inner beauty in another, I choose to think of this movie another way.  I view it as a sign of recent times of individualism and me-first attitudes that permeate Western culture.

Hal Larson (Jack Black) is a guy who is by all standards normal, or maybe even below average.  Somehow, however, he thinks that he is only supposed to be with women of exquisite beauty.  Of course, the only beautiful women who would actually go for him are ones with wretched insides, women who have incredibly low self-esteen and can't see their beauty.  Along with Hal's best friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander) - another sub-5 on the 1 to 10 scale - they go after nothing but beautiful women.

Early in the movie Hal attends a speech by the square-jawed evil that is Tony Robbins.  Sure enough, Robbins plants something in Hal's mind so that he does not see outward beauty, and has a visually projected form of body dysmorphia.  In a matter of no time he has fallen for Rosemary Shanahan (Gweneth Paltrow), a mobidly obese, land-mass of a woman who has a redeeming personality.

Eventually Hal's subliminal messages subside, and he sees the actual outward reality.  Whether or not Hal and Rosemary stay together is of no real importance, but it's the message that's important.  In my opinion, the message is a problem.  The message is one we see a lot recently: accept who you are.  It's a fairly recent trend that tells people to be happy with themselves regardless of their shortcomings.  I find this way of thinking sad, because then what goal or accomplishment is there?  Should one even attempt to better oneself?

Aside from The Honeymooners, Fred and Wilma, and an assortment of unrealistic sitcoms, most people can't overlook the fact that the morbidly obese are the antithesis of beauty.  Hate me for being truthful, but if you're honest with yourself, you'll realize that the great majority do not find an unhealthy excess of body fat to be appealing.  Maybe the character Jack Black plays shouldn't have been going for the most beautiful, because, let's face it, he's not a top of the line sex symbol; however, I know for a fact he shouldn't have been with the 500lb. sea walrus named Rosemary Shanahan.  And rather focusing on loving oneself, maybe she should have been doing something to lose weight and live a better life.",1214870400,3,2488,4.757575757575758

Instead they lead us to fall in love with skinny gorgeous Paltrow...and watching her in a fat suit with prosthetics still is not an actual obese woman.  At all.  In any universe.

The Spina Bifida guy was done the way they should have done the Paltrow part (not the actress's fault).  He was so amazingly appealing, precisely because he was not fake.",1189123200,3,766,4.521739130434782

1434139,4,B00005JKLQ,"I know the Farrelly Brothers reputation preceeds them, but this movie takes what they are infamous for and adds some heart and soul and the result is a nice little comic-romantic offering. Jack Black is, well, Jack Black as the title character, which tells you all you need to know. Jason Alexander is, well, Jason Alexander as Hal's buddy and does his George from Seinfeld best portrait in smarminess and manic exasperation. Gwyneth Paltrow is understated as the self-image challenged Rosemary and gets the job done without maudlin overacting. The movie comes with a heavy-handed but well intentioned moral and you come away from this movie with a bit of hope and even possibly a dash of inspiration opposed to just coming away from it with something in your hair or mustard down your throat.",1182470400,2,793,4.881481481481481
1434140,5,B00005JKLQ,"The plot centers around Hal, a superficial twit who, to make a long story short, is hypnotized into perceiving every new person he meets as they really are inside. To him, the appearances of others become faithful representations of their inner natures.

A surprisingly deep premise, and the script certainly doesn't stumble with it. It's just hilarious.

Unfortunately, you kind of wish the writers had gone even further. The film shows how people who are fat or ugly on the outside can be beautiful on the inside.

What would have been nice is an exploration of how people who are ugly on the inside can also be ugly on the outside, or how those who are beautiful on the outside can also be truly beautiful on the inside, two possibilities that are cleanly overlooked by the filmmakers. Instead the film suggests that the nature of everything you see is, in fact, belied by its inner reality, quite a radical philosophical assertion when you think about it.

By the way, it may interest you to know that, spurred on to moral action by this film, I decided to finally go out on a date with an enormous woman who had repeatedly expressed an interest in me. For a few days, I completely overlooked her appearance and listened to her carefully, making every effort possible to discover and appreciate the person inside.

Alas! She was truly as hideous on the inside as she was on the outside. So it's back to superficiality for me.

1434142,4,B00005JKLQ,"Jack Black stars as Hal, a shallow, less than perfect man with high standards who only sees woman as they appear. After a chance encounter with Tony Robbins in an elevator, he is hypnotized into only seeing the inner beauty within woman. So what used to be offensive in his eyes, suddenly becomes endearing and desirable.

Hal soon learns woman who he thinks are very beautiful and sexy are the very same woman he would look at in disgust and run away from. Thinking he has some sort of sex appeal to be able to attract stunning woman, he finds himself all of a sudden attracting woman wherever he goes, until he meets Rosemary, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, whom he quickly falls in love with.

Black plays the part of Hal perfectly, superbly mixing comedy with a blend of drama. There are many messages to be picked up throughout the movie, mainly that everyone can be a little shallow and that real beauty does come from within. I was surprised to learn that this was a Farrelly brothers movie as it does stray from their usual brand of humour, but definitely in a good way as this is their most mature film to date whilst still delivering some of their comedic brilliance at the same time.

I was also surprised to learn that Black regretted ever being a part of this film and considered himself a sell-out afterward, saying that this was not the sort of film he ever wanted to make, but was just lured to the attraction of working with the Farrelly brothers.

There are negatives to this film, Paltrow's acting was very blend I'm sorry to say, but in saying that I have never been a big fan of her's and Jason Alexanders charcter became very annoying as the film played out. But I have seen this film many times and still enjoy it and will keep on enjoying it for years to come. It was a great buy and one of the most treadured DVD's in my coleection. The best Farrelly brothers film in my opinion.",1170547200,2,1900,4.42
1434143,1,B00005JKLQ,"The plot is of this film is built around Hal, Jack Black's character, being a ""shallow"" beauty obsessed man who one day finds that he is no longer capable of noticing a woman's exterior appearance. Thanks to Tony Robbins and his Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Hal can only see a woman's internal beauty. Is there any legitimacy to such a premise in the first place? Of course not. It's totally ridiculous. One reason is that obesity correlates with mental disorders like depression and obsession-compulsion. The real question is why are these individuals incapable of controlling their own behavior? It certainly isn't due to their being more picturesque ""inside"" than the rest of us. More importantly, Hal's true self is far deeper rather than the Robbinized one; we see the hypnotized Hal pleasing obese women everywhere while he actively working against his own interests and those of humanity. When he was categorizing women based on their physical fitness and beauty he was practicing a form of selection that allowed us to be among the most successful species on earth. His choice gave him excellent odds of mating with a women who happened to be fertile and also strong enough to survive pregnancy. Contrast this with what happened after he was placed under the conjurer's spell as his reproductive chances immediately evaporated. A porcine woman is one less likely to be fecund, and also one more likely to contract diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia, and ovarian cancer  along with producing babies who are afflicted with omphalocele and various other birth defects.  There's nothing shallow about avoiding obese women. The fact is it's the height of intelligence. Such a predisposition is highly refined and highly recommended. That we have evolved to the point of castigating men who desire healthy mates is merely another indicator of society-wide misandry and our  reflexive habit of condemning what is male while fawning over what is female.",1167868800,7,1956,5.203174603174603
1434183,2,B00005JKLQ,"Ok, check it out, there's two Jack Blacks. One is the guy from Tenacious D, you see him all the time. He's funny and childish and insane. Then there's the other Jack Black. He's the evil creature who pervades films like Shallow Hal and King Kong, whose only humorous lines are the ones that are funny by accident. Well, as long as you aren't fat and don't feel patronized by Gweneth presuming to know what it's like not to be desired all her life (ha), then by all means suspend all disbelief, logic, and brain power and watch this dumb movie. Gweneth's fat suit is actually pretty convincing, although most of the movie she's played by an actual fat chick...who by the way should have just been left in, without the whole ""ha ha the dude thinks she's skinny"" nonsense. Obviously, a film about a dude trying to cope with dating a big girl would have a lot more resonance if:
a) He weren't brainwashed
b) His fat girlfriend wasn't replaced by a twiggy blond chick
c) The movie didn't throw ridiculous concepts your way (like a guy could have sex with a 300 lb woman without realizing it)
d) Tony Robbins was in no way involved whatsoever

I knew I was slumming it when I saw this movie.  But I'm not sure what the message of this film is.  Jack Black's character is decent, considerate, great with kids and perfect in every way.  Oh, except he's really shallow for no dicernable reason, other than his dad's dying words were for him to go out and chase tail.  The weird part is that Hal's not a bad person.  The movie beats you over the head showing you he's the nicest guy on on the face of the Earth, so you can't really laugh at him looking like an idiot.  Rosemary is so fat she has superpowers.  Her butt actually creates typhoons (I wonder if that has military applications?).  Suddenly, Hal mistakes ugly pimply girls for supermodels and evil skanks for old shrews.  Tony Robbins brainwashed him, the fiend! When Hal finally realizes this he decides to (ooh big spoiler) love Rosemary anyway, and learns a VALUBLE LESSON.  Along the way there are a ton of cliches like people thinking he's dating Rosemary just because her dad happens to be his boss, and a sexy neighbor in his building who starts to get the hots for him when she sees how non-judgemental he is dating a fat girl ('cause that would make any woman melt).  Of course there's requisite best friend, played by Jason Alexander, who is repulsed by fat people and plots to get Hal to dump her.  Then again, the friend is a complete troll, so I don't know why Hal would want him around.  And to insult us further, they force some burned kids on us at the hospital to strike a SERIOUS note about how true beauty is on the inside. Too...many...public...service...messages! PICK...ONE..!!

But brain-dead writing aside, Paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her in the fat suit (despite Gweneth's postering when this film was first released). Regardless of its clumsy benevolence, I have to rate this as a romantic comedy. And for that, I give it a rating of totally unremarkable. Nice gesture, Farelly brothers.

1434184,4,B00005JKLQ,"Jack Black is truly a hysterical human being. Underneath all of the hilarious comedy there lies a message. Whether everyone agrees or not is optional, but it shows the truth about beauty. Many people overlook others based on looks alone, when in reality, we are all equal! This movie portrays a serious message in a very funny way. I love the combination done here. It will be in my DVD collection forever.

Pros:

Hilarious, Unique, Good message

Cons:

Not exactly realistic, I don't think it's actually possible to slip someone into a trance as Mr. Robbins did, but I think there's a deeper meaning behind the whole trance saying, ""sometimes we do actually think this way.""",1163894400,2,676,4.801724137931035

1434186,4,B00005JKLQ,"We have become a world that is almost obsessed with appearances. We have been lead to believe that if we look or dress a certain way then we will be accepted for who we are. We have all been told that ""beauty is only skin deep"" but how many of us really believe this way? How many times have you seen an overly obese person in the grocery store with cheetos and pastries and beer in their cart and have thought to yourself, ""Good job, tubby, keep it goin'..."" I mean, I'm not putting myself up on some golden pedastel, because I have often made many judgments about others simply because of the way they looked which kind of makes me sad admitting this because I was often judged by the way I looked growing up and I totally resented those people who said stuff and did stuff just to humiliate me and try and make me feel bad about myself.

No, I wasn't obese, but I was very skinny. I stood about 6'1"" and weighed between 105-106 and a whopping 107 if I didn't take a dump that day. You can probably imagine the ridicule that I went through day in and day out. And out of that frustration and anger and humiliation, I ended up working out. Now you might say that others ridiculing me turned out to be a very positive experience. Not as positive as you might think. I found that these same people that ridiculed me a couple of years before now wanted to be chummy with me now that I was buffed and incredibly good looking...okay...maybe I was just buffed, but even though I had the appearance of someone who was strong and confident, inside I was still this insecure skinny kid who used to run home from school with tears in his eyes wondering why people didn't just like me for who I was.

This movie really hit home for both my wife and myself because even though she grew up on the East Coast and I grew up on the West Coast, our stories were remarkably similar even though hers was the opposite. My wife is an incredibly beautiful woman inside as well as outside, but she had a weight ""challenge"" and she still has one. She has to be very careful of what she eats and has to make sure she gets her exercise or the pounds will come back on. But I love her for her. She's not her weight. She is a human being that deserves love, appreciation, and respect.

You might think this film is hokey, that it's not terribly funny, but the message is very clear. Look beyond what the outer and into the inner soul of a person. There is a very touching scene that I would like to attempt to describe before I go. Hal (Jack Black) goes into the hospital that Rosie (Gwyneth Paltrow) does volunteer work in. He is under the ""spell"" that Rosie is the most gorgeous woman he ever met and he meets this little girl. He sees the little girl and tells her that she's the prettiest little girl he ever met. And she is, a very pretty little girl. After the spell is broken, he goes back into that same hospital and the little girl goes, ""Hal! Hal! Don't you remember me?"" It's that same little girl but this time he sees her as a burn victim and he witnesses all the scars that are all over her body, ""You told me I was the prettiest girl you'd ever seen..."" And he holds her in his arms, ""You're right, princess, you are...you are..."" Under the ""spell"" Hal saw right through people and into their heart...their spirit...their soul...Hal saw people as they really are.

Now you might think that's a load of sentimental mush and it is and this movie is geared toward the mushy side, but it really is a very important message that we need to hear over and over again; we are not the packaging...we are what's inside...

Even with the obvious sentimentality going on in this film, I had some genuine belly (no pun intended) laughs goin' on. There was a scene where Hal smears vaseline all over his eyes and tells Rosie, ""Uhhh...I have contagious conjunctivitis...but I'll be okay..."" I don't know why I thought that was so funny, but if there is one thing that Jack Black knows how to be and that is very dry and very understated. He was actually a very good choice for this part. Even when he's the ""D"", his humor can be very subtle and just creeps up on you and you think back and go, ""Wow...that was funny..."" This movie was the same way. I found myself thinking about certain parts and just laughing.

It is a good film and it has a great message and even though we have all heard, ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" a million times in our lives, we really need to start acting as though it were the truth, because it is. It is our light within that makes us truly shine brightly.

1434187,4,B00005JKLQ,"When Hal is a boy of 9 his father is dying. On his deathbed he tells his son to try to always go after women who are very good looking with nice bodies because he made the ""mistake"" of marrying a woman for her heart, now he has a hag as a wife. Hal agrees, and the father dies.

Years later, this shallow boy is now a shallow man who aims to get women who are WAY out of his league. He's dating a girl who lives across the hall, but she dumps him because he's so shallow. His best friend is just like him and together they scope the clubs looking for beautiful women who don't want them.

Hal meets an inspirational speaker who ends up hypnotizing him into seeing every individual's inside instead of their outside. The only thing is, it only applies to new people he meets, not those he already knows. He meets a woman named Rosemary and falls in love not realizing his perception of people's looks is altered.

This is the jist of Shallow Hal. I love this movie and find it very funny. Some think the movie makes fun of big people. And while they certainly have the right to their perception, I feel they're missing the point. However, Shallow Hal does have logistical flaws.

Flaws/Plot holes
1. It's too good to be true that every single person who is overweight, ugly, deformed, or crippled is automatically a good person on the inside; yet, all of them are in the movie.

2. There's a major flaw in the fact that even though Hal is now dating regular looking people HE still thinks they're babes, therefore he is actually learning nothing about shallowness. He's simply having the wool pulled over his eyes. He's being hypnotized into doing the right thing for the wrong reason.

3. Gwyneth Paltrow is cute, but to think that Hal sees her as being so much better looking than the other girls he met prior is just implausible. They should have made Gwyneth the girl across the hall, and Susan Ward his love interest since she's much better looking than Gwyneth. I guess I'm being shallow too.

Even with these plot holes, the movie is fun and its heart is in the right place. Jack Black is hilarious and Gwyneth Paltrow is good here too. In the end Hal gets his gal and does learn that valuable lesson that eluded him 3/4 of the film.",1156377600,3,2239,4.380722891566265

1434189,1,B00005JKLQ,"This film really misses its mark. We all found it so crazy that the premise of this formula film is that ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" when the whole foundation of the film is supported by the fact that he would find the leading female character (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) unattractive (at best) without the dellusional vision of her. And, even though the message of relative acceptance of a fat woman comes at the end, it is a wobbly at best turn around. The message of making fun of a fat woman and the insanity of a man being attracked to one is the true message of the film, as that is what is underlined and driven home again and again through the film. The whole lot of us, men and women, fat and thin, found it depressing rather than funny. It's so strange the way people need to make fun of what they do not understand. I wish the Unites States could grow up and get over this need to attack and marginalize those who don't fit the US Image of Beauty. That standard is truly not about real beauty, it;s about buying a lie in order to keep the largest industry adding up their billions through each woman's insecurities. This film, sadly, fails to create positive change or even a good love story, rather it just adds to the pain of so many fat women out there, walking the streets in complete discomfort from total self-consciousness, enduring nasty looks, comments, or just becoming a shut-in to avoid the pain. It would be such a beautiful thing if fat people's plight could be recognized and addressed as a real and worthy topic. It is another civil rights issue that can't be addressed because it would destroy the fabric of so many industries (cosmetics, magazines, fashion, films, video's, diet industry, etc.) After the film, a group of us, all couples, were talking about the subject, and we all agreed that the fat white women get it the worst. Do you think they would chose to be fat in this world? Some are overeating from pain and haven't found a way out yet. Others have a natural plump figure or a predisposition to becoming fat, i.e. genetically... Why disregard or dislike a person based on something like that, which they can't even control always? It's as bad as judging someone for their skin color.

However, if you stop to think; Shallow Hal could be approached philosophically.  I think the producer was on to something here.  To some success he is letting us see how a real person -perhaps a godly person sees others; without defects or prejudice - simply as human beings.

I appreciate this movie for its honesty, its settle intent to identify our own shallowness while at the same time taking us to a higher level of sincerity within ourselves. I like the movie a lot.  In fact, I identify with Shallow Hal because I tend to see people beyond their physical appearance.  To me this movie was very real, although, not Hollywood correct.  This movie took me to my dream world; the perfect world where we can all love each other from within. I highly recommend it.",1149120000,,869,4.496815286624204
1434191,4,B00005JKLQ,"This film by the Farrelly brothers is one of their better ones. Though they have not shaken off their lowbrow sense of humor, they have managed to better incorporate it into their film, so as not to lose all credibility. As a result, they have put together a pretty decent and unusual romantic comedy.

The plot revolves around our not so good looking leading man, Hal Larson (Jack Black), who, due to a traumatic scene with his dying father when only nine years old, is fixated on dating only women who have super model looks. Pumped up by his equally not so good looking, best friend, Mauricio Wilson (Jason Alexander), Hal is hellbent on dating only good looking women no matter how stupid, mean, or self absorbed they may be. It is no wonder that he has yet to find the woman of his dreams.

A run in with motivational speaker, Tony Robbins, changes Hal's life, when Tony places a subliminal message into Hal's subconscious, causing him to see only the person's inner beauty. When his path crosses that of the morbidly obese, but warm and kindly Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow), it is love at first sight for him. He does not see a fat girl but a beautiful and luminous Gwyneth Paltrow.

Hal continues to see only the inner beauty of all those whom he meets, until he is brought back to a jarring reality by his erstwhile best friend. What happens when faced with the reality of having a morbidly obese girlfriend is a trial and tribulation that only Hal can resolve. Will true love win out? Watch the movie and find out.

Gwyneth Paltrow is sensational as Rosemary. Her delivery is affecting, as she comes across as sensitive, sweet, and hesitant, as well as somewhat lacking in confidence. She is absolutely incandescent in the role. She effectively plays the part of Rosemary, as if she were a young woman unused to the attentions of a suitor. She is also quite funny at times, as Hal's comedic foil.

Jason Black, as Hal, is also funny, though somewhat wooden. He is obviously a comedian, rather than an actor. Still, he manages to play his part effectively, overall. Jason Alexander plays his role a bit too over the top, almost manic, and ends up being more obnoxious, rather than funny. In the end, however, when his own personal secret comes out, it really is a hilarious moment in true Farrelly brothers fashion. The rest of the supporting cast is very good and effectively contribute to the comedic efforts of the film.

While this film emphasizes that inner beauty is what is important, it does so, however, while still making fun of fat people at their expense. When Gwyneth Paltrow asks for a slice of cake and proceeds to hack off a third of the cake for herself, the film is continuing to propogate stereotypic notions of fat people. A number of sight gags further serve to underscore this premise. This is, however, a Farrelly brothers comedy, after all, and to be expected.

The DVD has a number of interesting features, including one entitled ""Seeing through the Layers"", which shows the efforts made to turn Gwyneth into a believably obese woman. The DVD also includes a film commentary by the Farrelly brothers, as well as eleven deleted scenes, in addition to some other features. All in all, this DVD offers excellent picture and sound quality and is value laden.",1148688000,,3293,4.686851211072664

A lot of people may feel this film is heartless and rude when it comes about talking and trashing over-weight indviduals but this film offers something more, look beneath the surface and you will see a sweet tale of inner-beauty and how it really does matter than physical beauty.

1434223,5,B00005JKLQ,"I'll admit I was not that enthusiastic about this movie when I first saw it--I thought that Hal seeing those unattractive women as looking like models was a painful reminder of how narrow the standards of beauty for women are; that Hal was only attracted to these women because they looked like models to him under Tony Robbin's hypnosis. Then I kept watching it and saw what the Farrelly Brothers were trying to get across. This movie grew on me, and each time I watched it, I liked it more and more. Beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder, and in Hal's eyes, the physically unattractive become beautiful, whereas the physically beautiful become unattractive (Nurse Peil, for example).

I love the fact that the Farrellys always have unusual characters in their movies, and they use actors with physical or mental disabilities with great sensitivity that really add to the story. Such characters add interest to the film and it's refreshing to see actors that look like ordinary folks instead of the the pretty boys and anorexic, unrealistically beautiful women so prevalent in most Hollywood films.

The story has been already told by other reviewers, so I will say that Jack Black, Gwynyth Paltrow, and Jason Alexander do a great job as the main characters. It is a charming story, very upbeat and enjoyable to watch. Hal starts off being shallow and obnoxious but redeems himself in the end. It is Hal's progress from superficial buffoon to a decent, actually nice guy that's so enjoyable to watch.",1145318400,,1506,4.833333333333333
1434224,4,B00005JKLQ,"What is the world coming to when a movie by the Farrelly Brothers makes me cry? I knew I was being set up for something when Hal (Jack Black) goes with his new girlfriend Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) to the Children's Hospital where she volunteers and has a great time with the kids. I knew that Hal was missing something and I could not figure out what it was either (except that it was not contagious), and when the revelation came it floored me almost as much as it did Hal. We live in interesting times, to say the least.

You all know the basic premise of ""Shallow Hal."" Our hero is only interested in what women look like. There is an unnecessary prologue in which Hal's dying father imparts some drug-induced wisdom that supposedly programs Hal to be shallow. However, he apparently learned how to be inept with women all on his own. Then he has a chance encounter with self-help guru Tony Robbins (played by self-help guru Tony Robbins in a brilliant bit of casting). Now when he goes off into the world, Hal will see the inner beauty of women. Actually he is told it will apply to any ""person"" he sees, but it does not work on Hal's best friend, Mauricio (Jason Alexander), which would have been interesting, and apparently only works once in ""reverse"" over the course of the film. Hal is suddenly having great success with a bevy of beautiful women, but it is Rosemary with whom he is completely smitten.

Granted, there is an inherent flaw in turning inner beauty into outer beauty for a man who has been totally obsessed with the latter, because on the intellectual level that defeats the whole purpose of the fable being told here. In a sense, Hal now gets to have his cake and eat it too. I wonder if this film would have worked the other way around, where we always see the truth and get only brief glimpses of what Hal sees. But then Gwyneth Paltrow is not going to be playing the lead, and that would have been a shame.

As long as I am making outrageous comments about this film I might as well say that Paltrow's performance in ""Shallow Hal"" is better than her Oscar winning performance in ""Shakespeare in Love."" Forget about the scenes where she wears the ""fat suit,"" it is the rest of the film where she does a marvelous job of acting like an overweight person. Usually Paltrow's character is like fine porcelain china, but this time around her character has some weight (sorry, you knew that was coming), and in this film she is the most attractive she has ever been as far as I am concerned. For most of the film Black tries too hard, clearly aware he is in a Farrelly brothers film, but in the key scenes (including the one that made me cry) he is on target and when it comes to playing an annoying sidekick Jason Alexander is in a league by himself. But everybody's favorite supporting character is Walt (Rene Kirby), who has spina bifida and establishes the standard by which we judge Hal and the rest of the males in this film (Why doesn't the ""inner beauty"" charm work on him? Because he is male? These things bother me). Remember that this is one of those films where you have to watch the credits because there is something at the end.

The trailer for ""Shallow Hal"" gives away virtually every major sight gag in the film, which is actually good because you gloss over those while you watch it and keep your focus on the relationship between Jack and Rosemary. One of the other surprises of this film is that most of the jokes are at Hal's expense and not Rosemary's. But once you get past Paltrow's performance and a tearjerker scene, this ends up being a relatively minor surprise.

The problem is that they fill this great plot with tons of fat jokes.  Yes, we understand she is heavy, but no one breaks large booth chairs at restaurants!  I find things like that offensive.  I understand a bit of character development when his friend speaks poorly about Rosemary, but so much of the other jokes is just a cheap way to get a laugh at the expense of people who are heavy.  So what they are saying is: You should see people's inner beauty no matter what they weigh, but it is ok to laugh at them for their weight.

1434227,3,B00005JKLQ,"Farrelly Brother's specialize in sexual innuendo and raunchy comediennes with rubber faces.  Their funny men are Ben Stiller, Jim Carrey, or in the case of Shallow Hal, Jack Black.  Boy, I loved Jack Black in High Fidelity and Almost Famous.  He's a terrific second banana, but the problem is, he's not a first banana.  I panned School of Rock also.  There's not enough in his insipid, look at me, I'm a fat boy, to keep an audience interested for ninety minutes.  But that's not the Farrelly Brother's fault.

Comedy today, we're not going back to mass-produced Abbott and Costello's.  Hope and Crosby, the kids shrug their shoulders.  What did the WW2 generation see in Hope's lame jokes?  If my parents wanted to hear some wild laughs, they had to go the Catskills.  Make sure the kids are asleep.  Shecky Green or Buddy Hacket talked gynecology non-stop.

The Farrelly's are giving mass audiences Catskill laughs with film savvy.  Their themes mostly make use of the Hope, Woody Allen, everyman shlump idea, and put in situations where the schlemiel is out of his league.  Then they trot out the prettiest actresses and models in Tinseltown and the fun begins. Gwunth Paltrow seems to be taller and more stacked than I remember from Shakespeare In Love.  I'm not sure if it was camera angle or padded panties, but her figure as the fantasy of zapped Jack Black seemed less real than the stand in fat girl.

1434231,5,B00005JKLQ,"After taking gross out comedy to new heights with ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Me, Myself And Irene"", Bobby and Peter Farrelly decided to tone it down for their next film. The result was this wonderfully offbeat comedy about a womanizer who learns the hard way that there is indeed beauty on the inside.

Jack stars as Hal Larson, a relentless skirtchaser who, ever since his dad advised him on his deathbed, has always looked for the right women. However, instead of a woman who's kind and accessible (ie, the average looking, marrying type), Hal's idea of a perfect woman is one with a nice (...), long legs and big (...). Along with his friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander, trying desparately to add some life into his post - ""Seinfeld"" career), Hal scowers various dance clubs looking for beautiful women. One day, everything changes. Hal gets stuck in an elevator with self help guru Tony Robbins. Hal and Tony have a discussion. Tony is bothered by Hal's superficiality when it comes to women, and puts a spell of sorts of Hal. Hal is now able a woman's inner beauty. In his eyes, all women are beautiful. The problem is, in everyone's else's eyes, they're really not all that attractive. So when Jack meets the 300 pound plus Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suit), he sees her as the typical stick thin blonde he's used to. Hal hits it off with her without ever knowing what she really looks like. As Mauricio becomes increasingly worried about his friend, Hal and Rosemary fall deeper in love. Until the spell is broken. Of course, by the end, everything wraps up in a preditable fashion, but it still works out.

The film is every funny. I applaud Gwyneth changing her look for her role. Most actresses would balk at the idea, but Gwyneth is about showing off her acting talents rather than her looks (though she is a very beautiful women). Jack Black is very funny as Hal, and though as I said earlier he's trying shamelessly to revive his career, it was nice to have Jason Alexander along for the ride. Loaded with extras, this is a dvd that I would recommend to most people.",1123200000,2,2093,4.623655913978495

Shallow Hal is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Needless to say, Jack Black, Gwyneth Paltrow, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

1434257,4,B00005JKLQ,"What you get out of ""Shallow Hal"" probably depends on how you watch it. You could just coast along, brain in neutral, and enjoy the gags and comic situations. On this level, it's a very successful movie - hardly a minute goes by without something funny happening, or (from time to time) a moment of pathos.

Or you could pause a moment to absorb the moral message - never mind physical appearances, concentrate on the beauty (or ugliness) within. That's more or less valid, up to a point, and lets you reinforce your amusement with satisfying feelings of moral superiority. Just the thought that a beautiful girl (and there are plenty of them in ""Shallow Hal"") could somehow be lurking inside someone who looks plain at first sight, might be enough to stimulate a new interest in wallflowers.

Most fun, though, for those who are that way inclined, is to analyze the message to death! You get all the scope in the world. For instance, how come Hal sees dozens of ""inward beauties"", but only one physically good-looking woman who is an ""inward hag""? And how come he seems to go on seeing his friends just as they always were? And why doesn't he suspect something when, as the girl of his dreams approaches him stark naked and playfully throws her panties at his head, what he catches is something about the size of a bell tent? Come to that, how does he even survive the ensuing grapple?

OK, a little of that sort of thinking goes a long way, and a lot of you are probably annoyed with me already. So, to close the loop, here's one last question that set me meditating for quite a while - if Hal can't help seeing people as they really are, is there any merit in his behaviour? Intuitively no, but after all couldn't virtue be just the natural result of seeing people clearly?..",1108166400,,1778,4.515527950310559

The main character does a smashing job as Hal injecting some depth to the character while still being very funny. The supporting cast are also great. It's a very funny film which also works as a touching romantic love story.

Some things i strongly admired about this film (besides the laughs) include the way Hal's shallowness was portrayed as a serious handicap, he would never have had the opportunity to get to know the sick kids, or meet his love or even get to know himself if it hadnt been for his luck in meeting the therapist/guru who brought down the shield. The inner beauty thing works both ways, thus the attractive nurse who is a scheming bitch, he sees as ugly. The soundtrack is pretty good too.

He is hypnotised by a man that disallows him to see girls as they physically apppear but as per the inner beauty that lies in them.....The story goes on.

Its a simple scene of a girl with a burnt face and a doll.....I won't say more.

1434260,5,B00005JKLQ,"This is one of those films that doesn't seem to really fit a genre.  Is it a romantic comedy, a typical Farrelly Brothers film (like Something About Mary) filled with crass humor, or a drama with a message?  I am not sure, but I do know it caused some controversy upon its release for its depiction of obesity.  That and it is actually pretty sweet and very funny.

The story involves Hal (Jack Black) who is hopelessly shallow, and seeks only women way out of his league, and for all the wrong reasons. His best friend (Jason Alexander - who plays a character even more shallow than George Castanza) and him are turned down, rejected and dismissed by nearly every woman they try and meet. He meets and gets coaching from Tony Robbins in an elevator, and all of a sudden he is irresistible.  The only catch is that he sees only ""inner beauty"" now.  He meets Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) and falls in love.  His friends see Rosemary as she is, quite overweight, while Hal sees her as a slender beautiful model.

The controversy comes from how beauty is depicted.  While some may be offended by the reality of how our society treats those who are not as attractive, or may be disabled, I didn't feel the subject was treated poorly here.  In fact I was quite surprised, as I expected something much more crass and worthy of the controversy.  For those who may have taken a critical view of the subject treatment, I think that view of this film is ironically - shallow.  Behind the funny jokes, and great comedy, is a message of what beauty really is.  There are some great scenes in here that are actually quite subtle.  Hal not only sees ""inner beauty"", but the opposite as well.  Further it applies to everyone new he meets, including some very special kids in the hospital.

The DVD presentation is great.  I found the deleted scenes to be some of the best material.  In fact, they are so good I would rather see a ""directors cut"" with them included as opposed to watching them separately.  The rest of the bonus materials, including the process they used to put a ""fat suit"" on Gwyneth, were fascinating.  At one point she walked around the Hotel lobby in the make-up and experienced how she was treated as someone very overweight, which for her was quite a shock.

Overall, I think the subject was treated well, and the result is a funny movie that has a good message to look beyond appearances to the beauty inside.",1102204800,2,2416,4.52073732718894
1434318,3,B00005JKLQ,"Comes this sensitive, heart-felt movie about inner beauty, and not judging people by their looks, which I feel strongly about, having been judged by my looks a lot. I was expecting this movie to feature a lot of overweight Gwyneth, and have all the crude and unfunny jokes that I'm used to from the Farrelly brothers. I was pleasantly surprised.

When so many people are overweight in this day and age, and obesity is practically seen as a disease, this movie sees Gwyneth's character cracking jokes about it, or seeing her natural version ordering a mountain of food. In her fat suit (which took 4 hours to get into and apply makeup with it), it totally changes Gwyneth's image that we're used to - the girl who's normally in need of a good feeding, and too skinny for her own good. (""Hal: So what do you weigh, like 110? 115? Rosemary: [sarcastically] Which one of my butt cheeks are you talking about?"") It's not that offensive movie, unless I guess, if you're an overweight person, than I recommend you stay away from this movie, or you're the kinda girls I went to school were who were so pretty, they got guys falling around at their feet, and doing anything for them. Not all women are portrayed as overweight in this - they're portrayed in a stereotypical way of giving them glasses, bad skin, bad teeth and all round ugly. When you're not attractive, you don't get the attention from guys. When you're obese, you're not given the time of day.

Jack Black is hardly Mr Perfect himself, or Hollywood attractive, which makes him so great in this movie. The role would not have been the same with Brad Pitt in the movie, or someone that everybody - apart from me - would swoon over. He plays Hal, a very picky man, who likes everything just right, explained like this: ""Well, that face, but with better headlights. You know how hers have kind of dimmed lately? Heidi Klums beams would do. And her teeth. Or, ooh, that Britney Spears girl. She's got great knockers. But she's a tad muscular. Uh, actually, you know what? Her ass would do, too, if she had a better grille. Like, uh, Michelle Pfeiffer back when she did ""Grease 2"". But she'd have to be a little smilier than Michelle. Kinda like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, before she got Stamosed. But not as skinny. Someone a little meatier, like Heidi. But without the accent. You know those accents: yah-yah-yah-yah. They really get old fast. You know what I mean. Someone like that.""

There are some really tender moments in this, when he sees people for what they really are, or the kids in the hospital, covered in burns, or the fact that Rosemary's mother is in the same shape as her daughter.

I loved the Mauricio role, played by Jason Alexander in this (played Earl in an episode of Friends, who Phoebe convinces not to kill himself). He actually came out with some great and really meaningful lines in this, most of which have to be heard to be believed.

This movie really provoked a feeling in me, that I haven't felt since watching something like Welcome To The Dollhouse. I felt strongly about things that were shown in this movie, and I'm glad I got it now. It's certainly a great movie to cuddle up to someone (or in my case, a cuddly toy) with, on a freezing cold day, when the wind is howling outside. Everyone has their faults, and their flaws.

1434321,3,B00005JKLQ,"First published Stanford Daily, Nov 2001.

The Farrelly brothers have done it again. From the makers of such outr comedies as ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Me, Myself and Irene"" comes ""Shallow Hal,"" a comedy with a conscience. Known for movies that feature imperfect men lusting after gorgeous girls with a few laughs thrown in for good measure, the brothers delve a bit deeper this time, seeking to convince us that fat is fun. Jack Black (the crazy music store employee in ""High Fidelity"") is Hal, a shallow male (if you'll pardon the redundancy) of modest looks, besotted with breasts and waiflike figures. He prefers a girl with just one large breast to one with half a brain. Needless to say, in the true Farrelly tradition, Hal is a loser when it comes to girls.

Hal's messiah is Tony Robbins, the self-help guru who achieves the impossible and makes him see inner beauty. Ergo, Hal moves in a haze, stripping fat women of the excess padding, glossing over manly moustaches etc., to visualize them as the epitome of pulchritude. One such beneficiary of Hal's x-ray vision is Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), who trades her corsets from ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""Emma"" for a fat suit. Despite being well over 300 pounds and gluttonously devouring any source of fat within range, Hal can only see her as the nubile nymphet of his dreams. His consternation at being in a minority of one in his admiration is palpable. Eventually the blinkers fall off, courtesy his shallower pal, the meddling Mauricio (Jason Alexander). The crux of the film lies in how Hal confronts the fat in his femme fatale.

Black's virtuoso performance as Hal makes us squirm. Rosemary, with the fat suit, is ponderously poignant. She shames us with her starkly evident low self-esteem and tame acceptance of stereotypical notions of what passes off as beauty. If only her character had more flesh than fat, the full range of emotions that obese people experience could have been hung out to dry. By resorting to stilted portrayals in black and white of fat people being angelic do-gooders while ugly non-fat people (the ones in this film, barring Jill, can't be called slim), are shallow shysters, the many shades of gray in between are ignored.

Paltrow took a stroll in a New York hotel with the fat suit on, and has been quoted as saying that ""...no one was making eye contact with me, or would even look in my direction. No one wanted to connect with me. It was a profound, very sad and startling experience."" Some of that sadness is revealed in her portrayal of Rosemary. However, it would however, be a safer bet that UFOs would land at Stanford than to hope that Hollywood would make us laugh and cry in the same movie.

Paltrow looks as radiant as ever. Rather strangely, she reminds one of Phoebe (of ""Friends"" fame) when she attempts to be goofy. Jack Black has the makings of a star. His Hal is a flawed bungler who is redeemed solely by an inner core of middle-American harmlessness. Rene Kirby as Walt is a casting coup. His joie de vivre is at the heart of the movie's message. Kirby, an ex-IBM employee, was discovered by the Farrellys in a bar in Burlington, as he plodded along on all fours (owing to spina bifida). The character was specifically written for him. Jason Alexander, chubbier than ever, does not disappoint as Mauricio.

The Farrellys have been known for at least one memorable cinematic moment in their movies - most notable of course, Ben Stiller's nuts and bolt coming in the way of his zipper, and Cameron Diaz's organic hair gel in ""There's Something About Mary."" This one has a twist in the tail. Eminently enjoyable.",1098057600,10,3635,4.734597156398104
1434322,1,B00005JKLQ,"Ah,  ''shallow hal'' quite possible the worst movie from 2001 and possible the  worst movie in Gwenyth Paltrow's career. oh man i don't even know where to start , there are so many contradictions and problems in shallow hal that are obvious at first glance that a review of it is almost unnecessary but here goes.

Note: I will also note that are excellent reviews on this movie, I read a review by another member who basically called this movie , a movie of hypocracy, and I would agree with that 100%. Because myself being a Latin American  living in the US for practically all my life have encountered guys like

Shallow Hal,(Nate Howard) a pathetic excuse of men who don't know how to treat a women, yet they whine and cry when women do not want to do anything with the. That's the attitude of a typical stupid American male, but I am anything but typical and I am glad I am not the type of guy that Hal is.

First a background on the movie. the movie pokes fun at fat women that's basically  it, now there's some garbage about the theme of the movie which talks about the inner beauty of people. the problem here is that hal larson (the equally bad jack black) never sees this beauty for most of the film. but i'll talk about that later.

The movie as referenced in the chicago tribune and la times was originally boycotted in small cities, and and hated by the the big women/ people in the community. ''Shallow hallow'' is a pretty offensive movie that pokes fun at fat people, and only seeks to hide this fact by having the movie classified as a ''comedy''. The stupid premise in which a guy named ''Hal'' is hypnotized to see the inner beauty of females. even after it opened it was still characters at basically a bashing movie on big people, I won't use the word fat, because when people say someone is fat, they immediately think someone ''choses'' to be fat, when in fact many people's metabolism and body type causes them to have physical problems such as weight. (and no ''shallow hal'' doesn't really mention this).

Now then the plot involves this shallow character named Hal Larson (black) who is hypnotized by well known hypnotist anthony robbins (playing himself). now under this hypnosis hal is supposed to see the inner beauty of people. the problem is that what is seeing as the inner beauty is hiding and camouflaging his outer senses, so basically when hal thinks he sees a thin sized women, he is not, when it's a larger woman. and then having this deception hal's own disgusting sexual attitudes comes to life. 'Man she's hot'' is what Hal thinks when he sees woman, that's what Hal's first reaction is when he sees a woman, so basically what the hypnotist really implanted in Hal's mind is a perception of outer beauty not inner.

Nothing else backs this argument up stronger than Hal's relationship with Rosemary Shananha. Hal meets Rosemary (Paltrow) when he calls a cab. At first glance Hal thinks Rosemary is a beautiful and nice girl whose very attractive. However, we the audience soon see Rosemary's true form she is a 300 lb sized woman. So Hal's relationship with Rosemary is based on physical attraction and manipulation not that inner beauty nonsense that the critics say the movie is about. Now then when Hal's friends Mauricio Wilson (Jason Alexander from Seinfeld discovers Rosemary's form contradictory to what Hal described he flips and so does Hal. When Hal sees Rosemary's true form, he wants nothing to do with her like the slimeball that he is. Rosemary is of course baffled by Hal's sudden termination of their relationship because of course she doesn't know that Hal's been hypnotized to see only the outer beauty of people. When she sees Hal's true motivation for being with her she is obviously hurt and Hal himself is shown as the creep that he is. The Farrelly brothers then seeing as the audience has been offended with this then trap to wrap of the last 30 minutes like a cheap sitcom trying to change Hal's attitude's and the premise and trying to put Hal in a different light, but by then I was disgusted by the movie.

In fact, if you haven't seen the obvious flaw, then here it is again. The fact that Hal is hypnotized is irrelevant since Hal still sees females as objects of desire, and sex which the hypnosis was supposed to eliminate.

The Farrely Brothers add further disgust to this by making a film that totally bashes heavy woman. A couple of key scenes point this

:

* The swimming pool scene'' where we see a petite Rosemary (Paltrow) try to jump of swimming board. Then the scene changes to show Rosemary's true form as the 300lb woman she is and then jumping of the board to produce a tidal wave of waves across Hal. Now this was supposed to be funny. Haha it's funny, if you like bashing heavy people. Then of course there's the bedroom scenes where Hal and Rosemary are going to be intimate and Hal still stupid, bias and hypnotized being babbled by the large bra that Rosemary throws at him. Please. These are just two scenes here that call for a joke at the expense of big women. It's disgusting. The fact that Hal (Black) is likewise a prejudicial and hypocritical guy who is repulsed by Rosemary's true form is also repulsive.

The Farrelly Brother try to make out this Hal character as a good guy but obviously with everything I pointed out proves he is not. If guys like Hal existed in real life, they'd probably be beaten to a pulp for all their prejudices and contradictions.

The Farrelly brothers ridiculously called this a love story but it is not. They also had the nerve to say that movies like ''Shrek'' sold out, when it comes to the weight issue, when in fact, Shrek shows the love between 2 identical characters of same shape and size. By saying that ''Shrek'' and ''Shallow Hal'' are almost the same the Farelly's hoped to shield their movie from criticism but it didn't work. Even Disney executives were mad that the brothers stooped that low.

The movie was especially hated again by people in the community especially  big women and it's no surprise.

Yeah you might get a couple of brief jokes here and then, but the movie has no substance and is mean spirited all the way. Speaking of no substance, Jack Black is the worst actor I've seen, he emulates to be a wannabee John Belushi type comedian, but he not even close in coming to the genius that Belushi has.",1096329600,16,6357,4.565408252853381

It's a mix-mash of a movie.
You may still enjoy it, but it's almost like 3 movies in 1:
1.  The comedy - Shallow Hal
2.  The tasteless comedy - complete with Rhino and Water Buffalo jokes, breaking chairs, and other insults
3.  The social commentary and heartwarming feel-good romance.
Mostly, it's #'s 1 & 2 that don't jive with each other.  This isn't a 'straight' comedy, because it's marred with insensitive jokes that COULD have been used just to enhance the feelings at the beginning, but even at the end of the movie they're still throwing them around.  It's just a mess of a movie.  They add some feel-good commentary, but *other characters* don't act consistently, and when they do stir up more responsible feelings, they let them die under the next rhino joke.

After finally being able to watch this, I give the Farrelly Bros. two thumbs up, along with Jack Black. Paltrow I thought did a good job at being kind of shy, yet accepting of how her character was.
Only thing that did not fit with this film were Rosemary's clothes. No way would a bigger girl wear a bikini, a skirt that went above her knees, high heels ALL the time, and tank tops. We know what to wear to make us look good and those certainly wouldn't work.
All in all, I recommend this film to all bigger people, ugly people, people with outrageously curly hair and braces. It'll make you not care about your physical appearance as much.

Jack Black really comes into his own in this sarcastic film about a man who just can't seem to find a someone, he is always is looking on the outward appearance and he thinks he is the 'cat's meow.'
There are so many funny scenes, Hal and his friend, played by Jason Alexander, are just two losers who are constantly rating the girls they talk with thinking they have something going on themselves.
Alexander does a great job as Hal's friend, Mauricio, who supports Hal throughout his escapades, then when Hal has been changed and is dating women that look good only to him, he, well, really comes to life.  Alexander's one liners are really only things people think........'the giraffe or the rhino???'
Jack Black is very funny when he looks at Alexander strangely as Mauricio rejects his own very attractive girlfriend who has only a small defect.
There are so many great ironies and look at the trailers and added features.

The plot isn`t deep, just about a shallow guy, Hal (wisely played by Jack Black) who, due to a little confusion, develops an ability to see women`s inner beauty. He comes across Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), and suddently starts caring for her, even if he doesn`t acknowledge that she is, in fact, fat (because, well, he only sees her inner beauty). From this point on, we follow Jack`s discoveries and the choices he will have to deal with.
True, this plot isn`t really earth-shattering, but for the most part it works and its both funny and compelling (the directors and actors actually make us care for the characters), delivering an enjoyable comedy, even if a bit predictable at parts. It also helps that it avoids the stupid gross-out humour that is so used nowadays, generating some genuine laughs.
Yes, ""Shallow Hal"" is a feel-good movie, even a bit preachy, but it somehow suceeds very well. It seems that the Farrelys know how to make simple movies with heart, so it`s better to leave the cynism away for a while.",1076457600,2,1194,4.7729468599033815
1434363,4,B00005JKLQ,"The Farrelly Brothers' Shallow Hal gives Jack Black his first starring role in a major Hollywood motion picture.  The movie also stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Jason Alexander.

Jack Black plays Hal Larson, a completely shallow individual who judges women solely on their appearances, even though Hal isn't what most would consider an attractive man.  This precludes him from developing any meaningful relationships in his life, but given him and his friend's Mauricio (Jason Alexander) views towards women in general, they garner little sympathy from the viewer.  A chance meeting with television self help guru Tony Robbins changes this for Hal.  After a lengthy discussion in a stalled elevator, Tony Robbins decides to give Hal a gift, allowing Hal to only see the inner beauty of not only women, but people in general.  This causes Hal to see women who may not be considered physically attractive to most appear to be the most beautiful women in the world, given that they have inner beauty.  This new view on women, or beer goggle laser surgery, as Mauricio puts it, allows Hal to meet Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), the most beautiful woman he has ever seen, and who also happens to be the daughter of his boss.  Hal is instantly smitten with Rosemary, even though in reality, she is profoundly obese.  Eventually Mauricio discovers what happened to his friend, and convinces Tony Robbins to tell him how to bring back the 'old' Hal.  Does Hal, who now can see Rosemary as she really is, revert back to his old ways or accept that beauty is in the eye of the beholder?

Jack Black is truly funny in this movie, but I think Jason Alexander almost outdoes him in basically bring the role of George from the television show Senfield to the film, tweaking it a little bit to make him so completely hollow in character.  Paltrow also performs very well, despite her having to wear a suit that makes her appear a couple of hundred pounds heavier than in reality.  The Farrelly Brother succeed again in bringing humor to subject matter most probably wouldn't touch, and allowing us not an opportunity to laugh at obesity, but to laugh at the superficialities many of us have, conditioned into us through the various forms of media we ingest on a daily basis.  This movie, while maybe not as funny as There's Something About Mary (1998) or Dumb and Dumber (1994), is a bit more touching and that served to balance the story out nicely.

Presented here is a wide screen anamorphic print, with quite a bit of extra features like deleted scenes, featurettes, a music video by Shelby Lyne, and commentary by the Farrelly Brothers.  I'll leave you with a couple of my favorite lines from the movie involving Mauricio (Jason Alexander) and Tony Robbins debating Hal's new perspective...

Mauricio: The thing is all the women he's been seeing are ugly.
Tony Robbins: Who says they're ugly?
Mauricio: Bausch & Lomb.

Tony Robbins:  Haven't you ever heard that beauty is in the eye of the beholder?
Mauricio: Have you heard the song ""Who Let The Dogs Out""?

A short, pudgy, Pillsbury doughboy with an arsenal of maniacal facial expressions, Black is absolutely perfect as ""Shallow Hal"" Larson, an average guy looking for love in all the wrong places (namely, gorgeous women out of his league).  And when Hal is ""tricked"" by motivational icon Tony Robbins to only see the ""inner beauty"" of people, the stage is set for a hilarious romp, courtesy of the Farrelly brothers.
And indeed, Hal's new perspective does bring romance, a heart-pounding love with blonde knockout Rosemary Shanahan (a stunning Gwyneth Paltrow).  Problem is, Hal sees a supermodel--everyone else sees the ""real"" Rosemary, a profoundly obese woman.  Oblivious to the incredulity of those around him--including Rosemary--Hal falls even more in love, treating his lady like a goddess.  Only when the ""spell"" is broken does Hal realize it's time to do some soul searching, to challenge his built-in bias for physical beauty.  His subsequent epiphany is funny; it's also quite poignant.
Jason Alexander as Hal's equally shallow best friend Mauricio is hysterical; and be sure to keep watching through the closing credits for an extra treat from Rene Kirby, a physically disabled actor who puts a whole new dimension into snow skiing.

After that I naturally despised those directors. But something about the trailer of this film made me go see it.
And it really touched my heart. It's a good movie about good people, but at the same time the most opposite thing to ""The Sound of Music"" imaginable. It's a movie that makes you feel good about rooting for the actual good guys of real life - not super-heroes or Mad-Max kind of cops, but those who volunteer to go to hospitals and visit children who have sustained severe burns, people who don't care how much money you have, people who need to see your inner beauty to fall in love with you, etc.
Gwyneth Paltrow and Black are just perfect. They really moved me.
The scene where the gold digger explains Paltrow how she ""fell in love"" with a guy she had known for years once he came by a lot of money, might be forgotten as one of those beautiful movie moments that will forever go unsung because the directors ruined their shot at being considered ""serious"" artists.

So seeing the names of these masters of superficial, often crude buffoonery attached to this fairly thought-provoking entry is, to say the least, a pleasant surprise.
The movie tackles a theme that about 90% of the world's heterosexual male population can relate to: our obsession with female beauty. Hal (Jack Black) is searching for his ideal girl, and she has to have it all - physically, that is. To make matters worse, he makes no bones about his fixation with beauty, and is even a bit obnoxious about it (""So should I apologize for my high standards?""). Naturally, his officemates chide him for being, well, shallow. The fun starts when Hal has a chance encounter with self-help guru Tony Robbins, who hypnotizes him into seeing only the inner beauty of people. Kazam, it works. Hal sees even the ugliest women as beautiful. The standout is Rosemary, a 300-pound mastodon of a woman whom Hal sees as a svelte knockout. Gwyneth Paltrow plays both Rosemarys, wearing a prosthetic fat suit as the ""real"" Rosemary.
Now, Mauricio, Hal's well-intentioned but misguided friend, can't figure out why Hal is so smitten with the obese Rosemary, until he finds out what Robbins did, and talks him into telling him the words that will break the hypnotic spell. Bad move, it turns out.

Hal: Who do you think is the most beautiful woman in the world?
Mauricio: Wonder Woman.
Hal: Okay...let's say everyone else in the world thought Wonder Woman was ugly.
Mauricio: It wouldn't matter. Because I know they'd be wrong.
Hal: See! That's what I had with Rosemary! I saw a knockout, I don't care what anybody else saw!
Mauricio: You're right. I guess I really did screw you then.
That little snippet just about sums up the lesson this film attempts to impart. And you know what, it succeeds. Incredibly, this Farrelly serving is actually capable of stimulating some serious thought about people's superficial preoccupation with outward appearances.

This movie is not without flaws, mainly in the form of opportune coincidences. For example, I found it just a tad too convenient that Rosemary just happened to be the daughter of Hal's boss. It certainly wouldn't have hurt storytelling-wise if Hal had met her at the office (say, she visits her Dad, he sees her, doesn't know she's the boss's daughter, he's instantly infatuated). Even more contrived was the appearance of the ""real"" Katrina, who happens to walk by at just the right time: when Mauricio is convincing Hal that he wasn't seeing women as they really are.
But overall, you can gloss over these minor lapses and still enjoy the movie, and even give some thought to the insight into human behavior it portrays. And you can also appreciate the fact that this film succeeds admirably on another front: it gives a fresh new twist to one of the oldest, most worn-out clichs. True love is indeed blind.",1064880000,,3041,4.812619502868069

 Most of the comedy in this movie comes from the difference  between Hal's view of people and the reality.  For example, the very fit Gwyneth Paltrow causes a monster tidal wave after doing a cannonball.  Well, I think you get the idea.
  Many people criticize this movie because they believe it makes fun of overweight and disabled people.  On the contrary, this movie has a really warm heart.  The humor isn't malicious.  The overweight and disabled are treated no differently than the other people in this movie.  The Farrelly Brothers show more heart toward the disabled  than the rest of Hollywood.

""Me, Myself. and Irene"" is a pretty funny, though somewhat sophomoric, movie. It is also pretty filthy, at times, and definitely not for the moviegoer of delicate sensibilities. There is something to offend just about everyone, so be prepared.
The basic premise of the movie is simple. A Rhode Island state trooper, Charley Baileygates, played by Jim Carrey, marries the prettiest and smartest girl in town. After she gives birth to triplets for whom Charley could not possibly be the father, for reasons obvious to the viewer, she later leaves him for another man, her soul mate and likely father of the triplets. She leaves Charley with the triplets, whom he raises as his own. The cuckolded Charley goes on to become the town joke and a seriously repressed man.
Eighteen years later, he snaps and begins to express his anger through an alternate personality and quintessential bad boy who calls himself Hank. Hank has attitude and plenty of it, and he lets everyone know that he is mad as hell and is not going to take it anymore. Charley's superiors send him to be evaluated, and he is given medication to control his psychiatric disorder.
Enter Irene, played by Renee Zellweger. Charley is asked to escort her to upstate New York where she is ostensibly wanted on a hit and run. Unbeknownst to either of them, she is being hunted down by dirty cops who are looking to silence her, as it is believed that she may have information that could take down her crooked ex boyfriend who is being investigated by the EPA.
During their trip, Hank, Charley, and Irene have a host of adventures, which are often hilarious, as Charley and Hank battle over who will become the dominant personality. The low key Zellweger is a good foil for the rubber faced Carrey's physical comedy. As Charley and Irene are pursued by the dirty cops, the now grown triplets, funny and profane, also add another element, as they go to their father's rescue.
The Farrelly brothers and Jim Carrey are a match made in heaven. Their style suits Carrey's, as the movie is full of the physical comedy and sight gags which are Carrey's forte.
""Shallow Hal""  is one of the better films by the Farrelly brothers. Though they have not shaken off their lowbrow sense of humor, they have managed to better incorporate it into their film, so as not to lose all credibility. As a result, they have put together a pretty decent and unusual romantic comedy.
The plot revolves around our not so good looking leading man, Hal Larson (Jack Black) who, due a traumatic scene with his dying father when only nine years old, is fixated on dating only women who have super model looks. Pumped up by his equally not so good looking, best friend, Mauricio Wilson (Jason Alexander), Hal is hell-bent on dating only good looking women no matter how stupid, mean, or self absorbed they may be. It is no wonder that he has yet to find the woman of his dreams.
A run in with motivational speaker, Tony Robbins, changes Hal's life, when Tony places a subliminal message into Hal's subconscious, causing him to see only the person's inner beauty. When his path crosses that of the morbidly obese, but warm and kindly Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow), it is love at first sight for him. He does not see a fat girl but a beautiful and luminous Gwyneth Paltrow.
Hal continues to see only the inner beauty of all those whom he meets,
until he is brought back to a jarring reality by his erstwhile best friend. What happens when faced with the reality of having a morbidly obese girlfriend is a trial and tribulation that only Hal can resolve. Will true love win out? Watch the movie and find out.
Gwyneth Paltrow is sensational as Rosemary. Her delivery is affecting, as she comes across as sensitive, sweet, and hesitant, as well as somewhat lacking in confidence. She is absolutely incandescent in the role. She effectively plays the part of Rosemary, as if she were a young woman unused to the attentions of a suitor. She is also quite funny at times, as Hal's comedic foil.
Jason Black, as Hal, is also funny, though somewhat wooden. He is obviously a comedian, rather than an actor. Still, he manages to play his part effectively, overall, though I found him to be somewhat uncharismatic. Jason Alexander plays his role a bit too over the top, almost manic, and ends up being more obnoxious, rather than funny. In the end, however, when his own personal secret comes out, it really is a hilarious moment in true Farrelly brothers fashion. The rest of the supporting cast is very good and effectively contribute to the comedic efforts of the film.
While this film emphasizes that inner beauty is what is important, it does so, however, while still making fun of fat people at their expense. When Gwyneth Paltrow asks for a slice of cake and proceeds to cut off a third of the cake for herself, the film is continuing to propagate stereotypic notions of fat people. A number of sight gags further serve to underscore this premise. This is, however, a Farrelly brothers comedy, after all, and to be expected.",1064016000,2,5221,4.699781659388647

1434406,4,B00005JKLQ,"What is the world coming to when a movie by the Farrelly Brothers makes me cry?  I knew I was being set up for something Hal (Jack Black) goes with his new girlfriend Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) to the Children's Hospital where she volunteers and has a great time with the kids.  I knew that Hal was missing something and I could not figure out what it was either (except that it was not contagious), and when the revelation came it floored me almost as much as it did Hal.  We live in interesting times, to say the least.
You all know the basic premise of ""Shallow Hal.""  Our hero is only interested in what women look like.  There is an unnecessary prologue in which Hal's dying father imparts some drug-induced wisdom that supposedly programs Hal to be shallow.  However, he apparently learned how to be inept with women all on his own.  Then he has a chance encounter with self-help guru Tony Robbins (played by self-help guru Tony Robbins in a brilliant bit of casting).  Now when he goes off into the world, Hal will see the inner beauty of women.  Actually he is told it will apply to any ""person"" he sees, but it does not work on Hal's best friend, Mauricio (Jason Alexander), which would have been interesting, and apparently only works once in ""reverse"" over the course of the film.  Hal is suddenly having great success with a bevy of beautiful women, but it is Rosemary with whom he is completely smitten.
Granted, there is an inherent flaw in turning inner beauty into outer beauty for a man who has been totally obsessed with the latter, because on the intellectual level that defeats the whole purpose of the fable being told here.  In a sense, Hal now gets to have his cake and eat it too.  I wonder if this film would have worked the other way around, where we always see the truth and get only brief glimpses of what Hal sees.  But then Gwyneth Paltrow is not going to be playing the lead, and that would have been a shame.
As long as I am making outrageous comments about this film I might as well say that Paltrow's performance in ""Shallow Hal"" is better than her Oscar winning performance in ""Shakespeare in Love.""  Forget about the scenes where she wears the ""fat suit,"" it is the rest of the film where she does a marvelous job of acting like an overweight person.  Usually Paltrow's character is like fine porcelain china, but this time around her character has some weight (sorry, you knew that was coming), and in this film she is the most attractive she has ever been as far as I am concerned.  For most of the film Black tries too hard, clearly aware he is in a Farrelly brothers film, but in the key scenes (including the one that made me cry) he is on target and when it comes to playing an annoying sidekick Jason Alexander is in a league by himself.  But everybody's favorite supporting character is Walt (Rene Kirby), who has spina bifida and establishes the standard by which we judge Hal and the rest of the males in this film (Why doesn't the ""inner beauty"" charm work on him?  Because he is male?  These things bother me).  Remember that this is one of those films where you have to watch the credits because there is something at the end.
The trailer for ""Shallow Hal"" gives away virtually every major sight gag in the film, which is actually good because you gloss over those while you watch it and keep your focus on the relationship between Jack and Rosemary.  One of the other surprises of this film is that most of the jokes are at Hal's expense and not Rosemary's.  But once you get past Paltrow's performance and a tearjerker scene, this ends up being a relatively minor surprise.  In the end, ""Shallow Hall"" is the least funny Farrelly Brothers movie, which is actually appropriate.",1062633600,,3727,4.488888888888889

1434410,4,B00005JKLQ,"Everyone probably knows the plot by now: Hal (played by Jack Black) is as shallow as any typical young heterosexual male who prefers only the best-looking females, as opposed to going for females with good-natured personalities (with physically undesirable aspects.) All of this changes when a twist of fate brings him into contact with a motivational speaker (Tony Robbins.) He then gets hypnotized into seeing the inner beauty of people (which comes off as gorgeous physical appearances), as opposed to seeing their so-called ""undesirable"" physical attributes. He meets a gorgeous gal named Rosemary (played by Gwyneth Paltrow), and falls for her. Little does he know that she's a grossly overweight female, as opposed to the tall, thin, blonde-haired bombshell that he sees (as the result of the hypnosis he's undergone.) Meanwhile, his close friend (played by Jason Alexander) notices the change in Hal's perceptions, and tries to figure out the cause of this.
While many people note the change in approach from The Farrelly Brothers' normally immature, gross-out comedies, I have to venture to say that this change isn't as large as some note, but nevertheless, it can be spotted. Although There's Something About Mary featured many immature gags revolving around bodily fluids and such other seemingly taboo subjects, underneath it all, I found it to be a poignant (although kooky) love story with heart and a message. However, what makes this change more relevant, is that the gross-outs are toned down considerably, and the poignant aspects are not camouflaged. While the movie does have it's humorous moments (Jason Alexander's character in general was the funniest thing about the movie for me), I hesitate to call it a non-stop laugh fest, and is not in the same league as other typical comedies. Jack Black in particular didn't crack me up as much as he did in say Orange County. This isn't a bad thing, as his character is mostly the central focus in the film, and it does not represent anything as remotely silly as what was featured in the aforementioned film. Instead, he takes on a more ambiguous role - one of which exhibits a balance of subtle humor and good-hearted thoughtfulness.
I rate this 4 stars out of personal preference, but this film is quite clever with it's ingenious use of dialogue, as well as exhibiting a nice balance between subtle humor and thought-provoking attributes.",1056672000,,2408,5.06801007556675
1434411,4,B00005JKLQ,"Shallow Hal is a movie with guts.  It pokes fun at the social inclinations that beauty is everything.  It also gives us a story that is more surprisingly touching coming from the Farrelly brothers.  Jack Black plays Hal, who is good guy, but has the shallowness seed planted at an early age by his father.  He tends to only go after gorgeous women who he doesn't have a chance with, who also tend to be snobbish or too into their own looks.  After getting stuck in an elevator with Tony Robbins, he is given the gift of only seeing 'inner beauty' of people.  This not only lets him see homley or overweight women (with good hearts and intentions) as gorgeous but to see golddiggers and manipulative woman as ugly hags.  Not realizing his gift, he gets into a relationship with an obese girl, Rosemary (Gweneth Paltrow, who of course looks as good as she ever has) who can't understand why he thinks she's so pretty.  The morality play that pans out is simple, but teaches Hal a lesson.  The looks didn't matter once he realizes his true feelings for her.  The movie is sweet and sensitive but hits the subject matter with the grace of a drunk elephant.  Nothing is left sacred and the result is funny, touching and sometimes brutally honest story about how we have set rules in society about looks.",1056499200,,1298,4.527896995708154

Oh, trust me, SHALLOW HAL is absolutely full of one-liners like that, and that is probably the best line in the whole movie. The movie opens with the titular character promising his dying father to only date chicks with huge breasts. Hal (Jack Black) grows up to be the king of all womanizers, although he ain't so anantomically perfect and neither is his equally un-seductive buddy Mauricio (Jason Alexander),whose even more shallow than Hal. Hal's attitude changes with an elevetor encounter with Tony Robbins (Himself),who alters Hal's outlook on looks so that he can only see people for what's inside. He soon winds up in the sack with Rosemary (Gweneth Paltrow), whos may appear to be the perfect dream date to Hal, but is actually a gloroiusly overweight cookie monster. How over weight is she? Well, let's put it this way. When Rosemary causes that cahir with steel legs to collapse under her, it's a sign to buy about $500 worth of slimfast. This is, of course, a Farrely brothers movie, so that not the only joke Rosemary is the butt of. There's one scene where she and Hal are in a canoe, with her in front in Hal in back. Who do you think is five feet higher than he should be? Then, one of the best scenes is where Rosemary removes her extra small underwear, tosses them to Hal, and suddenly, they've blown up to the size of a pitbull. I don't think I've ever laughed as hard at a comedy, at least not at a Farrely brothers film. Boy, they sure know how to make you laugh.",1055376000,,1608,4.454237288135594

Obesity is a many faceted problem facing your country. A film like this, although 'rip roaringly funny' at times, is as intellectually vacuous as one of the many confections our gal pal fat-suited Gwyneth character stuffs down her well worn gullet. The Farrely's seem not to want to proliferate their views that much further, thereby plonking their gas-stockpiled posteriors down on either one or the other side of the proverbial polemic fence. 'Toilet humour' is a miniscule impingement on various social values, mores etc., which does not skim the surface of 'what lies beneath'(e.g. bodily function/scat jokes, which do relate to the violation widespread personal hygene habits  versus a sociological study of the lack of tangible faith in the American psyche leading to abesity- or something....). The creators of this film seem to want to supplicate and genuflect at the audience for all the un-p.c., audience alienating (many of your box office punters are, indeed, overweight) 'fat jokes' by tacking on episodes of such sacharrine sweetness and banality throughout the film and especially towards the eye-rollingly soporific denoument.

This money stars Jack Black, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jason Alexander among a great ensemble cast that really makes this movie.  The movie is about Hal Larson played by Jack Black and his quest to find the perfect woman.  I love Hal's description of the perfect woman that includes parts of Michelle Pieffer, Britney Spears, Paulina, Heidi Klum, Rebecca Romain and many other.  There is also a great cameo from Banana Hands aka. Tony Robbins in this movie.  Basically Hal gets stuck in the elevator with Tony Robbins who hypnotizes Hal to only see the inner beauty of the women he meets and this leads to him falling in love with Rosemary, incredibly played by Gwyneth Paltrow.  Hal sees Rosemary as a drop-dead gorgeous blonde who weighs about 110 lbs.  In reality Rosemary is a huge woman in the 350+ lbs range.  You can just imagine the comedy writing itself as this movie unfolds.
Another great thing about this movie is the soundtrack.  There are some great songs from Sheryl Crow, Shelby Lynne, Phoenix, Cake among others.  I just love the song 'Too Young' by Phoenix in the movie, but you won't see if in the soundtrack if you buy the CD.

In a chance meeting with Tony Robbins in a stuck elevator, Hal is given the gift of seeing beauty in those he would normally not find so beautiful.  Our hypnotized hero falls for RoseMary, a strikingly good woman who also happens to weigh about 300 lbs.  But Hal's hypnosis blinds him to her girth and he only sees the beauty in her.  And so goes typical romantic comedy...boy meets girl, boy loses girl....
Jack Black gives a very nice performance as a 'lounge lizard' who learns the error of his ways and what true love really means.  Even Gweneth Paltrow manages to portray the mannerisms of a fat person as a skinny person. (her thin Rosemary is embodied with all the self-concious ticks, and they are displayed very low key.)

1434447,2,B00005JKLQ,"""Shallow Hal"" introduces us to Hal Larson, a man completely obsessed with physical beauty due to his father's dying (but heavily drugged) words. Even though he is not overly-attractive himself, Hal persues only Barbie-Doll-Perfect women with terribly limited success until he meets Tony Robbins, noted self-help wiz. Robbins ""de-hypnotizes"" Hal, allowing him to see the inner beauty of a person reflected in their outward appearance. Thus, hefty Rosemary (a ""rhino,"" to quote Jason Alexander's character, Mauricio) appears to Hal to be a slim, attractive Gwenyth Paltrow, and other stereotypically unattractive women appear to be supermodels.
Theoretically, this teaches us that external beauty isn't important - it's what's inside that counts. Lovely idea; however, it is carried off through faulty logic. The trouble is that by showing inner beauty as external beauty, the movie reinforces the whole Physical Beauty Matters concept. Argh. It would be difficult to pull this movie off without doing that, though, and overall, the movie is generally sensitive to size and physical appearance issues. The writers address some of the harsh realities of being large without losing their comedic edge, and of course Hal learns some important life lessons along the way. Paltrow does a lovely job of being aware of her size without being apologetic - she is brave and strong, but still a bit vulnerable and very sweet.
Naturally, there has to be some conflict here somewhere, right? Hal couldn't simply be happy with Rosemary and have the movie end. No, well-intentioned Mauricio hunts down Robbins and finds out how to reverse the hypnotism. Much trauma ensues after, of course, and I won't ruin the (predictable) ending.
The movie is basically fairly enjoyable fluff, without much redeeming social value. Jack Black is his usual charming, doofy self, and Gwenyth is lovely, shy and quick-witted. There are surely better movies in this genre, but if nothing else is on...",1049587200,2,1967,5.287539936102236

The bottom line is that ""Shallow Hal"" does have a moral that is superficially open-minded and good. However, don't delve too deeply, because you will get mired in the paradox that inner beauty is represented by physical beauty in the movie or that at the end, although Hal loves Rosemary, is he really attracted to the ""real"" woman?
I agree with other reviewers that there was less comedy in this movie, as most of the jokes centered around Rosemary breaking furniture or other people calling her a rhino. The funniest moment probably involves Jason Alexander and his secret physical flaw. Ultimately, it is difficult to get past the idea that the comedy in this movie is at the expense of those less physically attractive, but the moral is that physical beauty does not true love make.
Also, the extras on this DVD are relatively disappointing, as you are grateful the deleted scenes were deleted, and the interviews are predictable (Gwyneth: ""It's about a guy named Hal who is shallow...""). The extras add no depth.",1049068800,3,1177,4.8316831683168315

Hal's romance with the obese Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) has him in ecstacy while his equally shallow buddy Mauricio (Jason Alexander) reels in disbelief.

As usual, the Farrellys manage to remain just this side of the good taste barrier by presenting potentially offensive material with a sweetness and empathy that allows us to laugh at the situation without laughing at the characters themselves.  For example, Hal and Mauricio's dismissive attitudes and shameful comments about women would have been unforgiveable had they been uttered by, say, Ben Affleck or Tom Cruise or even Jim Carrey.  However, by placing them in the mouths of Black and Alexander, who are themselves far from being the epitome of male physical beauty, the focus remains on the ridiculousness of the standard to which they hold other people.

  The story focuses on the life of a shallow man named Hal, played by Jack Black (High Fidelity). He spends his nights with his shallow buddy Mauricio (Jason Alexander), hanging out in dance clubs, hitting on beautiful women completely out their league. Hal leads a simple, arrogant, and particularly useless life. From the beginning of the film, we remember the brief scene that shows Hal as a child, in a hospital, talking to his dying father, who is heavily sedated with pain killers. His father gives him some pretty atrocious advice for picking out women, saying ""marrying for love got him in trouble..."" Unaware of his father's ""morphine trip,"" he is somewhat hypnotized after he's traumatized from his father's later passing. As fate would have it, when Hal is all grown up he gets trapped in an elevator with self-guru Tony Robbins, who gives Hal an amazing gift: to see the inner beauty of people. Since the death of Hal's father, he's been choosing women to date solely based on their appearance, and only their appearance. Hal is ""dehypnotized,"" as Tony calls it, to see the people (especially women) how they really are, literally. When Hal meets Rosemary (played by Paltrow, sometimes in a fat-suit), an obese but amazing woman with generous and friendly qualities, though her hurt has been covered up. Thanks to Hal's meeting with Tony Robbins, he sees Rosemary as Paltrow's sexy, slender and fit self, though he is the only one who can see her like this. As Hal's perception is completely messed up, we are taken through some mildly offensive and frivolous jokes that involve Hal being the only person who cannot see that Rosemary's overweight. When Hal compliments her, unaware of his ""gift,"" she can only take his comments as immature or sarcastic. Paltrow's excellence doesn't make her differentiate between ""thin Rosemary"" and ""overweight Rosemary,"" which really helps in giving people the message they need to receive.
  Directed by the Farrelly Brothers (There's Something About Mary), the film really does have a big-hearted sensitive side that can clearly be seen if you look at the moral of the story. Shallow Hal is a combination of silly gags and difficult situations. Besides some of the comedy, the film takes us through some hard situations that involve hurtful comments and embarrassing situations when one is different. Rosemary states ""I know what I am and I know what I'm not,"" and gets offended when Hal calls her beautiful. Up to the end, the overall film is a beauty that originally reflects the message of true love. Black and Paltrow work well together, and the film is funny, but not because of some brief ""fat jokes.""

They don not think about inside qualities that evyone has, like feelings, thoughts, intelligence, and honesty, which are the most important values in each human being. In addition, they only want to have a beatiful woman or a beautiful man.
In this movie you can see good and bad points. For instance, I can tell you that the most important point in this world is not the external beauty, rather the internal beauty just as Shall saw in Rossmery. Also, I can tell you one bad point that the human beings still have, it is to look at the physical aspect when we need to find our perfect partner.
In this movie Shall is trying to find his perfect woman who must be beautiful for outside, but he has not ever thought in the inside world that everyone has. On day, he found an important businessman who hypnotized him. At this time, Shall could see the inside beauty in everybody reflected in their outside body. Next, he found his perfect woman called Rossmery. In the begining she could not understand him because she knew that she was not a beautiful woman, but she decided to accept him. Then, they shared  many things  together, and they fell in love with eache other.
Then Shall's friend who could see the reality  went to the businessman's office and he explaned to him what has happened with Shall.  After that, Shall lost the hypnotism and he was able to see the reality. Then he did no talk to Rossmery and he turned her down. finally, he recognized his feeling and love for her, and ge decided to accept her just as she is. He searched her and they they lived happily ever after.
I think this movie has several topics very controversies inside our actual society with for instance, fatness, ugliness, beauty and inteligence. Also I think that our society is influenced for by different means of communications, which sell us the stereotype about the perfect woman or perfect man. In consequence, many people only search the outside beauty without looking inside each person.
I like this movie because it show that ouside beauty can be the reflection of our inside world. In conclusion, I think that the most important is what you believe about yourself  because these thoughts are shown in your outside body.",1036627200,,2490,4.611738148984198
1434482,1,B00005JKLQ,"I thought that ""There's something about Mary"" was one of the funniest comedy's of the 90's, definitely not the most sophisticated, but hilarious nonetheless.
With that in mind, I thought ""Shallow Hal"" the storyline of which had the potential to be something truly special, was an abysmal failure. I wasn't offended by it; I just thought that it had an astounding lack of humour. Gag's passed me by (""Cankles"" am I missing something here?) and the low humour that made Mary so enjoyable was strained here, like a class clown who is trying too hard. The one joke (that Hal couldn't see the physical reality of the people around him) was repeated ad-nausum, the characters lacked any kind of depth, being reduced mere caricatures. The scene with the little girl in the burns unit which had the potential to touch the viewer and to be the pivot point in both the film and Hal's life was handled with out the slightest hint of subtlety, which combined with Black's limited acting range, meant that this potentially magical and horrific scene would have been better left on the cutting room floor.

I saw this movie's trailer and I was offended. It's saying that all fat women are ugly and big. I think that's wrong because lots of fat women are not fat than Gwenith Pawltrow and she was smart so why are you saying i'm not like her because I'm fat? Everyone was a steryotype and Jak Blak was stoopid. bye.""
Ha! Please. Those one-star reviewers are complaining for THEIR PROBLEMS! For one thing, they haven't seen the film. Here's the plot: Jack Black is a selfish man who only likes women who have beauty who is one day given the power by a hypnotist (or something of that nature) to see women not for their genetical beauty but their INNER BEAUTY. So he meets a friendly, yet obese young women (Gwenith Paltrow) and falls in love not knowing her physical appearance. Jack Black sees her as a gorgeous young woman not knowing her true appearance. Jason Alexander tries to persuade him not to keep going out with her since he can see her for real. I won't give the ending away simply because I don't want to. It gives the message that beauty may be in the eyes of the beholder, but it can be even more likely to behold someone's inner beauty through basic understanding. Of course, most of you protestors are too dumb to understand that. Because of message however, there is not a huge emphasis on acting IMO. They all do a decent job though.
Second: Where does the movie say anything about it being bad to be fat? huh??? Does the movie's MESSAGE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT BEING BAD TO BE LIKE YOU????? um, no. Read above.
Third: If you don't like the looks of the movie, don't see it. Simple. If the trailer is too much for you, that's another story...
Fourth: Why blame a comedy for discrimination against fat people? I don't remember that being a very big issue. It's just a waste of space. The African American people were important because they had very few rights and were constantly victims of violence and almost no films were racial bias against them all. Do lots of fat people have very few rights? No. They have the same rights as you or I have and aren't always the focus in these types of films. Genetical disfigurement (or whatever you wish to call it) and semi-screwball comedy have little or no connection.
Anyway, I would recommend this film to someone who has an open-mind and is not offended by unimportant trifles. It's not really one of the best films I've seen, but if you want to call on it for entertainment, THAT I would recommend. I hope this gets posted :)",1036022400,,2642,4.438271604938271

It was better. The Farrely brothers managed to get the Beauty-comes-From-inside message through loud and clear. The plot of the movie involves Hal,who is so shallow that he only dates the most gorgeous girls,then he is hypnotized to see everyone as they are on the inside. He meets overweight Rosemary and sees a slim bombshell. He meets Rosemary's friend,a grumpy children's nurse,and sees the outwardly beautiful girl as a shrivelled up old hag!!He meets child burn victims and does not see their scars. It is an enjoyable movie.",1034380800,,704,4.8264462809917354
1434516,4,B00005JKLQ,"In this comedy outing from the well known Farrelly Brothers team, we have a young, average-looking man named Hal, whose father convinced him as an impressionable youngster, that only the attractive women in the world, are worth persuing.  Dad said this, never taking into account, that being attractive himself, or the actual  shortage of good looks on Hals' part, would be a detriment to his persuits.  He thinks he's got every right to demand perfection in women, and he won't settle for anyone more in his league.

 After countless rebuffs in clubs and bars with a fellow shallow Pal, Seinfeld alum, Jason Alexander WITH hair, he meets Anthony Robbins, self help guru while trapped in an elevator. Hal confides in Robbins, who plays himself, and Robbins comes up with a way to make Hal see the inner beauty of women, thus making him irresistible to all.

 The laughs begin as Hal doesn't realize that from that moment on, what he sees, is not what the rest of the world is seeing.  Particularly when he meets Rosemary, a seemingly beautiful blonde played by Gwyneth Paltrow.  He persues her, much to her chagrined surprise, and his buddy played by Alexander who tries to tell Hal the truth, but to no avail.  No matter how many chairs are broken, laughs chuckled, fingers pointed, and meals gobbled, Hal believes that she is a knockout, although in reality, she's morbidly obese.

 While this sounds offensive to the overweight, it is actually done quite tastefully.  There aren't the endless fat jokes one would expect, particularly with the Farrelly track record of bizarre comedies like ""There's Something About Mary"", ""Dumb and Dumber"" and particularly ""Me Myself And Irene"" which treads in sensitive waters as well.  It's not that there aren't moments that may offend, but for the majority of the film, tolerance, acceptance and kindness to those who don't conform to the general standard of beauty, are emphasized.  Black as Hal is very earnest, and physically reminiscent of a young John Belushi.  Paltrow and Alexander also give convincing performances.  I found Paltrows' portrayal of an overweight girl new to romance particularly bittersweet.  Her performance gives the script just the right touch of credibilty, and that makes eveything ALMOST believable.

  I would recommend ""Shallow Hal"" to anyone looking for a fun, entertaining comedy that will make you smile while watching it.  This is especially perfect for that moment where you're in the mood for something ""not too heavy.""",1032652800,,2498,5.041463414634146

Hal is a lovable but misguided buffoon who learns to see the inner beauty in others, because of a spell cast by self-help guru Tony Robbins.  The movie contains some hilarious scenes, ex. Rosemary jumping in the pool, but these are not the main theme of the movie.  Hal falling in love with a woman for who she really is was the primary point, and it was handled well.  Not a terribly ""deep"" movie, but definitely a cute, fun flick.  Much better than what the Brothers have done in the past.",1032652800,,572,4.2110091743119265

1434519,4,B00005JKLQ,"I really enjoyed this movie.  Hal was a total boob, but he was kind and likable even when he was drooling over gorgeous women.  There were several scenes that I thought were quite funny, in particular his ""pink eye"" where he uses vaseline to cover his eyes so he won't see Rosemary!  This movie seemed to cause a backlash from individuals who did not think 'fat' jokes were funny.  I don't think the movie was making fun of fat people, but giving a much deeper message that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder.  I think a comedic movie to portray these messages makes it fun.  I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I found it quite enjoyable and plan to purchase a copy for my home collection.
On a character note, Jason Alexander is good, but very much like his George role from Seinfeld, so no new sides to his acting here, but his character fits the movie, so I enjoyed him too.
Gwyneth did a fine job as Rosemary, pretty and beautiful, even in her 'fat suit'.  Overall, a fun movie, worth 4 stars.",1031961600,,1023,4.269430051813472

When he grew up, he stuck to his father's words, but for some reason he never could find a perfect girl, or rather, they were too shallow to go out with him. Luckily, he runs across Self-Help guru Tony Robbins, who grants Hal the special power of seeing women by their inner beauty. Suddenly, the ugly girls are beautiful, and the beautiful girls go both ways. But when Hal finds the girl of his dreams (Gwyneth Paltrow), he can't see how extremely overweight she is. This leads to a lot of strange misunderstandings, but over time the two fall in love. Hal's best friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander), who's even more shallow than Hal, isn't going to let his friend ruin himself like this though, and does all he can to thwart the relationship. When he finally succeeds in curing Hal of his vision problems, Hal will have to learn to see inner beauty with his own eyes.

If you're a person who likes a real funny comedy with romantic scenes, then ""Shallow Hal"" is for you. This isn't a movie where you can say, ""Okay, I watched it once, I can't watch it again.""

1434521,1,B00005JKLQ,"It was a struggle for me to get through this entire movie. I kept giving it a chance, hoping it would get better - it finally did...when it was over. Jack Black plays Hal, a guy who will not settle until he finds the perfect girl because of what his father told him on his deathbed. As an adult a freak accident leaves him stuck in an elevator with self-help guru Tony Robbins, who decides to 'help' Hal with his search. Right away Hal begins to find 'perfect' girls - or so he thinks. It turns out he is the only one who sees them as perfect. His just-as-shallow friend Maurice (played by Jason Alexander) tries to tell him better, but Hal is totally in love with Rosie (Gwenyth Paltrow).

Maurice ends up tracking down Tony Robbins and breaking the spell he put on Hal, much to Hal's chagrin. After the spell is broken, Hal runs into many of the people he met earlier and they seem less perfect than he remembers him (including a heart-breaking scene with a young burn victim). He decides he really loves Rosie, no matter what and they end up together...

This movie was disappointing on so many levels, including Jack Black being Hal - he does not have much room to be shallow, which I guess is the point they were trying to make? The Farrelly brothers, known for their gross-out humor have definitely crossed the line with Shallow Hal. Spend a couple of bucks to rent Shallow Hal, but don't buy it.",1031443200,6,1402,4.409266409266409

You are bringing up the topic of how this movie may feel to others. If you have ever seen a Shallow Hal trailer or TV Spot you know that the film is about how a man who only dates PRETTY women gets the powers to see UGLY women be pretty because there inner beauty makes them very pretty. It's not complex but how do some people feel about this subject. The man character Hal(played by Jack Black)meets a girl named Rosemary(played by Gwen Palthrow) who is really 300 pounds but in the eyes of Hal he sees her inner beauty which is a skinny sexy women. Hal friend Marcio(played by Seinfeld's Jason Alexander)see's Rosemary for what her appearence's are and has to somment to Hal about it more then once. Hal does not know what Marcio is talking about because he sees Rosemary as a babe. But what about the subject. Doesn't that make some people feel angry at the Farlley Brothers who wrote and directed the movie?Wouldn't that make them angry and hate the movie?That is not true in this movie. The movie is a very touching movie which is a first in the Farlley Brothers movies. If anyone has seen There's Something About Mary,or Me Myself and Irene you would know that the Farlley Brother are not touching people but in this movie they prove themselve wrong. The movie should not make people angry at the writers because the only reason for this movie and many other comendies is for you to laugh and not pay attention to the topic's that could make people angry. That is the reason for the movies anyway.
The movie is very very funny except for a the beginning which is why I only gave the movie 4 stars instead of 5. But the DVD is loaded with extra's including 11 pretty good extra scenes. They are funny and some of them are dull but I can see why they cut those scenes out of the final film. There is also four making of features including the Comendy Central Reel Comendy special,an inside look at the makeup of the movie,a special feature about the infamous spash scene and an HBO Making Of Feature. There is also a music video of Shelby Lynn with the song ""Wall in Your Heart"".There is a commentary from the writers and directors,and many promotional spots. There is a trailer from,Minority Report,Unfaithful,The Banger Sisters,Shallow Hal,and a Shallow Hall soundtrack spot,and a Farlley Brothers DVD trailer.
So Shallow Hal is a good movie to watch and you should overlook the topic of ugly people not getting dates because even though that is a main topic of the movie you should just take the movie for what it is....a good entertaining funny movie.

1434534,5,B00005JKLQ,"Let me start off by saying I'm an extremely overweight person (OK, let's just say fat and get it over with), and I was not offended in the least at this movie. In fact, I loved it. I had a lot of empathy for the Gwyneth Paltrow character in the movie, with her extreme lack of confidence and poor self image. What makes it a great acting job on her part is that she is the VERY SAME CHARACTER whether in or out of the ""fat suit"". The only part of her performance that doesn't quite ring true is her unihibitedness in the bedroom with Jack Black. I'd think it would take a few times before she'd feel comfortable ""leaving the light on"", if you know what I mean. But, having broken a chair or two in my time and having suffered under-the-breath comments and stares I know what it's like, and that's just reality. It's a bonus realizing that Gwyneth Paltrow probably grew as a person when she ventured out in the fat suit and saw just how lonely the ""fat life"" can be.
To be honest, I also identified with Jack Black, in a way, as a guy who has higher standards than he should in the more superficial categories. And, let's face it, it doesn't hurt to have beautiful women like Gwyneth Paltrow, former Baywatch babe Brooke Burns, and Jack Black's lovely neighbor (whose name escapes me) to add to the eye-candy in this movie.
Nearly every move was perfect. It was a stroke of genius to cast self-help guru Tony Robbins as the person who ""hypnotizes"" Black's character to only see the inner beauty of people and not the outer. Jason Alexander plays, to me, what is a very George Costanza like character, rejecting his girlfriend because her second toe is half an inch longer than her big toe, when he has a secret defect revealed later in the movie that is much more grotesque. He, in fact, is much more shallow than Hal. The coolest character is Walter, who walks on all fours because he has spina bifuda. This is played by a non-actor who actually has the disease and actually gets around just that way. But that doesn't get in the way of him enjoying life to the absolute fullest.
I am normally not a big Farrelly Brothers fan. I find their movies generally crossing the line from humor to stupidity. But this movie shows that the boys have a heart. Highly recommended.",1031270400,,2268,4.41527446300716
1434535,3,B00005JKLQ,"I have to admit to being less impressed by this movie than many of my fellow reviewers. While I did enjoy certain aspects of the movie in terms of the possible lessons it had to teach, and also enjoyed some of the obvious fat jokes running through the sequences, I also had the distinct impression that the directors were employing this social commentary in an attempt to use it commercially by making it grist for a funny movie. Given the fact that this duo is well known for their infantile and coarse approach, it is hard to believe that their motives were as noble as some of the other reviewers seem to believe. Add onto that fact the unavoidable truth that for people trapped in fat and ugly exteriors, no such movie magic is likely. Their lives are anything but comical.
After all, the fact that the person Shallow Hal keeps seeing in his self-imposed cure of seeing the inner person is Gwyneth Paltrow, an astonishingly beautiful young lady.  And all the fat suits in the world cannot suspend our knowledge that underneath her actual appearance lies the irresistibly delicious morsel of human protoplasm. Therefore, pretending that we can suspend our knowledge of what Gwyneth really looks like underneath the fat suit is the key lie undercutting the whole premise of the movie as social commentary, and I for one am not buying into it. This is a slick attempt to cash in on peoples meaner and coarser feelings, and then make those feelings and reactions socially acceptable as long as we get the moral that it is no fun and no fair to have to be fat and ugly even as we are laughing at all the fat jokes that come streaming through.
Having said all that, I must also admit that the storyline is interesting, and the cast is quite credible and convincing, especially Jack Black as the title figure that transforms himself from chronic shallowness to substantial compassion along the way. So, this is at best a mixed bag. As I said earlier, I suspect the directors have deliberately mined a vein of palpable human pain and sorrow in search of a marketable movie product, and am a bit ambivalent about whether all the fat jokes in the movie really are so much in service to the learning of Shallow Hals moral lessons as they are the unfortunate grist for a comical movie that commercially exploits the sadness and pain of overweight people.  I rate it three out of five stars for that reason. Enjoy.",1030579200,8,2405,4.616822429906542

Hal is a really shallow character who seems to think of women as nothing but sex objects, he spends his free time bar hopping & whatever just looking for some woman to have sex with, caring only for her looks. The guy is rude and crude to most everyone, even Tony Robbins, who he gets trapped in an elevator with one day.
Robbins hypnotizes him (this isn't really explained in the movie)into seeing people for what they really are and not what they actually look like. For much of the rest of the movie Hal spends his time with women that are beautiful inside, he can't see how fat or ugly they are physically.
Things come to a head when Hal starts going out with the bosses daughter Rosie, she's really enormous. Hals pal, played by Jason Alexander, is a loser like Hal who is so upset by his friends weird behavior that he tracks Robbins down and learns how to break the trance. After that Hal soon ends up breaking Rosie's heart and gradually learns that it's what's inside that counts.

Hal is a shallow man, but who is otherwise good, who is obsessed with obtaining a girlfriend with a 'perfect' figure. What he doesn't realize, is that by judging people by appearences he is in fact, preventing himself from meeting a lot of great people who are emotionally beautiful.
A self help guru, realizes this, and hypnotizes HAL to see everyone for their 'inner beauty.'
I really LOVED this movie. Especially the scenes when Hal meets the Peace Corps group, (thinking they are handsome). And Gwyneth's family. Gwyneth is very convincing as a character, very emotive and I love her facial expressions.

There are a few twists, and it was entertaining to see how Hal overcame several problems- many of them years old. Hal is a man who only like beautiful women, no matter what their personality is. Then he's hypnotised to only see women what they're like on the inside, leading to some hilarious moments. Shallow Hal has a great message about not caring what people look like, just about how they act and what they do. Definitely worth renting.

The latter, probably after some initial resistance-- inasmuch as the Farrelly Brothers seem to be tackling a rather sensitive subject this time out (and ""sensitivity"" is not necessarily their milieu)-- will for whatever reason find their way to this film, only to discover that the Farrelly Brothers actually have something worthwhile to say, and moreover, that they say it extremely well.  ""Shallow Hal,"" written by Sean Moynihan, Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly, and directed by the Farrellys, uses the parlance of our times, as it were, to examine the old axiom that true beauty is, indeed, more than skin deep.  It's a universal message, it's important, and it's delivered by the Farrellys with humor and poignancy, and in a way that is altogether effective.
In no small part due to some deathbed ""pearls of wisdom"" offered to young Hal (Sasha Neulinger) by his father, the Reverend Larson (Bruce McGill), Hal carries with him into adulthood a rather, well...""shallow"" sense of what constitutes perfection, especially when it comes to the opposite, fairer sex.  And, with a good friend, Mauricio (Jason Alexander), constantly reinforcing (with his own shallow perspectives) those put forth by the late Reverend Larson, it has not placed Hal (Jack Black) in good stead with the women he encounters.  Relationships elude him like the proverbial sands through the hourglass, and he can't figure out why.
Then one auspicious day, on the heels of yet another rejection, Hal gets stuck in an elevator with none other than writer and motivational speaker Tony Robbins, the ""Mahatma of Motivation.""  And, after hearing the sad story of Hal's misfortunes with women, Robbins uses his powers and wisdom to do something about it.  He gives Hal a gift:  The ability to see the true beauty that resides within another person, beyond the often deceptive physical attributes that are in reality no more than a facade masking who that person really is.  For the first time in his life, Hal's eyes are opened, and it isn't long before he meets the most beautiful woman in the world, Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow), with whom he quickly falls desperately, deeply and passionately in love.  At last, he's happy; it's like a fairy tale.  The question is, can this particular fairy tale possibly have a happy ending?
The Farrelly Brothers, known for their cutting edge, over-the-top visually graphic gross-out humor in such films as ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Me, Myself and Irene,"" have reined it in drastically in this one, and to great effect.  To be sure, that trademark Farrelly ""touch"" is present (there is some bathroom/locker room humor), but in this case, it serves a purpose beyond shock value entertainment.  If you've seen the trailers for this film, or any clips from it, you get the idea that this is typical Farrelly Brothers fare and that there is no way that the characters involved are going to possibly emerge unscathed from it.  But what you see in those previews is basically the elements the Farrellys use to define their parameters and set up the message they want to deliver.  And it works beautifully.  They succeed in establishing Hal's misguided perspectives, as well as those of Mauricio, and from that base springs the emotional connection, empathy and compassion generated by the rest of the film as the story unfolds.
What we find, is that Hal isn't such a bad guy after all, once his eyes are opened; that a new perspective and changed attitude has served to reveal that better part of himself, as well as others.  And that, perhaps, says something about all of us.  Upon reflection, if it is possible to perceive the real beauty of another, maybe it works both ways.  As this film so succinctly points out, we, as a society, have been so programmed by peer pressure, the media and all of these inconsequential external forces, to equate ""beauty"" with all of the wrong things, that we all suffer for it, in one way or another.  And the message here is so clear:  What a wonderful world it would be, if only we could all see past the meaningless things and just see one another for who and what we really are.  Like a sage old man on a mountain, the Farrellys have crafted and delivered a layer cake, chocolate sundae of a movie; there's plenty of whipped cream on the top, but once you work your way to the center it's even better.  It's their way of using contemporary trappings to point the way to the divine mercies and offering a taste of the rewards that go to those who are wise enough to discern their meaning, and to act upon it.  Unfortunately, the ""Shallow Hals"" in the audience are going to get lost along the way, and it will be their loss.  And that certainly is not a criticism; it's just the way it is.

1434596,3,B00005JKLQ,"Ok, let me say from the beginning that I am not a huge fan of straight comedy movies.  But this is a movie with a message.  The message of seeing the inner beauty, and the movies success at getting it across, is the only reason that this flick gets an 3 star rating.  As  a comedy, if falls, middle of the road,  With a few funny moments but overall predictable.
The message of this movie is the highlight.  It is not whats on the outside but whats on the inside that counts.  And this movie follows the path of Hal as he discovers this.  A very important message wrapped in a silly film.
But any movie that warrents the star power of Gwen Paltrow (in her slim figure and in a fat suit) can ot be totally dismissed.  This is a movie that will most appeal to teens or teens at heart, dealing with the peer pressure problem.

It does qualify as a romantic comedy but the comedy end is perhaps a little weak if you're looking for a roll-on-the-floor laugh-fest.  The movie is moderately funny, due in large part to Jason Alexander who I do not remember being billed in the previews.  At any rate, I enjoyed this film and do recommend it for viewing.  However, I think this is a one-time-view movie that is worth the rent, but perhaps not worthy of putting in the personal collection.",1027036800,,538,4.5625
1434598,3,B00005JKLQ,"First of all, let me state this:  I am myself overweight - not obese, but overweight.  One of my best friends is morbidly overweight.  I found the film, hilarious on several occasions and so did she.  I will admit, that she also found it flat for the most part.  I won't say it was completely flat, but the film could have been funnier - though when it was funny, I thought I would pass out.
Is it offensive to overweight people?  Let's look at this in the light it is presented... Jack Black and Jason Alexander's characters are the narrators (so to speak) of the story.  Neither one of these guys is in shape and that is key to the story.  They are losers who are both trying to prove to the other that they are studs with the ladies, when in truth neither of them can get a date.
In a casting coup, Tony Robbins, the self help guru, sort of brainwashes Jack into only seeing women for who they are inside instead of on the outside.  This is something that we should all do, but very very few of actually do.  From there forward, Jack only sees women for the beauty within them.  The fact that most of the beautiful women he sees are in fact physically unattractive in one way or another, is a point that is actually rather delicately handled.  It is a telling point of the filmmakers that one woman that he sees as an old crone, is in reality a gorgeous woman.  So what's the point of this?  I think the filmmakers actually wanted to show that just because a person is beautiful on the outside, they can be ugly on the inside.  Conversely, an unattractive person on the outside can be equally or moreso unattractive on the inside (this is a point that could have been brought out but was not).
Does the film pander to the idea that fat people are jolly, etc.?  Yeah.  Does it presume that unattractive people are more beautiful on the inside?  Yeah.
Is the film politically correct?  Who cares!  We have all become so overly sensitive that we're a nation of big cry babies.  I hope that I am evolved enough that if I countenance something that I don't like I can ignore it and move on.  Who's the fool if I let something get under my skin?  It's me.  My folks taught me to ""consider the source"" when I was offended by something or someone.
So, if you think you will be offended by this film - then don't watch it.  No one is holding a gun to your head.
But if you do watch it and get offended - then get a thicker skin - I can promise you there are going to be many more offensive things in life than this film.  In short - grow up and get over it!

1434600,3,B00005JKLQ,"When Hal (Jack Black) was a boy, his father taught him to aim high, to not settle for anyone less than ""perfect."" When he grew up, he stuck to his father's words, but for some reason he never could find a perfect girl, or rather, they were too shallow to go out with him. Luckily, he runs across Self-Help guru Tony Robbins, who grants Hal the special power of seeing women by their inner beauty. Suddenly, the ugly girls are beautiful, and the beautiful girls go both ways. But when Hal finds the girl of his dreams (Gwyneth Paltrow), he can't see how extremely overweight she is. This leads to a lot of strange misunderstandings, but over time the two fall in love. Hal's best friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander), who's even more shallow than Hal, isn't going to let his friend ruin himself like this though, and does all he can to thwart the relationship. When he finally succeeds in curing Hal of his vision problems, Hal will have to learn to see inner beauty with his own eyes.
Shallow Hal is a funny movie, no doubt, but at the same time it probably delivers just as many sad scenes that depict how cruel people can be to a stranger for really no good reason other than their different appearance. But I'm not complaining about that. That's part of the lesson this film is trying to teach. The problem I have with this movie is the same problem I had with Shrek really. I like them both, I will probably eventually purchase them both, but they're both only effective in entertaining their audience. They both fail in teaching their message because they both contradict themselves. But let's only deal with Shallow Hal here. The idea is that we shouldn't judge people by their appearances, right? Well, what was it that everyone was doing to Hal in this movie? I mean, really? They were knocking Hal down for aiming too high, saying things like, ""You've been shooting for girls who are out of your league,"" and ""You're not that good looking,"" etc... Was Hal shallow? Sure, but not much more than everyone else in the film, or in the world for that matter. But for some reason Hal has no right to be shallow because he's not good looking. It's really more confusing than anything. I know that, like Shrek, this movie was trying to say that we should get to know people instead of judging them by their appearances, and it did make a minor attempt at punishing the cruel, good looking people in the picture. But in the end, the film pokes more fun at unattractive people than Hal ever could, while teaching no stronger lesson than that same one taught in Shrek, ""Stick with your own kind."" You're ugly, so date ugly. You're fat, so date fat. It's the only way you'll ever find anyone and truly be happy. In truth, Hal wasn't any more shallow than anyone else. His friend Mauricio, now HE was shallow.",1026950400,9,2802,4.517716535433071

Jack Black is the main character here and given the title of this review, you can gather I was not all that happy with his overall performance. Although his character is supposed to be an undesirable individual, so is most of his acting. Towards the end he is doing a better job because he is not trying to be funny, but taking his situation seriously. I liked the over all movie and Paltrow does a great job as both the thin woman Hal saw her as and the over weight woman she is in reality.

A guy that only goes for looks, and if there is one flaw, he dumps them...or actually...he gets dumped, but anyway, just when his life is starting to go downhill, he is able to see the beauty inside people, not the beauty on the outside.

1434614,4,B00005JKLQ,"""Shallow Hal"" is a touching film with a noble message; that beauty lies within.  The approach is novel if not a bit contrived, but it works in this genre.  The normally coarse Farrelly humor has been toned down considerably and the film is full of quiet chuckles with only a few guffaws sprinkled in.  Noticeably absent (thank heavens) is the profanity and body fluid humor.
The Farrelly brothers (Directors/Producers Bobby and Peter) have made names for themselves by producing juvenile gross out flicks (Dumb and Dumber, Me, Myself and Irene, Say It Isn't So) targeted at teenage audiences.  Most of these were as successful as they were low brow.  Of course they also had a smash hit with ""There's Something About Mary"" which offered both their irreverent humor and a captivating story.  Also lurking on their resume is the little known, ""Outside Providence"" which is a sensitive romance that one would never associate with this tandem.  Given this background, ""Shallow Hal"" is something of an evolutionary film for the Farrellys.  They took a chance making a ""grownup"" film, though they paid for it at the box office.  For this I must give them a great deal of credit.
This is a much more subtle and refined Farrelly vehicle that synthesizes many of the best elements of prior films, making it their best effort to date.  Hal's transformation from an immature and superficial jerk, to a caring and substantial person might be analogous to this film as a turning point on the Farrelly's resume.  One can only hope that this experiment is the beginning of a maturing process for two very talented directors, rather than validating to them that you can't make as much money making good films as you can trash.
The acting is excellent.  Jack Black is a pleasant surprise as the main character.  He has the range to play both sides of the character effectively, alternately giving us great superficiality and great depth.  He is also extremely funny with a great variety of facial expressions and physical comedy that make him that much more endearing.  Gwyneth Paltrow just seems to get more beautiful with each film.  Her acting here is once again top rate, giving us a touching performance with equal parts of insecurity and sensitivity that one would expect from the character.  Her chemistry with Black is also terrific.  Jason Alexander adds his odd humor to the mix and gives the film some of its funnier moments.
I have been critical of the Peter and Bobby Farrelly in the past, but to this film I say, ""Bravo"".  I rated it a 8/10.  With any luck this will represents a direction and not a temporary detour from the puerile comedy that made them famous.",1026518400,,2660,4.791666666666667

Jack Black does a great job as Hal and Gwyneth Paltrow does an awesome job as 300 pound Rosemary. This movie is filled with genuine laughs.
Shallow Hal starts off when Hal is a little kid and his mom and him are in the hospital because Hal's father is dying. Hal is the only one that witnesses his fathers death. Then the movie goes to the older Hal dancing at a club, trying to get women bt he's just to shallow. A little bit later he gets stuck in an elevator with this therapist guy who puts a spell on Hal that makes him less shallow by letting him only see the inner beauty of someone. right when he leaves he gets in a cab with this pretty woman who actually talks to him. He asks her if shes here for a model show and she starts laughing and is like ""Yeah Right"". He gets her number and hes happy.
The next day he sees this beautiful woman who is pretty skinny walking into a store and he follows her. He finds her looking at oversized clothes and he cracks the joke ""Are you going to make a parachute with them"" and she gets angry and upset and she walks away.

1434616,3,B00005JKLQ,"There are obviously two sides to this movie and depending on which side you look at will go a long ways in determining whether you will like it. You can either see this movie as a movie that makes fun of overweight people, or you can look at it as a movie that argues and makes a point that people should change their opinions and look inside of a person rather than judging by a person's weight or appearance. I felt like I was very divided in what this movie was trying to accomplish.  I felt like the movie was trying to tell people that physical appearance does not matter and that love can overcome many obstacles if you look deep into a person's heart. The problem that this movie encompasses is that it doesn't overcome the many ""fat"" jokes that are used (for instance, someone sitting down and breaking a chair,the earth shaking, the bench tilting to one side, etc). I saw this movie in the show and felt as though people were not getting the message that Hal's character was changing and he was becoming aware of his biases. Instead, people just laughed at all the fat jokes. There are far too many ""pokes"" at people with weight problems and this is too bad, because there are (believe it or not) some touching moments in Hal's transformation, such as the moments in the hospital with the child who has severe burns. It is like the producers are trying to give a message but, at the same time, they contradict themselves by going about it the wrong way.  Overall, I felt this would have been a much better movie if the producers would have toned down on the jokes, and made this more of a movie about what the heart sees.",1026432000,3,1630,4.394039735099338
1434617,5,B00005JKLQ,"I am impressed.  I didn't expect to be, and after the first few minutes of the film thought I wouldn't be, but I was.
One of my chief complaints about Disney's Beauty and the Beast, which has a similar premise, was that, even though Beauty obviously didn't care about the Beast's appearance once he was less irritable and defensive, the makers of the film felt obligated to ""reward"" Beauty--or maybe Beast--by turning him into a handsome prince.  I felt that the makers of the film had missed the point miserably and failed the viewers--many of whom were little people learning important lessons--terribly.  To Beauty the Beast WAS a handsome prince.  How he appeared to the rest of  us was irrelevant.  He didn't need to become somebody else for her to appreciate him, and our opinions shouldn't have matter.  Good news:  Shallow Hal's makers got the point.
That point is, as the old paradigm goes, ""Beauty is in the eye of the Beholder,"" and the world would be a much better place if we could all see the inner beauty of those around us.  Self help and self esteem guru Anthony Robbins makes a personal appearance in the film, and his totally rational and relaxed style of dealing with the neurotic Hal made me want to sign right up for one of his courses (in fact, I put one of his books on my wish list)!  By changing Hal's perspective on other people, Robbins caused him to approach them in positive, validating ways that brought a sense of appreciation into their lives and a sense of happiness and fulfilment into his own.  So thoroughly is he changed by the experience, that even  when the post hypnotic suggestion is reversed, he finds it difficult to return to the shallow person he was.
I was waiting for it, but far from forgetting the paradigm, the film makers didn't simply morph Rosemary into a beautiful woman at the end to ""reward"" the hero for his new found depth.  It was okay for her to be beautiful because he loved her.  I think the most significant lines in the film are uttered by Robbins in response to Hal's friend Mauricio when he accuses the psychologist of ""brainwashing"" Hal.  Robbins responds, you don't think you're brainwashed too?  And he points out the subtle ways in which the media, the corporate world and peer pressure brainwash all of us into valuing only the superficial, often making ourselves miserable in the bargain.  Thank you Shallow Hal.
I thought this was a wonderful film.",1026432000,2,2422,4.661176470588235

1434619,4,B00005JKLQ,"This film by the  Farrelly brothers is one of their better ones. Though they have not shaken off their lowbrow sense of humor, they have managed to better incorporate it into their film, so as not to lose all credibility. As a result, they have put together a pretty decent and unusual romantic comedy.
The plot revolves around our not so good looking leading man, Hal Larson (Jack Black), who, due to a traumatic scene with his dying father when only nine years old, is fixated on dating only women who have super model looks. Pumped up by his equally not so good looking, best friend, Mauricio Wilson (Jason Alexander), Hal is hellbent on dating only good looking women no matter how stupid, mean, or self absorbed they may be. It is no wonder that he has yet to find the woman of his dreams.
A run in with motivational speaker, Tony Robbins, changes Hal's life, when Tony places a subliminal message into Hal's subconscious, causing him to see only the person's inner beauty. When his path crosses that of the morbidly obese, but warm and kindly Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow), it is love at first sight for him. He does not see a fat girl but a beautiful and luminous Gwyneth Paltrow.
Hal continues to see only the inner beauty of all those whom he meets, until he is brought back to a jarring reality by his erstwhile best friend. What happens when faced with the reality of having a morbidly obese girlfriend is a trial and tribulation that only Hal can resolve. Will true love win out? Watch the movie and find out.
Gwyneth Paltrow is sensational as Rosemary. Her delivery is affecting, as she comes across as sensitive, sweet, and hesitant, as well as somewhat lacking in confidence. She is absolutely incandescent in the role. She effectively plays the part of Rosemary, as if she were a young woman unused to the attentions of a suitor. She is also quite funny at times, as Hal's comedic foil.
Jason Black, as Hal, is also funny, though somewhat wooden. He is obviously a comedian, rather than an actor. Still, he manages to play his part effectively, overall. Jason Alexander plays his role a bit too over the top, almost manic, and ends up being more obnoxious, rather than funny. In the end, however, when his own personal secret comes out, it really is a hilarious moment in true Farrelly brothers fashion. The rest of the supporting cast is very good and effectively contribute to the comedic efforts of the film.
While this film emphasizes that inner beauty is what is important, it does so, however, while still making fun of fat people at their expense. When Gwyneth Paltrow asks for a slice of cake and proceeds to hack off a third of the cake for herself, the film is continuing to propogate stereotypic notions of fat people. A number of sight gags further serve to underscore this premise. This is, however, a Farrelly brothers comedy, after all, and to be expected.
The DVD has a number of interesting features, including one entitled ""Seeing through the Layers"", which shows the efforts made to turn Gwyneth into a believably obese woman. The DVD also includes a film commentary by the Farrelly brothers, as well as eleven deleted scenes, in addition to some other features. All in all, this DVD offers excellent picture and sound quality and is value laden.",1026345600,10,3287,4.686851211072664
1434620,4,B00005JKLQ,"What a great movie! Probably one of the best comedies that came out this past year about a shallow guy who only wants to date beautiful models with no IQ. He gets stuck in an elevator with self guru Tony Robbins, who hypnotizes him to make him see beauty from the inside instead of the outside, He then falls for Rose Marie, a very large woman who in his eyes is the most stunning woman he has ever seen. Jack Black is wonderful in the role of Hal. I thought it was very clever casting him, considering he is not so thin and attractive himself. Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderfully charming in her first comedic leading role. The movie has a wonderful message which is obvious, and even though the ending is very predicatable you can't help for in love with both of these characters and root for them to get together. If I had to pick one low point of the movie, it would be the Jason Alexander as Hals best friend. He is so obnoxious and annoying I wanted to fast forward his scenes. But if you can past that, then you will love this movie. Very very funny. A Must See!",1026345600,,1064,4.246305418719212
1434640,4,B00005JKLQ,"Okay, I sheepishly confess that I watched this DVD expecting to see some patented Farrelly brothers humor: crude, insensitive, and in-your-face.  WOW, was I surprised.
This movie is definitely humorous (we laughed out loud at times) but when it's over, you come away with a heightened sense of sensitivity for those people society categorizes as ""ugly"", ""fat"" or ""undesirable.""  And if you're not careful, you may just approach life a bit differently once you've watched this excellent movie.
Hal (portrayed wonderfully by Jack Black), and his best friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander) are a couple of obnoxious, shallow guys who make no apologies for their fixation on dating ONLY young, beautiful women.  This is tough for both of them, as neither one is particularly good-looking.  But, they drive on doggedly in their pursuit of women who are consistently ""out of their league.""
Everything changes when Hal is stuck in an elevator with a self-motivational guru, who gives Hal a ""gift"".  In fact, Hal is hypnotized; now, he sees a person's inner beauty, not their outward physical appearance.  Unattractive or obese women look like supermodels to Hal; and when he approaches them, genuinely attracted to their true beauty, they respond.  After years of being unable to connect with beautiful women, suddenly Hal has an unprecedented run of success...only, the women are really not physically attractive, and this is evident to Mauricio, and everyone else...except Hal.  In short order, Hal hooks up with Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), who is smart, funny, caring, and to Hal, stunningly beautiful.  One problem: to the rest of the world, Rosemary is a 350-pound behemoth who breaks restaurant furniture simply by sitting on it.
Rosemary and Hal fall madly in love, and it turns out that Rosemary's father is the CEO of Hal's investment company.  Taken by Hal's sincerity, and his insightful ideas for improvements to the firm, Rosemary's father promotes Hal to his right-hand man.  Everything is going wonderfully for Hal and Rosemary...that is, until Mauricio decides to ""rescue"" Hal by breaking the hypnosis.  What will happen now that Hal can see the REAL Rosemary?
This is a great movie, and can even be watched and appreciated by preteen children.  The sexual situations are mild, and there is little or no foul language or nudity.  Gwyneth Paltrow, and especially Jack Black, give excellent acting performances.  Make it a point to watch and enjoy this DVD.  It just might change your life, and make you wish we could ALL see only the ""inner beauty"" of others.  Our world today is much too preoccupied with physical appearance, and other shallow concepts that don't truly matter in the grand scheme of things.",1026172800,19,2712,5.113378684807256

1434642,2,B00005JKLQ,"Shallow Hal attempts to be both funny and have a significant message.  While the movie is funny and entertaining, I question just how pure its message is.  Much of the humor seems to be at the expense of the various dates Hal has.  Rosemary constantly breaks furniture, weighs down cars and canoes to an extreme, and sends a kid flying out of a swimming pool--her weight is exaggerated to extreme proportions, and tends to reinforce some of the stereotypes overweight people face.  Throughout much of the movie, she is only desirable because Hal sees her as skinny.  Others are portrayed as physically ugly to an extreme, and one transgendered restaurant worker is made fun of because she is so unpassable as a woman.  The movie tries to justify itself by making Hal realize his faults and fall for Rosemary despite her weight, but I find the whole thing ungenuine and the characters cartoonish.  Plus, as a returned Peace Corps volunteer, it was so obvious to me that whoever wrote this movie didn't do any research on how the Peace Corps really operates.  I wanted to like Shallow Hal, but I guess I'm just not shallow enough.",1026086400,7,1128,4.719387755102041
1434643,1,B00005JKLQ,"This movie is terrible. I mean really, really bad. I guess it's supposed to be a comedy, but there are absolutely no laughs to be found. The movie is one very long fat joke that doesn't work and is stretched to an hour and a half. I think the Farelly Brothers were attempting to make a ""message movie"" but I think it is actually sort of offensive to overweight people.
Jack Black is a funny guy, but he hasn't made a good movie since ""High Fidelity."" He's not funny at all in this, it's a total waste of his talent... Jason Alexander? Not funny at all. The Farelly Brothers are continuing to prove what hacks they are as filmmakers. After making three great comedies in a row - ""Dumb and Dumber,"" ""Kingpin,"" and ""There's Something About Mary,"" they've now delivered their second straight dud (fourth if you count Osmosis Jones and the Farelly-produced ""Say It Isn't So""). Even in those three classic comedies I questioned their movie-making skills but at least they provided laughs.
Do yourself a favor and don't watch this godawful mess. I wish I could say, ""Well, it's really stupid but it has funny parts"" but there are no funny parts.",1026000000,11,1138,4.583333333333333
1434644,3,B00005JKLQ,"Jack Black (the very noisy clerk in ""High Fidelity"") is Hal of the title, who falls in love with Gwyneth Paltrow's character Rosemary.  But as he can see only 'internal' beauty of the people he meets, he doesn't know that the actual Rosemary is not what he thinks she is.  In fact, Rosemary -- witty, kind-hearted, and sensitive -- is a very fat girl.
The Farrelly Brothers stretched this premise to the extreme because, as we know, they are kind of guys who made ""There's Something About Mary"" which is brimmed with politically incorrrect gags.  But in this film the brothers show another side of them: romance.
OK, so, there's fewer occasions for the directors to show their trademark gross-out humors.  Their outrageous gags are there, but the film gives more stress on the love-story of Hal and Rosemary.  Some people say the brothers went soft.  Perhaps.
Jack Black, despite our anticipation, is very good as Hal, who at first appears as an annoying guy who sees only external beauty of females.  He tries to have a date with every girl he meets at disco, but always fails.  Except that habit, Hal is a pretty nice fellow you might relate to ... so the film goes on to explain ... if you could swallow this initial premise.
Though Hal's character seems off-putting initially, he shows another side when he meets lovely Rosemary.  Of course, he doesn't know her truth -- he is given a certain 'power' from Anthony J. Robbins in an elevator -- and Rosemary thinks he is only joking.  But as she gradually sees he really means it, a  romance starts to bloom until an inevitable development of story comes.
Jack Black shows unexpected tender side of his character well, which could have been just a shallow caricature of playboy.  We somehow come to like him (if not the film itself), and it is certain that JB scored another point after Stephen Frears film.  On the other hand, Gwyneth Paltrow, beautiful as she is, is put in an awkward situation, I am afraid.  She (Gwyneth, I mean) is a cute girl, to be sure, but she appears fairly briefly as true Rosemary wearing a fat suit and special make-up.  Now, a fundamental question pops up here -- if moviemakers say they do not make fun of fat girls, why don't they try to find a really cute fat girl somewhere, and cast her as the lead, instead of having Gwyneth in a suit?
Some of the gags are indeed funny, but they do not play a major role in this film.  It's a romance; or, I should say, it tries to be one, and in my book it ends up with a so-so result.  However, whether it is a right way to make a romantic film with Oscar-winning Paltrow in this fashion remains a mystery.  And whether you can enjoy ""Shallo Hal"" from your heart, or you are offended by the use of issues like obesity, depends on that score.",1026000000,3,2766,4.4760956175298805
1434645,4,B00005JKLQ,"""Shallow Hal"", the latest movie from the Farrelly brothers, is something of a departure for them. It's a kinder, gentler work from the team that made the idiotic ""Dumb and Dumber"", the wacky, raucous ""There's Something About Mary"" and the rather vindictive ""Me, Myself and Irene"". Again, they take on a sensitive subject. This time it's obesity. Instead of loading the picture with fatso jokes, which is undoubtedly what many of their fans were hoping for, they chose instead to focus on tolerance and on the idea that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The results are mixed. It could have been a lot funnier, but that might have also made it mean-spirited. It's charm and warmth make up somewhat for its general lack of laugh out loud humor.
As the movie opens, young Hal is traumatized by his father's deathbed admonition to pursue only beautiful women. Soon we see the grown up Hal [Jack Black], who has taken the advice seriously. He is indeed shallow, chasing only the most desirable women [read bimbos]. Never mind that Jack himself is no looker. One day he gets trapped in an elevator with real life inspirational speaker Tony Roberts, who convinces him to start looking for the inner beauty in women. When he meets Rosemary [Gwyneth Paltrow], he is instantly smitten. What he sees is, well, Gwyneth Paltrow, What the audience and his friends see is the real Rosemary, who weighs in at about 300 pounds. At first she is offended by his insistence that she is beautiful. After she accepts that he is telling the truth, one of the oddest love affairs in the history of movies begins.
Jack Black, in his first real starring role, makes Hal an interesting character. Paltrow is excellent as the Rosemary Hal imagines he sees and, in a few scenes, as the much more substantial real Rosemary. Jason Alexander is hysterical as Hal's idiot best friend, Mauricio.
It can be argued that the Farrellys only further the stereotype of what defines beauty by casting Paltrow as Hal's ideal woman. The fact is that the last half of the movie would not work if he did not have an `ideal' Rosemary in his head when he finally sees the woman she really is.
I think ""Shallow Hal"" is the Farrellys' best movie after ""There's Something About Mary"". And it's certainly a winner in an era of lame, uninspired gross-out comedies.",1025913600,2,2316,4.706896551724138

Hal looked at the sick children in the hospital and all he could see was a group of beautiful children.. but when he saw the pretty nurse Tonya.. he saw her ugliness inside. Even Rosie's  skinny boyfriend looked pretty to Hal... who in real life was not pretty at all. He looked good to Hal because he was a nice person.
  I guess some people just neeed to sit back and look at the movie and listen to the message it's trying to present.",1025913600,,689,4.276923076923077

This does have some in it...It runs through the story line, but it has ALOT less then I thought there would be from what I had heard about this movie. I mean there weren't all to many fat jokes really or ugly jokes. And plus this movie carries a *GREAT* moral ""Beauty is ONLY skin deep."" And its a wonderfull romantic comedy that breaks the mold.
 The real problem I have with movies like this is mainly ""sex""...Sex outside marraige...Well because I'm strict on that, and I believe that well sex is for marraige.... But anyways, I mean part of the reason the jokes didn't bug me is because they don't come without reason. And it just goes to show what great people you can find not so hot people or beautifull people.  It also has a great story to carry it along&Great acting as well...
 Now I wouldn't recomend this movie because some people will most likely find it offensive, like as I said I got the wrong impression of it because of people who did find it offensive. I can relate to this film in the way that I've been lonely and made fun of for alot of my life. And it just goes to show you can find some great people out there if you just look past the the appearence because as this movie shows after you've met them well looks really don't matter anymore.
 Its not even that crude, I've seen movies so much worse than this. It has alot of good things going for it that overshadow the bad...If only you'de try to find them(Just like with people).
 So give it a try, and look beyond the surface&you just may find something worth while!!!

Gwyneth Paltrow's character Rosemary goes to show how underneath all that excess flesh that there is still a person. I think ""Shallow Hal"" is a movie that helps demolish discrimination against heavyset people. This movie didn't only give examples of heavyset people but of people who were skinny and just not physically attractive to that of one's expectations. Hal is a very shallow character and he is an example of all those people who discriminate against heavyset men and women and people who are not attractive. Like Hal in the movie, people can change and widen their horizons for something more beautiful. ""Shallow Hal"" is less of a comedy and more of a motivational, moving story about life. I think this is a family friendly movie, something that kids would like as long as the situation is explained to them.

1434660,4,B00005JKLQ,"Shallow Hal, about Hal (Jack Black) who is only chooses to date women by their looks. Till one day he's stuck in an elivator with a self help person that thinks he's a good guy but that his shallowness is his only flaw. So he helps by putting him in this trance where he can only see the inner beauty in undesirable people. Hal doesn't know this though and finds himself surrounded by beautiful women, at least he thinks he is. Then he meets Rose (Gwyneth Paltrow) who is orca fat but he of course just sees her as well.....Gwyneth Paltrow. They start dating and Rose's dad just happens to be one of Hal's bosses, so he immediately thinks Hal is just seeing her to get close to him to get a raise. His friend played by Jason Alexanda who sees a flaw in every women of course doesn't like Hal seeing Rose one bit either.
 Through a lot in Shallow Hal you have to imagine that the attractive women he is talking to, well aren't attractive. That's only way the jokes can work. For instance when he first meets Rose he sees her with a giant pair of undies and tells her that she could use that as sail for a sailboat. Plus when he's at a fast food place with her she gets made fun of with these guys saying she ate all the food and Hal immediatly thinks they're talking about him. Well anyway what makes this film sweet is that it's about looking for inner beauty. Which you never get movies about. You just get Freddie Prinze Jr. movies about hunky guy meets gorgeous girl. Shallow Hal is a nice change and the type of romance that you never get. Face it in most movies the fat girl doesn't get the guy and vice versa.
 The Farrellys who are known for their rauncy scenes, surprisingly keep it pretty light. For instance there's no sperm hair gel ""There's Something About Mary"", no milking a bull ""Kin Pin"", well you get the pont. It's some-what freaky I guess but not rauncy. For instance you got a guy with a spine problem who can only walk on all fours like a dog and Jason Alexanda has a tail, yes a tail.",1025568000,,2006,4.2486910994764395

I thought that Shallow Hal had a few shallow scenes, but overall was pretty funny. Although some people may argue that the movie was about making fun of obese people, I beg to differ(I love saying that!). I think the movie was about Shallow Hal realizing it's what's inside that counts, not what's outside. I thought the movie was really sweet.
I've seen a lot of movies where a boy ends up falling for a dorky girl and it's supposed to have the message ""it's what's inside that counts""(""She's All That"" is a perfect example). The only problem is a beautiful girl plays the dork (think Mandy Moore in ""A Walk to Remember"").

1434667,4,B00005JKLQ,"Not only does ""Shallow Hal"" make fun of fat women, it makes fun of fat men, fat Hawaiian men, men with scalp psoriasis, men with bald spots, dog men, men with huge banana fingers, Spina Bifida sufferers, people with Irish accents, and, of course, child burn victims.  Well, not really.  Like any Farrelly Bros. movie, it doesn't make fun of any of these sub-groups, but celebrates them.
Witness how they treat actor Rene Kirby, who plays Walt, a playboy who recently sold his Internet company and is now on the prowl for hot dates.  Oh, and Walt (and in real life Kirby) has Spina Bifida.  The sight of him, ambling into frame on all fours, could have been played for huge belly laughs.  In the Farrelly's hands, the laughs are there, but they also take great pains in creating a fully functioning character for Kirby to sink his teeth into.  It reminds me of a similar case in their last movie, ""Me, Myself, and Irene"", where albino actor Michael Bowman played... well... an albino.  But an albino with a back-story, and relevance to the plot.  He was a full-fledged character too.
The bottom line is this: if you can't laugh at human grotesquery, then you're out of place watching a Farrelly Bros. movie.  They adore the little (and usually big) differences that make the human menagerie so fascinating, so vile, and so transcendent.  It's an ethos that always makes me think of something Dennis Miller once said: ""You're part of the human collective; you too can be poked fun at.  Come, join in our reindeer games.""  I'm willing to play.  So are the Farrellys.  The question is: are you?
But I don't want to get all caught up in the politics of the film.  It brings up issues that matter, but beyond that you'll want to watch ""Shallow Hal"" because it is a funny movie.  And really, that's all that should really count.
So, what is there to like about it.  Let's start with Gwyneth.  I haven't really liked much Ms. Paltrow has done since her small but very effective role in ""Seven"".  But here she's marvelous on many levels.  First of all, she's quite luminous, more so than usual.  Bathed in soft light, she looks just as Hal would want her to look: absolutely gorgeous.  And while you're distracted by this, drooling at her beauty, she manages to sneak in a rather complex and effective performance.  Her Rosemary is a bundle of insecurities that Gwyneth essays superbly.  She walks with a hunched over gait and shows obvious discomfort in social situations, because that is what Rosemary would feel.  Her posture and her demeanor allow Rosemary's true weight to show, even when she's the object of Hal's affection.  Witness her reaction upon encountering a couple of jerks outside a restaurant.  They remark, ""I wonder if there's any food left"", and Gwyneth as Rosemary, who was just beginning to feel confidence, crumbles.  It's heartbreaking.

Jack Black more than makes a fine foil for Gwyneth, and vice versa.  He is energetic and endearing in the role of a man sentenced (blessed?) to a world where he can only see inner beauty.  And most importantly, he plays the character with the utmost in sincerity.  Hal could have been a naive jerk, but Black makes the audience think that Hal believes the syrupy come-ons and cheesy pick-up lines that he delivers.  And most importantly, that his compliments towards Rosemary, while misguided, are true and heartfelt.  On top of all this, he delivers some fine physical comedy moments, most notably in the dance club scene that opens the film.  A fine, funny film could have been made of just Jack dancing for 90 minutes.
Jason Alexander is terribly uncomfortable to watch, but is comfortable in his own skin.  He plays Hal's slimy friend and partner in the pursuit of impossibly beautiful women.  Alexander does what he does best: act with manic and frustrated energy.  And on top of that, I dare you to try and take your eyes off his ridiculous hair.  Tony Robbins, playing himself, is actually quite appealing in his small cameo.  He manages to show a good sense of humour about himself, especially when Black and Alexander make fun of his enormous features.
When speaking of their mammoth hit ""There's Something About Mary"", Peter Farrelly has said that his favourite moment was when Ben Stiller decides he still wants to see Mary, after having just been lied to by Matt Dillon that the gorgeous Mary he remembers from so long ago is now a fat welfare mother.  He wants to meet her because maybe he can help her, and maybe he can still love her.  Peter goes on to say that anybody could love Cameron Diaz, but the notion that Ben could still love her even though she no longer looks like Cameron Diaz, well, that's something the audience can root for her.  ""Shallow Hal"" is an entire movie that builds up to a similar scene.  You won't know how Hal is going to react when he gets to that point, confronted by a woman who looks nothing like Gwyneth, but I can tell you -- and c'mon, this isn't giving anything away -- that if you were rooting for Ben Stiller, then you'll root for Jack Black too.",1024358400,5,5052,4.647125140924464
