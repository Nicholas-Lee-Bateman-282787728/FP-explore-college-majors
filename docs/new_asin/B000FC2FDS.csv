8120532,3,B000FC2FDS,"A well presented package however, not a contemporary series, largely a collection of old training and propaganda films from various eras. Mostly public domain footage with a number of examples of the same footage being used repeatedly in unrelated places. Worth the low, second hand price though, especially for such a lot of material.",1423958400,,335,5.222222222222222
8120533,2,B000FC2FDS,"This is an interesting compilation.  A bit disjointed in timeline, but interesting slant on history if you watch the propaganda films.  One film went so far as to suggest the Army Air Corp won the battle of Midway, rather than the Navy.  Unfortunately most of the unique and never before seen material is of such poor quality, it detracts from it's content.",1353283200,,357,4.725806451612903
8120534,3,B000FC2FDS,"This DVD set is interesting because of the rare footage that has been compiled from official sources from the U.S Air Force, Army, and Navy, but there in lies the critical flaw. The episode Vietnam and The Limits of Air Power (a title probably assigned by the author)is actually an official U.S Air Force documentary from the Vietnam War that says nothing of the kind about airpower's limitations. Quite the contrary, it actually brags about how effective U.S airpower was during Operation Rolling Thunder, something any modern historian or even a pilot at the time would laugh at. The set does not include, however, a documentary about the Linebacker operations that really hit the North Vietnamese where it hurt. The set also as you would expect reading the first sentence of this paragraph, only covers U.S air wars and operations. This makes the title very misleading. The author's long monologues before each episode are another detractor.",1307145600,,944,5.0576923076923075
