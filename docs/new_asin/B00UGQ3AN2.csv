8706519,5,B00UGQ3AN2,"Exposed Bill Parcells as one of many great Giants coaches, Phil Simms as a crafty quarterback and great linebackers Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson and gutsy mighty Mark Bavaro. A must see for Giants fans and football fans as to how the game should be played today.",1394323200,,266,4.680851063829787
8706520,5,B00UGQ3AN2,"NFL Network's production of ""America's Game"" has a documentary covering the season of each Super Bowl winner.  They add a new perspective never before seen in previously released documentaries, from 2 - 3 players and sometimes the head coach.  This one is no different, offering some very interesting insight into the Giants' first Super Bowl run.  No beeps over cuss words, just pure 100% insight from the men who lived it, in their own words.  Definitely worth the purchase, especially if you are a Giants fan!",1251849600,3,512,4.9186046511627906
8706521,1,B00UGQ3AN2,"I was expecting the entire game and got nothing of the sort.  They showed about a minutes worth of highlights and that was it.  I only wanted this game because a friend of mine snuck on the Giants sideline without even having a ticket to enter the stadium, and I wanted to view him because he is in many shots and even held down the umpires arm and called the first down himself (this is how he got caught).  He was also the only civilian to make it onto the field when the Mets beat Boston that same year in the World Series. After Jesse Orosco strikes out the last batter and throws up his glove, you see my friend Kevin run on the field, you cant miss him.  He is wearing a blue shirt, and runs out right behind home plate.  He also snuck into that game into 2nd row seats and was sitting 2 seats away from the president. I don't understand why a full game cannot be purchased, it doesn't make any sense!",1249516800,4,907,4.130681818181818
