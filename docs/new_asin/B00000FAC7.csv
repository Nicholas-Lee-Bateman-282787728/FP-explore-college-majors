7907574,5,B00000FAC7,"I bought this tape about 6 years ago. It is an excellent workout. I've tried many other types of exercise, taebo, yoga, walking workouts and many of Gilad's and this is still my favorite. It's an excellent workout.  A little over an hour and very challenging. It really targets every area of your body. I'm hoping to find a copy on DVD since I don't use my VCR much anymore.",1171929600,,374,4.3428571428571425
