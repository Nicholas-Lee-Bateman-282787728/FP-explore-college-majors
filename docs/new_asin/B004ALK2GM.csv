8420420,3,B004ALK2GM,"""The Great Resistance Tubing DVD"" is an instructional video on tubing.  It's like taking a class.  Andre Noel Polvin discusses concepts, including safety.

There are three workouts.
Beginning workout (37 and a half minutes)
Intermediate workout (39 minutes)
Advanced workout (40 minutes)

I did the beginning workout.  It's actually not a workout.  It's a series of pre-taped video exercise segments.  An exercise segment is shown, followed by a 30 second break, followed by another exercise segment, and then another 30 second break and so on.  Each exercise is carefully explained and the exercise is done in a slow, controlled pace.  In general, the workout moves slowly and is a bit disjointed with the segments.  During the 30 second breaks between each exercise, I started to lose interest and focus.

There are also individual sections as listed below.
