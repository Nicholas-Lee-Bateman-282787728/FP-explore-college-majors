8594134,5,B005GLGZ7A,"This DVD is called The Sensual Art of Bellydance and it's well named.  It is a great collection of belly dance performance - a good mix of different styles, fun to watch, and very entertaining.  There are solid performances here by some by well-known dancers and by some that I (at least) have not heard of.  High points for me:

Ava Fleming - The main attraction for me.  On this DVD she demonstrates the talent that makes her such a fantastic dancer - so many good moves over such a wide range of fast and slow, big and small.  She effortlessly glides between very fast and very slow and combines big expressive movement with small, delicate moves.  Her slow, bendy moves are mesmerizing.  Ava Fleming couldn't give a bad performance if she tried.

The aptly named Willow, lithesome and bendy.  Another dancer who combines big dramatic moves with delicate, small, slow ones.  And those gorgeous, slow hip movements - a man would have to be made of stone not to be affected by them.

Nathalie's first rate performance - another major high point.  For sheer voluptuous grace, it can't be beat.  A lovely combination of moves with smooth transitions.  The dance is maybe not as refined as some of the others, but it is thoroughly pleasing, satisfying belly dance the way belly dance ought to be - immediately enjoyable and strongly appealing from the first second till the last.  Natalie has a beautiful smile and welcoming manner that draws you in and then keeps you there with those sumptuous, undulating hips.

Jamileh - another favorite.  Apart from being downright beautiful she combines fine technique with an outgoing manner and a fetching smile.  Her slow hip movements can be riveting.  My only complaint about her dance on this DVD was that it was a bit short and left me wanting more.

Aziza - another favorite and another one of those who combine a warm, voluptuous feeling with excellent technique.  She gives a very satisfying performance - I especially appreciate the little belly flutters so well incorporated in the dance.  Aziza's dances exude a warm, comfortable feeling.  Her costumes are beautiful also, and she is not averse to showing some leg, which is much appreciated.

Zaheea and Sandra also turn out first-rate performances.  These are just the high points, but the DVD provides other commendable performances.

All in all, this is an excellent collection for someone who knows what he likes or is just learning to appreciate the art.  Belly dancing at its best is medicine for the soul - cheerful, calming, and relaxing.  Performance collections like this will do what no pill could ever do to ease your tensions and put a little sunshine in your heart.  Five minutes of an Ava Fleming or Zaheea dance and a whole week of frustrating meetings and phone calls and emails will just drain away into nothing.  Best of all, pour yourself a cold beer or a whiskey and water, spend just a few moments in that beautiful world of shimmies and belly rolls, and your own world will be a brighter place.  An hour spent watching belly dance is an hour well spent.",1341360000,,3078,4.749056603773585
