1995832,3,B0001FT758,"It's hard to diss a movie made for Animal Planet about a loving dog and its adorable puppies.  Suffice to say, THE RETRIEVERS is a movie that even kids might find hard to sit through.  Although the dogs are beautiful and the pups cute, they don't DO anything.  The movie instead focuses on the humans and they aren't the most engaging of people either. Robert Hays (Airplane, Angie) plays an ad exec who tiring of the rat's race in NYC moves to a little community where he is immediately plunged back into the rat race courtesy of a billionaire client (played somnambulently by Robert Wagner).  His adoring wife (Mel Harris, whatever happened to thirtysomething?) meanwhile monitors the precocious and whining children who take in a female golden retriever who happens to have six puppies.  Daddy Hays decides they can't keep the pups so they are reluctantly given new homes to such people as Betty White and Leon Russom.  The rest of the movie has the kids and parents trying to get the pups back and Dad trying to nail the account.  Hays and Harris perform with little energy and the pacing is so slow that it will take a really attentive youngster to stay with it.",1127520000,11,1167,4.635922330097087

1995843,1,B0001FT758,"I'll just get right to it. One of the puppies is run over and killed by a tractor. My four year old ran up to his room crying when this happened and my 8 year old sat on the couch stunned with watery eyes. It really ticks me off when kid's movies do this. It is so unnecessary. My kids already have parents and we do a pretty good job teaching and preparing our kids for life. When I pop a movie in and offer them some popcorn, it is for one reason only; to provide entertainment and pleasure. It is not so some stranger can attempt to teach them lessons on death and loss. Really inappropriate and unnecessary. I am suprised no other review has mentioned this...

Like other reviews point out, the kids were very obnoxious. They are horribly behaved and at one point, one of them even yells at an adult and call him names (the adult was a likeable character, not even a bad guy)in front of their parents, who do nothing about it. Awful movie.",1307836800,4,943,4.238888888888889

1995845,3,B0001FT758,"The local christian book store had this on sale for $5...how could I go wrong? Well, my son didn't even want to watch the whole thing. Although the pups are cute, it is very slow moving. He loves animals, but shows no interest in finding out what happens in the end. The sibling rivalry, name calling, greedy attitudes and sexually charged scenes are not recommended for a family movie at my house. We'll stick to our Space Buddies movie!",1248566400,14,438,4.556962025316456

They did inform me the original shipment was damaged and it has reshipped",1241740800,,129,4.375
1995847,4,B0001FT758,"bought for my 6 yr old son, he seemed to like it and the price wasn't too bad either. The s&h kills you on anything you buy from the amazon sight, unless your a prime member and you get lucky enough to find it on prime- which I wasnt. The price of the movie was ok, the movie was in good condition, but the shipping and hand. charges kind of made it not worth it for me. If my son hadnt wanted to see it so bad, Id not have bought it.",1237939200,,434,3.7282608695652173

1995850,1,B0001FT758,"As a dog lover, I feel really bad being critical of a family oriented movie that is about dogs.... but unfortunately, this movie is really terrible.  I give it one star for the cute dogs, and that's it. The dogs aren't really even IN the movie that much... they don't actually DO anything.  I guess I could have tolerated that, if the rest of the movie were worth watching.  Sadly, it isn't... even worse, there are so many poor examples set in the movie that I didn't really even like having my kids watch it!  First of all, the kids are terribly bratty.  They find a dog, decide to keep her, then find out she is expecting puppies.  She has the puppies, and when the time comes to find homes for them, the kids are upset that they have to get rid of them (understandably, of course.... but MOST people do NOT keep an entire litter of puppies just because the kids don't want to part with them....LOL).  So, various people come to look at and pick a puppy.  The kids treat them terribly, acting like spoiled brats... and the parents do NOTHING.  So, the puppies go to different homes... granted, at least one of them is not for the best, a couple of young guys who don't seem the least bit ready to take responsibility for two puppies (but at this point, the 'reasonable' thing to do would have been to deny them the puppies).  So, kids are sad.... dog seems sad, runs away, but is found and it is decided that she is 'looking for' her puppies.  For some reason, the dad decides he made a mistake, and should have let the kids keep all the puppies (huh??), and the best thing to do is to try and get the puppies back (again, huh??).  So, one by one, they track down the owners, one of which is happy to give the puppy back because it is too much trouble, but the others, I can't believe they are even ASKING to have the puppies back!!  (Except for one... where the family/kids are obviously very attached, and providing a good home.... and I admit, if they had gone ahead and asked for that puppy back, I would have yanked the disc out of the dvd player and taken a hammer to it!).  In one case, the owner doesn't seem to be home, so the family somehow decides it is okay to break into the house and make themselves comfortable, eating snacks, while waiting for the owner to get home, so they can 'ask' for their puppy back!!  I have to be honest, at this point, I stopped watching... my kids had lost interest as well, and after a while, we just turned the movie off.  So, it might have had a redeeming ending, but I doubt it.  (Forgot to mention, while all this is going on, the dad is torn between his new job, and his demanding family.... and makes just as many poor decisions in his career as he does with his family.)
So, to sum things up... I was surprised at how much this movie actually bothered me.  It wasn't just that it was boring, or that the story line wasn't that great.  It was filled with one example after another, of ridiculous behavior, by the kids and the parents.  I actually found myself telling my kids (over and over) that this was ONLY a movie and the things that were happening, and the way the kids were behaving would OF COURSE be unacceptable in our home.
I've seen many kid/family movies that are just 'okay'.  Movies that are very predictable, fairly cheesy, with sub-par acting.... but kid-friendly and somewhat enjoyable to watch.  THIS is NOT one of them.  As I said, the puppies are cute, but aren't even a big enough part of the movie to make it worth watching for the puppies.  So, if you want to watch a movie with your kids that shows them poor examples of almost everything, then this is your movie!!",1215475200,36,3643,4.323529411764706
1995851,5,B0001FT758,"I LOVED this movie!!!!!!

I LOVED on how Animal Planet helped make it. It's about a family that moves to CA and they soon find themselves a Golden Retriever dog they name Pilot. Soon they find out that Pilot is pregnant! And she has 6 golden Retriever puppies. And their names are, Milk Shake, Bandit, Chewy, Wanderer and I forget the other two names. And when they find new homes for the puppies Pilot and the kids want the puppies back! So, they end up getting 4 back.

  It's a cute and touching movie!

  DO BUY IT

They decide they want them back. They learn one of their puppies has died. They do not care much about this. They learn two of their dogs have been renamed to spongebob squidward. They are VERY mad about this. (Likely is Nickelodeon over copyright.) They get their dogs back, and the dog finds a basket of kittens in the forest!
