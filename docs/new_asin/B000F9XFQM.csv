I bought this DVD because I wanted to find and collect movies not very well publicized but in which Zhang is the star. This movie is a complete disaster and waste of money. Were the Cannes officials watching the same movie that I just watched?",1177200000,,348,4.2727272727272725
8119514,3,B000F9XFQM,"I am a Big Fan of Zhang Ziyi. I have seen most of her movies. I purchased this movie because it was unavailable in any video stores.

The movie as a whole was disappointing, very silly and there was zero chemistry between the male and female leads. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the extras(even though they were not subtitled). I could watch my favorite actress up close an personal.",1173312000,,383,4.632352941176471
8119515,5,B000F9XFQM,"The storyline is quite silly and so is much of the acting and music, but Ziyi is just breathtakingly gorgeous as princess raccoon in this Japanese ""operetta.""  She also shows off her graceful dance moves.  Too bad she doesn't really have as many scenes as a Ziyi fan would have liked.  A must-see for all Ziyi fans as well as others interested in eccentric Asian flicks.  Quite a change from the usual fistfights stuff -- and all that gangster stuff from the same director.  In short, a strange movie, but quite entertaining if you don't mind the oddities.

BTW I bought my copy from ""rhstore"" in Ohio via Amazon Marketplace (see ""used"" link to the right) and it's a Hong Kong release by Mei Ah and it's region-free and NTSC (i.e., North America), with English and Chinese subtitles.  (Reportedly Ziyi delivers her lines in Chinese but sings in Japanese.)",1161820800,3,855,4.697986577181208
8119516,5,B000F9XFQM,"I found out about this movie because I really enjoy most of the movies that Zhang Ziyi is in due them being some what ""artsy"". This one was definatly no exception. Watching it and speaking English is not a problem as there are subtitles. Its basily a love story/musical, and any fan of art movies or Zhang Ziyi should view it. Great music, great acting, beautiful colors and sets and quite funny at times as well. Dont miss it. I only wish that the DVD extras, in particular the interviews with the cast was subtitled. It is not, but is still worth watching the extras even when you cant understand a thing.",1152316800,7,607,4.428571428571429
