5581435,4,B00BDSRB2S,"I enjoyed this tribute to the great Jewish composers and lyricists of Broadway such as Irving Berlin, Rodgers ,and  Hammerstein ,Leonard Bernstein and of course my  personal favourites  George Gershwin and Stephen Sondheim. Many other Jewish composers are recognised and this is where I find I have to criticise this program and also the previous 2004 PBS homage to Broadway : The American Musical both programmes egregiously overlook the great Jewish American Broadway composer Cy Coleman,5 Tony awards,20 Tony nominations,10 Emmys,two Grammys. Cy Coleman composed musicals such as  Wildcat Sweet Charity,  Barnum, Little Me, I Love My Wife, City of Angels, Will Rogers Follies and songs like Witchcraft,The Best is Yet to Come and Big Spender,how can this great composer be ignored when Mel Brooks ,who wrote one musical,The Producers,be recognised in both these programmes ?This DVD is great entertainment, I wish the musical clips were longer but there is an extra DVD of interesting extras and if it had recognised Cy Coleman I would give it an extra star.",1369872000,,1061,5.2176470588235295
5581436,1,B00BDSRB2S,"My wife and I watched this dvd ""Broadway Musicals:A Jewish Legacy"". It was poor! It was not interesting at all. I turned it off after 40 minutes on the first disc and decided to watch the rest of the first disc the following day. The second half of the first disc was also extremely hard to watch. It showed clips of performers and clips of composers. It had children of past composers telling stories about their fathers etc... As someone already wrote in a review, the second disc was to include extra performances-I too could not find them. The second disc had short stories again about the composers. My wife and I both retired and play the piano never saw anything on PBS about Harry Warren who wrote 850 songs. He was never spoken about on PBS,or even written about in a biography on VHS or DVD.WHY? I would not advise anyone to buy this ""Broadway Musicals:A jewish Legacy"". There is a 2 or 3 hour biography on Irving Berlin from A&E we took out of the public library that was the very very best biography I have ever seen!!!! It showed and produced songs,photo's,history of broadway that were outstanding. You can't stop watching it.",1369612800,10,1140,4.565853658536585

My only wish was that this program had been longer to include more complete performances or even made into a mini-series similar to the PBS series ""Broadway: The American Musical"". The second disc with extended interviews was even more entertaining and this disc alone is worth the purchase price.

5581441,5,B00BDSRB2S,"GREAT, though I'm no Broadway musicals expert. This DVD made me want to watch musical after musical after musical. This DVD documentary considers a number of significant and much acclaimed shows. My experience with musicals has been enjoyable, but never one presented in NYC.  It is not a definitive list but the people behind the productions discussed do tend to be heavily Jewish, the reason for the special emphasis and look at one nationality's impact on the art form. Note the emphasis is more on Jewish artists' (acting, writing, composing, directing) culture, not religion.

With narration by Joel Grey, it begins with early Yiddish theater--quickly the Broadway American Musical began to draw inspiration heavily from the NYC Jewish population. In 1920s 1 in 4 of NYC population was Jewish, partially explaining the heavy participation in musical production. Of course there are exceptions noted on this documentary. A major one being Cole Porter, who actually had 3 shows flops initially. Porter actually told Richard Rogers he was planning to write Jewish tunes--a sure method, accord to Porter, toward musical theater success. Cole Porter scores big in the 1930s.

An abundance of delightful archival footage of NYC and the theater district, Times Square is used. Also footage of old classic performance bits, even including the Marx Bros. For many Jews a name change was necessary to find success, i.e. Israel Baline (Irving Berlin); Jacob Gershowitz (George Gershwin); Isidone Hochbery (Yip Harburg) who wrote ""The Wizard of Oz"" lyrics, combining with composer Hyman Arluck (Harold Arlen). Jewish Kurt Weill changed from Germany's top theater composer to NYC due to Hitler.

SDH SUBTITLES provided. You even get a look at Huge Jackman (Les Miz) in an excerpt of ""Oklahoma"" on Broadway (1999). Leonard Bernstein turned me on to musical productions in the 1960s, ""West Side Story"". The first Jewish created Jewish story musical, ""Fiddler on the Roof"" led the wave to follow. (A fact I learned from this DVD) You see/hear interviews with some of the great legends, and some of their descendants. It's all presented--and more.

The Jewish community may not have been the only contribution to the stage, but they certainly made -and make- a huge historical mark. It made me realize another aspect of what the world lost due to the command of Hitler.

5581457,3,B00BDSRB2S,"So far I have seen only the broadcast version, not the DVD package, and despite some valuable moments of oral history, it adds up to a seriously skewed and unreliable account.

A fundamental thesis of this documentary is flawed: Broadway musicals actually began more than a century ago, not with Jewish songwriters but with the likes of David Braham (associated with Harrigan and Hart), George M. Cohan, and operetta composers such as Victor Herbert and Rudolf Friml, followed by Harry Tierney. Popular nineteenth-century American comic opera composers like John Philip Sousa and Reginald De Koven had also paved the way.

Are we really to believe that the Broadway musical was born when concepts adapted from Yiddish theater migrated uptown? The musical comedies of Broadway were, in truth, an amalgamation of many influences, including minstrel shows and melodramas; British music halls, Savoyard operas, Viennese and Parisian operettas; sentimental ballads and popular songs from the gay '90s; military marches and waltzes; African-American ragtime and jazz. The kind of musical extravaganza that was most popular in turn-of-the-century New York--like FLORODORA from London or THE WIZARD OF OZ from Chicago--might have started with a fanciful plot and a single pair of songwriters, but the script was, to some extent, little more than a pretext for showcasing the talents of different vaudeville-style singers, dancers, and comedians. The show would soon incorporate specialty numbers created by any number of tunesmiths, and the songs might come and go as various performers joined the cast or left it.

All of this was happening prior to the Jewish influence of Berlin, Kern, and Gershwin, who inherited the traditional formula that WASP audiences expected, as of 1915, and changed it only in a very gradual way (which is precisely why the not-so-formulaic OKLAHOMA! was considered groundbreaking in 1943). For whatever reason, the BROADWAY MUSICALS video fails to give the non-Jewish background its due, just as it ignores the Jewish composer Sigmund Romberg, who triumphed on Broadway in the 1920s with operettas written largely in a conservative classical mold, influenced more by Franz Lehar than the Jewish theater tradition.

Of course, the ""Jewish Legacy"" view of theater history implies that until recently Cole Porter was the only gentile of consequence who created musical shows for the New York stage; there is never any reference to such important non-Jewish names as Eubie Blake, Vincent Youmans, Gian-Carlo Menotti, Robert Wright and George Forrest, Hugh Martin, Meredith Willson, Noel Coward, Galt MacDermot, or Andrew Lloyd Webber. While Jewish immigrant songwriters were trying to sound more mainstream American, and Porter was reportedly trying to sound Jewish, most of the composers on this list were true to their own diverse backgrounds and personal styles. Collectively, their impact on Broadway has extended from the early 1920s to the present day.

The filmmakers also hint at a complex irony: While Jewish producers and composers were making enormous contributions to Broadway, not many distinctively Jewish performers emerged as major stars on the Great White Way (Ethel Merman made quite a point of not being Jewish). On-screen interview subjects belabor the idea that FIDDLER ON THE ROOF was unprecedented in its overtly Jewish setting and characters, totally overlooking the earlier MILK AND HONEY (1961), which composer Jerry Herman momentarily cites as a major success without mentioning its significance in this regard.

The truth is that ""Jewishness"" and other ethnic types were more in vogue back in the 1920s, when audiences could enjoy nonmusical plays like ABIE'S IRISH ROSE and THE JAZZ SINGER as well as singers with unmistakably Jewish mannerisms: not only Fanny Brice and Al Jolson but Eddie Cantor, Georgie Jessel, and a few others. The image of Jews on stage would take a more serious turn by 1937, the date of Kurt Weill's spectacular theater epic THE ETERNAL ROAD, a history of the persecuted Hebrew people as told through Bible stories. FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, then, may have been a milestone in the popularization of Jewish themes but was not without precedent.

On the subject of confused chronology: George Gershwin is discussed before Irving Berlin, who became famous nearly 10 years earlier. ""September Song"" from KNICKERBOCKER HOLIDAY is cited as Weill's first distinctly American hit, as if the melody had not been adapted from a song written for DER KUHHANDEL several years previously in Europe. And more sloppy scholarship: As evidence of the radical nature of WEST SIDE STORY in 1957, we see performance clips from the movie version and a recent revival, neither of which adheres to Sondheim's original Broadway lyrics! The song ""America"" may be an indictment of American prejudice in the film, but the stage version of that number was far tamer.

No one would dispute that for more than half a century, a disproportionate number of the most successful Broadway composers were at least nominally Jewish, although this particular film does an imperfect job of exploring the reasons why. At the same time, we can't help wondering what the reaction would be if American popular music were summed up as a ""black"" legacy, or ballet as a ""gay"" legacy. To focus entirely on one portion of the picture is to misrepresent the whole.

Broadway buffs are encouraged to watch this for the interview footage (including some striking demonstrations of characteristic ""Jewish music"" patterns in nonobvious contexts). But they deserve to be warned against swallowing all this gospel without a grain of salt.",1426291200,6,5649,5.28173719376392

For those of us familiar with the history of the Yiddish Theatre, this comes as no surprise, because, as the Yiddish Theatre faded on the Lower East Side of NYC, those artists just travelled up to mid-town and helped make Broadway what it is today.  Not only that, but most of stand-up comedy is the legacy of Jewish comedians in the Catskill Mountain resorts bringing their humor to  wider audience, and I kind if doubt we would have movies if it had not been for Jewish artists and businessmen creating Hollywood!

5581474,4,B00BDSRB2S,"One might think the title of this documentary to be presumptuous, to say the least, but in reality, Broadway musicals ARE almost exclusively a Jewish legacy. Even one of the few notable exceptions to the overwhelming numbers of Jewish composer/lyricist/authors, Cole Porter, has a tenuous Jewish connection, or so say the makers of this clever, inspired and thoroughly entertaining documentary. (Porter tried to write Jewish music).

There are times when a films premise is clearly intended as a political statement (witness Michael Moores fabricated diatribes). Had that been the case here, the film would have run the risk of being tedious. Fortunately the filmmakers understand they are on solid ground and simply delight in telling their story.

When you think about itand this film does get you thinkingthe Broadway musical as an art form is pretty amazing. The Broadway musical as cultural expression and metaphor through which sensitive subject matter can sometimes be explored, is truly remarkable. This film is masterful in the way it layers revelation upon revelation while it takes the viewer on a brisk and illuminating history of the Broadway musical.

Along the way there are a number of interviews with key creators, as well as some wonderful excerpts from Broadway shows, including Hugh Jackman singing Oh What A Beautiful Mornin from Oklahoma!. My favourite was Zero Mostel singing If I Were A Rich Man at the 1971 Tony Awards. Mostel originated the role of Tevye in Fiddler On The Roof and was deeply hurt not to be cast in the film version, which was happening around the time of this televised performance. (Apparently Mostel lost out on the film because of his habitual improvising).

The interviews and performances are so plentiful that not all of them appear in the film. Hence, there is a generous second disc which includes extended interviews, including one that was not used, even in part, in the finished film. Theodore Bikel talks about his experiences of anti-Semitism while growing up. He also discusses creating the role of Captain von Trapp in the original production of The Sound of Music. While his comments and anecdotes are extremely interesting, they just don't fit the tone of the rest of the film. It was a wise decision to exclude him from the film, but equally wise to include it as an extra feature, amidst many others. Of the additional interviews, the one with Eric Idle is a stand-out as he traces the influence of Gilbert & Sullivan (who were not Jewish) on the musical comedy art form.

I found the 2nd disk of extended interviews interesting, though there are a lot of them (all talking heads) and it took several nights to watch them all (however, I thought it worth the time).  I do wish however that the performance excerpts had been longer since much of this material is not readily available.",1377388800,2,784,4.4475524475524475

5581503,2,B00BDSRB2S,I had recently seen what I thought would be the same program on NPR.  This version has extremely short cuts of the various shows.  I had hoped to possibly intrigue younger family members . . . no hope here..,1373414400,2,207,4.282051282051282
5581504,5,B00BDSRB2S,"What always impresses me is how gifted and creative these people are who made the early years of Broadway. I saw this DVD several times on the local PBS station and finally wanted to get it for myself. It would even be interesting to me to expand it. However, if one asks how did Carousel ever get to Broadway, it is possible now to read more of the story on the Internet. If I ask not being a musician myself, ""how does Richard Rogers create as he does?"" then I can only make an analogy with a world class creative mathematician. I easily gave this DVD five stars for telling a good, compelling story. That almost all these people were Jews is for the sociologists to consider, but it is similar to the Jews from Hungary that came to the United States just before the war and made huge contributions to our scientific success.

These creators give a gift to people like me since I get such enjoyment out of work.",1372896000,,913,4.3391812865497075
