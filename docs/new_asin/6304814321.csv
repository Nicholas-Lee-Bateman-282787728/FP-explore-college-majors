929429,2,6304814321,"Although I LOVED the first Ferngulley, this one was pretty sorry. I don't think that any of the actors from the original worked on this movie. The guy that they got to take over for Robin Williams as Batty Koda sounds like a really bad impressionist. The kids loved the story in this one - the fairies trying to save poached baby animals, but I thought the story was weak. Whenever they watch it, I make sure to leave the room!",1126569600,9,427,4.283950617283951
929430,2,6304814321,"The idea is good, but the charm is missing. Mediocre animation, decent plot but poorly carried out, actors that sound like they're reading the script (a badly written script...). For most people involved in its making, their movie experience is extremely limited--in several cases (especially with the actors), this is the only film in their experience at all. In short, not a true sequel to the original. But they get an E for effort, with a few highlights with creative ideas of what happens to little fairies when they get mesmerized by the world of a human carnival and forget about their true mission in life: to protect living creatures. It is a clean film which promotes good values and has nothing inappropriate for young viewers. Songs are so-so, even if they might be a bit catchy in tune. This has some entertainment value for the 3-6 age range, but anyone older than that will be quickly bored.",1095206400,9,906,4.7405063291139244

929633,5,6304814321,"I loved the Ferngully movies as a kid and when I watched the sequel in my youth, it was very excellent. Years later, as a movie collector, I found this movie again and decided to add it to my collection, and I do not regret it one bit! There are different people using the voice talents of the same characters as Crysta, Pips, and the ever-paranoid Batty, as they do their part in rescuing animals that were stolen by poachers that laid waste to much of their rainforest in a huge fire that got started in the confusion. But the movie is simply awesome! You see how they all deal with their first adjustments to human civilization, including a funny scene with Pips and his Beetle bunch testing out the delights of a nearby carnival. I don't care what the critics say about this movie, it was very funny to me, and my young nieces and nephews had never watched it before and they LOVED it!!!

929636,2,6304814321,"By accident, I came across this sequel to one of my favorite nostalgic classics, and for the heck of it thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't expecting much, but ""FernGully 2 - The Magical Rescue"" still managed to under-perform, thanks to its weak script and reduced production means. I kept reminding myself that it might not be fair to compare this one to its much prettier prequel, but even as its own story, it doesn't hold up very well.

The story: When a clutch of baby animals is snatched from the rain forest by poachers, Pips (Digory Oaks), Batty (Matt Miller,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BioHunter/dp/B0000541S4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BioHunter</a>), and the Beetle Boys venture into human civilization to rescue them.

The original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ferngully/dp/B000A2WAQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ferngully</a>&nbsp;was a movie with a green message: it made an emotional appeal against deforestation, making clear that more people need to be educated on the matter. ""The Magical Rescue"" has no real message, green or otherwise. The plot gives ample opportunity for some good anti-poaching material, but the antagonists are one-dimensional and aren't shown to learn a lesson, and the depiction of the animal trade is pretty removed from reality -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rescuers-Down-Under/dp/B00004R99O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rescuers Down Under</a>&nbsp;did a better job of it. The storyline gets sidetracked by having Pips and the Beetle Boys befriend a human circus girl (Connie Champagne,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vegas-in-Space/dp/B000067J14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vegas in Space</a>) and becoming momentarily enchanted with human life - a lame rehash of the faerie-meeting-human angle of the original. Crysta (Laura Erlich) stays in the background, not contributing to the plot until the second half, by which point I had long realized that I didn't like this movie.

As you may have noticed, no character is voiced by their original voice actor. In the long run, I can't complain too loudly about most of these, save for the absence of Robin Williams as the voice of Batty. While Williams' charged delivery and frantic ad-libbing made for a fun performance, Matt Miller seems to solely read from the script and all but takes the nuttiness out of the character. He's still arguably the most interesting of the cast, but that's not saying much.

While the voicework has become more level and the message more subdued, the sequel's cartoonish-ness has been amplified. The animals are Loony Toons-esque in design, the poachers are wonky caricatures prone to visual gags, and the latter half of the film features a super-charged clown car that can drive on stilts. This was most likely done to make the picture more interesting to look at, since the reduced animation means resulted in a lack of character dexterity and detail, and completely did away with the spectacular backgrounds of the original. The visual design just doesn't stand out at all: everything has that Saturday-morning cartoon look to it, right down to most shots of the rain forest.

In short, having enjoyed the original film is no guarantee that you'll like this one, since it retains neither the look nor the themes of the first. The filmmakers just took the characters and threw them into an unremarkable story, the idea for which might as well have been drawn out of a hat. Don't bother.",1355011200,3,3603,5.803402646502835

Much to my dismay, Robin Williams was not in this movie. I was sthuper pissthed off when I did not hear Robin William's seductive voice in this film. I tried to flush it down my toilet as well as burn it, but this VHS tape was indestructable.  However, I love the elf with his shirt off, he is the Robin to my Williams.

929682,1,6304814321,"I 100% agree with the reviewer who said Batty's voice in this movie sounds like a very bad impression of the voice in the first one. Also the reviewer who said this is basically a poor rehash of ""Rescuers: Down Under"" was also spot on.

There are many things in this movie which make no sense whatsoever and are very logically inconsistent. Maybe that's not a big deal for someone who is 2 or 3 years old, but anyone older will roll their eyes at this film.

I'll list a few of these below:

929686,3,6304814321,"Ferngully 2 is an insult to the original, however I am being generous in giving it three stars because it is a good family film. I'm sure little kids will love the furry little animals that it seems to revolve around, and it has some good morals for your kids about believing in yourself and helping those in need...if that's all you look for when buying your movies.

I have many gripes about this movie, and I'm not sure where to begin. If you have seen and cherish the first movie, well, it's nice to see our two beloved characters, Crysta and Pips, return to the screen, right? Well, if you loved Pips, you're in for a treat. He gets plenty of screen time. As for Crysta? She seems to play second fiddle to everything else, and we actually don't see her much. Mostly we see the furry critters stuck in cages and their attempts to flee or be freed by others. It's no longer about the fairies and the trees and plants in the rain forest, it's about poaching. 90% of this movie takes place outside of the rain forest, which is a shame really, because that was part of the beauty of the first film. The poaching bit also reminded me a lot of another movie's plot...oh what was it...maybe The Rescuers: Down Under? (which btw is a high-quality, five-stars film, I highly recommend) Ferngully 2 was very much a re-hash of that film, which gave me a headache because Ferngully 2 offered nothing new on the take of evil-poacher-traps-the-cute-animals-who-creatively-try-to-escape (this theme is fantastic in Rescuers, not at all in Ferngully 2).

Surprisingly, I have no complaints about the animation...wait, I take that back. It is fluid, yes, and is not all that lacking in quality, but lacks terribly in consistency! If you're a kid, you probably won't notice this, but compared to the beauty of the first film, this is awful! Batty will have large mitten hands at times (and looks generally strange/awkward compared to his sleek design in the first film), Goanna is incredibly huge compared to his former self (and OOC), the fairies...their size is always varying, which annoys me.

Music isn't terribly bad (surprise?), but doesn't hold a candle to the catchy tunes from the first movie such as Toxic Love and Dream Worth Keeping.

All in all, if you pretend this movie has nothing to do with the first and judge it on its own, it's not that bad. It's a great family/kids film. However, I'd like to add to that the fact that the theme of the movie is almost identical to The Rescuers: Down Under, and I would whole-heartedly recommend that movie over this one. Keep the first Ferngully close to your heart and save yourself the headache of this one.",1208304000,2,2651,4.634042553191489
