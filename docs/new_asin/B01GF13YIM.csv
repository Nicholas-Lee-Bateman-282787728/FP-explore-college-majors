7759472,1,B01GF13YIM,"This movie with Theda Bara is lost, as all copies were destroyed and only 20 seconds or so survive. The DVD most likely contains another version, possibly the one made in 1912 with Helen Gardner. Buyer beware!",1466035200,21,209,4.675675675675675
8762788,4,B01GF13YIM,"I would have given it 5 Stars on its own merits, but the movie is NOT the one stated on the front of the box. It's a good production by the Helen Gardner Picture Players. The Theda Bara version, save for a precious few minutes, has long ago disintegrated. Helen Garner was not remembered the way Mary Pickford and other women with production companies in her time. However, the difference is she was the first woman to bankroll and manage her own film company. Besides being a prime example of silent film, it has historical significance. She not only acted, wrote, produced and directed, she had a hand in the crafts as well. Another thing of interest, it's said she was the first to produce a full-length feature -- in fact, this one ""Cleopatra."" The male-run industry had been committed to the notion that audiences could not sit still for more than a few minutes at a time. Kudos to Helen Gardner and her production of ""Cleopatra""!",1528156800,,935,4.604790419161676
8762789,1,B01GF13YIM,"The movie I received was a silent version of Cleopatra, but it was not the one with Theda Bara, Fritz Lieber and Thurston Hall as advertised (as well as printed on the box). It was plug awful. Obviously, low budget and unknown actors who were very inept even by silent movie standards. Very disappointing.",1522195200,,305,4.666666666666667
8762790,1,B01GF13YIM,"THIS IS NOT THEDA BARA! THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING.
THIS DVD SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SITE!
I AM NOT AMUSED!",1510012800,7,109,4.238095238095238
8762791,1,B01GF13YIM,"THIS IS NOT THE 1917 CLEOPATRA.

All copies of that film were lost in various fires over 60 years ago. What this DVD contains is the 1912 Cleopatra starring Helen Gardner, an interesting film but not the one being advertised. The cover shows Bara, the cast list names Bara and consumers will be duped into thinking this is the Bara film.

Shame on the seller and shame on Amazon for carrying this obvious fakery.",1509235200,5,412,4.554054054054054

8762793,4,B01GF13YIM,"Fascinating first version of Cleopatra on film.  And Helen Gardner played the lead and did the costumes and, if I recall correctly, wrote the ""script.""  Only drawback is the VERY annoying music.  I had to mute the sound to watch the movie, so I made a silent movie truly silent.",1487376000,2,278,4.52

8762795,1,B01GF13YIM,"Fraud! Cover shows a scene from the fabled 1917 Theda Bara version, but what you get is the 1912 Helen Gardner version -- and an awful, blurred, smudgy, unwatchable copy of the 1912 movie to boot. I have a clean copy of the restored 1912 version from TCM-HD that you can actually see details on. What this fraudulent purchase gave me is insulting and completely useless. Do NOT be fooled. I genuinely want my money back on this.",1484352000,13,428,4.5
8762796,1,B01GF13YIM,"It is advertised as the 1917 film but it the 1912 film with the 1917 cover photo. Does not even have the same people in it. FALSE ADVERTISING
payed almost $20 for it. A waste of money you can watch the 1912 film on YouTube for free!!!!",1475798400,13,235,4.0212765957446805
8762797,1,B01GF13YIM,"Definitely not the Theda Bara version, this is the Helen Gardner version from 1912.
Also, it's a very poor print with no musical score..
Shame on them for false advertising.",1471651200,19,173,4.8
