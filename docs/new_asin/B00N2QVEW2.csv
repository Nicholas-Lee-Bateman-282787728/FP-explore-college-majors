Each was perfect. Especially Paulo Costanzo as the man with the ""problem"", John Cho as his new wave boss, Tyler Labine as his maybe gay neighbor. Paulo binges on sex with 14 women in one month and he ends up having ""that burning feeling"" his doctor (loved him, too) tells him to contact each of the women. This causes changes in him. Where before they had names like ""man-hands"" ""the butt that ate the world"" etc. now he gets to knows these ladies as people. Very funny and non-stop dialog, very fast, which I love. You have to listen the lines come very fast as times.",1447113600,,735,4.294964028776978

8675850,5,B00N2QVEW2,"I found this movie hugely entertaining and very comical through out the movie. It really relates a lot to real life for a lot of people. Touched on relationships in general, friendships, love, work and how much each means and valued. This kind of movie is probably not for everyone, but I've had it now for a month or so, watched it 3 or 4 times and still find it entertaining, for me, that's huge and says a lot!",1423180800,,413,4.2405063291139244
