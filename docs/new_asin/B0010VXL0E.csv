8238714,4,B0010VXL0E,"Hi. I got this set mostly to see what kind of music the extra cd has on it.
Fist off, the music cd has nothing to do with Pokemon. The only theme in common on both disks is that they are about Christmas.
The songs on the cd are as follows:
1. Up on the house top
2. Have yourself a merry little Christmas
3. Santa Claus is coming to town
4. I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
5. Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
6. Frosty the snowman
7. Silver bells
8. Deck the halls
9. Jingle bells
10. Here comes Santa Claus
So, if you want only Pokemon related Christmas entertainment, then get Pikachu's Winter Vacation on DVD and  Pokemon Christmas Bash on CD.
But, if you're a grown-up wanting Christmas music that both you and your children will enjoy, this set might just be for you.
Hope this review helps.",1264464000,2,794,4.258278145695364
