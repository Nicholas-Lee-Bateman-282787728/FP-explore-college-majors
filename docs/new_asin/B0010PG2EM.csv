8238164,5,B0010PG2EM,"This production stays true to the original. The politics and power brokering hasn't changed since the play was written over a hundred years ago. As a matter of fact, the meeting where the politicians manipulate the towns folk into demonizing the enviornmentalist, could be taken right out of the typical Tea Party town hall Obama Care meets of a couple of years ago.  A little updating of the play would be great, but not essential.",1357516800,,432,4.76
8238165,1,B0010PG2EM,"I've been teaching Ibsen's ""Enemy of the People"" for years. I was looking foward to a new POV. This was the worst movie I've ever seen. A complete waste of my money (paid out of my own pocket!) ... had to turn it off. Don't buy it!!! Horrible adaptation. Absolutely horrible!",1283040000,3,275,4.411764705882353
8238166,5,B0010PG2EM,"This is a wonderful cinematic transcription of one of Ibsen's best plays, and perhaps the best work of Steve McQueen's career. We had a tape of this film many years ago, wore it out, and waited many years for it to be released in a modern format.  We rejoice that we can own it again.  Sober and understated throughout, it is a near perfect representation of Ibsen's work.  The Arthur Miller adaptation of 1966 with James Daly was an embarrassment.  It mocked and derided the good doctor as a fool, completely missing the point of Ibsen's play.  This McQueen effort portrays nobility of character, personal integrity, courage of conviction, and victory of right and good over greed and corruption--whether viewed as a story of petty provincialism or as a parable of political evil on a larger scale.  Grab it, whatever the price, before it disappears again.",1242950400,2,857,4.835616438356165
8238167,3,B0010PG2EM,"Steve McQueen was probably a better actor than his movie star icon status usually allows for. Here he is well-cast and almost unrecognizable under a thick beard at the center of Ibsen's play about social injustice and the dangerous intolerance of groupthink. The supporting cast is very good as well, including Bibi Anderson, Richard Dysart and Charles Durning...but this is McQueen's movie, and he is the main reason to see it. Unfortunately it's not as great an overall film as it should be, due in large part I suspect to the lackluster direction of television vet George Schaefer who simply doesn't know how to adapt the piece very cinematically. Still, the great work by McQueen is gripping and may well have been a sign of things to come as he moved away from action-oriented roles had he not died so relatively young of cancer.

Warner Brothers has just released this little-seen film as part of their new Warner Archives DVD-R program. I have watched about two dozen of these now and the transfers are surprisingly good. However be warned that the people selling them here for anything more than about $24 are ripping you off. All of the Warner Archive titles, including AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE, sell for $19.95 plus shipping on the WB site.",1241654400,,1248,4.777777777777778

8238169,1,B0010PG2EM,"Henrik Ibsen's Enemy of the People is an important play for many reasons. It is surprising how few recordings there are of the Ibsen classic. I have seen both the Kate Reid and John Glover productions. I was excited to order Kamren Kahn's recently filmed (2007) version. Imagine my surprise to discover perhaps the most poorly executed DVD in the history of modern recording.
  Cuiosity is one's first reaction. Why are they using ragtime piano to underscore much of the action? Are the camera angles deliberately odd and unfocused? Did anyone bother to edit before sending it out? Anger begins to overtake the body. Did I really pay $16.00 for this drek? How can Amazon pass this off as serious? Does anyone in the cast know their cues? Embarrassing pauses, awkward staging, filming in someone's house (I love the nerf basketball hoop in the backround of the living room), reminds me of a high school after school project. Then paranoia creeps in. Am I going to be punk'd? Am I the only schlep to ever buy this? I begin to giggle at this point. Full hilarity sets in by Act IV, the mob scene. Clearly the extras do not know their lines. The group chanting is beyond funny. And then a moment of genius: Aslaksen delivering opening remarks before the people. Aslaksen is a confident man, a printer and chair of the homeowner's assiciation in the town. He wields power. But the actor portryaing Aslaksen is literally terrified. His voice begins to go inward, he struggles to recall his lines, sweat begins to cover his face. I feel empathy when young students go through this process. It is like watching a wreck in slow motion. But when grown men and women rehearse, record, and then sell these sorts of displays for public consumption, I feel no pity at all. It out Guffmans Guffman.
  Kamran Cahn, I bought your DVD to show to high school students. We are producing Enemy of the People in February. I cannot show this to teenage children. It is deplorable and embarrassing. Twenty years in Actor's Equity and I have never witnessed a production so devoid of merit on any level. There is not one redeemable quality. I pray that you do not teach. Please, take my $16.00 and find a new profession. I'll raise even more money if you simply stop making DVDs. Please sir, I beg you to stop.
  Buyer beware! If you want to watch Henrik Ibsen's Enemy of the People, buy or rent the Glover or Reid version, buy the Steve McQueen version, have your children perform it in the basement, but please don't support Mr. Cahn's habit. We must help him stop.",1227744000,6,2542,4.6252771618625275
