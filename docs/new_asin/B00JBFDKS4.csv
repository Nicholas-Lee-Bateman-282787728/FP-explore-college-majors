8649595,4,B00JBFDKS4,"The Series -Although, an excellent show with some original story lines that had great potential -  don't let the title fool you - is not ""Jack London's Call of the Wild"". There are some storylines that have similarity to certain episodes/adventures in the book, but basically it is about Buck the dog and the life he may have led after all the trial and tribulations he went through in the book; finally settling with a family that loves him.

The story takes place in a small gold mining town in the Yukon around the late 1800's-early 1900's. Buck comes to town to be auctioned as a sled dog; Miles Challenger, a teen with aspirations of being the best guide there ever was, wants to own Buck desperately, but the bidding is getting very high .Of course, Buck does become part of Miles' family, and is proved to be one great dog, usually saving lives and the day.

The stories are suspenseful, adventurous, and as we get to know the inhabitants of the little town and share their personal lives, many of the episodes are heartwarming as well .Some of the episodes even have a wonderful mystical note to them, including Indian lore, and a visit from a famous gunfighter who as history tells us was not even alive at that time. Although basically a family friendly series, I wouldn't recommend it to the very young child. There are some scenes which may be too violent or scary - dog fighting, bear attacks, murder, etc. Also, another disappointment is that there is no season 2. The last episode leaves us hanging as to what will happen with some of our favorite characters.

The acting is wonderful - Buck is fabulous, and a young Shane Meier interacts expertly with Nick Mancuso as his step-father who is trying hard to both teach Miles the ways of the frontier and be a father to a reluctant step-son ;the scenery, - much taking place in the snowy mountains - is gorgeous; and the background music gives the perfect tone to the stories.

I really enjoyed the series and would recommend it. I think it could have developed into something great, maybe another Lassie.
