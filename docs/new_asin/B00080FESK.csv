2255261,4,B00080FESK,I enjoyed it very much. I like that it had steve borden the actual sting play in it. It showed his career cool and showed he had problems. It did not go into detail about his problems but it showed who he was in a way only a movie can bring. It is in one of my top 10 favorite movie list. That is only because I am a die hard wrestling fan. I loved it,1156896000,2,351,3.6315789473684212
2255262,3,B00080FESK,"While I liked the movie... I liked the Book way better. The movie just didn't have enough detail about Sting journey to Jesus. If you collect Sting then get the movie, otherwise I wouldn't recommend ordering it.",1153785600,,211,4.72972972972973

2255264,2,B00080FESK,"This movie has just highlights of Sting in the ring, no full matches like his other vidoes. The approach taken in my opinion was wrong. Having basically actors portray Sting while having Sting talk over it just doesn't work that well for me.

I found part of just to be some cheap way of putting scenes
together. At times they are effective, other times they're
not. I'd love to see actual footage of the real Steve
Borden in action when he was coming up in wrestling not some
actor. Also the whole bit with that cheap actor posing
as a reporter to get Sting's side of the story was unnecessary.

All Sting needed to do was just sit near the camera and tells
his story which he does later on. The whole issue about
Christianity is fine but for a Sting fan that expects
a little more this was a disappointment. I wouldn't pay
24$ for the DVD if all I'am going to get is some highlights
of him in the ring.

Check out ""Sting Unmasked"" which is very similiar to this
but has way more matches.",1139702400,4,989,4.278074866310161
2255265,4,B00080FESK,"""Sting: Moment of Truth"" is a low-budget albeit sharply made Christian-themed indie film that revolves around the personal life and rising career of one Steve Borden. This movie carries with it a powerful message about the spiritual and emotional price that is often unwittingly paid by those relishing in fame and adulation.  Wrestling fans will no doubt be delighted to see copious amounts of WCW footage in addition to exclusive NWA-TNA footage with such stars as Jeff Jarrett, Abyss, and the tag team of America's Most Wanted. Though some wrestling purists may balk at certain parts of the film (i.e. the renaming of Sting and Jim ""Warrior' Hellwig's ""Blade Runners"" tag team to that of the ""Freedom Fighters""), the movie is fairly accurate in potraying events as they happened (even if alot of it is heavily glossed over). This film, however, is not about displaying Sting's in-ring career highlights. Rather, this movie focuses on Sting the person. More specifically, Steve Borden. From the personal struggles that plagued his life and marriage to the ultimate redemption and salvation he found in Christ, Borden vividly reenacts some of the most potent events that led him to become the man he is today. If the film suffers from any real flaw at all, it's the inclusion of numerous musical sequences which seem to crop up every three or four minutes up til about the 45 minute mark. While this can be annoying at times, it shouldn't detract from the real crux of the story. Essentially, ""Sting: Moment of Truth"" can be described as a Christian-based love story about one man's quest to find ultimate peace and happiness---with a few scattered scenes of bodyslams, clotheslines, baseball-bat-shots-to-the-stomach, and Scorpion Deathlocks thrown in for good measure. Extras on this DVD include a Director's Commentary option, a requisite movie trailer, a Behind-The-Scenes mini-documentary and a ""Making Of..."" special. This is a great film for believers, church youth groups, spiritual-seekers, and wrestling fans alike.",1113264000,18,2026,5.214723926380368
2255266,5,B00080FESK,"This is the best movie ever.  It has Stings very first match and his very last match.  If you are a sting fan, this movie is for you!",1111017600,6,133,3.7142857142857144
2255267,5,B00080FESK,This is a great story about one of the biggest wrestling superstars in history.  I highly recommend this to any wrestling fan.,1357689600,,126,4.7272727272727275
2255268,1,B00080FESK,I ordered a new copy of Sting: Moment of Truth. However I received a used copy of this disc.  When I opened the shipping box I realized that the disc was not sealed with plastic.  Every disc I have ever bought brand new has been sealed with plastic.  The disc was not scratched but had dust on the bottom of it which tells me that it may have been played before.  I am not happy about what has transpired here. Be very careful about what you order from these people as it may not be brand new.,1354492800,2,493,4.051546391752577
2255269,1,B00080FESK,"I thought this movie would follow the typical wrestler theme...where they grew up, how hard it is to make it, great matches of their career.  Shame on me.

I loved Sting in the late 80's and the 90's but this movie was awful.

At times I felt like I was watching SCinemax but it never got to the money shot.  During certain parts I thought Sting was having an acid flashback but then stopped and realized that acid flashbacks probably aren't as poorly directed and produced.

Stinger, please stick to rastlin and leave wrestling docudrama to projects that get funded by WWE studios.  On a side note, I will switch religions to have Sting perform my kids baptism or provide communion in costume with the offering on the tip of a black baseball bat.

I've seen better actin in tough actin tinactin.

Peace and Love....Peace and Love",1298073600,,830,4.598639455782313
2255270,5,B00080FESK,"It's a very good movie. The story is interesting. The acting is solid. The message is powerful. The only thing I have a problem with the film is that the cover claims that Hulk Hogan,Kevin Nash,Ric Flair & other big stars are in this movie but in actuality it is just the stock footage of those stars. The wrestlers that actually appear in Sting's film are Abyss,Chris Harris,Lance Hoyt & TNA stars. Other then that,It's still worth seeing in the longrun. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",1282262400,,488,4.433333333333334

2255272,3,B00080FESK,"STING: THE MOMENT OF TRUTH (2004)
directed by George King
approximately 1 hour 25 minutes

This is the biographical DVD of pro-wrestler Steve Borden, best known to the world as ""Sting"".  It deals with the difficulties of being a wrestling superstar and is made from an overtly religious angle.

The story starts with young (blonde) Steve in Southern California hitting the gym and bulking up.  He accepts an offer to join a group of bodybuilders who are trying to break into the wrestling biz.  Whittled out of this group is a tag team consisting of Steve Borden and Jim Hellwig, who later became famous as the Ultimate Warrior.  The team starts out in Mid-South Wrestling before splitting up and Steve takes on the Sting persona in his solo career.  While still struggling to get by, Steve marries a girl named Sue who stands by him.  The Sting character becomes a huge success but with the success comes temptation and responsibility.  One scene features heavy-handed symbolism showing Borden stumbling through an alley, with loose women, an alcoholic and a man throwing money all chasing after the superstar.  Steve struggles to keep his marriage together and slowly becomes more spiritual by praying and attending Christian gatherings.

The structuring of the movie is weird.  For example when Steve first starts telling his story, he is talking to a newspaper reporter.  When that interview ends, he continues telling the story.  Then later on he is interviewed for the second time by a fanboy internet writer (probably the funniest scene in the movie).  This interview is brief and again Sting continues to talk about the story after it is over.  Also there are a lot of vingettes that go on for a long time.  One that comes to mind is early on where we see memories of good ol sunny California and get the montage of beach bums and people riding their bikes on Venice Beach.  Not a bad scene, but I felt like I was watching video from the Southern California Board of Tourism.

Another thing (which I admit is pretty nerdy of me to complain about) is that the wrestling clips are shown in an order that makes no sense.  One of the first WCW clips shown is from like 1999 or 2000, later on a clip from 1997 is shown etc.  A TNA clip is even shown between some of the WCW clips!  There's a different scene where Steve is on the phone with his wife discussing a match he fought in earlier in the night.  Wrestling fans will recognize this as Bash at the Beach 96, one of the most famous events in the history of WCW.  This segment comes after a scene where Sting is being trained to drop from the rafters which didn't take place until the nWo storyline had taken off.  If you aren't a wrestling fan then this stuff probably doesn't make a difference to you, but this DVD is targeted at a wrestling audience.

The real focus here is on Steve Borden's spiritual redemption and non-Christians may not enjoy the DVD for this reason.  There are some parts which may be of interest to the more secular wrestling fans, such as the direct questions about Starrcade 97 and the ""nWo Wolfpack"", which Steve describes as ""the beginning of the end for WCW"".  I do wish that somebody had asked whether Borden ever considered signing with the McMahons though.",1221868800,2,3248,4.631118881118881
2255273,1,B00080FESK,"This had to be the most absurd film ever. What I hope was supposed to be a bio-doc on the life and career of Sting (or close to it), the film was a hodge-podge of nonsensical wrestling clips from WCW, audio that did not follow the on screen action during those clips, typos in the credits, and in general, things not making a lick of sense. It's similar to a first edit of a film, yet they didn't bother to fix it up.

There is also (in the beginning) a severe overuse of 'B' roll footage, seemingly used to pad the films run time. The B Roll was intended to give the viewer a sense of where the story is and was, but it ends up making you think of how many boring generic clips can they play in order, to the beat of bad music?

Sting himself has to be a odd person. Having seen his WCW dvd, 'Sting Unmasked', in which Sting stays in character...and his character is a real weirdo, btw. It carries over to this film. This is just a weird film period.

For the diehard Sting fan, or the wrestling fan not wanting to miss out on a tremendously bad wrestling film (which doubles as a Christian recruitment film), check it out for yourself. But be sure to follow along with Derek Burgan's review of the film. Just google for it.

Good luck, and stay Sting!",1205020800,4,1253,4.186721991701245

2255275,5,B00080FESK,"This movie is great!

2255276,4,B00080FESK,"I've been a fan of Sting's since he debuted with the Ultimate Warrior as a tag team back in the UWF with Bill Watts. The movie is an awesome story and testimony chronicling Sting's life behind the scenes and off camera, particularly his inner struggles and conflicts and a a spiritual journey that led him to Christ and the restoration of his inner peace and family. A great movie, however, while I waws touched by the story, I was hoping for more footage of Steve Borden in action, maybe even a few matches...which would've been a 1st(a Christian wrestling superstar anthology)...but oh well, Sting's still the man.

8055003,1,B00080FESK,"Finally they make a dvd about STING!!!! one of the greatest wrestlers!

however, it is very easy to tell that WWE did not make this dvd, (if they did then they must have purposely tried to make sting look bad or something I don't know)

this is literally like a movie, where it starts off with a guy interviewing sting, moments of his career kinda how he started out, but this movie was literally all over the place, can't stay focused at all.
With Sting being one of my favorite immediately when I see this dvd about him I get it (I don't pay attention to him in TNA that much or any of those dvd's) but it was horrible, there were barely any details about how he made it, pretty much like no back story, it looked like a bunch of college kids downloaded a moviemaker camera app or whatever and recorded this entire movie from their iphones or whatever..it looked like that too with the quality",1394668800,2,895,4.321428571428571

This is a story that I would have never dreamed was his life but I can understand how easy it is for celebrities to take a wrong path through part of their life without understanding who they hurt.
