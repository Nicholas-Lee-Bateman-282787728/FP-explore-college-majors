965979,5,6305107815,"When I bought this tape to learn tai chi, I was somewhat familar with the exercise form. Claire does an excellent job of describing each of the moves. You also get the advantage of seeing the front and the back to help  you follow along. This is the tape I would recommend to some one who wants  to learn tai chi.",932601600,24,313,4.114754098360656
966088,5,6305107815,"Finally, T'ai Chi presented in a form I can follow!  Claire Hooton's Reverse teaching method helps me move with the group and she moves through slow enough that I can figure out the different steps and perform them.  I've tried other T'ai Chi videos, which were beautiful to watch, but I couldn't perform the steps.  I've tried taking a class, but the instructor grew impatient with me because I kept moving to the opposite direction.  This video actually helped me to learn T'ai Chi.  I still have difficulty doing the steps very fast, but at least I can do them with this video.
Not all T'ai Chi videos work for everyone and no one should judge what methods someone uses to be healthy.  For those of us, who move a little slower or need a different approach, I highly recommend this video.  Do what works for you!",1065916800,6,815,4.503401360544218
966089,1,6305107815,"I wanted to try a new kind of fitness video besides the typical over-choreographed step workout. I bought this tape. The first time I used it I found myself wondering when the ""exercise program"" mentioned on the back cover was going to start. Whoever called Hooton an ""old bag"" was right on the money. She didn't have a whole lot of energy and was a very bland leader. I had never tried t'ai chi before, but thanks to this video I never will again. Buy something to use for an exercise program, just don't buy this!",1063411200,,515,4.375
966090,2,6305107815," This video was my first instruction in T'ai Chi Ch'uan. While I have some extensive history with martial arts, it has been several years since I practiced any forms or kata, let alone stretched and centered myself. I purchased this video with the hopes that it would teach me the movements, styles, breathing patterns, and fundamentals I needed to practice and become proficient. It did just that, to a degree, but I have some criticisms.
  Ms Hooton seems knowledgeable on the subject, including some history and discussion of the major principals. The pace is slow and deliberate (as it should be...this is a beginner video, not a `jazzercise' fat-burner) and the instruction is repeated and shown from two angles, using the so called `EZ Learn Reverse View'...a fancy name for 'showing the movements from the students view' (...it still perplexes me.)
  Unfortunately, her teaching seems focused on a very specific crowd. She continually makes analogies and comments as if she is in front of a classroom full of people, not a camera. While these comments may be good when students can ask for clarification, they are distracting to someone watching a video screen to interpret stance and movement. It is obvious she did not script out what she wanted to verbally convey before the cameras rolled.
  Do not get me wrong, I think this is a very good video for those with no martial arts training who want to learn the Yang Short Form (the first 20 movements) of T'ai Chi Ch'uan. But if you have any previous experience, you may want to find something a bit more advanced. The instruction is excellent, but you may get bored with her explanations.",1037491200,4,1648,4.843416370106762
966091,2,6305107815,"I'm sorry to say this video drove me absolutely nuts!  Maybe it's just me, but I think an exercise video should have you MOVE at some point.  This lady just talks and talks and talks!  This is probably great for someone who is starting at step one, but for anyone with ANY experience at all, this is BORING!  I'm going to sell this copy and look for one that is a little more advanced.

966092,3,6305107815,"Being new to T'ai Chi I can not judge something like this on any type of a scale.
I would have like to see more breathing information, and would have enjoy a bit more over all information on T'ai Chi it's self.
It is set up so you can follow along well, and does not move on a ""hurry lets get this done"" pace.",1014163200,,309,3.84375
966093,4,6305107815,"I didn't realize how stressed I was until I got this video and went through the motions as Mrs. Hooton was demonstrating them.  By the time the session was finished, I felt more relaxed than I had in a very, very long time.  She is an excellent teacher.  Thank you for offering this video to the public.  I highly recommend it.",1011916800,3,327,4.311475409836065
966094,1,6305107815,"Claire Hooton is such an old bag,she can barely move herself. Her shoulders are hunched and she seems not to be even bending her knees on some of the postures. And she says men are bound up! Her hands are way too dead and limp and her form shows no spirit whatsoever. She seems to be just barely able to gothrough the motions. A horrible, uninspiring video,steer clear!",1007942400,,369,4.4411764705882355
966095,1,6305107815,"After one session with this video I went back to my other one (Tai Chi for Health, the LifeStyle version) and this one has never seen the inside of my VCR again.  I found both Hooton's teaching style and her hunched-over  posture while demonstrating the moves off-putting and uninspiring.  She  looks like she has a spinal deformity when she moves through the postures,  and I'd rather not learn that particular ""style,"" although it  might appeal to others.  My recommendation is to check it out of the  library or find a friend who has a copy, and try before you buy.",949968000,36,568,4.61
966096,5,6305107815,"I don't believe that I could have found a better instructional video for Tai Chi! Living in a small town in the middle of no where, finding an  instructor for Tai Chi was not an option. This video was the perfect  solution. Claire first demonstrates the movements that you'll practice  first then with the assitance of two of her students you go through those  movements again, and in the same method as if you were taking a class. The  lessons are broken up in easy to learn segments and at the very end of the  video you go through the entire beginner's level again. Her explanations and  imagery is easy to understand and to implement.  For the price, I don't  think you can find a better video for yourself.",941414400,86,711,4.449612403100775
7882987,4,6305107815,The DVD is easy to follow for a beginner.  The reverse view helps to show the moves.  The exercises are relaxing.,1366761600,,113,4.333333333333333
7882988,4,6305107815,"I liked it to use until I could get into a class, however I like the class better.  This works if classes are not available or the times don't work for you",1357948800,,155,3.84375
7882989,5,6305107815,My first experience with Tai Chi was through this video and as a result I have been able to advance more quickly.  Claire Hooten makes things easy for you with easy-to-remember tips.  But what's really great about her video is that her two assistants have their backs to the camera so you can go through the motions along with them like in a real class.  I recommend this video for anyone who is serious about learning Tai Chi.,1324857600,,427,4.448717948717949
7882990,5,6305107815,"THE Reverse method of teaching makes it so much easier to follow compared to other methods i have seen. Clair has been teaching Tai CHI a long time and it shows in
this Video. Excellent work.",1314057600,,191,4.333333333333333

Claire Hooton is a beautiful older woman and the host. While she seems to ""know her stuff"" I found the instruction unpleasing. I think it would be great for older adults looking to learn T'ai Chi at home but not for younger people. It's geared toward older women.

It's also an older video. While it has 2002, 2008 as the copyright dates, it looks like it was filmed in the mid 90's. If you would prefer something more recent and geared toward younger people, don't get this DVD. However, if you are an older woman, this may be perfect for you!",1239321600,5,701,5.481481481481482
7882992,3,6305107815,"The other person who wrote a review saw only the negative, but it isn't that bad really. When you go to a studio, they often first show you face to face the moves (you have to do correction) and then the reverse and that is exactly what Claire Hooton is doing. So why complain? I found the DVD quite helpful, it made me feel like I am with the teacher in one room.",1209686400,2,364,4.0
7882993,2,6305107815,"I liked how clearly she described and demonstrated the movements, but I found her version of the form to be awkward and stilted rather than demonstrating the graceful and free-flowing movements I used to see performed each morning in the parks near our city's Chinatown.

The hand movements are odd and I find it hard to relate them to the martial-arts foundation of tai chi (e.g., other instructors leave the palm facing the opponent for an obvious strike, whereas this tape has you looking as if you just are going to poke their eyes or making a bird's beak--the flow of movements make more sense when you know what the base is rather than remembering by rote the next step is ""holding a teabag"").  The body movements are also overly restrained in scope--you don't really stretch out for the strike--you seem to stay folded over on yourself.

Again, I found her detailed instructions very clear, but I just do not want to practice this hunched-over, constrained form.",1159228800,,969,4.790419161676646
7882994,5,6305107815,"This tape was recommended to me and I also recommended it to others.  The

""Reverse View"" method is a wonderful technique so you can actually see the form, moves and postures to use personally.  The instructor's voice, attitude and methods are very unthreatening especially for someone who is just beginning to learn!  A wonderful tape!",1123200000,,336,5.054545454545455
7882995,5,6305107815,"I read all the critiques of this tai chi tape, and had to laugh at some of the attitudes. I have copies of both Claire Hooten's tapes and have thoroughly enjoyed them. I remembered some of the things I have read about tai chi, one thing comes to mind when watching this tape, I don't know if these are in the right order but the saying is ""from the soft comes the strong and from the slow comes the swift"" Try it if you don't believe me. It is way more difficult to do it slow than to do it fast.",1093910400,,496,3.9207920792079207
