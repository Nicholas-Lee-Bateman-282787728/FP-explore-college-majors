2064161,5,B00026L8H6,I love the show it is the best. I think that if you don't like the show I have on thing to say to you do you live under a rock like that idiot patrick of spungebob squarepants.,1091145600,,176,3.6578947368421053
2064162,5,B00026L8H6,"I have been watching Case Closed on Adult Swim since the begging of summer. I doubt I have seen the episodes on this dvd, but I can clearly state Case Closed is one of the best anime and mystery shows I have seen.

The plot goes as follows: Jimmy Kudo is a highschool student. He is also an avid soccer player and helps the Tokyo police solve mystery cases. One day Jimmy witnesses a murder by a powerful crime family. They catch him and force him to swollow a pill that transforms him into a child. Now much younger, Jimmy renames himself Conan and doesn't let his small size keep him from solving mysteries.

Despite fantasy elements and some wacky objects Conan uses, which people may find confusing if they have not seen may animes, Case Closed provides complex and realistic cases. Every detail Jimmy/Conan uncovers is important, the smallest clue may be the one that unravels the mystery.

Fun, smart, unpredictable, and filled with humor, no criminal is safe from young Conan!",1090540800,6,983,4.670520231213873
2064163,5,B00026L8H6,"Case Closed is by far the best show that i have ever seen in my life. I haven't missed a single episode and I knew that I was going to like it even before it started showing. Everyone else that I know who watches it has missed at least one episode and I'm glad I haven't missed any because I don't know what I would do if I didn't know what happened in an episode. This isn't really a good show for little kids because there is a lot of murder in it, most of the cases(episodes) involve murder but it's a really good show all the same. When this show started to come on i started liking the weekends less because Case Closed comes on Monday through Thursday at 1:00 AM. Everyone should watch this show.",1090454400,,702,4.131386861313868
2064164,5,B00026L8H6,"I have been watching the show since my school went out and I must say I love it. Just today I was telling my family the only bad thing about the weekends is Case Closed is not on. I can't what to get the 3 movies coming out. The show is vary good. I always watch it Monday Throw Thursday on adult swim (cartoon network) at 12:30. The show is better than  5 stares Id say it was at least 10 stares. And don't think It's a kid show because I sometimes watch it with my parents. They say they think it is a vary good show to watch, and so do I. It's a good family video.",1089590400,,567,3.805084745762712
2064165,5,B00026L8H6,"Yes, I know the DVDs aren't out yet... but I've gotten hooked on this show after watching it on the Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"" block.  ""Case Closed"" is Funimation's English dub of ""Meitantei Conan,"" or ""Detective Conan,"" the anime adaptation of the popular manga by Gosho Aoyama.  (So if you've been looking for info on a show called ""Case Closed"" and can't find much, try looking for ""Detective Conan"" instead and I guarantee you'll find much more.) Produced by Tokyo Movie Shinsha (TMS), also known for LUPIN III and HAMTARO (which, in fact, shares an animation director with this series), the anime has been going strong on Japanese TV since its debut in 1996, and even now is still the most popular anime on Japanese TV, still scoring double-digit ratings (it's even higher-rated than INUYASHA in Japan right now).  This is actually the second attempt to get the show onto TV screens in the U.S. - Fox Family was originally supposed to air the show in 2000 under the literal English title, ""Detective Conan,"" but apparently balked at the more violent scenes and never picked up the series.  The previous reviewer already outlined the premise to the series, so I won't go into that.
I'm a huge fan of not only anime, but also true-crime television shows such as ""American Justice"" and ""Cold Case Files"" on A&E and much of what's seen on Court TV, and I'm happy I've finally found a show that marries those two loves - there really hasn't been a good one since ""Inspector Gadget,"" and that was way back in the early '80s.  The animation style is simple and cartoony, which does make it seem somewhat out of place alongside other Adult Swim shows like Cowboy Bebop and Trigun.  But don't let that fool you - most of the cases Conan solves are murders, and if you're easily disturbed by scenes of corpses, even animated ones, you might want to stay away, or at least avert your eyes when they show the corpses.  Also, Richard Moore is one of the biggest sleazeballs in all of anime - he smokes and drinks heavily, and is also a womanizer and totally full of himself.  (Rachel is so much more mature than he is, she may as well be his mother!) Thus, this show might be too intense for young children.
The dub isn't the best I've heard - to tell you the truth, Conan's voice kind of grates on my nerves and makes him sound more like a girl than a boy, and one would expect a sleazeball like Richard Moore to sound more, well, sleazy than he does here.  However, Rachel Moore is well-voiced, as are most of the criminals.  I'm looking forward to getting the DVD which will hopefully have the original Japanese track, but the dub is passable.  Then there's Katsuo Ono's music, which is excellent.  I've actually gone out and bought an import ""Detective Conan"" CD and am looking forward to hearing its contents.
Incidentally, here are the original Japanese names of the main characters from ""Case Closed""... Rachel Moore: Ran Mouri; Richard Moore: Kogoro Mouri (he was actually named after another famous detective of Japanese literature); Inspector McGuire: Inspector Megure; Amy: Ayumi Yoshida; Mitch: Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya; George: Genta Kojima; Serena: Sonoko Suzuki.  And of course, Jimmy Kudo is Shinichi Kudo in the original.  Conan and Dr. Agasa's names were unchanged.
All in all, this is a very unique series and unlike anything else out there.  It might not seem like an ""Adult Swim""-type show, but it is a refreshing change of pace from the other anime series on the air right now.  Check it out and find out why the Japanese have gone ga-ga for this show for eight years!",1089417600,7,3581,4.678343949044586
2064166,5,B00026L8H6,"As of this review the first set of Case Closed DVDs have not been released, however, the episodes on this disc have already aired on Cartoon Network, so I'll be able to review it knowing what the content of these DVDs are.
In the first episode, ""The Big Shrink"", Jimmy Kudo is a grade-A teenage detective who solves murder cases with ease. He goes to a park with his crush, Rachel Moore. On one ride a murder takes place with a girl beheading her ex-boyfriend which Jimmy solves. On their way out, Jimmy goes into a dark alley after seeing a man dressed in black who was on the ride running into the alley. Jimmy overhears an exchange, but gets knocked out and is forcefed some poison from the men in black (there's two of them now - one just appeared out of nowhere). When the episode ends he wakes up to see a couple of cops at his aid. One says to him, ""Don't worry little boy. You're safe."" (CONAN'S HINT: skyscraper)
In Episode 2, The Kidnapped Debutante, Jimmy finds that he's shrunk! He comes to Dr. Agasa, a family friend, and Agasa tells him that he must keep his identity a secret to everyone, including Rachel (his parents live outside the country). Rachel comes to Agasa's place to ask him where Jimmy is, and the shrunken Jimmy puts on a pair of his dad's glasses to disguise himself and makes up a new name - Conan Edogawa! Rachel invites ""Conan"" to stay with her and her dad. They go home and Rachel's dad (Detective Richard Moore) has just received a case. A girl has been kidnapped, and Conan finds out who the kidnapper is, but Richard takes all the credit. (CONAN'S HINT: iceblock)
In Episode 3, ""Beware of Idols"" Conan, Rachel, and Richard investigate a case involving a stalker of the popstar Yokou Okina. They go to her apartment to discover a dead man is lying on the floor with a knife in his back. Conan knows who did it, and wants to tell everyone, but nobody listens to him. He uses a voice-changing bowtie invented by Dr. Agasa, and knocks out Richard to tell the investigators, police, etc. who the killer was (this tactic will be used in many future episodes). (CONAN'S HINT: Neon signs)
In Episode 4, ""Fish Marks the Spot"", Conan goes to a museum with some kids from his new school - Amy, George, and Mitch. They find something that looks like a treasure map, and go to cause havoc in a clothing store, until they get kicked out. Conan tries to figure out what the map means, but he can't until night comes... the Junior Detective League (the collective name of Conan, George, Mitch, and Amy) decide to follow signs that lead to the ""treasure"", but Conan says that they need to follow neon signs instead, because at the top of the map there's a crescent moon. The JDL find the gold, and it's revealed by some Italian gang members that it was stolen gold. The JDL turn the gang members in after Conan comes up with a clever way to escape. (CONAN'S HINT: Cellphone)
In the last (5th) episode, Conan, Rachel, Richard, and the JDL get onto a train leaving for a wedding Richard must attend. Conan finds an unexpected duo - the men in black - on the train, and investigates what they're up to. He finds out that the train is going to blow up from a suitcase with a bomb planted in it, and the owner of said suitcase is going to blow it up without even knowing it! Can Conan save the train and everyone's lives? (CONAN'S HINT: Chocolate bar)
This series is absolutely stellar, and reccomended for all Anim fans.
(BTW, if you're wondering about the (CONAN'S HINT:  ) things, those are little 2-second ""hints"" as to what the solution to the next episode is going to be. For example, in ""Beware of Idols"", the hint is ""neon sign"". In the next episode, ""Fish Marks the Spot"" Conan follows the neon signs throughout the city to find the gold)",1086220800,11,3762,4.436416184971098

You try and keep up with this kid and solve whodunnit first and I will be impressed",1096761600,3,487,4.180851063829787
2064178,5,B00026L8H6,"Never before have I watched anything animated and had to think so much, every episode. This anime is great. I first discovered it on Adult Swim, like nearly everyone else here. I saw a commercial for it and kind of shrugged my shoulders, but my brother stayed up late one night and watched, and once he told me about it, I got sucked in, too. I am now completely hooked on it. Detective Conan, to me, is full of originality, and its plot is brilliant. I absolutely love the characters--I don't think any main characters annoy me at all (although George's Kuwabara voice amuses me). And like I said, if you want something that'll make you think, but is still very entertaining, you owe it to yourself to check this out. I've always hated mysteries, but Case Closed/Detective Conan makes them FUN.

And yes, you will find yourself at least slightly annoyed at weekends. ^^;

With the DVD releases, it seems that Cartoon Network is showing the first 51 episodes, and that's ALL they're showing (there's a press release about it on AnimeNation's website), and the DVD after this one picks up at episode 53. Not sure FUNimation will be releasing DVDs for episodes 5-52, but let's hope so!",1094774400,11,1183,4.655502392344498
2064179,5,B00026L8H6,"Case Closed/AKA Detective Conan for all you pollitically correct Anime lovers out there is a mystery drama that at many times has a witty and serious plot line. It's intrigung and mastermind plot should keep you hooked but if that isn't enough for you i can almost guarantee you will be cleverly upsided and in certain ways ""swayed"" into loving this Anime by the very intense action times and or the amazing crimes the ""enemies"" almost pull-off. This particular creation will keep you waiting and wanting more and more even if its only beacause it's so hard at times to figure out the current case. Well I better stop babbling I give Detective Conan 5/5 Stars beacause it will keep you hooked untill the very end and thats all an Anime artist plot designer or engineer could ever hope for (next to the cash ;) ) trust me. One more thing if this review doesn't help you than please by all means check out the show on Adult Swim (cartoon Network Channel) at 1:00 Est time and see for yourself.

-Untill my next review stay safe, strong, and keep spending, spending, spending on what you like for there is almost no greater joy.

2064180,5,B00026L8H6,"Everyone seems to agree with me on this, I guess.  When I first saw CASE CLOSED on Adult Swim, I was a little weary.  I've only been dragged into this anime crazy halfway, but this series DEFINITELY has changed all that for the rest of my life.  I ignored it and just occasionally watched Inu Yasha, but as I was doing my homework I needed to procrastinate, and I saw what an awesome anime CASE CLOSED really is.  The story is so intricate and addictive.  Not the stories so much (but isn't it interesting how you can't ever really figure it out?  Well, I didn't at first, but now I'm kind of getting on to the way the show is written and I usually can at least identify whodunnit.) but Jimmy.  Jimmy and Rachel, the way he has to keep his secret of being Conan from her.  I LOVE how they in an early episode have Rachel figure it out!  She never again guesses that it could be Jimmy inside that tiny body, which aggrivates me.  I would have loved to see how it would have turned out had Rachel kept that idea in the back of her mind, kind of like a conspiracy theory.

I too now abhor the weekends because CASE CLOSED isn't on.  (It's actually Thursday and the show has just ended.  A[...]  Poor me.)

If anyone has a doubt about CASE CLOSED, you must be insane.  ^_^  Because one truth will prevail.  Not to mention the voice of Jimmy is quite sexy.  BAHAHAH!",1094083200,2,1361,4.22568093385214

I gotta check this out."" and when I first saw this show I said ""WOW"" (My jaw Hung Open lol) then I tune into it EVERY SINGLE NIGHT I Love this show because it gets you thinking, and you never know who the Killer is, even though the show give you hints (BIG one's once you see that the show is over, and they might not seem like a big hint but they are) so I am going to buy this Anime because it is my favorite show hands down.",1092960000,2,592,3.821138211382114

The only anime I can think of that beats it hands down is FLCL( FLCL is a vary strange anime show that aired on adult swim for a short time, it is a show that is funny but for us more intelligent people it will rilly make you think.)

2064184,5,B00026L8H6,One truth does prevail in almost seemly impossible cases in which High School Detective Jimmy Kudo is involved. One night after taking his childhood fried Rachel Moore to the amuesment park Jimmy solves a homicide but sees a suspicious man dressed in black and follows him. Another man knocks him out and he is fed an experimental drug which transforms him into a 7 year old child. he takes the name Conan Edogawa and has to assist the not so great detective Richard Moore to solve cases while trying to get his real body back. I got hooked after being intrigued by the show on after Inu-Yasha and I have not missed an episode since. This show is great for people who love mystery and is quite funny. I recommend this DVD to all.,1092700800,,729,4.447761194029851
2064185,5,B00026L8H6,"When Case Closed was unveiled on Adult Swim I ignored it and just watched Inuyasha and Family Guy. Then,I watched a few more episodes and more and more. Now,its my fav. show (I gradually began to despise weekends when Case Closed wasn't airing) The story:Jimmy Kudo is a teenager who plays for the school soccer team,and helps crime cases for the Tokyo police. One day,though,Jimmy witnesses a crime(a powerful crime family).The family captures Jimmy and poisons him. Then when Jimmy gets up,he realizes that he is 3ft. tall. Named Conan Etagawam,Jimmy must conceal his identity (His parents,who are out of town and a professer are the only ones who know his identity)Living with the ""great"" detective Richard Moore (Conan Knocks out Moore and puts him in a sitting position) and Rachel (who happens to be Jimmy's girfriend,) its up to Conan to find a way to get his body back while solving murder cases. This will appeal to Anime/mystery fans (a single staple can change the outcome of the episode) If your looking for something different in anime then Case Closed is definitely for you. I would recommend this DVD to anyone.

8022925,4,B00026L8H6,"It's a rough life being a teenage detective genius -- crimes happen everywhere, and strange people may shrink you into a small child. Such are the problems for Jimmy Kudo in the first volume of ""Case Closed - The Secret Life of Jimmy Kudo,"" a solid little mystery manga with a healthy dollop of comic relief and romance -- the mysteries are a bit spotty, but promise to improve drastically.

Jimmy Kudo is a detecting genius, to the point where the police call him in all the times and he gets fanmail from girls. But at a trip to the amusement park with his childhood friend Rachel, he has to solve a gruesome beheading on a rollercoaster. And when he later witnesses a blackmail payoff, he's knocked unconscious and force-fed a poison by a pair of mysterious men in black. And they're not as nice as Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.

When Jimmy wakes, he's horrified to realize that he's been shrunk into the body of a first-grader. His old friend, kooky scientist Dr. Agasa, says that he must keep his true identity a secret to keep the MIBs from returning -- and he should live with Rachel and her dad until he can find the mysterious men, and have Agasa make an antidote.  But while Rachel's dad Richard is a detective, he's a pretty inept one. So Jimmy -- now using the name ""Conan Edogawa"" -- must solve the cases through hints, dropped clues, and some James-Bondian gadgets (provided by Agasa).

The first is the case of a kidnapped little girl, which takes an unexpected twist when someone ELSE kidnaps her. And then Richard's favorite pop idol needs his help -- first she's being stalked, and then a man is found dead in her apartment. A coded map leads Conan and his first-grade pals on a treasure hunt (while being stalked by a trio of Mafioso!). And when Conan spots a couple of creepy black-clad men on a bullet train, he overhears them speaking of an illegal deal with someone else... and a bomb in a briefcase, set to go off in just a short while.

""Case Closed - The Secret Life of Jimmy Kudo Volume 1"" has a pretty complex plot to introduce over the course of just a couple episodes. But these five mystery stories introduce the characters and the beginning of an overarcing plot -- in this case a sinister syndicate, a mystery poison, and some truly gruesome crimes with bizarre twists. One particularly nasty moment has a decapitated man's body spewing blood on a rollercoaster... definitely not for kids.

The main problem is that the first few mysteries solved (especially the one in the first few pages) are rather simplistic and easily solved. They also get a bit far-fetched at times... seriously, who commits suicide like THAT? And for some inexplicable reason, they changed the original Japanese names to Westernized ones -- Rachel, Jimmy, Richard, Michelle, etc. And why does Dr. Agasa have a German accent?

However, the story itself is pretty solid -- it has a unique dilemma, some murky bad guys and odd crime-solving methods (ventriloquism! Dog-riding!) since poor shrunken Jimmy cannot get the cops to take him seriously. He also gives it a hefty dose of humor (""Little boy?!""), usually from the inept Richard. And there are some flickers of he-bugs-me-but-I-love-him romance between Rachael and Jimmy, which is somewhat hampered by his tiny prepubescent body.

Jimmy is a pretty endearing character despite being a genius who is fully aware of that fact -- he's also kind, sharp-witted, and a massive detective geek who prattles endlessly about Sherlock Holmes. You really feel for him when he gets chased by cops through the rainy streets, after being turned into a seven-year-old. And while Rachael seems too grumpy at first, she's soon fleshed out into a butt-kicking yet sensitive heroine.

""Case Closed - The Secret Life of Jimmy Kudo Volume 1"" has some initial flaws, including some rather weak initial mysteries. But it's a solid start to the series anyway.",1255046400,,3897,4.752958579881657
8022926,4,B00026L8H6,"With so much ""eye candy"" anime out there, it is refreshing to enjoy this series, which taxes your brain as well as tickles your funnybone.

Case Closed is the story of seventeen year-old Jimmy Kudo, who is a well-known amateur detective.  He assists the police, a la fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, who is Jimmy's hero.  Jimmy is sweet on a girl in his class.  Her father is a private eye, but suffering because of Jimmy's prowess.

The story changes drastically when Jimmy stumbles upon a back-alley political scandal.  The men poison him, but the poison doesn't kill him - it only reduces his age.  Now Jimmy is a tiny eight-year old.  He now stays with his ""girlfriend"" and her dad.  His real identity is secret in order to protect his girl from the thugs, who would surely kill him if they found out he was alive.

He adopts a new name, in honor of the English author who created Holmes: Sir Edgar Conan Doyle.  Now, ""Conan"" and his school chums are cracking cases and criminals' skulls as the Junior Detective Agency.
