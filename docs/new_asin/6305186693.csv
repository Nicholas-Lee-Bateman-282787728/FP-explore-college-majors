This occurs near the beginning, so the film is almost all about his strange tragicomic adventures as he is forced to rely on the Belfast demi-monde, and they exploit him for their own purposes.
The strange characters he encounters, and the hallucinations he experiences turn this into something resembling a horror film, while the story has many points in common with Kafka's ""The Trial"".
Although the suspense never lets up for an instant, the real theme of the film is alienation and the state of grace, and there are some moving scenes where the wounded fugitive looks from a snowy alley into a bedroom with happy children playing or a phone booth with two housewives gossipping to each other as they share the phone. There are even biblical quotations to drive home the metaphysical theme.
People who know Carol Reed's films swear that this is the best; and all lovers of film noir are missing out if they haven't seen Odd Man Out, because it is probably the best one ever made.

988834,5,6305186693,"This is the greatest film I've ever seen. No one I know (of the dozens I've urged to see it) has ever disliked it, and it has become for others, their favorite movie too. It is really a story of all people: in their  struggles on earth, their increasingly less purposeful attempts to survive,  their deaths, the things they love, their religious faith transcending  their deaths. It is also the story of the varied reactions of people toward  one such person, a wounded, dying I.R.A. gunman on the run on the streets  of Belfast or Londonderry in the late 1940s. The cinematography, the  breadth of social classes (and ages) shown, the symbols, the suspense, the  tenderness and callousness, are fascinating.  The religious insights of the  gunman, and of the grandmother of the girl who has a crush on him (and goes  out into the Irish alleys to search for him) and of the police chief  searching for him, are extraordinarily deep for a movie that is also  edge-of-seat suspense.  I've read that this is James Mason's favorite among  the movies he did. The director Carol Reed's better known movie, ""The  Third Man"" with Orson Welles, was not quite as broad or as deep as  this.  I note that every single person reviewing this movie has given it  the highest rating this system allows; (how many other movies are AVERAGING  5 stars?)

988938,4,6305186693,"Johnny McQueen (James Mason) has been hiding out for six months since breaking out of a Northern Ireland prison. He's an Irish nationalist and has been planning a big heist to finance the nationalists' activities. His friends (including his new girlfriend) try to convince him not to go on the heist since he's been out of the action for so long. He goes anyway. Things go awry during the getaway and Johnny is left on the streets of Belfast with a bullet in his shoulder. As he tries to get back to the safe house, he runs into a variety of people who have a variety of reactions to him and his predicament. Some want to help him out, some want to sell him out, some want nothing to do with him. His girlfriend and some of the other nationalists are also looking for him. The cops have all the streets blocked and are ready to bring him in, if only they can find him.

The movie is not at all a political diatribe for either side of the issue. Johnny is a dying man who is more of a pawn than a player. The story moves a little slowly at points but the stark noir visuals and the constant introduction of new characters who could be allies or betrayers keep viewers paying attention. The details of their personalities are quite rich and evocative--one cop isn't interested in whether people are good or bad, only in their innocence or guilt; a Catholic priest wants to help but the only payment he'll offer is faith. The actors, even in small roles, do a good job (William Hartnell, the First Doctor, plays a saloon owner!).

I certainly wouldn't describe this as a fun movie, nor would I call it a tense thriller or a great heist/chase movie. It is an interesting look at a desperate man at the mercy of the people around him and how those people treat him. I found the ending unsatisfying but understand it narratively.",1464393600,,1823,4.406528189910979

988940,4,6305186693,"I have little doubt this movie would have been forgotten long ago in the hands of a different director and/or cast.  Lead character Johnny McQueen is presumably a high-ranking fellow in the IRA but this movie never explores politics.  Instead, what we get is two hours of watching a man wounded during a robbery roam the city streets and evade authorities while his life slips away.  Not much of a story if you think about it.
However, if that man happens to be played by James Mason, and he and the rest of the cast are working under the direction of Carol Reed, a rather mundane story becomes a work of art.
Black and white is as important to this film as are any of its characters.  The tension of nearly every move Johnny McQueen makes--the ducking into alleys and dark corners, hiding in stairwells and bomb shelters, hobbling down a cobblestone backstreet while it snows--is amplified by Carol's unique eye for value, depth and contrast.  It's impossible to imagine how this film would have worked like it does had it been shot in color.
The story takes an unexpected (and sort of bizarre) turn during the last half hour and the ending is truly tragic, but James Mason and the rest of the cast are certainly up to task and everyone delivers a fine performance.  Even so, the cinematography and direction are what make this a great film.  Carol Reed followed this with ""The Third Man"" and it is indeed the better movie, but only because it is (in my opinion) the better story.",1452988800,4,1481,4.566037735849057

988942,4,6305186693,"No question being a revolutionary in non-revolutionary times is a tough dollar, or as the case here in the film under review, Odd Man Out, being such a stout-hearted fellow in Belfast (although the city is unnamed in the film but it has the look of that city and the kicker is the Royal Constabulary swarming all over the place in the 1940s), in the North, the North of Ireland after the partition which created a two-state solution in Ireland after the deal when down in the 1920s and the 1940s Irish Republican Army (IRA) partisans were left to swing in the wind. Yeah just ask stand-up IRA partisan Johnnie McQueen (although in the film the designation is simply the organization everybody knows what organization), a stand-up guy who did serious time in one His Majestys stinking prisons. Yeah, ask Johnny and the boys whats what when times are tough and dough is tight to fight the fight for a one-state Ireland. A lot of good men, women too, including a quare fellow like Johnny have broken their teeth on that one.

See in hard times, in times when the general population does not give a rats ass about unification (or whatever political program a revolutionary might be espousing) guys like Johnny and the boys have to keep body and soul together, to speak nothing of the organization, by an occasion robbery to refill the coffers. So Johnny and the boys plot and plan (after being given the assignment by that nefarious organization) to rob the local mill where the payroll cash will be a very good start on continuing to keep body and soul together. Naturally with stand-up Johnny as the leader. Stand-up or not though Johnny got ground down by prison, wasn't up to leading this caper and while they grabbed the cash after that everything went to hell in a handbasket. It didn't help that Johnny got caught up in a battle just before the getaway with some bravo who must have thought the dough being taken was personally his and in the melee got killed, got killed dead as it turned out. Johnny took a bullet too, a bullet wound which would drive the rest of the film.

And that tells the tale of the rest of the film as Johnny is thrown pillar to post trying to dodge the coppers and get away, far away, from Belfast and the kings sweet sweated gallows. Capturing the tensions, the mishaps, the poignancy of the streets of the town at night, a night that was filled with forebodings for Johnny, director Carol Reed as he did in The Third Man did a masterful job of cinematography capturing the back alleys and squalor of the wrong side of the tracks is really what drives us on to see what happens.

Well you know Johnny could come to no good end, had to take the fall one way or the other. Here is strange beauty of this plotline though. Johnnys love interest, fellow partisan Kathleen, knowing that her man is going down, is going down hard, on her own makes a private death pact, wants to share Johnnys fate. To insure that common fate as the coppers close in on Johnny Kathleen without flinching draws a pistol from her coat pocket and starts firing. Great noir touch.",1451865600,,3083,4.531418312387792

989000,5,6305186693,"The Criterion issue on 2 discs -- DVD in my case -- is excellent, with a fine print of the movie on Disc One and some very interesting ""special features"" on the second disc.  If you can, you might try to see it in relation to John Ford's ""The Informer,"" also set in Ireland at a time (though a different one) of political trouble.  Reed's 1947 movie owes a good bit stylistically and thematically to Ford's 1935 one.  There are also debts to French and German movies of the 1930's that are addressed in the special features commentary.  The basic similarity is that in both movies, the protagonist, not long out of jail, takes action that causes a death, and one could argue that, different as the circumstances are, in both cases the protagonist causes the death to meet some basic needs of his own and not for any ideological or political reason.  The actions result in both men going on the run, so to speak, and trying to avoid capture, while at the same time being psychologically and maybe ethically disturbed by what they have done.  Stylistic similarities are the representation of the city, especially in nocturnal images, with lots of shadows, deep back-and-white contrast, and a sense of the city as a kind of warren or maze, almost a trap, from which the protagonist tries to escape.  Reed's film, to an even greater extent than Ford's, I think, makes the audience aware of its style -- every shot seems very deliberately framed, and engrossingly, I might add.  However, to the credit of Reed and his actors, the awareness of style doesn't get in the way of the reader's engagements with the characters and their plights.  Sometimes, it's desperation that draws us in; at others, it's an odd, almost absurd kind of humor.  The ostensible issue that the plot engages us in, again like ""The Informer,"" is a simple one -- can the protagonist get out of the city and away from his pursuers?  But the plot, like that of any good film noir, is just the excuse on which to hang issues of psychological breakup and existential threat.

It's odd, however, that the political dimension of the story is played down.  Johnny McQueen (James Mason) is the head of what in the movie is referred to merely as ""The Organization,"" and nothing in the movie makes it certain that the organization isn't a criminal enterprise as opposed to a political one.  It has usually been taken to refer to the IRA, but there's nothing in the movie about Irish politics and history to warrant that identification.  I wondered if the ""depoliticizing"" of the story was a sop to the British censors -- but there's no way that the organization, whatever it is, is glorified or its violence endorsed.  In fact, Johnny, we learn right from the start, has begun while in prison to have doubts about violence -- it's ironic that he's strapping on his gun around the time that he reveals this to his girl, Kathleen (Kathleen Ryan).  But he doesn't come across as a tough guy -- he's reflective and even sentimental, and that's partly his undoing, and Kathleen's attraction to him has none of the dangerous allure of the bad boy for the tough girl.  Be all that as it may, the absence of politics throws all the interest on the existential aspects of the story and serves to suggest that Johnny's situation has a kind of universal human interest.  His conscience is focused on his having killed, with no attention given to the context of or possible reasons for the killing or the robbery that was the occasion of the killing.  The effect is to make Johnny's consciousness seem almost inhumanly ""pure"" -- or, if you're historically minded, implausibly limited.  For myself, that's where I have to suspend my disbelief where this movie is concerned.  Once you start thinking about the complex history that lies behind an event like the robbery in the context ( a divided Ireland, c. 1940), the film can lose its purchase on you and seem oversimple.  If you head down that road, all you're left with is style.  But partly as a response to style, I DON'T head down that road, and then my interest in what the style is there to express reawakens.

The oddest feature of the movie is the part where Johnny finds himself in the studio of the artist Lukie (Robert Newton), who wants to paint him.  Lukie is such an extravagant character, and Newton (remember his Long John Silver?) is himself an extravagant actor, that he almost seems to belong to a different kind of movie.  Still, the idea of the artist as the medium required for penetrating the soul of man in extremis has thematic plausibility here, and it's in that scene that Mason delivers HIS most histrionic moment -- a surprise in a movie in which the protagonist, up to that point, hasn't had much to say at all.  And that's another odd feature of the film -- Johnny, once he is wounded, is remarkably passive.  It's not clear that he cares about being saved, though he doesn't want to be found by the police.  Rather, he just seems not to want to be a burden to anybody.  Is he paralyzed by guilt?  Is he weak through loss of blood?  Both, perhaps?  Kathleen wants to save him and is scouring Belfast looking for him, but it's not clear that he wants any more than Kathleen's presence -- and at the end of the day (literally -- the movie is about the events of a single day and ends at midnight), it's not clear that Kathleen wants any more than just to be in Johnny's presence.  The ineffectiveness of Father Tom (W. G. Fay) gives the ending a very different character from the ending of ""The Informer,"" where Gyppo (Victor McGlaglen) ends up in a church asking for forgiveness.  And yet Frankie's mother's absolution of Gyppo (""Sure, you didn't know what you were doin' "") perhaps applies to Johnny too.

Anyway -- if you've read this far! -- good performances all round, not only from Mason but from a stable of good Irish actors including the young Cyril Cusack, Dan O' Herlihy, and W. G. Fay himself.  This was Fay's last movie, for he died in 1947, having been involved forty years earlier with Yeats, Synge, and Lady Gregory in the establishment of the Irish National Theater (later, the Abbey).  Take a look too at the proprietor of the bar.  I thought I recognized him from long ago.  I wondered, was it Peter Cushing?  But no.  He's William Hartnett, who went on to become the original Doctor Who.",1439164800,2,6334,4.592888888888889

Taking place largely over the course of one tense night, Carol Reeds psychological noir, set in an unnamed Belfast, stars James Mason as a revolutionary ex-con leading a robbery that goes horribly wrong. Injured and hunted by the police, he seeks refuge throughout the city, while the woman he loves Kathleen Sullivan [Kathleen Ryan] searches for him among the shadows. Carol Reed and cinematographer Robert Krasker (who would collaborate again on The Third Man) create images of stunning depth for this fierce, spiritual depiction of a mans ultimate confrontation with himself.

FILM FACT: The film's violent ending attracted advance criticism from the censors, and had to be toned down in the finished film. The film received the BAFTA Award for Best British Film in 1948. It was nominated for the Golden Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival in 1947, and nominated for a Best Film Editing Oscar in 1948. Filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly cited Odd Man Out as his favourite film. Roman Polanski feels that Odd Man Out is superior to The Third Man, generally considered to be Carol Reed's masterpiece.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Director Carol Reed is most often hailed as the creative force behind The Third Man [1949], a highly stylised meditation on friendship and post-War morality. Many critics, however, feel that Odd Man Out [1947], which was filmed two years prior to The Third Man, is Reed's real masterpiece. Though just as imaginatively photographed and edited as The Third Man and Odd Man Out is anchored by James Mason's breath-taking performance as a critically wounded I.R.A. agent who encounters both tenderness and betrayal while on the run from the authorities. Viewers who are only familiar with James Mason's later work in such films as Lolita [1962] and Georgy Girl [1966] will be startled by his forcefulness in this role. This is a character, and a film, that you won't soon forget.

The creative combination of James Mason, popular British star, and Carol Reed, the brilliant director of such films as Night Train and The Stars Look Down. Carol Reed chose to adapt F. L. Green's 1945 novel Odd Man Out for its quasi-religious undertones, the opportunity it provided for a number of strong character scenes and for the seriousness with which it dealt with its tragic story of the 'troubles' in Northern Ireland, although in the film, Belfast is not mentioned by name and the IRA referred to only as The Organisation.

Especially, as it is rewarding in its first two-thirds or so, when the galvanic talents of its director are most excitingly demonstrated on the screen. For in this part of the picture, the story and Carol Reed are concerned almost exclusively with a matter that gives his camera its most auspicious range. This is the desperate endeavour of a wounded man to escape the police in the night-shrouded alleys of an Irish city after committing a murder for a political cause.

James Mason is brilliantly cast as the almost mythic anti-hero Johnny McQueen, dominating every scene that he is in. James Mason is introduced in clever fashion by having us first hear his velvety voice, still distinctive with a mild Irish lilt, before we actually see his face. A star of James Mason's stature was required because although his is the central role, Johnny McQueen is on-screen for a comparatively small proportion of the film.

Also, in switching attention from the man-hunt to these cryptic characters, they have rudely relieved the protagonist of the illustrative role. As the fugitive, James Mason gives a terrifying picture of a wounded man, dishevelled, agonized and nauseated, straining valiantly and blindly to escape. But the oblique dramatic construction, as the picture draws toward the end, neglects the responsibility of dramatizing the movements of his mind and clarification of the moral or the sympathy is not achieved by him.

The narrative consists of a series of practically self-contained scenes, such as the darkly comic sequences when Dennis [Robert Beatty] is besieged by young kids or when he tries to escape the police by boarding an over-crowded tram. Others are almost Alfred Hitchcock style in their suspense, from the naturalistic, almost matter-of-fact robbery at the beginning, to the later scene in which Granny [Kitty Kirwan] and Kathleen [Kathleen Ryan] try to hide a gun and bandages while the police search their home.

Odd Man Out is shaped like a Greek tragedy, with events developing from a single early mistake. This fatalism finds symbolic echoes throughout, with Johnny breaking his shoelace at the opening and Shell breaking his at the end; the recurring references to time and the Albert clock; the steps where Johnny was shot and where he killed a man; the shots of the Harland and Wolff shipyards which open and close the film.

The film features a dizzying array of fine supporting performances, with Kathleen Ryan is beautiful as the girl, cool, statuesque and stoical, but it is difficult to fathom her thoughts. W.G. Fay, the great Abbey Theatre veteran, is deeply affecting as the priest standing out for the humanity, grace and humour he displays as Father Tom. The latter part of the film is dominated by Shell [F.J. McCormick], who tries to 'sell' Johnny to turn a profit; in an example of scene-stealing that one critic likened to ""grand larceny."" Allowance must be made for specious writing in the performance which Robert Newton gives as the wild-eyed and drunken painter. But Dennis O'Dea is sobering as a constable and Robert Beatty, Kitty Kerwin and many others are as richly and roundly Irish characters.

Odd Man Out [1947] is a feast for the eyes, with Robert Krasker's sumptuous high-contrast photography and Roger Furse and Ralph Binton's production design providing the vivid, realistic and yet clearly very controlled, 'poetic' feel that Carol Reed was striving for and which anticipates his subsequent films, The Fallen Idol [1948] and The Third Man [1949]. Odd Man Out is still a most intriguing and stylistic brilliant film.

It seems, however, that Carol Reed was never completely satisfied with Odd Man Out. Years after its release, while watching the picture with screenwriter Ben Hecht and Carol Reed decided that about 30 seconds of footage needed to be removed from the print. He offered a startled projectionist 100 [pounds sterling] to take a pair of scissors to the offending seconds, but the man wisely refused. Heaven only knows which 30 seconds were really bothering Carol Reed. The film seems to me personally, close to total perfection, and to everyone else who loves this classic film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The films original theatrical 1.37:1 aspect ratio is faithfully rendered in this stunning 1080p encoded transfer and there are no traces of dust and dirt from previous releases that are not here in this awesome beautiful black-and-white transfer that offers strong black levels, delicate whites, and outstanding sharpness. One or two small scratches occur early-on, but most of the film is gorgeous to view aided greatly by consistently applied contrast and outstanding shadow detail.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 1.0 LPCM Audio Mono sound mix is typical of its era with a strong mid-level but limited highs and lows and is again like the print top notch. Dialogue has been excellently recorded and is well balanced with William Alwyns beautiful haunting lovely score and numerous sound effects. In the quieter passages, there is some slight attenuated hiss present, and theres some occasional low noise which can be heard as well.

Special Feature: Template For The Troubles: John Hill on Odd Man Out [2015] [1080p] [16:9] [23:48] In this New interview, conducted for The Criterion Collection in 2014, with British cinema scholar John Hill, author of Cinema and Northern Ireland: Film, Culture and Politics, and delves into this classic Carol Reed film and its depiction of Northern Ireland. Here we find John Hill sitting in The Crown pub in Shoreditch in North London, and he tells us that he feels Odd Man Out was a very important film of its time and was a big budget film for 1947 post war production, especially tackling a very serious subject, especially being also a high profile film. It was also a very important film in portraying Belfast and Northern Ireland at the time. It was also a very important film depicting the Irish troubles and the partitioning between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, especially in 1921. John Hill feels that the novel by F. L. Green was quite good, but the film by director Carol Reed was far superior in bringing out the troubles in Northern Ireland, but very ambivalent in what criminals were trying to do in stealing the money. In doing the film, it was regarded as a masterpiece and is still regarded as a milestone in filmic history, even though films in 1947 were very London centric and also very little location shooting. Carol Reed was not provided with cooperation with the Stormont Assembly, because they could not see the commercial incentive in supporting the production of the film, but Carol Reed took some aerial shots of Belfast and some of the street scenes, but the main bulk of the outside scenes were filmed in Shoreditch in North London, but the interior shots were done at Denham Studios, but the main shots outside of the pub were filmed at The Crown in Shoreditch, but the interior shots of the pub was an actual replica of The Crown pub done at Denham Studios, but you get to see John Hill inside the actual pub The Crown in Shoreditch in North London, and in full glorious colour and we are told dedicated fans of the film Odd Man Out make pilgrimages to the real The Crown pub. We are also informed that the ending of the film is radically different to the novel, where Kathy and Johnny get killed with the gun and there were problems with the Hays Office in America, where Johnny is shown as a suicide, so to placate them, Kathy is shown shooting at the police and the police return the firing of their guns and killing the couple outright. The Unionist in Northern Ireland didn't like the film, as it gave the impression that Northern Ireland was crime ridden. There was also criticism and bemused by lack of local Irish actors, where instead they had lots of British actors, because they had true Irish accents, the American public would not have understood what they were saying and would have had to have subtitles and would not have been a huge success in North America. So all in all, this is a very engaging special feature and John Hill is a very intelligent fascinating person informing us about Odd Man Out and I have only given you're the tip of the iceberg, whereas you will have to view this yourself to hear even more information on the Carol Reed film and well worth viewing this extra.

Special Feature: Postwar Poetry: Carol Reed and Odd Man Out [2015] [1080p] [16:9] [15:44] Made for The Criterion Collection in 2014 by White Dolphine Films, and this new short documentary provides a look at the film Odd Man Out through archival material and interviews with filmmakers, director Carol Reeds collaborators, and critics. Here we get to see several contributors giving their personal views throughout this special feature. The contributors in this special feature are Tony Rayns [Writer & Film Historian]; John Borman [Film Director]; Charles Drazin [Film Historian]; Peter Evans [Film Historian] and Guy Hamilton [Film Director] and they go into great detail about Carol Reed in general, and especially where we find that he made a series of three films, where he cemented his reputation internationally, which his films had a sense of doom and lost love, which came mainly after World War II and all the contributions feel that the film Odd Man Out is their all-time favourite. But most important is that the film was connected with the Rank Film Company, which again was very important, as it had Hollywood potential, plus also very important you had F. Del Guidice who was a very idealistic person about films himself and that also films were a great art, but even more important is that the Rank Film Company loved Carol Reed and encouraged him a lot and gave him great freedom. They all say that the gallery of the actors had equal billing and always good parts, although there is supposed to be some controversy about the actor Robert Newton, who they felt was rather vaguely camp and of surrealist quality style, but a lot of fans of the film like his style of acting. As with most of films, night shooting is a definite no go area, as it is usually very expensive, especially having to use generators, but because Rank films had great faith in Carol Reed, they allowed the night shooting to go ahead. This again is a really special and unique feature, as well as very informative and is well worth viewing, as again you get a lot more information that I have not mentioned on Carol Reed and the film Odd Man Out.

Special Feature: Home, James  James Mason Turns Again To Huddersfield [1972] [408i] [4:3] [53:44] This 1972 documentary, offers an intimate portrait of Huddersfield in England, featuring actor James Mason revisiting his hometown. He also visits key locations from his youth. With this special documentary, it is divided into 7 separate chapters and they are listed as Change of heart; Industry; The People; Upbringing; Old Ways; Sports and Connections. Not only do we get and intimate view of James masons hometown, but we also get contributions from The Huddersfield Choral Society; The Huddersfield Philharmonic; The Colne Valley Male Voice Choir and the Youth Brass Ensemble. A Yorkshire Television Colour Production, Home James follows James Mason as he returns to his childhood home of Huddersfield. During his journey, James Mason explains why Huddersfield holds such a special place in his heart. The film opens with a shot of railway tracks from the front of a moving train. This is followed by a long shot of the train passing through the countryside surrounding Huddersfield. The train enters a tunnel, and we see James mason seated in the carriage, James Mason talks about how he was born and brought up in Huddersfield, but during which time, he had little affection for it. His view has changed due to family ties, and now he has been won over by Huddersfield.

James Mason speaks about the cultural attitude of Huddersfield. People walk through the streets of Huddersfield, and a double-decker bus headed for Holmfirth is in the background. A man clocks in, and James Mason's voice over explains that things evolve slowly in Huddersfield which contributes to the character of the locals. By the river amongst the factories and mills, here James Mason speaks about his love of the factory chimneys and the other parts of the Huddersfield's industrial landscape. He says Huddersfield keeps behind the times, and mill machinery hasn't changed much for one hundred years. Included with this are scenes of mill machinery, cloth and wool making, and factory workers at various machines. This is followed by scenes of Huddersfield and the surrounding countryside.

James Mason stands by a field gate with the countryside behind him. He begins to talk about Huddersfield prior to the Industrial Revolution, during which time it was a farming community. Textile making was a cottage industry where entire families would contribute to the making of the cloth. Now Huddersfield has grown into the heart of the world's textile industry and James Mason's commentary explains that Huddersfield has a village feel. James Mason speaks to camera from the street in an area called Marsh where he was brought up. He points out where a friend of his lives as well as the house where Yorkshire Cricketer Wilfred Rose used to live. Next James Mason speaks from the garden of his childhood home, Croft House. He gives a history of his family while the film cuts to black-and-white stills of his family. The first part of the film ends as children get off the bus and walk along with their instruments. Here, James Mason speaks of the importance of music in Huddersfield.

The second half of the film opens with James Mason walking along the canal bank, past the factories and mills. He suggests that the right way to do things is the old way, and sees rationalisation of industry as the beginning of dehumanisation. The ICI Plant is run by a computer and employs just ten men. Another example of rationalisation is the assembly line like that in the David Brown factory where tractors are made at high speed. James Mason notes that the knowing Huddersfield man will view the acres of unsold ones with a wry smile.

The film then moves onto the subject of sport. Mason says that Huddersfield men are very competitive. There is a man playing golf. James Mason speaks to the camera from a rugby pitch as he gives a history of Rugby League. Archive footage is used during this scene. Locals watch a cricket match and men bowling on a green. Then, standing in a yard, James Mason talks to camera about club fighting. Men play snooker at the Huddersfield Club, and local eccentric, Franklin Broadbed, entertains a group of men with his shoulder stand. There is also footage of people chatting in the bar.

The film returns to the subject of Huddersfield's music groups. Mason lists the different music groups in Huddersfield. This scene includes footage of rehearsals by the Huddersfield Choral Society and the Huddersfield Philharmonic Orchestra. Now standing in the street, James Mason tells the viewer about letters he received while living in California. The letters were from the daughter of early film pioneer Bamforth. She sent him lantern slides as well as postcards. The Bamforth Postcard Publishers was still in existence. The camera zooms in on the building behind Mason, and next is an interior shot of James Mason at the publishers. The camera zooms out to reveal a selection of postcards like the ones sold in Blackpool. Mason then looks through a collection of postcards while playing in the background are songs which were popular during the First World War.

Next James Mason visits two of his old friends from the area, one of whom is Wilfred Makepeace Lunn who makes little bicycles. James Mason looks at his bicycles and chats with him in his house. His second friend is Peter Brook, a local painter whose paintings of Huddersfield landscapes James Mason had his paintings in his own collection while living in California. James Mason is in his studio, and Peter Brook can be seen at work. Then, the two men walk across the moors talking. But the most passionate aspect of life in Huddersfield in their music and it draws together all walks of life and they can muster 6 performing church choirs; 16 registered brass bands; 1 Chamber Music Society; 1 Madrigal Society; 3 Light Opera Societies; 3 Choral Societies; 1 Womans Choir; 3 Male Voice Choir; 1 Youth Orchestra and 2 Symphony Orchestras, and of course we are informed that they have more Concerts than Football games. And now we come to the end of this brilliant documentary in allowing us to see James Mason go back to his birthplace heritage and to have us allow us to enjoy this intimate James Masons journey through his personal insight into Huddersfield and is totally fascinating brilliant documentary and James Mason looked so natural in his presentation and is well worth a view and so pleased The Criterion Collection was able to have it included with this extra.

Special Feature: Collaborative Composition: Scoring Odd Man Out [2015] [1080p] [16:9] [20:38] In this New interview, conducted by The Criterion Collection in 2014 with music scholar Jeff Smith, author pf The Sounds of Commerce analysis about composer William Alwyn and his unusual score for Odd Man Out. Here we get to see the American Jeff Smith being interviewed where he composes on his piano. He tells us that William Alwyn was part of a cohort British Film composers, which came of age in the 1930s and the 1940s and regarded as one of the best composers at the time and was extremely prolific in not only writing music for film, but also for the stage, television, radio and concert music and is best known for the films The History of Mr. Polly, The Winslow Boy, Green For Danger, The Fallen Idol and Odd Man Out. Jeff Smith points out how William Alwyn is good at using his music to great integrated effects in the films, especially in Odd Man Out. We then see Jeff Smith sitting at his piano and explains and plays the 3 principle film scores used in the film, which he also tells us that they a repeated though out the film. One interesting fact we get to hear about is that William Alwyn does a rough recording so that James Mason hears the music so he can interact with the music while being filmed, then when the film has be finished, William Alwyn went back to the recording studio to re-orchestrate the musical score, which Jeff Smith felt that this musical score was his crowning achievement. If you enjoy hearing about how film scores are produced for films, especially for Odd Man Out, then this special feature by Jeff Smith is a must watch, as you learn a lot on what makes William Alwyn was such a brilliant prolific composer and is a definite must watch special.

Special Feature: Suspense, Episode 460 [1952] [1080p] [16:9] [29:22] This radio adaptation of the film Odd Man Out, starring James Mason, Pamela Kellino, and Dan OHerlihy and was originally broadcast on the 11th February, 1952. It was produced and directed by Elliot Lewis. With the Index section, you get listed 5 separate chapters, which are listed as Unbeatable team; Inescapable nightmare; Smooth performance; A desperate state and Saluting the leaders. While you listen to the radio broadcast, you just get a black-and-white image of James Mason from the film. As this was an CBS American radio broadcast, with such a serious drama, it is literally spoilt by all the crass American sponsored advert, which is broadcast at the start of the drama, in the middle of the dram and right at the end of the drama, that is why the BBC is the BEST broadcasting organisation in the world, because we don't have crass adverts spoiling any drama being broadcast to the British public.

BONUS: Death and The City, is an intimate essay by critic Imogen Sara Smith and is a really nice in-depth look at Odd Man Out and you get to read lots of specific information about the Carol Reed film that is not included in any of the special features on the Blu-ray disc. It also gives you and in-depth about the transfer of the film onto the Blu-ray format and also gives you lots of acknowledgements and is a well worth read.

Finally, The Third Man is rightfully considered to be Carol Reed's masterpiece, but there are certain aspects of Odd Man Out that are better. Carol Reeds Odd Man Out is still a magnificent film, gripping in all the best ways and filled with unexpected twists and turns before its final, inevitable tragedy. William Alwyn's score, for instance, may well be one of the very best ever done for this noir film. The Criterion Collection Blu-ray release offers top-notch picture and sound with a host of interesting and unique special features, which are far superior to previous Blu-ray releases. Very Highly Recommended!

989004,5,6305186693,"""Odd Man Out"" (1947) is directed by Carol Reed (Third Man). This film in set in Northern Ireland on one tense night where James Mason's character wanders the dark shadowy corridors of the city after being wounded by a gunshot during a robbery. This British psychological noir film builds up towards an oppressively dark and gloomy atmosphere that seems to envelop James Mason's character in a grip that he can't escape. The film also echoes French poetic realist films (Port of Shadows) as well as German expressionist films (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari). And ""Odd Man Out"" seems to have influenced contemporary film directors, especially someone like Frank Miller (Sin City), as seen in a later scene with the stark lighting, shadows, and falling snow.

In this move we spend the night with Johnny and find out who his friends and not so much friends are as he is seeking a way out of the situation.

The ending not quite the book, due to insistence of U.S. censorship, still works.

One extra plus to the film before it gets started id that it is directed by the well know Carol Reed. Carol Reed was the second son of stage actor, dramatics teacher. Also the director of ""The Third Man"" (1949) and The Fallen Idol (1948).

A lot of the Carol Reed films have gotten the Criterion treatment and Blu-ray. This film is symbolic of a time and has a universal timeless message; that the film should out last different treatments and even us.

James Mason is a good draw. What I is more interesting is that he is supported by many of the popular actors of the time. Three years later Robert Newton was well known for playing Long John Silver in ""Treasure Island"" (1950).

This seemingly simple plot brings together a large cross-section of Irish society, vivid characters who either help or hinder the antihero. There is a fascination in this story, almost hypnotic, that's hard to describe. The dark black-and-white photography, the beautiful music score, and the performances of Mason and the rest of the superb cast combine to create a film experience you won't forget. And it all builds to a surprising--and surprisingly moving--ending.

The Criterion Blu-Ray has been remastered from original elements, and the package includes several extras of the high quality we've come to expect from the Criterion Collection.

It will never leave you.  2 wonderful great actors from the Abby Theatre, who died shortly after this was made, play the Birdman and the Priest. The imagery is worthy of Bergman or Kurosawa. Mason gives a performance of such power that one is amazed at how little he seems to do and yet how deeply he affects us.  A wonderful supporting cast including a very young Dan O'Herlihy. It has been years since a good print was available in this country.  Take note of the clock. We always know the time as the last 12 hours of Johnnys life, tick away. Johnny is unready for the job; we see his senses begin to fail him, even as he leads his men.  The foolish band of robbers who lose him in the midst of their arguing.  He struggles to make the midnight ship to freedom, even as he interacts with people on his painful journey. Some wish to use him. Some wish to help. Others merely want to be rid of him.  Watch the angle of his body as he runs like a wounded bird, against the straight edges of the buildings. The angel in the junk yard, which grows a comic ice nose, as if to comment on the irony of it all.  Shell, the Bird Man, who sees Johnny as a wounded bird, to be rescued. The strangely dispassionate priest, who seems more interested in the afterlife, than the plight of this one.  The weather changing from sun to rain to snow, as if to further comment on the drama.  Robert Newton is the mad artist who sees the afterlife in Johnnys eyes but he cant seem to capture it. His slow agonizing journey like  a doomed messiah, dragging his cross to a certain end.  The window light, which shines briefly then dims, as a metaphor for his own existence.  Finally the lovers, moving slowly against the fence as the boat for their escape is already moving away from them.  The police at the edges of a vast expanse of snowmoving ever closer.  I won't spoil the ending but I have never seen it without tears and I doubt that you will either.  The great clock which has reminded us of the passage of time and life, tolling the end.

989223,5,6305186693,"Filmed in Belfast, Odd Man Out is one of the highlights of UK cinema. Director Carol Reed (THE FALLEN IDOL (1948), THE THIRD MAN (1949)) and cinematographer Robert Krasker (BRIEF ENCOUNTER (1945), THE THIRD MAN) combine talents to brilliantly evoke a noirish, rain swept urban wasteland.  This is important, because not only is the film a suspenseful thriller, but also an allegorical work.

James Mason stars as Johnny McQueen; leader of an under-funded underground Irish organization.  McQueen unwisely undertakes to lead a mill payroll robbery while he is unwell.  He ends up murdering a mill employee while half out of his head, and is himself wounded and ends up cut off from his gang.  The police, Johnny's gang, and Johnny's girlfriend attempt to find him.

The second half of the film explores human interactions; as this weak, semi-delirious individual attempts to get to safety, but continually finds himself in the hands of people who essentially serve their own interests.
Taken simply as a thriller, the film can seem a tad overlong.  That is probably the film's greatest weakness.  Johnny's injuries so enfeeble him; he is nothing more than a tool to illustrate the human nature of those around him.  Some people try to use him to obtain a reward; most memorably, Robert Newton tries to use him in the pursuit of art (!); others have a cold calculating (almost inhuman) sense of justice to exact.  Even Johnny girlfriend's last act can be interpreted in a self-serving manner.

On the one hand, it is a good thriller, tinged with superb atmospheric photography and some Expressionistic flourishes.  On another level, it is an interesting social commentary; a film that says more than ten ordinary movies put together, and succeeds despite its flaws.  I might even like it better than Reed and Krasker's other masterful collaboration THE THIRD MAN.  And that is high praise indeed.

The DVD has no Special Features, and is out of print.  It would be great if Criterion were to release a restored version with all the bells and whistles.",1275782400,3,2049,4.964809384164223

989272,5,6305186693,"Recalling my fondness for James Mason as an actor, I recently bought a DVD of ""The Desert Fox."" Although Mason is as usual excellent in the title role, the film itself seems so dreadfully dated! I then realized that my continued regard for Mason as an actor actually stems from his performance as Johnny McQueen, in Carol Reed's ""Odd Man Out,"" which I first saw as a child (Mason's luminous interpretation of the dying McQueen has cast a glow on my memory of all his performances, including a hypothetical reading of the telephone book!). I can never forget the scene in the artist's garret when, in a moment of recognition, McQueen ""speaks with the tongues of men and of angels.""

""Odd Man Out"" does not disappoint, even after sixty years. It still brings fresh tears to my eyes. How can the film miss with the nuanced direction of Carol Reed, the haunting music of William Alwyn, and the splendid cinematography of Robert Krasker--to say nothing of the actors? Every character--from the urchins on the street to the anonymous passers-by--some who help; others who hinder--is perfect. Kathleen Ryan gives a beautifully understated performance as the woman who will die for McQueen, and Robert Newton is brilliant in the role of Lukey, an artist, whom starvation has driven beyond the point of madness. The actors, who play Lukey's companions-in-misery--Shell, a down-and-outer looking for rewards, and Tober, a ruined medical student, whose Eton accent speaks of better times--are splendid.

As for Mason, ""Odd Man Out"" brought him fame as well as the attention of Hollywood, and a subsequent series of mediocre--albeit entertaining--potboilers, in which his gifted performances simply do not compare to his timeless interpretation of the Irish militant, Johnny McQueen.

989273,4,6305186693,"It definitely reminds me of ""The Third Man"" -only this one in Dublin-, the other Carol Reed classic, this one with the valuable help of Orson Welles.

In Odd Man Out the story is completely different though. I have to admit that it took me some time to appreciate it well. It is slow. It goes in crescendo in emotion and intensity of drama, and suspense as well. But many times it is frustrating because the resolution never takes place, it keeps postponing and postponing, and one has to get irritated at this. But there is a purpose in making it this irritating way: To show all the characters that play around the passive heroe. Very much like what the characters involved in the passion of Christ. So I did the wrong thing by focusing in the heroe and not in the variety of persons that reveal a part of human nature in their interactions with James Mason.

A film that needs a second viewing and a lot of meditating. However, it does not stand at the level of ""The Third Man"", although it tries to shoot even higher.",1167264000,2,1021,4.396825396825397

It starts with quite a realistic set-up, but gradually the Irish rebel, Mason, turns into Everyman: moving through unidentified streets in an unidentified town somewhere in Ireland: a sort of Irish Catholic Pilgrim's Progress. He meets a large number of varied characters on his suffering way towards his ultimate fate. The whole story is somewhat creaky, although well-shot and well-acted in general. It is stagey, and although quite ingenious, still rather mechanical with its serial introduction of one stereotype after another. The message, we must love one another or die, is delivered in a manner which can only be described as heavy-handed. Nevertheless, it is still quite interesting, and although few of the actors are actually Irish, there seems to be quite a good feel for Irish lower-class society of the period. All the performances are enjoyable to watch, and some of the faces and actions of the street-kids give the ambience a patina of authenticity. The ending introduces an element of suspense, as we are at one point led to believe that the outlaw is going to get away. This didn't happen in films of the 1946 era.

Viewers clearly see what they want to see in this film, and what they want to see is something I never saw. For fans of ""The Third Man"" this offers a glimpse of an earlier Reed, using some of the same techniques but without the grace or subtlety of the later masterpiece. But the abundance of characters, the lugubrious pacing, the leaden foreshadowing and the lachrymose plot all add up to a less than satisfying experience. This has to be the oddest role James Mason has ever played; for the last 90 minutes of the film he groans and mumbles and collapses, but does little else, and yet manages to hold our attention. But the cast around him left me cold. When films have the proverbial cast of thousands, it is hard for any of them to be more than stereotypes. I found Robert Newton's painter a silly caricature, a bombastic and over-the-top portrayal of what a movie painter might be like. Kathleen Ryan, whose ravishing looks and stellar makeup certainly bely the supposed poverty, never catches fire. And why does she love Johnny? No idea. The priest, the cops, the drunken driver, the foolish old ladies? All right out of Irish typecasting 101.

Religious strife? Never mentioned. The Organization is not described; anyone seeing this as plunging deep in Belfast's problems is reading something the film left out.

This is a rough draft for one of the great films of all time, The Third Man. It is an entertaining and skilled production, with much to recommend it (see all these glowing reviews.) Worth the time, and certainly different. But not something I'd ever watch again.",1151625600,6,1647,4.692041522491349

Scene after scene is just visually stunning. There are tons of great nighttime city scenes and the DVD transfer is top-notch. Kudos for the job Image did with this. It's a showcase for the best of film noir photography.

The disappointment was the story. It went on too long and introduced a couple of really sappy, annoying characters (a bum and his artist friend). The story had a good premise: a man (James Mason) on the run in the streets of London, with the police trying to catch him and his friends all trying to hide him or bring him to safety. All the while, the man is bleeding to death so time is of the essence. Sounds good, but it turned out to be more a human interest than a crime story, showing how some people were sympathetic to Mason, others were the opposite and some were in the middle.

989327,5,6305186693,"James Mason is extremely effective and sympathetic in his portrayal of Johnny McQueen, an Irish militant in Carol Reed's powerful ""Odd Man Out"", a film surrounding the still existent troubles in Northern Ireland.

Mason, the brains behind the local organization, presumably the IRA, has been ensconced in an apartment shared by Kathleen Ryan and her grandmother.  He had escaped from prison and had been lying low for six months.  While not a proponent of violence, the urbane Mason masterminds a robbery of a local mill to procure funds to support his group's activities.  Ryan, who was in love with him begged Mason not to participate.

During the robbery Mason was severely wounded during a tussle where he shot and killed an employee of the mill.  He was inanely abandoned by his gang near the mill on a snowy winter night.  The bulk of the plot consisted of Mason's desperate struggle to return to the apartment.  Mason was aided, sheltered and protected in his quest by local inhabitants sympathetic to his cause amid a wide reaching manhunt by the local constabulary.  Meanwhile Ryan is scouring the streets in hopes of finding the dying Mason.

This passionate film captures the tenor of the tenous existence of the Northern Irish under the yoke of English rule.

For 12 hours (noon to midnight) he wanders the city, a very wanted man, bleeding to death, seeking the help he desperately needs but never gets.

Everyone he encounters either refuses to help out of fear, or will help but only for their own personal gains. This roll call of ignominy includes an egotistical painter who is only interested in capturing his death on canvas, a priest who is only interested in saving his soul before he dies, a man who will sell him out to the highest bidder, and even the woman who loves him who chooses to die with him than live a life alone.

Mason's big scene where he chastises his fellow man for lack of charity borders on the melodramatic (the camera angle makes him appear like Christ on the cross), but it's a powerful indictment all the same. James Agee doubted that a city at night had ever been better photographed, and he's probably right.

A fund raising bank robbery is planned and bungled, Johnny shoots a man and is seriously wounded himself.  Wounded and stranded, as his cohorts lose him doing the getaway.

  Carol Reed's ODD MAN OUT (1947) takes place in post-war Ireland and is populated with well drawn secondary characters, gorgeous photography, and a decidedly ambivalent attitude toward gang violence in Ireland.  The seriously wounded Johnny crawls into an old bomb shelter.  Unfortunately, balls bounce into and trysts are held in his lair, and the police are conducting a massive manhunt for him.

  With the help of a friend who'd also been searching for him Johnny finally manages to escape and, although desperately weak, makes for the home of his girlfriend Kathleen (Kathleen Ryan).  One of the major threads of this movie is the quest for reunion the two lovers pursue.  There's a farcically burlesque feeling to Johnny's journey.  The weak and dying man is traipsed around through the rain and muck and finally snow like a drugged and dangerous dog, treated with treacherous indifference by any and all.

  There's a lot to like about this movie, and the ending is moving.  The mood is lifted considerably - perhaps too considerably - by the third act antics of Shell (F.J. McCormick), the dim-witted roustabout who stumbles upon the stumbling about Johnny, and Lukey (Robert Newton) going over-the-top as a demented artist.  Reed deftly compliments Mason's fine performance as the progressively weaker Johnny with a few innovative and interesting subjective hallucinogenic scenes.

Shell, an informer, follows Johnny like a conscience until his death - at last - in the snow. The ship on which he hoped to board is seen sailing away beyond the railings of the harbour. The film has almost an embarrassment of fine sequences: the great stage actress (who is little seen in films) Fay Compton plays the London woman who befriends Johnny and slowly discovers his predicament and the bar scene with Robert Newton is hauntingly memorable. The combination of James Mason's superb acting and Carol Reed's inspired technique makes ODD MAN OUT one of the few true masterpieces of the English cinema. If film directing can best be described as a craft, then Reed was indeed a master of his craft!",1025481600,7,1028,4.622950819672131
989335,5,6305186693,"Belfast is a city of two faces.  One city consists of bustling streets and energetic people with ready smiles.  The other was that presented in this gripping film, that which the world media has focused on with increasing attention with the passage of time, the city of conflict where tensions accelerate to the boiling point and explode into violence.
""Odd Man Out"" is a 1947 release which represents Carol Reed's first of three successively acclaimed international masterpieces.  It was followed by ""The Fallen Idol"" with Ralph Richardson and Michelle Morgan and ""The Third Man"" with Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli and the moving appearance in the last thirty minutes by Orson Welles.  James Mason was also greatly assisted career-wise in his sensitive role as a young Nationalist underground leader living the last day of his life in a state of excruciating pain.  Mason had earlier come to prominence in the 1945 release ""The Seventh Veil"" with Ann Todd.  This role completed his momentum swing into the top ranks of international cinema stardom.
""Odd Man Out"" and ""The Third Man"" have been selected as representative of British film noir at its finest.  Reed uses shadows to compelling effect, while Robert Krasker, who would win an Oscar for Cinematography in ""The Third Man,"" handled the camera with equally consummate skill in ""Odd Man Out.""  The Reed-Krasker team present compelling silhouettes of characters who cross the path of Mason, whose face reveals the requisite painful sensitivity as underground gang leader Johnny McQueen.
The film begins with the clock in the main square striking noon and ends at the ring of midnight.  Mason, despite the urgings of his faithful girlfriend Kathleen Ryan and members of his gang, decides to participate in the holdup of a mill, from which the underground group hopes to obtain funds to live and continue pursuing political objectives.
Ryan knows Mason's condition well.  Since his escape from prison he has been confined to the same residence for six months, prompting her to intercede in an effort to let subordinates carry out the job without him, but Mason remains stubbornly in charge.  The robbery is a directive from the very top of the organization and he intends to personally direct it, he emphatically tells a subordinate.
On the ride to the mill a haziness is visible, a clever camera ploy indicating that Mason is subject to blurred vision and potential fainting spells.  The robbery is staged in silence, after which, on the way out, Mason becomes groggy.  While his subordinates wait in the car for him, Mason's delay costs him as a guard surfaces from the street.  In the ensuing confrontation Mason kills his adversary, but is shot in the arm in turn by the dying guard.
The group is able to pull Mason back into their car, but as it negotiates a rapid turn at a nearby corner he falls out.  From that point, to the end of the film, Mason is reduced to wandering.  He walks in rain and snow.  His future is subject to potential barter by local dealmaker Cyril Cusack, who tries to obtain money from the poor parish priest, Father Tom, played by W.G. Fay, in exchange with providing information on Mason's whereabouts.
At one point Mason is taken inside a residence and ministered to by two women.  When the husband of one of the women comes home and learns that they have Mason, then wanted for murder, in their midst, he demands that he be put out into the street.  When he sees the emaciated Mason with his sensitive expression, however, he weakens to the point of giving him a generous shot of whiskey before the dying man staggers back onto the street.
One of the dramatic high points of the film is the stirring performance rendered by Robert Newton, who plays a crazed painter.  When a badly weakened Mason arrives at the local pub the proprietor uses Newton to dispose of the underground political leader wanted for murder.  He knows that if word gets around that he threw Mason back onto the street that he is in for trouble from Mason's loyal followers.  Since the wild Newton had previously caused damage in the pub, the proprietor informs him that he will call the police if he will not get rid of the dying man.  Newton takes him to his flat, where he delightfully begins painting him, longing to create an enduring work of a man in the final throes of death.
Before the film ends the loving Ryan, who does not want to continue her existence on earth without Mason, figures out a way to end his misery and hers at the same time.  When the police, with the omnipresent Cusack and the local priest trailing along, finally reach Mason, Ryan fires a shot, provoking the police to fire back.  Ryan and Mason are both killed instantly.
This is a film that presents struggle and conflict in a city plagued by religious strife through the prism of one man and his last painful day on earth as he interacts with those around him.  These are the shadowy sketches of people reacting to conflict in their quest to endure.  The novel by F.L. Green was brought to the screen with full force fidelity by the novelist and R.C. Sherriff.  It is a film whose message has only broadened with the passage of time and the ongoing efforts to achieve peace in Northern Ireland.  The suffering of Belfastians in their strife was vividly presented with laudable good taste, with the minimum of violence, and the maximum of stirring passion.  It represents a jewel from one of the cinema's true geniuses, Carol Reed, operating at the top of his form.",1016236800,37,5503,4.75

7885197,5,6305186693,"""Odd Man Out"", directed by Carol Reed, is simply the greatest religious allegory and probably the best religious film ever made.  Everyone thinks of the movie as film noir, and it is, but as the plot moves from the initial robbery to the plight of James Mason's dying ""Johnny"", the film takes on deep philosophical overtones.  Religious symbols figure prominently, with the church offering Johnny's last hope for sanctuary.  As Johnny stumbles through his final journey, he obviously becomes a Christ-like figure.  He is rejected by some and exploited by others who crave the reward money for delivering him to the police.  The characters he encounters seem like they are drawn from a Dickens novel--- and here, the movie shares some similarities with David Lynch's ""Elephant Man"".  That may seem a stretch, but both movies are about a central, suffering figure, and his prospects for obtaining mercy in a very dark world.

It really surprises me that this movie isn't featured on religious television networks, and used by clergy as a subject for both sermons and discussions.  I can't think of another movie that treats religious themes as effectively and starkly... with the exception of Dreyer's ""Passion of Joan of Arc"".",1485216000,2,1225,5.059701492537314
