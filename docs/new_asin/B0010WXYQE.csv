3053679,4,B0010WXYQE,"I was really glad to find this.  I watched it right away and was happy, but not impressed.  I would reccomend this because it is neat to see behind the scenes.  I just wish that all the songs were on it, not just some of them.  Otherwise, it is Great.",1222819200,,251,3.96
3053680,3,B0010WXYQE,"I was thrilled to find this DVD on the shelves at my local Wal*Mart, where it was part of a 2-pack exlusive with the full 'Taking Chances' album.

As a video DJ in a local bar, I've had several requests for Celine's version of 'Alone' which is featured on this DVD as in-studio footage. It's a great substitute until she releases a real music video for it (if ever).

However, upon purchasing the product and watching the DVD, I was disappointed to find that only three of the songs featured are presented in full, even though the video of the whole studio sessions has leaked online and is easily accessable with every song in full. It would have been nice to get all of the songs on this DVD in full.

That said, the best quality song on this DVD is 'Alone' which is the studio footage with the full completely mastered audio from the 'Taking Chances' album. The rest are completely unretouched 'live' recordings, where the audio comes off weak and sometimes muffled. This is especially noticable on 'Eyes On Me' (the official seond single).

It's good to have for 'Alone' but unless you're a die hard fan, you can probably skip this DVD. Buy her DVD for 'A New Day...Live In Las Vegas' instead. You won't be disappointed there.",1200873600,8,1230,4.552036199095022
