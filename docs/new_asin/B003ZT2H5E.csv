Her battle to defeat this dreadful disease ... the ups ... the downs ... Joy shares it all!  I was expecting this DVD to be depressing but I found it to be extremely uplifting.  I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1282608000,3,370,4.397058823529412
8410883,5,B003ZT2H5E,"I am Joy's aunt and Joy was living with me when the Diagnosis---each of them---was pronounced.  I am strong and tried to be a virtual mask of that strength when we learned of the second opinion.  But when Joy was told that she did not have Hodgkins Lymphoma, but rather Non-hodgkins, I lost it completely.  For someone who had always solved problems, I was at a loss as to how to solve this one and unschooled as to even how to act around Joy, a problem which I suspect is one that many relatives of a cancer patient face.  But as I watched Joy's reaction to her illness and the strength of character she exhibited in facing her treatment, interacting with her friends, and filming all aspects of her experience going through this ordeal, I found myself drawing courage from her.  This is not a film like 'Bryan's Song'.  This is a film, of course, of ups and downs.  But much more importantly, it is a film of single minded determination and positive thinking which, I believe, was a major factor in her recovery.

I was actively involved in Childrens Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) before  Joy was diagnosed. In fact, Joy once video taped one of the events held at my home.  Imagine the serendipity of then learning of Joy's cancer.

After Joy was cured and she had made her documentary, 'Just One Year', I held another event for cancer patients of CHLA. who were participating in their 'Teen Impact' program.  Joy showed a group of about forty children her film on the wide-screen tv. There was a young man who had bone cancer and he hung back from joining the group.  He was very much sitting on the sidelines.  The kids kept asking Joy to play the film again; this occurred over and over.  When the youth who would not participate observed the enthusiastic response, he slowly moved over to join the others.  I rushed to give him a chair, as there was no more room on the couch or pillows around the floor.  He sat down and watched the film from beginning to end.  His demeanor changed.  After seeing the film, he joined the others in the activities planeed that day for the 'Teen Impact' group.  I don't know if this individual made it or not.  I only know that Joy made his day, that day.

8410884,5,B003ZT2H5E,"Joy bravely exposes the core of her humanity and raw emotions as she battled this disease.  Its the kind of emotion anyone who has had to overcome any hurdle - big or small - can related to.  What makes the film so inspiring is her willingness to be open and honest, sharing the doubts but relentless in hope.  It's a true example of hope overcoming fear, and Joy is a living breathing example of this.  Thanks so much for capturing all those moments and for bringing us through it with you!",1287619200,,491,4.362637362637362
8410885,5,B003ZT2H5E,"Having lost one family member to cancer a year ago and another in remission, this movie has proven very, very special to me and my family...we laughed and cried right along with Joy and her wonderful family and friends...it was as though we were there with her. We thank you Joy and wish you all the best and hope some day that perhaps we too can swim with the Dolphins.",1284508800,,370,4.3

It allows you to laugh, cry, and be filled with an enormous sense of hope and determination.  I would highly recommend anyone who is struggling with cancer or anyone that has a loved one that is fighting this disease to watch Just One Year.

8410887,5,B003ZT2H5E,"What an outstanding diary of a most compelling battle journey!  This documentary depicts the courageous trek of a very young and beautiful woman who summoned in her every ounce of strength to fight this cursed disease called cancer. The highs and lows of her experiences were so poignant and compelling.  The scenes captured throughout the movie allowed the viewer to comprehend the challenges of fighting this awful disease while simultaneously elevating hope in one's heart that victory can be achieved! Indeed, a joyous victory prevailed!

Birthed from Joy's personal experience is the necessary inspiration every cancer patient needs to capture as they move along in their respective battles.  I highly recommend this movie, not just for cancer patients but also for their caretakers who need to grasp the intricacies, nuances, and complications concerning this journey. Come to think of it, this is a movie for everyone who needs to rise above a challenge because it underscores what it means to endeavor difficulties and thereafter, prevail triumphantly.

Do you have someone who needs hope?  Then let Joy's angelic presence inspire them towards a productive outlook in life!  This is a repeated ""must see!""",1284422400,,1213,5.286458333333333
8410888,5,B003ZT2H5E,"This is an amazing story about a young woman, Joy, who is fighting for her life after being diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is an amazing story of hope, inspiration and the power of friendship....that ends with a HAPPY ending!! It is a MUST SEE for anyone fighting the disease...(or if you know someone who is battling cancer).",1284163200,,337,4.827586206896552
8410889,5,B003ZT2H5E,"Just watched this video about Joy's battle with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma and it was an amazing story.  She shares a window into her life from the first moment of diagnosis all the way through her battle.  It also helped me to understand the process better and what you can come to expect when going through this battle.  The roller coaster of emotion and the importance of being positive shine throughout this video.  I encourage you to purchase this documentary and share it with friends, family, or even donate it to your local library or hospital library.  It's a video you'll remember about an amaizing woman and her fight.",1282867200,2,625,4.75
8410890,5,B003ZT2H5E,"Just One Year--- is a documentry about Joy's one year journey with a very aggressive cancer.... Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  As a film student, Joy used her video camera to capture her experience with cancer.  She films her friends and family and then films herself.  When Joy hand held the camera and filmed herself, she would talk and cry, laugh and chant encouraging words to herself.  When she started to lose her hair, you get to be there with her as her brother shaved her long locks of hair as she watched in the mirror crying. I hope doctors and nurses and anyone else in the oncology world watches this DVD so they can truly understand the up and down emotional rollercoaster that cancer does cause on it's victims.  Joy did all the editing and filming. The documentry is long enough to tell her story without dragging on with filler information.  It's raw. It's pure. It's amazing.  What a brave woman she is. My husband had the same cancer as Joy and he loved this film. He felt that it told his story and he could relate to all that Joy went through.  Thank you Joy Clausen for your gift you have given to the cancer community.",1282780800,3,1135,4.475728155339806
8410891,5,B003ZT2H5E,"I recently purchased the documentary, Just One Year, because my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer. I wanted to be able to share with my grandmother a story of survival. My grandmother's spirits were lifted as we watched Joy fight her cancer and win the battle. Watching the highs and lows that Joy experienced gave us a realistic expectation of what my grandma is sure to face. As mentioned in the documentary, cancer is a battle that is fought 70% mentally and 30% physically. I am so grateful that I was able to inspire my grandmother by sharing this with her. Just One Year is a beautifully crafted, wonderfully inspiring, and a courageous documentary by Joy Clausen. I recommend that YOU purchase this documentary and share it with someone special. Thank you, Joy, for sharing it with the world. :)",1282780800,4,806,4.805755395683454
8410892,5,B003ZT2H5E,"Cancer is a devastating disease.  ""Just One Year"" shows us that it does not have to ruin our lives.  This award winning documentary is an uplifting reminder that even when the odds don't seem to favor us the fight is not over.  Joy puts a human face to the disease.  We cry alongside her when her hair falls out and we laugh when her friends ""play doctor"". This inspirational movie is ideal for people who have recently been diagnosed and provides comfort not only for those who are facing this life-threatening disease but their friends and family as well.",1282608000,3,557,4.595959595959596
