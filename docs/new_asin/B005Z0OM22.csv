4906498,4,B005Z0OM22,"The book and accompanying DVD's are clearly written and easy to understand.  They are more like a course than a traditional book.  Mr. Sellers takes you through a course of study that begins with trees, includes tools and sharpening, and then proceeds to woodworking projects of increasing difficulty.",1362528000,5,301,5.25
4906499,4,B005Z0OM22,"Full stop, this is a great series that has seriously helped me to improve my woodworking skills.  5 Stars across the board with one exception, which dropped it to 5 stars.  When you click on a chapter or sub-chapter lesson there is a jolting, annoying and time-consuming digital graphic display with music that will make you think you're watching the Bourne Identity.  Even with this minor irritation, which get's comical after awhile, well worth the money.",1361577600,4,457,4.9868421052631575
4906500,5,B005Z0OM22,I am very pleased with the quick service i received.  It arrived within weeks of ordering.  Since it was a christmas present I had plenty of time to wrap it.  My husband is very happy with the whole set.,1357084800,,203,4.153846153846154
4906501,5,B005Z0OM22,"I Received the working wood series about two weeks ago. Since then I've read the book and watched all seven dvd's. This is an incredible product! I'm very excited about following every lesson in the course, as presented. The production values are extremely high. Some have complained that it's over produced. I disagree. I really enjoy how the teaching is blended with scenes from inside Penryn Castle. I've never seen the inside of a castle before. I had no idea that the decor would feature such incredible woodworking craftsmanship. These views are totally appropriate and work very well with the subject matter. I'm also surprised at how Paul managed to boil down the program to 10 essential tools and 3 joints. I'm very happy with the program. I think it offers excellent value for the money. As a beginner, I feel that this offers a comprehensive start to what I anticipate to be a very enjoyable new hobby.",1356825600,3,913,4.784810126582278

4906503,2,B005Z0OM22,"I have been following Paul Sellers' blog for a while now. I have great respect for his work and approach to the craft of woodworking. I've learned several good things from his short videos that are accessed on his web site. So I ordered this book and 7-DVD set with high hopes that the series would go much further than what is found on the blog. I was somewhat disappointed to discover, however, that the DVD series presents Paul's lessons in the strangest format I have ever seen in any video production. Every short lesson is preceeded by a LOOONG and very strange ""high tech"" introduction, with weird special effects and beeps and whistles and other sounds that could have come straight from Star Wars... all VERY jarring, especially if you've come to expect the gentle folksy presentations that are the typical accompaniment to DVDs from Lie Nielsen and other ""big name"" woodworkers. Not sure what the producers were thinking when they did this, because Paul does hand tool work in a beautiful old castle, and it seems like peaceful music and a calm presentation would have been much better. I also found that one of the DVDs (out of the two I watched) didn't play properly on my DVD player. It did play, but I had to navigate every few minutes through the menu to get to the next section of the DVD presentation. In addition to these DVD formatting issues, I finally had to admit that there just wasn't a whole lot more to the series than I was already getting online, which was a bitter pill to swallow, since it cost me $150 to make that discovery. After watching two of the DVDs, I finally gave up on the series and ended up re-selling it on Amazon (for a $60 loss). I guess I will philosophically call that sixty bucks my payment for what I have learned through the blog videos. Those who are considering the purchase of this set should give it a lot of thought first. Personally, I would not have bought it if I had known about these issues, AND that I could not return it if I was not happy with it.",1354233600,51,2011,4.452574525745257
4906504,5,B005Z0OM22,"Totally went out on a limb when I bought this course and wasn't let down a bit. Once you get over the music intermissions your in for a treat. Paul sellers is a very awesome instructor. He knows his stuff, been doing it for over forty years and is still passionate about it. Which makes it very fun to watch and also inspirational.

4906505,3,B005Z0OM22,"Paul Sellers is great--a real master and good teacher. Problem is the videos are way over-produced, making it rather frustrating to watch. I wish there were less special effects and more Paul Sellers teaching. It's not quite as bad as you go through the later videos, but the first couple are tough. I'd buy it again, though, as the content is really helpful for an amateur like me.",1352505600,12,382,4.632352941176471
4906506,5,B005Z0OM22,"I received this as a Christmas present from my wife (Well, I bought it and she wrapped it).  I made the purchase on faith as the price was high, and the course was new with few reviews online.  I have watched all the videos and feel familiar enough to give an informed review.

First, the production values are superb, better than any other woodworking videos I own.  (Including those by Taunton and Lie-Nielsen, and I find those to be of high quality.)  Lighting and sound are both excellent.  That said, the non-instructional parts of the DVDs are over-produced.  The transitions are something out of reality TV quiz show, and the intros are melodramatic for a woodworking course.  I got used to them after a while, but they still occasionally produce a sense of bemusement at how over-the-top they are.

As a side note, these videos work on the computer or DVD player, but I wanted to put them on the iPhone so I could watch them in the shop and elsewhere.  No problem ripping these, thank goodness, if that's what you'd like to do.

Second, Paul Sellers personality really comes through as you watch.  His love of the craft is evident.  He is comfortable as a teacher, and has honed his woodworking curriculum over many years of teaching.  It shows in the logical progression on the lessons and in the confident way he demonstrates each step.  After watching him make the first project, a wooden spatula (I would call it a ""batter stirrer""), he made it look so fun I couldn't wait to get down to the workshop.  However, he also made it look so easy I thought about skipping the project as something beneath my skill level.  After making the spatula, and having it look like my dog gnawed it out of a stick, I re-watched the videos, think I better understand some of the finer points of technique now, and can't wait to get to the workshop to try it again.

At first, I thought it was strange to carve a spatula as an introduction to working wood.  Most books talk about truing and squaring boards as a first step.  But now it seems like genius.  Boards need to be perfect; a shaped spatula just needs to be smooth.  It is a much more forgiving way to begin, because the angles aren't all that important.  I assume this a method from Sellers' apprenticeship, and represents a nearly lost way of teaching the craft.

Third, this is the first of a larger set of of instructional videos, and can be thought of as a video apprenticeship or mentorship.  It is not a one-off technique video to be incorporated into your existing routine.  Of course, you can always pick and choose what you do.  (For example, Frank Klausz has a quicker and less fussy dovetailing system.)  As a hand-tool woodworker learning on his own, I really enjoy having a complete woodworking system and philosophy you can learning by watching and doing.  The other woodworking videos I own suddenly seem like fun frolics, while this seems like a foundation for a lifetime of woodworking with hand tools.

If you're a Normite, this may not be your cup of tea.  Devotees of Christopher Schwarz will probably love it.  I can't wait for the next sets in the series to come out, but in the meantime I'll probably keep plenty busy trying to perfect these techniques in the shop.

Update March 2013:  I came back to see if Volume 3 in this series had come out yet and I saw some poor reviews based solely on the over-produced segment transitions.  I find this remarkable.  It's like saying you won't eat Easter M&Ms because you're put off by the pastel colors.  Who cares?!  They still taste the same.  And what's the flip side?  Many woodworking videos, even some from well-known companies, look like they contracted out camera, lighting, and editing work to local Boy Scouts doing a first project for their Video Production merit badges.  This set of videos sets the bar very high for technical production.  I'll take slick over sorry any day.  Bottom line: These Paul Sellers videos are filled with some of the best woodworking hand-tool instruction you can buy.

Update March 2014:  It seems like there will not be another set of these videos coming out.  Sellers now has a subscription service through his website.  The videos are toned down and of the same high quality as these.  I still think this set is an excellent buy, since the techniques are the same as shown in the online projects, and that one costs $15 per month.",1326326400,43,4394,4.60180412371134
4906507,5,B005Z0OM22,these dvds are really easy to follow and learn from and paul is very good at explaining how to do things.

4906513,4,B005Z0OM22,"Like many of the reviewers I found the spinning graphics and slasher movie music annoying.  Once into the actual project the methods used are well presented.  Things like using a hand plane to round and taper square stock for stool legs or using a chisel for both rough cutting and very precise work.  Really changed my outlook on the versatility of simple hand tools.

Could be better with an improved cut list and list of tools needed for each project at the beginning of each project in the book.  Also would have liked some finish methods presented but, I guess that will be in a future course.",1384300800,4,598,4.5514018691588785

4906517,5,B005Z0OM22,"Some discourage a hand-tool approach for new woodworkers, but this technique and project-based DVD course series gave me the knowledge and confidence to start woodworking by hand without frustration. In a very relaxed and sensitive manner, Paul Sellers introduces and emphasizes fundamental skills and concepts in great detail throughout his comprehensive course. No prior knowledge or experience is assumed. The fundamental skills introduced in the early DVDs are demonstrated repeatedly in the later project DVDs. The depth of the instructional detail is impressive (if not unique), and Seller's somewhat philosophic approach to the craft is inspiring. He advocates a ""minimalist"" set of hand tools and maximizes the use of each. In the series he teaches three basic joints, but also includes other techniques like plowing grooves, cutting dados, planing round overs, scraping, and shaping with a gouge. He often shows alternative ways of doing tasks, often without the use of specialized tools. Sellers most often uses good yet relatively affordable vintage tools, and shows you how to tune and sharpen those tools to achieve great results.

Despite all the overproduced menus, random cut-aways while Paul is talking, and odd cyborg-meets-reality-show style transitions (whomever produced the DVD menus and interstitials should be fired), the video of the DVD series is very well shot. The video is always focused and well lit, with ample camera angles, and there are some incredible (and artistic) macro-style closeups of the handwork. I never felt that I was unable to see something clearly enough. 3D illustrations are also used to effectively clarify the concepts and/or process being demonstrated.

Although all of the fundamental techniques are well presented in the first two ""Essentials"" DVDs, the second volume of DVDs largely show those fundamental techniques in practice. These project DVDs serve as great examples of hand tool layout, construction, and execution. Just because a new woodworker has learned some isolated skills does not mean that they know how to tackle a project. Paul Sellers shows you how.

The ""Master Sharpening"" DVD should really be one of the ""essential"" DVDs since sharpening is among the most important of woodworking skills. Sellers will have you sharpening chisels, gouges, irons, saws, auger bits, and scrapers with a simplified approach. I adopted his quick chisel/iron/gouge sharpening method and have had great results. I no longer avoid or resent the sharpening process, and I will never go back to using waterstones or the use of honing guides.

His ""European Workbench"" DVD will bring you through the steps to make your own solid workbench for relatively little money using box store lumber. I already had a workbench, but I built a 3/4 scale version of his workbench to act as a dedicated sharpening station. I had a jointer/planer to help me out with the boards, but the glue-up process and cutting mortice and tenons by hand was not terribly difficult. Each joint was completed in less and less time than the one before. Please note that Sellers also has a different construction video of the same bench design available online for free.

Sellers mostly teaches with prepared stock that has been machine jointed and pre-thicknessed, so the DVDs do not cover flattening boards from rough stock (a fundamental hand tool skill).  During the series, he often saws stock to final dimensions, joints sawn edges square and smooths the faces to remove machine marks or minor warping. Using machines for rough dimensioning simplifies the curriculum, reduces the number of hand planes needed, and eliminates a good amount of effort and tedium traditionally associated with hand-tool woodworking. There will always be the occasional wide board or panel that will require flattening, and Sellers now offers some free online videos that show you how he prepares stock from a rough board.

The course is comprehensive, but there are some more advanced aspects of woodworking that are simply not included, like cabinet (carcass/frame & panel) and chest/drawer construction. More specialized areas of woodworking such as Mouldings, Lathe work, Veneering, Steam Bending, Marquetry, and Carving are also not part of this course. Finishing is an area that is largely glossed over (no pun intended), but really should have had its own dedicated DVD.

The 300+ page book is well published, sizable with plenty of photographs, but I found it to be little more than a well organized review of the information presented in the DVDs. I often re-watch the videos to review details, but the book can serve as a quick refresher of the basic steps.

Sellers has since opened up two woodworking instructional schools in the UK and the US, and offers many free and subscription based online instructional videos on a web site as well. Much of his material online is part of the same core learning found on the DVDs, so people may find some redundancy if they have access to both. As of April 2013, the DVD set is probably a bit more comprehensive in content, but the online library (and forum community) continues to grow.",1366156800,14,5143,5.179302045728038

8489370,2,B005Z0OM22,"Because Paul Sellers' YouTube posts have been so delightful and helpful in the past, I am absolutely torn in two directions over how to proceed with this review.  Paul is knowledgeable, engaging, and clear in presenting the topic matter.  But at the start of, between, and after sections of the DVDs, I feel that I am being assaulted.  Loud aggressive music, dizzying computer graphics, and rapid-fire photo-montages make me want to smash my screen and speakers.  It's like an idiot teenage or twenty-something gamer was commissioned to create the lead-ins and transitions: the resulting production is jarring and disturbing.  I was filled with joy when I opened the package this (Christmas) morning, having forgotten the admonitions of some other reviewers, whose critiques I dismissed as overly picky.  But earlier this evening when I popped disc one into my computer, reality set in.  I cannot watch this.  Most television commercials for shoot-'em-up Call of Duty series games are soothing compared to this series.  It may even cause seizures in some.  I took up hand woodworking to relax.  I cannot relax watching this mess.  My apologies, Paul.  I respect your work and your teaching and find your presentation manner downright likeable, but this is a mess and I just cannot watch another minute of it - I am not willing to suffer for my art, as the phrase goes.",1451001600,13,1368,4.973568281938326
