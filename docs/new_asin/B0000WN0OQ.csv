1958103,4,B0000WN0OQ,"My two year old son loves Maisy, and I actually enjoy watching it too.  I think Maisy is great for toddlers and definitely educational.  I pop this in on road trips and my son stays nice and quiet.  My husband and I sing along with some of the catchy songs too.",1167782400,,261,4.078431372549019
1958104,5,B0000WN0OQ,"My 19 month old daughter LOVES Maisy mouse.  We have watched the Maisy TV show on Noggin, so I wasn't sure if I wanted to get a DVD, too.  I'm so glad that I did!  The Good Night Maisy DVD has 3 episodes: Maisy's Springtime (31 minutes), Maisy's Winter Fun (31 minutes), and Maisy's Bedtime (37 minutes).  Each episode is broken into smaller 5 minute long segments that focus on a word or theme.  (These are the same as what you would see on the TV show).  Between the 5 minute segments are songs, with Maisy and her friends dancing, etc.  The songs are NOT shown on the TV show, and my daughter loves them.

I do wish that the DVD had come with a guide, telling you which segments are on each episode.  It's tricky to find them when your child wants to see a particular segment.  After spending several frustrating minutes trying to find the segment where a cat has kittens, I decided to go through and write down what exactly was on each episode.  To save some of you from similar frustration, the 5 minute segments in each episode are the following.

Maisy's Springtime: Eggs, Nest, Farm, Rabbit, Meow.

Maisy's Winter Fun: Christmas Tree, Christmas, Snow, Gingerbread, Cards.

Maisy's Bedtime: Bedtime, Bat, Camping, Bath, Picnic, Dog.",1151971200,54,1239,4.598173515981735
1958105,5,B0000WN0OQ,"I have almost every Baby Einstein DVD out there.  My Son has been watching since he was 6 months old.  Now that he is 16+ months, he is getting a bit bored.  So I needed a transition...  After reading many review, I bought Good Night Maisy and now my Son asks for it by name.  We watch it before he goes to bed to get him to settle down and relax a bit.  Great colors, great music, nothing over stimulating.  We now have all 3 DVDs and are very happy.",1144108800,,451,3.9444444444444446
1958106,5,B0000WN0OQ,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this DVD.  There's a lot here to watch, so we usually just show one episode, then he begs to see more. There are three episodes with the usual short stories around a main theme. My son's favorite is the Goodnight Maisy- with the bedtime routines and night time stories, but there are also Spring time and Winter episodes that are equally as cute.  The stories are interspersed with catchy songs.  A great DVD to take along on a trip or leave with the babysitter.",1141776000,,486,4.377777777777778
1958107,4,B0000WN0OQ,"These DVD's are well worth the money.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because of the hideous trailers at the beginning.  Otherwise, the songs and sweet stories are enjoyable for both of us.  My favorite thing about Maisy is that the characters are genuinely nice...not interested in tricking or fooling their friends, like in some other toddler programs (if you watch the puppets in the Baby Einstein series you'll see what I mean).
The ska-reggae type music is the least annoying and my Daughter loves it.  Lots of simple educational aspects...counting, colors and shapes.  Word of warning!!!  My Daughter would watch Maisy and her adventures for hours if I would let her.  She gets 30 minutes in the morning and 30 at night of total TV.  Of which Maisy is striving for total market share.
Yeah for Maisy!!!!",1085702400,22,820,4.76595744680851
1958108,3,B0000WN0OQ,"This is a typical kids video.  In other words, if your child likes Maisy, he/she will like this video.  There are 3 episodes included on this DVD, you have the option of watching them individually or all 3 back to back (to back).
There is one annoying feature that I think needs to be mentioned.  Before you get to the main menu there are several minutes worth of previews included.  The bad part is that you can't skip, pause, or stop the video at that point.  Your only option is to fast forward through all the previews.  You then get to the main menu.  This gets my vote for the most annoying feature ever on a dvd.  I hope that this does not become a commonplace feature on dvds.",1082332800,15,684,4.248062015503876
1958109,5,B0000WN0OQ,Book arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  It will accompany a hand-made Maisy quilt as a birthday gift for a two-year-old girl.  Thank you!!!,1363219200,,150,5.208333333333333
1958110,1,B0000WN0OQ,"Sound is bad has a clicking in background.
Not sure if this was used but wasn't sold that way. Not happy.",1356220800,,105,4.0476190476190474
1958111,5,B0000WN0OQ,"My 2-year-old just loves Maisy and all her friends. She wants to watch the DVDs over and over! I like these DVDs because they are perfect for the very young audience: basic concepts like colors & shapes, simple presentations, teaches values & manners, and NOTHING scary whatsoever that might cause nightmares (which is very important to us)!!",1262304000,,342,5.017543859649122
1958112,4,B0000WN0OQ,"THis is a gentle video series with some nice songs.  My daughter and sons have loved it.

OK, one problem.  Something about the way the alligator is drawn against certain backgrounds occasionally make his teeth look like they are covered in red.  A little accidental gory image for a nice kids video.  Fortunately, he is a minor character in few of the shows.",1216080000,,359,4.634920634920635
1958113,5,B0000WN0OQ,"We couldn't figure out if Maisy was a female or male. Regardless, my daughter LOVES Maisy and all the character friends. CUTE for pre-schoolers and younger children.",1195171200,,165,5.148148148148148
1958114,5,B0000WN0OQ,"I am German and my husband is American. Since we live in Germany we needed something to improve our daughters (2 years) English and since she loves Maisy we got this DVD. The voice of the narrator is very pleasant, the stories are funny and entertaining. Our daughter gets scared really easy (we got her a Baby Einstein - the one with the farm animals and she refuses to watch it because of the real life cows), but Maisy is absolutely save. Nothing bad happens, nobody gets hurt, little problems get solved right away - just the right thing for a toddler. Even so we watch two or three of the little episodes every night with our little girl, my husband and me are not tired of it yet. If you have a Maisy fan in your house this is a must have!
Like all the other customers we also hate the fact that you have to fast forward the commercial at the beginning and I was thinking about deducting a star because of it. But the Maisy part of the DVD is wonderful so we did not.",1187568000,2,973,4.180851063829787
1958115,2,B0000WN0OQ,"We like the ""Maisy"" books -- good, simple, colorful stories, not a lot of intellectual heft.  But good golly, these animated shorts are just terrible!!!  The narrator sounds completely bored (and secretly contemptuous of the material) and the character voices consist mainly of moronic giggle-babbles that sound a lot like the TeleTubbies.  It's really insulting to the intelligence of even the youngest viewers.  Plus, the age group that this is suited to developmentally (one-year olds) shouldn't be watching videos anyway: recent studies suggest that watching TV -- any kind of TV -- in the first two years of life holds back language development and shortens attention span.  This video is not worth the risk. (Axton)",1186444800,,721,5.234782608695652

Quite disappointed with the buy. I bought all 3 disc - good morning maisy, good night maisy & play time maisy. All 3 quality are the same.",1419465600,,310,4.183333333333334

8004168,5,B0000WN0OQ,"My grandson loves Maisy. There was a time when the Maisy show was one daily and we would record it for him. It is no longer on and we only have four shows remaining. Every time he's here, he wants to jump up on our bed and watch Maisy Mouse. We needed something to watch in the car so this DVD came in handy and expanded our library a little. The animation is so simple; it almost seems like it was drawn by a child. The ""sets"" are uncluttered and the action stays on the characters. My wife and I visited the zoo recently and she decided to get some stuffed animals for the guest room when he comes to stay. One was an elephant. As soon as he saw the elephant, he cried out, ""Eddie!"" (If you watch Maisy, you'll understand.) This DVD has some good programs on it. Recommended.",1385337600,,777,4.152317880794702
8004169,5,B0000WN0OQ,My grandchildren love it and watch it over and over again. They leave it at my house so they don't watch it so much at home that they get tired of it.,1384560000,,150,3.71875
