8180683,5,B000NQQ4OM,"I am absolutely in awe of the stories and real live footage straight from the veterans at Iwo Jima. WWII has affected each and every one of us in some way, whether we know it or not. And this DVD tells the stories straight from the Veterans themselves. Iwo Jima: 50 Years of Memories is a priceless historical video that should be watched by all ages for preservation of history. This DVD will increase anyone's perception of history and appreciation for the sacrifices these veterans have made for us.
Oral history is an integral part of passing on history. Through the Veteran's own words I have gained a greater appreciation and understanding of the events that took place on Iwo Jima. Many historians spend their whole life's work interviewing numerous veterans to gain a better understanding of different battles and wars. However, through this DVD I now own a piece of history! This DVD captures and preserves history. The result is a fuller appreciation and understanding of the events and experiences that constitute the history and heritage of our great nation. I absolutely recommend that each and every person buy this DVD.",1184716800,20,1134,4.911458333333333
