Did the US Government acquire technology of extra-terrestrial origin and use it to seed American Industry, resulting in a rapid pace of technological change and a world technologically dominated and unable to cope?

Did the US government decide to get acquired alien technology into American industry ""the only place it could be safe""?

Is the governments priority ""To maintain military and economic supremacy, and keep the secrets of alien technology that created its power""?

Were the following ""inventions"" actually developed by reverse engineering alien technologies?

- The development of the transistor in 1947 to replace the vacuum tube
- Jack Quilby credited with invention of microchip in 1958
- Laser developed in 1958. No one inventor of this technology. Suspicious?
- The Drake Equation for intelligent life in our galaxy
- Via the media we are already aware of the possibility of alien lifeforms
- The 1938 'War of the Worlds' radio broadcast caused widespread panic
- Government distortion, disinformation, and a committment to ignorance.
- Secretary of Defense James Forrestal commited suicide in 1949. Why?
- Cobol was developed by the Navy in 1957 to control the power grid. Why?
- Are we in a technological crisis? Is technology taking control?
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Satellites; Weather Prediction; The Hubble Space Telescope; The Internet and eCommerce
- Fibre Optics have been manufactured and sold to the public with no question as to its origins. ""A million years of evolution overnight. How did this happen?""

The DVD runs for 47 minutes and is hosted by Stacy Keach. It is narrated by Hillary Huber in a somewhat wearisome monotone.

Nothing particularly special but good quality production values. Buy this if you are interested in UFO's and aliens and want to learn more. It's one of the cheaper DVD's available. I've given it an extra star just for discussing the possibility that some of our current technology might have come from our extraterrestrial friends.",1234742400,,2558,5.182038834951456
