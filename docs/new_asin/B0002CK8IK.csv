2076298,2,B0002CK8IK,"I'm very dissapointed in how much I paid for this product.  They don't really teach you how to sound out letters.  It's more of a review if you already know the sounds.  My four year old watches the Leap Letter factory over and over. He didn't even make it through 20 minutes of this one.  The music sounds like a child choir, and doesn't sound varied.  Each of the 3 levels are the same, slightly different concepts.  No new idieas with new concepts.  I'd say this DVD is worth about $10 not $30.  if you want a couple good videos, go with Leap Letter and Leap Word factory.  THEY are outstanding and less expensive.  Only $9.99 at Target. My boys (4 and 6) can't get enough of the Leap Frog series.",1106179200,90,700,4.2748091603053435

8026083,1,B0002CK8IK,It is completely not worth your time or money.  The people that wrote the positive articles are lying - I don't know why.,1212624000,2,121,4.260869565217392
8026084,1,B0002CK8IK,"What a disappointment - this video teaches nothing;  it moves too fast;  it's ""extras"" are a rehash of the songs and a non-existent game (it has 4 - that's right, 4 - words for the kids to spell.  Over and over); and it wasn't interesting enough to engage my son for more than a few minutes.  Don't waste your money.  Try Leap Frog or Word World instead.",1210377600,3,354,4.223880597014926
8026085,5,B0002CK8IK,"This really helps children to read and it has a catchy song that goes with it that kids love to sing.  It is very educational and i am glad i bought it.  Also, all leap frog learning products are great , too.  Very satisfied with purchase, well worth it's money in gold. 5 star*****",1200096000,2,282,4.185185185185185
8026086,5,B0002CK8IK,My kids (now teenagers) were all strong readers before starting school and Sound it Out Land was the first step in the process. The tunes are catchy and easy to learn for you and the kids. These are perfect songs for a parent or grandparent to sing together with the kids. You'll have some fond memories of these songs and the time you spent singing them when those little ones are grown.,1182556800,3,388,4.402777777777778

8026088,4,B0002CK8IK,"This DVD it is working so far very good for my child. He was having some trouble with phonics and Sounding the words. I feel that the price may be a little to high and would be nice if will have more words, but I think it is a good way to start Phonics and Reading. The songs are a good way to encourage learning while having fun, and I love the part that sings ""I can read"" making a great encouraging and positive motivation on him. So, You should never underestimate the learning of your child, my son is five and he likes to watch the 3 levels over and over.",1139270400,5,561,4.017857142857143
8026089,5,B0002CK8IK,"I have two children.  A five year old and a four year old.  The four year old has been Dx with a speech apraxia (among other things) and I must say this DVD has really helped out.  It helps him understand the phonics concept.  I also bought all the leap frog phonics DVD's and they are helpful too.  I think my children have learned a lot from this one because the animation is SO simple.  That simplicity allows the children to focus on the task at hand (learning how to put the letter sounds together to form words) without much distraction.  The DVD does a great job putting together the basic laws of phonics.  I suggest waiting until your child masters Level I before moving on (to minimize confusion of letter sounds and changes).  I feel I did get a great deal on this video.  It is like having three in one because of the three levels.  My children will sit and watch this video from beginning to end over and over (If I let them).  The songs are catchy and can be easily applied and adjusted for practicing without the video.  My five year old reads along with the characters.  It is set up like it is a sort of computer game and encourages interactive fun.  Leap frog is something your child watches.  This video talks to your children and encourages participation.  Because of this my apraxia child speaks the letter sounds as the movie goes along.  It is fun for them!  For me, watching it is kinda old-fashioned and boring (the songs stick in your head).  It is made to teach kids and for mine it has done a very good job.",1132099200,18,1535,4.338028169014085
