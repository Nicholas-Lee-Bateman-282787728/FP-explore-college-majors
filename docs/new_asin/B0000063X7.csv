That one is a full length movie (this one is two short movies).  The other one was directed by Tony Zarindast and released in 1996.  Both of these movies are horrid, I would avoid them like the plague.",1068595200,3,330,4.109375

8463525,1,B0000063X7,"I heard numerous bad reviews for this movie.  it was even on Mystery Science Theatre 3000!  Yet, the cover grabbed me in, and I rented it.  I haven't even watched thirty minutes, and yet i know it's the worst werewolf movie yet.  Bad camera work, horrible effects, a fight scene that I could've made look more realistic, and for gosh sakes, the first werewolf looks like he's got a Wal-Mart mask on.  The werewolf skull that somehow keeps effecting people has ear bones!  The fight scene looked worse than WCW, and that's saying a lot!  Plus, why would a werewolf decide to kill a man by choking him to death, rather than eating him?  If you see this movie, see it for laughs, like the part with the werewolf in the hospital gown, where you can see they didn't even bother to put hair make-up on his back.",978652800,4,805,4.391891891891892
8463526,1,B0000063X7,"Yes, that is true.  This movie was Featured on MST3K.  For those of you who have seen this movie, you can tell why.  Truly horrible, badly lite, bad acting, Joe Esteves, you aren't your brother.  STOP ACTING!  the  werewolf scenes were cheap and boring, the blood looked exactly like paint.  To the director.  You can make bad movies, but don't make a bad movie that  you want to be good.  It doesnt work",956275200,,404,4.410958904109589
