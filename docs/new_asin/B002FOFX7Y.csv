3923576,4,B002FOFX7Y,"My grand daughters loved this movie.  Especially my 4 year old.  She watches a lot.

Danny Devito is so fun as the cab driver.  The little dog, Ramona, is very adorable.  I recommend it to anyone with young children.",1293840000,,216,4.435897435897436
3923577,5,B002FOFX7Y,"We loved this modern Christmas tale of a little boy's move to the big city.  It was entertaining for my boys because they got to see New York in a new way.  Growing up in New York, they have had their share of adventures, but not like Leo's.  This exciting, fast paced ride made them appreciate and love New York even more!  ""Little Sprit: Christmas in New York"" is on our list of ""must see"" Christmas classics every year.",1267056000,,422,4.30379746835443
3923578,5,B002FOFX7Y,"Little Spirit is a fresh look at a  family, moved to a city (New York) from a suburban  life.  The new experience is exciting, but strange,for the boy named Polito, where not all people appear similiar and kind.  When the family's dear pet dog, Ramona, becomes lost, Polito is devistated.  A magical Spirit , takes Polito on a journey to revisit the people and events of the day in their search for her.  On this journey he discovers that people are not really  different, and that they, too, share family, friends and community. My grandchildren loved this story and want to see is again and again.",1259884800,,599,4.59433962264151
3923579,5,B002FOFX7Y,Little Spirit is a great new addition to the animated Christmas classics.  The tale of the boy who loses his dog in Central Park and then has to rely on the kindness of strangers to get her back has a wonderful world peace message.  Plus it's very funny and exciting.  The animation is gorgeous and the music is wonderful.  I highly recommend this film for family viewing.,1257465600,3,372,4.507462686567164
3923580,4,B002FOFX7Y,"Although several reviews I read online for this children's movie were negative, my children adored it! For my 4 year old, she was enthralled by the story. With Danny DeVito recounting the story of a boy who lost his beloved dog, Ramona, when he moved to NYC, my daughter was riveted by the children in the film, the unique animation, and the ""Little Spirit.""  A genuine story of love, moving to a new place, and difficult family changes, we watched this enchanting Christmas tale several times.  I would recommend this film to people with small children everytime!",1250726400,5,564,4.804123711340206

3923604,3,B002FOFX7Y,Was okay movie.,1417478400,,15,4.333333333333333
3923605,1,B002FOFX7Y,"The kids thought it was just okay, but my husband and I found this show to be excruciating to sit through. I am shocked at how bad it is considering its good reviews and 4-star rating! The story is okay, mediocre but tolerable, but that is all but ruined by abysmal production values and quality of animation (don't be fooled by the movie cover- that is the only polished animation you will see). The colors all seem to be filtered through bile and the surface rendering looks like it was an in-production version rather than the final cut. The whole movie felt like it needed another year of work done before it was released. With the exception of the Christine Perry song, the music is hokey, forced or too loud. The dog is really weird looking and Little Spirit was not very well conceived. And was the cab driver supposed to be Santa? Totally obtuse to my 3 & 6 year olds. Clearly I did not care for this show and regret that we watched it all.",1417219200,2,948,4.361581920903955

3923623,5,B002FOFX7Y,We showed this at my daughters birthday party in December.  It seemed just right for 8 and 9 year olds.  The older girls felt it was a bit juvenile.,1392422400,2,148,4.068965517241379

3923634,4,B002FOFX7Y,"Great show, I would have given it 5 stars but it was too short (according to my 10yr old daughter). She liked it a lot, but complained that it was too short...  I have to agree.",1356566400,,177,3.9166666666666665

3923636,5,B002FOFX7Y,"I bought this movie based off of a recommendation from Amazon. I am going to enjoy watching this with my young nephews. One of them really likes dog movies right know so the fact that this movie is about a young boy and his dog is a huge plus for me. I went ahead and watched it already, it will be able to hold my nephews attention. It is not to long that a kid would get bored watching. But there is enough of the movie to have a nice story. I also enjoyed the music through out the movie because my nephews really like dancing to the music in movies. It is funny to watch. This is a good movie to show younger kids about Christmas. I liked the fact that it was not all about Santa and that stuff. Don't get me wrong, I like Santa. I found the little spirit to be very cute and funny in some of its antics with helping the young boy find his missing dog. This should be a movie I can enjoy with my family for years to come.",1351728000,,925,3.925531914893617

3923638,5,B002FOFX7Y,"After seeing this movie on TV a few years back we quickly ordered the DVD because my kids loved it so much.  Countless viewings later, I must say that we have yet to tire of this charming holiday family film about a boy who loses his beloved dog Ramona and goes on an adventure to get her back.  The  unique animation, great soundtrack and touching, simple story line are so refreshing and makes this movie stand out above all the commercial sequels that hollywood cranks out every year.  Nothing is better than New York during the holidays and this movie celebrates this fact.  Danny DeVito is, as always, great as the cabbie/narrator, and the soundtrack featuring Duncan Sheik will be much-appreciated by adults.  Add this film to your holiday DVD repetoire, you won't be disappointed!",1319155200,2,787,4.792592592592593
3923639,3,B002FOFX7Y,"We liked the little spirit movie, but I don't understand why in every movie there is always a part where there is someone mean and my 3 1/2 yrs is still too young to see this but when he his older it will definitely be a great movie.",1294012800,,233,3.875
3923640,5,B002FOFX7Y,I am a movie addict and found this on amazon. My kids are getting older and I thought maybe they might like it because it's not just a cartoon.

8369336,5,B002FOFX7Y,"i purchased this movie several years ago. I am not sure if it is because I am a New Yorker, but sharing it with my grandchildren provided some very special moments, consequently I chose to order it myself so that I can have a copy and my grands can have a copy, they sing along in the movie to a
very cute but old song called you are my sunshine. I would recommend this movie, for its simplicity and for the lessons it teaches, about change in general",1448668800,,451,4.136363636363637

8369341,5,B002FOFX7Y,"What can I say, my four year old twin boys started to watch this last year when they were three and LOVE it.  It gets played every day at our house.  Good message, my four year olds are already calling out that mean bully!  When I pick them up from pre-k all i hear is ""mommy, can we watch RAMONA?!?""  I travel a lot to NYC for work and they know I go there so I think they also are really jazzed they get a fantastical look at ""or nork city"" as they call it.  I think its super cute and really enjoy it.",1419033600,,504,3.8076923076923075
