7935575,1,B00005AQ4X,I saw this dvd and thought it was a bargain .... Was I wrong. It contains 3 great films all spoilt by the worst transfer I have ever seen. The picture is far worse than the vhs I have and it also keeps freezing and pixelating. I have the reg 2 version of Immortal battalion and it is a fantastic transfer. Avoid this dvd at all costs.,1036368000,,334,4.0
