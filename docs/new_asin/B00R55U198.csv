6899102,5,B00R55U198,"I heartily enjoy Dario Argento's work.  I already have many of his films on DVD & Blu-Ray anyways.  When I saw they were comming out with the ""Dario Argento Collection""  (Like the Lucio Fulci Collection), I just had to get it!!!  This 3 pack from Blue Underground Contains: The Cat O'Nine tails, Deep Red (Aka Profundo Russi or The Hatchet Murders), & Inferno.
  All 3 films contain the Special Edition Features from the prior Blue Underground releases of these films.  The pictures are AWESOME.  The price for this 3 pack was great!  So if you Like Dario Argento, you will like this 3 pack of his better films.",1427760000,12,611,4.583333333333333

6899106,5,B00R55U198,"Blue Underground once again did a bang up job with a 3-Disc Collection of Dario Argento Films

The Only so/so film is  The Cat O'Nine Tails  (Not a Huge Fan of this film) This is one of Argento's Film I never fully loved it's good at best!

The other two are the other hand are simply amazing Great Italian Horror Films!
Deep Red is just brilliant it's a different type of slasher film it's this strange suspense, psychological Slasher hybrid
If you are a film fan it goes beyond Horror It's a real must see!!!

Inferno is the second chapter in The Three Mothers Trilogy it's very enjoyable not as good as Suspiria though but, it's a strong sequel
You can't go wrong with this collection it's only $19.99 and you get 3 Original Blue Underground BR with all the extras each single disc had
much like getting No Fulci Gates of Hell Blu Ray Collection
It would've been very cool for blue underground to acquire the rights to Suspiria and  The Mother of Tears
and just do a Three Mothers Trilogy blu ray collection
But, regardless you get 3 Uncut Dario Argento Films in HD for a super low price
If you are a horror fan this set is a must have  9.5/10",1439856000,7,1146,4.327102803738318
6899107,1,B00R55U198,"In 2015, there is NO EXCUSE for releasing a foreign language film in the United States without English subtitles. Anchor Bay was pulling this crap back in the early 2000's. They make sure the online listing says ""Audio: English, Italian"" and ""Subtitles: English"" so you don't know until you've already paid your money, waited for delivery, and are holding the product in your hands that the ""subtitles"" are exclusively SDH tracks for the English dub and there's no option to watch the original version of the film with subtitles. The English dubs are complete re-writes of the original scripts where the characters frequently not speaking anything that even approximates what was being said in the original dialogue, which makes the entire movie cartoonish and nonsensical, and again there's simply no excuse for releasing a film this way at this point in time when you're marketing to a niche audience that has had better options for years now.

The transfers on this discs are HIDEOUS. These films were shot on very fine grain film and should not have this dirty, dark speckled appearance. That's fake digital film noise added to try and cover up the digital noise reduction that was done instead of a proper remaster.

Arrow Video in the UK has done fantastic releases of these back around 2010, and while those releases weren't perfect, they at least gave priority to the original Italian version and made sure the picture looked the way it was supposed to. The most infuriating part of this? Arrow licensed ALL of the extras from the Anchor Bay/Blue Underground releases of these films for their edition. Which means that these companies have an existing relationship and know how to contact one another. Blue Underground could have easily called them up and asked to use THEIR subtitles. But would mean spending a little money to get it right this time instead of spitting out carbon copies of ancient back-catalog titles for nothing.",1437091200,24,1940,4.947852760736196

6899110,5,B00R55U198,"Just like the Fulci collection, this is the best bang for your buck.  We have 3 classic movies from Argento here that each one is going to tell a sweet tale and get very violent in the process! Each on their own discs, these movies shine in that they're all 30something years old and looking almost brand new.

8694165,5,B00R55U198,"three  outstanding giallo films from dario argento.  And on this one ,  you save a lot of money if you buy this because it's cheaper than buying the films on blu seperately.  Cat o nine talis is a early argento , but it's a good one.  I have his next one 'four flies on black velvet"" and it's even better. It's out on blu ray in europe.  Deep Red is a real classic and starred the late great David Hemmings.  ""inferno' is a great horror film that ties into 'suspiria' evidently.  It stands alone as a good horror film and less as a Giallo though.  The pictures look great here and  blue underground did a good job with these movies.  Why didn't they put out suspiria?  I don't know.  Or tenabrae?  and the other argentos?  who knows.  But this package delivers the goods for good horror and that's worth shelling out the cash for.",1461196800,5,830,4.292207792207792
