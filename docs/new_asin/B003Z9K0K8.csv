6086240,1,B003Z9K0K8,"A character that is supposed to be scary but isn't says he is the ""archivist"", and I don't understand what he means. He is shown before each of the three short films in this, but what he says doesn't tie in with the films.  The films have no plot you can follow.  They are all the same:  A does something to B, then B does something back to A.  Except the last film, where B's reason for doing something to A is not clear.  Even the special effects are cheap and non-convincing.  A waste of everyone's time and money who were involved in the making of this Disaster Film.  The script was 9/10s of the problem.  Couldn't anybody see that during the filming, or when reading it prior to filming, that they had a bad script?  This wasn't even so-bad-it-was-funny.  Writer: Do yourself and all of us a favor.  Go to school and work to be a better writer, or find another line of work.",1415318400,6,880,4.2727272727272725
6086241,1,B003Z9K0K8,"Doesn't make any sense, and meanders around without cohesion, direction, or connection from one story to the next!  Very scattered, covered, smattered and full of holes!  Do not recommend this to a friend~it might end your friendship!",1415145600,3,234,5.297297297297297
6086242,1,B003Z9K0K8,"Awful anthology, one of the worst I've ever seen. Stories are pointless and uncreative. It's running time is less than an hour and it's still boring.",1414540800,3,149,4.769230769230769

6086244,5,B003Z9K0K8,"A trilogy of Horror - kind of reminds me of the old Tales from the Crypt Series. Great acting, intriguing characters, cool effects, and a well thought out plot, makes this trilogy by Ryan Thompson a must have for your well-stocked Zombie Library.",1283299200,3,246,4.744186046511628
6086245,2,B003Z9K0K8,Kind of funny scary,1462233600,,19,4.0
6086246,1,B003Z9K0K8,"Wow, not even remotely scary. Just dumb.
The first ""film"" does not have any elements that could really even be construed as frightening. A little blood and guts and terrible acting.
The second could possibly have had potential until the zombie husband shows up.
I honestly have no idea the point of the third film. Juvenile dialog took away from the film even more.
This is an Anthology - of poor acting and even worse story lines.",1456617600,,431,4.6103896103896105

6086249,5,B003Z9K0K8,"It grew on me. I'll agree with other reviewers that it's cheesy, but it's intentional. The archivist bits are atmospheric, and the films (though with how short they are they're almost clips) are satisfying in a way I haven't been by anything horror in awhile. It's good in an Evil Dead kind of way. The second short is the strongest of the three.",1454889600,,346,4.507936507936508

6086271,1,B003Z9K0K8,"I wouldn't call this a film more or less a cheap promo for a haunted house. We'll start with our intro character the Archivist. This is a crypt keeper like character who puts on a bad accent and tell you how scary the tales are and that you should totally be afraid of the dark...Hes really a knock off version of an Vampire Hunter D and Dark Man....which should warn you that his story will also be as creative.

Story 1:

Make up, set design and story are below the level of a haunted house. If you have a seen a horror movie highlight a large person who has a mental deficiency and wears a mask to cover their face you know how this will end. The story is nonsensical and is a rip off of Rob Zombies poorly done Michel Myers character in the Halloween remake.

Story 2:

Teaches the viewer that domestic violence is ok because even though the husband beat his wife and she kills him..he will eventually return and kill her.  The story for this one really seems like a 5 year old wrote this. Ok she buries him in the basement..using a shovel....digging (scrapping) in concrete...eehh.....and after a bit of time they apply some of the worst aged makeup I have seen he comes back for her? Why? Sure with the first story the ""bad guys"" kill the mother and her mentally handicap son..so the son comes back for revenge. But why does the husband come back? Why on this night? She goes down to the basement and wait for him with a gun...is this an every night affair?

And now I realize I'm putting more thought effort into these stories then the writer of this ""film"". I'm not even going into detail for the 3rd story. The last story is a rip off of Fallout 3..It's flat out terrible

In short I would have to assume the makers of this movie work at a haunted house. The stories are weak, the make up is amateurish, the audio mixing is insulting. If your looking for a fun bad MST3K movie to watch then this is it. Its short enough to be watchable in that sense but by the middle of the 3rd movie even myself and the friend I was watching it with wanted this movie to end.",1422662400,2,2069,4.249363867684479
6086272,1,B003Z9K0K8,"I couldn't finish this. This movie was sooooooo bad and poorly written, scripted and acted, I actually couldn't finish it and that's a rare event for me. I love horror movies and have seen way too many bad ones, but normally I can finish a movie - not for this one.",1420156800,,265,4.215686274509804

8624501,4,B003Z9K0K8,"It didn't make a lot of sense.  The Whys of things were not explained.  But that is it's quirky appeal...the stories just started and then went .....somewhere.

For a fan of anthology horror, it's pretty unusual.",1531612800,,212,4.833333333333333
8624502,2,B003Z9K0K8,"Just couldn't get into any of the stories at all.  Would not watch it again.  Not my kind of horror movie.  Bad acting, poor writing, and flimsy plots. Not for me, but at least now I know.",1479686400,,188,4.027027027027027

8624507,2,B003Z9K0K8,A hohum movie.  If you have nothing else in horror movie toolbox then its acceptable.  Its a way to eat up a few hours of time nothing more.,1472774400,,140,3.9642857142857144
8624508,2,B003Z9K0K8,ok,1472774400,,2,2.0
8624509,1,B003Z9K0K8,"I guess if all you are interested in is mindless violence, this film might have something in it for you, but don't look for a storyline, production values, acting skills, special effects, or make up.  The first episode just starts...you don't know why the guys are there, what their motivation is, who their victims are or anything else.  And that's probably the worst one though the competition for bad is steep on this film. The second story may not be quite as bad, but the results are empty of any explanation.  By the time the third story started, I had given up.  This is a great lesson on how not to do a film.  That's the best I can say for it.",1471737600,,652,4.311475409836065
