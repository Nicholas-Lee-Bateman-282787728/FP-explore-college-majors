6388492,4,B00JPQ1I6A,"This is taken from mill creek's website listing for their 100 pack of martial arts movies. I eliminated the titles from the previously released Martial Arts 50 movie pack.  Titles in brackets indicate that the movies are also found on the set of that name from Mill Creek Entertainment. I make no claims as to the actual quality of the movies contained in this set. My rating is based on my enjoyment of their prior products.

6388502,5,B00JPQ1I6A,"This is a great set for someone who loves Kung Fu cinema and wants to really expand their collection. This is a compilation of several Mill Creek collections, such as Flying Fists of Kung Fu, Kickin it Shaolin Style, Great Impersonators and Way of the 5 Finger Death Strike. Each of these sets by themselves are about $8, so being able to have all of the films in those sets for $20 is a great deal! There are plenty of Bruce-ploitation films on this set, and most of them are actually really good. Some of the films on this set have surprisingly good video quality, and are in widescreen.

Mill Creek has a real respect for this genre, and it shows. Out of all my Mill Creek collections, this one has my favorite DVD artwork. They also gave it a great name. I love the name ""Iron Fist Frenzy"" as opposed to ""Martial Arts Classics Vol. 2"". This is a good collection, and if you don't already own Mill Creeks ""Martial Arts 50 Movie Pack Collection"" then I would suggest buying the ""100 Greatest Martial Arts Classics Collection"", which includes both the ""Iron Fist Frenzy"" and ""Martial Arts 50 Movie Pack Collection"".",1419206400,6,1116,4.524752475247524

8652947,5,B00JPQ1I6A,"I am a true Hong-Kong classic kung-fu movie fan. There was nothing better when I was a child than watching Black Belt & Kung Fu Theater on Saturdays. First came WWF wrestling ,then a classic kung-fu movie from Shaw Bros. or one of the other Hong Kong production companies. This collection is not a Shaw Bros. Collection with all the most well-known of the classic Shaw Bros. movies such as 5 Deadly Venoms, Master Killer (36 Chambers), Executioners from Shaolin, etc. but there are fantastic classic 70s & 80s kung-fu movies in this collection. These are basically a collection from some of the independent Hong Kong movie prooduction companies and directors that sprouted throughout the industry to compete with the big production companies, mainly Shaw Bros. and the company Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung were known for working with, who's name I forgot. Directors like Ng See Yun and Joseph Kuo, not to mention Yuen Woo Ping came out of the independent production company circuit of the 70s & 80s and some of their movies in this collection feature former Shaw Bros. stars that went independent like Cliff Lok, Philip Ko- Fei, Lo Lieh, Hwang Jang Lee, John Lui and Tan Tao Liang, aka Delon Tam. Lee, Lui and Tam being the greatest kickers or ""leg fighters"" from the classic era.

Take a look at what you get in this collection.

The Cavalier, Crane Fighter, Crazy Horse-Intelligent Monkey,  Drunken Tai-Chi,  18 Fatal Strikes,  5 Pattern Dragon Claws, Kung-Fu Genius, 7 Steps of Kung-Fu, Tai-Chi Shadow Boxing, Wu-Tang Magic Kick.....these classics alone make the collection worth the price. The majority of the rest are all decent, in fact they are basically all decent. This is absolutely one of the best classic kung-fu collections for the price outside of the Shaw Bros. & Wu-Tang Collections which actually feature some of the movies in this collection. This is definately the best out of all the 50 kung-fu movie collections.
Anyone, who calls this collection crap or says it's worthless most likely wasn't around in the 1970s & 80s to enjoy these classics and could never have the nostalgia a true fan would or the respect for these movies that is absolutely deserved. Bottom line, anyone telling you this is a bad collection doesn't know sh! t about classic Hong Kong kung-fu cinema.",1493251200,11,3591,4.956810631229236
8652948,1,B00JPQ1I6A,"This collection consists of low budget rubbish from the late 1970s and early 1980s that wouldn't even be good value as a freebie. The production quality ranges from unwatchable to mediocre at best, and by unwatchable I mean characters heads being completely out of camera while their speaking (ie: you will see part of a body up the neck while that same character is speaking, yes true), VERY grainy film quality and bouncy, ametuerish camera work that can only be described as that akin to a first day film production student who has never held a camera before or heard the words 'pan' or 'smooth'.  If you are looking for a martial arts collection that contains material similar to the Golden Harvest or Shaw Brothers output from the same period (ie Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan's 70s material before he started introducing comedy to his films, etc) this is DEFINITELY NOT IT.  This is quite simply ABSOLUTE RUBBISH packaged to exploit western interest in martial arts films.

I hope my review saves others from wasting their money on this like I did.",1482796800,2,1047,4.773480662983426

They're portray people in a tough situation with no choice but deal with  bad ass 'by beating bad ass!'  and believe me, the story may not end the way they want it to, but with great determination, they certainly do!  Every film here is a ""must see"".  I'd love to see more Movie Collections like this one.  Martial Arts Action Movies from China/US are a blast!

8652953,5,B00JPQ1I6A,"Decent collection of movies. Picked up at my local Kmart 7/19/2016 for $12.99, so at that price it's definitely a good deal.
If you are thinking about purchasing this set you probably have a rough idea of what you will be getting for your money.
Picture and audio quality vary from rough to decent. However, all are watchable. If you have ever watched the movies in this set, or have bought old Kung Fu films from the 70's or 80's you pretty much know what you are getting as far as quality. This is not a complaint as I knew exactly what I was getting, and more than satisfied. The majority of the films are from the 70's and 80's, but there are a few from the early 90's.

Packaging is a thick DVD case. The 13 DVD's are in paper sleeves, and have the titles of the movies on the disc itself. The DVD's just stack inside the DVD case. One nice addition was the booklet inside the case that has a brief summary of each film, the disc each film is on, and a few neat pictures. I have included a few pictures that should give you a better idea of the packaging. All in all, not bad. Whether this set is worth the money is really subjective. For me, it was very affordable, and the nostalgia will give me a lot of enjoyment.",1468886400,12,1222,4.177966101694915
