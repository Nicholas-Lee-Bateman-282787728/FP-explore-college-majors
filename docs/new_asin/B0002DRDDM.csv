8026790,5,B0002DRDDM,"I don't know why, but Brum is very popular with my almost-4 and almost-5 year olds. What with all the Pixar and Disney movies out there, I didn't think they would care too much for Brum the day we put it on for them (it's available for streaming on Netflix, if you want to preview--though not the episodes on this DVD), but they loved it! When my son opened this on Christmas morning, he said, ""Brum soccer! Oh, yeah!""

Definitely a good purchase. It's nice not to have to patrol language like you have to do in movies like Toy Story, etc, and remind kids that it's not ok to call someone ""stupid,"" or an ""idiot,"" even though Woody just called Buzz Lightyear that very name for the umpteenth time.",1261785600,2,697,4.361538461538461
8026791,5,B0002DRDDM,"One of my 3 1/2 year old twin girls just LOVES Brum.  She will sit there giggling at the slapstick comedy that this DVD contains.  It is very fun & silly humor, nothing too scary, no bad words, no violence.

Would thoroughly recommend any Brum DVDs to boys or girls of the age 3-7 years of age!

Now I need to buy a couple of the other Brum DVDs for Christmas!",1219795200,,360,4.028169014084507
8026792,5,B0002DRDDM,"My three and five yr olds LOVE Brum. The stories of the little antique car that saves the day in 'big down' in every adventure are packed with mime, music and slapstick designed for little minds. Lots of color and laughs, and of course, Brum (which I gather is named after the sound of a revving motor...brumbrumbrumbrum) who is so lovabale. I found a remote controlled version of this character sitting in a radio shack window for $20 and my son loves it. Moving eyes, totally adorable like this film. By the way..Brum is not animated. Brum is entirely live action, so if you're trying to get your kids to stop with the cartoons for even just a few moments, Brum provides a great anecdote.",1131926400,2,690,4.528
