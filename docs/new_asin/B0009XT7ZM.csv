2337204,5,B0009XT7ZM,"James Dean - Forever Young is a fascinating documentary into the life of James Dean, a lot of thought & effort has obviously gone into the production of this short (around an hour in length) documentary.

My advice? Ignore any negative remarks about Forever Young from people who haven't even seen a Jimmy Dean film before (why would anyone watch a documentary on his life if they have never seen one of his films before!?)

In short, all James Dean fans need to pick both ""James Dean - Forever Young"" and ""James Dean - Sense Memories"" as they're both a fascinating watch and a wonderful compliment to the new special edition releases of ""Rebel without a Cause"" and ""East of Eden"".",1139529600,6,681,4.619834710743802
2337205,3,B0009XT7ZM,"At the beginning of a special screening of JAMES DEAN: FOREVER YOUNG, two of its film editors opened with introductory remarks, among which was that the production had been a ""labor of love"". At the end of the showing, the question fleetingly crossed my mind: With friends like this, who needs enemies?

This documentary is a sterile visual record of Dean's brief acting career, which spanned the period 1949 to his death in 1955. The film includes brief snips from roughly two-thirds of his 38 television roles, as well as slightly longer segments from his few feature films. There are also matter-of-fact asides about his brief, first marriage to a dancer, his romantic pairing with actress Pier Angeli, and his love of Porsche cars and auto racing, the last interest indirectly leading to his death on a public highway as he drove his sports car to an event in which he was to compete.

I was only six years of age at the time of Dean's death. Obviously, I wasn't old enough to have become a fan. Subsequently, I've never seen any of his big three feature films (GIANT, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, and EAST OF EDEN) even though ""Jimmy Dean"" is an American household staple. (Whoops, sorry! That's breakfast sausage.) What makes this documentary such a disservice to its subject is that it's neither compelling enough to prod me to watch any of those films nor read-up on the man's life and career. My 3-star award will cause worshippers of the James Dean Icon to howl with indignation. That's OK; I understand, and forgive all the negative votes this review will attract.

If I was alive fifty years from now, even I could extract segments from three feature films by, say, Johnny Depp (e.g. CHOCOLAT, THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL, and THE LIBERTINE), and string them together in a short documentary with commentary in such a manner as to make contemporary audiences beg to see the entirety of each movie and read a bio of Depp's life. The fact that the creators of JAMES DEAN: FOREVER YOUNG didn't do that, at least for me, indicates that 1) they tried too hard and lost their way, or 2) there wasn't sufficient starting material to begin with. Either way, it's a lost opportunity to achieve something greater. As it is, this 50s ""rebel"" comes across as surprisingly mundane.",1134172800,10,2274,4.708542713567839
2337206,5,B0009XT7ZM,"This is a very good documentary about James Dean. He goes through his entire acting career from beginning to end. One particular scene, he showed some of his rebel-NESS. He had spoke when the script did NOT have any speaking parts for him.

Just like Al Pacino, James Dean made every role he played convincing and exciting to look at. He was an outstanding actor and I wonder what would he be like if he was still alive today. I wonder what it would be like if they casted James Dean and Al Pacino in the same movie, opposite to each other like they did with Heat (Al Pacino / Robert De Niro).

Besides being an outstanding actor, he was a COOL dude. I mean, everything about the guy was cool. From the way he talked, walked, smoked his cigarette, wore his clothes, EVERYTHING was just COOL. I don't believe there has been another actor or person as cool as James Dean was. That's what I admire about him most, his COOLNESS and him being a rebel. I, myself, can relate to his style because I consider myself as somewhat of a rebel. I lost my father at the age 7 years old and my mother wasn't really around for me and I have been rebellious against everything and everybody.

My three favorite actors of all time are:

James Dean

Al Pacino

Denzel Washington

If you haven't seen this, SEE IT and I'm sure you'll like it, especially if you're a James Dean fan.",1133136000,4,1361,4.334645669291339
2337207,5,B0009XT7ZM,"I saw this film for the USA premiere in Marion,Indiana this past summer.

It shows clips of the television show's he was on, bits from movies, his life in general.

Very touching film, a perfect tribute to a true legend",1131408000,,219,4.45
2337208,5,B0009XT7ZM,This DVD tells his life story better than any other.  Has all his short cameo clips from his early work...SAILOR BEWARE and even color footage at a SODA BAR from another film.  It has a pair of COKE COMMERCIALS.  Re-mastered home movie footage of JIMMY at one of the car races he entered.  This footage and the way it is presented is just amazing!  Looks like MARKY WINSLOW was on of the co-Producers of the film as well.  This just can't be beat!  MARTIN SHEEN also does a GREAT job as the narrator!,1127520000,10,500,4.311827956989247
2337209,5,B0009XT7ZM,"I was lucky enough to see this documentary at James Dean Fest in Marion,IN, in June 2005. It is a moving, beautiful film that I can not wait to own on September 20th. The only thing I can say to fans of James Dean........you HAVE to own this film!!! It is as vital to your collection as East of Eden, Rebel, & Giant. In this film are clips of Jimmy in all of his small film roles and all his television roles. This is the complete collection of his work as an actor and a celebration of his life, put together by TRUE fans. An absolute must for any James Dean fan....buy it now!!",1124323200,34,579,4.087719298245614
2337220,5,B0009XT7ZM,"James Dean: Forever Young is a documentary about the brief but memorable career of the now iconic James Dean. It details the rise of the icon as it tries to capture his early works on TV from the archival footage up to the point when he starred in his only three feature films - The East Of Eden;The Giant; and The Rebel Without A Cause - where he gain immortality and timeless stardom. This was definitely a well-researched and a truly definitive documentary that any James Dean fan would appreciate now that his legacy shines brighter. Definitely,a must see for anyone who wants to know more about the legendary actor.",1412467200,,620,4.6454545454545455
2337221,3,B0009XT7ZM,"The documentary is mostly about James's movies and his career and less about his life. The director seemed to shy away from the stars personal life, which is a pity. The documentary is therefore not the full story.",1376438400,4,214,4.657894736842105
2337222,4,B0009XT7ZM,"James Dean has been my idol since I was 15 years old. I never thought I could find an actor who I could identify so closely with, in terms of loneliness, frustration, and the need to belong. To be perfectly honest, I cried watching this film. It made my love for Jimmy grow even more. Sheen's narrative gives blunt, yet informative insight in the actors personal life, his work, and his love for life. If you are a James dean fan or are simply just discovering this extraordinary star, I highly recommend this film. It pays tremendous homage to the young actor who forever changed the way people lived and perceived life. James Dean will forever be in my heart, and I share a connection with this actor like non other I've felt before. I can pretty much guarantee that anyone who watches this film will feel exactly the same way :) long live dean!",1373932800,,847,4.470967741935484
2337223,4,B0009XT7ZM,"Though there are a number of books and films that have covered the all too short life of a very talented young man the extra bonus with this film was the narration by Martin Sheen. The film is a fitting 50th anniversary tribute to a somewhat troubled but talented guy from the mid-west, who turned things upside down in his three films.",1371772800,,336,4.435483870967742

2337226,5,B0009XT7ZM,JAMES DEAN: FOREVER YOUNG is the definitive look at the life of James Dean.  There are no talking heads.  It is all Dean and it's a complete look at how he rose from a Pepsi commercial to his roles in EAST OF EDEN and GIANT.,1285804800,6,224,3.9555555555555557
2337227,5,B0009XT7ZM,"This video on the iconic Jimmy Dean. It shows some rare footage of him in shows/movies you wouldn't know unless you see the dvd or have read a good book on him. I love how different he was in acting, as well as a photographer and vdeo person. Had James Dean been alive today, he would have done some great director work, and photo shows. Its such a shame he had to go when he did.",1279238400,4,380,4.0131578947368425
2337228,5,B0009XT7ZM,This film tells the definitive story of how Dean became the overnight sensation that he was in EAST OF EDEN.  The documentation and research is impressive as well as Mr. Sheridan's tenacity in finding all of these lost gems.  When will they be available on DVD?,1219190400,9,261,4.6521739130434785
2337229,3,B0009XT7ZM,"JAMES DEAN -- FOREVER YOUNG is essential viewing for anyone interested in the actor; the writer/director's done a wonderful job of assembling hard-to-find film clips, particularly from Dean's early days in live tv.  The screen tests with Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman are fascinating, too.  (On the strength of this scene, she'd have made an interesting Abra.)  My major problem with this overview?  No mention of Dean's bisexuality.  True, the production team needed cooperation from the Dean estate, and many of his fans probably don't want to think closely about that side of his life.  But Dean's proclivities have been extensively documented in print by now, and Liz Sheridan and Pier Angeli definitely weren't the entire story.  Given that much of Dean's appeal (like that of his contemporaries Brando and Clift) tempers traditional notions of American masculinity with a feminine side, seems a terrible pity to continue mythologizing a complete heterosexuality that apparently never existed.",1155859200,24,1000,5.412903225806452

8070112,5,B0009XT7ZM,I like this bio a lot. it was much more of a history and timeline and dealt with what they felt was fact and truthful. It wasn't littered with half truths or rumors or things that just can't be proven either way. It seemed more true to life than Hollywood Babylon.,1483660800,,264,4.196078431372549
8070113,2,B0009XT7ZM,"The song of the same name by Rod Stewart plays several times in the background through this ""documentary"".  Like the song, this, umm, thing, is fluff.  Dean was, by every other account, something of a tomcat with undeniable talent but an utterly lacerating upbringing which left him in a state of arrested development.  He died at 24, which was more like at 30 back in the 1950's but, to my mind, he was still a boy.  Had he lived, he would likely have become a more flamboyant version of Marlon Brando, an actor who would not deny his sexuality.  It is, for many reasons, quite tragic that he died so young - he could have become a multiple award winner and director and early queer rights icon.  This ""documentary"" is really only suitable for schoolchildren, so tame and lifeless is it.",1482364800,,788,4.553191489361702

8070116,4,B0009XT7ZM,"Michael J. Sheridan's 'James Dean - 'Forever Young' [2005]
James Dean has had more biographical films made about him than almost any other actor in Hollywood. This is a Iworthwhile documentary for the wealth of unseen early television shows in which Dean learned his trade. Well researched and edited, it took Sheridan almost 10 years to make. Narated by acclaimed actor Martin Sheen who has always been a huge Dean fan, once quoting: ""There were only two people in the fifties: Elvis Presley who changed the music, and James Dean who changed our lives"". The rare archival early television performances showcase Dean's acting prowess before his meteoric success arriving on the big screen in his iconic roles, first in 'East of Eden' then 'Rebel Without a Cause' and culminating in his final role in 'Giant'. Filming had just finished before his tragic automobile accident. Also featuring well sourced photographs from his early years raised on a farm in Fairmount Indiana and as a struggling actor in New York. A  50th Anniversary Tribute, the documentary showcased at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.

It shows the multi -talented Dean, who grew up in a small town with his loving Aunt and Uncle, as a thoughtful, fun loving, risk taker. He loved fast cars, motor cycles, poetry, art, music, and family. He was discoved by a Hollywood Director and was able to demonstrate his acting talents on the Big Screen to become a beloved Star. Because he died so young, he is remembered as forever young. I Highly recommend this film",1416441600,,469,4.529411764705882
