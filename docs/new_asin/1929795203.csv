7801304,5,1929795203,"I enjoyed viewing this video. I just started Hang Gliding and wanted to see a video which would show me what is possible given enough time. I was pleasantly surprised to see videos from my training hill included here. This video is an excellent presentation on explaining to you what you can expect to experience as you learn how to fly with the eagles.

This video opened up my eyes to what it is you can get to in participating in this sport. Based on this video I decided that my Hang Gliding goals were to hang glide the Grand Canyon, Painted Desert, and the Carpathian Mountains.

If you have a passing interest in this flying sport free from the confinement of a cabin, or the noise of an engine, this video will inspire you to go and jump into a tandem flight.",1185926400,3,767,4.356643356643357
7801305,4,1929795203,"As an aspiring HG pilot (I have never flown a HG), this video is great. I would give it a rating of 5 if they made it a little longer. Fifteen minutes+ is simply not enough even if it is just presented as an introduction to the sport of HG.",997142400,,240,3.82
