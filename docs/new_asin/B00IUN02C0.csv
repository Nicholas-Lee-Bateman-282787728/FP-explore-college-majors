8645533,5,B00IUN02C0,"Road movies have become a sub-genre within the romcom genre, but this is something different as far as the road romance is concerned. Road-romcom, in this instance, is perhaps a misnomer. It's more like a romantic road rage between a divorced couple on the way to their daughter;s wedding in Corfu. Why don't they fly?
