1803763,5,B00007AJDG,"We learned how to sail last summer through [...], and found this video to be very useful to review before heading out onto the water this summer.  Like mentioned above, it is divided into 30-minute segments which makes it easily digestable.",1211587200,3,240,4.853658536585366
1803764,3,B00007AJDG,"I admit, I am a sailing junky. So I like to watch everything I can. I learned some good things from this program. But I definitely feel the bit on heavy weather was confusing and a slightly wishy washy. I have the Pardey's Storm tactic DVD and that was definitely more confidence building. For enjoyable reasons to go cruising I like the programs put on by the Shards. But as I said in the beginning. This is worth a watch, especially for real beginners.",1199404800,5,454,4.416666666666667
1803765,5,B00007AJDG,"I purchased this DVD to help give my kids (ages 12 and 14) a headstart before going to a sailing school with them.  As Bud Foulke points out, you will not be a sailor after viewing this video.

It worked great for my kids.  They had the basic vocabulary down.  They also understood the basic points of sail.  It gave them an elevated level of confidence in being able to learn to sail.

I highly recommend it in preparation for learning to sail.  We will be using the DVD as a review before going on our first bareboat trip in a few months.",1156032000,7,540,4.184466019417476
1803766,3,B00007AJDG,"Somehow this DVD reminded me the PBS programs with Bob Ross, I think it was called Joy of Painting. Both share the same happy 1980's feel to them. But while Bob Ross and his trees are amusing and educational, this one is neither. In fact it is quite confusing and busy piece of work. The shortcomings are many, and you will most definetely capsize should you follow the advice on how to jibe in heavy weather. In fact they filmed people capsizing, presumably following that very advice.

The only reason to watch is a lack of better options, which in itself isn't a bad reason.

3 stars, mostly for nice footage of Lake George.",1149552000,3,627,4.491228070175438
1803767,4,B00007AJDG,"I bought this DVD after taking a two-day basic sailing course.  This DVD is not a substitute for a hands-on course, but it is a good supplement.  It filled in some spots that the instructor did not cover and is clearly presented.  The heavy weather portion is particularly useful for beginners who have not yet experienced it.",1099008000,19,326,4.684210526315789
1803768,5,B00007AJDG,"This is an excellent video.  Because the Rainbow 24 used in the video is so similar in both appearance and rigging to the Victory 21, new Victory 21 sailors can benefit greatly from this video.",946166400,11,193,4.514285714285714
7974628,5,B00007AJDG,this is agood video and will give you confidence if you are just learning to sail it covers all the equipment lines ect  tacking aproaching the dock and points of sail.i was looking for something a bit more advanced because im not a beginning sailor but still gave it five stars bdcause i still learned a few things,1428192000,,315,4.431034482758621

7974636,4,B00007AJDG,"The DVD is well done, it does not overwhelm you with vocabulary (there are plenty of sources for that). The focus is on sailing concepts - how the boat interacts with the wind and water.

The on-water footage is excellent. You get a real clear view of what this or that technique looks like on the boat.

The basic principles are covered, then more advanced techniques, and finally some high wind components. Certainly this is no substitution for actual sailing, but it will give you a good idea of the complexity of the sport, and the basic physics of how sails move a vessel.

This is a DVD you can watch over and over again to become comfortable with the basic physics of sailing, so that once you are 'in it' you won't be overwhelmed with confusion. An excellent primer for a beginner, and provides great principles for someone looking to understand more complex wind conditions before indulging in them as well.

If the diagrams were animated, and the series expanded, it might be a 5 star item. The presentation is well done (a few minor sound problems), the presenter is clear and unhurried, the principles are shown in practice. Overall a fine primer, even if you are taking lessons this will prepare you for your immersion into the arena of sailing.",1227398400,2,1258,4.653153153153153
7974637,4,B00007AJDG,"But the production could have been better. The on screen graphics need to be better color enhanced, and the knot making done with a graphic also. Overall, I think this is a good training lecture for all Sailors.",1217462400,2,211,4.578947368421052
