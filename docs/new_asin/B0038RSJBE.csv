DISC 1

1. JIM MILLER VS MARK BOCEK-the first round between these two is excellent which is more of a grappling match with both doing very well. The second round was just as excellent and was really exciting especially the last 90 seconds of the round, and great grappling round. The final round is more of stand up battle with both guys doing a great job making the judges work since it was a very close fight. But it would be Jim Miller grinding out the UD win. 5/5

2. JON FITCH VS BEN SAUNDERS-in the first round Fitch lives up to being called a grinder as we just grinds out the round on top of Ben. The next round is much of the same with Jon wearing Ben down while on top, few moments of stand up. The final round is the exact same thing but hey that is what you get when you watch Fitch fight. 4/5

3. KURT PELLEGRINO VS FABRICIO CAMOES-great first round with a lot of near finishes by way of submission but I think it is Kurt that took the round, but it was a great first round. The second round is excellent as well with a lot of action but it would be Kurt that gets the submission of the night win with a tight rear naked choke. 5/5

4. FRANK MIR VS SHANE CARWIN-this fight was for the interim Heavyweight title that would lead to a fight with champ Brock Lesnar. Carwin had finished all his fights in the first round and Mir is one of my all time favorites so I was looking forward to this fight. This is without a doubt an exciting fight but it is a short one since much like his last fights it did not make it out of the first round. Both look strong and are doing good but Carwin lets that power go on the fence and drops Mir. He goes into fish mode and the fight is stopped a few minutes into the fight also earning KO of the night. Now no excuses but I think Frank was looking past Shane at a rubber match with Brock, and in doing so underestimated Carwin. Also I wish they would have left the Shane/Brock interview after the fight on the DVD.5/5

5. GSP VS DAN HARDY-in this fight I was looking forward to Hardy becoming the new Welterweight champion since I am no where near a fan of GSP. This is also the fight that gained Hardy a bunch of fans including people who were watching with me that didn't like him at first. I tried to tell them about this guy before hand but oh well. Great first round that sees GSP do his usual thing taking Hardy down and controlling from there, but it is in this round that Hardy starts to gain fans when at the end of the round he slaps a tight arm bar on Hardy but Hardy refuses to tap and escapes. The second round looks the same but with a little more stand up time and Hardy even gets on top during this round. The third round is very much like the previous two with GSP controlling and trying to grind out Hardy. The next round is the same but it is also here that Hardy's fan base would continue to grow. GSP puts him in a sick kimura and really wrenches on it but Hardy refuses to tap, Hardy gains so much respect for his heart. The final round is another dominate one by GSP, there is no taking away from his ability as he gets the UD win.
The funny thing is that even after it is over GSP can't believe he couldn't finish Hardy. He asks Hardy if he is double jointed and even says he can't understand why he didn't tap. And one of the special features is in the back were he is asking his coaches to show him a proper arm bar, and even when they tell him he did nothing wrong he can't believe it. His coaches even tell him ""he would have rather you broke his arm than tap"", still he doesn't get it. Hardy afterwards was respectful and earned all kinds of fans saying in his interview the reason he didn't tap was ""whatever I lack in technicality or in strength but there is no quit in me, I don't give up"". Hardy you sir made this a special fight with your heart. 5/5

DISC 2

1. MATTHEW RIDDLE VS GREG SOTO-the first round in the opening bout of the night is a really good one with Soto relentlessly going for the take down and Riddle outwrestling him. Great first round full of action at a great pace and some good strikes landed. Most of the second round is spent on the ground with Soto working from his guard and Riddle dropping on him. Towards the end of the round the action picks up from both fighters. The third round does not last long as Soto throws an illegal up kick that ends the fight due to disqualification, giving Riddle the W.4/5

2. RODNEY WALLACE VS JARED HAMMAN-excellent first round between these two, take downs, slams, getting rocked oh my. The second round is just as exciting but a lot of it is spent on the ground, and there are some big shots landed in this one. Two rounds in this is still one of the best fights on the card, great round. The third round is excellent just like the first two going the distance with Hamman controlling most of it but an exhausted Wallace never gave up. Hamman gets the UD win in the fight of the night, great fight. 5/5

3. ROUSIMAR PALHARES VS TOMASZ DRWAL-this fight does not last long but it is an exciting one. They feel it out for a second then Drwal slips and Palhares jumps on it and sinks in a vicious heel hook. He holds it to long but it seems it was not purposely, so over all a very quick and exciting bout. 4.5/5

4. RICARDO ALMEIDA VS MATT BRWON-in this bout the always tough Matt Brown goes against the Renzo Gracie black belt Almeida. The first round is a great grappling battle that if you know your Jiu Jitsu or wrestling you will really enjoy. This is a great chess battle from working for an advantage from both. The second round turns into a great grappling battle as well but Almeida is all over him. He eventually gets his back and secures a body triangle preventing  Brown from turning him. He eventually works in the rear naked choke and forces Matt Brown to tap. 4.5/5

5. NATE DIAZ VS RORY MARKHAM-this fight is text book Diaz style if you ever wanted to see it. Both of the Diaz brothers have a very unique style in their striking that is very effective. Add in that Nate is a great Jiu Jitsu specialist and any opponent has a problem. Thing is I am not a huge Diaz fan but he lays into Rory here in this fight ending it in the first round by TKO.5/5

This disc also has all the special features like the great countdown show, behind the scenes, and the .com features. I wish they would have added the Primetime special, which would have been great.",1280966400,3,6412,4.156325543916196
8391805,5,B0038RSJBE,"Leading up to UFC 111, there were a string of events that lacked the big name star power to draw big PPV numbers.  Well that changed with 111. The UFC returned to Newark's Prudential Center for the first Super Card of 2010.

Headlining the event was welterweight #1 contender, Dan ""The Outlaw"" Hardy in his first title shot against champion George ""Rush"" St Pierre, who is widely considered to be one of, if not the best pound for pound fighter in the world.  Hardy has proven KO power but his ground game is lacking (not too uncommon with British fighters).  GSP on the other hand is the most complete fighter in MMA with probably the best wrestling in the game.  It's no secret that Hardy wants to keep this fight standing up.  Does he have what it takes to defy the odds and stop that GSP takedown?  One things for sure, most fans had new found respect for the British Outlaw after this fight.

The co-main event featured Shane Carwin vs Frank Mir.  The winner gets a title shot against UFC Heavyweight Champ Brock Lesnar.  Frank Mir, who fought Lesnar twice before going 1-1, desperately wants to meet Lesnar again for tie breaking 3rd time.  Last time Mir fought Lesnar back in July 2009, he got beat up pretty bad and got disrespected by Lesnar after the fight.  Unfortunately for Mir he has to get past a 265 pound beast in Shane Carwin.  Carwin has a perfect 11-0 record.  None of his previous fights has ever made it out of the first round.  Carwin has unbelievable knockout power and an iron chin.  Mir on the other hand has much improved striking and the best Brazilian Ju Jitsu in the heavyweight division.  Most people had this fight as a toss up and no one expected it to last long.

Other card highlights include:

Jon Fitch fights Ben Saunders who steps in to replace Thiago Alves who couldn't fight for medical reasons.

Jim Miller vs Mark Bocek

Nate Diaz has his first fight at welterweight against Rory Markham

Ricardo Almeida fights Ultimate Fighter fan favorite Matt Brown.

Kurt Pellegrino vs Fabricio Camoes

Rodney Wallace vs Jared Hamman

Rousimar Palhares vs Tomasz Drwal ... this one has a controversial ending

Matt Riddle vs Greg Soto

111 was a great card.  It is supposed to set off a string of phenomenal UFC cards.  It lives up to the hype in every way.",1272240000,7,2288,4.53921568627451
