This set was already in my cart and I was ready to purchase, but fortunately a friend loaned me his copy. Poor duplication, poor prints, but worst of all is that company logo that appears off and on during the films. I removed everything in my cart from Mill Creek Entertainment and will never buy anything from them ever (I also stopped buying from Something Weird, who also host their crummy logo for the duration of all of their DVD's, fact fans!)

Some of the stuff is really funny and awfully strange.  ""Child Bride"" is right out of the headlines here (close to the Polygamy Capital of Texas).  Most of the movies are exploitation flicks probably originally presented as having some sort of medically or morally redeeming value--they don't.

Topics of these films include drugs and alcohol (when booze was illegal), love for a price, and out-of-control teens. There's human oddities like little people and conjoined twins. In fact, for fans of the luridly bizarre this movie collection has a lot to offer.

2583083,5,B000FS9FI0,"I haven't viewed the entire set but so far the photography and sound are quite good and, in fact, excellent in Chained For Life and Child Bride.  Chained For Life deals with actual Siamnese twin sisters who are wonderful singers/entertainers (in real life, too) in vaudeville.  One is courted and exploited by another entertainer in the show much to the chagrin of the other twin.  What eventually occurs is somewhat far-fetched but still possible.  I won't ruin it but the twins are treated with dignity throughout the story which also features an actual very entertaining variety/vaudeville show.  Child Bride concerns the dignity and rights of young pre-teen and teenage girls and, as the title denotes, a very serious social issue in the U.S.A. at one time.  A teacher from the same mountain community (and in peril) advocates for a law forbidding this practice. There are also other conflicts within the mountain community, some quite ugly, but it's an interesting story, especially the unexpected ending/solution.",1169337600,51,1019,5.182926829268292

That being said, though, there are some great moments on the DVDs, and the set was more than worth the price we paid. ""Reefer Madness"" is a classic in and of itself - and if you've never seen ""Terror of Tiny Town,"" or ""Marihuana,"" you need to; those movies alone are worth the price we paid for the whole set.

Anyway, I always wanted to see reefer madness, and some of the other ones I of course never heard of, had to watch ""Child Bride"", a very risque subject from back in the thirties, and was surprised at the content in the movie itself, worth watching, the others I have watched a few of the others, none that boring, they give you a glimpse of how people thought about issues back when.  Some say some of these are cut up, edited, likely true, but if you are like me and have never seen these movies prior, it don't seem to matter.  There seems to be a restored full uncut version of just about every major cult classic movie, so for the price you get an idea of what all the hub bub is about.
The box I received was of course as usual sometimes an earlier version of this, hopefully having same titles, I mean, I sort of thought ""Freaks"" was in the set, will have to check to make sure the new box set with the pot leaf isn't for sure different.  Its happened before, where I ordered the mill creek chilling classics with the female nightgowned figure on brown background with some different titles like having the glenn ford ""Virus"" movie, but what I received was mill creeks first chilling classics box set made of cardboard, the blueish skull and blueish turquoise background having a few different titles not including ""Virus"" with glenn ford, bugged me to the point I searched for the uncut version of ""Virus"" of 156 minutes, bought off a company on ebay for about $9, a rare movie in the uncut version, so my point is getting different sets can have some benefit, sometimes.",1288742400,,1783,4.377643504531722

My boss had recommended The Terror of Tiny Town (I think he has a thing for little people).  I had to watch that one first.

The Terror of Tiny Town is a 1938 western movie using an ""all midget cast"".  It is supposed to be a serious western, but I found myself breaking out in laughter most of the time.  The midgets were rounded up to be in the Wizard of Oz, so while production was stalled on that film, the midgets made this one.

A band of bad dude ""little people"" were trying to steal cattle from another ""little"" rancher.  All the characters rode up on Shetland ponies but the stage coaches were full-sized.  I was loosing it about this time.  When the scene moves into the saloon, the little people go under the saloon swinging doors, now I'm laughing real hard.  But when two  midgets were trying to play the bass fiddle, I had some belly laughs, but the ""high pitched"" barber shop quartet, made me pee my pants.  Oh yeah, to add to the excitement the midgets get into a brawl.  I thought I was watching Howard Stern's show!  Like I said before, it wasn't meant to be funny, but it is.

The other movies again are classic cult films (no, Plan 9 From Outer Space,, is not a part of this collection), but heed my recommendation and watch The Terror of Tiny Town first---the only all midget cast movie ever!",1211414400,7,1799,4.309523809523809
