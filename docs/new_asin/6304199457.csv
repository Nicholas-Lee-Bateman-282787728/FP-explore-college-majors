7865043,5,6304199457,"The Popular Mechanics For Kids' ""How Do They Build Bridges"" video entertains and educates.  Our children loved the small character ""Pop"". The boy in the video built all the bridge types with  wooden building blocks and then Pop transported the boy to a real version  of that type of bridge, many of them from Mass.  They explain the 3 basic  types of bridge design very clearly for all ages to understand.  The boy  also gets a chance to operated some large machinery, while we all watch and  wish we could do the same!  My husband is a bridge engineer and he enjoyed  this tape as much as the kids.  These series of tapes for kids are perfect  for inquisitive children, with easy to understand language and references.  They also have a catchy song that you'll enjoy.  Well done!",954460800,6,780,4.557971014492754
