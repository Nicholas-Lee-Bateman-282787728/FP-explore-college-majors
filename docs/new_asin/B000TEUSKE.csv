2896700,5,B000TEUSKE,"This movie is unbelievably cool & gory as all get out!!  Anyone who's ever enjoyed silly type slapstick horror titles such as ""Evil Dead 2"", ""Army Of Darkness"", ""Undead"", ""Dead Alive"", ""Shaun Of The Dead"" (Shaun still did it best hands down :P) or ""Feast"" will get a swift kick outta this film.  Nothing you really need to know plot wise other than there's a show that does investigative reporting in Europe about Aliens & UFO's.  A silly rag tag group is assembled to go investigate an Alien abduction.  And then just lots of blood, guts, more blood, & more guts.  There's more to it than that, but not to spoil things, that's all you'll need to know going in.  If you've ever enjoyed any of the films I listed above watch this movie, it's destined to be a classic & you'll love every minute of it!!!  ""ENGLISH!!!"" *Ptew*",1187136000,18,822,4.476510067114094

Yeah, super intelligent beings from another world don't know how to get out of the way of a rolling shredder?

2896739,4,B000TEUSKE,"Filmed with HD cameras (relying heavily on digital FX), Evil Aliens is another in a long line of ""splat-stick"" British horror/comedy films.  The plot concerns a crappy cable TV show called Weird Worlde.  It's star, Foxy (Emily Booth) is in need of a sensational story so she comes up with the idea of going to a remote island to interview a woman who says she was implanted with an alien fetus.  Since her show requires `reenactments' she has to assemble a crew to go with her.  During the course of their filming, the aliens return (and they aren't polite).  Nothing about this movie is well-mannered.  Along with the reoccurring themes of sex and drugs, there is a generous amount of vulgarity, nudity, salty language, gore, and rude behavior.  The humor isn't subtle; it's perverse and not a little cynical.  While at times it does border on the grotesque, I liked it nonetheless.  Obviously, it's not for everyone's taste, heads do roll, spines are ripped out, it does get messy.  On the plus side, it races along at a good clip so it's over before you know it.

My favorite scene featured Ricky (Sam Butler) putting a combine to good use while a song was being played (Combine Harvester) to the tune of Melanie's Brand New Key.  That ought to keep them down on the farm.

This is one of those films where you're guaranteed either to hate it or love it.  It doesn't give you many other options.  It is crazy, raw, and very unattractive.",1413763200,,1440,4.592156862745098

It sounds good and looks good but the movie is horrible.",1395964800,,348,4.421875
2896742,1,B000TEUSKE,"If these were being sold at a quarter a piece, it would be too much.  I don't know if the aliens looked phony or not since I've never been abducted or experimented upon by aliens.  This doesn't even qualify as B-movie status, it had less money spent on it than ""The Blair Witch Project."" By the way, Oreck, Hoover, Electro-Lux, or Dirt Devil will never suck as hard as this movie.  I read the product description and several favorable reviews, looked this up on IMDB, and against my better judgment spent the money for a used DVD of this which was almost as big of a mistake as getting back together with an ex after a divorce.
That said, the closing 3 minutes made me chuckle, where the aliens are making a talk show appearance on their own home planet about the encounter.  But if you're thinking of buying this for the R-rating hoping for nudity, don't.

If you like movies like ""Black Sheep"" or ""Lesbian Vampire Killers"" then this is pretty good.  Starts off a little cheap looking, but once the film crew shows up to interview the abductees, it enters pure cheesy enjoyment.

Definitely not for everyone, and it's best to be in the mood for this type of movie when watching.

be good. A film crew goes out to do a report on the whole supposed alien abduction only to have to deal with the real aliens themselves, gosh what bad timeing for them, but good for us. It's great action and gore. Funny, cool people with good taste in weapons. You got flying spheres, alien/human sex, and impregnent w/ alien chicks. What more could you want?

I heard a lot about this movie and was looking forward to a sci-fi equivalent of Evil Dead, but the makers of this movie don't know when to quit.  Yes, there is a lot of funny stuff, but there is also unnecessary scenes that will definitely affect your gag reflexes and I am no prude.  It's off-the-wall and very silly, but worth a look.  Maybe the cut version might have been better.  WARNING: GRAPHIC violent anal probe scene and one nasty lift from ""Something About Mary"" that is nowhere near as funny and far grosser.

2896757,4,B000TEUSKE,"Any guy who has ever stayed up past everyone else in their family while growing up has undoubtedly flicked through the channels in hopes of finding that late night feature that combined over the top mayhem, and some hot women in risky peril. I came of age around 1980, a time when cable TV was still an extreme rarity. The best I had was Benny Hill, The GLOW girls of wrestling, and oddball zombie features like Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things, or The House of Seven Corpses. I was glad to get anything back then, so I would actually sit through some of the horrendously unwatchable things that Elvira Mistress of the Dark would show, just to catch a glimpse of her beautiful C cups. None of this was really what I was after, but at the time, TV really wasn't much different then the radio, so you had to take what ever they chose to give you. I didn't know it then, but what really would have fulfilled my darkest desires during those youthful late night excursions, would of been a file exactly like Evil Aliens.

This one starts with the familiar abduction and anal probe encounter...Did I say probe, I meant a Black and Decker wood boring drill bit. Anyway, there is this struggling telivision crew in search of raising its ratings, and they just happen to specialize in hokey supernatural special interest stories. When they hear about this ET impregnated Welch woman, they decided to assemble this crack team of misfits and pay her a visit. She is not alone. She has several rustic brothers who literally spit on The English language while choosing such an amusing form of garbled Welsh dialect, that it requires Enlish subtitles just to translate their gnarled vocabulary back into English on film. ""Eat your heart out Mickey O'Neil!""

The host of this dodgy TV show is Michelle Fox, played by Emily Booth of Pervirella fame. She is built like Vampirella, and sports a Danica Patrick auto racers jumpsuit zipped open well past her belly button with nothing at all on underneath it. If only the real Danica Patrick would wear that same jumpsuit. All but one of the people involved in this flakey TV crew believes that this impregnation is a hoax, so they invent their own evidence, and make their own corn ball recreations. Then the real aliens show up. These are not your cuddly Speilburg aliens either, these are more like the monsters from predator sporting scimitars. From this point on, the mayhem quickly ensues, as the various characters in the film get caught fighting for their lives against these unlovable visitors while either alone or in small groups.

Though the spirit of the antics and adventures are very similar to that of early Peter Jackson or Evil Dead II, the main difference is the amount of sex that is tossed into the mix. Most of which is in the form of teasing. God bless Emily Booth's bosoms. Not only does she sport the afore mentioned jump suit that my future wife is going to have to wear around the house, but she is also captured for artificial impregnation while being covered in nothing but the very straps that are holding her down...This will have to be my future wifes evening attire. Have I told you that I am now an Emily Booth fan?

This is definately a film that you have to be in the right frame of mind in order to enjoy. The acceptance pendulum can swing awfully wide depending on your mood at the time that you put it on. This bit of sci-fi horror adventure, stays entirely satirical at all times. The viewer is not meant to take Evil Aliens seriously. This is why I can so easily forgive the shortcomings of the space ship effects, and some of the more ridiculous moments, like the abandoning of a perfectly good vehicle to travel on foot in alien infested territory, rather then just wiping the windshield clean with an article of their clothing. None of this should matter, because there is nothing in this film that isn't completely satirical at all times. All the characters, the aliens, the adventures, and even the gore itself, are all done in the name of satire.

"" I got 20 acres, you got 43. I got a brand new combine harvester, and I'll give you the key.""

One of my favorite bits of satiracle lunacy is when one of the TV crew members drives a harvesting tractor across a wheat field while chasing down fleeing aliens. He starts a cassette tape entitled "" Motivational Farming Music "" in a crusty boombox. ( This tape title is writen in Welsh Gaelic and also has to be subtitled into English ). What plays is a rugged Welsh version of the Melanie song Brand New Key, sounding as if a bawdy group of Welsh pub crawlers where singing it karaoke style. The lyrics where changed to the ones above, so as to support the joys of driving a vehicle with various sets of six fall tall 12 foot long swirling harvesting blades. Meanwhile, aliens where being mown down right and left, and their body parts tossed about willy nilly in a continuous spray of crimson splatter. The whole time this was going on, our harvester driving crew member is just singing along to the tape while tapping the beat out on the dashboard. These are the types of fun moments that greet you when you watch Evil Aliens.

If you are a fan of films like She Creature 2001, or a film like Roger Corman's Forbidden World, A.K.A Mutant 1982, then you owe it to yourself to give this little doozie a watch. Only watch it at a time in which you don't want anything more then entertainment, for entertainments sake. Evil Aliens is a film that does serve a definate purpose, it's just not a very enlightened one.",1278720000,2,5543,4.553660982948847

excessively gross violence, play on aliens and crop circle fanatics.
They must have gone through a vat of molasses for all the blood and

through the first 10 minutes of this one the rest is gravy.  It's got
a good spoof on the song 'Brand New Key' by Melanie, as they mow down

2896759,5,B000TEUSKE,"I gave this 5-stars - strictly for the sick and twisted humor factor, cuz my humor IS, sick and twisted LOL. Otherwise it's clearly above the usual low budget constraints (they spent the money wisely)- special effects and gore with a side of bizzare toilet-style humor that guys will likely enjoy more than ladies, but it is a pretty ambitious film and they met the challenge VERY well. I see plenty of high budget eye candy garbage out there, that was not as busy and involved and multi-faceted as this film was. I'd call this a ""fringe"" film in a way, but have to say I like it and it gets lots of laffs outta me each time I see it. It's just a crazy movie and really delights in being crazy - which is good cuz ""We all go a little crazy-sometimes"". Just be prepared for a real strange ride with this one LOL! AND if buying, I really suggest the unrated one - it's too weird to miss.",1270425600,4,885,4.211764705882353
2896760,3,B000TEUSKE,"This is a pretty good low budget movie.  In fact the special effects are very well done and the unrated version does have alot of gore in it.  With heads and guts exploding out from the aliens which look like rather like demons with strange helmets on.  The characters in this movie though are the typical selfish drug user types who are usually just trying to save themselves.  This is obviously a movie for older viewers and not for kids. It has a cruel sense of humor that befits drug users too but that's just the way this movie goes.  In some films they create a world where drug use is acceptable and everywhere but in reality most people know it's a deadend and stupid lifestyle. And this movie plays to stupidity for sure. The stupid characters run all over a Island in Wales where some people still don't speak English. Which is a jab at the self-consciousness of the Welsh about their language. I would agree that this movie is influenced by films like 'the evil dead"" and 'alien""  and others but those are classic films and this isn't , nor does it pretend to be.
It does make fun of the crazed ufo people who still haven't figured out that crop circles are created by people using ropes or boards, and other true believers. There may be aliens but most of what we get is hoax's.  Or joke books like 'chariot of the gods"".  Human's built the pyramids after all; and humans made this sci fi flick with it's British Edge.  The acting is over the top and the characters are stereotypes; but that is what the director wanted and the cast is does a good job here; they are all good at this in this flick.  The unrated film pushes female cleavage
and a topless female alien who copulates with a UFO nerd as well.
Which is another reason that this movie isn't for kids.
The picture looks fine and the print is without defects or lines too.  These type of films are for fans of sci fi and low budget movies and that's why we watch them.",1245974400,,1939,4.3434903047091415
2896771,4,B000TEUSKE,"Evil Aliens (2005): This one was written and directed in the UK by Jake West who was responsible for one of my fave UK low budget vampire flicks, ""Razor Blade Smile"".  Jake has maintained his reputation for providing high VACS (Violence, Aliens, Carnage, & Sex) levels in his movies with this one. It is kind of like ""ET"" meets ""Alien"" and ""Signs"" plus a heavy dose of ""Gilligan's Island"" for flavor.  There is also an excellent homage to Sergio Leone's famous Mexican stand-off scene from ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" but this time it's between a bunch of aliens and some raucous, possibly inbred Welsh farmers.

It seems a UK TV show about aliens isn't doing well in the ratings, consistently falling behind the cooking channel so the star is told to take her crew and get a story or else. They read an article about a Welsh farm girl who claims to have been abducted and impregnated by aliens and off they go to the remote island which she and her three brothers call home. The boys consider English an inferior language and don't speak anything but Welsh which makes for some interesting subtitles. Soon the entire group is in a series of mostly hilarious battles with the aliens who have landed at a nearby ancient stone circle which they also used to re-power their ship. The aliens appear to try and impregnate almost every earth girl they can get their hands (or tentacles) on and a female alien eventually seduces the nerdly guy in the group for his first role in the hay. After lengthy battles and a late farm harvester assisted human victory, the survivors of both sides (1 each) get back home. The movie ends with the surviving alien telling her story about the dangerous Earth people to a local TV program and being laughed off the stage.  This is not one to take seriously at all, just sit back, put on a guilty grin and watch the bodily liquids spray. The movie is unrated but would probably bleed an R for: cow dung bathing, massive blood flinging, double amputees, quadruple amputees, cranial amputees, shot gunning, arrow piercing, blade ripping, impregnation by Cesarean section and definitely for the worst alien anal probing ever seen this side of Uranus.",1239321600,3,2179,4.666666666666667

2896775,3,B000TEUSKE,"I'm gonna try to keep this review short and sweet.

First off, if you don't like low/decent budget, then don't bother.

If you do like gore, then you need to try and watch this.

Ok. Now `Evil Aliens' starts off, right away, with a sex scene (which you see nothing but a dudes booty) where a guy is pounding away like a jack rabbit, right in the middle of some very large stones that form a circle. Now that is just a no no in my horror movie experience. And boy was a I right...especially if you're fond of not getting anal probed by aliens. Woah woah woah my friends. Don't get aroused just yet. Yes, we got aliens destroying a mans backside and cutting a woman's gut open to throw an alien fetus in her belly within 5 minutes of the movies beginning, but that does NOT mean this movie is good. Yet. I almost took the movie out honestly. It got pretty boring even with it's blatant humor. Thank goodness the girl named Michelle Fox was in there showing off cleavage... a lot. So I trudged on through. Michelle Fox works for like a Enquirer type of TV show and she's on a mission to get this girl that's impregnated on her show. By the way, she doesn't believe in it and she just thinks she's just trying to get attention. So on the way to Ireland (I think this is where they went), she grabbed her favorite cameraman and boom operators, an actress to play the part of the prego chick (re-enactment footage), another actor whose gay to play the guy and the alien, and a nerdy kid who is in charge of the British UFO club or something to that matter. They meet the sister and her 3 insane brothers (who are AWESOME). They investigate stuff and film things. Pretty boring first half of the movie.

And then the half way point comes. The baby grows up... inside the prego chick. She rips through the girls face and uses the body as her own. Now I'm awake! What just happened?! I was not expecting this. Then there is a dang showdown in the fields between the aliens and the three brothers that could compete with the O.K. Corral scene in Tombstone. Calm down, I'm seriously just joking about that comment. But the field scene was very fun and had plenty of gore splatter everywhere. The gore doesn't stop there either, there is plenty more to come. Also Michelle Fox became less hot to me and the actress girl became my new favorite. She kinda looks like a hotter version of Rebecca Gayheart... you know... the Noxzema girl. Well she picks up a shotgun and seriously got 10x hotter than Michelle Fox. Blasting aliens away while holding an extra shell in her mouth. LOVE. I couldn't help but just shake my head at the crazy stuff these guys did for the gore in the movie. It was pretty dang fun during the second half.

So yeah, if you can make it through the first half, I'm pretty sure you'll like the second. I was seriously going to give this 1 star until the second half started. By no means is this movie great, but dang if it didn't try..lol.

*EDIT* I forgot to mention, there is no nudity in here. Well a guys booty and two topless aliens (one with three boobs), but that's it.",1209686400,34,3083,4.325259515570934
2896776,1,B000TEUSKE,"This was not a good movie.  The acting was terrible.  The aliens looked phoney.  At the beginning, the movie shows  couple having sex in a graveyard. The act was being viewed from the point of view of an alien. The actors even messed that up.

Not only is it a travesty to compare this movie to the likes of Evil Dead 2 or Shaun of the Dead, but it's an absolute joke (and not a funny one at that) of an alien movie. This movie is, however, correctly compared to Feast, which is also a stupid movie. I don't know if it was an edited version that I watched (rated R) or these people just don't know what gore is, because this film is far from what I would call a ""gorefest."" Although, after trying to watch more than half of this incredible lame and stupid movie, I didn't even bother trying to watch the deleted or extended scenes. Unless you're a fan of movies like Snakes on a TRAIN or TransMORPHERS, I suggest looking elsewhere to be entertained. If nothing else, the fact that this movie wasn't released in America until 2 years after it was made should tell you something.",1191715200,4,948,4.361581920903955
2896779,5,B000TEUSKE,"Normally to see a great 'crowd pleaser' movie you have to watch something from Disney, Spielberg, or Jerry Bruckheimer. But with them you get no crude humor, drug use, or gratuitous amounts of gore. You have to admit, it would be nice just for once to see a movie fearless enought to do that. Enter Evil Aliens - a movie made to please a crowd that has no boundries, not even on movie genres. It's part sci fi, part horror, part comedy - and it even breaks the rules for those three genres as well. The comedy ranges from oldstyle slapstick to drug references (I can't think of another movie with that range). The gore is so creative and off the wall that it leaves you laughing in amazement, instead of puking in the corner. And it breaks all the rules of sci fi by not being family orientated in any way, shape or form. Let's face it - you could watch any of the Star Trek movies with your kids and grandparents. And remember how upset those Star Wars fans were when they saw the original Alien movie because it had blood and was scary. Those same folks would need to change their pants if they saw this. Unfortunately, this great movie didn't get the wide release it deserved. I myself saw it during a midnight madness showing. I am glad it has finally been released on dvd - now the many, many people I have been reaving about it to can finally see it.",1191456000,12,1356,4.30078125
2896780,5,B000TEUSKE,"This is a sweet movie.  I agree with the other reviewer jbizzle.  Sure it may not appeal to everyone, but it definitely should appeal to fans of the afformentioned films, such as evil dead.  It was great gory fun and I can't get enough of movies like this.  The 80's was famous for flicks like this; at least the late 80's that brought about extreme gore and over the top type of things.  Watch for the part with the combine...classic.  I also recently checked out this other low budget flick called Vampire Wars: Battle for the Universe.  And I was pleasantly surprised with that movie as well.  I recommend checking it out it was a good gory vampire film",1190851200,12,656,4.453781512605042

8208741,5,B000TEUSKE,"Ridiculously violent, crude and gross. I give it 5 stars because Evil Aliens exceeded all my expectations for it being a horrible movie. It was terrible. I can't really think of a movie to compare it to except Buckaroo Banzai. Evil Aliens is like Buckaroo except for the following. The Evil Aliens cast did not seem to include any actors. Buckaroo cast actor John Lithgow and other recognizable faces who were also actors. The only reason to continue watching Buckaroo after it started was waiting for Lithgow to deride yet another human as a ""Monkey Boy"". Evil Aliens did not provide any incentive at all to continue watching the move once it started.

All in all if you're not expecting a movie as we understand one, you won't be disappointed.",1503532800,,745,4.730769230769231
