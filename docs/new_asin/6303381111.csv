7845269,4,6303381111,"I don't really know how anyone can complain about this movie. Anyone who is willing to part with money to buy it must know what its about and what genres it will cover. You have to judge it for what it is, and as an erotic thriller its not at all bad. Obviously you can't take the plot too seriously. As it is it involves an investigator named Starkey checking out a ludicrous amount of money that has been embezzled. Just as he gets onto what looks like the right guy his main suspect dies in a very fishy car crash! And the main suspect in his murder is the very hot wife played by Tweed. There's then some monkey business with a local cop staking out the property, and Starkey sleeps with Tweed a couple of times while giving her a very thorough ""investigation"". This is all looking pretty cushy for Starkey until he becomes implicated, through and idiot plot moment, as an accomplice in the murder and then has to prove his innocence. Pretty standard sort of plot. As they go this ones good. Far, far, far better than Jim Wynorski's Virtual desire which actually uses some of this movies scences as fillers. Overall worth buying if your a fan of this genre.",1105488000,6,1161,4.404651162790698
