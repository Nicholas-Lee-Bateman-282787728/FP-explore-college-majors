8643640,5,B00INI5QV4,"Great movie based on a quirky Danish detective book series. Not for the weak of heart with vivid, sadistic scenes.",1467763200,,114,4.75
8643641,3,B00INI5QV4,The Jussi Adler-Olsen book on which this is based is so much more complex and intriguing than this film that it's almost a shame it was made. The book(s) needs to be done as a multi-episode series.,1458000000,,197,4.351351351351352
8643642,4,B00INI5QV4,"Excellent movie adaptation of the Novel. The soundtrack is also interesting interwoven with the visual image and the song ""Das Kombat"" by The Digital Motion is an excellent example.",1429833600,,181,5.275862068965517
8643643,5,B00INI5QV4,"Carl (Nikolaj Lie Kaas - `The Green Butchers') is a homicide officer who, after acting on his own initiative, gets himself and his colleagues shot up. Once back at work he is told he is no longer fit to do his old job and because he is somewhat irascible, no-one is prepared to work with him. However, he is told he can do a new job; this is the head of the stylishly named Department Q.

What it is in reality is looking into cold case files going back over twenty years and he is located in the basement - desk bound in the semi light of a career that is truly over. He is given an assistant - Assad - who is keen as a pup and has the exact opposite of a personality to Carl. They are told that theirs is a desk job, but once Carl gets his interest piqued in a five year old case; he decides to put his detective skills to use. What he and Assad start to uncover will take them both on a nail biting ride of twists and turns and had me wearing out the edge of my seat.

These Nordic Noir's are all generally very good and some are way above that and this is one of the latter. Once again not a very well known cast, but all showing acting ability in the excellent to outstanding range. It is from a novel and was originally released as `Kvinden I buret' and it has all the hallmarks to make it a corker of a film. In Danish, Swedish and a smattering of Arabic - with very good sub titles and is a film I can highly recommend.",1422057600,2,1427,3.9686411149825784
8643644,5,B00INI5QV4,I read all the jussi adler olsen department Q books. After waiting patiently for this movie to come to any engilsh speaking country I gave up and bought a region free dvd player and this dvd. It was worth the wait to see what the characters looked like. Several main plotlines in the story were missing but since this will be first in a series of movies I assume they will catch up in later installments.,1410307200,4,404,4.328947368421052
