8670913,3,B00M9HRX2K,"Some mythos has been changed for updates and it isn't as campy.  Solid animation and decent story too.  But, the characters don't feel as iconic.  I can't place my finger on it but there's something that just falls flat and feels generic about the tone.",1425513600,,253,4.5777777777777775

8670915,5,B00M9HRX2K,"Ironically, I had never even heard of the original ThunderCats series prior to the release of this revised version in 2011. Once I started watching the episodes on YouTube, I was completely amazed by the epic stories, memorable characters, and awesome action! This is by far one of the greatest animated series I have ever seen, and I am saddened by the fact that it did not get the attention it deserved. If it had carried on for another season or two, it could have stood next to modern classics like Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Samurai Jack. This is just plain awesomeness. Here's hoping Cartoon Network, or another channel, brings this back!",1410307200,7,647,4.684210526315789
