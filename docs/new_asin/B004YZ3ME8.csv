8449055,4,B004YZ3ME8,"Nice, fun, uplifting movie. I wasn't too sure about the whole speed-dating premise for getting Mark's stories out of him. The girls were mostly stereotypes. But the scenes with him and his girlfriends are quite good. Lead actor Bryan Price is very natural and believable. Definitely worth watching if you're in the mood for a romantic comedy that's not too mushy, juvenile, oversexed, etc.",1482019200,,389,5.09375

8449060,5,B004YZ3ME8,"Mark (Bryan Price) is a single guy in his twenties who can't seem to keep a relationship with a girl going for more than a few months. When he breaks up with his fifth girlfriend he decides to take up karate. (Previous breakups had led to brief forays into sword fighting and studying German.) Arriving at the fitness center, he heads to the room where the karate session is supposed to be held, only to find five girls in the room who tell him that the karate class has been changed to Sunday and that he has walked into a speed dating session. (He is the only one in the room other than the five girls.)

Although Mark wants to leave, they offer him $500 if he will stay so they can pick his brains about what guys want in a girl (seeing that no one seems to be interested in them). After a few awkward comments, the girls (each of whom has an extremely distinctive personality) ask him to describe his five relationships and why each one didn't pan out. This permits a series of flashbacks where we gain insight into each of his relationships, how they started and developed, and what eventually brought them to an end. By the end of the session Mark has gained new insight into who he is and what he really wants in a woman.

Over the next week Mark realizes how inappropriate four of his past relationships really were and at the same time how one of the girls was ideally suited for him. Going back to the next speed-dating meeting (which, as has happens every week, hasn't attracted anyone), Mark elicits the support of the speed-dating girls to win back the girl he really loves.

This is in every way a light-hearted, charming movie with a truly satisfying ending.",1378771200,,1673,4.425324675324675
8449061,5,B004YZ3ME8,Excellent movie for most all (13+ yrs). Funny and light-hearted. Leading actor (Bryan Price) is awesome. Looking for more of his movies.,1352246400,2,136,5.2272727272727275
8449062,4,B004YZ3ME8,"I really enjoyed this movie! Heartwarming, quirky, and fun. I knew it would end up happy, but couldn't have guessed how it was going to happen. I'm so tired of romantic comedies where the main characters immediately fall into bed with each other. This was a refreshing change! The acting isn't going to win any Academy Awards, but was fine enough not to distract from the story line. For this type of movie, that's all I need!",1340409600,3,426,4.545454545454546
