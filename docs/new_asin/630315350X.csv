581470,5,630315350X,"Just as the other reviewers, I too saw this film as a teenager in Canada over fourty years ago.  Not a year has gone by but that the music hasn't run through my mind.  Simply an exceptional movie.  Two years ago I met an exchange student from Nantes, a senior in high school, and she told me she had never heard of Jacques Tati.  Quel dommage!",981849600,3,343,4.151515151515151
581471,5,630315350X,"The viewer from UK was obviously expecting either ""The Naked Gun' or 'There's Something About Mary' type shenanigans.  Obviously this was the last film that person should've rented then.  Tati is one of the greatest  comic artists of 20th century and his brand of comedy is unique and  undoubtedly strange to American sensibility.  He's the Tarkovsky of comedy.  You have to pay close attention to his work in order to fully apreciate  it.  Great comedy doesn't have to be ""laugh till I cry"".  It can  be sharply made observations, or little set-pieces that are so ingenious  that you can't help but smile.  'Mon Oncle' is still very funny, even when  there aren't any obvious gags.  Tati's deliriously designed house is a  movie in itself.  I personaly prefer his other masterpiece 'Playtime', but  this is nearly as good.",935020800,15,823,4.890510948905109

Watching what Tati does with the pipes is very funny.  Watching everyone at his sister's house is funny, especially at the dinner party.  I'm not as fond of Tati as some of the French are, but then I'm not as fond of Jerry Lewis as they are, either.

581785,5,630315350X,"Jacques Tati, the creative mind behind this remarkable movie, has crafted something unique.

To be frank, this movie is not for everyone. It was made over 50 years ago, in a different era. Incidentally it won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1958.

It is a remarkable movie masterpiece- the artistic endeavour of a single minded cinematic genius.

On the surface, it's a sight comedy, with an element of slapstick at times. But, it's more: a keenly observed and gently satirical social commentary. The message is a call for simpler and less complicated times.

The color is gorgeous, the acting is restrained, the dialogue is minimalist.

It's one of those ""must see"" movies for anyone who is interested in cinematic art.",1386633600,,731,4.9105691056910565
581786,5,630315350X,"Filmed in France in 1958, it is full of a relaxed comedic approach.  The main character, Monsier Hulot, is incredibly interesting, and at times, incredibly strange.  The modern house his brother-in-law has, is a hoot.  If you want a slow but steady series of laughs with a film, that while it is subtitled, has a minimal amount of dialogue, you will enjoy this one.  You should also view his 1953 movie, Mr. Hulot's Holiday.",1371945600,,424,4.6891891891891895
581787,4,630315350X,"Comedy is perhaps more culturally based than drama, and French comedy does not seem to translate well into other cultures.  One of the great exceptions to this is the work of director, writer, and actor Jacques Tati, who continues the success of the character M. Hulot from the 1953 LES VACANCES DE MONSIEUR HULOT into the 1958 MON ONCLE, a gentle lampoon of the divide between the charm of older customs and the unpleasantnesses of the modern world.

M. Hulot (Jacques Tati) is unemployed and lives in a decayed but comfortable section of Paris, where life seems both pleasant and vibrant.  His sister and brother-in-law (Adrienne Servantie and Jean-Pierre Zola), however, are financially upscale and reside in an ultra-modern home in an ultra-modern neighborhood, where they constantly struggle against a house and lifestyle that isn't designed for human comfort.  Their son Gerad (Alain Becourt) much prefers his uncle's way of life to his parents' ridiculously sterile existance, a circumstance that prompts Hulot's sister and brother-in-law to force Hulot to ""settle down"" in ""proper manner.""

The film is somewhat akin to the silent films of Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd, for there is very little dialogue and a strong emphasis on sight gags--most of them mild, quite a few of them laugh-out-loud.  The modern kitchen, for example, sounds rather like a jet about to take off; modern chairs are hideously uncomfortable; women's high heels make punctuating noises on relentlessly hard floors--and all in comparison with Hulot's world, where dogs run in cheerful packs, boys play practical jokes, and the street sweeper never actually seems to get around to sweeping up anything at all.  Perhaps my favorite moment in the film (I have many) is when the uppity in-laws mistake their neighbor, arriving for a party, as a rug salesman!  Everything plays beautifully, and it is no wonder the film won so many awards and remains so widely beloved.  Recommended.

581792,5,630315350X,"'Mon Oncle' is arguably the best film by French mime artist Jacques Tati. His comedy of manners reeks of nostalgia. Which makes you wonder if this portrait of nineteen fifties France is a fair call, or just a sentimental journey into happy make-believe. Tati displays impeccable timing as clumsy, self-conscious Monsieur Hulot. And we find an understated matter-of-factness about how events proceed and how the characters are portrayed. As we are all creatures of routine, this movie delights in the small detail of what it means to be a conformist during the post-war boom. It is a somewhat slow piece of entertainment, by today's standards, but good things come to those who wait. Many delicious surprises are found inside the automatic gates of the high-tech house, where much of the story unfolds.",1343433600,,801,5.075757575757576
581793,5,630315350X,"'Mon Oncle' is Jacque Tati's third film and continues the adventures of the accident-prone hero, M. Hulot.  It again observes peoples' peccadilloes, but also satirizes the foibles of the modern mechanical world.  Again, the humour is quiet and subdued, and the film is a fitting sequel to 'M. Hulot's Holiday'.",1342569600,,310,5.18
581794,4,630315350X,"Jacques Tati's Mon Oncle centers on the socially awkward yet lovable character of Monsieur Hulot and his quixotic struggle with postwar France's infatuation with modern architecture, mechanical efficiency and American-style consumerism. The first of Tati's films to be released in color, Mon Oncle won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film a Special Prize at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival  receiving more honors than any of Tati's other cinematic works.

As with most Tati films, Mon Oncle is largely a visual comedy; color and lighting are employed to help tell the story. The dialogue in Mon Oncle is barely audible, and largely subordinated to the role of a sound effect. Consequently, most of the conversations are not subtitled. Instead, the drifting noises of heated arguments and idle banter complement other sounds and the physical movements of the characters, intensifying comedic effect. The complex soundtrack also uses music to characterize environments, including a lively musical theme that represents Hulot's world of comical inefficiency and freedom.

M. Hulot (Jacques Tati) is the dreamy, impractical, and adored uncle of young G&eacute;rard who lives with his materialistic parents in an ultra-modern geometric house and garden (Villa Arpel) in a new suburb of Paris, situated just beyond the crumbling stone buildings of the old neighborhoods of the city. G&eacute;rard's parents, M. and Mme. Arpel, are firmly entrenched in a machine-like existence of work, fixed gender roles, and the acquisition of status through possessions and conspicuous display. Each element of Villa Arpel is representational rather than functional, an environment completely hostile to the comfort of its occupants.
Despite the superficial beauty of its modern design, the Arpels' home is entirely impersonal, as are the Arpels themselves. In fact, M. and Mme. Arpel have completely subordinated their individuality to maintain their social position and their shiny new possessions. Tati emphasizes his themes surrounding the Arpel lifestyle (as well as M. Arpel's automatonic workplace, Plastac) with monochromatic shades and cloudy days; vivid colors and bright light coincide only with the arrival of visitors, particularly Uncle Hulot.

In contrast, Uncle Hulot,lives in a small old corner of the city. He is unemployed, and gets around town either on foot or on a rather tired motorcycle. Though he is obviously without possessions, he does not seem to notice; color, light, and frivolity inhabit Hulot's world. Young G&eacute;rard, utterly bored by the sterility and monotony of his life with his parents, fastens himself to Uncle Hulot at every opportunity. Uncle Hulot, little more than a child himself at times, is completely at home with G&eacute;rard, but also completely ineffectual at controlling his horseplay with his school friends, who take delight in tormenting adults with practical jokes. Exasperated at their uncle's perceived immaturity, the Arpels soon scheme to saddle him with the twin yokes of family and business responsibilities.

The film does a good job of contrasting the two poles of French society and Tati is clearly of the camp that the old wats are better than the new. Tati constantly emphasizes however that France is changing and  that in the end the old way will be phased out. The film also shows that there is more to life than efficienct, a lesson Gerard's father must learn by the end of the film in order to bond with his young son.

The BFI Edition of the film presents a good quality transfer with no real added bonus features. While the visual gags are not as frequent in this outing and Tati seems a little tired of his character Hulot this is still quite a good film and one worthy of multiple viewings. Tati packs so much material into his frame that a single viewing does not do the film justice.

See it as a picture of a time that is now past and a warning against a completely efficient future.",1300320000,,3957,5.181533646322379

581837,5,630315350X,"Jacques Tati (1908 - 1982) admired the silent screen comedians, in particular Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Mister Hulot, the character Tati created and portrayed in four of his six feature length films, was imbued with the soul of Chaplin's Tramp - earnest, benevolent, down-at-heel, unconstrained, and ever optimistic - but his progress through life's perils and predicaments was uniquely his own.
  Chaplin's characters were graceful and acrobatic as they moved among the mayhem they had triggered. Mister Hulot lurches forward as a man whose joints are past due for lubrication. His back is rigid, his legs are stiff, his trousers stop three inches above his ankles in their striped socks. His tan gabardine raincoat is unsuitable for all occasions; his umbrella is as much an inadvertent weapon as a prophylactic against the weather; his chapeau is creased at the crown and upturned at the back and his pipe juts out as if thumbing its nose at adversity. His modest lodgings sit atop an impossibly convoluted stairwell in a cramped tenement continuously serenaded by a cacophony of voices and a chaos of people attending to their inscrutable daily business.
  Hulot has time for everyone. He shares candy with the blossoming teenage daughter of the woman who irons his shirts; he is interrupted by the street sweeper who can never find the time to collect a small heap of debris in the middle of the street; he is distracted by the vegetable vendor whose ancient truck spills over with unsorted piles of produce; his associates at Chez Margot, the cafe that owns the only telephone in the neighborhood, summon him for ""biere de luxe"" and billiards.
  In ""My Uncle"" (1958), Mister Hulot's well-meaning sister Madame Arpel and her no-nonsense husband Charles are concerned to settle Hulot into domestic regularity by finding him a job and a bride. Their own lives are as ordered as gears in a machine. Their home is a study in sterility with chairs that discourage sitting, tables that demand vacancy, floors that amplify the clack of shoes, and walls that repel art. The kitchen is a calcimine chamber of electro-mechanical conveniences. The garden is a collision of geometric designs, dominated by a metallic water-spewing pond sculpture, where hedges are cubed, grass is boxed, vines are plastic, gravel-packed squares sprout ovoid shrubs, and flagstone paths follow irrational curves.
  Charles works for Plastac, a manufacturer of hoses. He pilots his Oldsmobile to work in a dense parade of traffic precisely arrayed in files and ranks. Each day he dutifully deposits his son Gerard at the local ecole, but suffers from anxiety that the boy is more fond of Uncle Hulot, who accompanies him home every afternoon with kindly tolerance of the mischievous pranks the youngster and his pals get up to.
  Hulot's trademark is innocence. He is intimidated by unfamiliar gadgets and blissfully unaware of impending havoc, social or otherwise. He is incurably out of step with his surroundings, apologetically scrambling to mask or flee from the mishaps that bedevil him.
  When Madame Arpel organizes a garden party to introduce Hulot to a romantic possibility deemed to be an appropriate match because she is ""tidy and meticulous"", the guests endure a purgatory of exaggerated courtesies. Within minutes of Hulot's tardy arrival, the party is transformed into a cotillion of tiptoeing statues desperate to repair damages and retrieve dignities.
  As soon as Charles succeeds in placing Hulot at Plastac, the fully automated factory suddenly starts pumping air balloons into the hoses and truncating them into sausages.
  During his early years in the movies Jacques Tati performed as a mime. As an auteur, his attention to sound is as artfully crafted for satiric effect as the balletic choreography of the characters. The incessant click of heels in the Arpel home emphasize its hollow welcome. The noisy chatter and inchoate bustle of Hulot's neighbors represent vitality bursting at the seams. Free ranging dogs frolicking through fields and streets provide a contrast to the forced configurations and arbitrary conventions of human life.
  ""My Uncle"" recoils from the onslaught of modernization. Hulot's town, like much of France at the time, is in a phase of post-war recovery. Venerable older sections are being razed in favor of newer structures. Tramping through a vacant field, Hulot accidentally dislodges a brick from a crumbling wall, then gently replaces it. The film's opening titles are posted on signboards in front of a building being demolished. Instead of the customary musical prelude, jackhammers rudely assault the ear, warning us that the destruction of the past does not guarantee the felicity of the future.
  In Tati's films, plots are scarcely more than sequences of sight and sound gags. There is no dramatic sense that events are building toward a culmination. They proceed organically from incident to incident, as amiable Mister Hulot sallies forth armed for misadventure with nothing more than his good nature, his love of fun and his confidence that everyone he meets will be equally entertaining.",1288915200,2,5137,5.181159420289855
581838,5,630315350X,"If you are a fan of the British comedies ""Mr. Bean"" (played by Rowan Atkinson) and ""Keeping Up Appearances"" (with Patricia Routledge at the helm), you will probably enjoy this movie, as it is clear that the creators of those comedies were influenced by Tati.  There's even a scene that resembles one from John Cleese's ""Fawlty Towers"" (as the party guests are leaving the party, which has just ended disastrously, each guest is nursing an injury received at the party, or with soiled clothing--just like ending of the ""Fawlty Towers"" episode entitled ""The Anniversary""--even down to the last guest handing the host an empty glass).

The movie is a visual and aural delight--I love the sound of the coins that the boys toss on to the rock when they are taking bets on the bluff overlooking the street light.  The scenes involving the modern house and business office contain no background noise--very eerily silent and lifeless (like they're in a vacuum), and certainly contrast with the old world scenes, where the village denizens are lively and loquacious.

Tati further exploits sound in this picture.  Even the woman at the party with the obnoxious laugh (very funny!) is ""shushed"" by Mrs. Arpel, as that laugh is clearly out of place at her backyard party.  The old world music that annoyingly comes over the office phone, totally unwanted and out-of-place, followed by an abrupt cut to a shot of another phone hanging off the hook in a phone booth in Hulot's neighboorhood sums up the whole point of the movie in one sequence.

The first time you see Hulot enter his apartment complex you know that you will see him or part of him through each of those windows as he meanders his way up to his flat.  Very clever.  The one brick that Hulot picks up and puts back on the wall, which is crumbling--as if that is going to help the situation, again rather summarizing the point of the movie.  The scene at the party where Mr. Arpel is sitting, rocking in that ridiculous, exaggerated rocking chair squawking to his business associate, while Hulot and the boy are off on the left of the screen trying to trim the branches on the foliage next to the garage--hilarious--Mr. Bean, where are you?

When the silly fish fountain malfunctions and sprays water all over, the party guests have to pick up the patio furniture, dishes, food, etc. and follow Mrs. Arpel around the backyard to a ""new"" spot to have their picnic.  Anybody remember the ""Keeping Up Appearances"" episode where Hyacinth is in search of the perfect spot for the ""waterside picnic and riparian entertainments"" and has her whole entourage laborously carrying backyard furniture, picnic baskets, etc. all over the place?

There's hope for the young boy's father, though, because at the end of the movie, his whistling catches someone off guard, who runs into the statue, reminiscent of the earlier scene with the young boys.  Maybe Mr. Arpel IS catching on to why his son would rather spend his time with his uncle.........

This movie is not the ""bust a gut laughing"" kind of movie--rather it is contemplative and views like a rather large comic strip.  Great fun!",1281139200,,3128,4.797020484171322
581839,5,630315350X,"With ""Mon Oncle"", Tati has shown that his brilliance is full of endless ideas.  Most comedic actors/directors would find it hard to top a classic like ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" but with this film, Tati takes his creativity to another level.  One of the magical parts of Tati's films is the sparse dialog or the use of the spoken word as 'background noise' to accentuate, but not detract from a scene.  The film also shows us a glimpse into post-WW2 France, the eternal obsession with socio-economic status and/or materialism, and how the simple pleasures in life are often the best way to enjoy the day.  The rapport between Hulot and his nephew Gerard give you in impression that in spite of the generational differences, their ""Carpe Diem"" outlook on life is similar in many ways.  Gerard's parents have their own level of hilarity with such examples of the father's rigid corporate demeanor and the mother's exhibitionist fixation on showing off the ""fish fountain"" to visitors.  ""Mon Oncle"" is, by some accounts, Tati's best work and will surely delight anyone whose not only a fan of his work, but can relate to a comedic character who goes against the grain.",1280880000,,1160,4.833333333333333
581840,5,630315350X,"This is a very unusual movie, for me at least.  There is very little dialogue here.  The fascination is with an art deco house built with ultra technology in every sense, in every part of the house, inside and out.  A house built with lines and corners, mostly open spaces, and very little color.  And an almost ""lack"" of furniture, which to me emphasizes the extreme lack of personal relationships, of ""living"".  You are immediately faced with the kind of life the couple lives, how phony and ice cold, reaching to an insane level of formality.  In one scene, the father eats alone at a small table outside, and then he moves to another small table for coffee.  And when a visitor comes, the whole point to the wife is that he/she has comes to see this ""magnificent"" structure, and so she shows the person around as if the place were a museum and not a home, and then the person leaves.  The structure is surrounded by a high tech fence, cutting it off from the natural scenery and normal life outside.  The uncle comes periodically to take the boy outside into the real world, where they both thrive in the very typical goings-on and where the young boy gets involved in the play and mischief of the other boys.  The difference is striking.  This movie is actually a comedy, a satire, where even with such perfection, things break and go haywire.  The scene of a party being held there is worth the cost of the movie.  Even the people go haywire.  They are all stuffed on a very small cement surface outside where there isn't room for even a third of them and so they are falling into a small square pond, and tripping, and whatever.  A total disaster.  Funny stuff.  You can't watch this movie and not react to the total lack of the ""personal"" here.  Again, though, the one exception is the young boy and the uncle who pair up to remove themselves from such an atmosphere by simply leaving for little ventures into the town and enjoying the life where things are personal.",1278115200,,1975,4.484593837535014

581842,5,630315350X,"Jacques Tati, a wonderful actor and one of the greatest film directors who has only created six feature films but watching it today, you can't help but feel he was ahead of his time.  The French filmmaker who saw the Paris that he grew up with becoming a different Paris that is today.

With his Charlie Chaplin-esque character Monsieur Hulot, his second film ""Las Vacancdes de Monsieur Hulot"" (Mr. Hulot's Holiday) would introduce the character and would earn Tati his first Academy Award nomination for ""Best Original Screenplay"".  His third major feature ""Mon Oncle"" (1958) would be Tati's first film in color and would focus on the disappearance of the Paris that he once knew and France's obsession with modern architecture and gadgetry but also American-style consumerism.

The film not only had impact in France but also in America as the film would win an Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"", a Special Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and also a New York Film Critics Award.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Mon Oncle"" is presented in color and in 1:33:1 aspect ratio.  For a film created in 1958, The Criterion Collection has done a good job in transferring the film to DVD.  There are some situations where you do see the occasional dust and scratches of the film but for the most part, for a film that is over 50-years-old, ""Mon Oncle"" looks quite beautiful on DVD.

As for the film, according to Criterion, the digital transfer was created from a 35mm interpositive.  I would hope to see that the film was run through their MTI Digital Restoration system to minimize the scratches and dust but this was an older DVD release from 2001.  The film looks good but knowing Criterion and what they have accomplished with earlier films that they re-released, I hoped ""Mon Oncle"" is definitely considered for remastering and restoration in the near future.  After seeing what The Criterion Collection has done with Tati's ""Play Time"" on Blu-ray, it makes me wonder what they can do with ""Mon Oncle"" if they choose to re-release it.  I'm sure it would look equally as beautiful and vibrant.

As for the audio, the audio is presented in Monaural and according to Criterion, the sound was mastered from the 35mm magnetic tracks.  I personally chose to listen to the film with audio on my home theater receiver set for stereo on all channels for a better audio experience with my 7.2 setup.  But for the most part, sound is clear and the music by Franck Barcellini and Alain Romans is fantastic.

Optional subtitles are featured in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Mon Oncle"" comes with the following special features:

  * Video Introduction- (5:07) A video introduction by writer, director and performer Terry Jones who knows a lot about Jacques Tati's work and his impressions of ""Mon Oncle"" when he first watched it and now.
  * L'ecole des facteurs - (15:04) The second short film directed and starring Jacques Tati back in 1947.  The short film is about a new postman who has a job to deliver his mail on bike and must take outgoing mail to the airplane in time.  But with challenges he meets on the job, will he be able to get the mail out in time?

JUDGMENT CALL:

Fantastic!  A Jacques Tati masterpiece that has its relevance even today with the technological changes that we have experienced in the last 25-years and have become so dependent on technology for everyday life, one can't help but understand and sympathize with Jacques Tati as he had experienced in 1958 and seeing part of the world that he lived in, changing with technology and modernism.

After watching ""Playtime"" (my first Tati film), I knew what to expect.  Granted, ""Playtime"" was even more modern and so ambitious for Tati, ""Mon Oncle"" is a much purer film as it doesn't rely on extravagant buildings or sets or many people and vehicles being choreographed to move a certain way.

It's the characters through Hulot's eyes and also Gerard's eyes that intrigue us.  From his landlord's daughter who we see grow up with each scene to Gerard and his friends trying to fake car accidents, there is a lot to watch and take in visually and have a fun time with what Hulot provides.  There are scenes that I didn't see the first time, that I saw on the second watch especially through the Arpel side and the technology used.  From the vacuum cleaner that doesn't need a human, to the automatic window cleaner and speaking of technology, how about the garage door that activates with a sensor and traps its owners in the garage, or the modern furniture that may look visually appealing but not in terms of comfort, to the actual design of their modern home and how difficult it is for the party goers where there they have to watch where they step in and rely on the various stones.

Considering that day in time where people wanted to move forward in technology and people can only imagine what the future had in store, here we are in today's modern age, dependent on technology and those things we enjoyed 25-years-ago may all be part of the past but featured in a different manner.  One would imagine how Tati would have filmed a Hulot film in today's world.

There can be comparisons with Tati's ""Mon Oncle"" and Charlie Chaplin's ""Modern Times"" and Rene Clair's ""A nous la liberte"" but where those two films are more similar to each other, ""Mon Oncle"" is much different.  Part of me feels that Tati created these films as almost a time capsule of how things were like and will never be. This is a story about a man caught in the world of the old and the new and using comedy to show that transition.  The film is satirical, full of gags and for me, visually poetic but in someways, there is some sadness to the film (in my perspective) because there is no way Hulot and I would guess a lot of those others in the old French neighborhood would comfortable in this modernist world.  In one scene, a grocer from old Paris delivers food to the Arpel's and he is just in awe of the lifestyle and home that they live in.

I've read that the US release of ""My Uncle"" was quite different (Tati filmed an English version at the same time) and through editing, signs were changed and certain scenes were eliminated.  Especially how the Arpel's and their friends spoke in English while the French side of Hulot's world do not.  It would be been nice if the Criterion Collection was to revisit this release, to include the English version on Blu-ray.

Overall, ""Mon Oncle"" is another visual feast from Jacques Tati and with many people discovering ""Playtime"" on Blu-ray, hopefully many of these viewers who enjoyed the film will also give ""M. Hulot's Holiday"", ""Mon Oncle"" and ""Trafic"" (which the three are also available on DVD via The Criterion Collection) a chance.  Definitely recommended!",1262563200,,6753,4.684745762711865

Hulot's Holiday"". The story revolves mostly around a family and their new ""modern"" home, which reminds me of watching those old ""Kitchen of the Future"" programs. Many of the technological advances seem questionable at best, and some seem outright stupid. The film pokes fun at those who worry about ""Keeping up with the Joneses"", culminating in a VERY humorous dinner party scene. It should be noted that the M. Hulot films are not so much a feature-length narrative as a collection of sketches, sometimes connected very loosely.

This indisputably odd moment captures the forever-relevant theme of Jacques Tati's second Hulot film: the mismatch of non-essential technology and human behavior, the excess vs. the basic.  In some ways the continental cousin to Chaplin's Modern Times, this is a gentle comedy, sedately paced and brightly scored, and therefore may not appeal to audiences weaned on the frenetic and abrasive pace of modern laugh-fests.  However, those with the patience to let Tati's brilliant set pieces methodically unfold will reap opulent comic rewards.  As with the best of Chaplin and Keaton, all the viewer can do is sit open-mouthed in admiring wonder as he considers the conceptual and physical grunt work it must have taken to capture such moments on film.

Art House and International Cinema are different than mainstream films.
Regarding Jacques Tatischeff a.k.a. Jacques Tati (1907-1982) was one of the best writers and directors of French Cinema. He played with the absurd, minimalistic language, great acting and directing. Mon Oncle (My Uncle) was released in 1958. Its a comedy in a Futuristic and industrial world, mechanical and minimalistic, mid-century modern and art deco. Remember the GM buses Tour of the future, and Disneyland's House of the future.

581918,5,630315350X,"In the aftermath of WWII, most western world faced similar problems.  Large scale urban planning and large scale industrial projects seemed common answers.  It's Tati's intuition, transposed in this 1959 film, that captured how fit these answers have become.  Now, with all the social unrest and physical decay in socially engineered urban centers, we can see that those answers were temporary fixes at best.  At a different level, it shows the limitations of rational approaches to social re-engineering.

The elements of this film can almost be divided neatly in any pair of the following categories: Old and New; Chaos, Order; Emotional, Rational; Organic, Synthetic; Myriad of unwritten rules, Clear and specified rules; and on and on.  Common between any two opposing categories are a social misfit, a child, and a dog.  Socially, they belong to parallel categories, yet they enter each other's realm by literally passing through a broken brick-wall.  The misfit is Mr. Hulot, who belongs to the old world--played here by the director himslef, Jacques Tati.  The child is Mr. Hulot's nephew, who lives with his well-off parents and the dog in a house/society of the future, as imagined by the forward-thinking minds of the moment.  Nobody seems well adjusted to the synthetic world yet it is only the child who shows it without restraint.  At least Mr. Hulot is the typical misfit, no matter what world he lives in.  This remains so, despite the serial mishap befallen unto the inhabitants of the new world, until the end of the film when, led by a string of events, the father of the child is re-humanized by a prank;  ...the same type of prank his son was enjoying in the dis-orderly world of Mr. Hulot.

In the end, we can try to do it all in the name of some progress or another, but if a child (or a dog) doesn't go with it, we have a warning sign.  And, at times, an artist comes along and, through artistic production and intuition, is able to look further ahead than most.  In 1959, that artist was the director and actor Jacques Tati.",1185062400,4,2048,4.775568181818182
581949,5,630315350X,"""Mon Oncle"" is the 2nd film in the highly acclaimed ""Hulot"" series and is, arguably, the best. How qualified I am to say that, I don't know. I've seen ""M. Hulot's Holiday"" and now I've seen ""Mon Oncle,"" but that still leaves ""Playtime"" and ""Traffic."" I'm confident with my choice though. ""Mon Oncle"" was released 5 years after ""M. Hulot's Holiday"" and won the Best Foreign Film Oscar. It's also in color as opposed to the black & white of the earlier film, but it's in color for good reason. Jacques Tati's Monsieur Hulot is very much like Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp. The same character in every film only in a different situation and sporting a slightly different personality. In ""M. Hulot's Holiday,"" Monsieur Hulot was the protagonist. A happy and simple man who was on vacation and just happened to wreak havoc almost everywhere he went. In ""Mon Oncle,"" Hulot is, in the words of Roger Ebert, ""a lost soul, unemployed, bemused, and confused..."" That's true, because in the first film the surroundings seemed to fit Hulot. Even the light, happy jazz score seemed to fit the man. The world in which ""Mon Oncle"" takes place is exactly where Hulot does not belong. In this film, Hulot lives at the top of a large building, which actually appears to be two buildings. He lives near his sister Madame Arpel (Adrienne Servantie) and his brother-in-law Monsieur Arpel (Jean-Pierre Zola). Monsieur Arpel works at a plant called Plastac that manufactures plastic hose. While Monsieur Arpel works at getting Hulot a job and Madame Arpel works on getting him a girlfriend, Hulot spends time with their young son Gerard (Alain Becourt) who spends his time hanging out with a group of delinquents who make the town miserable for many of the adults. In his simplicity, Hulot is understood by only one person in the film and that person is Gerard (go figure, huh?). Any person who talks about this film will mention the brilliant art/set direction by Henri Schmitt. The film takes place in a very modern world that does not fit the simplistic mind of Hulot and the sets brilliantly illustrate how out of place he is in this world. One of the best gags of the film comes from the fact that Monsieur and Madame Arpel have a fish fountain in their yard that they immediately turn on whenever company arrives. In one early scene, Monsieur Arpel arrives home and Madame Arpel (not knowing it's her husband) rushes to turn the fountain on before he yells, ""it's only me!"" While ""M. Hulot's Holiday"" was largely a silent film, with only the score and occasional dialogue being on the soundtrack; ""Mon Oncle"" contains quite a bit of dialogue. I've heard many people say it's just as silent as ""M. Hulot's Holiday"" and maybe (with a 30 minute longer running time) it is, but there's a lot more dialogue here. ""M. Hulot's Holiday"" was a comedy, in the way that Chaplin's ""The Circus"" was. ""Mon Oncle"" has many comedic moments, but has a sad mood to it more in the vein of Chaplin's ""City Lights"" I guess. Tati was a genius and a perfectionist and with ""Mon Oncle"" had crafted a near-perfect film.

They have a fountain with a spitting fish statue in the center, a very high tech kitchen that solves the basic ""problems"" that exist in that part of the household with so-called ""labor saving"" gadgets (that, of course, go haywire when in the hands of Hulot), and a tiny, billigerent pet Dauchshaund in a little plaid sweater.

The movie has very little dialogue, a silent-movie like musical score, and a number of gags involving Hulot being utterly confused by the modern gadgets in her sister's house (to be fair, few of those gags are laugh-out-loud funny). Actually, what I found even more fascinating than the retrofuturism in Mon Oncle, watching it now, is the look of the old part of town where Hulot lives (we see the France of the 20s and 30s, still existing in 1958, but soon to be razed down, as it has been seldom been shown on color film).

From its rakish bookending sequences of dogs running around a modernized French town, Mon Oncle sets itself up as the comedy that sniffs the ground, as the movie to take aim at the bizarre confines of modern society.  That it is an indelible critique of the bizarre trappings of modernity is nice, that it does so as a whimsical and effusive slapstick confection makes it perfect - following Mr. Hulot from one bizarre comic encounter with the harsh and illusory modern world to another, Mon Oncle is all the more charming because of its vantage point.  Hulot is simply good natured - a jolly and misunderstood cartoon character of a man who you love all the more because of his refusal to criticize, because of his acceptance of all.  That the backdrop of his sister's house, where much of the action takes place, is a stylized monstrosity in which kitchen utensils leap to life at a push of a button, people greet each other moving in opposite directions, and neighbors can be mistaken for rug salesmen only makes you revel in Hulot's outsider goodwill.  As Mon Oncle nears 50, its importance as a fable of fond authenticity cannot be overstated - it's a movie whose timeless confusion at culture at large is both important and unnoticeable in the presence of its comic charm.",1157328000,2,1425,4.661354581673307

581958,5,630315350X,"MON ONCLE (My Uncle) is one, indeed, the most hilarious French films that has been made. Jacques Tati shows film viewers post-war France, and its progression towards a prosperous future, which involved the nuclear family and modernization.  Once again, Tati plays the bumbling Chaplinesque figure, Monsieur Hulot, who tends to get himself in a little mischief.  For this installment, Hulot is at odds with his brother-in-law, Charles Arpel (Jean-Pierre Zola II) over his nephew, Gerard (Alain Becourt).  Madame Arpel (Adrienne Servantie), his sister, has no qualms about her brother, but receives the gripes from Charles.  It appears that Hulot spends too much time with Gerard, and may be a bad influence on the boy.  Charles attempts to remedy the problem by hiring Hulot at his plastic company, and later promoting him to another position away from Gerard.

The Arpels live in the new world with all its modernist features and conveniences of a modern home of the late 1950s.  Their lives are a string of daily routine -- straight and narrow environment that is meticulously organized and sanitized.  Indeed, the furniture they sit and eat on resembles something that may have been owned by Ken and Barbie.  The modern French landscape looks no different than their US counterparts, an automatic garage door and everyone drives and own a colorful '57-'58 Chevy (pink and green). The most obnoxious and annoying object in the film is the fish water fountain that spits out blue water that Madame Arpel turns on only when guests come by.

On the other hand, Hulot's world is the old world.  He rides a motorized bicycle and lives in the familiar quaint French landscape with cobblestone streets, horse-carriage carts, and open food markets.  Hulot is the friendly and considerate individual who sees the world around him, but has not quite been in-synch with the present.

The music in the film is quite significant when differentiating the two worlds.  Hulot's world rings with bells and jingles with a French feel of a sleepy town, while the Arpel's world is fast-paced and on the go-go, and rocks and rolls with sounds from the west.

As an added bonus, the DVD includes the 1947 15 minute short film, L'ecole des facteurs (School For Postmen), which posseses a Buster Keaton influence in most of the scenes, especially the one where Tati passes a group of bicyclists.

Overall, MON ONCLE is a comedic film that will delight anyone.  Indeed, the film has a Jerry Lewis feel of ""The Bellboy"" and ""The Ladies' Man"".  If you want a laugh a minute, this film will deliver the goods.",1150243200,19,2582,4.923787528868361

He visits his sister's house, which occupies a definite spot in one of the circles of Dante's Hell: the furniture is ugly and useless, the kitchen sounds like the insides of an auto repair shop, all the ""modern"" conveniences are eyesores and demonic. The movie consists of mostly all sight gags, some funny, others not. Tati is the French Chaplin: there's very little dialogue, he wears a set costume (raincoat and pipe), there are lots of weird background noises and pratfalls. There's a lot of subtlety here, too, (it's not the THREE STOOGES by a longshot), and a lot of care went into the little things - all of them visual, of course (Tati doesn't speak at all).

582005,5,630315350X,"I am just overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of the magnificent DVD restoration, by Criterion, of this fantastically funny, yet senstive and sympathetic film. I really couldn't believe my eyes--even as the opening credits were shown --- at the total clarity and warmth of the film's colourings. It looked as though Criterion had taken to film to the laundry and given it a good scrub-up and clean-up. I don't even remember seeing any print of this film with the same superior clarity.
The film has always been a great favourite of mine... I have never forgetten the fish fountain... the click-clack of the high heels on the paving stones and inside the house. And the highlight for me was always the two black heads looking out the oval wondows, and their movements seeming like two enormous eyes, watching every movement.
The film is a minor masterpiece on many levels. You can view it as a comedy; sometimes subtle, sometimes screamingly obvious.
On one level MON ONCLE can be viewed as an assualt on ""modernity :, the sterile technology, designed to make life easier but somehow seems to take away from the humanity of life.
There are obvious comparisons between MON ONCLE's "" quaint"" Parisienne suburb with its emphasis upon "" community living "" and village lifestyles ... and the bland isolation of the modern expensive lifestyle.
The ""digs"" at class distinction, when the fish fountain is only allowed to be displayed when people "" who count "", call at the house, but is switched off for tradespeople, and of course, MON ONCLE.
The quietly haunting theme music. The roving dogs motif which opens and closes the film, emphasises freedom --or lack of it.
Again another beautiful Criterion remastering. Now there's more to see and enjoy. And as I indicated at the beginning of this review, I found I kept losing track of the film's action, because I was forever sidetracked into just looking at, and admiring the marvellous colouring and "" cleanliness"" of the film.
If you love Jacques Tati and understand what he was all about, for even though he is mocking aspects of life, and life situations, his approach is sympathetic, sensitive and caring and you feel for and understand all the characters and what they are all about. And this is OK. It is just when they are thrown together that matters become tangled and poor MON ONCLE, just can't help putting his foot in it --- sometimes quite literally.
A quality DVD of a wonderful film. I think Criterion must really care about Film, to always present such perfect restorations. I bought this DVD and on the 3rd viewing, I was able to settle down and concentrate upon the films, its themes and pin-pricking comedy.",1107043200,,2664,4.806100217864924

Personally, I would take my money and spend it on the Marx Brothers or Fawlty Towers or The Office or Tatie Danielle or one of the other wonderful Criterion offerings.

He was poking fun at techies and their lifestyle. this is not the kind of movie that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat but it will display a side of the French that few did at that time period. If Tati did not elaborate the relationship between the characters that is because it was not his purpose, again people are used to experiencing certain kinds of feeling when they watch a movie and when they don't get it they feel as if the movie is boring.  You have to watch this movie as if it is the first you have ever seen and then you will experience the creativeness of the directors work.

Unfortunately, bonus features are few and between on this DVD, aside from an extra short film featuring Franois, the mailman character that Tati created and later used in his first feature film, Jour de fte. The only other feature is an intro by Terry Jones of Monty Python fame.
Now, all I'm missing is for Criterion to re-release Tati's Playtime (which I consider to be even better than Mon Oncle), hopefully without any screen size problem this time.

Another reason this film is so wonderful is that it is one of the FEW films made during the 1950s that shows a family living in a totally ""futuristic"" mid-century ultra modern home,  complete with pushbuttons and plastic cookware.... sophisticated humor perhaps, but virtually EVERYONE who I have shown this film to over the last 15 years I have owned it on VHS have been doubled over with laughter. It defintely deserved its ""best foreign film"" oscar! Oh, one more thing.... how terrific it is to have a comedy you CAN actually show children and without vulgar language, sex, or violence.

582053,5,630315350X,"In looking at the other reviews of ""Mon Oncle"", it would seem that people either love or hate this movie. From my 5-star rating, you can see that I am in the former category. I fail to understand how a film can be called boring, when it is so full of life, and witty observations. Rather than feeling that it was too long, I was sorry when it was over.
In ""Mon Oncle"", the well-meaning, but dim-witted M. Hulot comes face to face with modern living and technology. His brother-in-law is an affluent executive with a plastics company, and owns a state-of-the-art home, full of amazing gadgets. The house is also a tasteless nightmare, devoid of warmth and comfort, with a ""garden"" to match. You will not soon forget the atrocious fountain, with a huge, metal fish spewing water into the air--but only to impress important guests, of course. In this concrete monstrosity, the couple are also attempting to raise a small boy, who understandably has more fun away from the place, with his uncle Hulot.
Tati is constantly contrasting old-fashioned, small-town life with urban ""progress"". In addition to the ""house from hell"", we see the huge, boring factory where Hulot's brother-in-law works, and where he tries, with hilarious lack of success, to land M. Hulot a job. Meanwhile, back at the ranch--er house--we have the outdoor party scene, with a bizarre group of co-workers and neighbours desperately trying to look important and convivial. Of course, Hulot unwittingly undermines the whole celebration, with a little help from that hideous fountain.
There are a number of scenes of children being--well--children--playing tricks on unsuspecting people. Some scene-stealing dogs are also part of the mix.
The DVD is impressive--colours are excellent--the sound naturally is mono. There is a touching introduction by Terry Jones, the well-known director and Monty Python graduate. Also included is an early short film with Tati called ""School for Postmen"" which is very amusing--a nice bonus.
For those people who consider ""Mon Oncle"" to be a comedy masterpiece, I agree completely. If you like Tati and his unforgettable creation, M. Hulot, this disc has to be in your collection.",1076284800,80,2179,5.072423398328691
582054,5,630315350X,"In Jacques Tati's Mon Oncle, the sequel to Monsieur Hulot's Holiday, we meet the Arpels, who are scheduled, gadget-happy, ultramodern technology-obsessed in a classical effort to keep themselves ahead of les Joneses. Upwardly mobile doesn't even begin to describe them. Madame Arpel is so obsessed in keeping everything dust free, that at one point in the movie, she brushes her husband's suit, briefcase, and hat as he is walking to his car. She even polishes the car door handle after he gets inside. She waves after the departing car, a cloud of dust issuing from her dustrag.
In contrast, Madame Arpel's brother, the tall and gangly Monsieur Hulot (played by Jacques Tati), lives in a village square area where humanity is abuzz. There's the street sweeper, who never gets done because someone's always striking up a conversation with him. And there's a girl, not yet a woman, who seems to have a crush on Monsieur Hulot. Chez Margot, the cafe there, seems to be a haven, where someone says, ""Come on in, have a drink and a chat"" and people come out feeling wonderful.
The tall, gangling Hulot is a bumbler, unintentionedly so, but he's a nice guy. He gives candy to the girl standing at the door of his apartment building, he goes in for drinks at the pub, he picks up his young nephew Gerard from school and indulgently lets him play games that gets him dirty or in trouble if he were to get caught. Hulot is clearly uncomfortable being at his sister and brother-in-law's house.
Gerard, to the chagrin of his father, enjoys being with his uncle because he is allowed to be free, unshackled from his parents' lifeless, repressive, antiseptic, technological household. Once with his uncle, he plays pranks on people with the other kids, and enjoys crullers with sugar and jam from the local vendor.
This is clearly a struggle between two values: the technological progressives and the romantic conservatives. The contrast between the cold, antiseptic, technologically advanced home of the Arpels, and the lively simplicity of Monsieur Hulot's neighborhood. But it's also one of transition and change, of the change France underwent post-industrial change after the war. Gerard undergoes change, as does the girl who likes Hulot.
There is a party scene that demonstrates how chaos in an ordered system can quickly cause that system to degenerate. At the party, Arpel decides to give his brother-in-law a chance at the plastic factory, which is probably not the best career decision a supervisor could make.
Mon Oncle is also full of sight and sound gags, (hey, it's a comedy after all) such as the funny gargling fish fountain and the click-clack of the factory floor secretary and the swinging motion of her body. Other people laugh in funny ways, such as Madame Pichard, the wife of Arpel's plant manager. She seems a silly goose but at least she seems fun. And then there's the idyllic jazz score of piano and accordion, which permeates throughout the movie.
What can I say? A tried and truly enjoyable classic. Jacques Tati clearly favoured the old-fashioned village life as opposed to the concrete, steel, and plastic jungle. To conclude, Mr. Arpel says at one point that it's time for his brother-in-law to stop dreaming and get to work. Well, keep on dreaming, Monsieur Hulot and be yourself!",1041724800,43,3302,4.9087656529517

582056,5,630315350X,"Tati is undoubtably one of the great filmmakers of all time.  And this despite the fact that he only released three films under his total control (M. HULOT'S HOLIDAY, MON ONCLE, and PLAYTIME), all available now on Criterion DVD.  What is even more impressive is that, unlike the great Howard Hawks, who successfully directed movies of every genre, Tati's accomplishment was to sucessfully document the development of the modern world under the guise of three simple, light-hearted comedies.  From the whimsical near-silent classic HOLIDAY, to the clash of the modern with the traditional in MON ONCLE, to the crushing approach of metal and glass over the classical world in PLAYTIME, Tati made brilliant films that, while obstensibly comedies, offer some of the most insightful commentary on the joy of life to be found in cinema.  No movies I can think of are more deserving of DVD presentation.  Each film is a masterpiece that warrants repeated viewings (PLAYTIME being particularily challenging).
MON ONCLE, a popular favorite, and beautifully restored here in saturated colors, is a comedy that comments on the threatened loss of the enjoyment of the simple things in life due to the demands of the modern world.  Or at least those demands that have been self-inflicted.  It is just as prescient today as the it must have been in 1958, maybe more so.  Terry Jones' nice opening commentaries comment on Tati's carefully constructed sight-gags, but I find Tati's subtle commentaries on the modern world to be more interesting.  Note, for instance, that the workers who are perpetually demolishing older buildings are encroaching towards Hulot's charming neighborhood as the film progresses.
I cannot recommend Tati's films highly enough.  And for those who collect Criterion releases but are somewhat unsure of this sudden rash of releases by a relatively unknown French auteur, I say jump right in, and if you can't stand Tati's films after several viewings, e-mail me and I'll buy them from you!
