5462890,5,B00AO7HPSY,"The photography  excellent the story well written. Not for little children. Youth star has  motorbike, watercraft and is allowed to shirk chores for weeks with no accountability. Moral: lying leads to trouble. I hope these people do more like this. I will buy this",1370476800,4,264,4.9772727272727275
5462891,5,B00AO7HPSY,"I bought this for my niece and nephew, who are huge fans of the Sprouse Twins and Victoria Justice.  Although playing different characters than they usually do on Disney Channel and Nickelodeon, they did a really good job and made me a ""favorite uncle"".

I (along with my niece and nephew) would highly recommend this dvd.",1367712000,5,322,4.732142857142857
