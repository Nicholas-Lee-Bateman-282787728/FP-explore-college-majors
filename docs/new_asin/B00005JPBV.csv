1581070,5,B00005JPBV,I watched this last night on DVD. It was well-acted and suspenseful. It actually caused me to have a nightmare around 3AM so someone did something right.,1216512000,,153,4.703703703703703

1581072,2,B00005JPBV,"Although THE FLOCK has some pretty good acting by veteran Richard Gere, and some okay shots that might harken some back to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS days, the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere.

The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere) who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire. His office thrusts upon him his replacement, Allison Lowry (Claire Danes,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stardust/dp/B000WZAE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stardust</a>), who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with his job. And that job ain't very fun. He monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction. Allison goes with Erroll on many calls to check up on his ""flock"" of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement. But Erroll is good at his job even if his methods aren't. He taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. Erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants' pasts. It is this ""good justification"" that challenges the audience on some level, letting us see how brutal Erroll is and yet how out-of-touch he's become (by being too close to his job).

When a teenage girl goes missing in Erroll's ""area"", he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock. But how could he know? Is Erroll that good at his job? Allison challenges him and Erroll pushes back. Their battles become as fierce as Erroll's need to find this missing girl.

Although the set-up for the story was okay, it didn't have any umpf! I will give credit to Richard Gere, however, who plays the Erroll character very well. Battling retirement. Worried about everyone who's near his flock. Disgusted with those he's responsible for overseeing. Disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does. Quite a change in character portrayal for Gere. But beyond him there's not much else. Some of the sets are okay (dark and dangerous) but there are so many other problems as to be laughable.

I'll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films. But that suspension has limits. The biggest push against those limits is the destruction of EXTREMELY vital crime scenes. Someone as meticulous as Erroll would KNOW that moving a body would be a huge no-no. Or trampling through a crime scene. Or moving evidence. It went beyond and hurt the film to no end.

The other damaging part of this film is that we never get into Clair Danes' character, Allison. She's almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we're never privy to what her intension might be: Will she stay or leave? Will she end up like Erroll if she does stay?

This isn't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground, but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up.

P.S. The fact that this movie went straight to DVD and didn't get air time at cinemas in the U.S. is pretty telling. As is the fact that only three other reviews are up here at Amazon.com at the time of my posting.",1213660800,4,3146,4.858208955223881
1581073,5,B00005JPBV,I had never heard of this movie before released on dvd.  I had my doubts since I hadn't heard of it but WOW!!!! Sooooooo good!!,1211587200,,127,4.08
1581074,5,B00005JPBV,"I saw this movie and really didn't expect much coming in.  But Richard Gere delivered his best performance to date and Claire Danes supported him very well.  This is probably one of the most if not the most suspenseful movie I have ever seen.  While it is a little stomach wrenching at parts I started to gag, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Richard Gere deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie, and the cinematography is second to none.  I highly suggest this movie.",1197331200,26,480,4.348314606741573
1581075,3,B00005JPBV,"The following review refers to ""The Flock"" (105 minutes) released in Japan where I saw it in theater.

The story of ""The Flock"" centers around the case of a missing girl. Or girls perhaps, and some disturbing photos. The thriller has an undertone of ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" but in spite of its intriguing protagonist played by cast-against-type Richard Gere, ""The Flock"" is short on thrills, and some parts require an enormous amount of suspension of disbelief.

The most unique aspect of the film is the central role Richard Gere plays with slovenly appearance with unkempt clothes. Gere plays Erroll Babbage, veteran officer of department of public safety, monitoring paroled sex offenders. After 18 years of his work of supervising the registered offenders, Erroll, firm believer of his own theories about offenders, is not content with just visiting them and doing routine question. He cannot arrest them, but he thinks he can do something with his method, which is not exactly legal sometimes. Even his co-workers stay away from him, including his supervisor Bobby Stiles (Ray Wise). So in 18 days Erroll is to quit, or ""let go"" from the job.

To Erroll is sent an understudy Allison Lowry (Claire Danes). Erroll takes Allison under his wing and grooms her for the career as officer who can see through the ""public presentation"" of people. While training Allison, Erroll confides to her that he is convinced of one thing, believe him or not, that only he can know the truths behind the case of a young girl who suddenly disappeared.

As I said before, ""The Flock"" needs more suspense. Not many details are given about the missing girl (who might have just run away from home). Though Richard Gere is convincing as the man who is obsessed with his work, not much is told about the background of Allison either and her flat character weakens the master-pupil relation between them.

The film anyway keeps telling its story, fast-paced and stylish, with Gere's strong performance as its real power. However, ""The Flock"" becomes less and less credible in the second half. As it has something to do with sex offenders and Megan's Law, ""The Flock,"" it is obvious, has one very important topic in it, but the film's plot, which poses some intriguing questions about the law and morality, does not delve into them.

Director of ""The Flock"" is Andrew Lau from Hong Kong, known for his acclaimed ""Infernal Affairs"" (original of ""The Departed""), but internet site IMDb says Niels Mueller did uncredited re-shoot. I don't know which director is responsible, but the film, especially the opening, is full of jump-cuts, fast-forwards, double-exposures and other visual gimmicks that only help lessen the suspense. This unnecessary editing is regrettable because the cinematography itself is fine with the bleak landscapes (shot in New Mexico).

As to the role of Avril Lavigne as a young woman, it is not a big one. It is more like a cameo, and it is hard to judge whether her acting is good or bad.

And it is hard for me to judge the film either. During most of the time I was not bored, but that is not because of the slickly told but implausible story, but because of Gere's fine acting and the stylishly grainy photography and sinister atmosphere that reflects his character's mind. At the same time, besides the lack of suspense, I felt something is wrong with the film, which attempts to tackle one of the most serious issues, but somehow stops in the middle of the process.",1187740800,19,3476,4.84006734006734

But at the moment when they began to discover more clues concerning the disappearance of the girl I was hooked. i really enjoyed Richard Gere's character, which was hilarious at times because he was so bent on finding the killer, and he knew he was right, despite Claire Daines yelling at him. My favorite part was what he did in the car after he had snuck into her house. I won't say too much so as not to spoil it for people who haven't seen it yet. I also liked that Avril Lavigne did a cameo for the film. The theme was dark, but the storyline and characters were good. I liked it, plain and simple.",1386633600,,781,4.144736842105263

The blurb's interesting enough but for me, it was a simple story made complicated
Yeah, I know, real-life is like that

Got lost halfway through or maybe I just lost interest and was waiting for it to end

Like that Richard Gere's character carries a gun, although he's not supposed to
Like that his character is considered an odd-ball but he gets things done

Not much brilliance in this show, some ok bits

1581153,2,B00005JPBV,"Recipe for a good thriller: take an A-list Hollywood star, give him a gorgeous and gifted actress as a side-kick, make them work with sex offenders, add a serial killer, add a little part of Avril Lavigne, throw in some serious psychological and professional problems for the main character and make it all cook at high tempeature and under strong pressure of a strict deadline. With such a treat, logically one should be the next Iron Chef of Hollywood, no?

Well, NO! Because somewhere, quite early in the film, Andrew Lau forgot what exactly he was trying to do - and clearly he couldn't remember it until the end...

As the result we have a boring film, wasting the talents of both stars. Richard Gere's character,a civil servant making control visits of registered sexual offenders, is unpleasant,stressed, self-destructive and anti-pathic, but definitely not fascinating - in fact he is an annoying guy and watching him is frequently embarassing... His assistant and future replacement, played by Claire Danes, is a rather pale and pathetic person, hardly having anything interesting to say. The handful of sex offenders shown in the film are pretty pathetic people, which is probably how it is in the real world, but as the result they are simply boring!

The dialogs are weak, there is not even one moment of humour (even dark one) and the ""investigation"" of the main ""mystery"" is so annoyingly boring, that I had to fast-forward some parts of it. And Avril Lavigne makes just one extremely short cameo - and sorry for disappointing all the hopefuls, but she is very strictly and fully clothed in it... And, let's stress it again, Claire Danes is playing a pale side-kick, saying weak lines and just following the annoying and embarassing Gere's character. Frankly, wasting the potential of not one but two such good actors should earn Andrew Lau a place amongst the registered ""film offenders"" of Hollywood!

The only reason I give this film two stars is the character of Viola (played by KaDee Strickland), a female sex offender who seems to be a kind of Babbage's ""pet project"". Her appearances are the only moments when something interesting happens on the screen.

Some people compared this movie to the most excellent ""8mm"" but please believe me, those films have NOTHING in common! ""The Flock"" is a failed, boring film, which made me lose one evening - do not let it happen to you...",1352592000,,2398,4.867647058823529
1581154,2,B00005JPBV,"Richard Gere = 5 stars (and I never liked him as an actor til this flick (Pretty Lady.. give me a break), but here he SHINES! He is crazy and intense and PERFECT)
Claire Danes = 2 stars (in real life, I would feel bad for a whiny, easily frightened, naivete who somehow thought that patrolling sex offenders was the right career path. On second thought, no I wouldn't. Similarly, the producer/director has no excuse for either casting the wrong actress or directing her down the wrong path. She'd get one star, but that is reserved for Denise Richards' Bond girl portrayal)
Sets = 5 stars (dark, gritty, perfect for the film)
Plot = 1 star (the only comparable production to which to compare The Flock is CSI. In CSI, the ""crime scene investigators"" carry guns, do detective work, engage in harrowing showdowns with various mafiosi [depending on the CSI], etc. Here Gere et al pretend they are detectives and enjoy tromping through crime scenes, firing weapons willy-nilly, and conducting entire investigations without any sort of back-up. It worked for 7even where they were cops, but not here)
Oh and the spooky bad girl, Viola = 4 stars (scary and evil, not a 5 though; insufficient character development to be anything but EVIL, no shades of grey there)",1312761600,,1257,4.770642201834862

1581206,1,B00005JPBV,"Perhaps I'm a bit harsh on the rating because the acting was credible, but there is something about a film in which the suspense leads you over a cliff, jagged rocks awaiting your descent. The movie brushes upon moral ground, and it rubbed me the wrong way.

Claire Danes' role as a Fed agent paints a negative image of our law enforcement and in effect, illustrates the weakness of Americans when dealing with psychotic killers/pedophiles. Must we be so righteous in caring about the rights of murderers? That seems to be the message of this film. There is absolutely no resolve. No justice...no justice. Just think: what would Jack Bauer do? Feel pity for a murderer? Particularly those who torture, rape, and murder children? (Watch 24 and you will see what an agent should be made of.)

The movie's title should be renamed ""The Flock of Geese"" to represent America's justice system. Were this in China, such offenders would be executed, but we live in a country where people believe murderers deserve the same rights as any ordinary person. Unfortunately, the truth in this movie is that we do not effectively deal with murderers and pedophiles. And the climax of the film is not justified in the end. This particularly made me furious, and wasted my time. Therefore, 1 lone star.",1260921600,3,1284,4.8054298642533935

1581208,3,B00005JPBV,"There are almost as many things to really like in this movie as much as there are things to be repulsed by and to dislike.

The best thing it has going for it is a terrific performance from Richard Gere.  One of my guilty pleasures is THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, not because it's a great movie but I'm from that area and knew about the Mothman--and a really good performance from Richard Gere (for an off-the-wall supernatural movie that never quite gels, he gives a sincere depiction of grief and obsession that transcends the material).

In THE FLOCK, he's the burned-out monitor to his ""flock,"" his workload of sex offenders he has to keep tabs on.  He's done it for so long that he feels he can even sense when they're going to go ""off the reservation"" and commit more sex crimes.  And if he thinks that, he doesn't mind stomping them into the dirt.  Obviously, a very tightly-wound character who may or may not be someone to admire.

But that's the thing about this movie: I think a lot of people will be conflicted at one point or another.

Would anyone have a problem with Gere's character physically assaulting sex offenders for the entire movie?  Is he a monster for abusing his power for keeping them ""in line""?  Are any of them truly rehabilitated?  One genuinely evil character will leave wondering after the climax.  This is a movie that gives you a glimpse into deviant sex...and leaves you to wonder if it turns you on.

I like all of these elements to a good sexual thriller.

But there were things that I wasn't so crazy about.  I had a hard time believing that Claire Danes could take over his job.  There were too many times that she appeared as a damsel in distress, especially in this line of work!  The thriller structure was a little obvious toward the end but I'm not sure what else they could do with it.

All in all, THE FLOCK is worth seeing if you like movies like THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and SEVEN (successful) or 8MM (not-so-successful).  Dark, thoughtful, interesting.  Something that makes you look inside your own little tastes and kinks, if you have any.

Do you?",1245801600,,2094,4.530666666666667
1581209,3,B00005JPBV,"Sporting a cool name and a hot temper Richard Gere stars as Det. Errol Babbage, a man watching over his Flock of registered sex offenders. Errol's methods are  too harsh for his superiors so they give him one  month before they let him go. Babbage is a loner obsessed with his work, so when one of his sickos doesn't provide the right answers he thinks nothing of slapping him around or beating another with a baseball bat. When a young girl gets kidnapped and held hostage Errol loses it and  makes it his mission to bring her back before he shuffles off. Hoping to keep him in check his boss, (the great Ray Wise) assigns Errol a partner named Alison Lowry (Claire Danes). Babbage doesn't appreciate this so he breaks in his new partner by taking her to a sex dungeon where he rubs her face in how dirty and dangerous their job is. As more clues fall in to place Errol believes that one of his Flock whom he has tangled with before is behind this latest kidnapping. It's a genuine shame that more people aren't going to see this film since it was released Direct to Video. The directing by 'Infernal Affairs' Andrew Lau is solid and the performances he gets out of his cast are excellent. This is one of Gere's riskiest and best performances ever. Danes isn't bad it's just that her own work is overshadowed by Gere's powerhouse performance. The subject matter is  disturbing and graphic which can make this a tough film to watch at times.

I just had to write this review, for the sake of stating that I could not DISAGREE more with amazon editorial review.  That review claims there's sexual tension between Gere and Danes.  If there's, I completely missed it.  I was actually expecting for something sexual to develop between the two, but nope - the bond could not come off more asexual.  Another mindboggling editorial statement is that the movie ""condemns sexual deviance while depicting it in absurdly lurid and titillating ways (the scenes in a porn studio/fetish market are slathered with moral indignation but ooze with repressed lust)"".  What???  If I were that editor I would keep these revelations to myself.  Certainly did not find anything in the movie titillating - just utterly disturbing and nauseating.
In general, I found this movie great in a documentary/education sense.  It's good to be aware of what kind of people lurk out there and what they are capable of.",1245110400,,1174,4.888888888888889

I was amazed by the movie. Richard Gere, can play ANYTHING and make it come out good. I believe he did better in this, than he did in ""Internal Affairs"" and I believe that's saying a lot. While the movie is some what slow at first, it has to be. It has to get the people watching it, into what's going on. I feel that's hard to do, with the subject at hand.  Sexual predators is a very hard subject to do in a movie. It's a touchy subject. Anyone in ""real life"", who works with these people gets a feeling about them. I doubt that many of them act on it. That's what I love about this movie. I felt myself WANTING to do just what Gere's character did. I can't wait to get the movie for myself. I own ALL of Richard Gere's movies and I haven't be disappointed in any of them. I feel Gere should get an award for this movie, as it IS an out-of-cast character for him, and he plays it so well. I really don't understand the bad reviews that this movie got. I guess that some people expect too much. I just love to watch a movie just for what it is. Now I'm not saying, I haven't seen what I thought was a crappy movie. What ""I"" think is a bad movie. verses other people would probably start an argument.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Gere's character Erroll Babbage takes his job very seriously
2. A little TOO seriously if you ask anybody, including his superiors
3. Before they show him the door, they show him Allison Lowry (Danes) and give him a couple of weeks to train her in the job.
4. Her instructions are slightly different
5. A girl goes missing
6. Babbage takes it personally
7. Disjointed and improbable plot follows, filled with disgusting degeneracy, the glaringly obvious and the highly unlikely.

Even winning performances by Gere and Danes can't save this unworkable storyline, which takes them into the depths of depravity in the search for a missing girl. Good supporting performances are seen from KaDee Strickland, Russell Sams and Avril Lavigne.

Baggage: I think about a girl who's dead because I didn't look in a closet.

His methods for dealing with sexual offenders is very unorthodox, if not altogether controversial, and illegal according to department standards. Erroll Babbage is so out there that he has alienated himself from his co-workers and supervisors that he has been forced into early retirement.

He is driven by demons, some of which he no doubt had already, but lots of them from the stress and general thanklessness of the job. I like the scenes of the government offices, large rooms crammed with desks and a ceiling filled with fluorescent lights, just like in real life. Claire Danes, to me, is somewhat miscast as a young trainee. I just didn't believe her character. The bad guys are truly bad, and some of the scenes are really creepy, but I cannot object to them. The movie was shot in New Mexico, a nice touch. Richard Gere always surprises me by his acting. He really is believable in his roles.",1433462400,,697,4.453125

7942068,5,B00005JPBV,"I caught this movie on cable. It was a different type of Gere movie and when it was over I really didn't know what to think about it. Sometime later I spotted a copy of it in the Wal- Mart five dollar bin and bought it. The subject matter is stomach curnning and unfortunately exists in today's society. In the end, I'm glad that I own the movie",1423526400,,345,4.088235294117647
