8467089,3,B005DL6PS2,"I have mixed feelings about this release.  It's the closest I'm probably ever going to come to seeing Emma Shapplin in concert, so I'm happy for that.  And it's not a horrible production.  However, the DVD is nonanamorphic full screen, which means that it was not made for a high definition television.  It displays with bars on all four sides, like a frame around the picture.  If you have a zoom function on your player, you can fill up the screen, but that results in a significant loss of picture quality in an image that wasn't that great to begin with.  All that being said, however, it isn't a case of deception, as mentioned by another reviewer.  The back of the DVD gives no information as to the video or audio provided.  Although I hoped for something better, I sort of assumed it would be exactly what it is.  I'm hoping one day she'll put out a blu-ray of one of her concerts, but until then, this is the best it gets.",1453939200,,931,4.366279069767442

8467093,5,B005DL6PS2,"First of all, the 5 star rating is for ""Finally, a concert DVD of Emma...in good quality"". I've read that her first concert DVD, ""The Concert In Caesarea"", was in poor quality and a very short concert. I would not have mind the concert being short since she only had 2 full albums released to work with prior to that concert, but reviews stated many times that the quality is very poor, bad sound and picture. Plus, sellers are selling them for $25 or more, and I just can't see myself paying that much for such poor quality, so when I saw that this DVD was out since last year (I was searching on Amazon last week), I quickly ordered it, and a reasonable price at that ($15) compared to her first DVD. Got my DVD today, watched it this afternoon and it was AWESOME!!!!! I knew Emma is beautiful, but to actually see her perfom made my jaw drop! She is so stunningly HOT, and that voice just melts in your ears. Even though the concert was not in anamorphic widescreen, the picture quality is clear and colorful. Even though the concert was not in 5.1 or DTS surround, the sound quality is clear and good. Now, my only complaint is that there are no special featutres, like a documentary, videos, behind the scenes, just bare bones nothing on extras. But, oh well, can't really complain cause the concert itself is worth the money, almost an hour and a half concert. It does show Emma signing autographs to her fans outside at the end of the concert credits. Also I'd like to mention, before I watched this DVD, I never had heard any songs from her ""Macadam Flower"" album. Only because after her last album, 6 years had gone by and I hadn't checked on any new work from Emma till last week. When hearing her new songs on this DVD, I thought WOW, sounds AWESOME. Yes, totally different from her first 2 albums which is great, being also a Sarah Brightman fan, I can relate to this change on her new album. So I will be purchasing her new album after I finish this review. So, for the Emma fans please purchase this DVD, it is so a MUST for Emma fans. And if you like Sarah Brightman then you'll love Emma!",1335225600,,2104,4.342639593908629
8467094,1,B005DL6PS2,"I'm just outraged by the poor quality of this dvd... i'm in ccs venezuela i just bought it a few days ago for a birthday gift and I FEEL ASHAMED OF THE GIFT!!!

C'mon!!! One of the best voices of the planet with such a lame dvd production??? No angles... no subtitles... no extra data... NO EXTRA NOTHING! and worse of all DOLBY DIGITAL 2.0 !!! YES! 2 CHANNELS ONLY!!! And to think i bought the original because i didn't want to give a simple copy in a pendrive or dvd! I saw the file downloaded and inmediatly thought i've got to but the original on becase it's got to be much better in audio and video... WELL, SOUR PRISE!!! It's just NOT!!!

IT'S SUCKS OK... I'm sorry Emma, but i'm quite selective in buying original dvds and this is just NOT WORTH NOT EVEN 10 DOLLARS! Cmon!! 2012 and gonna edit a dvd in 2 channels? And the video effects... what the HELL was that? Who produced this? i've got concerts in laserdisc from the 90's with better production! DOLBY DIGITAL AC3 FOR CHRIST SAKE!!!

CONCLUSION: DO NOT BUY THIS. TOTALLY DECEIVED... BETTER PUT 20 BUCKS ON A TRASH CAN WITHOUT CONSUMING PLASTICS THE PRINTING AND ALL THE STUFF..............................",1332547200,3,1168,4.552380952380952
