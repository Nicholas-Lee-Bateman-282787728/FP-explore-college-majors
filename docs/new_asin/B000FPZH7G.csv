8125438,5,B000FPZH7G,"This black and white Zombie flix is really campy and intended to be so. It is not to be taken seriously at all. It is short and very funny. Whether you like Zombie movies or not, this will make you grin and grimace.

Good stuff as long as you take it with a dash of salt. . .but blood is pretty salty already.",1248998400,,309,3.9047619047619047
8125439,2,B000FPZH7G,"This odd entry in the low budget Zombie/Zomedy genre is actually well made with an appealing art house feel to it. Wonderfully, (even beautifully) filmed, GRAVEYARD ALIVE also features some competent acting with an interesting score and at times a fair script (which of course fails us at critical points). Not surprisingly the mix of Comedy and Horror falls well short of the mark, as such presents the toughest film art to master. I shall rely on the above product description for a plot synopsis, though basically this film depicts what happens in a love triangle when a female Zombie is the interloper. An uneven script, poor effects and the lack of credible carnage mar the finished product. Alas, GRAVEYARD ALIVE could not decide whether it was a chick flick or a Horror film. This is unfortunate as films of this ilk actually dilute the Horror element, while mutating the genre. In the final analysis, this is a boring picture, as the film maker squandered the potential to make an important entry in the Zombie field. While I can hear many New Age Horror fans grinding their axes, a violent contrast of sex and credible Zombie carnage would have worked far better, even if they were to retain the so-called ""Comedy"" element in this film. As in that rarest of ""birds"", the classic Horror/Comedy picture, AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON; sex and extreme violence (with much rot and gore) proved to be a winning combination. Had either element been diluted, that film would not have worked nearly as well. With respect to GRAVEYARD ALIVE, we have both elements diluted, plus a banal attempt at Comedy. Once again, artsy fartsies should love it, as well as other similar pretend fans of Horror.",1247961600,,1697,4.835051546391752
8125440,5,B000FPZH7G,"I have never been a fan of horror films but a friend suggested that I see this one and I am so glad I did.  It is a really great film!  It's in black and white which, for me, added to the overall eerieness of the film.  The film is organized into chapters and the story is easy to follow.  It is a horror film but there are some really funny parts and some scenes that make me laugh just to think abut them.  Not being familiar with zombies at all before this film it did a fantastic job of bringing me up to speed.  I loved the film and it is now my favorite in this genre.",1169424000,,574,3.8220338983050848
