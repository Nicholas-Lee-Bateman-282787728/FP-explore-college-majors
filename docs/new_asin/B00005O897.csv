7948526,4,B00005O897,"Greg Best is a great rider in his own right, and he is also a great teacher. In the video he is patient, clear, concise, and very effective in getting techniques across. I have all three tapes of this series and I think they're great.
Like the ""Basic Jumping"" video, Greg spends a fair amount of time on flatwork (appropriately). Again, he correctly states that jumping is essentially riding, just over a fence. And poor flatwork will only magnify problems over jumps.
The tape is definitely for an Intermediate Hunter/Jumper rider. I was also impressed that Greg discussed a more advanced topic; walking the course. If there was one theme to this video, it would be to prepare the hunter or jumper rider for the show ring.
As I've said in my other reviews, this whole 3-tape series is a great supplement to your riding classes. Additionally the entire set of tapes is something you can and should refer to every once in a while for a ""refresher"". I have been riding for over 10 years and I got several good techniques from this video.
I rated only 4 stars simply for the video quality and the Vogel boots ad. The video is good--but is essentially someone with a video-cam on a tripod. And the ad is just in poor taste--imho.
This video, and the entire set(3) is highly recommended though!",1075680000,3,1289,4.584415584415584
