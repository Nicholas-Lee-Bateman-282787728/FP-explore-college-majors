8591076,5,B00444690I,"This DVD is amazingly informative. Really a must see for anyone, especially someone thinking of having children, pregnant women, parents of Autistic children or any one with a family member with Autism, ADD, ADHD, eczema, etc. Dr. Renee Tocco has a way of explaining facts and information to you in this DVD that really breaks it down to levels of understanding the process of how the disease Autism is formed and even prevented. She gives you everything you would need or want to know about immunizations and toxins and how they effect you and your baby from the womb and long after. Her ideas and opinion on naturally aiding someone with the disease is honestly refreshing and I believe every doctor and physician should take something from Dr. Tocco and her brilliant advice. Pumping children full of immunizations and medications is only masking underlining issues. It really is beneficial information that I will continue to pass on. I was unlucky to have seen this DVD after my child was immunized and very lucky for her not to have been harmed. Get the DVD and if you ever get the chance to see her speak in person don't hesitate she is by far the best at what she does.",1289692800,,1177,4.663461538461538
8591077,4,B00444690I,"I'm a pharmacist and have seen Dr. Tocco present in person. I prefer her in person because you can feel her intensity and commitment.  The video doesn't do her justice and she  seemed a bit stiff and uncomfortable in some parts of the presentation. She did a great job, but she wasn't very animated.

The information Dr. Tocco presents on this video is very timely and relevant.  She explains the technical aspects of toxicity and epidemiology so that the layperson can understand the issues and concepts.  I was hoping she would comment on some of the studies that have been published refuting the connection between autism and vaccinations.  Anytime someone goes into the  pediatrician's office and complains about vaccinations, I'm sure this comes up.

I am so glad that Dr. Tocco and others are getting out the word that toxins are a major factor in our state of health today.  There are many intelligent physicians and pharmacists who have somehow overlooked the potential for toxicity in the materials we inject into patients.  The biochemists and toxicologists have long known the pitfalls of using things like mercury and aluminum in vaccinations, but somehow that information never translates into the end product.  Now look at where we are.

I would recommend you buy this DVD if you are a health care worker/provider or are a parent, parent-to-be, or grandparent.  I say this for several reasons. The information presented on what happens to mom and baby before and during the birthing process is quite informative and accurate.  It didn't occur to me that a cesarean birth would be more traumatic for the infant than a natural birth. I know that after I observed the birth of our last child by cesarean, I was surprised at how much pushing and tugging goes on.  No wonder the mother is sore when the anesthesia wears off.  What about the infant through all of this?  Dr. Tocco discusses this and who better to explain spinal trauma than an expert in the health and alignment of this critical structure.

The tracks on the health assaults of vaccinations, antibiotics and environmental toxins are rich with information and facts.  I was fascinated, and then became angry. There are certainly many more risks of vaccinations and antibiotic therapy than we are led to believe.  The interesting thing is that Dr. Tocco points out the risks in a manner that isn't accusatory.

Dr. Tocco uses the lecture format for this presentation. There aren't enough slides or other visuals to prevent long scenes of just Dr. Tocco talking.  She also spends some time explaining chiropractic and where this fits into the treatment of autism.  I would have preferred that she skip most of this because chiropractic doesn't explain the ""Explosion of Childhood Illness.""  If she were to issue a second video that was entitled ""The Role of Chiropractic in Childhood Illness and Autism"", then giving a detailed explanation of chiropractic care would be more appropriate. I understand that she is proud and committed to her profession.  I just thought it was off the subject and found it distracting. I watched the video to learn about her explanation of the reason for exploding childhood illnesses.

There were points in the DVD that it was appropriate to talk about the role of chiropractic.  During the discussion about childbirth trauma she was talking about subluxations and adjustments.  Since she mentioned it, it might have been nice to see a slide or two of what a subluxation looks like. I'm a visual person and a picture would have helped explain what she is discussing.

I gave this video 4 stars. I really think it is 4 1/2 stars with a slight ding because of the side trips explaining chiropractic.
