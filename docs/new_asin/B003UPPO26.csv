4207318,5,B003UPPO26,"I was on a search for ""Out of the Blue"" on DVD and discovered it on Amazon. At the same time, I purchased ELO ""The Early Years"" on a whim.  The sound quality is excellent and it truly does take you back to before their Laser & Spaceship Concerts.  I have been a fan of Jeff Lynne & ELO and have seen them in concert numerous times.  It will bring back memories of great music.",1301702400,,376,3.986666666666667
4207319,5,B003UPPO26,This video shows how good the individual musicians were in the group. It is from before the giant arena laser spectacle era and feels very personal compared to the later extravagant concert staging. Thoroughly enjoyed the video and highly recommend it.,1296432000,,252,5.170731707317073
4207320,5,B003UPPO26,"Finally, a DVD that shows ELO in their prime. How they rocked with that classical sound! Wait no longer my friends. THIS is the one to get. ELO steps up and leaves the excesses out [that later clouded their performances]. I hope this is the first of similar releases for one of my favorite 70's bands.",1294617600,,301,4.392857142857143
4207321,5,B003UPPO26,"It was great to have this video remastered to DVD properly great sound and I couldn't find this CD anywhere else Thanks again Amazon, my favorite place to shop GREAT products, fast shipping and packaging, fantastic prices overall I see Amazon unbeatable, compared to other related sites.",1290470400,,287,5.127659574468085
4207322,3,B003UPPO26,"Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) have been one of the most successful rock bands down the line for many years now. Formed in 1970 by Jeff Lynne  and Roy Wood from the ashes of their band The Move, once Wood had left Lynne (quickly!) led the band to international acclaim.

'Electric Light Orchestra - Live: The Early Years' is just that - a  triple concert trip down memory lane. Featuring excerpts from three 70s' performances, the first of the three (Brunel University, 1973) is filmed before a small crowd. With no lead in, Jeff Lynne gets the boys ready and off we go, into 'King of the Universe.' Bathed completely in a red light thoughout, the sound is, as expected, lush, orchestral and as soon as Lynne's voice hits the mic, completely and utterly ELO!

A nice, rocky intro bring us a studio-sounding 'Ma-Ma-Ma  Belle,' before both 'In The Hall Of The Mountain King' and (weirdly) 'Great Balls  of Fire.' Standing at just under 20 minutes the whole set, it may not be the longest one recorded, but come the end the red lighting was doing my head in anyway!

Next up, and we find ELO in Germany, at Rockpalast in 1974. Once we have dispensed with the Rockpalast neon logo intro, we plunge straight into the keyboard intro to 'Daybreaker.' Feeling more, and looking more like a session from the UK's Old Grey Whistle Test, up next is the emphatic 'Showdown' and the little-heard, little-known fiddle tune 'Orange Blossom  Special' (Ervin T. Rouse). Lynne intros Mik Kaminski and he obliges by giving us one monkey of a fiddlin' tune to behold.

Another rendition of 'Ma-Ma-Ma Belle' is followed by another rendition of 'In The Hall Of The Mountain  King' (but this time, the difference is that Lynne asks for the lights to be down BEFORE the start of the number), and yup, you guessed it, another rendition of 'Great Balls of Fire'! I guess, back then, they didn't have the depth in cataloge to bring forth. Coming in just under 25 minutes at least it's longer than the Brunel session, but not by much!

Last up is the longest concert, this time from London, at Fusion in 1976. Now on a much larger stage, better lighting, better sound techs, a drum set with their name on, a costumes much more suited to their '70s stage personas, they begin with the fast-paced 'Poker,' before heading into the much slower 'Nightrider' and (once again), 'Showdown.'

Lynne, for the first time that I've personally ever seen him, sports a goatee, an all white Elvis-styled outfit, and brings all his stage knowledge to bear on the brilliant, truly orchestral 'Eldorado Overture.' Which slides beautifully into the slow 'Can't Get It Out Of  My Head.' 'Poor Boy (The Greenwood),' sung by Lynne and bassist Michael D'Albuquerque, is next with the rockin' 'Illusions in G  Major' and etheral 'Strange Magic.'

The trippy, bathed in yellow/orange '10538 Overture' comes next. Another Lynne/D'Albuquerque-sung moment, what a great, catchy, perfectly written psychedelic melody with beautifully placed vocal harmonies this song really is. Blending straight into 'Do  Ya,' we then get to one song known by all - all that might not have known any of the previous ELO songs, anyway! 'Evil Woman,' perhaps the best-known ELO song from their so-called classic period, is a great bouncy number, and leads us to the fina song of the night, yup, once again, 'Ma-Ma-Ma Belle.'

The special feature is a Rockpalast interview from 1974. Controlled by a nervous, long-haired, heavily-mustached German (and yes, there are also German subtitles here, for those inclined to follow along from the Homeland), first up to chat is bassist Michael D'Albuquerque - who reveals he had only worked a few days in the business before joining ELO!

There are LOTS of awkward pauses in this oh-so-quiet studio interview with the entire band, but the always-jovial funster Jeff Lynne attempts to keep things moving along. Mik Kaminski jokes he saw the advert to join the band in the Sporting Life, (the late) Mike Edwards tells us he was studying at the Royal Academy of Music when he got the 'weird' phone call one day to come and join the band. The highly-animated Jeff Lynne reveals he was actually a cheat, as he didn't have any auditions to be part of the band - as he founded the group!

Rick Panell tells us he is the Sound Engineer and , hilariously, the hairdryer repairer! Hugh McDowell reveals he's being playing electric cello for longer than he can remember, and when asked his current age, yep, you guessed it, can't remember! Bev Bevan makes us all aware that he is the other founding member of the band, and calls himself the drumist!

Just before we get to the last member seated, Richard Tandy (who joined the band early on also, and never looked back), someone asks, 'Where's Roy Wood, that's what I want to know?!' He is quickly, and loudly ""shushed"" by Lynne ... classic!

Sadly, Mike Edwards, one of the early members of this British rock ensemble, died just  recently, with bassist Kelly Groucutt, who joined the band after the 'El Dorado' album passing just some 3 days later.",1286409600,23,5054,4.785057471264368
4207323,5,B003UPPO26,"I'm a big ELO fan from way back.  I'm glad they finally got ELO in their early stages.  I just got word that Mike Edwards their flamboyant cellist from 1972-1975 was killed September 3rd by a large runaway bale of hay on one of the english highways. I'm glad I get to finally see him perform here.  Mike was 62 years old, R.I.P. Mike.",1283731200,4,334,4.1875

4207325,5,B003UPPO26,"When I found out the US release was editing out not only the two versions of Roll Over Beethoven, but Daytripper as well, I decided to go over to Amazon UK and buy their version. I am SO happy I did.
Price was basically the same. And the best is that it's in the NTSC format, which means it will play on any US DVD player. I am very very satisfied with this product. And while I don't want to take sales away from Amazon US, you simply must have the entire product the way it was meant .
I would like to add my respects on the passing on one of ELO's original cellists Mike Edwards who passed away Sept 3, 2010. I was also fortunate to have had the pleasure of attending 3 ELO concerts in the early/mid 70's with Mike playing cello. This DVD now represents a fitting and timely tribute to him.
Rest In Peace, Mike.

4207326,5,B003UPPO26,"I give this 5 stars because I applaud the official release of this material finally after all of these years.  BUT, the U.S. version is missing 2 versions of ""Roll Over Beethoven"".  If this bugs you (as it did me) order the unedited DVD from amazon.co.uk.  Of course if you do this, you'll have to have a way of playing a PAL dvd which is typically not a problem with newer DVD players / TV sets.  UPDATE: Cool, the version sold on amazon.co.uk is in NTSC.  I just received the DVD and it's way cool.",1281916800,42,500,4.221052631578948

4207337,5,B003UPPO26,"This is ELO at the height of their prowess, when they were so good I feel sorry for any band who had to follow them.  I refer mainly to the phenomenal live at Fusion concert.  The other performances were great but it is the Fusion piece that really stands out.  This concert is definitive ELO and superior to the over produced live at Wembley concert.  That is just what makes this so great.  It is actually LIVE!  The bands set list is great.  Each number is done with a raw energy and much passion.  This is one of those concerts that if you are a fan, you don't want it to end.  how I would have loved to have seen the boys go into tracks like Fire On High or Tightrope.  Oh well beggers cant be choosers.  I am happy something this good still exist from this particular era and has been put on DVD.  If you like the band than this DVD is a must!!!",1420761600,,851,4.0602409638554215

4207343,4,B003UPPO26,"It was great seeing the changes made those years, not only the change in violinists, but the changes in their performances overall.  The stages got bigger and bigger and the performances got better and better.  The recordings were a little rough in places, but overall, pretty good.  My husband remembers seeing them around the time of the last performance on this DVD, when ELO was the opening band for Badfinger.  It brought back many memories to the time my husband was only 18 years old.  It took less than two years for ELO to then become the headliner act.",1408406400,3,562,4.636363636363637

4207349,4,B003UPPO26,It amazes me how hard our musical groups had to work to have a great performance (HIT) back in the 70's. This Concert showed everyone!  The audio and visuals compared to TODAY'S performances weren't as advanced but I WAS THERE! Thank You!,1370995200,,238,4.666666666666667

4207353,1,B003UPPO26,"The performances were lackluster, the first venue and performance was like watching a local (no offence intended for local bands)band practicing in their garage.

Very low quality sound through out.",1351555200,5,198,5.6
4207354,4,B003UPPO26,"This amazing DVD proves that ELO were an exciting live act in the 1970s, and were quite different on stage than in the recording studio. The DVD contains excerpts of three different televised concerts over a four-year period with some overlapping material, and it's fascinating to see how ELO evolved from a somewhat freaky band into a very polished mainstream rock unit. Throughout, the musicianship is exceptionally high and since these are live performances rather than Jeff Lynne's studio extravaganzas, the band really gets to stretch out and make some real noise. It's easy to overlook the role of strings in the band as practically everyone uses string sections as ""sweetener"" in the studio, but it's another thing entirely to see Mik Kaminski playing his blue violin and to know that he and the two cellists were actually integrated into a rock band and not used for ambience.

This video should put to rest the really nasty rumor that ELO couldn't really play live and just mimed to prerecorded tapes. ELO are one of those bands that did incredible business in the 1970s. ELO did use backing tapes for certain arrangements later in their career for things that are difficult to perform live, but you won't see any evidence of this here because these are ELO's early days.

I've no idea why this DVD doesn't have ""Roll over Beethoven"" and ""Day Tripper"" included here as in the UK version. If those songs are important to you - and it should be stated that ""Roll over Beethoven"" was one of ELO's first major hits - then you should order the UK version of this video. If not, buy this one but you owe it to yourself to track down clips of the band playing both those songs on YouTube.

I don't know if there's such a thing as a casual ELO fan nowadays given the relentless attack on their reputations by several rock critics over the past 30 years, but if you are a casualist you might complain over the somewhat repetitious set lists represented here. (""Ma-ma-ma-Belle"" and ""Showdown"" are among the songs played more than once). If you're a die-hard like I am, you'll appreciate how the band's approach to the material evolved in a very short time and be amazed at how Jeff Lynne really rocked a a guitar player which is something you don't usually associate with him.",1326326400,8,2275,4.6825
4207355,5,B003UPPO26,"I have been a fan of ELO for many years and after watching the DVD ZOOM which is a very good show I decided that I wanted to see some of the older shows.
