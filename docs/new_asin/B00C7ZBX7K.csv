8578511,3,B00C7ZBX7K,"Ok, If you're looking at this you probably know this film is The Mercenary aka A Professional Gun.  The film is great.  The issue here is amazon, really.  I have no idea why they released it under this title.  I had been looking for a decent release of the flick and when I read a review of the 2 pk I mentioned earlier it's said that the amazon, made to order release transfer is widescreen and damn good.  When I noticed this was actually the same film undera different title I assumed that it would be the same transfer.  Not so.  After watching the horrible transfer(4:3 ratio) I've come to the conclusion that this might be a cut, made for tv version.  There are a few pieces of evidence but I won't go into it.  If you're looking for a good ntsc copy of The Mercenary, buy the amazon 2 pack.  Don't be cheap like me and try to save $5 because God's Gun is worthless.  Spend the extra $5er.",1378598400,8,895,4.205882352941177
