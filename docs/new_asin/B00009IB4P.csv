7990769,4,B00009IB4P,"In a nutshell, this movie is another cheesy ""standard old school kung fu movie"", but for me that's not a problem. Seeing some of the actors I've come to recognize in various kung fu films always makes me laugh and this is yet another old school classic. Bruce Lee does make an appearance, of sorts, but in general this reminds me of the ""Kung Fu Theatre"" films I grew up watching.",1379289600,,380,4.366197183098592
7990770,5,B00009IB4P,"Bruce Lee makes a brief appearance in this vintage martial arts action drama, which stars his longtime friend and mentor Unicorn Chan. A must for Bruce Lee fans.",1358208000,,161,4.785714285714286
7990771,1,B00009IB4P,"The movie ""Fist of Unicorn"" is complete garbage, badly made and rottenly acted (at one point, there is a stuttering duel of all things). The fight scenes are not very impressive, despite choreography by Bruce Lee. In the English version, Bruce Lee is supposedly showing off to Unicorn Chan in the opening sequence but, wouldn't you know, they use a double! Unicorn himself is not much of an actor, but he is a graceful fighter.

What is really pitiful is the DVD itself: there is no trailer for the film, despite user comments, only trailers for ""Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth"" (shown twice!) and other Bruce Lee rip-offs (even a trailer for a Ron Van Clief film). The documentary of stunt men who knew Bruce is translated by someone with a lazy drawl for a voice - you'll think it was intended as a joke. The only plus is the 72 photos of Bruce shown - for that, buy a book of pictures of the martial-arts master but not this film.",1100908800,3,931,4.412790697674419
7990772,5,B00009IB4P,"I saw this film in 1976 and could only recall some rare snippets of Bruce in the film. I was completely blank on the rest of this movie.
This package presentation is top of the line. Two versions are presented. The original Chinese release print in lovely widescreen and an English version(the one I saw in theatres) in Full Screen format.
The subtiltes on the chinese edition are somewhat small. They would have been better to add new titles in the borders.
The English version has a misaligned framing,so a portion of the film is on the bottom instead of the top. It's still watchable,but a bit annoying at first.
The footage of Bruce Lee in the films is minimal. The English version has a bit extra,which might explain why both versions were included.
Bonus materials are abundant. An incredible photo gallery of shots from 1972 which explain what Bruce Lee was doing in what would be the most productive year of his life. Little time is spent on Fist of Unicorn and focuses instead on Way of the Dragon and Game of Death(Bruce apparently made Unicorn in between these two).An excellent archive of materials.
The original trailer for Unicorn is quite good. A great bonus for sure.
The main source of footage is a mini-docu entitled Last Day of Bruce Lee. It is 15 minutes of pure Bruce Lee.
Another more recent mini documentary included is Fight Scenes the Bruce Lee way,with Bruce Lee's assistants explaining and demonstrating how Bruce Lee staged his fights. Also anecdotes on the man and his movies. Excellent material.
There is no audio commentary on this DVD,unlike Death by Misadventure and The Young Bruce Lee(see my reviews).
Overall a great package of rarities and oddities on Bruce Lee.",1060560000,,1699,4.782312925170068
