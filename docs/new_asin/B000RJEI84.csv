2868485,4,B000RJEI84,"Saw the original, and loved it.  My then girlfriend liked it too, artsy, but non-threatening.  This transfer wasn't a great one, so it remained very grainy, where the original was just soft-focus.  Otherwise a beautiful indy-style film from an outstanding photographer.  Nudity?  Grow up, it's what I remember from past girlfriends, and I grew up mostly in the military in the Conservative South.",1363392000,,396,5.222222222222222
2868486,3,B000RJEI84,I'm not quite sure why it seems to be impossible to find a movie within this genre that does not intermit either slap-stick comedy or overt violence. This film would have been better without the added attempt at stupid humor. The story is quite interesting and plausible. The eroticism is more romantic than explicit.,1344470400,,317,4.888888888888889
2868487,4,B000RJEI84,This is 90 minutes of fun from beginning to end. You do not have to refer to the sub-titles in order to understand the French.,1337731200,,126,4.08
2868488,3,B000RJEI84,I thought the story was in good taste and well made. I would like to see more of Hamilton Movies. I was glad that the story was not field with a lot of porn.,1335571200,,157,3.6470588235294117
2868489,4,B000RJEI84,"This IS a David Hamilton film. He is considered a ""notorious"" director, but frankly most of his films are so notorious I can barely stay awake watching them. This film has a WWII period setting and it is surprising long on plot for a David Hamilton film (where the ""plot"" is often just an excuse to get from one naked nubile girl to the next). Still while the very lame ending is true to his usual form, the highest compliment I can pay this film is that it is a typical mediocre French film of that era for most of its running time. Hamilton was considered a great photographer and if you enjoy his typical slather-some-more-vasoline-on-the-camera-lens visual style, you'll probably enjoy this.

The Naturist aspect of his film is fitted to his vision, fairly so, however a more realistic and authentic view of nudism is found in the DVDs here on Amazon like Mother Naturists and Rituals of Summer -- the later being a personal favorite.",1280016000,8,938,4.650602409638554

2868491,4,B000RJEI84,"Interesting coming of age story of Julien, and his love for his cousin, who loves someone else.  Along the way, he gets ""experience"" in the ways of love, from many women.  There's a bit of love in the air, and everyone, nearly, seems to get in on the action.  Not a bad little film, not a classic, with attractive people.  I was lucky enough to find a region ""0"" disc that would play in my ""Cyberhome"" disc player, as this might not, even though it's region free, and most of the previous versions were Region 2, which would definitely not do so.  [Aside:  I understand, to a point, the idea of region coding, to protect copyright and all, but with the access people have nowadays, on the internet, it seems a bit pointless.]  Anyway, a decent little film.  [Not for those who might be offended by sex and nudity.]",1427068800,4,814,4.416107382550336

2868494,4,B000RJEI84,This one is more enrich in story and has a sort of historically part that had to do with one of the two World Wars as well as the time period of the story. Once again it has the Hamilton signature and I would say it was a pretty good movie overall.,1405728000,,248,3.7884615384615383
2868495,5,B000RJEI84,"Ok, picture this.  You are 14 years old and live on a farm.  War breaks out and all the men on the farm and the surrounding village are sent off to fight.  You find yourself surrounded by women and girls.  As the only ""man"" around, naturally, you start getting a lot of attention.  So far, this sounds like every teenage boy's fantasy, right?

Too bad life is not that simple.  Sometimes, the attention you're getting is not coming from the one you want.  And the one you want, wants none of your attentions.  Our young man, Julien, is in love with his cousin.  But the cousin is in love with an older man, who went off to war.  She does not take him seriously.  That is the plot of this movie.

Lots of teenage romance, some light drama, and a pretty good dose of comedy.  Highly recommended.",1394582400,8,793,4.3061224489795915
2868496,5,B000RJEI84,"I have first heard and seen this  title years ago in Playboy. They had an article on it with some stills from the movie. The next time, was collection of stills from the Movie plus addition stills in a coffee table book. I finally caught the movie on Cinemax and had taped it. It was years later that I was able to buy a Tape and now I have the DVD. This movie was enjoyable on several levels. One, it had an element of comedy in it which kind of tempered the darknesss of the times. It had a pretty decent, although maybe a tad shallow, story. The DVD quality was very good all things considered. Unlike the others I have, A Summer in St. Tropez. Bilitis, & Premiers Desirs, this one was not through New Star. Anja Shute ( Julia ) was, in my opinion, the show stealer. She is a cutie. She was also able to show a range of emotions, which was good. Julian wanted Julia, but she wanted Charles and Charles wanted anything in skirts. The female hired help had a thing for Julian ( lucky kid ). It sounds a bit convoluted, but isn't really. Just life on the farm  I guess. There is Nudity, but not an over abundance of it and it is done tastefully. There is also some implied sex. For me, it is a fun movie that I still like to watch from time to time.",1384905600,15,1249,4.093877551020408
2868497,4,B000RJEI84,Easy to follow coming of age movie set in pre-WWII France. Mediocre script and acting with lots of female nudity and very little male nudity. Some parts of the plot have holes but can be overlooked. Movie plays out like a teenage boys fantasy.,1380844800,4,243,4.545454545454546
2868498,3,B000RJEI84,"If one is familiar with David Hamilton's movies, they already know that all are short on story and dialogue, and strong on soft erotic portrayal of the characters (especially the female characters). So, briefly, its the story of the people in a french village at the beginning of the first world war, and the impact of the war's beginning on this village, and especially on the coming of age of the 1 young man who is suddenly the only ""man"" remaining in the village after the other men go off to war.",1379289600,,501,4.456521739130435
