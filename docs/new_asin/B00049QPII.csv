2156065,5,B00049QPII,"WOW! This morning my left hand was swollen from carpal tunnel and my middle finger has a tendency to lock. I just did the qigong from start to finish and got on the computer. As I was waiting for the effect to kick in, I noticed that the swelling in my hand was gone, my carpal tunnel was not bothering me at all and the locking finger had been released. This is truly amazing! As I was doing the exercises I was trying to keep an open mind. They just seemed so easy that I was afraid that they wouldn't work. But there is something about the mind body connection that really makes this all worth while. This is the perfect complement to my yoga dvd's and I will use it often. What a great discovery!

2156067,5,B00049QPII,"This is one of my favorite exercise videos.  Not only is it an effective video for an enjoyable work out, it also works well in portions for a warm-up or cool down to other workouts.  I first learned to coordinate breath and movement from this video. I use the self-massage techniques daily (usually in the shower). I also incorporate the exercises taught in the video in my other workouts.  The production quality is excellent and the video is shot in the mountains of colorado giving a very pleasant background to view during the workout.

2156068,5,B00049QPII,"I just received and viewed this two disc set from Amazon.  It is a perfect starting point for anyone interested in Quigong and its health benefits.

There are two discs.  The first is a set of basic Quigong excercises.  Each excercise is its own chapter on the DVD so it is easy to locate a specific exercise.  You can then repeat your viewing of each individual exercise instead of having to view the entire set in serial order to get to the exercise you want to learn.  It makes it easy to watch each exercise and view it many times so that you can easily learn to do it yourself.

The second disc is an award winning documentary (aired on PBS) about Quiqong.  The author, Francesco Garripoli, had a background in Western Medicine.  He sold all of his belongings and travelled around China in search of its ancient healing mysteries.  He visited such arcane places as the Shao Lin temple in China which is the Taoist origin of Quigong (Kung Fu or White Crane Chi Kung).  The interviews are succinct, yet, fascinating.  The imagry is an important record of China in transition.  The documentation of Quigong, and, its effects on China and the Western World, emphasizes not only its many benefits to society (as an alternative system of health care), but, also the freedom it bestows on individuals wiling to empower themselves with Quiqong to take responsibilities for their own health.

I have practiced Quigong for about five years.  I needed this DVD for review as I will soon be instructing beginners.  This is not only a great DVD for beginners, it is also a great DVD for those needing review of the basic 18 exercises.  It includes Shao Lin self-massage techniques which form a basis for personal health maintenance in Quiqong.  It is also an excellent resource tool for instructors as it shows Francesco and Diasy Lee almost flawlessly performing the exercises in a way that makes it easy for beginners to learn.

I will recommend this DVD for my class in lieu of a texbook.",1116979200,615,1983,4.662824207492795
2156069,5,B00049QPII,"Here's one of many emails we been receiving from happy customers:

Dear Francesco and Daisy,

I just love your DVD.  I can't say enough about the quality of the production, the clarity of instruction and the energy value of the various forms.  Many of the movements, including the massage and stimulation exercises at the end of the program are similar to what I've been practicing, so it's a definite validation of the universal understandings and practices of Qigong around China and throughout the world.

I wanted to thank you, applaud you, and say again that we look forward to meeting you at some future time.  Take good care and I hope each day is a beautiful day for you both.

2156088,2,B00049QPII,The last Gaiam DVD I ordered I donated to the library since I had to listen to a lecture at the beginning of the DVD.  There was no way to skip it.  this one has a short lecture at the beginning.  My problem with it is that neither of the people are turned back so that when he says left it is not to my right.  If he had not made an issue of left and right I could have dealt with it.  As it is I have not watched the DVD all the way through and may never.  It might end up as another donation or a good hammer project.,1445385600,2,520,3.6396396396396398

2156120,4,B00049QPII,"The one major flaw is in the DVD, not the program.

When I first bought this the chapter selection din't work, so I couldn't skip right to a specific exercise segment. Then my player died.  When I put the DVD in the new player the chapter selection worked fine. Inexplicably the chapter selection works in some players, but not in all.

The program itself is very well done. Qigong is physically similar to Tai Chi or Yoga, and uses imagery to channel Chi during each movement. Warm ups and the basics are covered nicely.  The main section demonstrates 18 different exercises. It encourages a viewer to choose one's own order, and to develop a personal style.  Facial and body massages are also included.

This was my introduction to Qigong, this stile suits me nicely.",1396915200,2,769,4.701492537313433

There are 3 into exercises,  a set of 18 short routines, and a nice shao lin massage routine at the end....which could be done by itself. There is also an interesting dvd about Qi gong in China made by Francesco as a documentary included. I really enjoy Francesco and Daisy's approach to qi gong and this is a high quality and flawless dvd.",1393977600,3,595,4.4

2156124,3,B00049QPII,"The Garippolis present a beautiful dvd, but two things take away from its quality.  First, they perform the moves in such a way that one is required, at times, to flip-reverse in one's head what is being asked.  Compare to Lee Holden, who always mirrors the moves for you.  It may not appear to be that significant to some, but I find that it diminishes one's state of relaxation when one is required to reverse the moves in one's head.  Second, though it is beautifully presented, the gaps in the routine due to captioning the next move makes for a very choppy experience.  One has to continually wait while the move is ""advertised"".  Again, this is very unfavorably compared to Lee Holden's seamless presentation.",1392076800,4,715,4.725806451612903

2156126,5,B00049QPII,"I wanted to give people considering this but were unsure or skeptical a testimony, per se, from a guy who was just like you. A brief description of how I came to Qigong.
I was recommended Qigong by my acupuncture guy. Acupuncture is amazing and I recommend everyone try it at some point in your life. You might be surprised what it helps you with. It is good for so many things, but especially anything muscle, pain, or nerve related. It's also not as bad as it seems. Take it from a guy who really hates needles and was dreading it. I got to where I would look forward to it. You don't actually feel the needles either. What you might feel is muscle tightness or loosening. Also energy movement sometimes, which can be weird. He had two needles in me the first time I went before I even realized he had started. Acupuncture helped me in a time my back was so messed up I couldn't sit up straight, was hunched over, was in pain all the time, couldn't work, and couldn't sleep very much. It opened me up to the world of energy/Qi. He helped me when doctors couldn't. My pain was lessened on the first visit and was gone on the third. I was amazed. When you're in enough pain long enough you will start to get desperate to do anything that helps it go away.
Looking back I'm glad I went through it because it opened me up to the things that have helped me on a weekly basis to feel better. Qigong! I had asked him about Tai Chi as something to do to help with my muscle problems, and PTSD. He told me about Qigong and told me I would be better off trying it first since it is easier for the average person to learn. I have no doubt that Tai Chi is great too, but from what I've noticed it's a lot harder. Especially if you're not very flexable and not in the best shape. Like me. Tai Chi came from Qigong. Qigong is the parent of Tai Chi, I guess you could say. To explain the differences between the two takes someone more knowledgeable than me on the subject. What I do know is that Tai Chi seems to be longer fluid patterns that take more time, practice, and effort to learn. Where Qigong is shorter patterns, is way easier to learn, and is very effective. Qigong is great for clearing blocked energy channels, strengthening your immune system, helping with pain and disease, and helping to balance your emotions. It will help a person feel calmer and balanced.
 I looked at quite a few different Qigong videos to buy when I was trying to get into it. I decided on this one for three reason. I read that it was very good and easy for people in the West to understand because the guy in the video is from America and has a background in Western Medicine. It has the best documentary on Qigong that there is in the West. It is very informative, interesting, and shows the true power of Qigong. In the documentary he has different Qigong masters from different places and there is some amazing stories about the power of Qigong and how it is being used to heal around the world. The third reason is because I read about his life story and what brought him to doing and teaching Qigong. It is truly a amazing and inspirational story that really shows the power of this art. It is practiced by people of all kinds of different races, and religions.
I recommend anyone with stress and anxiety check out their Qigong for stress relief as it focuses purely on that. It has helped me on a weekly basis. This stuff was a little out of my comfort zone at first but I'm so glad I got into it. I promise you if you keep a open mind and just give it a try you will not be disappointed. I hope it helps you as much as it has me. It is basically all about stretching, breathing, and moving Qi to heal the body. In my opinion it is better than yoga, and Tai Chi. I also recommend to anyone that want to read more about the difference between Tai Chi and Qigong check out this website:

A friend suggested I give Qigong a try and after some research, ordered this DVD. I love it. The music is soothing and the scenery in the background is inspirational. But the most important part is the instruction and demonstration and those are handled exceedingly well. It's very easy to follow the instructor's (Francesco and his wife Daisy) movements. Those with no martial arts experience should have little to no difficulty learning the moves. Like Tai Chi, I feel more rested and refreshed after finishing the practice than I did when I started. I've purchased 4 copies of this DVD over the years and given a few of them away as gifts. I'd recommend this for anyone recovering from an injury or illness, or the elderly who'd like or need a way to get some light, gentle, no-impact exercise.",1362787200,5,959,4.5813953488372094

2156150,5,B00049QPII,"I have done yoga, jui jitsu, budokon, weight training etc from live experience and most from dvd too. I enjoy this Qigong dvd for many reasons. One is that Garri is very peaceful and relaxed which helps to instill that into the one who is practicing. The instruction is very straightforward so anyone can do it. I usually do not practice the entire dvd, but just the amount I need or want and since it is broken down in different segments, ending when I wish works well.

I have honestly found more motivation to not only do this Qigong dvd, but to also work on other mind, body goals because the dvd is so relaxing and invigorating that I do not mind doing it when I am tired or normally unmotivated. I do have to say that I have never practiced another Qigong dvd so my experience is limited in that regard. The documentary is good also.

I bought this for my mom as well to perhaps help her to stay active. Now if I could just get her to watch it...that's my next goal!",1362096000,,972,4.248648648648649
2156151,2,B00049QPII,"I was so looking forward to this DVD. I had tried Gaiam Tai Chi DVDs but found the instructors' positions facing towards the camera and their opposite movements (to the viewer) very confusing. I knew that Qigong was a simpler form of Tai Chi and after reading many positive reviews purchased this DVD. I now realize that the people who wrote those reviews must have had prior training in Qigong. While the movements are, in fact, quite simple, it is not at all easy to follow them if using this DVD. As with the Tai Chi DVDs, the instructors are always facing the camera. When they move to their right they are moving to the viewers' left. This is very confusing. Also, the speed with which the intricate movements are preformed is too fast to follow. Would it not make sense on a beginning DVD to break the movements into a series of steps and then put them all together? I have not yet been able to master with any kind of proficiency, the first 45 seconds of the first movement. I am continually getting hand and arm movements confused and am rather astounded that at 50 seconds into the instruction, with no time to process the preceding movements, the viewer is asked to incorporate a specific breathing pattern into the movement. Then it's on to a new series of movements. I can't count the number of times I have had to go back to the beginning of the segment and start all over again. I really don't know that I want to do any more So disappointing. I am sure those that have had some Qigong instruction would find this a good DVD. I wish I were able to attend a Qigong class but I am not. So, for me this seems to be a complete waste of money. I am adept at dance and many forms of exercise, but not Qigong the way it is presented on this so-called ""Beginning"" DVD.

UPDATE: after several days of trying to master the first movement, I have decided to skip it for now. Each time I thought I had gotten it, I hadn't. I doesn't help that the narration often does not match the movements shown. I was also frustrated when, just as I thought I had the movements, the camera angle was changed, throwing me off. As there are two instructors it would be very helpful if one faced away from the camera. The next movement is easier to follow. After that there is a series of 16 movements to choose from. Some are easier to follow than others, and it takes quite a while to move through this section. It is curious that the narration often does not match exactly what is being shown on screen. If you follow the narration alone you will be performing the movements incorrectly. Some movements seem faster than others, but no explanation for this is given. Sometimes I find myself far behind the instructors, other times far ahead. Often the directions for breathing are incomplete: many times I found myself holding my breath which I don't believe is the objective. At one point the viewers are directed to exhale while preforming a movement and are then told to exhale again. When were we supposed to breath?
I really thought I would enjoy this DVD, yet even after skipping the first movement, I find myself not satisfied. Perhaps what I need is an ""Introductory"" DVD rather than ""Beginning."" I was looking for a fairly simple routine that I could build upon as I became proficient. And while the option of picking and choosing from the 16 above mentioned movements is nice, the whole routine on this DVD feels disjointed and, most importantly for me, lacks a sense of rhythm and flow.
I have viewed the accompanying ""bonus"" documentary DVD on the roots of Qigong and its practice in the 21st century and found it interesting and well done.",1361318400,12,3640,4.481927710843373

I was hoping to find a DVD that I could use in between my weekly lessons to help me practice what I had learned.  The instructor on this DVD teaches Qigong a different way than my live instructor.  It took too long for me to peruse the DVD to find similar moves that I had been taught.  Ended up setting the DVD aside.,1349568000,,401,4.089743589743589

2156168,3,B00049QPII,"Due to the lack of mirroring effect & menu to easily locate movements, the learning process was labor intensive. But since I liked the free flowing movements, I put in the effort to learn them which involved me watching & writing the steps out on paper. In 2 weeks, I got it but I was determined. One thing about this routine, is that you have to want to do it, otherwise it'll get put on the back burner. It's been about 6 mos now that I've been doing the practice on a daily basis & I rarely get sick & am feeling pretty strong mentally & physically. It has helped me with some balance issues I'd been having, although not completely due to an inner ear problem. However, I would now like to incorporate some lower body movements as this DVD focuses quite a bit on arm & shoulder movements which seem to duplicate themselves in the way they feel. I just purchased the Stress Relief DVD with the hope of finding more lower body moves. I had the same problem with learning it but there were fewer to learn so that was a relief. The whole routine is more structured & did involve some total body stretching that I did feel worked the lower body more, so I'll probably alternate this with the other.  All in all, I love the form but found that the presentation made it more difficult to learn than necessary compared to other modern day DVD's.  Many people will be turned-off because of the effort required to learn the movements. A menu where the different movements could be easily accessed & a mirroring stance by the instructors would have made a huge difference. But the bottom line is, if you want to do it, you will do it!",1319241600,11,1627,4.366336633663367

2156172,5,B00049QPII,"I've used ""Qigong Beginning Exercise"" with Daisy Lee and Francisco Garripoli every other day for just over two weeks now.
  Since injury 10 yrs. ago I've been disabled. With Spinal Fusion @ L5-S1, Carpal Tunnel in both arms and Neck Disk problems, plus diabetes, insomnia, sciatica in both legs to soles of feet, plus fibromyalgia, I've tried many different exercise systems to find relief from the chronic pain and loss of physical health; trying to get into greater shape and achieve better health in a greater semblance of normality is my goal.
  With all these physical issues, my physiology reacts quite differently than the average person; experiencing limitations to stretching and bending exercises, so many things I can no longer do easily; lacks in flexibility, a general loss of strength, and unfortunately, chronic pain.

  From the first session,  physical, mental & spiritual results have brought greater flexibility and increased 'sense of being;, removing the ""fog"" brought from morphine, oxycodone and several other medications which produce dulled senses, feeling like being unable to wake fully.
  Prior, I've been using ""A.M. & P.M. T'ai Chi"" with David-Dorian Ross & C. J. McPhee, achieving great results. ""T'ai Chi"" workout takes about 20-30 minutes a day, per session -- I used ""T'ai Chi"" off and on for the last 2 yrs.

  ""Qigong"" dvd exceeds results from ""T'ai Chi"" in length of sessions (an hour and a quarter) and is more advanced and difficult physically. From personal experience, I believe ""T'ai Chi"" to be an excellent prerequisite program for lower back problems or any physically limited or disabled person.
  From personal experience , I'd use the ""T'ai Chi"" first, practicing for a month or longer, until you can do it everyday, as a preparative step before the ""Qigong"" dvd, which has increase of exercise stresses on the body. Of course, each individual advances physically in their own time, so if a person is not limited physically, they could begin to use the ""Qigong Beginning Exercise"" dvd immediately.

  ""Qigong Beginning Exercise"" brought me a greater 'sense of being' immediately following the ""Qigong"" routine; a slightly euphoric and heightened sense to both eyesight & hearing; clarification to personal presence; bringing the feeling of a great work-out with that slightly exhausted, yet satisfied feeling which comes with a well-rounded exercise routine to the body in general, as when cross-training in a gym.
  Mentally, I felt more focused and fully attentive, plus spiritually heightened such as like what happens after doing a Massage or Reiki session on another person (which I did years ago before my injury); becoming more 'in touch intuitively'.

  Although I did the ""Qigong Beginning Exercise"" dvd exercises in the afternoon, when I went to sleep that night I was ready to sleep, and did so fitfully until morning without interruption, an abnormal condition for me, as I usually get up one or two times a night from pain and needed trips to the bathroom.
  After two weeks, I highly recommend ""Qigong Beginning Exercise"" dvd to anyone looking for balance in their body.
  Already I have increased agility and greater physical, mental and spiritual awareness.

  In summary, being a disabled person with severe physical limitations, diabetes, fibromyalgia, insomnia and chronic pain; the effects immediately following my first session of ""Qigong"", has brought increased blood flow to both legs, lower back, arms, hands and upper extremities; decreases to effects of carpal tunnel limitations; lowered blood pressure; more balanced sugar levels; increased endurance and stamina!
  Plus, a fuller sense of awareness and presence, decreasing side effects from daily, heavy medication usage, pain is decreased and I thoroughly believe continued usage with bring me even greater strength, flexibility, endurance and stamina, all while getting me in better shape so I will no longer be embarrassed by my appearance.
  ""Qigong Beginning Exercise"" dvd is a god-send to me for the changes it has brought to my life.

  ""Qigong Beginning Exercise"" with Daisy Lee and Francisco Garripoli gets a 5 star rating!",1307232000,24,4159,5.237518910741301

2156175,3,B00049QPII,"What I didn't like was the lack of joy, happiness, or any sense of being in the present.  More like competently doing this set of arm exercises (legs weren't too involved) and being concerned perhaps about how professional the video looked.  Also strikes me as arrogant to not mirror the exercise for us.  We are expected to follow complicated left-right directions while they are doing the opposite.  Do they think if they reversed and started to their right (while we mirrored correctly to the left) that their world would spin wrong?  Be humble, make it easy for the student.  Just my idea.  Maybe in 5 years he will relax and unwall his heart and she will joyfully take her power and want to share.
His second video here about Qigong doctors in China was delightful.  Apparently lots of practitioners, guys mostly, find themselves with chi and heart to spare and discover by directing and giving they can heal others.  Even some chigong hospitals, and sucessful work on impossible conditions like paralysis and terminal cancer.  Chinese government seems interested, not combative like we might experience.",1294876800,9,1109,4.978260869565218

2156179,4,B00049QPII,"I bought this video, along with the one for cleansing and the one for stress relief, and I was a little disappointed.  I've only watched the one for beginners so far because I haven't gotten past that one as far as actually doing it. The reviews made it sound like it was going to be a breeze to do, so I figured the ""beginners"" video was a great place to start for someone like me who is kind of a couch potato. I'm glad I got the beginner's video along with the others, because I can't even imagine how difficult the others must be. While the dvd was very interesting to watch, and it seems like it would be a simple and relaxing thing to do, actually doing it was a whole different ball game. By the time I got to the end of just the first two practice movements my arms were killing me, and my back was none too happy. Even my skinny 20 year old daughter said it was very difficult for her to finish more than one practice move session without pain, let alone all the practice moves they have. I needed to sit down and rest before I moved onto the third practice movement. As easy as the instructors make it look, and as relaxing and simple as it looks like it should be to do, it is rather difficult to do for those of us who are out of shape. One of the reasons I even bought the dvds was to get into shape, and relieve stress, so that I could move on to more difficult exercise. Now it looks like I have to get into shape first just to do these so called ""simple moves.""  As for the senior citizens who reviewed this dvd, whose reviews convinced me that the exercises were probably easy, they must have already been in pretty good shape if they had no problem doing this. I gave this four stars because the dvd on the history of QiGong is quite interesting, and the movements DO look like they will be quite relaxing once I am able to conquer them. I took one star away because it's not as easy as they make it seem it should be. I guess I will have to stick with walking until I build up some stamina and strength.",1280361600,12,2022,4.103535353535354

2156183,4,B00049QPII,"This DVD set by Garri and Daisy Lee Garripoli was/is my introduction to the practice of Qigong.

Most of the exercises (I like the word ""forms"") are easy to do if one possesses a moderate degree of physical flexibility. There are a few moves that a beginner almost certainly won't be able to quickly learn to do as well as the Garripolis, but apparently an approximation will suffice, and one can learn to do the forms more correctly and easily with practice.

For me (and perhaps this will be true for the reader, as well), in trying to find time and motivation to get a modicum of exercise, it is easier and more appealing to engage in gentle exercise with stretching and deep breathing than it is to do the Western-type workouts to which I have been exposed. Of course, Qigong can be combined with more strenuous types of exercise, but if I had to choose one or the other, I would choose Qigong.

The interview and documentary parts of the DVD are also well-done and interesting. I expect to watch the documentary repeatedly.

The success of the DVD and its value to me can be gauged by the facts that I am motivated to practice the forms almost every day; I have recently purchased a book on Qigong as well; and I am seriously considering personal training with a local teacher.

All things considered, this is a very good DVD set, and it's well worth the price, for someone just starting to take an interest in Qigong.",1265846400,7,1423,4.5

I immediately went to the web, and ordered another one of Dr. Chen's Tai Chi GongFa Dvd's. His are a guided experience where you do the same routine with him for as long as you like.

Of course, if you have nether practiced any Qi exercise, don't expect immediate results from one time practicing. As with every art you need to practice these exercises regularly over a longer period (best every day in the morning) until you can practice them fluently during keeping mind and body relaxed so that you will completely experience their full healing benefits.

I recommend this DVD as a great starting point for anyone interested in Qigong and its health benefits.",1245024000,8,1285,5.218446601941747

I found the exercises to be a little difficult to follow because of the mirror image problem.  I actually stood with my back to the TV and looked over my shoulder so I could be in the same position as the instructors and then just listened after I got the hang of the movements.  One nice thing about Qigong is that I think you could do a lot of it sitting down if you needed to (it is mostly arm movements).  If you are in a wheelchair or have difficulty standing for some reason, you could still benefit from the breathing and arm movements.  My arms got tired after awhile and I had to take some breaks during the hour session.

The health condition I wish to mostly address is anxiety/depression.  Unfortunately, western medicine has caused me more harm than good in this regard, so I decided to look to the east for relief.  The slow breathing and rhythmic moving is calming.  I also get a lot of tension in my abdomen and I am hoping that this will help to release it!",1227139200,11,1176,4.280542986425339

I love the flow of the movements they present, the pace of the routine, and the verbal instructions are perfect to keep your posture and breathing on track.

My son lost my Amazon receipt and I can not contact anyone at Amazon so I am trying to go through Gaiam for the replacement.

As far as the workout goes, I have done it twice and both times I felt completely energized and happy afterwards.  My blood pressure was down and I felt content and well all day.

I highly recommend this beginning QiGong DVD for anyone looking to achieve a strong sense of well being and contentment.  The instruction as with all Gaiam workouts is clear and the movements are slow and precise so you can easily follow along.  I am hooked.",1217203200,3,721,4.409090909090909
2156198,2,B00049QPII,"This DVD definitely has some value and information that is interesting and it seems their heart is in the right place. On the other hand, in the age of DVD menus, I just assumed that all the various ""create your own routine"" exercises would be listed on a menu. Instead, it is kind of VHS format with one following the other and no menu except ""play"" or ""interview"". In order to randomly do the exercises (as the instructor encourages), I am going to have to sit down with a pen and paper and copy down which exercise goes with which chapter number, using the chapter display feature on my DVD player. The names are all in Chinese which does not bother me, but it will be more difficult to remember with so many to choose from and no numbers. Then I will have to hit chapter forward and chapter backwards to search around for each one (there are at least 16), which does not seem like part of a relaxing flow. Many DVD's in this day and age (even when not intended for random order) have every section on the menu and when you finish one, it goes to the menu and all you have to do is find the next one. I was very suprised this function was not available when it got so many great reviews. It would not be a big deal if I only planned to watch the DVD, but to get the actual use out of it, stopping the flow to pick up my paper and then foward chapter a few times, backward chapter a few times with paper in hand...this is anti-stress reduction. Can you tell I am a little agitated already? :-) Of course, if I just learn one small 2 min section per week and repeat that one and then do the exercises without the video, it won't be a problem, but then it is much better to rent it occasionally or buy a book. It's just so disappointing when a simple detail that is technologically available and commonplace is left out, especially when the randomness and self-tailoring is so central to this particular practice as presented. It certainly is not presented in a flow that is comfortable for me as is. I was so happy with another qigong video I rented before because, despite many injuries, I found I was able to do the first few exercises right away, as they were set up in a comfortable flow that warmed you up slowly. This is not set up in this manner (because of the randomness they understandably encourage) and seems to favor more postures for upper body, arms in front. My interest in non-western activities has somewhat stemmed from the overabundance of western focus on chest and foward shoulder pushing activities which have contributed to my injuries. I found so many detailed arms out in front poses in a row within the first few minutes of this video I found it instantly disheartening, especially when it is billed as an excellent starting point for beginners. I guess I was just so looking forward to something I thought this could be based on my limited but positive experience with qigong. I have used many different activitity videos in the past and followed the improvement and growth of well-intentioned knowledgeable instructors as they refine their DVD set-up and style. I hope this instructor's obvious passion and desire to teach will help him create something more accessible in the future. As for now, I have to say to other shoppers that if you have the opportunity to rent this before buying, I recommend doing so, to see if you can actually effectively use it. It is not a terrible product, but it just didn't turn out to be what I expected based on the description, the reviews, and even the explanation within the DVD from the instructors. Especially after positive experiences with other Gaiam products, I expected a different level of attention to detail and usefulness.

There are two dvds: The first consists of ""practice"" and an ""interview"" with Mr. Garipoli. The second is a good qigong documentary.  One can master all of these moves gradually by stopping after the first set of three exercises from the ""practice"" section of the first dvd, taking time to perfect stance, breathing, visualization and coordination of arms and feet, and then adding the remaining subsequent moves (thus maintaining the mastered breathing and visualization) as one wishes, ending with tuina massage (from scalp to leg palpations).

My problem as a brand new beginner is where to start.  It would have been very useful to have a ""quick start"" guide or introduction included.  The sheer volume of potential excercises is a little intimidating and I don't really know where to start in order to achieve the most benefit.  With and introduction it would also have been good to include some alternative ""curriculum tracks"" so that depending on my purpose, I would know which exercise or set of exercises I should perform.",1214524800,5,716,4.642857142857143

Qigong is not about exercising your muscles it is about building an awareness of your internal energy and learning to gather it and move it effectively.  It requires visualization skills, openess and patience.

I can honestly say that this video has introduced me to a new way of life.  I am now a serious student of Qigong and internal martial arts.  In many ways I feel like a teenager again and my stamina and energy (in all areas) have increased exponentially.

The exercises were perhaps simple enough and easily learned...but for me it was just too difficult to translate 'doing the opposite' of what I was seeing. I realize others may not have this problem, but I thought I should at least present this as possibly confusing a number of other people.

There are about 20 some different moves to follow on the first DVD.  I am an insomniac, and struggle to go to sleep and stay asleep at nights.  So I do these exercises just before going to bed.  By the time I have completed only the first 3 moves (just 10 minutes), 1) Swimming Dragon, 2) Dragon Pearl and 3) Bau Gau Xun Doa Goung (sp?), I am soooooo relaxed, I can't stay awake to complete the rest of the other 16 moves.

But just even the 10 minutes alone are enough to knock me out.  I really do try to get through more of the other exercises, but I just can't keep my eyes open.

This DVD has helped me so much to fall asleep faster and sleep more deeply.  Also, my work is very stressful and I usually experience pain and stiffness in my back and neck.  The pain and stiffness are completely gone.  But I do have to do Qigong every night.  If I miss a night, my insomnia and painful neck and back torture me once again.

I also love the documentary that comes with it.  Gary Garipoli, the creator of this DVD, has put a lot of heart and soul into this DVD.  He even risked his own life, to hide and get beyond the Communist Chinese Military Check points, to study under these incredible Qigong Masters.

The couple presents the material in a peaceful, centered manner and very importantly, as instructors I connected with them very well and feel that it is easy to return ""to class"" on a regular schedule.
In addition to this DVD, Francesco Garripoli produced a second DVD which explains the history of Qigong in China, his introduction and time spent as a student as well as overcoming a devastating personal trauma using Qigong practice.

The setting the instruction took place in was beautiful; mountains, lake, blue sky; very nice. Finally, there is a very nice documentary concerning Qigong and eastern methods of healing.

2156232,4,B00049QPII,"i bought this title for my mom who enjoys tai chi but found practicing qi gong more satisfying for her. she was very interested in the documentary dvd and has regularly followed along to the practice dvd for which she finds the instruction clear and easy to follow.

the dvd does not include a language menu option; it is entirely in english with subtitles for some of the chinese in the documentary. it would have been helpful for my mom to hear the documentary and the instructions in spanish. i'm sure this would be useful to lots of other people too, although i don't know how common it is for 'exercise videos' to have that sort of feature.

this was a solid choice for my mom, and i hope it remains challenging and engaging as time passes.",1169942400,14,745,4.430656934306569
2156233,5,B00049QPII,"""Qigong Beginning Practice"" is a two-disc set with a total content time of 2.5 hours.  The first disc is a workout demonstrating the exercises and the second disc is a documentary putting the exercises into their historical and cultural context.  I bought this DVD because I truly benefited from the ""Qigong for Stress Relief"" DVD.

Francesco Garripoli is an engaging instructor who clearly loves Qigong.  The snow-capped mountains in the background are spectacular, the music is great and the demonstrations and explanations are succinct and spot on.  A few repetitions and you get it.  I took some notes.  Sometimes I'll sit back and play the workout disc from beginning to end just to fine-tune the movements and make sure that I'm synchronizing the breathing properly.

I particularly like the concluding section of movements aimed at specific illnesses, e.g., if you have sore shoulders do this.  It is a proven fact that if people can exert even a small degree of control over their illness it will increase their self confidence and they will get better faster.

I have only one complaint with the workout DVD.  There is a lot of material on it (some 28-30 exercises) and you have to search for individual exercises linearly, which I found a bit annoying.  An index/menu would have helped.

Otherwise it's a great DVD for beginning practice.",1169769600,16,1348,4.964285714285714
2156234,2,B00049QPII,"I bought this hoping for a good daily qi gong routine for stress relief and stretching, and was bitterly disappointed.  Despite two and a half hours of running time, only one hour and ten minutes of that is actual 'practice time'.  Most of the DVD is made up of interviews and a documentary.  That's fine if you're interested in qi gong as a documentary subject, but it's of no interest to me.  The practice part of the disc was filmed by a lake near mountains, with gorgeous scenery and excellent production values.  The instructor goes through how to do each exercise very slowly, repeating each exercise twice.  It's great as a 'how to', but useless for the person who wants to follow a daily routine.  I'd happily lose the interview and documentary for even a ten to twenty minute daily qi gong routine!

But the most damning thing is that it's confusing as hell for the viewer with no experience with qi gong.  There are many complex hand motions in many of the moves.  These are almost impossible to follow because the narrator keeps telling you to ""use the left hand"" or ""move to the right"" and the instructors on screen are following the narrator, too.  Unfortunately, this doesn't allow you to 'mirror' what the instructor is doing, and throws you off because what you're doing doesn't visually follow the instructor at all.  The only way I could even begin to grasp some of the exercises was to ignore the narrator and concentrate on mirroring the instructors.  In other words, it worked better if I put it on mute!  But by doing that you miss out on instructions on when to exhale and inhale for the best results.  This was incredibly frustrating.  It was absolutely amateurish, and not something you'd expect from such a well-produced (and expensive) DVD.  I was horribly disappointed.  I think those with experience with qi gong or those interested in the historical aspects of the art would enjoy this DVD.  For those beginners (or even the more experienced) who are looking for a daily qi gong routine, keep looking.",1168905600,85,2031,4.7025495750708215
2156235,3,B00049QPII,"Maybe I'm bad at following directions, but I found this DVD a bit hard to follow even though I can see that the movements are simple.  Some of this is due to viewing it on a small laptop screen while standing up: often the two practitioners are filmed from a fairly far distance.

I know that Qigong is supposed to be very good and I'm sure I'll ""get it"" in time, but as the header says, I'm not that enthusiastic about this DVD.

It's also too bad that the menu doesn't give one the options of going straight to a particular move or sequence.  It's ""all or nothing"".",1168732800,24,567,4.222222222222222
2156236,5,B00049QPII,"Wonderful DVD and well worth the money! Unlike the other 3 qigong dvds I bought from another teacher which teaches only a few movements and short dvd with a lot of talking (which may be ok if you don't mine all that), this dvd has over 20 easy to follow exercises or movements and over 10 additional bonus instructions on self healing massage. I have hypertension but for some reason my blood pressure goes down after doing the exercises. Coicidence or not or reasons why? I have no idea but my guess is, it is the total relaxation and stretching I get doing the exercises. The 2nd dvd gives more information and background on Qigong which I find interesting. By the way, I also ended up buying the other 2 dvds from the Garripoli's (Cleansing and Stress Relief) but I still prefer and use this beginner dvd a lot better. The one thing you may not like with this dvd is that most of the names of the exercises are in chinese names which makes it harder for me to memorize the actual names. Apparently there are no translations yet, but it does not bother me a bit since I had no problem remembering the exercises themselves and not worry about the chinese names.",1167609600,7,1162,4.434579439252336

I first realized the sensation in the my crown chakra. I also felt that all important burst of energy that comes along with the appropriate and correct practive of Qigong.

The directions are easy enough for a child to follow and Garripoli gives the historical background to this treasured Martial Art.

I would and frequently do recommend Qigong to everyone-not all for it's health benefits but for it's uplifting spiritual benefits.",1156118400,18,568,5.031914893617022

I would recommend it to anyone.",1153785600,28,316,4.6909090909090905
2156240,5,B00049QPII,"This is a great DVD,the extra documentary  discusses the history and current use of QIGong, with actual footage of the Masters in China. I found the QiGong easy to follow and to work into my personal schedule. It breaks it up into several simple areas and if I don't have time for the complete session I can do the areas I need most.

 I am a Reiki Master and I wished to broaden my energy work, this was really useful. I am also struggling to learn accupressure and QiGong in a 100 hr introductory class, this helped learning several of the movements my instructor was also trying to teach. To observe QiGong practised well, reminds me of watching ballet, as it is very graceful, with rounded movements that are enjoyable to watch and practice.

As a nurse I am interested in energy work and exercise that can maintain health, flexibility, balance and strength that complements western medicine. QiGong can be a powerful tool to acheive this. I really enjoy this DVD as it is very well presented. I highly reccomend it!",1151971200,33,1020,4.6187845303867405
2156241,5,B00049QPII,This is my first introduction to Qigong and found the documentary DVD and actual instruction very informative and easy to follow.

If you are interested in Qigong - I would definitely recommend starting out here.,1147046400,24,386,4.746268656716418

2156245,4,B00049QPII,"This is a great introduction to the world of Qigong exercise and meditation. The most valuable part of the set for me was the 2nd DVD, with the documentary on Qigong. I never knew that Qigong is a term and concept that embraces varied styles and methods of exercise and healing. I learned from the documentary that even the playing of music and Chinese brush painting can be a form of Qigong exercise and healing.

The quality of the photography and demonstration is good and easy to follow. The movements are slow and relaxed, but I wish there was a multi-angle view of the exercises or at least a side and rear view of the movements. It was hard to understand the proper posture and stance of the exercises just from the frontal viewpoint.

Another limitation of the instruction is that it does not provide a graphic illustration of the location of the energy centers (Dan Tian) and the path flow of energy throughout the body. I know Qigong is an internal as well as a physical form of exercise, and it would have been helpful to know how the exercises direct and distribute energy flow through the body. I wanted to know exactly where the dan tian energy centers are, and the way the exercises move energy through them. That would have helped me to understand the purpose of the exercises, and given me something to visualize and concentrate on while doing the exercises.",1141516800,47,1375,4.608163265306122
2156246,5,B00049QPII,"This is a very well-produced DVD that offers a solid introduction to the art of qigong. No one video is going to achieve great depth in a complex subject, but having seen a number of qigong videos (many of which have shot-in-the-basement production qualities and very minimal explanations)I would rank this as one of the best, particularly for a new student. The qigong forms presented here offer slow, dynamic stretching, deep gentle breathing, and they are enjoyable and relaxing to perform. The second DVD presents a fascinating documentary on the history of qigong. Well worth the modest cost.",1140393600,32,597,5.1020408163265305
2156247,5,B00049QPII,"I also loved this dvd. It is over 40 min of pure Qi Gong movements that end with a self massage.
The movements are done slowly with a narrator to help guide you. The Asian name of the movement is shown before each one. This dvd has the most amount of different Qi Gong moves that I own.
Unlike Terrance Dunn's Chi Kung five standing meditations which have very little movement, this one does which gives you extra stretching to help open up your energy & since you have to concentrate on following them, you don't get bored as much or allow your mind to wander which is also increases healing.
I felt almost back to normal doing this dvd trying to heal from a very severe allergic reaction to lidocane given 1x in office by a doctor for a simple skin test which sent me to the hospital & nearly killed me.
I own others which I love that have some of the same moves & other ones including ""Discovering Chi"" with Linda Modero, Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming's ""Eight Simple Qigong Exercises For Health - The 8 Pieces of Brocade"" with gives a seated & standing movements & a lot of extra info about how energy moves, Dr. Yang's company's VHS ""15 minutes to Health"" & recently Dr. Paul Lam's ""Qigong for Health"" which was very short on content with only 5 movements but did work.
This DVD will be a new favorite.
This dvd is narrated by a different voice, their Qi Gong Stres relief they teach as they go is even better at a nice short 22 min that really relaxes you.",1138147200,45,1453,4.306569343065694
2156248,5,B00049QPII,"My Oriental Medicine doctor reccomended that I do QiGong to ""build up my chi"". I was hopeful but skeptical about the extent to which my chi would be built up. When I first viewed the video Qigong Beginning Practice, I thought that the exercises looked relaxing but not very energizing. But I am compelled to say that after a few days of doing this video in the morning I have begun to see quite a drastic change in my energy level. I already notice that I have more warmth and circulation in my body and I feel ready to jump right out of bed when I wake up in the morning! My husband is impressed at the new increase in my energy and vigour. I also notice that my breathing is becoming fuller and deeper and I feel an overall sense of refreshing vitality. I have practiced yoga for many years and I find it very enjoyable and relaxing, but Qigong is a new gem of my heart.  This beginning Qigong DVD is very well put together. Each move is very thoroughly explained and it even tells you which organs of your body the exercise is benefitting (which I really like). The exercises seemed too easy at first, but after a couple times of practice and doing them correctly I noticed it was really working my whole body. The video is very well put together in a high-quality yet relaxing format. It is easy to flip through all of the moves so you can do them in any order you like as the video reccomends. It would be even better if each move was listed in a menu so you could directly go to it from there, but it does not detract from the ease of use. It is even good if you just have a few minutes in the morning to do just a couple moves. I would definitlely reccomend this video to anyone of any age wanting to learn or continue their existing practice of Qigong! Well worth your money; extremely enjoyable and beneficial.",1130544000,119,1819,4.257225433526012

I have owned a number of exercise DVD's, and have always been physically active, but if I could only choose one program, this would be it.  You get a sense of being 'opened up' afterwards. Everything works better, feels better.  Don't feel bad if you don't have the time to do all the exercises- watch it through first, then do perhaps 5 each day until you decide which ones are most helpful to you. I don't know if I am doing them correctly, and I find it challenging to keep up breathing with movement as I am not terribly coordinated, but that doesn't seem to affect the good results.
