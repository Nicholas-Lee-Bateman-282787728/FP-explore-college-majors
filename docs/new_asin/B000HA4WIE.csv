8137846,3,B000HA4WIE,"I only skimmed this mostly on FFw. This is not my type of workout since it is very stiffly presented & I do not enjoy workouts that use dumbbells. I only like yoga, pilates, martial arts & dancing.

This is presented in a white walled room w/wood floors. This has Assaf & the Whartons if you know who they are. Seven women including one who teaches the lower body & four guys, one who teaches the upper body & an older one who assists the other participants in the exercises show you a straight flexion/extension, etc. workout to help you tone you muscles.
Equipment:
is used including strap, chair, light dumbbells & a weight wrap that can go around your ankles.
Music:
is jazzy/house? in a soft volume with a fast beat that does not go along with this slow-paced workout/demonstration.
Intro: 2 min
Feet/Legs: 33 min
A lot of stretching of the toes, feet & ankles, moving grabbing a towel with your feet to help improve flexibility/motor skills of the feet/toes.  Another weight is wrapped around the upper foot near the toes to strengthen the toes. Basic well known leg strenghtening while sitting, etc. is used that some use machines to do & here is where you use the ankle weights.
Abs/Hips/Back: 17 min
Sit ups, sit ups w/twist, side laying leg lifts, reclined lifting lower legs, laying your hips on a chair w/waist to head dangling & lift torso & doing the same laying on your side. Also can be done laying on the floor with a thickly folded towel under the hips.
Upper Body - arms/shoulders: 15 min
Using dumbbells in various positions to strengthen different arm muscles.

This is a straight fwd workout. I did not hear much of the direction, but that's how it looked.",1213228800,2,1678,4.586666666666667
