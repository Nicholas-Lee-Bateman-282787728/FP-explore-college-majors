4858057,4,B005QAGBUW,"Slow but interesting for the era it was made in. Takes too long to lead us to the Nudist camp by trying to build a valid reason to go to the Nudist Camp; but interesting. Some rough edits so they didn't ""show too much,"" but otherwise not bad. I love how these old (ancient) ""nudist"" movies do everything they can to show how good for you Nudism is. Lot's of people gathering around to do the stupidest things to show how Healthy it all is. Cool! Rae Kidd was stunning.",1486080000,7,468,4.211111111111111

4858059,5,B005QAGBUW,"A rather quant film classic the film tells the story of a secretary's love for her single boss. Now add the fact that she's got a great figure, but a rather plain face, She gets him to go to a nudist camp (A real one) where he finally notices her. I quess that's one way to solve that problem. But, hey guys, women are more than their looks! Even though the film is black and white, it is quite enjoyable, so I'm going to recommend it to all couples.",1477267200,6,450,4.067415730337078

4858064,2,B005QAGBUW,"1930's vintage ""nudist colony"" skin flick.  Waist-up frontal nudity combined with lots full rear shots.  Middle school quality writing, directing, and acting, combined with antiquated production techniques.  But was good for a few laughs to break up the boredom of a cold, snowy Saturday in January.",1390089600,22,299,5.456521739130435
4858065,3,B005QAGBUW,The story line is probably typical of all a producer could come up with back in 1938. It's better than some documentaries I've seen put out lately about nudism/naturism.,1382227200,4,169,4.862068965517241

4858067,3,B005QAGBUW,"Compared to today's standards it's pretty tame, you'll see more on HBO but 1036, really. I didn't know they made movies like this back then.
Anyway back to the movie plot....I don't have a clue since I just fast forward the whole movie. I just wanted to see 1936 nudity but strictly for
the artist point of view.",1498521600,2,312,4.396551724137931
4858068,4,B005QAGBUW,"This movie was a product of its time. I saw nothing it it that spoke to racial divisions; saying that is saying that this movie should be judged against current movies. The quality is low, but the story is poignant and the ending sad. The nudist camp is (what I THINK all nudist camps) like others. At this time (the '30s) full male nudity wouldn't have been shown, although by today's standards it's pretty sexist. Yes, the lead female was 'different' looking---slightly----but not enough to cast her out of society. She was very beautiful!
The one thing that is remarkable is how normal sized everyone is. Regular size people. I by that I mean, no heavy weights. A couple of the (older) men were more robust, but nothing, and I mean NOTHING like today.
What has happened to us? I've seen many photos taken from this period and up till the 1950s and you rarely see a heavy person, and practically never see a heavy child. A curious and alarming difference as to how this compares to today.",1498262400,9,990,4.567415730337078
4858069,1,B005QAGBUW,"I think the director, actors, writers and just all involved should be ashamed.  This is not worth looking at.  The title should be ""Ashamed"".  Almost no dialogue and all the shots are actors back and butts, give me a break!!!  And turn down that ridiculous soundtrack !",1498003200,,269,4.659574468085107
4858070,4,B005QAGBUW,"Something very corny, cute and innocent about these old movies.",1497398400,3,63,5.4
4858071,5,B005QAGBUW,"Would we be in a less violent world if ""the code""  had never been written ? Possibly women could be appreciated for natural unaltered beauty with all the diversity evolution gave us.
The cinematography is fabulous, It shows how an artist can work with low tech  tools. The film is also a time machine.
The acting feels stiff, but remember talkies were new.
The women are hot----I can't judge the men------The story is romance and drama; the only action is BOUNCING BOOBS yes NICE BOOBS

4858072,3,B005QAGBUW,"Interesting movie from the late 30s, pretty much an excuse to show breasts and butts of young women. Full frontal nudity is avoided. The story is a simple one and really doesn't go anywhere, until the end. The worst part of this is there are many places where scenes turn black and you can't see what is happening, and there are some obvious cuts in the movie. the worst thing was the dummy with the ventriloquist, why were they here? I disagree with others about this being a statement about racism and white superiority, that sort of thing seems to have been endemic at the time and I see no conscious effort to make a political statement. As I said before it is an excuse for a T&A film. As an aside the 3 main women in this film are famous only for this film and seem to have disappeared afterwards.",1496707200,4,803,4.324503311258278
4858073,4,B005QAGBUW,"I really enjoyed this movie. The actors were good, I especially liked Rae Kidd, she is beautiful, I don't understand why they kept referring to her as plain. The racial slur against her was awful, but we have to remember, things were different back then, as horrible as that is, that's what it was. I really like seeing 'authentic' bodies, you don't see that too much any more in film, except in Boardwalk Empire, they really strived to keep things real for the time they were portraying. The video quality was pretty awful,  I wish they could have sharpened that up some. All in all though, I really liked this movie.",1496620800,13,618,4.5675675675675675
4858074,2,B005QAGBUW,This movie has a couple of the most shockingly racist statements I have ever heard in a movie. I guess it goes with the time that it was made. Pretty terrible acting and story line. The whole movie is basically an excuse to show some skin with the writer struggling to come up with some filler and plot. One of the oddest ways to fill time is the appearance of a scary ventriloquist doll and a couple bad musical numbers. That being said I sat through the whole thing because it is kitschy and interesting to see a movie with so much nudity from this era. The lead actresses are also very easy on the eye.,1495929600,5,605,4.224137931034483
4858075,3,B005QAGBUW,"I picked up on the film's veiled theme about perfect bodies and racial purity.  No other races in this nudist camp but Caucasian--no unperfect, unyoung bodies.  Innocent, childhood playing in the forest like sprite-like creatures along with hale-thee-well attitudes and hearty eating--innocence and racial purity tamed the beast of the human heart and mind. Low sorts not allowed.  This is what was touted by many eugenicists in the day.  The propaganda like atmosphere of nudity and perfect beauty was all about--hello--perfect race.

This was the age of eugenics, where Hitler was taking that scheme to its horrific conclusion.  At this time, he was murdering those in the mental asylums .  The mention of the Rae Lane's--the principal female character's-- 'lack of  Caucasian looks' despite the fact that she had Caucasian parents suggested that she was perhaps a 'throwback'--racially unsure.  Rae was advised by a doctor not to pursue her love interest because, in the end, he would conclude that 'east is east and west is west' --that Rae isn't racially pure enough.  In the end...  Well, check it out.  It's interesting and chilling at the same time.

A huge message in eugenics and racial purity here.  Now, we call it DNA.",1495843200,8,1231,5.059701492537314
4858076,4,B005QAGBUW,"For the time this was made, it was a pretty racy movie. However, I take issue with the premise the lead had a ""plain"" face. As far as I'm concerned, she was down right gorgeous (face and all). She needed a man who could see her inner beauty as well as her physical beauty. That is why I did not care for the downer ending.",1493424000,8,322,3.9692307692307693
8483025,2,B005QAGBUW,There's nothing less arousing than a nudist camp. In this movie (probably made in the 30's) people are covered up frontally. The plot is dumb as is the dialogue.,1529366400,,161,4.586206896551724
8483026,5,B005QAGBUW,"""The Unashamed"" is unique among nudist exploitation films. Films set in nudist environments were popular from the early 1930s to the mid 1960s. A characteristic of virtually all nudist exploitation films is that they ""preach"" the benefits of non-lewd social nudity. Physical, emotional, social and spiritual health are all touted as a nearly guaranteed result of sunbathing with others in the nude. In ""The Unashamed"" one character actually experiences deep human sorrow. Issues of adultery, racism and suicide all make this a prime example of an exploitation film, but they also make the film stand out as the only nudist ""volleyball epic"" to address human experience in anything like realistic terms. Amazingly, nudism still comes across as pure and life-affirming. The social nudity clearly is not the cause of the problems the heroine faces. After watching dozens (or hundreds) of later nudist movies in which everyone is healthy and happy, ""The Unashamed"" provides a pleasant, although limited, dose of reality.",1525651200,,1016,5.35625
8483027,5,B005QAGBUW,"Interesting old movie. Not the best quality but not bad. We enjoy movies from the
30's and 40's so thought we would give it a try just for fun.",1523836800,,143,3.9655172413793105
8483028,3,B005QAGBUW,"It seems this film was made both to exploit and promote nudist colonies. The acting is horrible, there is really no story, and the music is inappropriate and annoying. The filming focuses on a lot of breasts, but there is really no full frontal nudity. All in all it is very strange and hard to figure out why this was made and for what audience.",1522108800,,346,4.338461538461538
