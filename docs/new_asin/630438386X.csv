864362,4,630438386X,"In the same way that Motown produced a black version of 'The Wizard of Oz' whereby they could see characters that looked like them, the makers of 'The Preacher's Wife' produced a black version of 'It's A Wonderful Life' so that the characters could reflect the black community. Although I sympathise with the emotional connection of audiences with characters that look like them, I do feel that 'It's A Wonderful Life' was a universal story and that 'The Preacher's Wife' was just a black version of it that didn't improve upon the story. It was an enjoyable film to watch, but one couldn't help being overwhelmed with the tones of 'It's A Wonderful Life' ringing in the distance.
There were, however, some redeemable qualities to it. It teamed up Whitney Houston with Denzel, as well as Gregory Hines as supporting artist and Courtney B. Vance from 'The Tuskegee Raiders' and 'Black Panthers'.",1003190400,2,894,4.8881578947368425
864363,3,630438386X,"Let me say right off...Whitney Houston is, without question, an extraordinarily gifted singer and Denzel Washington is one of Hollywood's best boxoffice draws...and, not without reason.  But, those facts aren't enough to save this picture.
Those who have seen this film and have not seen its predecessor, ""The Bishop's Wife,"" have only seen the inadequate imitation.  There is no comparison between the two, other than plot similarities.
If you want a beautiful bit of Christmas drama, a touch of humor and truly superb acting, the better choice is ""The Bishop's Wife.""  I don't say that merely because it is a ""classic,"" but because of the reasons that make it a classic.  The texture of the story and the subtle acting nuances add a richness to the film which is, unfortunately, missing from this updated version.",977011200,4,815,5.014814814814815
864364,5,630438386X,"This movie is perhaps one of the best family films of all times. It is beautifully casted with Whitney Houston as ""The Preacher's Wife"" and Denzel ""Dreamboat"" Washington as Dudley the angel.  The movie moves along smoothly and brilliantly.  And there is such a good message in it.  Definitely a film for the whole family to watch.  The film gives you hope and you end up feeling really good about life.  Give it a try, no disappointments here.",972432000,4,443,4.628205128205129
864365,3,630438386X,"Even with the great cast utilized here, ""The Preacher's Wife"" still seems to be lacking something. With direction by actress Penny Marshall, this is a reboot of the old Christmas romantic comedy-drama from the 1940s starring Loretta Young, David Niven and Cary Grant, only then it was called ""The Bishop's Wife"".

There are few changes in this updated fantasy story: Narrated by the son of the pastor and his wife, Jeremiah (Justin Pierre Edmund), Reverend Henry Biggs' (Courtney B. Vance) marriage is experiencing a rough patch. To add to that, he begins to doubt his ability to make a difference in his community, to save a church that is struggling financially, and to even doubt if God can truly make miracles. Overwhelmed,  he prays for guidance. The answer to his prayer is a handsome and charming angel, Dudley (Denzel Washington), who is sent from Heaven to help restore his faith and repair the issues surrounding  him. However, the reverend does not buy the story that Dudley was actually the answer to any of his prayers or even sent by God. Dudley, here to help the preacher, ends up falling in love with the preacher's wife, Julia (Whitney Houston). With her husband's disinterest growing, there  seems to be an uncomfortable  attraction on Julia's part towards the handsome Dudley as well.

The story still works to a point. For some reason though, Whitney's acting  is very low-key throughout the film, however her musical numbers are stellar, especially ""I Believe In You and Me"", ""I Love The Lord"" and ""Joy to the World"". Denzel is wonderful as always, but the reviewer is right on one point, and that's why I took off a couple of stars in this review. By the second half of the movie, the presence of the Dudley character is no longer necessary because Reverend Biggs is able to figure out how to handle things on his own, and he also begins to repair his relationship with his wife. In that aspect, he actually upstages the angel that came to help him. I still enjoyed Denzel's performance, though. He was delightful to watch in this role. He has a flair for light romantic comedy, and that's something that you rarely see in the majority of roles that Denzel plays.

Singer Lionel Richie also has a small role in this film as Julia's friend, a jazz pianist. It was a pleasant surprise to see him, since I didn't even know he was in this film. The scene with him and Julia in the jazz club is a priceless one!

The film does have its moments (I especially enjoyed Jenifer Lewis'  hilarious performance as Julia's mom). It is an ideal family film....something everyone can sit down and watch and enjoy.",967248000,4,2620,4.700873362445415
864366,5,630438386X,"The more I see this movie, the better it gets.  Denzel can portray any character Hollywood chooses to throw at him.  As the angel Dudley, he is full of charm and charisma and makes this such a lovable movie.  If you  want to sit back and throw in a movie that makes you realize how good your  life really is, this is the one.",954720000,,325,4.015625

864868,3,630438386X,"Hate to pan such a good cast and excellent choir, but, though this started out well, translating ""The Bishop's Wife"" into a ghetto milieu, with such
tight community values, it fell apart about halfway through for me.  Dudley the Angel spread some ""magic appreciation"" but not enough, or the recipients were not seen to change for the better,nor were there rescue operations, helping various mommies with their children. One example was the lost opportunity of the preacher's son's best friend being transported to an orphanage far away.  Those two kids were a big plus in the family events. Other than a wonderful voice and a few good solos, and a prestigious position as the Choir Mistress,  the preacher's wife did not seem to feel the effect of preacher's negative attitude toward his accomplishments.  It wasn't really clear either why or when he started losing heart.  He was just Mr. Grumpy Pants.  So, when wife and angel started doing things together, wife was not really in despair and need of rescue, and it seemed angel fell in love too soon, and without real reason.  What really were her values?

And her  mother didn't work for me; she was just an annoying nag with no real purpose, and was careless of other's needs besides, by smoking around a small child!  Why was she even there?

Further, the spectre of the rich church loomed rather late in the story.  That the businessman's motives (profit) were short sighted, missing all the positive community needs and gliding over the fact that no one plays tennis; that everything about the church was just too showy and too big, not to mention that the congregation wouldn't be able to attend that far away, all supported the blindness of capitalism, but didn't involve the preacher soon enough to be the Big Meanie.  Further, there was no tender story revealed behind the businessman's greed to resurrect him.  His ""transformation"" was unbelievable.  Thus, when Dudley left, there was no sigh, or heartfelt wrench.

Having said all this, the various choirs or vocal groups were very good, adding a great deal to a weak exposition.  I really loved the children's Nativity performances and their choir; it was just good enough to be enjoyable, but just amateurish enough to sound realistic.",1491868800,,2251,4.897097625329815

866205,5,630438386X,"One of the best remakes of a movie I have seen to date.  The original story was used in ""The Bishop's Wife"", another great Christmas movie (from 1947).  This one updates that story with some wonderful changes that manage to keep the original story in general, but change it in ways that almost make it another story.  But not quite.

  And that is one of the things I like about this movie so much.  The changes are well-chosen, the things that are kept are just as good.

  It is the story of an angel named Dudley (Denzel Washington) sent down to earth to help a preacher (Courtney Vance) who prays for guidance in his fight to keep the local church open in spite of growing debt.  What Dudley finds is that he is not always paying enough attention to his wife (Whitney Houston) and so Dudley tries to fix everything -- church, marital problems, and a few other things while he's in town.

  The cast is very good, the dialogue is funny, the music ... Whitney Houston sings a lot and that speaks for itself.  And I like the narrative provided by Jeremiah their son.

  All around, the movie is a winner and I like watching it every Christmas season.",1421712000,,1151,4.4

I am also a big fan of the original, ""The Bishop's Wife"", starring Cary Grant, Loretta Young, & David Niven, but this is an uplifting modern African American twist on this story. Putting together Denzel & Whitney is a winning combination. They had pretty good chemistry n this film. I'm a huge fan of both & wished that they'd gotten an opportunity to work together again.  I loved the whole cast.  Jenifer Lewis who plays Whitney's mom was funny & wisecracking, & I have always been a fan of Loretta Devine.  The soundtrack is amazing also!  Hearing Whitney sing anything is heaven on earth, but she is truly n her element singing gospel, b/c that is where it all started for her! I also loved the small role that her mom Cissy played n it as a member of Whitney's church choir, w. Whitney as the choir director.  That must have been fun for them both, considering that Whitney sang n her mom's church choir as a young girl growing up, before she became a big star.  Go out & buy this dvd.  U won't b disappointed.  This movie will move u & make u laugh, & the great gospel singing will no doubt have u tapping ur feet & praising The Lord.

Denzel Washington is awesome as the angel who helps repair a strained relationship between Whitney Houston and Courtney Vance's characters. Gregory Hines' character is a business man who has developed a hard heart as a result of disappointments and success but he is also ""touched by the angel.""

868057,4,630438386X,"It's very difficult to get good christmas films anymore. Here we are in the environs of new jersey-new york with the added star power of denzel washington and a new whitney houson(probably one of her more satisfying performances). The film feels good it has children and singing,gives us a sense of community and how a community can grow and how christians can develop and inspire and hold back a community,and at times how a community can be inspired and renewed by a church and also by the modern forces of large capital as here evinced by the large developers who will buy the church and replace it with a shopping mall, emphasizing the sterility of modern culture,and how our cities really need churches! The locale is around a developer known as hamilton real estate and we are in the modern world and the church community with pastor and estranged wife played by houston,are visited by an enigmatic angel The angel here is not the usual staid boring figure,but notices this community lacks love,and how can it move forward if the love between pastor and his wife has stalled. The pastor notices the angel spends much time in conversation and fun and excitement with his wife going out and conversing in a series of outings,and the pastor upset confronts him,and the angel responds he was just sharing love and at the film's end the pastor notes this love,how it renews the community and he now recommits himself to love to the long lost relationship. There is also a subplot about an innocent man being imprisoned and then exonerated and a developer wanting to pull out the church from the community and replace it with a shopping mall. Interesting story! At films end feeled with love the preacher gives a jesse jackson type speech detailing the needs of the community,and we have a parting scene where the angel leaves the pastor's wife,filled with love within,the kingdom being within him and he wanted neither to control or hem in or sexually take advantage of the preacher's wife,but to shower her with love,and he corrects the jealousy of the preacher,the ideas and fixations in his mind preventing him and the community from growing in love,as the whole world and even the developer at the films end,worships at christmas services. A christmas story,in these days not realistic,but great performances and good twist on old theme gives movie freshness...as well as performances!!
It's unfortunate we recently lost Houston,who had her own battle with inner demons externalized through addictions,and associated disorders,a truely beautiful person and talented performer,and for some reason very few film performances,which is odd since many of her films did good box office! We miss her work,but more than that we feel bad she really couldn't enjoy her success and she is sadly gone...",1337385600,,2796,4.963752665245202
868058,5,630438386X,"A genuine feel-good movie! When I heard of Whitney Houston's death, I could not remember if I'd ever seen or heard of her. Then various people started telling me songs they remembered, and I knew I had heard them. Somebody else told me she was also an actress, so I looked for her movies.

First, the casting of the movie is superb. Denzel Washington is absolutely perfect as an angel: after all, I've always thought he looked like one. Whitney Houston, being a devout Christian, would naturally make a good preacher's wife even if she wasn't so talented. Hey, people, she was at least as much an actress as a singer. And we all know she was marvelous as a singer. Her mother plays, oddly enough, the preacher's mother-in-law. Courageous of her, given the mothers-in-law are notoriously villainous roles. She manages to be the ""you know I wouldn't interfere in other people's business"" cliche busybody and also a terrific grandmother to their two adorable kids, one of which is the story's narrator.

You will see more than a little resemblance to the classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"" here. And in fact the liner notes tell me it is a remake of a 1940s movie called ""The Bishop's Wife."" I'm going to have to look for that, too.

Reverend Henry Biggs (Courtney Vance) has his share of problems and a few other people's too. He prays for help, and in response, the Boss sends Dudley (Denzel Washington) to help. Of course, he has a handbook and gets several good jokes out of references to it. I won't spoil those for you. Problem is, Reverend Biggs does not believe he's really an angel, and you can't blame him. Dudley seems far more like an interference than a help.

The Biggs kids know, though, because they were making snow angels out on the lawn where Dudley fell to the ground right out of the sky. Of course the grown-ups don't believe them.

I was tempted to give this just four stars instead of five, because it is really pretty sugary. But heck, it's Christmas. [In the movie, I mean. I know it's April out here in the so-called real world.]

Why should an atheist appreciate such a movie so much? Because I can't help thinking that if I knew more Christians like the Biggs, I might believe, too. Or at least want to.",1336608000,,2226,4.5525

We also on several of the soundtrack for this movie, reason being we had the sound track years ago and some how the sound track cd was broken.. So we made sure to replace the sound track and have a extra on hand just in case.

The movie is full of warmth and joy.. The actors are great and perform with excellence! This movie is great clean family fun and entertainment for the whole family!

If you want to laugh, be inspired, send your spirit flying, bond with your family, uplift spirits, wholesome movie, a good message, and just clean fun, then this movie is for you!

Just before christmas, one day I was over there visiting and my cousin (her daughter) brought some christmas movies over to her house and we sat down and watched at least two movies.  It was a very enjoyable visit.  We laughed, talked and shared snacks.  My cousin mentioned that her mother wanted to have the movie in her collection and she had been looking all over for ""The Preacher's Wife"" but with not much success, find it.  The very next day, I checked around a couple places myself with no success.  Just days before christmas, I decided to check amazon and wouldn't you know, I found it! I immediately placed an order and the movie arrived to my home on December 24, 2011, just in time for christmas.  I want to thank Amazon for shipping my order in time.

Christmas Eve, my cousin had invited some of the family to her church for a special service and later to her mother's house for food and fellowship.  During this visit, christmas gifts were exchanged and I gave my aunt the movie (she had the biggest smile on her face).  It made me feel good to put a smile on her face.

868230,4,630438386X,"A few years ago I picked this up at a record (OK-movie, CD, DVD) store when the sales were good because the business was collapsing about their ears. Hadn't seen it until this (2011) Christmas season when I reached it in the unwatched section of the movie shelf. Naturally, I learned what I presumed many already knew. It was intended to be, and it is, a welcome addition to the regular movie fare for Christmas. Can't imagine why we should try to compare it with the Cary Grant-Loretta Young version. Different generations, unique performers, quite different socio-cultural reference and quite similar warmth. Denzil Washington is not Cary Grant; Cary Grant was not Denzel Washington (in white face). There was no Whitney Houston in the older film, there is no Loretta Young in the new one. Enjoy each when you are in the mood for one or the other.
No doubt the star of the film is the music. Whitney Houston leading a church choir or Whitney Houston in a Jazz club makes no difference. She IS ONE CLASSY SINGER. The singing with and without Ms. Houston is stimulating and satisfying. Nothing in the film can beat it; but, it makes everything else in the film better than it might otherwise be. Perhaps surprisingly, despite the number of singer/actors we have had, she also does a fine job as the Preachers Wife, who is getting a bit tired of the lack of a private life with the minister (although, with a father in the same profession, one would have thought she would have expected i)t. Denzel Washington is charming as the Angel; no room here for his normal intensity, but he fills the role well. The Preacher's role is competently handled as is the mother's; they both make solid contributions. Those handling the two little boys are to be congratulated. The boys are cute without being cloying or annoying. Hard to achieve. Gregory Hines gets to play the, was it Henry Travers', role in a Father O'Malley film, requiring nasty turned saintly (more or less). There is no way to be more than OK in such a role
All in all, therefore, this is a family picture, so-called, well worth a family viewing around the Christmas holiday (or any other time, for that matter). Don't expect a film for the Hall of Fame equal to Citizen Kane; do expect a light, good-spirited, musically satisfying, little film worth watching when in the mood.",1325116800,6,2334,4.681265206812652

As it is, I now have it on DVD and whats more it was arriving almost a month before it's estimated postal date.

DOUBLE BONUS!!

In particular there was one song/rehearsal scene I was after in this movie. When Whit is singing with the choir and is sweating and souling something fierce. The camera lingers on her as she finishes and there is no doubt She is singing her guts out. I love that in any singer. Authentic. As for DENZEL (the next president), He is so believable for my money that I have a number of his films in my collection. I can't remember ever thinking he's 'acting' in a film. That is the mark of a natural in my humb opinion. As for the silver suit?, That is classic Gregory Peck/Cary Grant/Jimmy Stewart/Fred Astaire. Story is good and unconvoluted.

868475,5,630438386X,"Ever since I saw this film in theaters with my family in 1996, I knew this film would become an annual holiday tradition and it has. It's amazing to think how far Whitney has fallen since her role as the singing Preacher's wife, but I do consider this to be the best role she has played on screen (surpassing ""The Bodyguard"", ""Waiting to Exhale"", and ""Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella""). It was a role tailor made for her, as she did start her singing career in church and always wanted to make a Gospel album.

The cast is also magnificent, as I love the lady who plays Whitney's mother with her sassy comments (""don't talk about your behind, I gave you that behind!""; ""I'm not one to pry...""), the Preacher's somewhat flustered secretary (""first he took the picture, then he took the car and moved to Cleveland"", ""Please Santa, put that man under my tree...if he can fit!""), Courtney Vance as the Preacher who's lost his spark, the boy who plays the son and narrates the film, and of course Denzel Washington as the angel who comes to offer help. Gregory Hines plays the villain role, and Lionel Ritchie has a cameo as Whitney's old flame. And cameo of cameos, Whitney's own mother Cissy plays a member of the choir.

My favorite scene coincides with my favorite song on the film's soundtrack: ""My Heart is Calling"" when Whitney and Denzel go ice skating while Courtney is stuck in traffic and growing frustrated. That song should've been a single, but whatever genius decided to release the melancholy ""I Believe In You and Me"" probably killed a great opportunity to ignite Whitney's career at the time. As I remember, this film didn't do well at the box office and the soundtrack didn't fly off shelves. Had they chosen ""My Heart is Calling"" (one of Whitney's best songs ever), it might have had a different outcome. Oh well...the film remains as a must see holiday classic that I never get tired of.

A year ago, I finally watched the original ""The Bishop's Wife"" and I must say that they definitely improved upon the original. To call ""The Preacher's Wife"" a remake is somehow missing the picture. They are completely different in style and I prefer the musical and modern ""Preacher's Wife"" over the 1950s/1960s film. ""The Preacher's Wife"" just makes you feel good when its all over, it's a rare family film that doesn't have any embarassing moments and one that the whole family can watch and enjoy together.

In this movie, she tends to be a little sedate; her speaking voice rarely rises above a whisper. And this girl is my favorite of all singers. Of course she is no Mahalia Jackson, let us not confuse that. However, she did go back to her roots with this somewhat ""musical"". I was not very impressed with the ""total"" movie itself. I believe I was more blindsided by it being star-filled. I gave it four stars because I know she had a good time with it and in my opinion, it was as though she told herself that she would get this one ""gospel thing"" under her belt for God. With the soundtrack, yes, she did just that. The movie, I would suggest that it needed a little work. I believe the excitement of having Whitney and Denzel on the same screen was very powerful for some. Now, place the two of them in ""The Body Guard"", they will make an outstanding contribution and give new meaning to the word ""chemistry"".
