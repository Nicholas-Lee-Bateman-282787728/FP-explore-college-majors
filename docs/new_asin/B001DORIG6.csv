8294419,5,B001DORIG6,"I came across this movie on youtube.  Watched it, and basically, I was able to understand the story by the actions of the characters.  The movie is entirely in Italian, or another language I do not understand.  The story is about a young man, working or has trouble finding a job and moves with his friend to a bigger city in Italy.  Because of documentation or lack of passport, they both part and the main character is pretty much stuck in Italy.  He sleeps in the streets and eats what he can find.  One day, he manages to eat and shower in the restrooms used only by the subway maintenance guys and there he meets someone that at first smacks him and later become great friends....I will not continue telling the rest of the story, but it is a great independent film about life, opportunities, love, and friendship.",1379980800,,819,4.5
