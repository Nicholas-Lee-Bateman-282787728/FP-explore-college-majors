1102405,5,6305971900,"A good film, Peppard as Tuxan in a role that would resemble the best (and worst) of 2 of his roles on TV (Thomas Banacek that year, and Hannibal Smith of The A Team, 10 years later).  The ending is that of a classic suspense film.  The DVD version by the way is cheaper than most stores are offering the VHS copy (if you can find it) so get it while you can. Note: Christine Belford, the woman down the road who falls for Sarazin also starred in Banacek, coincidence?",970531200,6,467,4.177777777777778

A man (Sarrazin) wakes from an laboratory explosion at a secret facility but does not recall the events that lead up to the event.  As George Peppard's detective (lead in the Banacek TV series) character tries to determine if Sarrazin was behind the explosion there are outside forces at work twisting the outcome.

7898732,4,6305971900,"Torture, rendition, holding people without access to lawyers, all the things we see now are used in this thriller about a spy stealing secrets from the US and how a shadowy organization uses and abuses anyone it wants to get its way, regardless of who is hurt. This was made in 1971 and there is nothing funny about it. It could be another day in our government here in 2012.",1361750400,2,375,4.371428571428571
7898733,4,6305971900,"I guess it's nice to see some of the ""Forgotten"" dare I say ""Suppressed"" movies available again. (Not worth hundreds of dollars IMHO)

""Groundstar Conspiracy"" is a movie that I first saw in the theaters as a kid.  It must have been on cable/TV at some point since.  It would be easy to get caught up in the late '70s style of the film and miss the story.  (keeping in mind that THOSE people are not nice to begin with)

The opening scene might bore a 21st century movie goer.  At the time (if you follow the dialog) you'll find out exactly what happened to make the building blow up in such a spectacular way.  Even as a young teen I thought the opening was fantastic.

What you see is a man running flat out down a long hallway.  Fiery explosions go off closer and closer behind him until he is literally ""Blown out the door"" of the building.

The man was an enemy Agent penetrating a secret computer system.  He screwed up with the wrong code or something.. triggering a huge self destruct sequence.  (Don't think I'm really giving away any spoilers explaining it.)

At the time the US did have some very sensitive ""National Security"" computers.  It would not surprise me that (to make sure) had a similar self destruct.

Remember that computers were pretty exotic back then.  Just getting a land line phone in your home or business was a chore.  (Totally lost on today's Internet connected smart phones generation)

The rest of the movie is pretty cerebral.  I'd also like to add that the final ""A-Ha"" premise (even for the era) was not fantasy.  Which is interesting since right about the time of ""Groundstar Conspiracy"" came out in theaters.. The Moonie cult was making news as well as psychiatry & the courts began to discover ""False Memory"" syndrome.

7898734,3,6305971900,I liked it . A little  rough in spots . I can agree with some of the other reviews to a point . For the  low price it is still better entertainment than most of  the box  office postage stamps they churn out today  . It moves right along . George Peppard is excellent as always,1343260800,,277,3.875
7898735,3,6305971900,"The Groundstar Conspiracy is a peculiar hybrid of A-movie plot, effects and suspense and B-movie acting, music and occasionally editing. The story is intriguingly complicated (close to being far-fetched, but nevertheless): the twist and turns never cease to amaze the viewer. The same thing goes for the execution of the action scenes (great pyrotechnics during the opening scene) and the setting, with its fine locations (sci-fi-style research institute, villa near the beach, harbour area, helicopter views of the surroundings). All this together breathes quality and manages to secure and retain the viewer's attention right till the end (where I was wrong-footed for one moment, until ...). Unfortunately, some of the interesting action scenes are edited so tightly you've almost missed them while blinking your eyes. The crucial blast that sets off the whole affair is over before you realized what you've been looking at (mixing it with the opening credits doesn't help either), similar to the scene in which the intruder in the clinic is pursued and killed (again, before you've even had the time to realize what has happened). There are some minor examples of such overhasty editing too (the accident in the ambulance, the capture of Welles' (Michael Sarrazin) kidnappers preceded by Welles' escape). Another nagging point is the music used in this film: true, it is varied, but some of it is somewhat exaggerated and cheap because of that. This is true to some point of the music used during the romantic interlude between Welles and Nicole (Christine Belford), but mainly of the odd sci-fi music including beeping sounds etc. It tends to draw too much undeserved attention to itself, making the events on the screen seem less serious than they are (I remember similar music being used in The Anderson Tapes). A last critical remark I would like to make is about the style of acting. It appeared to me (especially in the beginning) that the actors tended to sort of rattle off their lines, without making it sound all too convincing. Towards the end, this seemed to improve. Perhaps I just had to get used to them (Peppard is a very good actor, after all). As to the scenes between Welles and Nicole, I had some initial doubts too: I felt she confided in a total stranger far too easily. This seeming rather unrealistic, I drew up the theory she was part of some sort of a setup. When it turned out she was not, I began to appreciate her relevance to the plot anyway, considering she was the one who helped Welles on the way to recover his memory. The Groundstar Conspiracy is an amusing suspense thriller with some flaws, but it is definitely entertaining enough to please the viewer.",1276992000,,2694,4.910087719298246
7898736,2,6305971900,"""Groundstar"" is a top-secret government space project, whose security has been breached, by Welles, one of its employees (Michael Sarrazin).  Escaping the facility with secret information, the man is severely injured, and when captured has no memory of who he is.  George Peppard is Tuxan, a hardened, single minded, government investigator in search of answers.  Nicole (Christine Belford) is a bystander drawn into the situation, as Tuxan attempts to unlock the secrets within Welles's mind.
The film has a made for TV look and feel, with a plot that is not really original, or particularly credible.  The script doesn't contain much action, or well-written dialog.  The atmosphere of big brother government is pervasive.  Tuxan, who routinely travels in a helicopter, is full of bluster, and attempts to orchestrate much of the action, yet doesn't actually do much that is impressive.  The resolution to the story is rather unsatisfying, and implausible.  Unless you enjoy heavy-handed government tactics, you can skip this drama.
Groundstar was released while Peppard was doing the TV show Banacek.  Fans of that program, should be prepared for quite different type of character.  The same applies to Christine Belford, who also had a reoccurring role on Banacek.  There are no warm scenes with witty conversation between them.  Michael Sarrazin has the most challenging role, and his performance while serviceable, is hampered by having to deliver some very bad lines.",1069545600,6,1473,5.329004329004329
7898737,3,6305971900,"George Peppard plays a character named Tuxan, who is responsible for uncovering the break-in and theft of highly classified information at a government facility called Groundstar.  He uses any and all means necessary to do this, including hidden cameras, hidden microphones, and 24 hour surveillance.  He has complete control most of the time, and absolute authority to find the information he needs in order to protect the United States against foreign interests that may try to undermine the government by stealing precious secrets.

That being said, this movie plays out like a cheesy 70's TV melodrama.  I tried hard to like this movie, but it was a hard sell.  The movie starts out with multiple explosions at some facility, and one character managing to make it out before the whole place goes up.  We see this character running down a corridor, being chased by other individuals, and then the picture freezes at a dramatic moment to allow for a credit to be displayed on the screen.  This happens about four or five more times, and becomes quite tiresome, but if I recall, this was a device used quite a bit in the 70's, on movie but more so on TV.  This movie really has a 'TV' feel to it, so I am wondering if the director was primarily a TV director...well, I was right.  The director is Lamont Johnson, and he has an extensive career directing TV, and it shows here.  Anyway, one character escapes before the whole place goes blammo, and it's Michael Sarrazin playing Welles.  This is one of those actors who you may not recognize the name, but you'd probably recognize his face.  He was fairly popular in the late 60's through the 70's.  This slender, dark haired actor seemed to be on the verge of becoming a major star, but has since been relegated to mostly TV roles.

Well, he escapes, and we find out later that he was the only survivor of the explosion.  His face badly damaged from the explosions, he manages to make it to the house of Nicole, played by Christine Belford, and actress with a solid television background and a few parts in some features films.  The role I remember her from was the over protective mother to Arnie Cunningham in John Carpenter/Stephen King's killer car classic 'Christine' from 1983.  We soon find out that that Welles, the soul survivor of the explosions, was also the one who caused the explosions.  Apparently he used false credentials to get his position within the ultra top secret facility, then stole vital information, and caused the destruction of the facility to cover his escape.  He remembers none of this, as he has lost his memory along with his face in the incident.  We learn all this information from Tuxan, who is now investigating the situation.  There is a conspiracy, and it does follow though.  The rest of the movie has Welles trying to put the pieces back together, recall what happened, if he could have killed those people and done the things Tuxan says he did.  Nicole provides a haven for Welles, and seems sympathetic to his plight.

The movie plays out, the conspiracy unfolds, and we are treated to a shocking ending.  Well, not so shocking, really, but whatever.  It was kind of hard to swallow, though.  My main problem with this movie is I never really felt the tension that should have been there and the acting seemed kind of wooden.  I enjoy a good conspiracy theory, but I had a hard time buying off on this one.  The thing to keep in mind before you buy this movie is that it looks like a TV show.  This was made in 1972, and prior to that, George Peppard had a somewhat promising movie career with Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), How the West Was Won (1962), and The Blue Max (1966) to name a few.  Then around 1971, the movie roles seemed to dry up and he went into TV.  He did make a number of movie after 1971, Damnation Alley (1977), Battle Beyond the Stars (1977), but none seemed to really have the prestige of previous movie roles.  The same could be said for Michael Sarrazin.  And the other main character, played by Christine Belford was primarily a TV actress.  Given the director's history in TV, this all adds up to making this look like a high budget TV movie.  I think once some directors immerses themselves in a particular medium, it's difficult to expand beyond the boundaries proscribed by that medium, and it shows here.  I felt like the director was trying to exceed his grasp, and couldn't quite do it.  Not a bad movie, for TV, but not a great movie for the big screen.  I'd say 3 stars for a TV movie, 2 stars for a theatrical release.
