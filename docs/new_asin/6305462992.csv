1029314,3,6305462992,"I really expect a lot more effort from IMAX when it comes to documentaries, and I feel somewhat confused with Search for the Great Sharks. Too much emphasis is placed on acting and scenes that are supposed  to startle the viewer. I do like the footage of the whale shark, but  everything else is out of place. For a film that advertises a grand search  for sharks, it gives the viewer something similar to a silly journey.",944784000,,422,4.454545454545454
1029315,1,6305462992,"This is quite positively the worst shark doc i've ever seen. It failed to achieve anything, there were no new scientific discoveries, too much talk and not enough footage of the sharks themselves.  It wasn't even very  educational. The two presenters (including the much respected Rodney Fox)  are almost comical and are more like pensioners on a day at the sea side  than shark experts. Coming from IMAX i would also have expected the sound  to be more impressive but my rear speakers hardly made a sound.  This may  have seemed more spectacular on the IMAX cinema but on your regular set up  it isn't worth a look in.",938908800,8,619,4.614678899082569

1030023,1,6305462992,"It seems to be a film about shark science created by people who know nothing about science, with the scientists going along with it and reading from an implausible script. The footage appears to have been ""dramatized"" in such a way as to make it startling or suspenseful. At one point a shark jumps at a bit of bait and the researchers scream with fear, something I have never seen on a real shark documentary. Strangely, many of the dramatized scenes (people on the ship's radio talking about dropping a cage in the water, etc...) seem almost procedural in nature and something better explained in a sentence by a narrator while actually watching it happen, if mentioned at all

Speaking of that, Joseph Campanella as narrator does a fine job in his parts of the film. This film has some really decent underwater cinematography that might be useful for stock footage, otherwise the whole concept of it is flawed.  These are about the only good things I have to say about it, other than the fact that searching out the director and producers on any film information site will give you an entire laundry list of short ""documentary films"" to avoid. I have seen at least 1/2 of them, and most were not good examples of the genre.",1398124800,3,1226,4.6192660550458715
1030024,2,6305462992,"This may have been the worst ""documentary"" I've seen before. As a diver, I was appalled by the lack of training and safety precautions taken by the team. Rodney quickly panics when he loses a fin and claims that he was not able to reach his BC inflator, yet, it was exactly where is should have been. His first move was to make an emergency buoyant ascent simply because of this. Unless he was out of air, he should have (and could have) taken the time to reach for the inflator hose instead of the fin, and make a safe ascent with a safety stop. Instead, he rushed to drop his weights, ascend without a safety stop, and the crew claimed he'd be just fine - yet no mention of his unsafe ascent and risk of decompression sickness was made.

The second time Rodney almost dies is at the end of the film, when a Great White tears through his oxygen line. Why on earth would the crew think that it was at all acceptable to attach a long line to a diver while they're chumming the water in hopes of inciting aggression in nearby sharks? It is beyond me. The sheer lack of precautions and common sense on the part of the crew ruined any possibility of validity in what was being said.

How is one supposed to take comfort in knowing what they've watched is accurate when, on multiple occasions, behaviors like this occur, even so much as showing a scientist who has worked with sharks for years, screaming at the sight of a Great White surfacing to attack bait?",1389830400,4,1455,4.345588235294118
1030025,4,6305462992,"We would have enjoyed this more if we could have seen the whole thing. It kept jumping and cutting off. I thought it was just my internet connection, but all other movies worked and we even went back to this one and it still wouldn't play.",1374624000,,239,4.217391304347826
1030026,2,6305462992,"With the plethora of Ocean shows available, this is a total waste of time. Some of it even looks fake! Mostly though its just boring. Get the BBC series Blue Planet or something else but don't waste your hard earned money on this.  Netflix or Prime this if you are going to watch it.",1348876800,,283,4.2407407407407405
1030027,3,6305462992,"Although the shark footage is great. I was hoping that there would be more actual footage of sharks. Much of the movie seamed to focus upon the researchers looking for the sharks, instead of the sharks themselves.",1139184000,9,213,4.783783783783784
1030028,2,6305462992,"This documentary needs badly a better direction and focus. There's nothing here we have not seen in the Discovery Channel. Furthermore the pace is slow, the story bland and repetitive (how many times must we show wonder  for a senior cientist?)and the resources such as Imax film are wasted. If  you want to watch something spectacular, try Ray Macgillivray's The Living  Seas, Imax-Alaska or Africa-The Serengeti. Buy this only if you want to  complete your Imax Dvd Library.",963446400,14,476,5.064102564102564
1030029,3,6305462992,"I consider myself a documentary, ""Discovery Channel"" freak, and of the many topics and themes which interest me the most, sharks in general rank among the top 10.
So my review of this DVD may be viewed as biased  from the start, hence a high 4 or 5-star rating may be expected.  Unfortunately, I've seen the disc and am somewhat disappointed.  For one,  how can you call a disc ""Search For The Great Sharks"" when you  essentially featured just two species (the whale shark and the ever  crowd-pleasing great white)?  Nothing about hammerheads?  Makos?  Tiger  sharks?
Nevertheless, I give it 3 stars if only for the overall audio  and video quality (expect nothing less from IMAX - I own a couple others  myself).  Also interesting trivia which would probably please an audience  of all ages.  The film, unfortunately, is only 46 mins long (how come all  IMAXes are this short? grrr!), with nine chapters as follows: 1. Domain of  the Shark; 2. Behavior; 3. Steel Cage; 4. Western Australia; 5. Spotted  Whale Shark; 6. Great White Shark; 7. Ancient Survivors; 8. Credits; 9.  ""Making Of"".
I intend to order the Operation: Shark Attack  5-disc set soon, hopefully there'll me something more there.  For shark  freaks out there I'd also recommend getting a copy of the Discovery Channel  Great White video (on VHS or VCD) or even the DVD of ""Deep Blue  Sea"" with its interesting featurette(s).",956707200,18,1392,4.8008474576271185
1030030,3,6305462992,"This DVD, (the Slingshot edition 9836), comes with 7 language tracks, english subtitles, Dolby 5.1 sound and a music and ambiance track option, plus a short 7 minute making of featurette that discusses some of the  problems of making an Imax film at sea. The film was made in 1993. This is  a GOOD documentary, but sadly not a GREAT documentary. Some of the  underwater sequences are very good, one or two shots are muddie and appear  to have a lucky we got it quality to them. Personally I would have  preferred a straight documentary about the Great Sharks. This particular  film trys to be a bit action adventure a bit serious documentary and it  just doesn't work. While Rodney Fox and Eugenie Clark try their best, they  are not actors and shouldn't have been asked to act. Some of the sequences  don't work simply because you can see whats coming a mile away. The looking  over the side of the boat for sharks sequence comes very much to mind.  Suddenly a shark appears. Surprise! And everyone reels back in fake horror.  Some sequences have obviously been staged after the event to get close ups.  The seal sequence where the Imax camera twists and turns through a seaweed  forest is obviously designed to make you feel sick when watching in an Imax  cinema. It goes on a little too long and is one use of the Imax format I  wish some film makers would get away from. Dispite these criticisms it is a  quiet enjoyable film. Worth getting? I bought a copy and have enjoyed  watching it a number of times, corny acting and all. Try using the music  and ambience track option if the narration gets a bit much. Theres no real  point to the Search except to show some rather good underwater footage.  Considering the extreme difficulty of making this kind documentary I think  its a fine job. With a bit of luck it might have been as good as the  exceptionally excellent Whales: An Unforgetable Journey.",949190400,8,1905,4.554572271386431
