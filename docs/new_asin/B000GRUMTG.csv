8134021,1,B000GRUMTG,"This is for the 2016  Daniel A. Finney film which Amazon has linked to another film as of this writing.

I apologize in advance for any plot spoilers, but the fact is,I didn't fully understand what was happening. The film is made in black and white which means ""art"" and not ""horror."" It is listed as a mystery and the biggest mystery is why I sat through the thing. Hope (Hetty Bentley) is missing. She is Rachel's (Jane Hamlet) sister and we know this because Rachel has a picture of her with ""sister"" written on the front and Hope's name on the back. Rachel apparently shows art and was a student of Richie (Charles O'Neill) who wants his work shown. Richie is friends of Nicolas (Mark Cornwell) who Rachel hates and we find out why at 52 minutes into the feature.

Now Rachel is not someone I would share my coke with as she goes bats*** crazy. The soundtrack was a piano that was played rather badly and was annoying. There are scenes that repeat themselves and we discover ""it is always darkest before the dawn"" and ""even in daylight the dark clouds surround us.""  I had to pause the film, get up and do something else about every 4 minutes. It was that tough to watch. And what was with that near Russian Orthodox cross they flash on the scene near the end?

8134022,5,B000GRUMTG,"I rated this dvd as high as possible because it a well-done movie,and very interesting and educating issue for the people interested in this theme",1379808000,,146,4.88
8134023,3,B000GRUMTG,I appreciate the story line and the irony of a priest being held by Catholics who are members of the Irish Republican Army.  The movie starts off with a twist when the wrong priest is kidnapped.  I thought the lead actor was a very good and convincing actor but at times was confused by his and the IRA's actions. It was not made 100% clear why the Priest made the decision that he did in the end of the film to stay with the rest of the IRA members as well as walk out in civilian clothes. I could definitely watch the movie again and did not mind how it ended but was hoping to get some more clarity on why things turned out the way they did.,1287187200,,644,4.0234375
8134024,2,B000GRUMTG,"I was hoping for a intelligent film
with something to inspire thought
regarding political struggle and
religion in the context of the
violent political factions in Ireland,
in this case a pseudo-IRA.
That is not what I experienced.

On the plus side, the acting was excellent
and the claustrophobic set for the
majority of the film created the appropriate
tense and desperate atmosphere quite well.

There were a couple of things that stand
out as spoilers for me.

Item #1: The armed group, under desperate
conditions, believes that it is important
enough for someone they are going to murder
to receive the sacrament of penance from a
priest that they place themselves at great risk
to see it done, yet the priest, as we learn,
does not think it is all that important, in fact,
he thinks it is unnecessary.
Why is he a priest?

Item #2: The armed grouping carrying out
this particular operation is commanded by a woman.
How often would a group of the type portrayed
under the conditions portrayed be commanded
by a woman?
Answer: As close to never as you can get.

Item 3: The priest was selfish and spiritually
and practically immature and his actions
led directly and unnecessarily to a greater tragedy
than the one he was trying to avoid.
The description of the film's plot
indicated that the story revolved around
a courageous priest.

I have no interest in viewing this film
again. I did not like it.
That's a one star review.
The extra star is for the acting and the
setting, both of which were really quite good.",1223942400,,1521,4.656716417910448
