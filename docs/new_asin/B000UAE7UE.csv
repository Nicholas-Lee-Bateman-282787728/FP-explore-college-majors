2918305,5,B000UAE7UE,"This is one great show. I never ever watched it before this year. My father-in-law started buying the seasons one by one & every time we went down to visit we would watch some of them. I got hooked on these shows. I never knew how funny they were. Cartman is one crazy kid. He is always starting trouble with everyone & everything. This is a show for adults. If you have kids, I wouldn't recommend this or any other seasons. If you own all of the 10 seasons out there, then you don't want this set because they are all in the 10 seasons. I don't own any of them so I bought this set. It's really funny. From Santa carrying a gun to satanic animals. Some of it is just plain sick. But very funny. It's no wonder that this show was once banned from TV. If you like Family Guy & it's dry humor, you will like this Christmas DVD. If you can't handle bad language then you won't like this or any others.",1200787200,,898,4.0790960451977405
2918306,3,B000UAE7UE,"This was a really good idea, but then they edited out the ""cuss"" words. That's REALLY lame. I would understand if it was on TV, but...come on now, its a DVD. You're not supposed to censor DVDs. So yeah, that's the only ""bad"" part.

Also, I was kinda hoping for some Trey and Matt time at the beginning of each episode like on the Season 1 and 2 DVDs, but wasn't really expecting it, so that's okay.",1198281600,,398,4.1688311688311686

If you have a sick sense of humor and like laughing out loud at disgusting behavior, bad language, and naughty attitudes... THIS IS THE DVD FOR YOU! Welcome to one of the funnier animated classics of the now generation. There are moments that everyone in my family was laughing so hard that we had to hit playback just to see & hear what Cartman said!",1198108800,2,517,4.34020618556701
2918308,5,B000UAE7UE,"Every Christmas goody that Matt and Trey have done, with all the tunes you've heard. Much fun; if you're looking at this review you probably already want this so get it.",1197331200,,169,4.483870967741935
2918309,5,B000UAE7UE,"When I think of Christmas the first thing that always comes to mind is Trey Parker's & Matt Stone's ""South Park."" These two geniuses have worked tirelessly to make ""South Park"" synonymous with Jesus. But really, ""South Park"" always has the best Christmas eps. Come to think of it, I'd have to say that ""South Park"" is the very best original TV program currently on the air. Everything else simply pales in comparison because this animated series mixes just the right blend of satire and comedy to form a modern-day masterpiece. All of the characters are incredibly likeable because everyone can relate to them. But, my number-one favorite character is none other than Cartman. Cartman is a total monster but he also has a very sweet side to him.

As you may know, this DVD was just released last month and is the newest ""South Park"" DVD; coming out just in time for Christmas! I purchased this for a good friend of mine that loves SP. He is actually out of the country traveling and hasn't seen an ep in ages so I think this would be a very welcome addition to his video library, or anyone else's for that matter. I really think that just about anyone can enjoy SP, like the back of the jacket says, ""gather' round the fire and watch these classic 'South Park' episodes.""

There are a total of 7 eps, included on 1 disc. As usual, the picture and sound quality is amazing and these are the original episodes that you remember from Comedy Central!

Here's all the eps that ""Christmas Time in South Park"" includes:

Mr. Hankey The Christmas Poo, air date: December 17, 1997
This show is from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-1/dp/B00023P49C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 1 </a>. In this X-mas-themed show the kids put on a Christmas play. When Kyle's mom hears about it she is livid. You may recall, in this ep, Cartman sings his famous song in honor of Mrs. Broflovski.

Merry Christmas Charlie Manson, air date: December 9, 1998
This ep is from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-2/dp/B00023P49M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 2 </a>. The boys travel with Cartman and his mom to Eric's relatives for Christmas. While there, they meet up with Charlie Manson.

Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics, air date: December 1, 1999
This ep is from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-3/dp/B0000CABL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 3 </a>. The show is hosted by none other than Mr. Hankey who introduces various Christmas songs. This ep was in honor of Mary Kay Bergman (best known as the original voice of Shelley Marsh,) who committed suicide shortly before this was broadcast.

A Very Crappy Christmas, air date: December 20, 2000
This ep is from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-4/dp/B0001ZWLVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 4 </a>. When Mr. Hankey doesn't show up the boys go down into the sewer to look for him. In this classic Christmas ep, we get introduced to Mr. Hankey's entire family.

Red Sleigh Down, air date: December 11, 2002
This ep is from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-6/dp/B000ADWCYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 6 </a>. The boys go along with Santa and Jesus to Iraq on a Christmas adventure. But as usual, all Cartman is concerned about is himself.

It's Christmas in Canada, air date: December 17, 2003
This ep is from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-7/dp/B000CNESM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 7 </a>. The boys travel to Canada to get Kyle's little bother back. Take special notice when Eric and  Kyle fight. It's so funny when Eric screams, ""meeehm"" just like a little b**ch!

Woodland Critter Christmas, air date: December 15, 2004
This ep is from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-8/dp/B000FSME2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 8 </a>. Kyle is caught up in a Christmas fairytale with those cute little Woodland Critters. I'd say out of all the SP Christmas eps this one is by far the most disturbing!

HO, HO, HO!!!",1197072000,43,4198,5.819218241042345
2918310,5,B000UAE7UE,"This set has 7 Christmas episodes from your favorite foul-mouthed kids but ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" is in a class by itself!!
Cartman writes a Chistmas tale full of abortions,anti-semitism, and of course,satan-worshipping forest critters.
I know I'm going straight to hell for enjoying this so much,but if my soul is the cost it is well worth the price!!!!",1195603200,5,360,5.224137931034483
2918311,5,B000UAE7UE,"Gather your family around the tree, well in this case the television, and pop this DVD into your player to experience all 7 episodes of ""South Park""'s Christmas Specials, from the very first introduction of Mr. Hanky to Christmas in Iraq to Cartman's Woodland Critter Christmas.

There have been 10 seasons of ""South Park"" released on DVD, and only 7 of those featured Christmas episodes.  The other night, in preparation for the holidays, I pulled all ten seasons out and hunted through the discs to find the episodes, having to switch DVDs every half-hour.  It took some of the fun out of the night, but now they're all on one DVD back-to-back now.  It makes a great stocking stuffer!",1195344000,18,686,4.739495798319328
2918312,3,B000UAE7UE,"Who does Christmas better than South Park?  Or rather, who finds new and disturbing ways to create a Christmas Special better than South Park?

If you're a fan of the show (and you probably are) then you're likely intimately familiar with these 7 episodes.  The episodes here are presented in chronological order and reflect exactly what you would have seen on television.  This is both good and bad.  The good; they're the episodes you want and now have.  The bad; the episodes are still censored for television and the picture quality on the older ones leaves something to be desired.  The colors will bleed regularly for the older episodes on the disc and it can be a little distracting.  I stopped noticing it heavily for the third episode on the disc.  For a show such as South Park it isn't that big of a deal, but it is noticeable.

If you're a South Park die-hard then you already have these episodes included with each season set of DVDs.  This set is mainly for the casual fan who just wants to have a collection of the Christmas Specials in time for the holidays.  The Shows themselves are great fun.  The third episode, the musical ""Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics"", is probably my least favorite.  I think I would have been able to enjoy it more if Mr. Garrison's Merry Bleaping Christmas was uncensored but oh well.  The episode ""Red Sleigh Down"" is one of the best, and anyone who has seen ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" will not live to forget it.  My favorite though is still the very first ""Mr Hankey the Christmas Poo.""  The episode is still outrageous today and they also included the live-action build-a-Mr Hankey commercial they made.

As warped as the episodes come across (Stan repeatedly says ""This is some *bleaped* up *bleap* right here,"") the episodes usually have some sort of social commentary contained in them, and at times, even a good message.  The original Christmas special points out how easily people are offended by the religious aspect of Christmas, seemingly ignoring the fact that it's a religious holiday.  ""Merry Christmas Charlie Manson"" places the emphasis on feeling good and family togetherness, even if you're family is pretty screwed up.  Though there is the episode ""A Very Crappy Christmas"" where the boys bring back the spirit of Christmas to South Park - commercialism.  And ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" really has no meaning, it's just messed up.

There are no extras here, which is disappointing, and I'm surprised they didn't include ""The Spirit of Christmas"" on this set as well.  If you want a collection of the South Park Christmas specials then this will suffice.  You're getting what you want and most places are selling it for less than 20 bucks so the price is decent.  And right now it looks like there won't be a new Christmas special this year so this will have to do.",1195344000,21,2833,4.765913757700205

The only episode I don't like is It's Christmas in Canada, because the Canadians are just annoying in South Park.  Still, I love the format for the DVD case and how it looks.  My favorite episodes are Mr. Hankey the Christmas poo, Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics, and Woodland Critter Christmas.  The other episodes besides ""Canada"" are good and funny.  This is a great DVD release and if you love South Park, you should pick this up.  It's a lot easier to watch the Christmas episodes without switching discs.

2918369,5,B000UAE7UE,"This is an excellent compilation of Christmas South Park episodes. From the first season til' the 10th season,7 episodes. Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo
Merry Christmas Charlie Manson
Mr. Hankeys Xmas Classics
A Very Crappy Christmas
Christmas In Canada
Red Sleigh Down
Woodland Critter Christmas
Those are all the episodes but the first 4 are the absolute best.
The first episode is where you get introduced to Mr. Hankey then the next is where Stan goes with the gang to Cartmans grandparents and uncle Howard & Charlie Manson break out of prison(a spoof on It's a Wonderful Life) that is my favorite.
Mr. Hankeys classics are a mix of ten short songs that are funny.
A Crappy Xmas people lose hope in the holiday and the gang makes a short story(the spirit of christmas,the very first South Park episode)
Red Sleigh Down is where Santa goes down in Iraq cuz Cartman wants to do the nicest thing ever. Spoof on Black Hawk Down
Christmas in Canada is where Ike gets taken out of the country to go back to Canada,the prime minister is changing all the rules but it turns out to be Saddam hiding in a spider hole.
Woodland Critters is Cartmans story of Christmas where the critters are Satanic and it gets crazier. The entire dvd is funny and full of oldschool classics and newer episodes but they are all  holiday episodes. Fans of South Park will love it & so will newcomers,get a taste of the oldschool stuff. The cool thing would be an all Halloween dvd.",1426636800,3,1455,4.596153846153846

2918420,5,B000UAE7UE,"It's the most wonderful time of the year. It's when we worship a piece of crap, go on a little trip to Iraq, and spend some time with Charles Manson...

...well, at least that's what we would feel like doing while we watch the episodes featured in this DVD called Christmas Time in South Park. It's always a surprise to see South Park and Christmas blend perfectly with each other. There's always satire on religious sensitivity, consumerism, and a certain Christmas poo that we all know and love. ""Christmas WHAT?!"" This is a cleverly funny show, and these Christmas episodes are a pleasure to watch. Keep in mind, though. This DVD has the first seven Christmas episodes in the entire series. The rest have been left out. If we're lucky, the powers that be might release a ""Volume 2"" of Christmas Time in South Park in the near future. But still, we have seven hilarious episodes that we can all watch and enjoy. Christmas will never be the same in South Park.
