In the Video you will see more than 30 country stars sing the song make famous by country music hall of famers. This is a totally tribute album and you will see Pee Wee King. He passed but we love him and his TN waltz performed perfectly by Kathy Mattea. If you like famous song in country music history you will not miss this. If you like new country songs, go out and ride your harley. I gonna smoke my cigar and enjoy this video once again.",989020800,,515,4.0588235294117645
