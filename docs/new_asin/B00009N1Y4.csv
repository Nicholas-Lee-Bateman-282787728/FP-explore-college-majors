1886871,5,B00009N1Y4,"Over the past 3 years after the Spurs won their first championship the league was soon dominated by the LA Lakers, whom had Phil Jackson and His new duo, Shaq and Kobe.  For 3 straight years teams and hearts were broken by this seemingly unstopable force.  Somebody had to end it.

And the year 2003 rolled by, and the Spurs were determined to figt hard, not only to reclaim what they once had, but to have David Robinson retired a happy man.  After a 60-22 record, young players who could do it, Ginobili, Jackson, and Bowen. It seemed all was well as the peices of the puzzel got closer and closer to forming.

But When Phenoix gave them a six game scare, it was now questioned wether they were even the team to beat.  And the Lakers were their next opponent; the same team that crushed the Spurs 2 years straight.  Even after a 2-0 lead the lakers pushed back, and the Spurs meltdown in game 5 would have cost them if Robert Horry(Suprisingly now the guy who saved the Spurs in the 2005 finals)woulda made a crutial 3.  Then back in LA, aw man it was just gold to see the Lakers get @$$ stomped into a 28 point loss and to see the Lakers, especially Kobe cry.(I remember when I loved the Lakers, good ol' Magic, now I call them the Los Angles Fl@mmer$).  Dallas came by and altho I'm a Spur fan, I have to say they got a lucky break with Novintski sidelined.  But Dallas still fought good without him.  Then the Nets.  I thought it would be another sweep like last year, but the nets brought their game, but unfortonutly for them their game wasn't enough for the Spurs who brought their A game, and did what they wanted to do.

The DVD does nice coverages on the Spurs outstanding season and postseason, but the bacon of this sandwhich is the extras.  Interviews with Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Malik Rose, and Steve Kerr.  And not to even think about forgeting the crutial 4th quarters of all game 6's.  The Suns game was a tight showdown;  the Lakers game is one to remember over a lifetime; the Dallas game has Steve Kerr written all over it; and the Final game of the season showed the Spurs aggresivly going a 19-0 run to close the door on the nets.  Just spectacualr in many ways.

The 2002-2003 NBA Champion San Antonio Spurs were spectacular that season as well as 2005 in a classic match(The 2 teams, my favorite teams met).  Anyone who wants to check out a hard working team or just to see the Lakers dethroned should check this out.

I was surprised to find a lack of information in the reveiws with regard to the content of this DVD.

It includes a very nice documentary that breifly covers the regular season leading to the playoffs & finals, which is thoroughly documented. The disc also includes featurettes on Duncan & Robinson. But the icing on the cake is that this DVD includes all 4 series clinching 4th quarters in their entirety!!! I think I've watched the 4th quarter of game 6 against the Lakers a dozen times!!

This DVD is the ultimate memento to one of the greatest seasons any NBA team has ever experienced!!

Can't wait for the 2004-05 NBA Champions San Antonio Spurs DVD!!

:-)

Peace

1886873,5,B00009N1Y4,"To philmarlowe 39 if you consider the 1999 season and The Spurs championship during that year as not real, let me ask you this : What if The Lakers won the title that year? Then it would be right to call their reign as also not real because as you said there were only 50 games. I look at this way if The Lakers could't win that title during that year with just a 50 game schedule and using the excuse as not ""being whipped in to  shape by Phil Jackson"", then they don't deserve to be in NBA. Whether it's 50, 60, 80 games, you always have to be prepared. It's not an excuse that you didn't play well because i't's only a 50 game schedule or you're not yet in shape. Then it only means that you're not taking the game seriously. One team during that year took the ""50 game season"" seriously and they won the champioship.

Also who cares if The Spurs are boring? As long as you win games it don't matter. Fact of the matter is they won the 2003 title and The Lakers went home crying and went on to arm themselves during the offseason ( or so they thought )with Karl Malone & Gary Payton, which didn't make any difference as The Pistons whooped their egotistical behinds in the Finals.

Lastly who needs Kobe Bryant, A.I. or attention hogging superstars on your team? This is where  Tim Duncan's greatness lies. He's a bonafide superstar that doesn't neeed to call one's attention to get noticed. He lets his game do the talking. As for Tony Parker I don't what league your watching but he's a superstar in the making. All in all this a great DVD that showcases basketball in its purest form: playing together as a team to win & not hogging the limelight to get attention. Buy this DVD if your only a true basketball fan. If you watch basketball because of whining, large egos and ballhogging this is not for you.",1101340800,7,1811,4.302052785923753
1886874,5,B00009N1Y4,"I was soooooo happy when the Spurs won the title this year, and fed the Lakers their lunch! It would have been horrible if the Lakers had won 4 straight titles, even though the NBA helped them win anyway. The best team finally won. The 2003 Spurs showed promise with David Robinson in his final season. He went out in style and the Spurs took their second title in 5 seasons. Everyone is complaining about how boring of a team the Spurs are. Well, that is just the way they have always been. San Antonio is one of the best defensive teams in NBA history, and their rough style of play is what got them to that trophy. The ratings in the NBA finals against the Nets were the lowest they had been in 27 years, and it's obvious that the NBA is going to want to boost those ratings by putting the Lakers back in it again. I have to take my hat off to the Spurs, and I hope they whip LA again!",1071619200,7,888,4.08
1886875,5,B00009N1Y4,"I read the other reviews and they helped me decide to get this DVD (I should have anyways the Spurs are my team), but I couldn't help but notice a biased LA fan whining the whole time during his review about 99 and how the Spurs are boring, LOL, don't be mad because you got swept in 99 buddy it counted and you know it, LA fans and their excuses all the time as to why another team won.  Spurs went though a grueling first round versus Phoenix and beat the 3 time champs to basically ice the title, we all know Dallas never had a shot in the WCF's Dirk or not because their interior D is horrible, and this DVD showcases all of the games and proves me right once again.  A true NBA fan should pick this one up and give a look, and Spurs fans this is a MUST OWN, Davids final season and going out with a bang is worth it alone!  You will see the moments that made your heart pump fast and the ups and downs known as the playoffs and enjoy every last second of this DVD, especially the big fourth quarters in Dallas and game 6 against NJ, total domination by the Spurs.  This one is a must own, go and get it today.......",1071446400,6,1120,4.00896860986547
1886876,1,B00009N1Y4,"Congrats to the 2002-2003 San Antonio Spurs for winning their first **REAL** NBA Championship.  The lockout-shortened 1999 season was horrible, folks.  MJ wasn't around.  Phil Jackson had not yet whipped the Lakers into shape.  An abbreviated training camp meant that most players were horrendously out-of-shape by the time the season started (e.g., Seattle's Vin Baker who missed something like 21 free throws IN A ROW to start the season).  So, 1999 never happened.  Congrats to the Spurs.  They were the best team of 2002-2003 and deserved to win.
However, the problem with this DVD is that the Spurs are the most boring NBA team since the 1970s to win an NBA championship.  After San Antone eliminated the Lakers and Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki went down with an injury, there was no point in watching the rest of the 2003 playoffs.  Who do the Spurs have that is interesting to watch?  NO ONE!  Not even Tim Duncan--who is a bona-fide great player and a future Hall of Famer.  He's the Pete Sampras of the NBA.  One of the greats, but about as fun to watch as drying paint.  David Robinson is interesting as a Grace Jones look-a-like, but is really too nice to care about.  I know he does a lot of charity work.  Good for him.  Wa-hoo.  And even though Tony Parker is one of the 50 Most Beautiful People, he is not an elite point guard.  Why do you think the Spurs wanted to sign Jason Kidd so badly once the series was over?
The Spurs are dull because they have no one you can really love or hate (e.g. Kobe, Shaq, Phil, A.I., T-Mac).  That--aside from exciting basketball--is why people watch the NBA.  Plus, San Antonio's no-frills style of basketball may be fundamentally sound, but it is boring boring BORING.  The Nets-Spurs series had the lowest TV ratings in 22 YEARS for an NBA Finals.  And no, this isn't case of John & Jane Q. Viewer not appreciating good basketball.  I remember one game in the series where at halftime neither team had broken the 35 point mark!  UGH!
Fortunately, there is good news on the horizon.  Grace Jones retired after the Spurs clinched, and the Lakers signed Gary Payton and Karl Malone.  The Sacramento Queens look pretty tough this year too, and a rematch of the 2002 Western Conference Finals (in which L.A. gutted out a Game 7 victory in a hostile environment on the road) will be just the thing to raise the spirits of true NBA fans, Commissioner Stern, and ABC-TV executives.
GO LAKERS!!!
PS:  I would have given this DVD zero stars, but Amazon.com wouldn't let me.",1071014400,,2509,4.615384615384615
1886877,5,B00009N1Y4,"The feature program is probably only 50 minutes and glosses over the earlier playoff series pretty quickly.  But this DVD has great extras, the highlight being near-complete 4th quarters from each clinching game 6.  Watching Kobe cry as the Lakers got demolished in game 6 is alone worth the price.",1060819200,8,298,4.94

1886925,5,B00009N1Y4,"The 02-03 Championship has always been my favorite one of the four Spurs Championships! That being said at the time this DVD came out I was deployed to Iraq and didn't get the chance to buy in stores and once I got home I couldn't find it online and eventually gave up and forgot about it, until a few weeks ago while browsing Amazon. Not only had I forgotten about the DVD I had also forgotten exactly how much I had once loved this season. From David Robinson's career fairy tale ending to Stephen Jackson's in-game heroics and Tony and Manu establishing themselves in the NBA it did my heart good to see these moments again.
