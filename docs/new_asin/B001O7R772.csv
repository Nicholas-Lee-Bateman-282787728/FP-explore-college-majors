3729167,2,B001O7R772,"I was looking forward to Blue Murder, since I usually enjoy the British mysteries. This fourth season--I didn't see the rest--was a loser. Bad plotting and stock characters-cop goes undercover in prison and gets found out, etc.",1251676800,,227,5.162162162162162
3729168,3,B001O7R772,"3.5 stars.  DCI Janine Lewis and her Greater Manchester Priority Homicide squad are back for several more helpings of murder and mayhem in the fourth season of this top British crime series.  The show has always had high production values, but this set debuts spiffy new opening titles that hint at a bigger budget due to the show's success.  I was gratified to see that this season includes 6 episodes, which we haven't enjoyed since the show's debut season--last year's paltry 3-episode set is doubled here.  Set 4 features some of the most complex storylines to date, as DS Shapp (Nick Murchie) and DI Mayne (Ian Kelsey) both get to shine in individual episode arcs.  In addition to displaying that contemporary Manchester has shed its grimy, industrial image and is in fact a vital, attractive urban center deserving the moniker ""The London of the North"", one of the episodes ventures to the surrounding countryside, showing verdant, rolling hills and pastoral life as well.  So much to like, but I have a few twinges of regret, too; much like its American counterpart, ""The Closer"", as this much-lauded series has become an established success, some of the quirky charm of earlier days has been sacrificed to the well-oiled machine.  This set is the darkest in tone yet, as DCI Lewis wrestles with some significant problems at home, and wonders whether a career change is in order--she's been offered a promotion to a desk job with nothing to recommend it except its regular hours.  Also unresolved remains the frustratingly platonic flirtation between Lewis and her second-in-command, Richard.  The sooner these two (or rather, the screenwriters) can find a way to remove the professional impediment to their personal relationship going forward, the better for us!  Some might say to have Janine and Richard finally become a couple would signal the end of the series, but I think there could be interesting dramatic possibilities.  Please get these two together before Charlotte is in high school, for goodness sakes.

American viewers accustomed to a longer season in which to develop storylines and character relationships have to get used to the more choppy and episodic mode of British series.  The difference seems to be, whereas American TV characters have no life outside of their viewership, British writers carry on as though the characters have been continuing to live their lives irrespective of the audience.  So there are usually large gaps in the action between the conclusion of one set and the start of another, which accounts for why DS Shapp is on trial for his conduct in a case that occurred while we weren't watching, or why Rhea Bailey as DC Lisa Goodall has been summarily replaced without comment by another young, biracial female detective played by Belinda Everett.  It can be a little disconcerting until the viewer is caught up with what happened to the members of the squad last time we saw them. This installment continues, and even improves upon, the previously high quality of this series, but I find it becoming less like itself and more like ""Prime Suspect"" than formerly.  I hope they can restore my favorite (and one and only) Earth Mother detective to her former good humor, and devise a way to give her some personal happiness in the next season.  Janine deserves it.",1248652800,2,3311,4.958408679927667
3729169,5,B001O7R772,"Originally took a blind leap buying Set 1 because of Caroline Quentin's work in Jonatrhan Creek. As soon as my wife and I started watching this clever and very well made series we were hooked. I have since purchased all available episodes and can't wait for the next installment.
Give this wonderful series a try, you won't be disappointed.",1247788800,5,340,4.779661016949152
3729170,5,B001O7R772,"I have seasons 1 thru 3 of this series and must say it is quite good. A female is promoted to DI over a bunch of British detectives and she tries to balance her stressed personal life with managing her subordinates and solve crimes. The episodes are short, but the story is developed quickly and is very suspenseful. One could compare this series to ""Prime Suspect"" but it is really quite different, with a bit of humor thrown in. The only real similarity is the fact that a woman is the key character. If you are into British mysteries then this is a series that you will want to watch.",1245974400,5,587,4.345454545454546
3729171,5,B001O7R772,"""Blue Murder: Set 4,"" the latest available television episodes in the hit British mystery series/police procedural, arrives on these shores.  The Blue Murder pilot debuted in the U.K. in May 2003, on ITV (Independent Television Stations); where it drew almost 8.4 million viewers, a number seldom heard of there.  The series, which was created by native midlands author Cath Staincliffe, has continued to do very well in the U.K., consistently ranking number one in its time slot.  It has, unfortunately for us, never aired on broadcast TV here: the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" calls it ""The best British mystery you haven't seen....""  Luckily, we can at least get it on DVD; this 2-volume boxed set runs approximately 271 minutes; it includes all six episodes from Series 5, which will air in the U.K. in 2009.  (Acorn Media has released all previous episodes in Sets 1-3.)  Even more luckily, Acorn Media has given us subtitles, as this set, like its predecessors, is located in Manchester.  And, while the Manchester accent and usage fall interestingly on the ear, we're not familiar with them this side of the pond.

To begin with Manchester, it sure has cleaned up very well: centuries of black industrial grime gone, revealing a beautiful city, with interesting, varied architecture.  And a diverse, varied population: the M.E. in the current series is surely a descendant of the Indian subcontinent.  The series stars the talented, award-winning actress Caroline Quentin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-Behaving-Badly-The-Complete-Collection-The-Original-British-TV-Series/dp/B000H6SXZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men Behaving Badly - The Complete Collection (The Original British TV Series)</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Begins-Series-1/dp/B0012EBV60/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Begins - Series 1</a>); as Detective Constable Inspector Janine Lewis, a hard-driving, high-profile contemporary detective and single mother of four, who must always try to balance the demands of family, where she's just ""Mum,"" and career, where she's ""Boss.""  Quentin was once best known as a comic actress, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jonathan-Creek-Season-One/dp/B000GYI3MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jonathan Creek - Season One</a>); but in this series she shows substantial dramatic chops, as well as her comedic gifts.  Mind you, she doesn't play Janine Lewis as another Jane Tennyson, Helen Mirren's tough female cop; but, then, she's not intended to.  Ian Kelsey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CASUALTY-Series-1-BBC-Series/dp/B0026P1PAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CASUALTY - Series 1 (BBC Series)</a>) costars as Detective Inspector Richard Mayne, Janine's second in command, and erstwhile romantic interest - though in that regard, he seems to be getting a bit doughy of face to me. Among the station house company, Nicholas Murchie stands out as Detective Sergeant Tony Schap, and seems to be enjoying some beefed up roles.

Volume 1 consists of the following:
Episode 1: Private Sins. (Part 1) An illegal Byelorussian immigrant and private investigator is found murdered in a parking lot.  Lewis supervises the investigation with more than the usual stress at home; it makes her think an offered promotion, that would get her off the streets, isn't the worst idea.  Meanwhile, Schap, who gets a lot of facetime in this arc, seems to be running his own covert investigation.
Episode 2: Private Sins (Part 2). A key informant ends up dead, and Schap's secrets start coming out.  Furthermore, in a story populated by ex-cops and firemen, many possible motives for murder start appearing.
 Episode 3: Tooth & Claw.  Veterinarian Ruth Turner is found strangled, on the route of her daily run near rural, bucolic in appearance, Hunter's Low.  As Janine and her team start looking into the case, some of the village's seamy activities come to light.

Volume 2 gives us:
 Episode 4: Having It All.  A defeat in a cheer leading competition starts the unraveling of the team and its coaches.  Melanie Gaskell discovers her mother Helen, team coach, bludgeoned to death in the garage.
 Episode 5: This Charming Man.  Local hero/rock star Jack Taylor, charismatic leader of an up and coming band, dies in his apartment after a sold-out concert.  The cops must find their way through the Manchester music scene, where Richard keeps claiming to have some experience.
 Episode 6: Inside.  Bernard Aspen has been in prison for 15 years of a life sentence, for a murder his family insists he didn't commit.  He's found drowned in a washroom.  Richard decides to go inside undercover.

The series has been filmed with a liberal hand, no shortage of cars and people around. The dramas are substantial, the mysteries gritty and challenging, frequently told from the female point of view.  The cop shop scenes are lively, leavened with sly humor, and interspersed with Janine's family business.  In fact, as everybody grows into their parts, I'm just getting to like this series better and better.",1242259200,20,5151,5.778807947019867

8329843,4,B001O7R772,Very disappointing that there are only a few episodes made. Other DVD's have far more episodes,1438387200,,94,4.9375
8329844,5,B001O7R772,Wish the series didn't end.  Really good British detective series - realistic.,1433376000,,78,5.5
8329845,3,B001O7R772,We have the first 2 seasons and they were both excellent. Season 3 & 4 we ordered and have viewed at least once. Season 4 is better than season 3 only from the standpoint that all 2 DVD's actually contain mysteries! The actors were very hard to understand with their heavy British (Manchester) accents for some reason as compared to the first 2 sets. For what I paid and this includes bonus point credits both Seasons 3 & 4 are way overpriced. This will be our last  purchase as to Blue Murder.,1310947200,,494,4.369565217391305
8329846,5,B001O7R772,"I loved this series never saw it when I lived in London a few years ago. I've purchased all 4 sets I hope they create more just like it. Caroline Quentin is absolutely fabulous. It's wonderful to see a star that isn't a size 5 for a change. Great interplay between the team members!!

I buy all my English Mystery's from Amazon. Used to use BBC America but their episodes always run behind Amazon's.  Thank you Amazon - you always ensure that you deal with reputable dealers. I live in another country and I have no problem receiving my DVD's.",1285891200,,543,4.42
8329847,4,B001O7R772,"This is a very good series with a woman chief inspector and her unit of detectives. She is divorced with three children and in constant tension between the competing tugs of both roles.  She is off and on interested in her second in command but until this fourth series he has been unwilling to commit to one woman.  These are good mysteries but nothing spectacular. I couldn't help comparing it to its predecessor, Helen Mirren as the chief in Prime Suspect.  This series is not that good but it is entertaining and is good runner up in the woman in charge mystery series.  Give it a try.  I've watched all 4 and don't regret it.
