8234040,4,B000YSO8R4,"My sincere apologies for giving a 2 star Eric Roberts film, 4 stars, but I really did enjoy the film. Three thieves steal a diamond. Fat Anthony (Manny Sosa) gets shot and killed while the other two escape. Fat Anthony ate the diamond. Later at the morgue, one of the two robbers gets caught attempting to retrieve said diamond and does hard time. The film then moves on to a question of who has the diamond, a cheating wife, a set up, and a private detective taking pictures of the whole thing.

The film was designed, at least partly, to be a comedy, but the lines that fail are funny at the attempt of being funny...like a four year old putting on her mommy's make-up. She can't do it correctly, but you laugh at the attempt. The scenes of Eric Roberts driving in the vintage Corvette were funny as it was one of those deal where the car never moves with him behind the wheel, just the scenery.

The plots twists like a 60's who-dun-it comedy. The dialogue was horrible in a funny way.

Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex and nudity.

I found this near gem as part of a 10 film multi pack called ""Feel the Heat."" $5.00 US Walmart.",1434412800,,1123,4.333333333333333
