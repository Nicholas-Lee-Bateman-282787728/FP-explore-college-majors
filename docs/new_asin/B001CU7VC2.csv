8326320,3,B001CU7VC2,"I had heard about this DVD from the website of the builders.  Castle Magic is the website of the Idaho based castle building team.  Although it is definitely not long enough in my book, it is very well shot and presented, it has the feel of the other History/Discovery channel documentary series.  A little dramatic tension with the deadline and crew is of course part of these types of videos, as is the relative inexperience of the Host, allowing the builders to teach him the basics of castle building as they race to get it completed in time. The in the field footage is inter spliced with information that seems to have been pulled straight out of the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Castles-Fortresses-Book-4-Castles/dp/0760771871/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Castles & Fortresses Book & 4 Castles</a>&nbsp;An excellent book in it's own right.

The DVD is not a commercially stamped disc. it is print on demand and as such you will receive an obviously burned disc that although it has a nice label still seems homemade.",1327017600,,1072,5.401197604790419
8326321,4,B001CU7VC2,"I've been following these guys building castles for years now at [...]  They actually build real castles and they appear magnificent from the website.  When I realized that someone made a documentary about them, I had to order it.  I've watched it 3 times and i think what they do is cool as all get out. The documentary is kind of tailored to a 'surprise!' ending, where a castle tower is completed and given to a man by his wife. I would have liked more about the how they do what they do, but this is very cool stuff.",1236211200,,520,4.232323232323233
