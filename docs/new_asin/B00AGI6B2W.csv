5424312,4,B00AGI6B2W,"The dance moves are fun, cool and easy to follow.
My favourite move is the James Brown and I cannot wait to show off my new moves next time I go to a club or a party.
I like that the moves are suitable for men and women.
The DVD show the moves from different angles, which make the moves easier to follow.
Hip Hop Basics and Beyond is great if you want to gain confidence when dancing, want to improve on your hip hop/dancing or just want a fun way to get fit.

I also own Sexy Moves For The Club and Girls Night Out (for women) which I love, love, love. I use the moves from these DVD's all the time and my friends and family are always asking me to teach them how I dance.",1390867200,2,674,3.8840579710144927
5424313,5,B00AGI6B2W,"For someone who isn't too great at dancing this video is amazing.  They break it down so anyone can learn to dance!  The step by step process makes it so easy to learn, and its so fun.  They make it look so easy.  I wish I had this video before now, but am so glad I got it.  They make it comfortable and teach you how to move every part of your body, even your hands!

Very good product!! I even got my boyfriend into it who NEVER dances what so ever.  He loves it also!! Very impressed, thanks for the help with the dance moves! :)  We will be practicing everyday and can't wait to go out to the club with our new moves.",1390435200,,622,3.92
5424314,5,B00AGI6B2W,"Overall, I highly recommend the video/his instruction. This video gives you just what it say: simple dance moves that get you away from being a wallflower. While you still need refinement and confidence to actually not look like a fool, this video is a great first step in that direction. Practice until the moves are smooth and you have faith in what you're doing. This will translate to the dance floor. Even if you aren't perfect, these moves get you out there and having more fun than WISHING you had a little something to just get out there.

I do not have experience in using these at the clubs, nor have I shown my girlfriend to gain feedback. But, I feel his instruction techniques and words of wisdom make this an excellent product. Like others stated, dancing to modern music would have been cool, but understandable why they cant. All other freebies on youtube I haven't seen with actual music either. Thanks for the vid, guys/gals!",1390176000,,943,4.680722891566265

5424316,5,B00AGI6B2W,"I have always loved music but never had a clue how to dance. This DVD is filled with moves that with a little practice even I can do. Some moves are chill and some look very complex. When Brian breaks it down for you step by step the most amazing thing happens...It suddenly becomes understandable,easy and fun. Hehe a favorite of mine is the ""James Brown"".Just take one step at a time,practice practice practice, add another step and soon you wil have an arsenal of moves that seamlessly flow. I'm tired of watching from the table or bar, now I can get on the floor and join the fun.",1356825600,,584,4.36697247706422
5424317,5,B00AGI6B2W,"These DVDs are brilliant- they teach `real' dancing, that people do in nightclubs. I've never really known how to dance in a club, but I now know some moves!
The dance moves all look really good, and are the sort of moves that could be used in any club to make someome look like a natural dancer. The moves are all broken down into easily copyable stages, and when practised they come together quickly.  I am inexperienced but found the moves easy to learn. The good thing is that a repertoire of moves can be learnt in a relatively short time.",1356652800,,544,4.3861386138613865

If you were one of those guys who simply hung around on the outskirts of the dance floor because you were shy or lacked the necessary skills to move around the dance floor, now you can do it and do it with a woman. This DVD will get you going fast. There are no acrobatics so nearly anyone who has the will to do a little practicing can become an accomplished clubber. A number of easy lessons will show you various moves and steps to get you going quickly. If you don't get this set now and learn the simple moves, you will remain like those other do nothing guys who just hang around and drink!",1356566400,,619,4.166666666666667
5424319,4,B00AGI6B2W,"Pros:

Brian does an amazing job, yet again! Every move is broken down, step-by-step along with a thorough explanation for each step.  What I like about this DVD set in particular is that Brian and his backup dancers give a view of what each step looks like from behind (some moves are shown from different angles).  This set includes a lot of different popular hiphop moves, old and new.  Some steps could even be pulled-off dancing to different genres of music.  Like in every other DVD set, the backup dancers provide you with different styles/variations, particularly with hand movements, so that you could adopt the one that fits your style.

Cons:

I couldn't think of many cons.  Why list them?  Because I want to give an objective review.  First, I don't see myself using many of the moves shown in the DVD.  I understand that they are taught to viewers (us) because the other, more advanced steps that I WOULD want to try build from the not-so-appealing moves.  Next, the music.  I know that one of the reasons why the music choice is sub par is because of music rights/licensing, etc.  I would like to see a DVD where they use songs that are similar to what is out today (I know, I know, songs get old QUICK; however, when I go out to clubs, I hear a lot of songs from ""yesterday"").  Lastly, even though at the end of each DVD they go through every step, in order, to help you practice transitioning from move to move, I would like to see a couple of scenarios where they have us practice in a non-sequential order.  It's not as if I'm going to dance to all of the steps, in order, when I'm out.  For these reasons, it lost a star in my eyes.  I whole star is a bit harsh, but I wasn't able to give a 1/2 star..so, I rate this 4.5 stars

Bottom line:  Even though the cons appear to be ""longer"" than the pros, I was just nit-picking.  The cons are very minor and petty. The pros out weigh the cons dramatically!! Get this DVD set.  You will not be disappointed.  It's worth the price.  You'll learn what you need to know to be confident out there.",1356566400,,2057,4.338582677165355
5424320,5,B00AGI6B2W,"I am super impressed with this DVD set. There are a lot of moves to choose from. I think the main strength of the product is that all of the moves broken down into simple steps that anyone can learn. With a little practice you can get it down. The other big strength is the usefulness of the moves. You could use these in a variety of settings, from a club to a house party. Plus, knowing that I can dance has made me more confident in general. How often do you hear some great music and want to move your body a little but you don't because you don't know what to do?

I also love the backup dancers. You can tell Jemel is just a cool dude who lives to dance, and seeing him and Casey add their own flavors to the moves really expands the possibilities. Rather than looking like a card-board cutout dancer, this product encourages you to add your own flavor to the moves once you get them down. This made it a ton of fun for me. Dancing is also about expression, right?

For the price, I think this product is a no-brainer. I've taken hip hop classes and tried to learn from youtube videos, but this has been the easiest and quickest way for me to learn so far.",1355961600,,1162,4.1371681415929205
5424321,5,B00AGI6B2W,"I just watched once and followed the moves.  Anyone who want to learn hip hop dance will enjoy this DVD set.
Since this is hip hop dance, the moves are good to use in a night club or some party.
I always feel uncomfortable hanging out with friends in a club since I cannot dance, but this DVD set should help me practice.
This DVD is good for beginners since the instructions are easy to follow.
I will keep watching and practice more until I feel comfortable with the moves.",1355616000,,475,4.277777777777778

When I unwrapped it and opened the case it was in, it literally fell out because the disc was not attached and had about too many scratches on it to count. It really looks well USED. I have only played the first session on it and it has played ok with all the scratches on it. What really erks me is paying over twenty dollars for USED instead of NEW products. I just hope the rest of the the dvd plays ok.",1401235200,,484,3.898989898989899
8551375,1,B00AGI6B2W,"I was really hoping this 2 dvd set would come thru on two basic factors and unfortunately it failed totally on one and almost entirely on the other.

1. Instruction:  I could not learn from this guy unless the move was so basic I could learn it by mimicking the move.  He tells you to mirror him but then uses the wrong foot, confuses you by saying things like follow with this foot and then land on that foot WHAT are you thinking?  Did you watch this yourself before you put it on the market?  What a joke.

2. The actual moves:  Some of these moves are flat out hilarious and would never be used in any hip hop venue.  A few others are so old-school that you may only end up using them to prove you know them (or when intoxicated).  Its as if he came up with them himself in front of his bathroom mirror.  The only moves that are somewhat worth while are the c-walk and the glide, but he teaches you only a portion of the c-walk, going constantly from one side and back again, staying in one small area of the dance floor and not actually walking anywhere as the move is suppose to allow for.  Again though, good luck learning from this guy as he will completely confuse you as you try to follow along, especially when he teaches the glide, which I only learned by doing about a dozen rewinds and slow motions

All and all I can say with certainty that this purchase was a waist both my money and more importantly my time.",1398124800,6,1425,4.198529411764706
8551376,5,B00AGI6B2W,This video was a little different than I expected but that may be the reason why it was fun. A lot of work to get the moves but they can be accomplished. I had fun doing it!,1396828800,,173,3.7027027027027026
8551377,4,B00AGI6B2W,"I saw the one-star rating suggesting the product was a scam. I was tempted to move on but the product description sounded exactly what I was looking  for, so I took the time to read ALL of the reviews. I felt there was enough information to determine it was worth a shot, or perhaps I was just desperate! LOL. Now that I'm watching it, I'm certain that the overly negative reviewer has clearly not watched this product.

Although I've not viewed other similar products for comparison, I have to say that Hip Hop Basics is good, maybe very good in that it delivers what I was looking for: hip hop steps. The surprise for me is the very deliberate structure which completely breaks down the steps making them very easy to understand & master. As a long-time skating coach, I appreciate both the effectiveness of this approach to instruction and its rarity.

The production is underwhelming but gets the job done.

This is a 3 camera How-To Dance in a static location. The vid quality is fine. The soundtrack is generic.",1392422400,,1017,4.602209944751381
8551378,5,B00AGI6B2W,"Hello everyone!  Figured Id write up a super detailed review of this DVD as I didn't see any written here yet and I love these DVD series.  They helped me out in the club so the least I can do is write up a review to help other people learn more about whats offered here.

WHO AM I AND WHY I BOUGHT THIS DVD IN THE FIRST PLACE

I have many of their other videos including the original Hip Hop Moves for the Club, Show Off and Impress, Turn Up The Heat and Dance The Night Away.  Im a dude who goes out a lot with his friends to bars and clubs on the weekend and absolutely hated that feeling of being on the sidelines watching as girls danced and had fun.  What I hated more was seeing dudes come out of nowhere, dance like buffoons and still have fun.  I didn't have the confidence to get out on the dance floor myself and felt I should take some dance lessons or something.  I didn't really think salsa or anything like that was what I was looking for (I live in a smaller city that doesnt have a lot of options in terms of dance lessons) so through Googling, I found this DVD series.  Ive used the DVDs mentioned above for about a year now and I love them as they have helped me with confidence in the club tremendously.  I am no way a perfect dancer or anything (I practice every once and a while but probably no where near what I should but I still do when I can) but I can definitely keep up with people in the club comfortably.  Actually, I have had a BUNCH of girls in the club tell me Im an awesome dancer and they would rather dance with me because I had rhythm - even though I don't consider myself to be Usher or anything  but hey, it at least shows some major progress so thats good!  Maybe its more of a confidence thing of being comfortable showing off some moves on the dance floor rather than complete technique (hey Im not perfect), but either way its a boost that Ill gladly take!  Now Ill stop gabbing about myself and get onto the video.

THE CONTENT OF HIP HOP BASICS AND BEYOND

The videos are broken down into individual segments for each dance move which is nice if you want to practice a certain move for that day or week (instead of having to fast forward throughout the whole thing).  This is actually ideal because the way I found to be the best way for me to learn these videos is to watch through them a few times the whole way through for about a week or two just to see what is available.  Then I would learn each individual move for a few days or week or so to get fully comfortable and confident with it.  There are a lot of moves here and you probably aren't going to watch this DVD one or two times then bust out all of them in weekend at the club.  As with any DVD in this series, I found it beneficial to find a handful of moves I really liked and was comfortable with and practiced those heavily.  You should still learn the other moves too, but you probably will find your grooves and stick with those  then eventually expand upon the other moves as your comfort level grows.  These moves aren't choreography either  no dance routines or anything like that.  Just a bunch of moves to be comfortable with and you then can adapt to the music that is playing at the club.

There are 3 instructors (the main instructor and 2 backup) who all go through the moves.  I think this is good because as they are showing the move at full speed, each of them have their own style and flair to add to the move so you can see different slight variations of the move.  They never move too fast or rush through anything so it is a very comfortable pace to follow along with.  The moves start out with them showing you what the move is, then they break down the movements piece by piece very slowly so that you can get the hang of it.  They show it at different angles also so you can see what the move looks like from the front, the side and the back.  I never had an issue with figuring something out because I couldn't see it properly.  The only thing I would criticize (slight) was the girl on the right side.  That corner of the background was too dark and she was wearing all black.  You couldn't see her too well (poor girl!)  But nonetheless, the instructors do a fantastic job  hence why I bought more than one of their videos.

Compared to the other videos they have, the moves in Hip Hop Basics and Beyond are still groove oriented but have a bit more flair to them to make them stand out more.  There isn't any wild flailing or anything that would make you look like a try-hard (easy to spot those guys trying to do some crazy dance just for attention).  Nothing too flashy and over the top, but definitely a complete vast improvement beyond the boring general bobbing, grooving and grinding that you see some people do in the club.  You will look like someone who actually knows some moves.  Even if you cant do these moves perfectly or to a T, people at least see that you have a sense of rhythm - which is pretty nice.  The main thing I learned from using these moves is to just have fun with it and you cant go wrong.  You have fun, the confidence rubs off, then the girls have fun dancing with you! Ha

I would say my favorite moves from this DVD are The Two Step, The James Brown, Heel Toe, Zig Zag, The Jerk and the C Walk.  I love them because they groove very nicely and subtly without taking up a lot of space.  Some of the clubs I go to get pretty crowded and you don't have much space for large steps and fancy spins or anything like that (not that this DVD series has anything crazy like that).  All the moves are able to flow together very nicely as well so you don't actually look like you are practicing a dance move.  The more you can flow your moves together, the smoother everything looks.

WHO IS IT GOOD FOR?

If you're a ABSOLUTE beginner, I might have to recommend Hip Hop Moves for the Club or Show Off and Impress before moving onto Hip Hop Basics and Beyond.  The instructors do a FANTASTIC job of breaking up the moves into small segments that you can learn slowly and learn each progression of the move, but these moves might be a tad tough for an absolute beginner.  Dont get me wrong  it is still absolutely doable as a beginner and I don't want to scare anyone off.  The moves aren't super flashy or overly complicated, but it does involve getting used to using your hips and being loose in the shoulders in order to pull off well and I had an easier time learning those basics from Hip Hop Moves for the Club.  But at the same time, I started off with Moves for the Club so maybe it doesnt matter which DVD you start off with as long as you practice.  If you already dance in the club and are looking to add some extra moves to your repertoire, then jump right in!

With that being said, YOU MUST PRACTICE THESE MOVES.  This isn't something you are going to watch 2 times then be breakdancing all over the dance floor.  Put your time in  even if it is just one move a day (each move is about 5-10 minutes long which is perfect for at least practicing once a day).  Heck, replay that move 2 or 3 times and you practiced 30 minutes a day on your dancing.  Keep in mind though, if you aren't a dancer or don't have much dancing experience, you may have some trouble with loosing up your hips and shoulders to have these moves come out slick  but that isn't any fault of the DVD or instructors.  You just gotta practice!

FINAL THOUGHTS

I love these series!  I don't have any major criticisms with any of the DVDs they have made.  They are all easy to follow, do a great job of breaking down the moves and each move isn't too long to practice.  If you are practicing each move individually, they are no longer than say. 10 minutes tops so you have no reason to not practice a bit each day.  Minus the lighting being a tad dark, everything is very well done.  You can hear the instructor very clearly and the music in the background doesnt drown out his voice.  The production quality, the moves, the instructionsI would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to learn some moves in their home rather than pay for some dance studio!  Just remember PRACTICE!",1391904000,9,8122,4.206985769728331
