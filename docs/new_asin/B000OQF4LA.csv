8186312,5,B000OQF4LA,"Victoria Boutenko (the original creator of green smoothies) presents her argument as to why it is so important to add greens into your diet. This argument is a convincing one to say the least. I thought that this dvd explained the concept of health and green smoothies very well.

I gave it a 5 star rating because the information is priceless!",1286755200,3,344,4.639344262295082

8186314,5,B000OQF4LA,"This DVD breaks down many topics in a easy to understand format.
Victoria is an excellent speaker who captivates the viewer with her charm, quick sense of humour and original speaking style.

I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants a better understanding of the benefits of greens, as well as solid nutritional advice and recommendation not available anywhere else.

The part I found extremely fascinating is where Victoria explains acidity vs. alkalinity, and how understanding the  PH levels of foods are critical for maintaining good health.

This DVD is loaded with information that will change the way you view your health and wellbeing.  My 77 year old father watched this video and had this to say: ""I wish I had known this information before my surgery.""  The author conducted intensive research which revealed results that are considered revolutionary in the twenty-first century.  I strongly recommend this DVD to everyone.",1193961600,13,517,5.119047619047619
8186318,5,B000OQF4LA,"Heard the hype? Believe it? Reject the green mumbo jumbo. If you're in either camp, this lecture is for you. Boutenko goes in depth in her discussion of why raw foods are the ideal human diet, clearly illustrates the human connection to the chimpanzee while delineating our health and diet differences, and as always, provides incredibly personal examples from her own life about her journey into the world of raw foods. The transition from ""normal"" eater to one who is conscious of the results of his/her food choices is especially important in the world we live in today. Like her other works, this DVD is informational and inspirational to both those who believe and the skeptical mind. The biggest highlight of the DVD is the wealth of scientific research which has taken the Boutenko family from one of faith in a new way to proving how the lifestyle works, using scientific proof and evidence.",1182556800,13,899,4.8441558441558445
