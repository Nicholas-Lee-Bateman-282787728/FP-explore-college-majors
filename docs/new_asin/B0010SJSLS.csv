8238355,4,B0010SJSLS,"When Hollywood branded her as just another overweight and unemployable star, Kirstie Alley hit back with her very own television series. FAT ACTRESS revolves around a somewhat-fictionalised Kirstie as she battles and schemes to reinvent herself in fame and in life.

FAT ACTRESS is a great show, because it features Kirstie Alley playing an alternate version of her own persona, plus a range of guest stars who aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves. Much of the dialogue was improvised, which gives a freshness to the episodes.

The main characters in FAT ACTRESS are Kirstie, her personal assistant Eddie Falcone (Bryan Callen), hairdresser Kevyn (Rachael Harris); and diet guru Quinn Taylor-Scott (Kelly Preston), who eats Kleenex tissues.

EPISODE LISTING:

""Crack for Good"" - Kirstie's crackhead brother arrives for a visit, just as Kirstie is trying to get a free kitchen makeover on ""Oprah"". Guest starring Connie Stevens, Christopher McDonald, Geoffrey Lewis, and Larry King.

""Crybaby McGuire"" - Kirstie's new man is just a little bit too sensitive, as she and her assistants discover during a weekend getaway. Guest starring Bill Smitrovich and Merv Griffin.

""Hold This"" - With her holding deal about to expire, Kirstie will stoop to new depths... Guest starring Jeff Zucker and Rhea Perlman.

FAT ACTRESS is a side-splitting comedy series that will be remembered for a very long time. Kirstie Alley gives a fearless performance that sees her into some very graphic and confronting material, yet she still manages to be the same loveable Kirstie that endeared her to ""Cheers"" and ""Veronica's Closet"". The supporting cast is first-rate, especially Kelly Preston as the Botox-lipped Quinn; and Mayim Bialik (TV's ""Blossom"") will surprise you with her cutting self-parody.

The DVD includes bonus audio commentaries and cast biography pages.",1202774400,2,1850,5.333333333333333
