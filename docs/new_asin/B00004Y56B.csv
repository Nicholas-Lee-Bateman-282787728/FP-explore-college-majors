7926499,5,B00004Y56B,"""X-Men: Cable--Time Fugitive"" consists of a 2-part episode from the animated X-Men adventures.  In this story the mutant superhero team gets caught in the conflict between Bishop and Cable, time travelers with their own agendas.  The story opens in New York in the year 3999, during a fierce battle.
This 2-parter is very violent and action-packed; lots of mayhem and explosions.  The story overall is cleverly structured, and makes good use of the time travel theme.  And while I didn't feel that the story attained the epic sweep which it could have had, it's definitely worthwhile for X-Men fans.",1085702400,,599,5.02020202020202
7926500,5,B00004Y56B,"I recently purchased this video and relived the suspense, mysteriousness, and wonder that comes with it.  I hadn't remembered how amazing this story is.  The x-men series is the only time that I think time travel has been done superbly.  There are some amazing fight scenes on this.  If you ask me, Cable, Bishop, and Wolverine are probably the best three warriors of all time.  Imagine the three of them duking it out all believing their cause is right.  That is what this video is.  Wolverine is trying to better human-mutant relations, while Bishop is trying to prevent as disease, and Cable is trying to help the disease to occur.  Find out all the details and who wins and the results only only purchasing this video.",1005955200,3,722,4.674603174603175

I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of american animated series(I rather watching anime in step) but X-men is simply different. It got my attention since day one and after all this years it still has a special place in my heart. I just love the way the story and events develop. The character development is just great and I can say their is NOT any other american serie that can ever compare to this one. Hope people feel the same way as I do...",1001116800,2,535,4.203883495145631
