5163836,5,B008H6GHJM,"This Disney movie Classic collection: Gnome Mobile, Darby O'Gill, Family Band and the Happiest Millionaire:, was received in excellent condition and very fast service. The movies are wonderfull and the speedy service of MovieMars is always excellent.  I personally believe they are one of the best sellers with Amazon.  I have never had any problem that was not taken care of by MovieMars if they supplied and shipped a movie I purchased.  This movie set was wonderful and very enjoyable.  I know I will continue to enjoy it for years to come. Thank you Amazon and MovieMars for continued great service.  Doris Seltzer",1360972800,,618,4.961165048543689

5164207,4,B008H6GHJM,"It had been ages since I saw any of the films in this four-movie edition of Disney films.  I had heard a lot about Darby O'Gill, but had never seen it until now.  It's a respectable film, as are the others.  Typical Disney canned technical issues are offset by extravagant sets, special effects, good acting and decent direction.

The technical aspect that holds back a better film is the continued use of processed monaural sound for the films, giving them a real unnatural quality.  Fortunately Disney caught up to the 20th and then 21st centuries, so their films don't sound so ""processed"".

To me these films are more for nostalgia value than anything else.  If I were a young boy again I might get impatient with the ""old"" and ""fake"" looking special effects, but I might stay interested for the stories themselves.",1421280000,2,819,4.725352112676056

All Movies are subtitleds english and Spanish. Only Family Band and Darby O'Gill have extras. Fred MacMurray ,Walter Brennan,Sean Connery and the restored Happiest Millionaire complet for the first time make this one a Winner . Millionaire Picture is so clear ,pristine vibrant color that you won't believe. Most People Know Buddy Ebsen only as Barnaby Jones , Jed Clampett and forget how he was a good dancer in the thirties at MGM. His Dance numbers in Family Band will surprise you. The only complaint  : Family Band master could be better. Disney Fans must buy this one and the others 4 Movie Collection . Nice Movies , good price , a real Bargain . Highly recommended.

5164341,5,B008H6GHJM,this one combines music - action and classic disney films along with a lot of actors that you will recognize from other roles.,1376611200,,126,4.521739130434782
5164342,5,B008H6GHJM,"I enjoyed the movies in this collection, especially Darby O'Gill and the Little People, and The Happiest Millionaire.  It was the first time I had viewed the other two films.  They were enjoyable.",1374624000,,196,4.909090909090909
5164343,5,B008H6GHJM,I had been looking for these for a while! These were movies I grew up on (Darby O'Gill & The Gnome Mobile). I haven't had a chance to watch the other two. I enjoy them as much now as I did when I was young.,1371686400,,206,3.6
5164344,5,B008H6GHJM,"overall, I was very pleased. Iwas a big fan of the good old movies of Disney and my kids grew up with a great appreciation for these types of wholesome shows!!!",1371254400,,160,4.193548387096774

5164346,5,B008H6GHJM,"I combined this DVD as a gift for a seven year old girl, along with a Gnome book and tiny gnome figurine.  She loved it and I knew she probably wouldn't be familiar with the Disney classics I loved as a child.",1366416000,,209,3.9761904761904763
5164357,5,B008H6GHJM,I love all of these movies.  They are not doubled up on a disk but each movie is on it's own pictured DVD.  The picture quality was better than the first time I saw them as a child.  These movies are disney classics.  It was a steal to get all 4 of them for such a low price.,1366416000,31,275,3.689655172413793
5164358,5,B008H6GHJM,"Darby O'Gill and the Little People is a St. Patrick's Day favorite.  Since I don't have TV service, I watch DVD's for entertainment.  A good story about a storyteller.  Sean Conner could have been a singer.  The Gnome-Mobile is a treat because of Walter Brennan.  Mr. Brennan reminds me of my Dad.  Musicals are always a favorite.  Walter Brennan portrays two lovely performances.  As far as I am concerned, I can't go wrong with Walter Brennan.  The Happiest Millionaire is different than I have seen before.  This version is choppy at the end which is a little disappointment.",1366329600,31,578,4.8061224489795915
5164359,5,B008H6GHJM,Enjoyed watching these movies as much now as I did as a kid! Now my kids got a kick out of watching them too,1366243200,,108,3.5416666666666665
5164360,5,B008H6GHJM,"Darby O'Gill features a very young, handsome Sean Connery and some excellent special effects; Happiest Millionaire tells a true story of instustrialist Biddle features Fred MacMurray and Greer Garson; the Gnome-Mobile has great special effects, and the One and Only Genuine, Original Family Band gives a refreshing glimpse at yesteryear with its patriotism and Americana ~ a very worthwhile collection for lovers of Disney feature films.",1365465600,5,437,5.636363636363637
5164361,3,B008H6GHJM,"I got this specifically for Darby O'gill which is a nostalgic movie I remember from my childhood. I enjoyed it. It's a well-done fairy tale with some amazing effects for the time. There are extras on the disk that show you how they did a lot of the little people effects pre-CGI and green screen. If not for that, this would probably be a one-star review.

Gnome-Mobile is pretty awful overall with very characters and a weak story. It ends with a really sexist scene at the end where a bunch of women are in competition over who will marry a guy and then he's supposed to be forced to marry the winner. This is supposed to be funny but I found it more disturbing, and I certainly don't think kids should see something like that.

I'm not even interested in watching the other two movies so I can't comment on them.",1365206400,2,815,4.355263157894737
5164362,5,B008H6GHJM,I think it was a greast idea for Disney to put out a 4 movie collection set for a cheap price. These titles are not easily found and it's nice to have them all together.,1364774400,,169,3.857142857142857
5164363,5,B008H6GHJM,This has a great mix of old disney fun.  Brought back some childhood memories when t was safe to believe in things and violence was not the message,1364256000,,147,4.25
