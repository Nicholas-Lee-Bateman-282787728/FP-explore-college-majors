8325440,3,B000MS42ZY,"If you are a devoted Pats fan, then you'll enjoy.  It's all about the 21-game team winning streak in 2003-2004.  But if you already have other forms of team highlights from the 2003 and 2004 seasons, from other DVDs, then you may not need this one.  What does make this particular DVD a little different is the special previews that are included before each game highight in the streak.  Each game includes the ""Bellistrator"" -- where Bill Bellichick breaks down video on the next opponent for a local Boston television station.

Think this one over ... and keep your receipt.",1202860800,4,576,4.72
