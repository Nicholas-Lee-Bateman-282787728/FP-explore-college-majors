7986248,5,B00008O32G,"I found this movie when I came here looking for other films starring Paul Sampson. He wrote Night of the Templar and ironically, he co-wrote this one as well several years prior to it. He and Patrick Muldoon have great chemistry together and make a great team. Supporting actors: Linden Ashby is delicious as the bad guy, Robert Miano (whom I adore) and Johnny Williams as the cuddly wise guy are all fantastic but Electra and Reinhold were, I'm sorry to say, just horrible. I don't know who cast Reinhold but it was a big mistake and the wig he wore was just plain sad. Electra with her overly dramatic ""sexy"" and poor acting was beyond annoying. Aside from those two casting faux pas, this is a good indie I would recommend for date night. No sex or nudity, moderate violence but no blood, no cursing so okay for kids.",1402531200,,820,4.473333333333334
7986249,3,B00008O32G,"This movie was definitely a low budget film, the dialogue was a bit bizarre to me.  Over all, though, I'd have to say that it did have some humor to it, it did have action, so it was pretty much worth watching.  With some script adjustments and a better budget, this would have been a better movie.",1357776000,,298,4.2105263157894735
7986250,5,B00008O32G,this movie was very nice to did not have alot of gore but alot of action . kept me watching and wondering what happen next,1336176000,,122,3.92
7986251,5,B00008O32G,"I think that this movie is a fun, fast moving, and lots of action. I think that Patrick and Judge were outstanding. I also do enjoy that I was one of the extras in the movie AND was even the first extra listed in the credits!!! Woohoo Hollywood here I come.. only kidding about my film stardom. Not kidding about the movie. By the way, most of the movie was filmed here in Spokane, Washington. It was nice to have a movie that we could enjoy Carmen's acting, without her removing her clothing!!",1177027200,4,494,4.32258064516129
7986252,2,B00008O32G,"I'm not really a big action fan but my boyfriend rented it so I agreed to sit through it for a bit. Was totally amazed. Thought the chemistry/relationship between the two brothers was sensational. They came across like real brothers. These guys must have known each other for a long time before working on this project together. The little things give it away (or maybe they can just act, imagine that!). Anyway, I thought there was some really great (believable) moments between them. The other characters were fun to watch too. But the brothers were cute and HOT! (It's o.k., my boyfriend rented it for Carmen Electra).",1070496000,4,621,4.813084112149533
7986253,5,B00008O32G,"I think the person that left the last reivew must have been related to someone that worked on making the DVD or something...
This movie is horribly good. Carmen Electra doesn't get naked, but some other woman does...however, Judge Reinhold is also (mostly) naked in the same scene (that's really freaking funny in itself). The story is kinda flopped together. Nothing really happens other than guns and a few breasts...but everyone seemed to really be having a good time making this movie. It's like they started filming and said, ""This is gonna be crappy, so we might as well have fun with it!"" I love bad movies, and this is right up there with Rock My World staring Peter O'Toole and Alicia Silverstone.",1068249600,7,706,4.747967479674797
7986254,5,B00008O32G,"This DVD is put together very well. The extras are informative and candid. There are lots of funny moments between Paul Sampson and Patrick Muldoon in the making of piece, (Brother's - A Study in Dynamics.) These two guys have great chemistry together. The video quailty of the DVD is teriffic and looks great. Other bonuses include, awesome motion menus, a good 5.1 mix, anamporhic widescreen, a behind the scenes piece on the 2nd Unit stunt work, outtakes, and the typical trailer. The only thing missing in my opinion is an audio commentary. After watching the ""Brother's"" piece you can only imagine how entertaining a Sampson/Muldoon commentary would have been. However, it's absence is forgivien. Most straight to video films like this  are usually lacking in DVD content department but this one delivers.",1054252800,3,810,5.090225563909774
