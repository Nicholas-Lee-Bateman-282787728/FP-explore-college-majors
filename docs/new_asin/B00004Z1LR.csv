7927923,4,B00004Z1LR,"Wow - I wish my Spanish were better than it is (which is to say, not very good) because this movie would probably be twice as funny as it already is. In any language it is a camp classic along the lines of ""The Big Cube"" and ""Desperate Lives"" (the infamous 1982 TV-movie in which Helen Hunt, high on PCP, throws herself out a 3rd story window), which is to say that it is a lurid, over-baked, wacked-out-of-its-gourd anti-marijuana screed that can stand up with the best of them.

Basically it concerns a teenaged girl (buxom Leticia Perdigon - and yes, folks, she does have a nude scene in which, high on MARIJUANA, she is molested by a lesbian hippy) who, through her ne'er-do-well boyfriend, falls in with the wrong crowd, i.e. HIPPIES. Said hippies are led by Ricardo Corts who, from what I could gather (again, the language limitation sort of hindered me here), is some kind of Manson-like guru (despite dressing like a total square) who holds groovy ""Satanic"" rituals at his swingin' pad (which must be seen to be dis-believed - imagine if Liberace raped Aleister Crowley and the resulting explosion in confined quarters, to give you some idea). Oh, and in his spare time said guru (the character's name is Toto - ?!) likes to rape random (and not-so-random) women. (That's how them hippies be, you know.)

Worth tracking down if you can find a copy and like obscure psychedelic age 'message' movies.",1265328000,,1406,4.6882591093117405
