1712944,5,B00006673L,"I must have watched this movie at least ten times. It sure isn't for the ""fun read,"" or ""chick lit"" crowd. The first time was in the Film Forum, in Atlanta, in 1974, while the American participation in the Vietnam War was still on-going. Like some other reviewers have reported, there was an absolute stunned silence when the movie was over, with the moviegoers even reluctant to leave their seats. My initial thoughts... and I retain them today... after those other viewings, is that Peter Davis truly captured it all, perfectly, with a meticulous balance. The Vietnamese and the Americans, the ""leaders,"" the quick-buck artists, the farmers, the foot soldiers, along with vignettes that demonstrated the social and political forces that led America to Vietnam, and resulted in it staying long after it was apparent that it was a mistake. Real, oh so real, that movies that followed,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deer-Hunter-DVD/dp/B006TTC5HC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deer Hunter DVD</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now-HD/dp/B008Y5FNL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now [HD</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heaven-and-Earth/dp/B006QR5G5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heaven and Earth</a>&nbsp;could never come close to. The difference:  In all the others, after the movie was over, the actors washed away the ""blood,"" and stopped off on the way home for a couple of beers.  In ""Hearts and Minds,"" the dead remain dead, and those without arms or legs remain that way. For those with personal experiences with the tragedy that was America's participation in Vietnam, like William Marshall, a key interviewee, said: It just doesn't all go away when you turn off the six o'clock news.

Over the past 40 years, on one or two of the ten occasions I watched it alone. Other times, there was a ""purpose.""  Some Canadian friends had a son who wanted to join their Special Forces, and sought me out in an effort to dissuade him. We watched the movie together.  It didn't dissuade him, and some 15 years on, he delights in the ""action life.""  An American Indian friend of my son wanted to join the Marines; the movie did seem to have an impact, and he never joined. The most telling viewing was with six of my coevals, all friends, all skiers, none of whom had been in the war.  Which one movie...?, they asked.  As an answer, one year, for the ""apres-ski,"" we watched it. NONE watched the whole movie... it wasn't that they were upset at the occasional scenes of bodily harm, rather, they just couldn't understand the point.  Like, for example, what did that high school football game in Niles, Ohio have to do with the war?  A simple ""EVERYTHING"" from me was inadequate, and certainly not persuasive.

There is an interview of a couple in Concord, Massachusetts who had obviously lost their son in the war. The father is pontificating about the necessity for such ""sacrifices"" in order to maintain our glorious government. The mother is in the background, trying to be supportive, but the camera catches her hands on the model airplane their son had built, and the middle-distance look in her eyes that fully expressed her doubts about what her husband was saying.

Wars bring out our racist characteristics. It is easier to kill someone if they are not quite human, not of the in-group. On my first viewing, I had no idea where Placitas, New Mexico was. And now I can do a day-hike there. An American Indian is filmed on a rock outcrop in Placitas, talking about the racial slurs he was subjected to in Marine boot camp, but then he had the insight to say how easily he started using racial slurs to describe the Vietnamese. Lt. Coker, a returning POW, is asked by a child in a school to describe Vietnam. He says that it was a lovely country, except for the people who were backward and ""messed everything up."" General Westmoreland, in civilian attire, a seersucker sport coast, is filmed standing under a weeping willow tree at his home in South Carolina. He says: the ""oriental"" doesn't place the same high value on life as we do...and Davis follows this scene with one of a Vietnamese woman trying to throw herself into the grave, to join her soldier son, who is being buried.

Davis is a master of juxtaposition. He ""pairs"" Lt. Coker with (former) Captain Randy Floyd. Both were pilots, both with about 100 combat missions. One ""saw,"" the other was oblivious. Both spoke of the pride they took in their flying skills. One would eventually understand what his skills did, the other was willful in not wanting to know, as Coker said: ""It was all just professionalism."" Davis juxtaposes the soundtrack from the patriotic World War I song ""The Yanks are comin'"" with all the implications that the French and British actually wanted our help, with American soldiers destroying a South Vietnamese village, destroying their rice, which were always considered ""caches for the VC.""

There is much footage of the senior political leadership, Vietnamese and American, and their views on why America got into the war, and stayed. Rumsfeld must have seen the film. He banned the taking of pictures of wounded American soldiers, or even their coffins during the 2003 Iraq War. It is a ""downside"" to the ""glorious enterprise."" Both the dead and the wounded are in this documentary. There are no ""Susie Wongs"" in this film, nor Graham Greene's ""Phoung."" The prostitution is a sordid, dirty business, and I wonder to this day how Davis obtained that scene, that truly captured it. Under ""other duties as assigned"" I had to deal with the principle consequence of such fleeting liaisons; the massive misuse of antibiotics in Vietnam reverberates today... as we await the first ""bug"" that will be resistant to any treatment by antibiotics.

A picture perfect ending. After several vignettes that underscore the utter indifference of many on the home front to the war, Davis finishes with a patriotic parade in NYC, with banners proclaiming ""Victory in Vietnam."" On the sideline are former American soldiers who had been in the war, protesting. They are called ""commies,"" told to ""go back to Cuba."" Finally, there is a former soldier wearing an Army jacket with the patch of the 173rd Airborne brigade. He yells at the camera:  What is this?  I was the one in the war... not these people.

Don't know if I could see it another 10 times; the emotional drain would be too much. But for the first 10 times, an unquestionable 6-stars, plus.",1440979200,,6577,5.119402985074627

1712976,5,B00006673L,"I wanted to comment on other negative reviews I read, many of which called the film contrived fiction or propaganda. So what? The word propaganda doesn't mean the truth isn't being told. This film shows us that war is truly hell. It shows us that innocent Vietnamese people died at the hands of American soldiers. It's a fact, accept it. It shows us that horrible suffering happened because america was involved. But Should we have allowed Hitler and the Nazis to murder every Jew on the planet? Was our involvement in that war wrong? Where genocide is a way of life, where ethnic cleansing is practiced with literally no restraint, where unspeakable death and horror is practiced, would american involvement in that be wrong? It's easy to blame our government for being part of the Vietnam war, but I ask, ""how many tens of thousands more would have been left dead in the killing fields of Cambodia, who's lives were snuffed out at the hands of their own people if the US had not been involved?"" This world is far too complicated for anyone to simply say it's wrong for america to go to war to help another country when the world is a horrible place sometimes and people are suffering unspeakable genocide. So I am on the fence when it comes to this subject. I believe that war is so tragic that there are no words to explain it, but to turn a blind eye and do nothing is even more tragic. And this film helped me to see both sides of the issue more clearly than ever before. A powerful anti-war film that got under my skin and it isn't likely to be forgotten for decades. War is wrong, but so would be the injustice and unspeakable death toll that would take place in other countries if americans and other allies did not intercede. I wish there were an easier answer to the problem. But John Lennon said it best, and if the world could take to heart the lyrics ""All we are saying is give peace a chance"" maybe war could someday truly come to an end.",1367884800,,1952,4.425

1712980,5,B00006673L,"I encourage you to read the review of T. Biddle, who says eloquently everything that needed to be said. He/she begins by saying, ""The criticism that this film is ""too one-sided"" or has ""an agenda"" demonstrates a lack of understanding of what a documentary is and does. Documentary filmmakers ALL have agendas; they have a point-of-view and must engage viewers emotionally or they fail in their task.""

I will just add one flake of nuance: Yes, filmmakers all have their agendas, and should not be ashamed to wear it on their sleeve, but at the same time they have a responsibility to not oversimplify or mislead, and this movie sometimes veered too closely to that gray line. Nevertheless, this movie succeeds in capturing the grotesque events of the Vietnam War and people's way of rationalizing them, and it succeeds in capturing the human condition more broadly. It isn't one of the best or most expertly crafted movies, but it's one of the most powerful. Watch this movie, and then watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fog-of-War/dp/B0001L3LUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fog of War</a>.",1349395200,,1142,5.488636363636363
1712981,1,B00006673L,"This film is less a documentary than it is raw political advocacy. Its basically a collection of well-known stock footage associated with the Vietnam War plus a limited collection of interviews. The impact of the film's construction is still powerful. But its undermined by an incoherent narrative and its use of ""gotcha"" interviews selectively cut to make political points. I suppose its most interesting today in terms of its film and documentary technique which lives on in the work of someone like Michael Moore.

Its not really anti-war advocacy as it is advocacy in the cause of North Vietnam. Rather than being anti-war, it is effectively pro-war. War is a good and wonderful thing as long as its being waged by North Vietnam against South Vietnam. Its only bad if other people are doing the fighting. As advocacy, it was ultimately pointless as it was too late to make any difference.

The most interesting aspect of the film is what happened after the war to many of its Vietnamese interview subjects who hated the government of South Vietnam and saw a victory by North Vietnam as ushering in a better era:

Thich Lieu Minh - Buddhist ""Priest"". Arrested December 1976 and later conditionally released. As of 1999, he was still under house arrest.

Father Chan Tin - Three years in prison until international pressure forced his release, under house arrest after.

Diem Chau - The newspaper he worked for was shut down by the government and he fled Vietnam for France in 1983.

Ngo Ba Thanh - Supported the postwar government of Vietnam as a legal expert. Defended Vietnam's human rights record internationally after the war. Got rich helping western companies exploit Vietnam in the 1990s.

In terms of politics, the film is slanted to blame certain figures and institutions while protecting others:

Clark Clifford, corrupt political goon, tries to shift blame for the war away from the democratic party as an institution and onto the military. His special task seemed to be to protect Robert MacNamara, Lyndon Johnson, Hubert Humphrey by saying the Joint Chiefs had no plan for winning the war in 1968-1969. Clifford comes across as what he was: a political opportunist who was for whatever policy was best for him.

J. W. Fullbright - Fullbright uses his camera time to remove any resposibility for himself for the war. One would not know from the film that Fullbright was a key supporter of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution and a reliable ""prop"" in the senate for most cold-war policy for many years. His general strategy for dealing with his responsibility is to claim that he was ""tricked"".

And we get the usual treatment of Saint Robert Kennedy. The rat who went to work for Joe McCarthy in the 1950s is erased from history. The bloodthirsty guy who pushed for the coup against Diem as the solution to all problems in Vietnam isn't there. The opportunist who never had a bad word to say about the war until he figured out it was Johnson's weakness isn't there.

Walt Rostow is set up as the archtype political villain. Mostly because he was willing to do an interview for the film.

William Westmorland is set up as the archtype ""heartless"" military man. He provides the emotional impact moment of the film when comments about Asians being able to take human losses easier are contrasted on screen with a grieving family in Vietnam. But Westmorland was far from the only person in that era with such strange views. Award-winning author Francis Fitzgerald wrote in her book on Vietnam that Asians could not be educated in the absence of political education. That Chinese pilots learned to fly from reading the quotations of Chairman Mao.

The Rostow and Westmorland moments, for all their emotional impact, they are strictly a matter of ""craft"". The filmmakers could have made anyone in the film look just as bad with the proper questions and film cutting. Again, good as political advocacy but not good as film.

In terms of the military, again its all selective editing. We get a long gratuitous scene with Charlie and Jerry in a brothel. We get lots of questions about bombing and people taking pride in what they did twisted along emotional lines.

Ellsberg presents his usual nonsense during the film. In his mind, Vietnam is not a civil war because the North Vietnamese are heroes leading the liberation of the country. Ellsberg is of course a paradox. He was a hands-on true believer in the Vietnam War who suddenly came to the opposite conclusion. He was not tricked or fooled. He has access to all the information and yet he supported the war for years. If all those presidents were ""lying"", Ellsberg personally knew that they were lying and somehow wasn't bothered a bit for years. But why he personally would support something he knew to be ""lies"" is not up for discussion.

We get sympathetic interviews with members of Vietnam Veterans against the War (never identified as such) and hostile interviews with returning POWs.

In the end, what you get here is political advocacy and well-seen stock footage of the Vietnam War. You get ambush interviews that promote a particular point of view. But the film was made too late to make any difference politically in the war. And rather than being anti-war, its pro North Vietnam. It believes in the cause of North Vietnam.

And in retrospect the cause of North Vietnam was not any better than the American cause. Vietnam abused the rights of its people after the war, it sent its people out to fight for empire in Laos and Cambodia. And when the money from the Soviet Union ran out, Vietnam began selling its people to international western corporations.
My personal views are that the Vietnam War could ultimately not accomplish anything good on either side. Everyone involved was wrong. And that moral stand was to be against the war rather than, as many participants of the film, on the side of North Vietnam.

Today, Vietnam looks more like South Vietnam than it does old Socialist North Vietnam. One has to ask what all the war ultimately accomplished for Vietnam.  Did all those Vietnamese ultimately die so that corrupt politicians running an authoritarian government could sell them to as slave labor to western companies?

And one has to ask what the pro-North Vietnam crowd was thinking. And in that sense, the film is a window into the delusions of those who were ultimately enemies of peace in Vietnam rather than enemies of war.",1307318400,,6411,4.825888787602552
1712982,3,B00006673L,"I would give this film four stars or even five if it didn't have such an everpresent, overbearing bias. The images are beautiful: ugly, horrifying and convincing all at the same time. However, the obvious slant of the piece undermines its truth. In this film, anyone in favor of serving his/her country is either a strident hawk or a dim-witted redneck. All of the deserters, draft dodgers and anti-war radicals chosen for intimate profiles are presented as thoughtful and articulate. The result is that the audience gets manipulated by a P.O.V that's about as fair and balanced as Fox news. The complex issues behind the U.S.A's escalation Vietnam war were never this black and white. The only thing that saves this film is the rich and accurate depiction of the Vietnamese point of view. Vietnamese from both north and south, the rich and the poor, warriors, farmers, civilians, woman, children and the elderly all have their say. The film is full of honest images of all the death and destruction in Vietnam that the US is responsible for. In short, this film's presentation of American dissent and discussion is simplistic and biased, but it is brutally honest about what the Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian people suffered.",1306800000,,1230,4.975728155339806
1712983,3,B00006673L,"Intersting and well-done indoctrination film showing only one side of this conflict (the communist side).  Much of it is factual, but it fails to tell how brutal the efforts of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese were to extract taxes and control of the southern provinces.  This was not a war of 'love for freedom and independence.'  It was a war of conquest to enable North Vietnam to obtain the agricultural wealth of South Vietnam.  The hearts and minds of the people of South Vietnam were not 'won' by the VC or the NVA.  They controlled much of South Vietnam before the US became involved.  They did this by brute force and violence. After the US withdrew they then invaded Cambodia and set-up their own puppet government despite a border war with China.  As a Vietnam Veteran I believe it was a tragic mistake for the US to send troops to Vietnam.  But that doesn't change the fact that Ho Chi Minh and Pol Pot murdered and enslaved millions of their own people to obtain power as communist dictators.

For decades after the fall of Siagon Vietnam was one of the poorest nations on earth - little more than a nation of poor peasants and imprisoned 'traitors.'

Modern Vietnam prospers only because their government recognized communism as an economic failure and allowed free enterprise to regenerate on its own.",1292544000,,1314,4.723684210526316
1712994,4,B00006673L,"This documentary spans a multitude of time and opinion. At points along you wonder where it's taking you. I feel that the director was honestly trying to give us an unbiased account of Vietnam but the overwhelming feeling is one of Anti-War or, more specifically, anti-Vietnam. Having said that, anti-war is by no means a sign of weakness or stupidity.

The unbiased attempt of the documentary comes from many opinions given by men who were there. Some of them so pro-war they make John Wayne look like Gandhi, some who started out Gung-Ho but due to what they did and saw now reflect very ruefully about their time in country.

In the middle of all the political posturing and hateful rhetoric of the time were the Vietnamese people. Focus of the documentary changes via editing from the words of ""Sgt Rock""'s way to win to the villages destroyed by bomb after bomb from American planes. Peasants show us where their homes used to be, where their mothers, sons, daughters died in the raids. All the time these people talk to us they retain that Asian grace and resolve. Some of the peasants interviewed look so void of hope and so full of despair one has to wonder was it worth it to them? North Vietnamese slaughter or American slaughter?

I feel the documentary did a good job of putting a very human face on war. Pilots flying around dropping bombs never see the victims and, carpet bombing villages is not precise but, the term ""Acceptable loss"" has a way of sweeping friendly casualties away neatly. It was unfortunate to me that America had chosen to support one of the most corrupt governments to justify it's anti-communist, cold war doctrine.

My sentiment going into the documentary was already swayed towards an anti-war stance. Not because I'm a peace loving hippie but more that wars are usually started by a few people at the top who don't like each other but they aren't always the ones getting slaughtered. Recently we see more and more of this as our nation's youth are sent thousands of miles away by people who have never suffered a day in their lives. Coffins draped in flags coming home to parents are no reward for the loss of a child due to politics.

It's a long documentary but if you sit quiet and listen you will come away feeling differently and it will stay with you for a while. America didn't understand Vietnam or its people. It had no idea what it was getting itself into. The documentary attempts to point all this out and, the end of the doc is very telling of this as we watch a parade being heckled by Vietnam Vets both crippled and healthy demanding jobs not parades whilst the jeers and cat calls of the marchers in the parade and the crowd rain down on them. We even turned against our own.",1289001600,,2731,4.5653061224489795

War is something that happens to other people in other countries. This film shows the reality of war, the futility of war, the immorality of war. It is striking how many mistakes are being repeated by the U.S. in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. This film serves as a sobering reminder of the cost of war. Having watched the death rain down, killing a million Vietnamese, it makes me wonder how people can believe that we can bomb other countries into liking and respecting us. I pray for forgiveness for what we have done - and are doing - in freedom's name.

Some of the images here are graphic and a great statement about how horrible war is.  Watching children with napalm still burning their body and seeing the famous execution photograph at point blank on tape is disturbing and I had to turn away.  But by far the most touching is watching the young girl lay on the grave of her father as they bury him followed closely by the angry farmer who talks of his children killed in bombing.

These images are interspersed with discussions by Ellsworth, Westmoreland and Clark Clifford.  Clifford is the most significant as he discusses how listening to the answers of officers convinced him there was no clear plan and it was not going near as well as they suggested.

Many people have attempted to connect Iraq's invasion with this story and I do believe there are parallels.  But the message of this documentary is the pure tragedy of war and the atrocities committed on both sides.  War is hell. Let's stay out of them at all costs.  Yes, this is one sided.

It holds true to the idea that a great piece of art can stand the test of time for generations to come.. it also points so elegantly that mankind is doomed to repeat his/her mistakes over and over again.

As some previous reviewers protest this documentary does hold an anti-war stance and defends its case vehementally using some stunning imagery and at times visually disturbing scenes. There is no doubt that the intended impact to the viewer is one of 'shock and awe'. This is especially poignant in the testimony delivered by the veterans interviewed who give an intimate and personal portrayal of what the reality of the conflict is on the ground.

Nothing, and I do mean nothing, has changed between then, and now. The same comparisons to the ""enemy"" to ""fighting for freedom"" are made in this film by the same people you hear say it today, some soldiers and some politicians. And then, as today, you can hear even more voices speaking out against it, and I wonder if those voices were as muted then by the media as they are today. However, they are not muted in this documentary.

At times graphic images of death are included with footage of sorties against cities and villages. At times we hear from the surivivors of these raids, and we also see them.  Particularly upsetting is a North Vietnamese man describing how his daughter was killed in a bombing raid that clearly was simply a village, this man only a grieving father. Crying out ""Take her shirt back to Nixon"" in Vietnamese was terrible to watch. If only U.S. Presidents could understand how innocents die in these aggressive military actions against other nations but U.S. governments seem impervious to this reality.

This is an excellent film in its own right but if you've been paying attention to whats happening in Iraq, you will watch this film and all the clips from every politician of this era (and before) and realize that, yes, what we are hearing today is the same recycled pattern of lying that proves history repeats itself.

1713003,5,B00006673L,"There are certain events in a country's history that leaves a scar so painful, it cannot be forgotten.  If there is such a scar with the United States, is has to be the Vietnam War.  Even to this day, its shadow still looms.  Many people are starting to say the occupation in Iraq is turning into another Vietnam.  Regardless if this comparison is justified, there is not doubt the harrowing memories of Vietnam are still embedded within the American psyche.  I just recently ran across 'Hearts and Minds' at a library.  I have not heard of this before, but after watching it, I could not help but think how controversial it must have been for its time period.  It was released just as the war was ending; America was split into half and many Americans began to develop a pessimistic view of their country.  This film does not show the U.S. in a good light, in fact many people would still consider it an anti-American film. It is not surprising that such a film emerged from the Vietnam War.  No other war in the country's history has created such bitter feelings, although Operation Iraqi Freedom is creeping closer.

What is so powerful and memorable about 'Hearts and Minds' is its use of juxtaposing contradictions.  One moment we see the immense suffering of both the North and South Vietnamese civilians.  We see how their lives have been ruined and devestated by war.  The next minute we see the cool indifference of the the American generals and soldiers.  They do not see the Vietnamese as human beings; they see them as savages, primitives, and playthings.  The Americans act like they are doing their job and do not realize the moral values at hand.  It is shocking just how much racism existed within the military during this war.  It makes me wonder if the same level of racism exists for the Iraq situation.  Sadly, the same mentality is seen again and again.  The idea of 'white man's burden' is prevalent throughout the film.  The U.S. suffers from the winner's complex.  The U.S. is the best and the rest of the world is sub-human.

This mentality, as the film shows, is implanted at a very early age.  The air force pilot who tells elementary school children that the Vietnamese are savages.  The psychotic football coach who slaps this players on their helmets, yelling at them to ""kill and win"".  It is frightning, but the Vietnam War showed that this is what this country has become.  When a country is as rich and powerful as the U.S., all moral values can be put aside.  How can this be stopped?  'Hearts and Minds' gives several clues.  It show American soldiers who have been wounded both physically and psychologically by the war.  It showed that even underneath the heartlessness, there exists still a heart.  The human soul almost naturally knows what is right and wrong.  It can reflect on what it has done and make a judgment.  This film, although a little one-sided, is a must see.  It is a must see because we are seeing another war that is becoming just like Vietnam.",1181260800,,3001,4.631878557874763

1713016,5,B00006673L,"To start off, the ""criticism"" that this film is ""too one-sided"" or has ""an agenda"", demonstrates a lack of understanding of what a documentary is and does.  Documentary filmmakers ALL have agendas; they have a point-of-view and must engage viewers emotionally or they fail in their task.

  I saw ""Hearts and Minds"" in college in about 1977.  The campus auditorium was packed with mostly sympathetic ""liberal"" college students, with the exception of about half a dozen uniformed military clearly present to ridicule the film and voice their opposition.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, a stunned silence gripped the room at the end of the film, as the parade clown shouting ""Come on!  Smile!  Get happy!"" pranced into the fade-out at the end of the credits.  The only sound was the audible sobbing coming from the military protesters.  We as an audience stayed to talk to them and to help them deal with the emotions they were experiencing.  It was one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had at a movie.  It forever burned the power of film into my mind.

  Of course, the filmmakers have an anti-war agenda.  Of course, the film is harshly critical of a government that, in its view, sent a generation off to an un-winnable war and basically forgot about them and the horrific experience they endured.  The film is compassionate and caring about the soldiers in the Vietnam war while being unmerciful in its presentation of the politicians and upper-echelon bureaucrats who perpetuated the war.  (""Are you really asking me this goddamn silly question, Mr. Davis?"" asks presidential advisor Walt Rostow, almost rolling his eyes, when asked to explain the origins of the Vietnam conflict.  This embarrassing, pompous moment might have been edited out of a less courageous film, but director Peter Davis is taking no prisoners.)

  The portraits here of heroes, victims, villains and cads, are incisive and powerful.  An earlier reviewer criticized the film for using the interviews with the parents of a deceased soldier.  The parents are proud of their son, proud of President Nixon (even though an on-screen disclaimer notes that these comments were made pre-Watergate) and seemingly proud of the way he died.  They have clearly chosen to be a part of the film voluntarily, so when the mother breaks down at a fond memory of her son, the audience does not feel pity, but rather great compassion for these good people who have been lied to, and whose son died for the lie.

Of course, a film could be made to show the noble intentions of our involvement in the war (or you could just rent the John Wayne movie ""The Green Berets""), but it is fairly universally granted that the Vietnam War was a tragic, shameful episode in American history.  This film, made and released at the moment of America's withdrawal from Vietnam at a time when support for the war was at its lowest, captures that feeling of depression and anger.  It is a film of its time and should not be criticized for that.

1713017,4,B00006673L,"This film is graphically powerful and shocking.  By now some of the footage should be familiar to people. In addition, it is a good wake up call to the current political situation and how we are only repeating what happenned in Vietnam. My appreciation for the film ends there. Of course, there were brutalities and atrocities in the Vietnam War and it was an unwinnable war that had no purpose. However, the soldiers were drafted and it is disappointing to see them portrayed as the enemy rather than victims of the military propoganda. I much prefer the film Wintersoldiers (which I believe is due for release on dvd) that extensively interviews former soldiers from Vietnam who are now against the war and speak out against it as activists.  In addition, for all people's criticisms of Michael Moore he presents in Farenheit 9-11, the military industrial complex as using poor people looking for a way out of poverty to become soldiers rather than Hearts and Minds that revels in the stereotype of the ""ugly American"" and doesn't bother to interview many average Americans (as opposed to a few shots of your usual hippies singing ""give peace a chance"") who were against the war and were afraid to express it or were not given a voice.  Even though yes, the film is against the Vietnam War so that to some conservatives that would make it one sided, what more concerns me is that it divided America into two sides rather than going into more subtle nuances about how the Vietnam War permeated American life and politics in complex ways that still have reprecussions to this day.",1139961600,,1580,4.759124087591241

1713019,5,B00006673L,"The images from Hearts and Minds are disturbingly heartbreaking and grotesque.  For example, a naked little girl is shown running down a road with skin pealing off her body as napalm continues to eat into her flesh.  American soldiers watch the girl running by them, until it seems as if the camera that is capturing the moment urges the soldiers to help the girl.  A Viet Cong suspect is shot point blank in the head on the street and his body falls to the ground with blood pulsating out of his temple.  A child cries in agony by the grave of someone close to him while the grave diggers take a break with a cool Coca Cola.  These unsettling scenes slowly descend into some unused space of the brain as they will return to consciousness in order to haunt the viewer of the horrors of the Vietnam War at a later time.

Peter Davis had accumulated over 200 hours of footage before beginning the long process of editing down the film into a feasible 112 minutes.  During these 112 minutes the audience gets to follow how the American mindset which is created from young age, and how it influenced the decisions of the war.  Davis brings the audience to a high school football game where young minds are formed into believing that what they do is right and that they have to win at all costs.  Similar mentality saturates the thinking behind the American decision makers as President Lyndon B. Johnson increased the American participation in the war, to which he stated, ""The ultimate victory will depend on the hearts and minds of the people who actually live out there.""  The President's statement also became the title for the film.

The Vietnamese people, whose living standards were and are much different from the typical American lifestyle, fought for independence and freedom while the United States fought against the fear of Communism.  This political and fundamental difference in perceiving the war was monumental as Communism, in essence, become the liberator for the Vietnamese people, and the Americans were perceived as the evil invaders.  Most Vietnamese were opposed to the American's, as most people in Vietnam are poor, and those who promoted the so-called Americanism of Vietnam were war profiteers and people in high positions.  The war continued into a dirty slaughter of civilians and children through dropping millions of bombs, spraying the herbicide Agent Orange, burning villages to the ground, and killing suspect Viet Cong as the American soldiers were in constant fear of being shot in the back.

Interesting comments were made by several characters such as General Westmoreland who said that ""the Oriental doesn't put the same high price on life as does the Westerner.""  This followed by a shot of a child weeping in misery by a grave, which brings across the message of the ignorance that some of the leading military staff possessed.  However, General Westmoreland continued to make derogatory comments about the Vietnamese people and continued to come across as a bigot and a racist.

Hearts and Minds was initially delayed in the United States for a year as a result of the distributors, Columbia, being afraid of legal repercussions.  However, the film went on to win the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature in 1975, and the Oscar's positive appraisal of Hearts and Minds led to a massive controversy.  Nonetheless, Hearts and Minds message was out as it was the biggest documentary of the time with a million dollar budget.

Ultimately, the audience will have traveled a rough cinematic journey, which could be summed up by Daniel Ellsworth's quote ""We weren't on the wrong side -- we were the wrong side.""  This notion is offered through several perspectives while viewing the horrors of war, as families were destroyed, children burnt to unidentifiable lumps of meat, and men wished they were home with their loved ones.  Hearts and Minds provides the audience several interesting notions to ponder, but the most vivid idea would be that war should be avoided at all costs as people are mutilated and die on all sides.",1102204800,,4055,4.896198830409356
1713020,3,B00006673L,"Hearts & Minds is edited to make America look more evil than the communist North Vietnamese. The juxtaposition of scenes and images, the out of context sound bites, the carefully selected individuals for testimonials are all put together to make Vietnam Vets look like cripples, crazies, shells of human beings. Peter Davis' shameless exploitation of the family who lost a son to the war to advance this films agenda is sickening.

There is no balance to this film. There is nothing there to show you the brutality the North Vietnamese Communist Army inflicted on the South Vietnamese people during the war.  There is no political look inside the North Vietnamese government. No North Vietnamese version of Clark Clifford and Daniel Ellsberg to interview. And then for Peter Davis to compare what happened in Vietnam to the American Revolution is ludicrous and scholarly dishonest.

When I saw this movie I had learned enough about film editing in the film classes I had taken to know the tricks of the trade to get to the emotional side of the audience.  This film works. I too remember a quiet audience. However, there was some hissing when Westmoreland said we had beaten the enemy at Tet 68.  Everyone in the theater thought Westmoreland was telling a lie because Walter Cronkite had said Tet was a defeat for us. We now know Westmoreland was right and Cronkite was wrong. The facts show we lost this war not on the battlefield but politically at home.

It is interesting to note that this DVD gets released in time take its place with other liberal diatribes against our country.

1713021,4,B00006673L,"...that it gives you the ""ultimate truth"" about the Vietnam War.
Hearts and Minds (1974) talks about the US's involvement in Vietnam and takes a critical stance toward it by portraying devastating effects of the Vietnam War. It uses many sources such as interviews from the US officials, war veterans, and victims of the war, and newsreels and actual war footage add more visually striking experience to the viewers. The documentary was excellent indeed and addressed clearly about why the war was unjust and inhumane, but there was no doubt in my mind that it had many biased and false views as well.  To me it was a propaganda film in a subtle sense that reminded me of Fahrenheit 9/11, which was released in theaters recently. People might disagree with me about the word ""propaganda"" that I put, but as indicated the Oxford dictionary, it means ""ideas or statements that may be false or exaggerated and that are used in order to gain support for a political leader, party, etc,"" and the documentary clearly does all that. It was used as a political tool by anti-war protestors to end the further US involvement in Vietnam, full of overgeneralizations.
  I realized that the documentary tried to make those involved in the war look like ignorant people. On many occasions, Peter Davis-the director of the film-deliberately made all the war veterans either fools or victims who were misguided by the government. There's a scene that one guy who supports the war tells the US is fighting for ""North Vietnam."" Why did Davis put this in his documentary? He's saying as if all ""pro-war,"" ""war-loving"" people are all fully unaware about the situations in Vietnam like that guy. Then were ""all"" anti-war protesters fully aware about the persecutions by North Vietnam that were far greater than what the US did? Also, the documentary shows one war veteran who is hostile toward the VCs and freely uses the word ""gook."" I agree that it certainly offends Asian people but this is another trap set up by Davis to prevent viewers from having ""rational"" thoughts. Although he's a racist, I also understand his frustration that the North Vietnamese cowardly used children, the elderly, and women as suicide bombers. Military law indicates that civilians who use arms are considered combatants and subject to be killed.
  Although it clearly is an excellent documentary, Hearts and Minds offers only a one-sided narrow view toward the causes and effects of the Vietnam War. Yes, war is indeed chaotic and no one certainly wants to experience it because many people die and suffer. But is it possible to have a war that has no civilian casualties and everyone lives happily? I haven't heard a single war like that before. It never addresses all the atrocities done by the communist government after the US irresponsibly withdrew its troops from Vietnam, abandoning the South Vietnamese. And what about millions of innocent people executed and sent to prison and the boat people who had to risk their lives and migrate to other countries to escape socio-political persecutions? People don't seem to realize that not only the North Vietnamese fought for their nation, but the South Vietnamese did too. But Davis is saying as if all Vietnamese supported the communist government backed by the Soviet Union (ironic) and united as one to fight off the US, the evil empire that tried to take over the galaxy. He should've instead been more honest by telling the viewers that we should not involve in other country's affair because we don't want waste our tax money and just ignore all the atrocities committed by the communist government because it has nothing to do with us. I want honest opinions like that instead of sugarcoated facts that are exaggerated to serve for certain interest groups.",1089244800,,3777,4.923076923076923
1713022,4,B00006673L,"The Vietnam War still rankles a significant portion of the American population. Who can forget the endless images of violent protests, the political wrangling, and the disturbing footage from the war broadcast on the nightly news during the 1960s and 1970s, recycled and endlessly replayed today in television documentaries? There are so many questions surrounding America's involvement with this little Asian country that they are unlikely to find resolution within our lifetime. Who was right about this war? Was it the young people who fled to Canada in order to avoid the draft, or was it the policymakers in Washington who attempted to fight a war from a conference table in the Pentagon? The answers usually depend on one's political leanings: liberals and closet leftists still gloat over their successful campaign against our military structure while conservatives lament the harm done to our armed forces by this conflict. I think we all must acknowledge that the echoes of Vietnam still arise today every time our country conducts war operations overseas. ""Hearts and Minds,"" a documentary about the war made by Peter Davis in 1974, before the fall of South Vietnam, takes a decidedly liberal perspective in discussing the effects of this war on both the Vietnamese and American people.
The title of this documentary refers to one of several policies Washington developed to help win the war. Power elites thought that by infusing the populace of South Vietnam with American ideals, by winning over their ""hearts"" and their ""minds"" to the American ideology, support for the pro-Communist Vietcong insurgents would evaporate. This policy failed, along with every other American strategy promising victory, because the issue between North and South Vietnam was one of nationalism rather than communism versus capitalism. Quickly forgetting every lesson about history they should have learned at Yale and Harvard, American movers and shakers failed to see our presence in this country through the eyes of the native population. To the Vietnamese, the United States was the latest foreign intruder in a long line of occupiers. The Vietnamese wanted an independent, unified country and could care less what ideology helped achieve that aim. Our government never saw the war solely as a nationalist issue, instead focusing myopically on the containment of communism. America could have won the Vietnam War, though, if the people in charge of this campaign recognized that fighting a war with self-imposed rules is a sure recipe for disaster.
Davis's documentary doesn't pay exclusive attention to the big picture aspects of the war, but mainly focuses on individual responses to the conflict from both Americans and Vietnamese. ""Hearts and Minds"" hammers home again and again that American aggressiveness and racism fueled the war effort. The director seems to think that football, with its barely controlled ""barbarity"" and propagandistic messages about winning, reveals the ideals underpinning the American war effort. The documentary sometimes takes a ""60 Minutes"" type interview style with figures like policy advisor Walt Rostow, a man who supported whole-heartedly our attempts to defeat the communist insurgents in South Vietnam. Rostow, an extremely intelligent individual who never found a job in academia because of his positions on Vietnam and Communism, nearly blows a gasket while discussing the war with Davis. Why? Because Davis refuses to maintain a balanced perspective. Why not just tape Rostow's position and then follow it up with a contradictory opinion from some other pundit? Well, Davis does present both sides of the coin in ""Hearts and Minds,"" but his ideological bias regarding the war is never in doubt.
Racism plays a huge role in Davis's documentary. We see General William Westmoreland, who served as head of the war effort in Vietnam for several years, claiming that Asians do not place the same value on life that we do. Another scene shows two American soldiers partying with two Vietnamese girls and making comments that would surely anger some people today. No one can watch this documentary and feel good about these charged statements, but I think Davis misses a key point concerning why Westmoreland said what he did, a point that extends beyond the Westmoreland interview to hang over the whole documentary like a black cloud. We all know the Vietnamese routinely used children as suicide bombers to target American soldiers, which I think explains what Westmoreland was trying to say. Davis conveniently fails to mention this fact, along with disturbing truths about NLF atrocities committed against civilians. Moreover, Davis, an obvious liberal, fails to mention that our involvement in Vietnam was a war planned and escalated by three liberal presidents: Truman, Kennedy, and Johnson.
""Hearts and Minds"" does neatly illuminate one truth that all should take note of: war is an irrational, chaotic affair that we can rarely explain using rational, ""civilized"" arguments. War is emotional turmoil, the widespread use of both controlled and uncontrolled violence involving the debasement and dehumanization of all involved. Branding America's war against the Vietnamese communists as ""racist"" does nothing to resolve the real issues of that conflict. In fact, resolving the issues surrounding the war simply will not occur during our lifetimes, if ever. Despite some of my comments about Davis's biases in this review, I do think the documentary works on several levels. Seeing the devastation the war brought to poor Vietnamese civilians is absolutely heartrending, as is the sight of a boy weeping over his father's grave. Witnessing the psychological and physical devastation of our own soldiers is equally saddening. But the war was about much, much more than Davis presented here. In that respect, ""Hearts and Minds"" is an occasionally admirable if flawed documentary.",1069459200,,5918,5.337259100642398

1713044,4,B00006673L,"The fact that ""Hearts and Minds"" won an Oscar for best documentary speaks volumes about what the Hollywood establishment thought of Nixon's war in Vietnam and Cambodia by the early 1970s.  It was an important film, a benchmark granddaddy to Michael Moore's documentaries ""Roger and Me"" and ""Bowling for Coumbine.""
The passage of thirty years exposes the film as an effective, but skewed propaganda film.  No one is around to speak the Administration's position, unless you count the bullet-headed Westmoreland, whose banal comment that ""the Vietnamese just don't value human life the way we do"" is immediately skewered by scenes of a grieving Vietnamese mother trying to crawl into the grave of her dead son. The North Vietnamese are portrayed sympathetically, while American GIs come off as stoned-out waste cases.
I suppose, after years and years of being lied to by our government, we needed ""Hearts and Minds"" as an antidote, and the directors and producers of the movie were right to push the pendulum far to the left.  It definitely is a valuable historical record of the war, and more importantly, the intellectual revulsion and rage against the war.  The movie makes several sociological points, including the scene of the insane Midwestern high school football coach egging on and beating his rabid players.  (This concept was later picked up in the opening high-school wresting scenes in the anti-war movie ""Born on the Fourth of July"" starring Tom Cruise.) .

1713045,4,B00006673L,"Peter Davis's 1974 documentary about the causes and effects of America's Vietnam War has been digitized and reissued after 25 years, and it is an invaluable touchstone for each of us.

Using war footage, newsreels, clips from Hollywood films, and interviews with officials, soldiers and Vietnamese, ex-CBS journalist Peter Davis and his team present a sobering view of American arrogance, misguided policy and dishonest government. (Sound like anything you've heard lately?)
Some of the most memorable scenes for me are: General Westmoreland's comment that the ""Orientals"" don't value life the same way we do, right after we see a Vietnamese boy mourning at his father's funeral; a Vietnamese coffin maker hammering nails into a child's coffin; Daniel Ellsberg, on trial at the time for releasing the Pentagon Papers, listing the lies told to the American people by five presidents -- Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon; Charlie and Jerry, bored Air Force men cruising Saigon for entertainment; fitting prosthetic limbs onto veterans; Clark Clifford, Secretary of Defense from 1968-69, discussing the interviews that suddenly made him realize that the war could not be won; a father talking about how his son died for a worthwhile cause as his wife looks on.  Shocking, also, is the revelation that the US offered France TWO ATOMIC BOMBS to use in their war with Indochina (later Vietnam)!! This film is heartbreaking and poignant, capturing the tragedy of lives caught up in madness.
Davis used interviews from people who supported or fought in the war; some later came to oppose the action while others continued to support it.  A wonderful extra feature would have been to talk to those same interviewees today; instead, the only dvd extra is the director's commentary, but it is terrific. You hear what Davis's thoughts were in making the documentary and how his own perceptions changed over the years, the material he did get and the material he wasn't allowed to use, experiences he had during filming and the problems he had getting it released.
If you have this film on vhs or remember seeing it, you will love this crisp new print and enjoy Davis's insightful comments. If you have never seen it, you simply must.

1713052,5,B00006673L,"I first saw this movie in Iowa City, Iowa, in 1975, on or just after the day that Saigon fell. A couple years ago I found and bought a VHS copy of this movie, and thus saw it again for the first time in 25 years. Now the DVD. After having only viewed my full-frame washed-out-color VHS copy, the bright-color, sharp-focus 1.85:1 DVD edition is like watching it for the first time.
One could argue against this film that the events in Vietnam and SE Asia after our pullout fully justified our fears of what would or could happen if S. Vietnam fell to the Communists.
One could argue in favor of this film that Robert McNamara's recent revelations prove they knew that the war couldn't be won and wouldn't be won, yet continued to deceive the American people anyway.
One could argue and continue to argue both sides re: Vietnam -- and people likely will do so, and this movie will surely help them.
The Director's commentary is enlightening, e.g., where he explains how Westmoreland's comments re: Asians viewing life cheaply were NOT taken out of context -- indeed, Westmoreland stated the same thing 3 times during the interview -- and why Davis (the director) placed this shot in the film where he did. The 40-page or so booklet is really great, too, and explains much.
I just loaned it to a friend who likes historical documentaries, but knows zip re: Vietnam (he's in his mid-20's). I fully expect HEARTS AND MINDS to blow him away!

1713063,5,B00006673L,"This is by far the most affecting film about war I have ever seen.  I have read extensively about Vietnam, and although I am too young to remember the state of the country while it was immersed in the conflict, I have always been drawn to its stories and lessons.  The narrative voice of this documentary is absorbing, yet not dogmatic.  I don't want to over-intellectualize this film and run the risk of taking away any of its power to affect me.  Simply put, I feel every American should view it.  The lessons it exposes are completely relevant to what this country is supposed to be about, and what it actually is.  I'm a ninth-grade American History teacher, and I lament the fact that I would be risking my job by showing this-  especially given the events of 9-11-01 (and since) which have unfortunately had the effect of disenfranchising honest inquiry into the methods and motivations of our political leaders. Please do whatever you can to get your hands on it and your mind around it.",1022889600,,994,4.613636363636363
1713064,4,B00006673L,"I, too, use this film when teaching a history class and have found it to be very useful.  The other reviews have dome a fine job of discussing the content of the film, so I would like to restrict my comments to observations that have not been previously mentioned.
1. HEARTS AND MINDS is probably the best film around that portrays the tragic misunderstanding between the US's Cold War anti-Communism & the process of decolonization in Asia & Africa.  Daniel Ellsberg in the film describes this problem perfectly.  The US government, military, & population simply missed the unique nature of the Vietnamese situation and instead saw the conflict as a WWII aggression scenario.
2. On the other hand, this film does not give sufficient emphasis on the SINCERETY with which Americans took anti-Communism.  To portray the US effort in Vietnam as mere imperialism is to completely miss the dedication and commitment this country had in its opposition to Communism.
3. HEARTS AND MINDS also fails to present the truly brutal nature of the North Vietnamese government.  When South Vietnam was overrun in 1975, former soldiers, officers, & officials of S. V. were either summarily executed or placed in ""reeducation camps"" for many years.  In my ESL teaching days, I had a student who had spent 10 years in such a camp with little food & no family contact.  In his perspective, our defense of S. V. was wholly justified & necessary.
4. HEARTS AND MINDS successfully brings to the viewer the cost of war.  Every war has a price, and every generation has to ask if it's willing to pay that price.  Sometimes it's worth it.
5. In response to the ""put America on trial"" reviewer, I defy him to name one other country that would allow such a self-damning film to made, distributed, shown, and awarded.  That alone places the US in a unique category.
This is an extremely impressive & thought-provoking film.  I recommend it highly, and its rerelease is definitely a call for celebration.

This movie is but an instance of American atrocities since WWII. Just think, when watching this film that there is a myriad of covert and overt operations the U.S.A. has been involoved in.  I look forward to the day whence the world and in particular the third world comes together and finds a voice to demand justice.

1713066,3,B00006673L,"I had my 20 students in a History of Documentary Film class view this film recently and it provoked an intense discussion.  Viewed from the perspective of it being 25 years later, this film seems to obscure a very valid viewpoint of the war (that I shared at the time and still do today) through a very biased selection of footage and editing choices that made me often cringe.  So I thought it was a great lesson for the students in how a director and editor can cut material together to advance a predetermined viewpoint.  What I found most disturbing was the way the film mostly dehumanized our soldiers who fought this war, soldiers who were mostly from lower socio-economic families who were not able to avoid service the way that many of us from more affluent familes were.  And it detracts from some of the amazing interview footage that is included, particularly Gen. Westmoreland's statement about Asian cultures not valuing life the way western cultures do.  The brothel footage, the high school football scenes and small town parades all seem included to indict American culture as much as if not moreso than our political leaders over that 25 year period.  And there is no pretense of balance.  And again the irony is that the film did not need to do this in the way that it did.  That it was honored as ""Best Documentary"" seems historically more because of its politcal content rather than because it's a ""great film.""  However, it was a great film for students to see because it is such a great example of selective editing with biased intent.  And it made for a great discussion about both Vietnam and ethics in media.",981158400,,1633,4.658536585365853
1713067,5,B00006673L,"I'm not sure how manytimes I've viewed this documentary.  25?  30?  Every time I teach my course on the Viet Nam war, showing Hearts & Minds is the 1st thing I do.  Somewhere in the course, I ask students whether it gives a balanced picture of the war or whether it is anit-war.  The debate always is lively and classes tend to be somewhat evenly divided. Without question, this is one of the very best documentaries ever made.  If someone wants to learn about the war in Viet Nam and can devote only two hours, seeing this docmentary is not the best, it is the only thing to do.
Regarding the reviewer who argues for editing it to shorten, reorganize and omit the nudity, I could not disagree more.  Students sit spell bound for the full two hours, then ask to view it again.  The redundancy, such as it is, is minimal as well as valuable.  The scenes with the prostitutes are important because they show how we dehumanized the people; women in particular were seen by many as little more than pieces of meat.  This wasn't just the American soldiers, but the institutional mindset of the nation which flowed from President Johnson through Mr. McNamara and General Westmoreland down to the buck private grunt. Systematic dehumanization of the Vietnamese people was a very real part of what happened there; and therefore, important for the documentary to show.  We took a people who were very hard working, moral people and turned them into a nation of beggars and prostitutes.  Anyone who knows anything about Vietnamese culture knows how strong their social mores were against both.  The Vietnamese people were a highly ethical people, with a rich history and culture which we totally ignored and damn near totally destroyed.  I say these things not just as an academician, but as a combat veteran of the war who served as an advisor to a rifle company of the Vietnamese Airborne. I lived with these people, fought beside them and against them, for my entire tour; and I came to respect them, admire them, and love them.

At  the time it exposed me to the absolute evils and sickening realities of a  modern war for really the first time. It's lack of narrative adds a  peculiar realism that I have never seen repeated in a documentary or  fiction work.
