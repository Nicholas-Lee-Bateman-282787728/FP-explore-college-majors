It is very easy to prescribe mechanics as is demonstrated by the bazillion how to golf books and tapes.  There are precious few that  successfully convey, teach, impart, the elements required for scoring.  I have over 100 golf books and several tapes. There are only about 1 dozen that actually succeed in doing that job. This tape is one of them, and about as good as they get.

The downside is that the prescription is so simple yet so blasted hard to adopt due to the human failings.  Like for example - swing easy don't hit hard. Simple but the human wants to hit the ball extra hard into wind for example.  The trick then is to conquer the human frailties via a method of teaching. This tape probably does as good of job of doing that as can be expected.  There is a child of 10 years old that swings very impressively in terms of scoring. This demonstrates that the prescription the tape presents is valid.  I tell  myself if he can do it then certainly I can.  I'm not sure if that lesson is received because of my willingness or the tone of the tapes message. I guess another viewer might find the child to be a depressant instead, like - ""I've tried but failed, I missed my chance""  Regardless, buy the tape.
