2596152,5,B000G0O5JG,"I have continue to check  this site time and time again to see when and where the 5th Season of the Jeffersons were ever coming out. I was starting to worry. I have all four seasons and have enjoyed them so much. People don't understand that these shows are priceless. Thank Goodness  they have the 5th season available and once I purchase this, I will be on the lookout for the 6th season. KEEP THEM COMING AMAZON!  I love, love , love the Jeffersons!",1149897600,14,452,4.357142857142857
2596153,5,B000G0O5JG,"WOW... MY FRIENDS. THE JEFFERSONS: THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON. I WAS GETTING WORRIED ABOUT THE FIFTH SEASON RELEASE FOR QUITE AWHILE. BUT NEVER THE LESS, THE JEFFERSONS: THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON WILL BE RELEASED ON August 15th, 2006. AND AS ALWAYS I WILL BE ORDERING IMMEDIATELY.",1149811200,8,279,5.086956521739131
2596154,5,B000G0O5JG,"I incorrectly mentioned in my review for the season 4 set that Jay Hammer joined the Jeffersons cast as Allan Willis. His tenure begins this season. Allan,son of Tom(the late Franklin Cover) and Helen Willis(the late Roxie Roker),has more of his father's skin than his mother's. In the case of his sister Jenny Jefferson(Berlinda Tolbert),it's the opposite. Allan first appeared on a guest star basis in a season 1 episode,played by another actor. George Jefferson(Sherman Hemsley) referred to Allan as a ""zebra who lost his stripes""! Well,Allan finds employment in Manhattan and moves in with his parents. It is mentioned this season that George's mother Olivia ""Mama"" Jefferson has passed away,as did her portrayer,86-year-old Zara Cully. Louise or ""Weezy""(the late Isabel Sanford) is now working with Helen at The Help Center(obviously they are both caring individuals). George still has his Jefferson Cleaners drycleaning business and Tom is still with Pelham Publishers. It is sometime this season that Damon Evans relinquished his role of Lionel Jefferson,son of George and Weezy and husband of Jenny. Lionel's original portrayer,Mike Evans would return to the series at the beginning of the 1979-80 season and depart again at the end of the following season. This season,The Jeffersons' ""niece"" or ""nephew"" Good Times had been cancelled and ME,who co-created GT with Eric Monte,would be able to return the following season. Hey,my funny bones will be tickled again when I hear ""honky"" and ""zebra"" coming out of George's mouth. George said to English neighbor Harry Bentley(Paul Benedict) in one episode,""The last thing I need is a honky on my back!"". This season marks Sanford's ninth playing Louise. Louise debuted on an All In The Family season 1 episode. AITF Season 1 marked ME's debut as Lionel as well(the series premiere actually). Hemsley debuted as George in an AITF Season 4 episode,toasting his brother Henry. Sadly,Cleveland native Cover passed away in February at age 77 of pneumonia in Engelwood,New Jersey. He was recuparating from a heart ailment at a nursing home there. So I dedicate this item to his memory. I also dedicate this item to the memories of Cully(1892-1978),Roker(1929-1995) and Sanford(1917-2004). Oh by the way,I didn't want to end this review without mentioning Marla Gibbs,who was the Jeffersons' live-in housekeeper. Gibbs is Florence Johnston who is still aggravated by George's arrogant demeanor. Like the opening montages for seasons 3 and 4,this season's montages features clips from previous season episodes. But there are some different ones like Florence kneeling on the Jeffersons' living room floor dressed like Aunt Jemima,George and Louise dressed as a cowboy and Cleopatra,respectively and George moving circularly on his toes. I have not seen these episodes since TV Land last aired them in 2002. So,let's keep ""movin' on up!"" As for you,Ja 'Net Dubois,keep us rocking with your vocals heard in the theme song!",1149638400,14,2966,5.312765957446809
2596155,5,B000G0O5JG,"This is the season I've been waiting for!!! The fifth season is when The Jeffersons really hit it's stride!!! Wow! There are so many fantastic episodes like when Florence gets to meet Billy Dee Williams. Needless to say she was truly his number one fan, considering he later guest-starred on an episode of her sitcom 227. Hint, Hint the second season release of that series is Long Overdue!!!

I'd have to say one of my all-time favorite episodes is when George and Helen get Disco Fever!!! I just loved watching George dance, but poor Tom Willis got a raw deal having absolutely no rhythm on the dance floor! I could go on and on about many more favorite episodes from this unforgettable fifth season, but I'll just wait with great anticipation until August 15th!!!!! Now only if Sony will get cracking with a complete first season release of Maude my life would be complete!!!!!",1149638400,26,880,4.714285714285714

2596209,3,B000G0O5JG,The episodes in season 5 weren't as funny to me as the first 4. The Jeffersons seemed to lose it's creative steam. The worst episodes here are when George catches disco fever and when Jay Hammer was introduced as Tom and Helen's son.,1462233600,,233,4.441860465116279

I only wish I could get all the seasons!  This show is funny, highly entertaining thanks to the actors in it! The Lovely Isabel Sanford as Louise, The wonderful Sherman Hemsley as George, The funny and delightful Marla Gibbs as Florence, As the wonderful Mother of George the fabulous Zara Cully as Mother Jefferson. Although she wasn't the best Mother in Law to Louise, but one might wish for such a lady as close family member despite how she felt about Louise. And we can't for get the rest of the regular cast: Like Roxie Roker playing Helen Willis, Her Husband on the show Franklin Cover as Tom Willis and Paul Benedict as Harry Bentley. What a wonderful cast and a wonderful show. I highly recommend this sitcom.",1454976000,,863,4.532051282051282

2596235,5,B000G0O5JG,"I've patiently waited for the remaining seasons of The Jeffersons.  I've heard more than once that they will all be released so I've waited to buy Season 5 in the hopes of getting them all instead.  Nothing.  :(  Words cannot describe my disappointment.  I went ahead and got Season 5 because I truly love this show.  If or when they do release the rest all at once, I guess I'll be hocking the ones I have and get the entire series.  This is truly so much better than any of the garbage on TV today.  My 15 yr old son has completely gotten into these old TV shows too.  He loves George and Weezy and the Willis's. :)",1409270400,,617,4.161016949152542

2596239,4,B000G0O5JG,"I have always enjoyed The Jeffersons, but I bought this season strictly for the Billy Dee Williams episode! I love Florence in this episode, especially since I felt the same way about Billy Dee that she did! I do own the first 4 seasons also, but don't know how far I'll go in purchasing seasons. Eventually - like most things- it had run it's course (and that was before it was cancelled). But this season was a must-own!",1398816000,,422,4.423076923076923
2596240,5,B000G0O5JG,This was great writing and a very very funny episode.  George and Florence had a comedic bond and work flow.,1373155200,,108,4.4
2596241,5,B000G0O5JG,"Season Five, although not quite as stellar as the previous season of ""The Jeffersons"" still contains a lot of memorable episodes, such as ""Louise's Painting"", which has George in a tizzy over his wife's interest in sketch art. There's a new addition to the cast this season, as Jay Hammer portrays Tom & Helen Willis's biological son Allan (the ""white sheep of the family"", as George refers to him). Allan was fist seen in the final Season One episode ""Jenny's Low"" (with Allan played by Andrew Rubin). We get more than a mere glimpse of Allan Willis the first time we see him this season in the two-part episode titled ""Homecoming"", with Allan inheriting a warehouse from his grandfather's will. George does all he can to scheme his way into wrangling the property for his dry cleaning establishment with hilarious results. There's ""Half A Brother"", where Allan takes an interest in a lovely young lady, who happens to be the daughter of a prominent bank president whom George is trying to gain an account for his business. Willie Tyler & Lester guest-star in the episode ""George's New Stockbroker"", where George is hesitant to hire Tyler's character due to his medical past. Billy Dee Williams also guest-stars in the episode ""Me & Billy Dee"", where Florence is excited to meet her idol, until she learns George has hired a double that looks like Billy Dee, giving the double the third-degree until she learns it's actually him! George needs help from an old Navy buddy in the form of a loan for the Help Center in the episode ""How Soon They Forget"", while George has a bad dream where he finds himself in the year 1996 & finds that business is better than ever, with 20 stores to his credit, but something's missing...Louise. An episode with hilarious results, for sure! George's cousin needs a new kidney in the episode ""What Are Friends For?"", while George learns a secret a family friend had with George's mother in ""George Finds A Father"". As far as Season Five is concerned, although Zara Cully & her Mother Jefferson character passed away in the previous season, this season didn't suffer in terms of production value, as the writing & acting are still top-notch. This season would be Jay Hammer's only season, as it would be explained the following season Allan went to New Mexico to rejoin his commune. Because of the fact Season Five is still in that classic, comical vein, is an absolute reason to make ""The Jeffersons - The Complete Fifth Season"" an all-important title to add to your video collection today!

2596243,5,B000G0O5JG,"I know it's been 11 years since the last review of the Jeffersons . I am just adding some facts about the sitcom that was missing from other reviews.
