6481999,5,B00LFMZZSO,"ARE THESE SOME TIMES LESS THAN A B MOVIE, YES. SO WHAT? THAT WAS THE IDEA.  Cassandra WAS HOT WHEN SHE WAS ON TV AND SHE'S HOT TODAY. SHE'S FINE WITH THE MAKE UP AND JUST AS FINE AS HERSELF.
I HOPE SHE MAKES A Coffin Collection PART 2.  EV DON'T EVER CHANGE!!!!!!!!!",1414540800,2,266,4.0
6482000,5,B00LFMZZSO,"I would get this just to see Elvira again.  Hot lady - even today ! !  fun intro's to the movies, don't really remember
the movies but that was a couple years ago :-0",1414281600,6,166,3.8529411764705883
6482001,5,B00LFMZZSO,"she was neither the first nor that last to host one of those ""turkey theater"" anthologies, but there's a reason she's proven the most enduring.
no doubt some wisenheimer is out there saying ""actually two reasons."" well, yes, she does have wonderful tits (in their 60s, yet) - out of which she herself gets plenty of mileage (""now let's take a little D-tour"") - but do you really think Elvira would of lasted this long if that was all there was to her?
in fact, i for one would go so far as to say that Cassandra Peterson is the single most underrated comic actress in the history of the thespianic arts. she displays comedic instincts and timing that make Lucille Ball look like a corpse. (of course, she WAS a founding member of the Groundlings.) but alas, meaningful acting work is so hard to come by that just about any performer ""lucks out"" to find even one role with which to leave a lasting mark on an audience. Peterson found her own somewhere between Morticia Addams and Moon Unit Zappa. (with just a pinch of Raquel Welch for texture, of course.)
like any valid would-be flibbertigibbet character, Elvira is savvier than she might seem. she takes deliciously biting shots at the likes of Sarah Palin, Martha Stewart, and The View. (here it's The Brew, with the panel being rounded out by Edie McLurg and Mindy ""Frau Farbissina"" Sterling.) the movie The Brain That Wouldn't Die concerns a textbook mad scientist keeping alive the head that was all that remained of his fianc after a car accident. when he finds himself enamored of a blonde dancer, Elvira wonders if she's Jayne Mansfield. ""i hope not, though, because you'll just find yourself in the same predicament."" this of course refers to the way Mansfield died when her car slid beneath a low semi-trailer. you'll have to admit, it's not just anyone who can get a good laugh out of decapitation.
the series itself is of course basically Movie Hell. this is where those flicks that couldn't cut it go to die, literally as Elvira (and her counterpart hosts) delights in picking nit after nit after nit. in a way you could call it the flipside of The Twilight Zone, with Elvira and the like as less benevolent versions of Rod Serling.
the films are indeed, as the saying goes, askin' for it. take Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter, in which he actually meets the GRANDdaughter. or Manos: The Hands Of Fate, which translates to ""Hands: The Hands Of Fate"". or Santa Claus Conquers The Martians, for cryin' out loud! even if it wasn't bludgeoningly obvious that the thing was filmed entirely in an airplane hanger, the very concept had nowhere to go but the B-movie purgatory presided over by The Mistress Of The Dark.
not only that: you get not one but two films about prehistoric tribes of women!! a wonderful fantasy i grant you, but it turns out - not once but twice - to be hopelessly immune to cinematic craftsmanship. (a third film, Hercules & The Captive Women, promises as much but meanders to the point of rendering it an anticlimax.)
and she's not afraid to take on the big stars. admittedly the actors are mostly semi-talents at what would turn out to be their peak, such as pretty much the entire cast of Night Of The Living Dead. but there's also a surprisingly impressive selection of household names. quite a few otherwise renown headliners - some synonymous with horror (Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing) some not necessarily (Jack Nicholson, Dean Stockwell, Joanna Lumley, Joseph Cotton), even some less famous but equally recognizable character players (Richard Kiel, Dick Miller, King Moody, Nat Pendleton) - must face the humbling fact that the world hasn't quite forgotten those less distinguished points where their devotion to their art had to take a backseat to bills they had to pay. you might almost wonder if this series format wasn't designed to keep showbiz egos in check.
if there's any surprise here it would be the lack of Ed Wood material. Plan 9 From Outer Space would seem the ideal target for Elvira's not-so-tender mercies, so why doesn't she get the chance? my guess would be that Plan 9 is not in the public-domain and therefore out of reach, but it's only a guess.
what's truly scary about this sort of series - although maybe ""sobering"" is a better word - is that you see just how fine the line really is. every film buff knows that making movies is a crapshoot, but it takes such a smorgasbord of not-quites to drive home just how much a given producer and/or director is up against. there are any number of films along the same lines that came to be considered pretty good, sometimes even classics. the only sin per se here is failing to achieve that vital but ethereal ""magic"" of a Casablanca or a Star Wars.
(remember, nobody WANTS their movie to suck, so however lost the cause, an effort is always being made.)
indeed, it's dismayingly easy to make a less than stellar film. even our heroine has contributed two renown cinematic stinkers, Elvira: Mistress Of The Dark and Elvira's Haunted Hills. some might say it was only fair that she open that can of whup-ass on herself as well.
well, Mistress, is turnabout fair play or isn't it?",1413676800,50,5175,4.694169416941694
6482002,1,B00LFMZZSO,"The 1 star is for the pricing. $90 for movies that are all public domain. I love Elvria and her intros but this is pretty steep price considering. And no, these films have not been cleaned up and transferred to HD look, they have simply been transferred over onto a Blu Ray disk.",1411344000,19,279,4.283018867924528
6482003,5,B00LFMZZSO,"It's Elvira! worth every cent. Oh, the movie presentations with the humourous host commentaries by same is pretty good too!
In truth, I prefer how Elvira handles her show commentaries over MST3K, less intrusive so you actually have opportunity to see and hear the movie being ridiculed ( I do like MST3K, just like Elvira more).
The coffin tin is embossed, beautifully coloured and holds the film dvds quite snugly. The films are stacked though and being dvds not Blus, can scratch, so I placed a small sheet of tissue paper between each and have ample room in tin to do so.
The films were ""as good as available"" quality wise so no, ""Manos the Hands of Fate"" is not in collector's edition quality.
If that matters to you, well, maybe you need to re-evaluate your life, just sayin....
Enjoy!",1458691200,4,790,4.65

All of the DVDs are stacked on top of each other, so if you need to get to one disc 5 you need to take out discs 1-4 to get to it. It's not really that big a deal, and I love the box.

6482047,5,B00LFMZZSO,"Elvira has a great set on her hands--set of movies that is.  Sure many of these (Haven't been able to watch them all yet!) are turkeys but Elvira spices things up and adds entertainment where there isn't any.

I first saw Elvira's show when I was stationed at Vandenberg AFB in California in the1983.  Geez, seems like such a long time ago.  She was over the top then and still over the top.  I always enjoyed the show she put on.

The coffin of dead movies is a cool idea.  However, be aware that the DVDs inside are not even slip protected. Just stacked on top of each other like a bunch of dead bodies.  You can expect them to decompose, er, get scratch in short order, if you actually watch these movies.  What made this even better is that I didn't even pay close to the retail price.

All movies are full screen, some color & some B&W, and only some have subtitles. The case is only cute and not functional other then for shipping. The case is taller then normal disc case so it does not fit on a media shelf. It also holds all 13 discs in one hole in the foam with no separation between discs. If you want to watch the last disc, they all have to come out. A simple solution is to buy a small disc case (when you order this collection) that holds at last 13 discs and fits your shelf. Case Logic makes excellent multi disc cases. The foam does provides good protection for the original shipping so they do not arrive scratched.",1414627200,59,1409,4.551181102362205

The discs are not individually protected in any way; they're stacked one upon another inside a foam cutout inside the metal coffin box which I find less than ideal. You'll be scratching these up quickly if you don't re-package the entire set right away. I cannot review the quality of the films themselves as yet bc I have to wait for a replacement. I will revisit my review score after viewing. I give this only 1 Star now so people will read this review b4 ordering so they know there might be a problem.

8665634,5,B00LFMZZSO,"I noticed that not one single review talked about the film quality and sound quality for the films in this set. As far as i know, these are all B movies that are in the public domain. I have most, if not all these movies as part of those box sets put out by Mill creek Entertainment, among others. Mill Creek has two ends to its company. Some of their movies are in partnership with Columbia Pictures, and that end of their business puts out top notch versions of those movies. Those are usually not in the public domain. Then there is the other end where they put out the so bad they are good movies. They do their best to offer decent looking prints but this Elvira sets prints are exceptionally good. Especially noticeable is the movie EEGAH. On the Mill Creek version the color is all washed out and everything looks kinda bluish. This Elvira version looks amazing! All the colors are nice and much better than any other prints i have seen. I have never seen this movie look or sound so good! No its not HD quality but its very very watchable. The Night Of The Living Dead version here is SUPER GOOD! They really tried hard to give us some truly remarkable quality sights and sounds. I'm glad i got this set. So for all of you wondering if this is worth the double dip, In my opinion its way worth it!! I have only checked out 2 of the movies so far, but chances are good the the rest will follow the same pattern. They tried hard to give us a good high quality product. The tin is also nice, and just a tad bit smaller than i was expecting. Its about 8 inches tall and around 5 inches wide. Looks nice on my shelf and fits right into my display of other box sets. This set won't be available forever. It looks like one of those items that will be high priced and rare 5 years from now. Grab em while the price is reasonable.",1486771200,8,1829,4.198863636363637
