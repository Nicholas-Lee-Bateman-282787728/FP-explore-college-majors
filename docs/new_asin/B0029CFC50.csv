8357717,5,B0029CFC50,"Wonderful set, includes all six seasons plus Christmas episodes. One Foot in the Grave has to be the funniest sitcom ever written and produced, with very talented actors. This is a region 2 dvd set, so if you're in the U.S. you will need an all-region player to watch it (Amazon sells them, and in my opinion, if you like British TV, the players are well worth buying).",1426636800,,369,4.4411764705882355
