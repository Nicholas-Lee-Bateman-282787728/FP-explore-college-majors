2475768,5,B000DZF20U,"I truly enjoyed this powerful speaker. Everything Dr. Bynum spoke about hit home for me over and over again. I watched this with my 15-year old daughter. I would recommend this DVD to every young woman coming of age and any woman who is saved, bitter, single, married, widowed or divorced. I believe we will all experience and face these issues one day in our lifetime. I cried, I released and I let go. I AM HEALED!!! I AM REBORN!!!

Thank you,

2475770,5,B000DZF20U,"THIS MESSAGE MADE ME THINK ABOUT THE THINGS I DO AND HAVE DONE IN A NEW LIGHT.  PRIOR RELATIONSHIPS DO CAUSE BAGGAGE, NOW I HAVE THE TOOLS TO LEAVE THAT BAGGAGE AT THE DOOR.",1191110400,3,173,4.088235294117647
2475771,4,B000DZF20U,"A lesson in going through trial and tribulation. Only downside is that she really never gets in the Scriptures. She basically gives an oral presentation dealing with her struggle with promiscuity and being a Christian. If you are single and saved you may want to add this to your collection. But I strongly recommend that it be shown only among a mature audience because of some of the graphic depictions Ms. Bynum uses.

On the flip, its unfortunate that her soon-to-be-ex-hubby lost it and beat her down ala Ike and Tina(8-22-07). But when you allow yourself to believe your own spiritual greatness bad things can happen, even to the best of us. God can turn it around, but we must first be willing to admit to the error of our ways.",1187913600,7,735,4.6106870229007635
2475772,5,B000DZF20U,"This is the most daring message I ever heard and seen in my life. A humbling experience before which I had no choice but give thanks to God for the messenger.  In this DVD, Prophetess Juanita delivers a message that is almost the state of mind of Esther when Esther said: ""If I perish, I perish."" Prophetess Juanita just threw herself out before God and said ""Here I am Lord; either deliver me and my people TODAY or kill me"". The result is astonishing. As I listened and looked in the audience, I noticed something that was happening right here in my living room: A Massive infusion of deliverance. There is something about telling the truth; the truth,  nothing but the truth. I strongly recommend this message to anyone who wonders ""Lord, how can I stop this thing that is killing me?""

2475773,3,B000DZF20U,"Bynum is a bit repetitive but on the whole a good preaching tape.

I first purchased this set (in VHS form) during year 2000 (, if I recall correctly) and I've been sharing them with both, men and women ever since. Raw? Yes, indeed! Exactly what some of us need to get over that hurdle of temptation. Juanita ""wakes and quakes her viewers back to moral consciousness"" and then, teaches us how to stay there! Every DVD in the No More Sheets series is power-packed (Pray, Prey, Pray!; Wrong Focus; I've Got to Get Myself Together, and; No More Sheets).

My testimony is that "" The Sheets"" was one of my hardest struggles in this Christian walk & couldn't understand why it was hard for me yo turn away from it!

2475822,5,B000DZF20U,"When I first saw this DVD, I was extremely bitter about being single and wondering when God was going to ever send my husband.  I liked that in this DVD, she talks about the frustration that many single Christian women experience at some point in their adult life with happily married people in the church always saying to ""Wait and it will all work out"".  While I'm not saying that we as single Christians (men and women alike) should groan and complain with God, it's not unreasonable to feel some sort of disappointment when year after year passes and you can't see yourself moving any closer to that dream.  She talks about how hard it is to try and be content when you have a desire to be able to live ""as husband and wife"" (if y'all know what I mean).  She expresses my exact thoughts a lot of time when married people who have the very thing you desire almost patronize you in your frustrations in your single life.  I really felt like the has been where I've been and can understand.  Now, I personally don't think I can judge her from what has happened to her in the last couple of years, but as for THIS DVD, I love it and highly recommend it.",1268265600,,1153,4.314814814814815
