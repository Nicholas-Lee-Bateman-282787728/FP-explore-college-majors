7718499,5,B01DKTCANM,"So far I own all ten entries in the Forbidden Hollywood series. For anyone who is addicted to racy pre-code movies, this is a must have. I could probably have taken the films featured in #10 directly off of TCM, but my kids have a tendency to delete.
This set contains the following films:

THE MOUTHPIECE (1932)
A fast talking lawyer movie starring the fabulous Warren William who seemed to have an edge of slick characters.

THE MATCH KING (1932)
Warren William plays a crooked con man. Think Bernie Madoff, but really slick. A social gem with an appearance by Lili Damita, the first Mrs. Errol Flynn.

GUILTY HANDS (1931)
A slick detective film starring Lionel Barrymore. This is a swell whodunnit with the histrionics of Kay Francis. Oh, Barrymore is so clever in this one.

SECRETS OF THE FRENCH POLICE (1932)
This police morph into the Wizard of Oz. Frank Morgan is the head cop.

EVER IN MY HEART (1933)
Barbara Stanwyck agonizes that her hubby may be a spy.

This is definitely one of the best of the series. I love Warren William who must have existed purely for pre-code films and Barrymore is probably the most versatile of the 3 'B'.

Great set! We just watched the Match King. My husband finally gets Warren William and is now a fan.",1467590400,10,1246,4.560538116591928
7718500,5,B01DKTCANM,"Just found out, this is the last Forbidden Hollywood set.",1463702400,3,57,4.8
7718501,5,B01DKTCANM,"Finally, my two favorite Warren William films on disc!!!  Terrific movies and nice transfer.",1463356800,4,92,5.571428571428571
7718502,5,B01DKTCANM,This has to be one of our favorite collections.  Every movie in this set is a winner.  All of them are the types of movies you'll watch over and over.  Enjoy!,1463270400,6,158,4.032258064516129
7718503,5,B01DKTCANM,"I purchased this series directly from Warner Bros. The discs were pressed, not burned.  (Nothing wrong with burned discs as long as it is M-disk because M-disk has a 1000 year lifetime.  Regular burn discs are good for 5 or 7 years.)

I like the series very much. My favorite pre-code movie is, ""Employees Entrance"", on Vol 7.  If you are looking for the movie, ""Convention City"" it is not here.

 I highly recommend this collection. However, if you buy from Amazon the discs may be burned.",1463097600,15,490,4.574712643678161
7718504,5,B01DKTCANM,"The ""Forbidden Hollywood"" series from Warner Brothers started in 2006 and is still going strong (it also includes films from MGM and RKO).
Forty-Four films to date.
Volume Ten is one of the strongest entries in the Forbidden Hollywood series.
It features one of my favorite actors  the devilish Warren William (literally  the man looked like Satan) in two pre-code films from 1932:

THE MOUTHPIECE (1932)
A thinly disguised biography of mob lawyer William J. Fallon, who died in 1927,
and whose nickname was ""The Great Mouthpiece"".
1932 saw the release of three films based on Fallons life.
In addition to Warren William in The Mouthpiece, you could also see
John Barrymore in State's Attorney, and
William Powell in Lawyer Man (in Volume 4).
-- for a comparison of the three films, see the first comment (dated April 19, 2016) following this review.

THE MATCH KING (1932)
Warren William plays a character based on real-life Swedish financier and con-man Ivar Kreuger,
who committed suicide just months before the films release.
Co-starring Lili Damita (Mrs. Errol Flynn) in a role based on Kreuger's lady friend Greta Garbo.

GUILTY HANDS (1931)
A fast-paced detective film starring Lionel Barrymore and Kay Francis.
An enjoyable 70 minutes, though we know whodunnit early on in the film.

SECRETS OF THE FRENCH POLICE (1932)
This police procedural turns into a really kinky horror film.
Frank Morgan (the Wizard in The Wizard of Oz) plays the Paris police inspector.

EVER IN MY HEART (1933)
Barbara Stanwyck is worried that her husband may be a German Spy in this mystery set during World War I.
The first 53 minutes are slow going, but the plot gets REALLY interesting in the last 15 minutes.

-- Volumes 1-3 of ""Forbidden Hollywood"" were deluxe productions on the Turner Classics Movies ""TCM Archive"" label.
Pressed on standard DVDs with English SDH subtitles.
Volumes Two and Three included documentaries about Pre-Code Hollywood, plus commentary tracks for some of the films.
Beginning with Volume Four, the series switched to the bare-bones ""Warner Archive Collection"" DVD-R format
(no subtitles or extra features)
People bad-mouth DVD-Rs, but I haven't had any playback problems (yet).

-- If you are new to the ""Forbidden Hollywood"" series, Volume Two is actually the best place to start.
It includes the excellent documentary:
""Though Shalt Not: Sex, Sin and Censorship in Pre-Code Hollywood"" produced by Turner Classic Movies.

In addition to Warners Forbidden Hollywood series, Universal and Columbia produced their own pre-code boxes:
-- In 2009, Universal released the six film ""Pre-Code Hollywood"" collection (the films were originally produced by Paramount)
-- In 2012, the five film ""Columbia Pictures Pre-Code Collection"" was released by TCM Vault Collection.
Altogether - Fifty-Five films, produced between 1930 and 1934
in twelve collections from Warner, Universal, and Columbia.

For a complete list of the 55 films on DVD, see the second comment (dated April 19, 2016) following this review.
-- Barbara Stanwyck tops the list with seven films.
-- Joan Blondell is in second place with six.
-- Loretta Young, George Brent and Warren William are tied for third with five films each.

Confusingly, some of these films open with a notice claiming ""This picture approved by the Production Code Administration of the Motion Picture Producers & Distributors of America"".
Created in 1930, the Production Code Authority was run by the studios - the original Production Code was very loosely enforced.
This situation changed after 1933 when the Catholic Legion of Decency launched a campaign against ""immoral"" films.
Roman Catholics were forbidden to see these films.
[ It's OK for Catholics to see them now - In March, 2016 Sister Rose Pacatte hosted a series of films condemned by the Legion of Decency on Turner Classic Movies.]

-- For a list of the 52 films condemned by the Legion of Decency during it's first two years of operation, 1933-1934, see the third comment (dated April 19, 2016) after this review.

--------------------
NOTABLE PRE-CODE FILMS NOT IN THE TWELVE BOXES

This list is totally subjective
All films but one are available on DVD - see the end of the list for links on Amazon.
- Suggestions are welcome.
Original posters from these films appear below.

HEAT LIGHTNING (1934) Aline MacMahon, Ann Dvorak
""I just killed a rat!""
- see the first comment (dated April 19, 2016) following this review.

THE LETTER (1929) Jeanne Eagels, Reginald Denny (re-made in 1940)
Only sound film from this legendary actress who died shortly after it was released.

MADAM SATAN (1930) Kay Johnson, Reginald Denny, directed by Cecil B. DeMille
Debauchery in a doomed dirigible.

THE MALTESE FALCON (1931) Ricardo Cortez, Bebe Daniels (re-made in 1936 and 1941)
Ricardo Cortez is a wonderfully sleazy Sam Spade.
Not a candidate for the Hispanic Hollywood Hall of Fame.
Born Jacob Krantz, he changed his name to ""Ricardo Cortez"" when he broke into Hollywood,
hoping to take advantage of the silent film hysteria for Latin Lovers like Rudolf Valentino.
It worked for a while, but his career took a downturn when sound came in.
He is excellent in the 1931 MALTESE FALCON,
but by the late 'Thirties, Ricardo Cortez was a supporting player in Charlie Chan movies.
I always liked his films.

RAIN (1932) Joan Crawford, Walter Huston
Prostitute Joan Crawford tries to reform with the help of missionary Walter Huston, but things get messy.
[originally filmed as a silent in 1928 with Gloria Swanson and Lionel Barrymore.]

SAFE IN HELL (1931) Dorothy Mackaill, Donald Cook, directed by William Wellman
Prostitute Mackaill is wrongly accused of murder.
Her sailor boyfriend smuggles her to the island of Tortuga where she'll be ""safe"".
Lecherous Gustav von Seyffertitz has other ideas.

THE SIGN OF THE CROSS (1932) Frederick March, Claudette Colbert, directed by Cecil B. Demille
-- Scantily clad Christian maidens menaced by gorillas in the Roman Colosseum
-- Claudette Colbert in a milk bath
-- Charles Laughton as a delightfully lascivious Emperor Nero.

THE STORY OF TEMPLE DRAKE (1933) Miriam Hopkins, Jack LaRue
The first film to be condemned by the Legion of Decency.
The daughter of a judge is kidnapped by bootleggers and turned into a prostitute.
She gets even.
Based on a novel by William Faulkner.
Not on DVD.

SUSAN LENOX, HER FALL AND RISE (1931) Greta Garbo, Clark Gable
Only film pairing of Garbo and Gable.
Gable erroneously believes that Garbo is a prostitute.
Garbo becomes a prostitute just to spite him.

TARZAN AND HIS MATE (1934) Johnny Weismuller, Maureen O'Sullivan
Tarzan and Jane show some serious skin
(also, when were they married?)
Threatened with a Condemned rating by the Legion of Decency, certain scenes were re-filmed with a clothed Jane.
She was restored to her nude state in 1986 when a print of the original film was found in the MGM vault (she's nude on the DVD).

The documentary ""Though Shalt Not: Sex, Sin and Censorship in Pre-Code Hollywood"" suggests additional titles.
This includes horror films and gangster films (easy targets),
plus Busby Berkley musicals.
Kind of a stretch - The partial nudity in 42nd Street or Gold Diggers of 1933 is pretty innocent.
Nothing compared to what you will see in MURDER AT THE VANITIES (in the Universal box)

* If you want the 1931 Pre-Code MALTESE FALCON you need the three DVD Special Edition issued in 2006 (see link above)
But be careful when ordering - there are three different DVD versions of the MALTESE FALCON listed on the same page.
The single-disc versions only have the 1941 re-make with Humphrey Bogart.
Make sure you specify the ""Oct 03, 2006 Special Edition"" (3 DVD set)
- Not the ""Oct 05, 2010"" DVD version (single disc)
- Not the ""Feb 15, 2000 special edition"" (single disc)
- Not the Blu-Ray version

The Match King was laughable in that yes, I like Warren Williams, but what was so risqu about it?
