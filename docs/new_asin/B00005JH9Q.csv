1430835,1,B00005JH9Q,"Hey, I love watching bad TV.  I loved The Brady Bunch Variety Hour, I'll waste the occasional afternoon watching everything from Kroft Supershow to Diff'rent Strokes to Saved By The Bell.  But I found this to be uninteresting and unwatchable.
Jeff Altman's impression-based comedy is stale and uninspired, which I suppose is the point, but that only makes it sadder because he as a comic, unlike Donny and Marie, or the Brady Bunch actors, should've known better.
If you love bad TV and 70's Variety Shows, pick up The Brady Bunch Variety Hour or the Kroft Supershow box set, and don't waste your money on this.  It's not so-bad-its-funny, it's just bad.",1005091200,,654,4.821428571428571
1430836,4,B00005JH9Q,"I know, I know, I know...This series is regularly regarded as one of the worst (if not THE worst) television series in US history (yada, yada, yada).  If you are looking at this page, then you know that's *not* true!

Sure, this is one of the most bizarre TV shows ever made, but it's highly watchable!  The comedy skits aren't very funny, but you will find yourself laughing at the disco-era outfits and the Ed Wood-like atmosphere that permeates the entire production.  You'll be wondering *why* NBC and the Krofft brothers made this show, but glad that they did!

The bonus materials are pretty sparse.  While the recent interview with Jeff Altman is insightful, it would have been a treat to catch up with Mie and Kei themselves.  (Maybe they're finally learned some English over the years since the show was made!)

The picture quality is good for a 20+ year old videotaped show.  The DVD transfers aren't that bad, and it's almost like being tuned in to NBC for those magical few weeks back in 1980!  (Now, all we need are DVDs of ""Supertrain"" and ""The Big Show"" to truly re-live the ""glory"" days of NBC!  And while we're at it, how about DVDs of David Letterman's morning show, which premiered a few months after Pink Lady!)",1003363200,17,1231,4.60091743119266
1430837,5,B00005JH9Q,"A wonderful, 3 DVD boxed set containing the complete 6 Pink Lady variety shows from 1980. Easily the most exciting DVD release of the year. The image quality and sound quality are average for an early 80s television show. However, be warned: Oddly, the discs' chapter stops are spaced mainly to give the viewer easy access to the terrible comedy skits. To find the brilliant musical numbers, you'll have to scan past the skits to locate the musical numbers. The included index card doesn't even list the song titles. But rest assured- the discs do contain the complete shows, with all musical numbers intact. One of the most exciting moments of the entire series was guest star Greg Evigan's solo number, ""People I Know"", in which he not only sings but plays saxaphone. He later duets with Mie and Kei in the same episode. The bonus interview with Jeff Altman is entertaining. However, as was the case in 1980, he's easier on the eyes than on the ears. It's wonderful to see him shirtless in the hot-tub sequences at the end of several shows. If only he'd have done the skits that way...Other bonus features fail to show Pink Lady to their best advantage. There are seveal websites devoted to Pink Lady which offer more interesting information. However, this set remains an incredible value. No fan will be dissapointed. Place your order at once!

1430868,3,B00005JH9Q,"As a child of the late 70s / early 80s, I had heard quite a bit about this show (mostly after its run), but never actually saw it - most likely, I was watching ""Dukes of Hazzard"" (hey, I was only 10).  But I love seeing and reading about old television - particularly flops, so I had to buy this DVD.

Here is my feeling: This is a should-see for anyone interested in classic television misses or surreal ""what were they thinking"" programming experiences.  This is definitely on the ""Brady Bunch Variety Hour"" scale of bad decision-making.

I had no idea that the Krofft Brothers, the guys behind those cheaply made, ""what were they smoking"" kid shows of the 70s, were behind it, but it makes perfect sense: the cheapness of the whole affair, the way it looks like they filmed this in a Ramada Inn using a camcorder, the horrible writing involved, the guest star talent that probably wasn't A-list in 1980 (Larry Hagman excluded, I suppose).  I mean, Byron Allen?  Really?  Horribly unfunny as a standup comic, even if he was just 18.  The Krofft's must be super-wealthy now, considering how little money they put into their productions.

I will say this: the singers (Mie and Kei) were very good.  Even though they were forced into some Mr. Ed-like phonetic singing of cheesy medleys, backed by dancers that were not the most photogenic ladies around, one could tell they had talent, as well as a natural stage presence (particularly Mei - the one that was usually on the left).  For all the supposed efforts to provide separate identities to each, they were dismissed as ""the girls"" an awful lot.  Notice how some genius thought putting their names on their clothes (a la Laverne and Shirley) would aid in recognition.  I hope, at least, the bits were translated into Japanese for the ladies at some point, so they knew, at least, what the gist was for these ""jokes"".  They had to know that these things were not funny; unfortunately, the goal of American singing success was not to be (surprising, since the show was just on the cutting edge of hip and trendy).

To be fair, a few of the comedy bits were OK.  Jeff Altman had his moments - I could see his ""Culture Spot"" sketches working today (though that's not saying anything), and Jim Varney was pretty good with what he did.  There were a couple other women on the show who were quite funny as well.  I wouldn't worry about the special features; other than a few minutes of Altman piling on about the trouble with the show, nothing worthwhile.

Bottom line: if you can rent this instead of purchasing, that's a smarter move.  Curiosity got me to buy it, but I hardly think I will watch these episodes a second time.  If you just have to get it, go used.",1166400000,,2711,4.5484536082474225
1430869,5,B00005JH9Q,"This show is actually very fun to watch, depsite the bad reviews it originally recevied.

1430870,3,B00005JH9Q,"Fred Silverman's unfortunate reign as programming head for NBC (""Supertrain,"" ""Manimal""... ahh, those were the days) is memorialized in this collection of six episodes of the worst, unfunniest ""comedy-variety"" series ever. How it ever made it to air is completely beyond me. Pink Lady are not even that talented as singers (even in their native Japan, their vogue as disco stars was brief), and they seem incapable of lip-syncing to their phonetically-learned song lyrics. They are unable to deliver their ""jokes"" properly for the same reason... they clearly have no idea what the lines mean. Then, there's Jeff Altman. Tasteless, unfunny jokes and grade-school-level mugging are his trademarks...  again, one can only ask, how did this third-rate talent get this gig? And was there no one at NBC who realized this was a train wreck before it was scheduled? At any rate, such entertainment value as this set has lies in its camp value. Your jaw will be constantly dropping at the tacky sets, politically incorrect jokes and bad disco music.

1430871,5,B00005JH9Q,"is Pink Lady as bad as everyone says?  YES!!!  is it as good as everyone doesn't want to admit?  YES!!!  This series only ran 6 episodes in 1980,  but it was such a wacky idea that it actually worked.

Mie and Kei were both good performers, and while you could tell they didn't seem too comfortable performing in English, you could still see how fun they could be.

Jeff Altman wasn't as unfunny as people say, I thought they guy had a few funny sketches, the problem was, awful writing.

I was only a few months old when this series ran in 1980, but I caught episodes on Trio a few months ago, and the side of me that appreciates camp had to buy this.  And what a purchase it was.  I find the show amusing and cringeworthy at the same time.  There were some good guest-stars but you just know they don't consider it part of their resume.  Did you know a pre-Ernest Jim Varney was a ""featured player"" here?

Also, fans of the early video movement (pre-MTV) will enjoy this because of the vintage Blondie (Shayla and Eat To The Beat), Alice Cooper (Clones) and Cheap Trick (Dream Police) music videos on here.  I know Blondie has released a Greatest Hits DVD, but I don't think either Shayla or Eat To The Beat is on there.

If you appreciate camp as well as disco music, you will love this mostly-forgotten artifact from 1980.",1092700800,3,1326,4.355102040816327
1430872,4,B00005JH9Q,"The ""comedy"" skits are really, really bad for the most part. They're made all the more difficult because of Kei's mangling of English beyond recognition (Mie's English is better). But if you're a fan of Red Buttons or Sid Caesar, this one's for you.

 The best part about this series is the performances by Pink Lady. Whether their garbled version of ""Knock On Wood,"" or a good rendition of ""If My Friends Could See Me Now"" surrounded by pink-wigged puppet-like dancers, the girls do exude a real charm. Pink Lady was first and foremost a disco group in Japan. And most of their songs in this 1980 series are disco hits from the two years previous: ""Le Freak,"" ""Shame,"" ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy,"" ""How Deep Is Your Love,"" ""MacArthur Park,"" and ""Last Dance"" are among those performed.

 Liking disco music, and appreciating the bizarre and campy in television, I really have enjoyed this series! With better comedy writers, and if Pink Lady were kept out of the skits and if Jeff Altman were funny, this show could have worked in the longer term.",1090281600,3,1042,4.646739130434782
1430873,5,B00005JH9Q,"Have all of the skits on Saturday Night Live been funny? NO. Have all of the musical numbers on SNL been great? NO. Okay so here was a show with skits that weren't always funny and musical numbers that weren't always great. But when Pink Lady and Jeff was good it was VERY good.
It seems as if Jeff Altman was paid money to say bad things about the show on the DVD intros like it was important to distance himself from this ""disaster"" as he put it. Whatever Jeff. Unless you did those intros for free, you were paid to say negative things as if everything was tongue in cheek like you were smart enough to think at the time that you were doing a bad show. Again, I refer to SNL. I can't tell you how many of the sketches in the early years when the show was supposed to be ""cutting edge"" that were not funny in the least. At least Pink Lady and Jeff was fun to watch at all times. Jerry Lewis was funny. Red Buttons was funny. Jim Varney and Anna Mathias were funny. Sid Caesar was funny. Roy Orbison performing Live....what a treat. Yeah, the show missed the mark a few times but did anyone see that stupid episode of Seinfeld that wasn't funny. Which one? Yeah...my point exactly. Too many unfunny episodes of Seinfeld to name but THAT was named the best comedy ever. The Pink Lady and Jeff DVD will have you in stitches... irrespective of what Jeff says in his paid intros. You would think he would be smart enough to embrace the show. If you buy the DVD's go past Jeff's intros. He contributes nothing of value.
Mie and Kei were VERY GOOD at singing corny American songs like Macarthur Park and Yesterday. But they are even better at singing their own songs. Especially UFO. The studio audience goes nuts at the end of that one. This DVD will be a collector's item soon. Buy it now, keep it in good condition and make those fools who don't have it now pay out the nose for it later.  I have 3 copies.",1084752000,15,1904,4.245179063360881
1430874,3,B00005JH9Q,"It is pretty weird that this gets the boxed set treatmemt, but hey, I'm not complaining.  This was mondo bizare TV to be sure. This is from Fred Silverman-Era NBC. Silverman took the  ""chuck- it-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks"" approach to TV programming and, here's just one of the results. (Others include BJ and the Seven Lady Truckers, SuperTrain, Brady Brides, Manimal...oh, I could go on and on, but its too painful.)
PL and Jeff attempted to plug into the same kind of hipster vibe that Saturday Night Live and Don Kirschner's Rock Concert did. It failed, but it did give us a delicious sort of camp. Everybody's so earnest in trying to make it work and watching it is the best train wreck you'll over laugh yourself silly over.",1048809600,,740,4.865079365079365
1430875,3,B00005JH9Q,"I've always heard that words couldn't describe how awful this show was.  Curiousity got the better of me and I decided to subject myself to all six episodes in this set.
There's no doubt about it that this is hands down one of the worst variety shows ever made.  It make the Brady Bunch Variety Hour look like an Emmy award-winning masterpiece.
One thing that makes this a nice period piece is the guest stars.  Where else but on an early 1980s variety show could you see Donny Osmond, Larry Hagman, Boomer the dog, Hugh Hefner, Sherman Hemsley and others?
Pink Lady are actually a very interesting piece of Japanese pop culture but NBC failed when they brought them to the American television audience.  Instead of letting the girls do what they do best-singing in Japanese and dancing with cloned robotic precision, the writers tried to give Mie and Kei distinct personalities and made them sing mostly in English.  Add in the fact that they were paired with unfunny supporting actors and that the girls could barely speak English and you have a recipe for disaster.
NBC could've truly had an usual cult show if they would've created a different format for Pink Lady.  They could've shown it late at night (perhaps in the timeslot for SNL or David Letterman) and had a Neo-Tokyo Anime style set.  Mie and Kei could've spoken in Japanese with subtitles (like Kaga in early episode of ""Iron Chef"") or with a futuristic robotic translator.  The real show featured some early video clips from Blondie and Cheap Trick.  Perhaps if Pink Lady had introduced video clips instead of guest stars, MTV (which didn't even exist when this show was aired) would be very different today.
As you watch these episodes, try to image what could've been.  If you want to minimize your exposure to Pink Lady, check out Episode 3.  It has Mie and Kei singing their Japanese hit ""UFO"" with great dance moves and it has Greg Evigan from ""BJ and the Bear"" performing a halfway decent song.
Audio commentary from Sid and Marty Krofft and Jeff Altman should've been a MUST on this set.  I'd love to hear their explanations for putting this on the air and how they would've reacted after having to view these shows after 20 years.  A ""Behind the Music"" style documentary could've helped U.S. viewers to see how popular Pink Lady were in Japan and presented a different side to them from their variety show.
The extras in the set are minimal.  Jeff Altman introduces each show and there is a small gallery of TV print ads.  The box promises the history of Pink Lady as one of the extras but some of the text pages seemed to be missing when I viewed them.

There only 2 episodes on each disc and the box is very bulky; it's thicker than some VHS cases.  There are also no captions.  Sometimes Mie and Kei are hard to understand and subtitles would've helped.  Chapters for each Pink Lady song would've been useful also.
The curious who wish to watch this are warned to take it in small doses.  If you are looking for something to clear out a room of partygoers that have overstayed their welcome, this is the DVD for you.",1028246400,6,3093,4.578947368421052
1430876,1,B00005JH9Q,"NBC, in its non-glory days, produced this, the worst piece of variety show garbage in television history.  No wonder the variety show went the way of the do-do.  Pink Lady may have been great in their day, but they should have kept their distance from television, let alone a network lingering at the bottom of the ratings barrel at the time.  The only good thing about this show was Jeff, the only saving grace of this forgettable piece of TV history.  Save your money...stay away from this piece of poisoned sukyaki.",1024185600,,518,4.65934065934066
1430877,1,B00005JH9Q,"I don't drink, so I was sober when I bought this DVD, hoping I could get some unintentional laughs out of it. Unfortunately, the only thing funny about this disc set is why I bought it at all.
The ""so-bad-it's-funny"" element of PL&J wears thin about 10 minutes into the first episode. By then it's easy to see why this show is so infamous; the sketches were lame, the running gags never got any better with age, and the whole premise just needed working out before this went to air in the spring of 1980. What's really bad about this is how some great guest stars such as Sid Caesar, Red Buttons, Larry Hagman, Sherman Hemsley (of ""The Jeffersons"") and more are wasted here.
On the positive side, Red Buttons' ""Abraham Lincoln Roast"" on episode 5 and Byron Allen's monologue on episode 6 are worth viewing, but they are the exception, not the rule.
In the interview segment, Jeff Altman (who gets zero laughs in all six episodes) admits that the premise was faulty and that the execution was inept. Krofft Entertainment should have erased the tapes of this disaster immediately after NBC pulled the plug, but they had to let it turn up on DVD two decades later instead. If any ambitious and/or sadistic TV station has an anthology series called ""Disasterpiece Theater,"" expect to see this on it.
Caveat emptor (buyer beware).",1006732800,,1325,4.666666666666667
7938706,5,B00005JH9Q,"The short-lived television series PINK LADY (& JEFF) is an archaic study of variety shows gone by. Starring the beautiful and talented Japanese Super Stars of the day PINK LADY, and up and coming funny man Jeff Altman, this set is a treasure of sometimes so-bad it's good entertainment. Lame jokes, stilted phoneticly learned English, shameless racial stereotyping, and a tired format...all played out on a gorgeous stage, and augmented by The Peacock Dancers!

Not everything falls flat, of course, but the producers could not have been more wrong-headed on how they handled the program. As one reviewer of the time said ""NBC promises to take us to an exotic Japanese restaurant and gives us a Big Mac"". That really concisely sums it up! You have typical made for mass American consumption fare here, spiced by a delicious unfamiliar sauce that has been watered down to more closely resemble ketchup. Two singers who sold 100 Million records in their home country are forced to sing re-heated US hits in a language that they just bairly understand, if at all!

The producers took Mie & Kei's natural act, and have pressed a sort of Tony Orlando and Dawn schtick on the trio that they form with Altman. Mie, who repeats English with the most clarity, is portrayed as the sweetest of the two. Kei, on the other hand, is portrayed as the synical, lightly surly one, quick to make Jeff the butt of jokes.

Hot celebs of the day trot through, such as Larry Hagman and Sherman Helmsley, of DALLAS & THE JEFFERSON'S, respectively. Stars of two other Sid & Marty Kroft variety series show up, as well: Donny Osmond and Florence Henderson (DONNY & MARIE, THE BRADY HOUR). Musical guests are sometimes live (Roy Orbinson), or piped in via video (Blondie, Cheap Trick).

Classic commedienes also appear to try and lend some punch to the ratings which flagged heavily after a decent debut. Jerry Lewis is in fine form. Bert Parks makes fun of himself and his recent termination from the Miss America pageant. Sid Caesar and Redd Buttons make multiple appearances.

Jim Varney, Cherie Steinkeller and Anna Mathias are on hand, as part of the talented supporting cast, who handle most of the comedy along with Altman and the special guests.

Greg Evigan impresses in his music spots, and Teddy Pendergrass is electric. Even Hugh Hefner and his Playmates pop in for a visit!

Pink Lady is eventually allowed to strut their stuff and sing in Japanese, but too rarely. As noted in the extras, the duo was exhausted by the grueling experience of the series, and their busy concert schedule. Even if the show had climbed in the ratings, it is doubtful the girls would have agreed to continue on. Up against The Dukes Of Hazard and The Love Boat on Friday nights, they didn't stand much of a chance, anyway.

So, should you watch this muddle? YES! Embarassing humour abounds, and the lopsided mix of music is both fascinating and entertaning. The cast tries valiantly, especially Altman, who sometimes seems on the verge of panting from the effort. The guy succesfully lampoons Richard Nixon, Evangelism and cut-rate tv pitch-people, with panache. Some of the material and music DOES work, and if the show always ends with a scene of the girls and Jeff in a hot tub, well...there are harder things to take than Pink Lady in bikinis...no pun intended.

Further, despite the awkward constraints they are shackled with, Mie and Kei of Pink Lady are completely charming. You really want them to succeed, and when they really shine as they do on their own # 1 Japanese hits UFO and MONSTER, you catch a glimpse of why they were so huge there in the first place. As the episodes continue, the lady's enunciation and singing in English improves, as does the overall quality of the show. By the time of the final eps (one of which didn't even air), thngs have come together rather nicely. Hardly one of the worst shows ever. In fact, the series begins to demonstrate it's promise and potential.

If you slap down for this set, you will find the packaging amusingly dated, and clumsy. Each of the six episodes are introduced by Altman, who also grants a bonus interview. Insightful, witty and right to the point, Jeff gives his personal spin on events as they happened.

The series is more than a failed curio, but even if it was simply that, you can hardly blame Pink Lady or Jeff. In the end it may have been more of the same-o same-o that plagued variety shows, but underneath the glossy shellack, a lot of real talent struggled to be free. That effort alone is worth your time, let alone your compulsive look at the scene of a ""tragedy"". Kick back, have fun, and THINK PINK!!!",1437436800,,4652,4.709717097170972

7938712,5,B00005JH9Q,"Yes, this show was produced in 1980, but it is pure late 70s through and through.  Many people may say, ""How could a show this bad actually be produced?""  However, if one looks at the comparable TV shows of the era, Pink Lady & Jeff can easily be dissected into an amalgam of every variety show that had come before it.

Although even the best of the late 70's variety shows were pure cheese, the ratings could not be argued with.  Sonny & Cher and Donny & Marie perfected the formula of these variety hours.  Other, lesser examples of the time included Captain & Tenille, Tony Orlando & Dawn, and of course The Brady Bunch Variety Hour.  The last of which, produced by the same team responsible for Pink Lady & Jeff, would probably have received the honor of ""worst variety show ever produced"" had a certain Japanese pop group and low-rent comedian never gotten together.

Pink Lady & Jeff takes the variety show format and presents it in an unfunny, watered-down, non-sensical way.  It truly is a program that is amazingly awful.  You cannot help but sit there, mouth agape, while an endless array of confusing comedy sketches, uncomprehensible accents, and horribly un-PC ""jokes"" are thrown around for six hour-long shows.  Jeff (Altman) is the host of the show for all intents and purposes.  His jokes are horrible, however I am not sure if he is fully to blame as I doubt he wrote all his bits himself.  Pink Lady probably have charisma and charm, but it does not translate well to American audience (obviously, based on the dismal ratings these six episodes garnered).  They read their lines phonetically, and make no bones about the fact that they have NO idea what they are saying.  They stand there, head down, waiting for Jeff to finish speaking.  Then one of them will look up, attempt to spit out some kind of degrading remark about Jeff, and get an obviously sweetened hearty laugh from the studio audience.  This is repeated ad infinitum throughout the course of the series.  Of course, these are interspersed with the aforementioned bad comedy sketches (think Laugh-In Lite) and sometimes surprisingly good guest stars and song-and-dance numbers.

Now, this review may sound like I hated this show.  Quite the opposite, actually.  I ate up every minute of it!  It's one of those shows that you almost feel sorry for.  It's like a dog that is so ugly it is cute.  If you can think of it in that regard, all the while imagining what must have been going on in the guest stars heads as they bumbled through this nonsense, you can have a VERY fun, enjoyable time with this series.  But, as a qualifier, I must say that this is a show for those who appreciate camp value and understand it completely.  Because with this show, you ain't got nothin' else!

My only beef with this set is the confusing packaging.  It's in a giant amaray case and includes three discs.  There are two episodes on each disc, so it's kind of a bulky DVD set for a six episode series.  Other than that, this set is great.  The menus are kind of busy, but the picture quality is perfect.  It looks slightly better than a first generation VHS tape, which is really better than should be expected for a show of this caliber.

So, in conclusion, if you enjoy the more popular and well-known variety shows of the time, definitely check out Pink Lady & Jeff.  It may not be good for you, but it sure is fun to watch!",1259625600,2,3396,4.560330578512397
7938713,4,B00005JH9Q,"It's hard to describe what a BIG deal Pink Lady was in Japan - For almost five years, everyone followed what they did, ate, wore... and they bought guidebooks on how to do the steps for each of their songs. During the opening of ""Pink Lady and Jeff"" you see them perched on convertibles in a huge stadium packed with frenzied fans. Even now in Japan there are commercials referring to some of their most famous songs.

This show was just a travesty - they'd had a surprisingly successful show in Vegas, so Sid and Marty thought, ""Well maybe..."" But at the same time, Pink Lady's popularity was slipping - they'd overstepped some boundaries and the Japanese public felt that Pink Lady were getting too big for their satin mini-britches.

The travesty is that they weren't allowed to draw on their strongest point - the fact that they did everything in perfect unison, like disco fembots. The producers forced them to take on different personalities - one sweet and ditzy, the other sharp-tongued, and they were very uncomfortable. Plus, they were singing English disco songs which were already a couple years old in America. In the very last episode they sang some of their Japanese hits - the relief is palpable when you watch them.

There were worse shows at the time - I just saw Paul Lynde's 1976 Halloween Special, and believe me, Pink Lady and Jeff is Shakespeare compared to that!

I do recommend seeing this, but try to trick one of your friends into buying this, then watch it together. Read more about Pink Lady in the wonderful ""Encyclopedia of Japanese Pop Culture"" which is where I first learned about them!",1204070400,5,1619,4.690140845070423
7938714,5,B00005JH9Q,"I have a tape I made of this series from the old Trio Network, which broadcast a whole set of television flops, and yes, Virginia, this is absolutely the worst TV show ever - it makes the Brady Kids etc. specials look like Citizen Kane.  The two girls can't speak English and just look bewildered most of the time as they mouth some of the most tiresome ""jokes"" from some of the chessiest hack writers of all time, and it has all sorts of racists imagery including some fat Japanese guy dressed up like a Samauri running around threatening Jeff with a sword (oh ha ha).  Jeff, of course, was the guy they brought in to speak English, and he is - if it is possible - even chessier than the absurd jokes the girls are forced to ""deliver.""  His stupid ridiculous etc. Nixon impressions were probably great hits in some lounge in Grand Rapids, Michigan, full of drunk Rotatarians, but they don't even evoke a groan, just an eye-roll that any human being could possibly, at any time ever, find them entertaining.  The dancers are fifth rate, not too attractive, and obviously going through the motions of some of the most absurd 70s chirography possible (and they are rarely even together).  The guests are people like Hugh Hefner, who wanders around in a bathrobe (sorry, ""dressing gown,"") with braindead playmates hinting about all the sex he is supposedly having and that you are not.  Jim Varney had talent as we all know, but is swamped by such utterly bad material that even he has trouble taking it seriously.  The ""guest"" musical acts are just cheap videos put on to make the thing relevant - Blondie's ain't bad..  And, of course, everyone is dressed in third-rate costumes put together by some designer who got drunk in Vegas and caught Elvis a couple of times.

Everytime I begin to bitch about how bad television is today, I just put this on, and suddenly I am so glad that some thirty years separate myself from this radioactive excrement that smells so badly I have to put on a DVD of ""My Mother the Car"" to clean the place up.

Now with all that said, why am I buying the DVD set?  Because this is a treasure that represents the depths of mediocrity to which the human imagination can plunge, and I just love it.  P.S. Also my wife thinks it's great (it was a shotgun wedding lol).",1184630400,4,2291,4.493975903614458
7938715,2,B00005JH9Q,"""Pink Lady and Jeff"" was a variety show from the late 70's or early 80's - hell I don't know. All I remember is, I was in love with this show when I was a kid. It was a show with jokey skits and musical guests and all that, hosted by two cute Japanese women and an American comedian named Jeff Altman. Jeff Altman's other grand roles include ""Weather Wizard"" from 1979's opus ""Legends of the Superheroes"" and 2007 ""Urban Decay"" where he plays ""Man in Dumpster.""

The ladies were Keiko Matsuda and Mitsuyo Nemoto. The IMDB has one little nibble of interesting trivia about Keiko: ""She is one half of the Japanese singing duo ""Pink Lady"". And Mitsuyo's trivia is only slightly more riveting: ""She is one half of the Japanese singing duo ""Pink Lady"" with Keiko Masuda.""

Such was the ""talent"" behind the very ill-fated run of ""Pink Lady and Jeff."" Weirdly, the girls were big hits in Japan throughout the 70's and 80's, having turned some popular American songs into Japanese versions with different lyrics. Problem is, some doofus saw them and thought it would be a great idea to put them on tv with a second-rate clown telling bad jokes:

Jeff: ""You girls are the biggest thing in Japan!""

Pink Lady: ""No, Jeff, the biggest thing in Japan is Godzilla!""

Ba-DUM-dum.

Not only could the girls speak very little English, but the guy was just as bad at the language of humor. Why did I like this show when I was young?? Because the girls were hot? I don't know. All I know is, I wasted twenty+ bucks on this thing, thinking I could relive a childhood curiosity. All I got for my money was an irresistable need to write a rant review. If you feel like gritting your teeth while laughing at sheer ineptitude, buy ""Pink Lady and Jeff."" Then, check out ""Plan Nine From Outer Space."" They're the same thing.",1171324800,,1798,4.5
