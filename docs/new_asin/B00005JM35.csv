1472343,4,B00005JM35,"I must say that this item is oddly appealing. While it seems like a nice children's Christmas story in the ads, it isn't. The jokes and the general tone of this little film are not really kiddy fare. Santa and the Snowman have a war, which it's exactly in the Christmas Spirit. No blood or swearing, it's just over the heads of kiddies. This film started as an IMAX 3-D movie, and is probably most appealing to very young teenagers. When I first saw the relatively simple designs and CGI, I was slightly disappointed. But, to be honest, I've re-watched this DVD at least 5 times (unusual for me), and I'll probably watch it twice every Christmas. The 3-D effects are what makes this DVD captivating. There are many cheesey, disappointing 3-D DVDs out there -- but this one was done right. It's in HQFS (High Quality Field Sequential 3-D, the best kind), so you'll need the shutter glasses (like the ones found in ASIN: B00005QW5S). It's a quirky little Christmas movie, but it's 3-D has a bit of ""wow"" appeal, without being ""in your face"".",1126569600,2,1039,4.591397849462366
1472344,1,B00005JM35,"Someone bought this 3D DVD for my almost 5 year old daughter.  We thought the special effects would be fascinating and they were.  However,  within minutes of the movie's beginning my daughter was in tears. I won't say why but she found the plot frightening.  Several times during the movie I tried to talk her out of watching but she wanted to see what happened in the end.  Fortunately the movie is relatively short.  Overall, I found the story to be a cynical look at Christmas.  As an adult, I think it might be humourous to watch after a hard day of Christmas shopping but I urge caution before showing it to young children.  There was way too much animated violence to match the spirit of Christmas.",1102032000,12,705,4.496062992125984
1472345,4,B00005JM35,"It really is an enjoyable film, Awsome in Imax 3D and at home if you have the Sensio, or field sequential version. The dvd that comes with the Red/Blue ""3D"" glasses inside doesn't work and is only good for 2D viewing. The 3D effects on the Sensio and field sequential versions work as they should! The field sequential version IS availible on Amazon so get it instead of the Red/Blue Analglyphic.

-I originaly gave 4 stars on the Red/ Blue version only for the fact that I really enjoyed the film in IMAX the Sensio DVD that just came out should recieve 5, however you can't change that in a review edit.",1100908800,4,605,4.401785714285714
1472346,2,B00005JM35,"It is very difficult to review this DVD and give it correct stars. If you consider the 2D version, it would get 4 or 5 stars as the animation and colors are wonderful with a very humorous story. BUT the 3D version is terrible. The 3D is about the worst ever, it never really produces a 3D effect and the red/blue glasses dull and changes to colors making it almost a black and white film. None of the 3D effects really work. The best of them is the falling snow. Often the viewer sees the two images ruining the whole effect and making it impossible to concentrate on the story.

A recommendation is to forget the 3D version and just play the 2D version. Both are on the disk.

When 3D was first introduced, people complained that they got headaches from the 3D. This DVD definitely falls into that catagory. Perhaps in Imax with the gray poloroid glasses, the effects work. NOT on this disk.",1098316800,9,892,4.4
1472347,4,B00005JM35,"I saw this flick the first time in 3D in the IMAX theater.  Let me tell you, the graphics were no less than stunning.  The movie starts out very sweet and cute... but soon shifts-gears to reveal a hysterical story with some great satire... some laugh-out-loud one-liners and clever references to other movies!  With voices by Jonathan Winters, Victoria Jackson and Ben Stein, this is a fun movie for all ages.  At the end of the movie, the ""outtakes"" are very fun too.

I was so excited to hear that this was coming out on DVD, I had to purchase it immediately.  Though the movie was still just as fun, I must admit I was a bit disappointed with the 3D effects on a television.  Part of the problem is they use the old-fashioned red-blue 3D glasses, which really detract from the rich colors of the film... making it seem almost black & white.  (In the IMAX theater, they used the gray 3D glasses which allowed much better effect and kept the colors more vivid.)

I was also disappointed to see no real Extra features... no director's commentary or behind-the-scenes or anything.  All they had were a couple of simple interactive games, which became tiresome after about 20 seconds.

In summary... a great flick... much better if you can see it in 3D Imax splendor... but still a fun movie!",1097884800,10,1290,4.565217391304348
1472348,5,B00005JM35,"I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE DVD(IN 3D) NOT THE VHS(2D).THIS FILM AIRED ON TV AS A CHRISTMAS 30 MINUTE SPECIAL IN 1997(IN 2D).THEN IN 2002 IMAX DECIDED TO RELEASE THE FILM AS A 3D IMAX FEATURE.KIDS AND ADULTS FLOCKED THE IMAX 3D SHOWINGS.THEY WERE IN SHOCK  AS SNOWFLAKES AND REINDEER CAME OFF THE SCREEN RIGHT AT THEM.THE FILM IS NOW ON DVD (IN GLORIOUS 3D).I GOT THIS FILM AND I PUT ON THE 3D GLASSES.AND I HAVE A 28 INCH TV AND THW 3D ACTUALLY IS AWESOME.THE SNOWFLAKS ACTAULLY LOOK LIKE THERE FALLING IN YOUR LIVING ROOM.AND OTHER THINGS COMES OFF THE SCREEN REALLY FAR,EVEN ON MY 13 INCH TV !!!!!",1097712000,3,615,4.256410256410256
1472349,2,B00005JM35,"I unfortunately wound up seeing this Christmas Misgiving on its original airing.  I have always been a fan of any Christmas special since Rudolph hit the air way back when. Each holiday season I hope for something to come along that has the potential to become the ""New Rudolph"".  This is so far away from that you would need the Hubble Space scope in order to see how close it came.  The imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise. Regrettably the story makes Santa vs. the Martins look like an Oscar contender.  Such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3D gimmickry.  You can't improve on failure. After it aired on TV I didn't see it return in later years on regular TV. I didn't miss it then and was hoping to extend the pleasure indefinitely.  Can't win them all.",1095811200,3,815,4.436241610738255
1472350,5,B00005JM35,"I happened to see this on television a few years back (and taped it at the same time).  I was suprised to discover a new, wonderfully humorous Christmas program done in the ""Jimmy Neutron-style"" of computer animation (same writer and producer as Jimmy).  A snowman decides that he wants to be like Santa and hilarity ensues.  The program features a fantastic voice-cameo of Ben Stein as a North Pole tour guide.  The narration is provided by the deep-voiced announcer who is the voice behind many movie trailers.  There are many humorous touches throughout the show including allusions to Star Wars and more.  The story concludes with a positive moral that wraps it up beautifully.  This deserves a place in your classics of Christmas collection - mine sits right next to Rudolph!",1055894400,11,780,4.908396946564886
1472461,5,B00005JM35,"I first saw this movie on IMAX 3D with my nephew, when he was 4.  We were there to see Polar Express, but this short animated film was all he needed.  Some people might not like the antagonism or simple battle scenes of Santa's army vs the Snowman's army, but we loved it.  Cute movie, with great action scenes, and a nice moral.  Highly recommended - especially for little boys who like action.",1397606400,,395,4.36986301369863
1472462,5,B00005JM35,"the movie uses a 3D technology different from what nowadays is used. You need some kind of stereoscopic (field sequential) player to correctly display it. I guess more recent versions of the windows mediaplayer are able to display it on your pc. Alternatively, you can get software that is able to display this format. Some TVs may support field sequential format as well. In order to see the 3D movie, you need glasses with red and green colors. The movie itself is lovely at Christmas time.",1391472000,,492,4.732558139534884
1472463,5,B00005JM35,"This is a wonderful and original story of life at the North Pole, modern enough to discuss Santa's use of wormholes to explain his ability to deliver presents in one night, but traditional enough that you'll feel the same way you do when the Abominable Snow Monster puts the star on the tree. Absolutely recommended. Plus, the ""outtakes"" are highly amusing. ""Bing, Bang, Boom - where's the Boom?!?""

Ok, we must admit that this 3D feature was intended for IMAX theaters (go see it if your local IMAX shows it every year, as our does), and that this was made before people started getting 3D televisions. Yes, it does have a 3D version, but it's the old red-and-blue glasses variety, so don't bother watching it unless your children are small and enjoy the novelty. I still have the glasses, but we don't watch it in 3D any more.",1387756800,,828,4.594594594594595
1472464,5,B00005JM35,Clever rendering of Santa as a bad-to-the-bone (but loveable) action hero. Even a cold-hearted rogue snowman can't resist loving this Santa. Great animation details.,1387497600,,165,5.916666666666667

1472466,1,B00005JM35,"I took my three grandchildren ages 2 1/2 to 6 to the IMAX presentation of Santa Vs. the Snowman at our local Children's Science Museum. I was with my daughter-in-law and after no more than 10 minutes we removed the children from the theater. The elves are rude and crude. But what I was absolutely flabbergasted at was the conversation between two elves which in essence went like this: One elf asks the other if he's put a ring on his girlfriend's finger yet and the other elf replies, ""Why buy the Ice House if you already get the ice for free!"" I was offended by this movie and so disappointed that I had taken the children to something geared for kids and exposed them to something so inappropriate. I would have given this movie a 0 but that option not available.",1357084800,,768,4.415492957746479

An elf talks of getting caught in his wifes clothing, I didn't find that funny at all. Sick if you ask me and doesn't belong in a childrens show. I really liked the plot and the characters except for the two elves in the control room. I broke my cd in half and threw it in the trash.",1323475200,,395,3.95

1472552,4,B00005JM35,"I am giving this four stars, although I have mixed feelings.  This video has become a Christmas tradition for us.  We have had it for four years.  My kids invite their friends over, and thanks to ebay, we now have over 20 pair of 3D glasses.  The kids LOVE this show.  Me personally...a little boring. I think the kids just like to wear the glasses.  Now before this year I would have been 3 stars, except we have one of those new samsung tvs that refreshes really fast...it really looks 3-D, which brought my rating back up to a four.  If you are debating for adult watch, probably skip it.  If you are looking for kids 8 and under, this is an owner.  They love it.",1292976000,,666,4.222222222222222

1472558,1,B00005JM35,"No...seriously. This movie was so bad, it made me sick.

1. The 3D did not exist. The 3D glasses are useless. How they can package this as 3D, I do not know. I was very very disappointed.

2. The story line was tired and contrived. It's basically the same one as the Nightmare Before Christmas. The snowman takes over Christmas, etc.....

3. The animation was 3rd rate and poorly done.

Stay far away from this movie. Previous reviews here have got to be from people that have a stake in this movie because they are totally wrong. Don't waste your money or time with this garbage.",1227312000,,580,4.443396226415095

The snowman has a depth of character you wouldn't expect from his simple look and makes a great arch-nemesis for Santa. And it actually got the kids thinking because the snowman has an understandable motive for taking on Santa.
