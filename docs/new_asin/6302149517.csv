7822122,5,6302149517,"In 1985, Maurice Pialat followed the excellent ""&Agrave; nos amours"" (""To Our Loves"" 1983) with the taut social-drama ""Police"". The film can easily be misinterpreted for another 'tough-cop' story, however, there's a lot more going on here. Hardened and seasoned Parisian detective 'Mangin' (Gerard Depardieu) is working with his fellow colleagues from Marseilles, to nail a gang of drug-trafficking Tunisian brothers. When one of the brothers, along with his beautiful girlfriend 'Noria' (Sophie Marceau) gets arrested, fast-talking 'Lambert' (Richard Anconina), the family lawyer is able to get her released on bail, where she immediately goes to work on plans of her own!

Depardieu's character: for all his swagger and macho-attitude, is really soft and vulnerable on the inside, and is desperately trying to find ""love"" and something to make his life worth living. 'Noria' on the other hand is drained of these feelings, and by her own words knows only how to lie. Her only interest is money and more of it. I think her emotional failings are a combination of her criminal background experience and the life she's known in her North African/Arabic upbringing (especially the barbaric and misogynistic treatment she receives from the men in her circle). While 'Mangin' himself initially corresponds to this behavior towards women, for him it's really a self-defense instinct and mostly an act and not a reflection of his real persona. The same can't be said of 'Noria's' male-counterparts in her North African affiliation. I won't give anymore away, only to say this is an excellent film with some outstanding performances by Gerard Depardieu, Sophie Marceau, Richard Anconina, and Sandrine Bonnaire (who was also in ""&Agrave; nos amours""). Sophie Marceau was only 18 when this film was made, yet she exuded a maturity that was beyond her years. The same can be said of the stunningly beautiful Sandrine Bonnaire who was only 17, but was already a veteran of several films. I highly recommend this film, and its commentary on the social human-drama. The DVD picture and sound quality by Olive Films is excellent, the film has been completely restored. NTSC, French (English subtitles), NR 109 mins. (BTW: the story is based on an original idea by Catherine Breillat.)

7822123,4,6302149517,Young cast but a grown up story that highlights some weird Frenchmen who are walking off the beaten path to a bizarre ending.,1394236800,,125,4.478260869565218
7822124,5,6302149517,"Up to now, you could only see this film on VHS.  Gerard Depardieu plays a straight and very tough cop (Mangin) trying to investigate and capture the members of a Tunisian drug ring. Expect violence since he is more than willing to beat up his subjects. Then suddenly before him he is asked to interrogate a quite beautiful Arab girl-woman (played intensely by a young Sophie Marceau). He tries the same technique.

But although this police officer wants to do his job - and truly loathes criminals - he simply cannot control his dark attraction to his new suspect (Noria).  But the game is - who is in control of whom.

I have rarely seen desire put on the screen more viscerally - as the police officer has to battle his heart or his head over how far he will become involved with his prey.",1349654400,4,791,4.43448275862069
7822125,3,6302149517,"Nicht gerade umwerfend. Wie eine x-beliebige Krimiserie im Fernsehen. Kein Meisterwerk. Alle lgen und betrgen sich gegenseitig. Depardieu wie Sophie Marceau, die alle reinlegt. Sie sieht allerdings recht durchschnittlich aus, die Rolle htte mit irgend einer x-beliebigen Frau aus der Nachbarschaft genau so besetzt werden knnen.
Mir gefiel die franzsische Umgebung in Paris und Marseille, aber die stndig schnell quasselnden Schauspieler habe ich schon in besseren Filmen gesehen. Ein mal sehen reicht. Es gibt aus Frankreich ganz tolle Kriminalfilme wie ""Frantic"" oder ""Fahrstuhl zum Schaffott"", aber dieser hat mich nicht sehr beeindruckt.",1006560000,,641,5.978260869565218
7822126,4,6302149517,"A gritty contemp French drama like no other.  Pialat truely brought the cop genre into the modern era, even before the *so called* impromptu realistic portrayal of cop drams such as NYPD blues and so forth.  It was  the first to use experimental hand held cameras and improv permances by  Depadieu and among the excellent cast, a young Sophie Marceau.  The tone  and rhythm truely sets itself apart from other very high quality European  Cinema of the period(mostly historical).",962928000,2,478,4.974683544303797
7822127,5,6302149517,"I loved this movie! It is typical French Cinema. Tough (very tough) cop  Depardieu slowly falls for lovely drug-dealer Sophie Marceau. Depardieu is  a marvel to see, struggling between his work and his feelings for her.  Sophie is an excellent cast, combining her ""good girl"" face with  a not-so-good living... Director Maurice Pialat is excellent too. I was not  familiar with his work, now I'm looking forward to seeing more of his  movies.",961891200,6,442,4.986301369863014
