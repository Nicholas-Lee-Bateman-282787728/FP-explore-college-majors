8585089,3,B00CQRNLAQ,Not a very good depiction of the life of a real tennis teaching professional.  The tennis scenes that depicted tennis professionals had actors that looked like they never played tennis.  Could use use some good instruction from a certified teaching pro.,1381708800,,253,5.146341463414634
8585090,5,B00CQRNLAQ,"This is a cute, entertaining movie. It's a fun romantic comedy where ""Owen Match"" is seeking redemption after getting fired from his job as a tennis pro.... There are lot of familiar faces from TV and other movies here....You will have a smile on your face and be in a better mood after 90 minutes of watching this movie...",1380931200,,323,4.491525423728813
8585091,5,B00CQRNLAQ,"2nd Serve is a nice little money to watch and just enjoy.  It's just that - enjoyable and entertaining.  The major plot line of redemption - former tennis star looking to find himself again, both personally and professionally - may be predictable, but it's time-honored and easy to follow.  Hopkins is funny and likeable and Gilmore is cute. It's not the $100 bottle of wine, but more like the drinkable, tasty and affordable bottle you share over dinner.  Just drink it (watch it) and enjoy!",1380844800,2,492,4.752941176470588
8585092,5,B00CQRNLAQ,"Cute, fun and sweet. There are some really funny parts, but also some sweet moments. Even if you don't play tennis, you'll still love Josh Hopkins as an ex player, tennis pro with a hidden side writing poetry.",1379462400,,209,4.526315789473684
8585093,5,B00CQRNLAQ,"Excellently executed feel good movie. A great way to lighten up your mood and forget about the problems of life for a while.

More then 2 thumbs up if I had more than 2 thumbs.",1379462400,,176,4.0285714285714285
8585094,5,B00CQRNLAQ,"This is a movie that will make you smile... It's a real happy feel-good movie, with some interesting characters who we can all relate too. It's a good, old-fashioned romantic comedy that will put you in a good mood! Anyone who likes a fun romantic comedy - and tennis - will really enjoy this movie!",1379203200,,299,4.454545454545454
8585095,5,B00CQRNLAQ,Loved this movie. Laughed out loud several times but was also moved by the relationships. A comedy with a lot of heart. A cool combination. Highly recommend!,1376784000,,157,4.851851851851852
