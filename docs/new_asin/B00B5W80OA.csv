5559473,3,B00B5W80OA,"I am an older, 15-pounds overweight lady (just ask my doctor!) who happens to like Tracy Anderson. So, I'm not exactly the fittest person in the world, but I do like her other mat workouts.  With Teen Meta, I'm only on Level 1, and I have to say, if I was a teen and was forced to do this workout I would rather do my homework-it is HARD!!  I'm not quite sure how I can get through her Mat Workout DVD and not through these butt exercises. Anyway, not easy, people!

If you're a fan, you'll recognize a lot of her moves. I long ago gave up on her cardio DVDs b/c I'm a spazz and totally uncoordinated, but I did browse through the Cardio 2 with the dance troupe, and I have hope that I'll be able to learn along with everyone else. Cardio 1--still too difficult for an old, confused bat like myself. Other thoughts:

1) I giant star off for no cueing. I am talking ZERO. At least she gives occasional cues or  voice-overs on her other DVDs, but I think some cues or voice-over would have really, really, really helped here. You are facing the floor a lot and you have no idea what is going on b/c it's just music. Also, with just music, it makes the exercises that much more painful b/c of the repetition. Again, I think a teen would give up pretty quickly.

Another star off because you have no idea what the heck is going on. Is your body in the right position? Who knows? I don't understand why Tracy is so averse to giving clear cueing and directions in her videos.

2) Not good for weak wrists. I have to take breaks.

3) That stretchy band seems sort of unsafe for a klutz. I don't know how she keeps it on straight, and I've had too many close calls with it snapping hard against my *ss.

4) Tracy is very smiley and seems like she's having a good time (she also looks more like Gwynnie than ever before), so it's definitely more upbeat which is a great change of pace. However, I think her set will look outdated in a few years.

I think I'll be mixing in these mat workouts with my other stuff. As for the cardio, I'm sticking to running and walking unless Cardio 2 makes me feel better about dancing.",1365724800,23,2110,4.2004950495049505
5559474,3,B00B5W80OA,"Normally, Tracy Anderson's programs come with a workout calendar. I just opened the Teen Meta set and there is no schedule. Are the recommendations actually discussed in the DVDs?",1365638400,,179,5.206896551724138
5559475,5,B00B5W80OA,"Like the previous reviewer, I'm not a teen, but I bought this since I wanted to work my way into doing Glutecentric Metamorphosis, and thought that it would be a good transition into the longer commitment that Glutecentric requires.  This is a great introduction to Tracy Anderson's muscular structure work, and you can use it regardless of your age.

The set comes with four DVDs and a band that you use for the workouts.

The cardio workout has two parts:  a 20-minute segment that is just Tracy doing some freestyle dance moves, and a 10-minute segment with Tracy and one of the Tracy Anderson Method (TAM) trainers Maria doing the dance with an inner-city dance troupe.  The idea is to combine both segments so that you're doing a 30-minute workout.  If you've been frustrated with the lack of cueing in some of Tracy's other dance DVDs, you might like this one better since this one moves a lot more slowly and Tracy breaks things down more.

The three muscular structure workouts are 30 minutes long each, and both use the included band.  They have about 30 reps for the legs, and are still pretty challenging.  Using the band adds some uniqueness to the moves.

The background is really colorful, and Tracy smiles a lot in the workouts and seems to be having a lot of fun.

If you're used to the Metamorphosis sets, which each target a person's problem areas, this set doesn't do that since Tracy has said that teens are still developing, and so need a more rounded program.  In that respect, this is almost like an Omnicentric set, in that it targets the entire body.

Another difference between this set and the Metamorphosis sets is that it's also meant to be repeated by teens, whereas in Meta, you only do each workout 10 times, before moving on to the next level.  The TAM trainers have said that this is also because teens' bodies are changing, and they don't need to vary their workouts as much.

If you are buying this for a teen, on the TAM forums, several people have mentioned that it's meant to be used for children ages 10 and up.

Hope that helps!",1363392000,26,2069,4.56639566395664
5559476,5,B00B5W80OA,"This video comes with three different Muscular Structure sequences with a band.  It also comes with 2 cardio components.  I really like the backdrop of teen meta.  It's so much more colorful than Metamorphosis.  If you think this video is just for teens your wrong.  This workout really worked my arms, legs, abs and even the cardio was pretty tough.  The cardio is not as tough as Meta cardio but its a lot more fun.  There is a change in music from the original Meta.  It's more upbeat.  I loved working out with the bands.  I actually liked the Teen Meta better than the original Metamorphosis.  It is definitely worth the buy even if your not a teen.  The first cardio component is twenty minutes and has Tracy jumping around for twenty minutes.  It's better than Meta because she step touches at times and the music makes it all more bearable.  The second cardio component I have not completed because I am still learning the dance moves. She has the teens with her learning the dance steps.  I think I almost have the moves down.

It's a great workout for anyone who is in pretty good shape.",1361577600,36,1097,4.49238578680203
5559477,5,B00B5W80OA,"I am an adult and I love this series. I am a tracy fan and own her precision toning and method mat workouts but I really like this one. The muscular structure videos in this set are shorter than her usual 60 minute workouts, as these are only 30 minutes. I LOVE THEMI don't get bored because you get it all accomplished in 30 minutes. There is not ANY talking in this, so it takes a bit to get used to the workouts and feel comfortable with them, but once you do I like that there isn't any talking. I am about to advance to video #2 and I have already seen a lot of improvement in my thigh and hip area :) I am not the biggest fan of the cardioit's okay but i'd rather pop in a zumba video instead. Overall, nice job Tracy. I am excited that there are a few videos in the set so you can keep going and advancing once your body gets used to the first and second one.",1398816000,5,866,3.9261363636363638
5559478,5,B00B5W80OA,I'm a hardcore Tracy Anderson devotee and this teen meta video is fantastic.  It's a bit easier than traditional Meta (the Omni version) but still offers a good workout. The dance cardio is also easier to follow on this dvd than most of TA's others. It's been added to my regular rotation.,1398211200,4,289,4.5576923076923075
5559479,5,B00B5W80OA,"I am 47,definitely not a Teen,but I really did not enjoy regular Metamorphisis(Hipcentric)and I thought since this was geared torwards Teens,maybe it was more enjoyable&easier to follow. There is still awful cueing,but I did enjoy the set more and the music,as well as the band work. I do have an 11 and a 15 year old daughter,and honestly,I think it would be too difficult for them to follow,but their old mom enjoyed it! I also love Tracy's Mat dvd and Perfect Design Series 1&3,as well as her new Precision Toning.",1393977600,3,517,4.7555555555555555
5559480,2,B00B5W80OA,"I have only done the first 3 videos and there is no talking/direction at all, just music. I have her mat workout, precision toning and the beginners DVD and like them a lot. I thought this would be good for more variety. When I first started doing the video I was wondering why she wasn't talking, but thought it was just for the warm up. Oh no. Even while doing leg exercises on the floor she is silent. You either have to count the reps yourself or keep on turning your head to see if she has changed directions. Pretty annoying/inconvenient. The workouts themselves are okay, they will get you sweating. My band that came with the dvd (which was a nice convenience) keeps on sticking together.",1390521600,4,696,4.488188976377953
5559481,5,B00B5W80OA,"I'm not a teen, but I am a fan of Tracy Anderson. I love this DVD, it's affordable, fun and a great work out. I do the 30 or so minutes of ""strength"" or toning exercises followed by the 20 or so minutes of dance. Since I'm a huge fan of the first metamorphosis workout series and dance, this was right up my alley and perfect to mix up my routines.",1386892800,,348,3.915492957746479

5559483,4,B00B5W80OA,"Like all Tracy workouts, this is great.  My only complaint is that Tracy doesn't talk at all during the workout.  It would be helpful to have some vocal direction, especially when I'm not able to look at the screen to know what is going on (such as when stretching to touch my toes or something).  This workout has fun music, and it will definitely kick your rear.",1384646400,,364,4.402985074626866
5559484,2,B00B5W80OA,"The workout itself is great but the exercise band is totally a flop.

i had 2 of those purple band and it totally snapped under me. Seems like i got caned.. really ""painful"" workout. Then i feedback to them and they sent me another one. But they sent me a lousy one. It is pink instead of purple. (why can't they send the exact band that the dvd came with it, price wise? IDK! ) it is extremely difficult to stretch it out. I fear that it will snap again. It's not the money that i care about, it's the unecessary lashing that made me feel so irksome. I several of her workout dvds- The TAM, Omnicentric metamorphosis, continuity, Pregnancy workout and teen meta. I totally hate those workout that uses the exercise band.. i usually would skip ahead to other segments.. hence, wasting my money. In her continuity DVDs, an exercise band is used 80% of the time, I had wasted those money on those dvds.. probably going to switch to other trainers.

Tracy is definitely a gold-digger like other of her clients said she is.",1384646400,,1019,4.44385026737968

5559486,5,B00B5W80OA,"I am a big Tracey Anderson fan and have her Mat Workout DVD and the Perfect Design Seriers DVDs.  I was looking for a bit of variety and I liked her description of the Teen workout where she says teens need over all fitness, not just targeting specific areas.  This DVD is different in that Tracey doesnt give any instructions during the workout, you just have to follow her moves and they are easy to pick up.  Very clever considering teenagers usually don't listen to instructions.  The music is upbeat and pleasant and the routine is fairly short (about 30mins) and concentrated.  Tracey actually smiles the whole way through the workout, and for once, looks like she is really enjoying it.  Her smile is infectious and I found myself grinning as alot of the moves are very freeing and reminded me of the days of my youth when I would dance around the house to the radio waving my arms around just because I could.  Having said that, theres not alot of warm up so you need to be fairly limber to go straight into it, hence being targeted at teens.  So far I have only done the first workout routine, mixing it in every other day.  The best part for me is I have finally been able to loose those last 4lbs that wouldnt budge of my hips and butt.  So,  if you like Tracey Anderson and want to shake things up a bit, this is definately worth a try.",1379030400,7,1348,4.330677290836653
5559487,2,B00B5W80OA,"I read the reviews of this before I got it. But I was like, there has to be queuing or some talking! Nope! None! Maybe she does it so kids can listen to their own music, but she doesn't give any instruction for proper placement. She moves quickly! If you watch it a couple of times, you can get it. I appreciate that she came out with something for teens! That is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one! It just missed the mark!",1376265600,2,426,3.9651162790697674
5559488,5,B00B5W80OA,Might be made for teens but trust me its hard as H*** to do and its affordable!  Comes with her band to do a ton of arm and leg exercises and 4 DVD's. Heck of a workout and its not easy.  You will love it........ the only thing is that she doesn't say to much during the video so you have to really concentrate on her moves and how many each one she does. Worth every penny. Highly recommend it. And I'm not a teen or anywhere close to it. If you have you tube check out her Dance Cardio with Nicole Richie heck of a workout if you can learn it by the video. I don't usually do reviews but Tracy's stuff works no matter what age you are.,1376092800,3,637,3.8923076923076922
5559489,3,B00B5W80OA,"This is definitely not just for teens!  I agree with previous reviews that the cardio on this disc is much easier to follow than the 45-50 minute dance cardio DVD.  I still prefer her original Mat Workout routine best-it is a great workout and she gives just the right amount of instruction.  There is NO instruction at all on the Teen Meta disc!!  You will need to watch it a few times before you try to do it on your own.  However, If you combine the 20 min cardio and one of the 30 minute workouts you will definitely work up a sweat!  It just takes awhile to get the hang of it.

This workout is a work in progress for me.  I have tried a lot of at home workouts and I usually pick up on routines rather quickly.  This one takes some time to get used to.  I have been doing the cardio and a Disc 1 of the Teen Meta workout for three weeks and I am just starting to feel that I understand the moves enough to concentrate more on the precision of the movements.  If this is your first Tracy Anderson experience I would recommend starting with her Mat Workout DVD.",1375920000,2,1065,4.121359223300971
5559490,5,B00B5W80OA,I love Tracy and knew what kind of exercise DVD this would be prior to purchasing.  The music is great (unlike other DVD workouts) and it's a fun/vibrant session.  Perfect for adults who want to supplement an existing exericise plan without the commitment of doing the adult Meta.,1374796800,2,280,4.8125
5559491,5,B00B5W80OA,"Shipment arrived right on time.  This was a great addition to my other routines by Tracy.  It was nice to have
some additional variety.  Great workout.",1373068800,,151,4.730769230769231
5559492,5,B00B5W80OA,I love these set of tracy workout. Even though im not a teen still do these workout during the weekend and they are very effective.,1372723200,2,131,4.28
5559493,4,B00B5W80OA,"I love Tracy Anderson's workouts and I love what they are doing for me.  Teen META is easier than the Customized adult Metamorphosis programs.  I bought this to add to my adult Metamorphosis on the days I wanted more toning work.  The layout is more colorful, but she didn't even speak throughout the first toning section. At least there is voice over in the adult version. I am used to the way she operates and it didn't faze me although it might be harder for a beginner.

The dance section wasn't nearly as fun as Metamorphosis so I can't see myself using that disc again.  If you can't afford Metamorphosis this is a great option, but I prefer the adult version much more overall.  As a supplement workout this does the trick and adds some new variety moves with the band.",1370822400,6,776,4.468085106382978
5559494,5,B00B5W80OA,"I was thinking about getting the Tracy Anderson method but thought it was too much money for a few discs. So when I saw the Teen Meta, I thought it would be perfect. Cheap price and it works all over the body. I had to stop so many times with this since there are so many repetitions. After doing this a few times, I am already seeing definition in my legs and I am noticing a difference in how my jeans fit.

This is a great way to get fit and tone without bulking up. Now, I must say that her Dance Cardio that is included in this is much simpler than the ones for her Metamorphosis for adults. I could not follow along with those if I tried (saw them on youtube). I am not a teen and this is the perfect workout for me, and there is no workout schedule, which I find to be good since I can rotate this in with my other workout dvds.

She does not talk at all the workouts, but if you look at the screen every now and then you will pick up on what she is doing quickly, and be able to keep up when she changes positions for a new exercise.

I would highly recommend this for those who do not want to spend lots of money on her other workout dvd Metamorphosis, and for those who want to tone up with high repetitions to avoid bulking up.

5 stars.",1369008000,15,1248,3.960159362549801
5559495,5,B00B5W80OA,I have the mat method which I swear by and I have metamorphosis for grown ups and her dance cardio. It is tremendous. I am seeing lines in my body and I see it changing. I swear and I am just truly loving it. The teen meta is a little easier but it is wonderful. You want your body to change do Tracy anderspn,1368057600,17,309,3.84375
5559496,4,B00B5W80OA,"This comes with four dvds and a purple stretchy ""meta-band."" Disc One has an intro and strength workout 1, Two has strength workout 2, Three has strength workout 3, and Four has cardio one and two. During the strength workouts, Tracy does not talk at all. I feel that if someone is new to Tracy's workouts and new to working out in general, some sort of explanation is needed. Also on the hands and knees leg/butt moves, she usually does 30 reps, which seems to go on forever. And being on your hands and knees that long can bother your wrists. Cardio one is an easier version of the Metamorphosis cardio, lasting 20 minutes and containing a few ""hipper"" moves. There's a bit of jumping involved. Cardio two is simply a breakdown of a dance routine Tracy created using girls from a dance troupe to demonstrate. It looks pretty fun, but I'm not so good at choreography, and I haven't tried it yet. The stretchy ""meta-band"" is used on the strength workouts for the arms and legs. I like the use of the band, but just wonder how long it will last. Overall, I like what I've done so far (cardio 1, strength workouts 1, 2, & 3). This workout seems to really work your butt (because of the stretchy band and the 30 reps). I've found that the Method Mat workout has a great arm series and the Pre-pregnancy workout is great for the abs. I also like that the workouts are only 30 minutes and combined with the cardio, you could be done in under an hour! My only complaint is that it does not seem ""teen"" friendly as it offers little explanation (except for cardio 2), although Tracy seems to smile more, wear brighter clothes, and the background is really colorful. This is not for beginners. If you want to try out Tracy, the Method Mat dvd might be the place to start. Also some of her workouts are posted on YouTube, so you can try them out there before buying. All in all this is a good value, when you compare it to Metamorphosis. *Update* I bought my own stretchy bands. The one that comes with the set sticks to itself and wants to curl up.",1365984000,13,2039,4.368421052631579

8563075,4,B00B5W80OA,"I love Tracy Anderson so I thought I'd purchase this for my daughter.

8563076,4,B00B5W80OA,"Who this product is best for: Those who have done all her other cardio and need a new one.  Those who are well versed in her method and don't need any instruction. And those who can handle movements being quite fast.  Teens or adults should fit into at least one of these if trying this DVD.

The muscle design portion was not for me.  Too fast and my movements were relying on momentum.  I gave this set 4 stars because I bought this mostly wanting a new cardio and one was provided. To that end, I would say it was pretty much worth what I paid ($15).  You get a nice playful cardio that is as good as a regular meta cardio, maybe a little less complicated with the movements.

Good for additional Tracy content for diehard fans but if on a strict budget or deciding between more than one DVD, I'd say pass on this one.  She has much better available.",1437955200,2,853,4.222222222222222

The only reason I bought it was for the band, because I'm doing her continuity and needed it for that. I thought for almost the same price as the band alone on her site I could get an extra workout dvd by buying this, but I just wasted 20 bucks.

8563081,3,B00B5W80OA,"Well, people who reviewed this product and stated that these videos are not just for teens are right. As a mom of a teen, I do these exercises as well. BUT: we all know that Tracy had seen a plastic surgeon about the upped half of her body, and the results of that meeting are popping out of her skimpy tops right and left. It's especially obvious on DVD's #3 and #4. I don't know why she chose such provocative clothing for videos for children, and in my opinion this is just unacceptable and rude. More common sense clothing would have been better. All in all, three stars with a minus.",1411948800,4,588,4.306306306306307
8563082,5,B00B5W80OA,"I was surprised at how challenging this DVD is - I had given up on DVDs long ago because I couldn't really find any that were difficult enough.  The majority seem aimed at beginners to try to get them interested in exercise in a non-scary way.  Well, Tracy changed all that for me!  I purchased the Teen Meta as a less expensive and sort of introductory step into her method.  There are four DVDs - three of increasing levels of muscle training, and a fourth with two cardio routines.  I'm only on the first strength training DVD...the leg/buns work is TOUGH but stick with it - yesterday was my third go and I was so proud to see how quickly I had improved.  The first time I was actually laughing because I had to keep stopping!  The first cardio routine on the fourth DVD is 20 minutes long but if you do it full out, it is a WORKOUT - a lot more jumping than her other Cardio + Dance DVD.  The second cardio routine was a bit of a waste imo, you learn a hip hop dance bit by bit and tbh I don't even know if it gets difficult because I got bored of repeating the same pieces slowly and shut it off.  You are also learning it along with some high school dance team who is there with her, which I found to drag down the quality because they aren't very good, and at least one of them is totally overweight... sorry but I don't find that very inspiring.  Other than that, awesome workouts.",1409616000,4,1390,4.1722846441947565

I thought it would be more energetic if anything - surely younger people are stronger naturally? However, it's more like Tracy simplified and I missed the challenge. I only use the last muscular strength workout because the first two are very easy for me. I was really excited when all the dvds arrived before I realised there was only one workout on each and then I felt a bit cheated. I also find it hard to follow her dance cardio because the camera angles sometimes mean you can't see what her legs are doing. Also, TA is usually amazing for exercising in a tight space but the dance cardio actually uses more space than I have so I can't do it properly which is mildly frustrating. I have since returned to using her youtube channel for a wider variety of workouts at more advanced levels.",1400889600,4,916,4.524096385542169
