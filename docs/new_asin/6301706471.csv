350202,5,6301706471,"First saw these romance 'classics' on TV when channel 7 in NYC showed them after school at 4:30 amidst tons of commercials. After 30 years, it'll be like seeimg them for the first time (and in wide screen!) I do remember Parrish's wonderful music. Wish these were released in blu ray.",1226102400,16,284,4.588235294117647
350203,5,6301706471,"I remember all these films as a kid in the 60's.  I loved them all and had a few of them on video but now it's coming on DVD.  I'm really excited.  All the comments are already made about the films but i'll chat a little about the music by Max Steiner.  This is something that lacks in todays films.  You'll notice that each star will have it's own background music.  Steiner was well known for this and all of his background music is beautiful.  I have the DVD of ""A Summer Place"" and the clean up that they did was great.  I'm sure these four will also be as good as A Summer Place.

I just hope we can get my other favorite ""The Miracle"" starring Carroll Baker and Roger Moore from 1959.  I have this on 35mm and 16mm film but they are starting to fade and getting brittle.  I hope this will be released soon too.",1225843200,7,816,4.069182389937107
350204,5,6301706471,"FINALLY! I thought I was going to pass out when I rec'd an e-mail notification that almost all my favorite films from the 60's were finally coming to DVD, especially since Susan Slade never saw the 'light of day' on VHS. I own the other 3 titles on VHS and have watched them hundreds of times, with great pleasure for an uncomplicated time in our lives. These movies were always shown on Saturday nights when I was a pre-teen. I was shocked each and every time I watched ""Susan Slade"", that this unmarried girl had a baby!!! Boy, oh boy have times changed....my own twenty something children would laugh at me now for my innocent views-  But my enjoyment over bounds with each viewing, so this 4 movie set is like getting a birthday and Christmas gift all rolled into one! Now....if only we could get `A Rage to Live', `Youngblood Hawke', `Summer Love', 'Claudelle Inglish','The Chapman Report' and `My Blood Runs Cold' on DVD my life would be complete! (no, not really but it sounds good) - I am so proud of Warner Brothers for taking a leap of faith that there is still an audience for these fun and classic 60's films! Bravo, Warner Brothers....you did good!",1224806400,114,1161,4.555023923444976
350205,5,6301706471,I have been waiting for years for these movies to be issued on DVD. I saw them all first run and loved them. I only hope that unlike the Gidget collection that these will all be issued in in their original widescreen format.,1223769600,18,224,4.232558139534884
350206,5,6301706471,"This was the first movie I saw when I was a kid. I was almost seven at
the time and it was on a double bill with ""The Sword and The Stone."" My
mum dropped my two sisters and myself off at the Altantic Theater in
Long Beach, California and this movie played first. I can't tell you a
thing about the Disney movie, but I remember just about every scene
from Palm Springs Weekend. The '63 Thunderbird, Bugs Bunny, Stephanie
Powers, Connie Stevens, the pool with the bubbles and the car chase at
the end. Hard to believe, but this film made me want to work in the
movies.

And so I did. I have worked in film and video most of my career and I
always tell people this was the film that first gave me the notion.

During my career I have been fortunate to meet two of the people
involved with this film, Connie Stevens and Earl Hamner Jr (the man who
wrote this film) When I met with Hamner over lunch, it was to talk
about his classic television show The Waltons, but his eyes lit up when I asked him about PSW. He told me several stories and we had a good laugh. A very special memory.

I too would like to see this film released on DVD. It really captures a
time and a generation and that '63 T Bird!",1207267200,,1197,4.042194092827004
350207,5,6301706471,"What a great film. Not as kitchy as the Avalon/Funicello films but lots of fun bits and great characters. Zeme North is just great as the ""plain girl"" Amanda; Jerry Van Dyke is a terrific goof ball, and Robert Conrad plays the bad rich boy with gusto.
The VHS quality is very good and the film is wonderful fun for the whole family -- although my kids can't believe college kids actually wore jackets and ties to a party. Probably the most fun is watching Troy Donahue and Stephanie Powers do their crazy version of the twist. Gotta love this film.",1035504000,9,548,4.435643564356436
350208,5,6301706471,"Often overlooked in the accolades given this film is that it marks the (uncredited) feature film debut of Tina Cole, who later starred in the classic television series ""Hawaiian Eye"", ""My Three Sons"", ""John Davidson's Kraft Summer Music Hall"" and ""The King Family Show.""
Tina's unforgettable potrayal of the betrayed ""good girl"" Ruth Stewart captures the entire spectrum of teenage angst. Her brief time on the screeen portends a film future which other stars can only hope to emulate.",1009152000,6,485,5.151898734177215
350209,5,6301706471,"This film is great teenage fun and fun for the whole family. It's all about a group of college kids and other adolescents all converging on a  resort town during Spring break thanks to Director Norman Taurog,  Screenwriter Earl Hamner Jr. and a solid cast.
This was another Warner  Brothers vehicle for Troy Donahue, who had just completed four quality  productions with director Delmar Daves. This is not a bad film and is quite  fun to watch. Troy even sings the title song behind the credits! It is  chockfull of character actors and many television veterans from the 60s all  the way up through the 90s. See if you can pick them out. They were all  pretty young!
Troy Donahue also appeared on TV in ""Surfside 6""  and ""Hawaiian Eye."" Troy Donahue, born Merle Johnson, Jr. studied  journalism at Columbia University and began appearing in stock productions.  He entered into films with Universal and Warner Brothers.
 Thanks, Troy  Donahue! The good-times cast includes Connie Stevens, Robert Conrad, Ty  Hardin, Stefanie Powers, Andrew Duggan, Jack Weston, Jerry Van Dyke, Billy  Mumy and Carole Cook. Don't forget Troy!
This is one of the best VHS  prints I have ever seen. It is excellent.",967593600,17,1194,4.865671641791045

350773,5,6301706471,"He was all the rage in his time (late 50's - early 60's) The tall, blue eyed blond surfer boy every girl wanted.  His leading ladies ranged from Sandra Dee. ""A Summer Place"" one of fans all time favorites! (Not on this disk) , Susanne Pleshett,  who he had a brief marriage too,  - ""A Distant Drum""(Not on this disk) and ""Rome Adventure"",  Connie Stephens who played opposite him in ""Parrish"" and ""Susan Slade"", and Stephanie Powers, ""Palm Springs Weekend"".

Two movies, Parish and Susan Slade, are directed by veteran film maker,  Delmer Davies.  Despite the hallmark  theme of these movies ""good boy""  gets caught in web of love and deceit with wordily young women, the films attracted very good actors like Richard Eagan, Dorothy McGuire, Arthur Kennedy, Claudette Colbert, Karl Malden, Dean Jagger, Beulah Bondi, Lloyd Nolan, Ty Hardin, Robert Conrad, and Jack Weston to name a few.  While the first two movies deal with love, premarital sex and pregnancy. The third movie, ""Palm  Springs Weekend""  is a lighthearted romp with college basketball players coming to town for spring break.  Chaos ensues and of course Donahue falls in love with Stephanie Powers despite the nickname of ""Bunny"".  Connie Stevens is on board this time playing a barely 16 babysitter pretending to be on break from the University of Hawaii.  She attracts bad boy Robert Conrad with Ty Hardin the upstanding cowboy coming to the rescue and knocking tough boy Conrad around.  Of course ""bunny's"" chief of police father, played by Andrew Duggan,  throws in some good laughs.",1439078400,4,1552,4.953488372093023

351059,5,6301706471,"PALM SPRINGS WEEKEND a very popular Troy Donahue film and is great teenage fun and fun for the whole family. It's all about a group of college kids and other adolescents all converging on a resort town during Spring break thanks to Director Norman Taurog, Screenwriter Earl Hamner Jr. and a solid cast. This was another Warner Brothers vehicle for Troy Donahue, who had just completed four quality productions with director Delmar Daves. This is not a bad film and is quite fun to watch. Troy even sings the title song behind the credits! It is chock full of character actors and many television veterans from the 60s all the way up through the 90s. See if you can pick them out. They were all pretty young! Troy Donahue also appeared on TV in ""Surfside 6"" and ""Hawaiian Eye."" Troy Donahue, born Merle Johnson, Jr. studied journalism at Columbia University and began appearing in stock productions. He entered into films with Universal and Warner Brothers. Thanks, Troy Donahue! The good-times cast includes Connie Stevens, Robert Conrad, Ty Hardin, Stefanie Powers, Andrew Duggan, Jack Weston, Jerry Van Dyke, Billy Mumy and Carole Cook. Don't forget Troy! This is one of the best DVD prints I have ever seen of PALM SPRINGS WEEKEND.

PARRISH is the second film that teamed director Delmer Daves and teen idol Troy Donahue. Despite its notoriously poor reviews, this is a very good film in the context of the soap opera genre and extends beyond many inherent bounds of that genre for its sheer entertainment. This is good filmmaking. Delmer Daves was the consummate professional, being a meticulous craftsman. His films were beautifully photographed; many times employing difficult crane shots to incorporate the characters into their environment from which he contrasted their own conflicts. This film is no exception as it deals with the struggle for control over Connecticut's tobacco farming industry. The main antagonist is the all-powerful Judd Raike (Karl Malden) who intends to buy out the entire valley. His main nemesis is the noble Sala Post (Dean Jagger) who stands for uncompromising integrity. Parrish MacLean (Troy Donahue) and his mother, Ellen (Claudette Colbert) arrive in tobacco country from Boston and become involved in the conflict. Along the way Donahue finds three love interests: Connie Stevens, Diane McBain and Sharon Hugueny. Critics at the time criticized Malden's maniacal performance, but in light of today's cutthroat business tactics it seems right on target. However, I always best admired Jagger's mild but dignified performance. Much of the location photography was filmed in Connecticut (the Sala Post house in Middlefield, the Charles W. Morgan whaling ship at Mystic Seaport, the Connecticut River ferryboat photographed from Gillette's Castle, the Congregational Church in Essex for wedding scenes, the Tara Mare Resort Hotel and Marina at Saybrook Point, the United States Navy submarine base at Groton and Tobacco Fields and Sheds in Hartford County were all featured). Having lived in Connecticut all my life, I can really appreciate the authenticity and craftsmanship that was put into this film. It is a beautiful film very much enhanced by Max Steiner's evocative young-at-heart score. They don't make them like this anymore. This film was based on the novel by Connecticut's own Mildred Savage. I highly recommend this motion picture.

ROME ADVENTURE has a strong cast, a good story and beautiful locations exquisitely filmed in Italy. Esthetically, ROME ADVENTURE breaks away from the mold of A SUMMER PLACE, PARRISH and SUSAN SLADE also directed by Delmar Daves personally for Troy Donahue. I wanted to say something more about ROME ADVENTURE because it deserves more. I recall the day hearing the news of Troy Donahue's passing. Daves definitely saw something Troy Donahue that the critics didn't. But there are a lot of us out there who also saw what director Daves saw. Troy Donahue represented that slightly shy, slightly naive brooding All-American youth that somehow outlived his usefulness on the screen many years ago. You had your day in the sun however short-lived that time was. Yet Troy Donahue brought many of us happiness and a hope for the future. You thrived at a time that was so fleeting that one wonders if it ever really existed. This film is the proof that those times did really once exist. ROME ADVENTURE's images hold perhaps your best performance. Troy Donahue held his ground convincingly in scenes with the virile Rossano Brazzi. Troy Donahue looked like the worldly traveler as you toured Italy with Suzanne Pleshette. You looked like the seasoned lover in your scenes with Angie Dickinson. Troy Donahue did it all in a way that no one else could. My daughter was only 6 or 7 years old in 1993 but you were the first movie star that she ever took notice of and liked. I always found that amazing and that is a memory that nobody can take away. In our household Troy Donahue was not a heartthrob. He was a bonafide actor and real person. ROME ADVENTURE may be his best film. When I think of Emilio Pericoli singing the wonderful song ""Al Di L&agrave;"" in this film, I think of a wonderful time of life.

SUSAN SLADE has been long awaited and I am glad it is included here. You really have to put yourself back in time to that time when this film was made and released. This was the way it was then. There is heartbreaking sentimentality to be found here and yet hope is never lost. This is not truly a love story, but a film about love lost and the capacity to find love again. SUSAN SLADE was director Delmer Daves' third picture with Troy Donahue, yet Connie Stevens playing Susan Slade is the main character here. Fine performances by Lloyd Nolan, Dorothy McGuire and Brian Aherne along with Lucien Ballard's beautiful cinematography and Max Steiner's score are highlights. The print of SUSAN SLADE is excellent.",1414627200,6,5893,4.968591691995948

I imagine that put a damper on the ticket sales that might have been expected during Thanksgiving holiday weekend. I may have seen this movie on our black and white TV, but I don't remember ever seeing it until two years ago.
  This movie brought back memories of of how pretty the women used to dress and the beautiful up-do hairstyles. My mom went to beauty school in 1967 and practiced some of those styles on me and her mother. I have always been a Connie Stevens and Robert Conrad fan. I have read comments how people hate Connie Stevens, instead of hating the role she played. Her role was sort of a golddigger, but she is young and learns her lesson. I recently heard Robert Conrad (He has a Thurs night radio show on CRN.com) tell how he met Connie when she was 19 and how they have remained great friends all these years. The other famous actors in the movie gave it a  more pizazz than the other movie it is compared to, ""Where the Boys Are.""  It was also fun to see some of the record albums on the shelf at the record shop because we had them in our home. Some viewers don't like the silly antics, but remember that going to the drive-in with the whole family was very popular as a cheap night, out sans babysitter fees. I think this movie had appeal for all ages.
  So, while not an Oscar quality film, it does bring back some good memories. Too bad our culture has degraded so much since then and we can't turn back the clock.",1406160000,2,1558,4.264406779661017

351206,5,6301706471,"I bought this for Susan Slade, one of my favorite films, but having Parrish, Roman Adventure and Palm Springs Weekend was a bonus. I think they ought to have included another film directed by Delmer Daves, instead of Palm Springs, which at least has both Connie Stevens and Troy Donahue. Some suggest that ""A Summer Place"" ought to be here, but I think it is not, because the selling point for this set is that none of the four titles in this set are available anywhere else, they are exclusive to this set.
I really appreciate Troy Donahue's acting. People should never put him down, he really emoted in these. He is very modest, saying that he was only good as his material.  Pease! I have seen terrible performances by people with good material. He was really good! Plus he is cute!

The only one of the films without Connie Stevens is Roman Adventure, for that we have Suzanne Pleshette, who married Donahue two years after they made the film. I am still I the middle of that one, but I saw it years ago.

People put down Susan Slade as corny or whatever, but it was good. I felt compelled to watch it over and over, and not just because my then-favorite, Bert Convy had a part in it (Wells Corbett). I loved the clothes, the scenery and even the storyline (my sister had a baby out of wedlock, and that was no small thing). People put down the premise, but Bobby Darin and Jack Nicholson went through similar experiences (spoiler -- being raised by their grandmothers). My sister was so upset, watching this, that she went into a teary fit, angry because our folks didn't support her, and her baby ended up dead, because she had moved out of town to a bad apartment house.

The music, the scenery, even the plots are very nostalgic.  He seemed like a decent fellow, unlike many of the so called stars today.  A terrific way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

351526,4,6301706471,"When I realized these beloved films were available in a boxed set, Zing went the strings of my heart! First, because I was a teen in the sixties and fell in love with the principal players...add to that some super steamy storylines, and you have a combo sure to excite! Palm Springs week-end is by far the 'tamest' of these offerings, a sweet and humorous following of college kids bound to find love or lust, whichever finds them first, on spring break. Rome Adventure follows Prudence Bell (Suzanne Pleshette) as she walks away from her teaching position at a stuffy girls' school, to find romance in Rome. She does, and his name is Troy Donahue! Wow, the sparks fly until sexy and needy Angie Dickenson attempts to douse them with her tears! The script, and the beautiful soundtrack make this a purely enjoyable film. Parrish has the unique pleasure of having Claudette Colbert in a leading role. There were few films privy to her acting skills in the sixties. She had much more to offer in her later years but few directors had cast her in roles befitting her class and dignity...till this sleeper of a film in which she plays Parrish's (played by Troy Donahue) mother. Well acted, beautiful cinematography, a wonderful story line with every imaginable angle from rich boy (Troy), rich girl (Diane McBain), poor girl (Connie Stevens)...love returned, love spurned. Not a dull moment here! Susan Slade was one of Connie Steven's best films in which she plays a girl searching for love in most of the wrong places, and determined to live above the poverty that envelopes her world. Stevens has a unique quality at once being a temptress while retaining her demure charm. Not an easy sell, but she does it to perfection, making us love her while at the same time want to chastise her for her bad behavior. Seeing these films again made me feel as though I was sitting in an old neighborhood theatre, kleenex in one hand, popcorn in the other and oh so glad to be sixteen!

Unfortunately they have been released by different movie production companies, so that's probably why they cannot get released on one DVD set.

My parents would not permit me to see his movies, thinking that they were too racy for my age, and I would have to rely on reports about the movies from my friends.  I felt very hard done by, and always felt that I was missing out.  After seeing the movies in this collection, the only one I really love is ""Rome Adventure"".  That film is worth the price of the entire collection. It makes it even more fun to watch knowing that Suzanne Pleshette and Donahue were romantically involved at the time. Overall, I give the collection two stars.

What a dog, neither the established players, nor the young up and coming actors could save this project. The other issue of course was that this film was not a Daves vehicle either.

In short, the earlier ""From The Terrace"" should have been included, as it was the beginning venture in the first place. Palm Springs Weekend will certainly be sold to the highest bidder.",1245024000,,593,4.803921568627451

I was eight years old when I watched it and always wanted to have a dvd version of it. A beautiful picture!
""PALM SPRINGS WEEKEND"" is purely early sixties and delightful to watch. Robert Conrad, Ty Hardin, Stefanie Powers, Connie Stevens and Troy Donahue are at their best. Get the popcorn and have fun!
The other two movies are new to me, but great too, specially ""SUSAN SLADE"". This one is pure drama with the morals (a bit dated now)of the time. I enjoyed watching GRANT WILLIAMS an underrated actor that I discovered watching ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" a few weeks ago. He does a great job as Susan's first love.

No,this film from Warner Brothers isn't great art but it's a lot of fun. A number of Warner Bros. contract players including Robert Conrad,Troy Donahue,Ty Hardin and Connie Stevens appear in this film as well as a young Stephanie Powers and Jerry Van Dyke. The 1963 film made during the peak of the beach movie cycle follows the misadventures of a group of college students who descend on Palms Springs for a weekend during spring break. A lot of the characters and situations are standard cliches,but this doesn't stop this film from being fun.

352078,4,6301706471,"I must say that the four stars rating is due mainly to the magnificent Max Steiner soundtrack, more than the films' qualities.
Warner certainly did an excellent job of remastering and the video quality is excellent, with the original colours back to life and the original widescreen format preserved. The sound is also very good and the music, which SAE re-edited recently on two magnificent CDs I warmly recommend to any enthusiast, is among Steiner's best, and that means simply marvelous.
He wrote those, after the galactic hit of ""A Summer Place"", which had rejuvenated the almost forgotten, great, ailing musician, with an incredibly youthful and fresh spirit.

The only criticism I can offer regards the lack of chapters on the menu, but that is a minor fault, even if very annoying, if you look for a particular scene. Probably it'd have added to the price?

I'm fond of these movies since I've seen them in my teen years, and at the time, in my simplicity, I liked them very much, for the beauty of the girls, for the sentiments depicted, love, pride, honour, honesty, freedom, etc.and like I said, for the music.
Now I find them rather quaint, even if pleasingly old-fashioned, but in some cases plainly boring; all in all, for the price, they can be a nice addition to a serious movies' aficionado.
But remember to throw away Palm Springs Weekend as soon as you open the box..! It's simply awful, trying to be a copy of the Funicello-Avalon's or Connie Francis' beach/holiday movies!",1236038400,4,1493,4.80544747081712

352217,4,6301706471,"The stand out film in this Romance Classics Collection from Warner Brothers is ""Rome Adventure"" the only film that one might consider a classic among the bunch.  With a star making performance in her first film Suzanne Pleshette commands the screen and makes the film all hers. She is both engaging as an actress and a timeless beauty as well and proves she was a star who should have been bigger. Perhaps her resemblance to Elizabeth Taylor hindered her value at the studio, who knows?  Her equally beautiful co-star not Troy Donohue but the city of Rome.  Rarely has the city been more gorgeously photographed and here it is indeed presented as lovingly by the cinematographer Charles Lawton Jr. as he presents us with Miss Pleshette.
  In a stand out performance Angie Dickenson nearly steels the picture as a wicked temptress. She is a joy to watch and a real guilty pleasure to boot as she vamps her way across most of Italy and half of Europe.

Delmar Davies directed the film (as he did ""Parish"" and ""Susan Slade"") with flair and his trademark penchant for the melodramatic. ""Rome Adventure"" is the best of the lot in this collection. The rest of the films vary from overcooked melodrama to silly camp teen comedy.

""Susan Slade"" comes in second place with a first rate cast of veterans and young stars of the time. The wonderful surprise here as in ""Perrish"" is that Connie Stevens is such a fine actress. She shines as an innocent sheltered girl forced to grow up fast in a world of very narrow and strict mores.  It is also a visual treat to see San Francisco, Carmel, and Monterey in the early 1960's shot so memorably in all their glory..

  In ""Perrish"" Connie is a Real Bad Girl and she brings a touch of class, defiant pride and honor to the role that one would not expect from her. The other plus in this long tale of tobacco plantations in Connecticut is the last screen appearance of Claudette Colbert. It is just a treat to watch her in action with all her signature gestures and ""Shoot my face from the left side only"" moves that made her a star and so good at playing wise strong mothers.

  ""Palm Springs Weekend"" weighs in as a campy lightweight ""Where The Boys Are"" where all the ""teens"" are played by actors nearing thirty. This film is a silly throwaway that is the perfect vehicle for the decidedly doughy and charmless Troy Donahue.  This collection should really be called The Troy Donahue Collection since he stars in all for epics. In sad fact the films suffer for his presence.  ""Parrish"", ""Susan Slade"", and ""Rome Adventure"" would have been much better with a lead that could act. I found myself pining for the films to rise from under his dead weight. Tab Hunter was truly missed.

The prints are good and the sound quality fine on all four films. So this collection is for die-hard Donahue fans and worth buying for ""Rome Adventure"" above all the rest.",1233705600,7,2887,4.574757281553398

352219,4,6301706471,"Any time I see the name Troy Donohue, my mind automatically goes back to the time I was growing up in the late 1950s and early '60s, a great time with wonderful memories.
I saw ""Palm Springs Weekend"" at the RKO Albee a beautiful golden-age  theater in downtown Brooklyn, New York.  The film  holds many pleasant memories and is an all-around enjoyable experience. I even own the soundtrack album with Troy singing ""Live Young.""  About ten years ago, I sent Troy some lobby cards, from some of his films, to his home in California.  I got them back signed in less than a week.
I can't wait to get this set.  Now if only we could get Warner Bros. to release some of their classic series from the late '50s/early '60s, including the ones Donohue starred in: ""Hawaiian Eye"" and, especially, ""SurfSide 6,"" one of my all-time favorites. I also wouldn't mind seeing them release Troy's large-scale western ""A Distant Trumpet,"" as well.",1233360000,23,928,4.662576687116564

When the movies were first released in the theaters I was between 13 and 16 years old and madly in love with Troy Donahue. I had his pictures plastered all over my bedroom walls. At the time I didn't know there other actors in the movies! I was too busy looking at Troy. The movies are beautifully done. Old fashioned love stories with beautiful music and scenery. Except for Palm Springs Weekend which is a light weight comedy. (Jerry Van Dyke stole the movie)Troy even sings the title song! Not a great singer, but who cares, he's Troy Donahue.
I highly recommend these movies as well as A Summer Place to anyone who loves loves stories the way they are meant to be. After seeing these movies I'm a teenager again madly in love with Troy Donahue.",1233273600,10,866,4.703947368421052
352221,5,6301706471,"My review goes for ROME ADVENTURE alone, I love this movie, and was able to treat myself with a copy, in Brazil, ROME ADVENTURE is presently being sold separately (not a boxed set).

The movie is fantastic, having enduring more than 4 decades, what proves its qualities, the picture quality is ok, however, the sound is not good, as a matter of fact, it's awful, since it only has the original mono track. We've waited for so long for this to come out on DVD that I think we, fans, deserved better treatment. It could contain the original mono audio track, for purists, but why not include some remastered DD 5.1 or even DTS to enhance the magnificent score by Max Steiner's? Wonder how great it would be to hear AL DI LA, sung by Emilio Pericolli, in glorious DTS 5.1? Maybe in a near-future Special Edition, with 2 discs, containing all the extras that this edition lacks, with remastered audio and video quality. Perhaps even better, why not release this title in glorious Blu Ray, with uncompressed audio? This is the kind of picture that will look simply stunning in HD, with a compatible excellent audio score, I just look forward to adding this title on BD to my collection. Anyway, meanwhile, let's give some money to the studios, they may be needing it after all, because tey will surely release a better edition some time in the future, making us double dip once more. But I strongly reccomend this title while we are deprived to see a film like this in all its glory, this copy should do well enough, after all, as I said, the video quality is not that bad, of course it's no HD, but as fas as the sound concerns, they surely could have made an extensively better job than this.

352222,5,6301706471,"I received the Romance Classics set today and here are my impressions of the video quality.  First of all, fear not. All the films are 16x9 widescreen and anamorphic video(enhanced for widescreen TVs).  Parrish, Susan Slade, and Rome Adventure are all dual-layer DVDs, with the shorter Palm Springs Weekend being a single layer disc.  I would rate them in order of video quality as:
1. Susan Slade
2. Palm Springs Weekend
3. Rome Adventure
4. Parrish
Susan Slade was never on VHS or laserdisc and appears to be a new, modern transfer.  It is very sharp and clean with great colors.  Palm Springs Weekend was on VHS and laserdisc and is clean with nice color, but somewhat softer than Susan Slade.  Rome Adventure and Parrish (my favorite film of the four) appear to me to be from the old mid-1990s masters for VHS and laserdisc.  While they look good, they have a slight layer of video grain and some softness.  The skintones on Rome Adventure are a bit reddish for my tastes but not too bad. The sound on all the films is mono and okay.
  I wish all the films had been remastered up to the quality of Susan Slade, but it is great to have them on DVD and for a great price.",1233014400,67,1173,4.413953488372093

At long last, Mr. Donahue's career and legacy are being honored in what I consider some of his most famous films--Parrish, Susan Slade, Rome Adventure, and Palm Springs Weekend. (Somehwere in between, he also appeared in My Blood Runs Cold and A Distant Trumpet).

A bit of Trivia---Carroll O'Connor has a bit part (and I mean 'bit' part) in Parrish; Palm Springs Weekend was written by Earl Hamner, Jr., who, as you all know, went on to development a little gem called 'The Waltons'.",1230595200,36,558,4.802083333333333

For me, the ultimate of romantic scenes in film history was their stopover in a dimly lit cafe, the Italian singer Emilio Percoli singing what became a monster hit, ""Al Di La"".
