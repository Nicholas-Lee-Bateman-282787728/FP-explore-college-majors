8273946,5,630441742X,"This set includes six videos, each featuring a one-hour interview with a leading scientist.  I found the interview format extremely refreshing versus the ""infotainment"" style science shows on TV today.  You won't get flashy graphics or commercial-break cliff-hangers. What you do get is a solid hour of good conversation with six thought leaders in fascinating fields of study that are as relevant today as they were ten years ago.  Topics include oceanography, astronomy, evolution, dinosaurs, viruses, and artificial intelligence.  I learned something from every installment, and came away inspired by the breadth of human intellect and excited by what is yet to be discovered in our world.",1207353600,2,692,5.4392523364485985
