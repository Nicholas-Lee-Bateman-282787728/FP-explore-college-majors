Miss Violence begins with a suicide, and you spend most of the next 98 minutes trying to figure out exactly why it happened and what transpires behind closed doors. I'll admit that in the first half hour or so I was struggling to grasp just how much of the family's behavior was not beyond the pale, since it's a foreign film and I have very little idea of what would be considered conventional in the contemporary life of a Greek family with a socioeconomic standing like the one portrayed. You do get a sense, simply as a human being, that something is very wrong beyond the kind of despair you'd expect in a family suffering the loss of a child.

The acting is as good as it gets; the child actors in Miss Violence surpass what Hollywood gives us, with perhaps only a few exceptions like Dakota Fanning. The cinematography isn't mind-blowing, but it is nonetheless very well done. Be warned: The story destroys a little piece of your soul. There's a fleeting moment of catharsis at film's end, but the fates of the characters are still hanging in the balance when the closing credits roll. Again, think carefully before watching Miss Violence: there are some things you cannot unsee.",1449273600,,1264,4.629464285714286
8657151,5,B00KB1RSLM,"The film opens with a scene of apparent family joy, the birthday of a girl - Angeliki - who has just turned eleven. While the family take happy snaps on a Polaroid, she jumps from their balcony to her death. The authorities come calling to find out what caused her to do such a thing, but the family seem to unite in a conspiracy of silence, and claim that all is right with the world - it was just an accident.

As the scenes unfold it becomes clear that the surface appearances are a thin veneer for what is really going on. The father is also grandfather but mainly a controlling Martinet who rules with a calm voice and an angry violent streak. The slow reveal gets increasingly shocking and some will find deeply upsetting.

This is a million miles from being a `feel good' film. It deals with themes that many people will find uncomfortable and disturbing, this is both physical and emotional cruelty as well as much more besides. The authorities do not come out of this looking too good either - sadly it is all very believable. Winner of best director (Alexandros Avranas) and best film at the Venice film festival, this is superbly directed and acted, it also has good sub titles, but due to the nature of the film itself is one that is hard to say you `loved'. It was a disturbing, unsettling and moving piece of cinema - and yes I found it a difficult watch. However, I still found it to be a rewarding , if challenging, watch and for that reason I feel able to recommend this with the caveats regarding plot as mentioned above.",1446249600,2,1539,4.415492957746479
