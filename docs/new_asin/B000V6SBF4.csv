8580664,5,B000V6SBF4,"Absolutely no problems with ordering and delivery. We found ""Dragon"" on the Qubo channel, after cutting cable it is the only children's channel we get. Luckily we love the programming. Dragon was on weekends at 7am and I finally tired of never sleeping in and had the bright of idea of hunting for Dragon on DVD (or streaming) - 2 DVDs on Amazon was ALL that I could find! This Claymation show is wonderful, my toddler loves it. The friends are fun too, characters all very individual; the surfer Alligator, the country Beaver, mail Mouse & Ostrich. The narration voice is calm and steady and pleasing to listen to, the music is delightful. I enjoy these programs that do not bombard my child with flashy fast activity and loud characters. I'd love to find the books! Maybe on a Canadian site?",1327363200,,793,4.631205673758865
8580665,5,B000V6SBF4,This is a very fun series.  My Kids love it and it is fun for the whole family - very well done.  I'm very glad to have found at least a few episodes on DVD as we were very disappointed when our local broadcasters dropped the show from the Saturday morning line-up.  Please please please release more!,1285372800,2,301,4.245614035087719
