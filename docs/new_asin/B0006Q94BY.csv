2191517,3,B0006Q94BY,"Pretty good.  In addition to the post-season and Superbowl recaps, the DVD also features highlights from all the regular season games.  And one of the bonus features is the Superbowl game itself (edited for huddles, timeouts, etc. but keeping in significant replay videos and the like).  Now, I find these DVDs are always short on some things; it's hard to please regular fans, especially those of the Superbowl winner.  But this offering has its place, especially with Pats fans.  They will find it entertaining and worth the price.",1129075200,,533,5.011363636363637
2191518,5,B0006Q94BY,"With the recent stain on Superbowl Halftime Shows, this DVD not only highlights the NFL at its best in game coverage, but it also demonstrations the NFL's renewed policy for providing family oriented programming.  I bought this DVD for the McCartney halftime show, but was pleasantly surprised with all the coverage of the New England Patriots football season up to and including the entire Super Bowl XXXIX game.  Good job NFL!",1122508800,2,428,5.014084507042254
2191519,4,B0006Q94BY,"I will never forget that idiot receiver on the Rams who declared prior to their Super Bowl v the Patriots (the Pats' first championship) ""tonight a dynasty is born.""  He was of course referring to his own Rams who were going for their 2nd/3rd championship.  Little did he know how right he was, but he was talking about the wrong team.  That night a dynasty was born as the Pats (not the Rams) won 3 of the next 4.

This DVD is just the most recent chapter in the dynasty.  Recommended for any Pats fan.",1122422400,3,503,4.252631578947368
2191520,3,B0006Q94BY,"It's funny, this DVD feels just like the 2004 season -- ""Yawn, just another Super Bowl for the Patriots!!""

Well, I am a HUGE Patriots fan, but even the recap on the disc and the whole DVD has that feel where it's kind of just run of the mill now that the Patriots win all the time.  If you are a Patriots fan you will enjoy watching the good guys run to their 3rd title, but you won't get the goosebumps that you do when you pop the Super Bowl XXXVI DVD in (albeit it's much shorter).  The special features get better every year, but I didn't enjoy this DVD as much as the 2001 and 2003 editions, but it's still worth the price of admission.

*** RECOMMENDED",1118275200,5,659,4.125
2191521,4,B0006Q94BY,"This New England Patriots Super Bowl XXXIX video is simply a must have for New England Patriots fans, despite some of its drawbacks.

This video is essentially an hour-long highlights reel of the New England Patriot's 2004 season.  It has highlights of each and every regular season and playoff game, and of course a more detailed highlights package of the Super Bowl itself.  The video is interspersed with sound bites from player and coach interviews and the sidelines throughout the season.

The video does not do a great job of building drama throughout the regular season and the playoffs.  But of course, there wasn't all that much drama given New England only lost two games and went 14-2.  It does, however, do a decent job spotlighting the impact of the regular season loss to Pittsburgh and the mounting injuries to the team's defensive backs.  It also does a good job of profiling Cory Dillon's impact on the Patriot's running game during the regular season and playoffs and gives Troy Brown's defensive back play some much deserved airtime.  Like last year, I wish the video had more highlights, more commentary, and more inside information.  But overall, it was a mostly complete package.

The best part of the DVD was it has the entire international game broadcast on it.  It is awesome to have the entire game on DVD as a keepsake, even though I also taped it on VHS.  This year the announcers for that broadcast were Dick Stockton and Darryl Johnston, who I thought were excellent.  It is without commercials, of course, and includes key statistics during the game and shots of fans and replays.  It's a surprising well-edited film of the game given the speed with which the DVD was produced.

The other special features included a number of pre and post game interviews with New England players and coaches, which were interesting but short.  It also included the entire halftime show with Paul McCartney, which for me I could have cared less about but it will no doubt appeal to many others.  I wonder why last year's DVD didn't include the halftime show?  (Ha! Ha!)

I was very disappointed that the DVD did not include the ESPN NFL Match-Up analyzing the Super Bowl, which is really a fabulous breakdown of the game.  That was a really big plus for last year's Super Bowl XXXVIII DVD.  But of course, this year's Super Bowl was on Fox so they aren't going to allow promotion of another network's program.

Despite my quibbles with some aspects of the DVD, if you are a New England Patriots fan you will no doubt enjoy this more than once.  I don't think non-New England Patriots fans would like the DVD that much because it is essentially a highlights reel of the Patriot's season and does not do any in-depth breakdown of the game or season that an avid football fan would be looking for.",1110499200,41,2809,4.699386503067485

2191592,4,B0006Q94BY,"I got this DVD as one of my Dad's birthday gift. It was the off-season and we are both huge Patriots fans anxiously awaiting the pre-season. I came over for the party and we sat down with a pizza and watched Tom Brady lead the Patriots to another superbowl, what's could be better? The DVD itself is basically an hour or so long narrated overview of the season with the top highlights and a bit of history on the players and team mixed in. This part is entertaining but I was pretty disappointed it didn't have the actual playoff games like I thought. The only full game it has is the Superbowl broadcast.

One important thing to note is, the Superbowl is considered an extra feature. My father and I were extremely disappointed at first because we thought the Superbowl broadcast wasn't on here. I tried looking in the bonus features and there it was. Kind of strange, but oh well.",1396569600,8,882,4.478260869565218

2191600,4,B0006Q94BY,"By winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of New Englanders wins its first World Series in 86 years.

It's true, the Patriots somehow pieced together a team that, despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as Super Bowl champions with a 17-2 record (which just as easily could have/should have been 18-1)...but the 2004 Boston Red Sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the American Sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 Patriots season just doesn't seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003.  Part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities (2001 having 9/11, the coming-of-age of Tom Brady, the Snow Bowl, and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting Super Bowl ever.  2003 had the release of Lawyer Milloy, the early stumbles to Buffalo and Washington, the birth of the winning streak, winter weather in Foxboro, and yet another thrilling Super Bowl finish); 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison, like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the ""W"" on the Patriots' side of the field.

This is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling...the injuries (leading to the incredible ""throwback"" two-way play of veteran Wide Receiver/rookie Cornerback Troy Brown), the continued winning streak, the rebirth of offseason acquisition Corey Dillon, the continuing mastery of the Indianapolis Colts, and the return to Pittsburgh (where the record 21-game winning streak came to an emphatic end on Halloween (just days after the Red Sox won the World Series, karmically enough), where University of Michigan graduate Tom Brady resurrected himself from a triple-digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the NFL to send the Patriots back to the Super Bowl, this time in the unfairly maligned city of Jacksonville, FL.

No nail-biting endings this time, though...despite the best efforts of Terrell Owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else (with the possible exception of Curt Schilling, of course), the Eagles All-Pro was clearly the second-best receiver on the field as Deion Branch won the Super Bowl MVP for a record day (Safetyman and Render Of Mayhem Extraordinaire Rodney Harrison would have been my pick, actually) and the Patriots, though trailing early, never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24-21 which in truth flattered the Eagles more than they deserved.

Far be it that a season ending with a record of 17-2 and another Super Bowl ring should be considered hum-drum, but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that, impressive as it was, just doesn't translate to the memorable re-telling that the Pats' previous title years do.  This is a great DVD for Pats fans, indispensible even, but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good NFL season can bring, I would recommend either of the previous Patriots highlights DVD's over this one.",1130025600,3,3272,4.992660550458716
