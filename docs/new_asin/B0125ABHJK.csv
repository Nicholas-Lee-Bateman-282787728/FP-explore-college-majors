8725393,4,B0125ABHJK,"This film depicts an Arab youth in Israel, who gets accepted into a prestigious school. He begins to make friends, falls in love, and works taking care of a young man his own age who suffers from a progressive disease, all of whom are Israeli Jewish. He lives between two worlds:  That of his Muslim family, who feel deep ambivalence about being citizens of Isarel, while attending a school whose attendees and staff treat him, at best, as a good friend or student individually, or at worst, as a contemptible member of an undesirable group. Welcome to life as an ""underrepresented minority"".  Life throws different circumstances at those in his world and at him, sometimes causing painful losses. He emerges resilient, but the cost to him is a constant level of alienation to so,e degree from those around him. The movie is nicely nuanced and very watchable. Highly recommend it for those interested in identity films.",1473552000,4,919,4.884615384615385

8725395,5,B0125ABHJK,"Surprisingly beautiful little film.  Relates to anyone, any time, any where, though I saw it at a Jewish film festival.  Very important to see how divisions in society play out in day to day life - between totally innocent young people.  Loved this film and recommended it to a lot of people.  Well acted, well written, I highly recommend.  (And I don't recommend a lot of films!)",1459209600,2,380,4.611940298507463

8725397,5,B0125ABHJK,"This is an excellent movie. While the press played up the Romeo  and Juliet aspect of the film, it is most effective in demonstrating the poor choices that Israel and the Palestinian's have made over the years.  Most dramatic is the portrayal of the Arab-Israel's need to adapt a Jewish identity in order to succeed in his country.  The movie accomplishes this with a tremendously appealing script and performances.  It is unfortunate this film did not get a wider viewing as nobody can really argue with the tone or goal of the movie.  It is a collaboration of a Jewish film maker and an Arab-Israeli writer.",1450569600,,609,4.7075471698113205
8725398,5,B0125ABHJK,"This is an amazing film.  It concerns a young Arab-Israeli boy who earns admission to an elite Jewish prep school, thus fulfilling the dream of his father who had been made to drop out due to his political activities.  There he faces the problems of fitting in with the other students even having to sit through lectures that put the Arabs in a bad light,  As part of the school's community service program he meets a Jewish student with muscular dystrophy and that relationship changes both of them.  He falls in love with a Jewish girl and that relationship changes both of them.  How all of this works out is told in such a sensitive way that we totally believe these characters and are drawn into their lives.  The lead actor is wonderful.  The whole cast is first rate.  The story is amaxing.  I highly recommend this film.  I've never heard of this director before but now I will search out his other work.",1446940800,3,912,4.5060975609756095
8725399,5,B0125ABHJK,"Riklis gets better and better. This is a magnificent film, in particular, Tawfeek Barhom. This is a must see movie.",1446163200,,115,4.8

One of the nice surprises in 2013 was finding the DVD release of the film Zaytoun  which I reviewed here on Amazon. When the advance screener of this film arrived, I noted that this was the same Director, Eran Riklis. Further research shows that Riklis is one of Israels most acclaimed director, producer and writer and has directed close to a dozen films (which Ill now seek out!).

The main character is an Arab who, I won't tell you why, ends up in an Israeli boarding school, and how he balances his religious and cultural personality with being in a different place. Thats all Im revealing.
The dialog in the film is in Hebrew and Arabic with English Subtitles in nice clear easy to read typeface (a rarity these days). There is one expletive (the F-word said once) but the English subtitle uses the words making love). Though the film is not rated I feel it necessary to tell you that there are two instances of what I feel are gratuitous female nudity. (The scenes would have been better presented it the nudity was implied.) I do not  by any mean  get offended by nudity, I just think that the inclusion may stop some parents from having their teen age children see this film. And I do recommend it for anyone who has an interest in Israeli/Palestinian conflicts.

I also liked the music score and closing song which, incidently were composed by the Directors son (?) Yonathan (also the name of a prime character in the film).
Give this small film a chance and, if you like it, check out Zaytoun.

The only special features on the DVD are the theatrical trailer and a few trailers of other films in the  Strand Releasing catalog (including Zaytoun).

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
