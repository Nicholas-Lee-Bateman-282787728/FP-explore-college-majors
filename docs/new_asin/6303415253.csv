7845429,4,6303415253,"Billy Crystal fans should get this -- look at those used prices.  First half is top-notch, a faux gathering of celebs, some funny stuff that is really not obtainable elsewhere than a Billy Crystal production.  This man is fascinated by Sammy Davis, Jr., and there's a lot of him (Billy, that is).  Eugene Levy, Christopher Guest,  and even Brother Theodore -- laugh-out-loud fun.  But the second half is a stand-up concert at some high school or college, and Billy's material is weak.  Most of it is the Fernando character, but interviewing members of the audience.  I've never liked the business of interviewing members of an audience, going back to Johnny's show.  Billy does do one of the highlights of his many-years-later Broadway show, involving home movies.  The rest of the concert doesn't really make the cut.  But you'll get good value from the first half of this tape.  Aren't you glad you kept at least one VCR?",1359504000,,923,4.8152866242038215
