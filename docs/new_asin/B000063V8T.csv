1695326,5,B000063V8T,"I have been waiting years for Paramount to release the fifth season on DVD because of the second episode- Darmok. This is classic Trek at its best. The Enterprise encounters a new species and they have to figure out how to communicate. Even though the universal translator is working fine, they make no sense to each other. This is because the aliens' speech is full of symbols referencing their own mythology, which Picard and crew don't know, of course. The problem has to be solved with thought and understanding, not engineering. I have used this episode on snowy VHS, recorded from broadcast, for college teaching in symbolic anthropology, and it will be nice to pop the DVD into my laptop and shoot it out via the data projector.",1018396800,9,735,4.75
1695327,5,B000063V8T,"This season of Star Trek: The Next Generation is full of ""society episodes"" for example, Violations, the Masterpiece Society, the Outcast and the Cost of Living. They're all actually very good, it's the other episodes that the writers can't seem to get right this season. For a start the 2 part special ""Unification"" featuring Spock is long, drawn out and only has the last 5 minutes with any action. It's still good as a thriller but nothing really happens.
Jonathan Frakes continues his directing with ""Cause and Effect"" - the Enterprise caught in a temporal loop, leading to it's continual destruction each time. Frakes manages to film each of the 5 or 6 times it happens from a different perspective stopping it from grating. ""I Borg"" features the return of the Borg with the twist - a faction of them are individuals now. We didn't expect another Borg episode to take such a different stance, that's why it works. ""Power Play"" and ""Disaster"" are action packed - Die Hard - type episodes, and this is where Star Trek tends to lose out over Babylon 5, is that everything goes back to normal the following week. Any trauma these characters might have experienced or any changes in their character aren't continued throughout the rest of the series.
""The Inner Light"" is often sited as one of the finest episodes, where Picard lives the rest of his natural life (or believes he does) and has to deal with returning to the Enterprise after having come to terms with his new ""life."" It's very well made and Stewart shines as always. The season finale ""Time's Arrow"" is an enjoyable romp but a bit pointless, it feels more like Doctor Who than Star Trek. Still, there are some good episodes here and this box set is well worth having.

1695348,2,B000063V8T,"There are a few decent episodes this season (including a very enjoyable two-part episode with Leonard Nimoy reprising his character of Spock) but beyond that this is one of the most painful of seasons to get through. Some of these episodes are just the worst. The ""Darmok"" episode, for instance, feels like it will never end with that endless, cringe-worthy dialog. Then you get into those middle episodes and the series turns into just a ridiculous preaching exercise on topics such as ethics, assisted suicide, LGBT, genetic engineering, rape, and on and on, with very little subtlety (I remember clearly that this was the season when I gave up on the series as it was far too pretentious and preachy.) If they wanted to cover these topics, fine, but could they have told these stories with more subtly and artistry and not so ham-fistedly?

And then throw in another irritating Lwaxana Troi episode with a combo of Worf's irritating son Alexander and you get to the point where you can't wait for the series to be over. ""Imaginary Friend"" is the penultimate in bad writing and to me was a gargantuan shark-jump of the series.  There were previously so many good episodes with Borg encounters, Klingon politics and Romulan brinkmanship that they really reached the low point here with Worf, a remarkable character, reduced to little more than absurd comic relief as he's taking a mudbath? Oh, and the Borg are just friendly young people once you get to know them. This season was just the worst.",1492732800,,1497,4.821011673151751
1695349,5,B000063V8T,"The Next Generation has replaced The Sopranos as my all-time favorite TV series.  The writer's for the show are incredible.  For the earlier seasons, the special effects were a bit raw, as you would expect since the series started in 1987.  But by season 5, the special effects were much better.  But then again, I didn't watch this series for the special effects, it was for the compelling and amazing stories, and also the character development that can only be done on a TV series, instead of a 2 hour film.",1490659200,,510,4.571428571428571

1695353,5,B000063V8T,"I had to write about this season in particular. In my opinion, ST-TNG is the best of all the Trek series, especially in the later seasons when the cast had fully developed and come together. Be sure to watch ""The Inner Light"". This episode can be watched by itself, not in order, and I think it's one of the best performances by Stewart in the whole series.",1486252800,,357,4.343283582089552

1695369,5,B000063V8T,"It's Star Trek.  You know what you are getting.  Once TNG ramps up, starting with season 3, it is the best of all the Star Trek series.  I like them all, but something about TNG makes it special, and season 5 has some of the best and most unforgettable episodes, including Darmok, Ensign Ro, Ethics, The First Duty (the scene between Capt. Picard and Wesley Crusher when Picard confronts the cadet about his testimony is one of the most powerful in all of Star Trek), I Borg, and The Inner Light (which many fans have rated as the best Star Trek episode of all; I like it a great deal, but there are other episodes I prefer, such as The Wounded from season 4 and The Pegasus from Season 7).  I've watched all these episodes over and over since they first aired, and I am sure I will be watching them and enjoying them for the rest of my life; that is how good and timeless they are.",1485561600,2,882,4.232142857142857

My cousin loves star trek and a couple years ago suggested I give it another try and to start with next generation. So I started with the pilot and ended up watching every episode. Have since watched every star trek series and movie....the original series being my second favorite.

All of the regular cast perform well also. Picard is hit by an energy beam from a probe which pulls him back thousands of years, to a planet that no longer exist after their sun goes nova. Picard's character lives 40 years in a matter of 20 to 25 minutes while on the ship, the USS Enterprise. It is an wonderful story of saving the history of a planet for future generations to recall.

Not much of an official editorial review here from Amazon. But then again what else is there really left to add. Star Trek has given us fans so much throughout the decades, and 29 years after this series premiered its still immensely enjoyable. The episodes never get old and with Christmas sales I was able to finish the run. The inserts to this 7disc DVD release offer the following product description;
------------
In season five of Star Trek: The Next Generation, nothing can be taken for granted in an everchanging universe. Leonard Nimoy returns as the famous Vulcan Spock, who rocks the established order when he defiantly flies into Romulan territory. Bajoran Ensign Ro Laren is forced to protect the Cardassians who persecuted her people. Worf (Michael Dorn) learns what it means to be a father, Data (Brent Spiner) discovers the unexpected truth about a timetraveling historian, and Captain JeanLuc Picard (Patrick Stewart) must confront a new and unexpected dimension of his greatest enemy, the Borg.

1695953,5,B000063V8T,"I always watch Data to see if I can catch him picking his butt crack or sniffing his fingers but so far he's been clean. One predictable behavior that I did notice was that Beverly Crusher does frequently exhibit premenstrual syndrome that I'm sure most viewers write off as normal bitchy female spookiness which of course adds to the drama of Star Trek The Next Generation season five! Being a video head, even after seasons one through four, I've not been discouraged or disappointed with the Star Trek premise ""Space The Final Frontier"", it reminds me of how we are all being kept in the dark as to the extent of NASA's secret solar system expeditions currently on going with the aid of our area S-4 benefactors. There's only room for so many to play in the breakaway social structure and if you ain't in 'the play' you most likely won't know what I'm talking about So while the rest of earth is being kept arrested in their infantile slumber the chosen ($) few will be outside of earth's solar system looking down on us in envy watching Star Trek The Next Generation! If you have never heard of Star Trek or the break away society you are probably living in some wild and crazy jungle in south Brazil and are happier for it!

I really didn't like how Picard let her give away her life into endless sex slavery and overt, unhealthy codependent bondedness, without the hope of escape or even comfort. But it was a good episode, none the less.

Letting her go must have been one of the hardest decisions of his life, and he's made quite a lot of hard decisions. The last minute was very great acting.",1442534400,,478,4.6117647058823525

Some *spoilers* but it's been almost 20 years so,

They introduced Ensign Ro during this season;
Counselor Troi got to grow as a character;
Spoc, the borg and Wesley make an appearance,
They brought back characters or situations that were mentioned in previous seasons which gave the sense of continuity and a close universe.
They took opportunities to try new things which made this particular series more memorable.
A few of my favorite episodes are ""Cause and Effect"", ""Ensign Ro"", ""Disaster"", ""Hero Worship"", ""Conundrum"" and ""I, Borg"", it is really good story telling for a TV show from late 80s.
I liked how ensign Ro, the new character, brought a good new dynamic to the series.

Season 4 is when it kicked into an even higher gear.

Season 5 is when stuff starts to get real. This is the season when Spock makes an appearance. (If that's a spoiler to you, it's a 20 year old show. Come on...) TNG kicks up the Warp factor in season 5 as the series just continues to get better and better as it moves along.

As for the digital presentation on the Amazon FireStick......it makes the show worth rewatching. The print is cleaned up and looks fantastic. It's not HD because the show wasn't shot in HD originally. It's still presented in a 4:3 frame (black bars on the sides of a modern widescreen TV). But it's cleaned up so it's a crisp clear image like you've never seen. Additionally the special effects have been enhanced with more modern technology available to add a sense of realism to the space scenes. This is done in a positive way, not a ""Let's make Greedo shoot first and add a bunch of CGI Banthas everywhere"" way. Nothing is really 'changed' about the special effects, just cleaned up and enhanced a bit. It's the kind of clean up that should have happened to Star Wars.

Picard has his hands full this season.  For some reason known only to a few, humans see not universally loved.  Go figure!  Diplomacy IS Jean Luc's thing.  He can talk Warf down from a potential head bashing to some unsuspecting, or even suspecting, critter.

Speaking of Picard, okay, here it is, Stardate whatever, hundreds of years in the future and he's still bald.  They can use tricorders to heal bones and even raise the dead.

1696247,5,B000063V8T,"This has always been my favorite TNG season, and one of my favorite single seasons of any show, ever. I've seen a few specific episodes in recent years, but overall it's been probably at least 15 years since I saw most of these episodes last. I was hopeful that most of the season would hold up reasonably well, and I am thrilled to say that my hope was met and exceeded. Of the 26 episodes, I awarded ten 4-star ratings and another six 5-star ratings: ""Darmok"", ""Unification I"", ""The Outcast"", ""Cause and Effect"", ""I Borg"", and ""The Inner Light"".

Conceptually, ""Darmok"" is the most brilliant of the season, perhaps of the whole franchise, and has always been my favorite episode of TNG. ""Cause and Effect"" - GROUNDHOG DAY before there was GROUNDHOG DAY - is also clever in concept, and deftly executed.

""Unification I"" is both exciting (the mystery of why Spock has gone to Romulus) and moving (Picard's discussion with Sarek); so much so that its conclusion doesn't fully live up to its promise, despite the second half being the part that actually features Leonard Nimoy as Spock. I own the standalone Blu-ray release that presents both halves as a single feature, which I watched and reviewed last year:

http://amazon.com/review/R1BRY04DESH0UV/.

""The Outcast"" is a controversial episode; it's the LGBT allegory story in which Riker strikes up an unexpected romance with a member of an androgynous race, who is caught, exposed, put on trial, and sentenced to conversion therapy. I will readily concede that, 24 years later, it is both heavy-handed and clumsy in parts. But Melinda Culea played the role of Soren so tenderly that it broke my heart, reminding me of one of my dearest friends and the hardships she has endured. And Soren's trial soliloquy may be as subtle as Foghorn Leghorn's metaphorical bowling ball, but there's not a word in it that I would change, and I silently cheered during its delivery.

""I Borg"" is one of the few episodes I had seen in recent memory, and yet despite its relative freshness, I think I was even more riveted this time than ever before for some reason. One of my favorite films has long been 12 ANGRY MEN, and it was only this time through that I realized there's a certain parallel between this episode and that brilliant film/play, with Geordi, Guinan, and ultimately Captain Picard himself being forced to accept the reality of Hugh over their own prejudiced assumptions.

As for ""The Inner Light"", I confess it's always been one of those episodes that I know is held in high esteem but I didn't fully connect with...until now. Maybe I was just too young and inexperienced before? Whatever the reason, I'm now firmly in the camp of its devotees.

I only designated one episode with a substandard, two-star rating: ""Ethics"". In this one, Lt. Worf is paralyzed and wants to commit assisted, ritual suicide but winds up with a miraculous experimental artificial replacement spine instead. I realize that endorsing assisted suicide is a troubling position for many to take - I support it, and even I'm uncomfortable with several areas of its application, including patients like me with mental health concerns.

But the subject matter deserves better than ""Ethics""'s tidy, sidestepping resolution, which makes the episode little more than a contrivance for lectures from Dr. Crusher and Commander Riker. Demanding that people live in conditions they detest because the idea of them ending their own lives makes you squeamish is at least as selfish as making that choice - which is not an easy one to make. The show may have meant well, but even when it originally aired I found it reductive and preachy, and my experiences since have made me even more incompatible with it.

I do applaud Marina Sirtis's tender performance as Counselor Troi in the episode, though. Michael Dorn does what he can with Worf, but that role is written so one-dimensional that there isn't much for him to do except shout and grumble.

In fact, I would say that it was Sirtis as Troi who stood out most to me throughout the season. I know the general consensus holds that she was a rather superfluous character, but I've come to value compassion a lot more than I did in my impatient youth when the show was new. Just her presence in certain scenes, asking if someone wants to talk may seem like a trivial, even wasteful thing but I can't think of anyone else on TV like her today, and in my estimation we're all poorer for that. Plus, Troi does get to be involved with several stories beyond cautioning Picard that someone is withholding information.

I'm thrilled that I was able to buy this season on Blu-ray Disc when Amazon ran it on sale in November, 2014. I own the first four seasons on DVD and simply hadn't gotten around to buying The Complete Fifth Season DVD set when the Blu-ray Disc releases were announced, and I'm glad I held off. For one thing, these episodes look every bit as fantastic as I'd read!

But other than that, I'm a bonus feature enthusiast, and this set ported over all of its DVD counterpart's content, as well as adding four episodic commentary tracks, a gag reel, a 74-minute round table discussion with the series's three key composers, and a two-part, hour long retrospective. Of these, the highlights for me are the ""Cause and Effect"" commentary with writer Brannon Braga and Seth MacFarlane, whose unadulterated enthusiasm for the show I found surprisingly delightful, and the aforementioned discussion by composers Jay Chattaway, Ron Jones, and Dennis McCarthy, led by Jeff Bond. Composers and music usually get short shrift in DVD/Blu-ray features, making this a rare, fascinating piece.

When I averaged out the episode star ratings I assigned, I wound up with a lowly 3.86 rating for the season, which is proof to me that sometimes things are greater than the sum of their parts. I watched this Blu-ray set throughout a particularly rough week for me that began with one friend hospitalized and ended with the funeral for another's stepfather. I cannot emphasize enough how important the simple ""comfort food"" aspect of this season's episodes was for me.",1421712000,,6120,4.839388145315487

As a true testament that the system is automated and no one actually reads these emails on Amazon's end, they promptly shipped me a replacement of the whole Season 5 Bluray, again without the sleeve. So now I have two Seasons 5, and neither has a sleeve. Sigh. I have no idea what Amazon did with the sleeves, or if they received them from the distributor without them, but the whole thing was silly and annoying. One star off for this mishap on Amazon's part; otherwise I love the product itself.",1420761600,,1085,4.597938144329897

<>  Skipped as Too Heavy,  dark or forced : 1 Redemption,  10 New Ground, 12 Violations,  16 Ethics,  17 The Outcast,  20 Cost of Living.

--- All-in-all, STNG is improving as are the acting skills of the cast, especially Patrick Stewart.  Trio (Sirtis) still has awful hair and is looking a very old 37 (probably over tanning).

Unification with Leonard Nimoy reprising his role as Spock along with the final appearance of Sarek played by Spock's father are not to be missed.  Overall, several great morality plays as well from Ethics to I, Borg.

1696346,2,B000063V8T,"But it's not just the cheapness of the episodes exemplified by the many stories that take place entirely on the Enterprise, it's the stench of smug political correctness that ruins this season for me as well.

Spoilers follow... For example the awful episode Silicon Avatar in which the crystalline entity makes an appearance. So this thing has perhaps killed billions of people, and not only kills intelligent life on any planet it attacks, but kills ALL life down to the bacteria and Picard wants to talk with it?!? I don't care if they establish communications with the thing, its crimes are monstrous. It's has destroyed how many living beings? How many planets has it scoured of life? (Maybe we should have just forgiven Ted Bundy too while we're at it. After all it was alcohol abuse and pornography that drove him to slaughter all those young women. If only we'd talked to him to help him realize that serial killing is just bad. It wasn't his fault, at least according to him). But no, the entity is just like a whate scooping up cuttlefish, NO IT'S FREAKING NOT!!! It destroys everything. I'm sorry but the scientist who kills the crystalline entity, no matter what her motivation, is a hero and would be treated as such by every sentient lifeform in the galaxy (except other crystalline entities). Yet in the perverted Star Trek universe she is made to feel as though she is in the wrong by the self-satisfied pricks that make up the crew of the Enterprise. Ugh.

This is the episode that truly turned me away from TNG. Its hand wringing, preachiness and its smug sense of its own superiority is truly indicitive of the times in which it was made. Picard is a politically correct caricature, not to mention a complete tool perfectly fitted to such a bland and naively cheerful vision of the future. Season 5 also in general solidifies the trend of soap opera in the corporate boardroom in space that TNG eventually became though there are still many diamonds to be found in the subsequent and ever-increasing rough that is season 5. For example the first episode Redemption Part 2 and the generally good Darmok and Ensign Ro. The two part Reunification starring Leonard Nimoy as Spock is also entertaining despite the cheapness of the sets and some plot holes big enough to accomodate the passage of a bus. Ironically one of the best TNG episodes is also in this season: The Inner Light. It's truly awesome and poignant. Patrick Stewart outdoes himself and proves himself once again to be a fine actor. But the episode where they find a Borg they name Hugh fer chissakes and the truly execrable Imaginary Friend, one of two BORING child centric episodes that cause my gorge to rise, and the Deanna Troi's mother episode among many, many others makes season 5 really not worth it. Actually Imaginary Friend gets my vote as worst TNG episode of all time and that includes the embarrasing planet of the black people episode from season 1 and the planet of the personal trainers in which Weslie is sentenced to death for stomping on some flowers, also from season 1. It's that godawful. After the greatness that was season 4, season 5 looks shoddy and feels icky by comparison.",1409097600,,3183,4.723021582733813

""The Outcast"" is sadly still a very important episode to watch. ""Cause and effect"" is a nice surreal one eclipsed by the next seasons ""Frame of Mind.""

1696371,5,B000063V8T,"By the end of season 5, TBNG was showing its age, and was beginning to decline, if ever so slightly.

Still, it had lasted two years longer than had the original, and without network interference, which had pretty well doomed the original, this series was still in possession of a couple of decent seasons yet to come.

There was plenty to criticize in this season.  Imaginary Friend, Masterpiece Society, and Disaster were about as bad as the first season ever got.  The completely unnecessary Unification I & II served only to refer to ST VI:TUC, and provided another opportunity to show how un-Yar-like was her daughter, the Romulan Sela, not to mention generating more screen time for Leonard Nimoy, Mark Lenard, and Denise Crosby.

With all that said, the good was MORE than enough to outweigh the bad.  Ensign Ro introduced a great recurring character.  Darmok was a thought-provoking look at the way communication evolves through the ages.  Cause and Effect and A Matter of Time were two completely different takes on time travel (and it was good to see Dr Frasier Crane in a  Starfleet uniform).

Ah, and then there's The Inner Light, in which Picard... well, no, if you haven't seen it, I just can't spoil it for you.  In the end, it proved to be among the series' most compelling episodes, consistently ranked with Yesterday's Enterprise and The Measure of a Man as among the best hours of series television, ever.

I don't regret owning this set in the least.

Oh, and let's not forget how incredibly great the BD presentation is.  The contrast between BD and DVD is far greater than that between DVD and VHS.  The extras and commentaries are rich.

I urge all fans of TNG to a) convert to BD, and b) get all TNG seasons in BD.

They were about so much more than glory and mayhem concerning the Enterprise crew in 200+ years. They used the crew of the USS Enterprise to explore many of the  timeless human issues that are included in the great literature of all mankind's ages past. These issues being spread out in the setting of tomorrow and the possibilities of other species and cultures adds wonderful sizzle to these shows.  Star Trek was a part of the excitement that we enjoyed as our very real space program was being developed- as we were going to the moon and planning for the space station. I somehow knew that we would shortly be having our own real adventures as we would go to Mars and beyond within my lifetime.

1696413,1,B000063V8T,"At least 210 people are not going to agree with this, but as a certified Star trek fan (have seen every episode of every season of every Star Trek series) the fifth season was one of TNG's most disappointing.

Yes there were some good episodes - Inner Light was excellent, Conundrum was good, ""The Perfect Mate"" was at least entertaining thanks to guest star Famke Janssen.  But this doesn't make up for all the bad ones made in this season.  The primary culprit was budget cutting by Paramount.  As the cast salaries went up, the studio cut back on the money being spent on actual production.  The result was episode after episode where the characters just talked and talked, with little money available for action or special effects.  The writing changed to accommodate the shrinking budgets, with stories that dealt with psychological or emotional conflicts that were inexpensive to shoot.  Whenever possible the existing sets and cast were used to further save money.

Some examples:

Redemption  the season premiere, instead of big epic space battles, viewers got a short fight with three ships and then just talk and a money-saving space detection grid rendered with a little low-res animation.

Unification I and II  could have been great with Leonard Nimoy showing up to reprise the Original Series character of Spock, but was sabotaged by cramped, cheap-looking sets and eight extras that were supposed to represent the entire Romulan civilization.  The slowly-paced filler scenes of Picard and Data pretending to be Romulans are truly excruciating to watch.

Power Play  the old money-saving chestnut of having some of the regular cast temporarily turn evil, all filmed on existing sets of course.

Cause and Effect  very likely the cheapest episode of TNG ever made (the clip show Shades of Grey from season two was the second cheapest).  Ten minutes of shooting (with multiple cameras to provide alternate angles) was repeated five times over as the crew (and unfortunately the audience) is subjected to the same events again, and again, and again

I, Borg  to avoid the expensive space battles that usually occur when the Federation meets the Borg, in this episode the crew of the Enterprise adopt one as a pet (for real - Im not making this up!).

Times Arrow  the dullest TNG season finale ever, with incredible amounts of talking and no action whatsoever.

Save your money  TNGs best seasons were 2, 3 and 4.  Thats what I would buy (and did).",1395014400,7,2459,4.924574209245742
1696414,5,B000063V8T,"The ""Darmok"" episode aired in 1991 when the US was bombing to obliteration (the first time) Iraq - ancient Mesopotamia. Here's the story of Gilgamesh and Enkido and their struggle to communicate before it's too late.  Picard and crew finally figure out that this ""alien"" race is speaking in metaphors. . . and since ""we"" don't understand their metaphoric references we cannot understand what they are trying to tell us.  It would be like our communicating by saying things like ""Juliet on her balcony!"" and we all understand.  When Captain Picard finally figures this out, he does the same, communicating with metaphors from the Gilgamesh Epic. . . humankind's first written story. . .on cuneiform tablets (the flood story is here too). . .from Sumeria in modern day Iraq.  I wept when it was first broadcast because I understood the writers and producers were trying to say something about the unspeakable thing we Americans were doing to this most ancient people and their legacy to US!

TEACHERS: You will certainly want to use this in conjunction with your study of Gilgamesh (and use the Ludmila Zeman versions! . . . see my reviews there, and the older version by Bernarda Bryson is a treasure too).

The beauty of old series being shot on film is that they can be scanned at a higher resolution even 4k or beyond and that old detail can be brought up to today's standards.

The producers of this series did not stop there.  After scanning in the film, the digital effects were updated.  It's a spectacular upgrade to an old favorite.  I was blown away and am happy with the purchase to say the least.

1696441,3,B000063V8T,I love Star Trek but had to drop its rating because of poor sound quality in such a popular show.  The closer to blu-ray quality the more satisfying the experience.,1390953600,,164,4.466666666666667
1696442,4,B000063V8T,"For its fifth season, Star Trek: The Next Generation had a bit of a shake-around. The character of Ro Laren was introduced as a periodically recurring character to replace Wesley (who had departed in the previous season) and there was a dialling back of the more intricate continuity that had bound parts of the fourth season together, with more emphasis on stand-alone stories. This had mixed results: several of the very finest episodes the show has ever produced sit alongside some of the worst episodes to air since the first season.

Things get off to a promising start with the continuation of the Klingon Civil War and Romulan arcs that dominated the fourth season. Redemption II does a good job of wrapping up those storylines and the Unification two-parter deals with lingering issues, but it's surprising that we don't hear any more about those storylines again. Unification also works as a solid character vehicle for Leonard Nimoy as Spock, who appears in a cross-over event to promote the-then contemporary movie Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Nimoy is splendid as usual, but the story continues The Next Generation's tendency to have great setting-up episodes in the first part of a two-part story only for the second to throw it away with a rather dull conclusion.

Elsewhere, the season features several all-time classic episodes. Darmok, which forces Picard to work alongside an alien who can only speak in metaphor, is a terrific slice of television (if highly implausible) with some great chemistry between Patrick Stewart and Paul Winfield as his alien counterpart. The fact that the mere mention of ""Shaka, when the walls fell,"" can trigger meme-like quotes of the episode almost twenty-two years on is a testament to how good it is. Ensign Ro introduces the titular character and promptly breaks several of the show's key rules (not having conflict between Starfleet officers and not basing episodes around the guest star of the week) to excellent effect. Michelle Forbes is terrific as Ro and her recurring appearances are highlights of the season. Disaster and Power Play are effective siege stories (in the former case due to a catastrophic accident and in the latter due to alien possessors taking hostages) and The Next Phase is a fun adventure for Geordi and Ro. Cause and Effect is a great remake (but in a bit more depth) of a Red Dwarf gag. But the outstanding season highlight is The Inner Light, in which Picard gets zapped with the memories of aliens who have been dead for a thousand years and get to see how his life might have played out in other circumstances, complete with children and a loving wife. Patrick Stewart is magnificent and the episode deservedly won a Hugo Award. It's The Next Generation's City on the Edge of Forever, only better.

Elsewhere, we get a lot of mediocre-to-okay episodes. Silicon Avatar is a bit of a weak resolution to the Crystalline Entity storyline that began back in Season 1, whilst A Matter of Time is a very cheesy episode elevated by a terrific guest turn from Matt Frewer. This use of quality guest stars also redeems The Game and The Perfect Mate, which could have both been weak without some great appearances by Ashley Judd and Famke Janssen (both before their later movie careers took off) to elevate things. The Masterpiece Society is a potentially very good episode wrecked by the main threat in it being rather over the top (the stellar fragment would completely destroy the planet Picard is trying to save, rendering their ethical objections to the disruption of their society moot). Conundrum is an effectively tense episode. Ethics is reasonably good, invoking a moral dilemma and putting Crusher on the 'wrong' side of the debate with Worf's life at stake. The Outcast tries to say some interesting things about sexuality and gender issues but back-pedals away from anything too controversial and ends up being notable more for being one of the very few episodes of the series where our heroes 'lose'. The First Duty adds some urgently-needed shades of grey to Wesley and humanises more than his first four years on the ship combined did. I, Borg humanises the Borg for some great drama (and a great guest turn from Whoopi Goldeberg as Guinan) but this comes at the cost of destroy the Borg's otherworldly implacability, reducing them to the status of just another alien race.

Against that we have Cost of Living, literally the worst episode of the series to air since Season 1. Hero Worship and Violations aren't far behind it, and Time's Arrow, despite a few good moments, is easily the worst season cliffhanger Star Trek has done in its history.

For this HD re-release of the season, CBS have, as usual, done an outstanding job. The episodes look like they were filmed yesterday, the special effects are astonishing (even moreso given they - in the main - have not been redone from scratch but are the original effects footage remastered) and overall the visual and sound quality of the series far surpasses that of the standard definition versions. The only slight disappointment is that there seems to be more missing film stock for this season than the previous ones, resulting in a few more noticeable moments (though only a few seconds each) where the SD footage has been upscaled instead. This is easily bearable, however. Slightly more disappointing is the quality of the special features. There's some nice stuff on the music, but the on-going documentary about the making of the series gets sidetracked by Gene Roddenberry's death during the making of this season and overlooks the opportunity to talk about many interesting episodes. It may be that the producers were starting to run out of ideas about what to do for special features for the fifth set in a row, which is disappointing.

The fifth season of Star Trek: The Next Generation (****) is a mixed bag, with some dire episodes and a fair few middling ones. However, the quality of the best episodes elevates the whole thing and certainly makes it worth watching. The season is available now on Blu-Ray in the UK and USA.",1390867200,2,6093,4.887814313346229

1696445,5,B000063V8T,"Season 5 was another fantastic season with some of the most memorable episodes. Darmok  when Picard and an alien are trapped on a planet together without the ability to communicate (and Ashley Judds debut). The Game -  (guest starring Judd again) when the crew all becomes addicted to a VR game. Ensign Ro  introduces new character Ro Laren, and giving us a deeper knowledge of the Bajorans. I Borg  a powerful episode where we see a Borg (Hugh) learn a sense of individuality, then is used to infiltrate the Borg at great risk to himself. ""The Inner Light""  when Picard lives an entire lifetime on an alien world as a way to pass on the alien culture. And, of course, Unification Part 1 and 2  Sarek passes away, and Picard learns that Spock is on Romulus teaching Vulcan philosophy to the Romulans. Unification as a standalone movie on blu-ray was a good choice. Its easily one of the best episodes of the entire series. And the interesting packaging alone is worth the purchase for a collector like me.

Gene Roddenberry passed away during this season, and this season 5 blu ray set offers a documentary tribute that touches on the impact his death had on the show and the cast and crews memories of Roddenberry.

Im very glad I waited to collect the seasons of TNG until they were available in high definition. These blu ray sets have been outstanding. And these latest releases are a must-have for any fan.

1696481,5,B000063V8T,"I received Season Five on Blu-Ray yesterday on release date.  As with the previous season releases of TNG, Season Five has proven to be top-notch.  I have obviously not watched it all the way through in less than twenty-four hours, however I have watched the documentaries and one episode from each just to sample disc quality.

Many reviews have listed Season Five as less-than-stellar with a few quality standout episodes; I whole-heartedly disagree.  While Seasons Three and Four were top-notch for sure, I feel the the fifth season produced mostly high quality episodes with only a couple ""duds.""

""The Game,"" ""New Ground,"" ""Hero Worship,"" and ""The Perfect Mate"" are episodes I used to skip when watching the series on Netflix.  However, the HD transformation makes those episodes fun to watch again.  ""Ethics"" is also an episode I have a serious problem with.  I feel like the script writer tried to shove a bunch of conservative, twentieth century morals in surrounding Worf's paralysis and wish to end his life.  They made Riker and Crusher downright sanctimonious in the episode, which was atypical of their characters.

As mentioned, Season Five had some absolutely stellar episodes.  ""Ensign Ro,"" ""Conundrum,"" ""Cause and Effect,"" ""The First Duty,"" ""Power Play,"" ""A Matter of Perspective,"" ""Violations,"" ""I, Borg,"" and ""The Outcast,"" and ""The First Duty"" are some that stand out in my mind.  ""The Outcast"" succeeds on all levels, even surpassing Season Four's ""The Host.""  One of the very best episodes of any Star Trek series, ""The Inner Light,"" is a favorite as well.

Not only do we get great character development for the seven main characters, Season Five manages to give some great scenes to important supporting characters, including O'Brien (Colm Meaney) and his new wife Keiko (Rosalind Chao), Ensign Ro (the great Michell Forbes), and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg).

The bonus features are fantastic.  Included are the original bonus features transported over from the original DVDs, as well as the 30-second episodic promos for each episode.  These more than anything remind me of watching the show growing up, and I really hope they find all the promos for Deep Space Nine when they begin its HD transformation.  There are brand-new audio commentaries on ""Cause and Effect,"" ""The First Duty,"" ""I, Borg,"" and ""The Inner Light.""  Other new bonus features include newly-discovered deleted scenes and a gag reel and a conversation with the main composers of Next Generation's music.  Most enjoyable, though, is the two-part documentary for this season set, 'Requiem: A Remembrance of Star Trek The Next Generation.'  The first part, titled 'The Needs of the Many,' mainly focuses on a 1981 interview given by Gene Roddenberry.  In it he talked about his vision for the future and his hopes for Star Trek.  New interviews with Rick Berman, Ron Moore, and others on the creative team are peppered in around clips from Gene's 1981 interview.  The second part of the documentary is called 'The Needs of the Few,' which mostly features the cast sharing memories of Gene and his death, which is emotional to watch.  There is also a discussion on how the series changed during Season Five.  The addition of Michelle Forbes is discussed.  Colm Meaney is also discussed.  All seven principle cast members are given interview time.

As with previous releases the HD transfer is phenomenal.",1384905600,9,3391,5.092391304347826
1696482,5,B000063V8T,"With Season 5 the writers, directors, and actors were in full sync and traveling at full warp. For me I especially like
""Darmok"", ""Cause and Effect"" and ""Inner Light"". So much that my brother in law Eric and I will recite lines from Darmok at holiday dinners. Season 5 also stars Leonard Nimoy in two episodes. Need I say more.",1384819200,2,327,4.466666666666667
1696483,5,B000063V8T,"Since Amazon condenses the reviews of multiple formats into one pile, I hope this one stands out. It covers CBS/Paramount's new Blu-ray release of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""'s fifth season, NOT the earlier DVD release. I was able to get an advance copy from the studio and also used it to write a separate full-length review of this title, listed below.

Once again, CBS Video has produced a top tier Blu-ray release that ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" fans will enjoy. Each and every episode has been re-scanned from the original camera negative, with the end result being much crisper and more detailed than the older DVD and broadcast versions which were shot on film but edited on videotape. The visual effects in many cases have been cleaned up or tastefully redone, and I'd be hard-pressed to complain about any of them. They're so good that casual fans of ""TNG"" might not even notice!

As for the episodes themselves, Season Five is home to some of ""TNG""'s best moments, from the fan favorite episode ""Inner Light"" to the two-part ""Unification"" that guest stars Leonard Nimoy as Spock (and this two-parter is available as a separate Blu-ray release, too). Other notable episodes include ""Power Play"", ""Darmok"", ""Cause and Effect"" and many more, with only a handful of less impressive outings along the way. As with past Blu-ray releases, the top-notch restoration WILL amplify your enjoyment of the series: a lot of time, money and effort went into this show week after week during its original run and, in some cases, you'll see details you've never noticed before. Simply put, if you're a fan of ""TNG"" you'll want to check this out immediately.

As for the bonus features, they're mostly as good as the ones we've seen on past Blu-ray collections. Highlights include a two-part retrospective featurette that spends some time remembering ""Trek"" creator Gene Roddenberry (who died during this season's production), a 70-minute roundtable interview with three of ""TNG""'s main music composers, four new audio commentaries, a handful of deleted scenes, a blooper reel, TV promos and more. The archive featurettes from the DVD release are even ported over!

Overall, a fantastic set whose price shouldn't intimidate you. A lot of effort went into its production and you'll get your money's worth. For more details, please read my complete review at: [...]",1384387200,46,2366,5.028061224489796

1.  if a movie or show receives too high of a ratting amazon will pull the video from being a free amazon prime video  to one you have to pay for. (see this happen several times)
2. no app to watch videos on other android tablets. there are those of use that require and need the use of a full featured android tablet over the heavily modified kindle fire tablet that lack in the advanced capabilities that an unaltered version of android os is capable of. and despite other android tablets has either the same or higher resolution  than the kindle fire hd.(kindle fire is only good for watching video, reading books and a few apps. full android is more like a hand held laptop)
3. for the piece you pay for amazon prime membership there should be a lot more videos free if not all of them. at the moment for 8 bucks a month you'll get a lot more movies, shows to watch with netflix, plus netflix streams in HD to all tablets, computers and devices not just certain ones like amazon.

I'm very happy with this product and recommend it to anyone looking to complete their collection. I took a gamble buying the full set of this version, but I found it was truly worth it. Did I mention I love this show? I tend to forget the show was filmed in the 80's and early 90's. A lot of love&talent went into this show, not just from the actors/actresses, but the sets, sfx, costumes, and the incredible writers.

It was touching and very well conceved the best Star Trek plot I have ever witnessed.  I am really impressed with STTNG, though I preferred ST Classics back then in my twentysomething days, I now think STTNG is much better and deeper. although I still think some other episodes of STTNG can be a bit flimsy(particularly season two) I think that the ones that aren't far out weigh the ones that are and this is one that is not flimsy or watered down and to the contrary is masterful and pheonominal!

The problem is that it forces the viewer to acknowledge one of the major problems of the Star Trek universe... that in virtually all other encounters with alien life, everyone speaks English. The Enterprise has encountered many alien species including quite a few first contacts, and yet they never have a problem communicating. The only way to get past it is to just accept that the show takes place in a version of reality where English is somehow universally spoken across the universe. But then this episode comes along and throws that out the window, and makes it look ridiculous that they can automatically communicate in English with every other new alien species they encounter.",1341964800,,769,4.9689922480620154

1696588,4,B000063V8T,"Each season of Star Trek: The Next Generation is great. 4/5 stars each.
TNG is about people with enlightened attitudes and behaviors, optimism, social justice, advanced technology, and exploration of our galaxy.
My favorite episodes of TNG are The Nth Degree (Season 4), The Inner Light (Season 5) and All Good Things (Season 7).

Some people say Star Wars is science fantasy and Star Trek is science fiction, but I think they are both science fantasy.
In Star Trek, ships travel faster than light (fantasy), there are matter-energy transporter beams (fantasy), and there are matter-energy replicators (fantasy).

Despite being one of the best TV shows of the 20th century, I can't give TNG 5/5 stars because it has some ridiculously unrealistic features, it is opposed to transhumanism (eg: part of the backstory is a ban on genetic engineering of humans; humans don't have brain-computer interfaces; Data tries to be more human-like; cybernetic/bionic beings --the Borg-- are portrayed as an enemy to the Federation), and the show is strangely lacking in concepts of superhappiness, superintelligence, and superlongevity.

None of the TNG episodes explain why there wasn't a ""technological singularity"" or ""informational singularity"" within a few hundred years beyond the 20th century. These concepts haven't become popular until recent years (2000s) and TNG ended in 1994, so it's forgivable, but these concepts have been around for decades, such as the Vernor Vinge piece in the January 1983 issue of Omni Magazine.

In any case, it's nice to sit back, relax, and watch the crew of the Enterprise on their adventures.

I recommend watching the whole TNG series in order, although you may prefer DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, Stargate Universe, Farscape, Battlestar Galactica (21st century version), or Babylon 5. Don't get overly fixated on television and movies; read science fiction novels, novellas, and short stories too! Three of my favorite novels are A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge, Schild's Ladder by Greg Egan, and Manifold: Time by Stephen Baxter. If you work in STEM and work 56-84 hour weeks, then take a week off twice per year to binge on sci-fi or sci-fantasy.

1696605,4,B000063V8T,"Season 5 of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" contains many predictable elements. Big surprise, the Enterprise encounters new aliens that test the crew's versatility and quick thinking as well as meeting old foes, like the Crystalline Entity and the Borg, who make them debate good and evil, right and wrong. Season 5 includes time travel, body possession, and transporter malfunctions. For a little titillation, the audience can count on Cmdr. Riker (Jonathan Frakes) seducing any pretty young thing in sight.

So why aren't we bored? How does ""STNG"" still manage to fire up our imaginations? Season 5 captivates its audience with a foolproof formula: It introduces a neophyte who, because of limited experience, thinks like the audience who are just as ignorant. Situations and veteran characters then guide the neophyte to understand issues and responsibilities in fuller, deeper ways, schooling us in the process.

The first four seasons, we had young Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) as our stand-in. For Season 5, the writers introduce Ensign Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes), a Bajoran with Starfleet experience but no familiarity with the professionalism and community that characterize the Enterprise. Ensign Ro does more than give the audience a new neophyte to learn from; she appeals to a different variety of geek.

Geeks fall somewhere on this continuum: At one extreme point are the folks who desire idealized social conformity. They yearn to participate in a cool group--just not the imperfect cliques at school or work. They want a community without pettiness, bullying, and other human flaws. Folks at this extreme want to be members of the near-utopian Enterprise, and they identify with Wesley because they would love the opportunity to come up in the culture as he has. At the other extreme of the geek continuum are the rebels. They ridicule Wesley for his desire to please and hope to identify with the misunderstood aliens the Enterprise is bound to meet. These folks embrace Ensign Ro, whom Big Daddy Picard (Patrick Stewart) rewards with attention despite her being standoffish, disobedient, and untamable.

To explain her atypical behavior, the writers give Ensign Ro this back story: She and her race lost their home planet to the Cardassians. Orphaned and living in refugee camps, Ro grew up feeling discarded and so is herself quick to reject. She abandons her own people to join Starfleet but then disobeys orders with disastrous results, including the forfeit of her commission and personal freedom. Ro boards the Enterprise with a sullen attitude and non-regulation Bajoran earring, happy to throw away a good first impression on Cmdr. Riker. When in 10-Forward Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) ask if she would mind their company at her table, she answers simply, ""Yes,"" dismissing their offer of friendship.

Forbes does an excellent job communicating the coltish energy of an exasperated teenager. Although her character never utters the word, we hear a ""Whatever!"" in the way she throws her body around. We soon forget that Ensign Ro is a Starfleet officer as Forbes has Ro assume sloppy, defensive posture, barely able to contain her contempt for the old farts who just can't appreciate her radical ideas and maverick methods. Whenever Ro knits her brow, either to signify anger or perplexity, those signature eyebrows emphasize the emotion.

Ensign Ro obviously has lessons to learn, and since we have all had occasion to feel that we will never fit in or do things right, we get schooled along with her. In ""Disaster,"" for example, Counselor Troi finds herself in charge of a ship about to explode. Ro recommends abandoning the drive section despite the survivors it might contain. Troi refuses to separate the saucer, a successful maneuver that teaches Ro that an officer should not so callously abandon her crew.

In ""Power Play,"" however, Capt. Picard demonstrates when an officer must sacrifice life. The Enterprise encounters penal colony escapees who board the ship in the bodies of Counselor Troi, Chief O'Brien (Colm Meaney), and Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner). Picard tricks them into a cargo bay where he can blow the hatch, sacrificing himself and the other officers but taking the prisoners with him and thus saving everyone else on the ship.

In ""The Next Phase,"" Ensign Ro awakens on the Enterprise after a transporter accident. Since no one can see her, she believes she is dead, a suspicion confirmed when she discovers Dr. Crusher filling out her death certificate. Lt. Cmdr. La Forge (LeVar Burton), cloaked in the same manner, convinces her not to abandon her place among the living so quickly, that another explanation besides death might account for their predicament. Working together, they find a solution to their invisibility rather than haunt the ship as ghosts.

What Season 5 needed was one more episode to show whether Ensign Ro grew as a result of her experiences on the Enterprise. The writers should have put her in a situation similar to the disastrous away mission from the Wellington when her disobeying orders caused the deaths of eight crew members. With flashbacks or another storytelling device, the writers could have given the audience the opportunity to learn the events of that day and make up its own mind whether Ro behaved poorly or not. The Enterprise crew knows the story; it's unfair that we don't. Was her decision a calculated loss of life? Would by-the-book have definitely failed? Was the captain of the Wellington an ineffectual leader prone to giving bad orders? A drunk? The paralleling new situation would have allowed us to observe what Ro had since learned.

If the Enterprise resembles a plastic surgeon's office with its calm pastels, uncluttered surfaces, and recessed lighting, the characters often seem victims of the doctor's knife, sliced a little too tight, as with Ensign Ro. Or perhaps the real characters of the series are the controversial issues each episode addresses, the crew just flat pieces, like plastic checkers, pushed around as the two sides face off.",1266796800,,6091,5.118712273641851
1696606,5,B000063V8T,"Just an amazing season, it's everything I expected AND MORE!, this series really took shape on it's 3rd season, and never looked back, this continues the excellence in every way shape and form, season 3 onward, there is so much character development, and the stories are just amazing, I'm so glad this series survived it's first 2 seasons, it's amazing how it did, but thank God it did.

Lots of standout episodes on this season, I'll mention my favorite episodes, 'Redemption Part 2' is the conclusion to the 4th season cliffhanger, and delivers what you would expect, an excellent, and driven episode, 'Darmok' is another standout, it's so similar to The Original Series, 'Disaster' is great as well, most of the crew is locked out of the bridge, and Troi is forced to take command, 'Unification Parts 1 and 2' is an excellent episode about Spock, and a peace treaty with the Romulans, 'A Matter of Time' is a really great time episode, with an unsuspected villain! 'Conundrum' is another great episode, dealing with a parallel universe in a way, 'Power Play' is excellent as well, Troi, Data, and Chief O'Brian overthrow the bridge crew!, 'Ethics' is a good Klingon episode, 'Cause and Effect' is one of my favorite Star Trek episodes of ALL Star Trek, the Enterprise gets caught up in a temporal time loop, 'I, Borg' continues the excellence, it gets you closer to...YES, THE BORG!, a really well thought out episode, 'The Next Phase' Geordi and Ro are caught up in a parallel universe, where they exist, but cannot be seen, nor heard, 'The Inner Light' is another one of my favorite episodes of all Star Trek, it deals with Captain Picard, living the life of another man, on a planet doomed for destruction, and what a twist at the end!, 'Time's Arrow Part 1' Data finds about his own death in the 19th century, and an accident brings him back to that period.

I have yet to see the conclusion, but I will not have to wait, I have the whole series now, if you are a fan of Star Trek, this season is needed, if you are a fan of science fiction in general, you need this season, actually you need all season from 3 to 7, as they are the best.

As far as the classics - ""Inner Light"" obviously tops the list as probably the best in the series' entire run, but it's closely followed by ""Darmok"", ""I, Borg"", ""The Perfect Mate"", ""The First Duty"", ""Cause and Effect"", and ""Conundrum"".

The clunkers list is unfortunately just as long, headlined by ""Imaginary Friend"" and ""New Ground"".  There are at least half a dozen episodes that are comfortably skippable on repeat viewings.  Not sure whether the writers got lazy, were pressed for time, or simply ran out of ideas.

1696630,5,B000063V8T,"The best shows seem to arise from adversity and limitation.  As the Next Generation's season five was filming, the Star Trek universe was about to expand into two shows running simultaneously.  Thus, new writers, producers, directors, etc. had to be brought in to fill in the gaps.  Minor characters, who would cross over into DS9 were given more screen time to make the bridge.  And Gene Roddenberry, creator and guiding light of the Star Trek universe, passed away.  This is the crucible in which TNG Season 5 was forged, and it remains the best season of all the Star Trek series since the Original.

Not only are the shows consistently interesting, there are more standout episodes in this season than in the rest of the show's run combined.  Even when stealing Original Series ideas, they are a completely new take on an old tune, like a remake of a '60s pop tune by a '90s heavy metal artist. True, neither the season premier's Klingon War nor the finale's time-travelling cliffhanger are very good.  Resolution I (the first half of the Klingon war) and The Best of Both Worlds I and II are clearly superior.  But in between these disappointments are the following great shows:

Darmok - a ""remake"" of the classic Trek episode ""Arena"".  Picard and an alien captain are trapped together on a planet to do battle against a common foe, while learning about each other's cultures.

Ensign Ro - a veiled commentary on the Palastinian question that protrays the problem with negotiating with fractured ethnic groups - who do you negotiate with?  Introduces Ro Laren and the Bajoran people.

Disaster - the best of the ""kids"" episodes.  Picard is trapped in an elevator with the winners of the elementary school science fair when the Enterprise is hit by a quantum filament that knocks out main power and intraship communications.

Conundrum - yet another ""Naked Time""-esque episode, where the crew has its memories erased and they must piece together their mission and their relative positions in the command hierarchy.

The Outcast - Riker falls in love with a member of an androgynous society.  The catch - she thinks of herself as female only, which is considered a sexual perversion in her society.

Cause and Effect - the Enterprise is trapped in a time loop caused by an anti-matter accident.  They are forced to live the same day over and over until they can figure out how to break the cycle.  Filmed well before the more famous movie ""Groundhog Day"".

The Perfect Mate - another Original Series ripoff, this time of ""Elaan of Troyus"".  An empath whose sole purpose in life is to be the perfect mate is promised in marriage to a foreign dignitary to cement a peace treaty.  Unfortunately, she is prematurely ""hatched"" and raises havoc with the male parts of the crew.

The Next Phase - Geordi and Ro are ""cloaked"" in a Romulan cloaking device accident.  Ro thinks she is in limbo to make peace with her living friends before she can move to the afterlife.

The First Duty - following an accident at Starfleet Academy, Wesley must choose between loyalty to the principles of Starfleet or loyalty to his friends.

Inner Light - the best Next Generation show, possibly the best Star Trek show over all series.  Picard is selected by a probe and lives out a life on an alien planet.  Winner of a Hugo for best dramatic presentation.

Sharp-eyed Trekkies will notice I left ""Unification"" off this list.  I find it to be quite problematic.  It was eagerly anticipated as episodes to feature both Spock and Sarek, which they did, but the brilliant parts (Spock's interactions with Data, for example) are counterbalanced by the silly Tasha-Yar's-daughter subplots that marred most of the Romulan episodes of this era.  Similarly, there are some great sacrifices of science to the needs of the plot.  Sometimes they are necessary - for example, Geordi and Ro can move through walls but not floors? (""Next Phase"")  What really irritates me, though, is the sacrifice of the laws of physics for no reason - for example, we are supposed to believe that a few phaser shots will cause planet-wide earthquakes/volcanoes, but a giant asteroid strike did not?? (""A Matter of Time"")

Perhaps the main reason the 5th season is so successful is that the cast works together so well, also integrating new and recurring minor characters (e.g. Chief O'Brien, Ens. Ro).  Even the Wesley shows (both ""The Game"" and especially ""First Duty) are good.  Even the kids shows are good (Alexander, Worf's son, quickly wears out his welcome in his 2 episodes, but the other episodes that prominently feature kids, like ""Disaster"", ""Hero Worship"", and ""Imaginary Friend"" are all enjoyable).  Basically, the tried-and-true Trek formula of combining socially relevant statements, sci-fi action, and a feeling of family among the crewmembers is at its pinnacle in this season.

To sum up: if you only buy one TNG season, make it this one.  All the best episodes, save possibly ""Best of Both Worlds"" and certain Q episodes, are in this season.",1193184000,2,5012,4.855123674911661

The only thing I have been glad about in the world of trek is that they fired rick berman and that ronald d moore is producing battlestar glactica. If your a fan of next gen at least the prices have come down when this set first came out it was 119 dollars. I hope that enterprise and voyger come down as well. I am waiting for the orgianl series HD to come out on DVD. I think it is cheaper if you get the 7 pack bundle for all the next gen shows.

1696647,5,B000063V8T,"The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order although Season Three was aired fairly much according to the chronological produced order except for episode one and two which are switched around. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG) had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast. An instant hit and a milestone in television serials (it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3), its characters and new look Enterprise had us glued to the TV with the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.' Star Trek: Season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual effects. The display panels on the enterprise are more interactive. The camera can now pan as special effects take place. Deep space battles seem more intense. We also get a new Star Trek title graphic in the opening sequence. The cliff-hanger conclusion of ""Redemption, Part II"" is a great episode although slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between Klingons, Romulans and the Federation, turns out to be more of a character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would get. None-the-less, it is still a good episode that reveals some things about the family of Tasha Yar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (with a new red suede coat and grey uniform), Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge (who sports a new beard in one episode), Lieutenant Commander Worf (who left the Enterprise in Season Four), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien as is Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Alexander Rozhenko as Worf's son now has a reoccurring role since Season Four. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) is firmly established as a reoccurring character. Watch out for the special appearances of Ashley Judd as Ensign Robin Lefler and Leonard Nimoy as Spock! Whoot! Whoot! Strangely enough this is the only season where Q, of the omnipotent Q Continuum, does not make an appearance. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is also absent from this Season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Klingon High Council, Romulans, communication, Bajora, crystalline entities, disasters, addiction, reunification, time travel, parenting, telekinesis, eugenics, amnesia, possession, euthanasia, sexual repression, time warps, children, cover-ups, sexual attraction, imaginary friends, Borg, invisibility, alternative lives and phase shifting. Like Season Four most the episodes in Season Five have great stories, a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the life of the crew. It much more of the same as in Season Four with the better episodes being `Redemption, Part II', `Darmok' an interesting episode about language, the introduction of the Bajora and Ensign Ro, the Silicon Avatar makes a return, `Unification', Part I and II (both here) with Spock may be one of the most popular double episodes in the whole TNG franchise, certainly more popular than `Time's Arrow', Part I which ends this season with the possibility of something strange happening to Data on Earth. `The Masterpiece Society' shows what happens when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the outside world. Huge of Borg also makes his first appearance in `I, Borg'. Apart from the `Unification' double episode, the instalments `Ethics', about Worf undergoing a major controversial surgical operation and `The Game', when entertainment becomes mind control, have both achieved cult status as some of the best TNG episodes ever aired. Season Five unfortunately has some dull episodes too, many of which occur in the second half of the season, so the best stuff is within the first four discs. It doesn't really create much drive to push for a quick follow up with Season Six, but no doubt because Six is as good as Five was, then we are there for it. As a note: ""Redemption part II"" - this episode received a 12 age rating in the UK because it contains Klingon ritual head butting. `Violations' also has sexually violent content (psychic rape). Parents may want to be cautious and view those two episodes before showing it to children. If you are going to move onto Season Six then you will probably want to know that during Season Six the crew make contact with Deep Space Nine. So if you get Deep Space Nice: Season One you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order. If you are in for Six you may also be in for Season One of DS9!

1696649,3,B000063V8T,"Sadly, this season of TNG probably paved the way for the treacle that would be all too common in the following two seasons.  Season 5 contains an overabundance of human-interest stories and interpersonal story arcs, which are interspersed with too little action and adventure.  The series seemed to be running out of steam at this point and original stories were few.  Topics such as homosexuality, rape, father-son, and mother-daughter relationships abound with an overwhelming concentration on sentimentality. Deanna Troi's mother Lwaxana (Majel Barrett) makes an unwelcome return, by far one of the most annoying and obnoxious TNG characters. In arguably three of the worst TNG episodes are `Cost of Living' with the aforementioned Lwaxana introduces Alexander to her wild lifestyle.  Also, `Imaginary Friend' in which a little girls imaginary friend threatens the Enterprise, compelling huh? And finally  'Hero Worship' directed by Patrick Stewart no less.  In it Data becomes the de-facto guardian of an orphaned boy, in which the boy emulates Data's quirks and nuances to a nauseating degree.  However their are a couple of classic TNG episodes among the muck.  The intriguing 'I, Borg' and the exceptional 'The Inner Light', clearly one of the TNG's best.  These two and few other compelling episodes such as Unification Part 1 and 2, Ethics and Cause and Effect almost save this season.",1154217600,2,1394,5.3

Star trek TNG, is specially good, because is the beginning of the special effects (as all we know now) on TV series, if you see the first season, the special effects are not so great, even more, is a continuous of the Capt. Kirk's series. But when the seasons become better, the special effects become better too.

  In the Fifth season you will have the opportunity to see a great maturity in the characters; you'll see a Jean Luc, number one, a counselor, etc. more congruent, more chained in the series. In other words, you'll see not only special effects, you'll see better characters.

  About the script, you'll see better scripts, with an actuality, with a perspective from the outer space, or from an advanced society.

1696654,3,B000063V8T,"The DVDs themselves are of good quality; I've rented many seasons' worth and reminded myself which stories throughout the run were good and which were not...

$50 per season is on par and is a good price.  (So what's coming soon that's compelling people to buy these current sets?)

Wish I could afford it; thanks to the prices of necessities gone up so much (food, shelter, and distilled petroleum products being slightly more important than Captain Picard standing around as if he hasn't spent a penny in decades...), $50 is still an effective $100 out of my pocket in the end.

Season 5 really hits home with its depletion of cool sci-fi concepts, in lieu of more drivel drama, preachy society-parallels, and stereotypes. And technobabble to make everybody think the show is sci-fi anyway. And then there's the music.  Interesting music scores are replaced by what sounds like near-identical stock music for every single episode!!!  It grated very quickly and did NOTHING to help the quality of ANY of the stories...  it's dated badly too.

Redemption II:  Data seems to react very angrily toward prejudice aimed at him... and by 1992, making a 2D tachyon web is asinine when the Romulans can see the thing - and conceivable use WARP DRIVE AND GO AROUND IT IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.

Darmok:  Ignore that the alien language is just a mucked-up Yodafied English and the premise is noble.

Ensign Ro:  The producers finally figure it out that some friction on the Enterprise may be a good thing after all.  But the subplot is about as trite as anything they could find; occuptation of a malignant enemy.  Ro is a Bajoran and her enemy are the Cardassians...  Ro has potential...

Silicon Avatar:  Let's shatter the crystal for good; complete with huge tear-shedding subplot over the mother of a victim of the Silicon Entity that Lore used to destroy the Omicron colony...  (Datalore)  She transposes Lore for Data and just doesn't seem to get it.  And while the story is uber-preachy and far-fetched in its bubble-like dreamland, her decision to destroy the wretched crystal was the correct one.

Disaster:  More scientific inaccuracies and lamentable drivel-laden dialogue make this a disaster.  Movin' on.  (Ds9 has a similarly themed story too...)

The Game:  Wesley's first reappearance is well handled.  A stock ""Wesley saves the day because Riker got it on with an alien babe of the week"" plot, it's well handled - and a better anti-drug message to boot.  (they seem to do better when they DON'T try.)

Unification:  Part 1 is overly long; part 2 is the entertaining part.  Especially with ""cowboy diplomacy"" that made it clear Berman and his production team were never keen on Kirk's era.  (so why they had to bring back Kirk-era aliens, ideas, and crewmembers to bring in ratings remains a mystery...  well, not really...)

A Matter of Time:  Matt Frewer hams it up in a half-decent use of time travel.  Unfortunately, the gibber about CO2 is as ridiculous as it gets... and it's a core element to the story.  Ugh.

New Ground:  Worf subplot continues, though at this point it probably shouldn't have.

Hero Worship:  Candy bar winner of the year, come on down and pretend to be like Data!

Violations:  A GREAT story; the second I can properly recommend, apart from The Game.  Very well done.  Even the music isn't as annoying as it should be.

The Masterpiece Society:  Uberpreachy and ridiculous to the core; sometimes people HAVE to change in order to survive.  It seems our oh-so-noble Picard would rather have let the people die, saying ""Waaah, we shouldn't have broken the prime directive""?!  What a steaming pile this waste of celluloid is.

Conundrum:  Well, it tries.  An alien manipulates the Enterprise crew in an attempt to wipe out an enemy.  (with mental powers so great, why involve anyone else at all?)

Power Play:  Bad music hampers what is actually a decent action-based plot, particularly given the low nature of season 5; incorporeal aliens taking over bodies as they desire escape from a situation they're trapped in.

Ethics:  UGH!  As usual, when logic and the reality of risk-taking doesn't work, make stupid adjustments and contrivances to have it your way because your point of view is so much better, no thought is allowed...  Apparently, Worf has two brains too.  :rolleyes:

The Outcast Society:  Hmmm, the ""bold"" attempt at a pro-GLBT story has a bunch of sexless nitwits wanting to act like... HETEROSEXUALS?!  Even Jonathan Frakes has said he'd have preferred the androgynous person being ""male"" instead of ""female"".  (right on!!)  As usual, TNG does it best when they don't try to make social parallels:  Picard in ""Encounter at Farpoint"" gets it right when saying ""If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are.""  Besides, Berman never realized that Trek was about the human condition.  Not being preachy to an audience that obviously can't handle the topic as they had to go so far out of their way to make the topic as shrouded in as much abject doublespeak inanity as possible.

Cause and Effect:  Another time travel type plot, this one takes us inside the bottle.  A+++ for perspective.  C- for being repetitive; it is not enough material for 44 minutes; most of us had figured it out by act 2 anyway.

The First Duty:  Another moral piece; but Wesley is true to form.  I have a soft spot for it, however.

Cost of Living:  I dunno if I should laugh or cry...  Lwaxana introduced Alexander to the wild side of life and Worf thinks that she's got no business in dealing with Alexander.  Whatever, I may as well tune into a 2PM soap opera and get the same drivel...

The Perfect Mate:  I don't recall it, except it's got a love interest for Picard that wasn't to be his...  somewhat fun as I recall...

Imaginary Friend:  Another candy bar promotion winner?  Either way, this one is fun and I don't know why.  Others may or may not.  Kids will love it, regardless.

I, Borg:  Oh good.  Have even Guinan shed a tear for these Borg monsters... the net result of which being a bigger embarrassment, but that's next season...  ""Vendetta"" (the non-canon book) did a great job at continuing the Borg saga.  But I, Borg onward... puerile preachy garbage.

The Next Phase:  Sci-fi concepts, action, Romulan trechary?  yeah, there are some science logic gaffes but they're easy to ignore because this one is such a breath of fresh air!  The Geordi/Ro interaction is terrific too.  Highly underrated!

The Inner Light:  Overrated; I never saw what's so great about this...  of course, if it's the life Picard wanted to have instead then I can see the merit... it's just not my thing.

Time's Arrow:  I don't remember this one; except thinking it was all uneventful and uninspired.

All in all, the show has clearly gone downhill; but a few gems still remain.  Does the trend continue?  And will it turn around?",1138406400,4,6895,4.786018755328218

1696657,5,B000063V8T,"What can I say about a Series of boxed DVDs of ""Star Trek - The Next Generation"".

Just this: fantastic!

I used to own all the seven Seasons of PAL/VHS tapes and it was already an experience then.

But now. Wow!

I have bought only 6 of the 7 Seasons up to now and I bought them in NTSC format. Since I own a region free DVD player I have absolutely no problem in viewing them.

Some may argue that PAL DVDs are crispier than NTSC ones. Well, uless you are a laser scientist, you may not really notice the difference, and in my own personal experience on DVD there's no difference (given that the source is a pristine one).

Also, and in many cases it is true, expecially when we talk of Feature movies, the U.S. versions contain at least a second European language (either French or Spanish, sometimes both, sometimes even a German version is added and if not a dubbed version, then simply a subtilted version), which for people like me, who have guests that may not speak English is a great asset.

Star Trek alas, has no such luxury, but each box contains an extra DVD section (usually on the last one, which is crammed with useful and interesting information about the entire Season and about some key episodes within it).

Sharpness of the image is there (as it was for the Three Seasons of Star Trek - The Original Series). Excellent color balance and contrast information. Compare it even with PAL VHS tapes and you will see the astonishing difference.

Sound on all DVDs, has truly received the royal treatment of Digital Remastering and although the first three seasons were produced in conventional Dolby Stereo (at the time of production this was still the standard), they now sound far more ""rounded up"" and crisp with the musical track in Surround. Starting from Season Four, you get to be treated with true 5.1 Surround.

I am a fan of Star Trek, but a quiet, objective and sometimes overly criticizing one. Especially when it comes to Enterprise.

But believe me when I say that they won't ever make such a Series anymore, unless tendencies will tend to sway from simple ""money-grabbing-stupid-content"" back to ""hard-working-well-written"" ones again.

Even a non-Trekkie or non-Trekker will enjoy at least the first two incarnations of Star Trek.

The secret being, that these are far less Science Fiction tales, but rather tales of the human adventure in a possible future.

The key being very actual problems with which we are all faced in our daily lives.

The Alien factor is often used as a ""replacement"" for the ""racial"" or ""social"" denominator, giving the author a certain freedom to tackle with many crucial and controversial social issues.

The result is always a very interesting and gripping ""voyage"" into the unknown, space being just part of the decorum.

The crews of both ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Trek - The Next Generation"" are all highly talented actors, who bring true life to their characters and to the situations they are involved in.

There is also a well-balanced dose of humor in some episodes, which is always helpful in order not to fall into a gloomy pit of self-glorification.

Although I haven't yet bought ""Deep Space Nine"" or ""Voyager"" I may not be able to comment on them, but in view of the fact that they too, have been produced by Paramount, as well as their Feature Movies, I can only assume that the quality may be the same as the ones I already mentioned.

The boxes are rather conventional, compared with The Original Series which look like the old Medical Kit in ""three flavors"" (Golden Yellow, Medical Blue and Burgundy Red). The Next Generation comes in Silvery Boxes, with differently colored fonts, all coded-colors obviously. They are meant to represent the various professional specializations aboard the Enterprise-D.

Once opened, tucked in an internal flip box, this time fully code-colored, are the six to seven DVDs (depending on how many episodes a Season had). Generally three on one side, and another three to four on the other. As said, the last DVD always contains the special presentations and interviews.

A booklet containing a brief episode description is also ""tucked in"" within a special sleeve.

Every DVD contains four episodes.

The Menus are very intuitive and divided in theme, by Season.

One represents the Command LCARS Console, Two the Engineers LCARS Console, Three the Medical LCARS Console and so forth and so on (mind you, I am citing them by memory, the actual order may elude me now).

Anyway and in conclusion, this is truly a worthwile set to buy if you mean to entertain your entire family or just your friends with an intelligent, well-written and well-done bunch of TV episodes of one of the most creative minds Hollywood has ever met, (except of course, for others like Ray Bradbury, Rod Serling or Arthur C. Clarke): Gene Roddenberry.

You won't regret this choice, this is for sure.",1122940800,3,4880,4.7785714285714285
1696658,5,B000063V8T,"Nominated for 58 Emmys, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation fulfilled all the potential and promise anticipated of a long-awaited successor to the original 1960s series - Star Trek. Created by a former L.A. police officer, Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) became the first TV series to follow on the heels of the original, and its success would spark the creation of three additional series - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). But The Next Generation remained the most popular spin-off. Despite new characters and new episodes, the mission remained the same as before - ""to boldly go where no man has gone before..."" And to continue the rich tradition of the Star Trek name - a mission Star Trek: The Next Generation accomplishes with relative ease...

Star Trek: The Next Generation takes place in the 24th Century, almost one-hundred years after Captain Kirk's crew set out to explore strange new worlds. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart - I Claudius) commands the USS Enterprise-D and its diverse crew of humans, cyborgs, and varying life forms. Accompanying him on his voyage is an entirely new cast of passengers and crew including Commander William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes - North & South), Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby), Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), and her son Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton)... Together, they struggle against numerous obstacles to carry out the mission of the USS Enterprise: ""To explore strange new worlds... To seek out new life; new civilizations... To boldly go where no one has gone before!"" This pioneering attitude, coupled with imaginative and brilliantly-produced alien worlds, provides Star Trek with its unique allure and special place within American pop culture - especially those episodes from the original series, widely regarded as the most popular of the Star Trek franchise...

The Star Trek: The Next Generation (Season 5) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Redemption"" in which Capt. Picard postulates that the Romulans are behind the recent outbreak of civil war within the Klingon Empire, and he must persuade the Federation to intervene before the war annihilates the Klingon Empire and cripples their ally... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include ""A Matter of Time"" in which a man who claims to be from the future visits the USS Enterprise, and ""The First Duty"" in which the performance of an outlawed and dangerous maneuver by Starfleet Academy cadets leads to a scandal, with Wesley caught in the middle...

1696659,4,B000063V8T,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" season five is a satisfying season of episodes well worth owning, though like previous seasons it's hardly perfect.  In fact, this set seems to feature three distinct groups of eight or so episodes each: a group of excellent episodes (""Darmok"", ""The First Duty"", and ""The Inner Light"" among them); a group of good/very good episodes (the Spock two-parter, the cool ""Cause and Effect"" time anomaly show, ""The Masterpiece Society"", etc.); and a final group of barely fair or outright poor episodes (""Imaginary Friend"" and ""Ethics"" come to mind here).  But even the not very good episodes are somewhat easier to take on DVD, as the really nice picture and sound and lack of commercials make them go down a lot easier than when they originally aired, or when they're seen now in re-runs. The extras this time out continue to be excellent, and are especially noteworthy in this set because considerable time is spent paying tribute to Gene Roddenberry, who had died during season five's original run.  Anyway, if you've been picking up the previous boxed sets of this series, there's no reason to stop now.  There's plenty of entertaining, thoughtful fun here.",1118707200,2,1188,4.984848484848484

The last episode on each disc gets cut off a little over half way through!  Can you think of anything more frustrating than being in the middle of a great episode you've never seen before and have it end before the conflict is even resolved?  Be wary!  I don't see any that cheap now, but sometimes it's worth paying full price from a legitimate source.",1110585600,,528,4.458333333333333
1696661,4,B000063V8T,"Well you have to like it that next gen finally broke down and used Spock, but my only problem is they kind of made him out to be this peaceful idiot. A little more wisdom from Spock would have been nice and more scenes with him and Data would have been nice but for the most part a good episode arc.

My highlights for the season go against what I usually like from Trek. My favorite show was actually Inner Light where Picard lives an alternate life that really takes place over a 30 minute period where he is knocked unconscious. It finally gave me a little insight into Picard and made him human where none of the other seasons had done that for me.

The season as a whole was decent. Highlights were adding a protagonist like Ensign Ro aboard the Enterprise. Most of the time I liked this addition to the crew, but periodically it was ridiculous, like her advice to ""Captain"" Troi on the episode Disaster. I also greatly enjoyed Conundrum where characters don't realize who they are and Warf thinks he is the captain.

Lowlights for me have to be one of the most overhyped terrible episodes in Trek lore and thats Darmok. What a load of babble this show was. I actually fell asleep watching it because of how amazingly boring it was.

The season ender was decent but I was having trouble figuring out if they were going for humor, drama, or what with the plot. The use of Mark Twain, though ridiculous was fine with me. I thought the throw away comment by Twain when he reaches the Enterprise-have you ever seen Halleys Comet was humorous though. (to those who don't know, Twain was born the day the comet appeared and died the day it reappeared 75 years later)",1104796800,2,1665,4.431372549019608

I have just one phrase to sum up the season: HORRAY FOR SPOCK!  Many great and interesting episodes with a few duds thrown in, but overall a great season.

 Like season four, this season also has the split scene for the clips, with two playing in each window. It cuts down on waiting to see the clip of all four episodes, but it is a little difficult to follow if you're not sure you've seen all four of the episodes.

Only one small complaint about formatting. I normally skip the prolog ""Space, the final frontier ..."" and go to the second track. However, the second track does not always take you to the begining of the first scene after the ""commercial break"". As a rule of thumb, if after 5 seconds you don't see the name of the episode, track back until you do. You could be missing up to 5 minutes!!!",1058227200,3,613,4.339130434782609
1696675,4,B000063V8T,"The fifth season of Star Trek TNG begins with the Klingon Empire in the midst of a civil war, and ends with Mark Twain.  In between these two episodes lies a season of mostly great drama.  I have previously written that seasons three and four were, in my opinion, TNG at its best.  The fifth season continued to give us great entertainment, but we encounter a few more clunkers than we did in the previous two seasons.  Others have mentioned that ""Cost of Living,"" and ""Imaginary Friend,"" were less than impressive and I have to agree.  I also felt that ""New Ground,"" and ""Hero Worship,"" left much to be desired.  Still, the few poor episodes are far outnumbered by great ones.  For me, the brightest of the gems was the two-part story, ""Unification,"" in which Spock makes his reappearance.  It was a real treat for those of us who are fans of the original series to see our favorite Vulcan again.  This story is what drew me to TNG and I stayed with it.  More than that, Spock's character was interwoven with the continuing plot thread involving the Romulans.  Since the beginning of the third season, the writers did a commendable job in maintaining ongoing plot threads with other major races, including the Romulans, Klingons and later, the Cardassians.  ""Unification,"" is an excellent example of this.  In the second part of ""Unification,"" we meet Tassha Yarr's evil Romulan daughter Sela, whom we first encounter in the season premier/second part of ""Redemption.""  Also in the fifth season, we get to meet the fiery Ensign Ro, played to perfection by Michelle Forbes.  Forbes is one of the few actors who found life after Star Trek, including major roles in the hit television series, ""Homicide, Life on the Street,"" and ""24.""  Wesley Crusher returns in two episodes, ""The Game,"" and ""The First Duty.""  Some of us aren't big Wes fans and it was nice to see him knocked from his idealistic pedestal in the latter.  We get to see Picard as a family man in, ""The Inner Light,"" and that episode produced one of the most beautiful musical scores I've come across in Star Trek.  ""I Borg,"" is powerful drama at its best as we watch Picard wrestle with the trauma of his ordeal with the Borg.  The scene when he first confronts Hughe is priceless.  It is similar to what might happen when a rape victim confronts her attacker and it showed a vulnerable side to Picard that we seldom see.  ""Darmok,"" is also a great episode in that it demonstrates how lack of adequate communication can make or break relations between two cultures.  Other noteworthy episodes include ""Cause and Effect,"" ""Power Play,"" ""Disaster,"" ""A Matter of Time,"" and ""The Next Phase.""  Unfortunately, the season climaxes with my least favorite of the two-part shows, ""Time's Arrow.""  The time-travel scenarios have been done to death on Star Trek and the use of Mark Twain was ridiculous.  Still, despite the few bad eggs, the fifth season of TNG is worth owning, whether you're just getting started or a long-time Trek fan.",1058140800,3,2992,4.738878143133462
1696676,4,B000063V8T,"Previous reviewers have hit the high points of Season 5, which include Inner Light (best ep of the year and one of the best in the entire series), Time's Arrow, Damrok, and Ensign Ro. There are also a run of pretty good episodes, including Ethics, Disaster, The Perfect Mate, and A Matter of Time. Even when you take another step down to the average stuff, such as Unification, Cause and Effect, Silicon Avatar, Violations, The Next Phase, and so on, it's reasonably engaging SciFi fare that while I can joke about the writing, I still enjoy.
However, there are also a slightly uncomfortable number of episodes here that range from boring and/or obvious (Hero Worship, Connundrum, Cost of Living, Power Play) down to the truly awful (The Game, The Outcast). What's with the kids? So many episodes in this season have small children as central or major characters, it gets a little tiresome at some point. I thought Star Trek: TNG had gotten past that phase with the departure of Wesley. And what's with alien possession thing? A lot of those eps also, given it's not exactly a great plot device. At least the holodeck seems to be out of commission for a while.
It's interesting to see the texture - much like Seasons 3 and 4, Season 5 starts out with a so-so cliffhanger resolution, but then picks up with a number of very strong episodes - only to fade hard and fast in the middle, but redeem itself with generally strong final episodes.
So as with some previous seasons, I have to sigh, and say yes, as a Star Trek fan, I'm glad I have this season, which has some very nice highlights and eps that are fun to watch. But, as I work my way through the new DVD releases, I am always shocked at just how uneven the writing is; especially in light of the new standards that have been set by Babylon 5 and especially the X-Files (compare Cause and Effect, an episode I thought was good at the time, to the X-Files Season 6 episode ""Monday"" - same premise, almost exactly the same general idea, but see how much more skillfully it's executed by that show). A somewhat unfortunate feature of Season 5 is the preponderance of ""soft"" episodes, episodes that focus on characters and ideas more than plot. Sometimes (The Inner Light, The Perfect Mate, The Masterpiece Society), their efforts are very impressive; then they turn around and churn out Ethics, The Game, The Outcast, or The First Duty, which feel more like being beaten with a club. Then there are episodes like Power Play, in which things happen for the sole reason that they have to happen to set up later things. Entire scenes are frequently wasted with worthless technobabble, a tradition unique to Star Trek that continues to this day, and that they could afford to lose. Opportunities for real character exploration are routinely missed. Episodes with dual plot lines rarely support each other.
So as I say, I'm a bit conflicted. A few really good eps; it's impossible to say too many good things about Inner Light or Darmok. Many solid ones, a few terrible ones; inconsistent writing even in episodes that generally succeeed; not a terrifically consistant season. I'm still happy with my purchase, but realistically these DVDs remain too expensive in my opinion, and I wish they had been a bit cheaper or better.",1049846400,7,3272,4.682291666666667
1696677,5,B000063V8T,"Season five in so many ways, is just an absolutely incredible season that is packed with stunning, thought provoking episodes.  As one watched these shows aired for the first time or is working their way through the DVD's, the quality of the writing and the actors comfort with their characters just becomes better and better by the episode.  The shows popularity is at an all time high during this season.  This is evidenced by the high quality of the scripts and shows that deal with so many issues brilliantly.  The one true oddity about the season is the lack of a ""Q"" episode due to the lack of a good script for the character.  Of key interest is the fact that more and more of Hollywood's big names were inquiring about and or getting spots on the show.  In my opinion, many of the series best episodes of its seven year run came from this season.
The following is a list with a synopsis of episodes that stand out among all of the great episodes of the season:
Redemption part II - The outstanding conclusion to season fours season ending cliffhanger.  Introducing the return of Denise Crosby in the role of Commander Sela, Tasha Yar's daughter; this brings us back to the events of ""Yesterdays Enterprise.""  Here we are treated to some of the best Klingon scenes of the entire series.
Darmok - Paul Winfield, better known in the Star Trek universe from Star Trek II, makes a guest appearance.  This episode is quite intriguing in how Captain Picard and crew have to come up with a way to communicate with the Children of Tama, whose language is indecipherable, hopefully before Captain Picard gets killed.
Ensign Ro - The introduction of Michelle Forbes in the role of Ensign Ro Laren and the Bajoran people which will become quite prominent in Star Trek Deep Space Nine.  Her addition to the cast at least in a part time status, is an outstanding addition, even for a show that really didn't need it.
Disaster - A great episode in which we get to see Counselor Troi in charge and Worf assist in the birth of Chief O'Brien's and Keiko's daughter, which is extremely humorous.
The Game - This is an interesting episode about Riker meeting a woman who introduces him to an ""addictive"" game.  This episode also marks the first appearance of Ashley Judd as Ensign Robin Lefler.
Unification parts I & II - In no uncertain terms, this episode is among the tops in the series whole seven year run.  Leonard Nimoy's appearance as Ambassador Spock and the intrigue involved is gripping to say the least.  The conversation between Spock and Data is highly enlightening into both characters.
Ethics - This episode stands out because of its Klingon mythology aspect, bringing even further along in how the Klingon culture deals with issues, such as this one, suicide due to injury.
Cause and Effect - I just thoroughly enjoy how this episode was done.  The Enterprise is caught in a causality loop.  This causes them to repeat several days, over and over again, always ending in disaster until they figure out a way to stop it.  Kelsey Grammer makes a brief but endearing guest appearance.
The First Duty - The Enterprise is home at earth, with Captain Picard planning on giving the commencement speech for Starfleet Academy.  Wesley Crusher makes an appearance and he's part of Nova Squadron which is an Academy flying team.  They've had an accident and there is an investigation.  This episode has some of the best conflict between the characters out of the entire series.  In this episode, we also finally get to see what the Academy looks like and meet Boothby, played by Ray Walston.
The Perfect Mate - This episode truly stands out among the shows of the entire series.  Newcomer Famke Janssen appears a Kamala.  She is a Metamorph, a woman who is empathic and in the final stages of her ""maturing"" process bonds perfectly with the man she meets when she comes out of stasis.  Hers and Patrick Stewart's performance are exceptional!
The Next Phase - This is a great Ro Laren and LaForge episode that deals with what is initially thought of as their deaths.  This show is very ingeniously written!
The Inner Light - This episode is by far the best of the season and among the top five of the entire series!  Patrick Stewart's performance is heartfelt and touching and should've won him many awards!  The Enterprise encounters an alien probe which ""attaches"" itself to him and he then lives a lifetime in the span of twenty five minutes.  This is a beautiful episode which bears many viewings!
Time's Arrow part I - The season ending cliffhanger.  While not being one of the best cliffhangers of the series, this one is still quite interesting as the crew deals with time travel and Guinan takes a prominent position in the script.  Jerry Hardin's performance as Samuel Clemens is marvelous!
Special Features:
Mission Overview:  Year Five
Departmental Briefing:  Year Five, Production & Visual Effects
Memorable Missions:  Year Five
A Tribute to Gene Roddenberry - This special feature above all others, offsets the costs of the DVD sets as it is priceless, especially the surprise ending!
Also included:
A separate mini-CD containing some great Star Trek Nemesis wallpapers, screensavers and a theatrical trailer.
A Season Five Bonus Featurette containing a great ""Intergalactic Guest Stars"" clip that is enlightening!  Also included is ""Alien Speak"" which is a wonderful clip about how some of the alien writings and speech came about!  {ssintrepid}

1696678,4,B000063V8T,"Season 5 was a mixed season, with a few episodes shining as gems and others easily forgotten. The opening episodes, which include ""Redemption Part II, Darmok, and Ensign Ro"" are examples of truly magnificant episodes which define Trek. Darmok, which inolves communication with an alien race, stands out as one of the best episodes of the season.
Two big episodes were ""I, Borg"" and ""The Inner Light"". ""I, Borg"" has been critized because it injects humanity into Trek's coldest villains. The message in this episode is what stands out, however, as both Guinan and Picard have to deal with their feelings towards the Borg, and it conveys a powerful message about prejeduce. ""The Inner Light"" is an incredible episode in which Picard wakes up in another life and experiences things that he could never have aboard the Enterprise, including a family.
However, there are episodes which take away from this season. Two episodes, ""The Cost of Living"" and ""Imaginary Friend"" are examples of such. Nothing gets accomplished and the only feeling received after viewing these episodes is something akin to relief that you can move on to a better one. Finally, Season 5 is the only season which does not feature an episode with Q, everyone's favorite God. Still, anyone who enjoys Trek will be able to see past minor flaws and take comfort in watching some brilliant episodes.",1047168000,5,1364,4.960698689956332
1696679,5,B000063V8T,"After the third and fourth season, STAR TREK: TNG showed no intention of slowing down. And it never did.
The fifth season stars out with REDEMPTION: PART II. The fourth and last part of the rough quadrilogy involving Worf is by far the best of them all. It starts with a spaceship fight and never lets up. 10 times better than the first part.
What made this season so great was that it had many guest stars and character-based episodes:
1) In THE GAME and DARMOK, Ashley Judd guest stars.
2) Leonard Nimoy returns as Spock in UNIFICATION, PART II. There is a priceless conversation between Data and Spock in that episode.
3) Kelsey Grammer makes a brief apperance in CAUSE AND EFFECT.
4) Famke Janssen appears in THE PERFECT MATE. (She would later star with Patrick Stewart in X-MEN)
5) Ray Walston makes a memorable appearance in THE FIRST DUTY. Will Wheaton is in that episode as well and delivers a great performance.
6) In THE NEXT PHASE, La Forge and Ro get some time to deliver some good performances
7) ETHICS is a great Worf episode.
Also in this season were many funny and intersting episodes:
1) In DISASTER, Data's head is removed, Worf helps to deliver a baby, and Troi must run the bridge. Good stuff.
2) In POWER PLAY, Data, Troi, and O'Brien go renegade and take over Ten-Forward. Very cool.
3) I, BORG was a great episode. Very intersting. And watch for Hugh to come back late in the 6rth season...
Unfortunately, there were some bad episodes as well. IMAGINARY FRIEND and COST OF LIVING were horrible. Watch for yourself. (LWAXANA taking a MUD BATH?!?!?!?! Please, no!!!!!!!)
And last, the season's last episode, TIME'S ARROW. Unfortunately, it's not that great. Data accidentally goes back in time and meets Jack London, Mark Twain, and others while trying to stop aliens (again). Some of it is funny, but you're gonna have to wait until the end of the 6th season for a REALLY GREAT SEASON FINALE.
All in all, a great and crucial season.
1991-1992; all episodes are rated PG for mild sci-fi violence and breif language.",1045612800,4,2037,4.661111111111111
1696680,5,B000063V8T,"Sure, seasons 3 and 4 were great, but season 5 is where everything starts to feel comfortable. Season 4 was the setup, the ultimate test for TNG to see if it really could boldly go. Season 5 is the confirmation that it passed.
It opens with the excellent conclusion to one of the best two-parters, ""Redemption."" New areas are explored with the Klingons and Romulans. This is the best season premiere of the whole series, loaded with plot twists, space fights, and some more character development.
What continues in the season are the greatest episodes of the series. In ""Unification pts. 1-2,"" the crew finally meet Spock and the ""unification"" between the two series is complete. Wesley the weasel gets in trouble at Starfleet in ""The First Duty,"" proving that the little twerp really can make mistakes. But the episode is also great in that we learn more about Picard's training at the academy. Another great episode is the remarkable ""Darmok,"" in which Picard and an alien captain are trapped on a planet with a deadly monster. The two have incredible trouble communicating, but it turns into a bonding experience for both of them, turning in one of the best ""Trek"" episodes ever. In another remarkable episode, ""The Inner Light,"" Picard is zapped by an alien probe and sent into a coma. While thirty minutes go by on the ship, Picard experiences a lifetime on another world.
Season 5 of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" boldly goes where no other Trek series has gone before. It has all of the Trek elements perfectly in tact and is also one of the best years of any television show. No fan of good science fiction should be without it.",1044489600,3,1639,4.714285714285714
1696681,5,B000063V8T,"Season 5 is by far, the best of STTNG. ""The Inner Light"" allows viewers a rare chance to see Capt. Picard as a family man and has a touching and memorable conclusion. ""Darmok"" explores the importance of communication and the lengths to which an alien Captain will go to to establish communication. Also a touching, memorable episode.

1696683,4,B000063V8T,"As I review this season I have watched Seasons 1-5 (but not 6 or 7).  In my subjective opinionl this one ranks second, surpassed only by Season 3.
Having said that, this season contains the single best Star Trek episode I've ever seen: The Inner Light, which won television's Peabody Award.  And rightly so--even the most hard-boiled viewer will find this episode to be moving and unforgettable.  I cannot imagine anyone failing to appreciate the impact of this superb episode.
This collection has lots of other strong episodes as well.  This is the season that introduces the lovely ""Ro Laren"" character.  She's hot, and a definite plus.

1696687,5,B000063V8T,"It's hard to beat the third season of ST:TNG for its combination of the first two years' original-Trek-esque weirdness and more subtle modern sensibilities, but if any season of the show even comes close to edging out year 3 as my favorite, this is it.  Season 5 was the year of brainy gems like Darmok and The First Duty, heart-on-the-sleeve classics like The Inner Light and The Perfect Mate, and good kooky fun with The Game, Conundrum, and A Matter of Time.  There are a few dead-on-arrival entries too (including the series' all-time worst, Imaginary Friend), but it's hard to find a year of the series that doesn't have at least a couple of those.  There are more bonuses than usual, the best of which is a touching tribute to Gene Roddenberry (who died during the production of the fifth season).  It's also nice to see the visual FX guys get their own featurette - as nice as CGI is, it's good to remember that sometimes modelwork can get it done better, and perhaps even cheaper (the eight-story power generator that was only as tall as a fluorescent light tube).  My only gripe is that I wish they'd space these out a little more for seasons 6 and 7 - some of us can scarcely afford to pop a hundred on one of these puppies every month.  Then again, in the Star Trek spinoff library (and not counting Enterprise), Paramount has the equivalent of 21 years of television to roll out in DVD form, so I suppose they're making sure it doesn't take 21 years to make it to market.  It's a no-win scenario.  But, that said, this set is a winner.",1036886400,6,1547,4.460992907801418
1696688,5,B000063V8T,"I appreciate that Paramount has finally released TNG seasons on DVD. Now if they could only get it right. First off, season five was another outstanding season. The Inner Light stands as one of the most touching and powerful episodes of any television show. Also, the tie in to Star Trek VI with Spock is one of the best written episodes of season five.
The picture quality is so-so. It looks sharper than VHS but is a little soft on many of the episodes. The extras are pretty skimpy with a interviews with various cast and production members about various episodes. It's not bad but it would have been far more inviting to have some actor/director/writer/producer commentaries. Still, the dual layer DVD's included in this set are the one of the fewStar Trek: TNG where I haven't had a some sort of flaw (the season three set had picture problems, dialog somehow out of synch, etc.). So Paramount has gotten the manufacturing difficulties out of the way.
The packaging is very nice all except the booklet. It would be nice to see some sort of overview on the season, comments, etc. Considering the amount of $ your paying I don't think this is too much to ask.
On the positive side--many of these episodes are among the best Trek produced. They also stand as some of the best science fiction, no, scratch that, drama produced for either television or the movies during the 90's. TNG was equaled (with some episodes and the story arcs that were developed they actually surpassed TNG) by the complex Deep Space Nine (which, by the way, is still not available on DVD thank you very much).
If you're a Trek fan, I'd recommend this set although I wish Paramount had included more extras. TNG surpassed The Original Series in terms of scope, writing, acting and optical effects.",1036713600,7,1774,4.689102564102564
1696689,5,B000063V8T,"Season FIVE of the beloved Star Trek NG was incredible because of the ongoing character development. ALL of the major characters, of which there are many, are maturing and incredibly distinct from one another. From acting, writing and plot development - Season Five was incredible year for the NG team. The show is just now getting ripe and boy, oh boy, does it taste good! ;)",1031702400,6,376,4.712121212121212
1696690,5,B000063V8T,"This is the only season I really want, as it is by far the best.  Seasons 3 and 4 were good, but without the polishing and wonderful dialogue & writing of the fifth year. After the peak of the fifth year, things went downhill, with the two-parter-saturated sixth and seventh years, where technobabble soared and real storytelling declined.
The fifth year can boast two of Star Trek's best episodes: ""Darmok"", a truly Star Trek episode, one where you actually think there are real aliens that don't look and talk like your next door neighbor; ""The Inner Light"", which, along with DS9's ""The Visitor"" are the only two Trek episodes I ever actually teared up at - is truly outstanding.
I thought ""Unification"" was okay, but I think Spock probably deserved a less political and more sci-fi storyline, ""The Game"" was fun (just love to see chases through the Enterprise), I thought Ro Laren (""Ensign Ro"", ""The Next Phase""), etc."" was a great secondary character I wished we'd seen more of; I just liked that there was someone who didn't just fall into the stuffy chain of command.
Overall a solid season with outstanding episode after episode. Other goodies include ""Disaster"", ""A Matter of Time"", ""Conundrum"", ""Power Play"", ""Ethics"", ""Cause and Effect"", ""I, Borg"" & ""Time's Arrow"".",1031529600,26,1276,4.907407407407407
1696691,5,B000063V8T,"This was a great season of the next generation, in fact it was the season that got me hooked on the show.  It did have a few stincker episodes like 'imaginary friend' and 'the perfect mate', but i don't want to get into them.  I want to talk about the episodes that left the rest of tv-and science fiction, looking at what was possible.
First off there was 'Cause and Effect' similar to the theme behind Stephen King's the 'Waste Lands' as the Enterprise gets caught in a causality loop, throwing it back and forth in time, always to end in the same devistating outcome.  Great cameo by Frasier Crane to boot.
The next great episode was 'Unification parts 1&2' they brought back Spock with an amazing, Spock worthy tale.  He is still fighting for what he believes in and he still has his damn vulcan stubburness.  Great sparring matches with Picard while they try to develop peace between the Federation and Romulons.
'The Next Phase' is a personal favorite of mine as it looks at the relationship between Ricker and Ro, in a subtle fashion.  Ro and Geordy seem to have died and as the crew try to put on a wake, while helping the devious romulons get back into romulous space, Geordy and Ro try to stop the Romulons plot and bring their lives back together at the same time.  There were holes in the story, like how did their shoes retain contact with the decks?  But other than that it is lots a fun.  Other not worthy eps include 'Ensign Ro', ""Cost of Living', my personal season ender(behind Best of Both Worlds) was Times Arrow.
The episode that i really want to talk about.  If you haven't seen it, i won't give any of it away, but to this day, this episode has a deeper effect on the way I think than any TV show I have ever seen, it introduced me to brilliant Sci/fi and radical thinking,  ""The Inner Light"".  This episode starts with the crew finding a derilect satillite floating through space.  Well Picard gets trasported  ""Somewhere else"" and the greatest journey begins.  It asks us to open our eyes, look around and appreciate what we have, but nothing is forever-NOTHING.  Not even diamonds.  Our memories fade, loved ones die, and worlds collapse.  It is perspective and dream recall, amalgamated into posssibly the greatest short story since ""Plato's Allegory of the Cave"".  Enjoy",1031011200,20,2298,4.588235294117647

Time's Arrow, Part I -- After Data learns of his own death in late 19th-century San Francisco, a freak accident transports him back to that period.",1023148800,169,4694,4.996168582375479
1696693,5,B000063V8T,"At this point in the series the show had been running smoothly for several years and had built up a serious following. Thus, the result is a season with consistently solid writing, the usual high standard of acting and some wonderfully innovative special effects pices (no longer does the viewer sit there cursing tyhe series for not having a bigger budget like seasons 1 and 2).
Arguably fifth season was the apex of the series, where everything was running smoothly and week after week the show was churning out classics. Whie I personally don't believe this is the best year (I prefer season 3,4 and 6), fifth season has many episodes which rank in any Trekkers top twenty (sadly I have one).
Redemption II opens things with a relative bang and thankfully puts to an end the lengthy Klingon civil war saga. Warf's family name is cleared and he rejoins the crew of the Enterprise (I think everyone knew this would happen anyway).
Darmok, the season's second episode is undoubtedly one of the show's best moments. Patrick Stewart turns in a virtuso performance alongside Paul Winfield (remember him in Terminator?). Some of the season's other high points are, Cause and Effect in which the Enterprise gets caught in a time loop only to find Frasier at the other end, The Game, a Wesley Crusher comeback special, I Borg, an exploration in humanity with a lone Borg, and The Next Phase, arguably Geordi's best episode to himself (Booby Trap is up there).
Then we have the peabody winning 'The Inner Light' which is certainly one of the show's most touching and well written episodes.
Unfortunately there are a few episodes that suffer from the old ""Shakka when the walls fell syndrome"" ... The Masterpiece Society is as banal as any episode and Violation is another clunker but these are only minor bumps int he road.
A fine effort of a season with an intelligent and savvy cliffhanger.",1022284800,6,1885,4.785276073619632
