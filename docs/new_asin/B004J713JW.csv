4390612,5,B004J713JW,"After watching the"" Last play at Shea"" documentary dvd tonight and being at that awesome show myself  I'll be definitely getting this on bluray the second it comes out. What a thrill it was to see Roger Daultrey, Steven Tyler, Tony Bennett and Garth  Brooks perform that night- and what can I say about my main man Billy himself?- in a word-GREAT!, and when Sir Paul came out at the end to sing ""Let it be""- it was the perfect ending to a night that I'll never forget. You'd be an absolute fool not to buy this!.",1298332800,5,512,4.268041237113402

One could argue about the song selection, lots of guest so not pure Joel (which is why I pinged it a star) but a fan would definitely want to check it out.  Recommended probably essential for Big Fans.",1516406400,,281,4.365384615384615
4390618,5,B004J713JW,"Hes been my favorite musician throughout my adult life. A classical pianist, a storyteller through lyrics, and a uniquely wonderful voice make him the complete musical package.

me, but they are-----most certainly-----still worth our

4390628,3,B004J713JW,"Great production values and surprise guest stars.  I loved the song selection especially hearing so many old songs.

I'm calling b.s. on that. I almost didn't get this due to those reviews, but thankfully took the chance.
I hate when a blu ray comes out and you expect a certain quality and it isn't there. So realise I started my review the way I did for a reason.
If you like Billy Joel it's a great set list. He is singing very well. The mix is good. The video quality is good.",1495929600,4,446,4.1976744186046515
4390641,5,B004J713JW,this is a great concert to be at in person and the DVD does a great job of capturing the environment and mood of the last event at Shea Stadium. Quality of the Blu-ray is incredible. Set list as well as guests make this a must own.,1495238400,,231,3.9361702127659575

4390651,5,B004J713JW,"I really love collecting concert DVD/Blu-rays, but have had some questions to ""All Region"" Blu-rays. Are they playable on a basic Sony Blu-ray player? From what I've read, there shouldn't be a problem. This question may seem odd, but since moving many times until the past 5 years due to my job; I have never bought a Blu-Ray player, but have been buying Blu-ray discs for the time I can set up an affordable HDTV (4K) or whatever is next and a home theater setup. I bought a home theater in a box set up 10 years ago and I have never taken it out of the box! It's a nice Sony rear speaker wireless system, but the receiver/player is just an upscale DVD player. The speakers are still modern enough to use today, but obviously I will have to upgrade the player or piggy back a Sony Blu-Ray player to it. No one seems to be able to give me a straight answer I can trust. Salespeople are the worst and many of my friends can't relate. I'm hoping that all these ""All Region"" Blu-Rays that I have in my collection will play in a standard U.S./North American player. Any help on this topic would be greatly appreciated. Clapton has a great new concert DVD coming out on 3/10/17 and the Blu-Ray version is ""All Regions"" and sold under the Reprise label. I hope I won't end up kicking my own rear end in the future if these ""All Region"" Blu-rays won't play or cause problems either by not playing or having to go through 25 separate settings each time I want to watch a concert to get the disc to play. Thanks!",1488326400,,1503,4.295774647887324

His guest list is staggering...John Mayer, Tony Bennett, Sir Paul McCartney, Stephen Tyler, Roger Daltrey, et al.  But, it's Billy's show, and what a show it is.  He sings songs from his entire career, which is a long and brilliant one.  He still sounds great...and for a sports stadium, the sound is extremely good.  I'd give this DVD my highest possible rating...it's great, Billy's great, his band's great, the guests are great...well, you get my drift.  Buy this DVD, take it home and crank it up.

I guess I am only a semi-Billy Joel fan who mostly enjoys his top-40 hits.  However, this rendition of Piano Man is better than the single.  It is one of my favorite songs of all time.  I bought this dvd to play on our outside movie screen for my guests.  It has exceptional audio and visual qualities on the 16 foot outdoor screen.  I think I am liking it more as I write this review............RJB",1440806400,,506,4.434782608695652

4390752,4,B004J713JW,"This is really a 4.5. I would have loved to give it a 5, but a lackluster ending wouldn't allow it. Yes, I'm sure Piano Man sandwiched between two Paul McCartney songs was nothing short of magical in person. But watching and listening from afar, a clearly exhausted Billy struggling through the first and an old Paul trying to sing like a young Paul (instead of adjusting his voice downward) on the other two marred this 'encore"" for me.
BTW, am I the only one a bit tired of the whole 'encore' charade of everyone leaving, then coming back, locking heads like they're making things up on the fly and then doing what they had planned all along? Billy leaving without doing Piano Man? Paul just happening to be there? Right!

But, since everyone does it, I don't count it against the rating. My criticism of the ending aside (and I realize most folks will disagree or care less), this is still one of the best produced and directed videos I've ever seen. The camera work is astonishingly good (including aerial shots
from outside the stadium). The song list is excellent, although this video is actually a compilation of two shows, so a lot of other good stuff got left out. All the backup musicians, singers and guest stars (save one) are superb.

A few special moments for me were Tony Bennett on New York State Of Mind, what occurred during She's Always A Woman To Me (won't spoil it for those that haven't seen it), the first-responder tribute (even though equating their work and sacrifice  with Vietnam soldiers through Goodnight Saigon was a bit of a stretch IMO) and the first 'encore' of Scenes From An Italian Restaurant. Oh, and a quick peek in the crowd during Only The Good Die Young of a woman Billy used to know pretty well (look for her just past the 1:58 mark .

All in all, I still highly recommend this video (with the one reservation). Billy Joel is a masterful songwriter, a first-rate performer (until he gets tired) and just a great guy. The setting and historical significance of the event make this a do-not-miss.",1440028800,,2037,4.587912087912088

4390785,5,B004J713JW,"I first heard Billy Joel in the 1970's with his ""52nd Street"" album and loved it. I am not a pop music aficionado, but I have always like BJ so I thought this Blu Ray disk would serve an attractive way to evaluate my Home Theatre System.
I would tend to moderate some of the pros and cons of this disk...Firstly, most people, and I too, seem to think the video quality is excellent...Very sharp, clear and bright with great camera work. The concert had a good deal of electricity and BJ gave his all. The band was great and Billy can still sing and play the piano well enough to excite an audience, but as you would expect, time has taken some toll on the upper reaches of his voice, but not enough to seriously detract from the enjoyment or the occasion of the concert; it is remarkable that a guy of his age can  perform as well as he did for over two hours. The contributions of McCartney and Bennett and others added greatly to the festivity of the occasion....

Now for the sound issues: The problem may have been microphone placement which favored Billy's voice over the percussion section of his great band. I played it in several different modes and I could not tell much difference on some pretty good equipment. The sound was quite forward with BJ's voice front and center. I found that the disk had great dynamic range and had great presence and clarity, but to get those qualities a little bass response was sacrificed, but not much. Some of the problem may simply be that the concert was in an outdoor venue which presents acoustic challenges not found in the recording studio. I got the best sounding bass response playing the disc through my Yamaha receiver in 7 channel enhancer mode....Whatever that is! The home theatre receivers  have become so complex, and I am too old and technologically challenged to operate them properly...I just would like simple bass and treble controls.. I don't really understand triple Dolby EX, DTS, virtual sound, lossless audio, Etc.

All in all a great concert, on a great occasion well filmed and nicely recorded.",1425254400,11,2065,4.618528610354224

While, this is it.  If you are a Billy Joel fan, you MUST have this DVD.  If you are not yet a fan, listen to this and you will become one!  Everything about this DVD is in the 8-10 range on the 10 scale.  The surround sound audio is superb - you'll want to crank it up.  While some may complain that Joel's voice has changed from the early days, after 4 decades that's to be expected - get over it.  Where the mix on many concert DVDs is too heavy on the music and often steps on the vocals, Joel's voice comes thru clear and strong - albeit a little deeper.  The video editing is also very well done.  Thankfully absent is the hyper MTV-type jump-around that makes the audiophile seasick.  You get to really enjoy the concert.  And, with 28 tracks over two and a half hours, there's plenty of material to please.  John Mayer's guitar work on 'This is the Time' is a welcome addition. Performances by Tyler, Daltrey and Mellencamp are all top notch and a very nice bonus. The closing track with McCartney and Joel is history making.

I own several concerts on bluray and DVD and I love them (John Mayer - Where the Light Is - Live in Los Angeles ; U2 Rattle & Hum; Sara Bareiles - Brave Enough: Live at the Variety).  I also own several that I don't love and never listen to for various reasons.  This Bluray will go at the top of that list.

I wanted to like it so badly.  I saw the few negative reviews about the sound quality/mixing which were almost enough to keep me from buying it.  I find few purchases more disaapointing than a concert DVD you are really looking forward to only to find out that it sounds like a live recording from the tonight show.  I went to other sites hoping to dispell those concerns because I love billy joel.  I have a SACD of his and it is one of the few CD's I can just sit and listen to and do nothing all the way through.  One website I found said that there was a bad audio track on the blurry/dvd (Dolby Digital Mix) but that the LPCM mix was great.  That's all I needed.

I only listened to three songs before I couldn't listen to it anymore... The only guess I could come up with is that it was mixed for old people in mind who can't hear that great and needed the crowd and all the character of the music removed so that they could understand the lyrics.  I'm not a grumpy person... Just wish I hadn't let my heart overrule my head on this one and saved myself the room on my shelf for something else.",1406332800,5,1491,4.1211072664359865

4390853,4,B004J713JW,"Definitely worth owning if you are a Billy Joel fan, and especially if you are a New Yorker (or ex-New Yorker like me), history in the making here and a great send off for Shea Stadium and it's fans.
Great song list, most of the hits are performed, and with a few surprise guests. Paul McCartney was a great bonus!
I saw Tony Bennett on the song list for ""New York State of Mind"", and thinking 'great, Tony Bennett, whats that old fossil doing here?'.  But I tell you, I was blown away, he was excellent and actually showed more energy than Billy Joel.
Which brings me to one of the negative things about this concert and one of the reasons I didn't give it 5 stars.
Many of the songs, Billy looked and sounded like he was struggling and that his energy was flagging.  Sometimes he sang with very short, quick singing, sometimes almost talking, like he was out of breath and having trouble belting out the tunes.  I know he's not as young as he used to be (none of us are), but to me it really showed.

The other negative is the band.  While individually, they all seemed like a very talented group of musicians, but compared to Billy's old band, they just didn't quite capture the magic.  I would have loved to have seen at least some of his previous band mates from The Stranger era.

Anyway, those things didn't make me regret buying this excellent concert DVD, but the bottom line is there are better video concerts out there.",1390262400,2,1430,4.393939393939394

I think this dvd was great ,the sound was great,on my home theater system,and so was the picture quality. A great performence buy one of the top artist of today. The guests he had on stage were very good,Tony Bennette,for one was great. It was a great way to end the era of that stadium,I'm sure for many fans of the Mets it was sad to see that stadium go down buy the recking ball,but they are getting a new stadium,you  just hate to see it go ,but progress moves on.

The only small criticism I have is the editor uses too many shots of the crowd. I don't go to concerts to see the crowd. I know they had only two performances to pull this together from, but crowd shots tend to be a lazy editors way to cover for no good shots.

4390873,5,B004J713JW,"New Yorkers - off with your heads if you don't have this in your library.
That said, I married a New Yorker and he wanted this for his birthday.
It is amazing.
Joel has been through some chizz in his life and I got a secret ""yes!!"" to see Christie Brinkley reduced to standing on the floor with the regular audience. Because this guy is just a musical genius. The back story is great as it shares about Joel's career, his personal life, and his inspirations over the years in between playing some just great music.
A really cool part - he invited some of his friends to share songs with him and the most favorite of this non-native New Yorker was Garth Brooks singing ""Shameless.""
I haven't been able to get that performance by him and by Billy outta my head since we watched it two days ago. Gives me chills.
When I heard that Billy Joel was going to be the last concert - the last anything at Shea I was like, ""whaaaaaat? Why?""
The goof was on me because I do not believe any other person, artist, genius could have laid Lady Shea to rest the way she deserved than the way Billy Joel did it. He may have even lifted her status up a few notches with his choice of sharing the stage with old and new friends -- shutting down Queens to bullet Sir Paul through NY air space through the airport red tape through traffic to Shea's doorstep was a small feat in and of itself --- to the diverse people he added on stage to pay tribute to NY events, to the choice of musical instruments he invited, to the light engineers he hired (who should get a separate award for the awesome light show and background graphics), to the very personal performance of his band, to the sharing of his heart in this entire performance, to the FOUR encores he did...there are no fitting words that do justice to this entire evening.

The stadium obviously means a great deal emotionally to the respectful but very involved audience and many of the performing stars. Billy's running commentary was a great historical thread which enlightened those of us who were not able to grow up near Shea and who appreciated being clued in on the many happenings over the years.

Billy Joel didn't perform many of his biggest hits (Just the way you are, Uptown girl, It's still rock and roll to me, Honesty, Innocent man, All about soul, and A matter of trust). So I figured this concert would be disappointing. Was I wrong. This was a great event with great guest stars. After watching him perform some of his lesser known songs, I have greater appreciation for the artist Billy Joel is. Great songs, Great voice, Great music! He has that ""folk hero"" quality that his fans love. This concert gets better with each listen!

4390885,3,B004J713JW,"Many of us know that Billy hasn't released new music in over 20 years. There's nothing wrong with touring and playing the 'old stuff', but if you keep recycling the old hits, without any new material, it feels more like a money grab. I say this with a heavy heart, because Billy is one of my all-time favorites. It just kills me to buy the recycled hits that have been done before with greater energy and better voice. Granted, he was 60 at the time of the Shea show, but Bruce is the same age, and Bruce doesn't do nostalgia tours. He releases new music and tours playing new material.

If you want to see the best live Billy Joel concert video, you'd have to look for an old VHS or a bootleg of 1983's 'Live From Long Island' which came out right after the 'The Nylon Curtain' album.

I love Billy, but his energy, voice and talent were certainly more on full display 30 years back to greater effect. The 60 year old Billy can't compete with that.

4390914,2,B004J713JW,"Let me start by saying that my favorite form of relaxation is sitting back and watching a DVD concert video on my theater system. When I was in my teens, my favorite singer was Billy Joel. My very first concert was Billy Joel(solo-no band) at a place called ""Ebetts Field"" in downtown Denver. It was when Piano Man was a hit. The place held maybe 350 people and that concert was one of the most memorable I have ever been to. I walked away totally thrilled! I went to every concert he put on in Denver up through 1995. This DVD was going to be really the first concert he had put out on DVD and I was really excited because all of the other stuff was music video's or VHS stuff that was terrible quality. I bought this DVD around three months ago and I have only watched it once. That is how bad it is! If you grew up with Billy Joel and ever saw him in concert, you may agree with me. Watching this dvd concert he seemed totally bored and acted as if he didn't really want to be there. There was very little interaction with the audience. His voice was not good. No emotion and quite honestly not always in tune. You may say it's because of his age but I have many DVD's of same generation singers who sound spot on ( The Eagles, Tina Turner, Fleetwood Mac etc). I did think that ""Captain Jack"" was done pretty well but that's about it. This DVD is in no way a good representation of what Billy Joel was in his heyday. If someone out there knows of another Billy Joel concert on DVD or any plans to release one in the future, I would love to know about it.",1323302400,2,1557,4.125
4390915,5,B004J713JW,"I've been a Billy Joel fan since the very beginning - and we're talking almost 40 years back.  My wife and I have seen him numerous times, but the crowning achievement was taking our four kids to the sold-out River of Dreams tour with tickets provided by Jane Argentiou, his personal assistant.  I saw the DVD and the relatively modest price and thought I had nothing to lose...but little did I know what I had to gain.  Watching a near flawless capture of the crowd, the performance, even the emotion of a mature performer doing a retrospective of a singular career with all the stops pulled out and no holds barred was special.

Second, while I was in the hospital with my newborn daughter, this concert came on during one of the public television fundraisers in the wee hours of the morning.  Being a new mom, I wasn't sure how to calm her so I did what helps me.  I immediately picked her up and began to sing the songs and rocked her to the beats.  Needless to say, she was mesmerized and calmed down.  Only being a few hours old, she stayed up for the whole concert! When I got this home, I played it for her.

There is no Bass management and everything is pushed towards the middle speaker.  Just to get to an acceptable listening, you'll have to turn off the surround sound and listen to it in Stereo.

4390925,5,B004J713JW,"After watching this concert the only thing I did notice was that Billy voice seems to be out of key somewhat.  He sings in a lower more controlled voice than what sounds like on this DVD.  However, on my system the sound overall is 10 out of 10, the video is the best I have ever seen for a concert recording and Billy himself, in this scorching heat deleivered a top notch performance.  He is truly one of the best live performers of our time.  I have tired playing in 5.1 and stereo and both sound excellent, so I don't know what type of system others are playing that find the sound to be problematic.

This is an excellent DVD and one of the best I have seen in a long time.  Yes there a re a few songs missing but he cannot play every song for everyone as the concert would have to be 4 hours long.  Stay away from the boot leg versions as they are poorly done although you get to hear Billy's unedited chatting between songs whcih is pretty cool.",1308268800,,952,4.141304347826087
4390926,2,B004J713JW,All I can say is one thing. His voice is really bad in this concert. If you can live with it then the back up and band is better than he is at the time he sang. I agree with one about thinking the man was drunk. You just don't have a concert like this and sound like that. Also the DVD comes in your not so standard case. Something like a clear CD case. The hard plastic kind and the middle hub was broke and we know what that could mean. A DVD that has moved during shipment and scratched a new DVD all to heck. I know they can do better than this as well as Billy with his voice. Its time to retire and remember the good ol days when the pipes worked flawlessly. I give it two stars just because his voice is bad threw the whole concert.,1307750400,2,739,3.8684210526315788

the man can PLAY and SING, and he sure as hell knows how to put a show on, and he has the kinds of friends that make him cool (John Mayer, Macca, etc...) and he's playing to HIS audience, HIS people, HIS city...this is penultimate Joel and just about the best production ever put onto Blu-Ray.

Others have clearly outlined what's on this set. I'm just here to tell you that this stuff is IT. I could go without the sometime hokey ""rotating piano"" schtick (why oh WHY was this done? does it really serve ANY purpose?), but the music is just perfectly paced, and Billy's piano and voice is SURPRISINGLY seasoned and warm, despite the environs of the outdoor stadium. That said, this whole mix is superb...there's not many times a live show OUTDOORS in a large arena can be made to sound intimate and LOOK intimate, yet the directors and engineers manage it with LOTS and LOTS of close ups, not just of BJ, but of all the performers (try not to mesmerized by the percussionist/backup singer/alto saxophonist to just stage left and behind BJ...wow!) are highlighted and the thing is an amazing whole picked from the best of the shows done in that amazing set of concerts at Shea (goodbye, old friend...).

A word about the sound. I read some complains about then luck of bass in the PCM and Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtracks. Must say I didn't notice it. There is a mild, sufficient bass. True, not as dominant as in the Police concert but still ""in place"".

The Video quality is exceptional and the production and editing as well. I have a JBL Studio matched speaker set-up in 7.1 consisting of a 3-way 150 watt center channel,250-watt 3-way floor standing,400 watt self-powered 12-inch front firing,3-way 175-watt side surround and 4-way 175 watt rear surround all connected with monster cable and powered by a 910 watt Yamaha 7.1 audio/video receiver.

4390943,5,B004J713JW,"I have to take this moment to brag that I saw Billy Joel in the Moore Theatre in Seattle in the fall of 1974.  There were less than 30 people in the audience.

Billy Joel is a national treasure.  This lovingly crafted Blu-Ray works on so many levels its hard to know where to begin.  First, the Blu-Ray is rendered with perfect color balance; I don't recall a single shot that isn't a visual delight.  Most significantly, I did not detect any video compression at all.  I would like to thank everyone involved in this decision for resisting the urge to cram too much on the disk and instead opting for the highest possible video quality.  Nearly all Blu-Ray movies are compressed such that there is obvious ""mosquito noise"".  I didn't detect any on this disk.

The sound is also engineered very well.  All instruments are in the proper perspective, including the numerous strings and horns.  Whoever did the engineering and mixdown should get a raise.  The rear channels of the 5.1 mix bring in mostly the ambience, including the audience, and adds to the excitement.  The rear channels are never obtrusive and allow the front and center speakers to focus on the music.  This recording is a technological marvel of the highest caliber.

I cannot say enough about the quality of the performance.  While Billy Joel is more than capable of carrying any show, these performances were really about his body of work.  The songs are featured with sufficient instrumentation and quality of musicianship to bring the studio renditions to life.  His personal performance sparkles without being over stated....he lets his songs do the talking.

I understand that there are numerous songs that didn't make it onto this disk.  Again, I presume that the producer elected to leave off some material to avoid having to apply video compression, and I absolutely agree with this decision.  I suppose I'll have to pony up some more money when the ""complete"" set comes out.  No worries, I'm a sucker who will buy this performance all over again if necessary.  After all, I've watched it once and already feel like I've got more than my money's worth.",1302480000,,2130,4.791208791208791

The concert itself was very enjoyable.  There were a few tracks missing that I would have liked to see but overall I was very satisfied.  I loved the performance of 'Piano Man'.  He must have loved to have all of Shea singing to him.",1302480000,5,504,4.252631578947368

In fact, I'd say it ranks right up there as being one of the best I own.  Picture quality is outstanding on the blu-ray on my 58"" plasma.  I have a pretty good sound system with sub and noticed no issues what so ever with the sound quality.  The Dolby Digital track was great to me.

The 2 channel mix is a bit better but still not up to the standards that many other Blu-rays achieve.

4390947,2,B004J713JW,"I received my BluRay version today. Had read an earlier review about a bad audio mix from a Best Buy disc. Well, apparentely nothing has been done to correct it, because the 5.1 mix is not good. Billy voice way too loud, drums, especially cymbals and other percussion instruments pretty much go unheard, and with the size of the band on stage, it is empty sounding. Like something's missing. I have an upper mid-range sound system and it just sounds flat and hollow. Compared to many other Blu Ray's, and even regular DVD's it is not a good sounding disc. The picture is great. Absolutely no extras to be found, however.

I turned down my center speaker quite a bit because Billy's voice was overpowering, but it still sounds empty.

Update few weeks later: Depends on what equipment your listening to this on to determine sound issues. In the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, Billy's voice is way too far out front in the center speaker and dominates the overall sound. And, there is basically nothing in the rear speakers. The PCM 5.1 mix is bassy and muffled. I've been listening to the DD 5.1 mix with the center channel turned down a bunch and the rear speakers turned up a bunch. It is OK, but the mix is also different and better in the three (Tyler, Daltrey, Mellencamp)bonus tracks for some reason.
If you are listening to this through TV speakers in stereo or through a cheap all in one system, you're probably not going to notice any audio issues.

Overall, I am very happy with the purchase, the show is fantastic. I think my initial shock at the sound mix dimmed my overall feelings. I just don't think that I should have to adjust my equipment for certain DVD's/BluRays to get the best sound. I know there are a few concert discs over the years that I've had to tweak somewhat, but very rare.",1302048000,21,1796,4.52
4390948,4,B004J713JW,"Billy Joel performed on my college student union patio back in 1974 and got so ticked off at the spotlight operator not following his antics around stage that he jumped on the top of his piano and stood there until the spotlight finally settled on him and tossed two large, glowing birds into the air and screamed, ""F--- You!""

Billy Joel begins this fantastic closing performance at Shea Stadium in 2008 before it was torn down by ripping through his early anthem, ""Angry Young Man."" It's nice to know some things haven't changed. Oh, sure, he's now bald, grey, paunchy, and sweating buckets of water onto his keyboard on a hot summer night before a standing room only crowd of about 110,000. But the voice is still amazingly strong and supple, and the songs he goes through in this two and a half hour tour de force are the deep album cuts most long-term Billy Joel fans want to hear; from ""Miami 2017,"" to ""Captain Jack,"" to ""Goodnight, Saigon,"" to ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant.""

Guest stars like Garth Brooks, (""Shameless""), Tony Bennett (""New York State of Mind""), John Mayer (""This is the Time""), and Paul McCartney (""Let It Be"") show up to augment the festivities. But trust me on this one ... Billy Joel snarling and playing his piano and reminding you to ""Not take sh-- from anyone"" is plenty enough to stir your blood. It's fun to play `spot the celebrity' on the infield below the stage. Isn't that billionaire New York City mayor Bloomberg beaming widely right in the middle of the huddled, sweating masses? I wish I had been there. Check this out and you'll wish you had been, also.",1300838400,,1602,4.637323943661972
4390949,5,B004J713JW,"THIS LONG CONCERT JUST FLEW BY FOR ME.  I read all the various criticisms of different aspects of the Blu Ray disc sound track.  Most of them were well founded.  The sound was extremely good, but the mix wasn't at times.  They obviously emphasized the singer, but took turns turning down the mikes on the drums, backup singers, and sometimes the brass.  The video was top notch.

That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the show.  Billy is not a spring chicken, and appears especially heavy.  With all that, he put on a great show for all of us.

What a great career.  Sometimes I forget how many big hits he has had over the years. We can pick all we want, but in the end, it really made a great night enjoying this terrific performer. Whomever puts together these shows for release on blu ray ought to have this edited edition, and the full concert.  As long as it was already done, why cut anything out?",1300665600,,904,4.385542168674699
4390950,5,B004J713JW,"Oh man. I was so pumped when I saw this at Best Buy for $20. I couldn't believe it. I snapped it up immediately and watched it with my dad right when we got home. Other than the small disappointment of not having ""Uptown Girl"" or ""Big Shot"" on there, it was freaking awesome. The mixing is pretty tight with the exception of Joel's mix being a bit too loud sometimes, or like on ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" where the backup singers' mix was a bit too light. But overall, it was beautiful.

Highlight: 57,000 people singing the lyrics to ""Piano Man"". Wow. Mind blowing.

Also, Roger Daltrey, Paul McCartney, Steven Tyler, John Mellencamp, and Tony Bennett show up. Holy crap. My mind exploded.

Definitely buy this. Billy Joel plays with such enthusiasm and his band is absolutely amazing. Modern musicians can't hold a candle to these guys when it comes to live music. No autotune here, baby.",1300492800,51,891,4.591194968553459

4390952,4,B004J713JW,"Well the quality is superb, however as someone who went to the Final Night I know that there was some major editing done. First off the track order is totally out of whack, and at times it seems as if Billy's voice is in a different key than what I remember and have heard via the bootlegs. Overall it is a great recording, all be it edited recording, of this historic event with perhaps the best american singer/songwriter of the last 30 years.",1300406400,9,445,4.373493975903615
4390953,5,B004J713JW,"""This is a concert celebrating the end of an Era: The Beatles Opened It (Shea Stadium, in New York), and Billy Joel (a Native New Yorker) Closed It."" (Qoute Was From back of dvd Package). This stadium, which opened in 1964, was the home for the New York Mets Baseball Team & their 2 World Series Championships. It was also a concert venue, for some of the biggest & greatest rock bands in the world, including the Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, and Others. After this concert, the historic stadium was demolished. The entergy level and enthusiasm of the crowd, Billy Joel & his Band, & the Special Guest Artists, is simply ""AWESOME"". It is so good, words just cannot do it justice, you just have to watch it to believe it, feel it & experience it. The large, muti-level stadium is packed to capacity. This is definitely a concert that, no doubt, will go down in history as one of the best ever in the history of Rock & Roll!!!!",1300406400,9,934,4.436046511627907
4390954,4,B004J713JW,"There is no question that when it has came down to great music, many of today's artists like Lady Gaga, Rihanna and Beyonce' have been known to lip sync into their performances, where they've personally stopped delivering anything that has felt organic or special. Sometimes it is lackluster music that makes me constantly go back to artists who've only been known for talent, not flash and flare. That has been the case with Billy Joel. While it has been almost 20 years since he delivered his last album, River Of Dreams, his music has always remained timeless just like it was yesterday. But when it has came down to performing live, the Piano Man still has shown to knock it right out of the park. That was the case when he was the first singer to do a concert at Yankee Stadium in 1990, and again as he performed the final concert at Shea Stadium. For his hard core fans, and die hard fans of his music, that concert is here for all to enjoy.

Billy Joel: Live At Shea Stadium showcases the 2 concerts that Billy Joel had sung his heart out and tickled those ivories like there was no tomorrow on DVD. The concert is well-received and honestly one of the best live concert packages you've seen of Billy Joel. The 2 night event showcases some of Billy's biggest songs, sung to a whole new generation of fans. Billy performs some of his classics like My Life, his standard Piano Man, also rocking out to a guitar on We Didn't Start The Fire in one of the rare times we've seen Billy strum a guitar in concert, and Scenes From An Italian Restaurant to just name a few. There are also some great collaborations here as well including Shameless with Garth Brooks and New York State Of Mind with legendary crooner Tony Bennett. The live event is fun to enjoy, but some of the songs he performed with others could've brought in some more life alone. Not only that, but one of Billy's biggest tributes also came into playing piano into other songs of his own, like leading classic songs like Take Me Out To The Ball Game and Yankee Doodle Dandy into some of his hits like My Life & Piano Man. While it is clever going toward his own music, it just adds into Billy's classic standard of why he still can play to a wonderful audience, despite not making a album in years.

All in all, I enjoyed watching Billy Joel: Live At Shea Stadium, and it is a great delight for any die hard Billy Joel fan, or for anyone who is also new to Billy's music with his over 40 year career of playing great music. There are a lot of memories Billy had made for all audiences and generations young and old with his music, and this is a wonderful moment from a man who not only became the first singer to perform live at Yankee Stadium and the grand finale of Shea Stadium hands down. I absolutely recommend this DVD a lot. Keep singing Billy, because you're keeping on doing New York proud.

Best Buy in Los Angeles doesn't seem to know this as they put out the bad discs on the original street date.

I have one and Billy's vocals as well as the backup vocals are all pushed to the front. This happens in 5.1, and 5.1 PCM.

Make sure you have the newly authored disc.

UPDATED ON 4/6/2011

It seems they new nothing about the BAD AUDIO mix because it's not fixed.

AUDIO IS STILL BAD! THE BLU-RAY RELEASED THIS WEEK IS ALSO BAD! DO NOT BUY UNTIL IT'S FIXED!

AND why would they sleight the very consumers who are keeping home video alive by upgrading to Blu-Ray by not including the CDs??!!??!!

The whole thing stinks and I'm upset because I LOVE ME SOME BILLY JOEL!!!!!

Thanks for reading the rant.

4390957,5,B004J713JW,"Aside from the fact that I was at the Friday night concert (so excuse me for my biased opinion), I think that this was probably the most memorable concert that I've ever been to (to date).  It was full of energy and excitement and the star-studded special guests were fantastic.  The blu-ray provides the closest experience to actually having been in the crowd. I was at first upset that it took almost 3 years to be sold, however, they really did take their time and execute a fantastic product in sound and in picture quality (even though some will complain that it isn't in 1080p but rather only in 1080i).

But I digress. The main reason that I am posting this is to make you all aware that some stores are already carrying this item - and I don't mean illegally! I went to my local best buy today to purchase the CD/DVD combo - one of the sales associates told me that the blu ray was arriving today and she then went a step further and retrieved it from the truck! About 8 or 9 other fans, including myself, jumped on the copies as she struggled to carry the stack of discs from the receiving dock.

Anyway, don't wait - get this and get it on blu-ray for the closest experience to actually having been there.

I miss Shea and this concert will always be remembered by many as a grand 'ol farewell to the aging mecca.  (if only the mets had avoided a 2nd consecutive season-end collapse, i wonder what might have been for the playoffs and maybe world series. however, those are thoughts for another blog and another time!)",1299628800,2,1528,4.400709219858156
