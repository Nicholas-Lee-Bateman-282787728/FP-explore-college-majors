7910464,1,B00000IC9N,"The worst fantasy anime ever, it must be Panzer Dragoon! And if it isn't the worst anime ever, it certainly is the worst to be based on a videogame. It is completely devoid of a half decent plot. Though the synopsis shows a decent plot, it is never fully explained throughout the 30 minute span of the film. Plus, no subtitled version was ever released, and given that the dubbing is painfully bad, it's just a crying shame. Also, the character animation is flat, though colorful. It just doesn't look good. The CG effects were very weak and ended up being somewhat flat. Also, the ending was very weak.

Basically, the plot (if this counts as one) is such: Dude named Kyle and his friend, shooting birds or something while riding dragons. Two dragons fighting, one blue, one black. Black Dragon kidnaps Kyle's girlfriend. Kyle rides Blue Dragon, fighting some bad guys along the way, and reaches a tower. They fight a bit, and...that's it? PUH-LEEZE!

What was ADV Films thinking when they licensed this game-licensed mess? The dubbing was awful, the character designs were bland, the plot was as dim as you could get, and the 30 minutes that make up this film are 30 that could be used doing something other than watch this trash. A low price of $6.98? COME ON! The last time it was in print it was available in the Right Stuf catalog for 6 bucks! I wouldn't pay 5 bucks to rent it, and at the time, that's what I did! If you are a fan of the various games in the Panzer Dragoon series, steer clear of this at all costs! Actually, do just that if you are an anime fan!

P.S.: It's only 30 minutes long, so you won't have to endure the pain for long.

P.P.S.: You can find your own way to make it great-it's so horrific that you can laugh at the English dubbing or create your own ending. Then, you can send it to the Japanese who planned this garbage!",1118016000,,1853,4.393586005830904
7910465,2,B00000IC9N,"Most anime out there is using a lot of CG. Some of them pull it off very nicely like Cowboy Bebop and Blue Submarine No. 6. But this has to be the worst anime ever made with CG in it. When watching the flying boats I though ""Ok, just a little bad CG"". Then the battle scenes came. This is where the CG is the worst. The boats explode entirely wrong and its unbearable. But where CG fails, 2D animation comes in, right? Wrong. Even the 2D animation is horrible. If you looking for an anime based on a video game, buy Sakura Wars or Tekken instead of waisting $10 on this piece of crap anime.",979948800,2,590,4.094827586206897
7910466,1,B00000IC9N,"Being that Panzer Dragoon was one of my favorate games for Saturn, I was enthusiastic about seeing the anime. Unfortunately, I was greeting with a bland, horribly animated disaster.
First off, I'd like to say that this anime is only thirty minutes, at most. This explains why the characters and  plot are extremely underdeveloped, and maybe because it was so short the  animators just said 'to hell with it' and made one of the most contemptable  mixes of hand drawn animation and computer graphics EVER. Between the  boring dialogue, and disappointing action scenes, I was wondering how this  could get much worse. At least the hand drawn animation wasn't the worst  I've seen...",961027200,,680,4.9734513274336285
