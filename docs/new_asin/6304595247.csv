901368,4,6304595247,"This is probably my favorite book of all time, so I'm very critical of the content of the film. I think that this version comes closest to the book in terms of characters and content.  Visually, it's very haunting, and I  really love the music they use throughout the tale.  While I do have some  problems with the casting (I didn't like Juliette Binoche), I really think  that this version did do the book justice. Really, though, I think that  'Wuthering Heights' was not meant to be placed within a 90 minute format.  Too much goes on for that. I think I'd rather see someone turn it into a  mini-series, so that viewers can get the full effect of the book.",944524800,6,660,4.396694214876033
901369,5,6304595247,"I have read the novel by Emily Bronte in high school and  it is greatest book I've ever read. And the movie itself...no movie based on a novel has matched its original-self so perfectly. Ralph fieness is the man I imagine  Heathcliff would exactly look like. Juliet Binoche was perfect as  Cathy-Catherine. The places, the players, the music, everything is great.  It is the most unforgettable movie I have and will ever see..I strongly  recommend it to everyone.",939340800,4,463,4.884615384615385
901370,5,6304595247,First time i was this movie is about ralph fiennes.  i started crying becuase give the viewer the feeling of being in love with your soulmate and love until death.  Also give the feeling about how a man like heathcliff  could be everything else but love is more stornger that everythin else.  i  give it 5 star because i believe that.,934243200,,334,4.409836065573771
901371,2,6304595247,"Well, this movie has 2 things going on it.  The scenes and moors are authentic, as it was shot in the same location where the Brontes lived.  And, it's the only one that faithfully follows the ENTIRE plot.
But,  otherwise, this movie is just not very good.  Juliette Binoche is simply  miscast as Catherine; as the 2nd generation one, she simply looks too old.  Ralph Feinnes, however, was a MAJOR disappointment.  I've always seen the  brooding actor as a perfect choice for Heathcliff, and he definitely  conveys Heathcliff's agony and vengeful, dark nature.  However, though it  is admirable that he depicts Heathcliff's villainy without any romantic  cushion, his depiction is nevertheless one-dimensional.  Fienne's  Heathcliff is either tortured or brutal.  There's little humanity in here  to suggest why he would have such a love for Catherine.  Honestly, he seems  more cartoon than a real man.  Without an equally passionate performance by  Binoche to balance his, their love seem merely perverse and almost funny in  its melodrama.
Ironically, the pairing of the two works wonderfully in  the English Patient, when she is emotional but pleasant and he tortured but  with humor.  Being a major fan of the book and a fan of Fiennes, I felt the  movie was a truly wasted opportunity.",926294400,2,1291,5.033333333333333
901372,3,6304595247,"Though I enjoyed this film alright, I have a hard time imagining anyone who hasn't read the book being able to apreciate the story or characters very well.  It tries to be a ""complete"" screen telling of the  story, but it's really just the highlights.  Ralph Fiennes is the only real  saving grace.  Heathcliff, the original gothic romantic anti-hero,  forrunner to such characters as the Phantom of the Opera and the Vampire  Lestat, seems like the role he was born to play.",925430400,3,475,4.719512195121951
901373,4,6304595247,"This video is absoultely hilarious!  If you like Victoria Holt style romance, you will find it very amusing.  The film is one of those ""so bad it's good"".  On arthouse drama level I give it one star but for  the laughs I give it four.  I found the spectacle of Ralph Fiennes  staggering around with glassy eyes a very enjoyable one, and the number of  anonymous wolves howling in the background was all very fun.  The death  rate was somewhat high, however, and the ghosts very ludicrous.  Just don't  expect it to do credit to the book.",919296000,,537,4.43298969072165
901374,5,6304595247,"I was amazed when I read that this British production was not well  received upon its release in 1992.  The highly talented pair of Juliette  Binoche and Ralph Fiennes play the doomed Cathy and Heathcliff, supported  by the equally fine Janet McTeer as Ellen Dean.  The performances are  exemplary--Fiennes' performance is said to have inspired Steven Spielberg  to cast him as the Nazi commandant in ""Schindler's List.""  And a  diabolical Heathcliff he is, indeed--Fiennes plays this intense role  faithful to Emily Bronte's original character.  He is tormented, sadistic,  manipulative, ruthless and brutal--and nonetheless hypnotically sexual and  alluring.  This is the genuine Heathcliff, with all apologies to the  brilliant Laurence Olivier, who portrayed Heathcliff as a much more  sympathetic character. Juliette Binoche plays both Cathy and Cathy's  daughter by the ineffectual Edgar Linton, and brings great depth and appeal  to both roles. The scenes of the bleak Yorkshire moors, and the haunting,  shadowy quality of the Wuthering Heights house, lend this film a truly  Gothic atmosphere. A jarring note is the casting of Sinead O'Connor (in a  wig) as Emily Bronte, but this is a minor flaw. I found this version every  bit as good as the original 1939 classic, to which this film has been  unfairly compared.  It is much more faithful to the brooding, doomed  quality of the book.  The scenes acted by Fiennes as the grief-stricken  Heathcliff just after Cathy's death are alone worth the price of the film.  For the many fans of these two brilliant actors, and of Bronte's novel,  this film is well worth seeing.  END",905558400,312,1634,5.149425287356322

At first, I thought Ralph Feinnes was far too pretty to play Heathcliff, but he is an extraordinary actor and quickly slouched into Heathcliff's angry animalism. Binoche is capable and lovely, but she (and I) struggled with her French accent. The screenplay was a faithful adaptation which included both generations, something that I think is vitally important. I loved the locale, the rough and windy Yorkshire moors. My only complaint is that, for some reason, the creators decided to have Emily Bronte, played by Sinead O'Conner, wander through the empty, abandoned shell of Wuthering Heights a couple of times, offering her insights - totally unnecessary, and rather odd.",1454544000,8,803,5.045112781954887

The horror indeed.

Binoche (whom I've never liked, so keep that in mind) is as stiff and unconvincing as usual, it is hardly believable that she would be as passion driven as the character supposedly is. Though she and Fiennes must have had some chemistry as they were cast together in The English Patient (though she was not the romantic lead).

Binoche is less successfully cast as Cathy. French accent gets in the way and her part could have been better written. The wonderful Janet McTeer is wasted on this Nelly Dean, reduced here to a bit of a cipher. If you really want the full Wuthering experience, McTeer's reading of the book available on Audible is not to be missed.  The book is hellishly difficult to capture well on film. It is much darker, and the psychology of the characters much more complex, than even this version conveys, and it does try. Some have praised the music.

901793,3,6304595247,"While I appreciated seeing a version of the story that spanned, however spasmodically, all three star-crossed generations of the book, I felt it fell far short of being really good. I would blame the scripting and editing rather than the acting, because I felt it was excellently cast and all the actors put in good work. There was a bit too much soulful staring from Heathcliff; Linton Heathcliff's part was so truncated that if I weren't familiar with the story his existence would probably have puzzled me; and poor Nellie Dean and Lockwood were mere ciphers. In the constraints of time the characters and the story are a hurried, confusing mishmash.

Why the insertion of Emily Bronte (was that Emily Bronte?) as a narrator, which added a certain alienation to the story, kind of like announcing, ""it was all a dream!"" right at the start, when the story has a perfect narrator built in? Why deprive Mrs. Dean of her function? She ends up rather a fifth wheel in this treatment, and Lockwood's appearance merely clutters things up.  I think following the original construction of the novel as narrated by Nellie to Lockwood would have been clearer and would have taken no more time than a third-party narration which removed the viewer further from the tale.

The pacing is awkward as a result of trying to fit too much into too short a time; I would love to see a six-part adaptation that showed the whole grim glory of this tale, hysterica, sadism, agonies and all, rather than a choppy ""best quotes"" attempt.

I also wish I had seem more intensity of emotion in the critical points, but as a scrapbook of the story, I did enjoy watching it, though I probably will never watch it again.",1431993600,10,1691,4.683501683501683

901834,4,6304595247,"It's been awhile since I've seen a film version of Wuthering Heights.  There are so many out there----earlier 1930s versions and more recent films.  This one really captured the essence of life on the moors as most British productions do as well as life in the day of Emily Bronte.  Even the wealthy in this part of Britain were far from any sort of civilization.  Just the local village folk, very isolated and a non forgiving place of bad weather, lots of storms, and the windswept drama that really makes these stories come to life.

Everyone who's read the Bronte novels is familiar with the very romantic stories of forbidden love, lost love, along with rogue type men and vulnerable women.  This story is no different with a brooding, angry Heathcliff who carries a lifelong passion for Cathy, his stepsister.  There's also the same share of drunk despondent relatives, like Cathy's brother who just can't seem to get it all together and even shuns his newborn son blaming him for the death of his wife in childbirth.  So that part comes up again as in a lot of these Gothic romances.  Women die in childbirth or are left scarred forever because of it.

As to the character roles.  Ralph Fiennes is a very talented actor and has been in a variety of  roles---like the English Patient, and the one about a guy on a quiz show.  He really can throw himself into parts and he doesn't disappoint in his role of Heathcliff.  Or should I say, Heathcliff on steroids----the guy sometimes is over the top angry, cruel, and abusive to the women in his life no less!  His passion for Cathy is one that if I were in her place, I would probably run far away from that man---he's scary!

Juliet Binoche is another talent who also played in the English Patient as a young nurse.  My favorite was her role as Vianne in Chocolat----the free spirited woman who runs a chocolate shop.  In this part of Cathy as well as the young offspring Catherine,  I was not as impressed.  I found her to be almost too flippant, giggly, and without any substance.  But I may be wrong---maybe that's as she's supposed to be and I confess it's been many years since I read Wuthering Heights.  I don't think I've ever seen a version of Wuthering Heights where one actress played both parts.

I also enjoyed watching the supporting cast.  They all played the parts well.  I especially liked the nanny character who played a very diplomatic role in her dealings with both Heathcliff and Cathy.  And the rest who portrayed servants and staff at both houses were realistically cast.  Again the harsh environment and the details pertaining to that.  The scene where the milk is frozen in the pail, the branches breaking through the window in the storm, and the whole other aspect of making a ghost story within a story.",1420848000,4,2784,4.603658536585366

901904,2,6304595247,"The cinematography is gorgeous.  The story, if you have read the book, is as close to Bronte's novels as other adaptations have been. Juliette Binoche is luminous. Even with her French-Yorkshire accent.

The disaster is in the casting of Ralph Fiennes, one of our best actors, as Heathcliff.  How much of  the interpretation of this iconic character is his own and how much the director's doesn't matter much to me. He is not Heathcliff. He isn't the Heathcliff in the novel (actually, there have been no Heathcliffs as Bronte wrote him) and he isn't a credible adaptation of him.  He's an angry brutish beast with no hint of vulnerability. He glowers. His eyes pierce like Bela Lugosi's. He thunders. He roars. Even when he's delivering lines full of pain and grieving, he grunts and grumbles. He chews the scenery. But the very worst part of this characterization is in the presentation. O my lord, who thought this up?  He wears his hair like an American Indian with mud for war-paint. His eyes are crystal, icy blue.  What?  O yeah. Not even tinted lenses.  He stares intensely at everything: at Cathy, at Hindley, at the moors, at a tree. I was embarrassed for him.

I love the novel. I've read it a dozen times. I've taught it.  I have liked other adaptations and I absolutely love what I think is the best one so far, the BBC's production with Tom Hardy.  But this one is awful. Seriously.  Watch one of the others -- any one of the others.",1412294400,4,1447,4.583657587548638

901954,5,6304595247,"Wuthering Heights is my favorite book, I re-read it every year, so I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to a Wuthering Heights movie.  Although not perfect, this movie version is by far my favorite.  I think the actors are well cast in their roles, Ralph Fiennes makes a perfect Heathcliff, and does not shy away from portraying Heathcliff's less admirable, tyrannical traits; Juliette Binoche, who makes a so-so Cathy, but unfortunately is also cast as Cathy's daughter with the only difference being a blonde wig, not really well thought out; and Jason Riddington, who is perfectly cast as Hareton (Hareton is an essential part of the book, but is generally an afterthought in most movie adaptations).  They utilize some of Emily Bronte's most famous lines, but I wish they'd used more of them, she was such a brilliant writer.  Until someone (anyone, please!) makes a Wuthering Heights movie or miniseries that's on par with the A&E miniseries of Pride and Prejudice, this version of Wuthering Heights will have to do :)",1402444800,5,1022,4.85632183908046

902029,3,6304595247,"The settings are beautiful, and feel authentic. The actors did a pretty good job, but I blame the director for not being able to extract more from their performances. The love between Cathy and HeathCliff is one of the more important dynamics of this story, but the film touches on it like a pebble being skipped along the surface of a pond. The parts of their passionate love affair that get the attention are the negative ones... like the film makers are trying too hard to convince us that this love affair was doomed. Their is a scene when the maid-type character says, ""I remember when this house was filled with laughter"", and I was trying to figure out,""when"", because the film only concentrates of all of the gloomy things in the story. The problem is, they tried to fit it into one movie, and much of the story takes place in three main parts in time. I think you really need two parts to be able to adapt the book properly.

I gave this version three stars because everyone involved in making this movie clearly worked hard, and did a pretty good job. However if you are interested in this awesome story, but absolutely do not want to read the book, then I suggest watching the adaptation made in 2009 with Tom Hardy.

902304,3,6304595247,"I tried to read this book when I was very young, and again when I was in college, and got lost in the style of language, in the confusion of names, and in the fact that I was really not yet experienced in reading for the pleasure, rather than for the book report. As I recall, I got a B on the book report because of Cliff Notes.

Now that I've seen this movie, I will be giving the book another attempt. [Update:  Third time's the charm, as they say.]  Now I have faces to go with the names. Now I can keep the two Cathies separate. But there's one more thing: now I can put aside the adolescent question of who I am supposed to like, and who dislike. Because you can't watch this movie or read the book without deciding that the story does not depend on your liking for any of the characters. This is just as well, because they are all pretty flawed.

Heathcliff is introduced to Cathy's family as the starving urchin her father found orphaned in Liverpool. He is to be adopted and treated as a brother. Cathy does her best to treat him like a brother at first, but the fact that he is not genetically her brother begins to matter as they grow older. Then her father dies, and her brother, who hated Heathcliff from the day he was brought home, inherits Wuthering Heights. He turns Heathcliff into a stable hand and humiliates him. Cathy's brother is an SOB, you see.

But there are SOBs enough for everyone in this story. And there are others who are not malicious, but only weak. Fatally weak. And there are selfish women and devious power trips, and lies, theft, all sorts of evils.

And there is a passion which may or may not deserve the term love.

The film lacks the heavy morbidity that pervades the Emily Bronte's novel, and this is good.

 Heathcliff, a gutter waif, is brought to Wuthering Heights as a child by charitable Mr. Earnshaw who tells his son and daughter that from now on they should consider him their brother. Hindley, the brother, takes an immediate strong dislike to the boy, while his sister Cathy loves him. She and Heathcliff form a star crossed deep and stirring romance, swearing eternal fidelity. Earnshaw dies and Hindley forces Heathcliff to be the house servant. Cathy meets Linton, a rich young man, who falls in love with her and proposes marriage. Cathy, thinking that Heathcliff is not in listening, tells a servant that she is thinking of marrying Linton because a marriage to Heathcliff would degrade her. Heathcliff rushes off and does not hear her say that she loves Heathcliff; he is her heart and soul; in fact she is Heathcliff.

 Heathcliff is gone for two years during which time, since he is gone, she marries Linton. He returns rich, determined to have Cathy despite her marriage and determined on revenge.

902369,2,6304595247,"I love ""Wuthering Heights"" as a book and I enjoy comparing adaptations. What is it about this psychologically dark book written by a brilliant but ill-fated young mid-19th century parson's daughter that compels so many to read, watch and continually adapt it into films, or even write songs about it?  Is it just the need to try to capture the essence of this fascinating yet somewhat repellent story about revenge, twisted love, greed and hatred?  Or is a desire to top other productions, some kind of contest to come out the winner of the best interpretation of Emily Bronte's colossal (as described by her sister Charlotte) masterpiece?  After coming across the 1992 Peter Kosminsky film these questions came to mind even more so than before. Promoted on the back of the DVD cover as the only theatrical movie version to cover the novel's entirety (if only skimming the surface, as completely would be impossible), for me this interpretation of the Bronte novel fell short in many areas and had a less than authentic feel.  While the house representing the Heights is obviously fake and constructed specifically for the film, the locations, as appealing to the eyes as they were, did not seem to fit the description in the novel.  Along with the usual grumbles (the actors being too old, the timeline for when situations occured in the book), Ralph Fiennes, while undeniably a formidable presence in film, was miscast as Heathcliff - singled out by some as being too ""refined"" for the role, he comes across as being brutal but lacking the rough and uncouthness of Bronte's anti-hero - especially in the early sequences.  Juliette Binoche, as lovely and competant an actress as she is, was undone not only by her French accent, but the fact that she was saddled with playing two complex and difficult roles - that of the elder Catherine (Cathy) Earnshaw Linton, and her daughter, Catherine Linton Heathcliff Earnshaw - undermines the movie even more.  Was it done for budget reasons? The blonde wig she wears as the daughter is an irritating distraction, not to mention that the younger Catherine is not supposed to resemble her mother.

Jonathan Firth as the sickly, annoying Linton Earnshaw is pretty much stuck with a thankless role as Heathcliff's effete son with the silly, and ultimately equally ill-fated Isabella (played by Sophie Ward). Edgar Linton (Simon Shepard) is even more weak and pitiable than in the book or any other film adaptation I've seen. But he still seems rather colorless (pardon the expression) and seems to be trying his mightiest to stay awake during the proceedings.

Jeremy Northam as Hindley isn't seen nearly enough (add me to those who feel he should have played Heathcliff instead). Northam, Janet McTeer (as faithful servant Ellen ""Nelly"" Dean) and to a lesser extent, Jason Riddington as Hareton were the saving grace of this film for me.  I don't know if the rest of the cast tried too hard or if the director did (or perhaps a bit of both?), but for me their efforts, while admirable, can't elevate the project to what they were trying to achieve. It does seem that Fiennes himself has less than kind words for this production - an unpleasant experience, one that almost turned him off of working on films.

To look at, the movie is pleasant enough. There is a feeling of a tight budget regarding costuming, hair (wigs) and interiors, but the absence of staginess that often prevailed in many of the earlier BBC televison productions is a plus, as is the music score and the interesting casting of Sinead O'Connor as Emily Bronte herself, taking over as narrator which in the novel was put to Lockwood and Nelly.

I do feel that this interpretation of WH is overrated, and while it covers more of the book than the classic 1939 Olivier/Oberon picture and the 1970 Dalton/Calder-Marshall production, both of those earlier renditions (speaking for myself) were far more enjoyable and better paced.  If you want to see a better depiction of WH (especially the second generation comprised of younger Catherine, Hareton and Linton), check out the 1998 and 2009 Masterpiece Theatre presentations. (I'd recommend the BBC 1978 miniseries if I had seen it but it's unavailability on region 1 DVD makes it difficult).

I think the part that disturbs me the most is that they really play down the timeframe towards the end of the novel where young Catherine and Hareston fall in love.

Here, both the second generation of Earnshaws and Lintons are portrayed, and it is also interesting that the director chose to cast Juliette Binoche in a dual role, as Heathcliff's tortured love, and also her own daughter. Though this version has suffered at the hands of critics and purists alike, I consider this one of my favorite adaptations of ""Wuthering Heights"", mainly because of Ralph Fiennes' credible characterization of the tortured anti-hero. Heathcliff is such a complex character and one not easy to like, considering the cruel and callous way he treats those around him, even manipulating his own son for his twisted notions of revenge. But, despite all this, Fiennes' portrayal invites our sympathy - his deeply rooted love for Cathy and his insurmountable grief at losing her is so credibly conveyed that one can't help but sympathize with him and understand his motivations, however misguided they may be. The movie is beautifully filmed with stunning cinematography, and the score suits the somber storyline.

The performances are much better than in the crappy 1970 movie version of this story, which was destroyed by a riduculous screenplay (not to mention also the utterly nonsensical ending). The chemistry between Fiennes and Binoche is very apparent, and sparks fly between them. As I haven't read the novel in several years (and given that this one tells the COMPLETE story), I got lost during the 2nd half of the film, but continued watching with absolute fascination...only towards the end did I begin to grasp the rest of the story. After seeing Fiennes in this movie, Steven Spielberg wanted Fiennes for the role of the villainous Amon Goeth in ""Schindler's List""... and the rest is history. To see Fiennes go from playing a tormented hero to an evil man with no shred of human kindness is extraordinary. Binoche is doubly excellent in the movie.

902429,2,6304595247,"Overview:
Film is heavy on narration, with a female narrator. The narrator allows a large amount of action to be told rather than experienced. Additionally, the film is rather cheesy. Furthermore, this adaptation emphasizes the love story between Catherine and Heathcliff.

I recommend the 1998 Masterpiece Theatre adaptation. Below, I have listed some points of comparison/contrast to show why I think the 1998 is better.

1.
Nelly's character is much better developed in 1998 adaptation. In fact, minor characters are overall better developed in 1998 adaptation.

2.
Heathcliff appears more sincerely distraught in 1998 adaptation. He appears more insane in 1992 adaptation.

3.
Class and historical, time-sensitive issues are covered better in 1998 adaptation than 1992 adaptation (ex: Catherine's desire to marry Edgar for money. Heathcliff's desire to have Catherine II marry Linton so he could obtain Thrushcross Grange).

4.
1998 adaptation shows the story better by visual sequences rather than just a narrator's voice. In other words, the 1998 adaptation is more interesting than the 1992 adaptation.

5.
1992 adaptation does keep two points that the 1998 adaptation does not. (1) It keeps the beautiful/stormy weather scene, and (2) The scene where Catherine tells Heathcliff that if he kisses her again, she will die.

6.
1992 adaptation is 16:9 aspect ratio. The 1998 adaptation is 4:3 ratio. Therefore, the 1992 adaptation has the better picture quality for most wide-screen televisions.",1247529600,2,1500,5.467532467532467

902432,5,6304595247,"Irritated beyond belief after hearing that annoying Kate Bush song ""Wuthering Heights"", I thought I'd rather be shot in the kneecap with a .22 then actually watch the movie. I finally gave in when Ralph Fiennes made a toss at it.
Most people already know the story of Heathcliff; humiliated as a child, he gets even with his tormentors when he grows up and his revenge isn't so sweet, least of all Heathcliff. I'm just going to focus on Fiennes in this review. He is so hot, it's unbelievable. This is the film that put him in my NUMBER ONE CELEBRITY CRUSH position, a title he still holds to this day. The looks he gives, I guess some people would say he's overacting but noooooo, he isn't. He's just so super hot some people can't handle what a `true player for reals' he is. You should totally buy this movie. It's only like $1.00 used but if you do buy it, I swear to God you'll be crushing on Ralph just like me.
And he's a really good actor, which you can tell because if you just watch him you can feel every word he says. He was trained at RADA and it's obvious he's a skilled actor, especially when he's beating on someone or slapping some chick or throwing dishes around. Also, I read that the girl that played Cathy, Juliette Binoche, had no formal training and was discovered working at Boots. I'm sorry but it shows. She was obviously English trying to do a French accent trying to do an English accent and I was like, just be English, duh.
This version of Wuthering Heights is the best because that Kate Bush song is not in it at all and because they used Ralph Fiennes for Heathcliff. The Ryuichi Sakamoto song was very irritating, too.

902495,2,6304595247,"It's a bit of a disaster, this movie.  I thought I ought to try and balance out the 5-star reviews that top the pile of most recent comments with a few of my own before anyone actually buys the DVD.  Rent it first, if you still can, and see what you think.  Like any movie from a book, it's bound to draw comparisons with the original story.  If you're not familiar with the story you might think oh, it's a bit odd, but not so bad.  If you are familiar with the story but you've never been to Yorkshire and met Yorkshire people, you still might think it's ok. If you can really get inside Bronte's Yorkshire, and the character and temperament of people you are likely to meet there, this picture is a joke. I'm sure Miss Bronte would titter at this effort to dramatize her novel. Juliette Binoche is woefully miscast and her acting is uncomfortably contrived in some scenes.  Ralph Fiennes is about as much a brooding Yorkshire gypsy with smouldering looks as I am a fairy princess; he's just plain psycho.  And where did that ridiculous house come from?  The Earnshaw's home sums it all up; it's as if a B movie director wanted to shoot a Hollywood version of the England of his imagination on a Culver City backlot without ever actually going there. Rather than gaunt, the house is almost funny, a parody of a gothic-horror Victorian villa. And to top it off, there are so many irritating small details.  Not only does the house look fake, but Fiennes wig isn't fit to stand close-ups and in one scene where a fire is supposed to be glowing in the hearth the light looks like it is cast from a lamp on one of those electric glow fireplaces you find in the hardware stores around Christmas.  Picky picky, yes, but irritating and destroying the chance for credibility. You don't want to be drawn to an actor's wig in an important scene.  So yes, it follows the book, but flippin' heck, sometimes it's like following one of those ""compressed Shakespeare"" plays.  You know, the entire works in 5 minutes.  You may have to pause the DVD once or twice for everyone to catch up on exactly who's who and what happened before the camera got there.  All a bit sad really.  Wuthering Heights is a fiercely dramatic story that is obviously difficult to compress into movie length and to play convincingly.  I'm still waiting for the definitive screen version to arrive.  It will be worth it.  In the meantime, this one is probably best forgotten.",1217980800,2,2437,4.5125284738041005
902496,5,6304595247,"The performance of Binoche and Finness in Wuthering Heights was amazingly powerful. People often criticize the movie, but, I believe, the director was extraordinarily faithful to the original story.  All criticism was directed at how sadistic Heathcliff(Ralph Fiennes) was towards everybody. It is the director's right to add or omit whatever he finds necessary to make a movie version of the book. In this case, the director's choice was to have the characters semi identical to the book's original ones.

It's very simple, if you loved the novel, you would love the movie and forgive the portions that were omitted, and admire the total focus on Heathcliff's anger, and evil side. It's not the movie/director/actors' fault that the novel original characters are actually defected, imperfect human beings.

Even though Wuthering Heights is a great piece of literature, a wild emotional story that is written in a fascinating way, the characters always puzzled me. If everybody is calling Heathcliff a sadistic crazy man, what then is Catherine? I believe that Catherine is even more sadistic and cruel than any other character in the novel.

Catharine was completely engaged in self worship and didn't care about any other human being.  The only thing she loved about Heathcliff was his love and devotion to her.  She enjoyed breaking his heart, breaking her husband's heart, and enjoyed torturing Edgar's sister with her sense of entitlement to Heathcliff and his love.

""..Why did you betray your heart Catherine?....I forgive my murderer, but yours, I will never forgive..."" yeah, Fiennes got to me saying these words, but for the love of God, how delusional can people be? Nobody broke Heathcliff's heart but his Catherine, and no one killed Catherine.

Five stars, to Wuthering Heights for its timeless depiction of human dark side, and when I say dark side, I mean every character in the movie except Catharine the daughter. To me, Catharine the daughter is the only character with some common sense and virtue.

It's a story of obsession, revenge and destruction, and finally of rebirth in the next generation. (Remind anybody of Tess of the D'Urbervilles? It should.)
This is an excellent film version. I watched it over twice in the same sitting. (And, I've read the book.)You could hardly imagine a more sinister tale better told than this. The main characters' utter devotion to their own little world at the thoughtless expense of all else comes through loud and clear.

But the movie managed to make the characters somewhat lovable, or at the very least pitiable, and just had an overall better feel to it. They left out parts, thankfully, that weren't needed, or brought the already less than likable characters to a worse standing. I cried repeatedly watching this, and it was just an overall good experience. So basically, I definitely recommend the movie, but warn against the book. However, I would suggest heavily Charlotte Bronte's 'Jane Eyre'- it is my favorite novel of all time, and seeing that Emily Bronte is Charlotte's sister their writing style....or rather eloquence in writing is similar.",1192233600,2,803,5.090909090909091

This is the first film production that entails both generations of the Earnshaws and Lintons.  As a Graduate student of English, I am very familiar with the text and I find this version is adequate and fascinating.  Ralph Fiennes utilizes his ever-charismatic talent for drama to pull-off the complex and dark Heathcliff character. Binoche gives and exceptional ""I am Heathcliff"" speech.  I was able to follow the text along with the movie's scenes.  There are some variations, and I am biased since I stand forthright in my allegiance to text rather than film.  One of the main aspects of Heathcliff's character in the text is his envy for the blue eyes of Linton and Fiennes' blue eyes are a bit distracting in the movie.  The film industry has yet to really apply the physical description of Heathcliff to film version.  But, this version is perfectly tuned into the Gothic and dreary features of the text.",1191024000,3,1073,5.62111801242236

Those wigs worn by Ralph Fiennes and others distracted me for they were so bad.  I cannot watch Ralph Fiennes most of the time and here he is not believable.  Give me Sir Lawrence Olivier anytime. Sir Lawrence, though he did not get along with Merle Oberon during the filming, showed so much passion in the B/W version and even Timothy Dalton was tolerable.  Juliette Binoche was boring and silly and my darling Jeremy Northam was hardly visable.",1186790400,,580,4.548076923076923
902566,4,6304595247,"I enjoyed this film from beginning to end and recommend it.  I'm not sure exactly why I didn't give it five stars.  Perhaps because it failed to live up to my memory of the book, which I read  many, many years ago and my memory of  the Lawrence Olivier screen version.  Both of those probably formed ""my"" Heathcliff, which was different from Ralph Fiennes'.  ""My Heathcliff"" was stockier, more physical, craggier, (looking more like Beethovan!)  Fiennes' is more mental and serpentine.

However all of that is personal and Fiennes' performance is certainly powerful and convincing.  I felt a sympathy for him, too, even in his last, most monstrous days.  The scene in which he grabs Cathy from the coffin is memorable.

I was a little disappointed in the performance of Juliette Binoche.  There was something unconvincing in her Cathy. Another reviewer suggested that she lacked the necessary qualities to play an English country girl. I'm not sure exactly how to define those qualities but I tend to agree with that comment.  Perhaps she was less firey than the original.

I agree with others, too, that the sequences were choppy and somewhat rushed, especially in the second half.  But it's hard to fit all of the novel into two hours.  I did like the ending a lot.

In sum, it's a great story, very well done and certainly worth watching.",1180224000,,1341,4.786026200873362

902569,3,6304595247,"Not to say that Ralph and Juliette are not fantastic actors in their own right, they are just not Cathy and Heathcliff.  This production lacked so much of the novel's mood, that it just seemed esthetically boring.  I personally would never hire that cinematographer again if I were the director/producer.  I have YET to see a film version of Wuthering Heights that can do justice to Emily's art.  I am not under some naive assumption that movies based on novels always turn out great (just look at Stephen King movies - BLECH!) - however we all thought that The Lord of the Rings could never be done properly, and then Peter Jackson came along to wow us all.  It CAN be done with Wuthering Heights as well, and the great thing about it is, it would require no special effects.  Just a great director, a better script adaption, and some actors who have chemistry - unlike the two in this one.  They may be great, but again, they are no Heathcliff and Cathy.  I really wish someone would get this right.  Turn it into a miniseries ala Pride and Prejudice BBC style.  Maybe they could get Clive Owen to play Heathcliff..... he would be a great one.  Tall, dark, brooding, dangerously handsome.  Perfect Heathcliff.  Grrrrrrrrr.... ok enough of my Clive Owen fantasies.

Seriously though, it is the best adaptation so far, but not even close to being perfect.  Filmmakers need to stop trying to turn this into a 90 minute theater picture and do it right with a BBC miniseries that has some meat to it, just like the novel. Look what they did with Jane Eyre! I really did not care much for the novel or anything else Charlotte tried to do, but they did a great job with that one. I actually loved it.

Love the casting of Sinead O'Connor as EB herself at the beginning and end! The soundtrack is about the only element that gets to be a bit much - that same series of notes over and over doesn't really do justice to the visuals. Even though Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche are visibly considerably older than the teenaged- to early-twenties Heathcliffe and Catherine of the story, they are very believable. Other presentations of Wuthering Heights have a polished, ""sexy"" Heathcliffe who just isn't right since Heathcliffe is a monster through and through. Fiennes carries it off beautifully with a barely sublimated savagery showing through every scene, yet remains sympathetic somehow. Binoche's mischievous smirk is perfect for the Cathy who is more succubus than, for instance, Merle Oberon's glamorous princess in the 1939 version.

Juliet Binoche is Kathy flawlessly, wild and determined, together their chemistry is explosive.

Jason Riddington's performance as Hareton Earnshaw is heart breaking. this alone makes the movie worth watching. My only complaint and it's a small one, is that Juliet Binoche plays both Kathy Earshaw and Katherine Linton. It's slightly disconcerting, not to say she doesn't play it well.

Having watched this beautiful and haunting adaptation of one of my favorite novels of all time, I have to say that Ralph Fiennes has more than succeeded in bringing the aforementioned anti-hero to life.  Emily Bronte would have been proud.  Everyone who has read Wuthering Heights knows about the tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and how he becomes a dark, brooding, manipulative, diabolical man who takes his revenge on the people who he feels have wronged him and torn him away from Cathy, including her daughter and his own child and ward.  Fiennes brings out Heathcliff's many conflicting emotions flawlessly and his performance floored me.  Juliette Binoche as Cathy Linton/Catherine Earnshaw is great as well.  The supporting cast is quite splendid too -- no cardboard cutout performances here!  The backdrop of the moors is beautiful and gothic, just like Bronte described them in her book.  I am very impressed with this adaptation.  I haven't seen the 1939 film adaptation or the miniseries from Masterpiece Theater yet, but I wonder if they come close to this wonderful film.  The BBC will produce an adaptation some time next year and I think that Richard Armitage (North and South) would make a wonderful Heathcliff because he too could bring many nuances to his acting.

Cathy and Heathcliffe are not pleasant people, their love for each other turns to spite and inconsideration for everyone else in their world.

The novel is VERY dark but graphically real in the sense that Bronte captured the nuance of human emotions...emotions are suprising things, and each charater plays out their good and bad sides.

After viewing this movie, I was very pleased that finally someone did capture the spirit of the novel, it shows how Healthcliffe grows from being someone you sympathise with to a total complete tyrant...rather than forgiving, he holds on to the grudge of his past to torment the children of his beloved cathy and her brother Hindley.",1160784000,13,906,4.751592356687898

902627,4,6304595247,"When I saw this film in the theatrical release I thought it was beautifully done, but I was not happy with it.  I had been raised on the Merle Oberon/Lawrence Olivier version that is softer and more romantic.  So I finally read the book.  This version is publicized as ""a faithful adaptation"" of the book, and it is.  WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a venomous tale of two selfish, spiteful people obsessed with each other.  It shines a smokey lantern glare on how people do horrible things in the name of love.

Ralph Fiennes strides away with this film in a rip-roaring, seething gothic performance as love's prison keeper, Heathcliff.  Juliette Binoche gives a lovely performance, but is miscast in a number of ways that hold her back.  Her accent is noticeable, and takes us away from her - really wonderful - performance.  Playing a dual role, she is later saddled with blonde hair and blue contacts which are unconvincing and really distracting.  This is just a bad match of actress and role.

This simply makes the performance of Janet McTeer shine all the more.  Always a striking presence, her role as omnipresent viewer (the narrator of the book), and Cathy's confidante brings her to the center of our vision time and again, and she is always startlingly perfect.  McTeer is like the landscape used for much of the outdoor scenes.  Full, wild, solid, earthy and vast.

The Lynton siblings are both surprisingly good.  Pretty, wan, and slightly pasty pawns of the demonic lovers.  The score lifts all this, the fine performances, the grand story, and sets it firmly into a place of haunting melancholy.

But it is the landscapes that will be remembered long after any other portion of this film.  The locations are unique and interesting, and give the romantic scenes the visual austerity and dis-ease of an Edgar Allen Poe poem.  The beautiful filming of these vistas say as much as the story itself.  Romance on the rocks with an eternal twist.",1153353600,11,1945,4.7807807807807805

However, nothing really matches this rendition and Ralph Fiennes is absolutely Heathcliff.  You feel the pain, anger, hate, and obsessive love with every scene in this film and it truly follows the book more closely than any other version I have seen. Like I said in the past, this used to be my least favorite of the classics.  Now I must confess I believe it is my favorite.  I love this tragic love story and believe the Fiennes/Binoche performances exceed all others.  You become totally immersed in Heathcliff's suffering and his need to strike out at all who have hurt and abused him and kept him pushed down so that there was never any hope of his obtaining a position that would allow him to marry Cathy.  One of the strange things about this story to me is that Heathcliff is the bad guy throughout but I notice that his actions are really reactions to others' cruelty to him.  At least this seems true up to the time he is a young man at which point his major abusive behavior kicks in.  And, Cathy is always pointing out his ill-kempt appearance, seemingly forgetting that he is forced to live in the stables and has one set of rags to wear.  This is a part of this story that has always irritated me about Cathy and her taunting behavior and lack of compassion for his predicament.  Anyway, you must do yourself a big favor and get this movie.  You will not be disappointed believe me, and you wll find yourself choosing to watch this over and over again.  And, one other important thing: no matter how difficult it is to like some of these characters, they all reach your heart in some way at some time in this film.

902631,2,6304595247,"I know that you're not supposed to question the merit of Victorian classics, but I will commit the ultimate blasphemy and say that ""Wuthering Heights"" is not a very good book.  Emilie Bronte just doesn't not measure up to her sister Charlotte.  At least in ""Jane Eyre"" there is actual drama, tragedy, mystery.  None of that is present in ""Wurtherin Heights"".  It's a provincial laid-back coming of age story.

First of all, the whole love element is very clumsily executed.  I just can't imagine how you can develop romantic feelings for someone who's been like a brother to you for over 10 years.

Second, when Victorians try to experiment with multiculturalism, they fail miserably.  Who is Healthcliff after all?  Is he a gypsy or an Indian prince?  The ambiguity of his origin is quite laughable.  There is a good reason why you should write about what you know.  Emily Bronte obviosly did not know the difference between a gypsy and an Indian.  To her it was all the same.  As long as the man is not English, he can be a Maori, for all she cares.  Mr. Fiennes, the actor, is better off playing an English patient, who is actually a Hungarian nobleman, than an Indian-gypsy prince.

Third, the actors in this particular movie are too old.  In the book they are supposed to be in their early 20s.  Well, in the movie they look well in their mid-30s.  A little too old to steal first kisses, don't you think?",1140480000,2,1410,4.568
902659,3,6304595247,"What would probably give you a pretty accurate idea about this movie is the curious fact that each (but one) of the 30+ reviews I read - some were extremely positive and others just as extremely negative - made a point I couldn't disagree with.

Like many people said, the 1992 version was hauntingly faithful to the atmosphere of the book. It did have just the right sets and cinematography. It did feature the most Wuthering soundtrack that could ever have been composed. Ralph Fiennes did do a fabulous job capturing Heathcliff's essence. I could go on.

At the same time, like many people said, the script was rushed, choppy and less than friendly to people not familiar with the book. Juliette Binoche was BADLY miscast and Bronte's original lines were often butchered into overly sentimental drivel. I could go on.

My guess is no future adaptation will manage to match this one's soundtrack, its Heathcliff, or its overal look and feel. It's all the more disappointing then that a movie with so much genuine potential and great choices managed to very effectively undo everything it did right - completely right, as far as I'm concerned. Still, it's well worth seeing, not to mention hearing (I'm referring to the OST).

Should you need more examples of the odd mix of brilliance and inadequacy this adaptation offers before vieweing it, just keep reading the reviews. Chances are each is correct. And speaking of customer reviews, I need to comment on one review in particular. Generally, when people read a 2 page work starting with ""I'm not a Bronte fan. Decidedly not. Her work amounts to a 19 century soap opera"", they assume the person who wrote it is familiar with the writer/work in question. That being so, the user called ""A. Joseph Haschka"", prolific a reviewer as he's proved to be, should avoid making references to, let alone mocking at, books he admits to having never read. It undermines the validity of whatever point he's attempting to make.",1138406400,5,1966,4.824925816023739
902660,5,6304595247,"Life in the English moors takes on a whole new meaning when you see Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fiennes smolder on screen. In the midst of haunting music, and beautiful scenery, Fiennes gives the performance of his life in this tearjerker. Timothy Dalton's portrayal (1970 version) was wonderful. But, Fiennes portrays the despised, rejected, afflicted, dejected, conflicted, tormented, furious Heathclilff to a fault. The way he breaks through the door, and grabs up Catherine's corpse and weeps, leaves you crying right along with him. We see his passion, rage, deep seeded heartbreak and torment. That's true love, I say-- not being able to let go. And that's what leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.

Juliet Binoche polishes off Fienne's performance with her magnificent portrayal of the beautiful, lighthearted, frivolous, conflicted Catherine whose genuine love for two men leaves her in torment.  But, the added pleasure is that this movie keeps to the original plot to the beautiful and gripping ending in which the narrator says: 'and some swear on their bibles that he still walks.'

902661,5,6304595247,"This is a story about two people that cannot live without eachother, but really cannot be said to love eachother, save in the very loosest sense of the word.  Each love in a passionate, wilful, and selfish way, perfectly willing to let the other suffer any measure of pain as it fits into their plans of advancement (on Cathy's part) or revenge (on Heathcliffe's part, and eventually Cathy's part as well.).

 Each of these parts is played well, Ralph Fiennes of course does an exceptional job of Heathcliffe, while Cathy is very annoying, but all in a true-to-the-book way.

  Into the story comes Edgar Linton, the docile, lamb-like rival lover of Cathy Earnshaw, who is really such an honourable sort you can't dislike him, but so timid and retiring you can't respect him either.  He is the perfect counter to Heathcliffe, who is passionate where Linton is incapable of very strong feelings at all, savage where Linton is refined, poor where Linton is brought up in luxury, and immoral where Linton is principled.  Linton is played as he should be, with an embarrassingly weak personality, which shrinks from violence even in protecting himself or his loved ones.

  The story for the most part consists of the various ways in which these three principle characters make each other completely miserable, especially Heathcliffe, whose goal in life after Cathy dies is to bring as much misery on Linton, who was the chosen rival, as is possible, which he does by convincing Linton and Cathy's daughter that she is in love with his son (her cousin), a carbon copy of Linton without the refinements and gentleness, a selfish, sickly sort of vermin.  In the end, the younger Cathy is forced to marry him, soon after he dies, leaving her to the care of Heathcliffe, whose chief aim is to use her as a means of fulfilling his revenge. The movie here is very good at portraying the squalid, hopeless misery in which Cathy (te younger)lives, turning her into a shrewish, bitter young woman, whose only friends in the world are Ellen Dean, the narrarator of the story, and her other cousin, who is in love with her, but is uneducated and coarse, and repulsive to her.  All ends well, however, with Heathcliffe dead, and Cathy falling in love after all with her cousin, who isn't really stupid at all, only brought up to be brutish.

 The movie is a for the most part true interpretation of the book, capturing the spirit as well as the facts of the story.",1136851200,6,2448,4.713615023474178

I love most versions I've seen for one reason or another. But the 1939 story was too melodramatic and over acted. (Lightning strikes behind Merle Oberon when she declares ""I AM Heathcliff!""with her eys bugged out.  And they are way too virtuous! These are PASSIONATE people! Passion is not always pretty.

Timothy Dalton was great as Heathcliff but his leading lady was homely and the entire story wasn't told.

The most recent Masterpiece Theatre production was good, but the actors were a little long in the tooth to be the Cathy and Heathcliff of my imagination and Nelly was not given the role written for her, in my opinion.

The foreign language versions just aren't ""ENGLISH"" enough! This is the story of Celts and Angles!

Anyhow this is the onw that catches the characters for me!

This is the ine that makes me cry and the actors say the lines closest to the way I imagined they shoud be said when I read them during my romantic college days!

Not only are the casting, production and direction first class, the movie also features some richly nuanced performances by Fiennes and Binoche. All of the above is also carried along by a beautiful and haunting film score.

One of my favorite films, this film has excellence in all its elements; the sensitivity of Peter Kominsky's direction, Mike Souther's gorgeous cinematography shot on location in North Yorkshire, and the loveliest of soundtracks by Ryuichi Sakamoto are the canvas onto which the elegance and fluidity of Emily Bronte's words are painted, and it's the words that I delight in most of all...there is no end to the times I can watch this film, just to hear them.
Comparing this film to the 1939 version is a hopeless pursuit, as both are vastly different, and one film should not take the shine from the other, as one cannot evaluate whether Rembrandt is better than Van Gogh.

Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as Heathcliff, in a performance that reveals more of its complexity and dark passion with every viewing, with his brooding looks and a violence that is never far from the surface. Juliette Binoche is luminous as Cathy (as well as her daughter in the latter part of the film), and though I do admit she lapses into a French accent from time to time, I don't think it minimizes her wonderful performance.
The supporting cast is superb, with Janet McTeer as Ellen, Sophie Ward as Isabella, Simon Shepherd as Edgar, and Jeremy Northam as Hindley.
Sinead O'Connor is effective as Emily Bronte, in the beginning and end of the film, and also narrating portions of the film, with her soft, misty voice.
I find this a magical adaptation...a gloriously written and visually captivating gothic romance, a battle of wills and hearts, vengeance and a love that goes beyond the grave. Total running time is 107 minutes.",1112918400,13,1662,4.790940766550523

I thought perhaps since movies are more visual this might alter my opinion, but it did not.  I don't know why Cathy and Heathcliff are considered to have had such a grande tragic love.  I don't really understand the appeal of the Cathy character at all.  Why do the men in her life find her so irresistable?  She seems completely self-absorbed and brings most of her troubles on herself, and certainly doesn't exert herself to change any of the bad things that happen.  Also, this film seems to have really toned down the Cathy character.  In the book she was sort of fiery and volatile.  In this she's not much of anythng.  It drives me nuts.  Plus, Juliette Binoche who I ususally consider quite beautiful for some reason looked strange to me in this role.  Maybe her hair was too poofy, I don't know.

Wuthering Heights, the book, is not a straightforward love story. It's complex, dark, and intelligent. Cathy and Heathcliff are not textbook lovers. In fact, they are not lovers at all. Mostly, they're just mad people, who have a very deep connection.
This film, is a love story. The writers have taken the characters and plot, raped, pillaged, violated and completely mutated them, leaving only their names intact. Cathy is turned from a volatile, spoilt maniac, into a flailing heroine. Heathcliff is turned from a ferocious, abusive animal, into a romantic hero

902739,3,6304595247,"Peter's Kosminsky's version of Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS is true to the angst-ridden torment that is Heathcliff's life.  In the 1939 version, Heathcliff was played by Sir Lawrence Olivier in a subdued and sympathetic way.  In this 1992 adaption, Heathcliff is Ralph Fiennes, who plays his character as more sadistic than tormented.  Comparisons to Olivier are both unfortunate and illuminating.  Olivier was cruel toward Catherine and Hindley, but his cruelty was tightly focused.  Fiennes' cruelty is more generalized, almost as if he is lashing out at the world of which Catherine and Hindley are but symbols.  Fiennes in his animus is so over the top that he very quickly loses the sympathy of the viewer.  How one sees the development of Heathcliff goes a long way toward determining how one sees the novel or the film.  In the novel, Bronte has pages aplenty to prepare the reader for the many and extended time jumps to account for the rounding of Heathcliff, Catherine, and others.  In the 1939 film, some judicious editing allowed the excising of extraneous material after the death of Catherine, that allowed the focus of that film to remain pure and undiluted.  Unfortunately, the 1992 version is so faithful to the novel that the horrendous nature of Heathcliff's inner demons remain at the forefront at all times.  Unlike Bronte, director Kosminsky does not have the luxury to gradually permit a believable segue from one plot complication to another.  What he does show are confusing time shifts, lack of character development (especially with Hindley and Hareton), and a bottled-up sense of agida that has no place to go to but implode.  Juliet Binoche in a double role of Catherine and Cathy is irritatingly whiny and uncertain of her feelings and motivations.  The primary fault of the 1992 WUTHERING HEIGHTS is that it tries too hard to replicate totally in less than two hours what Emily Bronte more successfully accomplished in nearly three hundred pages.",1073001600,41,1981,5.055384615384615

902746,3,6304595247,"This is the second time I've seen a screen adaptation of Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS in the past month. It's not that I'm a Bronte fan. Decidedly not. But I wanted to compare this 1992 version starring Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes with the 1970 production starring Anna Calder-Marshall and Timothy Dalton. An intellectual exercise, if you will.
OK, ok. I just wanted to ogle Juliette Binoche.
I've never actually read WUTHERING HEIGHTS, and never will. So, my understanding of this 19th century soap comes entirely from the two films. A landed Yorkshire gentleman, Mr. Earnshaw, brings home a young orphan boy, whom he names Heathcliff, to live at WUTHERING HEIGHTS with his family, which includes daughter Cathy and son Hindley. Heathcliff and Cathy spend their formative years roaming the wild moors, and become devoted to each other. When the elder Earnshaw dies, Hindley, who hates Heathcliff, demotes him to servant status. In the meantime, Cathy picks up the ways of a lady during a lengthy stay in the manor house of the local magistrate, Mr. Linton, where she first meets his son, Edgar. Returning to WH, Cathy is put off by Heathcliff's roughness and poor hygiene. Now, in short order, Hindley's wife dies giving birth to son Hareton; Edgar proposes to Cathy; Heathcliff disappears; Cathy marries Edgar; Heathcliff returns after years ""on the road"", now cleaned up and moneyed; Heathcliff exacts vengeance on the Earnshaws and the Lintons.
The most obvious difference between the '70 and '92 versions is that the former considerably foreshortens the original Bronte plot, and ends with the death of Cathy shortly after she gives birth to her daughter, Catherine Linton. In that interpretation, Heathcliff (Dalton) pines away from loss and soon joins her. In the more recent version, Heathcliff (Fiennes) lives on many years to make life miserable for the second generation, i.e. Catherine, Hareton, and his own son, Linton, by Edgar's sister, Isabella. (Why couldn't Heathcliff have named his son ""Bob"", just to keep the numerous Lintons straight in my mind?)
The '92 WH suffers considerably from only superficially touching on the early years of Heathcliff and Cathy when they came to love each other while running wild over the Dales. It's that bond, broken by Cathy's marriage to Edgar, that causes Heathcliff to snap. Because the '70 version dwells more extensively on these ""missing"" years, this viewer felt a modicum of sympathy for Dalton's Heathcliff when he gets ugly. The Fiennes Heathcliff simply comes across as a psycho, though the intensity of the actor's portrayal makes his Heathcliff truly scary.
I can't get enough of Juliette Binoche, so her dual roles as both Cathy and her daughter Catherine gave her enough screen time to satisfy even me. Well, perhaps casting her first as a brunette and then a blonde was a bit contrived. But Lady Clairol manages that thousands of times every day, so who am I to quibble?
I'm giving this version of WUTHERING HEIGHTS three stars not because it's lacking in itself, but in relation to the '70 version, which gets the plot's message across in a simpler manner, and to which I gave four stars. Emily Bronte's storyline is just so depressing as it is. If I'm going to watch a chick flick, give me an amusing piece based on a frivolous Jane Austen book. At least it's sunnier in the south of England.
And by the way. What did they farm at WUTHERING HEIGHTS, anyway? Sheep, I suppose. But it may as well have been rocks since we see more of those than wool-on-the-hoof.",1053216000,7,3541,4.942953020134228
902777,4,6304595247,"Emily Bronte's poetically bleak novel WUTHERING HEIGHTS is intensely involved, encompassing a span of almost thirty-five years, and taking in the likes of three generations.  Certainly it must take at least a good five hours to do this story notable justice on the screen.  I therefore kept any anticipation of a truly cohesive telling of this tale well in check as I approached it; most assuredly expecting shortcomings and, if I must say so myself, quite successfully sought and found whatever might be the finer qualities of such a story portrayed on film.  For though a number of movie adaptations had previously been made, it was not until this divine 1992 film that the whole poignant tale got told from the very beginning to the very end.
Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are the ill-starred couple Cathy and Heathcliff.  Heathcliff is an orphan found in Liverpool and brought home as a young child by Cathy's father, Mr. Earnshaw, a Yorkshire farmer, to be raised within the family.  Cathy and Heathcliff develop a strong bond between them as they grow up.  After Mr. Earnshaw dies, and his estate is left in the hands of his heir, Cathy's older brother Hindley, Heathcliff is cast down from the place of a beloved adopted son to that of a servant and farmhand.  Then the ideal friendship that Cathy and Heathcliff had shared as children becomes further corrupted when Edgar Linton and his sister Isabella, son and daughter of a magistrate residing in a neighboring estate, enter the picture.  What follows is a battle of wills, marked by moments of feverish passion, jealousy, a marriage proposal, a disappearance, and a quest for revenge.  Fiennes and Binoche have their moments, and they lead a fairly well known cast - Janet McTeer as the maid Nelly, Simon Shepard as Edgar, Sophie Ward as Isabella, and Jeremy Northam as Hindley.
Originally, in the novel, it is the Earnshaw's servant girl, Nelly, who narrates this story.  This movie, however, takes on a somewhat venturous liberty by casting Sinead O'Connor to tell the tale, in the personage of author Emily Bronte.  Wuthering Heights is a castle of sorts, a bit more grand than imagined in the novel.  Notwithstanding though, the artistic landscape imagery in this movie is exquisite.
The role of Cathy is a difficult one, to be sure - and I've yet to see an actress wholly capture her tempestuous nature.  Truly Binoche is a very fine actress, as well as a rare beauty.  Her looks and mannerisms, however, are somewhat too exotically European - and her accent is markedly French.  She presents a rather mature, less impulsive Cathy, which does not at all strike one as a wild Yorkshire farm girl. In the whole of this film, there were only two scenes in which the intensity of her performance even came close to the power of the novel - that when she's telling Nelly about Edgar Linton's marriage proposal, and the scene where, in a fever after Heathcliff has run off with Isabella, she sends her soliloquy through an open window into the blustering night air.  Both these scenes take from the book some of Bronte's most beautiful language.
Ralph Fiennes is also a very fine actor - and he's especially adept at playing brooding characters with a lot of pent up passion brewing under the surface.  He approaches Heathcliff in this same manner.  But Heathcliff in his younger years is something of a raging wild animal, too emotionally immature to keep his fury under wraps.  Indeed, I must say Fiennes' Heathcliff misses the mark by no small distance, especially in those scenes which take place before Cathy's death.  Like Binoche, he is simply too mature - his Heathcliff is just not believable as a farm hand who's only around the age of 20.  It is actually in the scenes that take place after Cathy's death that Fiennes' performance really kicks in:  despairing madman, obsessive necromancer - he plays it up to the fullest extreme of ruthless wickedness.  In administering revenge upon those he hates he's downright scary.
I was rather disappointed that two major characters from the novel, Nelly and Hindley, were herein given so little attention.  A key scene from the book - in which Hindley, recruiting a rifle and some assistance from Isabella, tries to eliminate Heathcliff - was completely omitted in this movie.  Both Northam and McTeer put forth flawless performances for what little screen time they're given - but I believe that certain plot holes and transitional errors occurred due to the fact that these two were not fully drawn out.  The third generation - Hindley's son Hareton (Jason Riddington) is ruggedly good looking; Jonathan Firth (brother of Colin Firth) plays Heathcliff's decrepit son Linton with relish; however, the fact that Binoche took on dual roles - as both Cathy and, with a blond wig, her daughter Catherine Linton - rather made me cringe.  The scene in which Heathcliff exacts his revenge upon Catherine, who looks essentially the same as the supposed great love of his life, just didn't sit well with me at all.
For a more accurate portrayal of Cathy and Heathcliff in the early years before their children are born, look to a 1971 version of WUTHERING HEIGHTS starring Timothy Dalton and Anna Calder-Marshall.  As for this version, I really must say that even with its various shortcomings, it's overall a very lovely, entertaining movie.",1051747200,19,5352,4.883977900552487

Certainly ""Wuthering Heights"" - the novel - doesn't pretend to be a slice of reality, but nevertheless, its author (for all her famous reclusiveness) knew her local history and inhabitants.  Her descriptions of people and places ring true - even in the early years of the 21st Century.
Where, then, does this version go wrong?
Firstly, I have to question seriously how carefully Peter Kosminsky read his source material.  ""Wuthering Heights"" is a cussed book that doesn't fit comfortably into any film mogul's neat pigeon holes.  Previous film versions have tried to turn it into a classic ""romance"" and have, in the process, fatally diminished the power of the writing.  It isn't a ""romantic"" story at all, but this version - in spite of early and promising signs to the contrary - eventually treads the same, familiar route.
Ralph Fiennes was an interesting, if misjudged, choice for Heathcliff.  There are indications that - if given the opportunity - he could have produced a fascinating performance.  Occasionally and (very) briefly he provides flashes of brilliance which make you wish he could have followed his own instincts.  All too plainly, however, he was being constrained by his paymasters.
Juliette Binoche stood no chance as either of the Catherines.  She was young, French and at sea.  Asking ANY young actress to get her brain ""around"" Catherine the Elder AND Catherine the Younger would have been inconceivable:  asking a young FRENCH actress to do so was total insanity.  To her eternal credit, Ms Binoche comes out the chaos with her dignity intact - but I somehow doubt she includes this film on her CV too often.
...  Mr Fiennes does a stalwart job with an impossible man but - possibly due to post-production cuts - the end result is ""just"" grubby and ill-tempered.  There WAS a superb performance in here somewhere - and at another time, with another Director, it might have been a different story.
Is it worth watching?  Well - perhaps - on a wet day when you have nothing else better to do.  Janet McTeer is - as always - superb as Nelly Dean and Jeremy Northam stakes his claim as the tormentor-turned-tormented Hindley (and I think I agree that there was a Heathcliff in there somewhere ...).
The music by Ryuichi Sakamoto is memorable - and has subsequently rightly become a collector's classic.  The choices of location are interesting and beautiful, but a little dubious as far as Emily Bronte's original ""vision"" is concerned.  She had in mind an amalgam of the landscape outside Halifax and her own local moors - NOT the clint fields of Wharfedale.  Cinematically, they're stunning - but pragmatically, they're distracting.
This is an interesting film, but it's NOT ""Wuthering Heights"" - and towards the end I actually began to find it a bit boring - not to mention unintentionally hilarious.
For an afternoon's undemanding entertainment, this is fine.  ...",1041206400,10,3314,4.859430604982206
902781,1,6304595247,"With a cast including Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, Jeremy Northam and Janet McTeer this SHOULD have been the definitive version of Emily Bronte's classic novel.  Unfortunately, it just isn't.  Although its individual components are, in places, excellent - Sakamoto's exquisite score, the locations, one or two of the performances - the whole film fails to gel.
Partly, it is because the usually excellent Ralph Fiennes shouldn't have been cast as Heathcliff.  He has virtually admitted as much himself - and is on record as saying that the film didn't work and was a miserable experience that very nearly put him off films completely.
Juliette Binoche doesn't fare any better.  She was, at the time, simply unequal to the dual roles of both Catherines.
That both actors subsequently went on to prove their cinematic worth only makes the waste of their talents here all the worse.
Janet McTeer and Jeremy Northam turn in excellent performances as Nelly Dean and Hindley - indeed watching Jeremy Northam, I found myself wishing that HE had been cast as Heathcliff - but they alone cannot rescue this film from itself.  In fact, at times, they seem to be in an entirely different film.
Perhaps it is a little too much to expect total authenticity in a film, but the ""Yorkshire"" recreated by Peter Kosminsky and his set designers looks totally unreal and bears no relation at all to the world Emily Bronte knew and wove her story around.  They would have been well-advised to do a little more research into conditions in the north Pennines around the turn of the 19th Century (the book opens in 1801).  In fact, they might have been well-advised simply to read the book more closely.
And what on EARTH possessed them to have Emily Bronte herself plodding cross the tops to open and close the film?  What was the point?  It comes across as nothing more than a silly conceit - rather like the whole film.
A wasted opportunity - and a terrible misuse of a talented cast.  We can only be grateful that it didn't take its lead players down with it.",1040515200,11,2043,4.745762711864407
902782,4,6304595247,"Someone from Yorkshire, England wrote:  ""[Fiennes] never really gets to grips with Heathcliff's complexities, and ends up looking just bad-tempered and greasy.""
RUBBISH.  Most people living during that time were bad-tempered and greasy. If you don't want to see some unrealistic, 1930's Hollywood melodrama of Bronte's novel, or some 70's or 80's film version that plays like a bad American soap opera or made for TV movie, then this version is worth viewing.
Although short cited in some details, this is a well-cast, well-acted film.  Fiennes is haunted and realistic as Heathcliff, complex in his obsessions and oppressions.  Binoche is also good, although her minor role as Catherine is more touching and believable than that of Cathy.  Supporting roles by McTeer, Northam, and others are also praiseworthy.  My only regret is that the Catherine / Hereton / Linton Heathcliff storyline is not given more treatment (but at least a majority of it made it into this adaptation).
As previously noted, Ryuichi Sakamoto's score is brilliant and haunting.  The score often elevates the film beyond the director's lack of style.

902784,4,6304595247,"I discovered this film while helping my son understand Emily Bronte's passionate novel.  Unlike the other more popular older classic with Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier in the roles of Cathy and Heathcliff, this adaptation does not end with Cathy's death by the open window in Heathcliff's arms.  The Juliette Binoche-Ralph Fiennes collaboration faithfully follows the course of the novel through the two generations of Heathcliffs, Earnshaws and Lintons and for this reason is extrememly helpful to anyone needing supplementation while reading the novel.

Especially stirring is Ralph Fiennes as Heathcliff, although I would have liked to have seen his character without the slick-backed pitch-black hair.  As Wuthering Heights is a story of a sheltered community of few individuals where emotions run as wild as the ravaging weather and revenge and obsession are the confused results of a union mistakenly kept apart, I thought Fiennes' portrayal of the tortured antihero true to Bronte's vision.
Fiennes as Heathcliff concentrates on and never forgets his storeroom of inner pain.  His inner scars sear through in his every word and deed especially in the hour following his Cathy's death. His anger smolders from within and one can quite believe that he is haunted by both inner and outer demons.  Any tangible softness is noticeable only when thinking or speaking of his lost love and this one-track intensity more than adequately demonstrates the character's obsession with destruction and revenge.  For all these reasons, Fiennes captures the literary Heathcliff magnificently.
On the otherhand, his performance is hindered by Juliette Binoche's less than satisfactory portrayal of Cathy Earnshaw and her daughter Catherine Linton. Binoche is certainly no Cathy, at least not the Cathy envisioned while reading Emily Bronte's novel.  She is too reserved; there is a mischievious quality beneath the surface, but just barely beneath it, she doesn't blaze with the fire of soul like Bronte's heroine must in order to be Heathcliff's female equivalent.  Her dual role as Catherine Linton is off-putting as the quieter daughter is in essence played no differently by Binoche except for a change of haircolor.
All in all the movie is entertaining.  I would have liked to see more romantic interludes between the younger Heathcliff and Cathy to further support their tempestuous connection instead of the silly, unnecessary and wasteful opening scene of Bronte walking her beloved moors in order to introduce the story.
Best of all is the haunting score written by Ryuichi Sakamoto; he really captures Bronte's yearning and thirst for something that could never fully be.",1034726400,9,2675,5.362768496420048
902785,2,6304595247,"Forget this version of Bronte's tale of obsessive love. Even the Olivier version is soft. Check out the hard to find version starring young Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff, possibly 1964 (?). The cinematography is a major player in the drama, as is the haunting soundtrack. I don't understand why the version I praise is not available, for it has truly the best of all elements and it successfully and comfortably balances the demands of the novel's complex plot and the cinematic arts at their most vivid and austere!",1029024000,2,515,4.863636363636363
902826,4,6304595247,"Sure, there's a lot wrong with Peter Kosminky's 1992 take on the Emily Bronte classic. For starters, Binoche and Fiennes are both too old for their teenage parts in the first half of the film, and then Fiennes and Janet McTeer(as longtime and long suffering Earnshaw servant Nelly Dean) don't age nearly enough in the second. Even more of a problem is the stunt casting of Binoche - her occasional slight French accent is a trifle inexelicable here, as others have noted - as both Cathy and her honey blonde daughter, Catherine Linton, neither of whom ever left Yorkshire. The script makes some wacky changes, also - instead of Cathy and Heathcliff spying on a lavish ball at the Linton's, they watch Edgar and Isabella play a game of indoor badminton. (O-kaaaaaay....Linton, badminton...well, it sort of rhymes...)

Instead of focusing on the minuses, I prefer to admire this adaptation's stong points. Unlike the mushy tho' oddly revered 1939 version (and the 1970 one with Timothy Dalton), it tells the entire story, which despite everyone's fond memories, isn't a romance so much as it is a revenge tale and one of the first complex psychological portaits of an abused boy becoming a brutal, abusive man. To that end, Ralph Fiennes is a note-perfect Heathcliff; the scene of his humilitation of Isabella is right on the money. (One feels that he'd eat Olivier's wimp of a Heathcliff for tea, after making him clean the stables three times over.) Despite her miscasting, Binoche makes a lovely, haunting Cathy in the first half and a sympathetic pawn in Heathcliff's twisted plan in the second. Add to that fine support from McTeer, Simon Shepherd (Edgar Linton), Sophie Ward (Isabella) and a young Jeremy Northam (Hindley); heck, even Sinead O'Connor, with her eyes as wide as saucers, catches the right Bronte groove as narrator Emily herself. (What would O'Connor have been like as Cathy, one wonders...) Again, unlike the 1939 flick, Kosminsky sets the story in its proper time period (1770s - very early 1800s), with superb costumes and production values. Authentic Yorkshire moors and other locations add to the tragedy's flavour. The frosting on the cake, though, is Ryuichi Sakamoto's shattering score, which conveys the story's haunting wildness in one swelling phrase almost better than the entire film does itself. (Pity that - like the movie - it was never released in the U.S.; there's a suite arrangement on Sakamoto's CINEMAGE album that merely leaves you wanting the whole score, available only as a rare and pricey import from Japan.) Perhaps a DVD edition, if ever produced, will contain the score, as well as scenes chopped from the truncated print run on Bravo. Until a better version comes along (the 1998 MASTERPIECE THEATRE one with Orla Brady and Robert Cavanah had a few great gothic bits - Heathcliff digging up and sobbingly embracing Cathy's bones really hit the core of the tale), the Fiennes and Binoche take will remain my favourite visit to WUTHERING HEIGHTS. It's a bumpy ride all right, but well worth the trip.",1027987200,3,3048,4.964774951076321

Physically, he wasn't quite as he should have been, however, he is excellent as the dark, brooding hero that you love and hate at the same time. Binoche, however, I thought left something lacking. While she does a fair job in her portrayal of Cathy, I always pictured her as a little more cruel than Binoche seems able to portray. In the novel, she revels in her power over Heathcliff and even seems to enjoy seeing his desperate pain for her. She doesn't quite achieve it in the movie. Sinead O'Conner was actually a pleasant surprise as well--- She has the perfect voice to be the author and doesn't actually have to do much acting, so she adds alot to the presentation.

902830,2,6304595247,"I have never seen a period piece that I did not like. I now have. This film was surprisingly bad. In fact, on top of being disappointed, I was shocked by how bad it was. It is hard to believe that such a great, gothic story of star cross lovers, Cathy and Heathcliff, and their doomed families, the Earnshaws and the Lintons, has come to this, a travesty of a film. It conveys all of the abject misery contained in the novel, but none of its saving graces.
While this is a film that attempts to tell the entire story, chapter and verse, unlike its 1939 predecessor with Laurence Olivier, it still fails. The main problem is the miscasting of Juliette Binoche. While Ms. Binoche is, undoubtedly, lovely looking and a fine actress, her portrayal of an English girl, Cathy Earnshaw, falls flat. She is unable to fashion a credible English accent. Her underlying French accent is very distracting. Moreover, cast in the dual role of her daughter, Catherine Linton, with the same jarring accent is maddening. One never forgets that she is Juliette Binoche. She also, unfortunately, plays both roles in the same fashion. There is no attempt at any characterization or differentiation between the two other than a blowsy, blonde wig. Like mother, like daughter, I suppose. The roles were a definite overreach for Ms. Binoche.
Ralph Fiennes, on the other hand, is well suited to the role of Heathcliff, whom he plays with the intensity demanded of the character. Yet, he, an accomplished actor and worthy of the part, falls short of the mark. While there were glimmers of humanity and a certain poignancy to some of his babarous actions, it was not consistent enough to make the character come across as anything more than a cruelly depraved, miserable slob, rather than an anguished and passionate human being. In fact, his performance fails to make the viewer think anything but ""good riddance"" at the end. This, however, is the failure of the director, Peter Kosminsky. What was he thinking?
It was, however, enjoyable to see Jeremy Northam in the small  role of Hindsley Earnshaw. Now, he would make an intriguing Heathcliff. If one has seen Northam in ""Voices From A Locked Room"", one would know what I mean. He has definitely got what it takes.

902831,4,6304595247,"The best thing about this adaptation was Ralph Fiennes' Heathcliff. He was frightening, abusive, unsympathetic one moment, yet the next could evoke my grudging sympathy.
Juliette Binoche was an acceptable Cathy, although the fact that she's just ""acceptable"" isn't her fault, since the director excised some of Cathy's best scenes. I don't know if he was trying to make the female characters more ""conventionally"" feminine, or just throw the movie to Fiennes, but most of the scenes where Cathy shows her fire and will, and especially her anger, are gone. In their place she is given a rather annoying giggle.
We miss her fits of temper when she invites Isabella and Edgar to Wuthering Heights, important because they show her true nature underneath the ladylike veneer.
We do see the crucial scene where she asks Ellen whether she should marry Edgar, and describes how she loves (or rather doesn't love) him. However, Cathy's description of her dream, where she is thrown from heaven back to Wuthering Heights, is missing.
Also missing is Cathy's magnificent temper tantrum following the argument between Edgar and Heathcliff, and her dramatic hallucinations following it, one of the most powerful points of the book. Instead, Cathy's wildness is inverted into depression.
I felt sorry for Juliette Binoche, deprived of the challenge of these scenes. Leaving them out all but eviscerates the character of Cathy, and thus a significant part of the story.  In fact, I sometimes caught myself wondering just why Heathcliff felt so bonded to her.
Still, there were many good things. In other respects the movie is true to the book, certainly more so than the 1939 version. It uses Bronte's own words as much as possible, which is refreshing, considering how often with classics directors invent their own dialogue, ignoring language that has stood the test of time.
There is a definite energy between Catherine and Heathcliff. I particularly liked their early scenes on the moors. They do come across as a pair of kindred spirits.
The movie also gives a good feel for life back then, in scenes of the servants at work, or the graphic childbirth scenes. I particulary liked McTeer's Ellen, and that the relationship between Ellen and the two Cathies is less Mistress to Servant and more woman to woman.
Binoche gives a gifted performance as Cathy's daughter. She is believable even in the scenes with Heathcliff, which, considering that we've been seeing them as lovers for an hour before that, is quite an accomplishment.
However, I did think the movie should have given us a little time between the deathbed scenes and Binoche's reappearance as Young Cathy. We've just barely gotten over the unforgettable sight of Heathcliff holding Cathy's body in his arms before he is confronting Binoche as her uncle.
This is where another scene from the book could have come in handy: Isabella's escape from Heathcliff. After we see Isabella beaten down by Heathcliff's brutality, this is a satisfying moment, but the movie leaves it out.
The director adds one idea, to do with Cathy and her daughter, that I liked and won't spoil for the viewer. I also liked the way he wrapped the story back around, showing us the beginning from another angle. The ending scenes are worth the whole movie. I was amazed at how, even though I'd been virtually hating Heathcliff for much of the movie, at the end he won my sympathy.
I was not distracted by Sinead O'Connor, since I didn't recognize her, but only thought she looked and sounded perfect for Emily Bronte. Her narration adds just the right touch of ghostliness to the story.

The scene when Cathy is lying dead and he breaks in to see her was truly heartbreaking and it certainly had me in tears. The soundtrack was very atmospheric and certainly added to the overall success of the film. The only slight criticism was the accents of the characters (yet, again Fiennes was excellenet), but Juliette Binoche's  French accent spoilt it slightly for me, and those words she did pronounce in an English fashion were not spoken in traditional Yorkshire dialect as I would have expected.

Juliette Binoche is so amazing. If you are an insensitive block of metal then I do not recommend Wuthering Heights, but how can you resist simply bursting into tears throughout this entire movie. Maybe I am just appreciating this because it provokes my emotions, but isn't that what film is supposed to do, rape your mind?",970617600,3,476,4.420454545454546

It's very jumpy, one minute your in one scene and then in a completely different one! I thought Ralph Fiennes was quite a good Heathcliff! The only thing I thought wrong with it was that there is no passion, it's just flat and Cathy and Heathcliff don't even really  show any love for each other! On the whole though it is a good adaptation!",969926400,2,514,3.9423076923076925
902896,2,6304595247,"This is the only version of Wuthering Heights that I've seen that tells the story from the point of view of the narrator Emily Bronte, looking  backward.  She is not the character (Heathcliff's servant Nelly Dean) who  told the story in the novel, but the tale is told by someone in the story's  present looking into the past and in that sense, is faithful to the novel.  I do, however think that the lead actors leave a lot to be desired.  As has  been mentioned before, Juliette Binoche, although a wonderful actress, is  far too French to play an English girl successfully. Having her play Cathy  and her daughter may have saved the production company money, but Binoche  as the younger Cathy was just not believable, and the blonde wig is a  jarring note. She also looks too mature facially and physically.  Ralph  Fiennes' charm or acting ability, or whatever, has always been lost on me.  What has always come across in all of his roles I've seen is a quality of  aloofness  or coldness that while fitting in the commandant of Schindler's  list, makes of Fiennes, to me, at least, an unconvincing romantic lead.  His interpretation does not gibe with the Heathcliff of the novel or my  imagination, and indeed makes of Heathcliff an entirely unsympathetic  character.  While Fiennes does portray convincingly the coldness of  Heathcliff's character in his latter years after the death of Cathy, he is  incapable of expressing the warmth or perhaps heat of Heathcliff's jilted  young love for Cathy that would help the viewer to understand the roots of  the hatred he has for all of Cathy's family including her daughter by Edgar  Linton.  His physical appearance is also unfaithful to the novel which  portrayed Heathcliff as ""dark..., black-haired"" and as well  ""taller... and twice as broad across the shoulders"" (as Edgar  Linton).  Fiennes is neither dark, nor physically imposing enough (I can't  even imagine him surviving Hindley's physical abuse, much less thriving on  it) to be an authentic Heathcliff, and his unrelentingly cold and evil  persona in this role keeps this viewer from seeing what attraction he might  have had for any woman, let alone the light-hearted Cathy. Indeed, he is  nothing but gloomy and hateful. Compressing the story into an hour and a  half makes the production seem hurried and a lot gets left out or glossed  over. I, too, like many an impressionable young female reader, once thought  Heathcliff a romantic ideal.  For an interesting take on how the love story  might have turned out if Heathcliff had won Cathy, read Alice Hoffman's  Here on Earth, a sort of retelling of the tale in modern dress. For a more  authentic Heathcliff and Cathy, (although a less faithful retelling), see  the 1972 remake with Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff and Anna Calder-Marshall  as Cathy.",969321600,13,2819,4.904255319148936

Ryuichi Sakamoto's music is absolutely spot on. The BITTERsweet (more  bitter than sweet) melody, the heart-tearing violin lines, and the  hopelessly despairing mood it conjures, all work painfully well with the  story. For those who are not so familiar with Sakamoto's music, he's the  composer of film music for Bertolucci's Last Emperor and The Little Buddha  (whereby he rearranged the famous Barber Adagio with a subtle yet perfectly  appropriate change of mood).

The mideval setting and countryside sets is captivating and the  music is intriguing.  It's like musical bliss to my hears when I hear it  and at the same time it's deep and heartfelt.

902899,4,6304595247,"Wuthering Heights is an intense melodramatic tale which illustrates the tragic consequences of following greed instead of your heart.  The serene beauty of the misty coutryside, delicate sunlit ponds and peaceful sounds in nature contrast sharply with the inner turmoil of the characters.

This is a story where no one has learned from the past and history repeats itself in an eerie fashion.  The architecture is fascinating, the scenes detailed, the acting delicious and the emotions seething.  Bitterness and undying love intermingle with immaturity and self-centeredness to create unbearable torture.  An emotional score brings brief glimmers of hope with uplifting notes
which quickly vanish into the mist.

The truth of their mutual devotion, which burns brightly in the hearts of the orphan Heathcliff and wealthy Catherine, is suppressed by their inability to consummate their passion for each other because of their very different stations in life.  This passion burns slowly into them, consuming them until it bursts from their hearts in torrid flames of anger.  Catherine and Heathcliff both choose their fates, although they blame each other.
Heathcliff says it well: ""You of your own will did it."" The intensity of his green eyes reveals his cruel intentions and the display of physical abuse is a bit overplayed in some scenes.  His eyes do soften ever so slightly when they gaze upon Catherine, yet his actions leave you feeling that he does not deserve her.  Catherine does in a way repay the physical abuse with emotional abuse and acts in a very self-centered fashion at times.

Juliette Binoche and Ralph
Fiennes were perfect for the role of Catherine and Heathcliff.  While many would agree: Juliette playing both the part of Catherine and her daughter was slightly distracting.  Healthcliff also never seems to age which keeps him as sexy as ever in the viewers minds, and perhaps
this was the point.  His acting is superb!

The lesson for me is to love deeply and listen to your heart when it is essential to your own happiness.  A series of poor logical choices could not make up for one well thought-out moral choice from the heart.  When Catherine says, ""He'll wait a while yet,"" we somehow hope Healthcliff will put aside his bitterness and learn to love again, while she will find it in her heart to quit making him wait.

When you watch this movie, a cozy down comforter, a fire and a cup of hot tea are essential.  May I suggest candlelight to set a cold dark castle mood.  Watch this alone or maybe with a cat curled up on your lap.  You will not want to be distracted. The script is superb and memorable.  This movie keeps your full attention.

902900,4,6304595247,"Every once in a while, I encounter an actor who, although playing a familiar character, seems to re-invent it and show details of it that have never before been displayed.  Such is Ralph Fiennes portrayal of Heathcliff  in this film.  I was not at all surprised that Spielberg chose him for  ""Schindler's List"" after watching this film--Fiennes' Heathcliff  is almost wholly unsympathetic (he is a wife---and child-- abuser) but  Fiennes lets us know the inner heartbreak that drives Heathcliff to such  meanness.  Previous Heathcliffs have been more stock romantic leads--the  original Moody Guys a' la' James Dean.
I can't really understand the  extreme negativity of the ""official"" reviews--it appears that the  movie, as is the novel, its characters, the author, and her entire family  is a little off-center and out of the mainstream.  The Brontes were a bunch  of weird and wild kids in a weird and wild part of the world, and  ""Wuthering Heights"" is a weird and wild book--not a proper  Victorian romance, as other reviewers have suggested.  Comparing Emily  Bronte to Jane Austen is like comparing William Faulkner to John Grisham  because they are both from Mississippi. None of Austen's characters could  survive in Bronte's Yorkshire, and the Brontes would probably be unwelcome  in Austen's stately Hampshire homes.
I,too, liked this book as a  teenager, and now have the opportunity to teach it to high schoolers,and I  must say my students generally  prefer this novel and this film treatment  to most others in British Literature.  The film does have its flaws--but  not enough to make it unwatchable, and having spent a wild, rainy weekend  in the Bronte's hometown of Haworth, Yorkshire, I do believe the film aptly  captures the mood of that forbidding place.
As for the choice of Sinead  O'Connor to play Emily ""framing"" the ""frame story""--  all I can guess is that she does bear a passing resemblance to the portrait  of Charlotte Bronte that hangs over my computer (great, big, intense eyes).  Plus the Brontes were ethnically Irish.
Watch this film to help your  English lit grade, to observe a truly artful nuanced acting performance, to  enjoy some beautiful scenery, or just enjoy a weepy gothic romance.  Any  way you look at it, it can't possibly be a waste of time.",961372800,97,2293,4.986737400530504
902901,5,6304595247,"Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fienne's preformances are, to say the least, perhaps the most brilliant bit of acting I've yet seen. I had cried at, perhaps, let's say a total of three movies before watching this one night  on BRAVO - and never at a man's preformance. Ralph Fiennes produces a  gut-wrenching preformance as Heathcliff - hard, cruel, and yet a bit more  human than the author protrayed him in the book. Juliet Binoche adds light  to all her dark, dank scenes - and the film is mostly dark and dank - and  gives the added beauty to the cast. The casting of beautiful - startingly -  Sinead O'Conner as the author was plain genious, as the forlorn and yet  dazzling look of Bronte mirrors perfectly that of a perfectly costumed  O'Conner.
This would still be my favorite movie if it had ended badly -  with Heathcliff dying, kaput, THE END. Sadly, many tradegy/dramas like this  end up ending miserably and leaving the viewer with the feeling of  ""What a perfectly good waste of film"". No one wants to watch a  beautifully shot and acted film based on a heart-wrenching novel like that.  No matter HOW beautiful. Thankfully, you don't have to. You're left with a  sense of ""Wow"" instead of ""Well, now I'm off to buy more  Kleenex"". First rule of a critique: never gush. Well, to heck with it  all - this is the best darned movie you're ever going to watch, in this  lifetime or the next. Take my word for it.",960854400,9,1415,4.486274509803922
902902,3,6304595247,"Wuthering Heights was one of my favorite books -- when I was a mopey teenager. I loved Heathcliff, beaten like a dog, emotionally crippled, and dirt poor yet overcoming his enemies in the end. I was like the protagonist  in Jane Austen's ""Northanger Abbey"" a young women with a fertile  (overactive) imagination caught up in romantic and gothic tales.  What the  writer didn't put in the book I made up in my head. My movie idols were  James Mason and Lawrence Olivier -- broody and dark.
The film appears  to incorporate every chapter in Ms. Bronte's book, but her book is overly  long and overwrought. In the 19th century, the book appealed to middle  class women who could read, had servents to do much of their work, knew  little of the world outside their own homes, and wanted a cheap gothic  thrill, no matter how badly written, to lift their everyday constrained and  boring lives. Many of these stories were serialized in women's magazines so  there was a lot of redundancy for those who missed previous installments.
The older ""Wuthering Heights"" film with Olivier although an  extraction from the book is an integrated whole that sustains your  attention and omits no salient point. The newer film includes  most of the  text and is therefore unweildy. The world of the old film is true to the  gothic ideal (teasingly mysterious yet portentous of evil things to come).  The new film is ""in your face"" realism.  Brooding, melancholy  Heathcliff becomes an unlikeable abuser of women. ""It was a dark and  stormy night..."" becomes ""I knew I should have never taken that  ride on the moor and gotten lost because now I have to spend the night with  my clearly insane landlord...""  When the newer film attmpts a gothic  touch it becomes silly. The story is much better when Heathcliff, in  payment for his sins, throws himself screaming, mad and in agony, on  Kathy's grave, than when he is found lying on his back on a day bed  following what can only be described as a commercial for rose-scented  fabric softener.
I've seen most of Ralph Fiennes films, and his acting  has definitely improved. He was over the top in this film. Ms Binoche was  very good in some scenes, but she should not have been cast as both Kathy  and her daughter. It proved distracting. It's worth the price of the film  to see Janet MeTeer and compare her performance to the protagonist in the  new film ""Tumbleweeds.""
Although some would place Ms Bronte in  the same category as Jane Austen because they are both women, she did not  write nearly as well. Jane Austen is the best ""English"" writer  who has ever lived--bar none. Ms. Bronte's writing is closer to that of  Charles Dickens or her Gothic peer Edgar Allen Poe.",960249600,,2706,4.678723404255319

902904,5,6304595247,"At school for our final year we had to do Wuthering Heights.  Most of the class seemed to hate the style of language and had no interest in getting through the book.  At the time my personal life was exactly like Cathy  & Heathcliff's, so the book of course appealled to me so much that I  read it four times!  I LOVED IT!  The romanticism in it is wild and free.  It is a book which shaped my idea of love.  And when I finally came across  the third and final movie of Wuthering Heights with two of my absolute  favourite actors...Ralph Fiennes (whom I think is so tender and beautiful)  and Juliette Binoche (who is so sultry and beautiful with so much depth), I  watched it at least five times.  The reason I loved it was the fact that  the director had obviously captured the mood so well that I felt as if I  was in the book again.  The part that really stands out for me is when they  are standing at Pennistone Crag and Heathcliff is explaining his love for  Cathy referring to the skies.  On the one side the sky was beautiful and  bright and Cathy was so happy because that would be their future, but when  Heathcliff's face changes as he sees the sky on the other side, it is grey  and stormy and they both realise that their fate is sealed.  Cathy becomes  a little ""Miss Priss"" and is wooed by money and splendour as she  cannot pull Heathcliff out of his rut which Hindley had put him into.  Another part that sticks out is when he is sitting in the kitchen with a  calendar and telling Cathy how many times she has spent with Linton and not  with him.  I felt so sorry for him..he was trying to tell Cathy that he  misses her and needs her.  She is too ""shallow"" on the surface of  things and just treats it as nothing.  Although I believe that in her heart  she is fighting the fact that she adores Heathcliff, but cannot have him  because of his position.  The absolute best part would have to be when she  is in the kitchen speaking to Ellen about her love for Heathcliff vs her  love for Linton.  The most eloquent words about Linton being the foliage in  the woods while Heathcliff is the rocks thereunder.  ""I am  Heathcliff"" is the epitomy of how I felt about the book, the movie and  the whole spirit of the story!  I became so involved in their lives that I  felt one with them.

Cathy and Heathcliff love each other, but cannot marry due to family disapproval. The social rules were more strict then, but thing haven't changed that much in 200 years.
