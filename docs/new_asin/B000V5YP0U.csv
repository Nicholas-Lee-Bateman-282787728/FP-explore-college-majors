2930805,5,B000V5YP0U,"All of Loretta LaRoche's books and DVD's are excellent.

2930808,5,B000V5YP0U,"I'm not very high on self-help or motivational videos of any kind, so I wasn't overly excited about having to watch a video about stress during a recent workshop meant to reenergize me for the coming months.  I have to say that I did heartily enjoy this video, though.  Actually, when I first saw a video by L. LaRoche on the agenda, I was trying to figure out why in the world Lyndon LaRouche was making a video about stress.  Of course, this is actually Loretta LaRoche, and she turned out to be one of the funniest speakers I have ever heard.  She does present some useful ideas for handling stress, from common sense notions to such interesting ideas as giving yourself a big ""ta da"" every so often and twirling while delivering bad news.  These more audacious suggestions are not things one would really want to do in real life, particularly Negative Neds such as myself, but the general idea of her message is what matters.  LaRoche does encourage positive thinking and suggests way in which you can get more joy and less stress out of both work and life in general.  Even if you get absolutely nothing from this video in terms of lowering your stress level, it's still worth watching for the laughs LaRoche provides; she is hilarious, much funnier than most comedians.",1039651200,,1275,4.615044247787611
2930809,5,B000V5YP0U,"This video had me laughing out loud for an hour, and now I find myself using some of her techniques (like standing on one leg while delivering bad news to my boss).  Having ordered several of her videos for our company  library, I felt that I should preview them.  We had to order another copy  of this video for our library as the waitlist for it is never empty.  I  recommend this video for anyone experiencing stress at work, home, school,  in traffic, which would be ... well, just everyone, wouldn't it?",945388800,,508,4.456521739130435
