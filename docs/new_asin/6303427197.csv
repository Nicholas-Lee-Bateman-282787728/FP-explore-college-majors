7846182,4,6303427197,"Adapted from the Zane Grey novel and directed by Charles Barton (he later worked extensively with Abbott & Costello), ROCKY MOUNTAIN MYSTERY (aka ""The Fighting Westerner"") is a low-budget PARAMOUNT programmer that effectively combines the western and who-dun-it genres and offers a few casting surprises, namely Ann Sheriden and Randolph Scott at the beginning of their careers. Also appearing is 19th Century stage actress Mrs. Leslie Carter as the family matriarch.

THE STORY--
A mining engineer (Scott) investigating the mysterious disappearance of his brother-in-law joins forces with a crusty deputy sheriff (Sale) who is himself looking into the murder of a mine owner. When two more people die, all the suspects have alibis.

A word about off-brand tapes:
These are usually recorded at slower tape speeds, without a HiFi audio track,
resulting in somewhat degraded picture and lower fidelity sound.

For devotees of the turn of the century American theater, it has a  performance with sound by the legendary and scandalous Mrs. Leslie  Carter,later made immortal on film in ""the Lady with Red Hair"",  starring Miriam Hopkins. Mrs Carter tried to out Bernhardt Bernhardt, and  this film, made the year before her death, reveals her to have kept her  dramatic and  seductive qualities even at the very sunset of her life.  Randolph Scott(of the iron jaw) and a very young Ann Sheridan can also be  admired in this very early film from the start of their careers. But it is  worth the purchase price just to see Mrs. Carter. The legends about her are  fully confirmed here.",966038400,3,751,4.66412213740458
