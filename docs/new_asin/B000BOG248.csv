The DVD consists of three parts:

1. Wall of Hits (songs: Coz I Luv You, Mama Weer All Crazee Now, Gudbuy T'Jane, Cum On Feel The Noize, My Friend Stan, Merry Xmas Everybody, Far Far Away, Thanks For The Memory, Let's Call It Quits, Nobody's Fool, My Baby Left Me, Give Us A Goal, My Oh My, Run Run Away, Radio Wall Of Sound)

2. Set Of Six (songs: Hear Me Calling, Look Wot You Dun, Darling Be Home Soon, Coz I Luv You, Get Down and Get With It, Born To Be Wild)

3. More Hits (songs: Them Kind of Monkeys Can't Swing, Take Me Bak 'Ome, Everyday, How Does It Feel, In For A Penny, Bangin' Man)

You cannot play the entire DVD with a push of a button. It only plays one part at a time. Each part has to be explicitly selected from the menu.

The other problem, quite annoying, is that many of the songs (from Wall of Hits) have the last few seconds clipped off.",1163721600,33,976,4.057291666666667
2432032,3,B000BOG248,"...I was hoping for something with more of the old-school highlights.  The video has some clips from way back (60's and 70's), but more than half of the clips come from the 90's - disappointing.  Also, note that the subtitle of this video (which distinguishes it from the other two available on Amazon.com) is 'Wild and Outrageous'.  I had overlooked that.  All of the clips in this video have sex-related questions (are the other two videos the same?).  I found most of this video pretty funny, but I was looking for some scenes from more general topics, too.  And beware of the lousy ending!",988070400,10,593,4.653846153846154

8090112,4,B000BOG248,"As another reviewer notes, some of the video on this disk is shot very poorly.  In fact, on Gudby to Jane (my favorite song!) the beginning and end are chopped off.  But the fact that it's a DVD of Slade makes up for it.  Similar to T. Rex, Slade was huge in the UK and had trouble taking hold here in the USA.  I saw them twice as the mid-bill at Winterland in San Francisco.  I even have the pack of confetti they passed out somewhere around the house!  They were a high-energy Glam Band and great showmen.  However, typical for the day, not alot of video was taken of them.  T-. Rex was lucky, he had Ringo Starr film Born to Boogie (in 35mm!)  Slade, evidently, had nobody filming them.  So most of the video on this disk are from shows in the UK (similar to the Midnight Special here in the USA) or staged video at a venue.  Some look like Super 8mm footage.  But it's video of Slade in their heyday, so it's okay!

If you are looking for an HD quality DVD, this is not for you.  But if you are a Slade fan, or just want to see one of the coolest bands ever, then it's worth the price.",1353801600,6,1090,4.0327102803738315
8090113,5,B000BOG248,"This band of rockin funsters do not get the credit they deserve, considering their achievements in the charts and live. This DVD helps redress the balance. Their is some live footage in front of a tiny studio crowd that helps us see a little of what it was like to be at a gig. I don't know of any released footage of their second wave of popularity when they had some really lively gigs. There are also clips from shows like Top of the Pops. These clips are also entertaining. Good stuff for anyone who likes good raucous old fashioned rock. If you like AC/dc you'll like SLADE although SLADE can do a great ballad as well. Noddy Holder was one of rocks greatest singers and he had charisma to burn as well. Recommended.",1337126400,5,721,4.388059701492537
