200791,5,1596982012,Excellent job! It's a fresh look at President Reagan's political life and his achievements through out his life. I think it mainly focused on his economic achievements in the first term and then on his fight against the Communism in Europe and else where. The information the viewer get through watching this valuable dvd is awesome. It's really moving and certainly informative. President Reagan is a larger than life figure for the Conservatives in the US and he is sorely missed. He's so much needed these days when the direction of the US and the world in general is not really known. His leadership and communication skills are dearly missed. His charisma is captured in this rather long movie/documentary. Now I know a lot about President Reagan than I did before. Excellent work by Speaker Gingrich and his wife. A must see for all those conservatives that look for a guide or leader in their quest for knowledge and political enlightenment. A must see!,1240617600,19,960,4.859756097560975
200792,5,1596982012,"Saw this at the Gingrich's Atlanta premier.  Didn't cost me a centime.  Excellent documentary on Reagan, made me relive and remember all those events in the 80's.  The tears came for me, (I hate crying in public), hearing President Reagan speak at Pointe du Hoc in Normandy where the allies landed on June 6, 1944.  That's when I couldn't stifle the sniffles and began to notice that I wasn't alone.  Loved the part where one of the persons interviewed for this commented on President Reagan's speech at the Berlin wall.  He talked about the power of words, President Reagan's words when he said, ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.""  And I'm telling you, I was really sniffling then.  It was a modern day equivalent of Joshua's ""Sun stand thou still"" speech at Gibeon.  And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed.  And the iron curtain came down.  I also was moved by Natan Sharansky commenting on the impact of President Reagan's evil empire speech about the Soviet Union.  When he and his fellow prison compatriots in Russia heard of this speech, they began spreading the news by morse code taps on the walls, speaking through toilets, etc.  He said that President Reagan gave them encouragement.  And, I think, in a HUGE way, fostered much respect and admiration for the many other Americans like him who live the ""land of the free and the brave"" life as proof.  Will have to read some Reagan books to try to get a handle on the Republican party platform, how it's evolved over the decades, how President Reagan fit or didn't fit their bill.  I did learn that President Reagan, like me, started out as a democrat and that his ""voodoo economics"" was not approved by all initially within GOP ranks.  Was a wonderful night in Atlanta at the History Center.  Good company, great, educational entertainment.",1238457600,50,1809,4.725239616613418

200802,5,1596982012,"Yes, he was a huge movie star, with all the glamor that went along with it. But, he was also a brilliant, humble, modest man...the ""Real Thing"" in this political world of less than honest public servants. This DVD gives enjoyable glimpses into the way he lived, his wonderful sense of humor, and his Love for the United States of America. A must for every DVD Library!",1392854400,,368,4.507462686567164

200805,5,1596982012,This video really delves into the life and times of R.R. I learned so much about him that I did not remember from the past.  This should be required viewing for all American History/ Political Science classes. Richard Stockmal,1362960000,,226,4.794871794871795

200808,1,1596982012,"This is more of a drooling fanboy version of an important figure in American history than anything else. If you can get your hands on the HBO/BBC Storyline ""Reagan"" program which is much more even handed. Either that or read the books by his daughter Patti or his adopted son Michael.",1333238400,2,284,4.588235294117647
200809,5,1596982012,"This is a fantastic DVD about Pres. Reagan's presidency. Very nice comentaries and also actual footage of some of the most relevant moments in Reagan's presidency. Those who did not know much about him should see this DVD. I also wish I'd be in the US now to deliver some copies to those lunes in the ""Wall street movement"" (communists/socialists). People need to know how great Reagan was and we cannot forget his legacy not to let everything (marxism) start all over again. Wake up America.",1318809600,4,492,4.732558139534884

All of the interviews that are inserted as the story unfolds add a touch of insider knowledge that helps the rest of us learn what was taking place during the most important parts of Reagan's political journey, as candidate, Governor, and then President.  Job well done!",1299456000,3,333,5.036363636363636
200811,5,1596982012,"For those of us who saw Ronald Reagan as the leader we wanted and desperately needed, this movie was a joy. For those with a nostalgic longing for the days  when Americans knew right from wrong and were not afraid to say so, you may find yourself a little misty eyed. I will watch it again and again with my children so that they will understand that once we were strong and determined to do what is right.",1268524800,9,406,4.205128205128205

200813,5,1596982012,"I didn't appreciate the greatness of Ronald Reagan when he ran for and served as President; in fact, I barely paid attention in my youth to politics.  As I became older I realize that conservative values had been instilled and that I deeply held dear those values.  This video, Rendezvous with Destiny, touch my soul and solidified my belief that conservatism IS at the core of American values.  Get this DVD, watch it many times, share it with friends and pray that it is not too late to recovery from what the Statists have done thus far and turn back the great wave of progressive though.",1254873600,3,591,4.556603773584905
200814,5,1596982012,"I came of age in the Reagan days, and I found this film to be a wonderful mix of inspiration and nostalgia, reminding me of just how special a President Ronald Reagan was - and in a way, how different a country the USA has become.

I've always been fairly active politically, so many of the events recounted in the film were familiar to me, but of course, it's interesting to look back through more experienced eyes. People too young to remember the Reagan years may find the film more of an eye-opener...especially those who may have been products of more liberal public education systems, where it's common to portray Mr. Reagan in a darker way. Here's a strong, principled, yet humble man having a clear and traditional sense of values, serving his country to the best of his abilities.

Only complaint is that I would have appreciated more of Reagan's older speeches, especially around the time of the Goldwater candidacy. These seemed like Reagan's formative years as a Conservative, and I believe there are many pearls in his words from that time. Would have liked to hear more of them and how true they ring even today.",1251072000,4,1126,4.681818181818182
200815,5,1596982012,Delivery was very fast on this order and the DVD itself is great...enjoyable to view and historically interesting.,1249171200,,114,5.388888888888889
200816,5,1596982012,"I bought this production for my husband.  We both watched it the very night it came in.  It is a wonderful production by Mr. Gingrich and his wife that honors and portrays former President Reagan with admiration and respect due to a man of his standing in our nation's history.
Reagan's story is told in full, from his days prior to being president through his retirement and his family's discovery that he suffered from Alzheimers.
I highly recommend this production as one that  you can watch many times to remember Reagan and to learn more about what made him the man he was.",1247529600,4,578,4.592233009708738
200817,5,1596982012,Ronald Reagan was a true leader in every sense of the word.  We surely could use another one like him now for the conservative movement but I don't think their will ever be another leader quite like him.  He's probably turning over in his grave with what's going on in Washington right now and the assault on your freedoms and our capitalistic system as we know it.,1247443200,,365,4.432835820895522
200818,5,1596982012,"Very well done biography of Reagan's presidential years.  Includes both personal and professional views into this powerful, yet personable man. Really brings to mind just how much we could benefit from his expertise in today's world.",1247184000,2,233,5.472222222222222
200819,5,1596982012,"What a fabulous documentary about this extraordinary man who, fortunately for the USA, was our great President!  I highly recommend this for absolutely everyone who values freedom and the peace we now enjoy thanks to the end of the Cold War threat.",1247011200,2,248,4.904761904761905
200820,5,1596982012,"Without question, this was a great documentary, well done and for once, the right folks were interviewed.  Too often these documentaries interview ""objective"" journalists like Dan Rather, Peter Jennings or heaven forbid, Helen Thomas.  It was great to see Fred Barnes, Bill Bennett, Vaclav Havel and John O'Sullivan, to just name a few.

There was video I had never seen before, including the teary eyed letter he read in France.  I thought the focus on the foreign policy and the showdown with Gorbachev was very well done.  One interesting that makes a good documentary a unique documentary, was the video of something taking place at one end of the table, and then the still photos that were taken from the other side.  This was done in one great segment where President Reagan and Gorbachev sat across the table from each other and then stodd up to shake hands.

No matter your level of fandom for Ronald Reagan, you'll learn and enjoy this DVD.  The 90 minutes will fly by and you'll be looking for more.",1246752000,5,1009,4.725714285714286
200821,3,1596982012,I was looking forward to this dvd and finally bought only to find out there are no subtitles and I am hearing impaired.,1246060800,4,119,4.217391304347826
200822,5,1596982012,"This is a great way to learn about or fondly remember the Reagan years.  Reagan personifies what all politicians should strive for--not just to be a politician, but a citizen politician.  This DVD walks one through the Reagan political lifespan.  Starting as Governor of the most liberal state, California, to his presidency.  Newt Gingrich and his wife walk the viewer through Reagan's rise to the presidency.  It is 90 minutes, but I could have watched it for 3 hours.  We need more ""Reagan types"" in the political system.",1245110400,14,524,4.8977272727272725

He wasn't a LAWYER, he wasn't IVY LEAGUE and he wasn't a POLITICIAN...This is why I loved it.  He was the embodiment of what the FOUNDING FATHERS had in mind.  A Citizen Leader who wasn't interested in becoming a KING OR DICTATOR or having the job for LIFE (Alexander Hamilton).  He was one of We the People from Middle America and didn't belong to any ELITE GROUP.  He felt the call and answered it.  Newt and Callista Gingrich do a fantastic job as hosts.
