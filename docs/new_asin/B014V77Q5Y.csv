8731899,5,B014V77Q5Y,"Has there ever been a better TV series than Homeland? It is far and away the best drama on TV and it keeps on being great.  I thought that when the Damian Lewis character was killed off, the series would lose its intensity, but Season 4 is as gripping its predecessors. Claire Dames is magnificient, and the writing  is first-rate.  I can't wait to see Season 5!",1462665600,3,362,4.373134328358209
