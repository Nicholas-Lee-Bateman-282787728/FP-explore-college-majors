However, the dynamics between father and son as they try to recover what they lost out on during a lifetime is priceless.  They each learned a lot about the other one.  Not a home run exciting documentary, but it isn't supposed to be.",1425772800,,317,4.322033898305085
8488666,4,B005XL2WCU,"Interesting documentary. I only wish they showed the filmmaker (the son) vs. him just being behind the camera.
I would recommend it if you're a hippie at heart!",1425340800,,160,4.75

8488668,5,B005XL2WCU,"Wonderful film! It's about understanding each persons decision to live the way they want without judgment . A son learning about himself and his choices and understanding his fathers choices as well.
Very heartwarming with a lot of truth and honesty thrown into the mix. It is a movie that all should see and scrutinize our own preconception of how we think that others should live.
I really recommend this film!",1402790400,,412,4.816901408450704

8488671,4,B005XL2WCU,"I have never met Kaleo but do know Cloud and was one of the room renters that was mentioned in the film. Albeit not mentioned by name. The video showed Rock exactly how he was back when I knew him before the Mt Saint Helens eruption. I wanted to see if the video would accurately portray him. I wasn't disappointed. I enjoyed very much seeing the interaction between Kaleo Labelle and Cloud Rock. The only thing missing in my opinion is more video showing Kaleo while he was talking with his dad. I can only imagine the facial expressions that he had. I would loved to had seen more of them in the film. Enjoy the film.

8488672,5,B005XL2WCU,"I saw this at the Silverdocs festival a few years ago.  Of the 100 films that I've seen there in the past few years, I think that this one is my favorite.  It's a personal story, but the more general issues of parental responsibility and the complications of a ""free lifestyle"" are at the fore.  The film works extremely well because Cloud Rock (the filmmaker's father) is such a compelling character.  He's charismatic - the kind of person that everyone wants to like, and who can carry a movie.  Which draws you in all the more to the gamut of emotions and experiences that are discussed here.  I can't recommend this highly enough; I don't understand why this film isn't more widely seen and known.",1350345600,3,701,4.568
8488673,5,B005XL2WCU,"Powerful, honest film.  Sensitively done.  Beautiful scenery, great music.  And I think it took courage on the part of Kaleo LaBelle to meet the man, who is his father, and ask him the question that lived in his heart as a boy and as a man.  Great film.  Well done.  Worth seeing.",1320451200,3,280,4.288461538461538
