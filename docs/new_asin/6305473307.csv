7890784,5,6305473307,We were surprised that this was still as we had used it years ago on one of our first computers! It has been adapted well for use with the newer computer models and we enjoy the challenge of the game.,1360627200,,200,4.025
7890785,5,6305473307,"I didn't have time to read the book yet, and actually I though I was buying an interactive DVD based on this novel. But that is my problem. It arrived on time, as expected, as new.",1356912000,,180,4.027777777777778
7890786,1,6305473307,"I played the original Silent Steel which was a 4CD game and YOU COULD HEAR THE VOICE OF THE CAPTAIN after you choose an option. In this game I heard other people except the skipper and I am pretty sure it has nothing to do with the soundcard or the computer, the voice is just not there. Maybe the company tried to get away with a cheap copy?????",1196121600,,346,4.102941176470588
7890787,5,6305473307,"As an X-boat sailor, I think Silent Steel is a Classic
although somewhat ""Hollywoody"". It is WELL DONE, excellent acting
,VERY realistic, and just plan FUN.",1070582400,2,156,5.038461538461538
7890788,3,6305473307,"Silent Steel strikes me as a good mix between a movie and a game.  If you are into real gaming, look somewhere else.  This is strictly a movie with several branches.  You make the decisions, then watch what happens...  There are some trouble with the choice screen when you try to fast forward  some scenes (word of advice: don't) and the save and restore feature is an  anoyingly slow process.  Also,even if there is mention of ""Crimson  Tides"" and other good movies, don't expect high quality computer  animation.  The real-live footage are excellent, however, and the acting is  above average.  A good game for the casual person.",950313600,16,632,4.803738317757009
