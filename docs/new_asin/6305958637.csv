7898179,3,6305958637,"okay im going to say one tyhing about this ppv. This is very simply nothing more then a very good raw. if you don't believe me, buy it yourself. Its not a bad tape/dvd. But it has absolutley nothing on the normal ppvs. Insuurrextion/rebellion are pretty much just house shows put on tape/dvd",1198108800,,291,4.509433962264151
7898180,4,6305958637,"Too Cool vs. Perry Saturn and Dean Malenko:

An average tag team match that throughout had the feeling of that a normal match that would appear on Raw. Too cool pick up a cool win with Saturn & Malenko having a fistfight at the end. 5.5/10

Road Dogg vs. Bradshaw

Another match-up that had the feeling running throughout that this is match you would normally see on Raw. No storyline to this slow pace match that made it even worst to watch. 4/10

Kane vs. Bull Buchanan

Yes finally a mildy entertaining match with a so-so storyline to it. Big Bull really took it to Kane with some pretty good manoeuvres although it wasn't enough to keep the big red machine down. Kane pins Bull with a chokeslam. 6/10

Arm Wrestling Match: The Kat vs. Terri

Ugh no comment. Just fast forward this crappy gimmick until The Kat exposes her you know whats. And just for that 6/10

Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle

This was a great match that really awoke the audience. Throughout the match there were tons of hits and bumps. Angle was relentless in blinding Beniot who at the time had an injured eye which led to Beniot losing the match. 8/10

Rikishi and ""Showkishi"" vs. The Dudley Boyz

The Angle & Beniot match really lifted the mood of this ppv and then all sudden the excitement drops because of this dull match. Rikishi & Showkishi won due to E&C outside interference in which they didn't need anyway since they dominated the entire match. 5/10

WWF Hardcore Championship Match:

Crash Holly (c) vs. The British Bulldog

Not much weapons used in this match except for a kendo stick, plastic chair and a couple of garbage cans beside that it were nice the see the Bulldog back and win the hardcore title. 7/10

WWF Tag Team Championship Match:

Edge and Christian (c) vs. The Hardy Boyz

I expected way more from this match than it delivered when it looked good on paper. There were plenty of nice high flying manoeuvres used by both teams throughout the match. The ending of the match pissed me really off though it was fixed with a surprise appearance from the Dudley Boyz driving Edge through a table. 6.5/10

WWF European Championship Match:

Eddie Guerrero (c) vs. Chris Jericho (IC champ)

This was definitely the match of the night where Jericho & Guerrero matched up really well with each other. Throughout the match were near falls, cool manoeuvres and above all else suspense of which one will leave with the title. Eddie finally beat Jericho with a shot with the belt that did not ruin the match at all. 8.5/10

Triple Threat WWF Championship Match:

The Rock (Champion) vs. Triple H vs. Shane McMahon

A flawless main event in my opinion delivering exactly what it was meant ""A chaotic match with action all over the place. The Rock was double teamed in the first half of the match and then he regains the upper hand. Refs were knocked out; biased refs were put in place (Gerald Briscoe) who also got knocked out by HHH. The Rock wins with people's elbow to Shane, low blow to HHH and rock bottom to Vince. A fantastic and flawless main event. 9.5/10

Overall mark 66/100 meanings 66% giving Insurrextion a B mark making it a great ppv in the standards of British ppv. I recommend that any wwe fan who enjoys British ppvs Insurrextion 2000 is a must have for you. Thankyou for reading my review on WWF Insurrextion 2000.",1124496000,7,3318,4.556492411467116

7898182,2,6305958637,"I own about 25 wwf videos and this is probably the worst I've ever seen.  Most of the matches are as boring as the classic saturday morning ""wwf superstars"" from the 80's.  Beniot vs Angle was great but most are one sided and predictable.  The main event has to be the biggst letdown of them all with HHH being in prime form but having the typical match with the rock, shane is also a contender but you wouldn't know it the way he stands around collecting dust.  McManhon offends and gets his typically, if I were you I'd go get some real sports entertainment like king of the ring 98, survivor series best of, fully loaded 2000, and even wcw halloween havoc 98 or 99, but not this hunk of plastic.",981936000,3,698,4.305343511450381

I mean you get a title change, The Kat shows gives us a replay of Armaggedon, We  get another great match between Edge and Christian againest the Hardy Boyz.  Plus we get the first London appereance of the 4 Wcw radicals.  As Benoit  has a awesome match with Kurt Angle.  Other than that you get some strong  appearences from Chris Jericho when he faces Latino Heat. Too Cool goes one  on one with Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn. Triple H, and Shane McMahon get  a title shot in the triple threat main event againest The Rock  If you  hated the other London events this is a must buy.",963964800,4,721,4.345864661654136
