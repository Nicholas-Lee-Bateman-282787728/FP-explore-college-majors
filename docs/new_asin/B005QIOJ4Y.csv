4858618,5,B005QIOJ4Y,"This is my 6th Tae Bo DvD I have purchased so far while on this journey of weight loss.

Ok, First thing I want to say , "" Billy! Too many excercises on DELTOIDS!""

This is definitely an upper body workout. Deltoids and Triceps are hit pretty heavy in this video. I have 2 pound(each hand) weighted gloves (Atlus Brand bought from here on Amazon)and decided not to use them first time into this video. Boy, I'm glad I didn't now! Even without the weights I had to drop my arms a few times to relax. Hand weights are suggested by Billy in this video for a more intense workout.

Ok while this video is good I wouldn't consider it a full body workout at all. If your looking for a Full Body Workout then I would suggest Tae Bo ""This is Tae Bo"". I have used that DvD more than any of the others I have.

This video will work for me currently since I like to jumprope. I'll use my jumprope for my legs and use this video for arms and upper body.",1339891200,,941,4.07027027027027
4858619,5,B005QIOJ4Y,"Unplanned, and at the last minute, I hopped over to my local Walmart. For some odd reason I glanced at the fitness section and there staring back at me was Billy Blanks. Not the real one. LOL. He was on the front cover of what I thought was the new DVD, which actually it was a cardboard box containing the new Taebo Power DVD and a pair of adjustable weighted gloves. I had to laugh and inspected the box as I had just ordered a pair of Everlast weighted gloves from an Ebay seller the night before. I glanced at the price and it was under $17 which wasn't bad considering that one exercise DVD cost at least $9, but this had the gloves.

Since I had skipped my workout that morning because I had take care of a few errands, I waited until late in the evening to pop the DVD into the player. For newcomers to Tae Bo, you'll be disappointed that there is no  instructional workout. Normally, Billy Blanks takes fifteen minutes to explain the new moves. The main workout is longer than the other releases this year, this one rounding about 61 minutes counting the warm up and cool down. If your looking for a great cardio workout, you'll won't find it here. Power focus on mostly the upper body with a few kicks here and there. The weighted gloves does a make a difference, but you can don't have to use them. You can use handheld weights or none at all and you'll still feel the burn. The last fifteen minutes is a killer! There is a bonus workout called Billy's Power Abs! It is the short program around 10 minutes long, and involves sitting in a chair for the routines. I found this to be challenging as I don't have a sturdy metal chair like Billy and the gang does.

Now, let's talk about the weighted gloves. I have never owned a pair before, and I've been searching for a pair since I started Tae Bo earlier in the year. Like I said above, I just ordered a pair the night before, which I, now, thought would be backups. I would say that they're no more than a pound each. The gloves fit perfectly, but they might be too big for someone with smaller hands. After I finished the workout and took off the gloves, I noticed that the black material had rubbed off onto my skin. This happened in my next two workouts and now I haven't had any problems. I received the Everlast gloves today in the mail. I haven't had a chance to test them out yet, so I won't be comparing the Tae Bo glove to them just yet.

Overall, I must say Tae Bo is a fun workout that is meant to tone your upper body, and you will be sore the next day. There is a lot of punching throughout the workout, so be expected to be covered with sweat by the end of the DVD.",1338595200,,2639,4.188976377952756
4858620,5,B005QIOJ4Y,first i though it was easy then after 15 minutes your heart get pumping and starting to get sweat.. i love it---,1333843200,,112,4.136363636363637
4858621,5,B005QIOJ4Y,"OMG!!! This was AWESOME!!! I have only just recently jumped on the Tae Bo bandwagon and I can't believe it has taken me so long!! Billy Blanks is my IDOL!!! Due to his workouts, I continue to keep melting off the pounds! This workout is TOUGH and CHALLENGING but OH SO FUN!!!! This was a really intense workout and done in the usual Mr. Blanks style...great instruction with non-stop words of motivation from our instructor! This is face-paced and you really work up a sweat!!! This DVD is definitely one of his best!!! I can't get enough of it!! :)What I love most about his workouts, and especially this one, is that you really feel a sense of accomplishment when you are done! I wanted to stop so many times through the whole deltoids ""torture"" and triceps ""torture"" but I stuck with it and am really glad I did! Mr. Blanks, I accept your challenge! :)",1330473600,13,855,4.487179487179487
4858622,5,B005QIOJ4Y,Finally billy comes back with a workout I love!! Everything about it rocks! I can't even get through the  bonus power abs it's so tough!,1329177600,5,136,4.44
4858623,5,B005QIOJ4Y,"I love this workout sooooo much. This is realy great. This workout is more a sculpting than a cardio workout. The most time of this an hour workout its upper body training!! But also a great cardio workout too. You realy need weighted gloves for this workout to feel the burn and the power. Weighted gloves are not included!!!
As an extra bonus you get an amazing 16 minutes ab workout. For this workout you realy need a chair! It's my new favorite ab training from Billy Blanks. You realy sweat a lot and you will feel the burn in your abs. It's the best ab workout that Billy eher creat for me.
Love it! Will do this workout and ab training four times a week.
Buy this workout. You will love it!.",1322956800,16,698,4.2556390977443606
4858624,5,B005QIOJ4Y,"Another great Blanks workout....this one is actually a lot of fun...the workout is intense and lasts for about an hour...you work out hard throughout the video but its the last 15 minutes that get you really good!  Fun energy, and mostly an upper body workout since the gloves are weighted as well.  Another good one from Mr. Blanks and the perfect for those of us in the world who workout at home!",1318291200,9,398,4.513888888888889
4858645,3,B005QIOJ4Y,This is a good workout but I still prefer the more basic moves used in his older videos (even from the 90's).,1387584000,,109,4.0
4858646,5,B005QIOJ4Y,"Music tempo is a little low, but generally, a great work out. Same TaeBo Moves, a few knew ones, mostly same cast members. Can't complain, does the job! I recommend!",1384300800,3,165,4.533333333333333
4858647,3,B005QIOJ4Y,"This is a good work out program for those of us who prefer to use our bodies in replacement for expensive workput machinery.
The down side is that using this single tape alone will not get you were you want to go. I have found it useful to use a set of his workouts at least 4 times a week to see real results.",1381449600,,310,3.859375
4858648,3,B005QIOJ4Y,"too much time spent on the upper body, needs more balance.  The legs and abs are important also, need to have a completely tuned body not just big arms and shoulders.",1376265600,2,166,4.354838709677419
4858649,5,B005QIOJ4Y,Love this!  I've been through a bunch of his old dvds and was looking for the next step.  This is it!  He keeps you moving the whole time.  I barely made it through the first time and have gradually gotten better.  Love this!,1369267200,3,225,4.1395348837209305
4858650,5,B005QIOJ4Y,"This is a combination of cardio and intense arm workout.  It is a killer when it comes to arms, primarily at the beginning.  There are knee lifts, but no kicking like other Tae Bo workouts, but you still get the cardio workout like mentioned before.
One drawback I do have though is a sequence in the workout where you do a combination of walking backward, punching, and jumping forward lifting your knees.  It seems it should be a 12-count sequence rather than an 8-count sequence.  They still do an 8-count during this exercise and it can get confusing.  I have to mute the DVD during this part of the workout so I can stay on track.
Despite this drawback, I will still give this 5 stars.  It is a challenging workout.  Right when you feel you are about to stop after a sequence of exercises, Billy immediately moves to another exercise. He doesn't give your already tired arms time to relax.  Just push through and you'll feel great knowing you got through the entire workout.",1368144000,3,979,4.554285714285714
4858651,5,B005QIOJ4Y,I have been following taebo for years and it is the more complete training You could find.  Cardio + muscle training combined,1360800000,,125,4.681818181818182
4858652,3,B005QIOJ4Y,"15 minutes or so. I was also a bit disappointed in the following abs sequence that focused on the hip flexors alot. I did like the upper body work, it was varied and not overly complicated. All in all not my favorite work out but would be alright paired with a day you go for a run or bike ride to include some lower body activity.",1353715200,,331,4.03030303030303
4858653,4,B005QIOJ4Y,"Tae-bo is the best workout video of all time, it is the perfect cardio workout. It is fun, high energy, none stop sweat. I already loss 12 pound in 3 weeks.
Thank you Billy Blanks",1349049600,,179,4.142857142857143
4858654,5,B005QIOJ4Y,"You need to do this workout if you have ""bat wings"" like some of us.  I did this for the first time two days ago and I am really feeling it in the triceps, deltoids and lat/mid back muscles.  This is one not to miss!",1343174400,3,216,3.7777777777777777

8483397,5,B005QIOJ4Y,Good video it will make you sweet. It does work I recommend you to do it twice a week and do other kind of workout the other days.,1409875200,,130,3.6785714285714284
8483398,5,B005QIOJ4Y,This exercise video was intense and fun.  I became a Billy Blanks fan when he started his first Tae Bo Videos....He continues to push  his fans to the limit.  Love it!,1403740800,,167,4.32258064516129
8483399,5,B005QIOJ4Y,I would recommend this product for someone who is looking for simple but effective exercises to loose inches in the difficult areas of the upper arm.,1398384000,,149,4.769230769230769
8483400,5,B005QIOJ4Y,"Love love! I had a baby in September gained over 40 pounds. Started tae Bo power in January, three months, working out 4- 5  days a week and I'm really seeing results. I' m sure that in a month time I'll be back in my jeans.",1397779200,,224,3.869565217391304
8483401,5,B005QIOJ4Y,"Just love, love this shea butter. The price was excellent. At first I was skeptical because the price was super low and the thought of getting 3lbs of raw ivory color shea butter for such a low price was hard to believe until I ordered it. It was shipped in a shipping bag which made my shipping cost lower. I really liked this product and look forward to ordering again soon.",1392940800,,376,4.309859154929577
8483402,4,B005QIOJ4Y,Very difficult arm workout. Does not burn as many calories as his other workouts. I of course cannot complete the entire 80 min video. Great ab workout as well.,1392681600,,160,4.551724137931035
8483403,2,B005QIOJ4Y,"I recently purchased this video based on other reviews and was very disappointed.  I didn't mind that it focused primarily on upper body, BUT after 30 minutes, my arms still didn't burn and my heart rate never went up.  Every time Billy Blanks started doing some cardio, he would stop and go back to the toning exercises.  If I don't break a sweat after 30 minutes of starting a workout, I feel like I am wasting my time.  I never made it to the end of the video.  If you typically workout at an intermediate to advanced level, don't waste your money on this video!  Probably ok for a beginner.",1388793600,,594,4.3545454545454545
