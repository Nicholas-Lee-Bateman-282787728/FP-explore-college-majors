7898666,1,6305914788,"Even though this is Clark Gable's first appearance in a sound movie - `sound' as in `synchronized noise,' not `sound' as in `free from defects and structurally complete' - THE PAINTED DESERT is a pretty wretched early talkie.  The real star of the movie is William Boyd, better known to a couple of generations as Hopalong Cassidy.  The movie begins with a couple of dust busting cowboys discovering an infant in a deserted camp.  The cowboys care for, argue over, and ultimately part as enemies over the foundling.  One carries off the baby to raise as a son, the other sets up a homestead at a desert watering hole.

 The baby grows up to be Bill Holbrook (Boyd), while the waterhole cowboy marries, gets widdered, and has a pretty young daughter name of Mary Ellen (Helen Twelvetrees.)  Papa Holbrook is a well-to-do cattle rancher while Mary Ellen's father is barely scratching out an existence until beau Bill discovers tungsten ore on his land.  The set up being - the two feuding ex-partners will be reunited when the young `uns are united in matrimony, and prosperity, by cattle or tungsten ore, will bring peace to the valley. Enter Clark Gable, here playing a character named Rance Brett, an interloping desert Iago who sees that his best chance with Mary Ellen will only be realized if the old feud can be kept a-boiling.

 This would be an alright western if it had a better plot, or the actors didn't talk so very, very slow, or if the direction/editing didn't keep you wondering things like `How did that injured cowboy get shot?'  In other words, it'd be okay if everything in it were different. Although Gable is a catalyst for most of the action THE PAINTED DESERT is only going to appeal to die-hard fans of his, or Hoppy's.  Also included on the Laserlight discount release is the 28-minute `Clark Gable on Film,' which is nothing more than a compilation of Gable trailers (China Sea, Lone Star, To Please a Lady, Mutiny on the Bounty, etc.) and publicity stills linked by a superficial narration (`Gable spent most of his life unconsciously looking to replace his dead mother....') Disappointing on every level.",1128038400,7,2131,4.760869565217392
