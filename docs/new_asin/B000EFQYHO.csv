2517489,5,B000EFQYHO,"I bought the first edition and the second edition of these series.

Boy oh boy, they are GREAT. While the first DVD is basic and instructional, the 2nd one starts getting more in depth! The steps are harder and more FUN. It took me a few tries, but fortunately, this is a DVD! You can hit rewind and there you go.

Lessons normally cost at least $25/hr, and I have spent countless hours on this DVD. As a result, I have saved nearly $1000 in lessons, and I feel more confident ballroom dancing now.

I am eagerly awaiting the 3rd series, which I purchased, and hope to master. You cannot go wrong with this DVD.

If you want to learn Ballroom dancing, this is ""THE"" DVD to get.

2517490,5,B000EFQYHO,"I bought this DVD and it is great.  After I bought this DVD, I also bought series 3, which is great, too.  I am looking forward to series 4 DVD.  These teaching DVDs are more efficient than the actual dancing class.  It also offer the flexibility (you can learn any time when you have time to practice).  Some people complained about the authors' children appeared in DVD series 3, which should be avoid in the future.",1170720000,6,418,4.447368421052632
2517491,5,B000EFQYHO,"I'm a fair dancer, my partner is new. These tapes are basic+. They are simple to follow, yet advanced enough to look good. They also offer labeled practice music which was extremely nice. Who knows what dance goes to which music ... Now, we do! If you have any experience ... order Series 2 (it reviews Series 1). My advice ... follow these lessons and then takes a couple live lessons to finish the process.

Dance often and well!",1164672000,14,431,4.455696202531645
2517492,5,B000EFQYHO,Wonderful dance dvd. Better than going to a class. My boyfriend and I are really into it. I am excited about the 3rd one that came out. You will not be sorry with this dance dvd! :o),1160438400,5,182,3.945945945945946
2517493,4,B000EFQYHO,I liked the material.  This dvd goes back to the basic steps as a reminder.  So If you have a background just get this one or the next level up.  This has very good teaching methods.,1155945600,12,182,4.0
2517494,5,B000EFQYHO,"Ive been searching all over for a dance video i thought suit me best. This one came out on top by a LANDSLIDE. The steps and figures are discussed perfectly to full understanding the first time around. This video was perfect.

Excellent Buy !!!",1151452800,,244,4.545454545454546
2517495,5,B000EFQYHO,The Kalles instructions are clear for both partners and the setup of the DVD with various dance steps offers a ton of good information.  The lessons guide you and a partner along so that you can really get out on the floor in a short time. I found this DVD easy to follow and have gained confidence to dance with anyone.,1146009600,10,320,4.245901639344262

8108964,2,B000EFQYHO,"Poor production overwhelms the dance content. There's no excuse for such poor quality these days - spend a few bucks and make a decent video!
I bought it as a gift for my father (still a VHS guy) and he likes it, so two stars.",1209081600,,226,4.044444444444444
8108965,4,B000EFQYHO,"I've been ballroom dancing for over 40 years and bought this tape along with vols. 1 & 3 to brush up on some of the dances that we don't do frequently. If you don't keep dancing, you forget a lot of what used to come naturally. Their specialty seems to be Latin dances - swing is not their forte. All steps from discs 1 and 2 are reviewed in disc 3 and that is all I really needed to buy. The pace is slow and repetitive for experienced dancers, but might be just fine for real beginners. Since they cover so many styles the cd set can't go much beyond the basics. The instruction is pretty clear and the camera shots are good enough to learn the steps. If you are a total beginner you might want to start with disc 1; if you are brushing up or adding a couple of styles disc 2 covers all the steps in disc 1.",1200268800,,809,4.0
8108966,5,B000EFQYHO,"This was a great tool for learning basic steps.  The instructors do a great job of explaining the steps and making sure they are not too intimidating for the learner. ( he also had a great sense of humour)
the disc menu was really user friendly and they labeled everything really well.",1195689600,,285,4.480769230769231
8108967,5,B000EFQYHO,"I am a trained dancer, but done little ballroom and needed to learn a number of ballroom and latin dances to be able to teach some friends. Found it very good and easy to learn, Highly recommend to any level of would be dancer.",1194307200,,227,4.181818181818182
8108968,4,B000EFQYHO,"After reading the reviews on Series 1, I decided to jump right to this Series 2 Collection. There is a quick review of the Series 1 instruction before each dance, so if you have any dance talent you'll pick it up quickly. The instructors don't waste time with tedious steps so you don't get bored during each lesson. Lots of dances! I thought the purchase was well worth the money.",1187568000,5,381,4.457142857142857
8108969,5,B000EFQYHO,"I read the other reviews before buying this and I must admit they steered me in the right direction. I started a dance class about two months prior to receiving this and this video helped to cement some things. The explanations and demonstrations are quite good and I had very little to complain about....almost nothing, guess i would have liked to see a bit more variety such as not seeing the 'cuddle ' position shown in two dance types, would have liked to have seen a different figure all together but that is a minor complaint. All in all well worth it, I even skipped the series 1 and got a long fine with their recap...two words buy this!",1185580800,5,645,4.428571428571429
8108970,5,B000EFQYHO,"This DVD is the perfect follow up to DVD 1 or this series. It teaches the man how to lead, something many professional instructors seem to miss. Also, you see footwork and body movement in seperate screen areas. This is a great help. DVD 1 and this one made me order #3 quickly.",1185148800,2,278,4.264150943396227
8108971,5,B000EFQYHO,"I enjoyed this DVD very much.  The production values aren't terrific - it definitely isn't done by professionals.  But, the dancing lessons are excellent.  What I appreciated is that Dennis didn't just explain one way to do a step - he gave tips, in down-to-earth terms, that were easy to understand and execute.  My latin motion improved greatly as a result of using this DVD.  I've also purchased Volume 1 and Volume 3 - and have written to Dennis asking for a Volume 4!",1179273600,7,472,4.571428571428571
