8051626,5,B0007TKNQU,"I love this for my 2 1/2 year old grand daughter. The characters are vivid and adorable. Great graphic design!! Thoughtful, cute characters. Love it!! Grand daughter does too! And Rapunzel is only 25 minutes in length. Delightful for the Little Ones!! Have not viewed the Six Servants yet. Rapunzel would have been quite enough.",1388188800,,328,4.9818181818181815
8051627,1,B0007TKNQU,"I watched the Good Times version of Cinderella many years ago, and while it wasn't Disney of course, I thought I remembered it being pretty good.  I was hoping for the same type of movie.

This one starts off with magic & continues a very heavy magic theme throughout, which I did not like.  While it's not terrifying like Disney can be, it's focus is on the magic too much.  The story has 2 animal characters which ""travel"" into the story so to speak, so you don't really get a feel for the real ""Rapunzel"" story.

Lastly, call me old-fashioned, but Rapunzel yells ""Oh my god"" in one part.  I'm sorry, but I do not agree with it or any bad language in kids movies.  While, yes, it's everywhere in the world, I don't want to hear it in the kids movies I choose to buy.  My little one is only 4 & hasn't been exposed to that - it's coming soon enough in school.

And we fast-forwarded through the Six Servants and it didn't look any better.",1385078400,,939,4.230337078651686
8051628,5,B0007TKNQU,"I bought all the DVDs in this collection and I must say they are a best buy. The stories are somewhat different than the mainstream Disney versions, but in a good way. The animation, the voices, and music are excellent. My 3.5 years old daughter loves them all. I highly recommend them. You can't go wrong for the price.

I am talking about the collection titled The Brothers Grimm, not The Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm.",1230422400,,425,4.51948051948052
8051629,5,B0007TKNQU,"I'm a MS & HS German teacher and I think these DVDs are cute and the closest school-appropriate, non-disney Grimm's fairy tales I've seen yet. Each feature runs about 25 mins. and there are 2 on every DVD which is cool. I also like how they pair a known story with an unknown, so it's new to the kids. A great German-related movie to show (also great for standardized testing days!). The two-pack featured here is great, but even the individual DVDs are a deal!",1210982400,,461,4.435294117647059
8051630,5,B0007TKNQU,"My 6 year old son loves eveything fairytale, and these movies are his favorite. These particular fairytales are not dark and scary like Disney can sometimes be. We have all of these fairytales and will continue to buy them as new ones come out.",1166313600,10,244,4.568181818181818
