8034504,3,B0002Y4THE,"I did not buy these DVD's through Amazon.

Mr. Leftwich is a superb fiddler, great performer, and an above average teacher.  These two videos will compliment any Old Time fiddler's learning curve.  Lessons and tunes are presented in logical order, and Brad's teaching style is just plain wonderful.

I bought my copies from another source because of a considerably lower price than what is charged here.",1411862400,,403,5.0606060606060606

8034506,5,B0002Y4THE,"Nice organization and choice of songs for steady progression of skills.  My only suggestion for improvement would be for Brad to teach the notes of each song by playing a few bars, then repeating them 2 or 3 times so the viewer can play along without having to rewind so much.",1270771200,3,276,4.411764705882353
