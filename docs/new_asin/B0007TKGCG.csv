2240634,2,B0007TKGCG,"Poverty Row's Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) is a studio that issued many interesting, if low budget, films. Judging however by their 1941 crime drama entitled DOUBLE CROSS, PRC was also quite capable of some redolent tripe.

This picture's fatal flaw is in having Wynne Gibson in the star role of Fay Saunders. Gibson is 43, dumpy and too plain-faced to possibly have lured Steve Bronson (Richard Beach, age 35), an otherwise decent but lovestruck cop, into hanging at her illegal casino, which is a regular raid target of police Captain Murray, played by elderly-looking Robert Homans.

Murray's son Jim, our male lead Kane Richmond, has a posh headquarters job, but he trades it in after Fay's boyfriend is kiiled by fellow cops at her  gambling house. She started the fatal shootout, but it's believed by Capt. Murray and others on the force that the Bronson went rogue and gunned down a fellow policeman during one of the captain's raids.

As part of his secret plan to exonerate a dead pal, Jim Murray asks to be assigned to his dad's motorcycle division. Then he pretends to throw in with  Nick Taggart (John Miljan), a gangster who's the actual power behind Fay's Silver Slipper club. Jim purposely gets caught abetting a silk heist and, disgraced, is thrown off the force. The now ex-cop convinces a suspicious Taggart that he hates his own father and wants revenge. Of course it's all subterfuge that only Jim and Ellen Bronson (Pauline Moore), the dead man's sister and fotog at Fay's casino, are in on. With Ellen's help, Jim wil try to destroy Taggart's crime ring even as he proves Steve Bronson's innocence.

.
Also in the cast, delightfully gravel-voiced Frank Moran, as ""Cookie,"" Taggart's dimwitted big lug henchman, and Heinie Conklin.
Director Albert Kelley is best known for.........nothing.
Script is by John A. Albert (his only film) and Milton Raison, writer of multiple episodes of THE MILLIONAIRE,

2240635,3,B0007TKGCG,"The opening scenes of this film depict policeman Steve Bronson (Richard Beach) keeping company with Fay Saunders (Wynne Gibson), whom he believes is his girlfriend, at a night club, The Silver Slipper, when a squad from his Department raids into the rear of the establishment, wherein flourishes an illicit gambling salon, and while the club's owner Nick Taggart (John Miljan) grapples with officers, Fay removes Steve's revolver from its holster and kills a policeman, as her affection for her actual lover Taggart plainly extends beyond what might be considered natural.  When Steve retrieves the murder weapon from false Fay he is, with pistol in hand, shot down by other officers, therewith apparently tagged as being a cop-killer, but this is not accepted by police dispatcher Jim Murray (Kane Richmond), son of the Captain in charge of the tragically suppressant raid, especially following his visit and conversation with Steve at the latter's hospital death bed, after which Jim is determined to bring Fay and Taggart to justice.  While in the process of attempting to infiltrate Taggart's criminal organization, Jim is cashiered from his Department because his father can find no discernible legitimate cause for his son's involvement with the band of ne'er-do-wells, but young Murray persists with his clandestine investigation, sharing his plan with only his fianc&eacute;e Ellen (Pauline Moore), Steve's sister, who gives him emotional support.  When Jim discovers that Taggart is planning to assassinate the senior Murray, his scheme to bring the evildoers to bay must co-exist with a method of saving his father from a violent death, hoping that by success with both ventures he may achieve reinstatement as an officer.  The initial sequences of the film are neatly constructed, with each of the principal characters along with their motivations being quickly and efficiently sketched and interconnected, but as the low budget PRC release, filmed in Los Angeles, continues, a series of leaden incongruities abound, with a viewer's interest being consequently reduced.  Fine Serbian actor Miljan gains the acting laurels here for his polished technique in playing boss of the Forces of Evil and Richmond, of the square-jawed Richard Arlen mode of acting, is suitably heroic throughout, while from the distaff side, Gibson is by turns stiff and shrill, Moore is bland, and Mary Gordon performs comfortably within her characteristic Irish matriarchal part.  Additionally, it is ever a pleasure to watch veteran supporting actor Frank Moran, former top-flight heavyweight boxing contender, who traveled the full distance in title bouts with Jess Willard and Jack Johnson.  Here he is cast as a simple-minded Taggart henchman, albeit one with a heart of gold.",1164067200,3,2767,5.3764434180138565
2240636,3,B0007TKGCG,"I found this harmless little screenplay very good.  What made it more interesting to me is the fact that a friend of mine played a feature role - Pauline Moore, who was born here in Harrisburg, PA.  The photography and reproduction on DVD format was quite good.  I'm trying to put together Pauline's film work in DVD format, and it's presenting me a challenge.  I might point out that Miss Moore was featured also in four of Roy Roger's pictures.  She had a bit part in the first Frankenstein movie as one of the bridemaids.",1121817600,3,524,4.473684210526316

8051252,2,B0007TKGCG,"Wynne Gibson makes a terrible femme fatale.  Neither her persona nor her looks are mesmerizing.  Add to that several problems with believability in the plot and you have a pretty dull hour.  One example of plot problems:  Ellen takes a photograph, using a flash, of crime boss Nick paying off the mayor then hangs around acting as if nothing happened.  Of course Nick noticed the flash, he isn't blind.  Things go downhill from there.

I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1464739200,,507,4.693181818181818
