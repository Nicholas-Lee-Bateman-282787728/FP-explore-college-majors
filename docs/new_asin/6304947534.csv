8363079,5,6304947534,"Funny how actors are superstitious about saying the name of the play, Macbeth.  They always call it ""the Scottish play"". This is not a full-on presentation of the entire play.  In the two-hour running length of  the video the main scenes of Macbeth are acted out, and in between them a  panel of experts from U.C.L.A. and California State University, Northridge  analyze the meaning of the play, scene by scene. The actor who plays  Macbeth, Don Stewart, was a regular on an afternoon soap opera for years  and years.  He always wanted to play Macbeth.  Lady Macbeth is played by a  magnificent young actress by the name of Caroline Carrigan.  Her  performance is exceptional.  (In the other Understanding Shakespeare videos  she portrays Desdemona in Othello, and Juliet's mother in Romeo and  Juliet.) As a learning tool, this video offers an enjoyable way to get a  better understanding of one of Shakespeare's great plays.",949795200,43,926,4.954248366013072
