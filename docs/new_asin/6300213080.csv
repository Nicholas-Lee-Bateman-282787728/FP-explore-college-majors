7805299,5,6300213080,"Past reviewers have labeled this episode as too slow or touchy-feely. In truth, ""Mudd's Women,"" along with other first-season episodes, reveals the extraordinary flexibility of the Star Trek format. It uses a sci-fi element -- that of the Venus drug -- but is at heart a very human story.

It is also wickedly funny. The Enterprise chases a thief and con man into an asteroid field, in the process damaging Enterprise shields and depleting its fuel (called ""lithium"" crystals rather than ""di-lithium"" crystals as in later episodes). The con man is Harry Mudd (the late, great Roger Carmel), the most colorful liar and cheater this side of Andromeda.

Mudd has valuable cargo: three sirens, who make McCoy's scanners go ""bleep"" and who make every male Enterprise crew member salivate (except for Spock, who views the proceedings with decidely un-Vulcanlike amusement). Mudd uses the women as bargaining chips with three lonely lithium miners, who hold the Enterprise hostage until Kirk drops charges against Harry Mudd.

Admittedly, the episode is less action-packed than some, having no fist-fights or monsters in a rubber suit. This is Star Trek for adults. Though there is an attraction between Kirk and one of the women, named Eve, he acts like a responsible leader rather than going into seduction mode as he would in later seasons.

In the end, he turns psychologist, revealing the episode's message: the women never needed the Venus drug if they had belief in themselves. There is also a subplot involving Eve and one of the miners, showing her to be not a sex object but a three-dimensional person. This episode begins with an adolescent approach to sexuality and ends with an adult one. As I stated, Star Trek for adults.",1182211200,,1729,4.993055555555555
7805300,4,6300213080,"The Enterprise encounters space pirate Harry Mudd for the first time, and his ""cargo"" is a bevvy of beautiful women.  Harry's always looking for a good deal, and if he can marry off his ladies to the lonely miners of Rigel 12, he figures he'll make a good haul.  But, as Kirk discovers, the ladies looks are deceiving, and the artful Roger (the great Roger C. Carmel as Mudd) will have a lot of 'splainin to do about Mudd's Women.
  Despite the obvious pre-feminist and somewhat sexist attitude toward the women in this episode from '66, it is still enjoyable and I love it when Eve dresses down Childress about the pots and pans (""Why don't you hang them outside and let the sand blast them clean?"").",1074556800,,701,4.496062992125984
7805301,4,6300213080,"Well, you have to admit that once you see it, you get sort of used to Star Trek, even though there have only been four episodes. The best one of these four is Where No Man Has Gone Before, but if you're not satisfied with the way that episode goes, Mudd's Women probably substitutes a bit. Now, if you don't like the beginning, I don't blame you. I didn't really like it either. But please, don't forward it. Any second it's going to get good. I just can't remember when, except that it's like any other episode or movie, it gets better as time passes. If you think about this movie having that characteristic, you're sure to like it.  And also, if you think this movie is about stuff like kissing, it's not.  I hope that'll be a relief to you.",1001203200,,744,4.2695035460992905
7805302,3,6300213080,"There are a couple of continuity points to mention about this episode.  First, the power source of the Enterprise is introduced as lithium crystals (as opposed to the later technological breakthrough of dilithium crystals).  Second, Spock is identified by Mudd as being ""Vulcanian.""  This is the first time Spock's race is named, even if Mudd didn't get it exactly right.
This episode also begins to explore the idea that the only woman in Kirk's life will be the Enterprise.
""Mudd's Women"" is a fun episode for its first half.  Mudd befuddles Kirk and Kirk befuddles him right back and the exchanges are wonderfully amusing.  The last half of the episode, however, takes a darker turn as the Enterprise is seriously threatened by Mudd's interference.  Once Kirk gains the upper hand again at the very end, though, Mudd is back to being charming and we're reminded of the fun we had as the episode began.  It's too bad we had to take that dark detour in what was otherwise a light-hearted adventure.
One other complaint: Mudd claims to develop a plan that will allow him to take over the Enterprise, but it's never revealed how he will accomplish this.  The best he seems to do is to endanger the ship and the lives of everyone aboard in a scheme to extort his freedom from Kirk.",986428800,,1279,4.678571428571429
7805303,4,6300213080,"The crew of the Enterprise lose their composure as the wickedly funny slimeball weasel Harry Mudd introduces them to three irresistible women. The fun runs out about 2/3 of the way through the episode, but Harry Mudd's antics and scheming sustain the story.  The other Harry Mudd episode is far superior to this one, though.",985651200,,324,4.890909090909091
7805304,4,6300213080,"Harry Mudd is one of my favorite loveable bad guys.  He couldn't tell the truth if his life depended on it!
He means no harm, but you can believe he is definitely up to no good and it will always result in a profit for  himself.
In this episode, he has three very lovely women whom he  plans  on making a profit off of by selling them to some miners who are seeking  wives.
There is a catch though, as all is not as it seems with the women.  (Or is it? ).  Nevertheless, Kirk's crew finds themselves falling under  their bewitching spell, much to the delight of Harry Mudd.
It is only the  Captain (and of course Mr. Spock) who remain level headed in the presence  of such beauty.
And it wouldn't be a Mudd episode without his usual  trickery and underhandedness, as well as his  outright fondness of larceny  and blackmail.
If you are the type of person who somehow can find it in  your heart, to forgive the bad guy and let him get off ""this  time"", then...
""You gotta love Mudd!""",958694400,,982,4.232432432432432
7805305,4,6300213080,"This was my 3rd Star Trek I ever saw and I loved it. The U.S.S. Enterprise computers reveal that Mudd has been charged with a number of infractions of the law. In pursuit of Mudd's ship, the U.S.S. Enterprise has burned out  it's dilithium crystals, which power the starship's engines, and Kirk  orders them to proceed as quickly as possible to the nearest dilithium  mining planet. That planet is Rigel XII, which is inhabited by only three  miners.
Mudd manages to contact Ben Childress, the head miner, and make  a deal with him. Mudd promises to deliver the three beautiful women to the  lonely miners in exchange for dilithium crystals and their help in escaping  Kirk.
Upon reaching the planet, Eve tries to escape, having fallen for  Kirk and not wanting to marry one of the miners, but Ben Childress brings  her back. They discover that the women are using an extremely illegal Venus  drug to make them beautiful and without they become quite plain. By the  time the fraud is discovered, Magda and Ruth are already married to the  miners, to the satisfaction of all parties involved. Eve, who realizes that  Kirk is married to his career and to his starship, settles for marrying  Ben. Kirk gets the crystals he needs for the U.S.S. Enterprise and Harry  Mudd, on whom he has filed criminal charges.",946944000,2,1307,4.721238938053097
