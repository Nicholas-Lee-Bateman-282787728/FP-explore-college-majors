8580498,5,B00CDFXI04,"This DVD is a great part of our submarine history. I remember the old Westinghouse plays from the early 1950's, and this is one of the best. The film is quite entertaining and very informative as well portraying the real and sometimes hazardous conditions aboard submarines. As a proud veteran of the USS Tusk (the rescue sub), I can attest to the Westinghouse depiction of the actual event that occurred August 25, 1949.

The only disappointment I had was that the storyline was almost entirely written from the viewpoint of the crew of the USS Cochino, SS 345. There was little reference to the valiant attempt by the 11 crew members of the Tusk who were washed overboard during the rescue attempt. Four men were recovered and 7 USS Tusk sailors drowned saving the crew of the Cochino. Every year on the anniversary of that fateful day, a few of the Tusk veterans gather in remembrance of our lost shipmates who remain on 'eternal patrol.'

As to the viewing quality of the film itself, it is in excellent condition and I'm grateful to Campbell Films for making it available. I had a slight difficulty viewing it at first and contacted the seller. It turned out the technical difficulty was on my end. He was more than willing to replace the DVD, but it had to do with my player.

I look forward to making several more purchases from Campbell Films in the near future..",1499472000,,1371,4.610655737704918
