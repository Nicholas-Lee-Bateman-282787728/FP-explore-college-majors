8142197,4,B000HX87NC,"In most movies, it's normal/appropriate to primarily consider the story & 'characters' being played, but concerning this movie I ended up mostly enjoying it for the actors themselves.  The songs/music are good.

If you are a Kareena Kapoor (played Shruti)  or  Shahid Kapoor (played Jeetu) fan, then this is a worthwhile movie to watch (I've seen it twice).
It isn't up to the same level as ""Jab We Met"", and it could be frustrating/tedious sometimes, but for a silly movie it was usually enjoyable.

The following statement is a compliment:  since Kareena's character ""Shruti"" is a mute (often termed as 'dumb' in the sub-titles) it forces her as an actress to rely solely on her body language and eye contact.  Which I really liked, she is beautiful in this movie.  She never speaks in the entire movie, except she does 'sing' once during a dance scene (a daydream/fantasy moment - not a real event in the story).  I think she did a great job for this part, intentionally low-key (she drew me into the movie whenever she was on screen).

The UTV version of the DVD is a high quality disc (dual layer, anamorphic, Dolby Digital 5.1, with an 8 page 'booklet' built-in, great menus that were create fully designed), the cinematography is well done, a couple dances & music are good, and the cast are great.

I'm giving this movie 4 stars, for the fun of watching the cast.",1292025600,,1371,4.670833333333333
8142198,2,B000HX87NC,"I found the comedy in this silly and dumb rather than whacky- but the Indians seen to like that style so it may be a difference in taste (I don't like dumber Hollywood ones either). The comedy seems to hinge throughout on how everyone can cheat everyone else and lie to talk their way out of things. The Indians seem to love this (which may partly explain why they have so much trouble with corruption as a nation - though I guess this is also built on a lot of poverty and need to survive in many quarters).
It's a pity as there are some good actors here. Shahid Kapoor is very watchable and dances well and I was very tempted to hold onto this just for the dances and songs he is in. Kareena Kapoor is fine too. But if you like them go for 'Jab we Met' instead.
Some of the songs are very catchy and I downloaded them. Many of the dances are done in white costume which detracted for me from the spectacle that Bollywoods do so well.
I quickly lost interest. The person I was watching with (who is usually a Bollywood fan too) abandoned it completely early. I sort of grazed through it and found little to catch me. This isn't one I'll be keeping - a great pity!.",1227571200,,1165,4.182222222222222
8142199,3,B000HX87NC,"Hello, here come some plot SPOILERS.

The story is pretty wacky. Can you keep up with it? Jeetu (Shahid Kapoor) is a hustler, a fast talker and a teller of yarns. But he's got the business acumen of a gerbil. All his enterprises have gone disastrously wrong, and, so, he owes money to a mob of pushy creditors. In despair and thinking that his life insurance policy will cover his debts, Jeetu jumps into the ocean, leaving behind his grieving family and longtime girlfriend Pooja.

But he survives the drowning, ending up entangled in fishing nets. Jeetu is brought ashore by two fishermen, one of whom - Gundya (Paresh Rawal) - is himself heavily debt-ridden to a very demanding Gujarati businessman, Prabhat Singh Chauhan. A note found in Jeetu's pocket leads Gundya to believe that Jeetu is a millionaire and so might compensate them for saving his life. Jeetu, of course, is no such thing and so, to ward off the greedy fishermen, pretends to be a deaf-mute. Wait, there's more.

Mr. Chauhan, that businessman to whom the fisherman owes money? He has a niece, Shruti (Kareena Kapoor), who happens to be mute, but not deaf. Mr. Chauhan wants to marry Shruti off, something which Shruti wants no part of. In a strange (and quite unconvincing) development, Jeetu lands in the custody of Mr. Chauhan. One night, Shruti and her cousin discover that Jeetu isn't really a deaf-mute. They convince him to pose as Shruti's lover in hopes of derailing the upcoming nuptials.

But what happens when the pretense becomes real? And what will happen when Pooja, Jeetu's first love, re-enters his life?

CHUP CHUP KE, released in 2006, is an out-of-control, farcical Bollywood comedy fraught with slapstick, mixed-up identities, and double dealing mayhem. And, somewhere in all this crazy, there's a love story, as well. The best part of the film lies in the first half, which is nonstop lunacy (I still crack up, thinking about Rajpal Yadav being dumped with all the household chores). But the wheels fall off post-intermission, once the focus turns to the love story and the heavy waterworks begin. Partly, it's because the romantic arc is served up perfunctorily. And, partly, it's because the comedy is dialed down.

Shahid Kapoor reteams with Kareena Kapoor, one of his two constant leading ladies (the other is Amrita Rao). This is the third time they've co-starred in a film (after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fida/dp/B00063UWVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fida</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/36-China-Town/dp/B000I0RVQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">36 China Town</a>), but, even here, they've yet to showcase that amazing chemistry (which is achieved the next year in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jab-We-Met/dp/B001165BG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jab We Met</a>). Here, they're merely okay, individually and as a couple, with Kareena turning in a sweet but mostly unmemorable performance. She does redeem herself somewhat in the film's last few minutes. But, in fact, Shahid displays better on-screen chemistry with Neha Dhupia, who plays Shruti's beautiful, forceful cousin Meenakshi. And, if you're even a casual fan of Bollywood, then you've probably already come across Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal, who are often used supporting actors. The only one missing seems to be the exasperating Johnny Lever. Paresh Rawal, glib as always, and his sidekick Rajpal Yadav are quite funny and keep things moving. Meanwhile, the ever five-o'clock-shadowed Suniel Shetty comes in and does his surly, menacing act as Shruti's domineering brother.

Clocking in at just a bit over 2 hours and 40 minutes (normal for Bollywood), CHUP CHUP KE is a film sparked by an entertaining first half but then falters afterwards in its dreary soap opera antics. One thing this film does is make you sympathize with Pooja, the other love interest, the girl left behind. And, although the filmmakers hedged their bets by ensuring that Pooja isn't too well developed as a character, you still have doubts as to which one Jeetu will end with, up to the very end. Anyway, see this for the madcap comedy; then, it's up to you to stick around for the heavyhanded stuff.",1209945600,,4285,5.453996983408748
