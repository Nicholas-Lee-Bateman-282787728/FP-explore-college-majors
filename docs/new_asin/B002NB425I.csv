It was such a fantastic movie about a widower who became friendly with a family of wolves and how these wolves repaid his friendship by intervening against a bear who was attacking this man.  I enjoyed it so much on television that I just had to have a copy of it for myself.  If you like animal stories, you will love this one. A true human interest story.",1383782400,,419,4.346153846153846
