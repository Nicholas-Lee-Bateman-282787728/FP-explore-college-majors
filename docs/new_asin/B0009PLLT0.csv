8064783,3,B0009PLLT0,"Fairly hokey period piece doesn't deliver much in terms of thrills or history, and features some pretty bad acting exacerbated by patches of poorly looped dialogue, yet 'Stronghold' (1951) still manages to entertain in the classic matinee sense.  Harmless fun produced in Mexico, directed by Hungarian Steve Sekely (1963's 'The Day of the Triffids'), and boasting an over-earnest performance by the lovely Veronica Lake.  VCI's disc offers a reasonably clean print on DVD-R with a handful of trailers and cast and director bios as extras.  2 1/2 stars.",1370908800,2,552,5.25
8064784,4,B0009PLLT0,There are no references during the credits to the fact that Lippert Pictures released this.  The first few seconds of the opening credits and the end title have the look of not being original.  Overall the print loks quite good although there is one instance of a drop-out where there is a missing word during dialogue.,1318636800,3,319,4.678571428571429
