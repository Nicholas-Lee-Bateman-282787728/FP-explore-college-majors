8650006,3,B00JDPDDGG,"The movie was funny, but the quality of the picture seemed a little rough. I noticed that there was a weird outline around characters or objects every time the camera was zoomed out. It just wasn't a clear picture. It makes me wonder if this was an original DVD or not? Overall, the movie was good! Vice Ganda is always a treat to watch!",1410739200,,337,4.28125
