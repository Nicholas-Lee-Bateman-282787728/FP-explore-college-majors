5558281,4,B00B5A9FP0,Daniel Day-Lewis gives a wonderfully subtle performance in this beautifully done movie.  I rated it with 4 stars only because the ending is just such a surprise and shock.  That ending was impossible to love.  You just are not prepared for it.,1374192000,5,243,4.738095238095238

8562778,4,B00B5A9FP0,"This looked like an interesting piece of work, and I rented it from our public library.
It's a wonderful story, once we catch up to its first scene.  The parents are rather comic characters, and a bit distracting.  Overall, this is a wonderful drama, especially through the first four episodes.  The fifth brings everything to an all but too hasty and tragic conclusion.  Day-Lewis, Barbara Kellermann, and the other leads are excellent, and I would award this a good four and one-half stars.",1421625600,2,492,4.891566265060241
8562779,5,B00B5A9FP0,"Forget the clique: they delivered with lightning speed.  I never even heard the thunder afterwards they were so prompt and professional! The book was in the shape as they described unlike so many booksellers that seem to miss the ""flaws"" of a media material.  I as for honesty when describing a possible purchase and that is what I received with this company.  I highly recommend!!!

As to a young Daniel Day-Lewis busting his acting chops on this drama...well, he will NOT DISAPPOINT!  It's a very good but sad tale that is bloody good!",1381104000,2,537,4.731182795698925
8562780,5,B00B5A9FP0,"I saw this on TV when I was a teenager and I loved it then, it was the first production with DDL that I had seen and I thought he was fabulous, I also really liked Benedict Taylor and Barbara Kellermann - watching this again was truly lovely and I almost like DDL's performance in this better than some of his later work.  There are small sections where his acting is a bit forced, but on the whole, it's really good.

With hindsight, I find the plot a bit melodramatic, but it is very much a 19th Century story, so you have to see it in the context of the period.

I'm very glad to have this DVD in my collection anyway - great to find it too, I'd been looking for it for ages...",1374364800,7,680,4.022222222222222
