8257569,5,B00154QA40,"I originally purchased the product for our homeschool. My oldest daughter wanted to learn guitar and I wanted her to learn from a worship music perspective. That was about 10 purchases ago. We have since bought 3 more guitar courses and 3 keyboard courses and 2 bass courses. My kids all play multiple instruments now and can play together as a band and with other folks. I can't express how easy it has been to get them to learn how to play using these DVD's!

Our purchase history:
Beg Guitar original
Beg Guitar accoustic (new)

Worship Band practice DVD

Multitrack Player and about 20 songs plus super chord charts

If you want to learn worship music or you want your kids to learn, this is the way to do it. Just sit down and make the time and do the lessons. Musicademy has so many products that work together to make a complete package and everything is so reasonably priced. We are with the US Military in Italy and hope to visit the Musicademy Studios in England this summer for some private lessons!

Last note....if you are playing acoustic guitar and have not been to your guitar shop to have your guitar 'set up' you need to run and not walk and pay the $40 to have it done. It will make any guitar (except the most expensive) soooo much easier to play.

I own three other training sets for worship guitar and it's just good solid stuff that helps you develop solid foundational skills that you can build upon forever.  Good useful stuff for any musician who hopes to learn or grow in their craft. I have found the ""upper level"" stuff to be sufficiently challenging and helpful too. Great to go back to again and again for refreshers.",1297814400,,446,4.779220779220779
