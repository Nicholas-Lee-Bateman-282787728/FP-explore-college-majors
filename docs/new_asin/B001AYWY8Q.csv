8280441,1,B001AYWY8Q,"So I watched this on Screambox last night. And finally, I think I have found a contender for Apartment 1303 for worst horror movie ever made! For awhile now, I've always referred to Apartment 1303 as the worst movie I have EVER seen. But now here is Bryan Loves You. I could not even keep my eyes open during this piece of Shxt! I fell asleep, no joke.

Don't be fooled just because Horror Legend Tony Todd is in this: He only gives a short introduction at the beginning of the movie, warning us that what we're about to see will disturb us greatly. Boy, was he right! Because I was horrified and dumbfounded how this ever got the green light. The acting is so bad, so unbelievable, (Yeah you, Seth Landau) that it made the acting in Apartment 1303 look Oscar worthy. I'm mainly speaking about Seth Landau's lazy-I-just-got-out-of-bed-and-couldn't-care-less-about-making-this-movie attitude throughout this whole thing. I mean, maybe if you appeared like you gave a shxt, and actually put a little effort into your role, the movie could have been at least decent!

That being said, even if the acting was decent, this movie would still suffer from a suck-asx script. I mean, what's even going on in this movie? White masks, people acting overly creepy for no real reason other than the fact they are followers of ""Bryan"". Bryan who? Who is he? What is he? I feel like that never really gets answered. The only thing you ever really know for sure is that the movie takes place in Arizona, and the cult of Bryan is there, I guess.

I couldn't finish this. It was just too horribly written, too badly acted out, and poorly executed all around. Movies like this give lost footage films a bad name, which is quite sad because lost footage films can be great if done right. But it's because of GARBAGE like Bryan Loves You is why the reputation of lost footage films suffer.",1477094400,,1868,4.620481927710843
8280442,3,B001AYWY8Q,"This movie is worth the sitting...it's creepy and effective, how ever flawed.

It succeeds in the first half, by creating a foreboding, unpredictable atmosphere. You really aren't sure where the movie will be going. If the movie had kept up this atmosphere and pace, I would have given it 5 stars.... but then things change.

The setting moves to a hospital, and there the atmosphere, and the story drops in quality. The main character looses focus, and his motivations and actions don't really seem to fit. He is rescued from the hospital in a poor escape scene, driven to a warehouse, and just walks away. The ending is him driving hours away to see his Mom, but, if the Bryans were as big a cult as the earlier part of the movie implied, how was he able to drive so far without stopping for gas or being seen?

I was also disappointed by the commentary. It wasn't very informative, and is cut short by a shooting by a Bryan cult follower. It's pretty much a self-love fest for Seth Landau.",1274227200,,992,4.5
8280443,5,B001AYWY8Q,"to me this is what can happen when ingenuity outweighs bugetary limitations. obviously this movie was not made for a lot of money. it doesn't matter though, because the story is so gripping that you're on the ride and totally engrossed. 5 stars. cool cameo by george wendt from cheers too.",1260316800,,289,4.686274509803922
8280444,2,B001AYWY8Q,This movie could have been good but the fact that it shows and tells nothing of what happens completely kills it. Oh and for anyone interested in this cuz of Tony Todd (Candyman) he only does an intro so it aint worth the watch.,1260057600,,228,4.204545454545454
8280445,5,B001AYWY8Q,"I like that Anchor Bay can back this kind of original vision. Blending a paranoid thriller about cults and wrongful institutionalization with horror elements like creepy masks and cameos by genre standouts such as Tony Todd, George Wendt, and Brinke Stevens.

Having been filmed documentary-style with handheld camcorders, this really does feel like a set of someone's lost tapes. it's one truly frightening piece. I'm amazed by the kind of discussion that this could provoke, and that's truly beyond what a horror flick is.",1236556800,,524,5.238095238095238
8280446,1,B001AYWY8Q,"Even bryan would be enbarrassed.
This movie is another one of the ""handy cam"" movies with forced, bad acting and is just plain sleep inducing. A good movie could be made from this story, but this isn't it. In short, it's not worth the time and money.
They made me put a star rating.
The real star rating is:
Minus 5 stars!",1225756800,,322,4.209677419354839
