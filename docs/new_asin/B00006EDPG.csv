7967383,2,B00006EDPG,"I picked up this DVD in the hopes to learning more about basic playing concepts with the snare drum.  I was fairly dissappointed that this was just more of a high level overview and not very specific.  They did glance over a lot of the basics and as most instructional DVD's, they don't take the time to break down the concepts, the just blow through it.  DVD was very short...I am not really sure who could benefit from this DVD.",1183075200,,430,4.35
