8530058,4,B000OCXNQC,"This was a weird movie- it wasn't really funny. However it did hold my attention right to the end. The plot is so twisted and the characters so colorful, that you can't help but finish it. I don't know, I sort of liked it- which in itself is weird.",1398124800,,248,4.081632653061225

8530060,5,B000OCXNQC,A very strange movie indeed.  Weirdest thing I have ever watched but for some reason it held my attention.  Strangest yet most interesting movie I have ever seen...,1391904000,,164,4.821428571428571
