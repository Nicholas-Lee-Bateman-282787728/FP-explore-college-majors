849128,3,6304360819,The Script is not the best and the plot is highly improbable but the on going musical theme sort of sticks in your head. I watch the movie to listen to the theme.,1241222400,,162,3.9393939393939394
849129,4,6304360819,"The taste of vistory is so fleeting that before you get to gloat. it is in

the past tense. Relive someone's else victory and you see it for what it really is. Sure, you can celebrate your D-days and your Iwo-Jimas and your

triumph over very ill and dying soldiers at Waterloo but it is only retained subjectively in your flawed memory machine.

Speaking of flawed memory machine, hey, isn't this like the 2nd war movie

and the third Drama George Hamilton & George Peppard were in?",1173571200,,483,4.517241379310345
849130,3,6304360819,"For those who haven't yet seen this forgotten Italian-made war film (aka Contro 4 bandiere), this movie has the lovely actress Capucine in it. That alone earns the movie at least three stars! Despite the great cast and the abundant action, this movie has so many cliches and corny dialogue that you'll need a dose of Aleve just to finish it. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed watching this war movie ever since I was a kid, only now I see all the plot holes and flaws. I mean come on, the ""German"" fighter planes are nothing but British spitfires with German insignia painted on them!

The movie begins on August 24, 1939, in a Paris cafe, where six friends (George Peppard, George Hamilton, Horst Bucholz, Anny Duperey, Sam Wanamaker, and Jean Pierre Cassel) from different countries (of course) are about to be torn apart by World War Two. They vow to meet again on the next August 24, not realizing that the war would still be raging then. All six join the Allies, except the lone German in the group, Horst Bucholz. Bucholz becomes a Panzer commander and eventually fights against his former friends in the battle of Normandy in June 1944. Each of the six friends takes an active role in the war, and from the British evacuation from Dunkirk to the liberation of Paris, they stuggle to survive and keep in contact with one another. Along the way, Capucine enters the picture as a heroine who will risks everything to save Allied pilots from being captured by the cruel Gestapo.

By the liberation of Paris, however, only three of the six (I won't say which) have survived, and they share a tearful reunion in the same Paris cafe where they had vowed to return. The battles scenes have plenty of explosions, but they are extremely unrealistic. With a cast like this, though, I absolutely recommend this guilty pleasure to fans of war movies. Just don't set your standards too high! By the way, a lot of the battle scenes in this are the same scenes featured in another European war movie (Partizanska eskadrila (1979), aka ""Battle of the Eagles""). Unfortunately, since both movies were released in 1979 I have no idea which movie copied from the other.",1136246400,14,2154,4.66578947368421
849131,4,6304360819,"I checked this out because I really like Umberto Lenzi and George Peppard. I was not disappointed, this is easily my favorite of Lenzi's WWII films. The film is about the effects of WWII on a group of friends, basically. Plenty of action and drama to keep you entertained. And George Hamilton is actually really kick ass in this, I was surprised!

The dvd ain't so hot, though. Its vhs quality but it is watchable and the sound quality is okay. Its worth picking up if you want to see a different side of Lenzi, are interested in Italian WWII films, or if you like George Peppard.",1128211200,3,580,4.420560747663552
849132,3,6304360819,"The other reviews for this film have listed most of it's major flaws.  It is indeed improbable that this group of people would become such close friends, and George Hamilton as a Frenchman strains credibility as much because of his  public image as for any other reason.  The thing that sets this movie apart for me is that it features a really good perfomance from Sam Wanamaker and the last good role (that I am aware of) for Capucine.  I realize she is an actress of limited range, but I was always fond of her and enjoyed many of her movies.  Most of her later career work amounts to cameo roles in productions not worthy of any name actress let alone one with her style and class. Her character has style, grace, compassion and courage, as I would like to believe the lady did herself.  If you are a Capucine fan, I recommend this movie highly.",1076716800,6,849,4.410256410256411
849133,3,6304360819,"This Italian made WWII movie is average at best.  The major cast members are luminaries from the United States, France and England.  The battle scenes are well-done with plenty of tanks and extras, but there is not much of a plot.  The story, focusing on a group of friends from different nations who go separate ways during the war, is improbable and only dwelt one sporadically.  Recommended only for WWII movie fans.  The VHS from Media is of good quality.",1016496000,5,459,4.6875

Both the audio and video quality was terrible...as if someone used an old camcorder to film the movie being played on a television set.  Do not buy from this vendor!!!",1451952000,2,334,4.724137931034483

7868547,3,6304360819,"In many ways, this movie seems to be a remake of the movie ""The Victors"".  It sort of has the same theme, the futility of war. 2 of the actors are the same, George Peppard and George Hamilton. But ""From Hell to Victory"" just doesn't measure up to ""The Victors"".  I just wish I could buy ""The Victors"" at a less than ridiculous price.  ""From Hell to Victory"" is a pleasant story; it's a pleasant way the spend the time of its run.",1329955200,2,429,4.144578313253012

Night Scenes Were Too Dark to See at All! Cover Looks Like It Was Printed off a REALLY BAD Home Color Printer. Back Says Digitally Mastered - Widescreen Presentation - English 2.0 - Interactive Menus NONE of this was true!! Didn't fit on my screen properly had to undersize (1st time hundreds of movies on this TV, I ever had to do that) Sound was awful. Menu says play and scene selection that's it with a single picture background. Name of the company says ""Trinity Home Entertainment"". I think Amazon got taken by their vendor and ultimately I was the one that got screwed!!! Very disappointed!!!!! I Saw this movie when I was a kid and enjoyed it! I know it wasn't the greatest movie! This terrible copy ruined the Nostalgia for me! I won't forget that AMAZON!",1282176000,5,929,4.535714285714286
