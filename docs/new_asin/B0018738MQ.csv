Just the owners of great sport cars facing their rivals in a healthy competition.
I'm waiting for the next gtboard DVD and will buy it as soon as those guys release it.",1349136000,,313,4.064516129032258
8268647,5,B0018738MQ,If your a hot rodder or a bimmer fan this dvd is a must own.  Outstanding races and good footage.  You won't be disapointed.  I highly recommend the first dvd of this series as well.,1232841600,,182,4.142857142857143

8268649,5,B0018738MQ,"After eagerly awaiting the release of the second shootout put on by Gustav from gtboard/m5board, I was MOST pleased to have finally received it. And it was worth waiting for. Great production, and great content, just like the first instalment. If you're a petrol head, or more importantly, a Bimmer fan, then you HAVE to purchase these series of DVDs. The only disappointment is that after the waiting, I now start all over again waiting for the third DVD! ;o)",1211932800,2,460,4.7625
8268650,5,B0018738MQ,"After watching this DVD TWICE I'm ready to give my review.  Again my Hats off to all the drivers who ran their cars to the limits to make me smile and yell WOW over and over again. $30 not too steep WELL WORTH IT!

This is one outstanding 1st Class racing DVD.  If you don't have it get it! NOW!

I enjoyed watching the Corvette ZO6 dominate as usual, but OMG! What are the Europeans going to do when the 620 HP ZR1 hits the streets?

Oh and thanks guys for showing me how slow my 2006 M3 must be compared to this class of cars.  You let the world see that the new M3 is just that....an m3...not a M5 or M6 lol, but they were all tuned.  I just wished you would of showed better footage of the supercharged White M3 racing maybe next DVD (hint).  The Supra had problems I hope his motor is ok and he's back for the next DVD.  Reading the driver's subtitles was entertaining.

OK MY ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS DVD:  The stat cards with engine info and car brands for the cars racing was much better done in the first DVD.  That big bulky index card you all used was a bit tacky and took away from the start of the races.  This no way takes away from the 5 stars this DVD and the Drivers and Producer's earned! JOB WELL DONE AGAIN.

Only way you can possibly make these series even better is to look into hiring a helicopter to give some aerial footage!",1211241600,2,1346,4.068441064638783
8268651,5,B0018738MQ,"I am a bit of a perfectionist and with that admitted up front, I am only giving this four point five out of five stars.  Rounding up, that will be five stars.

The video is professionally done this time around and it really makes a difference.  The subtitles help us who only speak English, the audio quality, the near-HD content (buy the PAL version and watch it on your computer for top quality compared to NTSC), the collection of cars, and the list goes on...  This really is something to come back to and watch over and over.  Just great!",1211155200,4,543,4.39
8268652,5,B0018738MQ,"After watching various short low quality clips online for a while I decided to bite the bullet and buy the 2 dvds - and what gems they are.

I'm not normally a fan of straight line drag races, but the length of the runway makes this far more interesting to watch as it puts it into a ""real world"" context that the 1/4 mile can't do.  By the end of each run it's hard to argue with the results given the length allows the cars to make back ground lost from slow starts and shows the effects of wind resistance and gearing.

The wide mix of cars, sheer quantity of races and the driver commentaries all blend into making the gtboard dvds the best I think I've seen and a real breath of fresh air compared to the glitzy over-produced dvds car lovers usually find themselves having to make do with.

The video quality is excellent and the in-car footage gives a better feeling of actually being there in the passenger seat - anyone who loves engine sounds rather than trashy pop music as a soundtrack will be in their element here.",1210723200,,1027,4.333333333333333
8268653,5,B0018738MQ,"This is the ultimate super car show down.  You name the car and Gustav likely has one on this video.  The cars race on a closed air field from a rolling start (about 25mph) and then they hit the loud peddle for all it's worth!  Ever wanted to take a spin down the Autobahn at 206 + MPH in a BMW M6?

This is a no bull DVD.  1 hour plus of cars going fast in a safe organized fashion.  This is not your basic 20 year old kid riced Honda video.  This is incredible super cars with modifications that make your head spin.  It has great graphics that show the stats of each car as they line up for each race.

Image and audio quality are top notch as well.

Thank you Gustav!",1210204800,,671,3.9402985074626864
8268654,5,B0018738MQ,"This series of DVDs focuses on the world's fastest cars and how they perform beyond 0-60 and the quartermile.  This is a world where all 400+ hp cars are not the same.  These videos show how power, gearing, weight and aerodynamics affects performance.

Simply amazing.  This video is professional with excellent text tags and even has a great English subtitle.

There is also an advanced menu system where you can pick a car like the BMW M6 and see how it performs against 911s, Corvette Z06, Porsche Carrera GTs.

You can also just kick back and watch the movie end-to-end with a set of headphones....the cars sound amazing.....

Awesome.  Great job Gustav.",1210118400,,658,4.8125
