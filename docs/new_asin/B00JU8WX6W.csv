8653875,5,B00JU8WX6W,"This collection of what the author calls Video Song Poems is fun to watch and listen to.  Schoenewolf wrote the poems as well as composing the songs, doing the drawings and shooting and performing in the videos.  It is really a one-man show, with his wife, Julia, helping out in some of the songs.  What I liked most about it is that the poems were lovely and the music was also very nice, some songs having an especially haunting quality.  Schoenewolf is not a professional singer, but he manages to carry his tunes in a raw voice that is usually appealing.  The songs are simple and also philosophical.  The first song, ""Be False,"" sets the tone for all the rest, and is one of my favorites.  It, like others, has a Zen-like ambiance--a simple call for harmony.  This is different than most every other music video you'll watch, since the songs are first of all poems that dig deep into the human psyche.  If you like off-beat stuff, this may be to your liking.",1399766400,,963,4.488505747126437
