8162756,5,B0009AM2IO,"I agree with the review also attached to this VHS tape listing. But I would up the ante a bit. Split Enz were grossly underestimated outside ANZ, and this video clearly shows what masterful musicians they were (and are still by the way). Tim is graced with one of the most beautiful tenor voices on earth. Neil coaxes chords out on his various guitars, and just kills his vocals, which sit just below Tim's on the soaring-heights scale. The brothers and their amazing co-creators in Split Enz just give a master class in musical excellence here - it's a must have concert video. Even though most will justifiably seek out a streaming copy on YouTube, this effort deserves a BlueRay collectors release.",1521590400,,701,4.754098360655738
8162757,4,B0009AM2IO,"I bought a used VHS copy via an Amazon reseller and was very pleased with the quick service and the like-new quality of the tape.  This concert is not available on DVD as of this writing.

This is 1982 live concert performed in Canada, about the time of their ""Time and Tide"" album, so about half the songs are from that release.  In order, the songs are Fire Drill, One Step Ahead, Giant Heartbeat, Lost for Words, Hello Sandy Allen, Nobody Takes me Seriously, 6 Months in a Leaky Boat, Small World, Never Ceases to Amaze Me, Dirty Creature, I Got You, Shark Attack, Haul Away, History Never Repeats.  I believe this was a concert taped for TV, so it is professionally shot, it looks very good, great lighting and angles, and good stereo sound.  All the Split Enz members of the time are there - Tim and Neil Finn, Noel Crombie, Nigel Griggs, Eddie Rayner.  Noel has the drumming duties on this one, I guess Malcolm had already left the band.  If you are a Split Enz or Crowded House fan, don't be afraid to buy this, it's a nice addition to an Enz collection.",1294358400,8,1061,4.38265306122449
