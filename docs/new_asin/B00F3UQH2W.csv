8612176,5,B00F3UQH2W,"I love this album! I bought it because I didn't have any Kpop CDs and I fell in love with FT Island the first time I heard them in You're Beautiful. Well I fell for HongKi mostly and I love his voice so I want all of FT Islands CDs. The songs are amazing and touching, I generally want to cry because of how beautiful HongKi's voice is even if the song is supposed to be happy. It comes with a picture booklet with lyrics.",1387152000,4,422,3.976470588235294
