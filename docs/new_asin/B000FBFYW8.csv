2559147,4,B000FBFYW8,"This DVD contains two separate documentaries showcasing highlights from culled from both the 1987 and 1991 World Series.  The 1987 series (Twins vs. Cardinals) is narrated by Al Michaels who was also the play-by-play voice and is joined by analysts Tim McCarver and Jim Palmer on the calls.  Ernie Harwell narrates the 1991 series (Twins vs. Braves) with Jack Buck and McCarver as the broadcast team in the highlights.  In addition to the highlights, there are also brief interview clips that were obviously conducted shortly after the games were played.

While this volume will obviously be of interest to Twins fans, the truth is that any baseball fan would do well to check it out.  The 1991 series was truly incredible and is arguably the greatest of all time.  I'm not a fan of either team and I bought this solely because I remembered how suspenseful and dramatic it was.  The highlights could have been a bit longer for the 1991 series but for the most part they did a decent job of capturing the sense of what happened.  The 1987 series was certainly entertaining and contained interesting story lines but it's definitely the lesser light here.

The worse aspect of the DVD is the basic quality of the audio/video.  The sound comes out a bit harsh and the music soundtrack sounds like it was composed and recorded entirely on a PC.  To call it low budget really doesn't cover it.  The picture quality is equally bad and a real disappointment.  In addition to looking like a poor quality videotape, the focus is extremely soft and at times there is even a mild ghosting effect that really detracts from the viewing experience.  If this DVD were sold for half its current price, this might be more forgivable but as it is, this is really inexcusable.

In the final analysis, I recommend this product but definitely with reservations.  I hope that MLB will someday see fit to release a highlight DVD of the 1991 World Series that truly does it justice.  But, at the moment, this is the only option available to baseball fans.  So despite the relatively high price and weak production values I would recommend any true fan to pick up a copy and enjoy one of the great match-ups of all time.",1191196800,17,2194,4.669270833333333

8120011,4,B000FBFYW8,"I thought this item was well made for a general Twins fan (mine had a video issue in the 1991 section, but was very brief and though annoying, did not take away from the dvd as a whole). It was fun to watch the highlights and remember back to those times how I felt and what I was doing. It was nostalgic! But for a die hard Twins fan or baseball fan, it might not be enough to just see the highlights. I'm waiting for a dvd of the 1965 world series...",1265068800,,452,3.9239130434782608

8120013,2,B000FBFYW8,"Okay, so I thought I was getting a helluva deal when I purchased this item. It had vintage World Series footage from both 1987 and 1991...as a huge Twins fan that seemed like a great deal.

Unfortunately, it's basically just the exact footage--undoctored, unrestored, etc--from back in the day. The same corny announcers. The same crappy quality. Although they did add a bunch of really, really, REALLY lame music to ""spice things up"" a bit.

I thought I was getting a far more modern, sleek updated video package chronicling the Twins two improbable World Series runs, instead I received a compilation video I could have made myself.

Boooooooooooooooo!!",1234224000,4,655,5.046296296296297
8120014,5,B000FBFYW8,"After reading the other review of this item, I feel compelled to mention that I have this DVD and noticed no problems with the production quality.  It's not high definition by any means, but it looks and sounds like the original broadcast to me.  I suppose if you're going to play it on a 60' HD TV, some of the inherent flaws with the original broadcast will be noticeable, but the footage is 20 and 17 years old (has it been that long?), so it's not going to look like a 2008 broadcast.  Besides that, it's only eleven bucks.  If you want to relive the highlights from two thrilling 7 games World Series match-ups, don't hesitate.

FYI - I also have the complete broadcast of the 1987 World Series, and that DOES have a couple of audio flaws in it.  The first 2.5 innings from game 6 are pretty bad and worth complaining about, but this DVD is fine.",1214697600,6,851,4.320754716981132
