8758155,1,B01E9MKDB0,"Great TV show.. But this is a cheap deal...
And they leave the CC closed Caption off of it.. It's on the first two seasons.
But this cheap Co. does not want to take the time/money to keep it on the rest of the seasons..
And yes they could of got it. It's on it all ready... They just don't want to pay for the rights.
They will not get my money..",1464307200,4,346,3.8194444444444446
