8477379,5,B005L84QTC,this is a really good documentary about the beloved irish drinking holiday. wait a moment st. Patrick's day is not only about drinking but religion too. who would of thought that. I sure did not know that it had a religious background until I watched this fantastic documentary about the origin of the holiday. this movie sure gave me a different perspective about this holiday. great documentary and I think everyone should see it and celebrate st. Patrick's day for the holiday it is(not only drinking). if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1458345600,,561,4.73469387755102
