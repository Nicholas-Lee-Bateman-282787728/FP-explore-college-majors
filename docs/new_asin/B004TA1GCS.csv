4465380,4,B004TA1GCS,"well I have only whatched a few in sub cause i would rather watch the dub.
after that I went looking for the manga and found one on MANGAREADER on the internet and gose up to chapter 47 at this. reading this and the episodes are different starts but the anime follws the manga are quite close to each other. the manga gose past where the anime ends and is possible for a second season which personally think won't happen. as for getting the anime i think it is worth it.
the only i don't like is the fact your buying it twice dvd and blue ray i just want one or the other thanks",1307923200,4,578,4.034782608695652
4465381,4,B004TA1GCS,"While I liked this show very much, I red in a site that the edition aired and home editions (dvd BD) will be edited, and this goes for this series and this series alone. Is this the edited one? I can presume an uncut edition will come in the future?",1305676800,4,249,4.0
4465382,4,B004TA1GCS,"a few quick points to know about this series to help gauge whether you want to watch it.

1. The anime is not the manga. so don't be disappointed. given the ongoing status of the manga series (which is highly entertaining) and the need to adapt for anime format, the story has undergone a few significant changes that give it more of a sense of resolution than the manga does. so know that you are watching a different story (and different style of art as well - looks more like Bakemonogatari than the manga).

2. While not the manga, the anime version is still quite entertaining and enjoyable. Dance, while certainly just another vampire story, does a good job mixing up the modern and the typical cast of mythical characters so that one doesn't feel like this is Blade redux. While not groundbreaking story work, i found myself pretty engrossed. the role of the Werewolves is pretty sweet.

3. as you can tell just from the cover (and more so from the opening credits), Dance plays up the loli theme pretty directly. While tame by other loli standards and not a deal breaker by any means, for those who might be uncomfortable with content of that sort, this would be good to note before investing in watching. I found it tolerable, though i had a few uncomfortable moments. and, generally, the content is pretty edgy. which is fine if you like that, but might be a turn-off if you don't.

overall, i recommend with the above warnings.",1303689600,42,1438,4.583657587548638
4465383,5,B004TA1GCS,"This series is an easy 4-41/2 stars for creativity,art,storyline and character developement. As I have another production version and not this particular product, I can only recommend the series but I am sure the product offered here should meet or surpass one's expectations.
This story is about a vampire queen looking for a safe homeland for vampires,the ""good"" ones willing to leave the general population alone,a place for those that chose not to engage in the vampire lifestyle by pulling out their fangs,etc. The adult queen has transformed her body into that of a 10-year-old because if she is of a mature age she must choose one of the three vampire family heads to marry and thus propetuate the vampire royal boodline. As she does not wish to lay down with any of them and wishes to,instead, spend her life with her chosen boyfriend,she refuses to show her mature body,which creates the tension for the storyline.
Her chosen one starts out the series as a teenager in a local highschool that has no memory of his history longer than a year ago. There is,of course, a girl that wishes to care for him,etc., but,unlike too many such storylines, this girl ""matures"" as the plot thickens, but,to tell more would give too much away. He,on the other hand,take forever to catch on to the multible romantics that begin to swirl around him. In other words,typical male behavior. His role in the storyline,however,is crucial to the plot.
The student body president,a female,is the principle player in a branch story that has a few surprises,especially with most anime series about students usually portraying student leaders as too stiff and unwilling/unable to mature or change. Most would,I think, will find the outcome of this sub-plot both surprising and not entirely unpleasant.
There is very limited fan service and nudity,in any form, is virtualy non-existant.
This is a very good series to get involved with and it remains up to the individual buyers if the product offered here is within their budget.",1301875200,61,2010,4.967359050445104

4465388,3,B004TA1GCS,"Picked this up after seeing the manga at Barnes and Noble. I gave it 3 stars because there is more wrong with this that good in my opinion. First off, SKIP episode 1 and you will live much happier. Coming from someone who has been watching all genre of anime for almost 25 years I can easily say it has one of the grossest scenes I have ever seen in anime. This anime should be avoided if purchasing for a gift.

Other than that, the character development is pretty shallow and the main characters don't even have a reason for loving each other. I am glad to have in my collection as the story is interesting and it is unique.

Say it with me before we part ways: ""I WILL SKIP EPISODE 1.""

4465393,5,B004TA1GCS,"This is an informational review.  I really enjoyed the series, and I can't add anything to the other reviews, however, I wanted everyone considering ordering this to be aware that this Blu-Ray / DVD combo comes in DVD packaging, not Blu-Ray packaging.

4465395,4,B004TA1GCS,"The first episode shows off a Japanese variety show vibe, with lots of details, dating the anime, but not in a bad way. Some really good animation here, with good slow motion and action shots. It occasionally feels a bit overdone, but it never gets annoying. A bit of fanservice, but it doesn't overtake the story, characters, or plot. Good Japanese voice acting and a main male character that is refreshingly good, though, he's a bit of an idiot. They're all quite good. There's a ruthlessness to it that rears up and sets up tragedy. There's a sudden, fake out ending in the middle that could have been built up to a series finale. Where it goes is ok, though.",1486684800,,662,4.525

4465400,5,B004TA1GCS,"This is a great anime. I have watched it twice. I can't yet speak for the English voice acting, but the Japanese voice acting is amazing, as is the animation.
It is a great story of love and politics. For those worried about loli content, don't worry too much. Past the first few episodes, it doesn't really show up too much and what's there is not sexual to any degree. I wasn't too uncomfortable with princess mina's fairly frequent outfit changings. If you can look past the maybe 10 minutes total of mina being naked, I would definitely recommend this series.
The disks were in good shape upon arrival, but the. Case was kind of beaten up, though. Even on standard shipping, it arrived within a week.

4465424,5,B004TA1GCS,"The series opens up with a brief introduction on some of the main characters and then begins to get more and more intense as episodes go by. The show is accompanied by a menacing yet cute heroin. I don't normally enjoy Vampire themed shows or anime but this was great in the romance/suspense category, there are even a few moments that have managed to make me laugh.

I highly recommend this show to people who enjoy the two categories I mentioned above, on a scale of 1-10 I would seriously give this an 8.5/10 because ( scroll down, * POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!! * )

8.5/10 because of the way the show ends, it leaves the viewer BEGGING for another season in my opinion because of how the scenario works out with the ""true-blood legacy"" and there still being another opponent that can wreak havoc on Princess Mina's story, other than that though the show ends nicely with the main love interest.",1439078400,,927,4.452941176470588

Watching the young princess having lotion smeared on her naked body at first you wonder if this is a little over the top, but as time goes on you realize that her true form has to remain hidden to protect herself and her people. The love between the princess and akuara (sp) is a love that transcends time, and the action is great. The hero truly loves her and fights to the end to protect her and she truly loves him.

And now the controversy. some are calling it child porn, although there is child nudity, only the child is more than a hundred years old, being a vampire, that child nudity never become porn. this is a ""be very careful"" buy. Vampire Bund WILL  offend some. those who collect anime and manga will likely as not be offended. those that feel child nudity IS child porn WILL be extremely offended. would not recommend Vampire Bund as a GIFT buy. even if you think you really know the person that you are getting the gift for, this is not the gift to get. this is a Personal buy only.",1419897600,20,745,4.246478873239437

4465450,5,B004TA1GCS,"Seems one of the most brought up negatives in reviews is the bits of nudity on display by Mina throughout the series, which if you watch one or two EPS then yeah seems pretty racy and perverted.
This however is a well written fantasy drama, with some great fighting scenes, more than a couple of love stories, and all around well written mystery, and the first anime I ever watched that didn't creep me out with its loli factor one bit.
Although it takes almost the entire series, by the time the story is done, everything makes sense and is explained when it comes to these ""controversial"" scenes.
Great anime, great american dub (YAY Monica Rial, Todd Haberkorn and Cherami Leigh) and worth every penny if you don't already have JP release
Closing note, I find it odd more people are freaked out by Mina than they are the relationship/borderline reverse loli situation with Nanomi/Yuzuru",1380499200,,889,4.741935483870968

4465455,4,B004TA1GCS,"I will admit, I love anime and have become an avid collecter. I have read other reviews that this is a boring anime and not enough fighting going on
It is if you are only interested in fighting animes. If you like different genres which I do, this is an interesting take on the whole vampire phenom. The whole premise of the child vampire with the mind of a woman still intrigues, especially when one finds things are not what they seem, allies become enemies and forbidden love blooms as well.
If you are only interested in sword fights and ninja brawls skip it. There is fighting and blood enough in this so it doesn't become mired in sappyness.
But if you like all types of anime, get it. I only wish there were more episodes to this story.",1368057600,,743,4.35251798561151

4465457,5,B004TA1GCS,"Dance in the Vampire Bund picks up on a lot of modern vampire tropes, the major one being the difficulty of finding a way for vampires and humans (and werewolves) to co-exist. The proposed solution in this case is to purchase a small reclaimed island off the shore of Tokyo, as an independent homeland for vampires. Financially this is no problem for the vampire queen, Mina Tepes, whose kind have been building their stock portfolios since Gilgamesh put the first city wall contract out to tender in Uruk, but there are plenty of political problems along the way. Dance is not devoid of clichs (even from my limited knowledge), but it is quite lightfooted in its use and sometimes subversion of them. For example, the bath of blood in which we see Mina bathing, Elizabeth Bthory style, turns out to be a special sunblock gel. Of course, the subversion of vampire clichs is by now a clich in itself, but I like the rather meta way they address this issue in the first episode, which features a gameshow in which the reality of vampires is debated by, amongst others, a writer of vampire manga (none other than Nozomu Tamaki, author of, er, Dance in the Vampire Bund), and which undermines a number of the genre's default settings - for example the assumption that vampire queens are sexy and impossibly voluptuous.

The plot is complex, meshing the politics of the various competing vampire factions, a local junior high school where Mina enrols briefly, and human-vampire dealings in general, as well as a set of tricky personal relationships, many with long backstories; but at its heart lies vampire queen Mina, and particularly her relationship with Akira, the teenage amnesiac boy who (as he slowly comes to recall) is a member of her devoted werewolf guard and her sworn personal protector.* Not that Mina necessarily needs much protection. She is a skilled exponent of waif-fu, as she occasionally demonstrates, and quite capable of giving it to attackers in the neck, but usually she does not need to fight because she is also several steps smarter than everyone around her, an arch intriguer, and possessed of a preternatural power of command over (most) other vampires by virtue of her royal bloodline, which derives from Vlad of that ilk. In her attempt to build a place where vampires can exist peacefully, and where the fangless (those vampires who've foresworn human blood) can live without fear of persecution, she has her heart in the right place - or seems to - but she is passionate, vain, wilful, worldly and wily, quite capable of deceiving those who love her (and whom she loves) for her own ends. Altogether I found it a fascinating series - not least as a study of the conflicting yet inextricable demands of the personal and the political, which extend in Mina's case to her own body - and in a specifically gendered way, as we shall see. I suspect that Cleopatra has a prominent a place in her literary bloodline - and wonder whether the scene where we see Mina skipping with some fangless children might even be a direct allusion to Enobarbus's ""I saw her once/ Hop forty paces through the public street"". But this is a resolute Cleopatra with a head for figures, who would never flinch from Actium.

As you'll have guessed by now, I really enjoyed Dance in the Vampire Bund. It's clever, nicely animated, and complex enough - especially with its elliptical style and habit of fast cross-cutting between scenes - that on several occasions I had to rewind to check I hadn't missed an important visual detail while reading the subtitles (or vice versa). However, it's a controversial series, mostly because Mina, although centuries old, has the appearance of a nine-year-old girl. Given that she appears semi-naked in several scenes (though more typically she wears full-length dresses), and that on a couple of occasions she teasingly flirts with Akira and even creeps into his bed to sleep it's probably inevitable that the series has gained a reputation as lolicon. There's nothing kawaii about Mina, but it's true that she's not exempt from the tiresome fan-service shots of rippling school skirts, to which most of the teenage girl characters are also subject. Looking on Google images just now, it's clear that much of the artwork associated with the series (as well as the closing credits) tend to sexualise her, too, even if the story proper doesn't. If someone were turned on by young girls they could certainly find material in Mina. On the other hand, they could also find material in the Mini Boden catalogue.

As I was watching the series I was consciously trying to do so on its own terms, rather than distracting myself with gatekeeperly thoughts of a ""What if a child/pervert saw this?"" nature. That seems the least one can do for any work of art - and if I ever get around to reading Nabokov or watching the James Mason film I'll try to do it in the same spirit. But such questions inevitably pose themselves afterwards - questions about the intentions of the makers (the fan service), and about the dynamics of what is going on on screen.

For the moment, I find that - while I'd happily lose the fan-service - I'm not overly bothered by Mina's child-like appearance. Partly this is because if there is a the lolicon theme it is not modelled by any of the characters, at least in relation to her.** I don't think she as much as kisses anyone throughout the entire series; nor, more importantly, does anyone find her sexually attractive, although many are devoted to her. This is actually an important plot point. It turns out that she maintains her physically immature appearance precisely to avoid having to marry and enter a sexual relationship with one of the remaining pureblood vampire families. Appearing prepubescent is her way of maintaining her celibacy and thus her power. (Mina also has an alternative appearance as a decidedly unchildlike gold-skinned woman, but she keeps this secret so as not to be forced to marry.) As well as Cleopatra, then, she has learned some lessons from the Virgin Queen, for whom sexual denial was the price to be paid for political power. The series's most brutal scene (though thankfully not a graphic one) comes when the heads of the clans with a claim to her hand insist on a ""purity test"" - as it is their right to do every ten years. It is made clear that this physical humiliation is intended primarily as a way to ""put her in her place"". However, both as a female and as a ""child"", Mina is consistently underestimated by her antagonists. Is the Bund a political master stroke, or just the vampire equivalent of the Petit Trianon, where Mina can play at a role that is unsustainable in reality, as her enemies would like to think? You'll have to watch it to find out. - Catherine Butler

* I happened to watch this the night after seeing the first Bourne movie. I think that's enough amnesiacs who lose their memory while on a mission, at least for a while.
** More problematic is a subplot in which an older teenage girl's obsession with the 13-year-old boy next door - about which she feels self-disgust - turns out to be reciprocated. No doubt things like that happen in real life from time to time, but I wouldn't have minded a few ""Don't try this at home, kids"" signals.",1365811200,,7264,4.734597156398104
4465458,5,B004TA1GCS,"Charles Solomon, who wrote the Amazon review is an idiot, and probably too conservative to write and say that this series is a ""crashing bore,"" which HE probably is.  There are elements in this series that are anything BUT, and this video is intended for the Mature who are serious about their Anime.  The graphics, artwork, story, and characters are memorable, and as usual in Anime, the costumes are colorful, attractive, and stunning--so don't listen to what Charles has to say.  I watched this entire series in one sitting because I was gripped!  The tale is a love story between a lad and the reigning Vampire Princess, who is a descendant of Vlad Tepes (The Impaler).  I am not going to ruin it for you by telling you anything other than the series is worth your time to enjoy, and to discourage you from listening to what Charles Solomon has to say.  I will say, however, that there are lesbian, Lolita, smoking, violence and gore, fantastical and mythical, blatant sexuality, and even a Gynecological scene, of all things, but done WELL--themes that make Modern Anime what it is, and why open minded people like myself are constantly searching for in their Anime tastes.  Am I a pervert?  Maybe.  But I know GOOD ANIME from ""crashing bores,"" and I enjoy Mature Anime because I am an ADULT.  I hope I have encouraged you to enjoy this series; you will find it enjoyable, I believe, if you approach themes I had mentioned with an adult's open-mindedness.

Some of the current mythology is incorporated in the story how sunlight is deadly and roaming out and night, and to turn into one is to be bit by one.

The over all story line is very good, but the way it is carried out as I mentioned, could have been better. I really enjoyed the artwork. The style is great. Character development was good as well. The only thing that might creep people out is the fact that Mina's normal form is that of a child and she does get naked... a lot. This series has some kissing in it and some nudity. Nothing extreme but I would not recommend this for kids of course and again, if seeing a younger cartoon girl get naked offends you or bothers you, skip this. She is really hundreds of years old and she isn't portrayed in a sexual manner per say, but more or less to make Akira uncomfortable but again, if you don't want to see it, don't watch it.

All in all, I really enjoyed it. I watched it in two days and actually wished it was longer as I did like the story line a lot. Like I said a few times already, this had a lot of potential.

Themes: Violence, Loli, Vampire, Anti-Religion, Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes

Fan-Service: Yes

Censored: No

Anime and Manga has always fascinated me by the use of concepts and perspectives usually avoided or censored by prudent ""Politically and Morally Correct"" types in the Western Regions. Those who have long since forgotten that fiction is a collective and creative realm not limited to one ideal and focus of supposed acceptable fictional genre, but a collective expression made of many authors with different age-groups as their audiences. Fairy-tales were once written with maturity, and Dance in the Vampire Bund is just that fairy-tale with a mature concept involved without the tinkerbell-storylines and artwork. It is not Disney but a story that tells of the struggles of both a Vampire Queen upon the dawn of a New World Order, and the fleeting romance shared between herself and her Wolf Guard.

Overview:

Dance in the Vampire Bund is like one of those more rarer story-lines based on good plot, flashy artwork, and interesting character concepts. The graphics are crisp and done by the same producers SHAFT who did Bakemonogatari. The series kicks off with a questionnaire aired by game-host of humans debating the existence of Vampires true or false. What follows next after a toady encounter with a lowering is the appearance of Main Antagonist Minea Tepes. Minea is the Vampire Queen and she's on the run due a hit-list by clan-members and usurpers alike. From assassination plots and abductions with her guard(s) as protection(Similar to Speed Grapher), Bund has twists turns and action with other supportive characters emerging with substantial roles and backgrounds.

Graphics: 4/5
Very crisp also available in HD or Blu-Ray Format

Sound: 4/5
No grain. Japanese/Dub Subtitles included

Story: 4/5
Bund was put in only 13 episodes so it's shorter, but has one of the better plots instead of the ditzy and dumb ""moe-blob"" themes

Characters: 4/5
Not too many characters that are pointless fillers. Each of them have a role in Minea or Akira's journey good or bad.

Overall:

4/5

As the series progresses the plot gets thicker with an ending begging for a Second Season. To give out anymore would be spoilers, but I would recommend this 13 episode series for anyone into collecting Japanese fictional novels or animated shows. The Manga is still in production and continues from where the show ended.",1350345600,,2548,5.180487804878049

4465484,5,B004TA1GCS,"To be honest, when i first heard of this series I was a little turned off by the reviews & how they kept calling it child porn. When i found it on Netflix last night, I gave it a chance. I loved it, watched the entire series in one sitting & didn't go to sleep until 5:30am. It's nowhere near porn. People kept calling Strike Witches child porn & it really wasn't. I personally, don't mind the nudity but i believe that if those who have issues [with nudity/fan-service] can get past it, then they'll enjoy this anime & realize how great a story this is (just like Strike Witches). Mind you, the show has some anti-religious stuff (what vampire story doesn't?) but nothing too extreme.

Overall, I give this a 5 out of 5 because it's what I prefer.

4465485,3,B004TA1GCS,"I'd seen this title in my local anime store, but had left it on the shelf since it didn't look too good.  Then found out that the North American release was likely to fall victim to the infamous US Kiddy Porn Panic, so decided to shell out USD 16 and find out what the fuss was about.

In passing: it is beyond my understanding why this latest version of the Madness of Crowds should have chosen to target a visual arts genre that has never, in its entire existence, displayed a picture of a real child - or, indeed, of a real anything.  But abnormal psychology is not my forte, so back to the review.

It's not too good.  The palette is very sombre, mostly black, gray and sepia.  No primary colours except a lot of red - blood red, if you get my meaning.  And the animation is poor: many still shots and pan shots, not much fluid motion even in the fight scenes.

The story begins badly.  The mysterious high school, the goofy girls in short skirts, the boys forming rival clubs and bullying each other, ... Oh, and a hero with amnesia who has forgotten he's a werewolf.  Yawn.  But if you persevere, it does improve.  The series is divided into two main arcs: episodes 1 to 7 tell the story of how the Vampire Queen created a save haven for her fellow vampires - the Bund of the title.  The second arc, episodes 8 to 12, is about the rivalry between old vampire families.  It fills in some of the back story, but leaves enough loose ends to suggest a sequel.

Overall, the story is watchable, interesting, and dense enough to repay more than one viewing.  The character development is also well done, and often quite moving.

As other have mentioned, Mira the Vampire Queen is drawn as a young girl.  She has exactly one nude scene - in episode 2 - and there is no visible sexual connotation whatever. A bit of verbal banter about her ""immature body"", but very tame. In fact, most of the scene is a fight scene.  The other nude scene - in episode 11 - involves a female shape-shifting monster, who during a deadly battle with the hero briefly transforms into human form to distract him.

However, there is a lot of graphic violence.  Stabbing, dismemberment, vampire biting, and all with realistically drawn blood.  The local film board gave this anime a PG-13 rating, and I agree.  Not for the younger ones.",1313280000,2,2311,4.424170616113744
4465486,5,B004TA1GCS,"When I really started to get into anime, I thought that Moonphase was one of the best series ever when it came to telling the story about a cute female vampire and the man who is entrusted to protect her. Subsequently I bought the boxed set...

Then I saw Dance in the Vampire Bund and kicked myself for not buying it instead of Moonphase..

I have to say that this anime is a MUST HAVE for ANYONE who is into vampires, whether you like anime or not. Before looking at any other vampire series, I would check thism one out as it has the elegance contained in titles like Vampire Knight and Black Blood Brothers, and yet the stylishness and grit that Karin, Moonphase, and Rosario+Vampire don't even come close to. Mina Tepes exudes %1000 more cute-factor that any other vampire anime heroine I can think of (AND DOESN'T NEED CAT EARS) yet Mina is also brave and intelligent, as opposed to being bumbling and insecure about her vampire ststus. You get the sense from the end of the first episode that she is a leader, and though she acts sweet at times she IS the ruler of the vampires. You will not forget that. This series is not meant to be pretty and cute in the sense that say, Karin or Rosario+Vampire is (it's rated TV-MA), but Mina Tepes really puts an effort into her Lolita style :D In that sense the series is pretty.

 The animation is beautifully crisp, the sound quality is excellent (Dolby Digital HD), and the storytelling alone is enough to give this anime five stars. You will love how vampires and warewolves are related in an unexpected way. Funimation has done well by us anime fans by releasing this title IN BLU-RAY and DVD- great deal :)

SO PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE buy this set before you miss out on something great.",1313193600,2,1745,4.4748427672955975

I watched it as it aired from Japan when it was first released, and then had to wait (rather impatiently I might add) more than a year for it to be dubbed and released in the US.  I have not yet gotten around to reading the manga, though I will at some point.  One of the good things about this is that you don't have to have prior knowledge of the series to enjoy this show.

2) Yes, there it does (at first glance) look to be a story about a relationship between what APPEARS to be a prepubescent girl and an older teen.  LOOKS ARE DECEIVING - especially in this case.  Let me assure you that Mina Tepes is not as young as she chooses to appear.  There is a reason for the facade, and AT NO TIME IS THERE EVER ANY SEXUAL ACTIVITY BETWEEN THEM.  There is however a relationship between a young boy and an older girl.  AGAIN - NO SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

3) Despite the above warnings, I recommend this title for any serious anime fan or any vampire fan...TWILIGHT IT IS NOT.",1312761600,,1146,4.235023041474655
4465488,5,B004TA1GCS,"OK, so I've seen some good reviews and some bad reviews... I'm not sure why there are bad reviews.  OK, there are some parts that some people might find ""offensive"", but if you know anything about this series and are offended by such, then just don't watch it.  For myself, I found this to be a captivating series with amazing animation and a more than just a little solid story line.  What's better is the twists and turns that the story takes as it progresses leaving you wondering who's really good and evil.  No, I don't work for Funimation or any of their affiliates or anything like that, I'm just a guy who happens to like vampires and the stories they are in.  And quite frankly, this is a wonderful story.  Mind you, don't watch it with children around (or anyone who's easily offended for that matter, because this will probably offend) but if you like a great story, great animation, and something that will make you think about it long after you've watched it, then this is for you.",1312502400,3,994,4.4944444444444445
4465489,1,B004TA1GCS,"I purchased this set after reading good reviews and rating.  However, when I watched it, I was really surprised by the sexual innuendo of characters that are suppose to be little CHILDREN.
I love anime and I know most anime and manga have sexual innuendos which does not bother me.  But this is different - I was very disturbed by the child-porn like story line.

I'm going to return this and ask for a refund.",1312416000,9,410,4.44
4465490,5,B004TA1GCS,"I'll assume that most people reading reviews of Dance in the Vampire Bund know that there are hundreds of anime movies and TV shows to watch. Most, in my view, are fine to terrible. This one is easily five stars, with one blemish, which I'll get to in a moment.  The anime revolved around several love stories. First, there is the love between Mina Tepes, Queen of the Vampires, and Akira Kaburagi, who is a high school student at the beginning of the show. Second, there is also the unrequited love that Yuki Saegusa, the human narrator of the story, has for Akira. There is also a side love story between Nanami Shinonome, the school's Student Counsel President and her neighbor, Yuzuru, a boy about 13 years old. The main action sequences revolve an underground organization trying to assassinate Mina and attempts by the male heads of the three ""true blood"" vampire clans to marry Mina and produce an child. Mina wants nothing to do with them as all had a hand in the death of her mother. Thus, she keeps her physical form as a 10 year old girl. Lots of action and great character development. The anime's creators know that a good story requires that the audience develop an attachment to the main characters. Dance with the Vampire Bund does an excellent job. Reading the Amazon.com review makes me wonder if we saw the same anime. There is very little nudity and the lolita aspects of the story are quite mild, compared to other anime. My one complaint is the very first episode. It has no relationship to anything from the manga and adds nothing to the overall story. Even the animation stinks. Why the creators started with this junk is beyond me. If this is your first foray into anime, skip the first episode. The second one is where the real story begins. As you can tell, I loved the series. The anime covers the first 31 chapters in the manga, or 5 volumes of the books. For those who have read the manga, there are several changes in the story line, but I think that they make the overall series as good as the original. To complain that the series is not the same as the manga is, in my view, to complain that The Shining movie does not have the same ending as the book. That may be true, but the move is still great. The same is true for this anime. If they have a second season, I'd be the first in line to watch it. Highly recommended.",1312243200,2,2354,4.423963133640553
4465491,4,B004TA1GCS,"Somewhere between Twilight and Underworld is where I found myself while enjoying, Dance in the Vampire Bund. It's maturity while engaging in several of the series' few action scenes and pre-established hierarchy within this universe resembles that of an Underworld-esque nature and is what should be expected within this domain(So expect gore & nudity). As for the romance element, it resonates that of a soft yet complex love story.

Keep in mind though, Dance in the Vampire Bund, is primarily a Romance and its action elements are less of a focus than the relationship of the two main characters. It is also quite political in nature, being as the premise of this series mainly revolves around the creation of, 'The Vampire Bund' or, a sanctuary where vampires' existences can be acknowledged but, may  remain secluded from mainland. The conflict revolving around this, is that of the prejudice of ""man"" and the resentment of several associated vampire clans, with this choice.

Dance in the Vampire Bund, is a good series within its genre but, sadly stumbles where most Anime has before, in establishing a conclusion to its series/season.",1311552000,3,1142,5.096256684491979
4465492,3,B004TA1GCS,"Well first off. I am a fan of the manga series. (Therefore, I may be bias even if its not intended)

The series starts off weak. The first episode i consider to be a complete waste of time. It pretty much a show within a show trying to debate the existence of vampires. Its not needed to understand the show at all. The second episode is when things starts off more or less, the main hero has no memory of his past,(everything that happen 1 or two years ago due to a mission gone wrong). The reason relieved later on why he lost his memory is because he blocked out one event. So this one event lead him to not being able to remember 16 years worth of his life? (your discover this part if you watch it near the end episodes). Its nice to see various reference to the manga in the series. The middle set of episodes were entertaining in their own right. it felt like this this series(even though having a different story line than the manga) could do somewhere. However, the ending set of episodes, how it explains the stuff at the start and its final conclusion felt a bit cheesy and feels more like an after thought. Also the final end guy who is fought at the end felt like it was rip from Saturday morning cartoons. These set of ending episodes just leaves a bad taste.

In all: If they removed the final episodes or changed them. I would of enjoyed this series alot better.

Recommendation: Rental or just pass it.

4465493,4,B004TA1GCS,"This series is absolutely incredible. Though the anime does seem a bit rushed, it knows how to grab your attention and draw you into a watching spree. Many are saying the dub is terrible, but in my own opinion it is really well done. The only reason why i give 4 stars, is the factor in the blu ray. Occasionally you see the glowing factor in certain scenes. It's subtle but still noticeable. All in all the series is a 5/5, blu ray 4/5, Thus the reason behind the 4.",1310169600,,467,4.2

4465495,4,B004TA1GCS,"This is one of those anime's that covers a lot of age groups in its writing.  In many ways it is not a very warm and fuzzy series.  Simply put she is trying to build a power base, the reasoning is as old as time.  I don't think many kids or young teens will yet understand what the underling plot really is beyond the fighting a light love story.  You start off thinking the lolita thing is fan service but its pivotal to the series that a century plus old vampire looks physically immature...

In short look beyond the lolita thing.  Once the plot starts rolling along there series drops into gear and becomes a very good vampire series.",1309305600,,638,4.319327731092437
4465496,5,B004TA1GCS,"First off, I am female, though the name may suggest otherise XD Second, I am utterly in love with this series. It is heartfelt, beautiful, and witty, just like the main hero and heroine themselves. Now, anyone who says 'Oh, this is just child porn etc... etc...' is only seeing what they want to see. There is absolutely no sex with little kids in this. Sure, there's nudity but only a prude is offended by that. Now, those who have seen this will get on my case for the whole 'no sex with little kids' statement because of the character of Yuzuru but if you watch it you'll see how there is not any actual sex, just an age difference. The plot of the anime varries slightly from the manga but generally follows it very closely after the beginning. If you're looking for a sexy well-rounded series 'Dance in the Vampire Bund' is a must! Both the anime and the manga!!!!",1309305600,29,869,4.403726708074534

While this won't go down in anime history like a chobits, fruits basket, bleach etc it is certainly in the upper tier and well worth the purchase.",1308700800,,435,4.662337662337662

many may be turned of by the fact that this anime is a loli yes this may be true but mina is much older then shes appears to be and with out spoling to much she chooses to stay in that body form so with the hole loli part explained  lets continued

when you order the limited edition you get both the blu ray and dvds in a nice collectibal card board case witch is done nicely

also hide any tweens for there world will be shattered when these vampires fail to sparkle like a popular fairy know as edward

special features are standard here clean op/ed a few trailers and the intermissions

4465500,5,B004TA1GCS,"I like all vampire stories, so I would not miss this one. Starting from Bram Stoker's dracula, they always fascinated me. Like all other reviewers said, this is definitely mature adults only anime. Apart from the loli parts everybody mentioned, it's a vampire story so of course it contains nudity, sex, blood etc. The blurays are unedited unlike the online videos which are available from funimation website. There are no shiny lines in the video to avoid some scenes (which exist in the online ones). I got the dvd/bluray one with the box, which has very nice drawings of Mina and Akira each side. Looks like they felt the need to hide the Akira side since it arrived with a sticker covering the whole thing outside the plastic wrap. Each dvd case also has a great drawing put inside. I really admire the drawings in this anime, however, story is very different from the manga at some parts. Also, manga still continues and if you like the story in anime, I definitely suggest you read the manga too.",1308614400,2,1002,4.634831460674158

4465502,5,B004TA1GCS,"The anime on blu-ray is stunning and very crisp for an anime. The details are impressive and the voice acting is very good. Some voices seem a bit botched but those characters only have brief screen time. The voice-over's are very intense and help the story flow.

The DVD has a lower resolution than the blu-ray, which is to be expected. The sound quality is just as good and the picture is quality is very good too. You will find some spots where it is blurrier than the blu-ray, but its brief, usually. Overall, the quality suffers very little for a DVD and is a good alternative to the blu-ray if you can't afford the blu-ray or don't have a blu-ray player.

This anime itself I would rate 4 3/4 out of 5. 1/4 off only if you compare it to the manga only in length. With 12 episodes, it covers the first few volumes. However, there is more to discover with the manga. The anime is still worth watching as it gives some subtle differences while some major differences.

Be warned, there is a reason why there is a  MA rating for the anime. All those with sensitive ideology should not watch it due to the various differences in culture and what is considered acceptable to the general public, namely the loli aspect and levels of fan service of this anime.",1308441600,2,1259,4.413793103448276

A blu-ray/DVD combo for the price of $33.99; perfect for those that have a blu-ray player or not.  Hard case looks very durable as said. Two cases: one for DVD and the other for blu-ray. As shown in their picture of the product.

*2-disk for each. Blu-ray holds 8 episode on one and 4 on the other while the DVD version holds 6 episodes in each.  This is the blu-ray one; looks the same inside the DVD case.
