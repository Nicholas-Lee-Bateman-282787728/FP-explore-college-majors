4665566,4,B005EKWZD6,"C.O.P.S. is finally completed on DVD and at a great price.  Mill Creek's C.O.P.S. Volume 2 features the last 33 episodes of the series (22 of which have never been on DVD before).  This is a three disc set with 11 episodes per disc.  Despite the large number of episodes per disc, the episodes I have watched so far appear to be in good shape.  As with most Mill Creek releases, the discs come in paper sleeves inside the case.  I'd rather pay a little extra and have it come in a better case, though.  The only extras, which are on disc 1, are a few C.O.P.S. artwork slides and a trailer for Jayce & the Wheeled Warriors Volume 1 which Mill Creek is releasing in 2012.  It would have been nice if they had included as an extra all the C.O.P.S. for Kids Public Service Announcements (a few of which were on Shout! Factory's Volume 1 set).

This set has some of my more favorite episodes, such as the two episodes that deal with Mace & Nightshade's romance and ""The Case of the Lowest Crime"" anti-drug episode.  You also see more of the Wave 2 toy characters making appearances such as Airwave, Nightstick, and Koo Koo.  I've really enjoyed watching these episodes.  This set is definitely worth getting.",1316390400,10,1203,4.447488584474886

4665584,4,B005EKWZD6,"As a kid I was only able to catch this show periodically when visiting relatives.  It is a good solid cartoon of the late 80's.  It is a somewhat cheesy cartoon so you know what you are getting in that respect.  I have enjoyed it very much.

The case is a complete let down.  It is a single post dvd case so the three discs stack on top of each other.  Due to being on the post there is no way for the discs to be locked into place so they are able to spin around.  It is disappointing that a little more money wasn't spent on a better case that would protect the discs better from damage.",1398124800,,589,3.940677966101695

4665589,5,B005EKWZD6,"child hood flashbacks galore... still a few episodes to go... minimal issues, due more to Mill Creek or their sources than anything",1379894400,,131,5.0
4665590,5,B005EKWZD6,"Despite being a cartoon made to sell toys, the quality of the writing isn't preachy (that's what PSA's are for), the music remains catchy, and the animation is still smooth. We may not have the fondest memories of Carl Macek, Haim Saban, and Shuki Levy, but they have made some great collaborations and C.O.P.S. is one of them.

C.O.P.S. is a 20 year-old show about quirky law officers and the hilariously inept crooks they chase. It's still captivating watching the ego of Highway and Mace clash on patrol, or figuring out how Berserko will fool his uncle Big Boss' newest fool-proof scheme. Some great episodes include the high-octane two-part pilot episodes, the Case of the Midas Touch that focuses on always-in-the-background Squeaky Clean, the Case of the Brilliant Berserko inverts the regular cast of fools, the Runaway Buzzbomb tells the tales of hapless sidekick Buzzbomb, the standard 90s anti-drug episode the Lowest Crime, and my favorite, the Case of Big Boss's Bye Bye where each character gets a minute of genre gags (B.P. Vess takes a crack at detective noire).

The packaging is pretty bare bones (a DVD-box with a pocket to store the in-paper-sleeves DVDs), with no subtitles or CC stream, and don't expect remasters of the picture quality -- in fact, expect some de-synced audio form time to time. Add to the fact the Cookie Jar editions have almost no extras compared to the first set released by Shout Factory puts this collection in a bad light.

BUT you only have to buy two sets from Cookie Jar instead of three (and Shout is still unsure of releasing the 3rd as of 2013). Getting the entire series of 60+ episodes (almost 24 hours of programming), nostalgia or not, for under US$20 is a very good deal.",1379289600,,1728,4.791946308724833

C.O.P.S. I brought both Volume 1 and 2 knowing that there was going to be video degradation. Well, with basically about 11 episodes per disk(except for the 1st disks of Vol. 1 and 2 which contains previews or a full episode of other series)the video quality is very poor. It looks like a blurry vhs tranfer of  medium quality(even if some sharpening filter was used it looks bad even on my crt)and it looks like the picture sways left to right. I do not know if they used the best sources available but I will be more careful next time with Mill Creek and Cookie Jar products. I know alot of 1970s and 1980s video series were shot mostly with poor video sources so I took a chance. By comparison: [ASIN: B004DTU2X4 He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Complete First Season] also by Mill Creek with  approx. 10 episodes per dvd except disk 7 and extras disk 8, had ""better quality"" video.",1338336000,,1125,5.175824175824176

This cartoon was one that aired on tv when i was growing up in the 80's. I never got to watch much of this series and when i think back i believe it was because it came on in an awkward time slot. Afterall, there were tons of cartoons back then. This cartoon is about futuristic cops fighting crime in a future world.

4665605,5,B005EKWZD6,"I have got to say I haven't had so much fun since I saw these in the 80's. They haven't lost their appeal or charm.  I wanted to purcahse these sets for a long time. The former distributor had them for $24.99 each. At Cookie Jar's low price I obtained them both for around $10.00!  It's a bargain to say the least.  If you don't care about extras and original commericals, this is a decent set. There are those who are turned off by the discs being in little sleeves. I for one am not because they are still in a protected format to preserve the disks from damage.

If I remember correctly C.O.p. S. stands for Central Office of Police Specialists or Cyber-Cops. It was a great show for it's time. I do remember for a short time they had a toy line.  Every officer had a code name like G.I.Joe:The Animated Series. There was Bulletproof, Mainframe and a host of others.  If you like old time 80's cartoons, you can't go wrong with this inexpensive collection. Too bad it only lasted a year.  It was just as good as many of the classic cartoons of the time.",1326499200,,1056,4.276381909547739

4665607,4,B005EKWZD6,"I was so excited when I finally heard the last of the episodes of C.O.P.S. was finally going to be on DVD. This show really takes me back. I find it ironic that while they limited the violence such as punches, kicks and anything traumatic to the series, they never showed any reluctance by putting out a toy line that let kids use potentially dangerous, smelly firing caps, that if you're not careful you could catch your hand or finger, and of course that little homage to A CHRISTMAS STORY, you know the one.
