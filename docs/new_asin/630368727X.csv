It's basically a good guy /bad guy movie !if you like Tom Sellec , you might enjoy this made for cable movie produced by Turner  Enterainment(in other words TNT! ).

I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes legal ""thrillers""--this was not exactly a thriller but it did work in such a way as to let you see the process. I was nervous, throughout, though, as to how it would work out. Very satisfying movie. And Tom Selleck is- well- ALWAYS fun to watch. He was very good in this,  as was Marsha Mason.
Very good movie. I am glad I added it to my collection.",1490572800,,470,4.222222222222222

702594,5,630368727X,"Gripping and thought-provoking. Unusual for Hollywood - if it was Hollywood.  I watched it twice, back-to-back. Those ubiquitous shoot-em-up car-flipping chase scenes get so wearisome, but were thankfully kept in check in Broken Trust.  Will Hollywood ever learn that some of us don't appreciate being spoon-fed?  That we appreciate being left to figure out some things for ourselves?  They would do well to wonder why more and more Americans are tuning in to British productions.  (And it's not because we enjoy deciphering the accents and idioms!)  I'd watch this again in a heartbeat.",1482192000,6,587,5.258064516129032

702946,2,630368727X,Not much of a plot to keep you interested more than 30 minutes. You get the impression that Selleck is playing the part and not really into the character. The rest of the characters are somewhere out in the fringes and mimicking the lines they were told to memorize. On the whole a very disappointing two hours that leaves you wondering why you invested the time at all.,1454198400,,370,4.455882352941177

I was disappointed in this movie. it seemed to go nowhere and I was having a tough time trying
to get into it. maybe it was me but being a tom selleck fan this movie came up short. in my opinion.
Tom Selleck has made some decent flicks from Quigley Down Under to my personal favorite
An Innocent Man. His Jesse Stone movies were watchable but Broken Trust left  me dissatisfied.

much better especially since the last decade or more the crap Hollyweird seems to spew out! This is well written directed and acted.

Overall it was convoluted.  Unfortunate with the top level cast.  Maybe with another 30 minutes the characters could have been developed so it was cohesive.

704032,1,630368727X,"To sum up my evaluation of this item: Disjointed nonsense. I like Tom Selleck in his many roles (Westerns, Blue Bloods, Jesse Stone). This film is the very opposite of what I am used to. All other Tom Selleck movies are well done and deserve to be watched several times. After atching ""Broken Trust"", I immededly listed the item for sale at a sales price below market level. There have been no takers yet which tells me that the word gets around as to how bad this film is.",1407283200,,473,4.325842696629214
704178,4,630368727X,As a long time fan of Tom Selleck I was slightly disapointed in this film. The writers apparently tried to portray him as a gullible tool for the investigators interests which of course he realizes at the end.  All in all though an interesting study of the legal profession.,1404000000,,274,4.591836734693878

704183,2,630368727X,"I like Tom Selleck  very much. but this movie was not the quality of his Jesse Stone series, for instance.  If you watch Blue Bloods on TV you'll like that show as well.
This movie was pretty flimsy.",1389916800,5,199,4.2105263157894735

704186,5,630368727X,This is a very good movie. It had me riveted from beginning to end. Lots of drama and a couple of good twists to keep you guessing. Tom Selleck did an excellent job as an honest judge with integrity trying to do his job in a corrupt system. It had the feel of a big screen movie instead of a made for tv movie. I highly recommend it.,1285372800,2,333,3.911764705882353
704187,4,630368727X,"Three things make this average made-for-TV movie watchable: A very able cast, a nice web of evil and paranoia that is spun around the central character and serves up a couple of ""plot twists"" towards the end, and for the ladies in the audience, Tom Selleck has never looked finer.
With a script by Joan Didion and Gregory Dunne from William Wood's novel ""Court of Honor"", it's about a squeaky clean judge that gets snared by the Justice Department into doing a sting operation for them, to catch the others on the bench that are on the take, and finds himself knee deep in the slime of courtroom intrigue and paybacks.

The plot is somewhat predictable, but it's entertaining, largely held together by the actors; Tom Selleck is excellent and has the serious demeanor and screen presence to carry off the part of Judge Nash, Elizabeth McGovern and William Atherton are the feds from hell, Marsha Mason does a good turn as a judge, and Fritz Weaver plays Selleck's father.
Courtroom fans will find this enjoyable, Selleck fans will drool, and with its plot twists and turns, it certainly makes a worthwhile rental.
Total running time is 97 minutes.",1103068800,44,1147,4.763819095477387

7852741,2,630368727X,"I purchased this as a Tom Selleck fan, and having read lots of stellar reviews at Amazon.  I like Tom Selleck in all sorts of roles, not just Magnum P.I., but I was very disappointed in this glum t.v. movie.  The primary acting was fine (and Marsha Mason did a great job portraying her character drunk), but some of the subsidiary acting was kind of bad.  Mostly, though, it was the gloomy and illogical story that was at fault.  I couldn't understand Selleck's judge's motivation for getting involved in the sting, nor did I find the blackmailing that kept him involved to be a sufficient motivation.  In fact, lots of behavior from various characters really didn't make much sense.  The climactic scene between Selleck and Mason, for example, was simply bizarre.  Worst of all, the story is joyless and dispiriting.  I advise sticking with ""Magnum"" and Selleck's fine westerns.",1518048000,,879,4.852348993288591
