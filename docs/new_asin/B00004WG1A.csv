7925146,5,B00004WG1A,"I'm a big fan of the entire ""Ultimate Guide"" series, and this is the one that started them out.  Another example of The Discovery Channel doing what it does best.  This video goes to great lengths to explain the diversity, anatomy and ecology of the sharks.  It does an excellent job of dispelling many common misconceptions about sharks and giving us the straight info.  It marries the latest science, video and computer technology (in 1996) to provide an neat, informative product.  Some of the shots, the astute observer might notice, are contrived.  The Discovery Channel has habit of letting you think an aquarium shot was in the open sea, or a animal that was baited in just happened to show up on the last day of filming.  Does this detract from the educational quality of the video?  Certainly not.  It is for the dramatic effect that we have come to expect and keeps us watching.",1003968000,2,888,4.67741935483871
7925147,5,B00004WG1A,"This is one of the greatest National Geopraphic Videos Ive seen, specifically because of the rare futage found throughout it. The rarest is footage of the goblin shark, which I give the video 50 stars up itself, (If it were possible), because for one, it is my favorite sea creature, and for two, the goblin is one of the rarest sharks, possibly the rarest! Another rare sight is the very first footage of a live Greenland shark swimming around the camera. Although the one thing that I didn't enjoy too much was the way they made the video look as if you were accessing a computer at times, but other than that, Great video for People of all ages, and astonishes kids greatly! Add this to your video library for sure!",987811200,7,718,4.488549618320611
