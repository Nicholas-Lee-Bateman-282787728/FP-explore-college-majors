7950598,2,B00005QJIR,"The original Mr. Vampire is an absolute classic! Lam Ching Ying is iconic in his role as the one-eyebrowed priest. This movie features a bunch of the original cast but fails to capture any of the charm the original had. Even without comparing it to the original, this one fails to be entertaining on its own. A complete disappointment overall if you like Chinese hopping vampire films.

I got this mixed up with Mr. Vampire 1992 and was excited when I saw it available for streaming. This was an obvious attempt to cash in on Mr. Vampire's popularity before any sequels were released. As a fan of this genre, I can only recommend it for completists. I can't say this was as bad as Robo Vampire though!",1478563200,,701,4.519685039370079
7950599,5,B00005QJIR,"Oh my gosh what can i say this movie is the best chop sockie i have seen in a long time.  This is why a gave it 5 stars , it is funny and action packed along with some of the best Chinese actors i have seen . So if your looking for something different  this may be it because it hits your funny bone all the way.",1477094400,,312,3.573529411764706
7950600,3,B00005QJIR,"The success of 1985's MR. VAMPIRE led to a number of spin-offs and imitations, but none were more blatant than 1987's NEW MR. VAMPIRE, which is entirely detached from the original series. NEW MR. VAMPIRE follows Master Chin and his apprentice as they off to bury the corpse of a local business man after he has been attacked by a vampire. Meanwhile, Chin's rival attempts to sabotage their ritual by bringing the corpse back to life to cause mischief and mayhem for the two vampire hunters. Although NEW MR. VAMPIRE lacks the strong direction of Ricky Lau, it is still an entirely enjoyable film in its own right. Liang Hua Liu aims for pure silliness the whole time through, and gets it thanks to a number of entertaining performances from the entire cast. Fat Chung's self-absorbed lead is no match for the great Lam Ching-Ying's one-eyebrow priest, but Pauline Wong Siu Fung is fantastic as the restless spirit that must mimic Chin Siu Ho's every move exactly. The choreography and stuntwork are fantastic during their physical comedy routines. Expect more of the same zany comedy and off-the-wall action as Master Chin and the gang battle the undead, even if the vampires refuse to 'hop' in this entry. NEW MR. VAMPIRE provides plenty of stupid, mindless fun for Hong Kong Horror fans!

7950601,3,B00005QJIR,"Compared to the first ""Mr. Vampire,"" ""Spooky Encounters"" and other Hong Kong comedy-horror films of the mid-'80s, this one is second-rate. It isn't that funny, and the only attempt to create any real monsters is a couple of 'vampires' that don't hop (one reviewer says they hop in the other films as the ground hurts their feet, but attributing the hopping to rigor mortis is a much more logical reason) despite having the appearance of the typical vampire/corpse of these films.

The secondary plot of the dead concubine of a clunky general coming back to life only to imitate every move of the guy who robbed her grave really isn't funny. I'm sure it was difficult to film as well as it was, but it just doesn't provide laughs. Not to mention that part of the plot is left hanging at the end without any resolution.

Maybe worth seeing once, but not worth owning.",1330560000,,865,4.6103896103896105
7950602,3,B00005QJIR,"Technically, ""New Mr. Vampire"" is not part of the ""Mr. Vampire"" series of comic/martial arts/horror movies.

Sure, it has the gross-looking zombies, inept military and bumbling ghost hunters. But it doesn't star Ching-Ying Lam and it doesn't really connect to the other ""Mr. Vampire"" movies. But it is a moderately entertaining horror/comedy with some funny subplots and wacky acting.

The movie opens with an inept grave robber setting loose a vampire, which reignites the feud between Master Chin (Chung Fat) and his old schoolmate Wu (Chin Yuet-sang), rival ghost hunters who also live across the street. Both are called in by a local gangster for the honor of burying his dead brother, and Chin's more stylish and sensitive approach gets him the job.

Unfortunately, Wu turns the corpse into a vampire along the way, as Chin and his apprentice try to deal with the same graverobber, who is being followed by a pretty zombie. To make matters worse, the zombie is the former girlfriend of a local dictator, and Wu enhances the vampire's strength -- and causes it to only attack Chin.

""New Mr. Vampire"" is pretty typical of the many ""hopping vampire"" movies that followed ""Mr. Vampire,"" although the vampires in here don't hop (they stagger or run). Basically it's not particularly excellent in any way, but it is entertaining in a run-around-screaming-with-a-rotted-vampire-running-after-you manner.

The plot tends to lag in places, and the dialogue is pretty tepid, without any really memorable one-liners. The comedy is mostly provided by the absurdist fights with the vampire, and the pretty zombie who is bound to mimic the graverobber's every move -- which makes slow-dancing with her still-living boyfriend an interesting experience.

Chung Fat is no Ching-Ying Lam, but he is a pretty entertaining vampire hunter who uses too much hair gel, but is still infinitely smarter than his slimy rival. His sidekick is pretty useless, and I suspect he was put in just for infodumping. And there's a dual performance stolen by Pauline Wong and Siu-hou Chin, who have to do the same expressions and motions all the time -- even in the bathroom, which makes things awkward.

""New Mr. Vampire"" is pretty typical of the cash-in ""hopping vampires"" genre, but is still fairly entertaining in a forgettable kind of way.",1154476800,,2314,5.089709762532982
7950603,4,B00005QJIR,"I've recently stumbled into the genre of Kung Fu vampire flicks and found New Mr. Vampire to be quite entertaining.
The story centers around a Ghost Chaser, his student, and a grave robber. The story begins when the ghost chaser and his studnet accept a job of burying a dead ganster in his home town.  Along the way they pick up the grave robber who has a number nine concubine zombie girl chasing him.  She follows him and does exactly what the grave robber does due to the fact that she's bound to him.  Behind the scenes a rival ghost chaser revives the dead ganster and turns him into a vampire.  The story progresses and lends itself to several humourous situations.  Particularly between the grave robber and his mimicing ghost played by Pauline Wong.  I also agree that she does an excellent job of shadowing the grave robber, and adds a lot of light hearted moments to the film.
The story is really a comedy and should be viewed as such.  Although there is some Kung Fu in the movie, it's not the focus of the film.  There's also an audio commentary by Ric Meyers included on the DVD version which explains a little bit about the orgin of Chinese Vampires. He does point out that the Vampires don't hop like they do in the original Mr. Vampire, and Spooky Encouters by Sammo Hung, but that didn't really bother me.  The U.S. has potrayed vampires many different ways, so I don't see a problem with different Hong Kong versions.
If your curious about New Mr. Vampire and want a good laugh, give it a try.  I think you'll enjoy it. Escpecially around Halloween.  Oh, and it is a tad bit scary too.  Just a tad.",1031875200,5,1617,4.444067796610169
7950604,4,B00005QJIR,"""New Mr. Vampire"" is a pretty solid Chinese Vampire comedy, though
it's not really part of the ""Mr. Vampire"" series. It doesn' star Lam
Ching Ying, for starters, despite being made about a year after the
original Mr. Vampire.
Also, the vampires don't hop. That may sound
like a weird complaint if you've never seen any Mr. Vampire movies,
but since the whole Chinese vampire genre is often called ""hopping
vampire"" movies, it is something I really miss. (In case you're
wondering, Chinese vampires hop because the ground hurts their feet
when they walk).
Such niggling complaints aside, though, ""New
Mr. Vampire"" is a very funny movie. The plot is not terribly deep or
complex, but the walking corpses provide a steady stream of excellent
slapstick.
Pauline Wong Siu Fung in particular is outstanding as a
corpse whose essence becomes tied to a grave robber's, such that she
moves exactly the way he does. Her ability to mimic his movements is
amazing.
The action scenes are also quite well done, striking a good
balance of comedy and kung fu butt kicking.
My major complaint about
this DVD is that it does not have a Chinese language soundtrack, and
the dubbing is done with those typical cartoonish bad Kung Fu movie
voices. When is Tai Seng going to realize that they don't have to get
rid of the Chinese audio track when they dub something? Subtitling is
cheap, especially since they've previously released a subtitled
version of this movie.
The English language commentary on this DVD
is OK, though it was geared toward someone who had no idea what they
were watching. The DVD transfer quality is decent, though again,
nothing very exciting.",1015113600,11,1646,4.840425531914893
