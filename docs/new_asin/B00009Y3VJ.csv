The director Yoshiyuki Tomino, is better known the creation of the Gundam Series amongst a long list of other accomplishments.
This series was originally began in Japan around 1983, so the animation has a clasical look, and it reminds me alot of Anime that came out in the 80's.  I am glad to see that this series finally made it over to the US.  I had read numerous review about the release in Japan, I have a thing about watching amime with subtitles, for the most part I just will wait for the English translation to be released.  Thank god for ADV for releasing this in the US.
I highly recomend this series to any fan of Gundam, Robotech, or Escaflowne.  Though the story is a little slow developing at first, by the time you get to the 3rd or 4th Volume you will be hooked.",1076025600,2,1056,4.308080808080808
