525355,4,6302968062,"Peter Paul and David Paul made their Big Screen debut in this action and comedy filled epic.  If you like Flashing Swords, scantilly clad women, bulging muscles, decapitations, black magic, and a cast of characters that  can only be found in the days of the Barbarian, then this movie will be  just the thing to satisfy your appetite.  The Barbarian Brothers are fun to  watch, fun to laugh with, laugh at, and in the end, you will be cheering  them on. You want to see sword fights, Dragons, and Good vs Evil; then your  gonna love this movie.  And when your ready for more of the Barbarian  Brothers, make sure to check out Peter and David in Twin Sitters, and  Double Trouble.",949881600,4,679,4.491803278688525
525356,4,6302968062,"The film is one of the greats in the spoof genre.  It combines all the shockingly bad elements of a run of the mill fantasy (sfx, dialogue etc) with dubious plotline and terrible acting. Gor and Cutchik (our heros) are  a pair of West Coast accented Barbarian brothers, whom in a violence led  plotline, perform the most unlikely feats of strength , in order to keep  such lovelies as the animatronic werewolf from killing you with laughter.  The story is appalling, and that's the whole point. Revel in this drivel,  and you'll find it's very worthlessness uplifting.",928713600,,568,4.804123711340206
525387,1,6302968062,Looked for this movie for awhile.  Happy to have found it and received it. But not in English so it was pointless to have wasted time and  money on it.,1366934400,,151,4.0
525388,5,6302968062,"for another experience this is a nicely made movie, good ending
For old times with swords, magic and baubles etc., flavor with popcorn and sword fodder",1362441600,,151,4.846153846153846
525389,1,6302968062,Thought it was in English turns out its in Italian. :( so of course we couldn't watch it. Next time I need to read the info better.,1350950400,,131,3.888888888888889
525390,4,6302968062,My wife wanted this so bad since she laughed so hard the first time she watched it. We have since transfered the info to a DVD to save the VHS quality.,1307836800,,151,3.903225806451613
525391,3,6302968062,"i never actually had heard of this film until i came across reviews of it on the net, then i had to get a copy! I am a fan of films such as hawk the slayer, conan, beastmaster, scorpion king and redsonja etc., and if you liked those, you'll like Barbarians! Michael berryman is excellent as the villan and his scorceress is a bit of allright too! The twins are entertaining, but eva la rue steals the show. (nice bellybutton!) the one thing that lets the film  down is the poorly animated dragon creature- time for the c.g.i. Remake?  not one of the most intellectual of films either, but what do you expect?",1273536000,,608,4.371681415929204

525395,4,6302968062,"I absolutely loved this movie growing up in the 1980s. While it hasn't aged as well as, say, Conan, it is still a lot of fun to watch. The barbarian brothers  have a great, refreshing, open-hearted joy for life that is always a welcome relief from the rigors of modern sickly civilization. Sure, it is a dumb fairy story involving giant, steroid-bloated hulks (they are and remain incredibly strong and fit guys, whatever their juice habits may be) waddling around and waving chunks of metal at each other while in their fur gachies. But, darn it, they're having so much fun with it, you can't help but have fun right along with them. If a man dislikes the performance of Peter and David Paul, he must dislike life; for that is what they are: great, giant, hulking, good-natured living men! I mean, the facial expressions! The bon mots! They're wonderful!

It is a darn shame that this is not available on DVD.",1175558400,4,910,4.611111111111111
525396,4,6302968062,"I remember watching this movie when it first came out and thought it to be one of the best movies I have seen. I still have the same opinion. The action is great and so are the brothers. They make the film work with there bumbling ways :-) It is a shame I have not found it on DVD or even if they have made it on DVD yet. Once it does, this is/will be a must have DVD.",1169596800,3,368,3.670886075949367
525417,5,6302968062,"I am so happy to hear that I am not insane and other people like this movie as well. This was my favorite movie growing up and still is in my personal top ten! It is a hilarious movie about two barely audible barbarians who fall into the classic fantasy adventure! Being a huge fantasy fan I must say that if you have not seen it, it is deffinately worth the time to watch. I promise you will not regret it!!!",1068681600,17,409,4.061728395061729
525418,5,6302968062,"This movie, when I was a kid was the best movie Ive ever seen. I still rememeber the whole movie from beginging to end. It gave me inspiration for my fantasy art that I do today. I would tell anyone who loves scifi or frazzeta art would love this cult classic. Reminds of great memories of being a kid.",1043625600,11,302,4.135593220338983
525419,5,6302968062,"I have too many copies of this classic, perhaps my FAVORITE, Sword and Sorcery movie that have deteriorated due to over-use.  If one movie  were to ever wish be realeased on DVD...it would be this...probably on a double disc with Think Big...The Barbarian brothers are my heroes...",1039910400,17,281,4.957446808510638
525420,1,6302968062,"... from an age of ripped jeans, cropped sweatshirts, high-top Reeboks and feathered hair... when inarticulate body builders made movies celebrating inadvertant homoerotica... comes this sword-and-sandal epic adventure about two brothers captured by evil men and raised to fight as gladiators.  Somehow, the film's producers were competent enough to hire two sets of twins to play the brothers, as children and as adults.  That seems to have strained everyone's moviemaking capacities to the breaking point.

Eventually, the backstory borrowed from ""Conan the Barbarian"" (but twice as good, because there are two Conans!) gives way to some sort of slapdash plot about a magical belly stone, and a lot of oily people named Lemone and Canary and Kadar and Zibbidy-zoh and Flappity Jackson (okay, I made that last one up) do oily things to each other while extras in rags stumble around.  Then someone pulls a sword, like people often do when their feelings get hurt.  At that point, the screaming starts, which startles you... until you realize it's you who's screaming and you turn this off immediately.

""The Barbarians.""  Named for its stars, David and Peter Paul, also in ""DC Cab"" and the truck-driving comedy adventure ""Think Big.""  Quite a filmography.",1023408000,4,1256,5.213930348258707
525421,5,6302968062,"Campy, action packed and hilarious - a D&D game on steroids! My wife, friends and I have this movie playing in the background every morning before we hit the Renaissance Faire. It really puts us in meade & BBQ turkey leg partying frame of mind.
In 15 years, we've gone through 5 copies on VHS and are in dire need of a more resilient playing medium. This movie belongs on DVD... PLEASE!!!",1020556800,6,388,4.402777777777778
525422,4,6302968062,If u need to see big muscles with good moving and real fighting view this movie which Peter and David Paul make it so nice and cool action.,1015977600,3,139,4.0
525423,5,6302968062,"If you consider yourself a fan of the ""barbarian"" genre of movies then movie will fill your heart with glee.  Destined to be a cult classic!",1006214400,4,140,4.384615384615385
525424,5,6302968062,"It was around 1988, I was 12 years old and returned from the video shop with my best mate Dave clutching this absolute classic. It was a toss up between 'The Barbarians' and the latest Van Damme movie, thank you fickle fate for guiding my young hand. It's got it all, big muscley warriors, girls in fur bikinis, sword-fights, fist-fights, gladiator-fights (to a 12 year boy fighting is very important), a magical belly stone and top quality bad dialogue. The best bit is when the brothers get hanged but escape by - wait for it - bursting the nooses by tensing their neck muscles! Dave's Mum had to come in to stop the cheering!  I thought this movie was lost to me forever but now I've tracked it down I will be handing over my dollars with a mile wide grin on my face. This is a must-see, must-own, amazing movie.",984787200,4,815,4.397350993377484
525425,5,6302968062,"a movie that possess such an amalgam of all the best elements; fine actors (not even worhty of a swarzenegger one liner, these guys have a grunt that sounds like a mix between a lawn mower and a tuba as their trademark), a  script with about 8 pages of dialogue, and a plot that doesnt make sense to  the drunken hippie who wrote it on his napkin gets 5 stars in my book.  the  big monster is a stiff piece of cardboard who dies in 1 minute, the fight  scenes consist of plastic toy-like coreography, and the dialogue explains  away holes in the plot through such gems as: ""how'd the horses get  here"" -""they knew we'd be here by instinct""  all in all if  you enjoy seeing how terrible movies can get, and you don't want to watch  your little cousins public access show,by all means buy barbarians.",961459200,5,798,4.331081081081081
525426,5,6302968062,"This might not be THE worst movie ever, but it's definitely one of the worst in the past few decades.  If you're a fan of campy schlock like I am, you won't be able to find a movie with worse acting, dialogue or premise.  It is hilarious from the start, and only gets more unbelievably bad.  With  a plot revolving around the ""Ruby of Life"" and the incredibly  phallic ""bog dragon,"" you know it's got to be good!  ANd to top  it off, there are lines like ""Hey!  What are you doing with my  face?""",953424000,4,496,4.136842105263158
