8601926,5,B004DF2I76,"This DVD covers a wide variety of topics with a main focus on the wisdom of the Mayan people. The Mayan Calendar as we all know talks of a 2012 'end date' and has brought a lot of curiosity and speculation as to its true meaning. This video comprehensively explores that, and also touches on many other related subjects. While some of the information may be arguable, I think it is a great start for any beginners looking to explore the deeper meanings and progression of time and space in our 3rd dimensional experience as Humans. The music is great, the information is thought provoking and well presented, and I think anybody looking for insight into these unfolding events would appreciate checking this out.

8601927,5,B004DF2I76,I loved it.  It gives an alternative look at the mayan calendar and the 2012 end date. I was surprised with the amount of new information that was positive about the future.  I loved the Hun ab Ku section and the use of the galaxies and references to Bible scripture.  The Bull Whip was a great section and can see consciousness in action effecting change.  A must see for everyone who wants positive change for 2012 and beyond.  Yes God has a plan and everyone is a player in that Plan.  Loved the music.  Good job.,1290556800,,516,4.3125
