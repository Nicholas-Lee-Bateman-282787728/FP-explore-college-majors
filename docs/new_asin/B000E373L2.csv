8104863,5,B000E373L2,"Love seeing these on dvd finally!  Amazon,  please release in season sets! My only complaint is 13 bucks is pretty expensive for only 2 episodes!",1441065600,,145,4.76
8104864,5,B000E373L2,"This movie was really fun to watch.  It was about a murder/suicide and how Poirot, Inspector Japp, and Captain Hastings have to find out who did it, or if it truly was suicide.  I (in general) like to watch mysteries and murder mysteries, so that's partially why I liked it.  I think Agatha Christie's books are great mysteries in general, so I definitely recommend this to you if you like mystery.",1437350400,,398,4.577464788732394
8104865,4,B000E373L2,"This videotape has the infamous Honeymooners story without an ending, ""Stand In For Murder"" (Length: 40:37; April 17, 1954).  The problem was that the studio office got so hysterical the show ended before the skit.  It seems Ralph is a dead ringer for a mob boss who is currently lying low to avoid being bumped off by a rival gang leader, Barney Hackett.  When Nick, one of his henchmen, sees Ralph on his bus, he gets the bright idea of setting up Ralph to be bumped off instead of his boss by offering him a job as an executive in an insurance company.  When Ralph goes to ""work,"" the first hit fails, so Nick sends Ralph to Hackett's headquarters.  Ralph thinks he is there to sell insurance, Hackett thinks it is a showdown.  There is also a fun scene involving Alice finding Ralph with the mobster's girlfriend.  Unfortunately, only the studio audience saw the ending of this one.  I have also read how Gleason tried to explain the ending the following week, but I have never heard exactly what that ending happened to be!  Apparently, it caused a media frenzy at the time.  Also included on this tape is a first season sketch, ""Lunchbox"" (Length: 9:08; March 28, 1953), finds Ralph complaining about what Alice has been packing him for lunch.  Then another bus driver shows up and informs Ralph their lunchboxes got switched that day.  I love watching Ralph squirm and Alice glare while the other guy raves about the lunch.  This is a short skit, but very, very funny.",997574400,,1475,4.605363984674329
8104866,4,B000E373L2,"This is less of a review and more of a ""warning"" of sorts to people who consider and buy this tape.  In the episode ""Stand-In For Murder"" Gleason plays dual roles - that of a gangster and of Ralph Kramden.  Because this was performed live, the show ran over due to long laughter and so many costume changes by the star.  When you watch this, you will see that the show ends in mid-sentence.  The viewer is never made aware of the ending.  The following week Gleason gave one of his most famous monologues, describing to the audience how the show ended.  He talked for so long that the show ran over again that week!  But anyway, this tape is nice, and the show is a good source for a few hearty laughs!  The only major mistake MPI made was not including a summary of why there is no ending, and including Gleason's monologue on the ending of the show would have been a very welcomed addition.",991267200,,892,4.299401197604791
8104867,4,B000E373L2,"I've seen this documentary and it is a must for everyone that believe that what media is presenting is ""always right""! It is obvious that Jenny Jones and the producers manipulated their guests in the purpose to  make their show more ""sensational""... And the result became -  murder!  Their lack of responsibility for their actions are astonishing and  are well presented in this film. The ignorance of media under a magnifying  glass!",956102400,,434,4.972222222222222
