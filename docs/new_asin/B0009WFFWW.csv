The last really watchable 'good' bad movie by Fred Olen Ray, this film can't even be described. Sure one can tell you the loose plot of the movie, but it can't even wish to convey the lunacy of the hilarious bad stilted dialog, the atrocious but belly laugh warranting 'special effects', or the (lack of) acting that will have you on the floor.. This is NOT a film for anyone who wants to see any resemblance of a good movie. But for us select few who are real fans of Ray, this is a treasure. Not as great as Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers but definitely up there with Star Slammer.",1516838400,,724,4.330882352941177

I will take the liberty of telling you everything that happens in this abomination of a film so that you don't have to watch it.
Dont let the epic climactic music that starts with the movie trick you into believing that there will actually be action that merits such amazing music.  The movie begins with 3 guys dressed in medieval like armor riding horses in Arizona (because everyone knows that Arizona has a rich medieval era history).  Not too long into their riding montage do we see a young blonde (the international symbol for victim in all movies everywhere) dressed in you guessed it a skimpy dress/skirt from MidevalCollectables.com running away from the aforementioned three riders.  She makes sure to stay in the character of victim by stopping to look over her shoulder and pant on a frequent basis rather than focus on escaping.  Believe it or not, she gets captured, but the way she gets captured has never been depicted on any movie before in history (probably because movie directors aren't as bad as this one).  A 4th guy rides in on a horse (it can be inferred that he is associated with the other three because he is wearing the same plastic armor) and he has a big rope net.  Rather than ride by and throw the net on the blonde woman, he actually stops his horse and has it walk after her at a painfully slow speed while he extends his net toward her as if to give it to her (this is by the way captured in a first person perspective).  Instead of running into shrubbery where the horseman could not reach her, the blonde walks backward in circles keeping her arms over her face while painting.  After the worlds slowest kidnapping ends (it took like a solid minute) other riders come into the scene where one of them grins and says something in a monotone tone in what was probably supposed to be an evil voice so it becomes obvious he is the leader and antagonist.  The dialogue during the chase and kidnapping was clearly made by a rushed middle school student and this is fine because the delivery of the lines was at a middle school level.  So good casting in that regard.  This is the first 6 minutes and 8 seconds of the movie.
What happens next is a travesty.  An arrow comes out of nowhere piercing one of the horsemans carotid artery killing him instantly.  The reason this is a travesty is because this robin hood impersonator could just have easily hit the cameraman or the director thus ending the movie, however, I was not so fortunate.  I must give credit to the horse that the evil goon was sitting on when he got arrow sniped because the horse performance then and there carried the whole movie.  The nameless horse executed a completely believable neigh sound and fell to the ground as a result of shock, fear, confusion, and the now lifeless corpse of her once beloved master weighing her down.  The relationship between this horse and her master is never addressed at any point in the movie, nor is any counsel given to this animals character.  The horses performance, which was most likely earned the admiration of even Mr. Ed, far outclassed every other actor in this movie, yet the horses name is not even put in the credit.  This may have happened over the course of 9.5 seconds, but I will forever remember this scene as the best scene in the movie (aside from the very last scene of the movie of course).
Anyway, in rides the guy who won't stop grunting next to you at Planet Fitness wearing a simulated animal skin vest which is not buttoned.  Whats really impressive is that he didn't have a bow, he had a crossbow.  What makes this impressive is that he somehow fired an arrow from a crossbow and not a crossbow bolt.  Surely, this physics defying act, last second entrance, and lack of shirt must mean he is the protagonist and the savior of the blonde of limited intellect. So the antagonist, who was trying to hook up with his captive, had to delay his [forced] date with her so that he could do what every villain does, flee and leave incompetent grunts to take down the good guy(s).  However, this line of thugs looked slightly more competent then the Penguins grunts from Adam Wests Batman TV show.  One thug was a drummer from a unheard of metal band, another was the science teacher no one liked from high school and the last thug was an intern from ISIS.  Any and all hope that these three guys could beat this one guy quickly dissipates as soon as the *20 second fight starts.  Rather than all attacking at the same time, they take turns and follow the fight choreography.  Vito Luchi (the protagonist) over here was expecting the thugs to follow the fight choreography to a T which means had they not followed the choreography they could have easily defeated him right there ending the movie and thus this review, but no, something compelled them to fight on an unfair playing field with the proud Planet Fitness member.

As soon as dialogue commenced between the protagonist and the failed escape artist, I believed that this guy actually wasn't even a character in the movie but just some weirdo who came on site and just played along.  This claim gets blown out of the water because the two start speaking as if they were in a Shakespearian play, something they were probably banned from long ago on account of their horrid (and by horrid I mean putrid) acting.  Fortunately some guy was behind the camera with cue cards so they would actually be able to remember their lines.  Dont worry the movie is about to escalate.

Evil music commences at the sight of the IRS building or was it an evil castle at night time I cant remember.  Both look the same to me.  The next scene takes place at an altar where a man wearing blue eyeliner is either meditating or trying to find a place to hide in the movie where his family and friends won't see him on screen.  In walks a woman who has a lot of bills to pay at home because the outfit she was wearing was neither seductive or evil but just flat out embarrassing and demeaning. The two ashamed actors do a botched ritual involving cutting the arm of blue eyeliner guy and dripping blood into a Halloween candy serving tray.  They wonder why the blood wasn't good enough and come to the conclusion they needed pure blood for the ritual.  Had the guy actually cut his arm and not punctured a packet of hidden ketchup the ritual might have worked the first time then again I don't know how picky pagan gods are in B movies.

Everything that happens after this point is not even worth bringing up because it was sooooo boring.  The duo go to a slave auction, a harem of beautiful women who wore minimal amounts of clothing, and three different dungeons (aka one dungeon from three different camera angles).",1478822400,,6779,4.521703521703522
