8378768,5,B002L3GA5S,This is not a vampire movie. I believe the other reviewers have this movie mistaken. The loved ones is very twisted horror/torture film that gets more and more twisted as the plot thickens. Not for the faint of heart.,1510790400,,217,4.589743589743589
8378769,1,B002L3GA5S,The editing and direction are third rate. I've seen many student films that are much better than this. Avoid buying and rent it if you must see it. I'm sorry I spent the money based on the reviews which were probably left by some of those involved in the making of this home made video project.,1258243200,2,294,4.267857142857143
8378770,1,B002L3GA5S,"Don't waste your money on this half A$$ed attempt at film making.. watching paint dry on a monkeys rear would be much more entertaining.. Or even possibly stabbing yourself in the eye ball several times with a soldering gun..  I feel sorry for the cast and crew that worked on this debacle, i'm sure this is the film they ""don't talk about"".",1250035200,7,341,4.5
8378771,5,B002L3GA5S,"One of the main reasons I dislike the Twilight films (and the books) is that they take the sexy out of a genre that is traditionally steeped in sex and erotica.  Loved Ones is a throwback to those great Vampire movies of the 80's and 90's where everyone was sexy and beautiful.  Good story, decent acting and a sense of fun makes this a must-see for indie horror fans.",1249948800,7,368,4.318840579710145
8378772,4,B002L3GA5S,"Too often, filmmakers take a hot genre and make bad films hoping that the fact that the subject matter is popular will help sales.  Yes, Loved Ones is a Vampire movie and yes, Vampires are very ""in"" right now, but don't let that fool you...this is a really solid Vampire film that borrows from a few different stories and weaves it into one tightly-paced and sexy film.  Check this one out!",1249948800,6,390,4.47887323943662
