8284749,2,B001BT1SHS,The information was there I guess but it was super low budget.  Honestly looked like a presentation that a 3rd grade class put together.,1516752000,,136,4.666666666666667
8284750,5,B001BT1SHS,"Wonderful information! Thanks for the good job and colecting all this. I recommend it to everybody! I already start the process of making subtititles in Bulgarian and other languages. Very useful stuf.
Thank you!",1349308800,,212,5.264705882352941
8284751,1,B001BT1SHS,"I would give this a negative number if it was possible.  This simply fuels the vaccine-hysteria and the production quality looks like something that was done for a middle-schooler's art project.

In the mean time, I'm concerned about my child whose history of asthma and steroids may have weakened her response to her MMR shots, which means she may not be protected.  There was a case of measles brought into our pediatrician's clinic last week.  This puts all the babies that are too young for the MMR and all the kids with chronic health issues at risk.  The only reason measles isn't common in the US in the 21st century is widespread vaccination. When people travel to measles-endemic areas, they may bring it back and the non-vaccinators amplify the response, keeping it in the population.

Not giving a vaccine when you can puts not only you at risk, but others in your community.  It is the parents choice to put their kids at risk of contracting a vaccine-preventable disease.  It shouldn't be their right to endanger those people in the community that would protect themselves, but are either too young or have underlying health issues that put them at risk.",1306368000,6,1167,4.8
8284752,5,B001BT1SHS,"I have just finished viewing this DVD.  This DVD was produced by a Mom concerned about the vaccine safety issue.  While I have many DVD's on this topic (I am a vaccine safety researcher), I have to say this DVD is by far one of the best DVD's I have seen.  Why do I say this?  Because of its INTEGRITY.  Some of the very best physicians and researchers are interviewed in this presentation.  This young Mom does her level best to provide up-to-date science and information in presenting the 'other side' to the vaccine safety issue debate.  I do agree with another reviewer on this board that Dr. Tenpenny's DVD is a good one.  But I so very much admire this young Mom's efforts in exposing the Truth for what it is behind the vaccine safety cover-up.

Do your homework, Moms and Dads.  Educate yourselves behind the 'myth' of vaccine safety.  Kudos to this Mom in her efforts to bring the Truth to the public about this very important topic.  I applaud her.",1244419200,14,958,4.473988439306359
8284753,5,B001BT1SHS,"Simply put, I was blown away by the information presented in this DVD. The film is produced by a Mother who takes the viewer on a journey to discover the dangerous truth about the toxicity of vaccines and does it in a way that is stripped of corporate bias. She interviews the leading experts in this debate and does so in an organic and honest way. Films like these are always produced by people and not corporations and I applaud the efforts of the filmmakers who reported on a topic vital to the future of our children with honesty, integrity and intelligence. No one gets Academy Awards for reporting the truth such as what is presented in this film but if Awards were given for information, love and integrity, this film brings home Best Picture in my eyes. I vote this film as a must see, bar none, for anyone who cares about kids.",1242518400,7,837,4.441558441558442

* David Kirby the author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evidence-of-Harm-Mercury-in-Vaccines-and-the-Autism-Epidemic-A-Medical-Controversy/dp/B00150D6M8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evidence of Harm: Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic: A Medical Controversy</a>
* Peggy O'Mara the editor and publisher of Mothering Magazine
* Barbara Loe Fisher the founder of The National Vaccine Information center
* Dan Olmsted the U.P.I. reporter who broke the story that questioned ""Why aren't there any autistic children in an Amish population of 100,000?""
* Dr. Stephanie Cave the author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Your-Doctor-May-Not-Tell-You-About-Children-s-Vaccinations/dp/0446677078/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Vaccinations</a>

There are interviews with two well spoken medical doctors who integrate natural health in their practices, and strongly question the safety of vaccines. There is also footage shot in Washington at a rally that includes speeches by Congressmen Dan Burton and Dave Weldon.

Hearing their interviews was interesting. There was also just a little bit of information on treating epidemics, and childhood diseases with homeopathy. I wish they had focused on this subject more.

Overall, this two DVD set moves very slowly. While some of the content is good, the technology behind the video is weak. The on screen graphics in the first DVD would be better left out. The host is playing a mother traveling with her son, and it's just a little too cheesy.

It's one of those videos that had a lot of potential, but the editors should have left much more on the cutting room floor. If you want a very fast moving and informative video on the vaccine debate I suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vaccines-What-CDC-Documents-and-Science-Reveal/dp/B0007QQW5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vaccines:  What CDC Documents and Science Reveal</a>&nbsp;by Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.",1232582400,10,2202,6.658536585365853
8284755,5,B001BT1SHS,"This dvd is hilariously low quality.  I'm not sure how you would even go about putting something together that would look this bad, but it does provide an excellent overview of the concerns surrounding vaccines.  Includes informative interviews with various experts and authors, providing a great starting point for further research on an important subject.",1221004800,6,357,5.472727272727273
