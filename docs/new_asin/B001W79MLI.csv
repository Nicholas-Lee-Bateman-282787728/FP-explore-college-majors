I have enjoyed the series and can forgive some of the continuity problems. However I should have stopped viewing after season 3.

Visually amazing, the story is at times disturbing and at other times is a long drawn out soap opera. The story is re-watchable, and the extra content is worth watching.

The sound is good and the picture is crisp. The pacing is at times hectic, and the story advances either really quickly, or not at all.

Even by the end of the series, not all of the plot points are addressed, but I believe the right decision was made to end it where they did.",1263081600,,664,4.462809917355372

8347160,5,B001W79MLI,BSG was the last show/series that I thought I'd enjoy until a friend suggested that I check it out...so worth it!!! I am glad I caught it at this phase in the series so that I can watch it in sequence without the anticipation of the next season so far in the future.,1245715200,,266,4.037735849056604
8347161,5,B001W79MLI,"Season 2 continues the excellent artistry of season 1.  The cast delivers believable performances of nuanced (often conflicted) characters, with no weak links.  The writing is superb, with a rich mix of drama, action and comedy, and avoids the usual Hollywood pitfalls.  Cinematography is distinctive, with effective use of a ""handheld"" look, especially during space scenes.  The music is very mature, being a rich mixture of vocals and different types of instrumental performances.

In short, this is great fun for grown-ups.",1243468800,,526,5.444444444444445
