So many beautiful Playboy women appear on this video, it's hard to keep your eyes and...um...hands...from wandering.  Being that I'm not too excited over hardcore, I find comfort in many of Playboy's videos.  They're classy and more artistic than, say, most or even all other pornographic material.  These contain little more than just naked chicks dancing, but, they surely are beautiful chicks, and this DVD goes the extra mile to bring you the hottest.  Dress up as Santa and pull out your reindeer, it's Christmas all over again in January, or whenever for that matter.  If you want some ""artsy"" nudes, this is the boot to the cool...or something...Fun, jolly fun.  Just wish they'd leave the ""bozo"" guys out of it.  Sigh.",1010793600,2,798,4.992424242424242
1655513,2,B00005RG6Y,"While the women stand around the christmas tree naked, lay together in bed naked, open presents naked, and play with a snowman naked, that's all this video offers.  No eroticism is to be had and there is no contact among the females.  It starts out with great anticipation when the narrator describes 4 sexy sorority sisters snowed in on christmas eve wearing short skirts and looking positively innocent.  Yet it fizzles when the editing jumps all too quickly to clothes falling on the floor and the girls throwing tinsle at each other.  Great possibilities lost.  The subsequent vignettes are, unlike the girls, flat.  This is not a video of the caliber of other Playboy triumphs like Girlfriends.  Very disappointing.  If you like watching girls with implants standing or lying naked, buy it. If you want some girl/girl action or at least some eroticism, let this one pass.",1009065600,4,876,4.91156462585034
1655514,4,B00005RG6Y,"I recommend this DVD, besides the originality of the theme, for the first appearance on video of several Playmates (S. Heinrich, D. Kurtis, K. Stanfield, N.Van Croft, L. Vuolo, J. Walcott), for a lot of extras (videos and data on Playmates), for the video quality and for the beauty of scenes and Playmates.",1007510400,,307,4.811320754716981
1655515,1,B00005RG6Y,"The title tells it all. Not a very stipulating video. Playboy has run its course with this type of slick, silicon fueled video. Pass on this one.",1006819200,4,145,4.407407407407407

7952280,4,B00005RG6Y,"If you like the girl on the cover aka Jennifer Walcott this is a good pick-up.  The bonus features includes 4 clips running about 15 minutes of just her playmate profile.  Jennifer Walcott, Shannon Steward, Kimberly Stanfield, Buffy Tyler, & Dalene Curtis are my main reasons for recommending this DVD.  Each appears in 2 of the 8 main clips.  Only one clip doesn't have any of them & that clip aka I'll be home for X-mas is probably the reason the cast list is longer than the playmate list so that clip gets a thumbs down from me.  Shannon Stewart's clips are both really hot.  She makes me want to be the guy in the clips really badly.  She's got the total package.  I wish I could give it 5 stars but despite some top level girls, it just doesn't have a top rating feel for me anymore.  I thought I used to like it better but the other girls & the heavy ""set-up"" involved in making the clips X-massy bring it down a notch.  Also, I like Jennifer Walcott better with dark hair.  I thought she had that her but was wrong.  Celebrity Photographers does have her with darker hair (I checked the box).  I will try to review that after I watch it again.  I remember liking her on it.",1273622400,,1181,4.261261261261262

Christmas Break-a guy who broke his leg can't go to the party so three Playmates bring the party and nudity to him. Think of ZZ Top Legs video and you get the picture.

The DVD version has a lot of extras to it and there is a Playmate profile segment on Jennifer Walcott who is also pictured on the front cover of the DVD. I liked watching this video; I doubt it will ever make the top ten holiday classic list. Playboy - Playmates Unwrapped gets an AAAA++++.

7952283,3,B00005RG6Y,"Overall I liked this one. I do have a few complaints though. First of all I agree with the below reviewer that complained about fake boobs and bleach blond hair. I have never seen anything special about Dalene Kurtis, Buffy Tyler or Stephanie Heinrich, and this video is no exception. And Jennifer Walcott is undeniably gorgeous, but that is the worst boob job I have ever seen. What was she thinking?
Also I still have no idea why Playboy DVDs have all these artsy vignettes with plots. And they have been doing this for well over 10 years! Hasn't anybody told them all we care about is the nude women? I don't want to watch Santa Claus romp around the house leaving gifts. Get him the @#$^* out of there. But the worst was the clip involving one of my favorite Playmates, Nichole Van Croft. She is giving her man a strip show, and for some reason they keep showing us the guy's reaction for extended periods of time. WE DON'T WANT THIS!!! I can already assume HE'S enjoying it. Now stop showing his goofy face so I can enjoy it too!
There were some pleasant surprises though. For one, I never thought a lot of Kimberley Spicer from the magazine, but in live action she looked pretty cute. And it is also nice that most of the girls shave ""downstairs"" so we can have a good look at what we really want to see.
And one of my favorite things on the whole DVD was the bonus footage of Lindsey Vuolo ""on the set."" The entire segment just focused on her walking around nude while they filmed her. This is what I like to see. No plots, no extra characters, ESPECIALLY GUYS--just beautiful naked women walking around. Is that so much to ask?",1085616000,16,1635,4.381578947368421
7952284,1,B00005RG6Y,"More silicone then a toy factory,you have Darlene Kurtis,Stephaine ?,and others that go to show woman with silicone-enhanced boobs are unattractive. Just a bunch of bimbos dancing around to X-MAS carols makes this laughable. Skip all Playboy and STICK WITH PENTHOUSE ONLY",1057276800,4,271,5.476190476190476
7952285,5,B00005RG6Y,I bought this movie when it came out before Christmas and I love it. It is full of hot women and they do the greatest things. This is a must have for any Playboy fan. This is my second favorite Playboy movie right under Pajama Party. This movie is great for Christmas and has some great songs. Does anyone else love how in Playboy movies they rip off songs that you have heard before. I want to know who sings and plays these songs in Playboy movies. They are good. BUY THIS MOVIE.,1029628800,2,481,4.182795698924731
