8437038,5,B004OBLBUE,"In an age when so many wish for the ""good old days"" and too few people read, once in a while a film comes along that gives any viewer easily and directly the information we all need about what life really was like more than a hundred years ago.  The past was not happily ever after full of good and decent church going souls.  It was a hard and brutally competitive world.  A world in which all women of all classes had no choices whatsoever.  And men of all classes had few choices.  ""Esther Waters"" depicts this world most graphically.  Some might think a 1948 film boring and out of date until they see it.  At a time when extreme groups wish us all to believe the past was better and the present is full of failure and regret, indecency and corruption it is a good idea to view films like this.  Like Dickens novels, it is based on a late Victorian story.  It pulls no punches about Victorian society; a world which has many values that live even today and are just as cruel and/or impractical now as they were then.  Try it out.  See if you think differently about all the cries, especially from certain groups, that we need to go back to have a better world.",1369353600,2,1164,4.269406392694064
