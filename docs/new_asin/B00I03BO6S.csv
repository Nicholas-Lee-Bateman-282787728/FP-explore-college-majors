8637741,5,B00I03BO6S,This is my very favorite movie and I only got to watch it when I could catch it on turner Classic movies so I was thrilled to be able to get it on DVD. It's a movie about a woman and her two daughters and how they manage while their father is away at war. And of coarse there is tragedy involved. So very happy to have a copy of this movie.,1465430400,5,340,3.736111111111111
