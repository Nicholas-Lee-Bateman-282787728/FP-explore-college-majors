7989210,5,B000094J96,"This DVD captures the magic of being at one of her shows. I have seen her 3x and each time was different, but fun. This concert reflects her current style. I saw her in Geneve 1999, after her trip to Turkey, and this was the theme she used. Her Paleo Nyon Festival in 1998 had more choreographed dancing. This DVD also has several produced music videos attached.",1196553600,,362,4.417910447761194
7989211,5,B000094J96,"OK.  First my confession.  I must be the only French-speaking person in America who (until recently) had never heard of Patricia Kaas.  And it was only when I stumbled on a copy of the movie ""And Now, Ladies and Gentlemen"" (with Patricia Kaas and Jeremy Irons) at my local Blockbuster, that I first heard the amazing voice of this remarkable women.  She possesses a voice that will mesmerize you, and an onstage presence and ""class"" that most current performers can't even begin to demonstrate.  If you are a fan (as am I) of DVDs that make you feel that you are ""there"" in the room with a favorite entertainer ... and the recent Norah Jones and Sting and Andrea Bocelli DVDs immediately come to mind ... then buy this DVD.  You're in for an evening of soft lights, elegant surroundings, and a voice that will reach deep into your heart.  And you don't need to know a word of French to understand the romantic message that this DVD conveys.",1094256000,11,940,4.5266272189349115
7989212,5,B000094J96,"Patricia Kaas is arguably one of the best singers on the planet today.  For some reason her U.S. audience has not embraced her to the same extent as her European audience.  Perhaps it is because most of her songs are in French.  You don't have to understand a word of French to be captivated by this DVD.  In addition to a great voice, she is one of the most beautiful, sensual and provocative performers to grace the stage today.  Add some truly talented, first rate musicians to accompany her; throw in some great camera work; include the fantastic audio and video technical production; and you have all the ingredients for a great DVD viewing experience.  It's a buy.",1082678400,8,670,4.635593220338983
7989213,5,B000094J96,"This DVD presents an unbelievably romantic and sensual woman who puts you and keeps you in the mood for whatever throughout the concert. My wife and I first heard Patricia Kaas while wandering through a bookstore in LA. Neither of us speak anything but English but her voice and sound communicated clearly. We bought her ""Best of . . "" and followed that with a number of other CD purchases. This DVD presents her best plus songs that are new to us.  If you're looking for a contemporary popular sound with class and a sensual, romantic sound, this DVD will deliver.",1079654400,9,565,4.594059405940594
