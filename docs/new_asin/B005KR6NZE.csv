On his discharge from hospital Walt Sherill goes straight back to work. Sherill's wife Tracey (Dolores Dorn) tells Koleski that her brother Roy Baldwin (Ted Knight) is the Principle of Cortez High, they both visit the school on the off chance it may give them lead, but without success! But word gets around and Tracey starts getting nuisance calls by person or persons unknown. The treats turn to violence and Sherill gets beaten up again outside his house, the only clue he has is the ring-leader is a boy called Chuck. Walt gets evermore obsessed with getting revenge he hires a private detective Joseph Finney (Stanley Adams), buys a gun and is relieved of his job!
Koleski shows Tracey some pictures of local suspects she recognises one as Bill Quinn (Andrew Merritt) who works part-time at a local drug store, with Sherill hot on his trail he goes to the ring-leader Chuck Landry (Michael Callan) for help. Tragically  before Chuck can finally be tracked down two people would be dead in a violent end to this story of revenge!

Back from filming the critically savaged DUEL OF THE CHAMPIONS (1961) in Italy. Back at home Alan Ladd is on firmer ground here in this wide-screen  black & white film noir drama for Columbia using his own production company Ladd Enterprises the story was adapted from a 1957 novel ""The Tiger Among Us"" by Leigh Brackett and renamed 13 WEST STREET it opened in New York on the 6th June 1962 (Running Time 80 minutes) on the bottom half of a double bill a further sign of his declining career. In his next film THE CARPETBAGGERS (1964) he was in a supporting role but he gave a critically acclaimed performance. He died on the 29th January 1964. But he was not finished quite yet nearly twenty years later along came Steve Martin with an affectionate, brilliant black and white comedy / crime caper DEAD MEN DON'T PLAID (1982) filmed with 1980's footage cleverly intercut with scenes from eighteen vintage Hollywood films including two of Alan Ladd's early films THIS GUN FOR HIRE (1942) and THE GLASS KEY (1942); Perhaps this is how he should be best remembered in 2014 the fiftieth anniversary of his death?

13 WEST STREET is now in the Public Domain. The picture and audio qualities are excellent also available on DVD from Amazon.com Region 1. Any Alan Ladd fan could do a lot worse than visit <DownunderDVD.com>  for a full list of Alan Ladd films available on DVD.",1395273600,5,2731,4.7368421052631575
