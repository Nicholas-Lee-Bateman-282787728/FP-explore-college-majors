4075791,5,B0036BDQ38,For $24.99 it's a good price to buy. Fro some odd reason this show has pricy box sets. It is a great show for women because it deals a lot about relationships with friends and lovers. It's a great show if you have a gal pal to watch it with. I don't know why they can't just condense the series into one box set but I guess this is a way they can make some money. Each box set can range from $30 to $50 so to be at a reasonable price of $24.99 is boss. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who like adult relationship drama and bonds between friends. Such a great show.,1373328000,5,579,3.9572649572649574
4075792,3,B0036BDQ38,"I bought and watched Nana Uncut box set 1, Nana Uncut box set 2, Nana Uncut box set 3, and Nana Uncut box set 4. I do not think that I would watch it again. I may be wrong, but I don't believe so. If you are truly friends, I don't believe that one would continually miss seeing old friends for a yearly reunion. It seemed like Nana the singer dropped her old friends.",1369612800,,367,3.972972972972973
4075793,4,B0036BDQ38,"It didn't come across to me as good as everyone brags it to be, however it is a very well put together series. If you really love ""a piece of life"" animes, this one is for you.

I did enjoy the anime, the music, and the drama. It's worth watching at least once. As far as wow factors, the only one that wowed me was on the very last episode of box set 4. It was so piece of life, that it hurt yet you still liked the ending.",1365292800,,424,3.764044943820225
4075794,5,B0036BDQ38,"To the point,  NANA provides such a riveting story and character development that supersedes all predecessors in the genre.  The characters all possess a unique personality that can be easily differentiated from one another despite the abundant cast count.  The relationships that form/break and how these situations unfold provide the story with depth and has influence on the overall mentality of the character affected directly such such events.  The writers did a wonderful job coinciding all the affiliates within the anime to mesh and have significant influences upon eachother.  NANA is a fresh of breathe air w/o the unnecessary over dramatization (like chobits) and keeps the viewer engaged till the end.",1346457600,,713,5.387387387387387
4075795,5,B0036BDQ38,I was very intoxicated by this series. It is incomplete though. But if they add another season I'll buy it in a heartbeat. -Jult Warfell,1337212800,,136,4.48
4075796,5,B0036BDQ38,I love this show! It's one of my favorites. And this box set is amazing!!! I can't wait for the new ones to come out!,1310256000,2,117,3.72
4075797,5,B0036BDQ38,"NANA is a story about two girls with the same name who randomly meet while going to pursue their dreams of making it big in Tokyo.  The NANA most folks know best is the singer who dreams of having her band - The Black Stones - sign with a major label and rock out in front of sell-out crowds.  Her friend, Hachi (their nickname in the story for the non-singer Nana) dreams of finding her perfect soul mate and love in the big city.  There is more to the adventures of these two ladies but their friendship is the glue that holds the tale together. The music is VERY GOOD - it stands alone which is unique for some anime shows -  and I recommend this series for anyone who likes strong characterizations, good writing and excellent music that fits in the storylines!",1293494400,9,765,4.328671328671328
8389807,5,B0036BDQ38,The ending kind of leaves you on a bad note/cliff hanger but the entire show is just hilarious. Its very realistic in that life doesnt always go the way you want to and people make mistakes. But it is also very funny and lighthearted which helps you get through and cope with all the emotions you experience with the main character. Not for kids but definitely a must watch.,1502496000,,374,4.434782608695652

8389811,5,B0036BDQ38,"Nana is an amazing anime that will make you laugh with it's references and humor but make you cry. I will argue that this is the best anime out there. Honestly can they please make more. The manga unfortunately is a bit dissapointing, most fans say the manga should've ended where the anime did. Warning you will get sucked up in this anime.",1413676800,,341,4.428571428571429
