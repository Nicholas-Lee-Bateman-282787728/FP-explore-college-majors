This second video contains the 4th, 5th, and 6th episodes of the first series.
(4) Chef tries to find a supplier of illegal unpasteurized cheese for his restaurant, and gets in trouble with the law and with his wife.
(5) Now that Chef and his wife have bought Le Chateau Anglais, they need publicity. Chef must endure interviews with clueless journalists and pose nicely for cameramen. It doesn't go well.
(6) Chef's peripatetic father drops in for a visit and suggests a Caribbean menu. Although Chef knows nothing of Jamaican cuisine, he enlists the bumbling Everton to help.
These episodes are among the best of the first series. This sitcom peaked early and the later series are not as good.",1075075200,6,912,4.890322580645162

Chef runs his kitchen with terror and venom, just as Basil ran his hotel... the problem is that his wife is actually running the show, and only lets Chef think he's in control.",1004400000,6,307,4.5

7925125,5,B00004WG67,"If Chef was good, a second helping is better even. At Chateau Anglais, Chef Gareth and his crew continue to outrage, outcook and outspice anything broadcast today. Are there more videos in this series?. I want more more  more!",912816000,7,226,4.794871794871795
