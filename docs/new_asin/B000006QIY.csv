8216553,3,B000006QIY,"Julius Caesar was master of the Roman world, but this video falls somewhat short in bringing that fact to light.  It is a decent production, and it does document his rise to political power, but his career was so fascinating that a program which is less than an hour in length hardly begins to cover all the bases.  Caesar is unquestionably one of the biggest and boldest figures in history - this video needs to be at least twice as long, and maybe more, to give the subject a thorough review.",1100563200,,494,4.417582417582418
8216554,3,B000006QIY,"This video on the life of Julius Caesar is light information for the buyer that wants to know basic facts spiced with historiccally biased but interesting semi-facts.
Anyway, I don't want to sound too critical I did enjoy the video though it failed to capture the true greatness of Caesar. One should not expect dsicussions on battles in ancient history nor on the policy of Clemens the shortage of food in the civil war aera but fora light overwiew that granted does not do the great man justice one couls certainly buy this as well as the one's on Trajan,Hadrian,Constantine and so on., so ""Ambition should be made of sterner stuff"", but ok.",973555200,2,643,4.699115044247788
