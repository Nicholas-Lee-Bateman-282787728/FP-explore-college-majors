4009344,5,B002XOG4GA,"I have mild lower back scoliosis and it has been giving me so much pain over the last year. I'm going to a chiropractor for it and he recommended Yoga. I got this DVD set because it was specifically created for back issues. It really has helped me a lot. I was worried that I would get too bored with his gentle voice and the slow movements and even breathing ... I'm not normally much of a ""namaste"" gal ... but the exercise routines are really relaxing and refreshing, and gentle enough that you can't really hurt yourself accidentally. If I set my concentration on it, even the exercises that seem ""too easy"" for me still provide strengthening and stretching. I'm used to high intensity workouts, so I have to adapt my expectations in order to feel the benefits of this DVD set. I do highly recommend for someone like me. Give it a try! You'll probably find yourself taking a lot less ibuprofin and using the hot pad less frequently almost right away.",1366848000,23,954,4.488505747126437
4009345,4,B002XOG4GA,"I've been dealing with chronic lower back pain for several years.  I have tried every form of conservative care as well as surgery and have found that yoga is the best medicine for me.  It won't cure my back injury but it makes the rest of my body feel good and keeps the area around my injury strong and stretched.  Stiffness in your back and hamstrings will cause the severity of pain in the injured areas of your back to be much worse and uncomfortable, doing yoga, even at a beginner's level will help greatly.  These dvd's are great a gateway into yoga and pain relief for yoga novices.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone who feels they aren't limber enough for yoga.",1366848000,16,682,4.467741935483871
4009346,5,B002XOG4GA,"I'm generally reserved when I purchase something like this.  It could be pretty disappointing.  But the DVDs are very well made. Gary Kraftsow does a very interesting presentation  to help you understand the parts of your body that are affected when you do the poses.  He then explained about breathing and some basic poses.  Then your practice sessions start.  There are three sessions, one that is the easiest, a more intermediate one, and one the takes a litlle more time.  Not a lot of different moves and poses are included in this beginning DVD designed to help you with specific issues.

THe DVD are done in a very professional way.  You can see that as you watch them.  I was pleased. The demonstrators are adult people with regular clothes on, no skinny girls wearing leotards.  It's all business. You really do learn and get to practice, and it isn't so long that you are put off by it.  What a deal.  I got both the upper back and the neck plus the lower back for $25.  It wold cost %25 each plus shipping from another seller.",1364256000,,1037,4.505376344086022
4009347,5,B002XOG4GA,"I'm a 38-year-old very active woman who has recently been having a lot of hip/back problems.  I have sciatica, a pulled groin and bursitis in my hip. I've been to the doctor who told me there was nothing wrong and prescribed pain pills, anti-inflammatory meds, and muscle relaxants. I've been in physical therapy for six months and that helps but doesn't seem to last (and isn't cheap!). During a recent flare-up, in desperation, I ordered these DVDs. I haven't done the one for the upper back yet because that's not where my issues are, but have been doing the one for the lower back every day and I feel like a new person.  This is the first time in 6 months that I haven't been in pain. The numbness in my leg and foot are gone and my hip feels about 85%. It's allowed me to get back to all the activities I enjoy, Zumba, running, weight-lifting, and boot camp. The video isn't fancy and it doesn't have any background music. You don't really feel like you're doing anything (maybe because none of the poses are super challenging) but I have seen such a difference. Highly recommended!",1363651200,56,1088,4.517766497461929
4009348,5,B002XOG4GA,Definitely love these DVDs.  They are very relaxing and have helped me to de-stress after a long day of work.,1362614400,,109,4.45
4009349,4,B002XOG4GA,"This is not, as I had thought, an exercise video. Instead, it is the demonstration of a number of exercises for back therapy. It also seems to be oriented towards yoga professionals and physical therapists because of the technical language.",1360713600,5,240,5.025
4009350,1,B002XOG4GA,"I bought both DVDs, for upper back... and low back.
I do exercise daily, 2-3 times a day. My first at 5am is one hour 'Easy Yoga for Seniors' by Pat Lester, or other yoga DVD (I have four), then some weight lifting and ending with Tai Chi by Scott Cole.
Why I am writing this? I am seventy and counting, and not novice to exercise.
Since I have pain in upper back and shoulders (surgery on both shoulders), also lots of pain in lower back, I ordered these DVDs due to many positive comments.
I am very disappointed with both.
Those young people doing poses are definitely not in pain, by my judgment.
All is moving very fast. Not ONCE did Mr. Kraftsow said 'do what you can', or stop and catch up with us later, etc. It would have been better, if he himself joined and exercised as well. In that case, I think, it would have been in slower pace and he would not have sounded like a drill sergeant.
I orered these DVDs while getting physical therapy for my shoulder pain, and was hoping, that continuing with his viniyoga therapy would help me, and lesser my pain.
It was costly mistake on my part.
Since our post office is very far and I do not wish to pay postage again, I am keeping DVDs (for dust collecting I guess.)",1343433600,19,1220,4.240343347639485

4009354,5,B002XOG4GA,"These are simple exercises to do. If they're too hard at first it's probably because the back and leg muscles are extremely tight - just keep at it. And be gentle on your body; do what you can slowly - you'll get there in time and the exercises will become easier. Within a few days or weeks, anyone will feel better and have more flexibility and strength in the back. I do yoga back exercises almost daily. There is plenty of research showing yoga for the back is just as good as physical therapy and both yoga and PT are better than meds and suffering in pain. If I feel back pain (usually from excessive sitting), I come back to these DVDs and feel better shortly. They are worth the small investment and the relief from back pain.",1501459200,,734,4.326086956521739

When I start feeling tightness or feel close to pulling a muscle I do this exercise every day for a few days. Very gentle, and the movements are nice and slow. Really does the trick and is suitable for anyone! Mind you, this is not meant to be exercise, so don't buy this with the intention of breaking a sweat.

I already had the 'low back', and respect it so much, such that this 2-fer package's 'low back' was for a friend.  As for the 'upper back', I was getting some age/weight room related arm and neck problems.  The workout goes a long way to educating me while providing a helpful workout.

4009375,3,B002XOG4GA,"I have a really bad back, and was looking forward to using these DVD's.  The DVD's in and of themselves are great, easy to follow and use.  My problem with the lower back DVD is that you spend so much time on your knees that it aggravated my knees.  So for me, it can't be used every day, maybe a couple of times a week.  Which is sad, but there it is.  So if you have bad knees in addition to a bad lower back you may want to review the DVD's or check with your doctor before proceeding.",1451692800,2,488,3.888888888888889
4009376,5,B002XOG4GA,"If you are in pain and really want to heal... try this.... if you are in pain and want to heal and don't try this ... then I don't want to hear you whine.  (this was written as an endorsement ... love the Therapy ... but also as a ""push"" for a couple of friends... with back problems but will not do anything to help themselves ... not asking anyone to succeed... just try ... pain is horrible) ... and if you work on your feet or use your back or sit too long ... you should be doing at least one of these therapies regularly.... health is everything ... ask me... I've had over 2/3 rds of my spine replaced... before that I was an athlete with 15 years of yoga under my belt ... I believe I would be in a wheel chair without this ... but everyone should consider keeping their spine strong and healthy ... age sneaks up on you ...  quality of life matters ... that is all I'm saying....  You will either give it a try and work for it or not ... but if you choose to do the work... this is a great way to do it and a safe one.  The most important thing to know ... and the least emphasized in many yoga or exercise dvd's is posture / form and HOW to do each exercise correctly and why ... though this instructor is dry ... the information you get is so important.. and the relief of real pain ... can happen.  Be well.",1449705600,7,1319,3.981060606060606
4009377,5,B002XOG4GA,"I cannot speak highly enough about these DVD's. I've been doing a routine approximately 3-4 days a week for almost 5 years - the difference in my quality of life is remarkable. I started having back problems from a cycling injury (shifted my pelvic alignment), went to see various chiropractors, even went to the ER at one point out of desperation, ultimately incorporating yoga into my routine has helped me the most.

I've comparison shopped a bit too - as far as I'm concerned these are great: VERY ACCESSIBLE, don't require any props of you, don't throw any curve balls where you thought it was a beginner's DVD and suddenly she's doing the splits kind of a thing.

This is my second review of these products... I'm amazed that much; I feel compelled to try to get other people to do it! I would've saved thousands of dollars if I had found these first - instead I waded through crippling back pain and feeling powerless for more than a year. I'm telling you, give it a shot.",1449705600,2,979,4.52542372881356

4009380,5,B002XOG4GA,"Really grateful that I found this video. I think the creator Gary is extremely passionate about his work and it shows. He is very knowledgable in the field and I enjoyed how he goes through all the postures slowly and thoroughly.

4009381,5,B002XOG4GA,Awesome!  Packed with incredibly helpful information on upper and lower back problems and thorough instructions on yoga positions.  All that is missing are more modification options for positions.,1442361600,2,196,5.964285714285714

4009383,4,B002XOG4GA,"These have been great DVDs so far. My only annoyance is that the instructor will say to take some breaths in and then will move on before I've finished taking deep breaths. Deep, slow breaths are important to stretch back muscles and relax the body -- that's kind of the point of yoga. It's also very repetitive, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It can just get a little stale and feel like you're overworking one area. But I just stop and do a different move until I feel ready to join back in.",1439078400,2,502,4.294736842105263
4009384,5,B002XOG4GA,"Great set with clear instructions. The sequences are short and varied so you can pick what you need for the time available. All exercises are slow paced and emphasize small, deep movements. I do Iyengar yoga and bought this set to expand my flexibility. I'm only 30 and the poses in this set focus on minor muscles that are important for stability but are often ignored in regular yoga class in favor of further reach and extension. I would recommend this vinyoga set to anyone with limited mobility or wanting to expand their regular practice.",1438387200,,544,4.7368421052631575
4009385,1,B002XOG4GA,"So misleading, and boring!  The same exercises are done thru all three lessons, over and over again.  No help at all.  I can figure out a series by myself that are better than these and he's the professional.  You couldn't relax with the sound of his voice, no music in the background that does give a sense of relaxation, nothing there but his voice, dull and annoying.  I was so looking forward to this series in hopes that someone had put together a good exercise plan to help my back, but even the exercises did cause more pain than good.  Do Not Buy It!! Its surely not worth the money...I really wanted this to be something to get excited about with looking forward with hope that I would thoroughly enjoy it...Sad to say it didn't meant any of my anticipations...",1436313600,4,770,4.464285714285714

4009387,3,B002XOG4GA,"I have only done the lower back pain one.  I have found it somewhat helpful but it was recommended to me for help with back and hip pain and I think it is more aimed at healthy yoga practitioners.  I would have found it more helpful if perhaps there were three people doing the poses showing variations for people who because of pain or conditioning or size cannot do the exercises as shown.  There should be discussion of aids like blocks and straps to help do some of the poses.  There was also too much explanation of some obvious poses and too little for others.  For instance, there were a couple of poses where I really wanted to know which muscles to contract and which to relax.  A couple of the hip exercises seem like they will be good after I am more healed but - for now, it seemed like I just re-injured myself.",1435017600,4,824,4.283870967741936

4009392,5,B002XOG4GA,"I bought these as extra because my original one sometimes gets stuck.  I love those DVD's. They are educational and quite helpful. To me they are alternative medicine so to speak.  I recommend them only if the person buying them is a good student in life... you have to be to be patient and apply the poses slowly but surely and learn why and how.  Gary Kraftsow is a methodical and empowering teacher.  These DVD's are not for every day yoga but for those areas of the body that we all need help with specially as we get older: neck and shoulders, hips and lower back.

My doctor suggested I do gentle yoga to stretch and strengthen my lower back and to strengthen my core. I ordered this DVD based on the reviews and am pleased with my purchase. The poses are explained well and the pace is slow and gentle. I did not feel like I was really doing anything, and yet when I finished my back felt relaxed and pain free.

4009395,2,B002XOG4GA,I was hoping the DVD would be ideal to help me recover from recent back surgery...I found the DVD's way too difficult for someone who has no prior yoga experience and too difficult for someone who is currently in pain to perform.  The demonstrations for the exercises are at way too fast of a pace to try to learn from if you've never done yoga before.  The instructor is very knowlegable and well versed in yoga and would be a great DVD set for someone already familiar with yoga but not too good to start off with.,1423526400,2,516,4.309278350515464

4009397,3,B002XOG4GA,"I do not have a chronic back injury, but my upper back is a persistent source of built-up tension from my office job. I thought that a deep, back-focused practice would release that tension. I have experience with yoga, but I don't like fast, sweat-inducing, ""power"" practices. Rather, I'm happy to take it slow and ""listen"" to each movement, respecting the limits of my body and appreciating simple stretches and subtle positioning differences. Still, I disliked this video. It is ""mild"" to an extreme. The routines are too limited to make a significant difference for anyone with a normal range of motion. And, I mean ANYONE. Even if you have never practiced Yoga before, you will release more tension from your back with another general introductory Yoga practice, whether or not it is not back-focused.

I also did not like the way that instruction was organized for the video. There is a long separate section on the science of back health and movement, but during the exercise routines, there is very little commentary, telling you only the basic movements. I prefer to be told about the benefit of movements and get tips on proper alignment, while I am doing the exercise.

I'm still giving it three stars, because for someone with limited motion, it could help, but I suspect the audience for this is pretty limited. Most people whose range of motion is so limited that they benefit from these routines should only be working out with the close supervision of an instructor or physical therapist.",1423008000,3,1504,4.87109375

When I started increasing the frequency of these workouts past 2 times per week, my shoulder and neck pain got worse.

By attentively doing these as instructed, you will receive the best benefit and shouldn't injure yourself. That said, if you have a back condition, review with a physical therapist who's familiar with that condition what you should and shouldn't be doing.

4009411,3,B002XOG4GA,"My doctor suggested this program for me because I have Lupus, and some cervical spine disc degeneration. I found the video extremely informative, however for an absolute yoga beginner like me, I thought it wasn't easy to follow. I did just the intro poses for a solid week the best I could and I still couldn't get through them. It was too strenuous and too complicated.
Also the menu and navigation was really difficult to use.
I think if this author did a series that was geared towards people like me who are started from ground zero (and REALLY not mobile) it would be awesome. Baby steps really, is what I needed, and to me this felt like hitting the ground running, something I am sure most people who are in my condition couldn't do either.
For example, the kneeling poses; I can't rest on my knees. Also, with arthritis in my joints, putting my arms behind my back makes my should joints ""clunk"". My neck won't turn in the direction required for 80% of the poses. If the author (whom I felt was great) would work with people in my condition to develop a regimen for the severe cases like me, it would be fantastic, because I feel strongly I would benefit from being able to do these poses, however I just can't get there. I felt like there was a missing step. For someone with a chronic, debilitating illness, I would consider this program as a ""moderate"" workout, and I wish it was ""mild"". One could move up to this one, if they had another stepping stone first.",1410048000,12,1471,4.451851851851852

Gradually the pain has faded and in 4 weeks I am sleeping through the night. The various aches and pains from fibromyalgia have also been much less intense.

The pain was so extreme that I had trouble taking deep breaths and I was popping Advil in order to get through the day. I went  to a chiropractor often, however the relief was only temporary. Once I got back to life (picking up my adorable 4 year old or carrying groceries) the pain came back. I've been searching for a long time for a way to self manage my back and muscle it as well.  Then I found 2 amazing ways to do this: 1st I bought an SKLZ TRAINER ROLLER (which is an incredible product, check it out) and then I bought these 2 dvds. The trainer roller massages and works through the tension I have in my back and then the 2 dvds continue the work by safely strengthening the whole back area.  Gary Kraftsow explains very well the different positions and each movement is specifically targeted to help with back pain. All of this has truly changed my life.",1395014400,3,961,4.269230769230769

My biggest issue with the dvd is that it is pretty long. I was looking for a 30 minute/day stretching program and each dvd has about 90 minutes of exercises/stretches. I also have not been fully motivated to do this daily due to time constraints. Ultimately I just hope to learn some stretches that I can do on my own without continually watching a video.

The very first day I did the back/hip workout I was pain-free.  Slept very well that night like I had not in a long time.

4009435,5,B002XOG4GA,"I bought this set for my husband mostly, but I have long standing moderate back pain from an injury I sustained early in my nursing career.  My husband has severe back pain.  We both are over weight, he by about 50 pounds and myself by 80 pounds.  I have done other yoga videos which helped a little and seemed to prevent reinjury, but I only finally got him to agree to try yoga last week.  As soon as he said he would try, I bought this set.

We did the lower back set last night.  It is around 30 minutes (the lower back video has 3 sets, all around 30 minutes, one is the lower back, one is the hips, and one is a strengthening set) and was pretty easy, even for two fat, pretty out of shape people.  My husband had a lot of pain yesterday, more than usual, so there were some exercises he could not do.  I was having some mild spasms, but I was able to complete all the exercises.  After the video, I immediately felt more relaxed and my pain and spasms were gone.  My back also popped several times during the workout and continued to pop as I moved around after the workout- it was like everything was just loosening up.  I slept great and woke up this morning to no back pain.  I usual have some tenderness in my lower back, even just with touching it, but this morning I had none of that.  I am very excited to do the rest of the videos over the next few days.

My husband still had pain last night, but he said his back also felt looser and was cracking.  He will probably take a few more workouts before he has no pain, but this video seems to be money well spent.

So, it's not fair to give these good DVD's a bad rating just because I'M not ready yet.
I look forward to when I can use them because I felt they were easy to use, the poses were explained thoroughly (you can hit a button on your remote to take you to an explanation of the pose, if needed).
I read many reviews on this site, and other sites, and this set is highly recommended.  I took a few yoga classes before getting injured, and these poses are easy to do (you shouldn't worry about losing your balance and falling over like I have in classes).
When I ""graduate"" from water therapy and can do these DVD's more thoroughly I'll probably be back to give them 5 stars.  But since I was unable to see all of them, I'll leave it at 4 stars for now (but don't take that as a negative).",1383091200,6,1029,4.0

Once in a while my low back starts to nag at me again and I bring out the DVD for a week or so.

Very simple stretches, repeated more quickly than I was used to in a yoga routine, but helped greatly! The simpleness of them and the repetition is the key, I think.
