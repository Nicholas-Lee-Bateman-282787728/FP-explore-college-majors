7886176,5,6305251452,"now this was awesome, watching captain America pretty much the only solo captain America cartoon pretty much ever made, all the other tv shows is the avengers and captain America is on that or he guest stars in a spider man or x-men cartoon once in a while.
I really can not understand why they don't make a captain America cartoon series, or at least re-make this one seeing how good it is and how many people like it.
They made a freaking aquaman, plastic man or whatever his name is, new x-men, wolverine, new hulk, new iron man all these new cartoons of so many characters and superheroes now and yet they still have not made a captain America cartoon even though he is the leader of the avengers and the ONLY hero that represents America truthfully like come on they really need a captain America cartoon now a days, its only fair, no not that, its overdue.",1393459200,,862,4.427672955974843

7886179,5,6305251452,"I agree with the description of the animation by the previous reviewer.  It is simple by today's standards.  However, it's based on the original artwork of Jack Kirby - my all-time favorite comic artist!  Even in ""freeze-frame"" more action is conveyed than most current shows.

To be fair, these shows have a special place in my heart.  I used to get up at 6:30 am on Saturday mornings to watch re-runs of this series (I was was watching in the 80's).  I was absolutely over the moon when they re-released these about the same time my first son was born.  Anyway, enough about me.

I disagree that moderns kids won't get into these shows.  All three of my kids (ages 7,5,3) LOVE these videos - Captain American, Sub-Mariner, Thor, & Ironman.  In fact, the cheesy theme-songs are an often requested sing-alongs in the car.  They even like the Stan Lee introductions!  My kids watch some of the current animated shows on Saturdays (like Batman and Spiderman) and still enjoy these oldies.

So, I would say no these are not just for die-hard fans or collectors.  They still hold up because they are built on stories that literally built the modern comic industry and still grab kids like they 40 years ago.",1228780800,,1203,4.639810426540285
7886180,3,6305251452,"This video is a ""new"" release of portions of the 1966 TV series ""Marvel Super Heroes"" and features portions of two episodes.  The first episode on the tape is ""Origin of Captain America"" which is  an animated version of ""Tales of Suspense"" # 63 & 64 from  Mar/Apr 1965.  The second episode is ""Origin of the Red Skull""  which includes material from ""Tales of Suspense"" # 66-68,  June/Aug 1965.  Essentially the actual panels from these comic books are  crudely animated -- but the original Lee script and Kirby art remains.  The  voice characterizations and dialogue are top notch, but the animation is  just zooms and pans of static panels with lips and limb movements animated.  These videos were released twice before by Prism Entertainment in 1985 and  Best Film and Video in 1992.  I must point out that modern kids don't like  these videos, and they are more suitable for purchase by a superhero comic  book fan.  Fox could have found a broader market had these videos been  released in a box set with historical notes.  The identities of all the  voice actors are not known, but I can recognize Bernard Cowen's and Paul  Soles' voices in the mix.  The original tv show began with the theme song  of the ""Merry Marvel Marching Society"" and contained a three  segment serial format with recaps in parts two and three.  The opening  M.M.M.S. theme is missing but the Captain America theme remains (""When  Captain America throws his mighty shield..."")  The recaps and title  cards of segments two and three are edited out in this release.  But at  least the print is clearly transferred and the sound is crisp and clean.",928195200,36,1623,4.73021582733813
