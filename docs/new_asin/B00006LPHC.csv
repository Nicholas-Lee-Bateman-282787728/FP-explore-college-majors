1785277,5,B00006LPHC,"I saw these excellent videos on a television special and loved what and how they taught me. Questions were answered that I wouldn't have know to ask. They use humor very well and make each series extremely enjoyable to learn from and watch. I purchased the tapes for a friend of mine who is pregnant for the first time. ALL FATHERS TO BE, MUST WATCH THIS TOO!",1046217600,3,359,4.373134328358209
1785298,1,B00006LPHC,"This DVD set truly is for dummies. It moves at a very slow pace, and gives the most basic information that you could just read in a concise pregnancy book in 1/5th the time. Worse than that, it shows the births of three women, and not one of them had a natural birth! All of them had epidurals- one ending up with forceps (as a result of the epidural, no doubt), and the other ending up with a c-section. So it gives you absolutely no demonstration of how to use relaxation, positions, breathing to make labor easier; and it doesn't teach anything about how transition between 1st and 2nd stage labor is the hardest part where you feel like giving up and getting drugs but it only lasts for ten minutes. This DVD gives a woman no options- only to be drugged up! It was a truly sad representation of birth. Where can you get a pregnancy DVD that is neither overly-medical nor overly-new-agey? Why are people so polarized in this country? Are there no thinkers who can take the best of both worlds and use a variety of strategies to make for a wonderful birth?",1185408000,,1058,4.403061224489796
1785299,1,B00006LPHC,"I paid for all four episodes of this series and when I went to watch the fourth installment, it was the exact same episode as the 1st Trimester. Boo.",1183593600,,149,4.172413793103448
1785300,4,B00006LPHC,"I thought this video was super cute and I think a few of the negative reviews are being too harsh. It is corky and not a perfect video but it's supposed to be educational with a funny twist. Noone out there expecting should just depend on just one source for information. If you want to laugh and smile and still learn a lot about pregnancy period...than get it! It's worth. Although, it doesn't serve much purpose after the baby because there's really no information on how to take care your baby for years to come. This is strictly a pregnancy tape. Enjoy.",1172448000,,558,4.480392156862745
1785301,2,B00006LPHC,"Although I like ""Wendy"" and a lot of the information presented for the prenatal and postpartum sections of the video I found L&D the information lacking. It lacked a since of empowerment of the mother and father. This is after all their birth! It didn't show any ideas for comfort measures. It didn't give the risk of the hospital procedures or options to avoid them.

It gives ALL the responsibility and credit to the doctors. I found that sad. A real education goes much deeper than teaching you how to be a good patient.",1131580800,2,523,4.5638297872340425
1785302,1,B00006LPHC,"WHAT THE??? This ""for dummies"" series has gone TOO FAR...this series caters to so many different topics over the years, it's clear to me now that the ""dummy"" is now the majority. Things today are so dumbed-down, broken-down, pre-masticated, cutesy-fied and sanitized for your protection, nobody does any THINKING anymore....Doesn't sound like the type you want to encourage to get PREGNANT, does it? Not to me....

I saw this book being given at a baby shower and it just made me blow a fuse. THIS TITLE SHOULD NOT EXIST!! Dummies, or anyone who would feel the least bit comfortable bearing such a description IS UNFIT to be a parent, LET ALONE become PREGNANT!!! Please, please do society a favor and EDUCATE YOURSELF....just WITHOUT using material that panders to idiots....ideally BEFORE you get pregnant!! If these conditions continue for much longer, you just may force the government's hand into mandating parenting licenses!!!

Now, getting beyond the title...About the material: A good portion of the ""information"" was stuff I learned from ""that particular mandatory class"" from high school....meaning: STUFF YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW!! The rest can be very easily obtained at the doctor's office (where you should already be going anyhow) and there is more information about pregnancy than you'd know what to do with at most local libraries...that is IF you read above a grade-school level....Something that posessing or reading this book would suggest otherwise!!!",1129075200,,1472,5.286324786324786
1785303,3,B00006LPHC,"This DVD or VHS presentation is cute and has some good basic information.  There are some definite biases presented that could flavor the way expectant parents see childbirth.  Twice, information is given and it is not accurate to 2002.  These two pieces of information include the mechanism of episiotomy and the rate of cesarean section.  The DVD informs parents that the lack of an episiotomy may cause tears, when research shows evidence to the opposite.  And the cesarean section is presented at 20% when in reality, it is more like 25%.  Unfortunately there is no reference to the power that women have to raise their pain tolerance through comfort measures, all women are shown to labor in bed and no mother pushes in an upright position.  Not a surprise that all 3 women shown op for an epidural, two have oxygen and one has a cesarean.",1110672000,5,844,4.739726027397261
1785304,5,B00006LPHC,"My brother and his wife are expecting for the first time, so I thought it would be nice to send them this DVD collection.  I don't have any children, but (after waching the DVD's first) I thought the entire series was AMAZING!!  The mothers-to-be, fathers-to-be, doctors and ""Wendy"" were all extremely helpful in describing what happens during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd trimesters, the actual childbirth process & the first three months after childbirth.  A ""must-see"" for all expecting mothers and fathers!!",1105228800,8,500,5.148148148148148
1785305,4,B00006LPHC,"I find this DVD a valuable resource for expectant parents.  It covers all the basics plus many practical issues not included in traditional childbirth preparation classes.  The section about life at home with a new baby and adjustment to parenthood is excellent. It can be too cute at times in the cartoon segments, so concentrate on the message instead of the messenger.",1073692800,10,371,4.967741935483871

7971658,5,B00006LPHC,"A fun, but informative series that gives you important information in a basic and straight forward way. Wish they would do a new version with the most up to date info.",1461715200,,167,4.419354838709677

7971660,5,B00006LPHC,Thank you so much!  I was bummed when I seen how long it would estimate to come from June 2nd to 17th.  I was sooooo happy when I seen it in the mail today!!!!!!  I would Definitely order for this person again!  Thank you so much Hun!,1401321600,,234,3.9148936170212765
7971661,5,B00006LPHC,The DVD set worked well. It provided a lot of insight into the ins and outs of pregnancy. I am one day away from my scheduled C-section and feel as prepared as I can.,1375142400,,166,3.911764705882353
7971662,5,B00006LPHC,"I saw this video a while back ago on a premium channel. I liked this video because it was informative on what a woman can expect while pregnant. It talks about the basics of what changes will be happening to the mother, child, and father. i.e. (morning sickness, swelling ancles, heartburn, ultrasound, invasive & non-invasive testing....) This is basic info and lacks a little in the different ways to give birth outside of a hospital, but overall I liked this video for answering my basic questions and showing how things work once you bring baby home. I am very happy that the video even arrived earlier than predicted.",1318464000,,622,4.768518518518518
7971663,1,B00006LPHC,"I purchased this piece of  cr@$% on amazon video, I was looking for something more National Geographic style, something that could educate me about mychild's week by week development. so far I have seen way better material around and for free... if you would like to drugged yourself to death this is a good one but if you are a good parent and want to nurture your child with love and compassion during their 1st and most important day of your lives DO NOT BUY THIS there are way much better material around starting with the business of being born, birth as we know it... etc

this video highly advocates drugs and c sections.... these babies so far seem unhealthy and unrealistic situations...  these ""Ob GYN"" doctors need way updated information...

I wish I could give this DVD  0 stars",1294444800,,825,4.734265734265734
7971664,4,B00006LPHC,"I found the video very useful and interesting, but it didn't cover every question that you might have about pregnancy and delivery.  It covers all the basic information that you get in paper handouts and doctor instructions, but the video format makes it easier to see and understand.",1237593600,,284,4.916666666666667
7971665,5,B00006LPHC,This dvd is great for first time mums that don't understand the medical mumbo jumbo. It explians everything in great communication. I loved this dvd don't care what other people say about it but I love it.,1219708800,,205,4.5675675675675675
