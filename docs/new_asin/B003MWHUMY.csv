4156217,5,B003MWHUMY,I've been waiting for a more comprehensive account of Basquiat's life and real footage from lost interviews. This documentary is a true time capsule.  I loved every second of it. Kudos to Tamra for paying homage to her friend.  I'm happy to have this in my collection.  Basquiat's work should continue to be celebrated for years to come.,1290124800,,337,4.775862068965517
4156218,5,B003MWHUMY,"I attended a screening of this film in Los Angeles, and was mesmerized throughout. Having grown up in NY during the 70s and 80s, the nostalgia factor alone made it interesting. I was a kid then, but I still knew who Basquiat was. It was hard to miss him, all the press and acclaim he was getting. But, as such a young person, I was unable to grasp the impact he was having on the art world at the time, and could have no foresight as to how he would affect it in the days to come. This film provided plenty of that, and acts as an exhibition in itself, as the viewer is able to see so many of the artist's works in one sitting. It was, for this casual fan, a joy to behold, and clearly a labor of love by Ms. Davis. As informative as I found the film to be about the man and the artist, I saw a larger impact in the rise of the contemporary street artist. If Basquiat was a somewhat tortured soul, and struggled with his fame and success once it started to happen, one must wonder what he would think of his modern contemporaries such as Shepherd Fairey and Banksy, who are clearly in his debt. Perhaps, viewed in parallel with EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP, we can appreciate him and the film even more.
I loved this film, and hearing some of the punk/dance/hip hop of the era was an added treat. In so many ways, and, as with many other films created of that era, NYC plays a unique character, and maybe we lost that character along with great artists such as the radiant child, Basquiat. I'm now going to work on saving a couple of million dollars to buy one of his paintings.",1288656000,4,1576,4.170491803278688
4156219,5,B003MWHUMY,"I saw this film today and it was the most brillant body of work that I've seen in quite some time. It just built on all the things that I already knew about Jean-Michel. The interviews were very insightful and moving. Beauty, Art, Tragedy, and Fame all wrapped into one. I loved it from start to finish. They say nobody loves a genius child but if you are a fan of Basquiat or just curious about his life in any way...do not hesitate to purchase this film.",1284940800,9,456,4.252873563218391
4156220,2,B003MWHUMY,"""Jean-Michael Basquiat: The Radiant Child"" has the look of a scrappy documentary you might see on PBS' ""Independent Lens."" Sit down interviews, good archival footage, nice use of music and so on. But the more you watch - beyond being tortured by the truly horrific sound editing in this film - the more you have to wonder, is this really the truth or a tepid whitewash? After watching the film all the way through, I'd go 60/40 with tepid whitewash tipping the balance. The most serious problem with this film is that major parts of Basquiat's life that likely informed his art - his serious drug addiction which killed him at 27, the racism he experienced in the 80s art world,  his clear-eyed and brazen ambition, his bi-sexuality, and his tortured relationship with his father - are given short shrift. While Basquiat may have been a ""radiant child,"" he could also be a thin-skinned brat who alienated many with his unreasonable and likely drug-distorted demands. Most in the art world are willing to forgive that because of his formidable talent and the powerful humanity that he bought to his art. But I wish the filmmaker would have been more embracing of the complexity of his life and push harder for more truthful answers from its subjects, many of whom come of as evasive and even slightly dishonest at times. By the end of this film I could not help but feel that everyone - including the filmmaker - was hiding something for fear that the truth about Jean-Michel Basquiat might not reflect well on him. But that's the deal with documentary. It's not always pretty but that doesn't mean you don't address basic truths openly and directly. Even with these complaints, however, this film is still worth seeing because it's likely the only one that will feature those who knew him well.",1280880000,53,1794,4.75
4156221,4,B003MWHUMY,"We saw Tamra Davis' Basquiat documentary at the 2010 Dallas International Film Festival.  For those of us who've seen and enjoyed Julian Schnabel's very good 1996 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Basquiat/dp/B000065V3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Basquiat</a>&nbsp;(featuring an outstanding turn by Jeffrey Wright in the title role), Davis' work is a good companion piece.  For those of you who've not seen Schnabel's film, ""The Radiant Child"" serves as a good intro to both Basquiat's work and to the man who laid behind the ever-growing myth.

Davis was a friend and contemporary of Jean-Michel Basquiat.  She had the stroke of fortune (and the insight) to record a series of interviews with him at the height of his art-world popularity.  Though the production value of those interviews is relatively poor, they're fascinating and serve as the core of the film.  They pierce the aura of Basquiat the artist and growing legend to reveal his inherent fragility, his soft-spoken nature and the increasing burden of living up to the 'Basquiat' mystique/brand he created.

The other interviews painstakingly compiled by Davis add flavor and flesh out the re-telling, but it's Basquiat's own words and haunting image that will stick with you.  I especially liked Basquiat's comment that not a single line or stroke in his works was by accident.  This is backed up by one of the interviewees who noted the immediate appeal of Basquiat's work: that he had a unique hand, i.e., one which crafted a line that could only be produced by him.  Davis also does a great job producing tales and evidence of the artist's prodigious work ethic and output.  In his comet-like career, he produced over 1,500 pieces of work.  Davis captures compelling tales of friends and clients showing up at his apartment and finding every surface - walls, refrigerator, other appliances - filled with imagery from his fervent brain.",1276300800,36,1948,5.3927392739273925

4156228,5,B003MWHUMY,"I knew nothing of this artist except having seen his work hanging in an art museum. This documentary tells his story from childhood through his death. One thing I didn't like was a fair amount of narration was done via subtitle not auditory and the words flashed up too fast and went away too quickly. This includes footage shot by a friend who was an amateur filmmaker, this footage was put away upon his death, and not looked at until years later. The movie incudes showing a lot of his finished pieces, I wish the shots of that were longer, it went too fast. This is worth a rewatch for a second or third time. SInce his death was related to depression and drug addiction those topics are covered. I found the discussion and issues relating to the propping up of an Afircan American artist in the post-CIvil Rights era interesting with the issue of what happens when a person rises to quick fame and then society moves on to the next celebrity of the year, not unlike the plight of so many child actors and today's one hit wonder pop stars...how do they adjust and go on after living the high life when their work is no longer receiving accolades. So there is more here than eye candy artwork and creative inspiration, it's also a tragic tale and one that reveals the celebrity culture that is actually an even bigger issue today than it was in the 1980s and even the 1990s.

4156244,5,B003MWHUMY,"This is an achingly beautiful film about an extraordinary artist. I felt completely drawn into the time and place: NYC in the late 70s and on into the 80s when Basquiat was producing his work. I only recently discovered this artist--I don't know how I missed him!!--, and being a huge fan of abstract expressionism, I was instantly drawn to his art. One commentator in the film puts it very well: Basquiat challeneged us to analyse our culture anew through his brilliant and intuitive combination of elements, his use of language and his originality.

What most impressed me was Basquiat's authenticity: it seemed impossible for him to put on different social faces. He was sincerely himself at all times--wide open, vulnerable, honest, angelic. I cried at the end of the film because he wasn't able to survive the terrible twenties (he died at age 27) and for all the extraordinary beauty that he created.",1428710400,6,906,4.883116883116883

Money rules and becomes the downfall to the sensitive demeanor of many, including this very special, original and skillful contemporary young man -artist extraordinaire.

4156258,5,B003MWHUMY,"Jean-Michel Basquiat lived a short life and painted prolifically during his brief and brilliant career at a unique period in the ""art world"" of New York during the late 70s to early 80s.
He rose to meteoric fame and became a darling of the ""industry"" and at the same time was side-lined and viewed as an outsider. He was the quintessential scribe for his time, and his work is incredibly loose and lucid at the same time.
This film contains mainly interviews with personal friends and associates, and with the painter himself, and (best of all) film of him painting.
 This provides clearer insight into his mind, challenges and influences, and brought me a much wider and deeper appreciation of his work and his development as a painter. His strongest work, in my opinion is his later work, and after watching this, it is even more real than ever that his contribution is unequalled.
 We are left with the feeling that although afflicted, his short life burned brightly with an unusual  luminosity that is rare and leaves us feeling that he was indeed (possibly) the most influential painter of the 21st century.

4156266,4,B003MWHUMY,"Tamra Davis created this documentary about her friend, the famous (or infamous) graffiti artists Jean-Michel Basquiat, (December 22, 1960 - August 12, 1988).  The obvious love for the artist is evident in the manner Davis put together this series of interviews with those who knew him, sold his works, wrote about him, or were part of his large social entourage - Julian Schnabel, Larry Gagosian, Bruno Bischofberger, Tony Shafrazi, Fab 5 Freddy, Jeffrey Deitch, Glenn O'Brien, Maripol, Kai Eric, Nicholas Taylor, Fred Hoffmann, Michael Holman, Diego Cortez, Annina Nosei, Suzanne Mallouk, and Rene Ricard.  Davis also includes some rather in depth discussions and demonstrations by sharing his many works which many (including Davis) declare were the zenith of Neoexpressionism in America.  The problem with the film as a film is the quality of camera work and editing: it is a bumpy ride.  But as far as a collection of statements from Basquiat himself it is a treasure. It is hard to believe that he was one of the first popular black artists to draw international acclaim.  Unfortunately the rigors of his public persona and the drugs that accompanied that resulted in his far too early death.  His place in art history is secure, but at a terrible price. Grady Harp, May 11",1304294400,2,1278,5.004716981132075
4156267,4,B003MWHUMY,"In 1974 or so I knew of the graffiti artists in New York. When I could I went to look. Somehow I learned along in here of Basquait. He was radiant. Do you know this brought to mind Charlotte's Web when she wove radiant into the web.
And in the early 1980's the art world for an east coast art student was pulsating. His images were so raw.
So it was a rare treat to see this movie today via TV. I had no idea that one of Baquiat's love relationships kept this footage that she made from interviewing him -hid it away all this time to bring him back, and within this to show his image making on the screen, his life, it was good to see it existed. I learned and remember a lot. The strangest things struck me. Like how you could get space then, I rented a huge studio space in my town-space now costs too much for a poor kid. Just recalled what it took to make art then.

This summer I read Patti Smith talking of her relationship with Maplethorpe, and it flashed in my mind that here was another person, in essentially an artistic relationship revealed years later that allowed me to glimpse an artist I admired- but never would really know. You wonder about his genius. Like one looks and looks at the dragonfly in the jar hovering and so utterly perfect. Yet frighteningly alien. You watch, but coming to understanding is elusive. The times are so different now to me, and that awareness is almost collapsing to realize, but it comes forward as the film goes along.

There are great synopsis here to read of the film. I liked it for showing his work, his working, talking a bit about his relationships. His descent. His pain. Dealings with Warhol. Certainly I watched Julian Schnabel's work on Basquiat. How great to add this to that. Several times over i could say how grateful I am I caught this and this was shot at the time, kept and finally shared.  I was always fascinated by his mark, by the variety of symbol, by his references. I admit to wanting to buy a catalog of all the work and spend a long time alone with it. It made me aware of how much he connected in the times he lived. Darn it was tragic. He lived such a short time. His work was amazing. And I think about the things he was offering in images, if you watch the relationship of his life to his making enters in a bit....insightful. Lots of losses in those years, to drugs, to AIDS. One of my closest friend's , an artist, lost to AIDS...tragic times and that got caught in Basquait for me.

Against the recent death of a cousin, early 30's who took her life, saying her artistic life was taken from her and it brought her wish for death now, (conforming to family wishes to live the life of a scientist), I contemplated this artist. Feelings of my own came forward about the relationship of construction and destruction...Tellers of truth, seers of what we are, those that roam in the darker places, artist's are so brave and alternately so vulnerable. It was clear from this what this world can do to its artists...it's visionaries. And he was so driven. What we let our artists carry-it has been very toxic in my times. Very painful. I understand art in these terms.  Once I thought his pictures compelled you to look, but yet they were so hard to see.
And then I lose what I'm meant to resolve to say....sorry I am not an articulate person. I never was.

It was great to see the footage, I don't want to know his intimate inner world in more depth, his relationships, not so much. I want this person to keep that from our eyes. I averted in moments when i feared it would do that. I do think this did not strip all of that baring the bones. The footage of his painting, it was worth the watching alone. Like gazing on his ghost. Or his work alive again.",1302998400,4,3730,4.313837375178316

4156271,4,B003MWHUMY,"This, admittedly, is not the place to go for a balanced, critical look at Jean-Michel Basquiat.

Tamra Davis, the director, was a friend of his and she's made a movie about her friend.

I'm personally perfectly fine with that -- there are books and there are articles and there are plenty of other sources you can draw from if you want hard criticism, of either the man's life or his work.

What ""The Radiant Child"" does (on the other hand) is present Basquiat's life and work from a familiar perspective, in a conducive context. While I personally would like at some point to see the drawings and paintings in a slower, more reflective framework, I really dug how Davis incorporates well-chosen music with art, a giddy montage, and wraps it around a narrative of his life as told by his cohorts.

The movie also drops you into a scene -- specifically downtown, early 80s -- that is depicted with authority and with an overall vibe I could buy. It feels right, it sounds right, it knows the turf.

If you want a critical evaluation of how good he actually was or wasn't, this isn't the place to start. But it's a good beginner's sampler.
