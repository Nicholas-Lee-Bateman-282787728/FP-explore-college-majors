I have since found it online and have watched it there and enjoyed the firm.  I had seen it on AMC late one night which is why I wanted to order it as I only saw about half the movie that night.  I did not realize it would not play here until about a week after I ordered it.

Rossellini is a master filmmaker and this film is extremely believable as Zeffirelli's films are.  Although being filmed in Italy and spoken in Italian, it hardly distracts from the enjoyment of the film.

I'm so glad I stumbled on this film from my local vintage video store and can finally see Plato's diologues of Socrates come to life!

Excellent!",1245628800,12,478,4.710843373493976
