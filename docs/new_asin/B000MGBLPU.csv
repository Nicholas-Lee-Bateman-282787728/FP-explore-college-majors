2730510,4,B000MGBLPU,"I thought this movie was very good!  Doris Day is an excellent actress and always fits into any role.  She can do comedy as well as dramatic acting, and also relived the true stories of Ruth Etting in ""Love Me or Leave Me,"" Grover Cleveland's wife in ""The Winning Team,"" and now the lyricist Gus Kahn's wife in this movie.  Danny Thomas does a fine job playing Gus Kahn.  Here is an important quote from the movie that Gus Kahn made that stuck with me long after I finished watching the movie: ""People today do not know how to say I love you, so I am writing the words for them from my heart.""",1335657600,,593,4.175438596491228
2730511,3,B000MGBLPU,"early career without the perfect hair, teeth, and hmmmm, overdramatic tones is my preference for Doris Day... Danny Thomas a german? the cigar smoke routine and other annoying forced farce quite annoying, but the music!!!  still singing that See You in My Dreams all day and guess Gus Kahn's lyrics a bit player vs the scores... feel good, revival and much stand by your side characterization... try to deflect the aging process blips and chronology questions, the ending brings a tear or two and leaves you desiring eternity for talent.",1333756800,,537,4.966666666666667
2730512,3,B000MGBLPU,"It's difficult to review this movie as I'm a fan of both Director Michael Curtiz and the beautiful Doris Day.

This is only the second Danny Thomas film I've screened - not like there was a lot in the cupboard to choose from. If my read on his IMDb Profile is correct, he only did five motion pictures in his entire career, the remainder of his thirty years in show business was on the small screen. Which explains much.

This was a good story which should've been a vehicle that helped the careers of both lead actors. But, it seems to me at least, Danny Thomas isn't a film actor of note. Portraying real-life songwriter Gus Kahn, he seems too common, too average to be believable. I'm not suggesting that, say, Tyrone Power would've been a better choice. Obviously, the role called for a lead who had a homespun edge to him, a street quality that the average guy could relate to and with; an experienced actor with range, a John Garfield-type of performer. But the studio and producer went with an actor who just doesn't have ""it"" - that intangible movie leading man presence. It felt like Thomas was overwhelmed - the screen too large for what his type of personality delivers.

I'm not saying he was bad in the role, but 'adequate' is hardly the hallmark of excellence, or a good movie.

And what made it more unbalanced was just how good Day was in her role as Grace LeBoy. That sparkling aura, the perfect mix of tender innocence blended with just the right touch of unspoken worldliness. It made the contrast between these two quite stark and completely insurmountable; you just never believe that she would fall for such a schmuck. And that undeniable juxtaposition makes it impossible to fully enjoy the film. You can tell Doris is really trying, Danny too, but that all important on-screen chemistry just isn't there. That magic is most disappointingly noticeable in the ""Making Whoppee"" scene, that could've and should've been something so very special, but it came off as overly staged and flat. Sincerely, in my honest opinion, this was a tragic lost opportunity for movie audiences. Think of how we recall duos that are written into our culture and hearts: Maurice Chevalier and Hermione Gingold's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Remember-It-Well/dp/B001BHI0JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Remember It Well</a>"" or Fred & Ginger's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-s-Call-The-Whole-Thing-Off/dp/B0009NSCQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let's Call The Whole Thing Off</a>"" --- *that* is what we lost.

There are a few good moments. When Gus is down on his luck, the Crash of '29 wiping out his earnings and nearly finding himself and his family on the streets; his pride unwilling to admit he could use a hand. The interplay between the stars seems genuine, as if we were privy to an intimate domestic scene between Gus and Grace. But those moments are sparse, too little and too infrequent to carry an entire film.

Finally, a knock against direction. It's a small knock, but a very noticeable one. What bothered me was the lack of transitions between time periods. Director Curtiz did not clearly define what we were viewing in terms of the ""when"". I was stunned that at one point in the film it appears to be the late-1910's, next thing, it's suddenly The Great Depression. And the entire cast, for all intents and purposes, never age - despite the fact that this film spans nearly fifty years. Their clothes, hairstyles, speech and everything else - almost nothing evolves. It becomes even more confusing when the children are in the picture. During the Depression the kids are about 8-10 years old, but by the end of the film, years after WWII, they're still only teenagers. Wha?

So-so film made watchable solely to the wonderful screen presence of Doris Day and her truly gifted voice.

Personal note: I tried to locate the version of ""I'll See You In My Dreams"" as sung in the film; however, to the best of my knowledge, it does not exist. It's forcing me to learn how to edit a DVD such that the resulting edited MP4 will play as both a music video and song on my iPod.

Her on-screen version of this song is beyond words; something truly amazing and splendiferous.",1312156800,,4267,4.973352033660589

2730514,3,B000MGBLPU,I don't care what the critics have said about this movie. Doris Day is a powerhouse pushing the career of Gus Kahn ( Danny Thomas)until he is finally recognized as a popular songwriter. Thomas is believable as the cigar smoking lyricist who doubts his own talent. Mary Wickes as the Kahns'maid provides great support with her synical wit and devotion to the family.

""Dream a Little Dream"" and many, many others is presented in a Hollywoodified version that made me want to know who the real Gus was.

2730575,5,B000MGBLPU,"I saw this movie years ago. I am a BIG Music fan. Musicals, Broadway, Movies with Big Band to Country music. I especially Love Biographies on the Musical Geniuses that brought all the Great Music to Us throughout History. AMADEUS to BENNY GOODMAN to JOHNNY CASH, up to Today's Multi-talented Songwriters. Movies with music and singing and dancing. ALL OF IT. This story of GUS KAHN a Lyricist who wrote/cowrote beautiful Love Songs like - IT HAD TO BE YOU, LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME, MAKIN' WHOOPEE. This Movie was full of wonderful, memorable songs that just sent my Musical Heart into a whirl. Even tho they were way before my time - you Can't Beat the Greats - I was right there singing along.  DANNY THOMAS plays Gus Kahn and Doris Day plays his dedicated supportive wife, whom he writes many of his Love songs for. Danny Thomas n Doris Day, whom I've remained a Huge fan since a kid (FYI - I always wanted to Sing and Look like Doris Day).  The Movie goes
through Gus Kahns ups and downs in the music publishing industry. Danny Thomas and Doris Days light-hearted - serious performances showed off their Star Qualities. Then When Doris Day Sings.... well - there You Are. Need I say More? It's a warm and touching movie. Full of romantic music and plenty of moments where you are yelling for the under dog to come out on top. Where You will Wish you could write songs as beautiful as Gus Kahn .You will Love it! I had to Own It. Thanks to Amazon I Do Now. The movie is in black and white, even tho the DVD Cover is in color. Excellent quality and sound. Looks great on large screen.

2730577,3,B000MGBLPU,"I loved the beginning of this movie and I liked the end of it, but the rest not so much.  The movie starts out really good with Doris Day meeting Danny Thomas, and the scene with both his and her parents I loved! then, the movie got irritating to me.  Doris Day works tirelessly trying to get Danny Thomas's career going and gets nothing in return, but a bunch of cigar smoke blown in her face and ordered around.  Day keeps patiently waiting for Thomas to make a romantic move on her for years, which he finally does, but the romance left something to be desired.  This role seemed out of character for Day being too subservient.  The movie later picks up when Thomas finally becomes famous for his music writing; and he finally thanks his devoted wife Day for all she did to make his career a success. I really liked the end with him thanking Day, and showing their children. I Love The Movies ""On Moon Light Bay , And By The Light Of The Silvery Moon, with Day and Gordon Mcrae , and when they had two of the same songs from these movies put in this movie, I hated that !  Over all the movie was sweet, but not my favorite Day movie.  Rebecca",1424131200,,1145,4.224770642201835

2730594,4,B000MGBLPU,"Doris Day is always good in everything she's in and her performance as the ""woman behind the man"" is good in a typically lightweight musical. The way it implied infidelity--a moment done hurtfully even though it was in song--was unusual, though it had to follow with a syrupy moment that was emotionally fake, but true to the time. (It's the screenplay--well, really, just the dated idea that every musical love story has to tell us that couples always faithful and in love by the last reel.)

Anyway, Doris Day is good as ever, a role model in the 1950s that still works today--feminine, poised, disciplined and sweet, but also self assured and assertive. (They imply she was controlling but that's hard to interpret given the ideas of the times and that she seemed to be the one with the sense. Also implied is that Kahn might have been physically abusive when the kids seem doubtful of his explanation for hitting mommy in the eye--then tell him that he never tells her he loves her. These, the infidelity moments, and the ""effects of fame"" added a little dramatic interest, but overall it was pretty predictable.)

Thomas was surprising--decent in the acting and with a good singing voice. Best of all, of course, and the reason for watching are the songs--no big production numbers, just Doris and/or Danny singing his music as his career develops. It's easy to forget the great Gus Kahn catalogue, including the title song, ""It Had to Be You"", ""Making Whoopee"" and ""Love Me or Leave Me"" and ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"". Most people don't remember Kahn anymore--this movie is a great way to keep his music alive.",1403308800,,1618,4.73404255319149
2730595,4,B000MGBLPU,I  enjoyed this it  is a movie I can watch when children are here  as it has family content and language  is  appropriate it does not present a life that is  unbelievable like people appearing  as one thing and turning into  other things and it shows how at one time people shared .  The Father image also  was  something abscent  in todays  world.,1399939200,,348,4.333333333333333
2730596,4,B000MGBLPU,"I do not know how accurate the portrayal of Gus Khan is or his wife Grace is.  I am assuming there is a basis for some truth. I am sure there could have been more depth than Hollywood portrayed.

Thank goodness I was born in the decade to see it first hand and now an have it on my shelf to enjoy in my later years.,1364256000,,418,4.073170731707317
2730605,4,B000MGBLPU,"Danny Thomas, he of the mighty beak, is known more for his television work than for his feature film career. I cut my teeth on reruns of MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY. On the silver screen Danny Thomas only ever starred in two prominent pictures, the 1952 remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jazz-Singer/dp/B003MJS3A0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jazz Singer</a>&nbsp;and 1951's I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS, which chronicles the life of Gus Kahn.

I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS falls in line with them old biopic treatments, laced with some truths but sweetened and fictionalized for public consumption. It boggles the mind just how prolific lyricist Gus Kahn was for decades. He put words to catchy tunes that became the rage of Tin Pan Alley and the flapper era, during them halcyon days of sheet music and phono records. In Chicago, Grace Le Boy (Doris Day) worked in a music store as a song demonstrator. It's at work that she first meets a persistent laborer named Gus Kahn (Thomas) who's come for her opinion regarding the raw stuff he'd penned. Grace is a bit reluctant and plenty put off by Mr. Kahn's pushy behavior. She's left lukewarm by his ambitious lyrics celebrating the Statue of Liberty and such. But she recognizes potential.

I don't know how much of the above sticks to facts. It's certainly a cute meet. And once Grace takes a gander at the hasty lyrics he'd scribbled down (she'd suggested that love songs were what sells), well, she's in for the long haul.

There's a bit of a jarring element in the way this movie shuffles time. We're barely alerted to when years elapse in the narrative. The plot follows a well-trodden path as we track the ups and downs of Gus's career and his sometimes rocky marriage with Grace. There are running sub-plots concerning Gus' inability to articulate his affection for his wife and also Grace's penchant for steering her husband's career, although the film is careful not to make Ms. Day seem too calculating and bossy. Both leads are fine performers and so natural in front of the camera. Doris Day's warm and sunny personality shines thru. But, at the time, it was Danny Thomas' seemingly off-the-cuff performance that was the revelation. There was nothing polished or ""rehearsed"" about him. He came off as a real guy. He and Day play off each other beautifully. Maybe they didn't happen in real life, but the heartfelt emotional beats between them cannot be devalued.

A film that depicts the life of Gus Kahn can only score big with its music. Kahn's lyrics are delightful. They trigger that resonating button. There's a reason his songs are timeless stuff. Thomas is perfectly disarming as he croons ""Pretty Baby"" and ""It Had to Be You."" His playful duet with Day in ""Makin' Whoopee"" is an absolute highlight. But my favorite number is Doris Day's sparkling, wistful rendition of ""The One I Love Belongs to Somebody Else."" She hits all the emotional chords with this tune. It ain't breaking news, but Doris Day sure has got some dulcet pipes. And while meant to convey a negative reaction, a down-and-out Gus' spoofy version of his own song, ""It had to Be You"" (titled ""Seven-Foot-Two""), made me grin. I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS proved to be one of 1951's biggest box office hits, Gus Kahn's impact and relevance extending yet another decade deep. Plenty but plenty of sweethearts owe much to this man. But can Gus Kahn find the courage to say ""I love you"" to his own girl? Sometimes, it's not enough to sing a song.",1363478400,4,3509,4.862876254180602
