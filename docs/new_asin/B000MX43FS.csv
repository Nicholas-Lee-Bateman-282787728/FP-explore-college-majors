8173241,2,B000MX43FS,"This is so bad that that, even though I have not finished watching it, I am already writing a review. A doctor that uses Faberware scissors to open up patients, and uses a pump for a blood transfusion?! They didn't even get the color of frog's blood right! I'll admit to something. This movie is better than other zombie movies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombie-Nation/dp/B000J10EQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombie Nation</a>&nbsp;comes to mind). For a low budget zombie movie, it was ok. If you watch this movie, which I hope you don't, you will somewhat enjoy the movie once the zombies overrun the hospital. I guess the biggest fault of this movie, aside from the pathetic acting, is the beginning of the film and the lack of good props. The zombies are not that bad, except when they talk, and then it all goes down the drain. Zombies should not talk, they should eat and that's it. But, in this film the doctor's wife has quite the long dialogue, and that is annoying.",1194393600,,1019,5.107784431137724
8173242,1,B000MX43FS,"Okay let start off by saying they use every knock off to promote this horrible movie. First the title then the whole plot of the movie is like Re-animator but a bad knock of the greatness of Re-Animator. It starts with a doctor bringing a dead frog back to life then it goes crazy so he kills it. This is how it starts really dumb not even funny. ThenHis wife and daughter dies and you know the rest of the story. This movie was painful to watch. Bad acting,bad script, and terrible effects. This movie offers nothing on all levels. I rented this trash and feel so rip off. Do youerself a favor and PASS on this terd bomb!! You will be a better person for it.",1183680000,,659,4.196850393700787
8173243,5,B000MX43FS,"Come to this movie with a sense of humor, with a love of zombie gore, and with an expectation to see an unabashed homage to such beloved genre greats as Night of the Living Dead, Return of the Living Dead, Shawn of the Dead, Reanimator, and perhaps a dash of Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. The zombie violence is deleriously over the top and the whole story plays out like a creepy but zany nightmare. Sex appeal is provided by the wife of the mad doctor (who becomes even sexier as a zombie) and his assistant's fiancee (well played by Joey Jalalian). Child actress Lola Forsberg is creepy fun in a kid-zombie role to compare to Kyra Schon in the original Night of the Living Dead. Five stars, five buckets of blood and five hammered frogs (gotta see the movie!) on my low budget fun scale.",1172448000,2,788,4.479166666666667
8173244,1,B000MX43FS,"If you happen to come across this abhorrent piece of trash in the rental store,run,do not walk. The only horror involved here is that this movie was even made. The acting was the worst I have seen in recent memory,the special effects look like someone ravaged a butcher shop dumpster,and there is no plot at all. A completely worthless hack film. I wouldnt have given this crap one star if there was a zero available.",1172448000,4,417,4.573333333333333
8173245,1,B000MX43FS,"Anyone who plans on renting this movie....DON'T DO IT! I beg you please! It comes off as a Re-Aminator but its not. The acting is painfull and where did the director find that woman. Its pathetic! Hey I love campy movies but this thing is just stupid. Its bad when the only good actress is about 5 years old. I maybe a little harsh on this thing but perhaps I'll take a shot of novicane and try it again. A quick synopsis,A lab dude finds a way to reincarnate dead tissue back to life. Zombies walk around killing people. HO-HUM.Throw it in the trash man.",1171324800,4,555,4.295238095238095
