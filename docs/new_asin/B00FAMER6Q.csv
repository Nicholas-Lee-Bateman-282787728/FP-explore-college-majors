8613813,4,B00FAMER6Q,"THESE DVD'S ARE VERY INTERESTING, HISTORICAL AND INFORMATIVE IF ONLY THEY WOULD PLAY ON YOUR TV. THEY DO PLAY ON MY COMPUTER SO ALL IS NOT LOST. I AM A EARLY F-1 NUT SO ENJOYED THE FERRARI AND LOTUS DVD'S THE MOST. THE OTHER TWO, ASTON-MARTIN AND MASSARITI ARE WELL WORTH WATCHING JUST DUE TO THEIR HISTORICAL VALUE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A RACE CAR NUT LIKE MYSELF. NOW, IF ONLY ""SPORTS CAR GRAPHIC"" MAGAZINE WOULD COME BACK!!!",1453420800,,428,4.5
