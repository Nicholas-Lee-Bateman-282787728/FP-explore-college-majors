It has a great part to help children who are afraid of storms.  Unfortunately, I agree with the other reviewer.  This is an outrageous price for a VHS tape.",1383523200,,289,4.2
8358286,1,B000N2D7KU,"Seriously $212 ? I bought two of these tapes last year for my babies because I loved this video as a child and sure enough they loved gerbert just as much, unfortunately our vcr ate up the last tape we had and I was hoping to purchase another but at the price of $212 I don't think so. We paid about 7$ each last year so what caused a price hike? Whenever yall come back to reality I would love to purchase this one :/",1363478400,2,418,3.929411764705882
