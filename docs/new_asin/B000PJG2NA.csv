8191957,3,B000PJG2NA,"Indeed, this short live concert video is an excerpt of a rarely seen film of the Atlanta Pop Festival featuring Jimi Hendrix, Santana, The Greatful Dead and many others.
Unfortunately, the video also does not include any of the said performers except Hendrix. Hendrix does play a full set and while the performance is great as is the film quality, it is the audio that suffers a bit since this is after all a ""BOOTLEG"" recording take from a broadcast on Japanese TV some time ago. Don't be mislead by my mention of the audio. The quality is really great and one can hear many rare songs performed by Hendrix at the time as well as hear and see bassist Billy Cox complement Jimi's guitar rocketing with his own bass bomb droppings. It's a trully double X performance in ATL!

I would also add that one purchase this DVD for the actual price of $19.99 and not anything higher than this.",1274572800,,884,4.490683229813665
