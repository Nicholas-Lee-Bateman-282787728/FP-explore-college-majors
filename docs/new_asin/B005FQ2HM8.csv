4684460,4,B005FQ2HM8,The Perfect Gift was indeed that.  Sometimes we need to give more of ourselves to our loved ones and this movie is a great depiction of what it could cost us.  I loved it.,1324252800,3,171,4.0
4684461,1,B005FQ2HM8,"this product was awful, I don't know what I expected but I was not pleased with this at all.  The dvd nore the sound track was worth the money and I want to give it back and get something else I will never give it to anyone to watch",1323648000,,232,3.7346938775510203
4684462,5,B005FQ2HM8,"As I've read the previous reviews, I can see where others come from.  But if you're tired of predictable plots and the same old same old like me, you will definitely like this one.  It kinda feels like your watching a sitcom.  My favorite was Darius McCray's character.  There's not as much music as the past ones but the songs in the play actually make sense when they sing them.  In other words, they don't stop in the middle of a scene or situation and bust out in song like most.  I expected Golden Brooks to throw down but Reuben shocked me with his acting skills. I liked this one and will definitely be watching with the fam this Christmas.",1323216000,3,647,4.35
4684463,5,B005FQ2HM8,"I am a play lover!!! I look for a lot of characteristics when I attend or watch plays. This one has it all. I, like many others, have lost a loved one and the holiday season is a hard to go through so i completely loved this play! The singing was amazing and the message was absolutely what I needed to get through yet another holiday season. This play spoke volumes when addressing God's plan for us and how to heal and move on when you think you've lost everything. I love all the plays i have seen by this talented playwright and I look forward to many more! My only request is to see more of the Character Gramps! He cracks me up DAGGUMIT!!",1323216000,3,644,4.16
4684464,1,B005FQ2HM8,I bought this play thinking it was going to be great. Well it wasn't. I got bored 2 minutes into this play. This play was supposed to be happy and joyous since it's about Christmas. It left me sad and mad that I bought it. Whatever you do PLEASE!!!! Don't waste your time buying this play. O! The songs in this play aren't any good either. The CD has only 2 songs on it. That CD was not even worth buying this play. I thought that since they had Ruben in the play they'd have lots of singing in it. NOT!! This was really a waste of my money. Buy it at your own risk. You won't be able to say I didn't warn you. Now I know why I haven't heard Ruben Studdard or Golden Brooks talking about this play when they do interviews. If I were them I wouldn't either.,1322697600,6,756,3.9802631578947367
