8499915,4,B006K1AMRO,"This is a good instructional DVD on how to play some metal (E-minor) shreds.

You will probably have to watch the videos several times.

I was not able to pick up the shreds and riffs as quickly as with other DVDs, and I think that comes from my beginner status.

This might be a better DVD for an intermediate level or expert guitarist.",1469923200,,337,4.317460317460317

8499917,5,B006K1AMRO,Keep your eye on the ball.  This is a great short cut in stead of trying to learn on your own. Practice these lics and it will drive you nuts but thats what it takes to be good.  Highly recommended,1461542400,,197,3.9
