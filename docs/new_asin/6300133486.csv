208649,3,6300133486,"This is one of those movies that you can't help but like. There is virtually no ""Terror"" to scare you ! The special effects, model work, sets/set decoration and costuming are laughably cheesy. The one note acting has to be deliberate, as some of these actors have considerable reputations. The comic relief characters,a Cockney commissary lady and a geeky/nerdy accountant, are particularly annoying. The colors are luridly too bright.
Rather better are the vivid score by British composer Elisabeth Lutyens and some well worked out sound effects which sometimes blend effectively with Lutyens' music.
One of those films that is likable for all of its faults.",1281571200,,659,5.226415094339623
208650,5,6300133486,"I'm a huge fan of British sci-fi and horror films and this film was almost a 'Holy Grail' for me.  I'd heard very little about the film, but being an Amicus production, I knew I had to see the film.  Finally, someone sent me the video and I settled in for the first initial viewing.  My rating of '5 Stars' isn't based upon the film being an award-winning film, but rather the fun I had in enjoying this film.  This film starts out on the serious side and perhaps that was the intention, but it doesn't take long for this film to fall out of the serious mode and into a fun experience.....at least for this viewer.  The characters are a nice mixture of seriousness and full-out fun.  Personally, Mr Yellowlees and Mrs Jones make the film for me.  The effects are very low-budget, the lone 'beastie' is very low budget, but has a Dr Who feel to it and the sets are very 60s in look, but that's what really sends this film over the top.  Pure cheese and 75 minutes or so of non-stop enjoyment.  I can say that repeated viewings of this film only solidify my love for it and here's hoping we'll eventually be graced with a proper DVD release!",1096070400,10,1139,4.285046728971962
208651,4,6300133486,"If you don't mind the super cheap effects in this one you ll
probably enjoy this movie that deals with people brought to
a type of space station with a dalek type robot and a very silly
looking monster. But shucks...after buying it i still
enjoyed it like the first time....keep yours eyes out for the
communication devices they wear on their head in the concluson.",1030492800,3,365,4.545454545454546

7802943,4,6300133486,This may be a low budget film but I've always liked it. I went so far as to buy a universal region VCR to play it.,1471824000,,114,3.423076923076923

7802945,5,6300133486,"This movie is based on one of my favorite books by Murray Leinster, ""The Wailing Asteroid,"" and I've always enjoyed watching this whenever it came on TV.  I wish this would get released in the US.  I do have a multi-region DVD player so I can enjoy this release, but when that finally decided to pack it in, I'll be left with an unwatchable disk.",1439769600,,346,4.3076923076923075
7802946,3,6300133486,"Dr. Joe Burke (Simon Oates) and his team are busy working on a project to discover intelligent, extraterrestrial life. They're up against a deadline, so they've got to show some results. One night, their instruments detect strange signals...  from spaaaace! They appear to be coming from an asteroid. So, the team sets out to make contact. Trouble ensues when the aliens respond by abducting the scientists, along w/ their entire building! Can Burke and his cohorts figure out what these beings want? THE TERRORNAUTS is a British science fiction film from 1967. While the sets and ""special"" effects are straight out of vintage DR. WHO, the story is fun, and the characters are likable. Plus, it features spear-throwing, green aliens in pink tunics! Recommended for fans of harmless, cheeezy sci-fi...",1431302400,2,800,5.153846153846154
7802947,5,6300133486,"I've been told I have eclectic taste in films and TV and when I proudly announce to anyone within ear-shot that I adore this film....I get some very odd looks.  I'll readily admit, this film will never win any awards, but why do we all watch films.....?  To be entertained and if you give this film a try, I guarantee you, you will be entertained!

Dr Joe Burke (Simon Oates), Ben Keller (Stanley Meadows) and their secretary, Sandy Lund (Zena Marshall) have spent years trying to prove that there is life out in the universe that is willing to communicate with them.  So far, no luck and the head of the telescope laboratory where they work has given them just three months to show some results or their funding will end.  Suddenly, they receive what they feel is communication from out in space and take the last of their funding to  make every effort to respond.

Enter Joshua Yellowlees (Charles Hawtrey) as the accountant sent by their funder to see why there has been such a large withdrawal from their funding.  The man is a hoot.  Then you have Mrs Jones (Patricia Hayes) as the cleaning woman/food/drink supplier.  She, too, is a hoot!

On the night the scientific trio are to make their effort to communicate, Mr Yellowlees and Mrs Jones are in their office and suddenly, the five of them are transported in their office to a satellite to endure some intelligence tests and see their reactions to certain circumstances.

This may all sound very serious to you, but trust me, this is pure fun....you have the groovy 60's look, a beastie that looks like it came straight from the early Dr Who series and bathing caps with electrodes attached.  Too fun!  You simply cannot go into this viewing with high expectations, but it truly isn't one of those films considered, 'so bad, it's good'.  The Terrornauts is fun, no two ways about it!

I'm so thrilled that this film has been released to DVD in the UK and I'm impatiently awaiting my copy to arrive!",1395792000,3,1957,4.596541786743516
7802948,4,6300133486,"For all of you who like this film please be advised that a new DVD release of it, made from original film elements, will be released in Britain on September 23rd this year.  It, of course, is a region 2 DVD, so will not play on US machines unless they are all region players.  The price is 8.41 British pounds, and is available for order from Amazon UK.",1375747200,,353,4.176470588235294
7802949,5,6300133486,"I have the VHS and now waiting on the DVD to be released , perhaps sometime before my demise( sarcasm , im from Jersey ). Its classic camp and listed in one movie dictionary ( Video Hound's Golden )as being ""juvenile and really dumb "" well I beg to differ ! . As a child my late father would take me to all the sci fi and horror flicks( one of those great memories of dad aside from playing music together) . My mum ,my sisters and I would watch Double Chiller broadcast from Phila ,Pa and I made the horror show night a tradition in my own home for my kids .We still have Sci Fi Saturday  night at my house and the old movies look better by the day when compared with some of the new.

The Terrornauts  remind me of the very first Doctor Who movie with Peter Cushing , yes the original movie version of the Doctor was played by Cushing ,who as we know went on to many things later in life .
Its typical good & bad  scientist and of course the ladies as the frail creatures we were, submissive and waiting on the gents to save the day .You may be surprised by what the ladies are capable of in this pre womens lib flick

 In this movie you will not find blood and guts , anyone being blasted apart and no soft core annotations what so ever.
The movie is cheezy but its not sleezy . If you are a collector like myself no doubt you have purchased this one . This is a rainy day movie ,curl up with a cuppa tea , hot cocco,  some pop corn and enjoy the show !

Its not an exact science , its the movies",1321401600,8,1499,3.956810631229236
7802950,2,6300133486,"This is ... a movie with a really good concept, a set of good English actors, and perhaps the worst special effects ever seen on film.  It was written by well-known science fiction author John Brunner.  I'd guess that they spent all their money on the decent cast and had almost nothing for the models, costumes and and actual filming.  I remember seeing this on TV as a very small child and being haunted by the story.  It definitely doesn't hold up to adult viewing, unless you like really awful films.  I personally had to have it for sentimental reasons.",1306627200,,558,4.54
