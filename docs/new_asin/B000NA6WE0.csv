8176202,4,B000NA6WE0,"Practical exercises which are easy to follow. Terry breaks down the stroke and develops drills that will (hopefully) enable almost everyone, young and old, to swim this seemingly difficult butterfly stroke.

Not as great as the Total Immersion for Freestyle though. But I still like this DVD as it appeals to everyone regardless of how advance the swimming skills are. Just wish they had more video demonstrations on actual swimming pools with lane/markers so we can see actual pace of this ""Better Fly"".",1357084800,,504,5.072289156626506
8176203,1,B000NA6WE0,"As someone who benefitted from his first Total Immersion video, I was extremely disappointed with this one. It should have been entitled ""Better Fly for Old Geezers"" as the guy can't even DO the butterfly with any kind of form due to his (admitted) inflexibility. I'm close to his age but still want to learn the real stroke. He has a younger,more limber swimmer in the video, but that guy has virtually no time on the screen. Save your money and look at the JimmyDShea videos on YouTube - he rocks!",1257292800,6,499,4.4945054945054945
8176204,5,B000NA6WE0,"Wow, I could have used this butterfly lesson years ago. I did butterfly as a kid swimmer - mostly, just gutting it out with youth and energy - but without any finesse. As an adult, that wasn't working for me. I've been doing the described drills after my workouts and have definitely seen a change in my stamina and strength. I highly recommend this dvd. Once again, however, I wish there would have been information about turns and pushoffs as that is something I'll need in Masters' competitions. Great verbal imagery to help you think about your body position and effort.",1223164800,4,574,4.693069306930693
8176205,5,B000NA6WE0,This is a great DVD that can help anyone master fly. I am a competitive swimmer and this DVD has help me tremendously. I went from not being able to  do fly to being able to compete in it.,1209945600,6,188,3.8205128205128207
8176206,1,B000NA6WE0,"40 years as a freestyle swimmer gives authority to teach, 40 minutes as a butterfly swimmer does not. Watching a middle aged man give tips standing waist deep in a pool is vaguely embarrassing and poor use of video. The two insights given ( pierce the water and move over your anchored hands ) are hardly worth the price of admission. The Go-Swim video with Misty Hyman is more structured, helpful and insightful for an improvement-minded swimmer",1208131200,12,446,4.805194805194805
8176207,5,B000NA6WE0,"I wish I can say thank you very much in person to Terry Laughlin and equipment that made possible this DVD, this style is very hard for me and I'm improving by watching all the lessons in this excellent material.",1203292800,3,212,4.325
