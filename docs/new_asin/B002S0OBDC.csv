3977983,5,B002S0OBDC,"Very funny at times and melancholy at others.  I had never heard of Anvil, and you don't need to know anything about them or care about metal at all to appreciate this excellent movie.  You can't help but root for these guys because they have been at it so hard for so long.  I found myself reflecting on the passage of time and the consequences of the choices we make in life after watching this.  It is a thought-provoking film, and I highly recommend it.",1415059200,,457,4.341176470588235

3977985,5,B002S0OBDC,"A surprisingly good documentary about an influential but little known band. Very human, funny, and at times very touching. You don't need to have a particular interest in either the band or the hard rock genre to enjoy this film. Extremely well done.",1409184000,,250,4.837209302325581
3977986,5,B002S0OBDC,"Utterly charming, delightfully funny, and humbling in the face of such simple dedication.  If you like any documentary, you'll love this one.",1401667200,,141,5.409090909090909
3977987,5,B002S0OBDC,"This was a great documentary!  The band the film is named after is perhaps one of the most influential heavy metal bands you have never heard, and it hails from the Great White North, Canada.  Anvil! is a hilarious, uplifting and a truly moving account of a band's struggle for the recognition I feel they so deserve.  You cheer these underdogs on watching them round the bases only to watch them get tagged out at home, over and over again.

You still rock Anvil!",1372118400,,464,4.488095238095238
3977988,5,B002S0OBDC,"This is one of the best band documentaries that I've ever seen. The beginning is a little slow, but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it.",1284249600,,148,3.966666666666667
3977989,4,B002S0OBDC,"I can respect the passion that Lips has for his music and like he said ""we all need that one thing in life that brings us happiness"" and Anvil is his but it never went anywhere and never will sadly",1449532800,,197,3.95
3977990,4,B002S0OBDC,"Very good music documentary! Even if you're not a fan of metal music, you will enjoy this film for the story and the way they tell it.",1448755200,,134,4.0

3977993,5,B002S0OBDC,"An awesome story in the ""Where Are They Now"" vein. The subject is heavy metal heroes, ""Anvil"". Their story is almost an anomaly. Here is a Canadian heavy metal band that has put out quality albums with maybe not the best production. They were, for a fleeting time in the early 80's part of the Headbanger's Club. There are many bands that continued onward with little to no respect of attention. The fact that Anvil is telling their story first, they will get some attention again...but how long? Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow (guitars, vocals) and Robb ""Robbo"" Reiner (no, not THAT Rob Reiner who gave us the Metal Mocumentary ""This Is Spinal Tap"" but it is sadly ironic) , have been the driving force behind Anvil with a passion second to none. I have been a fan since 1982 but lot touch because their albums weren't in the stores. Enter the computer age and Amazon and ""whammo""! There are the albums I've missed the last 20 years!

  It's a very touching documentary, even if you are not a fan. You can't help but feel for these guys. Unfortunately, they have the download people to contend with. This has become a hard game to play. Luckily, there are the die hard rock/metal fans like myself who are members of ""The Metal Pounders Union"". A Anvil fan club.  I wish the best for Anvil and can't help but pass the word about their great discography of albums. This movie re-heated my passion for the band along with many other musicians. Now I am waiting for the blu ray with all the bonus material. It would be great to have their videos along with the missing footage.",1434499200,,1563,4.512367491166078

3977995,5,B002S0OBDC,"An amazing look at an extremely influential band in the metal world yet was overlooked for far too long. It's funny, it's heartbreaking, and the story of Anvil should be shared and praised.",1426291200,,189,4.757575757575758

8378994,5,B002S0OBDC,"I LOVED this documentary. ""Lips"" is so positive and has great energy, and Robb Reiner is an incredible drummer. It's infectious and inspiring. Sacha Gervasi nailed this one. I really hope their dreams finally come true. You just can't make this stuff up.",1483401600,,254,4.930232558139535
8378995,5,B002S0OBDC,"Come on, who has seen this and doesn't like it?  It's not just a story about a pair of friends chasing the dream of rock n roll stardom, it's that story but with guys in their 50s whom never gave up on their dream.  I really like seeing and hearing about stories like this that don't completely revolve around kids trying to make it in the music business - it's great to see older bands doing it too.",1474761600,,400,4.115384615384615
