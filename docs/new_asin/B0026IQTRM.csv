8352774,5,B0026IQTRM,If you teach any investigative course this would be an ideal video to show in class or to help you plan out mock investigations for your students. This program takes you through investigations by students at Penn State and you'll be able to see group dynamics of investigating crime scenes. It shows how teamwork can help solve a crime or can cause a disaster if there is clashing.,1443139200,,381,4.617647058823529
8352775,3,B0026IQTRM,"I had high hopes for this, but was somewhat disappointed.  I purchased this for use in my forensic science class (high school level).  My students were not as engaged as I thought they would be in video.  It is refreshing to see that crime scene investigations don't always go perfectly in real environments and there are obstacles.",1421366400,,332,4.7894736842105265
8352776,5,B0026IQTRM,"If you like forensics you should watch this DVD. They set almost real environments  for the students, so the students are able to practice what they learned. Amazing.",1409702400,,166,4.928571428571429
8352777,5,B0026IQTRM,"As a high school teacher in Crime Scene Investigations and Forensics, I found this dvd to be an excellent addition to my video catalog! This dvd follows two different teams as they process crime scenes and try to determine how the crime was committed as well as who committed the crime. Kept the class totally engaged. Excellent training tool!",1396915200,,343,4.830508474576271
8352778,4,B0026IQTRM,"I am always very interested in the ""what, how, and when"" and this DVD on examination of (mock) crime scene investigation is thorough and mind-provoking.  If you are interested in gong into this field or if you are just interested in what it's all about, give this DVD a chance.  I was glad I bought it.",1359244800,2,302,4.375
8352779,4,B0026IQTRM,"I bought this out of curiosity and am not disappointed.
Its about investigating a crime scene where the students are given the task to do a forensic fact finding. As a viewer, you'll be drawn into making your own investigation & comparing your result against theirs.
Its like reading a detective novel & trying to figure out who did it. Along the way , I learnt quite a bit about forensic science which may come in handy( God forbid)should I decide to engage in a brutal assult on my enemy Example: wash all weapons with bleach & the forensic scientist will not be able to find trace of blood.

I would have given a 5 star if only this DVD contains more episodes.",1347753600,4,663,4.390243902439025
8352780,5,B0026IQTRM,"I bought Crime Scene University to shop to my Forensics students.  It's great! They show how 2 teams of students work to solve crimes using information they just learned plus you get to see the interpersonal dynamics between the group members (I love this because kids can see what good leadership and poor leadership results in).

I just wish they would come out with a second DVD set.  I would totally buy this again!",1329350400,2,419,4.635135135135135
8352781,5,B0026IQTRM,"I purchased this DVD to use in my Forensic Science classroom.  I found the DVD to be very informative and educational,along with being fun to watch.  The scenes are not gruelsome or vulgar.  It's very interesting to watch the teams as they try to solve the six crimes and how their mistakes play into their final outcome.  I would highly recommend this as an addition to any Forensic classroom.",1313798400,8,394,4.666666666666667
