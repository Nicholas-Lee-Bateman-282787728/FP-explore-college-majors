8451248,5,B0050I978S,"Clear image and graphics. At first I thought that it didn't have any subtitles, but you need to wait till it officially starts the episode it comes on automatically or just press subtitles on your remote (there is no language option except clean title opening in the extras). The case is thicker than the average dvd case, (about the size of two) with the dvd's stacked on top of each other rather than in several layers of dvds in an individual place.",1480291200,,452,4.524390243902439

However, there are only a few of them and the Thanatos are multiplying and becoming even more troublesome. The Purifiers must work together with their allies and find a way to stop the Thanatos.

This is such a good show. The characters and story line are interesting. Everything in the anime is so colorful. The artwork is beautiful. Although after a few episodes I could guess the ending, knowing the title and all. Although, I already guessed how it would end, I was still disappointed that I was right with the ending. I wished it ended differently, which is why I gave it 4 stars.",1384560000,,717,4.645669291338582
