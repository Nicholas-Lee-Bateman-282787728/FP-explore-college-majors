8539045,5,B009B0L4O6,Super fun and interesting documentary about the Moai of Easter Island focusing on how they were moved and put in place.  Watched it with my high school age daughter and she loved it too.,1483574400,,186,4.470588235294118
8539046,2,B009B0L4O6,"I love Nova, and normally they have great shows, so I was expecting to see well-researched show using scientific and archeological evidence, demonstrating a real plausible explanation that I would believe on ""Easter Island mysteries."" The show starts out on how they have scientific evidence that could upset all the prior theories on how Maoi statues were moved, as though this show uncovered a better explanation, they were moved in a way not previously known before. This peaked my curiosity, as I figured they must have uncovered new archeological evidence, but ultimately I would learn that they did not. This Nova episode solely focused on these one scientists who just wanted to prove their thoery of how they thought the Moai could have been moved over land while in an upright position, but they ignore other known evidence that would disprove it. It was almost all just about testing the scientists building a replica to test their engineering hypotheses, of ""if it could mechanically work."" I kept watching because I thought since Nova always has well-researched shows, they may have discovered something new still, to take this hypothesis further, but then the scientists claimed their theory was based entirely on the premise, that the method of travel for moving the statues, was by using ""ancient roads."" They then show these scientists surveying the island and so basically infer they are the first to do that, and so discovered the ""ancient roads,"" but not only were they not the first to survey the island, it has already been clearly established that the ""roads"" they think they found, are irrigation canals, so would have been filled with water. I couldn't get past that, because I was wondering why Nova would air a show, with scientists who would not already know this? And even worse, act like they discovered something new, which is not new, but then say it was something else. And if the scientists did know this, why didn't they provide a theory about how prior research would be wrong? At least if they addressed it, I would have felt the show was more informational, and less a waste of my time, since I thought if their whole theory of moving them on land, was because they used these ancient roads, that were actually filled with water, then they couldn't have been moved the way they were trying to prove they were moved. So although Nova shows are normally great, and well-researched, this was not one of them, and I did not like it how these scientists were basically providing misinformation to the public. I felt like the only thing I learned, was that you could hypothetically move a large stone object while upright, although not very plausible for how these Maoi were moved, knowing what scientists already know about the island.",1459641600,2,2767,4.876857749469214
8539047,4,B009B0L4O6,"Nice footage, informative. I did not expect so much of the video to about how they re-created moving the statues, but still it was informative.",1441152000,,143,4.76
8539048,5,B009B0L4O6,Wonderful addition to mine & anyone's collection on these interesting statues on an island by themselves!,1405814400,,105,5.625
8539049,5,B009B0L4O6,"This NOVA episode is about the moai (""giant head"" statues) of Rapa Nui. The documentary examines who created the statues, and how they were made, but focuses more on how the huge monuments were transported from where they were carved to where they stand today. Previous hypotheses involved dragging them on sleds or rolling them on logs, but some contemporary archaeologists give credence to oral traditions, which say the moai ""walked"" to their destinations. The film crew follows a team of scientists as they create a realistic replica of a typical moai, and attempt to use ropes and muscle to ""walk"" it down a primitive road.

This episode also explores the mystery of what happened to the original inhabitants of Rapa Nui. Archaeologists discuss the evidence of severe environmental degradation and ensuing hostilities, but they discredit the overly-simplistic myth of self-destruction through ""ecocide."" The commonly-held notion that cutting down all the trees ruined the island--and led the people of Rapa Nui to destroy themselves through cannibalism and civil war--ignores the true complexity of the island's history.

I recommend ""Mystery of Easter Island"" for anyone with an interest in archaeology, history, or ecology. It is, once again, another excellent documentary from PBS.",1377648000,2,1289,5.407960199004975
8539050,5,B009B0L4O6,This represents a good overview of what happened on Easter Island.  It also illustrates good archaeology and how method of the field can be used to gain insights.,1368403200,,162,4.785714285714286
8539051,3,B009B0L4O6,"This is a short doco filmed in Hawaii about how the Easter Island Moais might have been moved. Having visited Easter Island several times I was very interested in the subject matter and was glad to see this disc. It is however very short, and has almost no Easter Island content at all. An excellent rent but overpriced and the Hawaiian experiment made the title a little misleading.",1365465600,6,383,4.647058823529412
8539052,5,B009B0L4O6,I ordered it because I like the movie. The movie was exactly what I wanted and it came quickly. Very happy with the product.,1363651200,,124,4.208333333333333
8539053,5,B009B0L4O6,"My son Nathan loves his Easter Island head DVD! He loves statues, and loves the movie the 'Night at the Museum""; which has the talking Easter Island Head statue. So this was a big hit, and he watches frequently. Thank you!",1359072000,,222,4.439024390243903
