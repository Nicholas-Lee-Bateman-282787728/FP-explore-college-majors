She is thw woman who made soft core films in the 90's aimed squarely at the ladies in the audience. In other words, if I guy was in need of titillation and wanted to watch a soft core flick with his wife, he would take home a Shames' film and know he wouldn't be embarrassed watching it front of the woman he respects. There are the naked ladies, of course, and plenty of simulated sex, but the emphasis is on romance. In this one an unappreciated wife (Kim Dawson) wants to rekindle the fire she once had with her husband (Al Sapienza) who is lately totally preoccupied with business matters. Most flicks of this type have one of the partners philandering in no time. In this one though, the husband and wife remain in love and desire each other. It's just the communication between them that has gone awry. Kim fixes things by proposing she make love with a total stranger in their hotel room with husband witnessing the whole thing (after he confesses he had a fantasy in which his wife had wanton sex with one of her coworkers). In typical Shames fashion, the plan evolves into an extended tease and when hubby cannot bear the thought of seeing his wife with another man, Kim's plan is interrupted and her husband fills in admirably. It's all harmless fun and tastefully done. It's a true couples' film. While you are at it, check out the even better companion piece by the same director. ""The Hottest Bid"" is a bit hotter, in fact, and it too has the Shames regular Gwen Somers in the cast. She is in both movies and she ignites the screen in all of her sex scenes.",1390694400,,1655,4.465346534653466
