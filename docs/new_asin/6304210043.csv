7866239,4,6304210043,"Episode 6 of 'The West' (why are only two of this eight-part series available?) begins with one of the most famous episodes in the Western history, the defeat of the Seventh Cavalry by the Lakota Indians at Little Big Horn, Custer's Last Stand; but, as one contributor argues, this victory was a Pyrrhic one, followed by defeat after treacherous defeat - the episode could have been called 'The Indians' Last Stand'.
This series devoted to telling the truth about an American history distorted and over-mythologised by Hollywood, finally comes to the period most familiar and contentious in the film Western - the Indian wars, the final move by expansionist white Americans to remove natives from the land.  The central, vexed questions are - who owns, or has rights to the land?  Who, or who decides who, are civilised or primitive?
It is a depressing tale of broken treaties, diplomatic bad faith, clumsy military strategies and, in some cases, attempted genocide.  Importantly, the programme shows how the federal government's quashing independence or alternative communities wasn't restricted to the ethnic Other, with the isolationist Mormons in Utah also punished.
As throughout the series, this episode attempts to be rigorously fair to the Indian sensibility, and the narrative, packed with fatalistic quotes by disillusioned warriors, vivid tapestries and ancient chants, moves towards a climax that emphasises the Indians' defeat, not the dubious American victory.  However, as again throughout the series, the film-makers are faced with a fundamental problem - the absence in an oral culture of written (either official documents and reports, newspaper articles; or private diaries and letters) or photographic evidence.  The self-historicising Americans are, of course, archive-rich, and the neccessary reliance on these resources cannot avoid creating a white-centred viewpoint.
these exciting, dramatic, shameful, brutal stories survive the revisionist tendencies thanks to the brilliant story-telling, from scriptwriters, director, music supervisor, editor and interviewees alike, although the simple-minded opposition between the oh-so-spiritual Indians and the murderously soulless Americans actually debases the former, denying them their complex humanity.",1002585600,,2274,5.776119402985074
