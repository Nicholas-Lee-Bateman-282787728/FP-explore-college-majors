8241565,1,B0011FDV2C,"A few of my buddies watched this tape and laughed.  We laughed not because it was funny, but because we couldn't believe how bad it was.  I love stand-up comedy and I've been to The Ice House where this performance was taped. The walls of The Ice House are filled with pictures of comedians from greats to near greats to working comedians who have performed there.  I have never seen one picture of Bruce Baum on the walls there. Yet, I've seen him  advertised as a comedy legend. The act is all filth without the funny. Baum breaks into flop sweat as several jokes get loud moans.",1236902400,,581,4.401869158878505
