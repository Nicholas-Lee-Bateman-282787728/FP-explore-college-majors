8661181,5,B00KSLLCWQ,"Another good one from Japan. This has all your twist and turns, and then when you think you got it, the last twist proves you wrong. Lately Japan has been a little slow putting out good horror flicks, so I'm always happy to say this is a good one. I love the story and everything else that goes with it, especially the 2 hot female leads. Throughout the movie here I am thinking ""ok, it's another one of them psycho roommates"". And of course, I was totally wrong, I loved it...that's how I know the movie is good when it gets me like that. So get your roomies and watch roommate!",1426550400,,579,4.225225225225225
8661182,3,B00KSLLCWQ,"""Roommate"" isn't a supernatural thriller like most of the other horror movies coming out of Japan. The movie deals with one woman's multiple personalities. ""Roommate"" is okay for a Japanese thriller, it has some interesting twists and turns. And the two lead actresses are very pretty too.",1417392000,,289,5.170212765957447
