8729406,5,B0142WHPF4,Very cool case ART ! It's the same transfer as earlier Blu's but you get a new Ultraviolet DL too. I usually don't double dip in that I already had the same blu ray disc from an earlier release but I thought the steelbook art was very cool ! I didn't buy from Amazon though in this case. Of course The movie is great too !,1453766400,,322,3.893939393939394
