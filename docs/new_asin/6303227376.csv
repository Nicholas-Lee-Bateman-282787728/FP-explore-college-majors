Okay, so basically what we have here is a guy (Roberto Guinar, whose part is actually fairly inconsequential, despite top billing) whose mother (I think? sorry, but my Spanish isn't so good, and the video is not available with subtitles) dies, leaving him this huge house and surrounding estate...as well as a long-forgotten childhood toy in the form of a half-human-sized Satanically-possessed clown doll. (EEEeeek! Scawy clowns!)

This guy's wife, after they move in and clean the place up, she finds the clown-doll in an old trunk, and they make a place for it in their lives, treat it well, etc. - that is, until she gets pregnant. The possessed clown-doll then gets tossed into a closet by the wife and forgotten. I'll give you one guess as to how well the doll takes this treatment and what he does to the wife.

The guy, now a widow and father to a mother-less child (who grows up fast, Skeezix-style, to 5 or 6 years of age), becomes involved with his secretary (?), second-billed Lorena Herrera (the so-called Pamela Anderson of Mexico - one difference: Ms. Herrera appears to be 100% organic, if you get my meaning). Pretty soon she's the stepmother to the little boy (El Nino Alan Fernando), and she initially takes well enough to his creepy clown doll. That is until...

I'll leave the rest to your imagination or to your own viewing of the film, but suffice it to say that despite a somewhat slow start and occasionally draggy pacing (the director apparently mistaking this for 'atmosphere'), there are some pretty decent gore/violence scenes (man stabbed in head with knife, then smashed in face with bottle; woman strangled by telekinetically-animated rope, then plunging from a height to her death), as well as the highlight scene (for me, anyway) when Ms. Herrera has a nightmare in which she is felt up and dry-humped by the possessed clown doll.

And the ending sets it up for a sequel (which was never made, as far as I know - why the heck not?).",1308700800,,2029,4.720338983050848
