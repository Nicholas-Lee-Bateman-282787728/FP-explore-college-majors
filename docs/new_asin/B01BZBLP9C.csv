7671163,1,B01BZBLP9C,"first season is good but the second is meh, just a bunch of boring cliche drama, especially from Kim Wexler, I wish Jimmy would stay poor and have to do criminal funny job to survive, don't buy season 2 if you already watched season 1, sounds like the producer ran out of idea, and made Jimmy a rich lawyer ruined everything. Also Kim is boring, bring more Jimmy and less Kim please.",1474848000,2,383,4.333333333333333
7671164,5,B01BZBLP9C,"I have to admit I wasn't a big fan of the first season and wasn't really going to rush to check out the second season, but when I saw the second season on DVD, I thought well I'm going to end up watching it one day anyway so why not now?  The second season is brilliant.  The first season was very slow at most times, sometimes entire episodes with only a couple of big moments throughout the entire season.  However with this second season, there's something going on all the time, whether it's tension, trying to avoid being caught doing something a character is not supposed to and other things.  Some episodes it's Mike's character bringing this fast pace while the in between slow stuff happens in Jimmy's life or it's the other way round.  There's a few occasions where the two's story lines cross paths but for most episodes they're operating independently.  Also it emulates one of the aspects that made Breaking Bad the success it was in the way that show had Walter White using his intelligence to outwit, out manoeuvre and even survive against thugs, killers and rivals. In this season we're seeing both Mike and Jimmy starting do that themselves a lot more.

With this season Both Mike and Jimmy are being transformed by events around them into the characters we know in Breaking Bad.  Neither is quite there yet.  Like all prequel series, Better Call Saul is obviously hindered by the fact we know which characters are still around in Breaking Bad years in the future, but most characters aren't in both shows, so we know something will happen that they are not in this world anymore, whether they move away, are killed, jailed or whatever, we the viewer don't know and that's part of the fun.

I made the comment with the first season that Better Call Saul better get better, well it did! In a big way! It's a top notch show now and I can't wait for the third season!  There's no info at the time of this review what the American version comes with but the region 4 DVD version comes with the ten episodes spread over three dics.  All episodes also have options to play commentaries on them.  There's a switch table read, and also a gag reel (where Jimmy catches a glimpse of a show he thinks is stupid on TV about a certain chemistry teacher.  There's also a feature called Setting the Score where after a brief intro by composer for the series Dave Porter you can watch a scene from the final episode with a score her created which wasn't used in the episode when they decided it would be better to have no background score in the scene at all.",1473638400,4,2560,4.489224137931035

7671166,1,B01BZBLP9C,"I must be the only one who hates this series, because everyone is giving it glowing reviews.  First, let me say that breaking bad is one of my all-time favorites.  I watched every episode on television, purchased the blu rays, and thoroughly enjoyed watching every episode again.  Better Call Saul is terrible -- the worst writing I can imagine, the dumbest storylines, and the greatest waste of acting talent I can think of.  It makes me think they have to be doing it on purpose.  Yes, I have seen all 20 episodes.  Every time I see Michael McKean come on screen, I want to puke.  He was better as Lenny, and probably should have stopped there.  I would have watched any spin-off of breaking bad.  How can you ruin a character as awesome as Mike Ehrmantraut?  Sorry if this offended anyone, but I had to say it.",1470787200,6,813,4.469387755102041

7671168,5,B01BZBLP9C,"""Don't"" - ???

The whole series is about Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman....or more accurately his dignified honest Jimmy self being unable to suppress his true nature of Saul.

I love how Bob Odenkirk plays this role. He does such a great job, along with the writers, of making his character look bored and miserable when he's doing things that lead him down a respectable and financially prosperous path. But when he does sleazy less profitable 'Saul Goodman' type work that he did in Breaking Bad, he just looks happier. (Not a spoiler. That transformation from Jimmy McGill to Saul Goodman is what this whole series is about.)

Just like Season 1 did, Season 2 opens with a flash forward to events that take place after the entire Breaking Bad story with Jimmy/Saul being generally miserable that he walked away from his life in New Mexico. Nothing else in this series absolutely requires you to know anything about the events of Breaking Bad, though it would help to have seen BB first.

Bob Odenkirk takes a character that was written as comic relief in a very dark drama (Breaking Bad) and makes the character the dramatic center of an entire series, and he does it while staying totally true to the creation of the Saul Goodman character he made famous in Breaking Bad. That's not easy to do.

The entire cast is fantastic. Rhea Seahorn is Jimmy's love interest and she nails her part as a career minded lawyer who has a personal life with Jimmy despite her best judgement. And Ed Begley Jr joined the cast this year for a brief run.

The production crew and writers put all kinds of VERY subtle references into the show. And just like Breaking Bad, colors are everything. The color of absolutely everything in the show is very purposely thought out. Different colors mean different things. It's a lot of fun to watch the show on that level.

Now I just can't wait to see who left the note.",1461196800,9,1907,4.640949554896142
7671169,5,B01BZBLP9C,"Comparisons with the titanic Breaking Bad: are inevitable, since this show shares not only creator Vince Gilligan but is a spin off of some key characters  here in an origin story taking place before Breaking Bad. But this new show  great in its own way  really is quite a different animal. Breaking Bad felt big, powerful, operatic. A Beethoven symphony of a show. While it had humor, the blasts of dark drama and tension dominated. Better Call Saul feels like more of a chamber piece, a string quartet, or a great jazz trio. Quieter, more intimate, leaning more towards the comic, its themes about America and success are mostly fed with a wink, and not a punch to the stomach. The pace is slower too. This is a character study, and its content to allow us to just watch some very interesting people working through their strange funny/sad lives without pushing the plot along all that much. Its an outstanding show, but on its own terms, in its own way.

The acting is terrific. Bob Odenkirk creates a truly likable semi-sad sack with truly questionable morals and decision making ability, but a big heart. Jonathan Banks continues as one of the best television characters ever, his aging ex-cop a brilliant, cold, coiled snake, who always lets out just enough humanity to know that while this guy could kill you in a heartbeat if he had to, deep down hes a good guy, a loving grandfather, a moral man. Michael McKean does a great job as Odenkirks deeply disturbed brother. He will always be a smarter, better lawyer than Jimmy, he will always hold a grudge, and he is Odenkirks exact opposite. The guy who  on paper  we should feel bad for, but who is just icy and venal enough to keep us at an intrigued distance. If the character has a weak spot its that he can get a bit repetitive, but thats more a function of how the man is limited by his paranoid psychosis, not a limitation of acting or writing.

As with Breaking Bad the writing is specific, idiosyncratic, full of terrific dialogue that sounds naturalistic, but has just the right touch of poetry blended in. And as with its predecessor, the direction and cinematography is always at a high level, very cinematic, unafraid of staying in wide shots, or playing scenes in long takes instead of the rapid cutting that still dominates most TV  even very good TV. There are occasional lapses  I saw the twist ending of season 2 coming a mile off. But  if not as driven and instantly unforgettable as its parent show - this is intelligent, subtle and special television, not quite like anything else before or since.

(To those worried about the pre-release price per some other reviews - fear not.  It will go down.  It always does.  Just the way Amazon always does it).",1461110400,66,2729,4.6115702479338845
7671170,5,B01BZBLP9C,"Really hard to come up with two better characters than Mike and Jimmy (Saul). One must hope that Kim Wexler is not destroyed by Jimmy's flawed but noble approach to legal problem solving. Their backstory to Breaking Bad is absolutely riveting, and the acting is top of the class. I still think the season should be longer (obviously). Can anyone else imagine Jimmy as Perry Mason, and Mike as Paul Drake, with Kim as Della Street?
  I think Vince should give that combination a shot (just my thinking, though). This is one of the best series ever .... tanx, sammy",1460937600,3,563,4.62

7671194,5,B01BZBLP9C,"Bought this series on a whim after indulging in the ""Breaking Bad"" series. Seeing season one for 8$ I gave it a go. James McGill (Saul) is quite the interesting character. Breaking Bad never showed him in much depth other than a charismatic, smooth talker with a reputation of toting sophisticated drug dealers through legal loop-holes.
Better Call Saul shows McGill at his roots before the arrival of his character in breaking bad.
McGill is a small time lawyer with a passion for the job but just can't catch a break. He meets Mike (Breaking Bad) and his future of aiding illegal activity slowly begins.
McGill is just a character you want to root for, hard-working, caring, charismatic and utterly hilarious in such a passive nature.
This show is a treat to watch, give it a chance an you will indeed be hooked. First season is a slow take-off but after the first disc things start getting quite interesting.

7671206,5,B01BZBLP9C,"Enjoyed this immensely. Now I'm not sure if it's because I watched ""Breaking Bad"" and know where the characters are all headed but I'd be curious to read a review of someone who watches this series first to its whatever season conclusion...and then watches ""Breaking Bad.""

Anyway, I actually find ""Better Call Saul"" far more enjoyable because I like literally all the characters even the bad ones. In ""Breaking Bad"" I just never could get into Walt's family as a part of the storyline. Here I can. I think Michael McKean is playing the insanely insane brother to Jimmy/Saul at an off-the-charts level. Which goes to show TV series producers--cast more comedic actors in dramatic roles.

The DVD is worth getting as the extras are fun. Commentary tracks, if you want them, are on there for every episode with a rotating cast of actors and crew. On Disc 1 you get to see and hear a table read of one episode which for us non-in-the-industry types was very intriguing to see how that process works. On Disc 2 is a gag reel. And on Disc 3 is a way cool inside-the-scene look at the Touch Of Evilesque opening shot to Episode 8 as well as seeing another scene and how it was musically scored prior to that score being dropped totally out of the final cut.

Basically, Vince Gilligan not only deliver great TV but knows how to package great DVDs for the fans of said great TV series.",1504224000,,1378,4.526104417670683

7671220,5,B01BZBLP9C,"The second season of Better Call Saul continues to engross the viewer with deep and complex characters. The story of Slippin' Jimmy and Co. is a roller coaster ride balancing good and bad, right and wrong, black and white and all those wonderful shades in between. The show moves at a very deliberate pace, slower perhaps, but never for the sake of drawing out a poorly conceived story.

I think the show would play better if they had added a few episodes per season. !0 episodes was a fine starting point for the first season, but with the show's slower pace I think a few more episodes would have helped to move each story arc a little further per season. This is one show that plays much better when binge watching, it's much more satisfying watching multiple episodes at one time.

The price point is pretty steep and while I love this show I have waited until the price dropped to $19.99 for the first season and $25 for the second season. The Blu Ray sets are first rate with lots of commentaries and interesting extras. The commentaries are good, but they do tend to ramble and repeats things a lot. Most of the time we hear things like ""oh he was nice to work with"" or They were great people for letting us use their home"" etc. Not exactly what one looks for in a commentary.

Overall this is a great release and if you can get it for a good price, it's well worth picking up to watch the entire season in one to two sittings.",1497657600,,1434,4.343283582089552

7671231,5,B01BZBLP9C,"The slow burn of Better Call Saul is not for everyone, however, the brilliant acting and writing of Breaking Bad still carries over with the creative team to this new series and makes this one of strongest character pieces I've seen in ages. Bob Odenkirk and Jonathan Banks continue to shine with career best work as Jimmy McGill (the future Saul Goodman) and Mike Ehrmantraut. Picking up with the sudden about face Jimmy makes in the first season's finale (to commit to the easy path he'd tried to forsake by going straight), Jimmy struggles with his inner demons this season as he first tries to join the lucrative new law firm Kim Wexler set him up with and then later with starting his own firm. Meanwhile, Mike continues his descent into a world of crime in order to provide for his daughter in law and granddaughter before running afoul of Tuco Salmanca during his dealings with Tuco's more level headed business partner Nacho.

To be sure, Better Call Saul does not have the action packed world of drug dealing that was the hallmark of the later seasons of Breaking Bad. However, I never wanted this series to attempt to mimic that formula. Instead, Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould once again create a fabulous deconstruction of a character. As with any prequel, at the end of the day we know what awaits our characters. Mike will fall in with Gustavo Fring and become the latter's go-to fixer. Jimmy will forsake his former friends and life completely and become the completely corrupt Saul Goodman. However, the tragedy and the joy of watching this show is seeing how those falls occur. The beauty of this show is that you want Jimmy to overcome his own criminal nature and stay on the path of the angels with great supporting characters like Kim. However, we know that that isn't how things work out and whether you blame Jimmy's inner ""slipperiness"" when it comes to dealing with rules and authority or the negative impact of characters like the brilliant Michael McKean as Jimmy's domineering brother Chuck it all leads to Saul.

With amazing acting, strong writing, and brilliant direction Better Call Saul remains one of the best dramas currently on television. Can't wait to catch up on season three with the return introduction of a major player in both the lives of Mike and Jimmy:  Giancarlo Esposito's ruthless Gustavo Fring.",1495065600,,2343,4.794554455445544

If you did, you will enjoy the Easter eggs and seeing characters from that series. I am a little disappointed in this DVD set, however. It includes all episodes, but it seems put together quickly without much thought. The episode names and descriptions are written on the liner and difficult to read through the molded plastic holding the DVD. In fact, you'll have to pop the 3rd DVD out to see them. It also doesn't list which DVD the extras are on. You'll just have to find them.

7671244,4,B01BZBLP9C,"I found season one hard to like and slow, slow ,slow. It took me 18 months to come back for more and I am glad I did, Season twos sparkles with more interesting characters, more intriguing situations, and more plot twists, although the big one at the end of season two was so so predictable I was so disappointed. Oh they aren't really going to do that are they? Yes they are. There is no question this is a poor cousin of ""Breaking Bad"", yet it does possess the style and ironic passion we have come to expect from Vince Gilligan and his writers. So, as we go into season three, lets jack up the pace and the stories a bit. It's time for Giancarlo Esposito to arrive, time for it to get closer to the beginnings of ""Breaking Bad"", there is only so much juice you can get out of the brothers relationship and the willing girlfriend being played by Saul, sorry , still Jimmy. Time for Saul to be born. You see, I know a lot of people who are hoping it will eventually go up to ""Breaking Bad"" and then by pass those years and pick up the story permanently post BB (not the one scene per season as we got this year) and let us see what the future is for this character with whom we have invested so much and what an excellent time to then bring back Aaron Paul and open Saul's story out into 2018 and beyond .....please, please do it Vince, otherwise the show will fizzle and die in the next year or so.

There are a few scenes in season 2 which seem like ""deleted"" scenes that purveyors of DVD movies sometimes feel compelled to include with their product; perhaps a s a boobie prize; example: Kim and Jimmy putting the scam on a not so bad guy in a bar (the second one of these). These scenes, and there aren't many, seem like filler, stalling for time to bring on the episode's ending.

If you put aside the idea that a prequel--to Breaking Bad--is ""old news"", the series is a lot of fun, striking an elusive mix of comedy and drama that I haven't seen any other production match, As usual, the Jonathan Banks scenes are alotta fun.",1484092800,,684,4.428571428571429

Whether or not you're a fan of Breaking Bad (and lets face it, you likely are), this show will entertain with the balance of drama, violence, action, and character-driven development of some Breaking Bad characters and some new ones sprinkled in that are just as compelling and interesting.

Better Call Saul season 2 continues Jimmy McGil's journey to slimy attorney Saul Goodman, and introduces more iconic Breaking Bad story elements along with some twists and turns that fans will enjoy.  Likewise, the show has a style and elements different from the proceeding series to make this unique and stand on its own two legs.  Great writing, directing and editing here.

Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), a struggling Albuquerque lawyer, sinks further toward being the shyster and conman Saul Goodman that he was on the parent show.  This DVD set contains all ten episodes of Season Two that originally aired on AMC from February to April in 2016.

This season, Jimmy's loose ethics, ends-justifies-the-means ethos, and failure to obey legitimate authority in a workplace lead him, predictably, to go rogue, and the series employs amusing symbolic devices to show how he cannot conform when professionalism requires him to do so.  A contrast is drawn between the weak character he shows when he finally gets a chance to reap the rewards of his hard work and succeed as a lawyer and the character his love interest Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) shows at her own law firm when she is treated with excessive harshness.

Jimmy's ethical lapses hurt both Kim and his lawyer brother Chuck (Michael McKean), effects that Jimmy is unable to foresee when committing his malign machinations.  Season Two explores more of the backstory of Jimmy's relationship with Chuck, as the seeds of Saul Goodman were present in Jimmy by the time he was 13, with devastating effects on his family.

The story of Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), Jimmy's future ""Breaking Bad"" associate, also unfolds throughout the season.  ""Better Call Saul"" producers Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould succeed in creating fascinating charactersthere are three or four characters on the show so complex and compelling that other worthy spinoff series could be created around them.  The writing in the show is brilliant, the cinematography and camera angles are again peerless, and, as always, the scenery of the New Mexico desert is arresting.  ""Better Call Saul"" has justly won and been nominated for numerous awards, and its fans are eagerly anticipating its third season.",1483660800,5,2273,5.902439024390244

7671290,4,B01BZBLP9C,"(4 and 1/2 stars)  I offer myself as proof that one can enjoy this series without ever having watched a single episode of ""Breaking Bad.""  I will admit to having been a little lost in Season One, but re-watching episodes with the DVD commentaries cleared up any confusion.

Having my bearings going in this time around, I thus found Season Two more enjoyable from start to finish.  Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) provides a thoroughly involving psychological character study (his moral ambiguity makes him seem all the more human), thanks of course to the excellent teleplays, direction and Odenkirk's total mastery of the role.  Rhea Seehorn, as Kim Wexler, has a fine season, matching her charismatic co-star step for step.  Michael McKean, as Jimmy's older brother Chuck - the righteous legal genius and prestigious firm partner with an odd affliction - is particularly outstanding in the later episodes; and Ed Begley, Jr. makes a solid impression as the head of the legal firm who took a huge gamble by hiring Jimmy.

Jonathan Banks, as world-weary ex-cop, bodyguard and unflinching trouble fixer Mike Ehrmantraut, thoroughly inhabits his role as well, providing the perpetually present potential for sudden violence through his thorny contact with local drug gang members.  The problem is that it's a rather static, idealized character; and scenes with him and  his widowed daughter-in-law and young granddaughter nearly grind the episodes to a halt as heartstrings are repeatedly tugged in a similar way each time.

I realize it's necessary to take the series where it wants to go, but the cutting back and forth between essentially two very different shows within the same one feels somewhat discordant to me; albeit not nearly enough to detract from my overall enjoyment of this very well-produced series.

I will remain on board for Season Three, as this is one of the better [no pun intended] shows on TV.

[Comment on a DVD extra: the 40-minute table read of an episode is impressive - particularly in the level of preparation and professionalism by Odenkirk and Seehorn - but it's nothing I would ever want to watch again.]",1481587200,,2133,5.028409090909091

7671299,4,B01BZBLP9C,"This second season seemed to contain less humor and the pace has slowed down, though it's still a good show. The writers also missed an opportunity for a very funny gag.

For reasons too complex to explain here, Jimmy must produce a strange sex fetish videotape featuring his client in order to clear the client of police suspicion in another, more serious crime. At a slightly later date, Jimmy gets a job with a prestigious law firm and produces a videotape to air as a TV commercial - pitching the law firm to the elderly.
Now imagine he has all this film work on his computer and makes some mistakes in the editing process. Imagine the TV station airs the law firm commercial with scenes of a grown man in a diaper sitting in pies and crying like a baby. Imagine that the elderly public loves the commercial.

7671300,5,B01BZBLP9C,"Better Call Saul: Season Two continues the backstory of Saul Goodman, aka Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), the sleazy lawyer first introduced in Breaking Bad. Each episode adds more information to illustrate how Jimmy evolved from ambulance chaser to a lawyer for unsavory clients. The attraction of Jimmy McGill is that he is a sympathetic scoundrel. We root for him, despite his challenged ethical compass. By the time he meets mild-mannered chemistry teacher Walter White, he is already a lost cause.

After breaking from his mentally unstable brother Chuck (Michael McKean), who never wanted Jimmy to succeed, Jimmy has given up a lawyers life and is involved in petty cons. Hes abandoned honesty completely because he has never once benefited from being a straitlaced, upstanding citizen. He is attracted to former co-worker Kim (Rhea Seehorn) and decides to pursue both professional credibility and a romantic relationship with Kim. Jimmy discovers a fraudulent billing scheme at the Sandpiper chain of retirement homes and sets in motion a class action suit, which is a success.

Though Jimmy appears finally to be walking the straight and narrow, his future partner in crime Mike (Jonathan Banks) becomes a force trying to lure him back into shady doings.

Season 2 episodes consist of better writing than the premiere season, which often seemed unsure of how to develop Jimmys dramatic journey.  Episodes explore facets of Jimmys life and relationships with Chuck and Kim, the two most influential individuals in his life. Mr. Odenkirk by now inhabits the role of Jimmy effortlessly. We are drawn in by his struggle between traditional success and the conformity it involves, and the temptation to circumvent the law for expediance. Jimmy is a hustler, but its always clear that beneath the shyster lawyer facade and questionable morals, Jimmy has a good heart, and thats what keeps us watching.

Bonus extras on the 3-disc widescreen Blu-ray edition include cast and crew commentaries on all 10 episodes, gag reel, table read for the Switch episode, commercials featuring Jimmy McGill as shown in the show, and several behind-the-scenes featurettes.",1479168000,2,2155,5.252906976744186
7671301,5,B01BZBLP9C,"The dynamics between Jimmy McGill, his brother Chuck and Mike Ehrmantraut gains more momentum, and a bitter sibling rivalry between Chuck and Jimmy becomes apparent. Despite his best efforts Jimmy is plagued by setbacks and solutions to his problems often don't come from honesty. Just as it seems he has put distance between himself and past impropriety the season finishes with a cliffhanging threat to everything he has worked for.
