8393412,1,B003B3OVD0,"In the fine print, you find out the version with the Anne Austen portrait is not a movie.  It is the book text to display on your TV or other devices.  As a book, it should be in the book section.  It should NOT be in with ""movies"".",1519430400,,232,3.7916666666666665
8393413,1,B003B3OVD0,Bad experience.  Returned for refund.  Advertised product was deceptive.,1509753600,,72,6.888888888888889
8393414,1,B003B3OVD0,Had no idea this was a book and not a dvd. Can't image someone using their video player to project a written page on the tv screen. Then you have to read the written script off the tv. Nothing on the package said it was that form.,1506816000,,230,3.9148936170212765
8393415,1,B003B3OVD0,"This is NOT a movie!  It is a DVD of the book Persuasion.  When you start the ""movie,"" you see black words on white pages that turn when you hit ""Play.""  It's suspicious that the name on the front of the disc is ""Anne Austen"" not Jane Austen; however, it did appear to be the actual book.  My guess is that it is some foreign-produced piece of trash.  The good news is that Amazon refunded my money nearly instantly and I did not have to return the disc.  It went in the trash.",1502841600,,477,4.075268817204301
8393416,1,B003B3OVD0,"This was really not a movie DVD, although the review's listed under it are for the movie.  This is a DVD version of a book.  Not even an audio book. You open it up and it flips the pages by DVD.  That's it.  If you want to see a movie - this is not it.",1470096000,,252,3.5272727272727273
