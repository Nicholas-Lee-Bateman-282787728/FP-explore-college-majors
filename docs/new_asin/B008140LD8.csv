5116834,5,B008140LD8,Please make this available in the USA.  I love this series and would love to have this in my collection.  No need for a summary that's been done.  I'm on season 3 right now but this is something I could watch again and again.  If you are reading this and think but it has subtitles trust me you get sucked into the story and can't wait for the next episode.  Addiction at its best.,1436918400,16,381,4.094594594594595
5116835,5,B008140LD8,"This was one of the best TV series I have watched. Even though the subtitles in English left me somewhat confused at times.
The sets, costumes and intrigue were riveting. Murder, harem politics, hysterical women and chauvinistic males made you a compulsive viewer.
Hurrem  ( Meryem Uzerli- a german/Turkish actress) was by turns annoying, vulnerable and frightening
as for Suliman ( Halit Ergen ) was magnificent as he managed a kingdom and a host of troublesome women...
The storyline ran pretty much along historical fact with fiction thrown in for artistic reasons...
A Russian captive brought to the harem in Istanbul captures the heart of the ruler with her barefaced boldness..ruthless manipulative nature and sheer gall. Suliman falls in love with her and marries her....an unheard of thing at that time...
I am so looking forward to Series 2....",1415577600,19,853,5.136690647482014
5116836,5,B008140LD8,"I am trying to get the 6 DVD boxed set in a DVD format that Americans can use in their DVD players (attention Amazon).  My review is on this series currently playing on Mundo Fox TV, a Spanish channel here in New Mexico.  The series is everything I imagined and more.  I lived in Turkey for two years and had occasion to visit the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul.  The film was made in Istanbul, from what I understand.  I recognized some of the outdoor shots of the palace.  Perhaps some of the interior shots as well.  As a scholar of the Ottoman period of Turkey, I appreciate the care that the producer lavished in making this series as true as possible to the historical accounts within the genre of a drama series. The series authentically portrays the setting and culture in most respects.  I sort of wondered at the noticeable shortage of palace staff, harem eunuchs, concubines, and janissaries.  Historically, the palace was like a small town, there were so many people, from the Sultan himself to the lowiest slave that lived in the palace.
Other than that, the costumes were magnificent, the drama riveting, the cast superb in every way.  Watching that show every evening on Mundo Fox was like leaving this present world and stepping into another world at another time.  I have seen some good series, particularly the British ones.  This series tops even Upstairs Downstairs and Sherlock Holmes. But maybe I am biased.  I loved living in Turkey and have fond memories.
I am hopelessly addicted to the show.
I can't understand why some in the Turkish press and government blasted the show.  Granted Turkey will never go back to that kind of period.  However, they had a glorious Ottoman past that contributed many things.
It was a different time and place.  And if anybody complains about the harems, the wholesale slaughter of innocent people, the intrigue and infighting in the higher echelons of power, that occurred back then, all the more that they look at what is going on now in the world (2014).  The saying is that if you don't learn from history, you are destined to repeat it.
And what an imaginative, powerful way to learn from history!  I wish we had this series and others back in the day when I was taking World History in high school. :-)
The maker of this series and all the cast deserve awards.
This series is a must see and a must buy if and when it becomes available.",1406851200,124,2393,4.60377358490566
5116837,5,B008140LD8,"I didn't realize just how good these series are. Lots of intrigue, drama, tears, heartwrench, love drama, twists, assassination plots, killings, wars between countries, and anything else in between. Not to forget that the costumes, the jewelry and the settings are drop dead gorgeous. (SPOILER ALERT).This magnificent series follows the life of Sultan, his first wife Mahidevran and her fall from grace, then second wife Hurem's rise to glory. The Sultan falls in love with her, in the meantime everyone is trying to kill her by poison, beating to death, ambush in the woods, and even burning with fire - Hurem miraculously survives all, and gives Sultan 5 children. In the meantime a Greek slave becomes his Main Advisor, marries Sultan's sister and becomes the head of the army(the general) and gains an utmost power from the king, which makes his succeptible to assassination by poisoned arrow(which he survives). Hurem and Advisor are jealous of each other and Hurem almost manages to poison him through his diary...however, he barely survives it with healer's help. Instead his infant son dies from his poisoned touch. The sister of Sultan almost goes insane from grief, blaming herself for choking the baby while asleep. But shortly after, she bares him twins. After twin's birth, an Advisor starts cheating on her and even buys his mistress a house. In the meantime, Mustafa the Sultan's first born son, is all grown up and is engaged to be married to Crimea's princess Abige. While Abige and Mustafa are engaged, they both are in love with other people. Mustafa's girlfriend - a slave from the harem, becomes pregnant and is trying to keep it secret from everyone. While Abige and Balibay(her love interest, a soldier), are on the ship to Crimea. Well I am still on season 2 and there are two more seasons to watch, so this is the plot so far. The settings are outstanding and so are the special effects. Lots of fire, explosions, ect. One day Hurem dreams of the Dragon and it looks quite scary, just floating outside her bedroom then suddenly breathing a fire ball onto her....at which point she awakes screaming. I highly recommend this series!!! A+++",1395100800,54,2162,4.909836065573771
5116838,5,B008140LD8,"(This review is limited since only the first episode appears to be available with English subtitles. )

Although not a documentary, this sweeping costume drama about Suleiman the Magnificent and his wife, the former Russian slave Roxelana, is historically based.

Set in 16th-century Turkey, the elegant costumes and luxurious sets will transport you to a different era filled with palace intrigue and non-stop political scheming.  From my vague memories of Topkapi Palace, it seems that some of the exteriors were filmed there.

By the end of the 1 hour-40 minute Episode 1, I was totally hooked and hungry for more.  There are at least 63 episodes to this series; quite the potential feast!

The title in English is ""Magnificent Century"". What I saw was the Turkish version with English subtitles. There is also a version dubbed into Arabic called ""Hareem al Sultan"", which has been popularly shown during Ramadan.  I saw a portion of the Arabic-dubbed version which had English subtitles, so perhaps that would be another avenue for English-speaking viewers.

It is my hope that when this DVD becomes available it will have full English subtitles.(pleasepleaseplease)

Until then, I'll continue to scout the Internet in search of more subtitled episodes of this addictive show!",1343692800,98,1280,5.204878048780488

It's (as the title itself) a magnificent portrait of the middle ages. I don't have how to judge accuracy, but I don't care.

5116855,5,B008140LD8,"I love this show! I watched all of Season 1--48 Episodes on Netflix and would gladly pay 1.99 per episode to Amazon (like they do with Game of Thrones and others) if they would get it with the English Subtitles to Season 2 etc. Honestly, all you Game of Thrones fans, here is competition! The costumes, the acting, the setting, just wonderful! I am a huge history fan and also historical fiction fan. What I love about this show is that we get to see the perspective of how Westerners lived and acted vs. the Ottoman Turks. Frankly, I would rather have been one of those women in the harem, who were educated, clothed, fed decent food, and had hot running water during the 1500's than living in the sewers that were Europe. Great to see a production like this, just so want to see Season 2 with subtitles. One plus, have discovered by watching Season 1 first, I am grasping quite a bit of Turkish language by Season 2, not too much I have not understood..View it and enjoy like a rich dessert!",1479254400,13,993,4.4021739130434785
5116856,5,B008140LD8,"I love this series.......couldn't believe that I would watch anything captioned, much less 48 episodes on Netflix.  Love the story line, actors and music in this Drama.  Being American it gives me such respect for the Ottoman Empire and how the Muslim culture drives this Empire.  So wish we were able to buy this series and have it in English.  I think many here in America would learn value from this great series.  It shows Drama, Adventure, Romance and even Comedy at times.  Also watched the series (all 72 episodes) of Lovebird and watched it as well. It's also from Turkey and it's culture, and is more of a Romance series but love it as much as well, however, but I couldn't find any info on it other than on Netflix. Can't wait to watch the rest of the series on both of these series !!",1478995200,6,795,4.410958904109589

However, the first three episodes were richly done, marvelously detailed in sets and costumes, and very well done in terms of the parallel developments on the historical Ottoman Empire under its greatest Sultan, and the drama of the harem politics.
