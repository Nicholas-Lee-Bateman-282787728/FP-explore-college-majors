8303587,2,B001G19MLK,"This is a b-movie with a political edge and a somewhat high-concept narrative device. This is one of those dual narrative mystery flicks where one of the narratives is about stuff that happened in the past..which effects what happens in the present. The idea is clever but it is poorly executed. Mediocre acting, dialogue, directing everything. I watched because of the absolutely enchanting Ludwika Paleta. She is part of that mexican generation of actors that got famous as kids and grew up into the adult actors of today (her, osvaldo benavides, gael garcia, diego luna etc.). Did I mention she is lovely?
Anyway it takes place in San Antonio mostly, and the movie is i will say 60 percent spanish 40 english.",1464825600,,712,4.844262295081967
8303588,5,B001G19MLK,This is an extraordinary! Very well written and crowned with excellent roles played by the actor and actresses. The quality of the pictures also complement this film. Simply a movie that embrace our feelings while challenging our thoughts: What is the past? From were have we came? How does the past shape our characters? You are welcome to enjoy a great film!
