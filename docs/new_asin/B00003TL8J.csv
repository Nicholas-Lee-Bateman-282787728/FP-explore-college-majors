Here's a review of their CD of the same name: ""focuses on Turkish, Kurdish, Azeri, and Anatolian material. Turku also use all traditional instruments including several types of Saz, Violin, Oud, Tar 'another long-necked lute', and various types of percussion 'Davul, dumbek, djembe, riq, etc.'. Their playing is inspired, even striding in the realm of virtuosic, with an obvious ability for improvisation and a good sense of how to build a piece. The material is generally high energy with an emphasis on upbeat numbers."" (Dirty Linen Magazine)

The video was performed in South Carolina. An exciting performance!",1186272000,,707,5.201754385964913
