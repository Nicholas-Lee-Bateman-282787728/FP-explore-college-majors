8335004,1,B001Q4N9OS,"It was not as what it was expected from a DVD. The picture quality is terrible and so is the sound quality. Some pirated DVDs have better picture quality than it does! And to make matters worse, it was not a Live Concert at all. In a Live Concerts there is continuity between songs/performances. In this case, each song is performed separately from the next like a music video or listening to a CD. It was lousy and very very disappointing.",1350691200,2,440,4.444444444444445
