4129273,3,B003J7HO96,"Moby Dick is a fabulous novel, one that has imprinted 19th century whaling into the consciousness of the reading public.  The book uses an innovative structure where it is as much a documentary about whaling, as an adventure narrative, so one learns much about the subject from the book.  What has that got to do with this documentary?  For one, I am probably not the only viewer who watched the film only because of interest aroused by reading the book.  Secondly, Melville was a whaler, and his famous book is part of the story of whaling, and becomes part of this documentary.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers thoughtlessly reveal the ending of the novel.  I am only half-way through the book, and very annoyed to have the ending ruined by this film; everyone knows you don't give away the ending of a book or movie. Even though the book has raised my interest in this film's subject, I found this to be a mediocre documentary.  It keeps shifting gears, is kind of disorganized, and overreaches. Melville's biography is briefly covered in the film, and proves to be quite interesting, but the film gives short shrift to that so it can spend more time on the sensational story of the survivors of a whaling ship that was sunk by a whale.  (Right on!) Sure, it's an interesting story, but that survival tale really has nothing to do with whaling.  And then there are those endless shots of a pretty modern replica of a whaling ship; there must be 100 of them.  An I was hoping for shots and information about sperm whales (the focus of Moby Dick, and the prized catch for whalers.) You will learn far more about whaling from reading Moby Dick, which obsesses about all things whale-related (and does so wonderfully).  But if you are not one to read long novels, this film will give you a taste of what whaling was all about, in much less time.  And for those who have already finished the book, the film provides some context to the whaling industry not covered in the book, and a chance to see what those ships and what a whale hunt really looks like.",1356134400,,2051,4.55858310626703
4129274,5,B003J7HO96,"Wow.  Two whole hours of this.  I could not be more satisfied.  I'm hugely into this sort of stuff but until now have never found a satisfying documentary about the business of whaling.  I was afraid this was going to agonizingly short (e.g., 30 minutes), but no!  After two hours of exploring every possible angle of American whaling, you'll be hard-pressed to come up with something the documentary did not do right.",1312070400,,418,4.75
4129275,3,B003J7HO96,"This has all the strengths of a Burns' special (This time Ric, not his brother Ken): a great topic, informed sometimes colorful experts and a storyline that takes you from start to finish in a cohesive manner. This documentary is especially good the way it ties in the career of writer Herman Melville. If this documentary has a fault, it relies too much on narrative and not enough on film. It is after all a movie, but you almost doubt it after a while. You could listen to this DVD in another room and not miss much.
Yet, there aren't that many films out there on this subject, so it's hard to be too critical.",1300320000,3,613,4.339130434782609
4129276,4,B003J7HO96,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this DVD but soon after popping it into the DVD player, I was hooked.  It covers, sometimes in great detail, the 400+ year history of whaling off the American shores.  The first Pilgrims who landed here saw a pod of sperm whale and soon word spread that there were plenty of them to help heat those cold cabins.  Makes one wonder if the large pods in the Atlantic were one reason so many came here?  Whaling was a big industry and everyone wanted a piece of the pie.  Whaling was a big piece of our American heritage.

It's a brutal living, though.  At times this documentary goes into great detail of how a whale was killed.  The animal didn't always die right away, sometimes it dragged a hapless ship with it for miles before it weakened and finally blew its final bloody spew.  Young men often joined a ship for the adventure of catching a whale, of sailing around the Americas, and making it rich.

There are stories here about the doomed Essex whaling ship, that lost 12 men and the remaining survived on cannibalism.  There are stories of ships getting capsized by a large whale, throwing an entire crew into the rough seas.  This documentary shows how a town like Nantucket made a living for itself before it was overtaken by other coastal towns like Bedford.

Watching this video makes one realize why Hermann Melville was so passionate about his story ""Moby Dick"" but died before the story caught on.

This is a little bit history, reenactment, story-telling.  It's nicely weaved together into a two-hour documentary.  I only took a star off because of its sometimes graphic depictions of whale killing, and the graphic photos of skinned whales.  This may be a bit too much for young children although the story is definitely here.

This documentary takes no bias.  Yes, whales were hunted to near extinction, just like the buffalo.  Back in the 1800s conservation and environmentalism were unheard of; making money off all natural resources was the thing to do.  Whaling only died out in the 1850s because of improving technologuies, the discovery of oil in western PA, and other modern inventions of the 19th century.  It makes you think and wonder how other major craftsmen lived in the 17th and 18th century:  the wainwright or the carpenter, for instance.  It's definitely worth a watch.",1292544000,,2345,4.719211822660099
4129277,5,B003J7HO96,"PBS's ""Into the Deep: America, Whaling and the World"" is hands-down one of the best documentaries ever made, on any subject. I was captivated within just the first few minutes of the original broadcast and in viewing the program in its entirety; my interest was piqued in a subject matter to which I had absolutely no prior interest.

The eloquent narration, period imagery, authoritative historical commentary, and beautiful cinematography, all combined to make this a program of the highest production standards. The incredible story of the whaling ship ""Essex"" as well as Hermann Melville and writing and publication of ""Moby Dick"" are seamlessly interwoven into the program's narrative timeline of the history of American whaling. What results is first class documentary making and an incredible journey for the viewer.

Whatever your opinions are on the subject matter, view this program with an open-mind and without prejudice. The story of the American Whaling is inextricably linked to the story of American History, and it could not be presented in any finer a fashion than in this documentary.",1292112000,6,1103,5.261363636363637
4129278,5,B003J7HO96,"This is the best American Experience documentary I have ever seen.  It astounded me as I learned about the early whaling industry in this county - my mouth was open in surprise and awe at the feats performed by whalers.  I understood the importance of Moby Dick after seein the film - I fully understood how only a few years lie between us and the height of the whaling industry (1820-1850), and how completely different that era was.  There was so much to learn and get a hold of in this film, that I saved it on my DVR, and have showed it to many friends.  I can't tear myself away from it the third, fourth or fifth times.  This whole section was left out of my American History book.",1285632000,4,687,4.253846153846154
4129279,4,B003J7HO96,"This 2 hour PBS Special is part of the excellent oevre of Ric Burns - the brother of Ken Burns of ""Civil War"" fame. Ric Burns did the PBS miniseries on ""New York"" which is one of the very best mini-series ever made.

He has done other documentaries such as ""Coney Island.""  This movie is almost as good as his others. The filmmaker focuses on three subjects:  (1) A Dramatization of the story of  ""The Essex"" - the whaling ship that was ferociously attacked by a sperm whale in 1819 which became the inspiration behind the novel ""Moby Dick.""  (2) A biography of Herman Melville - particularly his whaling experience  (3) A quick overview of whaling history in New England with an emphasis on Nantucket and New Bedford.  The most interesting part of whale history caught on film is old black and white footage of original sailors catching a whale and then cutting it up on the whale ship.  Awesome and terrible...in all senses of the words.

Ric Burns probes why the whaling industry was so important during the early years of the industrial revolution - because whale oil and whale baleen were used for lamps and commercial products before the era of petroleum and plastics.  Excessive hunting of the whales and the birth of the petrochemical industry destroyed the whale industry of America...I am curious why ships from other nations still hunt the whale. That is not explained.

The tale of the Essex is as haunting an event as the tragedy of the Donner Party. Some starving seamen descended to cannibalism to stay alive.  The demise of the ship was as well known in the 19th century as the sinking of the Titanic is in the 20th century.  Why the tale slowly disappeared from the American national memory is still a mystery.",1279756800,6,1727,4.66006600660066

8397881,4,B003J7HO96,"A sprawling, sometimes unfocused, usually fascinating and occasionally moving look at U.S. whaling from the early days of the colonies, to the beginning of the 20th century. It does a very good job of capturing both the awful brutality, and incredible danger of the hunts.

There are some talking heads, but much more is a very pleasing mix of old drawings, photographs, and modern photography of scrimshaw
and whaling boats (often not re- enactments as much as just striking images of the vessels at sea).

For the first while the film focuses on the early history of U.S. whaling, explaining how important it was to the industrial revolution, being the
major source of oil for lighting and lubrication before the days of ground based petroleum products It also explains how the riches from whaling literally paid for much of the nation's expansion.

It then switches tacks to tell the harrowing true story of the doomed whaling ship ""The Essex"", a story which helped prompt Herman Melville
to write ""Moby Dick"". The film then spends a good deal of time on ""Moby Dick"" itself, with some excellent dramatic readings by Robert Sean
Leonard, and the examination of the novel's story and its themes (with spoilers for those not familiar with the book). It also briefly traces how ""Moby Dick"" fared in the literary world, and then circles back around for a cursory mention of the end of traditional whaling and the rise of industrial whaling in the early 20th century.

For me, this last transition is handled too quickly and off-handedly, the revelation that whale populations were far more depleted by the 20th century whaling than in all the whaling done before  which feels contradictory to what the film had been implying up until then.

But those flaws are minor, and overall this is a very good, if slightly scattered, look at a way of life that was a far bigger part of U.S. history than I ever realized.",1388275200,5,1908,4.801829268292683
