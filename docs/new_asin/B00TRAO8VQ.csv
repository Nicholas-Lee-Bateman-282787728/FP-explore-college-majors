7020887,5,B00TRAO8VQ,"Gotta love these cowboy underdogs beating the odds! That race is one of the most inspiring things you'll ever see. You'll never see a better long shot win. The characters are great. Wish I could go grab a beer with Mark Allen, Chip Wooley, and most of all Doc Blach!",1428105600,12,266,4.34
7020888,5,B00TRAO8VQ,"I have been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD! This movie was so good, that I wanted to jump up and shout in the movie theater. This true to life story was so much fun.",1427587200,,176,3.6578947368421053
7020889,5,B00TRAO8VQ,"I saw this movie on one of my flights, great feel good movie, did not want my flight to end so I could watch it again. definitely one for the library!",1425945600,9,150,3.870967741935484
7020890,5,B00TRAO8VQ,"I loved 50 to 1! My husband and I drove 2hrs to see it in limited release in Grand Rapids, MI. It is a wonderful story adapted into a very entertaining, family friendly movie. I look forward to owning it on DVD so I can watch again and again and share the fun with my children.",1424649600,21,277,3.9642857142857144
7020891,5,B00TRAO8VQ,"I am so excited to finally get to order 50 to 1!! I drove from Illinois to Kentucky to meet some of the cast and filmmakers and see the movie on the big screen during their tour of the country. It is a fun movie for the whole family, and I highly recommend owning this one. Christian Kane does an amazing job as Mark Allen. Christian is my favorite actor, and two of his songs are also featured. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and cheer! We need more feel-good movies like this that are appropriate for all ages.",1424563200,40,518,4.19
7020892,5,B00TRAO8VQ,"My Wife and I have seen this excellent movie twice so far by driving from Lansing, MI to Grand Rapids, MI because that was the closest Celebration Theater that was showing the film.  If you like the odds of 50 to 1, then you will really enjoy the dedicated build up, suspense, and friendships of two friends trying everything they could think up in order to bring a Canadian horse to the United States, with all of the ongoing trials, tribulations, and humor in the process.  Plus the absolutely suspenseful Kentucky Derby Race finish, will get you cheering at the end of the movie.  Guaranteed, it is a true story with the live finish, plus the fact that the Jockey Calvin Borel that actually rode 'Mine That Bird' in the original Kentucky Derby, was also the Jockey in the '50 to 1 Movie.",1424390400,56,790,4.510489510489511
7020893,5,B00TRAO8VQ,"Had they not incorporated actual footage of the race, you wouldn't believe this is a true story! Whereas similar movies are more dramatic with traces of comedy, this is more comedic with some incredibly heartfelt moments. This is definitely NOT a retread of similarly-themed movies. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Fun for the whole family!",1424304000,34,348,5.232142857142857

7020895,5,B00TRAO8VQ,"Can't give any Chris Kane movies any less....his irreplacable grin should make me President of his fan club....but I confess...I breed TB's and have raced them....The general public will NEVER comprehend what these two rascally owners and one beat up cowboy trainer did with a USA bred Canandian run Gelding!  And while Hollywood had to make them out to be less savy than they were.....This Horse and His story are what Dreams are Made of!  And to put a great natured cajun, like Calvin BO-RAIL thru all those silly hijinks just shows how great a jock and gentleman he is!  DID you replay that last quarter mile of the Derby?  WOW!
If you have access to the actual press coverage when they walked the Bird over to race all NBC could talk about was a trainer on crutches and the fact he drove his horse from NM to KY........Racing is about the horse and HIS PEOPLE........wish the network had done it's research, someone counted 1,000 ways a horse could lose a race, but fav's win 33% of the time....so the reporters were left with more mud on their faces than Calvin or Mine That Bird!",1528588800,,1085,4.5487179487179485

7020918,3,B00TRAO8VQ,"Group of people purchase a supposedly quality horse to run races. When entered the horse does poorly and the ownership group is essentially bu$ted due to debts owed.  The trainer goes out and has a motorcycle accident. They get a call that the horse is qualified for the Kentucky Derby due to wins in Canada! A cross country road trip ensues with relationship drama and the requisite bar fight.

They all eventually arrive a t Church Hill Downs where they are derided for their cowboy backgrounds. A jockey is located and the race is on. Was unaware of this before watching. For the most part this feels hokey, only at the very end does it pick up. Also see 'Seabiscuit' and 'Pharlap'  Some swearing.",1500768000,,700,4.629032258064516

7020938,4,B00TRAO8VQ,"I just watched ""50 to 1"" and absolutely loved it! Even though the ending was known, the film was able to create the feeling of hope, fear, anxiety, and stress felt by the core characters. During the Derby race, I found myself praying, hoping, and jumping around along with the main characters. Definitely worth watching.",1484870400,,320,4.836363636363636

7020946,5,B00TRAO8VQ,"Worth the footage of the home stretch run in the KY Derby to see  Borel's boot scrim the top of the rail creating a rooster tail as he pushes Bird through! Though I follow the sport and was a breeder/owner-trainer. I never knew Bird was the 2 year old champion in Canada! He wasn't a backwater NM wonder that stumbled into the Derby. This movie got caught flat footed by California Chrome's Derby win the week it was released.
Chrome's breeding was/is underrated and the Jack Ass Partnership was a better media story than Bird's.",1480032000,,529,4.568421052631579

be cowboys in this modern influenced world...but really the best actor was the horse.  The acting and some of the contrived situations were
truly awful and I had to force myself to keep watching knowing the ""great"" horse race would be coming up sooner or later.  There was not one
creditable acting performance in my opinion.  But.  The running of the Kentucky Derby and the horse winning in the end was worth a watch.",1465776000,,563,4.88421052631579

7020997,4,B00TRAO8VQ,This movie never made it to the big screen and I don't understand whyI am a horseplayer so naturally I would be attracted to such a movie  but after viewing it I am sure the general public would enjoy it as much as I did. It was based on a true story and actual film from the big race was used a well as the jockey Calvin BurrellThe story line was pretty accurate and the acting was all first class and even though it was a typical underdog movie hollywood did not take too many liberties with the story..very enjoyable feel good movie,1463961600,,535,4.194174757281553

7021002,4,B00TRAO8VQ,"""50 to 1"" is the kind of movie that jaded film critics may sneer at, and I can see why this might be so. The whole thing is predictable, as are some of the situations along the way... many characters don't have a lot of depth... the snobbery against our heroes is played obviously and to the hilt.. the horse keeps getting given donuts...  etc. Be all this as it may, I have to admit that I enjoyed watching it. Sure, it's a bit corny, but it's also a lot of fun. The fact that it's based on an unlikely true story only made it more enjoyable for me. Jockey Calvin Borel, playing himself, is given some silly comic scenes that really did have me cracking up, as did a few other zany touches. And heck, we all love loyal, underdog winners. So, get out the popcorn and have a good time watching this fun, uplifting movie.",1463097600,,819,4.2165605095541405

I wish the movie had gone more into the horse himself or the training, as opposed to the partying lives of the owners. Their lives were not as deep or interesting as the ones found with the characters in Seabiscuit.",1462838400,,275,4.612244897959184

7021008,1,B00TRAO8VQ,I was very disappointed.  I received the first DVD and it was not closed captioned.  I returned it and again went online to try to reorder or see what was advertised.  The advertisement from a 3rd party said there were closed captions.  So I reordered.  When I got the DVD I looked closely at the Jacket and it also said there were closed captions (CC).  No closed captions.  So I had to send back as I have a hearing disability and need the CCs.  Advertising was incorrect as was the language on the jacket and I have no idea who created the jacket or the DVD.  Not happy!!!!  I'm sure the story was great I just couldn't get it all 1st time around (ordered from Net Flix).,1462320000,2,674,4.2362204724409445

The first part of the movie builds the story of how these two Cowboys met and got reacquainted 10 years later. The story keeps building by adding the history of the horse, ""Mine that Bird,"" and its antics as they train it to race, eventually ending up at the Kentucky Derby.",1452384000,,458,4.725

The Director and Producer nailed it.
Let me also say it is not a family film for young viewers.
For those of you who have ""really mature10-14 year-olds"", I'd say that if you can leave them home by themselves for a weekend, or let them take your car out, they are old enough. The film has some racy content and language not appropriate for children's ears.
Even though we pretty much had an idea of how it would end, the story kept us at the edge of our seat.

Of course the extra ""cherry on the pie"" in regard to Mine that Bird is because he is from here in Roswell, New Mexico where I live and is just a couple miles down the road from us.  I have to watch the race every once in a while on youtube because it was just phenomenal.  Although he didn't achieve becoming the next triple crown winner he did a great job by coming in 2nd and then 3rd in the next races and I'm not sure other horses who have won the Kentucky Derby did that well.  His whole story is just great.  He's ""our horse"" so we are very proud.",1441756800,7,674,3.9925373134328357

7021112,4,B00TRAO8VQ,Fun show.  I read about the movie in a magazine and couldn't wait to order it.  After watching it I had to google the actual race and watch several video clips of the real race and the real people,1440288000,,196,4.0
7021113,4,B00TRAO8VQ,"Great Movie! I was at my first Kentucky Derby the year that Mine that Bird won, so it holds a special place in my heart. The movie is fun and humorous, and I love that Calvin Borel stars as himself in the movie. The only thing I didn't like was how they portrayed Bob Baffert (white hair) as an uppity jerk, he's actually a very humble trainer that has had lots of successes! Also, there are some bar scenes, adult flirty scenes (no nudity or anything) that makes me question its suitability for younger children. Overall a fun movie!",1440028800,,534,4.404040404040404

7021116,5,B00TRAO8VQ,"50 to 1 is a wonderful surprise. I am not a fan of horse racing, but I was looking for a feel good movie when it came on my radar. The actors are fantastic & do an excellent job at portraying characters who are essentially good guys but not the goody two shoes type. Skeet Ulrich is particularly impressive in his role as the underdog horse trainer. You're actually rooting for these cowboys to win! The dynamic between Chip & Alex was so much fun to watch & even though I knew the outcome of the big race my heart was still pounding. It's such an enjoyable family movie without any of the cheese.",1439683200,2,597,4.245614035087719
7021117,3,B00TRAO8VQ,"The movie was a little slow, very gradually building to something though never Really reaching a climax until the end. The characters & relationships seemed disconnected and underdeveloped at times, felt like the spark was missing. The best scenes were the horse scenes, especially the races. I would only recommend this movie if you want to see a good horse race - I almost cried with excitement and wish. Too bad the rest of the movie was lacking.",1439683200,,449,4.769230769230769

7021125,2,B00TRAO8VQ,"I rented this one based on the reviews I found at Amazon alone and have to say I was sorely disappointed. I read several reviews that said it appropriate for all ages and could not disagree more. The language and the sexual suggestiveness makes it inappropriate for kids and young teens, in my opinion. I was trying to overlook the language even though most of it could have been left out without affecting the story but finally cut it off during the bus party scene about half way through. I hate to think that parents would be sitting with their teenage daughters and not feel uncomfortable during that scene. I noticed one reviewer here said that the last two minutes were the best part of the movie, so I put the movie back in and skipped ahead to the final race. What that horse did was phenomenal, but not worth the rental price for this movie. Seeing the footage that ran in the credits lets you know what the real owners looked like and gives me great doubt about the party lifestyle that is portrayed here. The movie should have been more about the horse and less about fabricating a story around its owners.",1438560000,,1117,4.480392156862745

So heartwarming that even though you know that Mine That Bird wins, you're so caught up in the story, you have no idea that it's possible. You stand and cheer with tears in your eyes! AMAZING! How could you feel this way? It's the perfection of the story, the knowledge that Mr. Wilson infuses into every aspect! No wonder he's an Oscar winning director!",1438041600,,531,4.659574468085107

Kane in those blue shirts that bring out his blue eyes and those red shirts that bring out his skin tone. Christian Kane in those cowboy hats and fitted jeans with that accent and charm. Pretty much, if you like Christian Kane (calling all Kaniacs), you'll be satisfied. The story itself is pretty good. There are some unnecessary scenes that make it a little boring, but good film quality and a little comical at times. Not too shabby.",1435708800,,554,4.606060606060606

7021287,1,B00TRAO8VQ,"I hate giving negative reviews, but this was just terrible. I don't think it was the acting... the story and writing were so extremely bad that the factories the best they could. It felt like something a 5th grader would write. The plot was so simple, it could be explained in two minutes... by a slow talker. The characters were very one-dimensional and kept behaving absolutely horribly. Awful behaviors, incredible levels of immaturity and just plain stupidity. And the girl was so extreme in her hostility, it is impossible to believe she wouldn't be fired right off. Even the music was stupid. Perhaps the demographic for this film is 7th graders. Seriously... I wonder whom the audience is for this ghastly thing. Had to fast forward a lot.",1432425600,,746,4.8359375

7021298,1,B00TRAO8VQ,"Huge disspointment for racing fans -
Mine that Bird winning the KY Derby is certainly movie material at 50-1 unfortunately the story runs a muck in the writing and portrayal of the team.  The actual race is the best feature of the film. Calvin Borel's ride is amazing and Mine that Bird proves to be a worthy contender as he finished 2nd in the Preakness and 3rd in the Belmont.  Too bad - this movie could have been as awesome as Mine that Bird!",1431907200,3,446,4.2976190476190474
7021299,5,B00TRAO8VQ,Good movie,1431907200,,10,4.5
7021300,4,B00TRAO8VQ,"Enjoyed this film. The script on a scale of 1 to 10 is about a 7 to 7.5 which is ok but I would have preferred some of the debauchery left out as well as Baffert's reference to God, ""I don't believe he would win even if he had God riding for him"". Just part of the script for effect I imagine because I don't believe Baffert is really that way? (Such an irony that the horse Bird beat that day, Pioneer of the Nile, is the sire of this years winner American Pharoah who is on his way to Belmont with at least a chance at winning the Triple.) The acting is good for the most part, Borel was great. The real gem in this work is the actual race footage, simply one of the most exciting derby performances on film, from a bird's eye view watching the Bird thread the needle in full stride under a precision ride by a jockey who is one of this country's best. That alone makes this film worth viewing and owning. The film closes beautifully with Borel's rose toss, actual footage. I would probably score this film a little closer to a 4.5, but that is not an option. Have fun viewers, enjoy the race......
Bird on that day ran like he was 1 to 50 instead of the opposite.",1431907200,3,1166,4.118421052631579

7021304,1,B00TRAO8VQ,"Best part of this movie is the last few minutes when Calvin Borel a jockey not an actor does the best acting in the entire movie!  The horse is good too.  The rest of the movie makes New Mexico people look like a bunch of idiots.  We fast forwarded through much of it.  I'm just glad I had the ability to do that and was not watching it in a movie theatre.  Awesome story just never got me that much INTO the story until the race.

Not a family movie.

As a sucker for the underdog I felt an affinity for these cowboys and their horse as they made their way eventually to the Derby. Reliving that race scene got the adrenaline going, and I couldn't help but urge the horse along and cheer when he crossed the finish line so far ahead of the others. Christian Kane gave his usual strong performance in role he obviously embraced. Definitely a watch-again film.",1431043200,,465,4.753086419753086

The film incorporated very corny material; ie the jockey steps on a rake and gets hit in the head.  The microwave blows up etc.  The horse scenes are questionable as well; the horse gets out of his stall, picks up a hose and sprays people, eats flowers etc. I would compare it to the Three Stooges. This film provided the information that it had CLOSED CAPTION and  it didn't.  Trying to decide to return it or keep it.  Had another one that said closed caption and didn't have it, so returned it to Amazon.  Excellent return policy.",1430870400,2,632,4.443478260869565

7021351,3,B00TRAO8VQ,"During the 2009 Kentucky Derby, long-shot contender Mine That Bird started in last place and wound up winning the race in an amazing, come-from-behind upset. 50 to 1 is the story of the thoroughbreds history-making victory and refers to the betting odds against his winning.

Unfortunately, director Jim Wilson focuses more on the people than the horse, attempting to create some drama along the way. Were introduced to the horses team  trainer, owner, etc.  but theres a lopsided balance when it comes to focus. The real star here is the horse, but the director doesnt devote enough screen time to the horses background, training, previous races, or the reasons he was thought by the odds makers to be such a long shot. Hollywood enjoys stories about sports miracles, and 50 to 1 follows that tried-and-true formula. Though the outcome is known, the movie succeeds in holding and involving the viewer.

Skeet Ulrich (Law & Order: LA) stars as Chip Wooley, Mine That Birds trainer and Christian Kane appears as Mark Allen, the horses owner. Appearing as himself is Hall of Fame jockey Calvin Borel, who guided Mine That Bird along the rail to pass 18 horses in 20 + seconds for his astonishing win.

Bonus features on the DVD release include a making-of features and a blooper reel.",1430092800,22,1282,4.862385321100917

7021353,4,B00TRAO8VQ,"""The losing streak is over. You just have to have a little faith."" Chip Woolley (Ulrich) is a horse trainer that is having a hard time making ends meet. When he asks Mark (Kane), his old friend, for a job he is sent off to look at a new racehorse to buy. When he comes back with Mine That Bird things don't go as planned. I have stated many times that I am a sucker for sports movies. Any type of sports movie. I am not a horse racing fan at all and have never actually seen a race on TV or otherwise. I do have to admit that having said that I have really liked Seabiscuit, Secretariat, and even The Cup. I would add this movie to the list as well. This has tenseness and heart. The acting is surprisingly good for a lower budget movie and I really enjoyed this. There are a few fights in this but this is a pretty decent family movie and I recommend it. Overall, a movie that not just fans of horse racing will like. I did. I surprisingly give this a B+.",1429574400,,956,4.010471204188482

7021355,4,B00TRAO8VQ,"50 to 1 just about describes the odds of a low-budget, small-studio movie with mostly B-list talent and a writer-director of former box-office disappointments being able to compete with slicker big-studio horse racing titles.

But Ill tell you right now, like Mine That Bird, the subject of this 2014 sport drama with comedic moments, 50 to 1 beats the odds. I liked it as much as Seabiscuit (2003) and Secretariat (2010).

Notice I said liked it as much rather than as good as. The budgets for Seabiscuit and Secretariat were respectively 8.7 and 3.5 times larger and the production values sometimes show it. The script for 50 to 1 also is more uneven, with character development that falls a little short. But while William Devane is the most recognizable name actor onboard, the cast does a good job of making you believe their characters.

Everybody loves an underdog story, and 50 to 1 is a doozy.  The horse, a smaller-than-usual gelding with a strange walk has been running as slow as can be and gets no respect. Neither does the rag-tag group of New Mexico cowboys and their families who own him, train him, ride him, invest in him, and, most importantly, believe in him. Theyre not wealthy dabblers who race horses as a hobby. They need one good horse to help them keep their stables in business, and with creditors knocking at the door they're as much of an underdog as Mine That Bird. Even if you're an urbanite, its tough not to appreciate this rough-around-the-edges group and the joy they take in the small things in life. Theyre not phony posers, they're real people, so when the snobs in racing circles treat them as if they were the Clampetts from The Beverly Hillbillies, its hard not to secretly (or not so secretly) pull for them to show those bluebloods a thing or two.

When the starting gates open, 50 to 1 runs a bit like Mine That Bird, getting off to a slow start and then pulling off a third-act burst of energy that leaves you emotionally wrung out at the end. It offers a pretty big pay-off for a little film that really features a plot that isn't as dramatic as were used to seeing from Hollywood.  Maybe thats because it stays pretty close to the real story that inspired itso much so that if you find yourself doing a double take when the end credits roll and the real footage shows the same jockey as the actor who played him, its because jockey Calvin Borel played himself. Theres an authentic feel to the film, and touches like that make a difference.

But 50 to 1 does play up the cowboy angle. In fact, the most PG-13 moment in the whole movie is the opening scene, which celebrates a barroom brawl the way that old John Wayne movies once did. It subtly celebrates macho culture, too, with a couple of cowboys bonding early in the film and then reuniting years later. But theirs was a tale of two fortunes. One (Christian Kane) went to Alaska and made a pile of money working the oil rigs, then invested in a horse racing operation that could afford its own airplane and a $500,000 payout for a promising horse.  The other (Skeet Ulrich) is a surlier sort who came to his old friend for a trainers job in order to help raise money to stave off bankruptcy on the stable that he and his brother owned and operated. Throw in a kindly old investor (Devane), a female wannabe jockey (Madelyn Deutch), who, like everyone else, gets no respect, and you have a film that seems familiar as can be. But at some point you get hooked, and that makes it all worthwhile.

Though its rated PG-13, Ive seen PG movies that have had as much fighting and adult situations (drinking, suggestive remarks), and Im guessing that such things will fly right over the heads of young viewers.

Language: The usual damns and hells, mostly
Sex:  None
Violence: One bar brawl and another near-brawl
Adult situations:  Suggestive remarks and situations, but no romance or one-night stands
Takeaway:  Sometimes a movie can surprise you . . . same as this horse
