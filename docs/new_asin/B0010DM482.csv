I've seen the trailers for it and it has impressed me just like Guyver and Vampire Hunter D did. I also like the idea that it takes place between the games and fills in spots that were left out.

3048691,4,B0010DM482,"Ah, the Devil May Cry anime. Where to start... well the anime takes place in between Devil May Cry 1 and 4, and it works to bridge the two stories together. Each episode has it's own story, with a series-long storyline in the background until the last couple of episodes. The great part about this series is that it shows Dante's life as a demon mercenary rather than him inadvertently following in Sparda's footsteps in defeating a major threat. Madhouse and Capcom did a great job appealing to fans as well, as they brought back Lady and Trish for the storyline. There is quite a bit of character development in Dante's sidekick in the series, Patty, but other than that the recurring characters are the same that fans know and love.

I give this anime a 4 out of 5 only because I wish there were more episodes and I wanted to see a bit more of what Dante exhibits in the video games. Other than that a must-see!",1201824000,7,914,4.408284023668639

Devil May Cry is one of the better ones.  The series follows the day to day life of Dante, demon slayer for hire
through his business (which is named Devil May Cry).  A lot of action, surprises, comedy moments and quite a
bit of Dante is explained.  Even if one never played the games... one can view the series without feeling of

3048699,5,B0010DM482,"SO I'm a fan of the games. And as a fan I always felt this series deserved an anime if not a live-action film (though THAT I doubt will ever happen). Well FUNimation and Madhouse have done us all a favor and given us a quick shot of stylish goodness in the form of Devil May Cry: The Animated Series. First off my only two complaints; too short, and no ""Devil Trigger."" Other than that it's great. Great art, decent stories and superb action. The English voice cast is pretty good too, with Rueben Langdon (credited as Justin Cause) reprising the role of Dante from the DMC3&4 games.

Dante comes off just as cocky as he did in DMC3, but with the maturity that he showed in DMC4. I was really upset the show only ran 12 episodes though. Can we get an OVA or something. But I digress, this show has everything a DMC fan could want, Dante, Trish and Lady, plus new characters Morrison and Patty lighten things up and make Dante seem not so lonely.

Yes it's a ""Monster of the day"" anime, but when you think of it, that's Dante's job. Going from job to job dispatching demons, and every now and then fighting a big bad, which we get at the end. As video game translations go this is one of the better ones. Unfortunately as I said no ""Devil Trigger,"" Dante's ability to become a devil for a limited time, though it apparently does happen off camera, and flashes briefly for a second.
Bottom Line: If you like the series of games, get this series as a companion. Also check out the novels that expand on Dante's background.",1244419200,,1519,4.345070422535211
3048700,5,B0010DM482,"Devil May Cry, based off the popular video game series (like I need to say that...)is a greatly entertaining series.  Without going into detail of each episode, Dante is doing what Dante does best, going around looking good, killing demons and not really getting paid for it (due mostly to his horrible debts).  The first episode introduces us to two new characters, Morrison (who finds jobs for Dante) and Patty Lowell (an orphan girl he protects in the first episode, and then can't seem able to get rid of.)  You will be very familiar with these two, since they are in just about every episode.

It's funny, there's more hilarious quirks to love about Dante (like his affection for strawberry sundaes... very manly), Lady and Trish make their appearances, and, can't believe I'm saying this, but the dub overall is so good I might actually prefer it to the subbed (Morikawa Toshiyuki, who plays the Japanese Dante, is one of my faves, but the dub actor, Reuben Langdon but credited as Justin Cause, is really good and sounds a bit sexier.  He's also been Dante since DMC3 so it's consistency and yay for that!!!)  It's a monster of the week series, and at 12 episodes, it ends too soon for me.

It has a musical score that fits with the overall mood of the series (such as Rungran's Opening D.M.C. with its guitar riffs and up-beat orchestra) to the faithful character designs from the games in addition to new ones along with how these individuals are portrayed.

-The animation is good quality. The more detailed and realistic style suits DMC very well too.

Cons:
-Dumbed down and too light hearted.  This is not the gritty DMC I was expecting. While it's still a dark series (we are slaying demons after all), the characters' interactions with each other are annoyingly childish and seem out of character.
-No plot.  Oh there are few threads of it, but generally the show is a series of one shots that honestly could have been written as fanfiction.
-Battle scenes fail.  Seriously, this should have been the core of the anime and instead it's another disappoint.  Fights are short and generally unimpressive.

Most anime get their own video game AFTER having a series.
Devil May Cry, however is another example of how good an anime series coming FROM a video game is.
Gungrave is the only other ""game to anime"" series I can think of.
And both Gungrave and DMC, both Capcom games, have been transformed into some of the best anime of all time.  I really wish there were more games that took this route.

Do NOT think for a second that this game or anime are the typical ""make an anime, shoot some crapware out"" anime to video game regularity.

This is one for any anime fan and any devil may cry fan.
Great writing, top notch animation, and tons of fresh, fun, originality that makes this anime stand out among the crowd.

If you're a fan of Devil May Cry then you definately don't want to miss this Dante with all the attitude that you know him for.",1203638400,12,687,4.614754098360656

Most anime get their own video game AFTER having a series.
Devil May Cry, however is another example of how good an anime series coming FROM a video game is.
Gungrave is the only other ""game to anime"" series I can think of.
And both Gungrave and DMC, both Capcom games, have been transformed into some of the best anime of all time.  I really wish there were more games that took this route.

Do NOT think for a second that this game or anime are the typical ""make an anime, shoot some crapware out"" anime to video game regularity.

This is one for any anime fan and any devil may cry fan.
Great writing, top notch animation, and tons of fresh, fun, originality that makes this anime stand out among the crowd.

Five Stars.

8237697,3,B0010DM482,"The story had promise but they didn't give it enough episodes to let it breath and grow .  The potential of series is boundless but instead of creating a masterpiece , they took a giant dump on these lovely characters.",1368316800,,218,4.45
8237698,4,B0010DM482,"Awesome show but it's missing one very important aspect; Dante's Devil Trigger! I thought this show would be like the video game, where in the toughest of times, Dante will need to use devil trigger form. That's when he transforms himself to his demon appearance and gain more power, speed, and skills. I don't know why they didn't do that. It was a very big part of the video game, and it would had been awesome to see.

It wasn't like they didn't know about it either. They had Dante foes turn into Demon form, and that gave them more power, but Dante himself didn't do it. Does that mean he couldn't do it? I don't know because it doesn't show or explain this at all.

I thought at the very end of the series that...okay. Maybe, just maybe, this will be the time. Will he finally do it? Will he...transform because it looks like he needs MORE POWER!!! Then, it happened!

Nothing!!!

Dante, just suddenly believes he can do anything, and he does. I don't know where he gets his sudden burst of strength & energy, but he does, and process to kick the last bad guy butt like nothing. What??? He didn't need to transform? He didn't have any energy/strength to continue on, and now we are supposed to believe he does? What in the world? He didn't need that extra boost that his devil form will give him? He had it in him all this time? Was he just playing dead? Rally? All he needed was believe in himself and someone to tell him that. BOO!

There you go, he wins like nothing. That's the end of the series and WTF?

This show would had got 5 stars, but is only 4 because I don't know why they didn't have Devil Trigger!!!",1338076800,,1621,4.298360655737705
8237699,4,B0010DM482,"Me again here to help you find a good product for you :)
This episode was trying to take a humorous tone; first of all Dante is not on the screen that much it's mostly about some blond guy who's jealous about this girl who has a thing for Dante, not that he notices. It was really funny and the ending made me chuckle for a moment.",1335916800,,331,3.955223880597015
8237700,2,B0010DM482,"This episode was weak. Weak as in not very exciting, I could almost guess the plot when it reached the halfway mark. The only funny thing is when Dante is in the prison but I will not spoil it for anyone who really does want to see it. I just felt they could have done something different. There were only one or two fight sequences the last one was pretty good but the first one bored me to death. Personally it's the weakest episode out of the bunch so far.",1335916800,,459,4.111111111111111
