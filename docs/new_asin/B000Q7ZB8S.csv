8194866,5,B000Q7ZB8S,The video is great. Mifune is an icon in the world of Judo. He plays a wonderful role in history and the techniques in the video are good quality given the time they were done. I would recommend it to anywone that is interested in Judo history.,1374796800,,244,4.212765957446808
8194867,3,B000Q7ZB8S,"The content is 10/10, Mifune is great :)

I am surprised that this DVD is a copy of a videotape.
The DVD itself is a simple DVD+/-R (blue color) and not
a ""pressed"" one.
The cover is something like a zoomed bitmap w/o blurs,
pixelated.
It is also very unfortunate that the original Japanese
audio is not on the disc, only an English translation
is available :(

So this is at least fishy and I am a bit disappointed.

8194868,5,B000Q7ZB8S,"This DVD is excellent.  It gives clear information on the history and life of the Judo legend Mifune Sensei.  If you are interested in history, kata, technique this dvd has it all.  All the throws and reversals are presented along with chokes and kata...it is very neat to see the techniques in historical footage.  While this is not a instructional DVD there is many techniques that the intermediate to advanced Judoka can pick up while watching this DVD.  It is a prized possession in my DVD library. 5+ Stars!!",1203552000,6,513,4.719101123595506
