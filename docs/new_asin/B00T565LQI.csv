7000219,5,B00T565LQI,"great movie classic 80s grindhouse porn, BUT  this one actualy has a pretty decent plot(private eye flick), and a really big budget/nice sets for a porn(still, the movie's whole budget wouldnt cover the catering bill on a big hollywood blockbuster though...lol). but yeah, a really nice fun flick, i guess they would call this couples porn nowadays, cus of the plot/storyline, which is somewhat rarer nowadays. also included is the r rated netured  version titled it's called murder baby, but that one i did not watch, kinda like getting an uncut/uncencored horror film, and watching the r rated version instead...lol.",1451952000,8,618,5.17

7000221,5,B00T565LQI,"""Dixie Ray Hollywood Star"" ranks with a few other classic porn chic movies - Radley Metzger's films, 'Amanda By Night' & 'Roommates' comes to mind - that can compete with the mainstream in terms of acting and direction.  This is a noir tale full of plot twists and atmosphere, and the lead by John Leslie is perhaps the single best performance by a male actor I have ever seen in a porn movie.  There is included as a bonus an R rated version of the movie and it works very well as a noir thriller on its own, but the X rated version also has some great sexual heat from Juliet Anderson, Veronica Hart and the under-rated Lisa Deleeuw.  Add into the mix a non-sex role by veteran Cameron Mitchell and you have a REAL movie with some sex in it, in either the R or X rate version.
If you want to know what all the fuss was about back in the day when they shot American porn on film, this is the best movie to start with.  It simply does not get any better in terms of acting, scripting, or direction.",1430697600,29,998,4.155440414507772

8700322,5,B00T565LQI,"Le DVD est d'excellente qualit et le programme tout  fait exceptionnel dans le genre: Anthony Spinelli ralisateur estimable, sans pour autant tre toujours trs passionnant (tel 'Sex World'  la fois trs beau et vari mais peut tre aussi un peu ennuyeux sur la longueur), mais ici au Top tout comme John Leslie! (dj dans l'intressant 'Nothing to Hide' de l'anne prcdente, leur collaboration tait fructueuse); John Leslie dans ses meilleurs moments, plus tard, ralisera lui mme quelques trs bons opus (d'un moindre niveau) dans ce registre du 'polar luxueux'. Dans ce Dixie Ray Hollywood Star (dans une ambiance 'film noir' des annes quarante), le talent et la matrise culminent, et notre intrt soutenu  le visionner, de bout en bout, ne se dment jamais. Excellente vision!

[Ce DVD prsente une image de trs grande qualit, la sonorit tant parfaitement convenable; en supplment le film en version 'soft' qui aurait presque ma prfrence, tout  fait convaincante! (montage initial intrinsque)]",1468800000,,984,5.24203821656051
8700323,5,B00T565LQI,"This is a hard core film.  Similar to the Ginger-movie just reviewed, our private detective also uses his body (handsome man sand fit) as weapon to seduce women on his way to investigate murder cases. Explicit sex scenes are floating one after another.  Don't you care about those murder victims?  Doesn't he?  Take your time to enjoy this great movie.",1468800000,5,352,4.816666666666666
8700324,4,B00T565LQI,"What can you say about this movie?

Set in 1943, just at the fall of Guadalcanal, it has a real script, with actual actors for the non-bonking parts (Hello, Uncle Buck), and even those actors getting naked and nasty are not phoning it in when it comes to acting either (true, one or two needed a bit more work on the emoting) but hey, in this sort of territory it stands out as being so professionally done it could go mainstream.

The film is an anachronism. In the sixties this sort of movie was easily found in theaters. By the eighties you'd have to truck into the Red Light district of your local town to see this sort of content, with a cast far less accomplished and not really challenged to do more than have outstanding stamina and be double jointed.

Dixie Ray has been shot with seventies porn aesthetics too. All the riding is bareback, by people who were unaware of the deadly threat just around the corner that would sometimes go with this sort of thing. Lots of zooming in on Genitalia In Action. Lots of Oral Sex. Lots of inane dialogue during the act. Occasional slips with the Foley process when trying to recreate the sounds of Couples In Action. And everyone has matching collar and cuffs. The Age Of The Razor had yet to hit - Bill Maher would be thrilled.

It has to be said that by today's standards, everything that goes on is very vanilla. There is a girl-on-girl scene and a threesome, but they are not all they could be. I've seen sexier stuff going on in a Game of Thrones episode. Maybe my tastes are just too jaded.

I prefer to see the ladies in all their glory myself, and found the lengthy gynecological close-in close-ups a turn-off. YMMV.

The women are beautiful and sexy, and the WWII period wardrobe very erotic too. When the camera frames them properly they are a sight to behold.

The plot is dumb and more full of holes than a fishnet stocking. We aren't supposed to care of course. The scriptwriters did care enough to make the film a little unpredictable, but we are intended to be distracted and not notice the flubs.

The disc includes a trailer that is pretty much just the aforementioned close-ups strung together while someone reads reviews from Screw magazine and Hustler etc., and the R-rated cut of the same movie. I've not watched that version yet.

I thought the ""erotic"" scenes went on too long, were not varied enough and were poorly scripted - though that is of course A Trope. I actually fast-forwarded through one of the girl-on-knees oral sex bouts because enough was enough. YMMV.

Worth a look if you are a fan of hardcore X-rated action.",1467676800,6,2599,4.522388059701493
