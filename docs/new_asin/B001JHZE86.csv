8609466,2,B001JHZE86,"I was rather disappointed in this video for the price of it.  This is considered an advanced knifemaking video, in that it expects that you already have a blade made.  I was expecting to be able to see the blade being created as well as any inherent problems in creating a long blade.  This was more on how to create the clevis type tang as well as the guard and should have been advertised as such.  NOT worth the price.",1257292800,4,421,4.225
