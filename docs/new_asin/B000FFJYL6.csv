2562841,5,B000FFJYL6,"Ritovski's devastating study of a downtrodden youth in contemporary Macedonia offers no comfort for those seeking tidy endings and late-arriving omens of joy. Still, ""Mirage"" is powerful and riveting on its own terms, bitterly reflecting the realities of life for thousands in a war-torn, impoverished place, as the films of Rossellini and De Sica did half a century ago. Kovacevic's transformation from a sullen, helpless, sensitive boy into a veritable one-teen island of rage and reprisal is terrifying and authentic. This ""Mirage"" will definitely leave a lasting impression.",1185148800,,578,5.579545454545454
2562842,4,B000FFJYL6,"This movie for me was all about the killing of an innocent mind, Young Marko a boy who just needs to have a guide in life is let down by the self important adults in his life.

Marko has a talent that could have been used for the betterment of him, instead all he learns is that if you life in a sewer then you better act the part.

His teacher only seems to be concerned in what Marko can do for him and little of what he can do for Marko. This is also markedly obvious in how the authority figures that surround Marko have been trained to act like rats in the sewer.

Marko Kovacevic gives the performance of his short life.",1182816000,,626,4.032258064516129
2562843,4,B000FFJYL6,"Stunning. The cinematography is incandescent, the rhythm of the story pulsates, especially after the train scene. Simply magical to watch, gripping and eye fluttering images, and the camera catches every flinch and emotion along the way.

Kudos to Marko Kovacevic, what a remarkable performance. Visually he steals the show, and not since Christian Bale's performance as young Jim in 'Empire of the Sun', have we seen such an enormous role done with such sincerity and professionalism as Master Kovacevic. Although he barely has much to say the entire film, its the majestic unspoken thought in his eyes, the intrigue and despair we see through his face; that in of itself is magical. IMHO the best actors in the world, are the ones that listen and react to situations, rather than always speaking. Marko does this remarkably, if he were to not utter a single word for the whole film, we would still cringe and almost cry to see the boy go through the torment he went through just by watching his eyes alone. STUNNING!

A true, in your face work of pure cinematic genuise!",1178064000,5,1072,4.820652173913044
2562844,5,B000FFJYL6,This is not your usual Hollywood fare but if you are looking for quality East European cinema you can't go much wrong with this. Ultimately its about a kid  that is misled into the wrong life path and the ultimate conclusion is chilling to say the least. This is not entertaining; it is rather compelling and should be seen.,1172275200,7,324,4.491525423728813
2562845,4,B000FFJYL6,A beautiful treatment of a dark subject. Marko Kovacevic gives an amazing performance. This movie is everything I look for in a foriegn film - a real antidote to Hollywood fare.,1168300800,3,177,4.741935483870968
2562846,4,B000FFJYL6,"*Attention!!! Will be a spoiler or two in this review.*

Okay. This is a wonderful movie indeed. There is a great plot. The scenery and camera work are stunning. Cast is great, and main character is very beautiful and very well played. This is your, ""I am very smart and talented; and odds are completely against me"" type of main character. The dialog is life like, completely lacking any [forced upon] political correctness. Basically, the movie is about a boy who is extremely talented and kind, and has a great potential for becoming somebody. However, his messed up family, betrayal of a teacher and then newly found friend, and merciless beatings by local bullies, transformed this charming boy into an angry rebel who looses all the hope for the world and himself. During the movie you can't help yourself but to completely immerse in and fall in love with the main character. BUT! Why oh why did the movie has to end this way? I mean, the boy doesn't have to live happily ever after, but at least he could've gotten out with a thief. I mean what was the point of making a movie that ends this way; and he cut his hair. I was rather disappointed with where movie ended, which left me slightly heart broken; which is yet another evidence that the movie was very well done. What I am left with, is like I was just hit with a ton of bricks and I still hear the noise inside my head... This is one of those movies that I doubt I will watch again, for I can't go through the pain of the movie, with a ""hope""(!) that things will turn out for this kid and then be completely devastated in the end.",1163894400,6,1596,4.373737373737374
2562847,4,B000FFJYL6,"'You never get out of the sewer' is the sad summary toward the end of this remarkable film from Macedonia.  Director Svetozar Ristovski co-wrote this screenplay with Grace Lea Troje, a story of the struggle of youths in a country devastated with poverty and corruption - a place without hope.  The message is grim, the story is brutal, but the impact is stunning.

Marko (twelve-year old Marko Kovacevic in a brilliant debut) lives with his abusive, alcoholic father Lazo (Vlado Jovanovski) whose only work other than drinking is bingo games and who is in defiance of the American occupation of Macedonia; his mute  and terrified mother Angja (Elena Mosevska) who remains a pathetic victim of abuse; and his trashy, angry, abusive sister Fanny (Slavica Manaskova) - all of whom hate each other and fill their hovel along the railroad tracks with cruelty.  Marko happens to be a fine student who writes poetry and is encouraged by his Bosnian Professor (Mustafa Nadarevic) to write a poem for a competition that would reward him with a trip to Paris. Marko's schoolmates are disgusting thugs who beat him at every provocation: the Professor, fighting his own demons, does little to control his outrageous classroom.

Marko escapes his ugly household by finding a spot on a deserted train where he can be alone and it is here that the movie takes on magic. Marko 'creates' a friend named 'Paris' (Nikola Djuricko) who gives him hope that Marko can come with him as he leaves the little cruel village. Paris teaches him to defend himself and to support himself through stealing and shoplifting, all with the goal of escaping from Macedonia.  As Marko slips down the path of crime his teacher tries in vain to feed Marko's hope of writing his way to Paris, but when the gang of boys force Marko to the limit, Marko's new self challenges them, establishing his independence.  The two beacons of Hope for Marko (Professor and Paris) both fade and the ending of the film comes as a shocking surprise, yet one that mirrors Nietzsche's astute quotation.

This is a grim film to watch, overflowing with brutality of both the physical and the mental types, but the journey is worth it due to the overwhelmingly fine performance by Marko Kovacevic, a lad with the same degree of quiet facial expressiveness and acting skill as that of such greats as Giulietta Masina. The gritting, well-composed cinematography is by Vladimir Samoilovski and the haunting musical score is by Klaus Hundsbichler (with a little help from Eric Satie!).  This is one of those films that is disturbing in the best sense of the word: it makes us think beyond our safe borders and contemplate the plight of the oppressed, both children and adults, in a country torn by recurring violence. In Macedonian and Bosnian with English subtitles. Recommended.  Grady Harp, July 06",1153699200,53,2836,4.8875
2562848,5,B000FFJYL6,"Marko Kovacevic was incredible, adding innuendo to his character's part with the brightness or dullness of eyes, a slight change of facial expression, or merely a change of emotion.  Superb acting by this young actor.  The movie told the story of a young boy growing up in Macedonia, complete with his country's occupation by American soldiers, a dysfunctional family led by a drunken father, and living in fear of the local gang of boys who beat him up regularly.  Marko had a bright talent for writing poetry, and he could feel his creativeness grow and become a road out of his miserable life.  But as you watch this bright young mind attempt to crawl out of the everyday brutality of living, you can witness the extinguishing of that brightness as a cigarette being crushed out in an ashtray.  Beautiful boy, gripping drama, decently filmed, well worth watching.",1153440000,27,866,4.863945578231292

8121803,4,B000FFJYL6,"A moderately interesting drama set in Macedonia during a time of political turmoil. The movie moves along at a fairly good pace, with a fair amount of action. The plot has a lot of feeling, and is easy to follow. The acting is good, especially the acting from the young star playing the central character.
The central character is Marko who is about twelve years old. He is small but smart, he gets the best marks in school but beat up by the school bullies. Marko's family is dysfunctional, he is picked on by his sister while his parents do nothing. His father is out on strike, which is closely tied to the political turmoil, and spends his time drinking and playing Bingo. Neither parent seems to care what their children do, in or out of the house. When the parents cannot avoid interaction with their children they do so in a negative way, belittling them, yelling at them, putting them down, etc. Marko has no friends and no hope of an improved life away from the poverty and brutality he was born into.
That is, he has no hope until his teacher tells him of a French poetry competition for young talents which will allow Marko to go to Paris. But this hope is shaken when Marko learns that his teacher is also afraid of the school bullies, and his faith in the teacher continues to go downhill from there. Marko, now looking for hope, then turns to a drifter who is willing to teach him to be a thief, but soon Marko realizes that this drifter really does not care about him either. After being caught stealing he gets help from a policeman in a position of authority in the police department and the father of the school's biggest bully. Finally the school bullies say they want Marko to join them but just as he is getting into this idea they betray him, and the policeman also turns again him.
Marko has now tasted hope but feels betrayed by his family, his teacher, his drifter friend the school bullies and the policeman. He short, he feels betrayed by everybody. It is at this point he takes action based on his feelings of betrayal.",1399248000,,2047,4.461333333333333
8121804,4,B000FFJYL6,"I think most of the remarkable qualities of this film have been described by the other reviewers that gave it four stars. I would like to add a couple of things. The film is unrelentingly bleak, but halfway in, hope appears,held out like a bauble, the way a lot of people who hold to unrealistic hopes do to make their miserable lives more livable. In this case its the opportunity given the young hero to write a poem that will win a contest that takes him to Paris. This bauble is one of the most frustrating and brilliant devices in the film, because it plants in our minds the way American films operate. We know that in an American film he will win the contest and transform his life. Our growing fears are justified, because this film is not about dreams of hope, but the tragic reality of horrors. No one mentions that this film is highly political. It becomes a portrait of a country whose soul has been destroyed by the Balkan wars. The trucks of the NATO forces which move through the film cannot heal the terrible emotional effects the wars have on its citizens--the bitter homeless refugee ""Paris"" being a perfect example. The hatred and its fallout permeate the film. There are no voices of support--when Markos reaches out, everyone betrays him in their own way with neglect, ignorance, or bile. His beloved mentor the teacher is lost in a world of platitudes and patriotism, and can't grasp the real poetry of his best student. If you can bear it (and it takes some fortitude) you will be haunted by this fine film,and it drives home how much we have to feel fortunate about. It's another shining example (like the stunning THE TRAP)of Balkan film makers meeting the tragic events of their world head on,and transforming them into disturbing, powerful works of art.",1365811200,,1780,4.636075949367089
8121805,5,B000FFJYL6,"The Balkan States, after the fall of the Iron Curtain, were proclaimed in the Media as
the latest global area of emerging representative republics and democratic societies.
The reality was anarchy, failing societies with no welfare, no pensions, no rule of law,
fallen economy, rampant unemployment and local strongmen snatching up power which smacked of Anarchy.
Even with peace-keeping military forces in abundance, the raw use of power abounded in the local setting.
This is the real value of the DVD, ""Mirage"" as a masterpiece of illustrating in terms of daily
living through the eyes of a young boy named Marko how hope became just an actual mirage.
Reality for this boy - and many others remains futility with no jobs, poverty, no real
rule of law - no future! Good insight to what continues into the present as the Balkan
States struggle to enter into the rest of the European Community.",1365811200,,894,4.8881578947368425

If they are flawed or insincere, the repercussions can be devastating for the young minds and lives. This is an illustration of the responsibilies we have for nurturing our young folk with love and compassion, honesty and consistency. Weaknesses in us can only produce doubt and instability in them. In this film it seems to be amounting to tragedy for this young boy.",1362355200,,468,4.719512195121951
8121807,5,B000FFJYL6,"Mirage - im Original ""Iluzija"" erzhlt die Geschichte, oder besser gesagt das Schicksal eines 12-jhrigen mazedonischen Jungen, der einerseits eine hohe literarische Begabung besitzt, aber andererseits in einer absolut primitiven und dissozialen Familie aufwachsen muss; eine Familie, die ihm weder persnlich, noch intellektuell irgendwelche Zukunftsperspektiven bieten kann. Der Zuschauer wird in diesem Film mit einer absolut realistischen und erschtternden gesellschaftlichen Wahrheit konfrontiert, die nicht nur in Mazedonien existiert, sondern auch in jedem anderen Land auf dieser Welt, vor allem in Deutschland.

Das darin behandelte sozialpdagogisch-alltgliche Tabuthema, nmlich, dass es tatschlich derartig vergiftete Familien und gesellschaftliche Strukturen gibt, verbunden mit der bitteren Wahrheit, dass ein junges und unschuldiges Kind ganz langsam aber systematisch an diesen Gegebenheiten zugrunde geht, wird dem Zuschauer von Beginn an in erschtternder Detailgenauigkeit vor Augen gefhrt.

Dieser Film tut weh, er tut sogar sehr weh, und er versetzt mich regelmig aufgrund seiner Authentizitt direkt in meinen sozialpdagogischen Alltag hinein, wo ich mich auch sehr hufig damit konfrontiert sehe, dass ich einem Kind aufgrund gesellschaftlich vergifteter und verlogener Strukturen, sowie brokratischen, gesetzlichen und konzeptionellen Vorgaben und Vorschriften, NICHT helfen kann, oder hilflos mit ansehen muss, wie Kinder an einer solchen Situation zugrunde gehen.

Vor 15 Jahren bin ich Sozialpdagoge geworden, um Kindern und Jugendlichen zu helfen. Heute muss ich allerdings zugeben, dass dieses Helfenwollen nur noch eine reine Illusion ist.

So ist es fr mich als Sozialpdagoge, der schon seit 15 Jahren mehr oder midner vergeblich versucht auf diese Problematik aufmerksam zu machen, oder etwas an dieser Struktur positiv zu verndern, auch absolut nicht verwunderlich, dass dieser hervorragende und lehrreiche Film nicht auf Deutsch nachsynchronisiert wurde, denn diese grausame Wahrheit, die in - Mirage - gezeigt wird, wollen die Deutschen weder sehen, noch wirklich wahr haben. Hier in Deutschland gibt es so etwas nicht. Bei uns ist das noch nicht schlimm"". Das hre ich verantwortliche Politiker immer wieder sagen. Aber das Wegschauen und Ignorieren beginnt auch hier schon auf der kommunalen Ebene. Schwerwiegende Probleme werden oftmals ganz klassisch, relativiert, schngeredet oder entschrft, was zur Folge hat, dass das Geschrei immer dann erst richtig groe ist, wenn etwas ganz schreckliches passierte.

Aber ist dieses Verhalten fair gegenber einem unschuldigen Kind? Ist ein solches Verhalten moralisch richtig oder vertretbar? Darf man wirklich tatenlos zusehen wie ein wundervolles Kind an einer solchen Situation innerlich zerbricht?

Auch in Deutschland gibt es Hunderttausende Kinder, die in einer derartigen oder hnlichen Familie gro werden mssen, wie der 12-jhrige Marco. Auch in Deutschland haben wir an den Schulen das Problem, dass einzelne Kinder von anderen Kindern (Gruppen) gemobbt, ausgegrenzt, geschnitten, diskreditiert und gedemtigt werden, und auch in Deutschland haben wir an den Schulen sehr groe Schwierigkeiten im Gewaltbereich. Und was machen wir dagegen? Richtig! Wir zensieren die Wahrheit, und suchen die Schuld bei den bsen Gewalt- und Horrorfilmen bzw. Spielen, die im Gegensatz zu - Mirage - in Hlle und Flle erhltlich sind.

Lgen wir uns also weiter in die Tasche, und lassen wir weiter zu, dass gut 15% unserer Kinder von erziehungsresistenten Eltern zugrund gerichtet, oder zu Strafttern erzogen werden. Fhren wir weiter hrtere Strafen fr Kinder und Jugendliche ein, anstatt das einzig richtige zu tun, nmlich das Kinderschutzgesetz weltweit zu verschrfen, um unsere Kinder vor derartig erziehungsunfhigen Eltern bzw. den morbiden gesellschaftlichen Strukturen ihres sozialen Umfeldes zu schtzen.

Der einzige Wunsch Marcos, war mit seinem groen Talent aus der Scheie"" rauszukommen. Doch am Ende bleibt auch dieser Traum, wie fr viele andere Kinder auch, nur eine Illusion.",1306022400,,4040,6.026132404181185

8121811,5,B000FFJYL6,"Ten very nice reviews have already been posted as I write and they give you a good idea of what you will see in this powerful film.  What can I add? Historical comments.

The film starts out by setting up an historical context for itself. The hated and corrupt communists have fallen. But what is left? Then we are shown the film maker's perspective on what is left. A sort of hopeless semi-anarchy and plenty of corruption. Life is messed up and short in Macedonia. Rather hopeless and no way out. Very nice photography indeed helps keep the dismal town very interesting visually, however messed up everything is.

This film could serve to remind us that the west did very little to help hold post-communist society together after having worked for decades to defeat the Red Menace. American soldiers flit through a couple of times for reasons that are unclear, but that would be irrelevant because they do not have any impact on the day to day state of life. If they are tokens of the promise of help, it is an empty promise.

The theory in Washington was that investors would move in and establish a free-market bonanza using cheap relatively well educated labor. So no ambitious government plan to follow through with the defeat was deemed necessary. No sort of Marshall Plan for example. Again, empty promises.

Then the world largely turned its attention away from those millions of people and left them to fend for themselves and deal with their poverty, crowding, ethic grudges, disfunctional families and so on.

This film in a way says ""your attention may be on the anorexic problems of the latest drugged out starlet, but hey! we are over here with even bigger  problems. Do you want to know or would you rather not?""

The allies almost left Germany in a shambles after its defeat in WWII. Film buffs may remember Rossellini's Germany Year Zero. That film also focuses on desperate kids trying to get by in a different sort of post-war rubble. It ends by bluntly asking, do we want to leave things this way? Well we did not in that case. Anyway, I think this film in a political/historical sense might be compared to Year Zero.

If one assumes that the title Mirage has a message in it, that message could possibly be that Americans for example look across the Atlantic and see just the good stuff here and there that suggest (extremely limited) success of western investments. But these highly selected examples create at best largely an illusion of freedom and liberation. In fact the closer you get the more it looks like a desert where no lush fields are springing up.

Then we have mirages at the more personal level. The school and teacher, like the western powers in the cold war, raise hopeless expectations of personal possibilities and national possibilities -- but they are watching out for themselves. The boy is betrayed by mirages and false promises. He dreams faithfully, but only to have his dreams crushed.

Mirage presents strong, compelling, and compassionate images to help us remember ""the forgotten ones."" That is art with muscle.",1204588800,3,3063,4.771266540642722

Synopsis: Marko is a sensitive and intelligent young adolescent whose exemplary grades and writing talent goes unnoticed by his dysfunctional, abusive family. His talents unfortunately do not go unnoticed by the school bullies who taunt poor Marko, beating him up on almost a daily basis. Looking for a way out in hopes to find a better life he is encouraged by his teacher to enter a poetry contest, the winner getting a free trip to Paris to compete internationally. When an already abusive lifestyle escalates for the worse the aspiring poet is swept up in a maelstrom that demands more than a talent for composition.

Critique: Released in '04 director Svetozar Ristovski's `Mirage' is a sad commentary on the hopelessness and violence in Macedonia. Unfortunate but too often true, intelligence and depth is no match for rampant and widespread brutality and ignorance. To survive one must become that which he hates most.

Positives: Marko Kovacevic is superb as the shy and abused Marko. Possessing a face too attractive and expressive to belong to a boy, he bears a striking resemblance to the late American actor River Phoenix.

Worth watching, but be forewarned, this isn't `The Sound of Music'. My Rating: -4 Stars-.",1187827200,15,1267,5.106280193236715
