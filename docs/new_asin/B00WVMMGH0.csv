7154916,5,B00WVMMGH0,"An incredible story of bad things happening to good people who make wrong choices. And just when you think you have everything figured out and this great film is about to end, the filmmakers thrown in a major ""curve"" and you are left trying to decide what REALLY happened to Toni Jo and whether or not she is guilty of the crimes with which she was charged. Chances are good that you will never take your eyes off the screen during ""The Pardon.""

Even better, an extra FIVE STARS for having almost NO TOBACCO DRUG USE (HURRAY!) in this film, even though it was taking place in a time where tobacco drug use was unfortunately more prevalent than today. ALL MOVIES SHOULD BE TOBACCO FREE!",1438128000,2,686,4.488

7154923,5,B00WVMMGH0,This movie meant a lot to me because the trial was held in the town I grew up in. And I remember the name Toni Jo Henry as a teenager. Of course this incident took place 8 years before I was born. I remember one of the local race horse owners even named one of his horses Toni Jo. I like court room dramas that are based on real life occurrences and this movie was portrayed accurately.,1480982400,3,386,4.025974025974026

7154976,1,B00WVMMGH0,"*SPOILER ALERT*

In an effort to  to be fair, I agonized through this to the bitter end. The Pardon is about an unbelieving former prostitute convicted of capital murder who finds Jesus. Here's an example of the plot. Toni Jo, the murderess, and the Catholic priest who befriends her, are sitting in her cell. He reads her the story from John 8: 1-11 about the prostitute dragged before Jesus that Jesus refuses to condemn.  This is her come to Jesus moment. She tells the priest it's time for her ""to be dunked"". The priest tells her  ""we don't dunk, we sprinkle"". She is let out of her cell to be baptized. She has a tearful scene, where it's obvious that she's now a believer. In a final scene, Toni Jo is shrieking bc the DOC must cut off her hair for her to go to the electric chair. The priest tells her, ""Toni Jo, you are more than your hair..."" She wants to know if she can have her hair back after they cut it off. The priest tells her, ""Of course, what would an angel be without her hair?""  The musical background is drippy, complete with violins. (I'm SERIOUS). An extremely predictable and exploitative dialogue.

If evangelism turns you off, don't put this on!",1450310400,5,1173,4.432558139534883
