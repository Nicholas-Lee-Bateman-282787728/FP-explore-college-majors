1400605,5,B000056VPL,"Though Portugal being a colonial country untill the coup d'tat in 1974, very little of the african culture was available to the commmon Portuguese. The Gumboots are a strong doccument with an important impact, knowing that among the black workers on the gold mines, were many citizens of Mozambique. It is music, dance, traditions and History.",1123027200,,343,5.142857142857143
1400606,4,B000056VPL,I like the fact that there was the background story with the performance. Great. Educational and entertaining at the same time.,1123027200,,127,5.095238095238095
1400607,5,B000056VPL,"I bought this DVD sometime ago, but forgot about it until I discovered it just sitting there among my DVD collection. I watched it and bwoy! was I taken away or what? Being originally from Southern Africa brought back many memories as we used to grow up listening and mimicking Gumboot dancing. This is a must-see DVD and the dancing, choreography and music has been excently put together to bring this explosion of energy and power! Makes you feel like you are actually there....",1046217600,3,480,4.726190476190476
1400608,1,B000056VPL,"I bought this vidoe out of curiosity, and needless to say it wasn't what I expected. I purchased the video based on the reviews that I read. I guess what is considered good to some people might not be considered good to the next.
  If you are a college student or a former college student and you like stomp copetitions or greek shows, then this video might be the video for you. That's basically what it is, stomp dancing.
  The singing and dancing to me was really boring, but that is just my opinion.
  The best part about the tape is the commontary at the end, when dancers are interviewed, and they tell thier life story and how they got involved in stomp dancing....It's really interesting how they explain how stomping was developed in the gold mines in Africa as a way of communicating. Miners wasn't allowed to talk, so stomping patterns was developed as a way of talking. Rubber boots stomping in water. And some of the old footage of stomping in the video is pretty good too.
  Well, I voiced my opinion of what I think about the tape, now it's up to the buyer to decide if he or she wants to purchase the tape or DVD.",1022976000,9,1129,4.3428571428571425
1400609,5,B000056VPL,"DVDs range in quality (not of the material on the DVD, but the quality of the DVD itself) from a low of Kurosawa's wonderful movie Ran, with its' unwatchable color smears and ghosting,  to this DVD which has the sharpest images and best production values I've ever seen.  The extra material on the DVD is wonderful and the Gumboots show itself are awesome.  Think a South African Stomp.  If you love dance and harmonizing music, you really owe it to yourself to check this out.",996537600,10,477,4.576470588235294
1400610,5,B000056VPL,"Words simply cannot describe what is contained on this DVD!  We bought the VHS version and played it every night for a week and just ordered the DVD tonight.  If you have ever seen a Black Greek stepshow, this is like the championship level with gospel harmonies mixed in.  It is awesome!  A must see, over and over and over.....",989366400,3,329,4.433333333333334
1400611,5,B000056VPL,"I just saw Gumboots live last night.  It was fantastic.  What Riverdance is to Ireland, Gumboots is to South Africa.  If you enjoy dancing and singing you will enjoy this DVD.  There is even a little light humor.  Very energetic.",985478400,2,229,4.625

7932722,5,B000056VPL,"I stumbled upon this performance years ago. And I enjoyed watching it several times.
Recently I realized my copy was damaged. So I was a customer again for this great show.
This show is based on the singing and dancing that had been done by South African gold miners.
It's been refined and shared with the world. And this version is fantastic. The men that do this
are very very talented. And many of them how prominent parts have loads of personality and
are very talented. The music reaches your soul. Their singing is great. And their dancing is fun
to watch.
I highly recommend this to anyone who likes music videos.",1497571200,,620,4.544642857142857
7932723,5,B000056VPL,"Although a few years ago now, this was a fabulous show showering the audience with song, dance and uplifting demonstrations of rhythmic and harmonic interpretations from this talented troupe.  It took me a long time to find this DVD and am over the moon to finally have it. Thank you for the supply.  ENJOY DANCE?? Get this DVD.",1463443200,,328,4.637931034482759
7932724,5,B000056VPL,An excellent introduction to traditional South African dance.  The film takes you to the history of the gumboots then to a live performance in London.. Highly recommended.,1443312000,,171,5.333333333333333

7932728,5,B000056VPL,"Gumboot dance and story exponentially showcase the rich African cultural heritage.
Evidently, Gumboot is the story of  evolution of South Africa through nation building.",1375228800,,169,6.041666666666667
7932729,1,B000056VPL,"Amazon are aware of this and have fully refunded my money.  I am absolutely disgusted that this is being sold as an original DVD.  It obviously does not contain the additional material as advertised, and which is crucial to the disc.  The case is flimsy and the insert very poorly photocopied.  I HAVE the original already and wanted a second one.  I would never copy a DVD.  What REALLY hurts is that I know these musicians personally.  They live in a third world country, are now too old to perform, and the meagre amount that the make from sales of this item are crucial to them.  I am hoping that Amazon are no longer allowing this illegal company to operate on their website.  Absolutely disgusted.",1372809600,,703,4.56
