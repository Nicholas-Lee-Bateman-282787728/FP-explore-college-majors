4934073,4,B0062VL4GA,"The Silly Song is an essential part of VeggieTales. Expect one in every story.

What is a Silly Song? It is an uncommon innocence and goofiness in song. If there is a shortage of humor in music, the Silly Song is the exception. Children, and even adults, enjoy the craziness. Grownups appreciate the subtleties; kids the simplicity.

To celebrate this legacy of unrestrained fun, VeggieTales has released If I Sang a Silly Song ... (DVD). This is a collection of fan-favorite Silly Songs from the first two decades plus the new song, ""Bubble Rap.""

The theme for the latter was chosen from thousands of viewer submissions. The volume of ideas shows that the making of Silly Songs is no laughing matter.

A dapper-looking Larry the Cucumber hosts this countdown of songs in a TV studio, call-in environment. Volunteer vegetables take the calls. As for appearance, I can give Larry and friends no finer compliment than to say they have not aged in twenty years.

Larry is not one to be at a loss for words, but don't expect song introductions. Brief telethon interludes separate the songs.

If it is not enough just to see and hear these catchy tunes, you can switch to a sing-a-long setting, which may lead others to question your sanity when they hear you singing songs like ""His Cheeseburger."" The menu allows for easy navigation to the track of your choice. A behind the scenes look at recent and upcoming releases is included as a bonus feature.

The look of VeggieTales is outstanding; the graphics and bright colors are a delight. Facial expressions, subtle humor, clever arrangements, and witty lyrics combine to make Silly Songs fun and entertaining. One drawback of isolating the songs from the stories is the loss of the spiritual values, communicated by the latter. I wonder if future songs could have more substance without detracting from their playfulness.

Regardless, this collection represents the remarkable body of work found in the many VeggieTales' releases. New titles are now being released in the Blu-ray format, which will further enhance visuals and sound.",1331078400,,2081,4.959770114942529
4934074,3,B0062VL4GA,I was hoping for a cute story that would tie the music together -- it's a radiothon -- the songs are great -- I thought VeggieTales Live was MUCH better,1330905600,,152,4.1

4934079,5,B0062VL4GA,"It had been a while since VeggieTales released a compilation of their silly songs.  But thats just what theyve done with If I Sang A Silly Song.  It collects what are considered the best silly songs as voted on by fans.  While there are many classics here, obviously my tastes don't agree with the vast majority of fans.

The plot, and I use the term loosely, involves a telethon were people are voting in with suggestions for a brand new silly song.  While we wait for the results to be tallied, we are treated to the top 10 silly songs of the last decade.  Basically, they play back to back with a brief stop to check in with the phone banks about half way through.  We get such fun songs as Pants, Goodnight, Junior, Monkey, and The Biscuit of Zazzamarandabo.  And this is where my bias comes into play the most.  Im not a fan of Sport Utility Vehicle or Gated Community, both of which make the list.  I can think of two or three that should have replaced them.  On the other hand, we do get the very funny Sippy Cup.

But when those initial 10 songs have played, the votes aren't all in yet, so they run the top ten silly songs from the first decade.  There were fewer videos back then, so these are most of the songs we all know and love.  And they are true classics.  Weve got songs like The Hairbrush Song, His Cheeseburger, The Song of the Cebu, and the very first silly song ever, The Water Buffalo Song.  There are really only two songs from that first decade I don't care for, and one of them is missing.  The other makes it way too high up the list, but its not number one.  And speaking of which, the results this time are different from the initial time they let the fans rate the silly songs  10 years ago.

Finally, all the calls have been totaled and tallied and we get a new silly song.  The subject?  Well, Ill leave that for you to discover.  They really did have a fan poll on the internet to create this silly song, and its fun.  Id actually heard some people reference it recently, so I was glad to be able to see it.

Most fans already have the majority of these songs in their collection from their initial DVD releases.  Still, for kids who love the music, its nice to have a place to just pop it in and see all the songs with very little else.  The video is 72 minutes long, and its mostly the songs.

Unlike other VeggieTales entries, this one doesnt have a message or a moral.  Its just silliness for silliness sake.

And they are plain fun.  I stuck this in to watch while my roommate was home.  He wound up watching all of them with me even though he intended to go do some stuff in the other room.  Thats just how much fun they are for adults.  Kids, the intended audience, love them just as much.

But watching songs done over 20 years makes one thing very obvious - man have computer graphics changed.  The modern songs look good and sharp.  Its not quite Pixar quality, but its still very good.  However, when you get to the older songs, the rough edges and the jerky movement becomes very obvious  more obvious since they are side by side.  But considering that animation was done 20 years ago, its pretty understandable why they look that way, and kids won't really notice.  Theyll be having too much fun.

And I will give the voice cast credit.  They can sing without breaking character.  In fact, at times their singing adds to the fun of the song.

So if you want a collection of silliness, be sure to check out If I Sang A Silly Song.  The silliness is infection, and thats all of the fun.",1429228800,,3530,4.256410256410256
