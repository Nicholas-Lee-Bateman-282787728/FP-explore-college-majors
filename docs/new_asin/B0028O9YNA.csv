8356444,4,B0028O9YNA,"The Wilby Conspiracy is a 1974 movie set in Aparthied South Africa. Anti - Aparthied activist Shack Twala ( Poitier ) is released from Prison by Keogh's ( Caine) Girlfriend Lawyer. Soon after Twala and Keogh get into trouble by the Police and they have no other option but go on the run from the Authorities. They must travel from Cape Town to Johannesburg and eventually out of the country while trying to keep one step ahead from the South African Police. The movie gives you a clear insight of what life was like for Black and "" Coloured"" people in South Africa during the Aparthied era. It is a very good movie with great actors and it is well worth viewing. Both Michael Caine and Sidney Poiter stared in the movie Mandela and DeKlerk - another must see!.",1346198400,,760,4.474820143884892
