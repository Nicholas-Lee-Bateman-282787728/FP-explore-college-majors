8182202,5,6305760969,"chick corea has been around a long time. since the early 70's avante garde group 'circle' where he was leader to the 80's jazz fusion as leader for super group 'return to forever' writing and producing monster creations such as lp release 'no mystery': man, what record that was... bursting with creative energy and ideas... chick corea is such a prolific artist: his piano is bright, alive and explorative. they say that is true of bud powell, also; fast, bright and prolific with the right hand.
this is a tribute group and performance tribute to the late great pianist bud powell. powell was one of the most original and creative pianist of the bebop era. highly respected and well liked by his peers, his song 'un poco loco' the last song performed on this dvd release, has been singled out by critics and cultural historians for its' musical and cultural significance.
first half: is in japan, summer '96; at the parthenon tama. i will give you some highlights.
great opening arrangement with corea starting out on acoustic piano; enters the trumpet of wallace roney blending and in unison with the alto saxophone of kenny garrett; both players reading from a chart by corea; with christian mcbride at bass and the recipient of a grammy lifetime achievement award {2010} by the national academy of recording arts and sciences the great roy haynes on drums. piano soloing follows and splendid it is by corea with driving accompaniment by haynes. roney follows with rapid and beautiful flowing trumpet. kenny garrett jumps in after roney finishes with rapid alto... a very exciting solo. following the alto solo is christian mcbride performing a very melodic solo on stand up bass. the audience loves it and rightfully so. last but not least, haynes snaps, crackles {hayne's trademark} his way through a fulfilling listening drum solo... entertaining the audience with ever changing yet smooth drumming. the piece finishes with the blending of those two magnificent horns; always a treat hearing a trumpet and alto together in unison.
this concert continues... gets better and better with what i must say are some magnificent piano soloing by corea. there is wonderful vocal performed by fred johnson  on the bop classic song; titled 'bud powell' or some will remember it as 'in walked bud' followed by an alto sax solo and a trumpet solo... [makes perfect sense; tribute piece to bud powell, charlie parker, dizzy gillespie: bebop giants]... very nice this concert performance.
second half: is in munich klaviersommer '96; at the munich philharmonie. i will give you some highlights.
opening chart; 'oblivion': on trumpet wallace roney trading rapid fire solos with joshua redman who is on alto... the two instruments eventually merge and both players are on fire... redman's fiery alto reminds me of james spaulding on those blue note recording of the 60's, such as wayne shorter's 'schizophrenia', for example... that quality.
song two; 'i'll keep loving you': features joshua redman: redman really stretches out on tenor. he's really great on both upper and lower range: very melodic too. strong piece.
song three and final; 'un loco poco': this is high art performance as roney and redman tap into their inner souls performing beautiful solos on trumpet and soprano; respectively. a long solo by haynes follows... a killer drum solo in fact... and quite lengthy it is. the performances on this song are just great. redman plays both tenor and soprano during this one and roney's trumpet playing is just beautiful.
this is american jazz improvisational music... with strong well written charts... performed at it's very best... by master musicians... who obviously love and admire bud powell... .. amen to that.  mz",1364515200,,3722,5.0602605863192185
8182203,5,6305760969,"This is the first time I saw Chick Corea playing live when I purchased the DVD. The project is a tribute to one of Chick Corea's heroes, Bud Powell. This album is a good introduction to Bud Powell's composition if you never heard him before.

Featuring young jazz musicians (except Chick himself and the drummer, Roy Haynes) such as Wallace Roney (who sounds like Miles Davis), Joshua Redman, Kenny Garrett (the real Kenny G).

I'm amazed to see Roy Haynes can play drums like that, he's more than 70 years old!! Watch when he and Chick trading solos!",1105315200,2,551,4.612244897959184
8182204,5,6305760969,"This is an essential to all Jazz Collectors. It is one thing to  listen to a CD, but to see Chick Corea, Kenny Garrett, and Joshua Redman perform is truly an experience. The skills of these men are truly shown in this performance. From Kenny's long winded solos to Joshua's smooth transitions, this is a jazz lovers feast.",970531200,14,322,4.551724137931035
8182205,4,6305760969,"I was kind of new to Chick Corea. After seeing this dvd, I easily became a fan of his. I don't  know what kind of jazz he is playing. Free jazz? Or cool jazz? I hope someone can tell me. The important thing is that I could  really feel ""free"" when I saw/heard him playing. Particularly, I  did enjoy ""Bud Powell"" accompanied(?) by vocal and  ""Oblivion"" which features a conversation between drums and  piano.
This dvd contains two concerts performed in Japan and Germany in  1996. The former was shot in full screen format and the latter in  widescreen letterbox(1.85:1). The technical quality is good. The sound(PCM  stereo) is a bit weak but clean and clear.",957830400,15,660,4.629310344827586
