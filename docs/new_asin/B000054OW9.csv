1393256,5,B000054OW9,"My 6-year old still loves to watch Little Bear.  She owns a book treasury of all the original Minarik/Sendak stories and a Little Bear Preschool computer game.  I am glad this DVD is being offered, and intend to purchase it for my Daughter.  I like the Little Bear episodes shown on TV because they are gentle and slow-paced, but still very imaginative and full of fun.  They offer a Magical view of childhood and teach lessons about friendship and family.  Some other children's shows are too fast-paced and chopped into lots of short segments.  I feel this encourages a short attention span and overstimulates children.  This is an excellent purchase and would make an appropriate gift for any 2 to 6-year old.",1110326400,16,712,4.786885245901639

1393272,5,B000054OW9,"This came at a great price! I can stream this from Prime, but like having a hard copy for when our internet is giving us issues or to send to the babysitter. My 21 month old LOVES Little Bear. Nothing captures his attention quite like this program. I love how kind and gentle the story line and characters are. The music is beautiful and enjoyable - not just for him but for the parents. We do limit his television intake. This is a nice option because the episodes are only 7 minutes in length. If he is not feeling well, we can easily let the whole DVD just play out. You really don't get a lot of episodes which is why I've only purchased a couple of the DVDs. It's sometimes more affordable to purchase the streaming version of an entire season. Do remember that to access the additional episodes, you have to continue to click through more to find them. Those do not play in succession. You have to choose them individually. Not a big issue, but annoying if you're driving and the only one who can control the DVD player.",1400716800,2,1026,4.348958333333333

The Little Bear movies we've seen so far have been the most pure that I've found so far.  Little Bear and his friends talk nicely to each other and encourage creative play.  Thankfully, my 4.5-year-old really enjoys them.  He comes home from pre-school talking about power rangers and bad guys and joker man and Mr. Freeze(which he's never seen....how do these 4/5-year-old boys know about such stuff such that they model this play on the playground?), yet he loves to watch Little Bear.

My three-year-old loves the short clips, i think they must be about 7 mins long [each segment]. I think this is a value buy for the number of episodes you get.",1210982400,4,683,4.636363636363637

These videos are nonviolent, reasonably engaging and intelligent, and they generally teach good values and problem solving.  It's not great art, but it is entertaining and won't insult your child's intelligence.  Based on a series of books written by Else Homelund Minarik in the 1960s, this is good family fare -- you can park your kid in front of these films and not have to worry about disturbing or inappropriate content.

1393323,5,B000054OW9,"I suspect that most parents of young children in North America are well aware of Little Bear from Noggin or Nick Jr.  Based on the book series of the same name published in the 1950s-60s and illustrated by Maurice Sendak (most famous for ""Where the Wild Things Are""), this program is outstanding for preschool-aged children for a number of reasons.

1) First off, each story is only 7 1/2 minutes long + a 1-minute intro.  This is ideal for the short attention spans of the target audience.

2) Secondly, the pacing and tone are fun, but very mellow.  The music is soothing, the mood is very happy throughout, and the end result is a calm, peaceful viewer.

3) The stories specifically target the development stage of the preschool age group.  No matter what the plot, the stories always capture the sense of curiosity and adventure of that age.  Little Bear lets his imagination soar, plays make believe, and dreams wonderful dreams.  The writers nail the curiosity, exploration, and discovery that are so wonderful in pre-schoolers.

4) Each story also demonstrates the value of family and friendship.  Little Bear's parents interact with him in a meaningful, playful way on his level.  And his friends are true friends, sharing many of their adventures together, solving problems together, and evincing real empathy for one another.

Regarding this specific DVD, as the title suggests, the four main stories focus on the various symptoms and experiences of common childhood illnesses (colds, flu, mumps, frog in the throat).  Family and friends help ease Little Bear's loneliness and the result is a lot of fun.  But the disk also includes 8 ""Bonus"" stories about various other topics.

If you select the ""Play All"" option on the DVD, you will see the 4 main stories (about 34 minutes), but you'll miss out on two-thirds of the total material on this disk.  To access the other 8 stories, choose the ""Episode Selection"" option, scroll past the two pages with the main stories, and then select Bonus Episodes to see a list.

I do not know why Nelvana chose to bury the other 8 episodes this way.  Maybe I should just chalk that up to my own laziness for always selecting Play All and not discovering the others for several months.  Ah well, my boys have forgiven me.  Hopefully, I can not help others to avoid the same mistake.

Enjoy the DVD.  The stories are wholesome enough that you can put them on and let the children watch on their own for a few minutes if you need a break, but they're also fun to watch together.  The show demonstrates and, thus, encourages healthy interaction between parents and their preschoolers.

Each story is loaded with laughs and lessons for Little Bear and our little viewers.",1163462400,30,2714,4.78494623655914

A little annoying for mom, but all in all, we are very happy with this DVD.

The character is calm and sweet with no musical interludes and no high energy characters in like most children shows.  My toddler really likes this whole series and we were happy to find this dvd.

7930837,5,B000054OW9,"We love little bear! But all the more I love this set of stories because in them Little Bear is sick and you get a chance to see a more normal view of sickness and healing in families. Instead of the current kids programs loaded with vaccine propaganda and other such nonsense. Runny nose? Go to the doctor. Let's get our shots now.  No stay home and rest and heal and eat good nourishing food. Stay out of the sweets. Stay home. It's simple. No. Today people freak out over benign illnesses like chicken pox, measles and mumps which are actually meant to build up our immune system and train our immune system to heal us for worse events. Nope we rather freak out over nothing and whine about a few days home with our kids and inject them with toxic garbage than to do like all previous generations did and nourish the child and let them rest. Nope. Can't miss soccer practice we just need antibiotics and off we go. Who cares if the kid suffers in the long run. Kill your natural flora, risk abx resistance, train kids to take pills instead of nourishing themselves and using healing remedies instead of simply suppressing symptoms.

This is of an age passed for most sadly but it is great to show my kids NORMAL sick care like we do in our own home. From a compassionate and gentle family. That illnesses is not anything to fear and no need to run off to a doctor for every little sniffle and cough.",1453075200,6,1402,4.367816091954023
