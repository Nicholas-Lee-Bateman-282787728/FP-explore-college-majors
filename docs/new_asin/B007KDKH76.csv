With an intimate view into Becca's relationship with her body, we are privy to how she approves of her body and how she follows the natural rhythms of her body's desires in pleasuring herself. Using multiples senses over her whole body and enjoying the full build and descent of her orgasm, she savors it all! I was inspired as Becca explained how masturbation is an enjoyable part of self-care.",1337212800,5,429,4.733333333333333
5093789,5,B007KDKH76,"I wish all our leaders would watch this video. I started with myself, then my husband, then gifts for my girlfriends, then gifts for my guy friends because I do think thinking and feeling this way will be good for our world.

Watching Rebecca in ""A Guide to your Orgasm"" caused a paradigm shift. Not a flash in the pants and then the insight was gone, really a new way of living life, a new door to opening to happiness. The first time through I just watched and did not touch myself. Still I could feel her orgasm though my whole body. I felt light headed, my legs felt heavy and my genitals were throbbing.  I was witnessing a real woman's real pleasure. Yes it turned me on but more importantly I felt validated in my own power. I felt increased permission to feel good, feel pleasure, feel generous, feel happy, and feel safe. I was moved at how she loved and approved of herself while she explored herself in the mirror. She had no apology in enjoying the birthright of her body. I felt like I didn't have to apologize for the pleasure I felt watching her. I meditate and I saw similarities in how present she was. She was fully in the moment.

I do have a goal of having my husband getting me off better than I can get myself off but it started with being responsible for my own orgasm.  Once I chose to really take the time to give to myself, my relationships changed and my life has re-organized around having a good happy life where before I was in a rut of having hard-times drama around. I am grateful to the work the researchers have done that has given me permission to take my own life in my own hands and feel good. The people I come into contact with are grateful too, even if they don't know the source- they comment on my transformation.

I recommend giving yourself the gift of watching this and then trying it out for yourself. The moment I ordered my first DVD was a moment of action towards having all that I want in life. Now. Then watching it opened space for me to be a whole woman. I feel complete in a way I didn't feel before. I feel centered and present in my body. Good thing right- cause I do live here. I feel I took me back. All of me. Wow. Thanks.",1336694400,18,2181,4.220623501199041
5093790,5,B007KDKH76,"I found very enjoyable to watch all the stages of Rebecca's orgasm, from seeing her get turned on by looking at herself in the mirror to doing herself. It was nice that you could see the part where she visually went over her body in front of the mirror and how that made a difference. I could feel what she meant by enjoying the way she looks and being turned-on, and how that affects other people.
Her orgasm can be felt throughout the film and it was especially exceptional when she took herself over several times and to see how she could be relaxed and do what she wanted and be as vocal as she wanted.
The dialogue were very helpful during the orgasm to get reality on what she was doing and feeling, and it was perfectly timed.  It felt like every time I wanted to know something she would tell me.  Feeling the orgasm she produced in herself made me want to produce a better orgasm in my partner and gave me the tools and techniques to do it. Thank you",1335916800,21,959,4.2349726775956285

8519062,5,B007KDKH76,"Can you even imagine a professional cameraman handling the content of this kind of real film? I really love this video, the latest Female Masturbation video that the Welcomed Consensus released. The climax at the end is a lovely crest; she brings you on the entire experience with her, and you can feel the anticipation of going over the edge as she gets closer and closer to actually doing it. I have purchased several of the female masturbation videos from Welcomed Consensus and find them informative, entertaining, and of high picture quality. I hope they produce more of these.",1450137600,,582,4.888888888888889

8519066,1,B007KDKH76,"I am learning about tantric sex and when I read the description, for some reason in how it read, I thought it was along those lines guiding how to do this for a single person.  It was NOTHING like the description it was basically filming a woman masturbating for however long it was, which I already know how to do this just fine thank you.

I wouldn't recommend this for someone researching a higher level of love making...be-it with another or with one self.",1400284800,2,460,4.464285714285714

8519068,3,B007KDKH76,It seems to have helped her with her inhibitions. My wife did not say anything as she watched the dvd but she did not make fun of it either. She seemed to actually be interested in the video.,1387065600,,191,4.052631578947368
8519069,5,B007KDKH76,"The romantic, seductive guitar strains of Daniel Estram's ""Mallorca"" from the album ""Colors of Spain."" sets the mood for this gorgeous session with ""Rebecca.""  Rebecca has had sensuality training with the Welcomed Consensus, and in this demonstration, it is like a coming alive of one of her journal entries.  She takes us through her orgasm before, during, and after as she masturbates.

It is helpful to have done some sensuality training with the Welcomed Consensus to get the most out of this demonstration.  Rebecca tells us at the beginning of the DVD that this is a woman's guide to pleasuring one's body, and that the concepts are derived from the concepts of Deliberate Orgasm.
A student of their Basic Sensuality course, and Observation of Intense Coming (O.I.C.) course will fully understand the terminology of Rebecca's orgasm as she describes it, and will already be familiar with the techniques she uses on this sensual ride.

The staging of this session is beautiful.  Rebecca's private space is lovely, simple, and calm - a bed decorated with aqua, taupe, and coffee brown pillows of various textures.  The multitude of pillows reminds us to go for the ""plenty"" and be supported physically while masturbating.  She has a gorgeous, classical body - as if she stepped off a pedestal, a goddess carved by an ancient Roman sculptor.  There is certain wisdom in her eyes when she tells us that for her, ""pleasure is the foundation of life.""

The guidance for creating personal pleasure is printed clearly on the screen:  make the time, create the space, relax and enjoy.  The essential concepts of personal responsibility and being deliberate are also articulated.

Rebecca disrobes and then uses a full length mirror and a hand held mirror to look deeply at herself.  This is nor a clinical examination - she is visually drinking in big gulps of what she loves about her body.  The Welcomed Consensus recommend this exercise to turn oneself on prior to masturbating.  It is whimsical and powerful - she clearly demonstrates how visual appreciation of one's own body from all angles is the portal to further pleasure.  She describes how fun it is to notice the changes in her body as she turns on.

As she gazes at her pussy, I especially appreciate how she comments that she's worn her public hair in different ways over time, and that her favorite is the way it is here - completely natural.  Rebecca describes how much she likes experimenting with different textures and pressures of self touch.  This encourages the viewer to experiment as well, and to know that each time she masturbates it will be a wholly different experience.  She talks about conducting ""sensual research"" on herself to keep finding out what she likes over time.  One gets the sense that she has gathered such a collection of this sensual information, that she knows exactly what she likes.

Rebecca describes very specifically how she has come to like pulling the hood of her clitoris back and using light strokes directly on the most sensitive spot of her clitoris for the most sensation.  She details bringing herself up on ""peaks"" of orgasm by varying the speed and pressure of her strokes - doing what feels good in the moment.

The sounds of Rebecca's orgasm are familiar - I've heard other women express the ""oh, yes"" acknowledgement of the pleasure they are experiencing through this deliberate orgasm taught by the Welcomed Consensus.  At some point I lose track of what Rebecca is saying - her voice recedes into the background as I am caught up in the waves of orgasm emanating from her pussy.  I get really high - she gets quiet for a few moments, and I'm feeling suspended in mid-air, levitating.  All I can hear is her breathing.  It's a perfect pause in the soundtrack.

Rebecca's voice-over returns to describe the peaking at the exquisite height of her orgasm.  Then she ""takes herself over the edge"" and she describes how this is a choice - it feels right to do this now, in this moment.  Otherwise she might want to leave herself feeling high without going over the edge and going ""down.""  Rebecca clearly describes sensations of tissue engorgement and the heightened sensations in her body at this point in her orgasm.  It is beautifully instructional and informs the viewer that she can pay attention to these sensations as well along the way, at any point in her orgasm.

Rebecca demonstrates that even ""going over the edge"" is not necessarily the end point of orgasm, but a choice.  A woman is free to continue her orgasm, to go up again after a short break by continuing the strokes on her clitoris.  Rebecca is happy and gratified after her masturbation session, showing us what powerful fun can be had in twenty minutes.  She shows us the importance of savoring how her body feels, ""relishing"" and ""lavishing"" in the pleasure she's created for herself.",1339804800,8,4865,4.837968561064087
8519070,5,B007KDKH76,"This wonderful video offers a fun and refreshing way to experience masturbation and female orgasm. I watched this video because I was curious about ways that I could experience better and fuller orgasms while masturbating and with my partner - I am glad I made the decision to go for it.

From the very beginning of the video you can feel Rebecca's intention to create a pleasurable and sensual experience for her own enjoyment.  Whether touching her body with light touches, playing with her hair or stroking her clitoris with circular strokes, Rebecca does what feels good to her in the moment.

It was fun to watch and feel the intensity of Rebecca's orgasm build and go through various peaks. As the viewer, I could clearly observe her genitals engorge and change from a soft velvety mauve to a plush vibrant burnt sienna. The format of this video provides a rich experience for the viewer by offering a narration by Rebecca in addition to video footage.  Several times while watching a question would come to mind and shortly after Rebecca would discuss the topic in the narration.

I have viewed the video about a half a dozen times now and each time I feel something new in my own orgasm while masturbating and while sexing with my partner.  While masturbating it's been fun to play with different ways to sensitize my body and take myself on peaks as Rebecca does in the video.  After watching this video with my partner he was curious about how I like to touch my body. It has been fun talking about his questions and sharing what I have learned while masturbating with the techniques used in this video - our sex continues to get better and better.

I have also recommended this video to several of my female friends as a way that they can treat themselves to something pleasurable. It's easy to get caught up in the stresses of daily life and this video offers you a great way to take just a few moments out of your busy day and treat your body to a delightful sensual experience that is just for you.",1339027200,18,2012,4.554016620498615
