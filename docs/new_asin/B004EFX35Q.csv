4337261,5,B004EFX35Q,"I have done this video a few times now and really enjoy it.  I'm somewhat of a beginner of yoga, although I have been doing Tara's YouTube videos for a while now.  This video is great as it is about an hour long and gives you a great yoga class.  She takes you through a range of different poses without having to hold any pose for too long.  At the end of the video you feel relaxed and I think that this is what doing yoga is all about.",1302307200,,438,3.8876404494382024
4337262,5,B004EFX35Q,I love working out to Tara Stiles work out dvd and especially this daily yoga routine I am more flexible!,1297555200,,105,4.3
4337263,4,B004EFX35Q,"This is about 55 minutes of actual yoga practices.  I own about 200 exercise videos and did not find it super hard but parts of it were challenging.  I did it for the first time yesterday and wanted to write the review while fresh on my mind.

It has the following basic yoga poses that I can recall: warrior 1 and 2 and 3, chair, downward dog, upward dog, plank, several twists, eagle, boat, dolphin, soulder stands, lunges, bridge, plow, wheel, bound angle pose, wide legged seated forward bend, standing forward bend, mountain, pigeon, and tree.  It does not have crow or camel.

As one reviewer pointed out it does have the instructor say a lot whatever you want but that did not bother me.  I do like that she is actually doing the video as she talks so she is with you rather than providing instruction with a voiceover clip which is sometimes difficult to match exactly with the movements.  She is doing the video with you one on one.  There are no other students or participants to watch but her.  The setting is very simple and non-distracting and I don't remember noticing any distracting background music.

Some of the most challenging postures I remember were one where you have a variation off pigeon and you grab your back leg with your elbow and wrap both arms around it.  Also there is a sequence where you do lunges and come to stand with your leg up and then back down to lunges without using your hands which I found harder than some of the other poses.

So bottom line: good video.  Pros:  easy to follow, good instructor, not super new-agey or mystical, poses challenging but not ridiculous, good price.  Cons:  no chapter selections, not quite as much sweating or increased heart rate as some other yoga videos I have, no other instructors or participants to show modifications.

I do recommend and think you will enjoy.  I hope this review helps you.",1297296000,12,1873,4.590361445783133
4337264,1,B004EFX35Q,"She is very good in yoga but not as an instructor.  Her attitude is very laissez-faire and yoga is ""no big deal"".  She said that many times through out the video and also said ""whatever suits ya"" nonstop.  It was difficult to hear what she was saying as she mumbled a lot.  I do not recommend this video for yoga, as it does not provide enough instructions on the stance and poses--it was more like a stretching video.",1297296000,12,418,4.32051282051282
4337265,5,B004EFX35Q,"This DVD is really challenging but it worth it : results can be seen really quick. I am paying much more attention to my breathing, my legs get thinner and stronger and after each session I feel good. Tara give advice to be sure you do it well and with no chance to get hurt. i am really glad I bough it !!",1297209600,,306,3.873015873015873
4337266,5,B004EFX35Q,"I was so pleased when I scanned this DVD last night to see the poses Tara uses. I did the DVD this morning and it was fantastic. The routine is not as strenuous as her other DVD, which I find to be very difficult. This one is much more my style. The DVD is about 57 minutes long. It is a perfect balance between stretching, relaxation, balance, and strength. Tara uses a few more traditional poses such as triangle and child's pose. I'm pleased that there were more times to refresh and rejuvenate throughout the routine though child's pose, standing and stretching arms over head, upward dog, etc. I think this DVD is the best yoga routine I've done in a very very long time. I will be doing this more often.
The music was nice, too. Very soft and did not over power her. The camera work was great and Tara's instructions, as always, as clear and easy to follow - I did not find the need to keep looking at the screen to see what she was doing. Her instruction is top quality and she always reminds you to go where you can.
Finally, this is what I've been looking for.",1295827200,25,1069,4.270935960591133
4337267,5,B004EFX35Q,"I really enjoy Tara's authentic and practical style. I turned 50 this year and have done yoga and exercise most of my life but not regularly enough - now I put the dvd in my laptop and can do it anywhere and on my time rather than always going to a studio.  It is a long enough workout to feel challenged, you can work as hard as you need to and when you are finished you feel like you have had an all around lengthening and toning.  excellent.  Tara, make another one!",1294704000,5,469,4.076086956521739
4337268,4,B004EFX35Q,"I've been a long-time fan of Tara Stiles ever since I looked for yoga videos via YouTube. After finding her, I loved her style of teaching and her voice. She's very down to earth and makes yoga available for everyone, never using any sanskrit words or making it seem more complicated than it actually is. On her youtube, you can see all different sorts of videos, from ones with more challenging poses and ones for beginners.

This DVD has a lot of forward folds and downward dogs, which is very nice. However, based on some of her other videos, I expected a bit more difficulty. I realize this is a video for everyone, but I would have preferred some more advanced moves. If you're just starting out with yoga, Tara is and AWESOME instructor and this is a great beginning. However, it can be boring if you're doing it for more of a workout than a relaxation practice. Nevertheless, it's great to use in the mornings to help wake up and stretch for the day.",1294444800,3,957,4.468571428571429
4337269,5,B004EFX35Q,"Tara provides the viewer with a very balanced yoga routine. The DVD has a much more extensive workout than can be found in her YouTube Video routines, which are much more abbreviated.  In comparison, with a 55 minute runtime, Daily Yoga with Tara Stiles provides a much more vigorous workout. Although, throughout the flow of the exercise, Tara provides the viewer with alternative poses depending on your experience and capability. I wouldn't call this a beginner yoga video. Still, the level of difficulty is enough of a challenge to keep you from getting bored. I'm a little rusty, and haven't been challenging myself physically lately, so the routine kicked my butt. Nevertheless, the routine is reasonable enough that you don't have to worry about being tied up into a pretzel. Furthermore, Tara's demeanor and enthusiasm is encouraging, approachable and non-exclusive. This DVD is for everyone.",1294358400,39,900,5.206896551724138
4337270,4,B004EFX35Q,"This workout is 55 minutes long, and unlike many DVDs, it includes all the basic yoga poses. Lots of down dogs, planks, and forward folds. Also twists, lunges, boat moves, pigeon, tree, and more. The pace is more of a flow yoga with fairly limited holds of poses. The instructor gives very clear instructions and the moves are well captured on film. Jane Fonda (age 73) recently endorsed this and her other new workout videos based on having different needs as your body ages. Direct quote from print: """"I'm on this crusade to get older people out of the chairs, off their couches, moving in a way that's safe, easy and very doable even if they've never done it a day in their lives. It's never too late."" This workout is WAY more challenging than this quote would suggest. I'm age 55, in good health, a yoga practioner for 3 years, and lifelong exerciser and I needed child pose 35 minutes in to this video! Having said that, I look forward to many more tries and working up to the full length challenge.",1294099200,61,1005,4.497267759562842
4337271,3,B004EFX35Q,"Too difficult for a beginner.  Need some guidance in description of tape.  I do not recommend for beginners at all,  Too difficult.",1357344000,,131,4.863636363636363
4337272,4,B004EFX35Q,"I am an at-home yoga DVD junkie.  I bought this fairly yearly on in my ""practice"" and found it difficult, but as time wears on it has become a regular in the rotation.  If this is your first foray into the yoga DVD hold off on this one, but definitely pick it up for your larger collection.",1357171200,,290,4.0701754385964914
4337273,1,B004EFX35Q,"I have been doing yoga for 25+ years.  I enjoy Bryan Kest, Tamal Dodge, Travis Eliot, Rodney Yee, and many others -female and male.  I just did not enjoy the instruction or any of this dvd.",1355011200,2,189,4.222222222222222
4337274,5,B004EFX35Q,"I read reviews prioir to obtaining the DVD. I also follow Tara Stiles Blog. This was definitly helpful in dedicating an hour a day for yoga. The directions are straight forward and she has a storng focus on form.

I would however say that this is not for beginners. I would suggest doing Tara's 10 minute videos before doing this 1hour workout. Also to remember that yoga is a strength routine, when over done you will experience body cramps so therefore propoer form and technique should be your focus, not how well you can pull of the yoga pose. Do your best and don't push it!!

This DVD was advertised as a weight loss solution. I have to say that yoga and weight loss only work with propoer diet. Yoga works for weight loss because it streches your body, you donot over work yourself and have enough energy to do your daily tasks and concentrate on what food you are putting in your self.

I have properly followed this workout for 8 day in 2 weeks and have definitly felt the ease in reaching the poses. I haven't lost any major weight yet, but i can imagine doing this for a month and seeing some results!

Cannot wait for her new DVD ""this is yoga""!!",1346803200,2,1158,4.372093023255814
4337275,5,B004EFX35Q,I love Tara and especially this video; she makes it easy to do along with her and doesnt go too fast;,1342051200,,101,3.857142857142857
4337276,4,B004EFX35Q,"I really like this workout - it introduces moves and poses which may have been developed 30 years ago by Jane Fonda but seem to have been largely forgotten as they're not found in the numerous other yoga workouts that I've used.  I like that it's 56 minutes long, my whole body feels stretched and energized afterwards and the poses offer a lot of room for growth to increase my strength and flexibility, so I think I'll find this workout interesting for years to come. The fact that several of the poses are new to me makes the workout refreshing, and the poses feel natural and good for my body, not forced or potentially harmful at all.  My only critique is that Tara Stiles doesn't stay in each pose long enough, so I usually count to 8 slowly in each pose so that I'm sure to benefit from it. This causes me to be a step behind her at times but I'm able to finish the entire workout without feeling like I've cheated myself out of what each position has to offer.  Her calm instruction and judgement free ""what ever works best for you"" attitude is pleasant, I won't get tired of hearing her voice over the years either. This is the second dvd in this series by Jane Fonda that I've purchased and I look forward to discovering more of her ""comeback"" workouts.",1326931200,,1263,4.388888888888889
4337277,5,B004EFX35Q,"Since i first got intrested in yoga, I started looking for a workout that i could do everyday, no exceptions... i searched and searched and finally this dvd made the miracle for me. This yoga routine doesn't stress me out or tires me at all... i do it every morning before starting my day and after the first week i can already see the difference in my body (physically, spiritually and mentally). Im not an advanced yogi, im actually a beginner, but i improved so much thanks to this DVD.",1314748800,6,489,4.444444444444445
4337278,2,B004EFX35Q,"Having done yoga in the past, I thought Miss Fonda's Daily Yoga featuring Tara Stiles would be the perfect way to recapture my yoga wings. After receiving it, I watched the DVD several times, and was disappointment, realizing I'd wasted my time and money. This program (more workout than yoga) is not for me, or possibly any one who isn't limber and lightening quick to move with each stretch.  I agree with the person who says it's not for beginners.  I add, it's not for the average mature person wanting to begin or start over a yoga practice...it's a DVD for a young athlete, not older adults, even those of us who can double the session of her two dvds, Prime time's Walkout and Fitness and still have energy for yoga.  Jane, ""Bring it to us from your level. That's what we are expecting from your exercise/yoga programs at this time in our lives, yours and mine"". If you fit Jane Fonda's profile, give or take 20 years, save your money on this one. Susan",1311379200,4,960,4.474285714285714
4337279,2,B004EFX35Q,"Ms. Stiles is good at Yoga but not as a yoga teacher. This DVD is not for beginners or anyone needing modfications or demonstrations  of modifications. I am 61 yr old and take three Hatha yoga classes per week: I am  not new to yoga. I found her instructions often hard to hear (mumbling, eating her words) with little attention to modifications. Aside from her suggesting that you take a deep breath, there was little attention to the role of the breath in relation to the movement. I felt she was too relaxed/casual in her manner: assuming that the audience was actually using proper alignment with few cues regarding possible tricks to prevent common position errors. Savasana was very brief. I gave this DVD to my daughter who is a Certified Yoga Instructor. She hasn't given me her opinion yet but it would be interesting to hear what she thinks.
This is one Yoga DVD I did not find useful nor enjoyable. I am glad I did not buy it for a higher price.",1306540800,18,956,4.488505747126437
4337280,5,B004EFX35Q,"I loved this dvd! It is very different from traditionnal yoga that's for sure, but that's one of the reasons I like it. I practice with the french equivalent of ""Light on Yoga: Yoga Dipika"", by B. K. S. Iyengar, I love his practice, but I also love her (yoga-)style, her voice is not annoying (a big issue for me when practicing with a dvd) and I thought the instructions were good enougth so that I could understand them without looking. At the end I felt calm, strong, happy and open, ready for my day :) (I just stood in savasana a bit longer)",1303776000,,546,4.259615384615385

8426922,2,B004EFX35Q,"I am a certified yoga teacher, and this DVD is not at all for beginners. This is a challenging workout for intermediate and advanced students only. The instructor moves and speaks very quickly. If you have no or limited yoga experience, this DVD would be extremely difficult to follow.",1435363200,,285,4.836734693877551
8426923,3,B004EFX35Q,"I thought it would be harder.  When Jane Fonda endorses something, I expect a certain level of work to happen. And I'm not a yoga expert, by any means.  A little disappointing.",1429660800,,176,4.46875
8426924,5,B004EFX35Q,"This yoga flow is a beautiful workout for those who love the CHALLENGE. Tara guides us gracefully through a variety of yoga poses, focused to build strenght, balance, stretch, lengthening (and SWEAT - A LOT!), etc. I agree it's not for beginners, and if you don't exercise regularly, I would recommend you to start with the DVD set ""This is Yoga"" (or just buy ""Tara Stiles This is Yoga DVD 2: Beginners Yoga for Everyone""). But if you like Tara Stiles' approach to yoga, you will enjoy this flow (it has some variations from Tara's usual series). You will have a great workout, while you release tension at the same time.",1389139200,2,621,4.603603603603603

I'm 48 and have been doing about 20 min yoga 3x/wk as part of my daily routine.  Tara is, to me, that right balance of ""you can do it"" and ""do what you can"".",1382313600,2,335,3.8970588235294117

8426929,4,B004EFX35Q,"First of all, I LOVED this DVD. The routine was great and it kept me entertained. I usually don't have the focus to do a whole hour of yoga-- I tend to get bored at home. But not with this one :)

Anyway buyers be aware that this is an HD-DVD. It may not work on your DVD player. I couldn't get it to work on any of my DVD players (Xbox, Wii, regular DVD player) but it did in fact work on my last DVD player (thank god!) I would have researched this more before I purchased it had I known it was an HD-DVD but it does explain why you can't buy them at Target anymore. Most HD-DVDs are combo discs (I'm still unsure whether this is a combo or literally just HD) meaning you can watch them on regular DVD players too but for some reason this just was not happening on any of mine. Bummer.

So long story short: Great DVD, totally recommend it! Just make sure your player will be able to play it!",1357516800,,894,3.988826815642458
