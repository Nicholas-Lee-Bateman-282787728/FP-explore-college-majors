614758,5,6303274714,Shaka Zulu is one of my wife and my favorite series of all time.  It seems to be true to life as it existed for the Zulus.,1355788800,,122,3.5185185185185186
614759,5,6303274714,This move is breath taking.  Everyone should see this at least once a year.  Very informing and question...Why isn't this story told in our history books?  Interesting.,1317168000,,168,5.148148148148148
614760,5,6303274714,"Henry Cele plays the South African Zulu King, ""Shaka Zulu."" Shaka - meaning in Zulu, ""the disease of the beetle,"" was rejected by his Father, Prince of a small Zulu village, and his Mother, Nandie, put through humiliating public displays of disdain by Shaka's Father. That rejection made Shaka into a young man who would be King with a hardened heart. Though he unified all Zulu people, he became a tyrannical leader who ruled with absolute power and authority. This is a true story of a Warrior King of South Africa who trusted very few people and felt that he could not love because of the pain his Father had inflicted upon his Mother, his Grandmother who died fleeing his Father's death sentence and himself. Shaka's curious nature about the Europeans is very interesting as he learns how to write and interpret the Europeans intentions after their arrival on the Cape of South Africa. This film is necessary viewing for anyone interested in Africa. Henry Cele's performance is beyond excellent. Cele was a star soccer player for South Africa in the 1970s.",1197331200,2,1060,4.829670329670329
614761,5,6303274714,"""I was not very impressed by the caption"", ""The most Savage Warrior of all times"" even after watching the movie. I never saw savage, I saw a very clever revengeful boy, who grew with much hate for the ones who had done his family: Mother, Grandmother and sister as well as himself, Wrong. This warrior, who became a King, as told in the movie was destined to become a powerful King and rule over all Kraal's, which is the word the British chosen to be used for the Africans instead of empire's. So when one is not subjected to a way of another's way of living,then they  choose to degraded another's way of life, with words. Powerful and savagery! I guess if I had to wonder in the wildernest for years I just might have a revenge problem as well.

I am still stuck on some of these chosen words by supposedly intelligent writers. Savage Warrior - would mean - untrained, uncivilized barbarian. Well people who can not think without killing would be barbarian's and people who defend would be called what??? Well there was not a trace of that with Chaka, he was thinking all the time for revenge of what had happened to his family and since His Grandmother had to die a harsh death, he figured the one's who sent them out to die should get the same justice. Justice!

Chaka was a true King and a powerful warrior first and foremost, and his reign of super intelligence, courage beyond words and the physical strength to achieve his goals. This King was not afraid of any man and with just a spear that he designed and shield that he designed, became a killing machine. He had his army stand before men with cannons and guns. WOW! amazing, and even more amazing they were undefeated. What  military strategy. Now I am not quite sure if I remember why the British were afraid of him when he had nothing to do with them, oh! yes take over, fear. Yes, I remember now. Fear!

But I loved the mind of this King, he was not easily baited as planned by the British, nor easily defeated as planned. I am not a favorite of what wars do to humans, but if I had to march or fight behind a great king this would have been the one. Purpose! fight for a purpose. Not just for greed.

Review: This is a must see even now, Yes, it is an old version, but it is far better then the version I saw just recently, where Chaka was a captured slave. I better do some more reading, I don't remember that he was a captured slave. So I just might need to update my memory.  Yet back to this film, I showed this to my children, many times, when they were young, it was a part of their history lesson. Try to never be manipulated..Try to be cleaver, like Fox. Henry Cele - (Shaka Zulu) was an outstanding actor, he was very powerful in his performance, as well as the young Shaka, I did not get his name not even on the credits here. I would have to look on the movie for his name. But this child did a superb job and the young man who portrayed Shaka as a teen, I did not see his name either, but he too, did a superb, job. I will have to look up their names, as for Dudu Mkhize who played his mother Nandi, and his Aunt; Mkabay, played by; Gugu Nxumalo. Now for the other names of the Zulu's and the other African Actors or people who portrayed these characters, names are not quite clear to me. Help!  I was quite fond of the Dr. Henry Finn, played by Robert Powell, who seemed to narrate the movie as well as write the story, excellent job. This is a remarkable based true story. I give it a thumbs up. 5 star....",1155427200,5,3488,4.226726726726727
614762,5,6303274714,"I think I saw this on TV. The fighting is so realistic as to be terrifying. Not for the weak of heart or stomach. But like vampire films, it does have its macabre appeal. The movie fails to create any sympathy for the Africans who were colonized and suppressed by Europeans.",1078876800,4,274,4.392156862745098
614763,4,6303274714,"The video is great; the one unfortunate aspect being that it is edited from the original TV series to a degree in which some of the characters do not fulfill their personalities and impact upon the life of Shaka. Aspects of Shaka's childhood have been left out that appeared in the TV series and which greatly help to clarify some of his later actions and personality traits. Yet another thing I found disappointing is that it is told from the point of a white man, a needless aspect.
In spite of this though it is a great story of a little known part of African history documenting the difficult childhood of Shaka, his rise to prominence and forging of the Zulu Empire from a kingdom of a few thousand to one of hundreds of thousands.
Some great characterizations, a particular favourite being Shaka's maiden aunt Mkabayi. If anyone is interested they may also want to purchase E.A. Ritter's book 'Shaka Zulu' which explores many of the myths surrounding Shaka. A great video though and well worth the money.",1037318400,9,1010,4.679775280898877
614764,5,6303274714,"The story follows Shaka,...son of the Zulu prince and his rise to greatness, but ultimately it's about the first interaction the Zulu nation had with British colonials and how everything in the royal court and the Zulu empire changes because of this first contact. Can you imagine us meeting an alien race for the first time? That's what it must have been like for Shaka and his people...There's intrigue and betrayal in the royal court; battles and the clever chess-like interaction between Shaka and Lt. Francis Farewell. What more do you want?
I'm so happy I bought this DVD set. It was truly a taste from my childhood and a story I will always enjoy.",1037059200,4,654,4.695652173913044

614766,5,6303274714,Just so you know what your getting into this dvd is 3 dvds long but each dvd is two sided.  Its very long very british and very detailed.  That said if you like reading novels but lost your attention span this is a good way to learn the story of britis in afrika.  It moves along well.  I have only made it thru the fist dvd so far.  the other thing is there a lot of nude scenes so beware if you are offended by young black nude women.  also som shots of old chicks boob.  so i would say its a good legal alternive to that R. kelly video that could get you arested. A good epic with no lesbians to ruin it. Enjoy your day.,1020556800,2,623,3.858267716535433

614808,5,6303274714,"This is an outstanding series.  This tells of the rise and power of the Warrior King Shaka Zulu.  Shaka Zulu ruled with an iron fist over the Zulu Nation (current day South Africa) for over 30 years.  Henry Cele portrays the powerful leader in a convincing way.  This series never has a dull moment and is riveting to watch.  Shaka Zulu was embittered towards his father who was a Zulu King due to his harsh treatment of his mother, sister, and grandmother and it is Shaka's quest to bring him to justice and to take over as King.
Eventually, Shaka Zulu completes his goals and crowns himself King of the mighty Zulu Nation.  The Zulu's were fierce warriors, just ask the British and the Boers.  A European missionary who was in the Zulu territory said that the landscape was littered with bones and skulls due to Shaka Zulu's fierceness of battle and conquest.
The story does end with the downfall and death of Shaka Zulu, as all mighty leaders must fall and die over due course, but Shaka Zulu definitely had a full life.  He was cunning, a brilliant battle strategist and a great warrior, he is one of the few true conquerors of history, and is yet overlooked due to Western Civilizations ignorance of African history.  Hopefully, one day this will be solved.  There was controversy at the time of the making of this film in 1983 due to it being filmed and produced in Apartheid South Africa, but the film and the director due the Zulu's justice.  It does not take anything away from the story and the proud history of the Zulu tribe.
This film is highly recommended to those who enjoy a riveting film about battle, treachery, revenge and triumph.  The historical accuracy is also quite good with just a few minor details that were not true, but overall it is a good historical portrait of the mighty Shaka Zulu.",1006646400,17,1815,4.567901234567901

614811,5,6303274714,"Shaka Zulu represents one of the best stories ever filmed in Africa. It truly represents the way of life in certain areas of the southern region of Africa at that time and it clearly illustrates the inter- tribal rivalry, which is found back, to a great extend, in present live in Africa. I was living in Douala, Cameroon, West Africa (or, for the French speaking: Cameroun) when I watched this movie for the first time.

614812,5,6303274714,"In Cy Endfield's 'Zulu' and the sequel 'Zulu Dawn', as well as an awful faux-patrician accent by the young Michael Caine (stick to cockney roles please Michael!) we encountered the Zulu nation merely as a monolithic black asegi-waving horde that was obliging enough to offer itself up as canon fodder to the measured firepower of British redcoats. However, we learned nothing about the Zulus as individuals or as a people suffice that they were brave and had a certain respect for the bravery shown by their foes. In Shaka Zulu, we encounter these magnificent people 'National Geographic' style with the capable telling of the origins and eventual pre-eminence of Shaka Zulu, the father of the Zulu nation.
Make no mistake, though. Shaka's not the kind of guy you'd invite home to meet the parents. He ranks alongside Darius, Atilla, Stalin and Hitler as one of the great despotic rulers of all time. The story is told in two threads: the first strand involves a group of English emmissaries sent to parlay (and stall) Shaka as his expansionism began to threaten the Cape Colony.
The second (and more interesting thread by far) tells the story of Shaka's mother, Nandi, and how she overcame unbelievable adversity in siring Shaka against great social prejudice and how her sick little boy grew up to become one of the most feared men in Africa. Simply marvellous stuff with brilliant vintage performances by Henri Cele as Shaka, as well as Edward Fox and Robert Powell.
As Jack Hawkins' reverend Witt character said in 'Zulu', ""the Zulu are a great people!"" You better believe it.",979344000,4,1580,4.899253731343284
614813,5,6303274714,"Politics, magic, betrayal, legend, intrigue, power, scandal, war, arrogance and tragedy.  There are only three miniseries I'd ever like to own, and this is one of them.
King Shaka is protrayed as a child of destiny who fully intended to make all the use of it he could.  The actors who played him as both a boy and man were both nearly frightening in their intensity.  Even memories of the lead actor give me chills.
Shaka was devestatingly intelligent, equally arrogant and only mildly ignorant because of his limited exposure to the outside world.  This production makes me wonder what would have happened had he ever been able to travel.  The Zulu nation became such an astounding force that England eventually took serious note, and this film succeeds in showing the amazing scale of what the Crown was up against.  Compared to the mythic tale of Shaka's origin, the framing story -- a envoy telling this legend to Queen Victoria -- is heartbreaking.
If watching this film doesn't bring a derisive smirk to your face when you hear someone refer to ""jungle bunnies,"" I doubt that anything will.

This movie is very long, I can say that, but the acting and the  cinemetography is wonderful. The soundtrack could use a little work,  though. The story basically focuses on the life of the Zulu chief Shaka  Zulu from his illegitemate birth to a commoner to his rise in power as a  chief to his death. After shaka zulu was born, he was forced to leave his  village because he was born between a prince and a commoner. Out in the  wildnerness, he learns to live under the harsh conditions.

The other noticable thing  was Henry Cele's portrayal of Shaka. I don't know Mr. Cele; he may be the  kindest most gentle and loving man on Earth, but Shaka is the devil. Pure  Evil. Scary.

Here, ""Shaka Zulu"" has astoundingly created a time machine in which to encompass  the viewer within the very hear and soul of this man, and how his family  and he suffered and fought to finally become one of the most awesomely  powerful tribes in Africa. How proud the Zulu nation must be to have this  legacy portrayed for them...although, perhaps necessarily brutal.  The  intelligence of this King Shaka Zulu overwhelmed the United Kingdom. Don't  pass this up! Take a day off to enthrall yourself in this historical drama.  I've heard negative critiques about the witch doctor, but I think she's  fun.
