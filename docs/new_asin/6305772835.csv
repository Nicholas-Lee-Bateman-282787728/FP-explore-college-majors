1067344,5,6305772835,"My 6 year old French-speaking son loves to watch most of this black and white film in English with his 44 year old daddy.
The 2 of us have a great time on the sofa savouring the pursuits (there's a wonderful canoe pursuit by the way), the attacks and even the love scenes.
It's possible to enjoy this version even better than the 1992 version.
A family delight !
(The 1920 silent version is very good too but more terrifying)",1024099200,23,425,4.325
1067345,5,6305772835,"That's the fate awaiting Cora and Alice Munro (Binnie Barners and Heather Angel) if they're not rescued by Hawkeye (Randolph Scott) and Major Duncan Heywood (Henry Wilcoxin) first. This is a very enjoyable adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's classic about the French and Indian War and the clashes between colonials and British foreshadowing the Revolution to come. British Duncan's stiff regulations and refusal to understand his environment contrast with American Hawkeye's common sense approach to life and survival. Yet both must work together if the French and the Huron are to be staved off and the women brought safely to shelter at Fort William Henry.  Wilcoxin is a much better actor than Scott, so the movie is easily his. While his politics are wrong by colonial standards, he nevertheless is brave, performing more acts of courage than Scott's Hawkeye, actually. My other favorite actors are the girls' father Colonel Munro and the French marquise and his aide. The aide especially makes the most of a rather small part, as when he opens a dispatch with a great flourish. Bruce Cabot plays Magua, the evil Mohawk Indian--he's a veteran of  ""King Kong"" as is composer Max Steiner, who ""borrows"" some of his own score from that 1933 movie for a thrilling canoe chase.  Downside: Sorry to say that I haven't read the novel, so I can't be sure, but it seems to me that the Mohicans themselves don't get much play in this version. Uncas is lovesick, period, for Alice, while Chingachcook generally scowls and makes a comment about beavers or some such.  Enlist some of your friends to watch this fast-paced adventure classic with you sometime soon--you'll be glad you did.",996796800,31,1681,4.97153024911032

1067486,4,6305772835,"As a very young guy (12/13) I watched this movie and liked it a lot. Watching it now as a mid-semi-older man I also enjoyed it but must admit that I now enjoy the newer (Daniel Day Lewis) version more. The visuals and realistic enactment of the seige of the British Fort is absolutely stunning enough to make me think that it would be like that if I were inside the actual fort. The scenes of the massacre when the remaining survivors of the battle were ambushed by the French allied Indians was brutal and so realistic again that I could almost feel that I could have been there. The soundtrack is one that I have purchased and is very, very good. The last 20-25 minutes of the movie when the Mohican Father and his two sons are pursuing their Indian enemies holding the two English Colonels daughters hostage is tense, edge of your seat stuff that makes me admire the craftsmen who create these scenes and film them. So in conclusion I would recommend that a person first watch this 1939 version followed by the newer version right afterwards. You will enjoy them both and hopefully consume mucho pizza, popcorn and in my case Pepsi Original on ice. Bye for now. Scott (I would be very interested in any form of constructive criticism on my reviewing style) Thank you!",1483315200,2,1270,4.526086956521739

1067565,5,6305772835,"I think it so interesting that people are still reviewing a 1936 movie.  I have read the book (very interesting style of writing in the early 1800's), seen the various movies, and enjoyed it all.  We forget the raw, difficult challenges of 1757 on the frontier until we see a movie like this.  People can bemoan that (gasp) a white actor portrayed an indian but the story of the frontier during a war between European powers affecting local peoples is what makes this great.  Someday I'd like to see a non-white portray George Washington or similar in our history, good acting is what matters not skin color.

I think the 1992 remake did a better job of showing how native americans and settlers were living together in peace until the European powers got involved.  Also, because it has better technology the vistas and scenery of upstate New York are really good in the remake.",1480464000,,879,4.675324675324675

1067823,3,6305772835,"This is the film upon which the Michael Mann version of ""Last of the Mohicans"" was based. Like so many Hollywood historical films it is based not on events but on a previous screenplay. It is not particularly like the novel by James Fennimore Cooper. The element from the novel that is missing is the gratuitous racism.

In the book the hero Natty Bumpo is a white man who grew up among Indians. So he knows all sorts of wood lore - the sort of thing I learned in the Boy Scouts. But he is haunted by the possibility that someone will think that he is part Amerindian. So he keeps declaring his whiteness at every opportunity. David Duke isn't so touchy about his racial status.

This plot had to be changed to preserve the idea of the ""Noble Red Man"" and what kind of name is Natty Bumpo? So Hollywood crafted a conventional plot with good Indians and bad Indians. The main bad Indian is played by Bruce Cabot - fresh from King Kong. In the Mann remake they use a real Indian, Here they just use a lot of pancake makeup.

The Mann movie is famous for it's musical score and slightly psychedelic action. This version is more conventional. Randolph Scott is very handsome and henry Wilcoxon is very stalwart.",1469318400,,1207,4.427927927927928

1068048,4,6305772835,"I liked it. It helped me understand a historical setting for the fiction. It helped me understand the French and Indians vs the English before the Revolutionary war and the natural tie to the battle of Yorktown.

I liked it. It reminded me of the universal appeal to the black song ""I'd rather die than be a slave."" In this fiction, an English woman would rather die than be an Indian squaw. Militant black Americans who have no appreciation of our shared heritage of struggle should see this movie and join together with whites to understand what happened to the aboriginals on this continent. Indians think the land belongs to the power over everything, but under the Catholic doctrine of discovery, mimicked by five countries in Europe, Indians were pushed off their land in favor of English law, which had no jurisdiction before the globe and certainly not in Indian territory (the USA before it was the USA). The blacks were slaves and did not participate, but 250 years later, their descendents are the beneficiaries. In short, the preamble to the Constitution for the USA applies to blacks and they need to work with everyone to establish A Civic People of the United States. Sorry to preach, but I see most art in light of A Civic People but feel ability to influence only this country. Existing treaties and my ignorance make it difficult for me to comment on how Indians can be of A Civic People of the United States, but I am studying.

1068191,5,6305772835,"In my youth, I read Last of the Mohicans and The Pathfinder. This movie is a basic, no-frills version of the classic by James Fenimore Cooper. The more recent Last of the Mohicans with Daniel Day Lewis goes into much more detail and is a world of difference in color.  But for those nostalgic aficionados among us, a beaten-up version of classic acting and story line is a nice contract to the million dollar budgets of today's Hollywood.  A special recognition should go to Bruce Cabot for his portrayal of Mugwa. Cabot stoically delivers his lines in the movie as if carefully selecting evry word from his Huron heart to hurt the English people.. He is defiant and hateful to Colonel Munro (and his daughters) to the end.  Randolph Scott does an excellent job of portraying Hawkeye as the more authentic character in my opinion, although less complex a character. Day Lewis's character almost seems super-human in skill, cunning and firearms accuracy. Those old backwoods long rifles were better than the British muskets, but not quite THAT accurate. All in all, this movie is about a simpler time and simple story. The good guys are clearly good and the bad guys are clearly bad.",1427587200,5,1182,4.784313725490196

This one is far superior in production, story depth and rendition, acting and script. Although Daniel Day Lewis is an appealing Hawkeye, Randoph Scott is a better one--holding truer to the attitudes and style of people of the period of time in which the story  occurs. Randolph Scott portrays Hawkeye sympathetically, heroically, and intelligently.

I highly recommend this story to anyone who wants to understand the times and events of the French and Indian War, and the frontiers men and women who lived then. It is a truly enjoyable film and true to the times in a way that Lewis's version does not. Further, this rendition is closer to James Fenimore Cooper's depiction of these historical events.",1363996800,3,903,4.85064935064935

I had, earlier seen the new 1995 version of the same movie, even though it was technically more sound I still enjoyed the 1936 version more.

After several days of bombardment by French-Indian forces, Monro surrendered to French General Louis Montcalm, only to be killed by the Indians along with his men, their families, and servants.,
Here is Hollywood's best take on the siege of Fort William Henry in a rousing action-packed adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's novel, ""Last of the Mohicans.""

1068470,4,6305772835,"I'm not going to review the film itself, there are plenty of decent reviews out there in praise of this minor 1936 classic and it's common knowledge that Director Michael Mann used much of the dialogue from this version for his own 1992 epic remake. (This films' screenwriter Philip Dunne is rightly credited in the newer version). I just want to say that the brand new Hen's Tooth release is the best looking one yet. No it's not perfect, but then this isn't Casablanca or some such timeless masterpiece from a major studio willing to spend money on an extensive restoration. That said, some money has been spent to make this film look and (in most cases) sound decent enough. Does it still have gliches and pops? A few slight gliches maybe, no discernable pops and certainly nothing as distracting as every other copy previous. The black and white cinematography is a little more pleasing to the eye  making this film as watchable as could be sans an expensive redo.  For now this is as good as it's going to get and I think anyone waiting for a Blu-ray style clean-up would be wasting their time. If you are a fan of this film then this copy is for you.",1334966400,10,1156,4.5
1068471,3,6305772835,"I've been trying to find this version for some time and finally acquired this quasi-bootleg copy.  The film is out of print so this is what I had to resort to.  In any case, it is a pretty good attempt to visualize Cooper's great novel which takes place in 1757 in upstate New York.  The British are fighting the French for control of this part of the New World.  Col. Munro is to go to Fort Henry to defend the territory from the French and their allies, the Huron.  His daughters have just arrived from England and are to accompany him.

Munro's Indian guide, Magua (Bruce Cabot) takes the two daughters and Major Heyward (Henry Wilcoxin) via a ""short trail"".  Heyward also has eyes for Alice (Binnie Barnes).  Another ally of the Brits is Hawkeye (Randolph Scott) and his two Mohawk companions, Chingachgook and his son Uncas.  They know Magua to be untrustworthy so follow them while Munro and his main force trudge onward to the Fort.

Eventually the daughters with Hawkeye's help reach the Fort, but it is under siege from the French and the Huron.  There are a couple chaste romantic subplots worth mentioning.  Alice eventually casts off Heyward and his strict military manner for Hawkeye.  Cora (Heather Angel) and Uncas (Phillip Reed) become an item prior to their tragic end.  This film shows its age, but the story holds up.  The sets were sometimes on location in California's Big Bear Park which gives some of the action authenticity.  The acting from the main characters is very good, but the bit players not so much.  Caucasians are used for the 3 lead Indian roles, but others are used as extras.

I don't usually comment about the quality of DVD's unless there is something special.  First off, the picture of the brown case is not what comes with the DVD.  This DVD appears to be copied on a DVD-R from a VHS tape.  The picture, while grainy and unstable in places, is watchable.  A couple scenes change tint and sound abruptly, apparently where splicing occurred.  Occasionally you can see a light greenish tint on the left side of the picture along with noticeable tape mis-alignment.  This isn't as bad as it sounds but is sometimes what you get with an out of print film.  This excellent story is nowhere near the grand Michael Mann film version from 1992, but is certainly better than other attempts I've seen.  Criterion, we need you.",1320451200,,2359,4.665048543689321
1068472,5,6305772835,"It is so thrilling to at last see a restored version of the most imitated cinema ""Last of the Mohicans"" to date. Despite a withering review of Cooper's work done by Mark Twaine no less, this is the one film version that will drive youths to seek out the other Pathfinder works by this chronicleer of Indian romance. It captures completely the rugged individualism and independence of mind of the American patriot. In the novel, Cooper spends a great deal of time on man/nature contemplations and indian lore that get lost when undertaken by contemporary directors looking for a new spin on a classic storyline. Randolph Scott was handsomely made for this part, so virile and stout-minded in this part guaranteeing film immortality in this role as 'Hawkeye',with flashes of Errol Flynn mannerisms throughout. The staging of battle scenes and excellent editing keeps pace with the action that only slows for subliminal character touches. The casting, if you will excuse the studio use of Bruce Cabot as Magua and other non-indian portrayals, is exceptional, particularly Binnie Barnes and her devoted beau played most ably by Henry Wilcoxon(The Crusades,Antony & Cleopatra and Caddyshack). Others can re-tell the plot, but I must remark on the extraordinary sensitive repartee between the British officers and the colonialists that probably sealed our attachment to our mother country a few years later in WWII. Even between opposing generals, Montcalm or Webb, the officers speak nobly and eloquently at close quarters. At the end of day, the savage beast of man is the enemy in this classic tale of treachery, betrayal, minutes-to-spare escapes and captures on foot or canoe. (recent Cooper research has this tale more probable than fiction)No one looked better than Randolph Scott in his leathered  gear and distinctive coonskin cap in Big Bear country. When you read Cooper's works you get the added treat of learning the French names for Uncas(le coerf agile/Running Deer)and Hawkeye (le long carabine) and how they came to be; as well as other nuggets. This is a truly great adventure story for any lad who wants to tread quietly the hallowed corridors of the forest.",1317513600,11,2171,5.098314606741573

To me, this movie had a contrived feel to it--Hawkeye actually wears a coonskin cap ala Daniel Boone; the Indians grunt a lot; the acting is overdramatic as many of the older films are; the music is grating on the nerves.  The war scenes are realistic, however, and the familiar antagonism between Duncan and Hawkeye is still palpable.

I have to remind myself that this film was made nearly 80 years ago and was no doubt a landmark film for that era.  I am just glad I live in this era of film making.  It was a good film to watch once or twice, but not over and over as I have the modern version.",1309564800,,726,4.048951048951049

1068507,4,6305772835,"Having first viewed this film as a youngster I cannot forget how captivated I was (and to some degree, still am) at the sheer pleasure of being transported back to our country's earliest days....despite a strong British foothold on the continent, the land remained raw, majestic and foreboding.  Add the elements of a simmering conflict between the two historical superpowers at this time (France and Britain), mix in two waring Indian tribes (the Mohawks and Mohicans), two vulnerable females (the Colonel's daughters), a dashing frontiersman (Hawkeye), a staid British Major, spectacular outdoor locations and the inevitable romantic entanglements you have the ingredients of classic Hollywood cinema.
  The 1990's remake was in itself bold and beautifully filmed; I kept comparing Daniel Day Lewis to Randolph Scott's portrayal of Hawkeye and remember Scott being more handsome and romantic with a touch of backwoods common sense; Major Duncan was best portrayed by the great character actor Henry Wilcoxon (a favorite of Cecil B. DeMille) I cannot recall the chap who was cast in Michael Mann's version; Chinghackook was more realistic with Mann's casting of American Indian Activist Russell Means and Wes Studi as the devilish Magua-now with this having been said I still recall being frightened by the sheer evilness of Bruce Cabot's Magua and his limited but effective lines in the script (albeit cliche ridden which was common for the time).  The battle scenes from the original were realistically staged and nicely shot given the claustrophobic quarters of an inside stage; the horror and chaos of close-quarter combat aptly portrayed in black and white celluloid; Michael Mann probably spent significantly more, had special effects not even dreamed in 1936; in short both films were handsomely shot and each outstanding in various cinematic venues.  I, however, will remain true to my boyhood remembrances....I was fortunate enough to make a DVD copy from a late-nite classic movie channel and find myself popping this RKO jewel into the magic box....yes, for a few brief moments I can once again be shouldering my flintlock, adjusting my longknife in its sheath and quietly heading off to parts unknown..........",1279065600,20,2223,5.321937321937322

While a great inprovement, the LD was still washed out and just passable to watch. Although I know getting pristine elements would be slim to none I never expected this transfer to be on par with my old VHS. Quite a disapointment. If anything it should have been taken from the LD. What is even more surprising is when I saw TCM was playing it, I took a chance and TIVO'ed it and their print is cleaner than any of my versions! So...I recorded it to my Toshiba RD-XS34, burned a DVD, and replaced Movieology's with it. No I didn't throw their DVD out ('tho the thought crossed my mind) but I won't watch it again.

If you check Amazon.uk, Movieology is making a big deal out of releasing B movie horror classics in widescreen remastered versions. Why not go all the way for every release? Achor Bay and Blue Underground made their reputations on DVD, Image and Roan on Laserdisc were the same. I'm not saying it has to be the best, but why settle for the worst? Now I am a big Randolph Scott fan and this movie is a must have, as far as I'm concerned, but it really didn't scream to be released without checking for a better source. Seriously, this is not on any list or petition.

While I'm grateful an effort is made to release classics that are out of print or have never been released on home video, I feel some care should be taken to ensure a decent product to the niche audience this appeals to.

1068510,3,6305772835,"The Bottom Line:

Although this version of Cooper's novel is mercifully free of the self-importance that mars Michael Mann's more recent adaptation, it's unfortunately characterized by the hammy acting endemic to lesser actors of the past, a lack of suspense, and a pace that frequently lags (it's about 35 minutes shorter than Mann's version but feels longer); all things considered The Last of the Mohicans is an obscure film that should stay as such.

You lose some of the emotional impact in 1936 compared to the remake in 1992, but it's not a bad little film. Not really. Although some of the costumes and dialogue are too cliche.

Some things grate, however. All the Native Americans are, of course, white actors. You have to expect that from the time period in question, but you can't help but wince about it today. However, I must say the actors who portrayed Chingachgook and Uncas did a particularly good job, imo, though Chingachgook should have looked much older. (And maybe they should have done a little more makeup preparation than putting a black wig on the guy.) However, the final battle between Chingachgook and Magua is pretty violent and brutal, even by 1936 standards, and Chingachgook's final speech is, as always, moving. The movie nails those points.

If you like this story, and want to see a fairly good representation of the novel, and if you can view it through the lens of post-code 1936 American racism, you could do a lot worse than this movie. Give it a peek.",1255132800,5,1177,4.681159420289855

I missed this item on Laserdisc as it was deleted when I went to order it. However, I viewed with interest the DVD Special Edition from a distributor I had not heard of before. I ordered and although it is not bad the quality is far below what i would have expected which is why I would give it a low rating. As a film it is fine but then I am biased as I like Randolph Scott films. By all means buy it if Scott and esterns from the 1930s are your bag but don't expect top quality like a Warner Bros restoration.

1068545,4,6305772835,"For those who come to the 1936 version of THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS after having read the novel by James Fenimore Cooper will soon discover that this black and white version is fundamentally sharing the same vision of America that enthralled frontier America in the 1840s.  America at that time was a seemingly endless megafauna of forest, wildlife, rampaging Indians, settlers, and constant battle between the French and British. This version directed by George Seitz takes some minor liberties with the plot but retains the essentials of the book: beautiful but simpering women taken hostage by lusting Indians, fierce attempts by the hero Hawkeye (Randolph Scott) to free them, vicious battles between troops and Indians, a bravura performance by the villianous Magua (Bruce Cabot), and ultimately more than a few hints that the relationship between the red man and white man need not be limited to savagery.  Uncas the son of Chingachgook is selfless in his love for Alice the daughter of the British commander of Fort William Henry. There is, however, an unfortunate tendency to portray Indians as little more than bloodthirsty and mindless brutes all of whom were clearly white actors sporting Mohican style haircuts. Still, what one takes away from THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS is a faithful approximation of a country that was only a few decades away from yet another cataclysmic struggle between the desire of Americans for freedom and an equally powerful desire by the British to deny them that freedom. James Fenimore Cooper both in his book and in this film by Seitz allow the viewer to experience how injustice heaped on one race can lead to injustice heaped on another.",1230336000,3,1678,5.010752688172043
1068546,4,6305772835,"EDWARD SMALL, known for later smaller productions, produced for UNITED ARTISTS. The movie was shot at RKO-Path studios. The second unit material was directed by WALLACE FOX and shot in California, standing for the future N.Y. state. We are in 1757, as shown by the full title of the 1826 novel. GEORGE B.SEITZ had started in the industry in 1914, when he was 26 (those were the days!) with a PATHE SERIAL, 17 serials all together. He went through various studios, including MAYFAIR (I must confess that I don't know anything about it). At last, in 1933 he was at MGM for 24 movies, who will include 12 titles of the ANDY HARDY series.
He must have known his way around a studio as our movie shows, the SEITZ movies are hard to find. The film was written by PHILIP DUNNE, the great screen writer and later director
RANDOLPH SCOTT was already an established actor, thanks to his good looks and efficient modest style. He is mostly known for his later COLUMBIA and WARNER westerns, but he had starred.in B westerns in the thirties.
His parts in the two ASTAIRE/ROGERS movies had done him no harm. Great movies would serve him in the forties (MY FAVORITE WIFE, JESSE JAMES)
I am not a member of the ""older is better"" school but he is brilliant here in his usual unassuming way as Hawkeye. BINNIE BARNES and HEATHER ANGEL, as the two daughters of the British colonel (HUGH BECKLER) are not too good. MERLE OBERON was to star in the picture. HENRY WILCOXON, as the major in love with BARNES shows his superior acting abilities. Of course, the sweetest part is that of the heavy (Indian and French spy: two major vices). BRUCE CABOT just looked tough, he didn't have to play the part. He was outstanding as the good guy or the bad guy. He is the character you best remember from KING KONG. Thanks to the loyalty of his old friend JOHN WAYNE, he ended his career with good parts (he had acted with the Duke in ANGEL AND THE BADMAN, a great picture left to inferior transfers in DVD).

For me, it is much more enjoyable than the 1993 Daniel Day Lewis film although that movie was by no means poorly done. I am always impressed by screenplays that successfully present a lot of information and are able to tell the story all in a relatively brief running time. Historical adventures of the 1930s, in American cinema, usually appear as novels come-to-life. The camera angles, costumes, lighting, black and white photography, etc. all come together in a way that suggests illustrations found in book editions of the late 19th and early 20th century. This 1936 version of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is one of these movies, and I highly recommend it as viewing especially during the holiday season.",1132876800,7,799,4.882352941176471

Randolph Scott stars as Hawkeye ,who escorts the stiff but gallant British officer Duncan Heyward and the two daughters of the regimental colonel ,Alice and Cora ,through the woods to Fort William Henry. They are accompanied by Chingachgook and his son Uncas ,sole surviving members of the Mohican tribe ,and are harried constantly by Magwa ,avicuous and depraved Huron who is allied with the French against the British.
On making it to the Fort it is promptly besieged by the Franco-Huron army and the women captured .Once again the heroes must track them down and rescue them from the clutches of the Huron.
The performances are solid -Scott is a rugged hero and Wilcoxon plays Heyward on the just the right note of stiff upper lip gallantry while Bruce Cabot is a menacing and suitably thuggish villain
Shot in the High Sierras by the cinematographer Robert Planck the movie looks good and moves crisply with some lively scenes of siege and woodland combat
The script intelligently anticipates the war of Independence -a little over a decade away -by emphasising the desire of the ""colonials""for self determination in miltary matters .
