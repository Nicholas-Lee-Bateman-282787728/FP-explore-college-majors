3596219,5,B001G5SDHU,"With vacation funds and time so scarce, and the multitude of places I want to see in my lifetime, autumn time in New England is not even close to the top of my list for destinations. Despite this fact, it remains a visual experience I wish I could see in person someday.

This dvd makes it possible, and provides a variety of views of the area that make the experience all it can be without the expense of going there.

Living Landscape titles are well produced, having stunning visuals and great music to accompany the scenery. Future titles are planned, and my one hope is that the producers will add an option to have nature sounds only in addition to the delightful mucial soundtracks.

Keep 'em coming!

3596220,1,B001G5SDHU,"I was disappointed with this video.  It was not what I expected.  The scenes were indeed great and the music was OK but I was expecting a lot more composition as far as barns, churches, views of small towns etc.  On the back cover it states that it has content from Me, VT, NH and Ma.  While watching the video you have no idea of where these scenes were shot.  They should have included captions on the locations of where these places are.  The waterfall was a gorgeous location, but where is it?

If you are interested in only leaves, ponds and waterfalls then you'll like this video.  If you're looking for more than this, then you'll probably be disappointed.",1232150400,17,663,4.466666666666667
3596221,5,B001G5SDHU,Had the video playing while family was over for Thanksgiving.  Wonderful comments about the beautiful scenery.,1228089600,4,110,5.875
3596242,5,B001G5SDHU,I gave this five stars because it is full of beautiful scenery and relaxing music. It was perfect for what we needed,1388707200,,116,4.318181818181818
3596243,5,B001G5SDHU,"I love the Living Landscapes: Earthscapes series.  After reading other reviews, I was a little hesitant that this would be sub-par to other Blu-Rays in the series, but it was right on track.  I watch each disc in the series (that I own) nature sounds only in continuous loop.  This disc allowed me to do both.  The images were crisp as you would expect on a Blu-Ray and the scenes were tranquil and moved at a familiar rate to those who have other discs in the series. If you like the Sunrise Earth series, you will most likely like this series, as well.",1346284800,3,554,4.349514563106796
3596244,5,B001G5SDHU,"Beautiful fall scenery, lovely music in the background, trickling water, leaves floating in the wind, gorgeous autumn colors, a very engrossing experience that is peaceful and relaxing. I sometimes get up and put this on the TV during the night if I can't sleep, and even if I don't sleep, I feel rested. I had it on the TV one time during the day when my husband was home and he even liked it, which is rather unusual for him - as there are no guns, no motorcycles and nothing blows up during the entire DVD. I've seen other Living Landscapes and they are all just as beautiful. Highly recommended.",1319846400,3,599,4.454545454545454
3596245,5,B001G5SDHU,"I'm a little surprised by some of the other ratings. I had the DVD version last year and just switched over to Blu-ray (definitely worth it). It's stunning. Autumn is my favorite season, and I keep it running nearly all day - talk about relaxing. You will see falling leaves, forests, rivers, waterfalls, lakes (all combined with foliage) and misty hills, as well as vibrant yellow foliage against a dazzling blue sky. I love the different shots in several types of lighting. I also love the barns and churches - it has everything you'd want to see. A few scenes looks like they may have been shot just a hair past peak, but are gorgeous none the less. I've seen this disc hundreds of times, but am still surprised by a scene I didn't notice before. It's positively hypnotic. The colors and contrast are both vivid, and it was cut quite well. The scenes are held the perfect amount of time (in my humble opinion), and the music is soothing without completely taking over the visuals. I instantly feel calm while watching it, and I have 5 children, so that's saying a lot. This, as well as a couple of snow Blu-rays (also purchased on Amazon) are my favorite things to put in my BD player.",1314230400,5,1188,4.50462962962963
3596246,4,B001G5SDHU,"I've lived in Boston, MA most of my life and moved to texas for the past 6 where there is no 4 seasons.  This may not he the best and there may of been many other areas he could of gone for images but this works good for me considering fall is coming and i won't see any of this down here.  Its good therapy for me I will be watching this as often as possible. I will purchase the 4 season one next to see some snow.",1284681600,,416,3.715909090909091
3596247,5,B001G5SDHU,An interesting landscape photography of New England in the fall.  The scenes were well selected and varied.,1278633600,,107,5.294117647058823
3596248,1,B001G5SDHU,"I was hoping for something serene and peaceful that I could leave on in the background while I was writing.  Instead, this piece is cut like a bad music video!  For the subject matter it's practically hyperkinetic!  I have to wonder what ADD film school dropout assembled this.  Cut cut cut!  Maybe we could settle on a shot and let it breathe a minute before another cut, huh???  Instead of buying this here, check my local Goodwill.  Mine will soon be on sale there.",1267574400,6,468,4.5
3596249,3,B001G5SDHU,"I grew up in and traveled in New England for 20 years.  I have relocated to the Left Coast and wanted to have some video of the vibrant colors of the New England Fall that I remembered.  This is NOT what I remember, nor is it anything like a travel brochure would promote.  Although technically very good high definition picture and with nice sound there were very few scenes that actually capture the vibrancy of a New England Fall.  I wonder if they just couldn't sell these photos elsewhere....",1258156800,2,497,4.550561797752809
3596250,1,B001G5SDHU,The Worst pos I've ever seen.  There's only a few scenes repeated over and over again.  It's extremely SLOW AND BORING.  There are so much more in New England than what this shows. DO NOT BUY IT,1243123200,6,194,4.1891891891891895
3596251,3,B001G5SDHU,"I rated this video 3 stars, possibly because I expected to see much more vivid colors.  The colors were not very vivid with hardly any reds.  I think the video was well done though.  I played it with the music.  The music was very pleasing, though I thought it might be a little less prominent with the nature sounds a little more so.  I only paid $9 for it and I think it was certainly worth that and I am sure I will watch it again sometime.",1240012800,9,443,4.045977011494253

8303982,5,B001G5SDHU,Great DVD,1483574400,,9,4.0
8303983,5,B001G5SDHU,"I love it!!!  These are natural scenes of the beauty of fall in the countryside.  There are scenes with colors of trees from green pine through yellow and orange to red.  Some scenes of small creeks and lakes with geese or ducks.  There are close ups of colored leaves and mushrooms.  Some scenes are sunny, some are more cloudy, one scene with clouds and mist swirling with what appears to be a hawk passing by.  There are two sound tracks, one is a tranquil piano, and the other is my favorite - the natural sounds of water, chirping birds, the geese and ducks on their lakes.",1444694400,2,578,4.40566037735849

8303985,1,B001G5SDHU,"Very poor.
If I've not been in New England in the fall, I would not be convinced with that
It's a poor image of the marvel we can find",1436313600,,134,3.6551724137931036
8303986,4,B001G5SDHU,Very relaxing.,1423267200,,14,6.5
8303987,5,B001G5SDHU,"Outstanding.  Relaxing, scenic video.  I have seen prior reviews complaining about lack of location specifics or narration.  Get a National Geographic or Travel video if that is what you are looking for.  For me, I wanted a great alternative to my TV looking like a black rectangle on the wall.",1422316800,,294,4.82
8303988,5,B001G5SDHU,"Relaxing, pleasant to watch and listen to.",1416700800,,42,5.142857142857143
8303989,5,B001G5SDHU,the quality of the images is outstanding! this video does move slow compared to a video like over America and does focus in on a leaf or a single tree from time to time. I have many of these kinds of videos and this is probably my favorite one that is of the slower moving variety.,1410652800,,281,4.035714285714286
8303990,5,B001G5SDHU,I love the scenery in this HD Blu ray. I reminds me of the times when I lived in New England. Recommended as a live picture to create a nice atmosphere at home.,1388707200,,160,3.878787878787879
