3913868,3,B002DY9KSE,"I've enjoyed this series since it came out, so when I came across the closing theme (Waltz by Suneohair) in my music collection I thought I'd see about buying it. The problem was that no information was given about languages so I thought I'd get one episode to try it out and sure enough it was dubbed in English.

The problem with that is that generally English voice actors are really, really bad compared to the original Japanese actors. They tend to sound wooden, and it grates in a way that the complete original production doesn't. I wouldn't mind if the files were dual audio with a subtitle option (two sets, one for the English dub and another for the original Japanese), AND IF THE FILES WERE PLAYABLE SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN THE PROPRIETARY AMAZON SYSTEM WITH ITS ABSURD DEFAULT SETTINGS, but none of those are options so I most certainly won't be buying the remaining episodes in this format.

So in the end I'd give five stars to the series - plot, characters, music, animation, (original) acting: all A+ - but I'd give one star for the formatting issues, so it averages out to three stars.",1318204800,7,1100,4.607142857142857
3913869,5,B002DY9KSE,"This anime is a must-see. I'm 15 years old and eventhough i'm still a teenager, i enjoy this anime as much as those 20+ do, simply because it's a truly meaningful anime. It's also somewhat cute in its own way. Mostly, the anime bases on real-life situation and circumstances. The way the characters deal with their struggles in life reflects how human emotions work. It's full of monolouges that help the viewer understand the characters better, as well as themselves. This anime is one of the best i've ever seen. It's realistic, plain, and very funny at the same time. I definitely recommend this to you. Enjoy watching it.",1297468800,2,625,4.743119266055046
3913870,5,B002DY9KSE,"The pop culture vibe of ""Honey and Clover"" remains unforgettable, even as their favorite characters move away from each other.

The plot revolves around five college art student friends. Three young men and two women. One woman is actually a girl, if you want to go into details. However, the anime follows each character's romantic struggles as the person faces sudden changes in her/his life.

Two story arcs resonate with immense passion and emotion. The first arc focuses on the philosophical senior Takumi Mayama and Ayumi Yamada. Ayumi can't stop loving Mayama, even as her best friend visits the other girlfriend whom he works with. Somehow, these two characters pull off a delicate balancing act of emotions and romance, even though they may never stay together as a couple.

The second story is a love triangle between the young Hagumi Hanamoto, the sophomore Yuta Takemoto and the money-making slacker student Shinobu Morita. The romance opens as a warm friendship, but Morita faces a compelling decision near the end to either make more money or stay with little Hagu.

Even though the story takes melancholy twists and turns, the series retains a hyper pace of comedy at certain moments. The fan-favorite sequence involves two of the guys playing a grueling game of Twister. They literally hurt themselves to the point of disbelief, with bone-crunching sounds off-screen and shocked faces of agony.

But whether anyone actually believes that Morita's room is a high-tech computer room, the story resonates for its tale of long-distance relationships and love that may never come true. ""Honey and Clover"" is a story about college students who form a family of never-ending friendship, even as their romantic relationships tear them apart.",1265155200,,1749,5.166077738515901
3913871,5,B002DY9KSE,"Charming, beautiful, realistic and enjoyable... There are definitely a lot of positive things you can say about the anime adaptation of the Kodansha Award winning manga series by Chika Umino.

Having spawned a live Japanese drama and film, ""Honey and Clover"" has been a popular series that attracts both guys and girls as the story focuses on life and love from the perspective of both sides of the sexes.  I was hooked by the manga series from volume 1 and enjoyed the film despite its different interpretation. But I have always been curious about the anime adaptation and now the first box set consisting of the first 12 episodes + a bonus episode is now available in the US courtesy of Viz Media.  In Japan, a total of two seasons (48 episodes) have aired.

In 2005, ""honey and clover"" was turned into an anime series courtesy of Director Kenichi Kasai (""Nodame Cantabile"", ""Gokudo"", ""His and Her Circumstances"") and a screenplay by Yousuke Kuroda (""Big Windup!"", ""Excel Saga"", ""Gungrave"", ""Infinite Ryvius"").  The series features music by Yuzo Hayashi (""Sailor Moon"" series), character designs by  Shuichi Shimamura (""Saber Marionette"", ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"", ""Green Legend Ran"") and anime production by J.C. Staff.

""honey and clover"" focuses on five students who attend an art college and the focuses on their persona lives, their friendships within several years and how they evolve in school to eventually planning a career.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""honey and clover"" is featured in 169 widescreen and although the show is a television series, the artistic backgrounds, surround buildings are very well-painted and detailed.  The character designs are true to Chica Umino's manga character designs and for the most part, character designer Shuichi Shimamura stayed true to her designs.  Animation is fun and colorful and for those who are familiar with the manga series can definitely appreciation the overall presentation of the anime series.  Very well-done.

Audio is presented in Stereo and featured in English and Japanese.  Both the Japanese and English voice dub are both are very well-done.  In terms of audio quality, the series is front channel driven but I chose to set my receiver with stereo on all channels.  But dialogue is clear and understandable.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I really enjoyed this first box set of ""Honey and Clover"".  I figured with so many situations from the manga series, how were they going to capture the essence of Chica Umino's characters and storyline in an anime.  But for the most part, the staff succeeded in covering the most essential parts of the series.  The jokes, the the angst, the emotions....everything hilarious and dramatic was caught and those integral scenes were featured on the anime series.

Similar to popular Japanese dramas such as ""Asunaro Hakusho"", ""Wakamono no Subete"" or ""Hakusen Nagashi"", I really enjoy stories that cover young adult life. From the parties to just hanging out with friends, meeting new people, career choices to finding love (or not finding love), ""honey and clover"" is one of those series that is realistic in the sense that many people can related to these characters. So, you really take an interest towards the characters and I really liked the overall development of the characters through the course of the nine chapters.

Umino's artwork and her storytelling is enjoyable, beautiful and has a good balance of entertainment through humor and that occasional love triangle drama that pulls you in.  So, I was curious to see how much character designer Shuichi Shimamura can keep that quality and remain faithful to Umino's work.  Sure enough, he and the crew succeeded.  Artwork is absolutely beautiful as the painted backgrounds capture the detail of the wooden home where the guys live in.  Buildings, lush scenery, colorful skies, you name it...""honey and clover"" is just beautiful to look at and as mentioned earlier, voice acting in Japanese and in English are quite solid.

This is one of those anime series that will appeal appeals to both men and women courtesy of the main characters and we get to see things in each of their perspective throughout the series.  If anything, the episodes are dramatic but the series doesn't take itself too seriously as you have the weird Morita, Hagu's overall young look and Ayumi's short temper helping to calm down storylines that can easily get too emotional and thus keeping the overall series lighthearted and fun.

Overall, being a big fan of the manga series, ""honey and clover Box 1' is a magnificent anime release thus far.  For those looking for an anime series focusing on young adult drama, real-life situations in relationships and college and more, give ""honey and clover"" a try.  You'll definitely enjoy this anime series.  Highly recommended!",1258502400,16,8110,4.807831762146483
3913872,5,B002DY9KSE,"This is not just another anime where romantic cliches litter the storyline. If you know artist Umino Chica, she's that one artist whose style creates a lasting imprint in your memories. Not only are her characters unique in their own way (i.e. Morita and his insane notions and humor, for example), each has his or her own story to tell. Each character's relationship with the others develop through a complicated storyline, some developing from friendships into something more. In the end, you're left with wondering about how each of them will live their lives in the future.

Honey and Clover is probably one of the most realistic, down-to-earth animes out there. Unlike other shoujo comics such as Nana or Fruits Basket, Honey and Clover shines with a deeply moving, pure and innocent plot. The viewer themselves can relate to the characters easily, allowing them to fully enjoy this series. After watching the anime, it is only right to pick up a copy of the manga in order to relive those carefree college days.

Perhaps some may say that the flaw of this anime is that the interacting environment seems too perfect. College life, as we know it, really IS perfect in the sense that there is no true society to deal with. College is, in and of itself, a mini-society. This anime portrays the relationships between several friends as they live their lives through the few years in post-secondary school and, in the end, fly beyond the classrooms.

A must-watch and a must-read, Honey and Clover deserves to be watched (and rewatched) over and over again.",1255046400,,1558,4.849624060150376
3913873,4,B002DY9KSE,"Most anime is aimed at either a teenage or preteen audience.  Honey and Clover is a rare anime targeted at adult women that guys should also enjoy - indeed, it will be appreciated most by those who have completed at least a year of college.

Our narrator is Yuta Takemoto, a sensitive young man slogging his way through his second year at a visual arts college as the series begins.  Under the guidance of his favorite professor at the school, Shuji Hanamoto, Yuta makes his way along with his friends:  his fellow architectural student Takumi Mayama, who's fallen in love with the young widow of Shuji's best friend; potter Ayumi Yamada, who in turn is in unrequieted love with Takumi; very eccentric computer graphics designer Shinobu Morita and, finally, Shuji's little cousin Hagumi ""Hagu"" Hanamoto - a painter/sculptor who will have a profound effect on both Yuta and Shinobu.

There are a few problems with the two female leads - Ayumi often becomes the dispenser of traditional anime slapstick humor, and more importantly a great chance to realistically depict life for short people is lost on Hagu, who has a disturbing lack of self-reliance with a somewhat shaky explanation.  But for the most part, Honey and Clover brilliantly covers almost all aspects of college life, from freshmen experiencing their first bouts of homesickness to seniors stressing over finding their first jobs and everything in between - like learning how to handle alcohol without adult supervision and the dejection of often living on ramen and working your tail off to pay your dues without any financial reward yet.  There are also some very humorous moments - especially a notorious game of Twister that will probably leap to the top 10 funniest list of many.

There are precious few josei anime in the North American market.  Honey and Clover is generally considered one of the best, and if josei is your demographic, it belongs in your collection.",1254787200,4,1937,4.935384615384615
3913874,5,B002DY9KSE,"Honey and Clover is very special.  It's one of those series that doesn't come around very often and when it does it fills you with warmth and nostalgia.  First off the characters are loveable and realistic, my favorite being Morita haha.  I just love everything about this show, it takes me back to my early college years when life on your own was new and mysterious.  This is just a great heart-warming shoujo anime that I would recommend to all girl anime fans!  Also the soundtrack is amazing~",1253750400,,496,4.590909090909091
3913875,5,B002DY9KSE,"Honey & Clover follows the lives of five students studying at an art college in Tokyo. The series follows their lives through their college years as they fall in love, find their first jobs, and question their purpose in life. I guess you can say that Honey and Clover is extraordinarily ordinary. Although in many ways that is what makes this series so special. If you were ever a college student (art college or otherwise) you will find it very easy to relate to the story Honey & Clover is telling.

The characters in Honey & Clover can be a bit quirky and eccentric yet they still all seem very real. It is especially easy to relate to the main protagonist Takemoto who is probably the most ordinary of the bunch and a perfect representation of an average college student.

Honey & Clover also boasts a great soundtrack with insert songs from Spitz & Suga Shikao used throughout the series. The art & character designs have a dreamlike and water color effect. Special notice should also be given to the opening sequence which uses stop motion animation & food for a very unique and memorable effect.

To conclude Honey and Clover is sometimes hilarious, sometimes it is sad. In that way it reflects the ups and downs of real life. If you are looking for an anime series that is intelligent, thoughtful & sincere I cannot recommend this one enough.",1252540800,12,1351,4.620833333333334

8366327,5,B002DY9KSE,Great beginning to a great series that provided us with hours of fun entertainment.  The seller sent exactly what was promised in a timely fashion.  At times the series brought back memories of our university drama days as well as the humour of always being hungry!  Good to know that university days seem to be the same no matter what country you grew up in.  A good mix of humour and serious dramatic moments.  This first disc has more hour that the last disc of the series.  That's what they get for growing up.,1395792000,,514,4.414893617021277
8366328,3,B002DY9KSE,"MY RATING IS JUST ABOUT THIS RELEASE, NOT ANIME ITSELF, READ BELOW PLS!

There are a lot of reviews describing how great this anime is and I personally think that this is the best anime I've ever seen. But I want to say a few words about this DVD-release and specifically about subtitles. I prefer watching anime with original japanese audio and subtitles, so its quality means a lot to me. And this is where it fails: generally subs are good, but the way they replace traditional japanese adressing with just names completely ruins the mood. Especially when you hear ""Morita-san"" and read just Shinobu - this completely freaks you out. I wonder if the translators have any idea that the way you adress a person means A LOT in japanese culture, like everyone adresses Yamada Ayumi as ""Yamada-san"", but her close friend or parents calls her just ""Ayu"" and etc. I've been waiting to get this release for a few years and this is such a disappointment. Someone may say this is retarded, but in my opinion the fail made by translators is much more retarded.

But still, if you want to watch a great anime about life and friendship you should get this. A real gem.",1386547200,14,1158,4.5625
8366329,3,B002DY9KSE,"This is based on the manga Honey and Clover. The anime is a romantic comedy about a group of art school students trying to find their way in life. A few love triangles even develop.

The whole show (all box sets) of Honey and Clover was okay. I've watched lot's of anime and it is still my least favorite. The artwork is average and different compared to other anime. It's slow-paced and there are parts that were too boring to keep my attention. I could relate to a few of the characters and life situations, but this show is just something to pass the time when bored. I doubt I'll ever watch it again.",1384560000,,604,4.298245614035087

8366332,5,B002DY9KSE,I loved Honey and Clover. It is a real life college drama. It is centered around 5 art students. It follows them through freshman year to graduation. The animation in this series is one of a kind. I've never seen an anime that was animated like this. All of the characters are very compelling and unique. The drama and comedy is amazing as well. I fell in love with this series from the minute I started watching it. If you like anime You can't miss it.,1350345600,,453,4.27906976744186
8366333,4,B002DY9KSE,"If you like this anime, you will love Eden of the East since the character designer, director, music composer and many of the original voices follow on the other anime. I started watching eden first and then went back to watch this and its funny how the artist decided to use some of the characters from this anime in the other one. Once you watch the two, you will instantly know what I am talking about and recognize Takizawa, the guy with glasses, and Mr. Outsider. But Eden of the east is far better in every way, I think it shows how much the skills of the creators has evolved from Honey Clover. My only gripe with this is WTF were they thinking when they added that little 6 year old girl as a love interest for that guy. I don't care how old you say she is, this was done on purpose due to the perverted mind of many japanese anime creators. I hate it when they do that.",1325894400,,878,4.170588235294118
