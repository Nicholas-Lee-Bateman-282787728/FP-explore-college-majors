8351060,5,B0025G97AQ,"This 2008 British 5-part miniseries of THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK succeeds on so many levels.  There is a primal reason why we need to hear this story time after time, and yet hope that we can somehow change the ending...

Anne Frank's wartime diary gave a poignant face to the Holocaust, an event unparalled in the annals of human cruelty.  Deborah Moggach (the writer of the Keira Knightley version of PRIDE & PREJUDICE) casts a fresh eye over the original material, stripping away any possible shred of melodrama to reveal even more raw human emotion than seen in other versions of the story.

And newcomer Ellie Kendrick is nothing short of a revelation as Anne.  Looking eerily like the real Anne at times, Kendrick brings her vividly to life with all the angst, fear, rage and humour that the role requires.  The rest of the cast follows suit.  I was especially surprised by how good Iain Glen and Tamsin Greig were as Anne's parents.  There's a heartbreaking scene between Anne and her father--missing from other versions of the story--which had me absolutely floored.

It seems that each version of the story brings us closer and closer to the essence of the real Anne.  This latest version is refreshing and raw in it's depiction of one of the most fascinating chapters in modern history.

Bonus features include ""Rutka: A Diary of the Holocaust"" which introduces audiences to Rutka Laskier, a fourteen-year-old Holocaust victim whose own diary--written in the Polish ghetto of Bdzin--was only discovered and published in 2006.",1242259200,10,1533,4.903100775193798
