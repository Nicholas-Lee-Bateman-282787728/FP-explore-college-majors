2523058,4,B000EMGJAY,"While this set doesn't have all the Marilyn Monroe movies, it is a good set to have.  Marilyn is beautiful in all of the enclosed movies.  She acted various parts and did so in different ways.  This set is a good start for anyone beginning a Monroe collection!",1168300800,8,260,4.375
2523059,5,B000EMGJAY,"I bought this DVD set for my father for his birthday. He just turned 83 years old and he absolutely have always adored Marilyn Monroe and he was so thrilled when he got the set and he said the color on the DVD cover was absolutely beautiful and he (my parents and I are deaf) was happy that the movies was subtitled and he was able to fully understand everything which in back of old days, the movies were not captioned and he would just guess what the stories were about but now he does not have to play guess anymore.",1168300800,5,519,4.148514851485149

2523062,4,B000EMGJAY,"While the films are a great choice and the prints are in great shape, how about some commentaries, deleted scenes, featurettes.  Except for  SEVEN YEAR ITCH, there is nothing.  Marilyn made so few films, only 12 starring roles, as compared to other superstars who've made dozens, I wish there were more to each movie...expecially deleted scenes.  I know every one of these film had deletions, but no one has ever said WHAT WAS DELETED.  In the case of NIAGARA, much must have been deleted because it seems so choppy. Never sure what day is when.  In BLONDES, the first part of the movie also seems a bit disjointed, and one night moves into the next without explanation.  I know Mr. Zanack was a stickler for short films and he cut his films a bit too much.  So when and if new materials are found and put in these films, I won't be buying any more of them.",1165881600,6,857,4.414012738853503
2523063,5,B000EMGJAY,"If you own the orignal Diamond Collection sets this set may not be for you, but I sold off my originals and purchased this set based on the fact the covers of each DVD feature the Original Poster Artwork for the films not just a giant pic of Marilyn herself. Hopefully FOX will release another set fewturing How to Marry a Millionaire and Don't Come Knocking as well as many others in the FOX/MONROE Cannon.",1149465600,31,407,4.44

2523087,5,B000EMGJAY,I did not appreciate Marilyn Monroe's talent until she had already passed on. But now I can see what a great actress she was and I was glad to get so many of her movies in one collection.,1394496000,,187,3.9473684210526314

2523089,5,B000EMGJAY,"MM was a little more mature here and wasn't so much of a sex kitten, but you really saw her acting skills. What I love too was in those days women had a little stomach and not so toned arms and it was ok. Don't get me wrong, I love toned arms, but it was nice to see Hollywood did not have an obsession with rail thin stars. Love the chemistry between her and Yves too.",1393632000,,369,3.8684210526315788

2523095,5,B000EMGJAY,This movie show the versatility of a great actress. I still love her work. She was so unappreciated when alive.,1371772800,,111,4.6

2523098,3,B000EMGJAY,the 5 dvds were superb. and i enjoyed watching them and have a better understanding of mm's and how she rose to fame from being in foster homes by marrying rich men.,1357084800,,165,4.1875
2523099,5,B000EMGJAY,Marilyn Monroe has always been a good actress. I liked her movies not only because of her beauty but her innocent personality that she had. As soon as she walked or came into the scene you knew that beauty had entered the room. I liked this video because it has the quality of good wholsome viewing that you just don't find in movies today without all the violence to make a movie sell. Nonetheless I can watch this movie over and over with its comedic overtures.,1356134400,,463,4.395348837209302
2523100,5,B000EMGJAY,My friend decided he wanted to start a Marilyn collection so I got this for him last year for christmas.  He loved the set as his starter movies.,1355616000,,145,4.178571428571429
2523101,2,B000EMGJAY,This is not one of MM's best movies. She's still gorgeous but not in her best shape. Jack Cole does what he can with choreography however chorus boys merely haul her around. Co-star Yves Montand is stiff and unattractive and his accent makes him unintelligible. Their chemistry level is zero. It's a dumb script with not much for the actors to do.,1351728000,,347,4.612903225806452
2523102,2,B000EMGJAY,"So I hadn't have time to write a review intill now. When the package came I was happy that it came early. Then I opened the the box and the Collection box was ripped and had dashes on it. Then i open that and pulled out all six of the DVD cases and Two of them are from different collections (Marilyn Monroe: The Diamond Collection) To be exacted. So they were messed match. And some came with the dvd slip and some didn't. I'm not happy with the fact that they said it was ""like New"" Wich clearly it wasn't. I would never buy anything from theses people after this. The Dvds work good. thats the only reason why i'm giving it two stars.",1350432000,,637,4.145161290322581

2523104,5,B000EMGJAY,"This collection contains five of Marilyn Monroe's films and one two-hour long documentary on her final days. Of the best in the collection, I enjoy all of the them, excluding ""Let's Make Love"" (1960).

MY RATINGS ON THE MOVIES
1) ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (1953)
2) ""River of No Return"" (1954)
3) ""The Seven Year Itch"" (1955)
4) ""Niagara"" (1953)
5) ""MM: The Final Days"" (?-1996-?)
6) ""Let's Make Love"" (1960)

In my opinion this is one of the best Monroe's best film collections. ""Marilyn Monroe: The Priemere Collection"" is considerably better because it contains far more movies from earlier in her career.",1347926400,,609,4.96078431372549

2523114,5,B000EMGJAY,"An avid collector of all things Marilyn Monroe, I knew that I had to own this box set the moment I laid eyes on it. All of the DVD covers showcase the each film's original artwork. Very reasonable price for 6 films. Marilyn fans will rejoice.",1313971200,,242,4.282608695652174
2523115,5,B000EMGJAY,Isn't it about time the entire MM library of movies be re-mastered and released in BLU Ray?  Set aside studio greed.  Put together the entire collection in one great package.  Make it affordable. Re-master the movies in their original theatrical wide-screen versions. (No George Lucas treatment - Please!)  Don't forget to include the English sub-titles!  Imagine the possible extras that could be included.  Sign me up and long live the Goddess of the Big Screen! PS: Write your congressmen/women and have Marilyn Monroe declared a National Treasure.,1299628800,3,551,5.275862068965517
2523116,5,B000EMGJAY,I ordered this a little late and there wasn't an option for expedite sjipping. Estimated delivery was from Dec 27th to Jan 11th... and I had to go abroad on Jan 1st. Got it Dec 23rd. Can't describe how happy I am right now. THANKS!!!!,1293062400,,234,4.222222222222222
2523117,5,B000EMGJAY,"This is the last complete performance on film of Marilyn and I have to say that she(as usual) is stunning! Her performance is on the money and, she even dares comparison to Mary Martin by performing ""My Heart Belongs To Daddy"" in her own way which is something to see! I recommend this one highly as it comes on the success of her smash hit,""Some Like It Hot""",1270857600,2,359,4.294117647058823

2523119,5,B000EMGJAY,I purchased this video set as a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law.  She was very pleased with it!  This is a perfect gift for the Marilyn Monroe fan in your life!,1265328000,2,166,4.32258064516129
2523120,5,B000EMGJAY,I got this for my fiance as a Christmas gift because I knew that she loves Marilyn Monroe. She was completely shocked to see it and thought it was an amazing gift. I recommend this to anyone who is a big Monroe fan or knows n e one who is,1264982400,,238,3.78
2523121,5,B000EMGJAY,"Well, this is by no means the definitive Marilyn Monroe Collection, but represents just the highlight movies of her career as an actress.
One should also own ""Bus Stop"", ""How to Marry a Millionaire"", ""Monkey Business"", ""Don't Bother to Knock"", ""O'Henry's Full House"", ""Asphalt Jungle"" and ""The Misfits"", in order to have a somewhat complete picture of her movie career.

But if one wants to start somewhere, this is the Basic Marilyn Monroe Collection, starting in order with ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"", a very funny and
successful Comedy, followed by ""Niagara"", a romantic thriller, ""River of No Return"", also starring Robert Mitchum in a very interesting Western (in which Marilyn seems to be far more herself in a natural part and not so stereotyped as usual), ""The Seven Year Itch"", the iconic comedy which actually made
Marilyn into a myth and one of the last movies, ""Let's Make Love"", with French actor/singer Yves Montand at her side, which can be considered a lukewarm and pale example of unsuccessful comedy, attempting to revive her career.

In addition to these, comes a feature long documentary about her ""Final Days"", which includes, toward the end, the reconstructed and alas, truncated (due to her premature death) final movie in which Marilyn was supposed to appear, opposite Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse, called ""Something Got to Give"".
A true rarity and a unique document in time.

All the copies are special Anniversary editions, which also appeared earlier in different boxed sets, which means that they all received a digital remastering of picture elements and a full digital transfer on DVD.
The sound is on all, and where possible, either in Stereo or Surround and this has been achieved with a very accurate remastering, giving by now, the best audio quality possible.

I call it an excellent package and deal for this price.

A must, for all those who remember Marilyn with fondness and respect.",1252713600,11,1922,5.031446540880503
2523122,5,B000EMGJAY,"After reading several Marilyn (Norma Jeane) bio's, I HAD to watch the movies mentioned in the books. I am so glad that I bought this set! I, especially, liked The River of No Return, since I think it was one of her best performances. (I've read that her part in the movie was written with her in mind.)

And of course, who can ever forget Gentlemen Prefer Blondes? This movie is said to have earned over $12 million dollars in its initial run.

This is a MUST HAVE collection for MM fans!",1248048000,,488,4.293478260869565

2523124,4,B000EMGJAY,Good selection of Monroe's films. Just wish there were more movies included in this collection.,1241395200,,95,5.4
2523125,4,B000EMGJAY,"Hot on the heels of her smashing success in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SOME-LIKE-IT-HOT/dp/B00005A06N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SOME LIKE IT HOT</a>&nbsp;(1959), Marilyn Monroe's final ""glamor girl"" film LET'S MAKE LOVE turned out to be a surprising failure. Surprising that is until we examine the whys and wherefores.

Right at the outset, Monroe, who was slated to appear opposite Gregory Peck, demanded rewrites. During these star-imposed delays, Peck encountered other obligations and he bowed out of the production. Next, several leading men flatly turned the film down, including Jimmy Stewart, Chuck Heston, Bill Holden, Yul Brynner, Rock Hudson and Cary Grant. When director George Cukor suggested to Marilyn that they hire the unknown-in-America Yves Montand, she happily agreed with the choice. This was almost the last time star and director would work together harmoniously-- they never even spoke to each other while filming.

Sadly, Monroe's dual addictions to alcohol and barbiturates are both plainly evident in the finished work. In some scenes she's obviously glassy-eyed and dull-witted; in others so bloated as to appear 20 lbs. heavier than in the previous shot. Her talent remained intact though: MM's performance of Cole Porter's ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"" remains among her very best, while a warm on-screen rapport with both Montand and Frankie Vaughan seems genuine.

The English-born Vaughan was a popular crooner in his native land but never caught on in America. A pity, for he had a marvelous voice-- similar to Tony Bennett's, a bit rougher perhaps but with more power and clarity. His rendition of ""Incurably Romantic"" on SONY's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LET-S-MAKE-LOVE/dp/B00009KU82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LET'S MAKE LOVE</a>&nbsp;soundtrack CD is strikingly beautiful. (This entire album is highly recommended, for it contains complete true stereo takes of songs heard only partially in the film.)

MOVIE SYNOPSIS--
Billionaire Jean-Marc Clement (Montand) learns he's to be spoofed in an off-Broadway show, so he goes to the rehearsals where he's mistakenly hired to play himself. After seeing her perform ""Daddy,"" Clement falls hard for star Amanda Dell (Monroe), and to impress her (and win the lady's heart) Jean-Marc hires three famous performers to teach him how to tell jokes, sing and dance. Amanda does eventually warm up to this supposedly struggling bit player. When he finally admits the truth to her, Jean-Marc cannot get Amanda to believe he really IS the fabulously wealthy industrialist.

""Let's Make Love"" is a pleasant story draped around several wonderful numbers that's far better than first-run audiences gave it credit for.  (TRIVIA: The Elvis-clone is played by ""King of the Surf Guitar,"" Dick Dale.)

2523126,5,B000EMGJAY,"This movie set was a gift for my daughter. It had several movies that she did not have and made a perfect surprise! It was packaged very well, arrived in excellent condition and was exactly what I ordered. Thanks!",1224892800,,213,4.487179487179487
2523127,1,B000EMGJAY,"I was so excited to receive this collection.  I watch Niagara right away.  The next day I put in Marilyn, the final days and the excitement was gone.  The movie skipped and froze throughout the ENTIRE dvd.  I thought I bought this new not used?",1213488000,2,244,4.355555555555555
2523128,5,B000EMGJAY,"I was so interested in NormaJeane and her psychological background. I read most of the major autobiographies. I do think this woman was driven. I think she made some bad decisions choosing a lifestyle which including drugs. In her days they did not know long term effects of any drug much less barbiturates. Certainly her alcohol use with the drugs truely made her Hollywood's child. I found her a mass of conflicting impulses. She never really bonded to the classical female role. Early in her life she did, until ambition won. She was extravagently beautiful. She could not nuture female relationships, probably due to her mother's dismal contributions to her upbringing. These movies reflect what she became. What she had strived for all her life. I enjoyed them because of her true talent and remarkable beauty. I was too young when they were released.",1212969600,2,856,4.951388888888889
2523129,4,B000EMGJAY,"The movie set arrived earlier than expected and it was in great condition, none of the disks were scratched and the box was nice.  Overall, this was a good buy, and I would buy from this person again.",1208822400,,200,4.2631578947368425
2523130,5,B000EMGJAY,Things I did not  know about Marylyn. Love her movies. They do tell a story about her real life.,1202428800,,96,4.052631578947368
2523131,4,B000EMGJAY,"As of yet, I have only watched 3 of the films in this set: The Seven Year Itch, River of No Return, and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The other films appear to be some of the best from her filmography, and I'm assuming that most people interested in her will know the films anyway. I'll thus skip the movie reviews.

The Packaging is basically what I assumed it would be: A sturdy box that is used to hold 6 DVD movies. The outer case is really nice looking, and it makes for a nice display piece on the shelf.

The individual movies are in regular DVD cases, all with individual artwork (featuring the original poster artwork). They are much nicer looking than DVD cases from the Diamond Collection. The only thing that bothers me is that the screen-captures on the rear-DVD art are in B&W, even though some of the movies are in color.

The picture of the films look much nicer than I'd expect from such old movies. They still have that classic-cinema look - you can tell they're old, but everything is crisp, there's no dust, etc.

My only big complaint is that the DVD's don't seem to have much in the area of bonus materials. The Seven Year Itch is the only one with anything besides restoration comparisons and still galleries. One smaller complaint is that the DVD's (besides River and Final Years) don't have booklets with production info.

Overall, it was well worth the price. My box got a tad dinged in the shipping - Amazon didn't put much padding in the box - but as far as the actual product, it would be a great gift for a film fan.",1197331200,10,1542,4.415492957746479
8111240,5,B000EMGJAY,"This movie was described as boring and a mess by another reviewer. The fact is that the script was written so Ms. Monroe did not know who the main character was for most of the movie, which keeps the two from connecting. This is what makes for the tension and suspense but the reviewer was bored by it. It really is a good movie with good close ups of Ms. Monroe. Quite interesting.",1518825600,,382,4.2465753424657535

8111242,2,B000EMGJAY,"A terrible, boring mess. Monroe and Montand, both ill at ease. The script is both not good enough and not bad enough. There's elements of farce and serious, and rather wise, insights about the world of show business. But none of the elements come off on their own and cohere together. It's a rather sad and exhausted near finale to Monroe's brilliant career.",1508371200,,358,4.698412698412699

8111244,5,B000EMGJAY,"My dvd set arrived today. Was so excited to start watching them. I had several of these movies on vhs but over the years they started showing wear, lines on the screen etc. Very irritating. Anyhow saw this set offered on Amazon at a fantastic price. The quality and clarity are great. So much better than what I had. Would buy again. For all of you Monroe lovers get this set. You won't be sorry. They come in individual boxes that slip into a nice cardboard case. Amazon offers the best of the best!",1504742400,,500,4.329787234042553

8111248,5,B000EMGJAY,"But I love this movie! I have seen it many times over the years and it's still one of my favorites. I always love Marilyn but Yves Montand is absolutely charming and adorable and I actually like his singing. My voice teacher was his coach way back when.
The movie has a real story and brings out the waive in Marilyn.
There are a lot of laughs and I like the comic scenes with Berle, Crosby and Gene Kelly (one f my all time favorites) as the hired pros to help poor Yves.
I've read the negative reviews but Undaunted I give it 5 stars.",1475366400,,536,4.114285714285714
