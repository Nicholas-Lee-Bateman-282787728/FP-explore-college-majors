8249645,5,B0013B1TP0,I watched this video twice. It makes me mad that women are treated so shabbily but that didn't stop me from learning to box.,1214697600,2,124,4.208333333333333
8249646,5,B0013B1TP0,"Every now and then, you hear an amazing story and wonder, How could I not have known about this? This movie is exactly that kind of story. The Golden Gloves women will inspire you in ways you can't imagine until you see them tell their story. If you've ever tried to do something that seemed impossible - or even dreamed about it - you'll relate to these women and the story they have to tell.",1205884800,6,393,4.253333333333333
8249647,4,B0013B1TP0,"GREAT MOVIE!!! Nobody's even heard of this story, it's really inspiring, and loads of cool characters. I mean, a single momma who brings her baby to Madison Square Garden? A sergeant whose the first female fighter in her unit? Everybody's heard of the Golden Gloves, but nobody's heard of the Women's side to the story. This film had me glued to my seat. The politics of it hit home too, that women are under-represented and need a place in the sports hall of fame, but the activism was understated enough to put the emotional drama first. Strongly recommend.",1204156800,4,559,4.714285714285714
