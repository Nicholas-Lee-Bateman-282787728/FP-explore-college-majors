889560,4,6304452845,"Back as a kid I was a real Alan Ladd fan. Here I see him as being a little to ""slick"" as the WWII spy in France and German.
The first incarnation of James Bond American style even before we found out that the Russians had stolen the A-Bomb secrets ( with a lot of English help)? The early part of the film covers a little spy-craft that was interesting. Most of these spies seemed to have died on the job and weren't really very good at it? Actually the women seem to have been the best at it and most effective.",1234656000,,512,4.029411764705882
889561,4,6304452845,"The Office of Strategic Services, or OSS came into existence by Presidential order in June of 1942. This predecessor of the CIA replaced a variety of informal government groups that had no coordination or specific agenda. The OSS's original function was to gather strategic intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Starting in 1943, the OSS trained Nationalist Chinese troops. In the ETO, they managed to infiltrate German-occupied areas of France and even operated in Germany itself. President Truman disbanded the OSS in September '45 but replaced it the following January with the Central Intelligence Group.

889562,5,6304452845,"O.S.S. has long been one of my favorite Alan Ladd films.  As a spy in WWII, he's handsome, strong, intelligent, competent, patriotic, and romantic---what more can you ask?  The cast is excellent, and the plot is complex and suspenseful.

I was a bit nervous about buying a DVD imported from Brazil.  Though the cover art and the DVD's opening screen are written in Portuguese, all that's needed is one click on the language menu to select English instead of Portuguese, and the movie plays exactly as it was filmed, in English.",1221955200,18,527,4.758241758241758

889635,5,6304452845,The film was great Alan Ladd was excellent the film shows how the new USA  spy network the O.S.S was threw the rough train program and some dry test on their on people it also shows what they went threw when they where sent in enemy held country and making risky deals with their enemy counter parts and how one mistake can get people killed.  But of all when Alan Ladd when passing on information that can save many allied lives he's been told that the enemy has taken his female agent and has to make A decision.

889639,4,6304452845,"!!Not a great movie but if you like old 1940's movies and can do without the excessive graphic realism of today's films, you may enjoy O.S.S.  I do not wish to spoil the movie so I will not give details but this is not a typical everybody lives happily ever after 40's film.  I would not call it a great movie at all but if you like espionage movies and films from this time period you may want to give this one a look.",1461024000,3,419,3.9761904761904763
889640,5,6304452845,"Spoilers!  Interesting but episodic tale could have been a pilot for a tv series if made today.  Four agents are dropped by a Hudson over France with orders to blow a railroad tunnel before D-day. Then they are located by a Gestapo man anxious to sell secrets and get in favor with the allies. A B-25 model makes the pink'n'drop.  On the verge of capture when a Hudson arrives to take them back to London, they accept another assignment to contact an embedded spy with information vital to crossing the Rhine.  Another B-25 model circles to receive their radio transmissions. A member of the team is lost with each mission, and Alan Ladd is left to contemplate whether it was all worth while.

Plane and train footage is minimal as the story requires, so watch this for the spy tale aspect.",1450656000,,790,4.574468085106383

889683,5,6304452845,"O. S. S., 1946 film

This story is based on real people and events. It starts in a factory in Baltimore. A man in a suit goes to the Research and Development department to meet someone. A sketch goes missing and Mr. Martin is searched. But he is caught and taken away by the police. Another man comes to take him away in handcuffs and brings him to a mansion. This was part of training exercise! They learn how to use a radio and camera, how to follow a man and check for a tail. The plan is to send agents into France to aid the Resistance (FFI or Free French of the Interior) and sabotage the railroads. [Freight was carried by railroads, the marshaling yards were used to sort out the individual cars. Destroying these crippled transportation.] They recruit an artist, she used to live in France. Next they are in London. We hear explosions outside. Their target is a railroad tunnel.

We hear their cover stories. The team is dropped into France by parachute. The Germans are aware of their airplane and are watching for them. One mans table manners are observed! He gives the danger signal. He won't talk! A radio message arrives in Washington. Elaine DuPr visits a small store and makes contact with a code word. [Note their talk.] She passes on a message, it arrives in Washington. The reply is burned to destroy it. The information is used to supply targets for bombing. Messages are transported by radio. One is broken off when the operator is shot! The team is picked up for questioning and are searched. But nothing is found. Will they get help? Yes, but they have bad luck! They are being followed. Can they shake this tail?

An airplane lands in a field. They are asked for one last job. They are under pressure. Martin must meet Parker to retrieve his information on enemy troop formations. The Allies are nearing the Rhine. Martin cant locate Parker, the dock area is restricted. Martin enters with a pistol but is captured! Parker provides the information to Elaine (he is disguised), she passes it to Martin. Then Colonel Paul Meister arrives to arrest Elaine! Will Martin try to rescue Elaine or send the important message? A circling airplane receives his radio messages on troop locations. He returns to find Elaine gone. [Note the kerosene lantern.] Later American troops advance, helped by the O. S. S,. members. [Information is a force multiplier.]

This drama omits the help from the FFI, who sabotaged railway traffic to help the Normandy invasion. They destroyed telephone lines and forced the German Army to communicate by radio (which was monitored by the Allies, decoded and read). Armed FFI members battled German troops in parts of France as well, but they were lightly armed. One definition of OSS was Overseas Secret Service (Secret Service is the generic name for any counter-intelligence agency). After the war they became the Central Intelligence Agency, a government agency separate from the regular military. The book Operation Jedburgh goes into more details about operations in Occupied France. So does the book Between Silk and Cyanide.",1424908800,,3077,4.810964083175803

889691,5,6304452845,"this is a very good movie~ Alan Ladd is recruited into the OSS ~ the Office of Strategic Services (Pree CIA) and this started the USA in spying behing enemy lines~

This shows how they recruted people who lived in France and trained them with special weapons (a pipe that is a gun) how to use a radio. They also recrute a woman~ who is an artist~! (Gerald Paige) and who lived in France for three years~ now the plan is to blow up a Train Tunnel~ and they accomplish it~ on the LIGHTER SIDE EVEN THE GERMANS HAVE AMERICAN ACCENTS~ MORE THAN AMUSING! The plot takes a bit of a fun twist when they are ""detained"" by a Gestopo Agent for questioning and he turns out to be ""for sale' and offers them secrets, a radio and help escaping for a price~ at ever turn he gives them a ""tally"" of the total they owe him~ more than funny~ Ladd is very good the scene stealer here it the GESTOPO WHO IS FOR SALE~ I GIVE IT A 4 OUT OF 5 FOR SPIES ~ LADD IS NOT AT HIS BEST~ SO 4 STARS~ ONE THE LIGHTER SIDE LADD WAS ONLY ABOUT 5 FEET 7 INCHES TALL AND WORE ""LIFTS IN HIS SHOES"" TO MAKE HIM APPEAR TALLER~ :-)GERALDINE PAGES IS ALSO VERY GOOD AS THE GIRL SPY WHO IS WILLING TO DIE FOR THE CAUSE~",1237507200,,1178,3.970464135021097
