155589,4,0792899768,"Prior to the 1988 release of this powerful biopic, Camille Claudel was but a footnote in history, the almost forgotten sister of the great 19th century French poet Paul Claudel. But since this movie, Paul has been relegated to being known as Camille's brother. Isabelle Adjani dominates the film in the title role as a young sculptor studying with and having a disastrous affair with the great sculptor Rodin. Gerard Depardieu delivers his usual forceful performance as Rodin, but never overshadows Adjani. The central issue of the film is the lack of credit that the woman sculptor receives because of societal prejudice. The script goes so far as to strongely imply that she was the real genius and that Rodin borrowed from her. This angle continues to make the film very popular with the female audience. Although the packaging on this video proclaims that this is ""a historically accurate depiction"", some skepticism is in order. I have visited the Rodin museum in Paris a number of times where sculptures by both Rodin and Claudel are on display. These works make it clear that Rodin did great things before, during, and after his affair with Claudel, whereas Claudel did great work only during her time with Rodin, and relatively mediocre work before and after. The observer is free to come to his own conclusions. In any event, the film is a well-spent two and one half hours, and the Orion video has clear yellow subtitles for those who don't know French.",1018915200,10,1463,4.856
155590,4,0792899768,"Camille Claudel is a must-see. There are various topics in it that make this film interesting: the struggle of women artists of that time; the influence of Rodin on her artistic and personal life; her father's support and insight for his daughter; insanity as product of social misconception on females' role in the art world.
Great acting and a superb story. The only drawback is that it seems to be told entirely by the 'pro-Claudel's side of view'. In spite of that, this is still a movie that has depth and gives an accurate picture of that passion and conflict for being a fine artist.",1016323200,,590,4.628571428571429
155591,5,0792899768,"The true story about the French sculptor, Camille Claudel.
It is about how she became a sculptor in the late 1800s in France. She met August Rodin and began a very long affair. Their relationship ends and how her life turns down a completely different path.
This movie was so good, that I had to read the book from which this movie was based on.
Isabelle Adjani plays an excellent Camille Claudel!  As does Gerard Depardieu in the role of Auguste Rodin.

155592,5,0792899768,"If you want to get into an engrossing conversation, watch this movie with friends or lend it to them.  There are so many heated issues lurking here.  How many women artists, like Claudel, were exploited by the only ""acceptable"" artists of prior centuries, namely men?  For Rodin clearly steals from Claudel and no one even disputes it.  Next, what drove Claudel to madness and did her edge-of-breakdown personality work for her in her art work? It is quite possible that ""made"" her art more than any other factor.  No one will ever know.  Third, what would the effects of modern modern medicine have on Claudel if she were an artist among us now?

Would she still go mad or would modern drugs save her?  Would she even take modern drugs since many of today's artists will not take them, believing they will be robbed of their creativity.  Finally, what did she really look like because no one could possibly look as good as Isabelle Adjani who plays her, right?  I looked at her photos on the web and surprisingly found her to be an equally gorgeous woman when in her prime.  I guarantee that you won't be able to shut up once you get going on discussing ""Camille Claudel.""  If you are a woman artist, prepare to be up all night.

155593,5,0792899768,"A few years ago, on a beautiful sunny March day, I visited the house and grounds of the Rodin museum, formerly the home of Auguste Rodin.  The museum sits very near a hospital Napoleon commissioned and is in a central tourist area, but it was not overrun with tourists the day I visited.
The weather was so nice, I decided to have lunch in the pavillion on the grounds and eventually spent half a day wondering around the various scuptures situated indoors and outside. The 'Thinker' sat contemplating a nearby bush while a little bird landed on his shoulder, and Balzac looked down in triump from his pedestal. But, inside the house, I found a little room dedicated to the work of Camille Claudel, and here I paused the longest. It struck me then that while Rodin dealt with the external, Claudel dealt with the internal--the soul. I'm a small fan of sculpture, but the marble pieces Claudel worked with her hands are amazing. ""Life-like"" does not say enough. One piece, a marble bust of a child's head and shoulders took my breath away.  I kept waiting for the child to breathe.  I checked to see if she was breathing.  The only pieces I have seen that are comparable were executed by Micheangelo.
The film CAMILLE CLAUDEL is worthy of the heroine and her sad story. Rodin treated her badly, if for no other reason than he had no right to become sexually involved with her when she was his employee and he was a married man. Today he would be locked up for sexual harrassment, and Claudel would not spend most of her life locked up because she became ""hysterical"" after he dumped her.
But, Rodin's greatest sin may have been that he became involved with Claudel because he recognized her genius and he wanted to exploit it. Although Rodin certainly had some interesting ideas, which he managed to execute in a prolific way (the Rodin house shows a continuous and ridiculous film of Rodin ""creating"" a sculpture), I don't think he was terribly innovative. In fact, if the ""Thinker"" had not been made into book ends, most people would probably not know who Rodin was.
Isabel Adjani plays Claudel. She is perfectly cast as Camille, and her performance is as stunning as it was in Queen Margo.  Adjani is one of France's best living actresses--in fact, I think she is the best. Gerhard Depardieu plays Rodin, and he well cast as the large, beefy, inarticulate, egocentric artist.  In fact, he looks exactly like the man in the little film I saw in Paris, just as Adjani looks like the Claudel from her portraits.
The film was shot in Paris, and much of the footage taken at the Rodin museum, a Chateau constructed by a 18th Century Aristocrat who died at the hands of Madame Guilliotine. Buy the film and then visit the Rodin museum in Paris to see Claudel's work.",978134400,90,2762,4.603658536585366
155594,4,0792899768,"This is a really stirring portrayal of an underappreciated French  sculptress named Camille Claudel.  This student of Rodin had a passion and  brilliance all her own.  This film provides a good overview of her  development as an artist and her relationship with August Rodin.  Rodin is  flawlessly portrayed by Gerald Depardieu.  Camille Claudel is played by the  hauntingly beautiful Isabelle Adjani.  Their relationship transcends  teacher-student and they become lovers.  This, of course, is scandalous  even by French standards.  The film tends to be sympathetic (and justly so)  to Claudel as she struggles to emerge with her own artistic identity and  balance her love for an increasingly jealous Rodin.  It is tragic to view  the obstacles faced by this gifted young woman but it is also inspiring  that she continued to follow the muse in spite of any obstacle.",964483200,7,869,5.166666666666667

The film, however, totally belongs to Isabelle Adjani whose performance in the title role of Camille Claudel is completely mesmerising.

155620,4,0792899768,"A slightly long, but compelling look at the lives of Camille Claudel and Auguste Rodin in the late 19 and early 20C. Despite its length, the movie compresses events that took place between the mid-1880's and 1913. Among the credits in the movie the granddaughter of Paul Claudel, Camille's brother, is included as consultant for the movie. Her access to family archives provided details, both fact and conjecture, that the movie makers used to construct a dramatic rendering of this love story between two master sculptors. The performances are good and the historical facts, although adjusted for story-telling purposes, are accurate enough to give the viewer at taste of life as an artist in turn-of-the-century Paris. One exception: one might leave the movie feeling that Claudel's mental health decline was solely due to Rodin and her relationship with him; however, it might be argued that the prejudices and social limitations placed on women at the time did as much if not more to undermine this remarkable artist's perception of reality. In fact, given the success, recognition and support she deserved by critics, the public and most especially her mother and brother, she might have gone on to bless and amaze our world with more of her sublime renderings.",1408838400,5,1266,5.091346153846154

I was disappointed that more time wasn't focused on her last 30 years she spent in the mental institutions.  That was a very large part of her life.  It wasn't made clear how her family abandoned her and the fact that when the psychiatrists declared her well and sane, her family kept her locked up for the rest of her life. She was declared well and sane for years,but they kept her locked up until her death.  She was buried not by her family but in a plot of the mental institution.

Unfortunately, she struggled with mental illness and lived in times that did not understand women who wanted to do more than be housewives.  After her romance with Rodin ended, she struggled to pay her bills and keep her sanity.  Eventually, her erratic behavior became too much for her family to bear and they shut her away in mental institutions where she spent the last 30 years of her life.  Reports are mixed about her time in the mental hospital - some say the doctors asked her family to release her while reports of personal nurses say she suffered from paranoid delusions and would not have been able to live outside of the hospital.

After he refuses to give up his wife for her, she exhibits her sculptures on her own, with no success. She blames Rodin and his ""gang"" for her failure. According to the movie, she just did not have what it took to be successful on her own.

I do not think he was successful other than letting me know it is extremely messy, models must always be freezing, takes a lifetime to perfect, and lots of mushing translates to a lifesize sensous naked piece of marble.  Tall order to show more I imagine, but I keep thinking Picasso and Michaelangelo, albeit easier to demo.  Unfortunately, I have such a limited background in art that I was expecting to really see the process.  I got a glimpse into that secret world which I imagine earns the respect of all true artists.  When Rodin insults the photographer I was saddened as that about measures the depth of my creative talent.  However, Adjani is truly the centerpiece of creation in this film, I recommend a film on her 'creating' Camille, it was incredible....  I was surprised that the only piece delicately depicted in the film was the beautiful Giganti foot and then maybe his face. Otherwise the rest of the imitations, one would think close to the originals, were absolutely course, unfinished and unimpressive.  I think of the Pride and Prejudice scene at first sight of Mr. Darcy's sculpture collection.....breathtaking!!!  Gerald was perfectly suited much like Alfred in Freida.  It is incomprehensible that this woman had sooo much influence in her family to make them move to Paris, stop going to church, inflict such shame and horror, and she never seems to regret anything but working for Rodin.  The backdrop of late 19th century was a special treat and a bucolic life at Villanueve delightful.

155642,5,0792899768,WOW ! I love love love this film !!! Such a strong story to begin with and then top it off with two brilliant French actors and a true story and you have a phenominal masterpiece ! The story of Camille Claudel and Auguste Rodin is not just told in this film ..it is felt !!,1232496000,,273,3.892857142857143
155643,4,0792899768,"Camille Claudel was the young talented studio assistant to Auguste Rodin who became his muse and lover at a point in his career when he was a commercial success but had become devoid of inspiration. When he refused to leave his common-law wife of many years to marry Camille, she had an abortion and then gradually sunk into paranoid schizophrenia. This is the basic story. However the subtle manner in which the story is told and the unresolved issues in the life of Claudel elevate the film into a work of art.

The film explores the artistic muse and their relationship with the artist.  Camille was a muse in that her images were fresh and vibrant which inspired Rodin. She was also a willful and socially disruptive iconoclastic young women and Rodin is attracted to her outbursts of emotion. He is twice her age and becomes her lover even though he has a common-law wife that he has no intention of leaving. Their collaborations on his sculptures inspired some of his best work. Yet her father wisely knew that she was losing herself in Rodin, putting her inspiration into his products, elevating his career and not her own. It is the nature of the artist to draw from all experiences and resources around him/her for the benefit of their art.  Picasso's paintings when he is in love and inspired by a woman are very different from when he is rejecting the woman and he paints her as a monster. The relationship between Rodin and Claudel somewhat reminded me of the relationship between Francis Bacon and George Dyer in the film, Love is the Devil.  Once Dyer reached the point where he no longer inspired Bacon and was in fact a liability due to alcoholism and addiction and mental illness, then Bacon withdraws in much the way Rodin withdraws from Claudel as she becomes increasingly disturbed.

The film is very beautiful to watch. The scenes of Paris and the countryside around the city, as well as the museums and exhibition halls in Paris are very beautiful and grand. The acting is superb with Isabelle Adjani and Gerard Depardieu dominating every scene. Adjani has the ability to play highly disturbed women to perfection. She is in virtually every scene in the film. It is virtually impossible not to watch her when she is on the screen.",1226620800,7,2252,4.7055837563451774

155645,5,0792899768,"A life in-between mania and raging passion
This touching movie - shot in following the biography written by Reine-Marie Paris - respects Camille Claudel and her tragic life most powerfully.

Isabell Adjani who pictures an amazingly striking similarity of the original gets herself as actress brilliantly into Claudel's personality which again and again links up a paranoid disorder with a brilliant sculptor in her own right and kind on its way down to an obsessively self created social withdrawal, unavoidably for women at those time.
Absorbingly, impressively and intensely Adani dominates for nearly 3 hours this dramatic course of paranoid schizophrenia of this extraordinary lady artist, an illness which is nurtured by affective, creative and wrecking actions and ""happenings"" and which - in a world dominated by men - has impeded her development of a successful and harmonious sculptress.

Undoubtedly, Claudel's fascinating fine art works of ""A revolt against nature: a woman genius"" [Octave Mirbeau] emerged from an intensive and artistically minded, worthwhile love affair with Auguste Rodin, perfectly played by Depardieu, a relationship which supported Rodin by its discrepancy and conflict as well but which, however, finally ended for Claudel in apathy and paranoia after a life of dissipation.

This movie is really genially directed by Nuytten and shows without beating about the bush or any kind of glorification this tragically ending, close companionship, a companionship which could have guided both to a cohabitation but - paradoxically supporting their individual great artistic intentions - split them instead due to two distinctly conflictive and contrary emotions and reasons.

... a most convincing und straight forward documentation about the 1st half of the life of a highly gifted artist",1214697600,2,1817,5.525179856115108
155646,3,0792899768,"This movie is based on the life of Camille Claudel (1864-1943) who was a beautiful and talented French sculptor.  She gets support from her Father early on in her passionate pursuit of her artistic development however he eventually climbs on the side of her despicable Mother who looks for Camille to take a more traditional path in life (wife, mother, etc).

Rodin, considered by many to be one of the world's greatest sculptors, took on Camille as a mentee and quickly learned that in many ways her talents exceeded his.  Rodin, twice her age, falls in love with Claudel and she with him.  Claudel presses Rodin to marry her after learning that she is pregnant however Rodin refuses to commit to her or to any woman for that matter.  Claudel reluctantly walks away from him and eventually loses her mind when she sees that Rodin goes on surviving without her.  She becomes convinced that Rodin and his supporters were out to steal her work and her best ideas and she eventually is institutionalized for 30 years until her death at 78 years of age.

I found the story to be engaging and the cinematography to be first rate.  However this nearly 3 hour movie was a bit slow moving for me and certain parts were hard to reconcile (Claudel barely ages throughout the movie - Rodin's ability to walk away from Claudel after she is such a great inspiration and love to him - her odd relationship with her brother.)",1212537600,,1410,4.612

Film dwells more on the sensuality and subsequent madness of the relationship and doesn't focus on the fact that they eventually considered themselves equals in their art, how strongly they influenced each other and how much they actually worked together.

Long a student of modern art, I learned a great deal from this film that had been unknown to me before. Furthermore the film is compelling as a work of art itself, and enormously important to the on-going study of women artists.

This is a work all admirers of modern art should view.",1140393600,5,416,4.473684210526316
155655,4,0792899768,"Camille Claudel was a sculptor in a time when women were discouraged from art - and especially from that most muscular of arts, sculpture. Such was her genius, though, that she was accepted as Rodin's student. He supported her career, both as his assitant and as an artist in her own right. Some people say that her skill outstripped even his.

Why, then, is her work so little known today? Certainly not because it's appeal faded with  time. It still has all the power to move a viewer that it ever did. The reason is probably that there was so very little of her work, and even less extant today. Her career lasted only a few of her adult years. Illness of mind drove her from the people and venues that supported her, and drove her to destroy much of her own work. In the end, illness left her unable even to care for herself. She was hospitalized in 1913, and died in 1943 without regaining her sanity, her freedom, or her career.

This lovely movie documents her life up to 1913. It shows her early promise, her rise to success, and her collapse into incapacity. The basic historical facts, to the best of my knowledge, are sound, but may have been stretched in a few places. Her relationship with Rodin is shown, but may not have been given the emphasis it warranted. Her removal to the hospital for the insane is shown, too, but may not have been the peaceable affair displayed here. No matter. Claudel the artist deserves the attention, and Claudel the woman leaves us asking what wonders that illness stole from her and from history.

Rodin uses her, emotionally and physically, and when she becomes pregnant by him and wants him to marry her, he refuses (he's actually living with another woman). She has an abortion, attempts again to get Rodin to marry her, fails at this - and then slips into the madness of paranoia. She continues to sculpt, has one showing, but it's not a success and she goes off the deep end. She spends the last 30 years of her life in an asylum.

155658,5,0792899768,"This movie was a 1989 nominee for the Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar, and, amazingly enough, received a Best Actress citation as well for Isabelle Adjani's outstanding performance.

This is the story of the title woman, an accomplished, renowned--albeit looney--artist/sculptress.  That is basially, in a nutshell, the only real problem I had with the movie; it resorts to cliche and tries to tell us that she was crazy, when all she wanted was to be loved by her husband, the artist Rodin (Gerard Depardieu).  This all allegedly happened in real life, keep in mind, and what we think is going to happen actually does happen towards the end of the movie.

The story is long, but satisfying.  Isabelle Adjani is a sight to behold, as she's both a beautiful woman and an amazing actress; she'd have to be to hold our attention for almost three hours.  And the French language truly will have an effect on all the non-speakers out there, like myself (but thank God for subtitles).  All-in-all, definitely some good stuff.

Isabelle Adjani artfully plays real life French sculpturess, Camille Claudel. She displays pure emotion and passionate reactions such that she is completely believable as the tragic yet talented Claudel. Claudel becomes Auguste Rodin's assistant and eventual lover/muse. They fight and compete for fame together and seperately with Claudel always the more talented but underscored by Rodin's jealously and fierce connections to the art world. In the end Claudel succumbs to a broken and ravaged heart betrayed in many ways by her one true love, Rodin.
I recently returned from a trip to Paris and having seen first hand the sculptures created by Claudel and Rodin I am even more impressed with this tragic story of talented yet conflicted artists. To see the obvious gentleness with which Claudel can carve marble and to feel the warmth that stems from a slab of cold stone left me mesmerized by her talent. Rodin appears clumsy and inept next to her creations despite his world reknown fame. I will always wonder what a woman of her talent could have created had she been alive today and not under the influence of an egotistical maniac!",1084838400,28,1248,4.919431279620853

The pace was a little frustrating near the end, but considering the topic at hand (the demise of a promising artist), it is understandable. What does make an impression are the images. Many of the scenes have almost a photographic quality - very nice cinematography. The relationship between Camille and Rodin is very full of little nuances that keep the viewer engaged, too.

Then she gets involved with Renoir, a womanizing artist and a married man.  She forgets herself in his world and when he doesn't choose between her and his wife, she leaves feeling as if he is at fault for her waning popularity.  Claudel was a talented artist of her day when women were considered second-class citizens and encouraged by her father to be the person she was.  Unfortunately, she came across disappointment and mental distress when her relationship with Renoir ended.  While she was his mistress, she wasn't herself, and without him, she lost her spirit.  Her brother, who was considered the troublemaker, made himself a well-known person in diplomacy and literature.  The movie examines the close relationship between Paul and his sister.  It was sad that her relationship with her mother was never restored.  She always felt she was a threat to her because of her work.  Her father was supportive through and through.  What disappointed him was the daughter that changed into someone else's shadow.  Camille was a gifted woman of her time.  Had she kept her sanity and let go of the demons, she would have maintained high status as Collette.  The movie was a very interesting movie to watch.",1073433600,2,1384,4.854700854700854
155664,5,0792899768,"Adjani is able to take the tyrannical, childish Claudel and portray her with not only intrigue but passion, allowing the viewer to overlook Claudel's whistful predicament. Adjani takes the audience wholeheartedly into Claudel's mind, heart, art, and world with complete empathy. Her portrayal of the sculptress gives great meaning and understanding to the behaviors that proved to be Claude's own undoing.
With Adjani depressed and laying in a flooded apartment the audience has a desire to help her, rescue her, but if it were Claudel we'd most likely keep moving because of her pitifulness. Much of that credit goes to Adjani's beauty as well, not just her talent.
Claudel was never as beautiful as Adjani, sorry, tis true, and Claudel should thank Adjani for using her beauty to highlight her life and draw attention to her works so that they could possibly one day finally be included in Art History texts properly. Because of this film we are able to begin to scratch the surface of the magnitude of the contribution of Claudel's sculptures in relation to the Impressionistic era as a whole. Although dead, she is clearly nudging her way into the art timeline and taking her rightful post.

Movie holds true to facts surrounding Claudel's relationship with Rodin and her family. Adjani was perfect choice portraying naturally beautiful and innately talented Claudel. Rodin DID technically steal her art by her being part of his studio and sadly his mistress. In the movie, Camille's father scolds her for squandering her talent, but she was deeply in love with Rodin.
Don't want to give away ending. Just make sure you don't see the new movie, ""Camille Claudel 1915"" with Binoche first. You must watch 1988 movie ""Camille Claudel"" and value her bravery and talent to put her entire life into perspective.
If you go on YouTube, you will see a good selection of her pieces signed by Rodin. The best on You Tube was created by a French Art Historian, you don't need to understand French to see what he is proving. Rodin's most beloved piece, ""Embrace"" was sculpted by Camille.
Museum in Salem, MA had Rodin exhibit this past summer and you can clearly see how their styles are clearly delineated. Rodin's ""Thinker"" is emblematic with knotty hands and feet, whereas Claudel's (signed by Rodin) ""Embrace"" is sensual, graceful and refined.
Camille own piece and signed ""Abandonment"" is 4th photo, 1st photo is self portrait...although signed by Rodin. You can compare ""Embrace"" to ""Abandonment"" and see how much they are alike. 5th photo is plaque outside her apt. near our hotel in Paris.

The director Bruno Nuytten worked as a cinematographer all his life and this is the only one he directed, wrote as a decent recognized movie in his life. And it was a masterfully done one.
The music, the Goddess actress Isabelle Adjani, the beautifully shot evey shots are just work of art itself.
If you skip this movie, you are an idiot.

Isabelle's three greatest movie for me are <Queen Margot><POSSESSION> and this movie. And this one is I think her best. She burt her whole body for this film. She just didn't care at all what will come next. She just lost everything for this film.

You will see. I don' mean that she is exposed herself as a full nudity or something but it was more then that.
She appeared to be a crazy woman, she was a passionate artist and to look as such, she did everything.
You will see how great she was when you see this film.

It's all about her.

The music embrased the film the whole time done by Gabriel Yared who done more then 200 other films in his life.
You will be enchanted by the music and try to find the OST at once.

The lighening was so so great that it will blind you through the movie. I didn't even looked at the cinematographer's credit since the director is the master of photograpy.

More surprising thing is the acting was also superb.
He acheived both cinematography and acting from this film.
