2793213,4,B000OCXNQW,"When I rewatched the fifth season of ""The Dead Zone"" from start to finish on DVD (bonus points for this set coming out right before the start of the sixth season) I also happened to be working my way through ""The X-Files,"" watching one episode a night right before bed (I am up to Season 7 at this point).  While watching ""The X-Files"" I had discovered that I really did not care as much about the so-called ""mythology"" episodes as I did the various weird cases that Mulder and Scully had to deal with that never involved aliens, black oil, or whatever.  As I watched ""The Dead Zone: The Complete Fifth Season"" I found myself having a similar reaction to Greg Stillson every time he showed up in an episode.

Everybody who read Stephen King's novel ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dead-Zone/dp/0451155750/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dead Zone</a>"" (loved it) or saw the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/theatrical-movie/dp/B000GBEWH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">theatrical movie</a>&nbsp;(thought it was miscast) knows that the final confrontation with Greg Stillson is what costs Johnny Smith his life.  Johnny knows from one of his magic touches that Stillson's fledgling political career will end up with him as President, at which point he will cause a nuclear war.  The conflict in the novel was all about Johnny finding out that he could change the future for the better and then trying to come to terms with whether or not he had the moral authority to do so.  Well, in the television series Johnny came to that decision a long time ago and while it was obvious that the television series had to be about a whole lot more than Stillson, I now have the feeling that this is all going to end just like the book/movie with both of them dead.  Okay, maybe Johnny will get out this alive, but I am becoming more and more convinced that the situation will not be resolved until the final episode.

This season begins with Stillson engaged to Miranda Ellis (""Forbidden Fruit""), which resolves the previous season's cliffhanger in unspectacular fashion, and he pops up again as part of a government committee investigating Johnny's actions at a Waco-like disaster involving a religious cult (""Vortex""), and then in the final episode as events take him closer to the White House (""The Hunting Party"").  But five seasons down the road, it is hard to care anymore.  There is a major development in this whole plotline in that it is not just a combination of Stillson's charisma and a reactionary political climate that will make him president but also the machinations of the Janus Group.  I can do without the whole conspiracy bit, but they now become another element for Johnny to deal with from now on.

It is also another reason that I like the episodes that have nothing to do with either Stillson or Janus.  ""Independence Day"" shows what Johnny can do stuck in a traffic jam on the highway, ends up as the inside man on a robbery (""The Inside Man""), and infiltrates a cult compound (""Vortex"").  Those last two are interesting because they touch on the religious implications of Johnny's gift much more than they usually do on the show.  ""Symmetry,"" in which Johnny experiences visions from multiple perspectives, shows that the writers can still come up with interesting twists on the basic premise of Johnny's powers.  I was much less enamored with the idea that Gene Purdy has any secrets left when it comes to Johnny (""Revelations""), but having the Collector back for another go round worked out pretty well (""Into the Heart of Darkness""), except for what it says about convenient gaps in Johnny's knowledge that allow for such a sequel to take place.

Another reason I wish the show would put Stillson in the rear view mirror is that it seems like some of the cast members are losing interest.  There are a whole bunch of episodes missing one of the characters in this season and already in the current season one of them actually dies (albeit, a fate predicted for them in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cujo/dp/0451161351/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cujo</a>"") and at least one more appears to have left the show.  But then how many times can Bruce ask Johnny what he is going to do about Stillson?  On balance, I still like the show, but the last couple of seasons the USA ""Characters welcome"" promos have been the best part of ""The Dead Zone.""  Co-creators Michael and Shawn Piller, along with actor Anthony Michael Hall and the rest of the cast, have done an admirable job of turning King's novel into a solid television series, but even without psychic powers I have to believe the end is in sight.",1181347200,29,4736,5.061696658097686
2793214,2,B000OCXNQW,"Miranda`s relationship to Stillson should have been explored more.

Now I am training for a half-marathon; and, because of weather, I am doing a lot of my running on my treadmill, 9-12 miles at a time. So I need something to watch that will keep me going for a long time. So I bought the seasons I didn't have because I knew this show would help me out!",1396742400,,412,3.8588235294117648

2793232,4,B000OCXNQW,"I've seen all the six seasons of this series, and they were all great except for the last season (mainly due to how it ended; don't worry it is not as bad as Mass Effect 3).

Anthony Michael Hall is the star of this TV Series. The character he plays is Johnny Smith, a teacher, who after an accident opens up his ""dead zone"" which enables him to touch objects or people and ""see"" (quite vividly in the show) what happened to that person or object.

Each episode usually involves something criminal or something towards the main plot. In the episodes that involve a crime Johnny Smith and his buddy Bruce Lewis (played by John L. Adams) gets entangled with the victim somehow. The stories are almost invariably interesting and have funny bits as well as some awesome science fiction. The episodes where the action centers around the main plot are a bit different. For a while Johnny has visions of the Apocalypse, and it is connected to the future election of congressional candidate Greg Stillson.

I recommend the series to anyone who want to watch a good Sci-Fy series that proved hard to put down.",1388966400,,1100,4.6020408163265305

2793236,5,B000OCXNQW,"Love the 5th season, however, I keep wondering where all these women come from that Johnny seems to be so friendly with that he's kissing-we're given no prior history, so it's a little confusing.  Speaking of confusing, episode 7, Symmetry, has got to be my least favorite episode of all the episodes thus far of all the seasons.  Way to confusing, not filmed well, you don't know if Bruce is a ghost, a figment of the imagination, is really there, or what...is this Johnny, or another character?  Where as Quantum Leap did this type of thing well, this episode went too far.",1374278400,,575,4.617647058823529

I have been enjoying the show while at home on medical leave. The adaptaion outshines the S. King novel. Great science fiction with an underlying lesson in each episode.

2793244,2,B000OCXNQW,"In the beginning this series was enjoyable.  They should have ended it with season three.  The Fifth Season is the worst.  Anthony Michael Hall (or should I say Johnny Smith, not sure which one I'm watching) BELIEVES he's something special. It's become so cliche taking stabs at politicians, religion...

2793247,3,B000OCXNQW,"This fifth season was a bit disappointing. I mainly purchased this season because I loved the first 3 seasons and then kinda put up with the 4th season. I needed to see where the story was going and if you have the compulsion to finish what you've started then get this season and the next. The show picks back up in the 6th season and you'll possibly be disappointed where the show ends but they get a chance to tie most of the loose ends up which is nice. Anyways, the 5th season is mainly for the fan who has followed every season not the casual fan.",1263772800,,553,4.177570093457944

2793250,5,B000OCXNQW,"I'm a fan of Anthony Michael Hall and I love his work, especially in the Dead Zone series.  For me, it's not all based on the story, which is great when it's a nail-biter and makes you hold your breath, but I also put great value to the quality of the acting and the actors.  If they aren't performing up to my standards, then I won't watch the program.  I've always felt that the actors performances in this series was outstanding.  I've come to feel like they are real people and I get involved in their characters emotionally.  When they hurt, I hurt, etc.  If you love sci-fi, great acting and stories that keep you in your seat, then you'll love this series too!",1240012800,,667,4.338709677419355

2793253,3,B000OCXNQW,"The dead zone is a great show. I find season 5 good but could have been
better.  Is finding good writters so hard ?  Here you have a series that
can be used to open so many doors to great stories and only minor doors
are open and the same types of stories come out simular to other shows...
The dead zone has produced many many great stand alone stories that could
be seen as mini movies.  Imagine our hero helping people in different countries
with their taboos, or hidden treasures..creatures...ahh so many possibilities

the best stories.",1220572800,,611,4.4375

The Great Conspiracy Plot is a no-brainer and rather dull, the assassinations just plain silly. Who wrote these scripts?? I feel sad for the excellent cast, many of whom are notably absent in this series, perhaps they read the scripts and bailed out before humiliating themselves?",1214697600,,634,4.7727272727272725

2793261,3,B000OCXNQW,"Season Five of ""The Dead Zone"" starts well and ends extremely well, but leaves a lot to be desired in the middle. The problem with ""The Dead Zone"" is that there is only one continuing storyline for the entire series, that of the impending Apocalypse. Most TV series have a different continuing storyline for each season, which holds the viewers interests for that season, but also allows the viewers to have a feeling of closure at the end of the season. ""The Dead Zone's"" continuing storyline, on the other hand, started in Season one and is still going strong, with the writers only allowing this story to progress by three or four episodes in each season. In this season, there are only two episodes relating to the Apocalypse storyline, and the remaining episodes are just filler (self-contained episodes that don't really lead anywhere). I am now starting to wonder whether we will ever get closure on this storyline or if the series will be cancelled first (I hope not because I really do want to know what happens).

There isn't much else to say about this season. The filler episodes are mediocre; there are few notable guest stars (the only one worth mentioning is Kristen Dalton (Dana), who returns for one episode); and for reasons unknown to me, Nicole DeBoer (Sarah) barely appears. The first and last episodes of this season make it a worthwhile investment, but, at the same time, I am hoping to see improvements in the next season.",1206403200,3,1446,4.760956175298805

Well maybe they had too many traumatic plots for the little boy JJ to have to experience.  After previously purchasing seasons 1-4 and watching them several times it was time to get season 5.  I was disappointed to find this was a bare-bones empty box with no inserts, not a single word about episode descriptions.  Had to print them off the internet.  And at least one episode on each disk skipped in multiple spots and hung up the DVD player until each was polished 2-3 times with Maxell cream and polish.  At least I was able to enjoy all the shows at a cheap price after a little work on my part, and will be able to continue enjoying them in the future.  Now on to the final season 6!  I sure wish they would come up with a 2017 reuntion show :=)",1503273600,,882,4.265060240963855
