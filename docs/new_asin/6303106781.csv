7837852,5,6303106781,"Finally managed to replace my VHS copy.

Believable responses to grief by all members of the family.

This could be used as exemplars of the different Kubler-Ross stages of grief, if you take the stages to be like Shakespeare's ""All the World's a stage"" rather than the  process stage state model.",1403222400,,297,4.784313725490196
7837853,5,6303106781,"For British film goers it is a sad loss that Dirk Bogarde is not with us any more to push forward the art of screen acting and film making as he did from the 1960's to the 1990's. He would have been 91 in 2012. John Gielgud lived well beyond that age. He was a juvenile lead actor from 1946 to about 1957 and then he met the American director Joseph Losey and light comedy and Romantic sagas took a back seat to serious stories. Sometimes his films shocked audiences of the 1970's . Films such as 'The Damned' and the very 'arty' -'The Night Porter' (both about Nazis of World War II ). But they pushed the drama of filmaking forward into a new era. He was always after quality in a film. Not always getting it (usually due to the Director) Daddy Nostalgia is a simple story of an Englishman spending his final years in France with his French wife and daughter. Though a simple story it is beautifully played, true to life .touching and affecting. Well worth viewing.",1356048000,,967,4.348066298342541
7837854,5,6303106781,"This grand drama sees Dirk Bogarde in his last performance, yet one of his best. A film of great dignity, it really makes one think about how precious life really is. A must.",1210636800,7,174,4.303030303030303
7837855,5,6303106781,"The dialogue is exquisite and the always-fascinating Dirk Bogarde and Jane Birkin have a magic dynamic here.  It will be very slow for some but if you like leisurely, subtle French filmmaking, this one's absolutely beautiful and worth the tears. Bonus features are truly a bonus: check out the long, chatty interview with Jane and director Colo Tavernier -- very engaging and insightful. Any woman with a complex father/daughter relationship should see both the movie and that interview. The English/French dialogue shifts add some interesting texture to the character relationships as well.",1190246400,9,591,5.423913043478261
7837856,5,6303106781,"This film was a quietly moving and wrenching film about the ties of family sharing a moment of grief, all the more devastating for being an undercurrent, rarely articluated. A father is dying and his daughter and wife attempt to build a barrier of denial concerning his true conditiom.  Slowly we are witness to the tragedy of human life in all of its mystery and beauty.  Each of the performances are a marvel of subtle emotion, and expression. The film explores the meaning of a person's life and attempts to suggest ways of accepting the inevitable, that is death.",1023840000,3,567,4.717171717171717
7837857,4,6303106781,"I was browsing the video section and picked up this movie on a lark.  It is a beautiful movie about the complex family relationships of a terminally ill father, his daughter and his wife.  This thought provoking film is set  in the Cote D'Azur.  Dirk Bogarde is marvelous as the dying patient who  sneaks out with his daughter to have a glass of whiskey for old times sake.  This is not one of the depressing emanicated man - on the contrary, his  outlook on life is a lesson to us all.",955238400,5,486,4.274725274725275
