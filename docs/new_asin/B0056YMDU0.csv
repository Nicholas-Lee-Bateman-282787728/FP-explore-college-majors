4592904,3,B0056YMDU0,"We love Shrek in our house. I purchased this thinking he would love it but it really scared him and he does not scare easily. They did a story called Shreckcorcist. This was not in the description or on the case. The Pinocchio character's head spun around, he threw up and levitated over the bed etc.... It was just weird. We will put this one away for when he is MUCH older.",1319155200,,375,4.222222222222222
4592905,5,B0056YMDU0,"I read previous reviews and was concerned about Eddie Murphy not being the voice of Donkey.  I got the DVD anyway and prepared myself for the worst.  But I couldn't even tell the difference!  The casting director was smart and hired a guy who does spot-on impressions.  That said, I think Eddie Murphy is a much better singer, but this guy still sounded like Donkey.

Also, I can see how the movie would be scary for some little kids, especially the last story, but my 4yr old handled it fine.

I absolutely loved the Thriller number.",1317254400,5,534,4.510416666666667
4592906,4,B0056YMDU0,"My boys are long-time Shrek fans.  They own and love every movie.  So when we saw this one on a Target shelf, we had to get!  They watched it in the car on the way home, and complained that it was kind of scary.  I watched it with them a couple of days later, and I can see why they thought it was scary.  It is well made and entertaining enough, but beware, it is a bit scary for young kids.",1316995200,6,392,3.7901234567901234

Love the ShreK movies and would not pass on watching the holiday shows as well.  This short feature is just as great as the movies and am so glad I went ahead and purchased it - just in case the networks decide not to air it this year!  Charlie Brown and the Great Pumpkin will always have my heart, but watching the Shrek gang telling spooky stories is great for laugh out loud Halloween fun.",1414540800,2,520,4.350515463917525

4592948,4,B0056YMDU0,Don't buy this movie full price because twenty minutes is not very much.  Two stories are good.  One is tacky but understandable with the characters.  If you're looking for a time waster this is it.,1383264000,,198,4.6
4592949,5,B0056YMDU0,The Shrek movies are a family favorite at our house. This was on tv last year and we thought it was super cute and watched it many times. Not sure I would pay $10 for the 25 minute dvd tho. Hoping it just comes on the television again this year. We didn't think it was too scary at all. Perfect for the kiddos and parents to watch together!,1382572800,,340,4.014705882352941

4592952,4,B0056YMDU0,"It's a good short movie, but won't appeal to everyone, like the ''Shreksorist'' episode won't appeal to children and to many adults. Overall it supposed to be scary, but it wasn't. Just that episode alone was a little creepy. I guess it's still all right, but it isn't a gem.",1375142400,,275,4.52

4592961,5,B0056YMDU0,"This is a Shrek 25 minute made for TV Halloween short movie that is entertaining to celebrate the season with kids and have fun, it is not a full lenght movie for theaters",1355443200,,171,4.212121212121212
4592962,5,B0056YMDU0,It was funny. A typical Shrek movie. It made me laugh at times and I would recommend it. 2 more words required.,1354060800,,111,4.090909090909091
4592963,4,B0056YMDU0,"Its about a 21 minute short film (plus the short play out of the characters version of the music video Thriller by Michael Jackson!). Very cute for Halloween and good for all ages, including adults! It has all of the original characters from the Shrek movies in it who all all decide to tell scary stories to each other on Halloween night to see who would get scared first. They all come up with really cute silly stories but a couple do get a little scary for young ones. It has references to horror movies like The Exorcist and zombies which can spook really young kids, so probably any age over 4 or 5 would enjoy this movie. You're better of purchasing the new combo pack that was just released of ALL the Shrek & Monsters vs. Aliens Halloween movies though instead (which includes this one) that are out called Dreamworks Shrek's Spooky Stories. It has Shrek's Thrilling Tales, Scared Shrekless + Thriller, and the Monsters vs. Aliens Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space (the best out of all the shorts in my opinion!).",1351987200,,1021,4.584699453551913
4592994,1,B0056YMDU0,So excited to get this on Netflix and watch it and it turned out to be a disappointment. There was a story with Gingy that his girlfriend turned into a zombie and brought hundreds of her friends to kill Gingy. This scared my 8 year terribly this afternoon. I should have watched it first. SO glad he stopped watching at that point because from reading the reviews...apparently the movie got scarier as it progressed. Sure hope he doesn't have nightmares tonight. :(  Very disappointed.,1348012800,,485,4.773809523809524
4592995,5,B0056YMDU0,"I am a fan of the Shrek films humor and I love horror so checking this one out was a no brainer. It's light hearted, funny and just scary enough! My six-yearold enjoyed and I love it so it's safe for little ones who like scary stuff already. I hope they make another! I'd love to see this [...]",1329350400,,294,4.0

4592998,5,B0056YMDU0,this 25 minute halloween special of shrek and his gang is awesome. i can't belive on how much time and work that dreamworks puts in this 25 minute specials. i thought that this halloween special was awesome. this is for shrek fans all the way. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1323648000,,299,4.2631578947368425
4592999,5,B0056YMDU0,We are big fans of Shrek so when I found out there was a halloween version available I had to buy it. It came on cable last year and I loved it so I vowed to buy it for this year. My son is 2 and he loves it. Its a great addition to your Shrek collection :-),1323216000,,258,3.4655172413793105
4593000,4,B0056YMDU0,"If you like the other Shrek movies, this is a fun little addition to your DVD collection.  Like Shrek the Halls, it's quite short (about half an hour) but it's full of humor and fun allusions, just like all the other Shreks.  Obviously this is meant for kids, but adults will enjoy it as well.",1322352000,,293,4.3090909090909095
4593001,4,B0056YMDU0,"Shrek and his family and friends gather together to celebrate Shrek's favorite holiday: Halloween. When an argument erupts between Shrek and some of his friends, a wager is made to see who can tell the scariest story of them all. Shrek agrees to the deal, but only if the competition is held at a place he selects. Everyone agrees and Shrek, Donkey, Gingy, Puss, the Three Pigs, the Wolf, and Pinnochio set forth to the storytelling place: the abandoned city and castle of Duloc. One by one the friends tell a spooky story, but not all remain until the end as those who are frightened leave. Gingy tells a story about zombie gingerbread people, Donkey and Puss tell a competing overlapping tales in an attempt to outdo and outfrighten each other, and Shrek tells a story of a possessed little boy. The short is mildly frightening for younger children who will, nonetheless, enjoy this special just for the Shrek characters. Older children will probably enjoy SCARED SHREKLESS the most, but there are plenty of allusions and cultural references that will elude most kids, but that adults will find amusing. I enjoyed this short. If the Shrek universe is to continue to expand with shorts like these, I hope they are all as high quality.

SCARD SHREKLESS also includes a short parody of Michael Jackson's Thriller entitled ""Thriller Night"" as well as a music video with Antonio Banderas and Puss of ""These Boots Are Made for Walking"". There are also trailers for the movies PUSS IN BOOTS, KUNG FU PANDA 2, and several other animated Dreamworks projects.",1322265600,,1551,4.830827067669173
4593002,5,B0056YMDU0,"Shrek and Donkey are two of my favorite animated characters. As always, I was not disappointed in this DVD. I enjoyed it very much!",1321488000,,131,4.5
4593003,2,B0056YMDU0,"I love Shrek and I was so sad to hear they were going to end the series at Shrek Forever After rather than with 5 movies (like originally planned).  I bought the short Shrek The Halls Christmas movie and loved it.  I really hope they keep Shrek alive, even if it is with shorts like this.  Scared Shrekless isn't completely horrible, but I'm very disappointed in it.  I paid $10 for a slopped together Halloween special.  At best, this should be a $5 DVD.

I will say this, Scared Shrekless isn't for very young or sensitive children.  There is no axe murders or anything like that, but there is a lot of material that I myself believe would scare a younger child.  As one reviewer said the ""Shreckcorist"" part of the cartoon was weird and creepy, to a child I can only imagine what it could seem like.  The little information booth in Dulop castle has the puppets singing things like ""We'll chop off your head then laugh when you're dead"" and has a burning priest/judge puppet.  If you think you kids can handle it, I suggest watching it with them and gauge their reactions.

There really is no target age for this.  Too scary for young kids, to short and goofy for the older ones.  It just lacks the magic of Shrek.

On the upside, there are a lot of parts that made me laugh.  I enjoyed it to some extent.  It wasn't a complete loss and I'm just thankful Shrek is staying alive.  However, I felt the need to caution parents for their children's sakes and inform you that it just isn't worth the money.  I'd download it or watch it on Netflix (if they have it) anything to keep from being robbed of $10.",1319414400,,1605,4.346801346801347
