8191371,1,6304605579,"This listing has a lot of incorrect information.  This movie should be dated 1998, not 1935.  My friend has ordered it twice, but both times he received the 1998 version starring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, not Jack LaRue and Fuzzy Knight.  I don't think that old edition even exists on VHS, but if anyone knows where it can be bought, please let me know.  (George, this is for you.)",1282694400,,384,4.442857142857143
