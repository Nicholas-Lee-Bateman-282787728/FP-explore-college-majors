8216625,5,B000V6I7EY,"My friend scar reccomended this video saying he replaced a whole gram of test off his cycle and replaced it with some branch and grew like a mother f'er. I can see why, I now use it everyday on  my post cycle to ward off estrogen. Branch is baddest bb and man alive",1392681600,2,265,4.0
8216626,5,B000V6I7EY,"Branch Warren and his workout partners give inspiring workouts in this video, which also motivates a person to get off the couch. It is not an instruction video, because they do not use safe lifting practices they swing heavy weights that can cause shoulder and back injuries. Buy it for inspiration and motivation.",1297900800,,315,4.962264150943396
8216627,2,B000V6I7EY,"The whole DVD being black and white was rather boring. Would have enjoyed it better in color. It's almost as if they use black and white to cover flaws in their physiques which was rather disappointing. Also, they keep repeating the same 3 phrases over and over...Come on Branch, please come up with something intelligent to say..ugh.",1295740800,2,334,4.87719298245614
8216628,5,B000V6I7EY,I got much love for Branch Warren but I just can't get into these vids a lot of people say they watch before they hit the gym I only think about the roids they are not talking about when I watch this dvd despite all of that I did pass this on to a young 18 yr old who wants to become a bodybuilder,1290211200,,297,3.65625
8216629,1,B000V6I7EY,"I was disappointed with this dvd.  The editing was horrible as in there wasn't any.  Branch doesn't talk so the viewer is left to simply watch him workout.  He doesn't explain his routines or his training methods.  His training partner is reckless and dangerous, and he would be banned at most gyms.

The second dvd shows Branch at home, and he does speak, but we still don't learn anything about him or his training.  This dvd might have been acceptable 10 or 15 years-ago, but not today, especially when Phil Heath and Kai Green have exceptional videos out there.  Even Shawn Ray's ""The Final Countdown"" is a much better buy than ""Raw Reality.""  Save your money and pass on this one.",1277942400,9,685,4.603305785123967
8216630,4,B000V6I7EY,This Video is an eye opener for the level of intensity that is required to achieve the top in Bodybuilding.  As with all endeavours total focus and effort is the path to excellence.  Use the insight to decide how you might apply a focus and intensity to anything that you want to excel at.,1265673600,,289,4.333333333333333
8216631,5,B000V6I7EY,"I used to workout at Gold's Venice back in the 80's and this brought back memories of training in same gym around real Pro's.  Now I'm back working out again and this video is a education watching the warmups, their choice of exercies and the pace they work at.  So if you want a peek into real pro's prepping for a contest in a hard core gym this is the video to check out.",1263772800,,374,4.04054054054054
8216632,2,B000V6I7EY,"In watching this dvd, I found myself put off by how these guys showed no respect for the weights & the gym itself. Tossing the plates around like rubbish. I know if these guys were at any of the hardcore gyms in Sydney,Australia, Like ex-wrestlers Paul Graham or Billy Moore's Gym's they'd have been neck cranked & thrown out of their weight rooms pretty bloody quick.

I've seen Arnold work out. He'd put the weights away for the simple respect of any other gym member to use & wipe down the bench with his towel so as not to leave his sweat behind.
 Now Branch is a strongman, no doubt. Everything else about this dvd was good but boys. put your TOYS away neatly so the other kids can play with them okay?",1245542400,3,707,4.30827067669173
8216633,5,B000V6I7EY,"For participants and/or fans of the sport of bodybuilding, this is a must see. The gym sessions with Branch are uncensored but ring true and are well filmed. Most of the sequences are in black and white, which adds to the intense effect. Branch is as hardcore as they come, and I have tremendous respect for his work ethic and determination which brought him to the world of professional bodybuilding. The training sessions amply explain why he has already won and placed in several top competitions (including a top 10 in the Olympia).

There is also a second disc in the package, which shows Branch at home with his wife and that is also very well done. He is a multi faceted athlete and individual, and this is highly recommended as a top viewing experience.",1193961600,12,761,4.637037037037037
