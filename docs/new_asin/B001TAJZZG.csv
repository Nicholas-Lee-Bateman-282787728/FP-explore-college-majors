8340948,5,B001TAJZZG,"Clash of evils is the long awaited Storm Riders animated film based on Wing Shing Ma's epic manwa saga of comics, featuring foster brothers Wind (Nip Fung) and Cloud (Bou Keng Wang).

I've read at least a 18 of the Storm Rider graphic novels translated to english... Unfortunately the series was never fully translated so I am limited to what happens in the first 18 volumes to explain the film and my perceptions of it.

The theme of storm riders is it explores the hard lives of  Nip Fung and Bou Keng Wang. Nip Fung (wind) is the long haired martial artist, famous for both his kind heart and generous nature. Bou Keng Wan (Cloud) is a warrior who is a bit of a hard case. Both boys are orphaned at a young age because their parents are murdered by their mentor. Their mentor (Conquer) raises them to be warriors because of a prophecy. The entire series is gritty and violent, and is definitely not PC. Even the good guys act bad from time to time and because the series centers around fighting and Kung Fu, combat is a central theme. At the beginning of this film, Wind and Cloud have killed Conquer, but both have been affected due to exposure to flame Kirin blood, and Wind's exposure to a mysterious procedure which seems to enable him to become a demon  (Some of this is covered in the film Storm Riders staring Ekin Cheng which I recommend you watch first).

The power boost has dangerous side effects, which cause the kind-hearted wind to become possessed. This happens whenever Cloud uses his similar ability. When Cloud accesses this power, it causes Wind to go berserk and the two friends fight. During the battle, Cloud is injured and falls from a cliff, leading Wind to believe he killed him. Wind goes on a drinking binge, mourning his friend while Cloud is rescued by some orphans.

I think the film should've explained a bit more as to WHY Wind and Cloud killed Conquer (he was evil of course, but to the uninitiated this might not be clear), and to explain a little more why Nip Fung chose to undergo the procedure to ascend to demonhood.

Cloud is portrayed very sympathetically in the film, when of the two foster brothers he is by far the most deadly and dangerous violent. This never really comes across well, because for half of the film cloud suffers amnesia.

There are lots of cameos by different characters which make sense if you have read the novels but might be confusing to the uninitiated.

I thought the animation, for the most part was beautiful. I really think they captured most of the essence of Cloud, and some of the essence of Wind (for some reason wind's nose looks too sharp and pointy at times).

I think the enormity of Wind's sacrifice to stop Conquer is made clear in the end... As the film seems to end on a cliff hanger.

I hope for a sequel to explore more of the Fung Wan epic. I think it would be better, though, to start at the beginning. The series is too complex to just skip around as this film did.

If you are interested in Storm Riders, I recommend the live action version:
