Compared to the Bach DVD in the same set, it was very disappointing. It is really a Dance DVD.",1336867200,3,172,3.942857142857143
2634872,5,B000HDRAO4,"While any Mozart biography is a good one,this is just to short to cover his musical history. The best one I ever saw was ""Mozart Mystique hosted by Peter Ustinov"" on Mind Extension University on our cable. It was 2 hours and included performance clips of each of his pieces. I recorded it but my copy is only average. I wish somebody would release this on DVD. I also have a 2 hour one he hosted on Beethoven.",1273968000,3,409,4.256410256410256
2634873,5,B000HDRAO4,"An entertaining and musicological production with significant performance pieces to illustrate the thesis. I think it correctly places Amadeus' mature period between the American and French Revolutions. I enjoyed Sir George Solti, Cecilia Bartoli and Jonathan Miller. The BBC did a good job with this. Kudos! I used the free FormatFactory to convert it to MPEG2 which plays on the USB ports of newer TVs. Subtitles are available in 7 languages, I believe. This entire Great Composers series of the BBC has been generally well received.",1269216000,6,535,5.232558139534884

""It's retrospectively that we've constructed this myth of this amazing angel with a supernatural talent, who then was taken away from us too soon.""

The above quotation comes from the beginning of this documentary that presents the life and works of whom many consider to be the greatest composer who ever lived, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756 to 1791).  Besides learning about the man behind the music (this film does a good job of unraveling over 200 years of fiction and myth), we also get to hear, through actual performances, beautiful extracts of his music.

Throughout this documentary are brief comments made by respected others such as pianists, conductors, psychologists, musicologists, historians, and opera directors.  Beware that some of these comments are not in English so make sure you turn on the English subtitles.

This film is narrated by the actor (known especially for his Shakespearean talents) Kenneth Branagh.

What amazed me about this film is that, despite being only an hour long, it covers an incredible amount regarding Mozart's life.  With the addition of actual performances of Mozart's works, this documentary is also incredibly enjoyable and not ever boring.

I will give Mozart's principal works below and include a specific extract example(s) of such a work from this film in parenthesis:

(1) Operas (The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, Cosi fan tutte, Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail, The Magic Flute)

(2) Orchestra: 41 Symphonies (#1, #31 ""Paris,"" #40, #41 ""Jupiter""); numerous divertimenti, serenades, marches etc.

(3) Concertos: 27 for piano (#2), 5 for violin (K219), 1 for clarinet (K622), 2 for flute, 4 for horn

(4) Chamber music: 23 string quartets (K465 ""Dissonance,"" K387); etc.

(5) Piano: 17 sonatas, 2 Fantasias, 15 sets of variations

(6) Church music: 18 masses, 4 litanies, Requiem (completed by one of his students)

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2006) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has no extras.

In conclusion, for those looking to find a quick way to learn everything about W.A. Mozart and to become acquainted with his magnificent music, this is the film to see!!

(1997;  1 hr;  full screen;  17 scenes;  made for TV)

2634876,5,B000HDRAO4,"For an hour program this felt like it ran longer, and that's a GOOD thing! Mozart's music accompanies this documentary with Kenneth Branagh's perfect narration and the blend is very effective. I felt like I learned more about the man who wrote these masterpieces and the hell he was living while he wrote them than from any other program or book on the subject. My heart filled with such emotion several times throughout this program and that is a rare feat so I must give it 5 stars. The best Mozart related DVD since Amadeus, and alot of that was dramatic license. This is the closest you'll get to knowing the soul of Mozart. You'll feel so sad at the end of this dvd when at 35 Mozart died and left so much genuis unfulfilled and only known by God. He was the creative process personified through music.",1172534400,33,807,4.45945945945946

8138926,5,B000HDRAO4,"Sir Colin Davis (deceased), said it best:

""Mozart's musical competency is something Beethoven never achieved"".. at approximately 47 minutes into the documentary.
Mozart wrote an opera seria, Mitridate at age 14 while traveling in Italy with his father Leopold in 1770. The opera was first performed in Milano the 26 day of December of 1770.",1434844800,,341,5.2
