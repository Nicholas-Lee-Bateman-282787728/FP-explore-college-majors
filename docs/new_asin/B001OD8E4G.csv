3729837,4,B001OD8E4G,"These are not only the greatest Superman cartoons ever created, they are some of the greatest cartoons ever created in general. The drawings, animation, coloring, painting, and rotoscoping is among the finest you'll ever see. The stories are all mostly entertaining, with the first half being the best. Truly superb stuff. Surf the net for more information on these historical cartoons.

This 2-disc set will feature all 17 original Max Fleischer cartoon episodes that combined equal about 170 minutes total. The set will also contain two documentary featurettes: ""The Man, The Myth, Superman"" and ""First Flight: The Fleischer Superman Series."" The word is that these are going to be fantastic new transfers from the original negatives from the archives of Warner Bros. and DC Comics. One of the featurettes was available on a previous release of these cartoons from VCI in 2006. Anyone that owns that release might want to hold on to it as it contained several Bonus Features that are not on this set. But what this set will have is reportedly the best transfer of the original films ever seen in addition to one new featurette.

On the back of the DVD case is a line that says the product is ""for the serious adult collector.  Not suitable for children.""  But why not?  These are obviously made for children back in the early 1940s!  The only thing I can think of is that maybe there are some sensitive racial depictions, but I've seen worse from these years.  (In fact, one episode shows a Native American who is a villain, but also a scientific genius. That's no stereotype).  So help me, what could be the reason for keeping these from children today?",1470355200,3,681,4.392

3729844,5,B001OD8E4G,"I loved this old cartoons.  I watched them on TV as a kid.  Superman was not all that powerful, he was affected by tear gas, it took effort to pull a train up hill, he could be  stopped and he always beat the bad guy in the end.  The fact that he needed to exert an extra effort to win made him more heroic.  Watching  them brought back many memories. These cartoons introduced the now famous ""it's a bird,it's a plane introduction.  It also had Superman flying for the first time.  The animation is crude by today's standards, but not bad.  Each story is complete.  Each story is about 10 minutes.  The Cartoon came out before  WWII so none of the bad guy are Japanese or German and Superman fought for Truth and Justice.  It would not be until the 1950's TV series during the Red Scare that they added ""The American Way"" was added. They are fun to watch.",1462060800,,856,4.275
3729845,5,B001OD8E4G,"Great little collection of all the 1940's Superman cartoons. So much you could discuss here. The development of Superman, Daily Planet and what powers he had back then. The amazing animation style by Fleischer. The historical WWII references. There's some really neat little episodes that are very fantastical and fun to watch.
Some reviewers are criticizing the depictions of Germans/Japanese in a few episodes. Well, the US was at war when this was made. WWII was a rough time for people, they needed to see someone like Superman fighting against the enemy and ending the war. Those episodes aimed at WWII are at it's worst a historical look at America's need for heroes and their wanting to end/win the war. A most very interesting point in Superman's existence.",1460419200,,765,4.984375
3729846,5,B001OD8E4G,"Wow, how do I put this? I am not that big a fan of Superman. From the time I was old enough to read comics, he was just okay. It was ""The Justice League of America"" in the Brave the Bold #58, ""The Fantastic Four,"" ""Spider-man"" and ""Captain America"" whom I couldn't wait to read. I found the recent Richard Donner vs. Richard Lester controversy confusing. I thought the first Christopher Reeve movie took forever to pick up speed, found the knockabout humor of Ned Beatty too much like the campy ""Batman"" TV series and liked the sequel because it was more like a comic book. Then when Donner recut the second film so it reflected his vision and dovetailed into ""Superman Returns,"" I was lost. Then, recently, I remembered the Max and Dave Fleischer cartoons of the 1940s. I watched them and thought THIS is Superman. Yes, I read the reviews that have called the video reproductions filled with technical problems, but everything I wanted in a superhero movie was included, even though short -- these cartoons were Great! Better than the comics; better than the TV shows. The kid in me will always look up to George Reeves, and being able to see Christopher Reeve in episodes of the ""Smallville"" TV series seemed so right. The Justice Society of America appearances in the show tickled the comic fan in me and the eye-popping scene of Hawkman (Michael Shanks) unfurling his wings is imprinted in my brain. So what has all this to do with the Superman cartoons from Paramount Pictures? Well, they have that sense of wonder in nearly every scene. With the exception of Grant Morrison's run on the JLA and the Ed Brubaker/Greg Rucka Batman, I have found little to love in the DC Comics of this or any era, especially Superman. That said,  these cartoons make my heart beat faster from the moment these words are uttered: ""Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's SUPERMAN!"" They are not expensive to buy on video; they're just wonderful. They contain every ounce of enthusiasm creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster put into their hero, a spirit carried on only by Lee Falk's The Phantom in today's Hermes Press comic books and in the Marvel movie universe. Trust me. You WILL believe in truth and justice -- the ideal two New York teenagers knew their country needed in the war-ravaged 1940s and we so desperately need today.",1459987200,,2332,4.632850241545894

3729849,4,B001OD8E4G,"Though they are in public domain and found on numerous dollar bin DVD's in varying quality, Warner Bros. has decided to release all 17 of the Superman cartoons from Paramount Studios on DVD, using what they claim to be the original 35mm elements. At first, I assumed Warner Bros. would have given these cartoons the ""Golden Collection"" treatment, especially since they proudly OWN Superman. Unfortunately this is where I had to drop a star because the ending scores are incorrect, and there are some really odd jumps between musical scores during the title sequences. Also, when I received this DVD NEW, there were no liner notes that had the cartoon listings.

As for the cartoons, Disc 1 is all the Superman cartoons directed by Dave Fleischer, with the first short in the series ""Superman"" receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short, while Disc 2 is all of the Famous Studios Superman cartoons, many of which feature the Man Of Steel fighting in wartime adventures, and though one of the shorts is titled ""Japoteurs"", the stereotypes are not as grotesque as those found in the Popeye cartoons Famous was producing around the time. Just as Betty Boop (another Fleischer Studios cartoon) set the trend for adult humor in animation a couple years before Tex Avery, the Superman cartoons set the trend for action cartoons that would surge in popularity in the second half of the 20th century. The action-driven plots truly stand out from the Disneyesque and screwball cartoons being made at the time, and the animation (which incorporated Max Fleischer's rotoscoping process) is lush, fluid, and overall superb! Though they initially refused to produce Superman cartoons, the Fleischers have outdone themselves producing these cartoons, in addition to bringing Betty Boop and Popeye to the big screen in the 1930's.

The viewing quality of the shorts may not be as perfect as the Popeye The Sailor DVD's (also released by Warner Bros), but since these are all 17 of the Superman shorts in medium-to-high quality, this is something worth adding to your collection.",1446768000,,2081,5.046511627906977

3729851,5,B001OD8E4G,"the definitive Superman production (as if you really had to ask) is the film series starring Christopher Reeve. second place is a little cluttered, though, consisting of the George Reeves tv series, the Kirk Alyn matinee serials...and the first ever animated Man Of Steel. cartoon producers Max and Dave Fleischer did admittedly have a couple of more successful properties in their stable in Popeye and Betty Boop, but their masterpiece is easily the all too brief series of 17 Superman shorts.
it's not simply the Superman fan in me speaking. it was indeed the former Kal-El's introduction to the Silver Screen, but that is but one of a number of things that make the series a milestone in the art of animation.
most obviously, it was the very first, literally first ever, action/adventure (or otherwise non-comedic) cartoon production. animation was largely considered to of been meant to be whimsical by nature (possibly because it was so obviously a cousin of the comic-strip), so whoever suggested this was literally flying in the face of conventional wisdom. it demonstrated that animation, like so much else, was capable of things other than that with which it was generally associated.
further ground was broken by unprecedented production values. cartoons hadn't yet had to bother with recognizable environments, so the likes of Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse occupied a sort of limbo world, which was meant to be surreal anyway. in this case however, because Superman was well known to be based in a composite of New York City, it was incumbent upon the animators to make sure the New Yorkness of Metropolis was unmistakable.
it was also the first time animation had been designed to reflect how the human body moved. this was achieved by a technique known as ""rotoscoping,"" which basically amounts to filming actual people and modelling the cartoon on that footage. it sounds simple, but it was a new enough approach to make an impression.
it even contributed a thing or two to the still burgeoning Superman continuity. (the comic book was only a few years old at the time.) initially, for instance, our hero simply leaped, as in ""tall buildings in a single bound."" it was under the Fleischers' auspices that he began to fly. also, his first nemesis herein, identified only as The Mad Scientist, could almost be called a prototype for Lex Luthor. when he premiered in the comic a few years later, about the only thing Lex hadn't inherited was the Mr. T-esque hairstyle.
(you can tell how early this is in Superman's life from the relative absence of Jimmy Olsen, not to mention the suspiciously even disposition of Perry White.)
it hadn't been much earlier that Superman's radio adventures premiered, so it was only logical to enlist radio actors Bud Colyer (Clark Kent) and Joan Alexander (Lois Lane) for the big screen incarnation. Colyer's most significant angle on the role was to play Clark in a softer tenor voice, but becoming a booming baritone upon becoming Superman. this not only established a line between the characters, but suggested one plausible reason why the Daily Planet staff never recognized their hero as one of their coworkers. curiously, that duality is only used here in the aforementioned Mad Scientist episode. from there on in Colyer only used the baritone voice, most likely because this incarnation of Superman turned out to be a man of so few words.
most importantly, though, they still pack the same whollop as ever. it's like Star Wars, which is well noted for having broken new ground technologically even in an age when said innovations are so de rigueur that they're harder to feel in the film than they once were. similarly, the Superman series has as strong a sense of drama and excitement as one could hope for, which it was able to fall back on once the revolution it introduced had become the status-quo. (fittingly, there are those who call this series the Star Wars of cartoons.) some have criticized these cartoons for being a little scanty on the story, but considering that they run an average of 8 to 10 minutes, it's pretty impressive how engrossing they manage to be.
but alas, it's reign was all too brief. there were a total of 17 installments over two years. there are any number of potential reasons it was such a blip on the radar. given the ground it broke, it may of become too complicated and/or expensive to maintain. it's also possible that the Fleischers and company simply underestimated it. unlike producer Alexander Salkind and director Richard Donner, who knew that they were dealing with a significant piece of lasting Americana, Max and Dave were, for all intents and purposes, contributing to that mythos. you can never tell what's gonna have staying power. truth to tell, in the days before television syndication and/or home-video, posterity wasn't necessarily an issue.
but either way it was fun while it lasted, and it remains the very best Superman cartoon production ever mounted (or likely to be mounted).",1442448000,,4987,4.923990498812351
3729852,5,B001OD8E4G,"It is really good, REALLY GOOD with great art, animation, atmosphere, an old sense of adventure and suspense that still holds tension, and a worth progenitor to generations of dramatic and action cartoons........... then you hit the racism like a brick wall. A rocket powered brick wall that you just insulted and that hates your face. But that only applies to 4 of the dozen or so shorts.

BUT THAT IS JUST HISTORY FOR YOU. It is animation and thus it is a matter of art that reflects and preserves the time it was created (which is why we don't burn copies of the Merchant of Venice for anti-Semitism). This will put stuff like Dumbo into context a bit more if you still don't get what racism looked like in the bygone days. Not the worst of the era by a long shot (check out some flies her material and war time looney tunes for the whiskey of the breed), but seeing straight up villains with racial masks of the period.........yikes (and nope, it is not just the war time enemies).

It looks like there has been some judicious editing.  When Lois Lane is sent off to cover a story, Clark Kent says ""Gee, boss, isn't that a dangerous job"" [abrupt cut].  He probably would have really added "" for a woman"".

Both the prints of THE BULLETEERS and TERROR ON THE MIDWAY are bright and light enough to see all the beautiful detail of the art deco backrounds and the animated action of a giant gorilla and a flying bulletcar! Earlier video releases of these 1941 cartoons were muddy in picture quality until Warner Home video started having the cartoons next to episodes of the George Reeves tv show the ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN (I have the black and white episodes of this show on dvd!) Then Bridgestone videos released all the cartoons on vhs from mint condition prints but the beginning animation was missing from TERROR ON THE MIDDWAY. Now these cartoons are restored with all the animation and with a clarity that makes it all eyepopping! Also Bruce W. Timm and Paul Dini express their love for these cartoons and their influence on the BATMAN the ANIMATED SERIES!! I would have liked for there to be audio commentary on the cartoons by Timm and Dini like the audio commentary by Dini on POPEYE CARTOONS vol. 1 that I also love and have! I just watched these classic cartoons again after writing this review and I do notice that a couple of sound effects in the original title openings were left out such as the sound of the train coming towards the viewer in BILLION DOLLAR LIMITED is missing and I know you still see film wear in the form of white specks in the film colour. But one should remember that the Fleichers lost the rights to their cartoons when Paramount fired them from their own studio! So we should all be glad that the existing prints are as good as they are! The shorts could be painstakingly restored one frame at a time by computers that could fill in the white specks with the colour around them (this was done with MGM's THE WIZARD OF OZ) but I don't think Warner Brothers wants to go to that trouble with cartoon shorts! So I'm just glad the shorts have more light in the film frame to see all the details and backround elements! I love the clarity of the Sammy Timburg music too!! Great enhanced, vibrant colour!! But this is great classic stuff that showed that cartoons can be dramatic and exciting and forever show the right way to do SUPERMAN! Siegal and Shuster's model sheets for their character were closely followed by the Fleischer animaters so this is the ""most pure"" version of SUPERMAN you're gonna get on screen!

3729880,4,B001OD8E4G,"The Fleischer Superman cartoons of the 1940s are among the most influential theatrical film productions in the history of animation and comic book media.  They were produced by Max and Dave Fleischer (Dave as director) in between 1941-2 and subsequently, when Fleischer Studios dissolved after the first season of nine installments, they were tackled by Famous Studios from 1942-3, completing the next eight productions.  These short films were shown in theatres as compliments to the screening feature films, and the Fleischers were given a big budget of $50,000; resulting in some of the most lavish, bright and meticulously plot-driven animated shorts produced during the golden age of American cinema.
Originally distributed by Paramount Pictures, these seventeen shorts have garnered much praise as the first animated visual depiction of the Man of Steel, being in only three years of publication at the time, alongside his supporting cast of Lois Lane and Perry White.  As such, the Fleischer shorts portray a Superman who is slightly different from his modern-age incarnation and, in my eyes, he is more of a representation of the original Superman of Earth-Two within the pre-crisis DC Multiverse (in which DC's golden-age characters reside).  This Superman hails from a Krypton that was inhabited by a highly advanced civilisation before it's destruction, with abilities that far outweighed its Earthen counterparts, such as near-impenetrable skin, super strength and the ability to leap long distances in the blink of an eye.  At this time of the character's publication, Superman was merely portrayed as leaping and jumping and it was the Fleischer series of shorts that gave him his famous flying ability, as this would apparently look far more visually aesthetic than having him leaping everywhere in a somewhat limited manner.  Bud Collyer and Joan Alexander provide the voices of Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, respectively, in the same vain as they voice their characters in the 'Adventures of Superman' radio show and, subsequently, during the first season of the animated, Filmation produced 'New Adventures of Superman' in 1966.
Regarding plots, the generic make-up of each short generally includes having Lois becoming embroiled in some sort of trouble whilst attempting to scoop a lead story ahead of Superman's altar-ego, Clark Kent.  He, then, changes in the shadows to Shelley Timberg's iconic musical score, into the Man of Steel before dispatching of the story's villain(s) or threat(s).  In the first series of nine shorts, produced by the two Fleisher brothers, the plots are driven with a more science-fiction theme with robotic machinations, Godzilla-esque beasts and mad scientists bent on global corruption.  The second series of eight shorts, which were handled by Famous Studios on behalf of Paramount, turn away from science-fiction elements and focus more on war-time topicality, having Superman go up against stereotypical portrayals of Japanese saboteurs and Nazi soldiers, with Hitler, himself, making a cameo appearance at the end of 'Jungle Drums'.  It must be noted that, of course, these portrayals can be seen as grossly stereotypical and racially offensive by today's standards.  However, it is important to remember that this type of war-time propaganda is part of our world history and it must be seen through the eyes of a 1940s audience.  Lest we forget, this was a time in which the whole world was up in arms and the Nazi threat was all around.  The world has moved on, and the racial stereotypes presented here are simply a reminder of a time in which the world was heavily divided.  As such, this particular DVD set has been deemed as 'intended for the adult collector and...not suitable for children'.  Because of all seventeen shorts falling into the public domain after their copyright policies were not renewed, there have been a plethora of home video releases on VHS and DVD, which still continue to be churned out to this day.  However, these releases are neither official nor authorized by the current owners of the master prints (Warner Brothers) and they are usually of variable quality.
This two-disc DVD set, entitled 'Max Fleischer's Superman: 1941-1942' and released in April of 2009, is the first official and authorized set of the Fleischer shorts, distributed by Warner Brothers and 'remastered from superior, original vault elements'.  The animation has been cleaned up to a more than reasonable standard, and the rotoscopic motion of the characters seem much more fluid, with environments that show detailed precision.  As opposed to the many unofficial releases in circulation, this set is a true testament to the Fleischer brothers, presenting their work in the way these iconic short theatrical films should be seen - in vivid and bright detail.  The seventeen entries, lasting 145 minutes in total, are presented over two disks, with the first disk holding the first nine instalments of the series produced by Fleischer Studios, and the second disk holding the eight remaining Famous Studio-produced series of shorts.  There are optional subtitles provided for the English hard-of-hearing and for the French-speaking audience, and the shorts are presented in full-frame format, 'preserving the aspect ratio of their original theatrical exhibitions'.  Regarding special features, Warner has provided an exclusive sneak peek at the, then, upcoming DC Universe animated feature 'Green Lantern' on the first disk, which gives some background information on the origins of the Green Lantern character, as well as storyboard concepts and cast and crew interviews exploring their motivations for crafting the film.  On the second disk, two featurettes are provided, lasting roughly ten minutes or so each.  'The Man, the Myth, Superman' explores the tradition of superhuman heroes on the page and screen, stretching from the ancient Roman and Greek myths of Hercules and Mercury to the more contemporary comic-book adaptations that are so prevalent in both literature and in the media.  The final featurette, entitled 'First Flight: The Fleischer Superman Series', explores the origins and influence that these shorts have had on past, present and future interpretations of the Man of Steel and on animation and storytelling in general.
Among the many DVD releases that contain the Fleischer Superman shorts, this official and authorized set stands tall above the rest.  For golden age animation fans and lovers of comic-book lore, 'Max Fleischer's Superman: 1941-1942' finally provides these historic theatrical thrills with a worthy outlet and gives the heartened collector an appreciative nod in the process.",1374192000,,6684,5.348903717826501
3729881,5,B001OD8E4G,"These beautiful cartoons from the 1940s have been available for years in terrible 'private domain' DVDs. The prints were just awful..scratchy, grainy, too dark, poor sound..etc. They always deserved a great treatment since these 17 theatrical shorts were made with hard working and dedicated animation artists. These cartoons were meant to rival Disney cartoons at the time. An unprecedented amount of money was used to create these shorts. Unfortunately they were short lived, mostly because the Fleischer studios went bankrupt. But the first story (The Mad Scientist) truly shows how much time was spent on these cartoons, particularly when you see the machine explode near the end. The colors are magnificent and, of course, all of it was hand drawn rather than computer generated. What is great about this particular DVD set is that finally these shorts were cleaned up and beautifully restored to the quality the original audiences were able to watch back in the theaters. These same shorts with this quality are also available in the Superman tin collection with all of the Superman films including 'Superman Returns'. But the cartoons are scattered around in two disks with other unrelated special features. It's a pain to fumble around finding them. This DVD set is very inexpensive for what you get and it makes it so much easier to pop in the DVD player and just watch them. That's why I would recommend them even if you have them already in the tin collection. And if you by chance own them in a public domain format, I seriously urge you to throw it away and purchase this set. You will probably be absolutely amazed at the difference, making the older versions practically unwatchable. These are a great treat and finally are given the treatment they have deserved for years.",1362787200,,1788,4.963333333333333

3729883,4,B001OD8E4G,"I love Superman. When I was a kid, I had just about everything that Superman was on ; action figures, comics, books, games, and I even had a Superman shirt. I loved this cartoon when I was a kid. I still have a VHS tapes of about half of the shows that I was given in 1985.

Quality of this dvd....
When the case says superior elements were used for this set, you can believe it. Of course, there's a bit of flicker, hair, and scratches, but the image is far and above any public domain sets of this show. The colours are, for the most part, bright and vivid. There were even some effects that I don't remember ever seeing.

Audio....
This is the one downside of this set. The show is in mono. Which, in it's self, isn't a problem. But some of these episodes, if listened to in All Channel Stereo or Full Mono setting, has a strange buzzing or crackling in time with the audio. I'm not finished with the set yet, but so far, it seems as though half of the episodes have this problem. I solved this problem (mostly) by using Direct or Mono settings on my receiver. These cartoons are on the Ultimate Superman Collector's set from a few years ago, so sometime I'll check to see if these episodes have the same sound problem.

Case....
I love the slipcase this set comes in. It has a sort of rough texture to it and the font used gives the set a really cool vintage look.

Update: I finished the set and the strange audio popping and crackling is on about half of the episodes. I checked my ultimate superman dvd set from a few years ago, and the sound isn't on those versions of the episodes. But it's something that I can put up with for the sake of convenience. I didn't see too much difference in the visual quality of the episodes between the two sets. I wish that Warner would do some sort of replacement program or something. But this is warner we're talking about. They don't have a great track record with replacement programs. I still recommend the set, though.

3729886,5,B001OD8E4G,"Kids of any generation, and even adults will probably love these cartoons. They are action-packed and straight to the point. I wish they made superhero movies this way, with a quick intro, and right into the conflict. Lois Lane gets in trouble all the time, but she is always brave and bold. In one episode she is shooting a machine gun at the bad guys, like a Bonnie Parker. In another episode she passes on as a factory worker to find out about a mysterious murder. When she has a chance she is willing to risk her life for her country, which she does against the Japoteers and Nazis. In any case, however, she is always rescued by Superman. Each story centers around the conflict. There is no need for Lex Luthor here; the villains here fit well the role of the mad scientist (a volcano, a loose gorilla, and a dinosaur are sources of trouble in other episodes).The artwork and the musical score in every episode are consistently outstanding. The score adds dynamism to the action.

There is one thing I don't understand. There is a warning statement on the box and DVD case which says that these cartoons are ""intended for the Adult Collector and ... Not Suitable For Children."" I understand the collector part, but I don't see why children can't see this. I would give this a PG because I know there is suggested violence (a hand sinking in a river and there are some fist fights), but nothing in this content makes it unsuitable for children.

This set is not perfect, but it does contain all 17 cartoons from original 35mm elements. There is no DVNR ""restoration"" to ruin the experience.

Animation aficionados have been waiting for a definitive collection of the 1941-43 Superman cartoons, yet Warner Home Video cannot be bothered. Apart from correcting the introduction to ""The Mechanical Monsters,"" Warner simply reissued the same altered versions found in the special editions of ""Superman"" and ""Superman II."" Only two of the 17 cartoons were left unscathed: ""The Arctic Giant"" and ""Electric Earthquake."" Steven T. Siegert's excellent Amazon review touches on all the things wrong with this DVD set. However, the main problem lies in Warner's cynical, quick-buck attitude  they own the original film elements (which can be seen in their ""TV's Best Adventures of Superman"" videocassettes) yet refuse to give these animation classics the proper presentation and respect. Bosko's ""Complete Superman Collection"" remains superior because it offers the original theatrical versions without audio tampering.

Why is that wrong, you might be asking? Because, every one of these films had their own, unique musical closing cues at the fade out! Through their tinkering, now the same music over and over. It is obvious and annoying!
And on the image, If they took the time to clean up the frames one at a time like Disney does to their films, then we would have something to cherish. Instead, take a look at the dirt and debris left on MAGNETIC TELESCOPE for example! HORRIBLE!

But I can't recommended this disc due the the many problems present.  Others have gone into detail on how the opening and closing credits are wrong, and how there are ocassional drop-outs of sound.  To all this I'll add the following which I believe has not been mentioned elsewhere.  Having borrowed a copy from the library I just watched the first episode.  In addtion to the problems previously mentioned I noticed that this set has been censored.  The first episode contains the line spoken by Clark Kent to Perry White: ""Don't you think that's a dangerous job for a woman""  On this set the last three words have been edited out.  I refuse to purchase any item that the politically correct thought police have excised to conform to their dogma.  I want to see works of culture as they were created.  Not how some Big Brother deems they should be presented.  I should note that some other releases of these cartoons also contain this bit of censorship.  But complete versions do exist.  I haven't watched any other episodes yet, so I'm not yet aware of any other possible censoring.

Warner Bros -- Clean up your act.  Present these cartoons complete and unedited.  You can do it.  Until then I'm hoping people don't reward Warners for releasing butchered prints when they can do it right.

P.S. I had to delete a previous review of this item that I posted a while back before I was aware of the censorship issue.",1239408000,40,1567,4.61231884057971
3729900,3,B001OD8E4G,"Finally, Warner Home Video has issued an official stand-alone release of the theatrical Superman cartoons from the 1940's. While it is exciting to finally have this set, it is far from perfect, and therefore you really need to take some things into consideration before you purchase this set. The title alone shows just how much homework Warner Home Video had done. Max Fleischer only produced the first 9 Superman cartoons. The remaining 8 were produced by Famous Studios after Paramount had took control of the Fleischer studio and removed the Fleischer brothers Max and Dave. Also, Famous continued producing new Superman cartons into 1943 before they decided to quit production.

For starters, the project was started by the Max Fleischer studio, a cartoon studio that originated in  New York (but later moved to Miami to produce feature films). The studio head was Max Fleischer, and his brother Dave was the lead director. The Fleischers were under contract to produce theatrical cartoons for Paramount Pictures. The Fleischers had success in the 1930's producing cartoons that starred characters like Betty Boop and Popeye the Sailor, the latter of which was adapted from a newspaper comicstrip started by E.C. Segar. With the growing popularity of the Superman comicstrip, Paramount had interest in making theatrical cartoons based on the series. While cartoons of this era were typically musicals and/or comedies, the Superman comicstrip was action-based. Therefore, these Superman cartoons were the first action-based animated films ever produced. The Fleischer brothers were not interested in producing the Superman cartoons, and when they were approached by Paramount, they quoted a budget so high, they were certain that Paramount would reject it. However, Paramount accepted their proposed budget for the series, and so the Fleischer brothers began work on the Superman cartoons. The first Superman cartoon was produced in 1941 on a budget of $50,000. Just imagine how much money that is if you apply today's inflation rate. The remaining cartoons had a budget of $30,000. Also, the first Superman short, just simply titled ""Superman"" was nominated for an Academy Award in the category Best Short Subjects: Cartoons. The last cartoon produced at the Fleischer studio was ""Terror on the Midway"". Once production continued at Famous Studios, Superman was put in plots that related heavily on American involvement in World War II. Superman fought the Japanese in the shorts ""Japoteurs"" and ""Eleventh Hour"", and fought the Germans in ""Jungle Drums"" and ""Secret Agent"". The stereotypes in these cartoons, especially the Japanese, may be offensive by today's standards, but during the war years, they boosted the morale of American movie audiences. The last Superman cartoon, ""Secret Agent"" was released in 1943.

Now, based on my rating, here is what is good about this set. The colors are really bright and are really attractive to the human eye. In terms of picture quality, Warner has done an outstanding job and no one has reached this level of picture quality yet. Also, ""Terror on the Midway"" is a complete version. Most versions floating around on public domain releases are missing footage at the beginning, and utilize still pictures while the soundtrack plays. Also, the prologue for ""The Mechanical Monsters"" has been corrected from the previous versions released by Warner Bros. The version of ""The Mechanical Monsters"" previously released by Warner borrowed its prologue from the first Superman short. What is unique about the prologue for ""The Mechanical Monsters"" is that it is the only time it is mentioned in the prologue that Superman has x-ray vision.

Now for the bad. The source materials Warner Bros. used on this set are in really rough shape. There are scratches throughout these films. Also, Warner expressed a real lack of quality control as the intros to most of these films have been altered. During the prologue of the first Superman short, there is an audio glitch. The line ""Superman fights a never ending battle for truth and justice"" is heard as ""Superman fights a never ending battle for truth-justice"". There are two cartoons that have the wrong prologue placed at the beginning. The cartoons ""Eleventh Hour"" and ""Jungle Drums"" borrow their prologue from the first Superman cartoon. Strangely, the audio glitch is not present in the prologue used for ""Eleventh Hour"" while it is present in the prologue to ""Jungle Drums"". The rest of the cartoons on this set have their correct prologues, but there are other audio issues. Many of the cartoons on this set have the incorrect Superman theme music playing over the opening credits, most notably on all of the Famous Studios shorts. ""Japoteurs"" borrows its opening credits music from ""Electric Earthquake"", you just have to listen as the title of the cartoon appears, you can hear the same sound effects heard over the title screen for ""Electric Earthquake"". The cartoons ""The Magnetic Telescope"", ""Showdown"", ""Destruction, Inc"", ""The Mummy Strikes"", ""The Underground World"" and ""Secret Agent"" have truncated music playing over the opening credits; basically by cutting the theme music short as the credits end before the entire piece of music accompanying it. As a result, the sound effects originally heard during the title screens for ""The Magnetic Telescope"" (an electrifying sound) and ""Destruction, Inc"" (an explosion) are gone. Lastly, only 3 cartoons have their original Paramount end logo, being ""Superman"", ""The Arctic Giant"" and ""Electric Earthquake"". However, there is a cut in the audio at the end of ""Superman"" as it fades to the Paramount end logo. Also, the other 14 cartoons on this set seem to have the end logo from ""Superman"" tacked onto them.

Overall, I can't discourage anyone from buying this set, but personally, I am once again disappointed by Warner Bros. lack of quality control. In terms of presenting these films as close to original as possible, I actually prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Superman-Cartoons-Diamond-Anniversary-Edition/dp/6305943389/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Superman Cartoons - Diamond Anniversary Edition</a>&nbsp;as the only thing they did to alter these films was briefly super impose the original theatrical release date for a few brief seconds at the beginning of each cartoon.

I'll have to admit that it may not be worth owning if you have that set. BUT, for fans of animation - particularly the wonderful (and often overlooked) products of the Fleischer Studios, this is WONDERFUL. The colors are bright and the prints crisp. The sound sometimes sounds muffled but I'm assuming they did the best they could with the original source material. For those new to these `toon - folks like me who grew up watching George Reeves in the -hour TV series - you should know that these 10-minute gems of animation do not have a lot of dialogue. There is the opening set up where a villain does something ""terrible"" and Lois Lane goes to ""cover it"" and there is the final ""thank you Superman"" (or similar) but the rest is all ACTION done to Sammy Timberg's musical score.

The two short featurettes add some additional info but are really just ""extras"". It's the `toons that count.

As for not all 17 being Fleischer Productions the title of the set refers to the fact that the basic design elements were Fleischer's even though continued by others to finish the series.

So, animation fans, if you didn't dish out big bucks for the big ""Diamond Anniversary Collection"", this one is for you. Note, before sharing with your little kids, that even the package says:"" that it is ""intended for the Adult Collector and is Not Suitable for Children"".

3729904,4,B001OD8E4G,"The reference to Max Fleischer and the 17 SUPERMAN cartoons is further confusion and distortion of facts.  The Fleischer Studios were resposible for the first nine, ending with TERROR ON THE MIDWAY.  The remaining eight were produced by Famous Studios after Paramount's takeover of Fleischer Studios in May, 1942.  Anyone viewing these will notice the change in titles and screen credits that reflect this fact.
All this aside, it is remarkable that this collection has been made available.  But it is unfortunate that the same factual error continues to be repeated.",1238630400,5,567,5.197802197802198

3729907,5,B001OD8E4G,"I will not spend any time discussing the animated genius of these classic cartoon shorts since anyone visiting this page undoubtedly knows that already.  However, since there have been many video releases of the Fleischer Superman shorts over the years, I feel it is necessary to clarify what is being offered with this latest edition.  Having been considered part of the public domain for decades, these shorts have been issued numerous times on VHS and DVD with varying degrees of quality.  The most notable DVD releases have been&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Superman-Cartoons-Diamond-Anniversary-Edition/dp/6305943389/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Superman Cartoons- Diamond Anniversary Edition</a>&nbsp;released in 2000 by Bosko Video (now Image Ent.), and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Ultimate-Max-Fleischer-Cartoon-Collection/dp/B000F9RL9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman- The Ultimate Max Fleischer Cartoon Collection</a>&nbsp;released in 2006 by VCI Video.

WB's offering was unique in that it was the fist time that the Fleischer Superman cartoons were ""remastered from superior, original vault elements.""  The result was more vibrant colors, top notch audio, and minimal amounts of dust and debris.  While still far from perfect, it is the best these cartoons have ever looked.

This 2009 DVD set is nearly identical to the 2006 WB release, only this time as a separate stand-alone collection and the opening prologue to the ""Mechanical Monsters"" short corrected.  For those who own the 2006 WB release, the only other new inclusion is ""The Man, The Myth, Superman"" featurette, which explores the archetype of superhuman heroes on the page and screen.  The ""First Flight: The Fleischer Superman Series"" featurette, which examines the history of the series, was also included as part of the 2006 release.  It should be noted that WB's version has some minor edits to the beginning and ending title sequences (elaborated further in other reviews) that will be more apparent to purists than most buyers.  Hopefully, this information unravels some of the subterfuge surrounding the different versions of these cartoons.  Several decades after first appearing on the screen, the Fleischer Superman cartoons continue to be a benchmark for outstanding animation and are easily worth adding to anyone's video library.",1231977600,187,3352,7.608247422680412

8330430,5,B001OD8E4G,"Great collection of these classic Superman cartoons!  One can step back in time to the early days of an American Icon.  In these movie shorts one can see the complex type of hero that we often take for granted in modern times: a reporter who investigates a story, seeks to get closer to his coworker, becomes a reactionary hero when trouble arises.

These features have been recolored and the quality of the story and the animation hold up to contemporary standards (of course there's a clear context of time to consider.  Nothing exists in a void).
