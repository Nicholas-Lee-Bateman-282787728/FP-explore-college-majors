1741535,5,B00006BSWT,"Love that this gorgeous fireplace is looped and so it can play all evening. Also delighted with the extra feature of a looped ""Video Aquarium."" I have the VHS version of the ""3 Hour Video Fireplace"" but the digital DVD is even better.",1027209600,9,234,4.465116279069767
7966970,5,B00006BSWT,"I LOVED THIS DVD. Apparently my ex did too; it also got stolen in the divorce. I'm going to have to repurchase it. One time, for a Xmas party, we stuck a large TV in the fireplace, hooked a small DVD player up to it, and played this DVD on repeat all night. It was hilarious! Nice ambiance, and the video aquarium that comes with it as a bonus is great at keeping toddlers amused.",1491350400,,380,4.08
7966971,5,B00006BSWT,"I've seen three or four other video fireplaces and this is the best because, although the picture is more analogue and not HD, it creates the homiest atmosphere. In some respects, it's better that the picture is analogue--it softens the glow.",1379721600,,242,4.926829268292683
7966972,3,B00006BSWT,"I bought the VHS version of this but I believe the DVD is the same footage, no upscaling.

It's a nice cosy thing. I only ever listen to the fire sounds when watching these type of things. I have a better DVD fireplace now, better quality image than this one.

It's a good effect, but there are sharper ones available now. This is quite old and was filmed on old video equipment.",1340323200,,379,4.25
7966973,5,B00006BSWT,"I HAVE THE VHS FIREPLACE BUT WANTED SOMETHING BETTER.  I LIKE THIS ONE BECAUSE I JUST USE IT AS A BACKGROUND AND NOT AS A MAIN
FOCAL POINT IN MY LIVING ROOM.  I ENJOY HAVING IT ON AS I READ,
BUT I LISTEN TO OTHER MUSIC INSTEAD OF THE MUSIC ONE THE DISC.
I RECOMMEND THIS DVD AND THINK IT WILL BE ENJOYED ESPECIALLY
DURING THE CHRISTMAS SEASON.......",1060905600,4,349,4.117647058823529
7966974,1,B00006BSWT,"I bought the DVD and feel cheated.  The fire scenario is pleasant enought, but evidently the DVD was made from the VHS tape version since the resolution is far below DVD quality. All the videos are fuzzy;  even worse than the VHS format since they were made from that generation copy. Why couldn't they have done this DVD right and used a high-quality digital source instead of re-copying their old tape?  Could it have cost significantly more?  No.  It only takes a simple digital camcorder.",1042675200,15,492,4.741176470588235
7966975,5,B00006BSWT,"Wish you could sit by a warm, crackling fire this holiday season, but you don't have a fireplace?  The Original Video Fireplace DVD is the holiday cure for your winter chills.

Relax with your family around this wonderful faux roaring fire, and listen to the crackling and popping sound effects as they fill your home with laughter and joy.  While the burning embers glow, and the flames dance like a leaf in the wind, you'd swear you were sitting in front of one of Grandpa's old fires.

Don't be surprised if you feel your feet getting toasty-warm... the Original Video Fireplace DVD is a must-have for any home devoid of a fireplace.",1037923200,10,636,4.651785714285714
7966976,1,B00006BSWT,"Look at the way the previous reviews are written.  I bought this fireplace dvd, and it's kind of neat, but it doesn't inspire the kind of long-winded reflection that these other ""reviewers"" have posted.  This isn't a bad time, but don't be fooled; this is not a ""Hot DVD.""",1037750400,15,272,4.530612244897959
7966977,5,B00006BSWT,"I bought this DVD in spite of the review I read here by ""Kicbox of Fort Lauderdale"" and I love it and felt I had to rebut the ""Kicbox"" review!  After receiving the DVD and viewing it, I thought something was weird in his/her review. ""Kicbox"" said ""the fire sounds were raging,"" Sure they were loud but the fire was roaring so I turned the sound level down a bit and everything sounded great. I guess ""Kicbox"" doesn't have a sound control on his/her TV.
""Kicbox"" complains the top of the fire is cut off. Well I guess it is at the beginning when it is raging. That often happens in a real fireplace when the fireplace is loaded with wood. It did in my Mom's fireplace. I suspect ""Kicbox"" only viewed the opening minutes of the DVD and didn't bother to view the fire further into the DVD when the fire burns down. Had ""Kicbox"" viewed the fire beyond the opening few minutes he/she would have seen the ""tops"" of the flames.
Anyone wanting a Fireplace DVD will love this DVD. Especially since it is ""looped"" and repeats until you turn it off. I give this fireplace DVD five stars. And so does my lady!",1036195200,7,1097,4.325242718446602
7966978,2,B00006BSWT,"I purchased 2 Fireplace DVDs hoping to find a good quality replication of a fireplace.  One of the DVDs was this one.  The background music is always subjective to the listeners taste.  The classical music I could see listening to during the holidays.  But for those that just wanted to hear the fireplace sounds- I would steer clear of this DVD.  First the fire is raging.  The audio reminds me of wind blowing into a news reporter's microphone during a tropical storm (we have those in Florida).
I also did not care for the fact that all you see are the logs burning.  The fire is so raging that the flames are cutoff at the top of the video.  You don't see a ""fireplace"".  You see logs burning with just a speck of the fireplace showing.  The picture of the couple is misleading.  From the picture on the cover I suspected that the background was actual video which it is not.  Of the 2 DVDs I bought I would have to recommend ""Ambient Fire"" over ""The Original Video Fireplace"".  Hope this helps.",1033689600,,999,4.423076923076923
