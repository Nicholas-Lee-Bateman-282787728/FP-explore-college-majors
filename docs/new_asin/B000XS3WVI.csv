3005329,5,B000XS3WVI,I really enjoyed this movie as I am a Larry the Cable Guy Fan.  This movie should not be viewed by children.  I would recommend this movie it is so funny.,1387843200,,154,3.935483870967742
3005330,4,B000XS3WVI,I bought this dvd for my daughter and son-in-law because they were there in person when they recorded it.  I watched it on TV and enjoyed the show myself.  Mr. Git-er-done got it done.  He came through and you will have some laughs.,1201219200,,232,4.348837209302325
3005331,3,B000XS3WVI,"Please be aware this show is not appropriate for children. It's got jokes about Santa Claus having sex with Mrs. Claus. It's got almost-naked strippers shown close-up. It's got language that could get someone on Santa's naughty list. As far as the show itself goes, there are some laughs to be had although most of it is pretty tasteless. Maybe it's just me, but it seems a Christmas show ought to be cleaner?  If you want to see some really good Christmas shows, get The Office seasons 2 and 3. Each of those seasons has an excellent Christmas episode you'll probably want to watch over and over.",1197244800,,597,4.579439252336448
3005332,5,B000XS3WVI,I'm glad that I bought this DVD.  I'm a huge Larry the Cable Guy fan.  I'll watch everything with him in it.  I'm sorry to say that this Christmas special is better than the ones that you see on TV today.,1196899200,9,204,3.926829268292683
