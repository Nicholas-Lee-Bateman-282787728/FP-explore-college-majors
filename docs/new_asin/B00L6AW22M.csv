I ended up buying this set because it was actually cheaper to buy 4 movies, 2 of which I will never watch, rather than buying the Scarygodmother movies separately.",1481414400,,277,4.450980392156863

8664042,5,B00L6AW22M,I can't personally review the Louise movie but the others I know are very entertaining. The first scary godmother my oldest used to watch on repeat when she was younger. Those two movies are from cartoon network I believe and so they do have some older type jokes in them. The second scary godmother I have only seen once and it is a little bit more over kid geared even than the first one. But this is a good deal on some good halloween movies for your kids. I am looking forward to getting them in the mail! !!,1443830400,,512,4.181818181818182
8664043,5,B00L6AW22M,These were great! The only one my kids and I were familiar with was Wubbzy. Eloise and the Scary Godmother series were welcome newcomers in our Halloween movie collection.,1443657600,,171,4.931034482758621
8664044,2,B00L6AW22M,"ehhhh, these were just OK.  i have a 4 and 5 year old and they were kind of scared at some of the movies.  i even turned one of them off because i didn't really get a good vibe from it.  not sure if this will help anyone but we (usually) watch a lot of curious george, dino dan, paw patrol, wallykazam, peppa pig, etc. in our house.  these cartoons had more a ""ren and stimpy"" feel to them or sponge bob.  (meaning with colors and quality of the films) .  i think i'll probably try and sell them on ebay.",1414454400,2,504,3.9405940594059405
