7860108,5,630405310X,"Above And Beyond is a documentary about Michael Jordan that covers from 1991 to 1995. It includes the first three-peat won the Chicago Bulls from '91 to '93, the his first retirement and his publicized and triumphant comeback into the NBA in 1995. Despite being only 50 minutes,it was a great video as it provided a lot of details and great highlight about his life both on and off the court. Aside from his illustrious career in the NBA,it also gives us some insight on how Michael tried to deal with the controversies like his alleged love for gambling and the murder of the father. Also worth mentioning is the video also provides the viewer a look on how he fared as a baseball player in the Minor League while away from the NBA. Definitely,a must-see for a Jordan fan. Excellent coverage!",1410912000,,793,4.591549295774648

I received the item very quickly, too.",1369612800,,295,3.983050847457627
