8042387,1,6303247873,"Loved Dawn/Day of the Dead. I even loved Zombie. I greatly looked forward to Zombie 3. But this movie was ATROCIOUS. One minute you have the traditional slow moving zombie, next minute they are jumping of roofs and talking! No plot. No continuity. This movie was just plain bad. Stay away from this steaming pile of crap",1078444800,,320,4.631578947368421

Just sit back and know that some very ""interesting things"" are about to happen, and you'll find that it's really fun to watch.
Really a film for people who want to see some new ideas. It does look dated, though (unless you have the DVD!).
There are some cool shots in this flick--but I won't give any away.
Remember this: In the first ""Zombie"" film, a zombie wrestles with a shark.",1066867200,,439,4.301204819277109
8042389,1,6303247873,I'm not a fan of Fulci but every once in a while in my search for something interesting I break down and watch one of his films. This movie is bad. It is a blatant knock-off of George Romero's movies and lacks everything that makes those movies worth watching. The effects make-up and gore look like they were done by a high school theatre troupe.  The most offensive thing a movie can do is bore me. This one did just that. Save your time and money and rent something really scarey like Saving Private Ryan.,1033776000,,508,4.347368421052631
