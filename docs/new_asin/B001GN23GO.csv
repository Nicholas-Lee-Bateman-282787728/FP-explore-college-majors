8306221,5,B001GN23GO,"This DVD is one of the most unique comedies I have ever seen.  If you fascinated by the Sopranos, Goodfellas or Italian-American culture in general, you will love this comedic window into their world.  You really feel like you are a part of these guys life and ""club"" as they cater a meal for an upcoming charity event.  You laugh with the guys and are really touched in the end by their big hearts.

This is a perfect gift for that hard to buy for person in your life.  This is such a unique world and it is hilarious!!",1227312000,,520,4.212121212121212
