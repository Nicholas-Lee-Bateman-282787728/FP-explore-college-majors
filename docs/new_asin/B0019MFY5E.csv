8274630,5,B0019MFY5E,"A collection of 11-films that are biblical in nature as shown on 3-DVD disc's. The films are in both: Color and black-n-white. And, some are considered rare and hard to find movies, that are also considered to be: ""Classic Epics."" The running time on each film, varies. So, pop the popcorn and make a weekend of it. Enjoy!
