It didn't make any sense and I didn't understand what was wrong with the guy until almost the ending of the movie.  Not only did I have a hard time understanding it, the acting was absolutely horrible about as bad as it gets.

A serious drama about a near emotional breakdown of a man due to a terrible incident when he was the only surviver in an automobile crash with his parents.

Update:  Second time three days later.  Far more powerful and emotional than the first time.  Much easier to identify with all the endearing scenes.  Very respectable and believable sex scenes, well done.  The music score is fantastic adding passion.  Bravo to this unusual romantic love story!

7414034,2,B014KEP8WG,"The idea of the movie is a good one. A guy, Daniel, who works as a TV host has panic attacks and signs of bi-polar behavior (sometimes super nice and sometimes a jerk) encounters an 18 year old high school young man, Alexander, at a bar/club.  No one knows of Daniel's sexual orientation as he's in the closet about his one night stands.  Alexander, however, unlike other guys, do not accept one night stands and expresses his love for Daniel and pursues him no matter what Daniel says or does to avoid him.  Much later in the movie, Daniel reveals his childhood tragedy to Alexander.  In turn, Alexander calms Daniel, and motivates him to back track to his childhood to help him get over his psychological blames, such as his sister and himself.  In the end, Daniel finally admits his love for Alexander when it's too late (somewhat predictable or a surprise to some audiences).

The problem with this movie isn't the story; it's the director and the guy who plays Daniel.  For the director, this movie is way too long in dragging out the story as half of the movie is super slow and has way too many long scenes demonstrating Daniel's panic attacks.  This could have been cut to a few short scenes.  The story didn't move until the last 30 minutes out of 1.45 hours of the movie.  Daniel's panic attack and relationship with Alexander could have been done within the first 45 minutes of the movie and then just add the last 30 minutes that was interesting to it.  The actor who plays Daniel was poorly cast as his acting were often exaggerated.  It became too annoying whenever the director did close-up scenes on Daniel.

The actor who plays Alexander was perfectly cast.  He had the swagger and the looks for his role, but he needed the right opposite actor to make this movie work better.  This movie is more than rated R as there is one full-frontal nudity scene and several sexual interactions with backside nudity.  Overall it is inappropriate for young or conservative audience.  The sexual scenes were not romantic, but were necessary to demonstrate their relationship between these two lovers.",1499990400,,2104,4.689373297002724
7414035,5,B014KEP8WG,"Good cinematography. Charles Lavack has skill and finesse. Turn ... The music is well written but oftentimes with a heavy-handed volume pushing the film into emotional melodrama and obscuring the acting and film itself. The story line is excellent. The acting is mixed. The male leads are excellent. Connell plays a huge range of character, from emotionless and detached to going through catharsis, his performance continuing to improve throughout the movie. David Cameron may be the most natural. He is 100% convincing at all times. Mimi Kuzyk has a small role but immediately brings her character to life. She is perfect in the role and just a very fine atress. Tamara Gorski is not so convincing. She is acting which sometimes limits the character she portrays.",1499731200,3,764,5.071428571428571

7414040,4,B014KEP8WG,"OK, the basic premise that Alexander exists only in Danel's head doesn't quite work and also makes Daniel even more of a narcissist than he seems at the beginning.

7414041,3,B014KEP8WG,"I was very into the movie, and had gotten invested in the characters - until the end of the film. I thought the device was a bargain bin cop-out.

Not only is there fabulous eye candy and scenery, but the chamber-music accompaniment is achingly beautiful.  I can't thank Vincent Ho enough for the brilliant score that just elevates the story line to a higher plane.  For example, the music during the first love scene (about 40 minutes into the movie) is so wonderful it could be from a Tchaikovsky ballet.  Similarly, some of the simple, plaintive music toward the end of the film practically brought me to tears.  Kudos to all, particularly Mr. Ho!",1497484800,2,604,4.704761904761905

7414047,3,B014KEP8WG,"***Spoiler Alert***. The reviews indicate the characters as an ""alter ego""  while others get too involved in aspect ratios, etc. I don't try to analyze the director's mind or such, but approach a film by whether it's entertaining. The incident that starts all the trauma involves Daniel's sister (who is WAY too old to play the part because when I saw her I thought it was the mother) trying to peek thru the keyhole to see what her little brother is doing with his little friend. The sister tells all, resulting in wiping out the family and the start of Daniel's emotional problems. Skip forward to adult Daniel.
Adult Daniel is incapacitated by panic attacks, although he is very successful in his chosen career. He is in a bar with his work mates and crosses paths with what other reviewers have called his alter ego. Later the alter ego just appears at Daniel's door even though Daniel gave him the brush off at the bar. The alter ego (Alexander) is all of 18 - think pedophilia - and the next thing that happens is that Daniel takes him to bed and has anal sex with him! So for all those folks who delve deeply into motives, what does it mean to both self and alter ego to engage in anal sex with each other? Perhaps that's what makes Alexander schizophrenic because he is yelling ""I hate you!"" one minute and ""I love you!"" the next.
Daniel is a jogger - wait for it - who wears the tightest outfit on the planet. If he had a pimple on his butt, it would have been clearly visible. He has a panic attack, or something, while jogging, runs back to his car and cures the attack by drinking water and having a bite from a candy bar?? Perhaps he suffers as in the TV commercial where a bite of candy bar cures all!
Alexander persists in eliciting info about Daniel's parents and childhood, and goes with Daniel back to the old homestead which is way out in the woods - they have to walk to get to it. Although the house is all boarded up, the door is open and everything inside is just covered with cloths. So then Daniel has his flash back and then everything is known. Why did they go there and what is Alexander doing besides looking out a window on the second floor?
The relationship (??) progresses and the self and the alter ego become more involved with each other. All is fine until the end - which I won't spoil. Just let me say that it would have been enough trauma added to all the previous troubles to have sent Daniel around the bend rather than curing all his ills. Perhaps there are some deep psychological meanings here and I'm just not able to sift out.
Nice bodies. Nice scenery. Strange movie.",1486857600,6,2613,4.3765432098765435
7414048,4,B014KEP8WG,"This is a really great movie and a generally accurate portrayal of a mental illness, as opposed to the typical Hollywood depiction resembling psychopathic behavior. Packaging and movie menu are kind of generic but overall a good experience.",1486684800,,240,5.342105263157895

That made him abandons a talk show very interesting, coming home in an inexplicable way. Things become better for he has known a boy very gentle, who keeps appearing in circumstances he badly needs someone for help.
The film has lots of candy eye, but that doesnt seem to be a problem for an homophobic  audience, since the plot development not is too aggressive, at least from my point of view.
So, the film has a good plot, good actors, and twists in the final that will make us understand the whole film. I would certainly recommend it.",1484524800,,655,4.404958677685951

7414058,4,B014KEP8WG,"Expecting another good gay movie, I was surprised with this one.  Much in the tradition of Hitchcock and Shyamalan, we are presented with a psychological thriller.  A handsome man moving fast in the media world succumbs to panic attacks.  He is saved by the love an an 18-year-old who gives him the love of a bounding high energy puppy.  Both beautiful men, that alone is worth watching as they love each other.  Topping it off, the background music was incredible using many symphony like pieces, amazing music. Very, very pleased to see a gay movie of this quality and subject matter.  Gay media has beautifully evolved from the topics of AIDS, death, and persecution to more mainstream topics.

7414059,3,B014KEP8WG,"Nicely judged study of a TV news journalist whose path to fame is blocked by anxiety attacks linked to childhood trauma, and the studly young waif who rescues him. The actors do their best in underwritten roles and there's a twist in the tale which some viewers will see coming, but this is otherwise a solid drama.

I first saw the film on UK DVD and was impressed enough to order the BD-R. Unfortunately, the film was originally framed and released with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, but both of these home video versions are cropped to 1.78:1 (I'm assuming the US DVD is the same). The images look cramped in places, and the online trailers - which ARE presented in 2.39:1 - demonstrate a visual beauty that has been totally compromised here.

Worse still, the film was shot on HD cameras at 1.78:1 with all the essential information framed within a 2.39 portion of the frame. Instead of using the full 1.78 image and 'opening up' at top and bottom, the home video simply crops the 2.39 version. We're essentially getting a tiny fraction of the original HD image! Why the distributor would undermine their film in this way is simply beyond understanding.",1478131200,5,1150,4.6600985221674875

When they showed the boarded-up ""old house"" at the end I laughed out loud at how fake it looked.

7414116,5,B014KEP8WG,"This is a superb film brilliantly executed. STEEL took me by surprise in more ways than one.  At a first glance, I assumed that it was just another gay themed movie until I read a description which piqued my interest. I was NOT disappointed. Indeed - the ""gayness"" of the film which was tastefully well done was actually secondary to the major thrust of STEEL's story which was basically about coming to terms with one's past, resolving certain current issues, and making one's self whole again. STEEL's primary focus is on 29 year old Daniel (compellingly played by Chad Connell, a most attractive individual) who is a very successful television journalist. Unfortunately, he suffers from periodic panic attacks and paranoia which affect both his career and personal life. Daniel is gay but almost closeted in his introverted world which also keeps him from having an extended or serious relationship with anyone. One night, he has a chance encounter with a young man (19 year old Alexander - played by David Cameron - who is also quite attractive) while celebrating with colleagues in a bar. After buying Alexander a beer, Daniel brushes him aside and leaves the establishment with a panic attack. Things do not end there, however, since Alexander finds out where Daniel lives and comes straight up to his door. Alexander notes the mutual attraction that the two have and will not allow himself to be casually dismissed. He is both a novice but wise beyond his years. It is Alexander's persistence that gradually pulls Daniel out of his shell and forces him to address his various problems head on. The  chemistry between the two is palpable while their dual attractiveness is magnetic and captivating. There is an abundance of ""eye  candy"". However, while their sexual encounters are revealing and bare all, they are more faithful to the term ""making love"" and assuredly not pornographic. The casting for this film for not only the two key characters as well as the supporting ones is spot on and could not have been better. Kudos to those responsible. Unlike other reviewers who have given away THE major ""spoiler"" for this film, I  shall refrain from saying any more except to note a few items in both the DVD and the storyline; While the DVD cover proclaims  ""Deleted Scenes"" under the heading of SPECIAL FEATURES, I could not find any. Additionally, more than one viewing of this film is recommended in order to gain possible insight into the direction of its story and see if you can find any clues. I must confess that I did pick up on two of them but dismissed them thinking that it may have had something to do with the editing (that's my only tease). In closing, I can only say that this is one of the very best of its kind that I have ever seen. A final comment has to do with the film's music score by Vincent Ho. For any movie, it is always an added pleasure to have a fine accompanying music score. In the case of STEEL, its background music is especially noteworthy; and for this viewer/listener it was even reminiscent of Ennio and Andrea  Morricone's magnificent music for CINEMA PARADISO - an additional plus!",1452556800,31,3129,4.742647058823529
7414117,4,B014KEP8WG,"Just finished watching ""Steel"" released by Breaking Glass Pictures.
Spoilers Ahead:
What happens when a successful young man starts to fear his own shadow?
""Steel"" ponders that question with television talk show host Daniel Krueger - an entertainment journalist who is on the cusp of the defining moment in his career after landing a coveted interview with an arms dealer.
There's only one problem.  Daniel suffers from severe agoraphobia and his conditioning is worsening - so much so that he can not handle being around people - even his friends.  Keeping his condition to himself, Daniel suffers a break down during a live show and leaves the studio.
Keeping to himself in his apartment in a self-imposed exile, he begins to try to pick up the pieces by reconditioning himself to be around people in a bar.  Here's where it gets a bit creepy - a young man named Alexander begins pursuing him in the bar and manages to seduce Daniel.  Alexander's age is never given but there are hints that he is a minor; and there are hints that Alexander may not be what he appears to be and may be hiding something from Daniel who is on the brink of a complete and total breakdown.
""Steel"" keeps you guessing.right up to nearly the end as to who Alexander really is.  It also pays homage to Alfred Hitchcock by being an engaging creepy mystery and psychological drama that unflinchingly examines the inner workings of the human heart.
Yet ""Steel"" is not a perfect movie.  It does cheat a little when it comes to who Alexander really is.  There is also the problem of Alexander's indeterminate age.  I'll be generous and say he's 18 - but it's hinted in ""Steel"" that he's younger; yet he does get into a bar without being carded; but is worried about getting in trouble with his mother for not being at home in time for dinner - yet she doesn't seem to care he's bar hopping at night.
Definitely an intriguing movie that is willing to take an unflinching look at mental illness and the on-going recovery process.  Yet as readers of my reviews know, I do deduct points when certain lines are crossed, and ""Steel"" does cross those lines.
Strongly Recommended.

7414121,2,B014KEP8WG,"Chad Connell is prime eye candy (really), and the production trots him out in various slim-fit (or tight fitting) fashion ensembles, so the film must have received excellent backing from the clothing industry. Truly, Connell is not only a very handsome man, but he also has plenty of acting ability. Would that the same could be said for his production and cast colleagues. This production relies too heavily on an outdated French style of story line --even the French have abandoned the slow, tiring, altogether painful and intellectually trying way of unfolding a cinematic story these days-- and comes off as sophomoric. Connell saves the day for the film, although I still found myself flipping forward in order not to fall asleep.",1450828800,4,735,5.032786885245901

7414124,5,B014KEP8WG,"Its rare to discover a Gay film, with the usual eye-grabbing DVD cover, presenting a somewhat common but rarely publicized condition of anxiety disability disorder in an original and unique way and also giving its audience what they expect to see.  Thanks to director Sven Matten and his Canadian crew cleverly telling the story of Daniel, a successful TV journalist portrayed beautifully by Chad Connell but who suffers from panic attacks and paranoia.  We see his journey of self-discovery and realization of personal truths of his horrific past through the meeting of a handsome high school young man, Alexander (David Cameron) who repeatedly appears, probes and challenges Daniel's psyche.  Director Matten created the character of Alexander as Daniel's imagined alter-ego but possessing all the aspiring qualities and/or qualities Daniel desires to be instead of his troubled older self.  It may be apparent to find major fault and disappointment with the story's perplexing conclusion as expressed by others.  But the way I see it for example, the childhood flashbacks and particularly the sudden fatality scene used by the director was a dramatic visual tool to show Daniel's loss of his objective alter-ego only to be followed by him embracing and integrating his neglected child within, i.e. the noted symbolic image of the Russian doll.  The moments thereafter of his self-actualization is poignantly depicted by a series of visual montages which leads to the love and trust of oneself, of others and the final determination to succeed in his career goals.  On the other hand, both leading actors' immensely gorgeous looks and breathtaking nudity are only exceeded by their honest and sensitive portrayal of Daniel/Alexander's struggling ying-yang personalities.  Moreover, not one scene was wasted in telling this tale of pain and growth.  A must-see recommendation.",1449878400,30,1877,5.378839590443686

I want to say that I didn't like the fact that the imaginary friend/lover of the main character was an underage guy.

7414128,3,B014KEP8WG,"This is a disappointing movie since it should have been better than it is.  I say that because for the greater part of it, until the last fifteen minutes or so, it is original, exploring a subject, acute anxiety, rarely seen in movies and doing so, within its accompanying themes, with some intelligence.  The two actorsit is almost a chamber piece, with very little attention paid to the other charactersare too beautiful, but act well and convincingly.  The script is not strong, but it suffices to keep the story moving and the developing love between the two men complex, within the movie's obvious limits, and  for the most part emotionally persuasive.

But the plot goes completely astray near the end.  I suppose I need to issue a spoiler alert here, though I will try to keep what I have to say relatively abstract.  Something happens that turns the narrative into the sort of melodrama that one might associate with soap operas, an extreme event out of the blue that for the most part subverts nearly all that has gone before.  The result is supposed to show how one character thereafter can cope on his own.  But what it does instead is reduce him to a nearly amoral, heartless, and shallow opportunist.

After so huge a moment, so enormous a loss, he shows almost no emotion whatsoever and instead concentrates on getting himself employed at an even bigger and more important job than the one he had before his anxiety drove him off the set.  A character whom one has watched change and confront his painful past turns suddenly into more than a bit of a narcissist.  It is deflating, to say the least, to see the narrative of this movie become suddenly so empty and wrong-headed, its lead character so newly unlikeable and unsympathetic.

It is also a most retrograde turn, as well.  I speak of the moment when the movie changes from one story into another as melodrama.  I mean by that that nothing in the plot necessitates or deserves this sudden intrusion of so drastic and terrible an event into it.  There is some discussion about fate and fatality in the film.  There is even a mention of one way of understanding tragic necessities.  But this film isn't or oughtn't to have been tragic.  It is in no way deep enough for that.  So the loss is arbitrary, and thereby it relies on an old, tired, and one would have hoped long discarded trope of movies about two gay men in love.

If the movie had ended before then, as, given its length, it easily could, or followed its plot to the genuine fulfillment of all that had come before, then it would have been a far superior movie.  As it is, the last section of the movie empties it of nearly everything that emotionally, psychologically, and structurally has happened before.  This is a movie that consumes itself, ruins itself, by failing its own story.  That is what makes it so disappointing and almost painful to watch.",1448496000,6,2886,4.62475442043222

8731141,4,B014KEP8WG,"This movie is very entertaining and suspenseful. The uplifting story about recovering from a traumatic past is one that will resonate with many people. The acting was quite good, and the chemistry between the two main actors is sizzling. The portrayal of the impact of depression and anxiety was pretty accurate; these illnesses can cost jobs and even lives.

There were some problems, however. First, the plot meandered at times. Indeed, they could have eliminated about 15-20 minutes without sacrificing any artistry. The good-looking actors cannot compensate for this weakness -- and believe me, the producers certainly tried to use sex and good looks to fill in the void. Second, the age of the young lover was a bit unnerving. I understand that they were trying to make the main character revisit his past, but having an adult dating someone who needed to make it home for curfew was a bit too much. Third, even though the movie realistically portrayed the effects of depression and anxiety, it didn't do as well showing the audience how to overcome these illnesses. Someone with the deep trauma of the main character would need therapy and, perhaps, even medication to become functional. One visit with someone from the past can't fix it. Fourth, the ominous music was a bit much - as others have mentioned.

Despite these weaknesses, I strongly recommend this movie. It is a good quality production with a positive message. And if you want soft-pornish love scenes, you'll get that too.",1531353600,,1493,4.968

I checked to see if the soundtrack were available, but I could not find it on line nor could I find much music recordings of the talented composer Vincent Ho.  The victory of the main character over his haunting dark past makes it a great story of redemption.
