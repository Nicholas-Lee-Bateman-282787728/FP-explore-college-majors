8012338,3,B0001GQGFG,"Never heard any inkling of this history and found it hard to believe given how fact based films lack funding, hence, assumed they overplayed the evil aspect.... Vincent perfectly cast and oh how so many women can relate to the ""I got duped but I still love 'em"" script... Glad to now see a woman in charge of the state and fighting to maintain fiscal strength... Wanted to know more bout that book and surprised they didn't expose more elements but crafty, conniving, cheat was covered enough in character development... sympathized with the gypped landowners and pleased their OccupyArizona met with success!!! bravo",1332979200,,617,5.0
8012339,4,B0001GQGFG,"This is a review of THE BARON OF ARIZONA (1950) written and directed by Samuel Fuller. Vincent Price stars as master swindler James Reaves who spent years undercover forging and falsifyng documents with the primary goal of proving that he and his wife, played by Ellen Drew, were the owners of the territory, through Spanish land grants, that eventually became the state of Arizona in 1912.

THE BARON OF ARIZONA is a little slow and officious in spots but that may have been done deliberately just to ensure the audience that this is the real story. And this based on fact film is supposedly
very close to what happpened in a scam that started in the 1870s all the way to the early part of the Twentieth Century. Just for that fact alone,if it's actually true, I recommend this film  and give it Four Stars.",1286668800,4,808,4.56551724137931
8012340,4,B0001GQGFG,"***1/2 1950. Written and directed by Samuel Fuller. An office clerk imagines an unbelievable swindle, patiently forging proofs that his wife is the legal owner of Arizona. Vincent Price is imperial as a womanizer, monk, a gypsy and finally as the Baron of Arizona. The most impressive scene of the film is the scene of the lynching which already foreshadows the future masterpieces of Samuel Fuller.
