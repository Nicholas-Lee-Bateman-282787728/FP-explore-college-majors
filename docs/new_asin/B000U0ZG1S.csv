8211718,1,B000U0ZG1S,"I only wanted this for The Cold Room, but the transfer of it is atrocious--full frame and VERY grainy and faded, almost certainly a transfer from a VHS tape.  This is the kind of item it's not worth paying the transport cost for...look for it at a bargain store and don't pay more than a buck or two for it.",1425772800,,307,4.116666666666666
