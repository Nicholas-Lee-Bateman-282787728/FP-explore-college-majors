For those who don't know, this Scholastic series brings the books to life with animation and with different voices speaking for different characters. It's not just flipping the pages of the book and reading the book to you. (It does follow the books word for word, though.)",1386547200,,548,4.71875
8197935,1,B000QXDD3C,"This purchase was intended to use as a visual aid in teaching dental hygiene to kindergarteners.
However, having children of my own, I found the ""teeth"" imitating bad children in a classroom were
too much ""out of line"" with displaying disrespectful behavior and bad attitudes.  I returned this item.",1383177600,6,299,5.1020408163265305
8197936,5,B000QXDD3C,"Our family LOVES Laurie Keller.  Her books are outstanding so it was fun to see them on video.  Open Wide, Tooth School Inside is very well done and actually teaches kids (in a very fun way) about their teeth, mouths and how important it is to take care of them.  We even bought this book for our pediatric dentist.  We highly recommend!!",1382140800,,338,4.403225806451613
