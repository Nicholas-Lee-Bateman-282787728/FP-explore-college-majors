8032765,5,B0002V7S9I,One of my favorite 90's action flicks. Martin Sheen's lookalike brother is VERY slimy as the bad guy and Maria Ortiz steals all her scenes as a sassy dancer. Lots of fun!!,1468713600,,171,4.375
8032766,1,B0002V7S9I,"I got this DVD because my boyfriend was one of the actors in it.  I watched through to his part, then he gets into a fancily choreographed fight (complete with crotch-slamming action courtesy of a conveniently-located shovel) with the effeminate corn-pone hero, then gets stylishly killed, and then I couldn't manage to watch the rest.  It's bad.  Almost in a funny way.  Every now and then I skip through it and find more to laugh at.  The corny dialogue, the dance-like fights, the ridiculous attempts at soft porn with the requisite silicone-filled dumb blonde.  Watch for the awkward scene where Pirate Billy-Bob's girlfriend gets shot.  You can almost hear the director saying, ""Okay, this is the part where you, having hidden sensibly behind the car during the shootout, now inexplicably stand up just at the precise second someone fires at you.""  It's like they ran out of film after the first take and had to make do with what they had.  If you can find this in a library or on some free download site, go ahead and watch it for the laughs, but I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you are dating one of the actors in it.  And even then I'd still urge you to find it at a library.",1401753600,,1189,4.566037735849057
