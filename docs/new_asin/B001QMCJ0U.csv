3765691,3,B001QMCJ0U,"The film starts well enough.  A girl finds herself in a coffin.  Disoriented, she sees a dark figure wearing a silver skull mask.  When he sees she's conscious, his pursuit of her begins.  As the film progresses, the body count gets higher and higher, with victims leaving this life in bizarre and horrific ways.  Director Robert Hall follows a standard horror formula, but his attempt to introduce a slasher monster in the same league as Freddy Kreuger or Jason Voorhees never achieves the iconic status of those characters.  Overall, the acting is superior to most slasher flicks, though Bobbi Sue Luther is standard issue horror heroine.  The film delivers plenty of blood, guts, and gore to make genre fans happy.  During its 90-minute running time, ""Laid to Rest"" provides bits of back story, but Hall is quick to get back to the chase and the blood-letting.  Fans of slasher films generally value excitingly staged horror scenes above exposition, and there is little opportunity for the movie to bog down in talk, talk, talk.  What counts is the visceral thrill of gruesome cinematic killings, and these are delivered with no-holds-barred, unrated relish.",1240617600,,1161,5.031413612565445
3765692,3,B001QMCJ0U,"While watching the movie, I looked up the director online and found an interview where he stated his desire to make an 80's-style slasher film.  No more.  No less.  In that regard, he delivers.  If you want a high body count with explosive gore (aided by the time-honored lack of common sense found among protagonists in slasher films), you've struck red gold.  Will I cop to getting a little bored in places?  Yeah.  Still, it has a few fun twists and turns to surprise audiences.  Also, it seems to be a (tiny) homage to PEEPING TOM, which was a plus.  If you like slasher-time ""old wine in a new bottle,"" this will make for a fun Saturday night.  Added bonuses are some extremely solid performances among the leads and a plot that isn't really driven by teens getting lost in the sticks.  In many ways, it felt like a long episode of MASTERS OF HORROR and should appeal to fans of that great show.",1240617600,,900,4.426829268292683
3765693,3,B001QMCJ0U,"I am going to admit it, gore doesn't make for my style of horror films.  But having said this, gore or not - if the film has a good story, then I will play along.  This movie had a very ominous opening and I was actually drawn into the suspense for a long while.  During the movie though, I found myself losing interest on and off as the plot seemed to thread together cliche slasher motifs with almost strangely engrossing plot elements.  For a long while, the origin of the killer and the main damsel in distress / heroine's amnesic background both kept me wondering what had happened... and more importantly what would happen next.

To me, the making of a good slasher villain has to be a cohesive yet complicated origin that slowly evolves - laying the rules and groundwork for the killer's motives, but also giving hints to his weaknesses and ultimately the path to his destruction.  In this film, the characters are all very believable with certain actors playing beyond typical indie / low budget horror films.  My problem is that in hind sight, I never quite figured out the purpose in the whole thing - which can be good for movies like Hitchcock's The Birds.  For highbrow thinkers like Hitchcock, this can be a catalyst for intellectual thought - but even he would ultimately use a simplified version of the origin method for his slasher great, Psycho's Norman Bates.  Any successful slasher has ultimately done this, whether it was Jason or Michael Myers or Freddy Krueger or Ghostface or even Jigsaw.  Any fan of this genre could tell you the back story and motives for any of these icons.  To go against the grain, a slasher film would have to cover new ground and ultimately try to redress the entire genre.  This movie never came close.

I was surprised by the glossed over origin, due mostly to the cliches.  This movie is the very essence of what slasher films are expected to be.  The killer wears an iconic mask, has a preferred method of killing - i.e. favorite weapon, has a nickname, has his true face hidden away from camera, stalks people one by one ultimately leading to a single girl he obsessively must try to kill, etc., etc.  The only noticeable difference is that the killer display both high technological knowledge paired with a quiet animalistic urge - usually slasher villains are typically inclusive to only one of the two categories.  Other than this and giving a somewhat muddied origin - the film actually sets out a fairly typical slasher movie.

As for the gore, the effects are somewhat repetitive in parts and unbelievably over the top in others, but ultimately I was surprised by how good they were.  Many scenes in the film showed gore that even larger studios hadn't perfected.  The effects, for the most part, all seemed to be practical effects.  I can't recall any cg effects, other than a few scenes that might have used enhanced blue / green screen elements.  Most modern slashers have juggled the pros and cons of cg, luckily this film chose wisely by limiting almost all cg effects to the bare minimum.

Overall there are some interesting plot points, decent acting, and good gore effects - but I would expect than only hardcore slasher and horror fans will find this movie enjoyable.  Ultimately, the fragile plot structure and hum drum ending made me only scratch my head.  This movie had a lot of potential, but in the end I just couldn't figure out why it failed to deliver.  With just a few more plot points, and little better twist at the end... this could've been an amazing slasher.",1240617600,,3542,4.654340836012862
3765694,3,B001QMCJ0U,"OK, it's a slasher film, so 'ick' is pretty much a given.  If you like the genre, you will find plenty of 'ick' in this one.  The predominant color is RED.

As slashers go, this is pretty standard.  The bad guy is, as usual, completely evil, seemingly omnipotent, and virtually invulnerable.  He knows where the victims are going next, and he gets there first, even though he's on foot and they're in a car.  Even though some of the victims have guns and he just has a nasty big knife, there's never any contest.  The victims are toast.

And about the victims...again, as usual in a slasher, they are prone to incredible stupidity.  Even though they live in the middle of nowhere, they never have any gas in their cars, and they have internet access but NO PHONE.  hm. In the 'standard' slasher situation...it's night, there's a madman outside in the dark, we're all together in a well-lit and relatively safe place...they decide, yeah, right, let's split up and all go outside.  Really, some folks just NEED to be removed from the gene pool...

So, getting past the stuff that's 'usual and expected' in a slasher, let me say that this indie film is every bit as well done in the genre as the better-known (and higher budget) Freddys and Jasons.  To the credit of the writers and producers, the victims aren't just paper dolls, included for the sole purpose of being slash-fodder.  We find out a lot about these people and as each one died, I thought, 'awwww, that's too bad, s/he was really NICE!'

We never find out anything about the bad guy. His motives or background are not explained, so he's the only real paper doll in the film.  It's OK, he's got a big knife, that's his job.

If you like the 'slasher' genre, I think you will enjoy this one.  It's amazingly well done for a (relatively) low-budget indie.",1240617600,,1814,4.546296296296297
3765695,5,B001QMCJ0U,"Laid To Rest
Is one of those rare slasher flicks that comes around every once in awhile that really kicks you in the gut .It has an interesting story and original killer,

The gore is off the chain I almost felt like I was watching a snuff film ""not that I ever have"". Some of the effects were so realistic especially one involving Leana Headly ""it was SICK"".The film wasn't greedy with the kills, blood or carnage..

This might even be disturbing for an avid slasher fan it's that awesome. Johnathon Schaech of ""Prom Night"" and ""That Thing You Do"" had a small role but they certainly make use of his time on camera..
The movie is not only gratifying in the gore department but it also has some genuine moments of heart felt drama and I felt some of the characters pain,of course there is a little humor thrown in but not enough to take it to that campy level..It's definately hard core..
LOVED IT and it's now ranked within my favorites..",1240444800,,939,4.421965317919075
3765696,4,B001QMCJ0U,"I have read reviews that praise Laid to Rest as one of the best movies of its kind, while I have also read those that condemn it as one of the worst.  Ultimately, with this movie most especially, it's all about what exactly one expects from a slasher film.  If it's an information-rich plot that explains who the killer is, why he's killing and/or specifically why he kills who he kills, you will be sorely disappointed.  Otherwise, I think you will be most highly pleased, as I was.

Laid to Rest, quite honestly, has some of the most brutal and graphic kill scenes I've ever seen in a slasher film.  What's more is that these kill scenes are given more on-screen time for the viewer than those in most any other I've seen.  The camera never cuts away too soon, and, for better worse, little is left to the imagination.  For example, when a certain victim gets a knife through the head, the viewer sees a most uncommon amount of detail.  When the knife is finally pulled out of the impaled head, the victim appears to be truly real, with bloodying eyes twitching, and skin on the head pulling and stretching, as the knife is removed.  To be honest, I'm not even sure how they did it.  Yes, one can quickly tell that director Robert Hall loves the genre with a passion, since he goes all out to satisfy his fellow fans.  Such exceptional gratuitous detail is dished out more than once in Laid to Rest, as each victim is eliminated by Chrome Skull--the stylishly-masked psycho slasher.  In other scenes a victim's head is filled with air, through his ear, via a tire flat-fixer, a woman's head is sawed off, and a man's face is literally chopped off of his head.  Don't worry.  I won't spoil everything.  I'll leave the excessive details for you to witness yourself.

Speaking of Chrome Skull, here is a killer that is as original, vicious, brutal, and scary as he is lacking in personality and/or background.  This villain literally comes from nowhere and kills everyone he kills for no particular reason that is ever explained.  Chrome Skull has no context.  There is not even a hint of who he is and why he does what he does.  From the film's very beginning, a woman wakes up in a casket, escapes, and quickly finds that she is being pursued by someone trying to kill her.  From that point, everyone with which the woman comes in contact is either killed or meant to be killed by the villain.  The viewer never knows why anything is happening, and never has as much as a single clue to make an inference.

Yes, this lack of context is one of the main criticisms about which I've read from many others.  However, in all truth, exactly how much of a difference does context ever make in such movies anyway?  So what!  If anything, we get the clichd, dicey background about some vengeful social misfit who vents his rage on those who arguably deserve it and/or society in general.  Yes, is it ever that much different, and how much of a difference does it ever really make?  Is that really why we watch such movies anyway?  Of course not!  In reality, we mostly watch slasher films for the very things that Laid to Rest concisely and copiously delivers--blood, guts, gratuitous gore, and killings galore!  No pedigreed gorehound can walk away from this one without at least being satisfied on that level.  If you want more, maybe you're looking for something different anyway.  Maybe wanting more and watching Laid to Rest is like watching a movie you know you won't like, just wanting to gripe about something.  Well, from this point forward, let it be known that you have been warned about what exactly this movie is.  From this point forward, if you watch it anyway, spending your time and money on it anyway, then maybe it's really you who should be criticized.

Laid to Rest is much like a bad dream, if that's not exactly what it is meant to be.  The setting is almost surreal at times, the inhabitants don't always act as they should, and reality is not always what it should be.  No, the movie doesn't make total sense, it doesn't answer enough of our questions, the logic is not always what we want, and even clues are nonexistent.  However again, like a bad dream, it is sufficient to accomplish the goal it pursues.  It delivers, very concisely and thoroughly, one very effective nightmare of a movie.",1240272000,10,4311,4.5625

3765698,3,B001QMCJ0U,"Horror films have changed over the years. Where early films had their share of characters that seemed to return to have brothers, sons, wives, daughters, returns, houses of and more, new characters have grown to become direct ""franchises"" as opposed to characters that result in follow ups. Frankenstein and Dracula are a far cry from Jason and Michael Myers.

Fans that grew up in the past 30 years though remember these franchise creatures more than the original heroes of horror though. They grew up with Freddy and Leatherface. Those are the ones they recall when they think horror film. And how they're attempting to resurrect those same sorts of horror icons in their own movies. One example is Rob Zombie's remake of HALLOWEEN. Another is the newest release, LAID TO REST.

Director Robert Hall, who began in the business with his own effects company, remembers those movies with great fondness. Interviews with him discuss how he isn't crazy about the remakes etc., but would love to see horror films with slashers that are more concerned with fulfilling their interests in murder as opposed to making funny deaths happen.  LAID TO REST is his attempt to make one of those movies.

The story revolves around a young girl who wakes to find herself trapped inside a coffin in a funeral home. After getting out, she looks around to see where she is and starts to deal with her amnesia. When she starts to get help the killer, known as Chrome Skull because of the chrome skull mask he wears, kills the funeral home director and begins stalking her.

The girl (Bobbi Sue Lather) escapes and heads down the road to be picked up by a good Samaritan named Tucker (Kevin Gage) who takes her home. He lets his wife (Lena Headey) know her story and they try to help her. With no gas left in his truck and no phone, they decide to wait until his brother in law shows the next morning to get her help.

Too bad for them Chrome Skull has his own plans. Armed with an assortment of BIG knives and a shoulder mounted video camera, he attacks their home and ends up killing Tucker's wife before they hit the road again. When Tucker's brother in law shows to let his sister know he saw Tucker with another woman in his truck, he and his girlfriend become the next two victims.

Ending up at a house down the road, the girl and Tucker meet Steven (Sean Whalen), a computer nerd who has no phone but can contact the police via email. Steven's mother has recently passed away and we later discover it was her body seen by the girl in the funeral home. After explaining their story to Steven and sending out their email, they get in Steven's car and go looking for help.

Suffice to say that every time you think they're in a safe location Chrome Skull is going to show up. It doesn't matter if it's another home, the funeral home or the police station. Chrome Skull has been their and left behind a gory mess.

The main thread throughout the film is the search for the girl's memory. She has no idea who she is or how she ended up here let alone why Chrome Skull is trying to kill her. During a last all out battle with the bad guy, he presents her with one of his video cameras and allows her to watch a tape that reveals all. Will it make her bow down and let him finish the job? Or will it inspire her to take up arms and put an end to this killer?

The movie plays out like many films that were usually found on direct to video shelves in the 80s. Titles that had variations of the words horror and terror in them. It's more about how the killer takes people out than it is about story, though there is that as well. But the fact is this is a gore fest made up for fans of the genre and actually offers few scares.

That being said, the effects are top notch and some of the best gore scenes filmed in some time. If that's what you're looking for in a horror film you won't be disappointed. Myself, I tend to go more for scares and a deeper story than that presented here. It's a nice attempt and well made, but it left me hoping that Hall's next film will deliver the goods rather than just effects.",1240099200,2,4091,4.369736842105263
3765699,3,B001QMCJ0U,"I'm always on the lookout for obscure low budget horror movies because at they're best they're way better than crappy PG-13 Hollywood horror movies and at their worst they're at least fun to make fun of.

""Laid To Rest"" falls somewhere in between.

At its best, the gore is exclusively practical (live action effects) and is the main reason to see the movie. No stupid distracting CGI blood effects here, just good ol' school gore.

At its worst, the acting and dialog is pretty terrible and the camera work is nothing my 10-year-old niece couldn't do. There's also more than a few cliched scare tricks (when a girl in a horror movie steps in front of a bathroom mirror, you just KNOW something will suddenly appear behind her).

But wait! I haven't even gotten to the plot yet! Well, that's because there isn't one. A girl wakes up in a coffin with amnesia and the killer (aptly named ""Chrome Skull"") stalks her. Why? Doesn't matter. To what end? To kill her, I guess, but Chrome Skull gets the chance to do so more than once and doesn't. People don't see movies like this for the plot anyway, so nevermind that entirely.

Bottom line, it's a bad horror movie but it's also pretty fun to laugh at or make fun of if that's something you like to do (and I do), but it does have some pretty sweet gore effects and cameos from Terminator TV show actors Lena Headey and Thomas Dekker.

Surprisingly, the cast is pretty good, and I was constantly thrown off by the stunt casting with little cameo's here and there, but overall, Laid to Rest is really hard to enjoy because of how badly it's executed. Too bad too, because the effects work is top notch. Some really inventive and gruesome kills only come sporadically. There's just not enough of that to distract you from the tedious experience.

While gruesome and gut-wrenching, the film does have a lot of the hallmarks necessary for the genre. Darkness, lonely country roads, a seemingly unstopped shape, and even a girl waking up in a coffin! It has levity and gore galore, but the gore is artfully done. By no means think the camera cuts away but instead the special effects are SO over the top they become watchable in their just-a-tad-absurd charm.

It also should be noted there is an overall theme of Class Warfare. Several of the classics rely on Virtue Judgment and Revenge to strengthen the plot (Jason tends to kill the promiscuous) here the only reason many are killed is they got in the way. However, the killer, 'ChromeSkull', can represent fears of the 1%. He dresses sharp and drives a nice car...silly as these may sound here, in context they work well.  If you enjoyed The Purge, this (and it's sequel especially) are worth a viewing.

Well worth it! Especially if you're familiar with both staples of the Slasher genre (such as Friday the 13th and The Burning) and the New-Class (such as Hatchet and Behind the Mask; The Rise of Leslie Vernon).",1416528000,,1217,4.704225352112676

They even managed to inject a little humor (the guy with no phone but he has got a computer).  I only have one criticism and that concerns the disorienting opening sequence, a montage for the credits that neither helped create the mood for this film, nor did it add any insight for what was to follow.  It was just a lot of noise and chopped up images.  I consider it a wasted opportunity that could have paved the way for what came after it.

The acting was pretty stellar seeing as to how the only people I had seen before was the guy from People Under The Stairs and the other guy that used to be married to Christina Applegate from the Prom Night remake (now THAT movie was horrible!).  The death scenes were some of the best I've ever witnessed!  In one scene outside of the older man's house, his wife is stabbed with a knife in the head...and you can see her eyeball shaking when he pulls the knife back out!  Just amazingly gross!  There was also just a small hint of humor in this movie that I really appreciated.  I'm not a big comedy girl, nor do I like the whole scary-movie-meets-black-humor thing, but this was just subtle enough to be quite clever and enjoyable.  No, they don't really explain much about Chrome Skull...but this is one movie where you really don't mind the open mystery at the end.  The sequel, however, tries to dive into the story of Chrome Skull a bit more...and, WARNING!: the whole movie blows in a very generic, been-there done-that kinda way.

3765809,4,B001QMCJ0U,"The story isn't all that good and neither is the acting, but what separates Laid To Rest (2009) from most other slashers is that it actually delivers some genuine bone-shattering, ligament tearing, flesh splitting kills, mostly administered by one particularly nasty looking hunting knife.  The killer named `ChromeSkull', wears a mask with a silver chrome finish, and doesn't speak.  Written and directed by Robert Green Hall, the film has good production values, cool special effects, and capable camera work.  Hall's wife Bobby Sue Luther stars in the film, as ""The Girl"".  Spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.

A woman (Luther) wakes up inside a coffin, and after managing to break out, finds herself locked inside a funeral home.  A man is about to unlock a door and let her out, but is stabbed by ChromeSkull (Nick Principe), who has a video camera attached to his shoulder.  The girl rushes the door and manages to get outside and make her way to a road, where she is picked up by Tucker Smith (Kevin Gage), who is on his way home.  The Girl has a wound on the back of her head, and Smith's wife Cindy (Lena Headey) is unable to coax much information from her about what has happened.  ChromeSkull makes a dramatic appearance at the Smith home, and offs Cindy in a truly spectacular manner.  A traumatized Tucker and The Girl, take off in a car, and stop at a house to call the police.  Steven (Sean Whalen), the man who lives there, doesn't have a phone, but sends an email to the police.  Smith convinces Steven to join them on a trek to the police station, where they soon find that ChromeSkull has slaughtered the officers on duty.

The trio flees down the road in Steven's car, stopping when The Girl spots the funeral home she originally escaped from.  The intensity continues to ramp up as she discovers ChromeSkull's grisly workshop in an adjacent building, with coffins containing his dismembered victims.  Smith breaks in and wounds ChromeSkull, and the trio drives away in the killer's car.  The movie's bloody climax takes place in a small convenience store.  The film's resolution is very weak, and not as spectacular as it could have been.

With a story that doesn't make a lot of sense, it's ChromeSkull's vicious and often creative kills that are the high points of the film, as he puts his wicked signature weapon to damn good use.  Like so many psycho killers, ChromeSkull somehow manages to show up everywhere, and there's no point asking why.  Not much is known about The Girl, but a few things about her are finally revealed by ChromeSkull.  Even making allowances for her amnesia, she's not exactly the most sympathetic or intelligent character.  The killer points out, that she seems to be really good at getting people killed.  Tucker is a remarkably tough, for someone who has just witnessed his wife being butchered.  Unfortunately he's not the brightest guy either.  Sean Whalen does a good job, as a kind of a goof in the wrong place, at the wrong time.  Lucas Till shows promise, in a brief role as a store clerk.

Laid To Rest doesn't have an intelligent story or sophisticated premise.  Plain and simple, the victims are setup nicely, and then slaughtered with flair and cruel enthusiasm.  ChromeSkull is very consistent, when he appears, someone is going to get cut up.  For gorehounds, Laid To Rest should satisfy your desire for blood.

A sequel, ChromeSkull: Laid To Rest 2 (2011), is scheduled for release in the fall of 2011, with Nick Principe returning as the masked killer.  As the character lost a vital part of his anatomy in the first film, it's hard to imagine that he could recover, however such things are often no major obstacle in horror.  Scream queen Danielle Harris (Hatchet 2), and Brian Austin Green, will star in the sequel.",1312070400,,3794,4.743511450381679

The movie pays homage to early slasher-era films, adding elements of mystery and dark humor to the story.

The film delivers an captivating tale of terror with a great mixture of entertaining elements. The characters are quirky, the killer is menacing and inventive, the sets are terrific and the music builds tension at the appropriate places.

3765814,4,B001QMCJ0U,"Laid To Rest is quite the interesting movie. It's one of those rare occasions where extremely bad acting doesn't even matter because the film does everything *else* correctly.

This is definitely a horror film, no question about that. It's also an extremely violent and bloody display of gruesome details from beginning to end.

Throughout the film you will see everything from throats being cut up and ripped apart, to stomachs rapidly pouring out blood, to heads immediately getting crushed in completely or shot completely apart!

All these things happen with a TON of blood thrown in for additional effect! I mean, we're talking *bucket loads* of blood here, people!

As I said above, the acting ranges from mediocre to just plain terrible, however that doesn't matter in the slightest because the film seriously delivers with the nonstop action/violence, and you look forward to seeing which unfortunate person will die next. Talk about incredibly gross!

None of the main characters (a teenage girl who always narrowly escapes with her life, a geeky young man who loves computers, and a middle aged, bald headed husband who loves the quiet life) seem to know anything about acting abilities, but that's easily forgivable in this case.

The story is about some tall crazy man who wears a bullet proof silver mask, and he likes to chase the three main characters I mention above.

This is one REALLY aggressive bad guy, too. The moment he sees his victim, he kills them with blood splashing everywhere.

Very violent horror movie this one is. I recommend it for the violence alone. Ignore the pitiful acting by all the characters and you'll have yourself one mighty enjoyable time, I guarantee it.",1280793600,,1701,4.985865724381625

What if they had a solid actress?

What if Bobbie Sue's only talents lie beneath her shirt?

3765817,2,B001QMCJ0U,"I believe I am unable to render any opinion about any element of this film because of the script.

It's the script that keeps me from dismissing the actors.  Who knows?  Maybe they could've really done some good work here if they had something to work with.  Ditto the director.  (From what I read in other reviews, his debut was LIGHTNING BUG, a film I'd seen premeired at the Century City Film Festival in 2004 and thought the same thing: too bad the script didn't work).

The script was such a mess of slasher cliches that didn't know what to believe while watching the film: the world that exists here isn't the real world.  In fact, it's so far removed from the real world that I wondered if the characters were actually already dead and didn't know it. Nope.  The script just didn't know it was in the real world.  Cops don't exist.  Neighbors don't exist.  In fact, so much mayhem goes on unnoticed that you wonder if anyone else existed on this film's planet.

And forget about finding out who the killer is, why he's what he is, why he's doing what he's doing.  He's just an anonymous super killer with a chrome mask he has to keep gluing on, wearing a camcorder on his shoulder and surviving everything from clubs and shovels to bullets.  He is thoughtful enough to move really, really slow to allow some lame scenes between the victims.  So he's at least considerate.

3765819,3,B001QMCJ0U,"LAID TO REST stood the chance to become one of the next big franchises during the Slasher resurgence led by HATCHET in 2006, but all of the film's potential is lost to a lackluster plot and one-dimensional characters. Robert Hall's directorial debut in LIGHTNING BUG delivered all of the heart and originality that this follow-up lacked, where LAID TO REST is just a conventional retread of its Slasher brethren that gives way to a tedious cat and mouse chase with no rewarding payoff. Luther's awful performance as the final girl divests the audience from her lead within the opening act, which is a fault that neither the film nor the characters recover from the remainder of the run time. Nick Principe carries Cromeskull perfectly on the other hand, proving to be both intimidating and terrifying in his body movements and mannerisms as the character. If there is one thing Hall knows best, however, it is gore and special FX, and LAID TO REST doesn't disappoint when it comes to bloody deaths and splatter. With necks being severed and heads being slices in half, there is just enough gore to warrant at least a single viewing. Despite its failings, it is still refreshing to find an uncomplicated revival of the popular 80s sub-genre, but it is not the Slasher classic it could have been.

3765820,4,B001QMCJ0U,"Laid to Rest: 7 out of 10: Laid to Rest is a real slasher film. A movie truly for hardcore horror and gore fans only and will make viewers, such as myself, who often enjoy a less serious outing really wonder if I want to see a true horror film. (Turns out I do) This film scared me in places and made me look away in joyful disgust in others. It is a film that raises the bar for horror.

On a lighter note let's pretend you are married to a B movie actress whose claim to fame is a brief appearance as an Orion Slave Woman on an episode of The Star Trek spin off series Enterprise (Season 4 Episode 4 Borderland to be exact). She has large breasts but refuses to do a topless scene and she is seemingly challenged in the acting ability department. Oh and if she doesn't star in your next project the audience will not be the only people to be denied a nude scene.

Solution? One brain damaged protagonist coming up.... Some people have trouble getting past the um acting of our star (and directors wife) Bobbi Sue Luther but I think poor acting is as much a part of the slasher genre as the false scare or lame back-story reveal and it good to see it represented here. (Strangely I don't recall a false scare in Laid to Rest and what back-story reveal there actually is turns out to be fairly well done.)

As if to make up for the main lead, the rest of the cast is much better than any slasher film deserves. For one thing they act like a real people would if confronted with such horror. (This is a credit to the script as well; but the cast really does sell this.) Kevin Gage in particular gives a performance that carries the film and what Lena Headey (The queen in 300 and Sarah Conner in the Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles ) is doing in a slasher film like this is a true mystery.

The direction by Robert Hall is also top notch with the ability to create tension and true scares. The real star of this show however is the make-up effects that are simply out of this world and make this worth a look just for that reason. (No cheesy digital blood here)

The only real negatives to the film, outside of Bobbi Sue Luther performance (which isn't really that bad and fits a brain damaged character), is the opening credits and the ending. If you hate quick cuts, shaky cam and techno music all combined together the opening credits will put the fear of God into you. Don't worry it stops as soon as the film proper starts. The ending is simply disappointing on a few levels. Characters act... well out of character, and the whole thing is anti-climatic and gimmicky.

Overall Laid to Rest is an excellent slasher film for those people who like that sort of thing. But be forewarned this is for fans only; if you don't like real horror stay far away.",1265932800,,2762,4.291746641074856

3765838,4,B001QMCJ0U,"I thought the cover looked cool enough to get my attention enough to rent this one. And I expected it to be just another cheap horror movie like so many being made these days, but this one actually does have redeeming value that if a sequel was made, i would definitely check it out. The story is of a girl who wakes up inside a coffin and suffer amnesia, she has no idea who she is, only that a maniac in a chrome skull mask is just outside the door trying to kill her. She escapes the place she is in and winds up getting more people involved as this slasher is after her. It's very much in the same tone as a Jason or Leatherface kind of thing, only it combines elements like what made the old slasher films fun with a modern day incorporation into them. It does not try to focus too much on CGI blood and guts, or over do the whole stupid innocent girl revealing too much of her body & running up stairs sort of thing. It's more a modern day kind of slasher film that involves incorporating a lot of newer technologies such as a mobile phones, use of the internet and video cameras as the killer likes to record himself killing his victims. However it does not go into such depth that it makes it a stupid sci-fi kind of horror.

Some things in the movie where kind of hard to pick up on, but if you listen to the audio commentary they explain a lot of the things you missed, and the 3rd time around watching the movie things fall into place. Except the ending, I won't give it away, but I thought it could have been a bit better drawn out instead if the way it is over in a short frame of time.

The acting is pretty good for a low budget horror flick, none of those annoying half naked bimbos running around trying to out-do all the other scream queens. The film is shot nicely, has a completely believable plot, none of that over the top mysteriousness to it, and nothing really seems to slow the movie down from being entertaining from start to finish. It is a pretty fast paced movie, and should not leave you yawning for the next kill to come along. For gore fans, there is some nice visual effects to be seen here, nothing to me looked like it was done so bad it was funny, or that completely fake looking CGI stuff. Most of the effects where done using a bunch of different elements to give it the best look they could.

It also comes with a few bonus features I was not really thrilled by; 2 featurettes, deleted scenes, bloopers, a trailer and of coarse the audio commentary. For fans of classic slasher films, this one should ne rather enjoyable to watch. Give it a rent at least, and keep in mind it is not meant to be a classic horror movies rip-off, as more just a back to basics type of slasher film with a cool looking killer on the loose. So ignore those reviews or things you hear that it is just another Jason rip off, it may be seen as that, but it's a decent rip-off if you wanna look at it from that point of view.",1255996800,,2940,4.163444639718805

Unfortunately there seems to be a Chromeskull-faced killer (Nick Principe) is after her but two men named Tucker (Kevin Gage) and Steven (Sean Whalen) protect her as they must try to avoid this mad lunatic from butchering them as they must find a way to stop them.

Exciting and very violent slasher horror movie from writer-director-make up artist Robert Hall is a fun popcorn ride for any old school horror fan. It has the feel of those 80's slasher gore-a-thons with the modern touch of violence from the ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" franchises, the make-up effects are very convincing and well done with a small use of CGI and the old school ways. Lena Headly (""300"") co-stars and the acting is not too bad but i do appreciate that this movie has a modern feel to classics like ""Maniac"" and ""My Bloody Valentine"", it's pure grisly fun.

3765840,4,B001QMCJ0U,"I didn't expect a whole lot from this movie but I was nicely surprised.  I wouldn't say it was a classic but it definitely made me feel like I was watching an 80's slasher flick again, but this one really moved without a lot of ""dead"" time.

Most of the 80's slasher flicks start off with a bang, then die out for a while to tell a story, usually just really bad acting for a good 20 - 30 mins (depending on the film) and then we get back to stalking and slashing, this one really didn't do that and started right off from the opening credits.

There were some inherent problems in the film like lack of a real story etc but that's a typical slasher movie, do we really need to have a well woven plot?  Not really in my book, but you better have some good kills along with a decent pace so that I don't just start fast forwarding the flick to get to the good parts.

There is no need in this movie, it opens up with a girl in a coffin and from there a masked killer follows this girl.  She can't remember anything about how she got there or why she is in a morgue to start with.  It's not really until the end that you learn a little more about her but in between all of that there are people that just show up to basically be killed.  The nice thing about this flick is that they really didn't go with the CGI stuff and instead decided to do this with more traditional effects.  That was a smart move and really puts a bit of reality into this film.

Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons as I see them:

Pros
Great Effects
Quick Pacing (not many slow parts)
Good Photography (although I caught the boom mike in a couple of scenes - no big deal there)
Ok Acting
Great 80's throwback slasher flick (much better than the overrated Hatchet - at least to me)

Cons
Not much plot
Characters that do really dumb things, of course
No extras on my DVD that I could find
Implausibility of some of the killing scenes

That's about it, if you want a ride back to the 80's then this is the film for you, if you don't like blood and guts and the 80's slasher style film, move on to something else.",1255478400,,2087,4.0733496332518335
3765851,2,B001QMCJ0U,"Laid to Rest (Robert Hall, 2009)

If you haven't had enough of Jason Voorhees through the twelve (at the moment) Friday the 13th flicks, let me introduce you to Chrome Skull (Nick Principe, who also played the monster guy in Death Row and Sands of Oblivion, both of which I've reviewed previously), who wears a skull mask made of chrome and goes around killing people. If you need to know anything more about this flick, go watch a random Friday the 13th movie; there is nothing whatsoever original about what's on the screen here. Still, it's watchable if you've got nothing better around, and it's amusing in a clunky sort of way (it's certainly better than the majority of the Friday the 13th movies), so despite being wholly derivative, I can't be too hard on it. It did try, at least. * ",1254268800,,792,4.570422535211268
3765852,4,B001QMCJ0U,"Laid To Rest opens with a woman (Bobbi Sue Luther) waking up in a coffin in a morgue with no memory of how she got there or of who she is, only to quickly find herself the target of a blade-wielding killer in a chrome skull mask.  From this promising premise the movie quickly finds itself in some very contrived situations - for example she finds a phone in the mortuary to call 911; not knowing where she is, they have to trace the call and need her to stay on the line for another 30 seconds: as the operator gets to about fifteen, the woman sees something that catches her attention and in a daze wanders over to it still holding the phone.  As the count reaches about 28 or 29 she accidentally pulls the phone unplugged - that kind of thing, and there's more glaringly contrived incidents than that in the first 20 minutes.  So one could be forgiven for thinking the movie isn't going to live up to its potential.  Fortunately, After the first 20 minutes or so, all contrivances abruptly end and the movie quickly forges itself into one of the most original and well-made slashers of the past few years.

  The woman flees the mortuary, totally disoriented, and after stumbling down the middle of a lonely stretch of highway, finds herself picked up by a kind truck driver (Kevin Gage).  He's doubtful of the 'masked killer' story she tells, thinking she's been in some kind of accident and is confused.  In a whole string of contrivances, his truck is running low on gas, the nearest police station or hospital is miles away, and he can only take her home (where their phone isn't working) where he and his wife (Lena Headey from 'Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles') will care for her until morning when the wife's brother is scheduled to show up.  Having made its way through all these unlikely, convenient coincidences through strong execution, it's full steam ahead from there as the coincidences stop and some really inventive turns and developments start coming.  After the chromeskulled assailant invades the isolated country home of the trucker and his wife, it's a chase through the countryside and various 'stops' along the way - a mobile home deep in the forest, a gas station the characters eventually make it to, etc. - as the killer pursues, dispatching different characters as new ones are brought in to join the flight from 'Chrome Skull' (as the end credits refer to him).  Well paced, well made, good special effects, with extremely strong performances all around, especially from Kevin Gage.  Chrome Skull has equiped himself not only with a variety of blades but with a shoulder-mounted camera to record his kills.  Very little of the movie unfolds 'on-camera' in a Blair Witch style, but the camera fits the 'thrillkiller' nature of Chrome Skull, and plays a valuable role in filling in some of the mysterious back story later in the movie, when some of Chrome Skull's intended victims find themselves in possession of the camera an its recordings.

  Among the best slashers of the past few years, bloody and suspenseful with an original villain and likable protagonists, Laid To Rest is a must-see for fans of Friday The 13th, Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street, et al.",1253750400,,3203,4.742342342342343

What we have here is one vicious, ticked-off slasher flick.
One that's not afraid to cut a few throats, and gush it's true colors. (deep shades of red)
So if you love bloodbaths get your luffa ready, because every death is going to be visceral & torrential!
The gore steals the show here.  Every death is a star.
It upstages:
the silly throwaway story where everybody makes the worst possible decisions,
the masked murderer with unspeakable strength who can take a bullet like it was a lead snowflake,
the magma hot heroine with a case of amnesia,
the quintessential character written in to reveal everything in one 2 minute scene,
the needless twist at the end
the anorexic thin plot,
(a woman wakes up in a casket with an annoying case of memory loss.
She is being pursued by a mute behemoth with a Chrome Skull glued (?) to his face,
and a video camera strapped to his shoulder, who guess what, kills anyone in his way.)
Yeah it's your typical slasher
it acts like a slasher,
and chances are it won't make it through a metal detector.
But it doesn't hack like a slasher.
It hacks like a barbarian.

It's an unflinching vision of graphic carnage.
You have to be patient, as the gaps between the great kill scenes feel a little prolonged due to the dumb decisions by the victims.

3765857,3,B001QMCJ0U,"Heavy metal, bad acting, and tons of gore...yep, sounds like a fun slasher/gore film. A woman wakes up in a coffin with no memory of who she is, where she is or what happened to her. She tries to get help, but there is someone after her: a guy in a chrome skull mask that kills everyone she comes in contact with. The killer is unrelentless and unmerciful and also records all the people he kills.

The direction, directed Robert Hall, was not the best and the director kept changing and altering the momentum of the film. The script is horrible (I was expecting nothing less) and entertaining. The acting is bad, of course. The movie stars Bobbi Sue Miller, the director's wife, who apparently just needed a leading role. She drove me crazy at times with her 'i can't remember and I am scare poutty face.'

Overall, it was an ok gore film. But, you don't watch this movie for the acting or directing; rather, you want to watch this movie for the pretty neat and cool makeup effects and gore scenes. Mostly well done, the prosthetics, makeup, etc were all excellent and looked mostly realistic. There were a few instances in which the effort was sub-par (when you remove the knife from a body, the entire skin seemed to come off), but that was the exception.

The extras are even better than the movie. There are deleted scenes and bloopers. There is also a featurette for 'The Making of Laid to Rest' that is a must watch. In this featurette, the cast and crew tell us about the filming, the cast, how they found the locations (they were filming in an abandon hospital at one point and there were child prints on the wall, that alone was spooky!). There is also another pretty good featurette titled 'Torture porn' which is about the makeup effects and the makeup effects supervisor, Erik Porn.",1248566400,,1795,4.5510835913312695

So I'm pretty forgiving with rehashed plots, less than stellar acting and suspension of belief, but seroiusly, I wanted to choke the characters for their stupid stupid decisions. I was think-yelling ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?? GET OUT OF THERE!!"" during much of the movie.

3765859,3,B001QMCJ0U,"I had a hard time rating this movie...I think I was pretty generous giving it three stars.

Lets talk about the good first.  Yes, the film is filled with the red stuff.  Gallons of it, all of the effects are practical.  This is very refreshing since lately it seems like everyone is taking the CGI route.

While some of the characters are very forgettable, the one that's easy to get behind is Tucker.  Without that character I think the movie would be nearly unwatchable.  Another thing to mention is the sets and scenery.  The funeral Home is a very creepy set...Very well done.

Now the bad.  First of all the killer ""Chrome Skull.""  Some horror slashers need very little development...Their mannerisms or look is all that is needed.  This isn't the case here.  Chrome Skull has got to be one of the lamer slashers in the last few years.  Something about the silver skull mask just screams ""Walmart - Halloween isle.""

As I mentioned earlier, a lot of the characters are very forgettable.  Also forgettable is the story, it's typical slasher fare and it brings nothing new to the table...

This film definitely had a lot of potential, but it just fell short.

Don't get me wrong the movie isn't awful, there are a lot of worse films out there...But it's not great either.  It's worth checking out if you can find it cheap enough.",1246838400,,1332,4.591489361702128

3765872,2,B001QMCJ0U,"It's hard to believe that it's been 13 years since 1996's ""That Thing You Do!"" starring Tom Hanks, Liv Tyler and Johnathon Schaech, whose career certainly has not gone in the direction I would've predicted for him back then.  Somehow he's ended up doing slasher films like this one--and if you're buying ""Laid to Rest"" to see him, you will be greatly disappointed.  He's not bad in his role--and he can do a decent Southern accent--but the actor's only onscreen for all of 3 minutes.  I won't give away what happens to his character, but since this is a ""slasher shocker"", well, don't think too hard trying to figure it out.  It just made me sad to see Schaech, who still looks mighty fine, in a movie like this.

I confess I'm not a slasher film fan.  I do like the original ""Halloween"" with former scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis as well as her other scary flicks from back then.  But since I haven't watched any current slasher movies, I thought I would check out ""Laid to Rest"", which is described as having ""the most inventive death scenes in years"".  And this is true.  There's a heckuva lot of bloody, gory violence going on this film--enough to turn anyone's stomach.  So if that's what you're interested in seeing, then this flick's definitely for you.

As for the story of ""Laid to Rest"", it's somewhat intriguing with a young girl waking up inside a casket with a head injury and no memory of her identity.  And for some mysterious reason, there's a crazy killer after her, and, of course, she's in an isolated rural area.  If this film doesn't make you want to move to a safe big city, I don't know what will.  But I have no desire to spend a weekend in the country after watching this movie, which is somewhat predictable.  Our heroine and a few friends move to a new location, where someone gets killed, then they go to another place.  More blood and gore and it continues on in this vicious cycle.

I'm giving ""Laid to Rest"" two stars because of two reasons.  First, I really liked actor Kevin Gage as Tucker, who befriends the young girl.  He's a good actor who gives a much better performance than I would ever expect to find in such a film.  And, second, there is a certain sick and twisted fascination in seeing what horrible situation will happen next and who will survive until the very end.  That's the whole point of slasher flicks--I think.  And ""Laid to Rest"" does this well enough.  Is it as good as the original ""Halloween""?  Hell no.  But if you're looking for a mindless 90 minutes of graphic carnage with some decent gory special effects, maybe you'll get a kick out of ""Laid to Rest"".",1244851200,4,2613,4.485169491525424

The story line exasperates us as she calls the police for help and when she was only 20 seconds away from being detected as to her location, she walks so far away from the wall that she disconnects the phone... talk about getting us upset as to her lack of intelligence.

Kevin Gage and Lena Headey play the roles of a couple that take this unfortunate soul in, only to get involved and have the killer after them.

I love horror films, but slasher flicks are not my preference. Still, I watch them and enjoy many of them. Sounds disturbing to say you enjoy a slasher film, but you know what I mean. Anyway, the majority are too much of the same ol' same ol', especially the current stuff. ""Laid to Rest"" is a special new entry in the subgenre because of the story told about the heroine's search for her identity and the Wizard of Oz-like friendships she forms with those she meets along the way. Add to that the fact that the kills in this movie are unique and nasty (which really does it for a lot of horror fans, though I'm no gorehound myself) and the film is so well-paced, and you've got something that is definitely a cut above the rest. Granted, it still had moments where I felt characters were making bad decisions, but, hey, some people make bad decisions. If you're into the Jason, Michael Myers, etc... types of films, this is worth checking out, and this killer is actually more grounded in reality, so far anyway. It's also fairly unpredictable I'd say. For one thing, anyone is fair game! ""Laid to Rest"" has a great cast with some recognizable faces and fantastic effects for a low-budget film, and the DVD comes through well too with commentary from lead actress Bobbi Sue Luther and writer/director/husband Robert Hall, the film's trailer, a great behind the scenes featurette, an effects featurette, a blooper reel and deleted scenes.

I was very impressed with that film and have since watched quit a few older and recent slasher films.  So, it was with great anticipation that I ordered this film.  Due to my over purchasing of DVDs, I only now got around to watching ""Laid to Rest (Unrated Director's Cut).""

I knew nothing about ""Laid to Rest (Unrated Director's Cut),"" beyond the description provided by Amazon, when I ordered it.  But based upon the description I thought the movie would be exceptional.  Alas, from my perspective, ""Laid to Rest (Unrated Director's Cut)"" is hardly ""A gory, wicked, merciless piece of Horror Cinema.""  And, from my viewing of the movie, the description provided is somewhat inaccurate; (I will explain below for those who don't mind reading ""spoiler"" content).

To begin with, the film is essentially a blending of ideas freely borrowed from other films, most particularly the hockey-masked killer Jason Voorhees in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Uncut-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B001K9OXDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th Uncut (Deluxe Edition)</a>&nbsp;and the use of a camera by the killer similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>.  Second, the acting by Bobbi Sue Luther (also a producer) as The Girl is sadly droll, if not pathetic--even for a B movie.  Indeed, based upon the commentary and bonus features, along with the production credits, ""Laid to Rest (Unrated Director's Cut)"" is more of a home movie made by a group of buddies out to have a good time rather than make a movie.  Third, I found the plot--what little there is--downright boring.  I frequently found myself saying, ""hey I saw that on a 'Buffy the Vampire' or that's from a 'X-Files' or 'Pretender"" episode!""  Fourth, there are numerous production continuity errors in the film.  For example, in a scene about twenty minutes into the movie, a young woman is sitting in a car.  As her husband leans in to talk to her, he gets stabbed in the face. Her face is sprayed with blood by this, but a few seconds later there is hardly any blood on her face; (see spoiler for other examples).

The saving grace for ""Laid to Rest (Unrated Director's Cut)"" is the Cinematography by Scott Winig and the performance of Kevin Gage, as Tucker.  Many of the scenes are beautifully shot (although the editor frequently ruined them) by Winig.  And Gage was the only actor who seemed to try and give life to the film.  Combined, these two factors have lifted this film from a two to a three star film.

SPOILER WARNING!

The description given for the film is: ""A terrifying story of a young girl who wakes up in a casket with a traumatic head injury and no memory of her identity. She quickly realizes she was abducted by a deranged serial murder and must survive the night and outsmart the technologically inclined killer who is hell bent on finishing what he started.""  I saw nothing that terrified me; the woman was no ""girl""; nothing happens quickly--especially The Girl realizing anything--in what I consider a slow paced film; there is no mention of needing to survive the night; and the ""Lurch-like"" (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Addams-Family-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000V3JGIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Addams Family - The Complete Series</a>) performance by Nick Principe as Chrome Skull, while occasionally outsmarting the others, showed no technological inclination unless using a camera and a cell phone count!

Instead, the movie starts out with The Girl waking up in a coffin (the description got this right) only to become laughably ""hysterical,"" which rocks the coffin of the stand and popping it open.  Free of the coffin, The Girl for inexplicable reason can't open any of the exits (for the moment), but manages to ""lock"" herself in a room/freezer where she watches the mortician being killed by Chrome Skull.  As the killer tries to get in, she mysteriously finds an exit and runs away.  As The Girl walks down a road, Tucker stops to help her.  Tucker takes her home because he doesn't have much gas (or at least until morning, when his cousin is due to arrive).  The Girl can't remember who she is, or how she got in ""the box"" (better known as a coffin!), let alone where she is from or where ""the box"" if located.

Chrome Skull manages to find them at Tucker's home, killing Tucker's wife.  Tucker and The Girl escape in the car (that now has a little more gas).  They end up at Steven's house, where Tucker, after Steven emails the sheriff (because, like Tucker, Steven has no phone), discovers information on-line about a serial killer that uses a camera to film his kills.  Tucker and Steven also find a missing persons report on The Girl--but don't bother to tell her.  Tucker goes back to his place to get his pistol, but fails to see that his cousin and his cousin's wife, who arrived early, have been killed by Chrome Skull.  They then decide to take Steven's car, but stop at the mortuary when The Girl recognizes it.  There they find many of Chrome Skull's victims, including Steven's grandmother.  After a go-around with Chrome Skull, they end up in Chrome Skull's vehicle and find his tapes.  The Girl starts to watch the tapes, but the battery dies, so she leaves, without Tucker and Steven, to go to the store--even though she doesn't even know where she it!  Eventually, she watches the tape of herself being ""killed"" by Chrome Skull (this is ""quickly discovering""?) as well as learning that she is a prostitute; (the significance of this is never explained).  (One can assume at this point that all have figured out that Chrome Skull is hounding them because his ""fatal"" blow to The Girl's head--which has been bleeding--did not actually kill her; something the arrogant Chrome Skull is not willing to allow).

Finally the ""show down"" arrives, but anti-climatically, Chrome Skull accidentally kills himself while using a corrosive Steven put in the glue container that Chrome Skull uses to glue his mask back on when it starts to come off during the confrontation.  The result is a sizzling face for Chrome Skull, and death.

Least you conclude, based upon my description, that this sounds much more action packed than I claim above, I feel I have actually spiced up the story in my spoiler.  Then again, I tend to have very high standards and expectations, and, more importantly, one person's great is another person's so-so.  In the end, because I feel this is a three star movie, and if you like this genre, I think you should watch it for yourself.

Soon they are all being chased by a villain named Chromeskull who wants them dead.

He wears a videocamera on his shoulder and videotapes his killings.- That's it.

Low budget, decent gore, no rhyme or reason to anything- just killings, average acting and heavy metal music.

It wasn't so bad that I would rate it below a 3 because it was entertaining to a certain degree. Mindless entertainment- you most likely won't remember this as a ""great"" horror film, you will probably not think of watching it again.

I am somewhat a fan of writer/director Robert Hall's previous work, Lightning Bug, so my expectations were up a bit.  As a director, I think he's got a solid future ahead of him.  Pacing was good, storytelling fine, and the kills were mostly top rate.  The main problem with Laid to Rest is with the writing.  I don't set the bar too high when it comes to low budget horror, but there were too many lapses of logic.  At one time or another, each of the characters make some head scratching decisions.  Maybe a co-writer might have thrown out a few ""Why is he/she doing that?"" that would have cleaned things up a bit.  The top notch kills and engaging characters and story allow me to forgive the logic lapses and recommend Laid to Rest with a respectable 3 1/2 stars.",1242691200,,870,4.3602484472049685

The story of a girl trying to discover who she is as a murdurer comes after her, and takes a few characters in some very creative manners, has yet to be topped in what I have seen in theatre. The one thing that gives this picture its best feel is the way it is photographed, and thats direct to digital. The directors conscience use , and in fact pre-plan that every FX would be 50% practical and 50% CGI made the shots work, and with a low budget they worked well in a way that surprised even me. Since eveything is shot digitally, then altering things is both very fast, and
very low cost.
As near as I could tell, about the only thing they had to avoid saying was how much  Chrome-Head resembled the broad design of a Predator, and then they are fine.
Like Ac/DC said, If you want Blood, then You got it... and this has it in droves. The latex body count is surprisingly good.
The DVD is a wild piece of fun. The Postmortem ""Making of feature"" is mostly good, with some choice cuts. The commentary is mostly film school stuff and boring. The Deleted Scenes and Bloopers have the usual bunch of fun material, except that this seems to have a lot more.
Excellent for a film under one Million dollar budget.",1242172800,,1321,4.305220883534137
3765892,2,B001QMCJ0U,Laid to Rest is a flashy and gore filled horror film starring the very attractive Bobbi Sue Luther.  If you're a fan of hers then you might enjoy this film more than the average horror fan.  Other than that you might be turned off by the music video style editing and the nonsensical plot. I some scenes it felt as if I might need a seat belt because of the camera movement.  I hope to see Bobbi Sue and her new look in more films.  She has what it takes to be a horror star.  I just wished that she would find a better film to showcase her talents in.  The extras are nice but at times they can be very self indulgent.,1242172800,,619,3.991869918699187
3765893,3,B001QMCJ0U,"""I woke up... in a dead box... And the man tried to get me.""

LAID TO REST: Bobbi Sue Luther plays a girl who wakes up sealed in a casket. Suffering from head trauma and memory loss, the girl soon finds herself running from a frightening figure in a metal skull mask with a video camera propped on his shoulder and wielding a scary big honking knife. Fleeing the funeral home, the girl does get help from several helpful strangers, but really that means fudge-all when it's an unstoppable killer hunting you down. So cue the vicious slashing, pour out the viscera, tally up the body count. Can the girl survive the night?

Okay, first, if you can get thru the exasperating opening sequence - in which the clearly disoriented girl actually has the sense to call 911 but then inadvertently causes the phone to disconnect before the dispatcher can trace the call - then you're in for a decent scarefest. During the Unholy Writers' Strike of 2007, f/x makeup artist Robert Hall put in the time to write the story to LAID TO REST and the result is fairly watchable stuff. I also dig that the atmosphere at times leaned towards the quirky (mostly in the scenes with Sean Whalen). The horror genre tropes are well covered, but the solid execution and the inclusion of several nice character moments elevate this one. The key players have more depth than are usually given in slasher flicks, although it's a bit jarring to see Kevin Gage landing the ""good guy"" part for once (and a ""gutted good guy with a cane"" part, at that; when I say ""gutted"" it's meant that he suffers a devastating loss, not that he has his guts spill out; that happens to someone else). Sean Whalen, the odd nerd crippled by his grief over his recently dead mother, resembles Steve Buscemi so closely it's as if Steve Buscemi had gotten it on with, er, Steve Buscemi. The ancillary characters, of course, are stock meat puppets. And with Lena Headey and Thomas Dekker having small roles, it also feels a bit like a TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES reunion (Bobbi Sue Luther herself actually had a cameo in that show's ""Goodbye to All That"" episode).

Credit to LAID TO REST for looking as good as it does, considering this is only Robert Hall's second directing gig and that there wasn't a lot of money that went into the film. The location reflects this shoestring budget. The story takes place in an isolated rural town and its surroundings (the city is a hundred miles away), an ideal kill zone for the freak in the silver skull mask. There's an undertone of mystery percolating in the film. I like that there's no backstory introduced for the serial killer Chrome Skull. Sometimes I think it's more disturbing and effective when we don't learn the underpinnings to a guy's deranged traits.

To quote Sean Whalen in an interview: ""It's more of a mystery, too, because she's trying to figure out who she is, and why she's so hot."" Another thing which keeps us hanging on is that we don't learn the identity of the girl until near the very end. Bobbi Sue Luther, in real life the director's wife and also this film's co-producer, is the lead actress in LAID TO REST and, while she doesn't quite sidestep the conventions of her girl victim role, she manages to weave in elements of pluck and emotional range. But, yes, she does her share of running around in a panic, screaming and crying and bleeding but looking good throughout. In fact, it's a wise move that for most of the film she's wearing a large shapeless shirt; otherwise, the male audience would've been too distracted (I know I would've been). Chrome Skull, who tends to occasionally have blood leak out of his eye (or eye socket), is a terrifying presence, a nightmarish monster I'd rank just a few tiers below horror icons like Freddy, Pinhead and Jason Vorhees. The silent Chrome Skull, technologically savvy (he records his kills) and able to throw off injuries like they were tickles, is solid as a Big Bad, but he needs to be in more movies to merit a higher level of cult status.

Gore hounds will drool over the gratuitous kill scenes, some of which are gruesome and graphic indeedy. Particular standouts are the first kill (halfway out the window), the ""Baby, I would never cheat on you. And I never have - Shuuunk!"" moment, and the tire sealant scene.

There are moments of frustration; in low budget horror films, that's almost a trope. But three sequences really annoyed me. There's the aforementioned opening scene with the 911 call. And, later, the girl leaves her comrades-in-peril and takes off on her own, because she just had to get batteries for the video camera. And she takes off driving the killer's car with the built-in GPS navigational/tracking device. And, lastly, while there's a touch of irony in how the killer gets his, it really comes off as anticlimactic.

The DVD comes with not half bad bonus features: interesting hubby & wife audio commentary by writer/director Robert Hall and actor/producer Bobbi Sue Luther; the in-depth ""Postmortem: The Making Of"" featurette (31 minutes); ""Torture: The SFX of LAID TO REST"" (7:36 minutes) - the special effects crew go into how they blended digital effects with old-school prosthetics and make-up; 4 mostly blah deleted scenes, with the first one being a hilarious must-see; bloopers (7:42); and the trailer.

The story itself isn't remarkable, the pacing tends to drag at times, and there are moments of camp and cheese. But, overall, LAID TO REST is a fair splatterfest, with good performances, brutal bloodletting, and several iconic shots of the menacing Chrome Skull. I wouldn't be surprised if Chrome Skull reappears somewhere down the line, looking to maim and butcher and film his ""little piggies"" for some sick sort of prosperity - although I'm pretty sure Robert Hall was effing around when he said the sequel will probably be called LAID TO REST 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO.",1241913600,3,5887,4.7421875
3765894,2,B001QMCJ0U,"I have to think that only the most depraved minds would invent this movie or watch it intentionally. Several throats get cut on screen, a guy's face gets sliced off in front of his girlfriend, one head gets cut off, another gets impaled with a pick axe, another guy's head is blown off with his own shotgun, another head is blown up with Fix-A-Flat. For a grand finale, a face gets torn off (in graphic detail) and a head bashed in with a baseball bat.

Sound like a good time? Didn't think so. Truly a disgusting movie. What's wrong with people these days? Anyway, just had to get that off my chest. Don't get me wrong, I like a certain amount of horror (good zombie movies can be fun, or the Nightmare on Elm Street series). But it seems like there are certain lines of ""good taste"" and/or realism that just shouldn't be crossed. I think Laid to Rest crosses most all of them.

That said, if you want to know more generally about the movie, it's a not-so-pretty horror/slasher flick. More or less a guy in a form-fitting metal mask goes around hacking people up in extremely graphic ways. He seems to be hunting down one girl ""who got away"" in particular. Only problem is, she apparently doesn't remember who she is or how she got to be where she's at. Unfortunately, we really don't learn much about her except a short snippet from one of the videos tapes the killer likes making.

We also learn approximately nothing about the killer himself. Who he is, why he kills, what his stake in all this is other than that he apparently likes terrorizing and then killing people in varied gruesome ways. He has no backstory.

We also learn little about the various random characters thrown under the bus (so-to-speak) except that they're morons who couldn't find their way out of a paper sack to save their lives. All they seem to do is run, scream, fall over, sit down, cry, faint and/or die. The one guy with a shotgun pointed at the killer, well, I guess we already know what happens to him... I mean, are these people just brain-dead, or what?

As far as features go, it offers commentary, some standard ""making-of"" fare, deleted scenes and bloopers. Can the extra make up for the horrid movie? I'd tend to say no.

Does the movie push the envelope at all? Only in ratcheting up the amount of gore possible on screen in a given movie. Otherwise, the guy-in-a-mask slasher genre has been ""done to death"" more-or-less and this adds little more than an extra bucket of blood in the ocean.

I don't think I'll be recommending this to, well, ANYone...",1241740800,,2545,4.519565217391304
3765895,3,B001QMCJ0U,"Laid to Rest wasn't really the best thing I have seen in a long time. It was pretty contrived and the plot was basically non-existant. The film quality is pretty ""late night-cinemax softcore porn"" and the acting is sub-par. I was even shocked to see Lena Headey (Sarah Conner Chronicles, The 300), who I normally think is fairly talented, give such a weak peformance.

  The basic plot revolves around a girl who wakes up in a coffin, not knowing who she is or where she is from. All she knows is that a crazed killer in a metal death-skeletor face mask is after her. She winds up finding refuge with a simple, but kindly couple (Headey and her husband-not sure what the actors name is) and the nightmare continues. Pretty basic slasher flick here. The faceless killer (who has a pretty wicked ride) stalks the unknowing southern redneck types and slaughters them in really nasty ways.

  The one thing going for this movie was the blood and gore. If you like that kind of thing...check this out. If not, pass it up. The gore-factor isn't done in a very realistic way-it goes for what I refer to as the 'Hatchet' movie-gore method. It's all over-the-top, splattery, gross-out gore. We're talking heads chopped in half, intestines slithering out of a running victim like snakes coiling out of a nest, throats slashed open viciously and much more. It's a pretty bloody flick.

  My biggest problem would be with the overall lack of actual substance to the film. By the end of the movie I still had no idea who or what the killers motives were. I understood the basics of what he was doing...but, he had no backstory and to me, this just felt like something a 14 year old could write.

3765896,4,B001QMCJ0U,"In a market glutted with similar product LAID TO REST manages to claw its way out of the slasher/torture gore pack with it's genuine sense of invention and desperation.  The setup is strong and makes for an engaging viewing experience at first, the film then takes us for a bit of a ride with nice extra touches and turns throughout that reward the focused viewer.  Fans of non CG blls out gore will get their fill here, but I found the story, editing, and performances outlasted the overdone FX eventually. One of the few extras seems to label this flick as torture/porn but the few true ""gorno"" shots don't really amount to the kind of twisted relentless bloodletting we have seen lately in other gratuity like BROKEN or even HOSTEL2. This is a modern stalker story with a mask killer bent that serves up the goods, but only for those with a taste for big knives and Karo syrup.",1241481600,,880,4.528301886792453
3765897,4,B001QMCJ0U,"Nowadays horror movies are either hit or miss, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  Nevertheless the cover of this DVD, a metal skull with two blades seemed pretty alluring, so I decided to give it a shot.

The plot of the movie is rather simplistic; a young woman (played by the very pretty Bobbi Sue Luther) wakes up in a casket in a funeral home. The casket is locked and she manages to break herself out, only to discover she can't recall who she is.  What she soon discovers is that she is being stalked by a serial killer who is dressed in all black and has a metal skull mask on his face.  Hence the serial killer's name Chrome-Skull.

This amnesic girl, who ends up being called Princess, not worth explaining right now, manages to gain some support/help from two other people in this movie.  The way she is able to bring two guys along to help her escape a metal faced serial killer is nothing short of a ""Wizard of Oz"" comparison.  This produces some creepy and interesting mishaps.

""Laid to Rest"" didn't reinvent the wheel on the slasher/horror movie genre.  In contrast, it follows the ""scary movie stereotypes"" to a ""T"", for instance why do people still split up, or why is it always so hard to find a working telephone (or in this movie, cell phone), there is also no explanation whatsoever why ""Chrome-Skull"" loves video taping the macabre.

Therefore if this movie is taken a face value, it is a great viewing experience. Mainly because it doesn't try to be anything it is not. There is plenty of gore, violence, brief nudity, creepy situations as well as funny ones.  Another thing about this movie that is great is it isn't slow paced.  Once the movie starts, there really isn't any lagging with the action.  As for the acting, it really isn't that bad.  I have seen a whole lot worse.  Oh look for Richard Lynch, B movie hero, in a very, very small role.

I feel that for a modern horror movie, this was pretty darn good.  I dare to say that it might even have ""multiple viewing"" capabilities.  The DVD has a bunch of extras on it, which is always a plus.  One of these extras is a mess of trailers/previews for other horror movies, great stuff. So wait until the night arrives, turn off the lights, grab a snack and spend the night with Chrome-Skull.",1241395200,5,2268,4.447941888619854
3765898,4,B001QMCJ0U,"Okay, let's face it: If you're thinking about watching a horror movie in the slasher subcategory, you're not searching for a think-piece on the dangers of unresolved Oedipal complexes. You're not looking for a movie to challenge your way of thinking. You watch these movies for lots of killing, bad acting, and the plot, well...is there ever really a plot?

It'd be easy to say that Laid to Rest is another dime-a-dozen slasher movie, another entry into a misogynist genre that's been overdone since the late 1980's...but that would ignore the vast efforts put into it by the director, his wife, the cast, and the crew.

The Director: Robert Hall, owner of the special effects company Almost Human, made this film for two reasons. He wanted to make his first horror movie, and his wife needed her first starring role.

The Lead: Bobbi Sue Luther, to me, is known for her role in Star Trek: Enterprise as a green-skinned Orion Slave Girl. She's been in countless men's magazines, and even became the face of St. Pauli Girl beer in 2007. She also co-produced this movie.

The Film:

The movie starts off with a heavy metal riff, and we see an MTV-video style montage of young nubile women getting sliced up in various ways. We see events from the aspect of ""The Girl"", a young woman who wakes up in a coffin with no memory of who she is or how she got there. Over the course of this horrifying night she forms an alliance with two men, Tucker and Stephen, who do their best to protect her from our unrelenting antagonist, a killer known as Chrome Skull.

I was expecting a slaughter-fest, and I was not disappointed. Chrome Skull got to use a variety of weapons: a steel rod, a shotgun, tire sealant, and of course, his trademark brass knuckle knives. The most vicious kill in the film, by far, is the one against Lena Headey's character Cindy.  I was COMPLETELY unprepared for her facial reaction...the knife twists in her temple, her mouth opens and her eyes dart about. As the knife comes out, her right eye is completely bloodshot. I'm used to special effects that cut away and take the cheap way out, but this put it right in my FACE. Bravo!

I got a case of the giggles whenever Chrome Skull came on screen - he looked like Timothy Olyphant from Hitman with a shoulder camera he borrowed from The Predator. That probably wasn't Robert Hall's intention, but it made Chrome Skull a memorable character for me, whether scary or not.

Some things irritated me during this movie, such as the editor's quick-cuts. I'd see a full segment of Chrome Skull killing someone, but if I blinked, I'd miss the 13 clips pasted together of him getting stabbed in the eye at the mortuary (yes, I counted). The dialogue from most of the characters was pretty bad, but then again, I wasn't expecting a David Mamet film.

The ending was a pleasant surprise, giving me some answers but begging more questions. Usually I keep my brain turned off during a slasher film but this one made me switch it on at the end. How diabolical of you, Robert Hall!

DVD Treatment: At the beginning of Laid to Rest, there are a few movie ads:

(1) Lightning Bug (Robert Hall's directorial debut)
(2) The Alphabet Killer (Directed by Rob Schmidt, who directed Wrong Turn)
(3) Crowley (Known as ""Chemical Wedding"" outside of the U.S.)
(4) Tokyo Zombie

How about them Extras? Well, there's a lot to be found here:

(1) Commentary track with Bobbi Sue Luther and her husband Robert Hall - Robert never tries to hide the fact that he's making a slasher film and doesn't try to build it up to be more than it is. The commentary focuses on him and his wife being able to make a movie with a core group of friends and a non-existent budget. I enjoyed hearing their stories about the use of ""Smash! Plastic"", the difficulties of a few interior window scenes, and the kindness of Cookie Moreland, among others. The bit about filming in houses with black mold was kind of creepy, though.

(2) The Making of Laid to Rest - We get a brief interview of each character in the movie, and several crew members. Everyone shares their serious and goofy sides while discussing the film. Thomas Dekker even got to compose some music!

(3) Torture Porn - the SFX of Laid to Rest - No, this isn't a segment about Eli Roth: the makeup effects supervisor is named Erik Porn. He showcases the creation of Chrome Skull, the bodies in the film, various head molds for special effects, and more.

(4) Deleted Scenes - I loved the intro with Nick Principe doing Roy Batty's speech from Blade Runner, but this could have gone in the bloopers section. There are only a couple of scenes here - nothing to write home about.

(5) Bloopers - A typical blooper reel, everyone looks like they're enjoying themselves and not getting frustrated.

(6) Trailer - The trailer that piqued my interest in this movie!

You might think independent horror movies are a waste of time, but remember: a filmmaker named Sam Raimi started out shooting low budget horror movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Evil-Dead/dp/B00005RYLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Evil Dead</a>, and he's now making multi-million dollar movies about some teenager in Queens who got bit by a spider or something.

I give it three stars because of the terrific job done with makeup, gore and special effects... yes, it is all great.

But at the same time, the screenplay is pedestrian and one would hope the investment made in gore would be matched by a great screenplay and an inventive hour and a half of storytelling. That is the problem here because this film could have been a new classic.

3765900,3,B001QMCJ0U,"A girl wakes up in a coffin.  After breaking out, she finds herself stalked by a killer, Chrome Skull - he wears a chrome faceplate.  She meets up with a couple of people, one a down-to-earth good-old-boy, the other a helpless computer nerd.  Together they're chased around for the remainder of the movie, encountering a fairly large quantity of gory deaths.

This movie maintains a pretty good level of suspense and excitement.  The characters have well developed personalities and are fairly sympathetic.  And if you're a fan of gore, you'll be more than satisfied with the quantity as well as the quality.  If you're a fan of T&A, sorry.  Blink and you'll miss it.  On the bad side, the killer is really undeveloped.  He has no real backstory, and we don't see him as having any special connection to his victims.  One big negative is that the characters are constantly acting in the stupidest manner possible.  The main girl has amnesia, but even considering that, she seems almost borderline retarded.  For instance, instead of talking about people being killed, she talks about them being made dead.  This makes it pretty hard to relate to her.  And her two companions manage to make one stupid decision after another as well.

So, we've got some good points and some bad.  It adds up to a fairly average rating.  I think this will mainly appeal to fans of gore.  Those of us who like a more developed plot with characters we can really feel for will be left moderately disappointed.",1240963200,,1489,4.723735408560311
3765911,4,B001QMCJ0U,"Robert Hall's ""Laid To Rest"" is a visceral, scary, take-no-prisoners horror movie.  Proceed at your own risk.  We're not talking a movie that's worth seeing because of funny, unintended shortcomings or a so-bad-it's-good vibe, or anything like that.  No, this is a gutsy, intense, feature-length nightmare, bolstered by decent acting, characters with some depth (no slick Abercrombie & Fitch teens in sight), and solid direction.

The gore is frequent, bloody, and intense, but- like George Romero's best movies- not used randomly but at the best possible moments for maximum impact.  For a production shot on high-definition video, the look of the film is top notch: grim, shadow-rich, but always sharp.  Some may object to the simple, pared-down plot that's more interested in relentless forward motion rather than delivering twists, unexpected developments, or other complications, but I liked it just fine.  Sometimes you need a focused, four-on-the-floor, ""THIS is chasing THAT"" movie experience (remember Spielberg's ""Duel"", which people are still talking about more than thirty years later?), and ""Laid To Rest"" gives you a memorable creep-o-zoid doing the chasing and a likable group of poor victims fulfilling the unfortunate role of the chased.

Not to be missed for fans of hardcore horror, especially those who realize that the genre shouldn't be one where we have to expect shoddy, slapdash work, and minimal genuine talent.  The DVD offers the added bonus of lots of extra features, but those are just gravy.  Get this for the nightmare of a movie, which I mean in the best sense.",1240963200,,1594,5.24015748031496
3765912,2,B001QMCJ0U,"Being buried alive would suck. However, escaping premature burial only to discover that someone wants to chop you up into itty bitty pieces would suck even more. That's the gist of Robert Hall's Laid to Rest an ultra-violent exercise in stupidity that exudes incompetence every step of the way.

Alright, so there's this ""Girl"" (Bobbi Sue Luther), and she wakes up in a coffin with no memory of who she is or how she ended up in a coffin. The only problem is that there's also this chrome-faced lunatic with a camera on his shoulder who wants to kill her. Usually I would devote another sentence to summarizing the film, but that's really all you need to know.

Actually, you also need to know that Laid to Rest expects you to suspend your disbelief more than most slashers of its ilk. Take for example our plucky hero, who probably landed the lead role because she bankrolled the picture (Luther has an Executive Producer credit on the film). Director Hall expects you to believe that ""The Girl"" lost, along with all the memories of her identity, the ability to understand how phones work. Marvel as she pulls a phone cord out of its socket then continues to talk into the receiver like an idiot. Also, gaze in awe as a masked psycho who can't be killed by bullets gets taken out by medical-grade skin adhesive. The killer's gimmick is that he wears a DV camcorder on his shoulder, which he uses to record all of his exploits. You'd expect the director to use this motif to create a ""snuff film"" effect, but you'd be wrong. Not once do we see a murder take place through the lens of the killer's camcorder. Why even bother including the plot device?

The music is also godawful, and I know exactly who to blame thanks to a shout-out in the opening credits. I won't even get into the irony of trying to break a band that sounds exactly like Disturbed, Godsmack, or one of the myriad cookie-cutter faux-metal acts on Clear Channel radio.

The film's only bright spot is Lena Headey, who probably logged her ten minutes in this film as a favor to a friend of a friend. There's absolutely no reason for an A-list actress to star alongside this rogue's gallery of no-name ""talent.""

It's tough being a horror fan these days. Most recent releases cater to the lowest common denominator - the kind of beer-swilling retard who claps his hand together like a seal and points at the movie screen, shouting, ""Look! The killer just cut that dude's head off, and his tongue's still there!"" That's not horror, folks - that's gore - and if you can't tell the difference, well, Robert Hall just made a groundbreaking movie for you.",1240876800,,2616,4.581196581196581

I was excited about The Sarah Connor Chronicles connection, although that was tempered pretty quickly.  The movie isn't all that exciting, and it doesn't set the right mood to make up for its shortcomings.  I'd avoid this one.",1240790400,,337,4.775862068965517
3765914,4,B001QMCJ0U,"This is one graphic horror movie.  I've seen a LOT of horror movies and very few if any come close to this.  As you can see I rated this movie good and I did enjoy it, however I strongly advise that if you have a weak stomach you think twice about watching this.  It's far from something along the lines of Friday the 13th, or even Hellraiser.....Laid to Rest is much, much more bloodier.  Many may wish to watch this in the daytime or with the lights on bright.

Now on to the movie.....

The idea of behind the movie is simple horror.  Waking up in a sealed casket, not being able to remember anything (not your name, where you are, etc.).  Without giving much away, the killer uses sharp objects in killing.  And naturally there is a lot of screaming and blood.

One thing that bothered me is that a few of the scenes are a bit far fetched in the way that too many things go wrong as in one after another, then you start thinking what else is going to happen. Now I can see why the writers did this (as you will also).  I really can't write more or else it'll be a spoiler.

Otherwise, if they could of gotten away from that it would of been a five star movie. But even with that, it's still a horror movie to see (and a true horror movie it is)!!!",1240790400,,1251,4.102880658436214
3765915,3,B001QMCJ0U,"While 'Laid To Rest' doesn't add anything new to the genre, it does deliver in terms of tension and stylish gore! The killing machine in this film, ""Cromeskull"" will bring you back to the glory days of Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. While nowhere near as good as the original Halloween film, this film is certainly better than the worst films in all of those franchises.

The cast is way better than most for this type of film, with the exception of the lead female character, which I found a little dull. Gore-Hounds should be happy with this one as the death scenes are very graphic and look very convincing! This is not for the squeamish!

This film also has a interesting story line which will keep you interested for the most part, but the film does have it's flaws. We never really understand why the killer is doing this and some of the victims do the stupidest things, but as a new ""slasher"" film, this one's got some style and it's better than most of what's come out lately.

The DVD transfer looks very good and there are some decent extras to check out. If you keep you expectations low, you shouldn't be disappointed.",1240790400,,1149,4.541062801932367
3765916,4,B001QMCJ0U,"Laid To Rest is supposed to be both a throwback to the golden age of slasher films(the 80s, ya know), and also a new spin on the genre.  Well, don't go expecting a new spin.  With the billions of horror films out there, and genre crossovers, I doubt today's audiences can really be surprised or impressed all that much anymore.  Not to mention that this is indeed the slasher genre and there are limitations to that, like it or not.  So, no, Laid To Rest isn't gonna give you something you haven't seen before in another film at some time.  Nor does it seem to me to be much like a throwback attempt(but doesn't every horror film that comes out anymore claim that it is?).  Wallowing through the mire of ""oldschool"" styled horror movies, I tend to get confused as to what was a good attempt or what was a lousy one.
But even though I sound crabby, I enjoyed Laid To Rest.  It's a simple story of a woman's grueling night trying to elude a masked maniac.  From her awakening in a casket, through numerous situations and characters she meets, ""Princess"" is pursued all night by Chromeskull, a bald, masked psycho that dresses sharp(coz every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man) and carries a briefcase.  He also wields a nasty looking knife and has a video camera on his shoulder.  He doesn't seem so much interested in flat out killing Princess as much as he is relentlessly stalking and terrorizing her, and killing everyone she comes in contact with.  Almost like the killer in Dario Argento's Opera.  His motivations are never quite clear, but why should they be?  I like this, and I also like the fact that Chromeskull's identity and background are pretty much kept in the dark.  In fact, Princess's history and identity are barely touched down upon.  Chromeskull has a cool look and suave personality, but I don't think he's gonna reach the iconic heights of the legendary slasher film heroes.  Hell, in the straight to video market there are just too many slasher characters to keep track of anymore!
The film begins with that annoying herky jerky camera work that infests films today, but to my surprise and delight, it was abandoned fairly quickly.  Horror fans should keep their eyes open for cult fave Richard Lynch in a tiny role(much tinier than he shoulda had if you ask me).  The movie is also quite gory.  It's advertised as having gruesome and creative deaths, but don't get too excited.  Gruesome, yes.  Horror fans will dig it, but those weened on Italian horror won't be shocked.  Some of them are indeed creative.  But Chromeskull's death, while gruesome and creative, is also rather dumb.
The DVD has two informative documentaries and a funny blooper reel.  There's also a commentary but I didn't listen to that yet.
All in all, horror fans will want to check this one one out.  These days are very,very bad for the horror genre, and it seems as though anything of entertainment value anymore is found in the straight to video market.  But even that market is producing more stinkers than ever.  So, a film like Laid To Rest is welcome.  It may not be the best film you ever see, it may not restore your faith, but for 90 minutes you'll catch a few glimpses of what made you a horror fan to begin with.",1240704000,,3226,4.5828970331588135
3765917,3,B001QMCJ0U,"""Princess"" wakes up in a coffin. She can't remember who she is or why she's there. All she knows is that, once she escaped, some psycho in a chromed skull mask gored the mortician and is after her. And Chrome Skull is one determined serial killer. Whatever backwoods burg he brought her to, there aren't any police for miles and the phone service hasn't been upgraded for a couple of decades, so ""Princess"" has to survive until dawn if she wants to live.

That is the whole plot of ""Laid To Rest."" There's no background for her, Chrome Skull or much else, making this a chase flick, and a slightly better than average one. ""Princess"" races through the woods with helpers she crosses on the way, trying to evade Chrome Skull and his collection of super-sharp killing knives. CS may not have much of a background, but my guess is writer/director Robert Hall is saving depth for sequels or prequels (CS leaves behind a box of prior murders and an Internet search hints that he's on the FBI's list).

It makes your ability to believe ""Laid To Rest"" hinge on the acting, which is fair. Bobbi Sue Luther does well as the terrified girl on the run from Chrome Skull and Kevin Gage is the best actor here, playing the big hearted southern lug Tucker. Chrome Skull makes a good action figure and drives a wicked car with a vanity plate (nice touch). There aren't too many other characters, and they are little more the meat for the grinder. Sean Whalen does a good Steve Buscemi, as well.

The grinding of bones and flesh is also old school, so if you miss the realistic spewing of gore, ""Laid To Rest"" should cover your bases. What is lacking is any sort of logic, as Chrome Skull just seems to be on a meaningless killing spree. The barn full of corpses does get a slight explanation, as does who ""Princess"" is and just maybe why Chrome Skull chose her as a victim. However, ""Laid To Rest"" feels like it was ripped out of another story and we're being dropped into the middle of it. Should Hall get the opportunity to make CS into an ongoing characther, ""Laid To Rest"" might just be a chapter in a saga, bit alone, it is a just better than average scare flick.",1240704000,,2153,4.431818181818182
3765918,5,B001QMCJ0U,"I gave this DVD a five-star rating because it gives the viewer exactly what they would expect....HORROR......and isn't that the whole reason behind a movie such as this?
I have to say that this movie was horrible for me,but I am not a horror movie fan. However for those who love lots of blood and all the gore that comes with it, you will love it, because it delivers.
  It starts off with a young girl  waking up in a casket with no memory of who she is or how she got there.  Realizing someone wants her dead her race begins to, shall we say, keep her head on, as a killer, cloaked in a chrome skull, is determined to finish his job of ending her life. Yes, we have a serial killer, who is totally insane and does exactly what you would expect him to do, kill people in gross, gory, bloody ways, as only  a truly demon possessed person could do.
This movie has some scenes that will definitely make your hair stand up on your head, make you cover your eyes, gasp, and make sure the door is locked ( not sure that would do any good though).  I believe it will deliver what any horror fan is looking for, blood, guts, and gore, and probably more.
  The acting is good, visual- very true to life - ! Again, I am sure any horror fan will absolutely devour this film, watching it time and time again. Enjoy and keep the lights on!",1240704000,,1328,4.180392156862745
3765919,2,B001QMCJ0U,"I wanted to like this movie... really I did. You have a serial killer who wears a chrome skull mask and has giant knives with sharp blades on one side and saw blades on the other. What's not to love???

Unfortunately there is much not to love. Here's a list:

1. The movie looks like it was shot on DV, so there is no film grain or cinematic feel to it. It is a personal preference thing for me, I suppose, but I don't like movies that have a ""shot-on-video"" look.

2. The lighting was all wrong. The scenes were pretty much all too brightly lit, reducing the scare factor considerably.

3. The dialog was average for this kind of movie. This is not to say that it was good at all, because it wasn't. I am comparing it to other very low budget horror movies.

4. The acting was, on average, pretty bad. Kevin Gage was the best actor in the movie and he did a pretty good job, but he didn't have much to work with.

5. The attempt to be ""back-woods hicks"" was very forced and it just didn't make any sense. The dialog wasn't natural, nor were the characters.

6. The killer was ill conceived. There was no background of any kind given. The killer did not speak. You didn't see the killer's face. You didn't have any clue what the killer's motivations were. At one point, ""Princess"" said ""I know your name!"" and it was supposed to be some dramatic point. The only problem is that his name didn't matter at all, in any way... the filmmakers didn't give us ANY background on anyone and only introduced us to, maybe, 12 characters in the whole movie. We know he was none of the ones who didn't wear a chrome mask, so her statement that she knew who he was meant absolutely nothing.

Sure, there was a pretty decent amount of violence, and the director made a point to show a good number of dismembered and mutilated corpses, but they were simply a means to an end. The failure to develop the mind or motivations of the killer rendered them simple set pieces.

This was an overall failing in the movie. The director failed to make the audience empathize with the characters in the movie because he failed to provide any history on anyone. Well, I take that back... we learn two things toward the very end of the movie, neither of which make even the slightest difference in any way.

Bottom line: 2.5/5",1240704000,,2296,4.343457943925234
3765920,4,B001QMCJ0U,"The following review is for the unrated director's cut for Anchor Bay's release of ""Laid to Rest:""

  Influenced by such classic slashers as ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th,"" director Robert Hall brings us the truly horrifying ""Laid to Rest.""  Not since ""Saw"" have I seen a gorier and bloodier film.  Another serial killer, not unlike Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, has been born.  This one, known as Chrome Skull, is more technologically advanced than his predecessors.  Wearing a chrome death mask, this serial killer likes to keep a movie camera mounted to his shoulder so that he can memorialize his victims who are dismembered like dolls and laid inside coffins.  His base of operation is a mortuary in an isolated, poverty-stricken town where citizens don't have landline telephones and the authorities are slow to respond.

  Bobbi Sue Luther gives an excellent performance as ""Princess"" - the latest girl abducted by Chrome Skull.  She awakens inside a locked coffin.  A blow on the head with a baseball bat has given her amnesia.  A kind stranger provides her with the nickname ""Princess.""  She recalls a childhood memory of having played with a doll named Princess Gemstone.  Princess flees from Chrome Skull - an inhuman, merciless killing machine - who relentlessly pursues her across town, from farmhouse to police station to mortuary to convenience store.  Anyone she meets may die in a horribly gruesome manner that will chill you to your bones.  Chrome Skull's diabolical evilness reminded me of the serial killer in ""Hitcher.""  Nothing, not even bullets, could stop Chrome Skull's deadly quest to kill Princess.  As with Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, and Freddy Krueger, Chrome Skull is vanquished, but will he stay defeated?  Watch the ending carefully and decide for yourself.

  ""Laid to Rest"" is highly recommended for gore hounds and high body count fiends.  Personally, I like a high body count.  The gore, in my opinion, was unnecessarily excessive.  Some people believe that excess gore adds to the sense of realism, thus increasing their fear.  As for me, I highly enjoyed ""Laid to Rest"" because it is very reminiscent of the slasher films that I watched as a teenager in the late seventies and early eighties.  If this film is your cup of tea, then I recommend watching ""Hatchet"" - another Anchor Bay release of a modern serial killer.  This one's name is Victor Crowley and he lives in the swamps outside New Orleans.

  Needless to say, Anchor Bay has given ""Laid to Rest"" a marvelous release.  It is presented in widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  English subtitles have been provided for the deaf and hearing impaired.  Bonus features include audio commentary from the writer/director, Robert Hall, and actor/producer Bobbi Sue Luther.  There are special features on how the film was made, especially the special effects and makeup.  There are also deleted scenes, bloopers, and a trailer.",1240617600,,2934,5.0480167014613775

8336006,1,B001QMCJ0U,"This movie is dumb as Hell!!!!!! 100% idiotic and unnecessary! It made no sense. The female lead spoke like some illiterate backwoods hick, and not in a convincing or funny way. This movie was just all kinds of stupid. The kills are gory and violent which I love in a horror movie but there was NO plot whatsoever.

The female lead has amnesia and wakes up in a ""dead box"" as she calls it (normal people would say coffin but whatever) and all the gory kills and men racing to protect her start to pile up. And when I say that EVERY guy she meets try to protect her.... I mean it. They ALL go above and beyond just to die for this generic broad with huge boobs. The serial killer in this movie is not scary, clever or interesting in any sense. We don't even know his motivation to kill. He wears this dumb a** chrome skull mask that ALWAYS seems to fall off! Get a better mask that fits you moron!

And the ending, don't get me started. ***SPOILER ALERT***  We never see the killers face, get a clue on who he is nor do we find out who this stupid big breasted girl is. Dumb to the 100th degree!
