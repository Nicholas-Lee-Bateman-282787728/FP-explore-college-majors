7315285,5,B010OEBTQK,"Guilty pleasures abound in this fun, cheezy early 90s martial-arts action flick. The film doesn't take itself seriously and is a hoot to see after all these years. After crappy pan and scan DVDs, this gorgeous Blu-ray gets it right and really looks terrific.",1439510400,3,258,4.886363636363637
7315286,1,B010OEBTQK,"Somebody felt the need to turn this ill-conceived 80s dreck into a Blu-Ray? Poor Brandon Lee, doomed to admire Dolph's junk for all eternity.",1439251200,,141,4.916666666666667

7315288,2,B010OEBTQK,"One of Director Mark Lester's lost action classics Showdown in Little tokyo
never got the respect it deserved on DVD
and guess what it still hasn't been given the respect it deserves on this new blu-ray version
well for one thing this new U.S. blu-ray version is not the Uncut version at all
it's the typical U.S. theatrical release which has been given a new HD transfer in 1:85:1 ratio by Warner's archive collection
the sound quality has not changed it's the same Dolby digital stereo mix
there's also no new extras except the usual Trailer of course
being a fan of this film i was expecting some new special features for a new blu-ray release
man am i disgusted, no new retrospective interview with Mark Lester or Dolph Lundgren at least
just the usual Theatrical trailer
the Uncut version which has little bit more violence & Gore in it
especially the scene of Angel's Head in the body bag was never in the U.S. version
other versions are Uncut, the Australian dvd version which i have anyway is Uncut
plus the screen ratios are different aswell,
the U.S. DVD is only 1:33:1 fullscreen, where is the region 4 AUS is 1:85:1 widescreen
how that makes sense, no idea
if you want the Uncut version stay with the region 4 AUS release if you have it
if your not fussy then buy this new blu-ray version, it's personal preference really
but for me i'm disgusted with this new blu-ray version it should be the Unrated cut with more violence & Blood
and should have new retrospective featurette at least
well it has none of that so 1-2stars for this new blu-ray, Warner' archive obviously made no effort what else is new",1437609600,20,1615,4.553264604810996
7315289,4,B010OEBTQK,Extremely cheesy action movie...Our first real introduction to Brandon Lee.  The action scenes are good thanks to the natural skills of Lundgren and Lee.  And something tells me that Lundgren had a big hand in production based upon lines Lee had to make about Lundgrens manhood.  Turn off your brain and enjoy yourself!,1437436800,9,319,4.981132075471698

7315291,5,B010OEBTQK,I loved this movie I bought it because I already had one movie with Dolph Lundgren in it & I bought a movie with Brandon Lee in it so I figured why not buy one with both of them in it and I didn't regret it.,1461456000,,207,3.5217391304347827

7315300,5,B010OEBTQK,Showdown shows the potential we lost with the passing of Brandon Lee. The film gives a glimpse of his potential as an actor doing action  combined with light hearted comedy. Good contrast in styles between serious Dolph and easy going Brandon.,1442016000,3,243,4.926829268292683
