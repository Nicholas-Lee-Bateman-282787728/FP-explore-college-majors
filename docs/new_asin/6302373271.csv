They are not interviewed as much as they are in those other two videos, but they are just as funny! It shows them more out on the road -- traveling in the tour bus,getting ready backstage for their shows, and the fans. The songs, ""Easy Come, Easy go"", ""You are the Saint, I am the Sinner"" are preformed on this video, and can only be seen on this video. Also there is a really cool song they do on this video not avalible on any of their cd's or anywhere else - Silent Night! The setup for this song is really cool too! If you like Kip (as I do), Reb, Paul, Rod, or just Winger in general, then this video is for you!! I definately recommend this video!! #1 A+++++++++++",1076630400,2,872,4.105263157894737
8601863,5,6302373271,"This video is a very awesome video. I am a music collector, and if I ever decide to sell my music memorabilia, I will never sell this video -- it is just so good. If you like Kip, as I do, or Reb, then this video is for you -- they are interviewed several times in this video, along with Paul Taylor and Rod Morgenstein. The quality is great, the videos are very hot, and the songs are the best of Winger!! I would definately recommend this video. If you know the men of Winger, then you know how funny they can be, and it shows that in this video when they answer questions submitted by fans. The Winger sound is very rare, and unique. They are great muscisians that know how to jam with an electric quitar, which they show in the video. This video is #1 A++++++++++ in my book and I recommend it to anyone who loves Winger!!",1076544000,3,826,4.136645962732919
