6473593,1,B00L6KKXQE,Very poor acting. Not believable.,1505692800,,33,5.8
6473594,5,B00L6KKXQE,This was obviously a tv movie that got past me. Very good Lifetime-esqe film. Plausible story and pacing... the writing while not top notch was not cringe worthy. In spite of any (minimal) shortcomings elsewhere the cast is excellent. Likable cast and everyone rose to the occasion... very well acted.,1504656000,,301,5.04
6473595,3,B00L6KKXQE,"so a person/woman who trains for combat is afraid of her shadow and only pushes the stalker?  how about a krav magra throat clench, knee buckling blow to the hey!!!  the bartender who happens to be a beautiful brown colour stated he should have hit him/stalker---please stop we know what would have happened in real life----the bartender would have done a bid for attempted murder---seriously that scene where the stalker is wearing sunglasses-at night and  home girl backing up as he is coming toward her!!!??? what is all that combat training for? to look good in a dress?  she should have started stalking him.........with a swift MMA move........I am not dying because someone else is ill.....",1504483200,2,697,4.982758620689655

6473597,2,B00L6KKXQE,"Uh yeah so they made a movie.  Congrats.  Unfortunately it makes light of mental illness and stalking which I would be okay with if the movie were any good, but it isn't.  Two stars only for the actors who do a nice job and it looked good, but the plot about an all powerful stalker who happens to be manic or something (hear's voices in his head) is brutally bad.  I'm sure it's terrible to have someone with mental problems fixate on you, but isn't just a normal stalker bad enough?  Or did they feel like the mental illness distinguished it from the many other better ""fatal attraction"" type movies?  The fact a ""strong"" woman falls apart because of the nut is a shot at women in general and their ability to take care of themselves.",1502668800,3,736,4.375

6473599,4,B00L6KKXQE,"Dangerous Attraction is a made originally for TV movie from 2012, don't confuse it with a 2000 made for TV movie of the same name when shopping around and looking for the cheapest price.  It was also released in some markets as Shadow of Fear, again though there was another movie with that title from 2007 that probably appears more often in online searches.  Make sure it's the one made in 2012 under either title.  This movie for me had only one recognisable face, albeit a lot older than when I last saw her on screen of Catherine Hicks, whose most famous role was the unlikable mother in the 90's and following decade TV show 7th Heaven.  She has a small role in this and plays a cafe owner, one of the two places where our main character (and victim) also works.  Amanda Righetti plays Casey a very confident woman who has no problem breaking up violent fights at the bar she works at by pointing out how pathetic a larger guy is who is beating on a smaller guy, even if he deserves it.  However that confidence is about to be eroded by Morgan a new cafe employee who doesn't last long in the job and turns up the next day accusing her of murder, coming onto him and all sorts of obvious to everyone else nonsense.  His harassment won't let up, he leaves hundreds of insane sounding messages on her phone, written notes, turns up outside her house, while she's walking home and everywhere else.  The police fob her off basically telling her unless he specifically says he's going to kill you, there's nothing  we can do.  Eventually a female officer bucks the trend and gives her the business card of a detective who doesn't have this attitude.  But even he is blocked by the stalker's links in the community, to do much about him.

Amanda Righetti (who since the movie I have looked up has been in TV shows such as The O.C., The Mentalist, Colony and others I haven't seen) does a brilliant job at portraying a strong independent confident woman who changes and loses all those great qualities with the constant harassment and the fear it brings. I would definitely love to see her in more films.  Morgan certainly came across as creepy and not all mentally there, but I never understood why he thought Casey was a murderer and his other beliefs.  The movie needed to show us/tell us/convince us better than it did. The actor Will Estes a small guy, didn't really have a physical intimidation vibe coming off him, so I never understood why Casey, her coworkers including the old lady, didn't at any point just beat the crap out of him in frustration.  It's not like assuming he didn't pull out a weapon, that any of them wouldn't have won the encounter.  Even if he was a huge guy, I never understood why her friend the bar boss or one or more of her male customers pay him a visit and leave him in a condition that he knows it's going to be a lot worse if he didn't leave her alone.  I certainly would feel like doing that if some creepy guy was destroying mentally one of my female friends.  The movie really needed to show why this didn't happen, which it didn't.

Other than phone call after phone call, and Casey mentally imploding, there wasn't a lot to this plot compared to other stalker books and movies, a very saturated genre.  It got a little boring after a while and you were hoping it would hurry up and inevitable confrontation between victim and stalker you know is coming, just to add some level of excitement.  This would have been a three star movie with a lesser actress as Casey but honestly Amanda Righetti's performance lifts it a star.",1489968000,2,3566,4.463790446841294
6473600,3,B00L6KKXQE,Not as much of a thriller then expected but overall a good quality dvd for the price.,1461196800,,85,4.0588235294117645

8664149,4,B00L6KKXQE,"A woman stalked and seeking revenge via restitution.  On the road to restitution, the victim discovers the perp's dark past and his enablers.  Good story, good acting, a step above a B movie, action packed, a touch of drama, twists and turns in story line.",1527120000,,256,4.666666666666667
8664150,5,B00L6KKXQE,"This is an intense film about a stalker with severe mental issues who creates havoc in the life of his victim.  It will hold your interest throughout.
Will Estes very convincingly plays the part of the deranged stalker, and Amanda Righetti puts in a stellar performance as his victim.  The supporting cast is excellent.

I recommend this film.  It's worth your time.",1522972800,,366,4.854838709677419
8664151,4,B00L6KKXQE,"Much better acting from the two main characters than a typical Lifetime movie, especially from Will Estes. This isn't an obsession based on a romantic relationship gone wrong, but a mentally-unhinged man who fixates his insane delusions on a young woman who is forced to fight back any way she can.",1520035200,,298,4.862745098039215
8664152,3,B00L6KKXQE,"A good portrayal of a very important topic, stalking.  Will Estes, from Blue Bloods  was so effective in the roll of the stalker, scary as the devil. I'm going to havae to watch a comedy or something to get that out of my mind.",1519171200,,227,4.136363636363637

8664154,5,B00L6KKXQE,I watch anything with Will Estes in it He's My Favorite Actor Although this is a very different role for him I like it,1511654400,,118,3.9583333333333335
8664155,5,B00L6KKXQE,"I enjoyed this movie. The acting was good, the story line is very relatable, and it really makes you think about the laws in America that deal with stalking. The movie is basically about a woman who finds herself dealing with a stalker who suffers from severe mental problems, while also dealing with forces who want to keep the situation out of the public eye. I think we can all sympathize with that, especially with the Harvey Weinstein Hollywood scandal and how those in power protected him for decades to benefit themselves, All of the actors did a good job in their roles, and it even gives you some suspense. I will definitely watch this movie again.",1509840000,3,657,4.6239316239316235
8664156,5,B00L6KKXQE,"I don't understand the 1 star ratings ..my wife and I loved this movie. We watched it initially because we like the mentalist and were exited to see ""Van Pelt"" as a main character..but aside from that, this is the 3rd movie in a row now by the same producers, and we've been impressed with all three. The other two are ""wandering eye"" and ""exposed"".. this one with a main character from prison break. Liked everything, about all three movies and recommend seeing any of them.",1509753600,3,475,4.534883720930233
