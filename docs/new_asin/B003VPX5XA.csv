4209874,5,B003VPX5XA,I'm glad to be able to finish my Seasons 1 to 4. I didn't watch Season 5 because it was very disappointing.,1356393600,,107,3.909090909090909
4209875,5,B003VPX5XA,"Fast service, Good condition, Good price,

I was able to get season's 2,3,and 4. from same seller.
Dang Skippy, i will use these guys again for future purchase's.",1353542400,,236,4.386363636363637
4209876,5,B003VPX5XA,I am a star trek fan and havc enjoyed this series.  It isn't as good as star trek series but I have enjoyed it.  It came as expected and was in good condition.,1345680000,,159,3.787878787878788
4209877,5,B003VPX5XA,this continues the series and introduces a new character to the show her name is Street and she repalaces Augur.  It is an exciting season with a surprising season finale.  It is a good continuation.,1330387200,,199,4.6571428571428575
4209878,4,B003VPX5XA,It has gotten unpredictable with the a lot of the main characters being killed off but but I love the ending episodes which brought it altogether.  Where is the next season going?  Who knows?!,1301270400,,192,4.617647058823529
4209879,4,B003VPX5XA,"This Sci-Fi Drama was exactly as I remembered it, the reason I gave a four was because of the packaging. The manufacturing folks could have really just gone with a simpler system and had better protection for the disc. In 4 of the 5 seasons I purchased, there were discs flopping around inside the box. Luckly there wasn't any damage.",1294012800,7,334,4.583333333333333
4209880,5,B003VPX5XA,I am now on season  two. It is as I remember. Can't wait to get through the rest of the seasons.,1457049600,,96,3.5714285714285716
4209881,4,B003VPX5XA,"So far (I am on Disk 1) the second episode is in Fullscreen while the rest are Widescreen; some kind of error I guess. Anyway, the entire series is well worth watching if you have time. Some say S1 is the best which may be true but I like them all. A bit expensive but worth it if you're a Sci-Fi Fan.

This season (so far) isn't looking so good really. Feels like they ran out of story lines and most of the original cast seems to be leaving. Sandoval is still uber annoying though.",1441152000,,483,4.08421052631579
4209882,5,B003VPX5XA,"Seen about two episode of this show when I was living and working in Dubai. When I seen it I had to buy it, nice them song and love the story line of the show.",1435363200,,159,3.5714285714285716

4209889,3,B003VPX5XA,"An import, it delivered wide screen viewing and good audio, but lacked English subtitles for the hearing impaired.  I will upgrade when I find a better version.",1405209600,,160,4.925925925925926
4209900,1,B003VPX5XA,cheap Cardboard case. the plastic insert came broken and the disks scratched. not worth $40.,1404864000,2,92,5.2
4209901,5,B003VPX5XA,"While the series may not be EXCELLENT start to finish, there are certainly enough great episodes coupled with the merely good to make it worth watching.",1402876800,,152,4.884615384615385
4209902,5,B003VPX5XA,"Even without already knowing that this series was canceled, you do get a feeling that the end was near. The humans are starting to shake off their dependence on the Taelons and the Taelons are themselves in serious trouble. As always, many of the better shows end up being axed and the crappy ones seem to go on forever. Sad that, unlike the original Star Trek, EFC did not continue on in syndication. There is one bad thing. The packaging of the discs is a very poor design. The discs ore overlaying each other and the case does not hold them secure. As a result, the DVDs fall out of the case and slide around each other, thus risking the chance of being scratched. Not sure who the Einstein was that designed this case, but they should have been kicked in the backside for this poor desin. If you are thinking of getting season five, as well, be advised the DVDs are packaged in the same style.",1393891200,,897,4.377245508982036
4209903,5,B003VPX5XA,Another great series from Gene Rodenberry. I decided to purchase all the season sets because I like the creator and the storyline.,1388188800,,130,4.954545454545454
4209904,5,B003VPX5XA,"An excellent series. Wish it would've run longer. It was kind of like ""V"" meets ""Red Dawn"".  If you liked those two shows you'll love this series.",1386892800,,146,4.407407407407407
4209905,4,B003VPX5XA,I loved this series.  I was able to watch all the episodes from the beginning.  I would highly recommend it.,1366588800,,108,4.35
4209906,4,B003VPX5XA,"For those of you who enjoy Science Fiction, you'll see the dark side of the Taelon companions.  One might consider the series flawed when a so called ""advanced race"" suffers the same lust for power, but the series is enjoyable.",1365811200,,227,4.675
4209907,1,B003VPX5XA,"s1 rest are bad, especialy 5.  5 is worse than I remember.  taelons leavin for atavus is lousy idea.  save your money and get 1-4",1363651200,2,129,4.08
4209908,5,B003VPX5XA,Finally whole series released - Ive Waitng along time for this series to come out on DVD or Blu Ray.,1361664000,,100,4.05
4209909,5,B003VPX5XA,"Although none of the actors were familiar to me, they were superb.  The series concept was well-thought out and the sets and special effects were great.  Often, sci-fi movies/series can be cheesy with substandard music and dialogue, but it's easy to get caught up in and remain fascinated by this series.  What's really good is that since there so many different plots going on in the series, the intro to each episode connects what's about to be shown with what has already transpired in that plot line.  Each season continues the same high quality.",1360540800,,550,4.819148936170213

8407012,4,B003VPX5XA,"I remember this series fondly from when I was younger.  There are a few things that I really wish had been done differently now, upon re-watching it.  Such as the episode ""Epiphany"".",1516838400,,182,4.65625

8407018,4,B003VPX5XA,"We finally got this - it was out of stock at Amazon, but they recommended another operates-through-Amazon seller, so all's well!

We haven't started working through the series yet - we're still enjoying <insert other space scifi show name here - hint: VORLONS!> so it'll be a while.  I'll probably come back to tack on that 5th star then.",1473379200,,338,4.711864406779661
