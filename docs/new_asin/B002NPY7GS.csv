3959848,5,B002NPY7GS,"Happy to final see Season 4 of this slow-to-release classic series, but I remain saddened that Universal refuses to bring out the 67 episode 'Boris Karloff's Thriller,' which minute-for-minute is a greater series.  In fact it's horror's definitive moment on television with classic episodes that set the bar in this genre: ""Pigeons From Hell,"" ""The Incredible Dr. Markeson,"" ""The Weird Tailor,"" ""Waxworks,"" ""The Cheaters,"" ""The Devils Ticket,"" ""Well of Doom,"" ""The Premature Burial,"" ""Masquerade,"" ""Terror in Teakwood,"" ""The Hungey Glass,"" ""The Grim Reaper,"" ""A Good Imagination,"" ""The Purple Room"" and ""La Strega"" ranking among the greatest shows ever aired.  Universal was disappointed that the laserdisc set sold poorly many years ago, so they have refused to entertain a venture to bring the series out on DVD, a dubious conclusion, methinks, as DVD has reached many times as many homes over the past years.

Boris Karloff's Thriller deserves full exposure.",1258416000,8,961,5.436241610738255

I realize that sometimes it is due to licensing but to wait over 2 years for a DVD boxset to be released is terrible.  I would love to see Boris Karloff's Thriller, season 2 of Maude, season 3 of Family and season 7 of All in the Family.

I am sure that there is an audience for these.",1253145600,13,419,4.024096385542169

I thought I would either wait a very long time or not use it at all which I thought was going to happen because I started to believe that they were never going to release season 4. Well I logged on just like I do everyday hoping I would see season 4, well low and behold I logged on today and was estatic to see it has FINALLY been released. I am so happy as this is one of the best series to ever air on TV.
In case you were wondering I also bought Adam 12 season 1-3

This season set also includes a featurette - ""Fasten Your Seatbelts: The Thrilling Art of Alfred Hitchcock"".

After a couple of years of seemingly abandoning the effort of putting Alfred Hitchcock Presents out on DVD, it is good to finally see Universal putting the fourth season out. The Master of Suspense actually only directed two episodes this season, but it might interest you to know that one of the big stars of the 1940's, Casablanca's Paul Henreid, really showed his talent behind the camera by directing four episodes this season and a total of 28 for the series run. Another very good  director, Arthur Hiller, directed another five. You'll notice stars this season that are just coming into their own or will in the next few years such as Elizabeth Montgomery, Steve McQueen, and Dick York. You'll also spot stars of the big screen making guest appearances such as Claude Rains, Bette Davis, her husband at the time Gary Merrill, Everett Sloane, Franchot Tone, Mary Astor, and even Fay Wray.  Writers for the season include Roald Dahl and Ray Bradbury.

I have childhood memories of being scared out of my wits by the Twilight Zone, since that show's scripts were not bound by natural law. Alfred Hitchcock, however, stays within the natural bounds of what is possible and explores the darkness of man's heart. Since just about every episode involves murder with motive, you'd think that the episodes would get old, but they don't. I heartily recommend this season for fans of Hitchcock and classic TV in general.",1251936000,137,4473,4.552564102564102

3959865,5,B002NPY7GS,"The fourth season (1958-59) of the long running Alfred Hitchcock Presents features 36 memorable half-hour episodes, produced by Hitch's Shamley Productions and Revue, Universal's television arm.
One of the great charms (and unforgettable segments) of the series were the weekly appearances of Mr. Hitchcock himself usually in a bizarre set and/or with strange props, making droll remarks with that unmistakeable vocal delivery and always belittling the sponsor.
Under Hitch's watchful eye, producer Joan Harrison, associate Norman Lloyd and story editor Gordon Hessler never failed to present quirky and entertaining programs.  Occasionally there was the odd lull but generally the stories were top-notch from a quality list of writers and fine directors, the latter including Robert Stevens, Arthur Hiller, Paul Henreid, Norman Lloyd and two by the master himself.
And of course, there were the wonderful actors, always cast just right for each episode.  The fourth season featured Walter Matthau, Richard Kiley, Art Carney, Barry Sullivan, Margaret Leighton, Phyllis Thaxter, Steve McQueen, Claude Rains, Bette Davis, Mary Astor, Roger Moore, Paul Douglas, Robert Morse, Barbara Bel Geddes and Robert Horton, to mention a few.
And with this excellent 4-disc set you get to watch all the episodes without commercial interruption, which would certainly have made the old master chuckle with delight.",1450656000,,1399,5.6571428571428575

3959900,4,B002NPY7GS,"Having previously purchased seasons 1-3, I anxiously awaited what appears to be the final ""available"" season on dvd. As always I enjoyed Mr. Hitchcock's deadpan humor at the beginning and end of each episode. You pretty much can't go wrong with this dvd set, but as with most of the AHP's there is usually one episode I find myself watching over and over.

On season 4 that episode was ""Mrs. Herman and Mrs. Fenimore."" The characters were a hoot. I especially got a kick out of Mrs. Herman's diction and mannerisms, she could've played the lead witch in the Wizard of Oz easily. Mrs. Fenimore reminded me a little of the character Blanche Devereaux from the ""Golden Girls."" Actress Mary Astor had the uncanny likeness of the actress Rue McClanahan. And of course the conclusion was classic Hitchcock. Defintely a ""must see"" episode.

Not to take the subject of murder lightly, but Mr. Hitchcock really knew how to poke fun at murder without being gratuitous. I've never seen any indication of blood on any of the episodes even when a victim is ultimately dispatched. I'm sure that was mostly due to censorship back in the day, but he didn't need to. He always got his point across.

I truly wish the studio would release the remaining seasons. This is a classic show that shouldn't be kept hiding on some dark Hollywood shelf.",1316995200,,1326,4.706896551724138

3959902,1,B002NPY7GS,"After four attempts, I FINALLY put together a set of Alfred Hitchcock Presents Season Four that plays without incident.  I NEVER had this problem with Seasons 1 through 3 in years past as they were released.  Sadly, some of the discs I ""cherry-picked"" to put together Season Four still had with mild scrapes and scratches.  However, they appear to play without incident (at least on my DVD player).  Since the actual show has been sufficiently reviewed, I will add some comments pertaining to the quality of the DVDs.  First, they are NOT remastered but the quality is good...not great...but more than good enough so that you can enjoy the episodes and not be distracted by those elements that can make watching a vintage TV show or moving a grueling experience (poor or fuzzy image, scratches, ""syndication butchery"" to make room for local commercials, etc.).  My biggest peeve is the condition of the DVDs upon arrival.  To AMAZON.COM's credit, the box sets were well-packed but....upon opening the sets I had most all of the DVDs had scratches, scrapes, smudges, and even ""bubbles"" in the plastic.  WHAT IS GOING ON????  I cannot believe these shoddy copies were allowed to leave the factory!!!  I have a nervous feeling that as the DVD market shrinks (thanks to the economy, the technology of ""downloads"", and the growing sales of ""Made on Demand"" (MOD) DVD-R releases), that the quality control of the production and handling of DVDs at the factory is falling by the wayside.  Call me weird but I expect new DVDs to be pristene but more and more I am seeing ""new"" DVDs arrive with scratches, scrapes, discoloration, and smudges.  This seems to be a common problem with some studios but not all.  The worst offenders seem to be Universal, Paramount, sometimes Fox and some of the ""no-name"" distributors that specialize in obscure, public domain titles.  I suspect the ""golden age"" of DVDs is behind us.  When manufacturers start turning out substandard and shoddy product as the ""new norm"", this is one of the tell-tale signs of market decay.  I remember when this happened with VHS...the quality of the tape got cheaper and thinner and ""drop-out"" became more and more of a problem in the ""waning years"".  Thankfully, we have manufacturers and distibuters who do care....Shout! Factory and Olive Films to name a few....I apologize for the rant but receiving ""new"" (?) DVDs that look like they have been used, recycled, or appear to have been used as coasters at a college fraternity party is inexcusable.... Hence my rating of one star....",1314057600,8,2543,4.904205607476635
3959903,5,B002NPY7GS,"Asking which best seasons of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS is the best can be debated among fans, but the general opinion with Hitchcock fans is that the series at the prime during Seasons Three, Four and Five. Case in point: Season Four box set. Wendell Corey stars in the season opener, ""Poison,"" one of the very few episodes of the series directed by Alfred Hitchcock himself. (He hosted the series, but only directed 16 or 17 of the 300 plus episodes.) Leslie Neilsen stars in ""The $2,000,000 Defense"" which is a fascinating and intriguing court room drama about a guilty man who tells his attorney that if he can get him off on a murder charge he's guilty of committing, he'll pay the attorney $2 million. Wait till you see the twist! ""Man With a Problem"" has a VERY young Elizabeth Montgomery in a small role (keep an eye out for her) and an ending that reminds us that Hitchcock was willing to go overboard. Want to see a young Roger Moore? Hazel Court? How about a young Steve McQueen in a story about an invasion from outer space? They are all here. The picture quality is superb. Extras? There are none. Which is sad but not unexpected since it comes from Universal, who has a track record of not doing any extras (they wouldn't go to the expense) and doesn't release every season. If sales of Season Four don't exceed their sales expectations, they won't bother with Season Five.

3959905,1,B002NPY7GS,"Great show, but as is the case with many Universal/Paramount releases, they simply stop releasing DVD's after a few seasons if they think that the show isn't selling well enough: Even if the low sales are because of splitting seasons into volumes and ultimately charging twice as much per season. They are notorious for ending the release of a series after a season or two. Some real geniuses working there. I'm now stuck with partial runs of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Night Gallery, Cannon, etc... If you like to collect full runs of classic TV shows like I do, it's almost better not to buy the first seasons from Universal/Paramount in the first place. They're the the worst, and obviously couldn't care less about their customers.",1297555200,11,735,4.888
3959906,5,B002NPY7GS,This is a classic show from the master of suspense.  AV is quality is very good.  Not restored but from good clean prints.  Season 5 is long overdue.,1292889600,2,149,4.25
3959907,5,B002NPY7GS,I am 46 years old. So Alfred Hitchcock presents is a little before my time. But it is the best Television show i have ever seen. These shows are really short half hour movies. Brilliantly written with  great acting. And with clever finishes. How we can only have 4 seasons on DVD is unbelievable. The final 3 seasons of Alfred Hitchcock presents and the 3 seasons of the Alfred Hitchcock hour should be released together without delay. I could go on for hours about all of the devastatingly great episodes. There is nothing to truly compare. Not Thriller the overrated series hosted by Boris Karloff. I have seen every episode of Thriller. It is alarmingly flat and doesn't come close to Hitchcock presents. Or the even better and more detailed Alfred Hitchcock hour. There's a reason Thriller lasted only 2 seasons. Nor the twilight zone. Which ventured into imagination and super natural. Alfred Hitchcock explores reality. The evil nature of human beings. The things you here about on your local news everyday. The generation that loved this show are dying off quick. If they don't get this out soon. There won't be anyone alive who enjoyed this show so much to buy them. Please Universal release the rest of this series now. It has been 45 years since the last episode of the Alfred Hitchcock hour. This show should never be forgotten. Its just that good.,1291420800,7,1359,4.758474576271187
3959908,5,B002NPY7GS,I seriously do not understand why we have not heard any word on AHP season 5. Universal obviously knows there are people waiting for season 5 to be released yet they don't even give out any news on when or even if the season will be released. They should just release the remaining seasons AS WELL as releasing the Alfred Hitchcock Hour all at once so that at least those of us who are not willing to wait until were 100 years old can enjoy them!

3959909,5,B002NPY7GS,This is one of the all time best in television programming.  I personally feel these television episodes actually out do Hitchcock's full length features.  It was that every October a Alfred Hitchcock Presents Season was being released.  Season 4 was delayed for an immense time and now it seems like they're on hold indefinitely.  There must be enough of a demand for these time enduring classics.  Please release the rest of this series.  Pleeeeeezzze!!!!!

3959916,5,B002NPY7GS,"I had been waiting for a long time for the release of Season Four, and it was worth the wait! I own the prior three seasons and will buy any others released (please hurry and do that, ok?)

What I love:

Hitchcock is even more caustic, clever and amusing with his introductory and closing aspersions toward the ""sponsahs."" He really got away with murder on some of those! I love his delivery, too. His expression never changes. Worth your money just to watch him

The story lines are the usual twisting and turning sort where most times you can't guess the end. It's a lot of fun to try and figure it out only to be proven wrong in the end. I did guess a couple, but only because I've watched so many that I'm training myself to think like a sleuth. (I think watching these are good brain exercises!)

The acting and characters are top notch whether quirky scoundrels or conniving cold-hearted killers.

Of course, the suspense! Hitchcock is the master, and he has a way of drawing you in within the first minute. Suddenly you care about what will happen next and I think this is my favorite part- you can get lost in the ""play"" as he calls it and be highly entertained for a half an hour. Also, I love the styles of the 50's, so it's great from that angle, too!

3959927,5,B002NPY7GS,"Season 4 of Alfred Hitchock Presents is another great season. Sad it takes Universal longer and longer between seasons. As others have noted a lot of big stars are on this season, the transfers are on par with previous seasons. Each disc is single sided so you don't have to worry about those pecky flipper discs on this season. (Season 1 seemed to be the only flipper season to my knowledge)",1259625600,,392,4.535211267605634
3959928,5,B002NPY7GS,"""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" premiered in October, 1955.  Hitchcock himself introduced each show with his trademark dry wit, and directed selected episodes.  The anthology series featured tales of mystery and suspense, horror and the supernatural, usually with a surprise ending.  It ran for ten seasons and was the forerunner of such series as ""Thriller"" and ""The Twilight Zone.""  The 36 episodes from 1958-1959's Season Four, now available in a four-disc set, are one of the series' best collections of stories.

""Poison,"" directed by Hitchcock and based on a Roald Dahl short story, finds plantation owner Harry Pope (James Donald) awakening to find that a deadly snake has crawled into bed with him and is now asleep under the covers on his chest.  Suspense mounts as Harry, his partner Timber Woods (Wendell Corey), and a neighboring doctor attempt to figure a way to save him from a lethal bite.

""The Waxwork"" is a creepy tale of reporter Ray Hewson (Barry Nelson) who convinces wax museum owner Mr. Marriner (Everett Sloan) to let him spend the night in the museum's murderers' row gallery so he can write a story about its atmosphere.  Later that night, Hewson is stunned to see the unfinished figure of a murderous barber named Bourdette suddenly spring to life.  Bourdette claims he was scheduled for execution the following morning, but escaped and hid in the museum.

A personal favorite, ""Banquo's Chair,"" also directed by Hitchcock, stars frequent series cast member John Williams as  Scotland Yard Inspector Brent, who sets up a plan to entrap a man (Kenneth Haigh), acquitted of murdering his aunt years earlier, into confessing to the crime.  Brent hires an actress to appear as the ghost of the dead woman to shake up the nephew at a dinner party, prompting a confession.  This episode is wonderful in its use of reaction shots to illustrate the growing tension and then panic of the nephew as he sees his aunt's ""ghost"" while casual dinner conversation takes place around him.

Bette Davis stars in ""Out There, Darkness"" as wealthy Miss Fox, who hires the elevator boy to walk her beloved pet poodle.  When Eddie asks her for a loan, she turns him down and he refuses to walk the dog any longer.  That night, Miss Fox is mugged and her handbag and valuable ring are stolen.  Assuming Eddie is the perpetrator, she informs the police and Eddie is arrested but, after he's spent a year in jail, the actual culprit is caught. Eddie is released and a penitent Miss Fox tries to make amends.

Other stars appearing in fourth season episodes include Claude Rains, Franchot Tone, Joyce Meadows, Brian Keith, Steve McQueen, Dick York, Paul Douglas, Cloris Leachman, Richard Kiley, Leslie Nielsen, and Elizabeth Montgomery.  Also included in the set is the featurette ""Fasten Your Seatbelt: The Thrilling Art of Alfred Hitchcock.""",1259366400,9,2840,4.966173361522198

In response to the reviewer who wished that Universal would release Boris Karloff's ""Thriller"", I posted the following comment to his review:

I've heard from some very reliable sources that a complete (2 season) series release of Karloff's ""Thriller"" is in the works for a release sometime in 2010, most likely middle or 3rd quarter of the year. The set is being licensed by Universal to a third party--I'm not positive now, but I think it's Image Entertainment, which has done a great job for shows like ""Twilight Zone"", ""Dick Van Dyke Show"", and ""Combat!"". There are great bonus features planned too, stuff like commentaries from surviving actors and isolated music scores, plus more. I love ""Thriller"" too, so I cannot wait for this release! In the meantime, I'll enjoy this latest release of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Season 4"".

I heard this news from a TV historian who has already recorded commentary for ""Thriller"", so this complete series release is definitely in thw works.  This is probably tops on my personal list of most-wanted shows, so I'm really anxious waiting for this!",1258416000,2,1358,4.93859649122807
