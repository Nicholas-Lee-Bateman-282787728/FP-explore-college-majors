8491431,4,B000LVEO2S,"I've been playing HU LHE exclusively for a living for about 5 months before I purchased this dvd. That said I think it is pretty good. If you are a beginner to the HU game it is a very good purchase indeed. It will take you immediately to a level where you will be very good against most fish. That's  who you want to be playing anyhow.

If you are already an advanced HU LHE player this unfortunately won't have much to tell you that you don't already know. I would love to see a part 2 with more advanced content though because I like the way the information was presented by Mr. Jacobs.",1214524800,4,589,4.157894736842105
8491432,5,B000LVEO2S,"By far the weakest part of my game is heads up play so I was pretty excited to discover Byron Jacobs three-part DVD package on the subject. I bought this one and added it to my other three series of Expert Hold `Em sets by Miller, Slotboom, and Fromm. All of them are definitely worth the money and are a solid investment. With heads up, the biggest problem most of us have is with hand values and what cards we should be playing. Jacobs answers these questions quite nicely here. His main theme is that what one should be doing heads up is to create pressure plays that force your opponent to make mistakes. That's the theme of poker in general I suppose but Jacobs provides viewers with a cookbook of information covering all of the major strategic decisions. More important than anything in heads up is not to play predictably and to absorb that mono e mono action is actually a war. His flop analysis in particular was very helpful to me. That's the type of advice you can use right away. About the tactics overall, all I can really say is ""Wow."" In the small blind, Jacobs open raises with 85 percent of his hands and folds the rest. That's more aggressive than I could ever imagine being (which is probably why I haven't been too successful in heads up contests). I also liked his explanation of the ""donk bet"" and how to handle the ""law enforcement officer"" at the table.",1175990400,9,1378,4.450592885375494
