8075320,3,B000A6T1VI,"This set is just ho-hum.  I liked sets 1 and 2 much better.  1 and 2 were jam-packed with lots of deliciously creepy tales, chosen and sometimes written by Roald Dahl. I think it's better to skip set 3 and buy the other sets 1 and 2.",1411430400,2,233,3.9361702127659575

8075322,3,B000A6T1VI,"Accomplishing the ""twenty spine chilling tales"", an Australian-produced five-DVD set presents, according to producers, a cream de la cream of the Dahl's stories-tragic, deceptive, ambiguous events depicted by a strongly hilarious way.
