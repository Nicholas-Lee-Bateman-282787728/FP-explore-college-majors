8389304,5,B0035YCFHE,"I enjoyed this debate.  Mr. McTiernan was a better match for Tovia than the previous pastor.

Although I don't agree with Mr. McTiernan, I thought he did a decent job of presenting his argument, until he tried to use a bad translation of Psalm 110.

Perhaps Mr. McTiernan may be closer to fulfilling the end times prophecy of Zechariah 8:23 where it says 'So said the Lord of Hosts: In those days, when ten men of all the languages of the nations shall take hold of the skirt of a Jewish man, saying, ""Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.""'

Note: the Hebrew for 'with you' is 'im-achem', (you- plural)

Thanks Tovia!  The ""Let's Get Biblical"" book and DVDs have been very educational.",1333670400,5,708,4.407692307692308
8389305,5,B0035YCFHE,"I bought this DVD from Rabbi Singer's Outreach Judaism about a year or so ago, and I've watched it twice. I am obviously (since I'm Jewish) biased toward Rabbi Singer. He articulates the Jewish position on Tanach and it's true and faithful translations expertly. As far as the Minister goes, I was more interested in hearing about his former career as a federal agent than his tired and long-refuted arguments to ""prove"" Jesus is the Jewish Messiah using OUR Tanach! What chutzpah!! A great debate regardless of the obvious outcome.",1298160000,8,532,4.9222222222222225
