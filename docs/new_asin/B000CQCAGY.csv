Another one is on how to use theme to hone the script during rewrites. Jim's passion for movies and friendly tone make it a pleasure to watch. Highly recommended!",1176508800,,346,4.596774193548387
8100266,5,B000CQCAGY,"This DVD isn't just about killer endings, it's about creating a killer screenplay, as well.  James Mercurio goes through what is needed for any good screenplay, and tells you how to bring everything together at the end to make it all work.  He also uses examples from real movies and points out specific scenes where things happen that relate to what he's talking about, then tells you why it works.  James Mercurio is also an energetic speaker that's actually interesting to listen to, so you're not falling asleep while taking in all this good info.  Definitely worth the buy.",1149638400,,578,4.808080808080808
8100267,5,B000CQCAGY,"I was a little worried that this DVD would be limited to what a climactic scene should look like.  Boy was I wrong.  Mercurio does cover killer endings, but he also uses the importance of the ending to inform everything from character development to theme to foreshadowing.

Unlike some other screenwriting how-tos, I get the feeling that Mercurio has lived the screenwriting process.  He respects the work that goes into writing a movie, and his advice is grounded in the reality of the writing process.  He knows his stuff, but he also has a passion for good movies and he obviously wants his viewer to succeed in writing them.  Watching the DVD, I was inspired to write a better movie so I could make him feel the same goosebumps he gets when discussing great movies.  I strongly recommend this DVD.",1148342400,,802,4.685714285714286
8100268,5,B000CQCAGY,"This is a must-have DVD for screenwriters everywhere.  Killer Endings is indeed a misnomer as James explains that your ending is where your main character makes the choice that defines his transformation, and you can't have that until you know several things.  You have to know what the central dilemma is, who your character is and what he wants, needs and fears, and you have to know what your theme is.  When all those elements come together in one final moment, you have your killer ending.  So the DVD is really about constructing all of those pieces, and James gives you several different ways in which you can approach conceiving of your ending, citing examples from LA Confidential, 8 Mile, Sideways, Million Dollar Baby, Star Wars, the Godfather and Jaws.

I've read a lot of books on screenwriting and this was far more helpful in a much shorter time span.  Very well thought out presentation.  There's never a moment where you're going ""yeah, yeah, I know, get on with it.""  He's not re-inventing the wheel with the points he's bringing up, so you certainly will never feel lost or overwhelmed, but he DOES process normal script conventions in a way that gives you a new, fresh and exciting way to examine your story and your ideas.  Well worth the price of admission.",1147737600,,1279,4.725225225225225
