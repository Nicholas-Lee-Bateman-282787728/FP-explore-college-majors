6899336,2,B00R6HLE1O,"Talk about a series that just fast fowarded YEARS and has me scratching my head how we got from the end of season 2 to the beginning of season 3.

What a disappointment. .... Kitty and Frank got married... considering that storyline was a big part of season 2...I feel cheated

Miss Mardle and Florian? OMG ...I'm so angry that storyline was just not addressed what all transpired there....would have loved to have seen her in a happy relationship but nooooooooooooo not happening here. You're left wondering what happened until someone actually says he died in the war.

Not my favorite season... perhaps my least favorite out of all 4.... and then losing Agnes and Mr Towler in the story as well just left me frustrated.

Yes they tried to garnish my attention by focusing on other characters but unfortunately their character choices of focus were characters I really didn't care for....and still dont",1503100800,,904,4.85064935064935

6899362,3,B00R6HLE1O,"With the departure of Lady May, as well as Agnes and Henri, there is something missing.  Loxley is too stereotypical.  Needs some depth to the character.  I like Ms. Wells and I think Rosalie and the husband need more of a role.  And what is with Violet and Rosalie's American accents?  They don't sound natural.  Are those women actresses from abroad??

Every episode of Mr. Selfridge is a feast for the eyes: the costumes, window displays, street scenes, merchandise on display and so much more are incredibly and happily stimulating visually. And what of the plot? Well, no spoilers here, just suffice it to say that this charming period drama is a soap for people who don't like soaps. The performances? Stellar! But, you know that if you're on season 3. You've come this far, take the plunge and watch on!

6899527,4,B00R6HLE1O,"I loved watching this series and watching how women's clothes, hair and makeup changed over a very short period of time. The British suffragette movement was extremely influential, and World War I necessitated women needing clothes they could actually move in. Enter the French slip-dresses and pants, exit the corsets and bustles, voila! Flappers  The whole series is a history lesson with enough comedy and drama to keep it interesting. Mr Selfridge was a true genius, and as such, prone to being his own worst enemy. Keep your eyes on the annoying Kitty, she blossoms into the strongest character!

The only storyline I didn't really care about was Victor and the role of the British mobsters, but that's an important part of US history as well. Everything that happens during the series predates US history and culture by about 10 years.",1483920000,,841,4.957446808510638

I was so intrigued by the interesting Mr. Selfridge that I got the book upon which this is based.  The real Harry Gordon Selfridge was even more interesting than the series portrays.  Almost any ""trick"" that a large retail store uses to build traffic, Selfridge either came up with it or mastered, including creative window displays, perfume counters by the front door (originally to combat the smells from the street) and letting customers ""shop"" by touching the merchandise and not having to ask a salesperson to get it out for them.

I only continued watching it because I was in love with the characters, but they weren't even acting like themselves which was upsetting and unsettling to watch.

6899983,1,B00R6HLE1O,"Really disappointed with this season. Not sure if they changed the writers or producers or what but the entire season was so over the top melodramatic and just plain stupid. Written like a D-List soap opera. Hard to even fathom the ridiculous storylines, not sure why they couldn't focus on the store and the characters that drew us to the series in the first place. My advice is if you enjoyed the first 2 seasons stop watching after that; if you waste your time watching Season 3 you will be utterly disappointed and end up hating the series. You aren't missing anything by skipping this nonsense. Spend your time on anything else, totally and utterly ridiculous what they have done to this show.",1474848000,3,698,4.682926829268292

6899986,4,B00R6HLE1O,"The quality of Season 3 is 5 stars for the great acting, actors and period costumes but we deducted a star for being ask to pay per episode for the 4th Season. Yes, we loved the series to this point and will most likely love Season 4 but for now, we will take a break and wait for it to be added to Prime's free offerings and if that does not happen, we will simply miss out. Thanks for the great entertainment up to this point.",1474848000,,428,3.988372093023256

6900071,4,B00R6HLE1O,"My wife and I suffered major withdrawal symptoms after watching the last episode of ""Downtown Abbey."" A friend recommended ""Mr. Selfridge,"" a series based in WWI era-England -- ""Downton Abbey"" but with more Yanks. It took some time getting accustomed to Jeremy Priven (the maniacal Hollywood agent from ""Entourage"") as an extroverted but proper American businessman. But once we jumped over that hurdle, we settled in and really enjoyed the show. Where ""Downton Abbey"" portrays the conservative, landed aristocracy, ""Mr. Selfridge"" portrays the up-and-coming mercantile class. The show stays close to its historical roots, and it develops a strong cast of sympathetic characters. If ""Downton Abbey"" rates 5 stars, ""Mr. Selfridge"" deserves a solid 4 stars.",1473638400,,755,5.517241379310345

It's easy to get sucked into the drama of the story and I looked forward to each episode.  I gave this series 4 stars because, at times, some of the acting felt over done by some of the actors. It was still acted well if you accept it for the ""soap opera-like"" genre it is meant to be.  Would recommend!",1473465600,,474,4.3522727272727275

He was a wealthy American business man in the early 1900's that set out for merry old London to establish a new brand of shopping stores. The overall plot is good and the characters are quite interesting. If you want interesting programming without the usual splashes of gratuitous sexual scenes, and extreme vulgar language, you'll like this one.",1472774400,,510,4.873563218390805

6900217,5,B00R6HLE1O,"25 year old Male here. This show taught me just how true it is not judge a book by its cover. after reading the description I had no interest. I only gave the show a chance because Jeremy Piven (the main actor) is the man and is a great actor. The show is spectacular, every episode of it. For guys and gals of all ages. So happy I gave it a chance, now I am going to be more open minded about what I watch. one of my favorite shows.

6900249,3,B00R6HLE1O,"A little bit of a spoiler alert. There are characters that made the first two seasons enjoyable that are not present in the third season. Loved the first two seasons, third season...not so much. It's still better than your average American drama, outside of the good crime shows like NCIS and Castle and such. Hoping the fourth and final season redeems it, although having researched the real person this series is based on, I'm not holding out much hope. If the fourth season goes the way of the third season, I would advise those that enjoyed the first two seasons to skip the last two. Unfortunately.",1470700800,,603,4.69811320754717

6900290,4,B00R6HLE1O,I love this show. Jeremy Pivens is a lovely surprise in an unlikely role. Period pieces are my guilty pleasures when I don't have time to read a book. The American entrepreneurship fits wonderfully in this English period of changing propriety. Just as Downton Abbey and Upstairs Downstairs enlightened audiences about the inner workings of British aristocracy and the flaws that made it an unsustainable way of life in the 20th century so does Mr. Selfridge. Selfridge confronts early century British moires as they overlay society in the turn of the century. Selfridge is the rock on which these patterns reconcile. brilliantly done with much to recommend it.,1469923200,,660,5.12037037037037

The series is perfectly cast and plays out well both on a personal level regarding the individual characters and as a broader piece on early 20th century capitalism.  There is much here about human strengths and weaknesses battling each other.  Selfridge is a fascinating man, brilliant in many ways, hard-working, driven, industrious, fair and generous, yet flawed.  He is too easily fooled, bamboozled, misled and stubborn, which leads to embarrassment and failure in some enterprises.  He is often is own worst enemy.",1467244800,,574,5.252747252747253

6900546,1,B00R6HLE1O,"I enjoyed season 1  and part of season 2 it became hard to ignore  the Inconsistent character development as time went on. The characters in Mr Selfridge seem to be based on a true story, whom is not very endearing. Mr Selfridge is a man w**** who also oves his wife. ?
 On one hand he cares about his family and on the other hand he works constantly and neglect them. Season 3 begins the clear decline of quality love story development and character become boring and the storylines drag on and on.
And there is a love triangle weaved throughout this between two men and a woman. And they try to make it so that you might like both of the men. One of them it works for the restaurant and actually he's kind and moral but is also willing to sleep with anything that will give him a advantage in life, and then later act like he's the ideal man for the heroine in the series.  All the plot twists between the slow triangular silly and foolish, hard for your mind to emotionally buy
The facial expressions of sadness on some of the characters are just simly reguratated repetitively. They probably didn't need to film season seasons 3 & 4 they could have just replayed the actor's facial expressions from earlier Seasons shooting sessions and inserted them into their constant soap opera drama. It's too bad I enjoy a good slow moving BBC specia.l I am even sure how this made it on Masterpiece Theater.

6900570,2,B00R6HLE1O,"The series has less and less to do with the running of a retail store and more to do with the personal lives of existing and new characters.  The thing is, you Selfridge could have any job, or not even have a job, and most of the plots in the series would be unchanged.  It just a soap opera with over the top, unrealistic drama.  And, season ending 'cliff hangers' are virtually ignored the following season.  For the most part you could watch the seasons in any order and it wouldn't make much differnence.",1466467200,2,508,4.372340425531915

The costumes and make-up are absolutely gorgeous, except the men's lips are too pink (Victor Colleano, Gordon Selfridge, Sergei).

I mean, who really thinks about what it must have been like in London after the first world war. This program educates, at least for those who appreciate being educated, and entertains. It presents a diverse population of characters who grow and play with your emotions; highs and lows. I loved it - was not disappointed as I'm sure any viewer will be.",1454198400,,530,4.53125

I have not been a Jeremy Piven fan. In fact, I can't believe he was associate with the ""Entourage"".  But in this, he shines. He has captured the sense of HG Selfridge as well as can be from the distance of 100 years. The supporting cast is phenomenal. I can't pick a favorite because they are all outstanding.

Costumes. OMG. Between what the characters wear and what you see in the store, makes you wish time travel really was possible. It is incredibly interesting, well cast and fun to watch.",1453075200,,652,4.564102564102564

6900670,2,B00R6HLE1O,"I loved seasons 1 & 2.  But season 3 is quite a disappointment!  I'm finishing the series because I loved the first two seasons so much I kept hoping it would return to its former charm (that, and I'm recovering from back surgery, so being stuck in bed leaves me few options).

This season, the storylines have veered far from anything near the realm of truth of the actual Mr. Selfridge's life. They are overly dramatic and ridiculous. Almost as ridiculous as the Tointon sister's (Selfridge sister's) acting... Really, really bad! They are British, it turns out, speaking in American accents, which is over done and it sounds like they're at best, over enunciating, but more likely yelling their lines.

My last criticism is for the hairstylist. What is the deal?! Most of the curly hairstyles (which by the way, while I'm no expert, I don't think are at all appropriate for the time period), look the way mine did as a 10 year old, the morning after I took out those pink styrofoam curlers my mom put in the morning before; Frizzy and out of control.",1449532800,3,1053,4.614973262032086

If you are a die-hard Selfridge lover I'm sure you adamantly disagree.  I would compare you to someone who loves someone so much that you become an enabler to the alcoholic/addict that beats you and then cries and tells you s/he loves you and you forgive them.  Yes, the costumes still look good and the actors are well chosen - Jeremy Piven is great in this.  But, for me, this season is where the series dies.",1447718400,3,545,4.4646464646464645

6900754,2,B00R6HLE1O,"Too much to ""formula"" (and a bad formila at that) with what seemed a disdain for the viewers sensibilities.  Strike 1:  the sexist writers keep the boy ""little punk"" son (attempting to justify retaining that youngster actor by giving him a pitiful mustache .. thinking that would be enough to pass him off as 5 years older ... failing miserably).  So there's no way they can justify replacing the older daughter actress for some new one who not only looks nothing like the original, but demolishes any continuity. If we're expected to believe that boy-man, there's no excuse for switching out the older daughter (the equally young actress couldn't be any more unbelievable than the boy was).
  Strike 2:  Another boys-club writer-producer decision was to make Agnes give up her career.  Are we to swallow this as the same Agnes who loved the store so much during the first 2 seasons?  Even her first guy -- making a real man's self-sacrifice to give her up so she could do what she loved -- let us feel Agnes was the real magic of Selfridges.  As Lady Mae onxe said,""Bunkum!""
  Maybe we should except these smarmy storylines from a writer-producer team so wimpy that they switch the real historical ""Henri"" from a gay to straight man.  That whole Agnes-Henri storyline was false from rhe get-go ... and, an offensive insult to the memory of the real, historical man -- not to mention reflective of the deep homophobic mentality of this production team.
  Third chauvinistic strike: ,they nixed Lady Mae ... a strong and delightful woman character played by a brilliant, engaging actress. Maybe the actress was brilliant enough to jump ship once she saw how the writers were butchering the 3rd season.  This splended actress is too good for the farce of Season 3.
  Yet, they kept her loser husband. But of course ... he's a MALE actor, so is more valuable to their story-line.
  Except for Kitty and finally [hurrah!] Miss M (who play strong woman) almost every one of the female characters are either doormats or manipulative-but-lovestruck ninnies. What a pack of unlikable characters and disappointing storylines Season 3 turned out to be.  Most especially, the three pseudo-adult Selfridge children played by in equally unlikable fashion by the three actors (witless doormat oldest sister, shallow-selfish doormat second sister, and wimpy-halfwit and hair-lip heir-apparent son).
  By the way ... Mr. Thackeray was dead-on RIGHT what he said to Mr. Selfridge ... to bad the whistleblower got fired for being the only one standing up to the Plutocrat.  I reallt think the writers intended that exchange as a way to show Selfridge as a hero booting the bad-guy.  Only shows what clueles, mutual ego-inflating sessions the writer meetings must have been this time around.
  Oh, and nix the make-up artist used in Seasons 2 and 3.  Way, way, WAY to heavy makeup.",1444521600,6,2862,4.908333333333333

6900914,5,B00R6HLE1O,"This season continues with the interesting social and historical context we got in Season 2.  Unfortunately, a few favorite characters exit, but some new ones come on board, and leave you guessing as to their motives for the better part of the season.  I always find ambiguous characters fun.

The weakness of this season is probably the sheer number of characters and story lines.  It could have used a bit of pruning, so that fewer characters could have been developed in more depth.

The strength of the season was Selfridge's Greek tragedy story arc.  Piven does a wonderful job of making Harry charismatic, inspiring, and lovable, but at the same time infuriating, heartbreaking, and dangerous to rely on.",1437091200,,710,4.97457627118644

6900916,5,B00R6HLE1O,"A great follow-up to Seasons 1 & 2! This period piece has relevance to the USA even though it takes place in England. Mr. Selfridge is an authentic retail innovator who was trained in Chicago by Marshall Field and went on to open the unique Selfridge's dept. store in England. Swirling around the always changing retail climate are stories of people involved, the participation in WWI by males, the females who pick up the slack left by the men who went off to war, the end of war stories, romances, new medical discoveries, events that were current to the period. Acting, characterization, costuming, and a quick plot pace make this series so enjoyable. You should start with Season 1! Happy viewing!",1436918400,,701,4.801652892561983

6900961,4,B00R6HLE1O,"I've been watching the series from the beginning. It's a good series but not my favorite. I'm still disappointed about the cancelled  ""The Paradise"" which I thought was better. I always miss some of the episodes on tv so I need to buy the disks. But unfortunately Amazon will no longer allow me to sell the movies back on Amazon as used. I only watch the disks once and they stay almost brand new. I've been buying thousands of dollars at Amazon for years but I am going to be first looking to purchase what I want elsewhere now and I will no longer buy their new or used movies here. They are becoming to strict for me. I am a senior and not doing anything illegal so I don't think I should have to buy a yearly 39.99 power buyer ability at Amazon just to sell back a couple new movies I buy. A shame these companies get so greedy and consumer unfriendly. I wrote to them and get a form letter back stating I can not sell it back. They will buy it back as a gift card for me for almost nothing. Not doing that, will rather donate it. Upset with them.",1435881600,2,1051,4.126829268292683

6900987,4,B00R6HLE1O,"Warning: This review has spoilers. I loved the first two seasons of Mr. Selfridge but am disappointed with this third season. I know that some of it is because it is following the real Harry's life: Rose did die, for example, and her loss really affected the slow. I also miss Lady Mae tremendously, and I've had quite enough of the slimy Lord Loxley (I'm sure Harry would agree). I grieve for Agnes and Henri and deeply miss them (but in their case, the storyline was strong and added a great deal to the early episodes of this season).. I also know that eventually, Harry lost his millions--but wasn't that toward the end of his life? What bothers me about this season is that so much of the fictional characters' lives are going off the tracks. Why has Victor changed into a completely different man? Why did Doris have to be bumped off? Just as a plot device to get Gordon and Josie back together?? She deserves better. And Harry, who was once a good, if risky businessman, has turned into an idiot. I'm not even going into the Miss Web plotline, but, really?? I will finish watching this season, and I'll watch season four, but I don't have high hopes for it. (In terms of the acting, I do think that JeremyPiven is terrific. I also love Amanda Abbingdon as Josie Mardle, Callum Callingham as George and Ron Cook as Mr. Crabb.)",1435276800,25,1332,4.48559670781893

(Happy Days reference).  But to the extent that Selfridge himself started to self-destruct after his wife's death, I guess the show just parallels his life.  I'm just sorry to no longer see the exuberant and irreverent Yank in London setting society on the edge.

Harry Selfridge, an American retailer, was a most interesting man who brought modern day shopping to London back in the early 1900's when ladies dealt with their milliner for custom-made hats, their seamstress for a lovely dress, a cobbler for shoes, and so forth.  Selfridge was the genius who brought his ideas across the pond to offer a woman once place where all her dressing needs might be found under one, elegant roof. Selfridge's of London had a tea room for dining as one shopped, and was smart enough to include the first bathroom for ladies in a store during a time when women would need to take a return carriage home should they need to go to the bathroom while shopping.  Selfridge knew simple things like this would allow the women to continue shopping for longer periods. Woven through the historical facts is the true story of his gambling, girlfriends, wife, and competitors. Women will really enjoy this 3 season PBS gem.",1433376000,,1012,4.738636363636363

6901168,5,B00R6HLE1O,"I didn't want to watch this series at first because when I saw the first episode it just seemed like the usual story of some successful guy neglecting his family and having affairs.  Instead of watching the series I skipped to the documentary about Mr. Selfridge and learned a little bit more about his life.  That got me curious so I went back through Amazon Instant Video to watch all the episodes I had missed and then made sure to catch up live with Season 3.  The more I watched, the more I loved the series. The main character is flawed but lovable. Many of the innovations he made in stores like Selfidges are illustated beautifully in the series, which have become common place today (like putting cosmetics and perfume at the front of the store). With the emergence of the Dolly sisters at the end of season 3 I know from the documentary things will get even more ""interesting"" come Season 4.  The other characters in the store all struggle with being true to themselves and learning how to be good to each other, even if they fail at times.  Overall, a really enjoyable ride.  SPOILER ALERT from this point forward.  I know from the documentary that Mr. Selfridge's son ends up having a secret marriage and family.  That plot line is emerging in Season 3.  It will be interesting to see how that plays out in Season 4.  Enjoy.",1432252800,,1336,4.5062240663900415

I wasn't sure I'd like it for the first 15 minutes of episode 1 season 1. But by the end of the show, I had to know what happened.  It was great while I could watch on demand every day.

We can't even scream at Harry like Mr. Crabb did to Mr. Grove...Even Mr. Grove did a turnaround to save himself and his children.  He needs to kiss the ground Josie walks on everyday for the rest of his life because she will save Grove and his children not by her money though that will help but because she is a great woman and she will be there for all of them in the most dynamic ways only a real woman can fulfill especially when she is helplessly in love with a character like Mr. Grove.--MO",1431993600,,822,4.44

6901185,4,B00R6HLE1O,"A London department store of a century ago proves to be the ideal stage for comedy, tragedy, intrigue, suspense, romance (licit and il), fashion, style and elegance. It isn't merely a metaphor for life itself, it is a universe unto itself.

The central character is graced with genius, ambition, compassion and hubris, ensuring healthy doses of triumph and tragedy in each season. Jeremy Piven is the nucleus for a handful of stories always swirling within and without Selfridge's Department Store. Not only is his retailing achievement a tour de force, but so is his ability to project Selfridge, the man, with depth and dimension.

Two steps above the typical mini-series, ""Mr. Selfridge"" is a visual delight and exceptionally good theatre.",1431907200,2,742,5.175

The third season connects with post-war issues, Selfridge expansion, female employees, crisis leads to conflict over and over, secrets run rampant spicing up the relationships. Some good Dixie-Land music in Colleano Club (Trystan Gravelle).

[4] Violette gets frisky with a pub owner. Harry & Nancy get socially friendly. Agnes & Henri at crisis point. Store security begins.

[5] New Store Deputy Mgr position creates in-house competition. Mother-in-law Marie's debt is uncovered by Harry's mom (Kika Markham.) Bad press--hate mail--and Selfridge kids in affairs.
[6] Harry sells store shares to keep the housing project afloat. Rosalie joins Serge to Paris in search of his aeroplane dream. Another secret backfires tragically.
[7] Loxley buys Harry's shares and now sits on Selfridge board. Bad to worse for Mr Grove. Harry's financial balance is spiraling--down.

[8] Store marks the Treaty of Versailles. Gordon & Grace are, oops, ""interrupted."" More good items include a son returns home and a proposal.
[9]A mysterious trunk arrives at the Selfridges from the Russian Embassy. Nancy ""looses"" the engagement ring and Harry's job is on the line.
[10] Nancy is found out. Several big choices are required to end this season. Plenty left up in the air, suggesting the intent to go into season 4. The elaborate costly sets almost require more use, plus the series is a huge hit. Can't wait for more.

6901287,3,B00R6HLE1O,"Mr. Selfridge is insufferable.  I'm talking about Jeremy Pivennot the rest of the cast who range from mediocre to excellent. The problem with Piven in this role is that he comes off as though he has done more stage acting (as in melodramas or musical theater) than film or TVmeaning that his performance is over-the-top, almost caricature for this medium. He is neither believable or authentic.  While I get the idea that his character is supposed to be a bigger-than-life showman type (modeled after the real-life Selfridge), that shouldn't translate into playing it shallow and one-dimensional.  Unfortunately, that's exactly how Piven does play it.  He stays on one level (mostly declamatory) and that ""level"" is annoying. There are no shades, no nuances, and little complexity to his character. Proof of this is early on, I found myself not giving a whit what happened to him.  (The only thing that I did want to have happen to him was for him to have been replaced by another actor early on.) Which leads me to ask: Why oh why did they pick Piven for this role?  I'm told that he was great in Entourage (I never saw it so I can't speak to his performance in that role) but in a period costume drama he sucks. He strikes the completely wrong tone all across the board.  I thought I had reached my limit for tolerating his uninspiring performance until the scene where his wife tells him she is dying. From his initial reaction when she told him that she had only a short time left to live, to his standing and throwing flowers on her grave there was not a shred of believability that this was a man who was grieving. (He's not even believable as a seducer, sad to say.)

Having said that, I still watch the showcertainly not for Piven who, not unlike the ""coin affect"" in the classic time-travel film Somewhere in Time,  manages to keep jerking me out of the believability of that time and place. Rather, I continue to watch it for a certain handsome French man and the rest of a largely stellar cast who, despite the ridiculous performance of Piven, manage to keep me engaged. But that's only because I'm addicted to historical dramas and will take ""my fix"" diluted with a little synthetic substance if I have to. :)",1429833600,12,2221,4.60253164556962

6901298,4,B00R6HLE1O,"First off, as you may know if you read my other Amazon reviews - I hate reviews with spoilers - so you won't see any in this review. Just helpful comments, I hope. Next, you should be aware that Amazon groups ALL reviews of ALL formats (TV, Streaming, DVD and BD) together so you will see reviews of the TV version (which was slightly edited for PBS) and streaming versions (which do not include ""Bonus Features""). I always suggest that potential customers sort the reviews by ""Most Recent"" (there is an option) and to see what format is being reviewed. Now on to Season 3.... This review is of the BD version - I received a copy in advance for review. It will be released on May 5, 2015

If you've come to this review, most likely you have seen Seasons One and Two of this series produced, not by the BBC, but by the British commercial network ITV, so you know that this is a fictional melodrama  based on a factual book. Nearly all the characters were real people and most of the events are also. As Season Two ended, many of the men in London including Selfridge's staff were going off to war. Season Three jumps forward to 1918 and the end of the war. This is nearly 10 years later. While Mr. Selfridge's wife, Rose, had died, and their three children are now grown, most of  the rest of the cast seems not to have aged - which is odd.  Mr. Crabb, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Grove look just like they did in Season 2. Not a major drawback - just an observation.

This time a few new characters are added (in the first 15 minutes of Episode One, so telling you is not IMHO a ""spoiler""). Daughter Rosalie is now married (to the son of a Russian czarina) and there may be a new female ""love interest"" for Harry. But Harry's nemesis Lord Luxley is back to make Harry's life miserable and the British Mafia (as well as the Police captain) are is forcing club owners split their profits. Yes, things go on in the store and there are some ""surprise"" departures, but there is more about the Selfridge ""family"" this time.

""Possible Spoiler"" ALERT: Skip this paragraph if you have any concern. I spread out my viewing over 3 or 4 nights and was hoping that all ends would be tied up (well mostly) by the end of the 10 48 minute episodes. When I saw Season One, I never expected there to be a Season Two. And the writers left it so that Season One stood on its own. For Season Three, I guess they assumed there would be a Season Four. From what I've seen there are plans to have a Season 4 which would be the final season. As I said, I do not like ""spoilers"" but I do feel it an obligation to let you know there are quite a few ""loose"" ends as Season 3 ends. If it is important to you to have things all tied up, you should know that they won't be.

I like the many characters and so I concentrated on them and put aside the plot twists that make this a melodrama.

The Bluray includes one hefty ""bonus feature"". It is a 30 minute ""behind the scenes"" featurette which includes interviews with most of the key actors as well as the production team. There are some clips from the show but they are short and only add to the comments. I found this informative (though maybe a bit too much black slapping) and worth your time. But watch it AFTER you have seen the season.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Now the store is just a backdrop along with a speakeasy started by a former employee. THAT is a storyline that could easily be dropped. The writers and director should rewatch the first two seasons.

Weren't sure we liked Jeremy Piven, Selfridge, nor his acting at first, but he has really grown on us and we love him.  Then we weren't sure why we liked the series so much until we came to realize that the characters were unique and wonderful as were the actors playing their roles. There are many really likable, lovable folks, some unique and nasty, some well intentioned but humanly flawed.  Even the really bad ones are so bad they're good!  The characters are generally easy to remember as they weave in and out of view despite the huge cast, because they are indeed so memorable.  We missed them at each episode's end and were so disappointed after season finale.  But, they are back!  We are happy!",1428451200,2,776,4.539568345323741

8694263,1,B00R6HLE1O,"With the death of Rose, the new characters that were introduced in Season 2 took over and the overall level of acting took a nosedive.  Mr. Piven, who, surrounded by high caliber actors in Season One was holding steady at a twitch, devolved into a puddle of twitching, significant looks, and double takes with addition of soap opera level actors.  Central casting must have called Overactors Anonymous to fill the ranks.
The writing seems to have gone downhill as well.  It started with the writers refusing to name - or even use an outdated term - for Roses made up lung disease.  (The real Rose died in the flu pandemic of 1918.  Why was that idea rejected, I wonder?)  All they gave were hints of how horrible it was.  (ie: Viewer:  Use your own imagination!) And yet, it apparently took 4 years to kill her.  And the storyline with Harry and Nancy.... Oy.
Finally, what in God's name is with the Bond music at the close of episode 10?!  Did the show runners LOSE their minds?  Were they doing drugs in post production?  The best thing about it is that it confirms the absolute mess this show has become.",1533254400,,1107,4.507537688442211
