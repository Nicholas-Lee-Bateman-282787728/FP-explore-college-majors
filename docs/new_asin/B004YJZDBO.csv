4499758,3,B004YJZDBO,"I have a orei all region blu ray player which also does 3d blu ray. And this blu ray is a region b (europeon) 3d blu ray. So without that type of player you can only watch the dvd version. This was shot in 3d and the 3d makes a HUGE difference in this movie. Many scenes are set up for 3d and in 2d the effect is lost. The movie was a joint canadian/italian low budget movie. with a mix of both canadian and italian actors who are all speaking english. The 3d here is much better than movie that was NOT shot in it and put out in 3d. Here it's outstanding! After all this was shot with 3d cameras, and there's only a few sceens with ghosting in it. Most of the 3d is just stunning.  Storywise the movie is a story about living addictions and people lost in a old monastary. Which is ok, and not a one star movie. The acting was decent here and not as bad as many sci fi movies actually. The killings in this movie are actually quite bloodless and there's no gore. Which made this a pg rated movie that is safe for kids. It's just a little horror movie that you would see by the dozen throughout the years. The effects were actually very good mostly for this type of budget , if you saw them in 3d you would enjoy this much more and the effects stand out. Ok, compared to a A movie , most b movies like this are two star affairs. but on a low budget HORROR movie scale this is a decent little flick with GREAT 3d. (only for all region blu ray players though, which you can buy right here on amazon.com. ) There are no extras on this really either.",1352505600,,1546,4.01948051948052
4499759,4,B004YJZDBO,it was okay... nothing special about it. it is a b rated horror movie so you really get what you pay for and ita about as good as you expect.,1338422400,,141,3.7333333333333334
4499760,3,B004YJZDBO,"I was thinking just the other day...what this world needs more than anything else is another movie with the title of ""Hidden."" And then lo and behold I saw this one! Although to be honest, the original title was ""Hidden 3D"" which for some strange reason the producers dropped the ""3D"" which I thought was odd considering the high quality of ""Valentine's Day 3D.""

There isn't much of a mystery as the beginning explains everything. Susan Carter (Dawn Ford) runs a mental institution called ""Divine Sanctuary of Hope."" She has created a machine called ""Ventris"" because Tetras was already taken. It cures mental addiction. It injects a venom into the brain from an insect that looks like a BA CG lightning bug. The addiction then manifests itself as an infant growing inside the person like a tumor, but as Arnold would say, ""It's not a tumor."" No womb required.

When Susan dies, her heavy drinking son Brian (Sean Clement) inherits the place in spite of the fact he disliked his own mother. He takes a crew out to the old abandoned place including crusty Chester (Allan Kolman) who is the person movies cast when Donald Sutherland won't accept the role. Considering the low quality of roles Sutherland has taken here of late, this should be a sign as to the quality of this film.

We already know there is a creature running around killing people (it shows us) and if you've ever watched a horror movie before, you know the rest of the overly predictable plot.

Brian's friend Simon (Jason Blicker) has big resort plans for this snowy isolated establishment. Brian wants to demolish the building. The mutants are MST comical and I was laughing at scenes that were supposed to scare you. On the MST scale: 3 stars. Great movie to show kids who want to catch fireflies.

No f-bombs that I recall, no sex, no nudity. Drinking, minor drug use",1335657600,2,1839,4.698757763975156
4499761,1,B004YJZDBO,"This movie is terrible, reason - special effects and Scifi Channel acting. The special effects where dismal. The supporting cast
characters where so typical: whining big boobed girl friend, guy who only cares about money, silly dope smoking youths, weak-
kneed main male character, cry-baby main female lead. Add all this up and add SciFi channel acting you get The Hidden a foregettable
to-DVD horror film.",1335225600,,407,5.181818181818182
4499762,1,B004YJZDBO,"""Hidden"" starts with an interesting premise.  After the death of his mother, Brian Karter (Sean Clement) learns that he has inherited ""The Sanctuary,"" home to her experimental addiction treatment center.  During a tour of the decrepit facility, Brian and his friends uncover a terrible secret.  Hidden in the bowels of the abandoned building there exists a revolutionary machine capable of curing any addiction, but only at a terrifying price -- the manifestation of mutant offspring, hungry for flesh.

Even though ""Hidden"" is a low-budget horror flick, it breaks new ground for dopiness.  It overexplains what should be left unstated.  When there's too much explanation of how and why things are happening, the danger is sounding dumb.  That's what happens here.  Cliches abound, from the remote setting, cheap shocks, characters who insist on venturing off into danger, and assorted inevitable deaths.

Essentially a ""Shutter Island"" wannabe, ""Hidden"" is a pedestiran effort.  There are no bonus extras on this DVD release.",1333238400,2,1026,5.39622641509434
4499763,2,B004YJZDBO,"""Some may see blasphemy where I see nothing short of a miracle."" After the death of his mother and controversial scientist, Brian (Clement) is left to take care of the hospital where she worked. Going in with the intent to sell it, him and his friends soon discover hidden horrors that threaten not only the sale but their lives. For some reason a new sub-genre of horror movies has begun...the movie set in an insane asylum/hospital. After watching about ten of this new category in the last few years I have to wonder how long they will keep it going. While there has been a few good ones (Waking Madison & The Ward) the rest are pretty forgettable. This one falls into the later. If you are a hardcore horror fan and have to watch all of them then this is one to check out. If like me you watch them and wonder why you do then I can say skip this one. Overall, it could have been worse, but it's also not really original either. I say C.",1331769600,,940,4.256983240223463

8448395,3,B004YJZDBO,"Its not near as bad as reviews suggest--the novelty and 3D alone are worth the time and as good as most hollywood trash. Yes you need a multstd 3d blueray player like the Orei (worth doing as there are lots of foreign releases, (especially in 3D) that will likely never be released in USA),  or play it on a pc by changing your region code for one play or of course rip the file.",1454630400,,379,4.121621621621622
8448396,4,B004YJZDBO,"Let me be very clear, the ONLY thing that keeps me from giving this movie five stars is its reliance on an anti-Semitic stereotype. In a movie any less intelligent I might look askance, but here there is no excuse here.  It's a beautiful piece of art and I think if you like horror you should definitely watch it for its artistic merits, but at least for this reviewer the implications of the fact that every single death in this movie would have been preventable if not for the greed of an apparently Jewish character is distracting to no worthwhile end.

8448400,2,B004YJZDBO,"Hidden (Antoine Thomas, 2011)

That Hidden (also released as Hidden 3D) is partly a Canadian production is no surprise at all, given that it is, thematically, a direct descendant of Cronenberg's fantastic 1979 offering The Brood.

...no, okay, I'm not even going to try. Descendant? Rip-off. (And even telling you that is enough of a spoiler that if you're reading this at var.ev. It would have had the big stop sign at the top if the movie poster hadn't actually given the game away.) You've seen the set-up dozens of times before, and usually better: bunch of young-and-beautifuls find their way into an abandoned building (in this case, Brian, played by The Getaway's Sean Clement, inherited his mother's old treatment center), start exploring, and end up crossing paths with something vicious that needs either solving or dispatching so the survivors can get on with their lives. Nothing new here, and nothing new done with itgrafting on someone else's big twist, no matter how good that big twist is, is going to make it seem even tireder than it already was. Give this one a miss. * ",1386288000,,1089,4.844086021505376
8448401,2,B004YJZDBO,"Brian Carter has plenty of reasons for his mommy issues.  Growing up as the son of a well-known rehabilitation specialist who then begins to experiments on addicts, while you sit by and watch, that'll mess you up.  So when his mother dies, Brian doesn't bother going to the funeral.  Afterward a letter arrives via his friend Simon, telling Brian the old monastery where his mother first began her work is still standing, and is now his.  Brian says burn it to the ground, but Simon says let's check it out first, there may be some worth to the old place.

So Simon gathers a team of people--which consists of Simon, his girlfriend Kimberly, her brother Lucas, his girlfriend Rita and Brian' ex Vicky.  There's also Haley, who meets them at the door and shows them around, giving them a little history on the building while they're at it.  Plus there's  an electrician trying to get the power back on.

As expected in a story as formulaic and forgettable as this one, the group slowly splits into smaller groups, which then get picked off by the mysterious creatures lurking inside the building.  Their numbers dwindle until only the survivor is left, and we end with a wink and a grin as it's intimated that quite possibly the danger isn't over.

So what I'm saying is, anyone with any kind of working knowledge of the horror genre in film could have finished this script after the first ten pages.  Maybe that's why it's credited to Alan Smithy and Alana Smithy (story by Mariano Baino--you've never heard of him--and Coralina Caraldi-Tassoni--veteran of Argento's OPERA and MOTHER OF TEARS).  But at least it has a director, of sorts.  Antoine Thomas has no directing credits before or after this movie, so make of that what you will.

The cast is a who's who of faces you may have seen once or twice, if you looked real close, but no one worth giving special attention to, especially considering the performances.

The premise is the real shame here.  Dr. Susan Carter decided to try to make the addictions of the people she treated into a physical being, something that could then be killed.  And, using whatever insane movie logic was at work here, she succeeded.  The addictions then manifested themselves in the physical form of ""babies"" growing inside the addicts.  So far, however, all attempts at excising the creatures resulted in the death of the patients as well.  Except for Breeder 1, Dr. Carter's prize specimen.

Oh, and there's also something about a venomous firefly or something, I don't know; I was only halfway paying attention soon after the movie started.

Plot holes and logic flaws abound--apparently the building hasn't been used in over ten years, but when the power gets restored, Dr. Carter's computers are running just fine, and one accidental bump of the mouse sets one of her video diaries to playing, which I'm pretty sure is not how computers work--but even before I got to those parts, I could tell right away I wasn't in for anything special.  Even the Netflix description sounds boring.

I'm not sure what the impetus was behind the making of HIDDEN 3D, but a quality horror movie wasn't it. The plot structure in unoriginal, the characters are clichs, and the lack of honest horror here is astounding.  It was only 81 minutes, but it was a BORING 81 minutes.

I can't even give this movie credit as being so bad it's good, because it seems as if the makers were trying to make a serious horror movie, but there were just so many strikes against them from the beginning that, from script to screen, this thing was probably doomed every step of the way.  HIDDEN 3D was boring, predictable, and not even remotely terrifying.  Pass on this one.",1381449600,,3680,4.715179968701095
8448402,1,B004YJZDBO,"The only thing ""good"" about the movie is when the characters get killed so you don't have to hear their whining voices anymore which grated my nerves to no end. Not only did the actors were totally awful, so was the story - this doctor ""cures"" addiction by turning it into a physical living being, which resembled cockroaches and children. Go figure. I may as well tell you the ending: The last two surviving actors run out the door and the cockroaches-like bugs chase after them and get killed by the winter. Which is another stupid ending - but the whole movie was MAJOR STUPID. Not even worth a dollar and it was a total waste of time.",1362873600,,638,4.415254237288136
8448403,2,B004YJZDBO,"I knew I was in trouble when I saw ""Directed by M.R."" in the opening credits - it's never a good thing when your director only identifies himself with two initials, especially when those initials aren't even his real ones.  It's even worse when the writers are identified as Alan and Alana Smithee.  (According to the writers, the producers made so many arbitrary changes to the story that they didn't recognize it as their own anymore.)  An hour and a half later, of course, I knew very well why these people didn't want to associate their real names with this film.  Even the title stinks.  Hidden (originally Hidden 3D) - seriously?  You couldn't come up with something better than that, maybe a title that hasn't already been used multiple times already?

Brian Carter (Sean Clement) has spent most of his life trying to forget his mad scientist mother, so he isn't exactly torn up inside when she dies.  He is surprised when he learns he has inherited the Divine Sanctuary of Hope, though, as the infamous addiction therapy clinic was supposedly torn down a decade earlier after charges of torture and all-around quackery were directed at his mother.  One of his buddies (who dreams of turning the place of suffering into a ritzy resort) convinces him to at least go and have a look at the place.  It doesn't take long for Brian to stumble upon a super-secret passageway, which leads underground into his mother's real research lab, the one where she conducted her most gruesome experiments.  Hidden features one of the dumbest premises you're likely to find in a horror movie.  The late Dr. Carter's work involved the transformation of addictions into distinct cellular bodies, which could then be excised like cancer cells.  Poof - no more addiction.  Unfortunately, her tests on human subjects didn't stop there.

The whole basis of this story is laughable, and there's absolutely no suspense or tension as the utterly predictable events play out.  There's also no blood or gore to speak of.  Next to no character development also means you won't really care what happens to any of these people.  It all adds up to a formula for banality, which will have you thinking that the one thing that should have stayed hidden was Hidden itself.",1356134400,,2244,4.814621409921671
