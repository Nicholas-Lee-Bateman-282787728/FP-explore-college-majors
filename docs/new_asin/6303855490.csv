721427,5,6303855490,"I suspect this film may be many viewers first encounter with Bunuel.  It was mine years ago and I struggled while watching it, my literal mind trying to make sense out of scenes, instead of accepting that Bunuels lightly surreal world the marriage of reality and fantasy, of objective and subjective means that while the whole fits together quite nicely, getting too caught up in is this real? or more often how real is this? is a mistake.

Time and revisiting helped me appreciate the film more deeply (interesting how often that's the case with great films), but for the newcomer to Bunuel, I suspect the excellent interviews that Criterion includes on its blu-ray would help as well.  These give a deeper understanding of Bunuels examination, without judgment, of a secretly sexually masochistic woman -- her tear between the reality she lives and the fantasies of what she wants, and how she tries to bring those two together.

A film to see many times.  Its so full of wonderful details (in the soundtrack as well as the images) that I always look forward to re-immersing myself in it.",1462060800,,1090,4.776595744680851

721566,3,6303855490,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 After reading countless reviews on the internet about 'Belle de Jour', I'm still not sure what famed surrealistic director Luis Buuel was trying to say. And if you asked Buuel what the meaning of the film was, he probably would have told you 'it is, what you want it to be'. I have come to conclude that in making a film such as 'Belle de Jour', Buuel is more interested in playing the provocateur than exploring any of the moral issues raised by the film's often cryptic narrative.

Buuel as provocateur is evident in the film's opening sequence. In a matter of a few moments, an idyllic carriage-ride (seemingly a scene influenced by a 19th century romantic novel) morphs into a nightmare sequence of domestic depravity as Buuel's protagonist, Sverine (Catherine Deneuve) is viciously whipped by the menservants of her husband, Pierre. But in a blink of an eye, Buuel has the last laugh (or should I say the first laugh?) when we see that the assault on Sverine is a figment of her imagination. In reality, she is married to Pierre who is a respectable Parisian surgeon in the present day of 1967.

But just as soon as we're introduced to this new 'idyllic' situation, Buuel is committed to shocking us again. Sverine and Pierre's situation is anything but idyllic as Sverine is plagued by nightmares of being sexually abused as a child and resorts to fantasies of sadomasochistic pleasure. As a result, they perversely sleep in separate beds and Pierre patiently tries to understand why his wife won't engage in any sexual relations.

In reality, nothing is normal for Sverine--she must endure Husson, the boyfriend of the couple's friend, Rene, who has no guilt feelings about hitting on her and freely admits that he's a frequent visitor to a high-class whorehouse. This is how Sverine finds out about Madame Anas' establishment, which she at first hesitantly applies for a job at, as a high-class call girl.

While her motive for taking a job as a prostitute may have had to do with her unfortunate sexual experiences as a child, Buuel is more interested in contrasting Sverine's life as an unhappy, chaste housewife with her newfound enjoyment as aggressive sexual neophyte. None of this is shown explicitly and Buuel takes great pleasure in emphasizing Sverine's lack of guilt as she plies her trade amongst a group of decidedly tawdry clients. The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger', who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down (implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex). Sverine also expresses disgust to Madame Anas. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on, but can't help staring through a peephole, confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies.

Buuel will turn things on a head once again, when he introduces us to bad boy criminal, Marcel, a lout with metal teeth, who Sverine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with Sverine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive.

Buuel comes full circle playing with his audience. If Sverine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse, she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all, had she not decided to work at the brothel, Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that Sverine refers to Pierre's ""accident"" as he sits in his wheelchair. An ""accident"" seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an ""accident"" (not the shooting) which caused him to become paralyzed? If so, the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of Sverine's imagination.

The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence, where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and Sverine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Buuel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now Sverine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on Sverine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair, suggesting death.

For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film, 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others (including myself) seek narratives with a more clear-cut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless, in the end, this is a film with a lot more style than substance.",1350691200,5,4899,4.8562874251497
721567,2,6303855490,"This film is typical of movies made is the 60's, the pace is slow and the characters two dimensional. The subject it covered broke some ground at the time but it's pretty tame by today's standards.",1347408000,3,197,4.5

721569,5,6303855490,"Katherine Deneuve needs no presentation; yet, this particular film had enough criticism in its time; the way a housewife needed more excitement in her sexual life was not particularly a politically correct matter. Nowadays, this movie continues removing the taboos on the issue, while housewives develop new techniques to indulge themselves and yet preserve their marriage. For others, the movie was shocking... How in the world a married woman could turn into a crazy, frenetic whore, in an near-to-squizophrenic behaviour... I loved the film since it appeared and I still enjoy it. Catherine is my favourite female actress, disregarding my madness for Marilyn....",1340323200,3,665,5.466019417475728
721570,3,6303855490,"I bought this movie because I was curious to see Catherine Deneuve and the story seemed interesting.

For short Severine, housewife to a doctor, is floating in day dreams to a personal erotic place and scene which she does not share with her husband. The dream characters get the exciting Severine, the doctor gets pretty much nothing. A friend of the doctor, a somewhat shady guy senses that Severine is hiding something in her deep waters and mentions the name and address of a classy brothel. Severine eventually goes there out of curiosity and meets herself begrudgingly as she goes more often. Then she gets used to the escape, and after each occasion coming home she becomes more of a whole wife to her husband. The the aforementioned shady friend, predictably comes and visits the brother. She decides not to go anymore. However one of her regulars got a little too enthousiastic about her, and has his also criminal friend find out her address by following her home. He visits her, sees she loves her husband and does not wish to change for him and decides to kill her husband to change that. He does try to kill him, but is both unsuccesful and is shortly after that killed by the police after he gets into an accident that he tries to run from. The story then ends somewhat disjointed from there as the shady friend visits her and her husband and tells Severine's now paralyzed husband about his wife's escapades.

Much more could and should have been done with the character Severine to give the movie what it needed and deserved. The psychology behind the character Severine is what makes the movie. The lack of investigation and building of the character leaves you with a movie with an interesting story and some great shots from one of the classiest of actresses that I know, but also feeling a little left short of having a seen a full movie.",1338508800,4,1858,4.644376899696049

721572,5,6303855490,"Luis Buuel, is often referred to as a filmmaker who is a master of surrealism.  A filmmaker who is known for his dark humor and one who works best when given that creative freedom.

With a several films in his magnificent oeuvre, Buuel is known for films such as ""Viridiana"", ""Phantom of Liberty"", ""That Obscure Object of Desire"", ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"", ""The Exterminating Angel"" to name a few.

But in 1967, Buuel would direct a French film ""Belle de Jour"" (which translated to ""daylight beauty"") starring popular French actress ""Catherine Deneuve"", who had won the hearts of audiences with the Jacques Demy film ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" in 1964 and the Roman Polanski film ""Repulsion"" in 1965.

For this ""Belle de Jour"", Buuel (along with screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere) would create a film that was very different from the 1928 novel by Joseph Kessel and for those who have worked with him and know of his work, he typically creates films that are far from the screenplay and often injects surrealism, so in this case... What is real and what is fantasy? That is for the viewer to interpret.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Belle de Jour"" is presented in 1:66:1 aspect ratio, color and audio is presented in French monaural with English subtitles. It's important to note that with the 2011 release of ""Belle de Jour"", for those wanting the best picture and audio quality, you may want to opt for the Blu-ray because it is in HD.

For those who owned the old 2002 DVD release, the Criterion Collection 2011 DVD release is so much better than the original in terms of picture quality and content.  While the Blu-ray release will definitely feature sharper and vibrant colors, the DVD still looks good when compared to the old 2002 DVD release.  If anything, the picture quality looks fantastic for a film that is 45-years-old.  Colors look very good but most importantly, there is no enhancement of DNR, and for the most part, picture quality looks very good.  There is one scene that shows its age (as it did in the original 2002 Miramax DVD release) when Sverine is with Marcel and there is major nose.  But that scene is fairly short.  If anything, this is the best that ""Belle de Jour"" has looked on DVD.

According to the Criterion Collection, the new high-definition transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35 mm interpositive. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image System's DVNR was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

As for the monaural soundtrack, the new release was remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm print. Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

Audio-wise, dialogue was clear and I detected no problems or crackle. Doing tests of the old 2002 Miramax DVD release and the 2011 DVD release, there is a slight distinction of clarity in audio but for the most part, the difference is more apparent in the video.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Luis Buuel's exotic masterpiece receives the Criterion Collection treatment and what a wonderful release it turned out to be!

Before discussing the film, what made ""Belle de Jour"" a film that attracted my attention was the fact that Luis Buuel directed it.  For anyone who has seen any of his wonderful films and have gravitated towards his work because of its surrealism, for me...I'm literally grinning while watching his films because he does not follow traditional filmmaking, nor does he want to compartmentalized a storyline and make it simple for the viewer.  His films are notable because he does what he wants and while many question his choices of ""why?"", his answer is typically ""why not?"" and if one had a different viewpoint of his filmmaking, he would answer with a ""if you directed the film with what you want to see...then go for it!"".

He's a filmmaker and a creative artist, and like an artist such as Salvador Dali, you view his films and enjoy it for what it is.  There are too many critics who find Buuel's work so maddening because it's not clear-cut but why should his work be banal?  That is what I love about Buuel films and make me slightly biased towards a more positive viewpoint because his films are non-traditional and quite enjoyable.

Which leads us to ""Belle de Jour"".  Sure, this is not the clearcut storyline that Joseph Kessel wrote in his 1928 novel about a woman named Sverine Srizy who was molested at a young age and lives a double life of being a normal housewife and becoming a prostitute for a few hours in order to fulfill her sexual desires.

In the film adaptation, Buuel does keep the theme, we are aware that Sverine Srizy was molested and because of that, she has harbored sexual feelings of masochism that she is too afraid to ask her husband to do to her.  But while Kessel's book is quite straightforward of one woman pursuing that lifestyle and living a life of unhappily ever after, Buuel shows us reality and shows us fantasy and at the end, both reality and fantasy come together as one.

One must remember that in 1967, this film was rather shocking to many people.  For one, unlike today where one can psychoanalyze a person who has been molested and growing up to have some major issues, back then, it was an issue that was rarely discussed.  And also, rarely do you find a film that focuses on a protagonist who has masochistic desires.

The film begins with Sverine Srizy being led out to a car by her husband Pierre and is tied up, her bra removed and is whipped and is kissed by another man.  A fantasy.

But then there are many other fantasies with Sverine going under the table with Monsieur Husson and while the table is shaking, her husband and friend are carrying on with a conversation. To being with a man who is interested in possibly using an insect and using it for some sexual pleasure to another man who has an unusual sexual desire by having Sverine in a coffin and even a scene where she is kissed by her madame.

And each fantasy, we see her sexual desire escalating and also introducing things that may be a bit bizarre but she she enjoys it until things become dangerous. And the way it is presented by Luis Buuel is not clear-cut like the book but done with a great touch of surrealism with amazing efficacy.

And of course, Catherine Deneuve is absolutely wonderful in her performance.  Bringing this calm but also sexually dangerous side to her character which was quite intriguing as she has considered herself as an introverted person, so to see her playing this role, I was quite amazed the first time I watched it and if you enjoyed this film, you definitely want to watch her next collaboration with Luis Buuel in ""Tristana"" (and equally entertaining is reading ""The Private Diaries of Catherine Deneauve"" which she wrote about her daily experience on working on that film).

What I enjoyed about this Criterion Collection is how this film has meant a lot people and also for Luis Buuel, to see how people have interpreted his film from the insightful audio commentary by Princeton professor Michael Wood and the focus on the feminine sexuality and impact of the film as discussed by activist Susie Bright and UC Berkeley professor Linda Williams.  And also, the addition of the 2011 interview with screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere and also the classic interviews with him and Catherine Deneuve made this release much more entertaining than the 2002 Miramax DVD release.

If anything, it is quite wonderful to finally see this film receiving the Criterion Collection treatment and while I am reviewing the DVD, if you have a Blu-ray player, I definitely recommend going for the HD version as it is the best version out there of this film with wonderful picture quality.  Otherwise if you don't own a Blu-ray player, this 2011 DVD release is still very good, much clearer, sharper than the 2002 DVD release and it looks fantastic for a 45-year-old film.

Overall, ""Belle de Jour"" is just one of the cinema masterpiece in Luis Buuel's oeuvre, but it's a magnificent film that showcased feminine sexuality in a way not seen in cinema at that moment of time.  For those who love surrealism in cinema, especially coming from Luis Buuel, they will find ""Belle de Jour"" to be a wonderful experience.

For the cineaste, this film is recommended!",1335571200,18,9648,4.828571428571428
721573,5,6303855490,You never saw Belle de Jour in such a quality of images and sound.

721594,5,6303855490,"Criterion's foray into high-definition transfers has, thus far, set the standard for the medium and Belle Du Jour is no exception to that. The palette is crisp, the details sharp and, while not reaching the height of clarity that 8 1/2 did, is definitely a credit to the medium. The film itself, of course, is a truly engaging journey through one persons pathology and, in true Bunuel fashion, left turns and surreal imagery abounds. Suffice it to say, this is the best version of the one of the best films of all time. How can you go wrong?",1328140800,21,541,4.530612244897959

721596,3,6303855490,"The opening scene suggests what is to follow. The husband's expression of love, in a horse drawn carriage, suddenly turns to ""you can be rough with the little tramp"", as she is pulled from the carriage by two burly coachmen, tied up, partially stripped and horsewhipped. He then `offers' her to them. To reveal the psychological context would reveal the underlying premise of the story. Catherine Deneuve looks delicious but to me, Genevieve Page is more darkly erotic; a tantalising aura. The Catherine character hears about a friend working in a whorehouse (Page is the potential 'hobby lesbian' madam). The address is given. She hesitates to enter. The curious thing is that she is unable to accept physical love from her husband; she is frigid. The notion of humiliation keeps recurring, in day-dreams; wishful thinking perhaps. The end is slightly confusing except for the psychologically astute. While ground-breaking when first released, the film is now dated, given what is available currently.",1314921600,,1002,5.229813664596273
721597,5,6303855490,"All the best elements of Bunuel's style come together in ""Belle de Jour"".  This film remains dreamily surreal without becoming absurd and comical--although done with humour, this is a serious film with strong characters as well as concepts.  This is also an autumn and winter film, and the use of these two seasons as background contributes to the ambience of peripheral darkness.  ""Belle de Jour"" opens with the jingling bells of a horse and carriage--an effect that recurs throughout the film.  The carriage serves as both a literal and metaphorical ""transport to fantasy"".  In ""Belle de Jour"" we are introduced to Severine's fantasies barely after being introduced to her.  We eventually see that Severine lives through these fantasies, in which she becomes the masochist and seeming victim in an erotic context--Severine ""likes it rough"".  This relieves the tedium of her existence as the doctor's wife.  Her husband, ""the boy next door"" is decent and caring, but lacks the visceral fire of Severine's partners--imagined or otherwise.  In real life, Severine is well-adjusted and yet possibly traumatized--and so she surrenders to a life of fantasy.  In Madame Anas' bordello, Severine as Belle emanates ""high class"" as an escort while her colleagues are mere working girls beneath her station.  The other girls love her clothes, and yet are envious of this mysterious woman of means who has stepped into their lives.

There is an ongoing reference to cats in this film--we hear them yowling in the background for a few moments in several of Severine's fantasy sequences.  The aristocrat who hires Belle to come to his chateau speaks of the ""soleil noir"" of autumn.  The scene he plays out with Belle is a mingling of sex and death, although the details of exactly how his fetish manifests remains vague--the more to spark curiousity in the viewer's imagination.  After this encounter, Belle is disposed of by the butler of this man of wealth and taste--she is kicked out of the chateau as if she were a common street whore.  Two-thirds of the way though ""Belle de Jour"" we are introduced to Marcel, a violent criminal and client of Madame Anas who becomes obsessed with Belle/Severine.  Paradoxically, it is with Marcel that Belle is able to be vulnerable, admitting to him that she is ""lost"".  As opposed to her relationship with Pierre--as Severine--with whom she is loving and affectionate, and yet necessarily secretive.  Ultimately, Severine pays the price for playing with the fire that is Marcel.  There is a key moment of foreshadowing when Pierre observes an empty wheelchair on the street--he has seen his fate.  A highlight of the film is Genevieve Page's portrayal of Madame Anas--she is alternately gentle, tough, sweet, fierce, no-nonsense, playful and decent.  Of all the characters in this film, hers is the most transparent, and the most likable.

721602,5,6303855490,"In case anyone is wondering, there is such a term in French as ""belle-de-nuit"" and it means ""prostitute"" -- more evidence of Bunuel's wicked sense of humor, except that this movie isn't funny at all.  In fact, it's one of the scariest movies you'll ever see.  It's also one of the most profound and instructive ones.  To understand why, some familiarity with philosophical issues is helpful.

The story is simple.  Pierre (Sorel), a successful physician, marries beautiful Severine (Deneuve).  They clearly love each other but there is something evidently wrong in the intimacy department because they sleep in separate beds and she doesn't seem all that interested.  Pierre is a nice guy about it, maybe a little whimpy, and lets it go figuring that she'll eventually come around.

We are shown some flashbacks of Severine as a young girl being molested.  Pierre apparently doesn't know anything about this part of his wife's past, or if he does has no reason to think it might be significant.  Deneuve outwardly looks and acts ""normal.""  How could someone so beautiful be emotionally scarred, right?  Bunuel deliberately has Deneuve act the role with icy coolness and composure to cover up an ugly truth underneath.

It doesn't take long for Severine's past to catch up with her and have serious consequences -- in real life and not just the bad dreams she's been having.  Severine learns from a friend about a Parisian madam running an exclusive house of prostitution.  After some hesitation and false starts, Severine goes there and begins a new ""career,"" though only from 2-5 in the afternoon to make sure she is home in time and Pierre never finds out.

Severine has a good time with her clients.  Sex is now fun for her, despite (because of?) the circumstances.  Her dual existence is not affecting her relationship with her husband at all, quite the contrary.  She begins to show some interest in intimacy, to Pierre's delight.  He can't quite explain why but hey, if you were married to a looker like Severine, would you care?  Me neither.

Of course, it's all too good to be true.  One of her clients is a violent gangster who develops a crush on her.  Severine is powerfully attracted to him.  The guy is so badly smitten that he resolves to kill Pierre so he can have Severine all to himself.  Pierre survives the attack (the gangster is killed) but suffers serious injuries, leading to blindness and paralysis.  He'll be stuck in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

As in my other reviews, I'll stop here and not reveal the ending except to say that it is truly original as well as heart breaking.

Philosophical issues.

1. One of the most unnerving problems in philosophy (epistemology) is something called ""the problem of other minds.""  I thought about working on this problem in grad school but decided it was too loony.  In a nutshell, the problem is this: I know from my own experience that I have thoughts and feelings about various things, but how can I know for certain that anyone else does?  For all I know, I'm the only real human being on earth and everyone else is a very convincing robot or simulacrum or figment of my imagination.  Maybe you think that about me too, but I'm not worried because I have yet to have any absolutely convicing reason to think that you can think at all.  Stated in less crazy terms, no matter how well we know someone, there is always some lingering doubt that we know every important fact about them.  It is a ""blunt fact"" that we can never know anyone else as well as we know ourselves -- another person is literally another world.  We all have secrets we'd rather keep, from anyone.  By the time Pierre finds out Severine's, it's too late.

2. Another important problem has to do with freedom of the will.  Severine was molsted as a child, which evidently has left deep scars in her character and seems to be a key reason why as an adult she embarks on a life of prostitution, even if only ""part time.""  The question is, to what extent are we free to overcome or transcend our past influences and not allow them to guide our lives, making choices freely?  There is a ""tape"" in everyone's head with information put there by someone else as well as information we ourselves ""recorded"" deliberately (or not) or in reaction to circumstances.  Are we always aware of the extent to which that tape is influencing our actions and decisions?  Obviously not.  Even if we are, can we avoid letting that affect our lives?  If not, does that mean we are not living free lives?  Severine evidently is trapped in her past, unaware that her decision to sell her body for money is a form of self-abuse conditioned by being molested as a child.  It seems she will be trapped in this pattern for the rest of her life.

Serious matters indeed, to which Bunuel does not offer superficial answers.  But then, Bunuel is a master film maker who has thought deeply and knows how to tell a story.  He is badly missed.",1237766400,5,4956,4.639080459770115
721603,3,6303855490,"I had very high hopes for this film.  I have recently become enamored with Catherine Deneuve (since watching her stunning performance in `Le Dernier Metro') and have been wanting to familiarize myself with her resume.  When you think of the actress that is Catherine Deneuve one of the first thoughts that comes to you mind is `Belle de Jour', even if you have not seen the film.  Her name has become synonymous with the films title since this is really one of her most recognizable roles.

Aside from the films star, the synopsis intrigued me and laid bare promise for a remarkable character study.

The film tells us of Severine Serizy, a young a beautiful bride who just cannot give herself fully to her husband.  She loves him, but the idea of consummating their marriage is something she cannot grapple.  Surprisingly her husband is okay with this, for as much as he wants to enjoy his wife in every way he loves her enough to wait until she is ready.  I don't know what man would wait a full year but that is beside the point.  The problem is though, that Severine is lusting for something and she is looking for an avenue in which to give herself over to her constant erotic daydreams.  When a family friend (who happens to have eyes for Severine) nonchalantly mentions a house of ill repute, she finds herself approaching Madame Anais for a job.  Through her newfound profession Severine is able to indulge herself without giving into her husbands requests for intimacy.

The issue I have with the film is its lack of time spent on burrowing beneath Severine's motives.  One can easily draw conclusions as to why Severine refuses her husband (maintaining an image of purity) yet falls so easily into the arms of strange men (no emotional connection).  In fact when a client falls for Severine it becomes apparent that she is not interested in his advances outside of the bedroom.  But this is not embellished the way that it could have, and quite frankly should have been.  I was really hoping that this film would transcend the boundaries of controversy and really lay it out there as to the relationship between love, lust and our inner person.  It lays the foundation for an enlightening look at the power of our bodies but it never builds on that foundation the way I would have liked it to.

Severine is a very intriguing character, and Catherine Deneuve is stunning in her role.  She plays to her characters weaknesses flawlessly, approaching her every action with this fragile naivity that adds layers to the motives that are not always made clear by the script.  A wise may once said ""when a script hands you one note, ADD NOTES!""  Deneuve adds those notes.  I was also very impressed with Genevieve Page's performance as the insightful and caring Madame Anais.  She gives a very quiet yet profound and commanding performance.

In the end I cannot say that this was entirely satisfying.  If I wasn't expecting greatness I may be more lenient, but this film had all the potential in the world, and there are times when you can see it reaching for that potential, but in the end it winds up falling short due to underdevelopment.  It appears as if that consistence ambiguity may have been the directors intent, but it is an intent I feel strips the film of its central purpose thus causing it to be less than it could have been.",1235692800,,3342,4.641156462585034
721648,5,6303855490,"Despite an impression of slight roughness in the presentation of this film and perhaps because of an understated quality, Belle De Jour makes an impact that lasts. The premise of the film - a housewife who decides to live out fantasies and add drama and adventure to her daily life by working as a prostitute during the day when her husband is at work - shot like a lightning bolt in people's consciousness when the film came out. Nowadays that idea, with so many articles in magazines, is not so shocking, but the film remains successful and fascinating partly because Deneuve's beauty and cool demeanor mesmerizes in ways that aren't fully explainable. The term Belle De Jour is a play on belle de nuit or femme de nuit. A flower whose beauty manifests during the day has obvious connotations.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Translator-s-Kiss/dp/0595339557/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Translator's Kiss</a>",1229644800,,945,5.615384615384615
721649,5,6303855490,"Belle De Jour is one of the best French films of all time (and indeed one of the best films, period).  Deneuve, captured at the peak of her remarkable physical beauty, gives arguably her finest ""ice queen"" performance as a woman leading a bizarre double life where fantasy and reality begin to blend into one.  The film's frank (and often humorous) portrayal of lust, infidelity, and madness manages to alternately amuse and disturb the viewer.  A classic that is worth owning and revisiting many times.",1228262400,2,503,4.894117647058824
721650,2,6303855490,"There was something about the 1960s that brought out a playfulness in filmmakers which allowed them to not have to condescend to audiences and wrap up every little aspect of the film in a neat little bow. When the films' techniques and narrative strengths worked, as in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup, or Ingmar Bergman's Persona, the result was a great film. When neither worked, the result was a pretentious mess, like Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby or Luis Buuel's Belle De Jour- his 1967 foray into color film, based upon the same titled novel of Joseph Kessler, released in 1928.
  The film has been described as an `erotic masterpiece,' but forty years later one is left with a film that has so little sex in it that it could pass as a PG film if released today, as well as lacking all eros. Mild sex scenes are not, by definition, eros, and it's difficult to believe that anyone watching this film could have been shocked, much less aroused by a single scene in it. Yes, young Catherine Deneuve, as bored bourgeois hausfrau Sverine Serizy, is her typical gorgeous self, but having seen her in several of her later roles, plus her featured role in Roman Polanski's Repulsion, I seriously must question whether she could really act. In Polanski's film, she plays a neurotic, sexually stifled woman who sleepwalks through her descent to murderess, after what was likely a childhood of sexual abuse. Similarly, her character of Sverine was sexually abused (seen through flashbacks, and after which she refuses communion), but unlike the Repulsion heroine/villain, is not repulsed by raw sex, but attracted to the filthy sadomasochistic aspects of it.... Had Bergman made this film it would have been far subtler and better. That Alfred Hitchcock, by contrast, loved this film, says a lot, for his own films were equally dependent upon hamhanded views of sexuality, and most are equally outdated, as well, for that very reason. Apologists for the film claim that it allows viewers to bring their own thoughts and experiences into the film. Well, most films do, so that's not a great argument. Belle De Jour fails for the opposite reason; it lacks a core- emotionally, philosophically, and technically, masquing it all with claims of Surrealism- that label used to cover and alibi for all manner of bad art.
  In short, this film does not even walk the walk, and Buuel is not in a league with such filmmakers as Werner Herzog nor Antonioni, as far as symbolism goes. Belle De Jour may have titillated audiences four decades ago, but today it simply plays out as a wan and silly- as well as poorly wrought, exploration of a dull woman's sexual life, and how that keeps her deluded and miserable. One need not pay to see such, when a trip to the local supermarket can give you dozens of more interesting female subjects to choose from.",1220832000,5,2878,4.84349593495935

You can get it from Amazon UK. For those of you who aren't happy with the Region 1 version.

As for the movie itself, I just have to say I love Bunuel's dialogues. I have Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie as well and it follows along the same lines. Witty dialogue, very amusing how he manages to make the characters stand out but at the same time they're very comical and heavy topics are lightened up somewhat through the way he works around them.

721655,4,6303855490,"Belle de Jour (Luis Bunuel, 1967)

Ah, Luis Bunuel, you never disappoint me. While I'm still looking for the Bunuel movie that I will like better than La Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie, there's no denying it's a fun search. This one features Catherine Deneuve at the height of her seductive powers, the frigid housewife who finds herself drawn to the idea of working afternoons as a prostitute thanks to her incessant fantasies. Things get ugly when one of her clients becomes obsessed and threatens to expose her double life.

While it has been said many times, it bears repeating: despite the fact that the entire cast shines in this movie, they all somehow manage to be eclipsed by Deneuve. Even if it wasn't (and, really, none of us has any way of knowing), Deneuve makes it seem like this was the role she was born to play. Were the film not already brilliant, she'd carry it. And yet it is brilliant, though likely a bit confusing your first time around (this, one would assume, is by design). Not that it's hard to follow, but Belle slips in and out of fantasy in the movie with no warning. Following the twists and turns of her mind could well give you a concussion. But that's part of the fun.

From any other director, I'd probably give this five stars. But, since it's Bunuel, I not only have to stack it up against the rest of the films I've seen this year, but against Bunuel's body of work as well. And really, there are very few films made by anyone capable of standing up with La Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie and not having to look away first. This is not, of course, to say Belle de Jour is not better than 99.9% of the movies you will see this year. So go get it. Now. **** ",1184025600,,1698,4.380952380952381
721656,5,6303855490,"According to a long, interesting interview with the writer, Jean-Claude Carriere,  and the assistant director, Jean Lary, which came with my disc (Studio Canal: Reg 2), all the masochistic footage for this film had been extremely thoroughly researched before its release in 1967. These were all ""real"" fantasies recounted by real women. Those parts of the film which were superficially presented as real, therefore, ie the idea that a doctor's wife would actually spend her afternoons being humiliated in a  maison de joie, were fantastic; and the fantasy sequences were actually ""real"". Disorienting, isn't it?  The first question is if these female fantasies of being dominated by brutal men are being repeated today, 40 years later. Seems unlikely.  The next question is if anything in the story is real. Isn't the whole thing completely surreal? Nothing of what unfolds need have actually happened at all, including the bit about the husband being shot and sitting paralysed in a wheelchair: it's all his wife's dream.  Why is the husband shown staring at an empty wheelchair in the street in one scene? The wife may even have fantasised about being molested as a little girl, and also fantasises about her husband being a helplessly passive baby, who needs to be looked after --- since she hasn't a child of her own. An idle bourgeois wife --- one of Bunuel's typical targets --- has nothing else to occupy her mind during the day.

The film is promoted as being ""erotic"". That sells tickets.  It didn't seem erotic to me in the slightest, in fact it was all a very cold and intellectual puzzle. The whole scenario was highly unemotional and artificial: the elegant home of the couple, their smart clothes, the tidy, domestic brothel, the stereotypical customers, the stereotypical gangsters with their pulp fiction dialogue and behaviour. The photography seemed flat, without depth, and the assistant director comments that darkness and shadows were deliberately avoided.

Since I find puzzles fascinating, it was very interesting and entertaining to watch. Kubrick's clumsy Eyes Wide Shut seems to have been inspired by it, just as his clumsy The Shining was inspired by Last Year at Marienbad. Both these French films are intellectually far superior to anything produced by Hollywood these days.",1169769600,5,2303,5.1226666666666665
721657,1,6303855490,I found this movie to be a fascinating story about the trauma that can be caused to those we love when we allow our fantasies and daydreaming to interfere with our actual lives. I was constantly wondering where I would draw the line if I was the heroine. The experience allowed me to visualize the mayhem that could be caused by to much fantasy/daydreaming.,1168128000,2,357,4.59375
721701,3,6303855490,"Before any of you freak out at the three stars I ve given the film, hear me out.  Its three stars based on how much I enjoyed the film, not on the quality of the artistry in the picture.  Thus three stars because I did enjoy it, but ultimately, I don't see myself ever going back to it nor do I think it might dominate my thoughts or imagination for long either.  Its simply how heavy was I hit by this film, and the honest answer is, enough to enjoy it throughout the viewing, but not much beyond that.

To also address any potential crys about the actual technical qualtiy of the print; its fine.  Similar to older Bond pictures, the quality of sound and screen is not what you d find in a New Star Wars, but more like what you might find in an old one.  In other words, if this is really something that bothers you, it might be wise to watch nothing older than say, maybe, '95, cause you might get distracted.  Get over it.

Now the film is intriguing.  It does show a really interesting view of the ways someone can be effected so subconciously as a child and carry over those pains to their adult life in very odd and truly disturbing desires.  Its about a women who clearly cant figure out what makes her tick when it comes to men, and though she knows its wrong, gets her thrills over prostituting herself.  I feel its very relavent today, and is something more people go through than one might expect; it just doesnt always culminate in becoming a prostitute.

But ultimately this is where I think I just couldn't connect with the film any deeper.  I don't find this moving nor really profound.  Its  a simply story of a women searching for her true self and having to accept her demons to get there.  So to sum it up simply, tis a great film and worthy of all the praise it recieves, but it takes something different to hit me in the gut.",1138147200,3,1847,4.249283667621777

721704,5,6303855490,"I saw Belle de Jour in the late 1960's at an art movie house in Vancouver, B.C. It was very well received and it is hard to remember if Luis Bunuel's film made many waves in the film-viewing community. All that stands out in my memory was that I felt very grown up and intelligent at sixteen for having been fortunate enough to get by the Restricted rating of the time. Needless to say, the Belle de Jour seem somewhat tame by today's sexual standards. However, by today's standards of what is offensive in the portrayal of women, Belle de Jour still has the original power to shock viewers with the content of Severine's (Catherine Deneuve) fantasy life.

Severine desires the degradation and perversions of depraved men to satisfy her own sexual needs. By signing up with the local high-class sex boutique (its seems unfair to consign Madame Anaiis and her girls to the brothel category) as a prostitute, her repressed desires surface and she is on her way to sexual fulfillment. Add to that, her life as the pampered and indulged wife of a financially successful husband, and Severine becomes rather happily integrated with her days and nights in this dubious double-life.

So much for the X-rated porn film theme. Then comes reality. Luis Bunuel has so sucessfully combined the scenes of reality and fantasy, the fantasy being mercifully short, that one needs to rely instead upon the hard-core cinematic clues to what is real. Of course, it is all real, but reality emerges inevitably in several symbolic frames. My favourite is the shot of the criminal client Marcel's feet as he sheds his trendy boots to reveal a big hole in the heel of his sock. That is to say nothing of his metal dental braces serving as replacements for what were once his front teeth. Just kissing this creep would be debasement enough for most women.

If joining a ""maison"" filled with lovable kinky customers were a way to find liberation and sexual fulfillment, who knows how many of us would sign up? That is the question that Luis Bunuel leaves on the table. The reality is what is always was, money and sex don't mix in much the same way that gambling and drinking don't mix. Severine probably would have been bored flat whether she were an elegant Parisian housewife or the mother of five kids and the wife of a farmer.

Belle de Jour is a moral and sensible film while capturing the human frailties and ugly realities of lives gone wrong. Luis Bunuel had his very strong left-wing politics to be sure, but his genius as a film-maker was to film these characters and this story with restraint and objectivity.",1115510400,5,2763,4.644171779141105
721705,5,6303855490,"Is it fantasy or reality....only Luis Bunuel could have said for sure! Belle de Jour is a thoroughly engaging journey that lacks any definite explanation. We do get a sense that it has to do with a relationship that is failing, and the cause of the failure is the lack of initiative on the husband's part. The main character seems to be so frustrated, sexually, as to either (depending on your interpretation) become a prostitute or develop a fantasy of becoming one. There are so many symbolic and surrealist gestures in the film to twist your mind in so many directions - but in the end we somehow feel rewarded. I think this movie appeals to me for the same reason Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' appeals to me - it is like receiving a whiff of desire or obsession - it just sucks you in!",1114646400,2,781,4.468531468531468
721706,5,6303855490,"Luis Buuel's masterpiece.  Catherine Deneuve is great as the phlegmatic wife who turns to prostitution to get her sexual kicks in the afternoons as the sultry, Belle de Jour.  It's revealed through flashbacks that Belle de Jour was once molested as a child; and that her affinity towards ugly, nasty looking men is her way to redress that terrible experience and fill the void in her soul so that she can finally move on, mentally and emotionally, and have a normal relationship with her husband, whom she has not made love to ever since their wedding--which was over a year!  The psychology of the film mirrors what is happening today in the adult film industry.  Victims of sexual abuse turning towards the heartless world of ""hardcore sex"" as a way to seek pleasure without the pain of having to love.  Her husband, who happens to be a doctor, doesn't necessarily neglect Belle de Jour, but treats her like a child.  She looks up to him not as a husband but as a father.  That is why Belle de Jour doesn't get aroused by him.  But she does get aroused by a recurring dream in which her husband discards her to other men as if she were a slave.  A slave trapped in the bourgeoisie world of ""hi"" and ""bye"" and ""see you later, Alice.""  Belle de Jour is the woman you'd find at the checkout line wearing sunglasses on a cloudy day.  Her name is Melinda, and she is not thinking about tomorrow but of the mailman.  Or, maybe, her husband's best friend, Mark.  She desires motel sex.  Her hips have a subdued swing when she walks, she's afraid of enticing the other rabbits in the field, for she knows that if a rabbit approaches her for some action, she will...say...yes.  And sliding off her finger goes the wedding band, which she will hide deep inside her purse so that not even her jewelry would know who she really is...or isn't.  Isn't that right, Melinda?  ""I see you're driving your daughter's brand new sports car.  Where's the mini-van?...Oh, Charles is using it to take the kids out to the movies.  How sweet of him.  Well, then.  If you have nothing to do this afternoon, perhaps we can...""",1111968000,6,2100,4.517241379310345
721707,3,6303855490,"Deneuve's character, Severine, seems to have everything: a loving husband and comfortable life. She also has an active life in fantasy, imagining herself in erotic situations too bizarre to share wit her straight-laced husband. Eventually she finds work at a bordello, and lets some of those domination fantasies come to life. Even better, she gets a chance to explore others' imagination, and finds more oddities than her sheltered background readied her for. Life doesn't turn out as a fantasy should though - saying more would give away the rest.

Deneuve is beautiful, of course. The 1970-ish styles in hair and clothes look a bit quaint now. There are the wide sideburns for men, and almost a Jackie Kennedy look for the women, with straight-waisted dresses. The look is true to its time, though. The bordello, however, is all fantasy. Severine (or Belle de Jour as she is known) gets off to a fitful start. She sudden shies and bolts partway through her first encounter, and is given a lot more chances to get it right than a credible employer would have offered.

It's not often clear which scenes are real and which are products of her imagination, but it may not matter. The tone of the movie is moralistic: ""if you're a bad girl, bad things happen in the end."" For all that, the bad-girl behavior is more a hint than a display. Today's viewers will find it much tamer than the original audiences did.

There's a lot to like here. The good-girl/bad-girl double life is an idea that can work in many ways, and be adapted to many times. Perhaps this movie worked in its time, but current standards of ""how bad is bad"" seem to have left it behind. I hoped for more.

721708,5,6303855490,"""Belle de Jour"" is generally considered to be director Luis Bunuel's masterpiece; a surprisingly revealing and seemingly personal venture into the world of eroticism and its deviances. It's a truly surrealistic exercise in ambiguity, fantasy, and reality. The line that separates them is blurred so much that the famously mysterious ending has had critics arguing for decades over its meaning.

The fantasy sequences are usually signalled by the sound of carriage bells, but by the end of the film the viewer is no longer able to differentiate between what is another one of Severine's fantasies and what is reality. Even Bunuel admitted to not knowing himself. He said that ""by the end, the real and imaginary fuse; for me they form the same thing.""

The gorgeous Catherine Deneuve, resplendent in her icy prime, portrays Severine Sevigny, the middle-class wife of Pierre, a doctor. She is frigid, virginal, yet seemingly happy enough in her bourgeoisie life and its trappings. However, upon hearing about a local clandestine brothel from a friend, she pays a visit to the madame, and becomes a prostitute, going by the name of ""Belle de Jour"", as she can only work in the afternoons. She apparently fully realizes and enjoys her sexuality, despite her guilty conscience, exclaiming that she ""can't help it"". She certainly doesn't need the money. She's bored with her life and her marriage, needing a ""firm hand"" to lead her; a need which the madame, Anais, who is obviously attracted to her, almost immediately recognizes. Her sweet and conventional husband is unaware, treating her much like a child, and the audience cannot help but believe that even if he knew of her true nature, he would not understand or empathize. She keeps her two worlds neatly separate until a patron of hers (whom she herself enjoys) becomes obsessed with her, and all is threatened.

That Alfred Hithcock in particular admired this film comes as no surprise to me; Deneuve would have been the perfect Hitchcock heroine: an icy blonde who becomes ""a whore in the bedroom"", as Hitchock was fond of saying he preferred in his leading ladies. But this remark is not meant to simplfy the story, its telling, or Deneuve's remarkable performance, which is what truly draws the viewer into the film.

""Belle de Jour"" was Bunuel's first foray into the use of color, and he employed it to great effect. From the fall colors displayed in the landscape scenes, to the subtle shades in Deneuve's clothing, the contrasts are set. While the world around her explodes in glorious hues, Deneuve's character is defined by her couture, if staid, wardrobe of tan, black, and white.

""Belle de Jour"" was unreleased for many years due to copyright problems, but finally re-released in 1995 through the efforts of director Martin Scorcese, and released on DVD in 2003. I've watched it twice in the past week and am still at a loss to describe it very well; suffice to say that I am in awe. It's an amazingly erotic film without any explicitness, and one that I expect hasn't lost any of its effect over the years. As the subject matter is handled very tactfully and without any actual sex scenes; a great deal is left to the viewer's imagination - which only serves the heighten the mysteries inherent at every turn in the film. The viewer is however drawn into the sense of feeling to be a voyeur into Severine's secret life; the careful choreography of scenes and camera angles contribute to the uncomfortable sense of intrusion by us, the viewers.

There are many sub-stories and small mysteries in the film; for instance one of the most widely debated upon by critics is the mystery of ""what is in the Asian client's little box?"" that he presents first to one prostitute, who quickly refuses, then to Severine, who tentatively agrees. All the audience know is that it's something with a insect-like noise, and when the client leaves, Severine is sprawled face-down upon the bed, the sheets thrown about, and obviously pleased with whatever took place in the interim.

""Belle de Jour"" was awarded the Golden Lion at the 1967 Venice Film Festival, as well as the award for Best Foreign Film in 1968 from the New York Film Critics Circle.

Interesting side notes: Bunuel himself had a shoe fetish, which helps explain the numerous shots of Deneuve's beautifully clad feet throughout the film, and the fact that every time she goes shopping, she buys shoes. He also appears in the film in a cameo as a cafe patron, and in another scene his hands are shown loading a gun.",1107907200,47,4528,4.841085271317829
721709,5,6303855490,"Surrealism was an art movement particular to the 1930's. Max Ernst and the more famous Spanish painter Salvador Dali are the best examples of visual art lending to Freudian symbolism.  The idea: we have a secret inner world of thought or memories hidden from our conscious world unless we remember and interpret our dreams, our mistakes, and our peculiar protocol of every day life.  These snatches are the dirty little sexual secrets of incestuous desire and are the parts of suppression.  We can't act out those secrets.  Look what happened to Oedipus.  He put out his eyes.

I wouldn't say that Catherine Deneuve is deadpan in her portrayal of a 23-year-old well to do wife of a physician as some reviewers are suggesting.  She does have scenes of stress and anger, but Bunuel preferred under acting for his female protagonist and overacting for his villain-lover, young Marcel of the bad teeth and murderous swagger. Some women may prefer sex with killers as an enhancement? But Deneuve is blond-beautiful in a classy 1966 Parisian way.  Her undergarments are strictly Victoria Secret of today.  Pantyhose must have come in with the mini-skirt by late 1967, but these garments, the perversion of desire, are most revealing and most sensual. You won't run off howling at the moon after one of Belle de jour's liaisons, but an adventurous couple might wink at the varied possibilities of human sexual perversion or enhancement.

This is not French New Wave.  I know many will not agree with me.  This film, because it mixes fantasy with reality, or sexual role-playing with ordinary life, it is akin to the arts of the 1920's and 30's.  There is much connection here to the silent films made in Germany between the wars. This is a very fine film.",1103846400,,1748,4.845117845117845

721751,5,6303855490,"Belle De Jour is not an easy film to explain; it is a rich, complicated and haunting work that defies explanation or sense. In short, the lovely Catherine Deneuve plays Severine, a bored housewife to a very handsome young surgeon who tries to fill the empty void in her life by becoming a prostitute during the day.

Just about everything in the film is open to interpretation, from the disturbing opening sequence to the beautiful conclusion. Bunuel's genius allows hom to stand back and let his audience fill the gaps in their imagination and, if necessary, implicate themselves. In Deneuve, director Bunuel has found a brilliant blank canvas for the audience to express themselves upon; never fully clear on her motivations (though some tantalizing flashbacks offer hints), she alternates between classic French coldness and classic French passion and though is always fully aware of how to manipulate the spell she's cast over you.

This is a great example of a master of cinema in deep collaboration with a master actress--their exploration of the female psyche runs the gamut of every possible emotion while never being crass or lowering themselves to merely reducing and simplifying.

Belle De Jour is a fine work of art, a grand and glorious film that is beautiful and breathtaking even today. The fact that it stands the test of time so well and maintains the power to shock, entertain, and make one think should make it an instant classic. This is a terrific film; erotic without sex and nudity; and powerful because of the exceptional performances. Be prepared to watch and want to have a long discussion afterward.",1092441600,5,1626,4.970588235294118
721752,5,6303855490,"A life in the upper-class requires many things such as leisure, discretion, grace, and money.  Severine Serizy (Catherine Deneuve) has all these qualities in an abundance as she goes about her daily duties such as shopping and playing tennis while maintaining an exterior beauty.  In this luxurious environment the women often find themselves bored, depressed, or discontented with their lives as they often seek other means of exploring life.  A friend of Severine reveals that one of her acquaintances is secretly working as a prostitute for monetary purposes.  This fascinates Severine's innocent curiosity as she is rather oblivious of sex and her own sexuality.  Through a friend of her husband, who also is attracted by Severine's innocent sex appeal, Severine learns the whereabouts of a small private brothel.  The curiosity of Severine forces her to explore the brothel as well as her own sexuality as she begins to deal with her guilt, morality, and her Catholic values.

Belle de Jour is a film that explores the human curiosity when time and place is conveniently infused with what is forbidden.  Severine's curiosity presents itself when her boredom sets in as it does through her daily routine, which lacks significant meaning.  The time and place for Severine's curiosity is presented through her friends as they serve her the forbidden fruit.  Initially Severine circles the issue like a cat around hot milk that is afraid of getting burnt, but when she takes a bite of the forbidden fruit she becomes obsessed with what has been presented to her.  However, it also presents a backside of the issue at hand as she must deal with the moral consequences of what she is doing.

Luis Bunuel directed a brilliant film that is full of allegorical imagery that urges the audience to ponder the dualism of Severine's situation.  The dualism stems from what Severine desires as it produces both guilt and pleasure interjectionally.  Bunuel creates this guilt-pleasure atmosphere with an artistic manner that is saturated in psychological insights of moral predicaments.  This is visualized though Bunuel's brilliant direction as it offers a truly exceptional cinematic experience.",1092355200,,2187,5.208571428571428

721754,4,6303855490,"Luis Bunuel's classic ""Belle de Jour"" must have been enormously, outrageously shocking to audiences when it debuted in the late 1960s. It may well continue to shock today, although for completely different reasons. At the time, I suspect people objected to the idea that a woman would not only fantasize about debasing herself, but also actually act upon these desires. Now, the outrage would involve the concept that a woman would choose to do such a thing at all. Why, feminists would say today, when a woman can chose so many different outlets would she decide to subordinate herself to men? In a world highly charged with feminist influences, the story about a woman who attains sexual arousal only when strange men treat her like garbage would cause the most strident libber to cough and sputter with rage. Whatever the case, Bunuel's film is an interesting one to watch. I still cannot say whether I enjoyed it or not. My girlfriend, no frothing at the mouth feminist, found the film extremely tiresome. She almost fell asleep several times, and urged me to turn it off. Not a ringing endorsement, to be sure, but there are intriguing elements to the film well worth looking for if you try hard enough.
Severine Serizy (Catherine Deneuve) lives a posh existence. Her husband, a wealthy, busy doctor, is willing to buy his wife anything she desires. He even likes spending time with her on occasion, but he treats her like a child. It is obvious Severine finds her spouse boring in ways both sexual and emotional. As an outlet for her boredom, Serizy imagines elaborate fantasies involving whippings, rapes, and being splattered with mud. Why? Because Severine doesn't have the nerve to do something about her growing ennui. Life goes on as it always has until our heroine cannot stand it anymore. She finally goes into town and signs on as help at a local brothel, agreeing to turn up a few afternoons a week for several hours of degradation and debasement. It takes forever for Severine to fully engage her clients because she continually hesitates to follow through on her fantasies. After meeting with her first client, which turns out to be a total disaster, she stays away from the brothel for a few days. The fantasies and boredom of married life drive her back, however, and she soon racks up a list of clients who favor this emotionally frigid yet beautiful woman.
Problems emerge when Severine enchants a violent thug named Marcel. Here's a customer Serizy can appreciate, a brutish lout who will fulfill her violent desires. Unfortunately, Marcel also has his own desires, namely obtaining Severine on a permanent basis. This won't work at all since Serizy never wishes to abandon her easy life with her wealthy husband. The criminal is not to be deterred as he stalks Severine and eventually discovers where she lives. A violent act committed against her husband, an act that leaves the man permanently scarred, leads to a sort of rapprochement at the end of the film between man and wife. At least I think it does. You're never exactly sure what is going on here because the director's use of surrealism blends reality with Severine's outrageous fantasies. The movie's moving along at a nice clip, you're following the plot, and suddenly there is a scene with Severine doing something naughty under a table. Huh? The mix of wild nonsense with conventional scenes isn't as bad as it sounds, though. In fact, it's often funny.
""Belle de Jour"" is the sort of film that necessitates multiple viewings. There is just too much going on here to absorb in a single sitting. I am not sure whether Bunuel was a communist or not, but I suspect the film is an artfully constructed attack on the European bourgeoisie. The director uses Severine as a symbol of upper class decadence, as a symbol of everything that is wrong with the wealthy. Here's a woman who seemingly has it all and yet she cannot find satisfaction in her life. Heck, she's only been married to her husband for a year and already she's looking for new thrills, new acquisitions. On the other hand, Marcel is your typical proletariat, a common man who is secure in his identity and in his desires. He should have spent his time attempting to destroy the bourgeois Severine instead of bedding her. As it is, his attempt to possess her leads to his destruction. Whatever this movie ultimately means-and there are plenty of interpretations out there awaiting your attention-Catherine Deneuve is amazing to watch in the role of Severine. She's a beautiful woman, and it's quite something to watch a woman who looks this good engage in these sorts of activities. The mud scene alone is worth the price of the film.
The DVD is a mixed bag. The picture quality is awful considering how prized this film is to millions of cinema fans. I've seen the arguments about retaining the ""purity"" of Bunuel's best-known film, but the grain, streaks, and general haphazardness of the presentation made me wonder why a Criterion treatment for ""Belle de Jour"" isn't in the works. What would the film really lose if the techies made a once over on the negative? At least the transfer is in widescreen, with a commentary by a Bunuel student and some trailers thrown in for good measure. When it comes right down to it, I would watch ""Belle de Jour"" again. It's a movie interesting enough to merit subsequent viewings if for no other reason than to try and get to the bottom of just what Bunuel was trying to say.",1085184000,4,5463,4.763713080168777

721756,1,6303855490,"At the time Belle de Jour came out censorship was rampant everywhere, even in France. So the movie had to undergo a range of cuts depending on the countries where it was to be shown (usually in adult theaters). For the VHS version it seems the producers cut out all of the scenes that had once been censored and added some cuts of their own to make it acceptable everywhere, even on TV.
Of course in this way the viewer misses much of the sense of the movie. For instance, does anybody who saw the VHS (or the DVD) version know why Severine smiles after her meeting with the china man with his musical box?
Further it's true that the DVD looks like it originated from a much abused VHS copy with nothing apparently done to improve its quality. But to restore the movie close to the director's first intent you'd have to dig out what's left of the original materials (after so many years there might be a lot missing) and do a full re-editing job. Would it be worth it?",1067299200,5,968,4.324175824175824
721757,4,6303855490,"There are some very perceptive reviews of this film already posted, so I will mostly just comment on aspects they don't emphasize. First and foremost is the master's interest in class issues. Although sexual obsession may be the foreground theme here, the shallow, petty, and ultimately self-defeating behavior of the upper middle class is never totally absent as a background theme. Aside from Severine's own vapid behavior, which she pursues heedless of the possible consequences, her husband and his ""friend"" Husson are depicted as an ineffectual man and a malicious one, whose individual actions (or lack thereof) contribute to Severine's predicament.
The screenplay is also quite amusing at times, and I think this further indicates Bunuel's satirical intent. Severine's early fantasies are really classic schoolgirl daydreams (well, OK, this schoolgirl may have read de Sade) and it's hard not to giggle at the sight of elaborately costumed coachmen whipping our heroine while hubby, striking a Bogart-like pose, lights a cigarette (he does this a lot). There are a number of other such moments. Even Deneuve's succession of stunning Yves St. Laurent outfits can be read as a satire of the typical commercial movie's obsession with surface glamor. The very sheen of Bunuel's imagery takes us further inside the worldview of his protagonist.
I, too, hope this film ultimately gets a better transfer to DVD. In the outdoor scenes, the fading and color shift (green to blue) are especially noticeable. Was there no better print to work from? Please, Criterion, consider restoring this. That's the only reason it gets four stars instead of five. Still worth having, of course!",1045872000,6,1678,5.264925373134329

It's been said many times, but Criterion should have been the ones to handle this.  There is a TON of dirt speckled all over the screen throughout the film.  Scratches pop up WAY to often.  The colors frequently change, fading or changing tint, during many scenes.  There is an overall lack of sharpness as well.  Basically, anything that could be wrong with the picture quality, is.
It's watchable, and by all means worth renting.  But I can't recommend buying it.  One can only hope it is cleaned up and given better treatment at some point.  But don't let the poor video quality stop you from viewing, or re-viewing, the movie.
As has been pointed out by many others, there is no interview with Deneuve.  However, at least there is a commentary track.  While far from the best analytical commentary I've heard for an older film, this is still worth a listen.  Julie Jones clearly knows her subject and she provides a very listenable track.

721780,5,6303855490,"""Belle De Jour"" by the great Luis Bunuel is the best example of what true eroticism is in the cinema. It is an exquisite, seductive and stylish, also surreal, fantasy that enraptures us by not only picking at the main character's brain, but at ours as well. This is not a movie about sex, or at least, the physical aspects of it, this is a movie about the idea and fantasy of sex, it delivers the reason why we're attracted to sexuality or sexually stimulating images in the first place. This also makes it a rare psychological movie. Some may say it is also a perfect portrait of the masochist woman, and this indeed may be true (Bunuel was a big fan of the Marquis De Sade) considering Severine (the lovely Catherine Deneuve), we notice, is especially turned on by the violent aspects of what she is doing more than the secretive. This is required viewing for fans of erotica, surrealism and brilliant filmmaking. Notice how Bunuel sets a completely seductive air without a single sex scene, this movie shames trash like ""Caligula"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien."" Here is one of the masters giving a lesson on what is erotic. Much of what we perceive as sexually alluring (weather it may be ""twisted"" or ""normal"") is born in our imaginations and this is one point Bunuel makes, it is Severine's fantasies that really drive the movie. Visually the movie is very stylish with the elegant clothing, settings and of course, Deneuve, one of the beauties of her time. There are the usual Bunuel touches, bizaare scenes of surrealism (as when Severine is caked in mud by her husband before a herd of bulls in a dream sequence) and shots following Severine's feet (Bunuel was a well-known foot fetishist). His brilliance for characters and scenarios is here too, giving complex deliveries with simple-looking set-ups. Bunuel remains one of the giants of filmmaking, having made the notorious and classic 1929 surrealist film with Salvador Dali, ""Un Chien Andalou"" with the famous image of a razor slicing a woman's eyeball. His Mexican films like the highly influential ""Los Olvidados"" and the controversial ""Virdiana"" are also hypnotic gems, but when he returned to European filmmaking in the late 60s his career really took off and ""Belle De Jour"" is one of those first great masterpieces. It is a movie done with style, taste and truth.",1036195200,16,2326,4.788557213930348
721781,5,6303855490,"At the time of its release, I could understand why this film was somewhat of a controversy.  Although I must admit I probably missed some of its deeper under-pinnings.  Its general effect and mood is so poignant that I was actually moved by it.  For those willing to view this film more than once and actually listen to the commentary, I am sure you will find this film enjoyable and may even explain its ubrupt and enigmatic ending.",1030320000,,433,4.5256410256410255
721782,5,6303855490,"First, let's get something straight: Belle de Jour was shot 35 years ago in France.  It's just not ever going to look as clean, sharp, and saturated as a newer movie.  Director Martin Scorsese (who spearheaded its re-release) is a purist; he would not want to artificially ""enhance"" the picture at the risk of distorting Luis Bunuel's original vision.
Second, this DVD is non-anamorphic for very good reason: Belle de Jour was photographed in 1.66:1 widescreen.  16:9 enhancement would actually have CUT OFF some of the picture at the top and bottom.  People who complain about the quality of this DVD simply don't know what they're talking about.
As for the movie itself, Belle de Jour is one of the few films about eroticism that really gets it right - it knows that eroticism is in the mind, not the body.  The always luminous Catherine Deneuve plays Severine - a woman whose life is at once picture-perfect and fundamentally empty.  She is married to a good provider, the handsome but boring Pierre (Jean Sorel), and enjoys all the idle upper-middle class accouterments.
But something is wrong in this greeting-card perfect world.  Severine seems to find erotic satisfaction only in the repressed desire to be humilated and used sexually. She escapes into waking dreams where she enjoys being whipped, soiled with mud, and bound  to trees.  This lurid fantasy life leads her to seek employment as a part-time prostitute - but only during the day, before her husband gets home.
Complications arise when her double life is discovered by her husband's friend Henri Husson (Michel Piccoli), and when she finds herself the subject of a stalker - a dangerously obsessed customer named Marcel (Pierre Clementi), who also happens to be a violence-prone thief.
Though it sounds like fodder for a typical Hollywood ""erotic thriller"", what develops from these elements is a psychological study that, for all its depths, appears to remain moot about just what makes the main character tick.
Central to the film is Deneuve's work. Under Luis Bunuel's precise, disciplined direction, she delivers a performance that is icy, opaque, and ultimately heartbeaking.  Yes, she seems distant, and that is precisely the point:  the much talked-about ending, by its very ambiguity, shocks us with the revelation that we've been fooled all along.  Severine is not unreadable because she is hiding dark motivations.  Rather, she is a dreamy, empty vessel; abused as a child (as we see in subtle flashbacks), and acting out of nothing more than instincts she can neither hope, nor care to understand.  The lights are on and nobody's home.
Her last, blissful smile as she enters one of the waking dream-states that pervade the film masks the hollowness of a human being squeezed dry of all her humanity by a life of denial, guilt, and empty materialism.
It's an emotional sucker punch - a romantic banality that underscores with bitter irony what a sad, empty life Severine has, and the great damage that has been done to her.  The tremendous harm that her own actions have caused by this point is just a tragic ricochet.
All in all, Belle de Jour is a haunting piece of classic cinema.  It may be Bunuel's masterpiece.  It belongs in any serious movie fan's collection.",1026432000,235,3247,4.939338235294118

721784,5,6303855490,"The premise of BELLE DU JOUR is well known.  A young, beautiful, and slightly frigid doctor's wife (Catherine Deneuve) secretly harbors fantasies of being dominated, humiliated, and abused by her husband (Jean Sorel.)  When these fantasies can no longer be denied, she becomes a prostitute under the sponsorship of a possibly lesbian madam (Genevive Page), working during the afternoons while her husband is at his own work.  Her sexuality is awakened by the sometimes brutish clients, who soon discover that ""she likes it rough,"" and she is ultimately caught up a relationship with a truly dangerous client (Pierre Clmenti) whose possessiveness threatens to destroy both her and her husband.
Throughout the film Deneuve slips in and out of memory and fantasy, sometimes recalling herself as a possibly molested child, sometimes imagining herself as the victim in a series of sexual assault fantasies.  Director Bunuel, whose masterpiece this is, so blurs the line between memory, reality, and fantasy that by the film's conclusion one cannot be sure if some, most, or everything about the film has been Deneuve's fantasy.  Although it includes a number of impressive performances (particularly by Genevive Page, her girls, and their clients), BELLE is essentially Deneuve's film from start to finish, and she gives an astonishing performance that cannot be easily described.  Like the film itself, it is a balancing act between fantasy and a plausible reality that may actually be nothing of the kind.  Bunuel presents both her and the film as a whole in an almost clinical manner, and is less interested in gaining our sympathy for the character than in presenting her as an object for intellectual observation.
Ultimately, BELLE DU JOUR seems to be about a lot of things, some of them obvious and some of them extremely subtle.  And yet, given the way in which it undercuts its realities by blurring them with fantasy, it is also entirely possible that the film is not actually ""about"" anything except itself.  Individuals who insist on clear-cut meanings and neatly wrapped conclusions will probably loathe it--but those prepared to accept the film on its own terms will find it a fascinating experience.  Recommended.",1020902400,18,2222,5.181564245810056
721785,5,6303855490,"'Belle De Jour' opens with a woman being dragged out of a landau by her husband and two coachmen, pushed into a forest, tied to a tree, stripped, viciously whipped and then assaulted.  This shocking display of male violence and female submission, implicating characters, director and (desiring male) viewer, will become the film's main theme, but not in the way it first appears.  As the film continues, Severine, a frigid, bourgeois wife, will be splattered with excrement, will lie in a coffin to stimulate a role-playing Duke, will work as a prostitute during the day, where she will meet an abusive lover.  She shares a name with the heroine of Sacher-Masoch's 'Venus In Furs', that classic text of masochism, the pleasure in being abused.  These instances of degradation and humiliation, however, are the perverse means of her liberation.  In her perfect bourgeois world, with her perfect, handsome bourgeois husband, their well-appointed apartment, maid, rich friends, tennis clubs, expensive holidays and glamorous clothes, Severine is infantilised, treated like a child.  She is cossetted, every desire pandered to until she has no (speakable) desire.  She is mostly silent, rejecting that language-trap created for adults.  When she visits her husband at work, she is a nuisance to be gently removed.
To regain or enact her desire, Severine becomes a prostitute.  It is no accident in Bunuel that the worlds of sexuality and of work meet.  In debasing her indolent bourgeois self, she finds her true self again.  This split between middle-class courtesan and prostitute echoes the other splits in the film, that between mind and body, male and female, dream/fantasy and reality, past and present, city and country.  Split, of course, is the wrong word - there are no absolutes in Bunuel, and these opposites meld and reinforce one another - as in a dream, every character, from the maid's child to the madame Anais to the diabolic Husson, is a plausible projection of Severine.  Besides the fantasies of debasement and weird sex Severine indulges, are flashbacks to her childhood (or reimaginings of her past?), with incidents of paedophilia and sacrilege, Severine trying, as now, to resist male authority figures manipulating her 'innocence', sexually and socially.
'Belle De Jour' is seen as the opening gambit of Bunuel's celebrated late period, that series of glossy, big-budget, usually French films with big stars.  But filming a glossy milieu is not the same as being a glossy film, and 'Belle', with the hard functionality of a Bresson, has the same mix of rigorous detachment, tight concentration and intense subversive subjectivity as Bunuel's best work, in this case surface smoothness being constantly broken down.  In that first scene, we watch, without context, violence inflicted on a woman.  Through the subsequent film, Severine will learn not only to look for herself (and see things we can't), but also take the power of shaping the film, blurring its boundaries.  Catherine Deneuve's intensely private, unyielding performance is the film's soul, with only that famous smirk of satisfaction after the businessman with the unseen toy, tantalising us into answers.
Though primarily a Surrealist social comedy, 'Belle De Jour' is also a Gothic film, from that opening Hammer-horror sequence; to its narrative fractured by dreams; to its interest in double identities, broken bodies and the conflict between desire and duty, sex and spirit, sex and death; to its castles and Sadean figures.  But it is also a marvellously funny parody of Godard's 'Breathless' - the gangster sub-plot is announced by a seller barking 'New York Herald Tribune'; concerns a posing young hoodlum agonising over an unattainable woman; hinges on betrayal and a pastiche denouement that out-sillies the original.  Godard would repay the favour later that year with his most Bunuellian film, 'Week End'.",1016150400,14,3904,5.2576489533011275

721787,2,6303855490,"If you're reading this review you're probably already a Bunuel fan.  If not, I would say to you that Belle de Jour is certainly a special film -- Bunuel is one of the greatest directors of all time, and this is one of his best.  But I would specifically like to talk about the DVD before more people are suckered into buying it, as I was.
1) The image quality is pretty damn lousy.  As one reviewer has already pointed out, it's not anamorphically enhanced.  That's not great, but the real problem is that the print looks no better than the videocassete version that Miramax previously released.  I mean I don't expect the image to be pristine, but it's clear Miramax did nothing above and beyond the bare essentials to transfer this film to DVD.  I can only imagine how much better it would have looked had Criterion been able to release it.
2) There is supposed to be a running commentary by Julie Jones, and indeed there is.  I have no problem with her commentary; it's quite good and does a decent job of introducing themes and images that recur in Bunuel's films while still offering insights on Belle de Jour.  The problem is (and it might just be my Toshiba DVD player) this: when I first wanted to hear what Ms. Jones had to say about a scene, I did what I always do when I want to hear the commentary track of a DVD: I hit the audio button, which then usually allows me to navigate through the commentary tracks and different language tracks.  But it didn't work.  Turns out to hear the commentary you have to hit the menu button, and then go to the commentary element of the main menu and turn the commentary on.  Then you can go back to watching the movie with the commentary on.  But if you want to turn the commentary off you've got to go through the whole process again, hit the menu button, etc.  That's just plain ridiculous.  Like I said, it could be just my DVD player but I seriously doubt it.
So I don't know what to say.  Miramax owns the rights to Belle de Jour, so if you want to watch it you've got to watch whatever halfass version they feel like releasing.  This is a great film and should be a DVD to own, but so long as this version floats around I would try to rent rather than buy.  Like I said, if only Criterion could have released this...",1012348800,36,2271,4.293427230046948
721788,4,6303855490,"Great films have many interpretations, but here's mine...
In Luis Bunuel's film, the lead protagonist, played by Catherine Denueve, begins the film caught up in a sadomasochistic fantasy about her husband having two men whip and kiss her.  At first this appears incredibly odd.  However, further into the film her character's psychology becomes more apparent.
In one of the next scenes, her husband asks if she is feeling all right.  Responding, Denueve's character says ""I'm in strange mood,"" as if her emotions are something separate and can be observed from an objective perspective.  From here, the protagonist goes back to the almost manikin facial expressions and upper class poise.  The only time she can apparently be expressive and open is in the whorehouse.  The question then is: what are these fantasies and why is she having them?
Many sex therapists and psychiatrists now understand that most women, at some time in their lives, have a desire for very aggressive sexuality.  This often is manifest in the form of S&M or even rape fantasies.  They also want the ""bad boy"" as their sexual companion during these episodes.  It tends to be even more prevalent in women who have lived very structured lives within ""civilized"" relationships.  Denueve's character simply has more than just a temporary need for this kind of sex, for it appears to be the only kind she truly desires.
Bunuel seems to be using the protagonist as an example of this secret side many women have.  He then uses her behavior and waking-dream sequences to make comments on marriage and the Catholic Church's incompatibility with the true psychological nature of women.  In one particularly symbolic scene he shows her as a young girl refusing the bread wafer given by a priest.  This is likely representative, both physically and conceptually, of her refusal to except sexual communion within the ""holy bonds of matrimony,"" as the religion would put it.  The scene in the coffin is probably just another one of her fantasies, however morbid, and not evidence of sexual abuse as a child.  Remember, someone of royalty is supposedly pleasuring himself to her image.  That's got to turn some women on.  The only thing for sure, though, is that the fantasies become increasingly strange and complex.
By far the most confusing scene in the film is the final sequence after she was just at the hospital checking on the status of her injured husband, who happened to have been shot by her ""bad boy"" boyfriend.  The husband was last in a coma and his fate was not yet known.  In these next moments we see that her husband is in a wheelchair, with sunglasses on.  The wife puts medicine in a glass and mentions how any day now his eyes could get better.  Then someone shows up who tells the husband about her escapades.  This entire scene may in fact be meant as part of her imaginings.  The husband having sunglasses is likely symbolic of his blindness to her desires, his ignorance.  When he suddenly gets up and can see, the bells begin ringing, which perhaps signifies that the whole scene is a fantasy.  The husband can hear the bells, too.  Thus she is fantasizing that as a result of the shooting he will now see her true desires and be a part of her fantasy life.
Now, if only I could explain that shoebox...",1012262400,7,3290,4.778761061946903
721839,5,6303855490,"This film is a masterpice by Bunuel. Each shot is composed of beauty and elegance. With Catherine Deneuve dressed by Yves- Saint Laurent and the vacant and offsetting uses of time and characters, the film is way ahead of its time. Deneuve is the ultimate in young beauty ( her likeness only challenged by Cybil Shepard at the age of Taxi Driver ), and her sexual energy is bubbling on the screen. One can sense the genuiness of her repression of her true sexual desires. It is no doubt that Scorcese sees in this picture what someone brilliant like myself sees: a portrait of absolute excellence. There is not a bit of fluff or fat to spare as the clean and fluid form is revealed in Bunuel's unique cinematic style.  The shots of women's legs...the ocean with ""lovers"" on the beach...the simpleness of gestures. The BFI book written by Wood always claims that She ( Severine ) is always looking outside of the frame for something, answers or whatnot. I think the opposite is happening. She is looking in while perhaps it appears her interest or perception shifts. Slowly, thoughout the film, her reality gets deeper, and there is no escape, and nothing outside exists at all.. this film will paralyze you...and like Pierre..you will need a wheelchair...Don't listen to the scholars about what Belle de Jour means.

721842,5,6303855490,"Okay, for those of you who are close-minded and think stuff like this is ""pretensious,"" you need to stick to your George Lucas computer generated extravaganzas. Now, for the rest of us, we like this film because Bunuel blurs the line between reality and our subconscious, because the acting is good (in that '60s European way), and because it is at once art and entertainment. What we see in this film is the conflict between middle-class marriage and the limitations of fidelity, and perhaps a distinction between physical love and a more profound, abstract spiritual love. The final moments of the film can evoke some profound emotions whether you can make any sense of the film or not--those haunting dream scenes with the horse carriage, the confrontation at the beach, and many other elements all emerge in an intensly moving and satisfying ending. If you really want a pretensious movie, try 'Eyes Wide Shut,' which concentrates on similar themes, and works in similar ways, but does so much less successfully (and, it is pointless to call a Kubrick film ""pretensious,"" anyway.) This is NOT for mainstream film goers, simply because most of them don't watch movies from pre-2000 and complain about subtitles, and complain xenophobically that the French are snobs, while others more informed may legitimately object to a somewhat easy plot or confuse unconventional narrative development for ""slow pacing.""

721845,4,6303855490,"This psychodrama seems a little dated viewed today, and would be an ordinary film except for the fact that it stars the legendary French beauty  Catherine Deneuve and is directed by the incomparable Spaniard Luis Buuel,  although this is not his best work.  The quasi-Freudian exploration of the  character of a woman who can only be sexually aroused and satisfied by  being treated as trash doesn't exactly play in today's world, nor would it  appear on Ms. Magazine's most admired list.
Deneuve demands the screen  and is fascinating to watch, and Buuel's direction, while not flashy or  completely intelligible, is intriguing and focused.  Buuel has done some  great work including two I recall, ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie""  (1972) and ""That Obscure Object of Desire"" (1977).  His early work goes  back to the silent film era.  My favorite Deneuve film is ""Mississippi  Mermaid"" (1969) followed closely by ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" (1964).
Deneuve is your high class, slightly cool beauty, somewhat in the manner  of Grace Kelly.  She looks like butter wouldn't melt in her mouth and so  directors have always tried to sully her up.  Buuel smears her both  literally and figuratively here as a day-tripping prostitute addicted to  debasement.  I don't buy the psychology, but this sort of thing used to  play well.  I recall an Italian movie from the same period in which the  hero couldn't perform with his sweet and beautiful wife, but had to go  slumming to get it on.
