8431877,5,B004JHZ73A,"I watched the Power Isotonics dvd and I have to respectfully disagree with the reviewer who gave it a negative review. This is a high quality dvd. The picture and sound was very clear. The exercises are shown with detailed explanations on how to do them including beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. I am a 64 yr. old male with degenerative joint disease from head to toe and can no longer lift weights. I've had 60 surgeries in my lifetime. I have several joint implants and a pacemaker and I am able to do all of the exercises with no problem whatsoever. You feel great after doing the workout!! I would HIGHLY recommend this dvd to anyone wanting a great full body workout without having to go to a gym.",1355184000,9,714,4.5
