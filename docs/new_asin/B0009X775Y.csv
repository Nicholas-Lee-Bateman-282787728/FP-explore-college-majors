2333354,5,B0009X775Y,"Yes, understand that when I purchased Barbie And The Magic of Pegasus dvd at my job for five dollars that it is actually meant for children.  I just sometimes feel compelled to watch various cartoons in order to stimulate my creativity/imagination and as a healthy, low-cost, and safe outlet. Additionally, I am in the process of writing scripts/stories just for spiritual fun/psychological therapy and ideas for scripting my future goals (an idea given to me from some of my self- help books). Watching both a range of cartoons and movies give me creative inspiration on how to approach my writing. Anyhow, Barbie And The Magic of Pegasus centers around Barbies journey to save her family and village after an evil sorcerer turns both her parents and the rest of the villagers to frozen human statues. Barbie ends up only having a short time to save the village after understandably refusing to be the tyrannical sorcerers wife. Along the way the movie shows three female trolls that provide a clue that these woman had been the sorcerers previous three wives. Additionally, Barbie ends up unexpectedly falling in love and meeting her sister named Brietta who was turned into a magical Pegasus by the sorcerer (which pretty much explains the title). The Barbie and The Magic of Pegasus dvds also include the following information:

Trailer for various Barbie dvds such as Barbie In A Mermaid Tale and Barbie and The Three Musketeers. Extra Scenes, extras titled under Magical Fun such as Grooming Brietta, Outtakes, and the Hope Has Wings music video by Brie Lawson.",1408665600,,1567,4.977099236641221

2333441,5,B0009X775Y,"As much as Barbie is a toy icon she's also decried by some as an unrealistic and misguided symbol of sexism in our society.  All political considerations aside, we own a ton of the Barbie movies because we've found that they unfailingly have very positive messages for girls and really have very little to recommend against.

I won't go into the specifics of plot, which can be found elsewhere, but my daughter is 6 and anything involving princesses and music is where her main interests lie.  She loves this movie and has watched it multiple times.  She loves the music and the humor - it makes her happy, so it makes my wife and me happy.",1374019200,3,640,4.491379310344827

This one's a four for us (despite our two copies). The villain is a little overpowering and scary.  My girls are much more into the ""softer"" villains with great music and lots of girl friendship fun.  They don't care as much for ""bad guys"" challenging the girls in the story.  If your girls are the same way, look at the Mermaid Tale series, Three Musketeers, and Barbie and the Diamond Castle.

She doesn't need the prince to rescue her, she and her sister are clever enough to solve the problem and save the day.  I personally love the message and am thrilled that my little girl loves this movie. The person who complained that Annika was a brat because she disobeyed her parents and told them ""you are ruining my life,"" is really naive to believe that most, if not all, teenagers have not, at some point, rebelled against their parents. Besides her parents were too over-protective, and if she hadn't disobeyed them, the villain would have won and Annika would have spent her miserable existence locked in her room for the entirety of her life.

My one wish, and I know this is not likely to happen, is that they would make Barbie's body more realistic.  I know there has always been controversy over this issue, and I wish Barbie manufacturers would take that complaint seriously",1327017600,4,1033,4.722222222222222

True to form, the baddie has an English accent (which is on a par with Dick van Dyke's) and the rest of the cast have pretty whiny nasal American accents that tend to grate on the nerves after five minutes. Wenlock, the evil wizzard has very questionable motives which are pretty distasteful given this film is aimed at young girls. Barbie, as mentioned in other reviews, doesn't come across as a very likeable character either. Not really the example you'd want an impressionable girl following.

But, THE most annoying thing in this whole film is why on earth can't anyone pronounce the character's name?! She is called Annika, but everyone in the film calls her ""Onnika"". I don't get it. Why can't Americans say ""a"" as in ""cat"" for Annika? It's really, really annoying to listen to - as irritating as hearing people say ""pohsta"" instead of ""pasta"", ""Los Vegas"" instead of ""Las Vegas"" and ""Ont"" instead of ""Aunt"".

It's very interesting, and I love how Barbie is really brave, strong willed and determined.  For example, at one point she wants to save her little polar bear that went down the slide.  She asks Aidan, the main boy character, if he knows where the slide goes to and if he can take her there.  He says 'no', then she says something like 'ok, then I'll go myself'.

2333592,3,B0009X775Y,"First of all, if you're excited about the 3D effects, don't be. They're few and far between, and frankly, they're downright irritating. Put the 3D glasses back in the box, and put on a helmet, because the moral of the story will be pummeled into your head with Aidan's blacksmith hammer over the next hour or so.

Barbie as Princess Annika, voiced by Kelly Sheridan (as she should be!), seems to be an unlikely disciple of the ""YES WE CAN NO MATTER WHAT!""philosophy. She sneaks out of the palace and gives her parents an attitude about being kept there all the time. She says it's not fair, they're ruining her life, et cetera... to be honest this is probably the most realistic Barbie character in any of the movies I've seen. When the quest gets going, she abruptly stops being a spoiled brat and becomes the Tony Robbins of children's video with a relentless touch of the Borg from Star Trek to give it that added annoyance factor. I think I preferred the brat to the unflinching, never ending MESSAGE.

Brietta, Barbie's sister turned into a flying horse, is the complete opposite and just as irritating. She wallows in self pity and even when she's been shown that things are not hopeless, she just mopes and whines. All the Barbie movies seem to be this way-- Polly Perfect must teach Negative Nancy some valuable life lessons. I'm sure it's done to make the movie easier for the kids to understand, but when the characters are so extreme, even the kids get tired of it. It would be nice to see two average characters with different strengths teaching each other for once.

Ken as Aidan is a bit of a darker character than the men in other Barbie movies, and I kind of like him. He gambled away his parents' money and now he's trying to set things right. If you have a problem with Ken playing poker, I think the important thing to remember is that he regrets what he did, and there were no positive consequences to it. It's also nice that they don't beat you over the head with it, but of course they were too busy doing that with the ""CAN DO YAHOO!!!"" stuff. If there had been text flashing on the screen that said ""Here's the MESSAGE! Don't forget the MESSAGE!"" it would have been less subtle.

Wenlock can be downright scary for kids at times, and the polygamy issue could have been avoided without hurting the story at all. I have to wonder if anyone making these movies stops to think about these things first. Even if a kid is familiar with Bible stories where polygamy plays an integral part, it's usually glossed over in children's versions. I don't want to be ambushed with something like this and have to explain it to a young child. These women could have been presented as badly treated servants without affecting the plot or bringing in the multiple marriage issue. Even more disturbing, after they're free, the wives are shown floating off into the sunset with Wenlock, implying that they are staying with an abuser, and that their forced marriages were permanent.

With no songs to temper the mood, and the only bright light at the cloud castle, the look and feel of the movie is very dark. The real comic relief comes at the end of the movie with the ""outtakes"" that play during the credits. Mattel (or whoever they pay to make these things) missed the mark on this one by going to too many extremes in too many areas. It's not a horrible movie, but it's made worse by the fact that it could have been really good had the various elements been handled properly. The producers would benefit from someone hammering ""NO YOU CAN'T!"" into THEIR heads a little and learning a lesson of their own.",1227571200,2,3613,4.535276073619632

There is never anything inappropriate in any of the Barbie movies, they are always wholesome and not too scary, and filled with good values like courage, faith, teamwork, and self confidence.

We made a chore chart and started saving and mom and dad pitched in half, (at least we had some learning involved with the chore chart), finally got up the money to go buy the 3D version, got home turned off lights put on glasses even made popcorn, Mom Dad Daughter, then we realized Bibble pops on and says take glasses OFF after a few mins of intro 3D?  15 mins goes by no 3d then you are told put glasses ON again etc, overall this movie contains about 10-15 mins total of 3D and most of it NOT in parts you would even WANT to see 3D action...

Needless to say having already bought the first release, even knowing this would be the same movie but buying it for the 3D feature, it falls short bigtime due to the LACK of 3D in the movie.

Buy the original it's better, and it IS a good movie!  Just having kids take off the 3D glasses 5+ times per showing (expecting them to hold them I guess?) for 15-20 mins at a time between the 2-3 min 3D segments is just asking for broken paper 3D glasses and leads to an overall DUD of a supposed 3D release.",1146441600,3,1338,4.015037593984962

I feel this offering isn't quite up to the high standards set in Princess and the Pauper, for two reasons.  One, the lack of great music that made Princess/Pauper such a delight.  Two, the absence of Martin Short as the villain's voice.  Short was absolutely splendid as the evil Preminger in Princess/Pauper, with all sorts of nice touches that made the movie fun to watch again and again (as you KNOW you will when your daughter puts it in the top spot on her frequent-play list).

Still, it's a good story with often beautiful images.  And it was nice, for a change, to have Barbie fall for a guy (""a fool called Aden"") who wasn't born a prince.  There must be hope for us commoners out there after all.",1137369600,2,895,4.515527950310559

The 3-d option is cool but a little too big of a concept for my daughter to understand (she's 3), but she loves the movie.

2333696,4,B0009X775Y,"In ""Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus"", Barbie plays Princess Annika (pronounced on-i-ka).  Annika is a spirited girl with a love for ice skating.  She finds so much enjoyment out of it, that she doesn't understand why her parents (the king and queen) forbid her to do it.  In fact, they don't even want her out of their sight.  One night, Annika becomes very upset with her parents and sneaks out to ice skate.  While she skates with a cheerful crowd, an evil wizard approaches her and commands that she marry him.  Annika refuses and the wizard turns her parents, who have come to rescue her, to stone.  But Annika is momentarily saved from the frightening wizard by a winged horse, who seems to care about Annika, though they have never met before.

It is a fun adventure from that point on.  I think it was a neat movie, especially for being a Barbie movie.  I think younger girls will love it, as it contains all of the qualities that little girls love: cute characters, romance (not extreme, mind you) suspense, magic, and a little bit of comedy.  If I were a younger, I know I would be like, ""Mom!  Take me to WAL*MART!  I want the Princess Annika doll!""  Which is not to say that ""I'm too old for it now"".  I thought it was a good movie.  My only comments are that some things are just a bit over the top.  For example, the wizard was supposed to have had 3 past wives, Annika would be his 4th.  I think the multiple wives thing might make some parents a bit uncomfortable.  Also, some of the word exchange between Annika and Aidan (the boy) could be pretty smart-aleck sometimes.  (It's the they-hate-each-other-then-fall-in-love storyline.)  I'm sure most parents wouldn't care, but I just thought I'd bring that up.",1132963200,,1724,4.532467532467533

However, for young children and diehard Barbie lovers lke myself it was still a pretty entertaining installment of the Barbie Movies.  Not as good a The Princess and The Pauper or perhps the three prior to it, but not a bad as Fairytopia.  When I saw Fairytopia back in March it failed to keep my attention, at the time I thought it was because I was going through a major crisis in my life so my mind wasn't on the movie, but now that I have read other reviews on it, I have found that I wasn't alone in that assessment, Fairytopia was obviously more for younger girls then older people like myself.  Unlike Pegasus which had the same great feel of a Barbie movie Fairytopia didn't, and seem to be thrown together, and I wonder if that was so that a DVD set can be done of it along with the Princess and The Pauper and Pegasus, like one was created for the first three, its all about marketing.  On another to the reviewer who said that Bratz has taken over Barbie's market, that is news to me and the legions of fans who still love this doll, personally I think Bratz are ugly and would never want to own one, also I will never create a dress for a Bratz doll yet I have become well known for my creations for Barbie.",1132876800,,1370,4.154716981132076
2333698,4,B0009X775Y,"As far as the acting is concerned, this is a terrific Barbie movie, one of the better ones by far, but the 3-D effects leave much to be desired. I was very disappointed when we donned our glasses, only to have a very blurry visual with terrible discoloration. Moreover, the glasses were far from comfortable, but then again, they were probably made for much smaller faces!

Nevertheless, I loved the storyline -- a beautiful princess who is not only courageous, but never gives up hope in her quest to save her parents and her kingdom from certain destruction. To succeed she must secure three rare objects (not tangible) within 36 hours. Hope"" is the central theme in this movie -- that one should never give up on it, and should always expect succeed with even the ""teeniest"" amount of it no matter what circumstances come their way. It's a very positive message for young (and perhaps not so young) audiences.

2333699,1,B0009X775Y,"I have watched this movie with my 4 year old daughter only once and had a very bad experience. This movie will not be seen or shown again in my house, at least not for a few more years. Perhaps its creators tried to make the movie ""more edgy,"" which is completely ununderstandable, as ""edgy"" is not something little girls want, and presumably they are the main audience for a Barbie movie. Those who are looking for gentle, beautiful princesses and polite knightly princes should not buy this movie. The characters are shallow and sometimes display a bad attitude. Their manners and style of conversation occasionally borders on bratty. The plot is rather forced. The ""bad guy"" is beyond bad and is way too scary. Only occasionally do we get to focus on the lovely colors and beautiful pictures for which we watch Barbie movies. I would highly recommend Barbie of Swan Lake and Barbie as Rapunzel instead.

2333706,2,B0009X775Y,"Basically it's another run of the mill Barbie movie . Not awful but not good. I'm not a little girl. I'm a 3D enthusiast so I look at it from a different perspective. The effects for DVD are average and yes red and blue (anaglyph)3D can be disorientating when the film is in color. There's many things that can be done about that but it's up to the consumer to express a demand in quality 3D DVD.If you want good family 3D purchase the Ultimate Imax Collection. This electronic system works with flickering LCD lenses and produces a splendid out of the set 3D experience. The major set backs are that untill the demand for more is expressed the number of titles is limited and for the time being they only work on the tube sets and not plasma or HDTV. THis I hear is being corrected in the near future. Spy kids Game over is now available like this in a special edition and I can assure you the 3D is awesome and far superior to anaglyph. The other nice thing about getting this system is that if you go to Toy,Sci-fi and other conventions you can usually find foreign copies of Movies like HOUSE OF WAX(original) and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE in this format. Under no circumstances get THE ULTIMATE HORROR COLLECTION IN 3D as these movies really suck and they are not kid friendly. There is one other form of 3D available called Pulfrich. It's featured on some kids videos. Basically  it's paper glasses with one clear lens and one dark lens. The major problem with it is  that it won't come out of the screen and it's kind of a rip because once you have the glasses you can keep them because this style of 3d works on any image moving from left to right. Ok, enough of the boring lecture. Go back to your dolls.

Why is there too much pink & purple? It's so sickening, not every girl likes those colors...

Overall, it was beautiful, but this movie was another ALL-ABOUT-BLONDE-BARBIE again...

I hope their next movie will be about a different race & different hair color...If they did do that, they would sell more, not every girl likes the character BARBIE, not every girl likes to be BLONDE, likes the color PINK....and not every girl is WEAK as BARBIE...

Another DVD that my daughter loves is ""My Fantastic Field Trip To The Planets,""  where the planets come to life for a magical adventure.

There is a bald giant but he's kind of dumb, Barbie outwits him to escape. The bad guy's wives were troll like, but not nearly as nasty looking as the fungus from fairytopia. I hated Swan Lake for the scary stuff, but this one is not as bad. There is  a slower pace or rather more transition time when the scarier parts are coming. No shocking upsets. My kids have time to react- to close their eyes. (no sudden-...star wars- when the sand people guy scares the pee out of you kind of stuff)

DVD's have 4 pairs of 3d glasses. The 3d is the best I've ever seen in my life. In the beginning, you choose the 2D or 3D viewing. The polar bear icon pops up to tell you to put them on, and again to take the off. There are 4-5 scenes that seem to last 3-5 minutes each? (we just got it-so that's a guess) My father was here to see the 3D. He used to go to the old movie theaters in the 50's for 3D's, and he could not believe how awesome this movie was.

Barbie's prince character (Aiden) is sort of a selfish jerk at first, but he lost his family's money in a poker game(flashback) and fled to the forest. He ditches Barbie with her -surpise, you have a sister, but she's a horse, spell broken...now human.- too early, to fight the bad guy by themselves. He comes to their rescue and says he shouldn't have left her. (sister just stands there while he digs her out from under the snow...)

The 3D is where 5 stars comes from. Without 3D, 4 stars. Realistic- if you have to talk to your child about an old family secret, gambling, courage, and more... it could be a very helpful tool.

2333741,4,B0009X775Y,"Well, I finally saw this movie on TV, and it was definitely better than Fairytopia, since that one was a huge disappointment.  It still wasn't as good as Princess and the Pauper, which will probably forever be the best Barbie movie, but it wasn't bad.

Unlike the other Barbie movies, I thought this one felt the most like an action/adventure video game.  Barbie keeps getting into sticky situations, like having to quest for a jewel, getting stuck in a giant's stew, and escaping from a collapsing dungeon.  She uses her intellect and wit to escape from these situations, but even though it sounds like the storyline would be very choppy because of this, it actually seemed surprising fluid.  That's because she goes on these quests to collect the pieces of one wand that she needs to save her family.

I actually could have done without the Pegasus aspect of the movie since it didn't make much sense that her sister was turned into a Pegasus as a teenager before Barbie's character was born, because then her sister would have to be in her 30s now, but I guess most people wouldn't think about that.  The graphics were pretty well-done, and I would look forward to seeing this movie in 3D because I noticed several scenes would look nice in 3D.

Overall, it's a lovely movie with a very strong yet very feminine heroine (similar to the other Barbie movies), but I thought that some of the dialogue was very cheesy, and there were a few plotholes.  It wasn't the best Barbie movie, but certainly not the worst.",1127001600,4,1512,4.632958801498128

I just finish watching this movie an hour ago and as always it was very beautiful and nice to watch. It kinda reminds me of Swan Lake. And unlike the other movies...this one has its own storyline meaning it's not based on other original stories.

2333743,4,B0009X775Y,"How wonderful this movie is out in New Zealand already! This was good on two levels, my 3 year old daughter was entranced by it, and it had a clear story line to follow. It reminded me a bit of Rapunzel and Swan Lake maybe it was the flying horse? But a strong heroine again - it also returned to the use of classical music which I enjoyed listening to in the background.

All Princess Annika wants to do is skate, but her parents don't approve. Even so she sneaks out and does it - only Wenlock, an evil wizard hears about her beauty and comes to find her to take her for his bride. She resists and to force her to marry him Wenlock enchants her family setting them in ice as statues along with all the villagers. Annika is saved by a winged horse (her sister Brietta under enchantment). She has three days to try to find the key to breaking the spell - or the people and her parents will stay as statues forever. Along the way she finds love (in the form of the penitent Aidan who has lost all his family's money) and she finds friends and allies - as well as breaking her sister's enchantment. It has some simple and nice messages in it as well - sisterly love, taking only what you need, empathy etc.

It is nice to see a return to simpler storylines - Fairytopia (the last Barbie movie) had a complicated storyline and seemed to be all about marketing as many dolls as possible. With two main characters and a winged horse (who is 'Barbie's' sister but has been under enchantment), the story was easier for the kids to follow along. the costumes were more reminiscent of classical fairytales as well. I guess I will be getting a bit of grief from my kids about buying them the toys to go with this. I don't know if I will or not - but at least other barbie dolls can be used in the fray - Anneliese and Erika could be dressed up - even rapunzel, or using Marzipan from Nutcracker if you have any of them

The animation on tis was very good I loved the way the hair moved during the ice skating scenes for instance so it seems to be getting better with each movie. There were good bright colours. the 3D is great too and the glasses that come with this are Barbie branded, however, just watch out, the littlies don't like keeping them on their noses and are more interested in experimenting with everything else in the house - 4 pairs don't last long. you can order more but it is an expensive kind of novelty - I think I appreicated it more than they did!
