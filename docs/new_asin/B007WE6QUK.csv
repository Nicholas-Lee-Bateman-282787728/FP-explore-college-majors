8522566,4,B007WE6QUK,"This DVD contains music from a 1973 concert in Paris by Hubbard's quintet that was filmed for French television.  Would the Jazz Icons series even exist if not for the support and acknowledgement of jazz as an art form by the European media over the decades?  Hubbard was enjoying the success of his albums for the CTI label at the time of this concert, and heard here are three of his best known tunes from the period-- a seven-minute version of ""Straight Life,"" and extended 20 minute-or-so takes on ""Intrepid Fox"" and ""First Light.""  The group features the always reliable veteran saxophonist Junior Cook, and three young lions of the day, the enticing (electric) pianist George Cables, the relatively obscure but impressive bassist Kent Brinkley, and the powerful drummer Michael Carvin.  Hubbard is his usual full-throttle self, so many years before embouchure problems would lay him low.  The best of the three selections is unquestionably ""Intrepid Fox,"" with outstanding solos from all participants.  Please note that while the sound quality of this DVD is very good, the black-and-white video is only adequate at best.",1518998400,,1127,5.0978260869565215
8522567,5,B007WE6QUK,"If anyone is familiar with Freddie Hubbard from this era, then this DVD will not disappoint.  People tend to compare musicians (Miles vs. Chet etc...)which is a critical mistake.  I like them all and usually there is a particular period in their careers that I prefer best.  There is no comparison, either you like a style or you don't.  This Freddie Hubbard period is my favorite.  He attacks each composition with a ridiculous ""I know I'm BAD"" attitude.  The strength and power of his chops are at an obvious peak and during this concert.  He knows that he is ""In the Zone"".  This is a straight ahead powerful performance under any standard.  I just wish I could have been around in person.",1492041600,2,692,4.60655737704918

Like, other artists, tunes, time of recording, etc.  Also some comment on the quality of the recording would be nice since live DVDs can vary so much in video quality.",1348963200,,270,4.583333333333333
