8542671,4,B009KUGQRW,"I'm a fan of Troma and heavy metal, have been for years. Mr. Bricks is, to me a mix of them both. I love the style of the film and there some songs in the movie that will stick in your head for weeks. If you like Troma and heavy metal music You'll like Mr. Bricks.",1385510400,3,264,3.732142857142857
8542672,5,B009KUGQRW,"Mr. Bricks: A Heavy Metal Murder Musical, directed by indie newcomer Travis Campbell and produced/distributed by cult hitmakers Troma Entertainment, may be deceiving on a first look. With a DVD cover that screams campy horror-comedy and a title that says just about as much, one might expect just another cheap-and-cheesy exploitation film, light on story and heavy on gore and bare breasts. Having gone into Mr. Bricks with exactly those expectations myself, I'm here to tell you that it's much more than that. That isn't to say it isn't funny--it has a sharp, witty sense of humor. That also isn't to say that it doesn't have its fair share of gore and bare breasts--it certainly does, although frankly less than one might expect. It is to say, however, that Mr. Bricks is a gritty, entertaining, surprisingly-deep revenge story that's guaranteed to take you by surprise.

The story follows Mr. Bricks, a heavily-muscled tattooed madman, who wakes up with missing memories and a missing girlfriend after being shot in the head by a mysterious antagonist, and left for dead in his home. He takes it upon himself to look for Scarlet, his missing girlfriend, and to seek revenge on the man who shot him and, presumably, took her away. It may sound simple, but not everything is as it seems, and one twist after another keeps the story fresh and the pacing tight. I won't say anything more than that about the story, because it's really something worth seeing for yourself. Of course, we wouldn't have a musical without songs, and thankfully the musical numbers in Mr. Bricks are really what sets it apart from the rest of the pack. The primary style of song evokes mid-90s groove metal (eg. Pantera, Pissing Razors, Hatebreed,) although other styles are brought into the mix, including grindcore, gothic rock, melodic hardcore and speed metal. The musical numbers are a real treat, and at times the songs lend themselves to a unique style of visual filmmaking more evocative of music videos than a typical film.

The movie brings with it a gritty atmosphere and a unique visual style, which is heavily-stylized and expressionistic, making use of desaturated colors, a highly mobile and very expressive camera, some very interesting shot composition, and an interesting mix of no-frills practical effects and digital special effects (blood splatters!) put in just the right places. From the opening title sequence through to the very end, it's a film with a compelling aesthetic. The aesthetic, though, wouldn't matter without the riveting story and the great performances from Tim Dax (Mr. Bricks) and Nicola Fiore (Scarlet,) who keep the movie fresh and entertaining with their deft combinations of subtle emotion and over-the-top camp sensibilities, which are a perfect match for the film. Additionally, the film is surprisingly complex and subtle in the way it handles moral issues (murder, revenge, suicide) and questions about the human condition (sexuality, notions of justice,) which add a certain level of depth to the movie beyond what one might expect.

The release is great beyond just the feature. The disc comes with a selection of special features, including: ""Brick By Brick,"" a behind-the scenes documentary; outtakes and deleted scenes; trailers and promos for the main feature and other Troma releases; bloopers and rehearsal footage; and audio commentaries. The menu design is clean and easy to navigate. The quality of the feature isn't perfect--the sound is somewhat thin and the picture isn't the clearest--but this is more a consequence of the low budget the film was made on than anything else, and is definitely not a reflection of the film's quality.

Mr. Bricks: A Heavy Metal Murder Musical is an interesting, unique film which keeps things interesting by defying audience expecations and building a complex mystery with conflict that continues to grow throughout. It may not be a film to be taken seriously, but it's nonetheless surprisingly complex for a low-budget exploitation film that, in less-skilled hands, could have been decidedly less impressive. It's got a great look, a great deal of creative ambition, and a lot of effort put into it, and it clearly shows. It's absolutely worth a look.",1372809600,3,4227,5.095238095238095

I have watched around 40+ Troma movies in my life, and yet this was the worst. I would rather clean my toilet than watch this movie!!!",1369353600,4,276,4.0181818181818185
8542674,5,B009KUGQRW,"I was an associate producer for Mr. Bricks...I watched the project from it's conception to it's completion.  The cast and crew are the best.  The project started out good and ended up being groundbreaking. I have worked with Nicola Fiore on two other projects and with Tim Dax on one other.

I hope to work with them again soon.

Kudos also go to Lloyd Kaufman for having the courage to continue to support Art.

This first release will become a collectors item.",1354060800,,462,4.585365853658536

I agree with Tim Dax: ""Mr. Bricks"" is a unique example of art on the edge, and represents the kind of fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants filmmaking that makes for the kind of cinematic experience I appreciate most. Kudos to the kast and krew... Mr. Bricks Rocks!!!",1351468800,,344,4.8474576271186445
