5529091,3,B00AZEV14U,"I love a good slasher movie just as much as the next horror fan. The sub-genre is so hit-and-miss these days. For every ""Cold Prey"" or ""Laid to Rest,"" we're given 10 more entries that leave you feeling mentally drained by the time the credits roll on them. Anchor Bay Entertainment's [...] is just lucky enough to fall right in the middle of good and bad in the realm of watchable mediocrity.

  Psychology student Abby Jones (Christine Evangelista) makes the mistake of locking eyes with a murderous patient named Harmon (Dominic Purcell) while on a class trip to the local mental institute. Unfortunately, Abby resembles Harmon's girlfriend that he brutally butchered. He escapes from the hospital and heads out in search of Abby, leaving a trail of dead bodies in his wake.

  Director / writer Campion Murphy put together the right ingredients for ""Escapee."" The problem is the formula he concocts is overused. This would be a shocking and suspenseful film had it come out in 1980. The problem is, it's a by-the-book slasher / thriller with nothing to add to the mix. Many of these types of films at least give the viewer a sense of mystery by keeping the killer a secret to the end. Murphy tries to save ""Escapee"" about three-quarters of the way in with a bit of a twist that comes off as desperate and ill-conceived.

  Dominic Purcell (""Prison Break"") is perfect in the role of the towering and bulky killer Harmon. Christine Evangelista (""The Joneses"") plays Abby with a perfect level of innocence and terror. Carly Chaikin (""Suburgatory"") and Melissa Ordway (""90210"") are perfect for Abby's stereotypical roommates. One is bratty and boy crazy while the other has a steady man and a decent life to conveniently lose to the killer. TV veteran Faith Ford (""Murphy Brown,"" ""Hope and Faith"") plays Detective Alison Jensen and also co-produced ""Escapee.""

  The high-definition transfer for ""Escapee"" is good. The picture is clean and obviously shot in HD. However, it's not so clear as to be annoying or give it a sterile feel. A 5.1 surround sound mix gives the dialogue, sound effects, musical score, and environmental noises plenty of room to breathe.

  There are a few special features for ""Escapee"" included in the Blu-ray release. A ""Making of"" featurette gives viewers a look behind the scenes and contains interviews with the cast and crew. A trailer and photo gallery round out the bonus material.

  ""Escapee"" reminds me of a less thrilling version of ""Halloween."" You have an escaped mental patient out to get a certain girl and killing anyone who gets in his way. The problem is, there's no creepy mask and a sense of dj vu haunts you throughout the entire movie. I consider it passable entertainment if it's the only slasher flick you can find that you haven't seen already.",1365379200,4,2793,4.8442105263157895
8559563,5,B00AZEV14U,"This movie, though not as scary or gory as others, is an enjoyable watch with a good pacing.  Its fun to sit back and try to figure out what is going on. The acting is well done as is Dominic's portrayal of the escapee.",1504051200,,219,3.977272727272727

It's not her usual type of movie that she appears in, but if you like horror movies, it is worth watching.",1407283200,,284,4.071428571428571
8559566,4,B00AZEV14U,"Dominic Purcell plays a escaped mental patient terrorizing a young girl who mistakenly made eye contact with him in a class tour of the facility.  Purcell is really good at these unbalanced or slightly unbalanced characters.  Well done, good acting and enough plot twists to keep you interested.  Entertaining.",1401062400,,310,5.285714285714286
8559567,1,B00AZEV14U,"""Escapee"" is a mystery thriller genre film, which immensely suffers from a weak narrative and poor character development. With an escaped bloodthirsty psychopath implausibly pursuing victims the lowbrow quality of the storyline quickly becomes reminiscent of similar feeble filmmaking from the 1980s. As a movie from the 2010s there is no excuse for its glaringly obvious plot, which requires no effort by the viewer to predict. A film such as this should stay in the 1980s as an extinct species.

8559570,4,B00AZEV14U,"If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favour. Stop reading these comments, get up, take a shower, then GO GET THIS MOVIE. Buy it, don't rent. You will not regret it. Escapee has one of the better scripts you'll find in the horror/thriller genre over the last decade. Just as good as his writing ,is Campion Murphy's direction, which is outstanding and reminiscent of a young Hitchock. His brilliance is in keeping the action flowing at a gripping, break neck speed leading up 2 a climax that leaves one shivering long after The End. I've rarely seen a better villain played by Dominic Purcell : He must have been channelling some evil entity; simply frightening. Aww and what can one say about the beautiful Faith Ford, 5 Time Emmy Nominated Actress. I only wish she could have been in every scene!! If Campion Murphy and Faith Ford's next project is as accomplished as ""Escapee"", count me in!!",1368057600,,903,4.65
8559571,2,B00AZEV14U,"This film was originally released in 2011 under the title ""Escape"" and was changed no doubt because of confusion with the C. Thomas Howell film by the same name. This feature opens with the murder of a woman. We see the killer wash his knife and hands. The hands have no blood, then a moment later they do? Plot point or an Ed Wood moment?

Once our criminal is caught and then escapes from a mental hospital 5 years later, the film focuses on three college girls. Abbey (Christine Evangelista) is the main character. She is serious and studious. She looks similar to the ex-girlfriend Harmon (Dominic Purcell) killed. Lynne (Carly Chaikin) is refreshing with personality, a character I wish would have been more utilized. Then there is Renee (Melissa Ordway) our blonde eye candy in bra and panties. In a different way, I wish they had utilized her more.

Yes, our criminal is headed toward Abbey and there is a twist which was rather meaningless. A twist for the sake of having a twist. I enjoyed the banter among the college girls, but the rest of the dialouge was boring. The slasher aspect was off camera. I would recommend watching "" The Slumber Party Massacre"" instead. A fairly boring slasher film.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs (I recall). No sex or nudity. Near sex.",1366848000,4,1274,4.678571428571429
8559572,2,B00AZEV14U,"A psycho escapes from a mental hospital, seeking out the college student he had seen on a tour of the facility earlier in the day.  Dominic Purcell is an imposing presence but he isn't used particularly well here--he has barely any dialogue and his part could easily have been played by anyone from the WWF stable.  While this movie's premise is solid enough Escapee has some of the worst dialogue ever written by sentient human beings.  The scenes between the female detective and her boss are cringe-worthy examples of writing that would earn a failing grade in a Screenwriting 101 class.  They're seriously that bad.  The movie is a lot better when nobody has any lines.  Unfortunately that isn't nearly often enough.",1366588800,5,720,4.860655737704918
