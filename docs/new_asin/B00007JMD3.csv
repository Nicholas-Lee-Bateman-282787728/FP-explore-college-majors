8214116,4,B00007JMD3,"Alex Cox is probably the most underappreciated guy in the business. All four movies are unique, fun, intelligent and -different-.
Repo Man is simply a classic 'indie film' - humour, insight, bizzare plot twists - it's all here. A must see. Straight to Hell is similar to ""Dusk Till Dawn"" - yet somehow better. But the standout is Three Businessmen --- Cox goes Becketesh to wonderful results.
If you like screwball comedies, punk rock, action movies, romantic comedies, sci-fi, and high faluting art things  you'll love this collection!",1045872000,14,536,5.090909090909091
