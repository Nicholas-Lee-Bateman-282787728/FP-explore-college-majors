960717,2,6305075522,"The Chaplin cult continues to amaze me as it is inexplicable to me that anyone could find anything hinting of greatness in any of these very crude comedy shorts. I agree that Chaplin's feature films were generally very goodbut this stuff is unfunny and uninspired. If I see Chaplin zip around that revolving door one more time, I will go mad! In another short, Chaplin gets everyone at an alcohol rehab center drunk - isn't that hilarious? He plays a cop in another and hits everyone in his path - talk about crude slapstick.  I saw some of these played to a contemporary audience in a theatre recently and there wasn't a single laugh. The audience grew impatient and when the film finally ended, people said ""was that it?"" Until the late 20's, any Keaton, Lloyd, or Langdon film was infinitely better than the stuff that Chaplin turned out at the time. Keaton hasn't aged - Chaplin has.",1025827200,5,887,4.613924050632911

7882243,5,6305075522,"I prefer this 1997 Image edition, along with Volumes 2 & 3, over the recent Flicker Alley Blu-ray for many reasons. The film speed is more natural, as opposed to the Blu-ray which slows things down to a jerky kind of movement. The contrast is better, showing black in dark areas as opposed to the light gray on the Blu-ray. Also, Michael Mortilla's music is wonderful and really draws you into the movies and is truly missed on the Blu-ray set.  The interlacing ""combing"" lines that plague the 90th anniversary Image box set are not present on these discs. The film image is strong and clear. I consider these Chaplin Mutual DVDs , along with Image's great DVDs of the Chaplin Essenay Comedies, to be the very best presentations of these classic comedies. Great film transfers, great music and an all around great Chaplin movie experience.",1466467200,,839,4.7465753424657535
7882244,5,6305075522,"The Mutual restorations are beautiful to look at. One has to pinch oneself to be reminded that nearly a century has passed since they were first released. My main objection to this series is the music track. I'm not-at-all crazy about it.

My discovery of Charlie Chaplin can be traced to Christmas Day 1968. At a get-together at the home of a Notre Dame classmate of my father's, a bunch of us kids were getting ice-skating lessons on a small pond that adjoined the house. When it became apparent that I utterly lacked any aptitude for the ice, I wondered inside and spied a small television set on a bookshelf. When I turned it on, by accident or destiny, the channel was set to public television - Channel Thirteen. On the screen a little man was wrecking havoc on a pair of skates - this time of the roller variety. What I was watching was a short from 1916 called ""The Rink"". That was all I needed to see, I've been hooked ever since.

There wasn't much substance to film comedy prior to the moment Charlie Chaplin entered the international consciousness one-hundred years ago. He proved that it could be viewed as great art - something to be taken seriously by audiences and critics alike. By 1917 he (and his Little Tramp) had evolved from the fast-paced, knockabout mayhem of his early Keystone films, to a more subtle and sympathetic character. The tramp by this time was funnier than he had ever been, but there was a passion and soul that had not revealed itself in his earliest films. Each of the twelve films he made for the Mutual Film Corporation in the years 1916-1917 are the cinematic equivalent of precious gems; twelve mini-masterpieces.

7882245,5,6305075522,"The Chaplin Mutuals is a worthy collection of Chaplin films from 1916 and 1917, many of which were made with Edna Purviance, and her first collaboration with Chaplin was in his second Mutual film, A Night Out; unfortunately, they're shown out of order, so first up we get The Immigrant and The Adventurer, the last two films that Chaplin did for Mutual. Sadly, the DVD doesnt come with any extras, documentary material, etc that other Chaplin DVDs include.

The Immigrant shows a fair amount of on-the-boat scenes, with some funny situations, like two people eating from the same bowl of soup that slides back and forth as the boat rocks in the waves. Theres also a great scene of Chaplin leaning over the ledge, seemingly in the act of throwing up  hes actually fishing and hes caught one (reminds of other behind the back scenes that Chaplin does, like the first scene of Tillies Fractured Romance, and the drunk of The Idle Class. Nice. A funny hiccup sequence experiments in soundtrack work. Theres some drama with the mother of the girl hes fallen in love with  first shes robbed, then she dies. The movie ends with a strange dinner scene, and Charlie forcing the girl to marry him!!

The Adventurer has Chaplin as an escaped convict, great scenes at the beach as he evades the cops by sliding through their legs, total cat and mouse stuff. In fact, we first see him coming up out of the sand! Theres a funny swimming rescue, where we get to see a muscular Charlie Chaplin. Later on, a funny gag with Chaplin nearly betrayed by a Wanted poster published in the daily paper  he covers for himself by drawing a beard and long hair onto his picture (the Simpsons ripped off this gag somewhat in The Simpsons Movie). Lots of drinkin and kickin and chasin. Huge lady dancing with shrimpy man. Ice cream falls down Chaplins pants, then down a womans dress  hilarious!! The ending foreshadows the end of Monsieur Verdoux.

The Cure includes plenty of nutty bathhouse posing, and a room of heavily bearded men! Chaplin himself goes in drag as one of the harridans (as seen in A Busy Day). Funny Turkish attack massage going on here. Severe stretching  everyones drunk!!

Easy Street has Chaplin as a Keystone Cop. Theres lots of fighting, and we even see a junkie with a needle! Social commentary aplenty, but also lots of gags. Hooray for Charlie Chaplin!",1384646400,,2353,4.677966101694915

7882247,4,6305075522,"Having viewed these films on this DVD, I give this four stars. The picture quality is the best I have ever seen. Superb, remastered and certainly better than any of the cheapo DVDs that have been available from other companies. Ignore all other releases, if you crave top picture quality, this is the DVD you want. In fact, so good is the quality that you can tell the difference between footage Chaplin shot and stock footage of the NY harbor on the screen.

Now the bad news. In ""The Cure,"" a few frames of one scene is replayed by accident after a dialogue card. But no other errors. The music, however, leaves something to be desired. It's awful. I mean, for comedy film shorts there should have been much more. In ""The Immigrant,"" for example, there is a scene that involves the waiters beating a customer because he was ten cents short. Guess what? The music is slow and somber two minute previous and drags through the entire scene and beyond. It's very out of place. And in a second shot with a man playing a violin, it doesn't even match up. I may not be a perfectionist, but I could have done better. If you have generic music sitting about the house, turn the TV volume down and turn the CD player up. You'll do better.

So if you want superb picture quality, this is as good as it gets!",1262995200,,1298,4.381742738589212
7882248,3,6305075522,"Up until 2006, these were the best copies on DVD. But now David Shepard and Image Entertainment have restored the missing footage and re-mastered the films , addressing the complaints mentioned below.

So buy the ""Mutual Restored 90th Anniversary Edition"" instead of this edition.",1151107200,4,280,5.363636363636363
7882249,5,6305075522,"This is the best single volume of Chaplin you can own -- 4 masterpieces from his most creative period, the Mutual films of 1916-1917. Later films like The Circus and The Gold Rush are to a large extent refinements of the ideas first produced here, and are not significantly more satisfying to watch.

The Cure and The Adventurer are in the style of classical two-real slapstick comedy -- not much of a story, but a small number of  ideas mined for considerable comic potential. The Cure is somewhat a throwback to Chaplin's Essanay period, where the humor tends to derive from his character's inability or unwillingness to abide by social rules. In this case, Charlie (not appearing as the tramp character) is a recovering alcoholic in a sanatarium who arrives with a suitcase full of liquor, fights with the staff and other patients, and flirts with, and eventually wins, the heart of a fellow patient, played by Edna Perviance. The Cure demonstrates Chaplin's creative growth since the Essanay years by having more diversity in the comic situations, from the classic ""rub down"" by the sadistic masseur to various encounters with the staff.

The Adventurer's comic roots are closer to the Keystone years, with two long police chase scenes, including one at the beginning, probably unprecedented in the history of films at the time. The chases, however, are light-years away from the crude, chaotic Keystone versions. Here the humor arises from with the ballet-like grace with which the tramp eludes his pursuers.

By contrast to these films, The Immigrant and Easy Street are so dense in comic possibilities that they could easily have been successful feature-length films -- they compress suspense, drama, pathos and character development into 20 minutes of non-stop eye candy. These films replace non-stop comic situations with a combination of memorable comedy and genuinely moving encounters, such as at the end of The Immigrant, where Charlie persuades a playfully reluctant Edna to seek out a Justice of the Peace, all while being caught in a pouring rain. The best comic moments in The Immigrant involve Eric Campbell as the sadistic waiter. Again there is humor heightened by suspense, as we but not the tramp know he has no money to pay the bill. Chaplin perfectly builds the suspense to its satisfying climax, as the tramp once again uses his wits and quick reaction to avoid disaster.

Easy Street is justly viewed as the best of this series, which makes it the best of Charlie's best. Like The Immigrant, it is perfect in economy and execution, but has arguably the most memorable scene in all of Chaplin's movies, the encounter on the street with Charlie the cop and Eric Campbell the king of the street bullies. Again there is humor blended with suspense, as Charlie shyly enters the scene after we have witnessed the carnage that Eric has caused. The encounter again builds flawlessly and climaxes with Charile using a gas light to subdue his nemesis. The rest of Easy Street, from the opening scene in the ghetto mission, to the hopeful conclusion, combines refined humor with compassion for the poor without being preachy.

The only disappointing aspect of this collection is the background music -- it consists of an amateur score performed on an annoying synthetic piano which often does not match well with the action. Turn the volume down and, if you must, listen to some good jazz of the same period while you enjoy the films -- maybe King Oliver. Or leave it quiet -- Charlie will inspire music in your head.",1119225600,5,3532,4.917785234899329
7882250,5,6305075522,I agree with you Curleycue_82. I couldn't wait to write a review to these people!,1058400000,2,81,4.466666666666667
7882251,4,6305075522,"I too found that the reviewer's comment on these Mutual shorts being ""uninspired"" and ""unfunny"" were extremely ill thought out.  I've seen the Mutual films before, and just recently purchased the DVDs and enjoyed them all over again.  (the quality of the prints are very good!) The Immigrant is a great example of his mastery of the pantomime (the restaurant scene is just plain charming) and in Easy Street, well, I can't find how someone could call it ""crude"".  And what's funny about a Chaplin's getting people drunk in a rehab center?  If you knew anything about history, this was a direct smack at the upper classes since alcoholism was a huge problem with the working class during this time.  Charlie was poking fun at the upper crust: and to the working people that is ALWAYS funny.
There is nothing at all ""uninspired"" about Charlie's work in these four shorts.  Especially since, in 1917, Charlie was creating the template for comedy that comedians would imitate for decades--Nearly one-hundred years on, people are still using many of the techniques debuted here for the first time by Chaplin (along with the National shorts).  It is interesting that the ""basher"" (as I've called this reviewer) mentioned the revolving door sequence in The Cure to be maddening: to a modern audience, that gag can appear recycled-but that is only because countless comedians have copied what Chaplin created for the FIRST TIME here.
Now, I'm a huge fan of Lloyd and **especially** the inimitable Buster Keaton, but the earlier comment that  ""Until the late 20's, any Keaton, Lloyd, or Langdon film was infinitely better than the stuff that Chaplin turned out at the time"" is really, quite frankly, silly.  Keaton didn't even begin to appear in shorts until the very year of these Mutual films and here was Chaplin writing, directing and acting on his own!! Not to mention that, within two years, he would help to form (along with Mary Pickford and Doug Fairbanks) a little something called United Artists which was a huge step forward for filmmakers and is still a force in the Industry.  And by the way, in 1921 Chaplin released his feature length, The Kid, which is widely acclaimed as one of the best films of the silent era and it also proved for the first time that a comedy could be funny as well as touching to the heart. (I don't know anyone who can watch the final scene of the Kid without getting a tug at the heart).  That same year of 1921, Keaton released his first feature film, The Saphead.
Enough said.
I'm not bashing Keaton because he is an unbelievable genius (Sherlock Jr. is one of my favorite films of all time! =o) but I just think that one should give credit where credit is due.  And every single comedian coming after Chaplin **including Keaton, Lloyd and Langdon**--right down to this day--is reminded to tip their derby to Charlie.
He isn't called a genius just for the hell of it, you know.
(Anyway, four stars to this charming collection of Chaplin full-speed ahead on his way to becoming a legend.)",1051488000,15,3022,4.7461832061068705
7882252,5,6305075522,I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer who bashes Charlie for being dated. Humour doesn't date only the context that surrounds it. This DVD contains some supremely witty and charming comedy. Anybody who is looking to buy it must already be a silent film fan so is familiar with the medium. The film quality is superb and I thoroughly recommend it!,1039046400,8,351,4.770491803278689
