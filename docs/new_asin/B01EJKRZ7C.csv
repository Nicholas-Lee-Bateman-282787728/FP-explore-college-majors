7736376,5,B01EJKRZ7C,"Excellent movie based on the novel by the same title. What makes this movie so great is how the issue of sex trafficking is portrayed in an exciting and passionate manner WITHOUT showing horrific scenes that you wish you'd never seen. This is character and story driven, not issue driven, and that's what makes it a perfect movie for junior high age and above. It's a powerful piece to get the conversation going, and I love how at the end, there is information about the anti-tafficking org, Trafficking Hope, and how to get involved.",1466467200,4,535,4.702127659574468

7736401,4,B01EJKRZ7C,"This movie brings MUCH NEEDED attention to the HORRIFIC ATROCITIES of modern day HUMAN TRAFFICKING & HUMAN SLAVERY.

It is SAFE to watch w/an older teen as the VILE acts committed are NOT shown, though you do KNOW they happened a couple of times WITHOUT having to actually see the horrific acts.

************** POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT****************

In the end of the movie, the way things went down is VERY UNbelievable...there is NO WAY things would have gone like that.

Also, one character in particular was NOT believable in how CALM she was.. & that comes from a woman of faith... she was actually kind of ""CHEESY"" in the way they portrayed her. I did NOT find her to be believable & found myself commenting how RIDICULOUS her calmness was.

That said, it is a good movie that OLDER KIDS can see. I personally watched it with my teen. but would NOT allow my tweens & younger to watch it.

But with all of the vile filth on TV, in movies, & in video games most parents could let their 8-10 year old & up watch it if they are parents who do not monitor what their child watches, because I can assure you, the kids would NOT see any sex at all, nor anything any worse than what kids are bombarded with all day long.

It is important for parents to educate themselves & their children on the EVILS of human trafficking & human slavery so their child does NOT get lured away by a sick, vile pig on the internet who claims to be whatever it takes to get that child away from home. Children of all ages, BOYS as well as GIRLS, need to know this does happen. PARENTS need to WAKE UP & educate their children about this so they are NOT yet another horrifying statistic.

I RECOMMEND this for the EDUCATIONAL value in it & for the NEED for KID SAFE movies on this subject matter that do NOT put horrifying images & thoughts into young minds in a world that already bombards them with such things. YET they NEED to be AWARE, INFORMED, & EDUCATED about this.

If I rated this movie based solely upon the acting... I would say 2 stars, which is largely in part due to the one actress who starts off as almost ""naive"" in her faith & increasingly crosses over into CHEESY, as well as the ending being unbelievable & NOT in a ""Wow! That was amazing!"" kind of unbelievable!

I rated it 4 stars because of the MUCH NEEDED attention that is needed on the HORRIFYING subject matter AND due to the fact that it is KID SAFE. For parents, think of it as the old movies we used to watch in school (driver's ed, etc.) that while they were dated, they still provided some VALUABLE insight & info. THIS movie does that.",1500595200,3,2600,4.353305785123967

They did an excellent job of portraying an evil subject without showing nudity, or succumbing to swearing or crass language.  That was a hard job, I think, to film a story about sex slaves without showing sickening shock scenes, that would serve no purpose as a Chist-centered movie company.  A big thank you, to all involved with the film.  Aggie was a real character, providing comic relief that I wasn't sure was intended.  She pulled off the scene where Aggie sneaks into the mansion, which is a testament to her acting abilities.  However, she told some whoppers to get inside, which is the only complaint I have.  She gives thanks to God for getting her inside, so I didn't understand why the writers had her to lie.  That's the only thing I felt uncomfortable with.  It's still a 5 star movie, and one the entire family can watch.  Although if parents allow small children to see it, maybe they should have a discussion afterward.

The books on pimping that Amazon sells is sad , but thank the lord Jesus that they sell this movie to counteract the crap of books on ""How to be a pimp.""  Amazon should  ask for forgiveness for selling such crap.  People think that the girls want to do this.  I doubt that any little girl grows up wanting to be abused, use or be a prostitute.

While this story is based on fiction, there is sadly a lot of truth to it as well. Elle and Skye are sisters raised by an abusive father and a junkie mother.

At first, I thought it was just a movie, but soon realized that it was produced for a reason: to spread  a message so that maybe the more people that get involved, the better chance we might have to stop this senseless treatment of humans (mostly women).

Nobody wanted this movie to be fantastic as much as me!! The plot has a few wholes (and if the producers and author of the book this is based on is trying to get across the point that sex trafficking is rampant here in america THAN WHY DOES THIS MOVIE TAKE PLACE IN GREECE.) There are some really good moments in this film but too many underdeveloped ones to make this movie worth it. They said at the end of the film there will be the second of the trilogy released in 2018, but I could find no information about that on the internet or the authors website. So probably financial backers dropped out because of the poor quality of the first film. I get it not to expect academy award winning movies from christian film companies (and as christian films go there were not AS many cringe worthy moments as usual). I really thought that there were SO MANY ways for this movie to be so much better. On the actual amazon part of this purchase, the prime delivry was on time and the DVD came in prefect condition.

7736421,5,B01EJKRZ7C,"When Macy dies in the arms of her former nanny Aggie (Loretta Devine) she imparts on her half a story which leads her to believe Jack (Kevin Sorbo) her (Macy's) husband is selling their own daughters as sex slaves. Aggie leaps into action armed with optimism, the Holy Spirit, a servers outfit, and Wil (Alan Powell) who was in Iraq and has seen most of the Liam Neeson films.

The intent of the film is to draw attention to the problem of human trafficking through an organization by the same name. For that reason I gave the film five stars. Realistically, the acting was horrendous with a fairy tale plot. Kevin Sorbo plays a nice guy and his evil twin the same way. It has people such as Governor Jindal (without the swagger) address the issue.

7736424,5,B01EJKRZ7C,"This is a movie about sex trafficking and how rampant it is. The frightening fact is this is happening in our own backyards and sometimes the person involved is a trusted family member.

Caged No More tastefully handles without going to far the uncomfortable, scary reality many young people,  boys and girls will experience and how they are groomed and lied to. It also shows the vulnerability and trust as they feel something is wrong but don't know how to fight against it or even consider this may be wrong because of the trusted family member.

We follow the story of two sisters and ""Aggie"" a family friend/grandmother figure who is fighting to get the girls back from their father. She does what she can to get someone to listen and help her because of a promise she made to the girl's mother as she died in her arms. Although Aggie is not fully aware of the ""real"" danger they are in she moves Heaven and Hell to get to ""her"" girls.

7736427,5,B01EJKRZ7C,"The compelling storyline drew me in from the beginning and kept my attention throughout the film. Based on true events, the subject matter of human trafficking is one that needs light and attention brought to public notice. Sorbo does an excellent portrayal of twin brothers who have chosen completely different lifestyles. Kassidy Gifford and Abigail Duhon also bring heartbreaking performances as sisters whose father has sold them into the sex trade industry. Loretta Devine, as Aggie, is their champion who will let nothing stop her from rescuing the girls she helped raise. There really were no weak performances in my opinion.

Caged No More is part of a trilogy that leaves you eagerly anticipating the next in the series, yet it is not unsatisfying as a stand-alone film. It is not a film for younger or overly-sensitive viewers, but is suitable for teens and older, and excellent for church screenings, awareness groups, etc. The subject matter alone is intense, but the movie is not overly graphic or detailed. In other words, it does not sugar-coat, but leaves much to the imagination.

Aggie Prejean (played by Loretta Devine) is on an urgent mission to find her missing two granddaughters, Skye and Elle, who have been taken out of the country by their own father, Jack (played by Kevin Sorbo). The only lead she has is the laptop Jack left behind. The only help she finds is Jack's twin brother, Richard (the girls' uncle) who is a wealthy & well-known man in Louisiana, his wife, Lottie, and their son, Wil, who is former Special Forces. Regardless of the dire circumstance, Aggie puts her trust and hope in the Lord. Aggie, Wil, and his friend, Tyler travel to Greece to search for the girls. Wil and his Greek friend, Aeton go through brothels after brothels. Will it be too late? What happened to the girls? Watch this remarkable, eye-opening DVD to find out! Caged No More (PG-13) successfully portrays the horrendous realities of human trafficking and the peace made possible by faith in Christ and prayer. Did you know that human trafficking is the world's fastest growing global crime? Sex slavery is happening all over the world and this sickening business of sex trade must be stopped. Approximately 27 million people are enslaved world wide. 1.2 million children are trafficked each year. This tear-jerking, heart-wrenching movie is well made and carries such an important message; I highly recommend it! Let's be active in fighting against human-trafficking!

I think it is one of the best movies I have seen in a while  and I watched Star Trek this week. Im saying Wow.

This is from the same producers and has some of the same actors as Gods Not Dead. It stars Kevin Sorbo, Loretta Devine, Alan Powell, and Cassidy Gifford with appearances by Kathie Lee Gifford, Gov. Bobby Jindal and Natalie Grant.

Ok, so I really love Natalie Grant, but thats another blog post.

This could be two posts:

1. For the intense ride I was just on watching this movie, the twists and turns, the mystery and unknown, the triumphs and failures.

2. For the #cagednomore plea for S$x trafficking in your town, state, and country  and for an inside horrific view of trafficking in Greece. I seriously wanted to pull my card out and buy plane tickets and be a part of the solution.

But this intense movie, reminded me that it is in my own town. I know  because I have talked to the girls. Talked to the families. And it is real.

Id say  Watch this movie for the first reason, because it is really well made, great believable acting, in the setting of the US and Greece, and a thriller ride.

Then, watch it for the second reason, from the heart, and see what you can do in your local area.",1469750400,,1423,4.34469696969697

7736433,5,B01EJKRZ7C,"Did you know that slavery is still happening in the world today? Human trafficking is the world's fastest growing global crime and that every 30 seconds a child is sold into slavery. Don't just think it's happening in some other country. It is happening in our nation as well. Every year 1.2 million children are sold from the ages of 12 to 18 into human slavery. Makes you wonder about all those kids that go missing. Are they simply part of the human slave trade? Did you realize that parents are often the biggest criminals selling their own children into the human slave trade market? An estimated 27 million people are enslaved worldwide. Slavery is not over, it is still happening and we need to put a stop to it now!

Caged No More takes viewers into the heart of a fictional movie inspired by real events. Aggie (Loretta Devine) Prejean, a grandmother on a desperate search to find her two granddaughters, Skye and Elle, who have been kidnapped by their sinister father (Kevin Sorbo). As the details behind the girls' disappearance begin to unravel, they have been discovered to have been taken overseas to be sold into the sex trade, under the guise of a modeling contest in Greece. Aggie enlists the help of the girls' uncle, a well-respected philanthropist, and his son Wil (Alan Powell), who is a former Special Forces officer. A global hunt ensues, and the team will stop at nothing to see the girls safely returned home.

This is not a family-friendly movie, but it is one that cannot be ignored. For far too long many groups that are working to put a stop to human trafficking, are merely overlooked by the public and media groups. Our goal should be to see this come to a halt, whether it is public and national exposure or even working with our local community groups to do all we can to see this crime exposed for the pure evil it is. It might be your daughter, friend, niece, sister or family member that is sold into the human sex trade. We need to ensure that every church and community sees this film, but more than that, to do our part to help. You can find out more information about human trafficking and how to help at CagedNoMore dot com. You can even find the nearest group working to end this in your community.

I received Caged No More compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation aside from a copy of this DVD in exchange for my honest and unbiased personal opinion. One thing is certain, we need to spread this message and expose the darkness in this world and see an end to human trafficking once and for all. Every family, church and community needs to see this movie. We need to talk to our daughters and let them know that this is a crime that often goes unreported or falls under kidnapping or missing kids. Who are your kids chatting with online or through social media. It's time we all take a stand and protect our kids. I easily give this DVD a 5 out of 5 stars and encourage everyone to watch it. It is rated PG-13 and runs about 97 minutes.",1469059200,,3051,4.46415770609319
7736434,5,B01EJKRZ7C,"Caged No More is inspired by real events. This DVD is well put together. It shows how somWord e parents when they don't have any other way out of their money troubles will go as far as selling their children.
  The actors and actresses are Loretta Devine, Kevin Sorbo, Alan Powell and Cassidy Gifford.
  Its really sad to see that these poor sweet girls get locked in a room and live a life of pure terror day after day. There isn't any escaping unless they die.
  In Caged No More the story is about two sisters. One who already was sold and one that is close to being sold into the sex trade.
  The DVD shows how people fight for these girls to get them out, but also how some never make it out. A grandmother, the girls Uncle and his son are some that fight this fight. They have to go through a lot and see a lot.
  The movie Caged No More ends good, but it is still sad because you know that this will continue to go on for many others.
  This is an excellent movie, but it isn't for younger children. Some scenes will be upsetting, but things like this have to be brought to our attention.
Highly recommend.

Not a movie for children under 13, but it is a really good movie to alert parents on the dangers their children can be in.  This is an issue that we need to be more aware of and taking an active part in stopping.",1466985600,7,385,4.0394736842105265

This movie was an eye opener for people unfamiliar with the very real issue of human trafficking and brings up a great point that parents need to talk with their children about human trafficking because it can happen to anyone, anywhere.
I HIGHLY recommend this movie.",1466812800,4,465,4.4186046511627906
