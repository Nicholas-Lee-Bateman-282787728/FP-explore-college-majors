8306293,4,B001GNFX48,"Not bad little Spanish-language, Mexican-made south of the border Western.  (No sub-titles.)  A maskless Lone Ranger type come to a region with the usual bad guys running the town.  One of the cruds even tries to forcibly buy the good guys horse at the bad guys price; how much, one peso?  Anyway, in the wilds there is a wild white horse guarding a corpse and won't let anyone near the dead man.  The locals are saying the horse killed the man but there is more here than meets the eye.  I have seen this on a Spanish-language movie channel and the color and quality there was brilliant.  I also once had a VHS copy of this which also was great.  The DVD quality is good but does not compare.  Obviously there is a pristine master out in the world somewhere.  Other than that recommended for fans of the genre.",1414454400,,811,4.382550335570469
