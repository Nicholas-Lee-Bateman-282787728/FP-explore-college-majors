8030707,5,B0002QO3TQ,"MILDRED PIERCE was quite a sensational movie for its time involving themes of infidelity and incest. Joan Crawford won an Oscar for her tormented performance in this film. Crawford rises from being a waitress to becoming a successful businesswoman. As she enters a world of affluence including a glamorous beach house, she finds herself in competition with her daughter for the affections of her scoundrel husband. The lovely Ann Blyth and foppish Zachary Scott play the semi-incestuous duo. Michael Curtiz turns in a solid directorial drama. George James Hopkins designed some memorable sets for the beach house and Crawford's business. Composer Max Steiner turns in another of his wonderful scores. Steiner is the composer who gave us that familiar Warner Brother's sound. It is interesting how Joan Crawford went on to make cult classics like ""JOHNNY GUITAR,"" ""WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?"" and ""BERSERK."" MILDRED PIERCE is one of those great classics we don't see enough of.

NOW, VOYAGER is one of Bette Davis' best films. Her transformation from a awkward young woman to a woman who is inwardly and outwardly beautiful is astonishing. Bette Davis as Boston heiress Charlotte Vale is an abused daughter by a domineering mother set on belittling her with sadistic zeal. At an asylum she is mentored by Dr. Jaquith played by Claude Rains who suggest that she goes on a holiday voyage. She does so and her life takes a new turn. On the cruise she meets a married man named Jerry played by the curiously charismatic Paul Henreid, but he is married and the of the film gets downright interesting. The narrative flow and score by Max Steiner is simply amazing. NOW, VOYAGER is classic filmmaking.",1423699200,,1699,4.982394366197183
8030708,5,B0002QO3TQ,"Without a doubt these DVD,s (great transfers)show two of the greatest actresses we have known portraying characters that are still common place today despite the movies being termed as """"old fashioned"" etc.  I viewed them at the one sitting and thought back to the good old days of double features and afterwards came away impressed and wondering why filmakers nowadays cannot make simple dramas like they used to.  People argue that 1997,s Titanic was a great love story,I beg to differ,it was poor in comparison to the 1940,s love stories which set a trend.  Bette and Joan I salute you both,fantastic actresses",1099180800,3,613,4.990196078431373
