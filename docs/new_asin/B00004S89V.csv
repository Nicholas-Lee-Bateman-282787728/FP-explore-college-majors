8609010,4,B00004S89V,"This review is about the price of the DVD.  I remember this series a long time ago on CBS during Saturday mornings.  I didn't realize they released these episodes on DVD so I got volume 1 and 2 but when I checked out season 3's price, I was suprised!  It was a good show but there's no reason for that DVD to be $95.  I don't think it's fair that this DVD is more expensive than Vol. 1&2.  Plus it makes it hard to check other sites for this volume and it's still pricy.",1443571200,,470,3.9574468085106385
