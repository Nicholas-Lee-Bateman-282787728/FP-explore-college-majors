8098545,3,B000CETW6M,"The video provides a good general overview of the D7000 and it's main features.  As a  first time user of a DSLR camera, I found it very helpful in learning about and navigating through the multiple layers of the camera's menus.  The only thing I didn't like about the DVD is that during viewing of a chapter it would stop suddenly and go to the next section or chapter.  This appeared to be a purely radom occurance.",1357430400,,417,4.376623376623376
8098546,5,B000CETW6M,"I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE NIKON D7000 VIDEO BY QUICKPRO, AND I NEVER PURCHASED SUCH AN EXCELLENT INFORMATIVE VIDEO. I REVIEW IT CONSTANTLY, AND IT MADE LIVE MUCH EASIER LEARNING THE CONTROLS OF MY NEW NIKON D7000 CAMERA. ITS ALSO A GREAT COURSE IN PHOTOGRAPHY BASIC/ADVANCE INSTRUCTION. THE INSTRUCTOR IS WELL INFORMED,AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND. I'M LOOKING FOWARD TO PURCHASING MORE VIDEOS FROM QUICKPRO ON PHOTOGRAPHY. I RECOMMEND QUICKPRO TO THE ADVANCE/NOVICE, WHOS INTERESTED IN PHOTOGRAPHY. THANKYOU!",1349395200,,502,5.618421052631579
8098547,5,B000CETW6M,"i BOUGHT MY D-50 IN THE SUMMER OF 2006 SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS RELEASED THEN BOUGHT THE BLUE HERON DVD. THAT WAS USELESS. THIS INSTRUCTIONAL DVD TAUGHT ME SO MUCH MORE IN A EASY TO FOLLOW AND UNDERSTANDABLE FORMAT OF HIGHLIGHTING THE CONTROLS THEY WERE DESCRIBING IN THE DISCUSSIONS. I REALLY GOT IT, AFTER I LISTENED TO THIS DVD. IT IS REALLY GREAT FOR THE FIRST TIMERS TO DSLR PHOTOGRAPHY. A GREAT BRUSH UP TO EVERYONE THAT THINKS THEY KNOW HOW TO FUNCTION THIS GREAT CAMERA WILL LEARN SOMETHING SUBSTANCIAL FROM THIS WONDERFULLY FORMATTED  DVD.  YES, I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE!",1327622400,4,593,4.747572815533981
8098548,1,B000CETW6M,"I have to agree fully with the first review.  I was really disappointed in this DVD tutorial.  90% of the time the guy just stands there in his white background holding the camera in 1 hand while he talks.  Occasionally they show you images of the camera and point out the buttons that they are talking about, but really, that's about it.  I am very glad that I did not pay more to get the app of this DVD for the iPhone which is around $28, and is the exact same thing as this DVD.  They do not go outside and demo the camera, they show very few examples of the camera in use.  I cannot stress more that it is a total waste of time.  You just dropped a lot of cash to buy the fantastic camera, it would be nice if they put some effort into helping you how to use it.

Even if you are an absolute novice you will feel like you got ripped off after watching this.  If you really want to learn more about your D7000 then I suggest you follow this link.

There is a 4 part video review and demo of this camera, which compares it to the Canon 60D, you will learn WAY more about your camera than you ever will on this crappy DVD, and the best part, it's completely free to watch these videos, and I have several times.  In total those 4 videos give you about 50 good solid minutes of info on your camera.  If I can save you $20 and still point you to a place where you will learn about your camera I am happy to do so.

That sad part is that I had already watched this 4 part series and still bought the DVD.  It was just my gluttony on wanting to learn as much as I can about this camera which I love.  I can't blame myself for wanting to learn, but now I am kicking myself.",1296518400,27,1676,3.9464285714285716
8098549,3,B000CETW6M,"I'd hoped for an in-depth look at what the D7000 can do and examples of what the various settings do.

What I got was a guy standing, holding the camera, and showing the controls.  If you've read the manual, this video doesn't elaborate much on that.  There are a few photos included that show what a control or setting does, but not nearly enough.  Save your money for a filter or memory card or something...",1295913600,32,409,4.413333333333333
