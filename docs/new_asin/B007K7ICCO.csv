5092738,5,B007K7ICCO,Even thought most of these shows are cheesy and made in the 80's my kid loves watching them and if he's happy I'm happy.,1369440000,,120,4.041666666666667
5092739,3,B007K7ICCO,"I bought this for twin two-year-olds that I take care of because they are obsessed with all things vehicular and also with Hard Hat Harry (Anthony Paul).  This video set was advertised as having Hard Hat Harry, but not all the videos have him in it!  So, they only watch the ones that star their idol, and the rest of the videos are not very exciting anyway.",1367193600,,358,4.3283582089552235
5092740,5,B007K7ICCO,"They may be decades old, but these shows are still extremely interesting to 2- and 3-year-olds if not older.  I love that my kids can watch non-fiction as easily as animated, fiction shows.",1367193600,,189,4.7272727272727275
5092741,5,B007K7ICCO,"My two year old loves this series. His current favorite is Garbage & Recycling, but Helicopters and Police Cars are right up there too. Yes, they are a little cheezy. All About Fire Engines reminds me of a Phil Hartman (RIP) sketch, and it cracks me up. But after months of watching them, they've grown on me, and I even find Hard Hat Harry funny. I'm so happy this series is available for my little ones to watch; I have a hard time stomaching most children's programming.

The way the disc is set up leaves a little to be desired--no auto play, no auto repeat, no play all options are available. I don't think it's a big deal though, and it certainly doesn't detract from the viewing experience or my little one's enjoyment of it.",1352592000,5,732,4.4222222222222225

5092755,5,B007K7ICCO,"What a steal!  My 2yr old csn't get enough of those. Granted, they are a bit outdate but they are very educational and purposely made cheese to appeal to little children.",1433289600,,170,4.483870967741935
5092756,4,B007K7ICCO,"If you have a little one who likes motorized vehicles you can't go wrong here.  I just drop one star because some of the sets are a bit missed matched, with ponies right next to Hummers and that sort of thing. But very cheap and a great value.",1431907200,,243,4.0625
5092757,5,B007K7ICCO,I've written a couple reviews already for these all about movies so I'm just gonna say they are fun educational movies my little boy has almost all of them and loves them plus they are a great price.,1424995200,,199,4.2631578947368425

5092762,5,B007K7ICCO,"My 4 year old daughter and 5 year old son LOVE these. This is a DVD with eight 30 minute episodes. They are a little retro... you'll see. Haha! The kids don't mind. They are accurate, entertaining, and educational. I can't wait to buy the others.",1419897600,,246,4.369565217391305

5092765,3,B007K7ICCO,"My son would give the Monster Truck one five stars however. They are dated videos. My son doesn't care however. He loves the police one, the military one, the post office one, the building one, the astronaut one, and the garbage and recycling one. Meaning he likes the ones with Hard Hat Harry or Backpack Jack.",1414108800,,311,4.571428571428571

5092768,4,B007K7ICCO,"My son LOVES the All About series. I've since bought it as a gift for a friend's son that loves trucks, planes, helicopters, etc. and he is also obsessed with these. They are very cheesy and EXTREMELY out of date, but kids really don't care. This one being about all the different types of transportation vehicles is great for boys, I just wish they'd come out with newer versions of this b/c the concept is great. However, I put it on his portable DVD player and at least I don't have to watch it. :) All in all the All About series is really great.",1408665600,,550,4.247619047619048
5092769,5,B007K7ICCO,"This is a great learning tool for any child becoming interested in machinery. It creatively teaches them basics, and illustrates real world jobs and situations in which a child may want to seek out as a goal later in life.",1408579200,,222,4.575
5092770,5,B007K7ICCO,Very informative dvd and my kids really enjoy watching and learning about all these. Especially the police car and fire engine. Really recommend this dvd to anyone who has a kid that is into all these.,1407283200,,201,4.611111111111111

5092782,1,B007K7ICCO,"I bought this because my son love Hard Hat Harry and that is what this was billed as.  However, several of the episodes don't even have him in.  The Fire Engine episode in particular is terrible, bad sound quality and just down right boring.  Who would have thought it was possible to make firefighting boring to kids.",1400112000,,318,4.543859649122807
5092783,5,B007K7ICCO,"My little boy loves Hard Hat Harry. He isn't in all of them, but he is in enough to be worth the purchase.",1399680000,,106,3.652173913043478
5092784,2,B007K7ICCO,After seeing all about garbage trucks I was hoping for more of the same.  A few of these are not related to that series and very dry for a young kid.  Backpack Jack or Hard Hat Harry is in a few but not all the episodes.,1395532800,,220,3.760869565217391
5092785,5,B007K7ICCO,"Ok so let me just say that this little boy loves anything with wheel's , And now he can watch this tape over and over again. The videos explain what everything and everybody dose the Police car,bike ,horse, motorcycle, and so on.",1395273600,,229,4.476190476190476

5092787,1,B007K7ICCO,"They should be ashamed.....they show a cobra helicopter and say it is an apache. If you like your kids to get accurate information, this dvd is not for you. From a kid's perspective, it's entertaining.",1390089600,,201,4.771428571428571

5092789,5,B007K7ICCO,my 2 year old boy loves these movies. the production value is horrible but I cannot get him away from these movies. it's brought great happiness to my son.,1388016000,,155,4.379310344827586
5092790,5,B007K7ICCO,"My 3 1/2 year old son loves these shows. They are a mix of reality and fantasy but he loves identifying vehicles wherever we go. He sings the opening theme song everywhere and we have sought out all the episodes. Even though they are cheezy from the early-mid nighties, it takes you back as a parent seeing all the less advanced everyday items used as props. Many of the episodes are in Netflix but we get these so we have his favorites at hand.",1387670400,3,445,4.309523809523809
5092791,5,B007K7ICCO,He's learned so much about odd things here and there and incorporates this new information into his playtime. He truly loves the All About shows and requests to watch it daily.,1387238400,,176,4.709677419354839
5092802,2,B007K7ICCO,80's film for sure.  Too much talking and not enough machines to keep my toddler interested.  Won't buy the others.,1386806400,,115,4.7
