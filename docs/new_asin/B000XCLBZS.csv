3964161,5,B000XCLBZS,"The best comedic dvd out there! Mr. Slocumb's delivery of CFC (cuss free comedy) let's one know you can still be extremely funny and entertaining without the use of profanity.  A dvd truly for the entire family. A MUST buy! You will find yourself watching it over and over again and sharing it with everyone.  I enjoyed it so much that after making my initial purchase, I purchased three (3) additional copies for gifts.  Trust me, this will become your most favorite comedic dvd!",1314230400,,480,4.690476190476191
3964162,5,B000XCLBZS,"This is a great, clean family comedy show that will have you rolling on the floor most of the time. If you grew up in the African American church and like good Christian jokes, this is the DVD for you. Great to show to Christian groups.",1307923200,3,236,4.1521739130434785
3964163,3,B000XCLBZS,"Given 3 stars, this is two seperate concerts merged into one. The classic Kool & the Gang (b/4 JT), mostly funky, jazzy inspired soul music, the original band is jamming. On the tracks with JT as lead vocalist, there are a few different lead singers sitting in for JT! They sound pretty good, but you can see that there are different stages, band members, and sounds. If you like Kool & the Gang, this dvd is average. The music from the band is Kool & the Gang, but with each song going back & forth between two different concerts, it can be unsettling! Is there a concert with JT performing with the group?",1296432000,2,607,4.380530973451328

3964169,3,B000XCLBZS,"Jonathan a very funny guy and I enjoy his dvd's. This one is good,has some funny moments, however I really liked laugh yourself to life over this one. I still will say that this one is ok to get too. It came well packaged and quick arrival and was a good purchase.",1370995200,,264,4.096153846153846
3964170,3,B000XCLBZS,"After seeing the first J. Slocumb Laugh Yourself To Life VHS.

I thought that I would try his dvd, and was just as nice to watch,

But the difference in his look was quite different, but that was ok.",1364169600,,199,4.076923076923077

3964173,5,B000XCLBZS,"Not quite as good at Laugh Yourself To Life, but much better than most of the stuff out there today. Jonathan is totally professional and yet able to bring the audience in to his world. A warm comedian who is able to take on church folk and keep them laughing (not an  easy job). I love the fact that he gave props to Rev Jeremiah Wright. That takes heart in the mamby pamby society. I am and will be a fan. Go Jonathan.",1317254400,2,420,4.0602409638554215
8376810,4,B000XCLBZS,Hilarious for the most part.  I did not care for the profanity used in quoting Rev. Jeremiah Wright during the first part of the comedy act.  Christian comedy should be void of profanity.,1478390400,,187,4.636363636363637

8376814,1,B000XCLBZS,"The Disc Won't Play!!!!  It's Defective.  I've tried all of my Blue Ray/DVD players and my computer and it won't play on any of them.  You need to replace it with one that works.  I haven't had time to contact you to complain, but I will soon.  Very disappointing.  I was looking forward to watching the concert this weekend, but I got nothing instead.",1453593600,,352,4.421875

8376819,1,B000XCLBZS,"Horrible quality - mostly the same concert as that released on Kool and the Gang Live from the House of Blues.
Shot on film - nowhere near the level of video or audio quality as the HOB DVD. Don't waste your money.",1420070400,,214,4.119047619047619
