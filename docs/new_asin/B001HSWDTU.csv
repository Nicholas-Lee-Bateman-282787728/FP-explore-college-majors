8605815,5,B001HSWDTU,"This is excellent, A+! I would recommend it for junior high to adult. (I teach eighth graders on Sunday mornings at a Catholic parish. They are mostly from area private schools or local, highly rated public schools. Our curriculum for that grade level is basically Church history.)
Of the five narrators/interviewees in this DVD, two were even priests (in clerical garb and humorous). One was a lay professor from Notre Dame University.
As my classes are roughly 50 minutes long, I used it for two-25 minute presentations. And it held their attention. (Several said it was the most interesting thing they saw all year...sigh.)
And although I've been a Catholic all my life, there was much in this presentation that was relevatory to me.
The presentation style of this DVD is more engaging, unlike some video-transferred-to-DVD types I've viewed (that even put me to sleep).
This would be a fine addition to any parish library. And, no, I am not affiliated with A&E in any way.",1359936000,,976,4.885542168674699
