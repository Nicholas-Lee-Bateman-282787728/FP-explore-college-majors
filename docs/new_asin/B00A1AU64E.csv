5374860,5,B00A1AU64E,down to the sea in ships was made in 1949 and it still looks great this movie has an all star cast with a very young dean stockwell in it it is a very good movie to watch over and over you will enjoy it. i really enjoy those old black and white movies.,1365206400,,252,3.685185185185185
5374861,5,B00A1AU64E,"DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS is one of the very best movies ever to come out of Hollywood, and a DVD release is decades overdue. The five-star rating is for the movie itself; the DVD, however, only deserves four-and-a-half. The picture quality is gorgeous, as is the monaural audio; if only the disc had the supplements that this classic deserves, it would be a five-star disc. How I long for at least a commentary track by a knowledgeable historian (Memo to Fox Home Video: I'm available!). But let's not quibble -- the glass is still more than half full. DOWN TO THE SEA deserves to be one of the best-loved movies of all time, and now that we finally have this disc there's hope it'll find its audience among those who love heroic tales of the sea.",1364256000,8,747,4.420289855072464
5374862,5,B00A1AU64E,"Like many I experienced this film probably 30 or 40 years ago. I never forgot it. Simply stated Bering Joy the Captain of a Whaling ship wants to take grandson Jed out to follow in ""Gramps"" footsteps. Unbeknown to Bering though the Company that employes him ,due to poor health and age has all but written him off for future voyages. Despite whaling records even in the recent past, they are nervous, they need insurance and they get it. Enter Ricard Widmark as Dan Lunceford. The soon to be First Mate ( and Captain in waiting)has a Master's Licence, sea experience ( despite being quite young) & a wealth of Book-Learning degrees & school taught smarts that makes old Bering very nervous. Still the crafty, crusty old sea dog finds a way to turn everything to his advantage. Further to that unfolds an adventure that you will never forget. I give this movie 5 stars. It's one thing to present a picture that keeps your attention entertains & excites you. This presentation certainly does that. When you get a story that gives you keen insight into the human condition & spirit, you have very much more. Much in the way young Jed matures over the voyage, we do as well. The harsh Code of the Sea proves not to be the cruel master we first see it to be but a necessary foundation that perpetuates their existence. Every sentence, every word has meaning in this movie. No dialogue is forced, excessive or over the top at any time. When words don't suffice, then facial expressions reveal the true heartfelt feelings. I hope the picture hasn't been painted here as a taught psychological drama bereft of action. thats not the case, there's plenty happening on the old whaler ( The Pride of Bedford), it's just that there's so much there to discover. Lionel Barrymore as Bering & Dean Stockwell as Jed are excellent but as good as they are Richard Widmark's performance is off the chart. He previously has been cast as one dimensional psychos & heavies and we are so lucky he broke this typecast to deliver this kind of performance. This is one movie the whole family can watch and enjoy ( remember those kind of films?)and they will. You will spot a couple of actors here as well that went on become big tv stars but for now I will leave it there. If you haven't seen the movie buy the DVD if only to convince your friend how erudite you are. You don't see movies like this anymore, my highest recommendation!",1364169600,4,2407,4.548387096774194

The owners want him to retire but is willing to let him have one more voyage provided he takes along as first mate someone with a masters ticket (Richard Widmark). Lot of interaction between the 3 and some scenes of whaling. Overall a good story similar to ""Captains Courageous"". Worth watching.",1363564800,7,490,4.987804878048781

 Full of historically accurate whaling practices and wrought with the human struggle of right versus wrong, a must see !

5374867,5,B00A1AU64E,"This movie has been a long time in coming! I remember DTTSIS as a young man and it always was a movie I wanted to see 50 years later but it was never available until now. 20th Century Fox finally released it and I am really impressed with the quality of the picture as well as the sound of it. It rings true with the sense of whaling in the latter part of the 19th century. Widmark, Stockwell and of course Barrymore could not have been a better choice to see this movie in its full granduer!  There are few whaling movies I am familiar with with the exception of Moby Dick with Gregory Peck as Ahab, but Barrymore brings a more intense, sincere and emotional style to this movie. Widmark was truly the ""star"" of this motion picture but I do not slighten Stockwell's performance with Widmark.  McIntire, Flippen, Calloway and of course, Harry Morgan(M*A*S*H) rounds out the movie! Not being part of the sea(raised on a cattle ranch in Arizona), I always enjoyed movies about the sea and of course related movies. There are many but I can't recall them! I do hope that the studios will loosen their ties on the movie vaults and many more fine movies will be available in the near future. My 1200+ DVD's in my collection are mostly ""classics"" from the 40's through the 70's and of course Amazon made that possible. As I said, this is a VERY good movie and glad it was finally released. You, who do not know the sea as well as myself will find it a five star addition to any movie collectors library.",1355529600,34,1497,4.381294964028777
5374868,4,B00A1AU64E,"This film centers on the grandfather/grandson relationship on a whaling vessel. It is quite a terrific movie and the cast is excellent.

5374883,5,B00A1AU64E,This movie is a genuine classic deserving inclusion in every movie fan's collection.  It was made near the end of Lionel Barrymore's career and near the beginning of Richard Widmark's.

However, in m y old age I have perceived several things that somehow spoil my pleasure.  First, the ideal of ""manliness"" and ""character"" that is the cornerstone premise of this and many other narratives dealing with ""boys' literature"" (Captains Courageous, Treasure Island, Kim, Elephant Boy etc..) And second, sadly, the killing of whales.  Nevertheless, it contains classic performances by McDowell, Widmark and a towering Barrymore.",1425340800,,587,5.020618556701031

I firrst saw it in the 1950s as a teenager and simply judged it an adventure film with sentimental touches between grandfather-captain Barrymore and grandson cabin boy Stockwell. Was recently recommended as a record of life at sea by an elderly and much experienced local seadog - we live by the sea in nw tasmania - so I decided to view it again.

5374901,5,B00A1AU64E,"There are books considered classics, but from the Cinema Archives of 20th Century Fox, here is a movie classic
of a bygone era of the Whaling Ships that left the seaports of New England to sail the Atlantic Ocean.  It is
forgotten, that in the Navy of America and those of Europe, it was not unusual to have midshipmen, cabin boys
or crew members that were only boys starting at the 12 or 13 years of age and older.  The same applied to
commercial vessels. Some of those boys were lost at sea.  In this classic movie, a Grandfather takes his
Grandson to sea as a crewmember on a whaling Ship.  Such boys received their education as well as ship duties
on board for the entire cruise. Richard Widmark is the Ship Master who serves under the Captain who is also
the Grandfather as played by Lionel Barrymore.  Young Dean Stockwell is the Grandson.  The performance of the
men and the boy are exemplary and exceptional in their acting roles. Here is an excellent
family movie as well as adventure and the well portrayed reality not everyone has a happy ending to challenges.
Here is a way of adventurous life of a past era, the viewer can only dream about, but relive in this movie.
The production and visual acuity of the cinematography is so perfected it seems like the sea salt can be smelled,
the winds are felt, to the extent the viewer is standing on board or in a boat ready to throw the harpoon into
the whale.  The viewer will not regret securing a DVD like an historic novel so superb in fact.",1378425600,3,1500,4.413043478260869
