2206427,3,B00079I0BU,"I really wish WWE had done a better tribute to one of the all-time great wrestlers.  As others have stated, this is simply a direct port of an old Coliseum Home Video, with the addition of the bodyslam challenge with new commentary.  A short biography (or A&E's ""Larger Than Life"") would've been nice.  At the VERY least, WWE should have added in some later matches, like the 20 man battle royal from WM2, Andre's only legit title win (with Haku over Demolition), or maybe even the twin-Hebner match with Hogan leading to WM4.  What about some short comments from current superstars and staff (like the McMahons) about Andre?  Is there any footage of his announcement/induction into the Hall of Fame?  If you can learn to tune out Lord Alfred Hayes, then the video is good for what it is.  I just wish WWE had put a little more effort into a DVD about one of their biggest (literally and figuratively) stars ever.",1109289600,13,913,4.598765432098766
2206428,2,B00079I0BU,"Like many who watched the WWF in the pre-Stone Cold era, we knew that wrestlers did not come any bigger than Andre, both figuratively and literally.  That is why I was hoping that this release would be in the same vein as the previous WWE superstar DVD sets.  I assumed that it would have a documentary about his life (preferably the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andre-Larger-Than-Life/dp/B00002EPGB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andre- Larger Than Life</a>&nbsp;A&E documentary that WWE authorized and sold on VHS), followed by supplements that included many of his most famous matches.  Instead, this release is nothing more than a 90 minute DVD transfer of an old VHS video that has wrestling promoter Lord Alfred Hayes talking over several of Andre's matches.  He never has anything more to say than, ""Look how massive Andre is!""  There are absolutely no insights into Andre, his upbringing, or any of the rumors that have long shrouded his mystique.  In my opinion, WWE missed a supreme opportunity to give the older and younger wrestling fans a fresh look at this legendary Hall of Famer that was long overdue.",1108684800,8,1159,5.48314606741573
2206429,5,B00079I0BU,"I had the opportunity to see Andre live for the very first time back in the mid 1970's, long before his career in the WWF.  I met him live at a show prior to his wrestling that evening.  I remember him showing us kids his ring which would easily fit on three of our fingers with room to spare.  Andre was a true legend and really the first true international star in Wrestling who toured the entire would and drew huge crowds.  This tape is a re-release of the old Colisseum videos from back in the 1980's and includes a mixed bag of Andre's matches.

We see Andre in squash matches against people like Moondog Rex, Black Gordman & Great Goliath, and a 3 on 1 match against Johnny Rodz, Jack Evans and Butcher Nova.  That throwaway stuff aside, we also see Andre winning an 18 man battle royal with Andre finishing off Adrian Adonis and Dick Murdoch for the win.

Then Andre Teams with Jimmy Snuka vs. the Wild Samoans.

Then there is the infamous hair-cutting match as Andre teamed with S.D. ""Special Delivery"" Jones against Big John Studd and Ken Patera.  As Jones was beaten up and lying outside the ring, the two villians teamed up on Andre and cut off his long hair.  If you look close...you will see Hillbilly Jim in the audience who would later save Hulk Hogan from a similar fate just a few weeks later.

Andre Vs. ken Patera - This was the revenge match as Andre got even for the Hair cut by destroying Patera.

Finally there is the famous body slam match from Wrestlemania 1 with Andre challenging Big John Studd.  Included are various segments with Andre appearing on the old Tuesday Night Titans talk show.  God that show was freaking hilarious.  It's really fascinating to see how far the WWF has come in 20 years in terms of their production values.  The productions are so much clearer and professionally done.

The only downside to the DVD is putting up with the host Lord Alfred Hayes.  If you think Michael Cole is annoying, just wait until you see Hayes.  Uggh..

I saw many of these matches happen at the time and I'm glad the WWE is putting these old tapes out on DVD.",1108425600,15,2089,4.4188481675392675
2206430,3,B00079I0BU,"I bought this DVD because I have an old VHS tape on Andre & thought this is my chance to get his old classic matches on DVD. I was very happy watching & listening to the classic commentary until the last match having Tazz & Michael Cole doing commentary. What a disaster, they kept insulting one another & not calling the match, mush worse than what they do on TV every week. I was thrilled with this DVD & would of given it 5 stars if they hadn't ruined it with Tazz & Michael.",1106956800,4,478,4.095744680851064

2206433,4,B00079I0BU,"Great DVD focused on Andre who was my favorite wrestler. He was one of a kind. Shows old matches with Big John Studd, Super Fly Snuka and Gorilla Monsoon.

2206435,1,B00079I0BU,"No Justice like the title says.  Please do not waste your time nor money buying this DVD..  Andre is a legend and Vince did not do this legend any justice.  Alot of blk and white videos and the match selection is the worst, so be warned...",1222992000,,239,4.1521739130434785
2206436,1,B00079I0BU,"With all the footage WWE has, you'd think this would be better. Its an old video with bad commentating (kind of like listening to TNA) and the matches are awful. I want to know why Andre was so popular but this doesnt provide any clues.",1133222400,6,236,4.266666666666667
2206437,3,B00079I0BU,"...a bit dated is this DVD (Lord Alfred Hayes is narrating!), judging from who is on it, and the WWF logo.  Funny, too that when Hayes says ""WWF,"" the ""F"" is cut out.  Guess the World Wildlife Fund is dead serious about keeping that name theirs.

Anyway, Hayes, though generally a buffoon throughout his wrestling, managing and commentating career did have a long friendship with Andre, and he provides a number of interesting insights about the man.  The matches we see here pretty much cover 1981 to '85, and there hasn't been a follow-up, as there should be on Andre's amazing career.

Some squash matches such as against Moondog Rex, and the three on one match against Johnny Rodz and two no-names were entertaining, and reminded me of the old Gran Prix matches where Andre would take on more than one opponent.  Pretty much the same outcome.  There is one match from '76 from I think Los Angeles, where Andre stomps Black Gordman and the Great Goliath.  The bad guys hammed it up well.

Another funny one is a boxing match with Gorilla Monsoon in Puerto Rico.  The box is in error;  Monsoon's manager for the event was Hugo Sabinovich, not the Grand Wizard, but he doesn't figure in the decision.

What's missing is:  matches with Killer Khan (when Khan allegedly broke Andre's leg and the rematch in which Khan nearly gets ""killed""), early Gran Prix matches from the 70's when Andre was in his physical prime, and matches from his many tours of Japan.  According to the Canadian Slam! Sports site, Andre had a long series of matches against one of Japan's legends, Shozo Kobayashi.  I'd love to see some of those, and matches against the likes of Antonio Inoki and Seiji Sakaguchi.

In any case, this is a WWF show, with a number of memorable bouts, but it did leave me wanting a bit more.  This is good for wrestling fans gaining some background info, but there must be more out there.",1126483200,8,1892,4.616766467065868
2206438,5,B00079I0BU,"This is a great DVD. It profiles a great wrestler, and shows you how he changed the rules in the WWF to fit his massive size.

The DVD is loaded with great old footage from the earlier days of the WWF, and some classic clips from the 70s. My favorite: Gorilla Monsoon vs Andre The Giant.

It gives you a real feel of how massive the man was, and why he was bigger than life.

Sadly, Andre is gone. I hope they release another volume to this lengendary GIANT on DVD. He is one of the truly awesome icons of wrestling history.",1124323200,,524,4.117647058823529
2206439,5,B00079I0BU,"Andre the Giant was a man that I never saw wrestle until I wathced this dvd. He goe through opponents such as Moondog Rex and has a 18 man battle royal with people like Hulk Hogan and Sgt. Slaughter. he has 2 on 1 handicap matches and 3 on 1 handicap and still comes out on top. he has tag team matches with Jimmy 'Supafly' Snuka and SD (special delivery) Jones.

he has battles against Ken Patera and Big John Studd. There is also the $15,000 body slam challenge between him and Big John Studd. This dvd is awesome and hope you find it awesome too. I also hope you find this review helpful.",1120176000,2,591,4.184210526315789
2206440,5,B00079I0BU,Andre was a huge insipration to a lot of wrestlers coming into the business when he was alive.  Even Hogan said in his book that he wish he was like Andre at some point and he loved the man like a brother{no pun intended}.  When Hogan was looking at the Big Show the first time and brought him into the WCW he immediatly thought of how much Paul Wright resembles Andre.  I really do wish they would have put some of Andre and Hogan matches before Wrestlemania on here I seem to remember a particular match that was mention that Vince's dad set up.  It would have been nice to hear some opinions from Hogan about Andre since the both of them spent so much time together on the road.,1119916800,2,681,4.2153846153846155
2206441,4,B00079I0BU,"As an overview of the GIANT,it is still interesting to see him in those different matches,even if many are not so memorable. However, this is not the definitive dvd on ANDR.Among the famous bouts that are missing are the two fights with DON LO JONATHAN back in 1972 when ANDR was still called JEAN FERR;a legendary one in JAPAN against STAN HANSEN includes one of the rare complete body slam of the man(this was something to see).A complete biography would also have been nice. We only have LORD ALFRED HAYES recalling that he first met the GIANT at age 17. I think that ANDR THE GIANT deserves a little more than this dvd. For now,we'll settle for this one,but please for the fans,search the archives of the wrestling library. Highlights are the royal rumble won by ANDR and the tagteam bout with JIMMY SNUKA against THE WILD SAMOUANS.JIMMY actually execute a spectacular jump over the GIANT's shoulders that makes a great finish.",1112572800,4,931,4.753086419753086

8046213,4,B00079I0BU,This is a pretty decent little DVD for Andre but hopefully they put something out soon with some more depth and matches. I think an entertainer the magnitude of Andre and considering what he accomplished is more than deserving of it. But as far as being really the only product out there solely dedicated to him it's ok. I can't complain about the cost but I'd be willing to pay more for more content that's for sure. Definitely would like to see his career be given the respect and attention it deserves in DVD form. I can't say it's a must have purchase but again considering the lack of available content on him if you're a fan it's worth picking up... I guess ...,1423180800,2,667,4.387096774193548
8046214,5,B00079I0BU,Loved It,1409356800,,8,3.5
8046215,3,B00079I0BU,"Before DVD, the WWE was a pioneer in wrestling for introducing home video revenue to the industry through their extensive output of WrestleMania tapes, character profiles and super tapes from events around the world. One of their earlier tapes was a profile on Andre the Giant, featuring his bouts with Big John Studd, Ken Patera and other superstars. There are also several squash matches featuring as many as three opposing wrestlers.

The highlight for me was the ""Return of the Giant"" match against Patera where we get to see a bit of a mean streak with Andre throwing Ken into the guardrail and fighting on the outside.

This isn't quite a direct port of the VHS to DVD because we get the added bonus of commentary from a Michael Cole and Taz, the Smackdown! announce team at the time, for the Andre/Studd WrestleMania match. Unfortunately, an Andre match without the crowd noise and the superlative commentary team of Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura isn't much fun at all. Sadly, this commentary is hard-coded into the show, so there's no alternative to use the live track.

Despite not being one of the better presentations from the WWE, this DVD offers a ton of rare footage that isn't available in other places. It's worth a look if you're an Andre fan.",1408752000,4,1264,4.762557077625571
