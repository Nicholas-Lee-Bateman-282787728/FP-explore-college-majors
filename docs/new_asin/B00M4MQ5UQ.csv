8670298,2,B00M4MQ5UQ,"I only gave this DVD two stars because it is a professional production with high-quality filming. As far as a workout or practice DVD, it is worthless. There are five programs which appear to be taken from a TV show. Each program is approx. 30 minutes each with three approx. 10-minute segments and they all follow the same pattern. The first segment shows a couples practice with no instruction, just a voice-over discussing the benefits of practicing yoga. The second segment is a short, basic practice with minimal instruction. And the last segment is a solo practice with, again, just a narration about the benefits of yoga. At $15.99, it has to be one of the worst yoga DVD purchases I've ever made. Very disappointed and even a bit angry.",1417305600,,744,4.730769230769231
