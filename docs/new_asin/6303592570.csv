Melvin is a nerdy, wimpy janitor at the local Tromaville Healthclub. Unfortunately he draws the attention of a murderous group of thugs that workout at the club. Melvin finds himself the prime target of a prank by the gang, and ends up face down in a barrel full of toxic waste.

All the effects here are practical, which in my book makes better art. A lot of heads blowing up. It was marketed as a campy super human movie, (cant say heroe due to international copyright laws) and it dilivered that. I love the beautiful blind chick, its like they're making fun of that elephant man movie with Cher. Dont know if they were but it comes off that way sometimes. i.e. blind chick with monster. The sex scene made me utterly sick. Its like its so gross that you cant stop watching, a lot like crap online. Toxic Avenger ranks up there with KickAss, differenf type of humor but with the same spirit. Hey if you like this movie check out BioCop, its pretty sick.

718708,5,6303592570,"This is one of my all time favorite ""schlock horror"" (along with ""Return of the Living Dead"" and any of Bruce Campbell's ""Evil Dead"" series) movies! Yes, it's crude, absurd and hysterically low budget, BUT it's that ""cheesiness"" that puts the schlock in ""schlock horror""!

This tale starts out as your typical American Horatio Alger story, with the hard-working ""Melvin the Mop Boy"" (a janitor at a local gym) taking daily abuse that culminates with his being chased out a 2nd floor window into a vat of toxic sludge.

It's HERE that the story veers slightly off course and our ""hero"" (""Toxie"") is born, as Melvin morphs into what Gene Wilder's Victor Frankenstein character from ""Young Frankenstein"" would call, ""A 7 1/2' tall, 350 pound GORILLA!"" What's more, Toxie's got a conscience...coupled with a mean streak (probably enhanced with some roid rage). It's a compelling combo and Toxie goes on to wreak havoc on corrupt little Traumaville, NJ.

If you like schlock horror, you'll love this one and if you don't know what schlock horror is...""The Toxic Avenger"" might just hook you.",1396396800,,1086,4.956043956043956

718789,5,6303592570,"Anyone with any sort of familiarity with American independent cinema should know The Toxic Avenger, the gory 1984 cult masterpiece about a 98-pound weakling who falls into a vat of toxic waste, transforms into a superhuman monster hero, and makes it his one-man mission to clean up crime in Tromaville, NJ. In addition to preempting the modern craze of exciting, action-packed superhero movies, it also came with a unique style and sensibilities that created a perfect storm of a cult movie: tons of blood, gore, boobs and oddball comedy, along with a handmade look and creative special effects, make it a treat to watch to this day, even twenty-nine years later. Many people know and love Toxie, but not many people in the United States are familiar with the extended Japanese Cut of the film. For years it went unreleased outside of Japan, but now that it's out on DVD, American fans of the Toxic Avenger can enjoy it too.

How is it? Well, I was skeptical at first--after all, with a runtime difference of only four minutes, I was unsure of how different the films would actually be. Nonetheless, intrigued by the delightfully-campy DVD cover (Toxie atop a ""rising sun,"" and the title in giant Japanese writing reminiscent of a daikaiju movie,) and some new special features, the collector in me decided it would be a shame if I didn't pull the trigger on it. Long story short: I'm glad I did. I don't want to spoil the four minutes of extra footage, but they're well worth the watch--let's leave it at that. In addition, there are some alternate takes in the Japanese cut, and these alternate takes really add to the re-watch value. So, as a subtly different movie, it's worth watching for veteran fans wanting a breath of new life into an old favorite. For people uninitiated into the world of Toxie, though, this should be an obvious purchase. It's as fun as it's ever been, with plenty of goofy humor, raunchy imagery, blood and gore, and that midnight-movie style that's so unmistakable.

The transfer, unfortunately, leaves something to be desired. I think it's understandable, considering that, word has it, they were working with an old tape dub for a master. That in mind, it's certainly watchable, and the fuzziness of the picture doesn't take away from the viewing experience at all. The packaging is appropriately no-frills--just a case and a disc, all you need for a movie of this quality. The special features are great fun, too. There are a handful of trailers from the entire Toxic Avenger series, trailers from some other Troma features (the one for Father's Day is especially funny,) a production stills slideshow which is pretty fun to look through, and a couple of funny short films, if you find yourself so inclined. The menus are also fun to look at--big pictures of Toxie with spinning, pinwheeling red stripes really hits home on the point of this release: it's a fun look at an American cult classic, edited for Japanese audiences, and then unearthed, anew, for American audiences to finally see.

Now, he returns to clean up the streets as Tromaville's newest mutant crime-fighter, THE TOXIC AVENGER! Troma sets the bar for the modern B-movie with this campy cult-classic, while launching themselves into low-budget independent B-movie superstardom! The virulent blend of offensive humor, outrageously over-the-top performances, and absurd splatter effects creates the formula for the perfect bad movie. Where else can you see a kid get his head crushed in while riding his bike, or watch a seeing eye dog get blasted by a shotgun? There is no line that Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman won't cross, and for that, we love them. Gary Schneider, Patrick Kilpatrick, and Dan Snow each take their comic book villains to their wildest extremes for more big laughs and mindless exploitation. THE TOXIC AVENGER single-handedly redefines bad taste, and is a must-see, must-own for all B-movie fans!

In this movie, you will see the actually shooting. The one joke they like doing with the Toxic Avenger is hitting his balls many times during a fight or just randomly.

718952,5,6303592570,"The Toxic Avenger is probably one of the best cult movies of its time and of course it brought Troma to life in every way possible. When I heard that this movie was coming out on DVD again and it was put in widescreen quality I thought ""That's cool. Maybe they'll remaster it and give it a new digital makeover!"" Man was I fooled. The 21st Anniversary edition packaging was cool but I played both the new one and the old one. The old one had a transfer that was way way better than the new one and the widescreen format didn't make much of a difference to the movie (than again Troma never did good transfers to their movies, but the original DVD of this movie has a way better transfer). The fullscreen transfer actually had a wider reach than the widescreen version. The extras on the new one are not much better than on the old one. even though it did include most of the stuff on the original version, some of the stuff on the original version was more helpful on the behind the scenes look to the movie. The new one showed mainly fans recreating classic scenes from the movie and the commentary track is different; the one on the original is way more informative. If you don't own the movie the two-disc version is at a cheap price but the original DVD release is cheaper and is definitely the better one to have.

Me, being a big fan of Troma, I did enjoy the movie, and I own the original DVD release. If you people are planning on upgrading to the 21st Anniversary Edition, you may be a little disappointed. I still give this movie a 5-star rating for the movie and for the original DVD release. But beware, as I say again, you may be disappointed with the new DVD release. I'd say only the elite die-hard fans will want the new version. I'm a die-hard fan but I'm perfectly happy with the original version. But the movie passes with flying colors.

718959,5,6303592570,"When I was about 4 years old, I came across a cartoon called Toxic Crusaders. The show lasted only 13 episodes, but it made a big impact on me. It was one of my favorite animated shows at the time along with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and The Real Ghostbusters. Not too long after discovering the cartoon, I crossed paths with a familiar face at the local video store.

I remember going with my Dad to a very small video store. It was the only one near our house at the time, and it's business ran surprisingly well for most of the 90's. So one day I was wandering around and noticed Toxie, leader of the Toxic Crusaders on the cover of a VHS. The cover read ""The Toxic Avenger Part II"" and had an illustration of Toxie with his signature mop in one hand and a hot chick on his shoulder, firing a machine gun. It was one of the coolest images I had seen in my young life and left a lot to the imagination.

Unfortunately, my Dad did not allow me to rent the video. Ironically, I was allowed to watch movies like Puppet Master 2 and Species. Years went by, and I would just stare at the cover of the video. I would wonder what the movie was about and if any of the other Crusaders made an appearence. Near the end of the 90's the small video store closed, but I never stopped thinking about this movie. We started to rent movies from a new video store, it was larger but there was no Toxie in sight.

Then in March of 2001, just a couple months before my 8th Grade Graduation, a new section opened in the video store. It was called CULT CLASSICS. They were all VHS, and to my surprise sat a copy of the very first Toxic Avenger movie. I was in shock; could this be real? I was 14 years old now and I spent ten of those years wondering what would happen if I put this video in the VCR; what would I see? I was 14 now, the rules had changed and the gloves were off; and besides it was my Mom who came with me to the video store on this day.

So, my Mom allowed me to rent it for the evening. My parents were going out with friends and I was finally alone with the one movie that I had wanted to watch since I was four years old. The film was very different from the show I remembered as a kid, it was filled with awesome fight scenes, gore, and few boobs.

719029,5,6303592570,"After hearing for so many years about The Toxic Avenger, I made it my mission in life to hunt this movie down. I spent a lot of time at the local Hastings looking for it, but it seems big companies have a thing against Troma films. Hm, I wonder why.
This search continued for many years, and finally when I was about to give up, the Heaven's blessed me. Kind of. I was looking around in the store and decided to look up TTA in their computer system. To my luck, it said the store had one copy of the 21st Anniversary Edition in stock. So, naturally, I went looking for it, and, of course, couldn't find it on the shelves. Now, when I say local Hastings, I really mean Hastings-that-I-have-to-drive-thirty-miles-to-get-to. The lady said that it was probably still in the back and I asked her to go look, and of course she feeds me some line of crap saying that it's probably still boxed or whatever and she doesn't have time to look for it, try back next week. So I did. And I found it.
So I pop it in my DVD player and start watching it. At first, I was kind of thinking, 'Oh man, what did I just do?' because the acting in the beginning was atrocious. But then I realized it was part of the film's charm. And from there, the film just impressed me, especially with the few-but-gory death scenes. It was controversial, and I finally understood why Wal Mart hates Troma.
If you're looking for something with a budget, good acting, and some sort of class, this is not the place to look. Only special people can appreciate a Troma film, and I am proud to say that I am one of these special people. If you appreciate low budget film making with little to no candor, you just can't go wrong with a Troma film. Especially this one.",1226188800,2,1725,4.294478527607362

A couple of days ago, me and my friend went to a weird, underground video store (definitely not your normal blockbuster or Hollywood video) and I happened to finally come across The Toxic Avenger.  I have looked for this movie at other video stores but was unsuccesful at finding it.  This video store also carried atrocities such as Cannibal Holocaust, which I was very surprised to find.

Anyways, so I went back home, popped the DVD into my xbox 360 and watched the most brilliant movie ever created.  First of all, this movie is pure cheese, but it was meant to be that way, so WAY TO GO TROMA!!  The acting is so over the top that its just ridiculous, and this goes for the gore-fx as well.  None of the characters are believable.  They over-do it so bad that I think it takes talent to do so.  The gore in the movie is alot more realistic than the acting.  You'll get to see children's brains being run over by cars, dogs being shot, and much more.  It is sick, but Jesus is it entertaining (and funny).

The biggest thing about this movie is the comedy, and it so funny I almost crapped my pants.  Toxie is the funniest super-hero i've ever seen.  He constantly growls, and he has the most hilarious one liners your ears have ever heard.  Even for being mutated into a monster, he has the most normal voice out of everyone in the film.  Everything that he did, from mopping people's faces to throwing an old lady into a drying machine, was 100% hilarious fun.

Overall, if you are ready to see an extremely gory cheesefest, then this movie is for you.  This movie's taste is so foul and absurd that it is pure genius.  I just don't know why all movies can't be like this.  Go buy or rent it to see for yourselves.",1186358400,,1821,4.315634218289086
719034,5,6303592570,"wow. the toxic avenger. what an amazing freaking movie! if there is one film that defines 80's cinema, i feel that its the toxic avenger. the film is about a nerd janitor named melvin who is constantly harrased by  everyone at the tromaville health club were he works. he receives the most torment from 4 hit and run drivers, one of whom tricks melvin into dressing in a tutu and meeting her at the pool were everyone is waiting to laugh at him. melvin is chased through the health club before jumping out a window and landing in a barrel of misplaced toxic waste. this transforms him into the toxic avenger or toxie for short. its now toxies job to fight crime in tromaville and get revenge on the 4 creeps who transformed him into a monster. the toxic avenger is a very,very entertaining film that althoughis full of violence and sensitive subject matter, is still very funny. the best parts of the film are toxies fights with the deranged criminals of tromaville. his first fight is against 3 drug dealers who are about to kill a cop. another cool fight scene is against 3 insane freaks robbing a fast food rersaurant. besides these 2 fight scenes, the rest of the film is wildly enjoyable. gore hounds will be pleased as toxie smashes heads, tears limbs, gouges eyes and rips out the guts of every sadistic criminal he comes across. one infamous scene is were the 4 hit and run drivers run over a young boys head. even though this scene is pretty intense and disturbing, its not done to disturb the audience and the rest of the films violence is done in an over the top fashion. if you haven't seen the toxic avenger then trust me, you won't be dissapointed. my only complaint is that toxies revenge onthe 4 hit and run drivers should have been as gruesome as the rest of the films violence. they ran over a little kid and laughed about it! they should have been torn to peices, but they still get whats coming to em. the toxic avenger is one of my all time favorite films and i'm positive that once you see it you'll love it. get tromatized!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1174694400,,2060,4.4787234042553195

719036,3,6303592570,"Toxic Avenger 21st Anniversary Ed. 2 Disc Set 2005 (Unrated), Original Release 1986

Bullies torment innocent Melvin Junko, the janitor at a Health Club. After he falls into toxic waste, he returns to kill the evildoers as the Toxic Avenger. Along the way, he falls in love with a blind girl, angers citizens, and has the Mayor try to kill him.

The opening of the film has preachy narration about pollution and toxic waste, which would make an astute viewer think that Yale grad, Uncle Lloydy, was actually trying to say something here. The film has many scenes of violence and I can understand the controversy. But all of that is undercut by sheer lunacy and it is hard to take this seriously.

No one is off limits here: Blacks, Jews, Gays, children, the blind, obese people, the elderly, and midgets. There is even a gay gangster named Nipples. You will see a seeing eye dog shot, a blind girl almost raped, and an old lady beat to death by own her cane. Oh, and there was that young boy that was run over repeatedly while trying to crawl away for help. And that girl in the sauna? Yes, she is masturbating to pictures of the dead boy. Sadistic, enough?

The comedy is plentiful though. The first scenes with goofy Melvin and the bimbos and lugheads are hilarious. The theme song ""Body Talk"" had me singing along. And then there is the ""Healthy Troma"" billboard prominently displayed throughout the movie featuring a portly Mayor.

The one scene that was borderline difficult to watch was the restaurant hold up. The guy in the make-up looked like a scary clown and tormented the people innocently sitting there. He shoots the blind girl's seeing eye dog and his Black accomplice attempts to rape her. Of course, before things veer into really nasty territory, Toxie saves the day and lands himself a clumsy girlfriend that cooks with Draino.

The special effects are awesome considering there was no budget. I heard they used watermelons and spaghetti to make some of the effects, but I couldn't tell. Toxie sounded incredibly weird though. I thought maybe this was voice-over work done later since the actor was in make-up and couldn't move his face. Or maybe it was intentional. Either way it added to my enjoyment.

Favorite Quote: A cop says to a young boy, ""Johnny, You can't just walk around doing what is right.""

Obviously inspired by schlock horror films, the special effects are purposely over the top. This is a manufactured cult film, unlike say anything by Ed Wood, for example, in that it was specifically designed to be a cult movie. Yes you don't eat ketchup potato chips or cheese whiz every day either but if you want a good laugh around a lot of really gross special effects and a totally unpolitically comedy, The Toxic Avenger will more than meet your expectations.",1155859200,4,684,4.756302521008403

Until one unfortunate (or fortunate day) day, poor Melvin gets seduced by the sexy girlfriend of one of the bullies that leads to ultimate embarassment and a suicidal leap from an upstairs window into a barrel of toxic chemicals that begin sudden changes to his body. Transforming nerdy Melvin into a hideously deformed mutant of superhuman size and strength known as The Toxic Avenger, he then helps the good citizens of his town from killers, rapists and thugs especially the dastardly mayor who wants him dead, he also falls for a lovely blind girl (Sarah) that doesn't know what he really looks like but she loves him none the less.

This is the movie that got me hooked into Troma movies and this is one of the funniest, craziest, goriest and most brilliant horror comedies i've ever seen! this is the movie that put Troma on the map of independent cinema, paving the way for such filmmakers like Quentin Taratino, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, Peter Jackson Etc. The film was originally going to get an ""X"" rating but was released unrated into theaters, it was a minor hit at the New York/ New Jersey area, it turned out to be one of the most beloved cult movies of all time and I can see why. The acting is laughable but there is some good memorable gore effects like the kid getting his skull crushed by a car and a dog literally blown away with a shotgun, this motion picture is one of my top movies of all time and should be seen to believe.

The 2-Disc 21st anniversary golden edition has chockloads of goodies like an audio commentary, trailers, easter eggs, featurettes, fan-projects, scenes from ""Toxic Avenger: The Musickill"", Radioation March short and much more. There is no soundtrack available at this time, perhaps it's about time they outta release it on CD, Any fan of the movie would kill to get their hands on it.

But when a prank meant to embarass him goes horribly wrong, he ends up falling into a barrel of toxic waste -- transforming him into a huge, messy monster. Driven to fight evil, he becomes the hero of the small town of Tromaville. He does everything from busting murderers to helping old ladies across the street. But low-life criminals aren't all that's standing in his way. The corrupt mayor of Tromaville wants him dead -- and will go to any lengths to stop this sudden appearance of justice in his rotten town.

Knowing little about the freaky superhero known as The Toxic Avenger, I was expecting a light-hearted horror/action film about a monster crime-fighter. It was even listed in the horror section. But what I got instead was a highly comedic popcorn flick with plenty of laughs, intentionally hammy acting, cheesy yet witty lines, and bucketloads of violent fun. Toxie and the other characters (including a blind woman who ends up as his lover) were obvious evidence that this is not to be taken seriously. TA is a completely absurd tale that will stupify any viewer. There are a few sublimal hints at how ridiculous some parts of society have become, but come on, who would watch it for the morals?

To top it all off, this particular DVD edition is a great purchase for anyone who wants to own the movie. The film's presented in its original, uncut version, and the menus are busting at the seams with special features. The people at Troma sure do know how to have good old fashioned fun, and The Toxic Avenger is clear proof. It's one of the dumbest movies you could ever see. And just remember -- that's a good thing!

In a town called Tromaville there is a gym where a little dweeb named Melvin works. He's a geek who gets on all the cool kids nerves. They plan a prank on him that ends seeing Melvin fall out of a window and land in a barrel of Toxic waste on the back of a truck parked outside. But instead of killing Melvin, it turns him into a hideously deformed creature of super human size and strength that develops Troma-zones that make Melvin fight crime when needed. Melvin helps the people of Tromaville and cleans up the town of its crime, while also getting revenge on the kids who caused him to become what he is.

Review

TA is a dark comedy full of action, horror and comedy that will not be accepted by people who take things too seriously. It is an over the top, cult style film. It's a breath of fresh air to have a movie with actors who aren't trying to steal the spotlight, or use the film as a stepping-stone to further there acting credibility for future reference. This movie would never win any academy award. But that's what we love about because we hate the academy awards anyway. Toxie is just a great movie of the little guy that was always pushed around finds himself in a situation that leads to him finishing on top...and also some wacky, gross, disgusting, silly, over drawn, ridicules things along the way. It's a fun movie but not something to sit down with grandma to watch.

DVD

Finally I was able to sit down, kick back and relax and watch the Toxic Avenger clearly and as a bonus, uncut. I've had the first 3 Toxies on VHS for years, but the videos where bad quality, warn out and the image was always rolling and fading, the sound was dropping in and out... so even tho I've been a fan of Toxie for years, I felt like I was watching it for the first time.

The quality isn't super great, there is still speckles here and there, but it's clear enough not to worry about it, they polished it up as best they could and you'll only see the dust speckles if your purposely looking for them.

The sound wasn't surround sound, but it didn't matter, least it was clear and loud enough to understand what was being said.

Bonus Features

Like many of the Troma DVD's, TA is packed with great bonus features. There are 2 discs in this edition, but I think if they had have tried, it would all fit onto 1 disc.

- Interviews - There is heaps of interviews with Lloyd Kaufman (Producer/President of Troma) & Mitch Cohen (Toxic Avenger) plus many more of the actors and directors.

- Commentary - Interesting

- Intro to the movie by Lloyd

- The intro and outro used on the laser-disc version

- Fan films - Short films sent to Troma from fans inspired by Toxie, they're actually so bad there entertaining!

- Deleted scenes - Why did they cut these? Some of them and hilarious!

- Plus a heap of stuff you find on every Troma DVD like the tour of Troma, and how to make a movie things etc.

Cons:

- A lot of the bonus features look like where recorded off a VHS, but who cares, there only bonus features, the movie is fine.

- No subtitles -

- no out-takes, gag-reel, bloopers.

As you can see, the positive weighs down the negatives enough to show that Troma has once again presented a great movie with a great DVD package.",1118880000,15,3245,4.313014827018122

Peter Jackson (only one of Hollywood's major directors who admits to be influenced by Toxie, filmstudio Troma and director Lloyd Kaufman) would never have made his earlier horror-flicks which made him famous enough to be chosen to direct this much too expensive series. The Toxic Avenger may have influenced many directors, it has never quite been surpassed in its originality and brilliance, which is even more surprising if you take into account that it was made for the price of Christopher Lee's breakfast on the set of LotR.
Lloyd Kaufman is a genius, and his films are trendsetting, innovative and completely original. The Toxic Avenger is the one that put his (and Michael Herz's) filmcompany Troma on the map and 30 years later they still survive as a truly independent studio, in spite of  increasingly below-the-belt practices of the Major Conglomerates who don't really like to have any competition of someone who actually has ORIGINAL IDEAS. Besides Disney, Troma is the only filmcompany in the world that has a legion of fans who follow the Brand in itself. And such a thing can only happen if that brand has proven to be responsible for a continuous string of very special, innovating and high-quality products.
This release is a deserved tribute to one of Horrorfilm's icons. The Toxic Avenger turns 21 this month, and with three sequels to his name he is still more alive than he has ever been. Besides a wonderful TROMAMORPHIC widescreen presentation of the film (that has never looked better) this set offers hours of very interesting bonus-material which makes it  quite difficult to turn off the TV set. There is a brand new Audio Commentary. Kaufman's commentary tracks are always an attraction of their own, and this one is certainly no exception. With his unique sense of humor, sharp analisys and immense know-how of making films he offers a highly entertaining, funny and informative commentary that in some cases can even be seen as an extension of his Make Your Own Damn Movie-instructions.
The fist disc also offers very interesting recent interviews with a great number of the original stars of the film, seven deleted scenes, the intro and outro from the original Laser Disc release and an updated 45 minute film showing highlights of many Troma-appearances on festivals and other occasions around the world in ""Where in the world is Toxie"".
And even though this first disc is more than worth the price alone, there is a second dvd in this set with some fantastic stuff. There are fan-submissions of a number of very interesting reminiscences, hommages and short films of surprising quality that need to be checked out, unique scenes from the successfull theatrical musical TOXIC AVENGER: THE MUSIKILL , original trailers for all toxic avenger films, trailers for other Troma-releases and much more Tromatic information. Another disc that would be interesting enough and worth the low price of the entire set.
This is the ultimate release of this very important film. A MUST BUY for thos who haven't yet seen the film. A HAVE-TO-GET for anyone who is familiar with the film but still does not have the title in their collection, but also a GOTTA-GET-IT-TODAY for those who already have the film, as this presentation is much better than ever before, and it offers a load of highly entertaining, infomative and not-to-be-missed extra's that is unheard-of, especially on such an affordable release.

About the 21st Anniversary Golden Edition:
-------------------------------------------------
You might want to think twice before picking this edition up. Why? This one claims to be in ""Tromorphic Widescreen"". Now, let's be real: these films are not going to suffer if they're not presented in widescreen because - as is noted up front in the new commentary - Troma films in a 1.33:1 ratio. Kaufman even admits that their non-widescreen releases are better because the viewer is in fact getting more information not masked off the top and bottom. Not knowing that beforehand I took a chance and picked this up. Suffice to say, I like the original, ""full frame"" edition better. All they've done is mask off the top and bottom, which is not an improvement. Again, I'm not expecting Criterion quality for Toxie by any means (though it would be interesting to see what THEY would do with this), but there's another reason to keep your original - although TA is given the widescreen treatment, it is NOT anamorphic 16:9. IT IS LETTERBOX ONLY. If you're a fan, I'd advise picking it up for cheap in a used bin.",1098144000,2,1353,4.733050847457627
719220,5,6303592570,"Easily in the top 5 of my top 10 B movies, The Toxic Avenger somehow manages to be in turns knee slappingly hilarious, cynically satirical, nasty and disgusting, warm and fuzzy, goofy and dumb beyond belief (purposefully so), sweet and tickle-me-pink cute, distasteful, offensive, romantic (in a really twisted way), and vomitously gory. All delivered with strong, positive social and ecological messages. In other words, there is no other movie like it. There's a reason why a crummy B-flick like this with a virtually non-existent budget went on to become a household word all over the country. It's loads of fun folks! It's a classic. Just don't watch this one around the kids. Instead get them the Toxic Crusaders animated film.",1097107200,,732,5.0578512396694215

719303,2,6303592570,"From the production value, the acting, the direction, the annoying way in which the production company treats itself and it's audience, ""The Toxic Avenger"" may very well be the worst movie in the history of the Universe.  Which is a rather dubious distinction considering ""The Thin Red Line"", and ""Keeping the Faith"" have been released in this time continuum.
The plot is fairly simple...Some dweeb works at a gym. People at the gym are mean to him. People at the gym pull practical joke on dweeb. Joke goes horribly wrong, and the dweeb is disfigured.  Disfigured, the dweeb gets his revenge on the ""mean people"", and ends up with a girl (I'd say ""the girl"", but the girl, in this movie, was just some contrived plot device).  The only plot twist is that the people who are deservedly mean to the dweeb (the dweeb is the sort of person anyone would pick on), are sadistic murders, who wantonly commit vehicular homicide during the evening, and are so blatantly bigoted, the Republican party will inevitably adopt them as their mascots in the not-too-distant-future.
But stangely enough, this film, which for all intents and purposes should never have been made, actually turns out almost watchable.  The gratuitous sex draws in the teenage viewer with their raging hormones, and the very explicit violence draws in the conissuer's of violence, such as myself, who are always looking for the next ""Evil Dead.""  While this movie is nowhere near as good as the ""Evil dead"", it is a comedy in the same vein as the ED.  While bigoted hipster's, murdering defenseless children may seem repugnant, the way it is filmed, just seems so absurd, it actually becomes rather comical (the ""head crushing"" scene for instance).  And the contrived romance between toxie and the blind chick is a very predictable plot twist, but it is acceptable, and does continue character development in some sense.
The only way in which a movie like this can get worse is if the producers insult their audience, by taking themself seriously.  On the DVD extra's, the producers go into full ""kayfabe"" mode (to borrow a wrestling term), and totally insult the audience by acting as if the Toxic Avenger is a legitimate person, and the movie was just some sort of adaptation of the Toxic Avenger's life.  A segment like that just insults the audience, and will in all probability just repell viewers...
Pretensious DVD documentary aside, this is a below average movie, definitely worth at least one look (especially if you're a fan of gratuitous violence such as myself), but don't go in expecting ""Scarface"" or a ""Godfather"" type of movie (you know, movie's people actually consider good), or you'll be very disappointed.

Lloyd Kaufman and gang take deep pleasure in producing only the worst films money cannot buy, films loaded with gore, ..., and hammy acting. ""The Toxic Avenger"" is a bit different from the other garbage that Troma churns out, mainly due to its ""so bad it's good"" status. I first saw this film when it came out on video, in 1986 or 1987, and the gore scenes were my first real introduction into the grindhouse cinema world. When a DVD player appeared under the tree at Christmas this year, this was one of the first films I picked up. If anything, I actually thought the movie was better than when I first watched it, an upsetting revelation if there ever was one.
Poor, poor Melvin. He is a nerd who gets absolutely no respect from anyone in Tromaville. Our lovable geek spends most of his time mopping the floor at the local gym, where he inadvertently knocks people into the pool, slaps people with his mop, and horrifies the local ladies with his shlocky grin. Melvin really gets into trouble when he angers four of the local ""beautiful"" people. For nothing more than a few laughs, these four [people] decide to play a little joke on Melvin, a gag that takes a decidedly terrible turn for the worse when Melvin falls into a barrel of toxic waste. The result of this weird baptism is the Toxic Avenger, a muscle bound, tutu-wearing [strange guy] that decides to battle [the world] in Tromaville.
As Superman, Batman, and other superheroes know, battling [the world] can be a thankless job. The hours stink, someone in charge always thinks you are up to no good, and you have to hide your identity from loved ones. All of these things happen to our good hero Toxie, but with a distinct twist. Toxie must still fight the bad guys at night, when he cracks a few skulls together in an alley or seeks revenge against his enemies. And while the mutated one does not need to hide his identity from his girlfriend (she's blind, conveniently enough), he still has to live in the city dump. Then there are the [bad] ones: a [dishonest] mayor and his [strict] police chief, a gang of thugs who really take a bloody beating, and the four yucks who played the trick on Melvin. All [end their lives] in extraordinarily gruesome ways, usually accompanied by aphoristic dialogue that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger stand up and bellow with pride.
Ultimately, it is the gore that draws a viewer to this film. The coup de grace is the head-crushing scene, which still manages to invoke the ""ugh"" factor after all these years. This scene is so unforgettable that Troma made sure to advertise it on the front of the DVD case. Regrettably, the rest of the gore in the film is uneven: several scenes during a robbery at a taco stand are outstanding while another crushed head scene in the gym is mediocre at best. Still, if you are a gore fan you must see this film for that fateful meeting between a boy on his bike and a car.
It might seem a wee bit ridiculous to invest this film with a deeper meaning, some sublime theme that allows it to transcend the double digit budget and gutter humor, but there is an attempt at a message in the film. Throughout the movie, we become aware of Melvin's status as an outsider, a reclusiveness that becomes more pronounced after his shocking transformation. When the people of Tromaville finally stand up to protect their grotesque hero, the outsider becomes accepted. In this respect, ""The Toxic Avenger"" is very mainstream, as most big budget Hollywood films promote similar ideas. Of course, there are not many [famous] actors who fall into a vat of toxic waste, burst into flames, and then [destroy] people with a mop.
There are plenty of extras on this DVD, including a commentary with director/Troma founder Lloyd Kaufman, a tour of the Troma studio, some lost scenes, plenty of stills, and some fun trailers. The picture quality is good considering the age of the movie and the nothing budget the film was shot on. The sound quality is nothing to write home about, but what you hear is more than adequate to enjoy the film. In short, I think this film is worth the price of admission, especially if you cannot resist watching low budget gold.",1048291200,,4328,4.6220779220779225

719308,5,6303592570,"Finally, a film that can give Warhol's Frankenstein some competition. The Toxic Avenger is camp humor and gore that makes the violence of Warhol seem laid back. Toxie gives you something to laugh at.

The buff beautiful people who draw out Melvin's id, much to their chagrin later in the film, are reminiscent of the potheads of Reefer Madness, in their crazed drinking binges .  The Toxic Avenger in its gore intensity is a film similar to the ones shown to kids in drivers' education classes, with titles like 'Blood Runs Red on the Highway', depicting State Policemen picking up severed heads from the spots they've rolled to, usually behind the wheel of the same tractor-trailer that totaled the car, then tossing it indiscreetly into the body bag.  As the plot of The Toxic Avenger unfolds, the buff beautiful people becoming bored and intoxicated run over an innocent youth riding his bicycle, crushing his head beneath their car tire.  Filmed as close as the perspective of the victim, this scene won't phase you a bit.  An exaggerated film with a point, the storyline in the meanwhile has Melvin becoming the burning man after falling into nuclear waste, and running home to become the Toxic Avenger.
 Listening at the bathroom door, as Toxie moans in morphing pain, his mother beams. ""Finally puberty!""  Before the film is done, he avenges the community wronged by the criminals, himself wronged by the bullies, and he finds a girlfriend who loves his id just as id is.

The acting is over the top as is necessary for Troma. It fits perfectly for the world that Lloyd Kaufman has created. It almost seems unreal that someone like Melvin really exists in this world. Just point a Dork-O-Meter at this kid and it will melt, but when he transforms into Toxie he becomes a damn ugly Don Juan/Charles Bronson/Superman.
I love old people and have a ton of respect for them, but when that old lady gets beat down by those two thugs, I couldn't stop laughing. Anyway this film has all the ingredients that make Troma a force to be reckoned with thrown right in.

719395,3,6303592570,"With the Toxic Avenger, like most Troma films, it's hard to wrap your mind around what you've just watched. Not there is any deep emotional insight and political commentary here. It's just that there is a difficulty in figuring out just what this film is. Not to mention whether or not it's actually any good.
Toxic Avenger is undeniably low grade. Production quality, writing, and cinematic technique take a back seat to the quest for the lowest common denominator. It's undoubtedly an exploitation film and no target is unworthy. From fat people to muscle headed jocks, blind people to little old ladies, Toxic takes every cheap shot it can think of. And it makes sure to lay them on with a very broad stroke. No subtlety here folks. That also goes for there obvious delight in soft core hijinks and gore that borders on the ludicrous. There is nothing like seeing a man getting pounded over the head with his own arm. And yet I still enjoyed it.
There is no doubt that Toxic Avenger is the very definition of B-movie. One might go as far as to call it a C-movie. But this is nothing that fans of Troma's particular brand of crap don't already know. Because there lies the charm. I personally admit to laughing heartily throughout. Probably more due to the fact that I sat there mouth agape, amazed at what I was watching. Everything about this movie is excessive. Most notably for me was the psycho jock foursome who emotionally torture janitor Melvin, (the future Toxie). They don't just chew the scenery, they gnaw and tear at it like it's a big, juicy turkey leg. Keep an eye out for the top jock, who's head always seems about ready to explode, and his main squeeze, who's giant, gnashing, pearly whites are quite blinding, (and not just a little frightening). Everyone else envolved manages to overact to, although to somewhat lesser degrees, and there is obvious enjoyment had by all envolved. Then there is Toxie himself, a likable hero even when he's walking around grunting and disemboweling people. Surprisingly he is one of the few characters who doesn't seem loopy, although he makes up for it in the carnage he leaves behind.
This is, of course, a comedy. And on that level it is a success. But it is still a bad movie even in light of that. Toxic Avenger never claimed it wasn't bad, which is an obviously redeeming quality. Still, though the humor is low brow, some of it falls flat and misses out on intentional laughs in exchange for simply humorously bad ones. Having a police chief who acts like some kind of odd Dr. Strangelove, Colonel Klink combination just doesn't make sense. There are some small jokes that are so broad and juvenile that they are almost pointless. And some major plot shifts make the film lose track of it's overall destination.
But this is great fun, though mainly for those who already enjoy this sort of thing. If your not the sort of person who can get a laugh out of watching some kid get his head pulped by the back tire of a car, then I'd look elsewhere for enjoyment.
As for this dvd, the film quality is decent and it's probably better than any previous version, but the fact that it is low budget is obvious. The same goes for the audio. The Toxic Avenger is crammed full of special material. There are deleted scenes, some quite funny. A number of trailers for some of their more well known films, like ""Surf Nazis Must Die"", are also here, as is Toxic Avenger. An interesting Toxic memorabilia section with many little tidbits relating to Toxie, notably the opening scene from the short lived Toxic Avenger cartoon from the early nineties, (I had forgotten about it until I saw this),add to the fun. You'll also find a trivia game. Answering questions results in short video clips from and assortment of Troma's films. Right and wrong answers each result in different clips so you'll probably have to go through it several times. Finally, there is a twisted tour of Troma's New York office. Much of this is led by Lloyd Kaufman himself, the madman behind much of Troma's labors, including Toxic Avenger. It's an enjoyable collection enfussed with the same demented sense of humor that makes Toxic so bizarre. If you like Troma, this is their crown jewel. If you like your movies sans that very special Toxie brand of humor, well...I just pity you.;)",1000857600,4,4306,4.652230971128609

I love all the violent scenes in this film. It shows you what would happen if you did something like that to someone, but you were to afraid to do it. The violent scenes are also hilarious!
Little kids would just love this film if their parents would let them watch it, which would be really funny.
There aren't too many jokes told in this one. But whenever there are, they are just as funny as Melvin sticking a mop down some guy's throat.
This is the best TOXIC AVENGER film ever. It's a shame that Part 2 & 3 were so bad. Those next two films were horrible. If you want to know what I thought of them, then go check out the sequels and look in the reviews for my name. I'm not going to act like God and tell you to stay away from them.

719401,5,6303592570,"Cool movie, The Toxic Avenger is an instant cult classic. The original movie is extremelly well done and fun to watch. I also like the way that it  includes material that most other film makers would not dare to use in a  film. Example: The kid on a bike being pursosley killed for the amusment of  criminals. I liked the fight scenes because they were comical and had a lot  of blood and gore. As for Toxic Avenger 2, it was not as good as the first  one. It was okay, but the focused was changed from comical gore to crnball  gags. And Toxic Avenger 3 was so incredibly bad that you would have to be a  complete imbicile to enjoy it no matter what. Part 3 was so incredibly bad,  they basically recycled the plot from part 2, took the audience for  complete idiots by ignoring nearly everything from the last movie, having  Toxie accept a job from the evil Apocalypse Inc. Company he defeated in the  last movie, as if he was supposed to not remember who they were. They also  brought back bad guys who Toxie killed in the last movie. And they  incorporated absurdely and heavy religious content into the script that did  not fit well into the script. And even at just around 90 minutes long, Part  3 drags and the storyline often makes no sense at all. So in conclusion I  would highly recommend the original movie, say watch the second one if you  have time, and don't even bother with the third one. And the Upcoming Toxic  Avenger 4:Citizen Toxie looks promising. I do hope that they gring back  more of what worked so well in the first movie.",966729600,7,1549,4.353146853146853

If you haven't then this is truly the way to be introduced. This is probably the film i  remember the most from the eighties. Sure the great 80's had classics like  the indiana jones trilogy, phantasm 2, and so on, but somehow this flick  went over all that and delivered everything that made movies great. Packed  with comedy, this story of a supergeek that is constantly mocked and  taunted is more than you bargained for. Stuff starts going over your head  when a prank against this particular nerd is literally ""tricked off a  building"", naturally he falls into a vat of toxic waste and so begins  the odyssey of Toxie.  After this you are treated with relentless gore, a  compassionate hero, his blind girlfriend, cheesy acting, and everything  that is politically incorrect in our minds. Toxie goes out to enact revenge  on his agressors, on the way leading us to endless entertainment. Troma  proves that they are the best in schlock with the title that made them  titans of good film sludge. Mind you this is not a film for average  viewers, more for fans of the horror/sci-fi genre. Also understand that  this is a film not to be taken seriously but more to just have fun with.  Regardless of its limited appeal most will fall in love with the toxic  hero, hell even kids will. Although this dvd edition is more graphic than  the cut i remember seeing, i will certainly let my child see the glory of  troma when he comes of age.
