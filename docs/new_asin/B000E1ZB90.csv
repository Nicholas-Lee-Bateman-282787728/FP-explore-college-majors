8104391,5,B000E1ZB90,"The fourth volume in the ""Princess Tutu"" series continues to show that it is a phenomenal show (even if it's often overlooked because of its name or basic setup).  Its mood is more reminiscent of volume three than the first two; even if there are still plenty of lighthearted moments, the story has progressed beyond Ahiru, as Princess Tutu, wanting to save the prince's heart.  Actions that the characters take determine a whole new outline.

Edel's choice to do more than just be a puppet starts of a string of events that were not supposed to happen in Drosselmeyer's story.  ""There is happiness for those who accept their fate, glory for those who defy it,"" one character says.  That sums up the start of this volume very well.  The first thirteen episodes generally involved the characters accepting their fates, with a few key exceptions near the end.  Volume four begins the point in time where all characters begin to whole-heartedly fight against the plans that have been layed out by them, bringing the depth of the series to a whole new level.

If you've already seen the first three volumes, there is no reason for this review to wax poetic about the classical ballet music incorporated into the storyline.  It remains much as it had in the previous episodes--wonderful.

My only warning against this volume is for those who found Rue detestable in the first three and are unwilling to change their minds about her.  She goes on a particular journey throughout the course of this second ""arc,"" and anyone with an open mind will pity her by the end of the show.  However, if you're dead-set on not liking her, you may find that this volume doesn't have as much emotional impact as the first three.  Exploring Rue's past and determining her relationship with Mytho and Ahiru in the future are two major factors in the latter part of the series.

All in all, it's a fantastic show, well worth the money; but, if you're looking at buying the fourth volume, I probably don't need to tell you that.",1177113600,4,2004,4.688571428571429
