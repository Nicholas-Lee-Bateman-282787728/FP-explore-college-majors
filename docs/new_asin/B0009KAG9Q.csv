8062529,5,B0009KAG9Q,"Another great chosen collection of hilarious THE COSBY SHOW episode,now which are all available in season sets. In THEO AND THE JOINT,Clair(Phylcia Ayers Allen) accidentally knocks high school freshman Theo's(Malcolm Jamal Warner) geography book off the Huxtables' kitchen table and discovers a not-yet-smoked joint. A classmate hid it in the book(of all places) when a teacher entered the classroom. Later Tony Braxton,the classmate,confessed to the possession of the joint to Theo and Cliff(Bill Cosby). In DENISE DRIVES,the newly-licensed Denise(Lisa Bonet) buys a used 1962 Starfire from one of Cliff's buddies. In THEO AND COCKROACH,Theo and his buddy Walter ""Cockroach"" Bradley(Carl Payne II,recurringly) use a phonograph record for a test on the Shakespeare play MacBeth. Theo,Cockroach and Cliff encounter a bunch of snowball-throwing(mean and dumb,I must say) kids. In DENISE'S FRIEND,a friend of hers who is pregnant,who meets Cliff at the Community Center,comes to him for help and support. The other episodes are awesome.",1192406400,,1033,5.758169934640523
