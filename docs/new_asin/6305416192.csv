1018447,1,6305416192,"""His Girl Friday"" is one of my all-time favorite movies and I was looking forward to having a copy on DVD.  I had read the reviews on here at Amazon about the D3K release and just figured people were  exaggerating about the poor quality.  I mean, it's DVD, it's gotta be  great, right?  Wrong.  This version is awful.  The sound is scratchy and  the picture quality is worse than anything I've seen, even on VHS.  As a  matter of fact, my VHS copy is far superior.  Even if you really love this  movie, I suggest you wait until someone does a better job of restoring it.  The only reason I give this DVD version one star is because it's still a  wonderful movie.",952387200,17,662,4.276422764227642
1018448,3,6305416192,"DON'T BUY THE DVD!  I was given this as a gift and I was astonished at just how bad the quality of this DVD is! The sound is awful for the most part and visually it's gauzey and fuzzy; I literally could not believe that  the VHS version could be so much superior! If you haven't seen this movie,  you MUST (on the VHS)- it's a terrific  , rollicking classic which is  quickly paced with realistically overlapping dialogue and unbelievably  great performances (one could say that this film is a lesson in screen  acting!) Rosalind Russell is BEYOND great and Cary Grant is a MARVEL. Once  you begin watching, you won't take your eyes off this unique, unforgettable  film.",948844800,27,670,4.563025210084033
1018449,1,6305416192,"Avoid this product at all costs. This great movie is ruined on this disc. The image quality is awful and continuously blurred. The sound quality is equally fuzzy. It's like watching a movie with your head wrapped in cheese  cloth.

1018450,1,6305416192,"This transfer suffers from the same problems reported by other Amazon shoppers for the D3K edition of ""Charade"".  It seems like D3K masters their discs from broadcasts by Encore or AMC.  Unless you've got to  have it, wait for some else to do a better job or buy the VHS.",947030400,18,271,4.38
1018451,1,6305416192,"A long-time favorite movie of mine, ""His Girl Friday"" is overdue for a thorough restoration.  With its release on DVD, I hoped I'd see Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell looking crisp and sharp and  hear their  crackling dialogue with new clarity.  Alas!  This DVD appears to be a  pirated copy made from a defective video tape.  I was unable to tolerate  more than five minutes of the fuzzy, ghostly spectres that flickered across  the screen or the hisses and burbles that issued from the apparitions in  place of dialogue.  I seriously question the honesty of the manufacturer.  An outrage.

1018452,1,6305416192,"I'm sure you know that this classic movie is great.  The DVD itself, on the other hand, is not what I've come to expect regarding restoration and remastering and whatnot.  Bottom line is, the quality was as bad as the  ""bargain bin"" VHS tapes of old movies that I quickly learned to  avoid.  In particular the sound was badly degraded, with a hiss that made  it difficult to understand the dialog towards the beginning (that improved  somewhat, but it was still bad).  That's particularly annoying because I  could clean it up better than that myself, with a trivial application of  ""Cool Edit"" shareware!  Clearly, this is a direct scan of poor  quality original and zero work went into presenting it.  The picture, too,  is full of flickering spots and the whole thing has a soft out-of-focus  look to it. If you just have to have this film in your collection, be  resigned to the poor quality.  If you're just looking, ask yourself if it's  cheap enough for the lousy job.",944697600,112,975,4.635294117647059
1018453,5,6305416192,"One of my very favourites.  Howard Hawk's masterpiece is a culmination of the ""screwball"" comedy tradition of the thirties.  Here, it's the dialogue rather than the plot which gives this gem its distinction.  Roz Russell as Hildy turns the newsroom upside down as she throws her well-padded shoulders around.  She's a fast-talking dame who's accepted by the newsmen as ""one of the boys""; she's  a fast talker with a quick retort for each and every wisecrack.  The character of Walter Burns is made-to-order for Grant.  Here, his stunts are verbal; his insults fly like daggers; the pace is somewhat frenzied, yet the film doesn't suffer from its weak thread of a plot.  Time dances frantically by; the comedy is copious and varied; the gags are rapid-fire.  The sarcastic banter between Hildy and Burns is the soul of the film. and it is this clever repartee that captures the audience.  HIS GIRL FRIDAY is a fast, furious classic version of the Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur 1928 hit play ""The Front Page"". This movie is a unique example of Hollywood's golden years of film-making. The dialogue is delivered at breakneck speed with overlapping and clever inside jokes throughout. Rosalind Russell is a most inspired choice for Hildy Johnson (originally the character was a man) and she makes the best of her new-found niche in films; she's irreplaceable. Cary Grant has never been better and he even got to use his real name (Archie Leach) in one of his lines. Ralph Bellamy, an actor I usually don't care much for, fits right in here and the chemistry between the three is nothing less than exciting. There are serious undertones and John Qualen gives his most famous performance; he and the hysterical Helen Mack are chilling in their portrayals. Must be seen!",944006400,2,1765,4.872909698996655

1018601,5,6305416192,"One of the great 1940s comedies -- recently ranked in the top 10 films about the press. This was the movie version of a Broadway play by Ben Hecht called ""Front Page"", about 1920s tabloid journalism in Chicago. Cleverly, they changed the gender of reporter, Hildy Johnson, from male (in the stage play) to female -- Rosalind Russell -- in the movie. The interplay between Russell and Grant is wonderful. Also, this is fast paced -- some of the dialogue has been clocked at 240 words per minute! Watch for two insider jokes -- ""he looks a lot like that movie actor, Ralph Bellamy"" and Grant's reference to a fellow going by Grant's birth name, Archie Leach. There was more than one version of the DVD on sale on Amazon, and this was the cheaper of the two. Quality was fine.",1517270400,,773,4.48936170212766

1018954,5,6305416192,"Just finished watching ""His Girl Friday"" and ""The Front Page"" released by Columbia Pictures as part of The Criterion Collection.
Director Howard Hawks, who is perhaps best known for directing the original ""The Thing,"" breathed new life into this screwball comedy by making it a ""remarriage"" comedy.  In a stroke of genius, Hawks changed the gender of Hildy Johnson from a man to a woman and cast Rosalind Russell in the role, alongside Cary Grant as her former husband/editor Walter Burns.
""His Girl Friday"" has its origins in the smash hit Broadway play ""The Front Page,"" that was written and former newspaper men Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur.
The pre-code Hollywood version of ""The Front Page"" is extremely interesting - not only for its snappy banter, but for the suggestion that there is a relationship between Hildy and Walter.  The bar they go to to have a few rounds is suspiciously devoid of any women, and Hildy passively downs the shots Walter keeps pouring him.  There is even a curious scene near the end when Hildy's future wife tells Walter that he's queer, but all right.
In ""His Girl Friday,"" the snappy banter between the scheming Burns (Grant) and Hildy {Russell) makes it for a fast paced dark comedy which eschews journalism and the never ending news cycle - as did ""The Front Page"" before it.
Both films are a must watch!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Having seen this movie multiple times over forty years, its timeliness seems even more prescient now, in this age of YouTube sages vs the traditional media. The muck raking seems too familar to be relegated to the fog of time. Well worth reviewing today.

1019086,5,6305416192,"This movie is always a joy to watch Rosalind Russell steals the movie and Carry Grant is the perfect foil for her. As far back as I can remember I have been a fan of old B&W movies! I have always had a crush on Rosalind Russell when I saw her in No Time for Comedy (1940) with Jimmy Stewart. I always thought that Carry Grant and Rosalind Russell had such chemistry and had such a witty racy repartee that made me want them to be in more movies! For America in the 1940s Rosalind Russell character Hildy Johnson was way ahead of her time, she was a 1980s woman in a time warp. Smart, Sexy and able to keep men in check, if you know what I mean. The character is a woman that both men and women are enamored with. To women, she is that strong woman who is smarter, wittier, and more talented than the men around her. To men she is an incredibly beautiful woman who can keep up with anything a man does, she is the Smart, Sexy and oh so desirable with her witty banter! Even though in 1940, this might have been deemed as a threat to most men. Personally, as a Gen-Xer I think it is ridiculous to believe that all men would be threatened by such a hot sexy woman like Hildy Johnson in the 1940s!  Russell, who was very much like her character in the movie in many ways, paved the way for other career women roles in the 1940s, which was a character that she in particular perfected to the point of being typecast in future movies.

As for my Overall review, its an enjoyable movie and was of fair quality to watch as an old B&W movie that was streaming on a tablet. I own this movie on VHS and I have downloaded it on the way home from work so I have yet to put it up on a larger viewing screen. Picture quality is an issue when watch old B&W on our modern high def. equipment but I really don't mind its the story and content that I love so much about this movie.",1494115200,4,1862,4.057065217391305

Although it has a certain vintage charm, I find the main characters cold, selfish, and unappealing. Everything is subordinated to their desires, and serious subjects like murder and attempted suicide are carelessly brushed aside.  In a way, that is the point of the movie - the introduction  basically says ""This is about cold-hearted newspaper people,"" - but, since they get everything they want in the end, I don't think that it makes any interesting points about them.",1481673600,2,618,4.738317757009346

The story moves along, only found one or two of the bit players a bit over-the-top in their characterizations - but from other movies of the time with these same actors, that was how they played it.  And, you have to realize this is the 1930's when women worked in jobs like this until they got married and had children, so Hildy dreaming of the white picket fence and a husband who came home for supper each night was something to attain.

Although famous among researchers of dialogue for having an average of 240 words per minute of dialogue (more than twice the average for a movie), the real reason to watch is that every word counts, creating a tapestry of characters and motives that would probably have been spun into at least a mini-series in the more modern movie world, perhaps even into a franchise of ""His Girl {friday|saturday|sunday|...}""

Although officially a romance (and starring the heartthrob male lead of that era), it is really about two people who love their work and love working together.  It is so clearly about work instead of romance that the remake (Front Page) had no troubles from switching the lead reporter to a male role.",1474934400,3,777,4.827067669172933

1020270,5,6305416192,"There had been fast comedies before, like 'Bringing Up Baby' (also directed by Hawks), but 'His Girl Friday' puts the genre right into the 1940s: not only is it extremely fast-paced, with dialogue like battling machine guns, it's also remarkably cynical and sinister, using a background story of a man convicted to death during time of elections. There's something fishy about that story, which is woven surprisingly intricately with the main story, in which newspaper man Walter Burns (Cary Grant) goes at lengths to win back his ex-wife Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) and to stop her from marrying an insurance man next day. Burns tries every scam in the business, from false checks, via a con man robbing his rival to counterfeit money. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are electrifying together, Russell playing a particularly strong and independent woman. Cliff Edwards has as small role, and Billy Gilbert shines as the minor, yet important character Joe Pettibone. It's a shame Rosalind Russell isn't more well-known, as she absolutely dominates the film, showing a range of emotions from the deepest sarcasm to the most innocent glee.",1471824000,11,1143,5.183783783783784

I almost always turn on subtitles when I watch a flick- couldn't with this one, and that was really annoying considering how bad the sound was.

So - even though this one has the misleading cover of looking as if it has perhaps been coloized - it is actually by far the easiest on eyes accustomed to 2015 levels of resolution -- and even though it has used a fiarly inexpensive re-digitizing process that increases the grain - it's still much easier to watch.

speaking of the varying levels of quality in the transfer of this film - which remains, to this Columbia Journalism School graduate - the greatest and still most accurate of all films made about American reporting - THIS COVER IS THE ONLY HD VERSION FOR STREAMING.  why this one, I have no idea - but the other two are blurry low-resolution that look like a remnant from the first VHS transfer, while this one has been cleaned up digitally and had its line count enhanced - even though whatever process they used increased the grain, and can't be compared to, say, any of the Criterion remasterings of black and white classics - it's still much easier on 2015 eyes than the other two. So this is the one to choose, even with its color photograph cover which hints of a colorized version - it is not. It's black-and-white.

1022092,3,6305416192,"I've heard enough talk about His Girl Friday that I knew at some point I had to watch it.  And a showing on Turner Classic Movies provided the perfect opportunity for me to take in this classic.  I'd like to say I loved it, but I did have some problems with it.

Walter Burns (Cary Grant) is the editor of a New York paper.  His top reporter is Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell), who also happens to be his ex-wife.  Hildy has been on leave since their divorce, and she breezes back into town to tell Walter that she is about to marry a man named Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy) and move to Albany.  Walter doesn't take this lying down, however, and soon convinces Hildy to write one last story.

Seems that tomorrow is the execution of Earl Williams (John Qualen), a man convicted of murder.  The psychologists have determined that he is sane, but Walter thinks the man has been railroaded.  He offers Hildy a chance to do a final interview, prove the man insane, and save a life.

Hildy can hardly pass that up, so she begins the interview. Walter, meanwhile, is doing his best to sabotage things so she will miss her train to Albany.  Will Earl be spared from the noose?  Will Hildy leave town?

I've got to admit to have a weird feeling at times as I was watching the film.  I know I have never seen this movie before, but many of the scenes seemed familiar.  I'm talking dialog, actors, camera angles, everything.  I'm willing to bet I've seen those scenes in specials and documentaries over the years.  Enough was new that I know I hadn't seen it before.

The movie starts well enough.  We pretty much jump right into the story, learning about our characters as we go.  As the movie progresses, we get some pretty wild situations that are certainly funny.

In a technique not used much in those days, the dialog is often rapid fire, sometimes with the actors talking over themselves.  When those scenes come, you do need to really pay attention to follow everything happening.  The movie knows when it needs those scenes and when it needs to pull back and allow the characters quiet times to truly develop.

I've got to give the actors credit, they handled the entire material very well.  They might not have been used to the insane pace and overlap of the movie, but they don't show it.  And they switch from frantic paced to slower with ease.

Since this movie is from 1940, it comes as no surprise that it was filmed in black and white.  After a minute or two, I forgot I wasn't watching a modern, color movie.

This is equal parts romantic comedy and political/newspaper story.  And it's the romantic comedy part where I had problems with the movie.  For starters, I didn't like Walter at all.  The guy is a jerk, and Hildy could have done so much better.  Both the romance and the murder stories are predictable at times, proving that formula was used just as much back then as it is now.  But what really bothered me was the ending of the romantic story.  It felt forced and way too abrupt for my tastes.

The movie is based on a play and an earlier movie (remakes are nothing new either) called The Front Page.  In that version, Hildy is a man, so it obviously leaves out the romantic plot.  Frankly, I think that explains a lot of my problems with the romance here.  It feels forced into the story most of the time.  If they wanted to include it here, they needed to incorporate it better during the script stage.

His Girl Friday is a good movie up until the last few minutes.  If you feel the need to watch this classic, you won't be completely disappointed.  But to truly be a classic, it needs to be better developed all along.",1432080000,,3642,4.429864253393665

Remastered, it was more enjoyable to watch Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, and the rest of the cast work their magic in this Howards Hawks' finely crafted film. Ahead of it's time, the film showcases a tough, independent female newspaper reporter investigating a complex homicide case. Every character is presented as a believable, gritty, realized person. Although the antics between Grant and Russell are high comedy, this film is complex enough to delve into divorce, cut throat newspaper competition, politics, and the insanity defense. It's quite a plate full and the snappily delivered dialogue sounds as fresh today as it did in 1940.",1428451200,11,787,5.253968253968254

1022754,4,6305416192,"His Girl Friday is a screwball comedy with witty banter and Altman-style overlapping dialogue; in short, it's a gem.

Chicago-based newspaper editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant) contacts his ex-wife Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) and calls her into his office. She used to write for the paper before they broke up, and he wants her to come back, even stating his intentions to win her back and re-marry her. She makes it clear that she has no interest in writing for the paper again and is engaged to be married (the wedding is the next day). He asks to meet her fianc, and with some prodding, she complies. When they meet, Walter invites himself to lunch with them (also against her wishes). He makes her an offer she cant refuse: covering a case involving an African-American cop shot by a white man. The suspect is on trial, facing the death penalty.

The film doesnt really care about the case or take sides; it's merely the subtext for Johnson to write for the paper again. Still, it feels a little odd to have a subplot involving capital punishment in a screwball comedy, and there is some racially regressive dialogue that dates and partially damns the film. Grants Morning Post takes the side of the white shooter, an unpopular position in a city with a large African-American population. At lunch, Hildy comments on the case and the position Waters paper is taking by saying, The colored votes very important to this town. FACEPALM.

Despite some reactionary dialogue she has to work with, Russell gives a fabulous performance and truly carries the film; Grant is as charming as ever, but she has even more screen time than he does. She and Grant have palpable chemistry, a rare sight on screen in the era of Hays Code cinematic sexual repression. In a way, the film is the opposite of Casablanca; though both are excellent films from roughly the same era, hardship brings old lovers together in this film in a way that it tore them apart in Michael Curtiz masterpiece.

Nothing in this film is plausible. Hildy wouldnt come into Walters office, especially not the day before her wedding, and she wouldnt let Walter have lunch with her soon-to-be husband or allow herself to write for the paper again, even if she was offered a big story. It doesnt much matter, though. Films like these are complete WWII-era escapism, meant to entertain and distract audiences, and it succeeds in spades on that level.

The film may seem very formulaic and cookie-cutter to contemporary audiences, but after seeing countless romantic comedies inspired by films like this and It Happened One Night, it can be easy to forget just how novel and revolutionary these films were in their time. This film doesnt follow the formula; the film largely MADE the formula. This formula has since been done to death, but its rarely been done this well.",1421539200,,2830,4.779141104294479

HIS GIRL FRIDAY is an energetic remake of the MacArthur/Hecht play ""The Front Page,"" with Rosalind Russell as star reporter Hildy Johnson and Cary Grant playing her boss and ex-husband, Walter Burns. Hildy's plans to quit her job, remarry and move elsewhere are put on hold so she can work on the hottest story in years: the escape of a condemned prisoner. Meanwhile, Walter tries to figure a way to get his ex-wife and best employee back.

Certainly the fastest-paced version of this comedy, its machine-gun speed dialogue often has three characters speaking simultaneously. With added whimsy from Grant's direct references to both Bellamy and himself (he mentions his own real name, Archie Leach). Having Walter and Hildy as a divorced couple is the smartest twist of all. It's a classic in every sense!

I had read the reviews and didn't expect much, but I thought since I am a casual film fan, and not a serious one, it wouldn't matter, but I have VHS tapes that are better quality than this DVD.  It is grainy, noisy (background buzzing and snaps), and you can barely hear the actors!  I wish TCM would lovingly do a transfer of this great film, because I am willing to spend the money.

But as it uses to happen, nothing is written until the out 27, and so, a series of unexpected events will make this decision delays.

Meanwhile, in the universe of the headlines everything changes minute to minute and so, the second plot will bring us corruption, hipocrisy and acidic comments about the journalism as profession.

Everything is out of control, and bellow this messy state of things will lead to a happy ending.

Since its release, this amusing film became a cult film. Anyway, purchase it and enjoy a good time with a fast-paced script and splendid cast.",1406678400,,756,4.890625

However, the change of genders for the Hildy Johnson character and it permutations as a love interest (past and present) for Walter Burns is an inspired variation on the original.

Rapid-fire, over-lapping dialog and an excellent cast (featuring a host of character actors from Hollywood's Golden Age and studio system) make this excellent viewing.  A true treat for movie buffs.",1397088000,,543,5.067415730337078

1024074,3,6305416192,"I was surprised how much this movie felt like ""Philadelphia Story"" but not as enchanting. I was just not convinced at the end.

1940 topics: Reds, European war as a side note.

Makes fun of everybody: politicians, newspaper men, mother-in-laws, you name it.

Lots of snappy dialog, but very fast.  You have to pay attention.  But the timing was off to me.  Many times people would pick up a phone, say ""give me Burt"" then start talking to Burt 1 second later.

Worth watching but  I won't want to see it again (unlike ""Philadelphia Story"" that I have seed at least 10 times).",1396569600,,575,4.514563106796117

1024528,5,6305416192,"If you have any enjoyment of old movies buy this one. Simple as that. It is a classic, with all the ingredients we love in the films of the 40s.
Grant and Russell have excellent chemistry. The pace is lightening fast, even for a current audience accustomed to split second images. The dialog is witty and smart, even if the premise is a bi 1940's lame. But thats not the point of the film. The point is the dialog, the banter between the two is astonishing, unrelenting, intelligent, and I dare you not to hear something new each time you watch it.
A couple of crappy remakes were made, even a TV sitcom, but nothing compares to the original. In fact the remakes are so different you may not even recognize them as such.
Get this movie, it is a masterpiece in comedy and full of zingers that are smart even today.",1379462400,,813,4.355263157894737
1024529,4,6305416192,"I suppose  the world could use a laugh, could use getting away from the bummer daily headlines anytime and anyplace and hide for a couple of hours in the cinematic world, a world where the funny can be therapy for the ailments of the day. Probably in the time of the film under review, His Girl Friday a female-centered newspaper story variation on the original story, The Front Page, a time when the world was stirring out of the Great Depression and the flames of war were enveloping Europe and the Far East the need for such relief was as important as any other time. And the flamboyant newspaper publisher played by Cary Grant and the feisty newspaper reporter played by Rosalind Russell delivered using all the comedic skills at their command.

Now the story line, the hot-cold love between Grant and Russell who have divorced, well, divorced over the differences in perspective about what married life was about for two working professionals, overlaid by the big news story of the day, the upcoming execution of a harmless Walter Mitty-type for murdering a police officer, is not what drives this one. Nor is it the witty take on governmental corruption and incompetent, the sensationalism of the media, or the current events of the day. It is the strangely inviting repartee between Grant and Russell as the debonair Grant tries to persuade the reluctant Russell to do one last story, the career-making big one on the execution, before setting off into the sunset to that white house with picket fence, a couple of kids and a dog in,ah, Albany. The patter between the pair as Grant works his charm and Russell comes to realize that she is a hell of newspaperman (today news reporter) is what provides the laughs as they, at times, seem to be working their lines overreach other. Grant, known later more for his suave romantic leads with the likes of Grace Kelly, is right at home in this screw-ball comedy milieu, as is Russell, and so will you.",1379203200,,1952,4.721407624633431

1024531,1,6305416192,"Others have pointed out the brilliant comedic lines and zippy overlapping dialogue.  Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant are an absolute match.  You will love this movie provided that you are fixated only on these two characters - and not on the background invisible prop.

The prop is a person.  His name is Bruce Baldwin.  He lives in Albany.  All he wanted was a life with a woman he thought loved him.  She never did.  Miss Johnson and Mr. Burns play poor Bruce like a sucker.  When Bruce complains to his fiance, she does much worse than treat him badly.  She does not hear a word he says.  He is beneath notice.  The filmmakers feel the same way.  Poor Bruce's life is shattered.  He even asks Hildy if she ever loved him at all.  She is too busy with her story to answer.  At the end of the movie Hildy admits that she brought Bruce to Walter Burns in order to get Burns to pursue her.  That is all right for the movie's protagonists.  What about the movie's prop - Bruce Baldwin?  As I said - one will love this movie as long as one doesn't think about what is actually happening.  I'll say one thing for this movie.  It proves that Cary Grant can play a convincing monster.",1378598400,3,1178,4.3119266055045875

One of the interesting bits of trivia is that Cary Grant  mocks his real name at one point in the movie.  Listen carefully, can you pick it out?!

1024682,5,6305416192,"This 1940 movie is the filming of a screenplay by Charles Lederer, adapted from the 1928 play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. In that original, the character named Hildy Johnson is a man, whereas here Hildy is none other than Rosalind Russell, who has considerably more screen time than Cary Grant and holds down the show marvelously. This is every inch a strange dark comedy, much of it filmed on a single setwith the attendant exits, entries, hidden characters, and telling silencesa press room literally overlooking a gallows, where a man who might be innocent, or who might not, is going to be hanged come dawn. The complete absence of anything resembling absolute truth in this narrative is compelling, and in fact it compels Hildy so much that she continually struggles to escape its pull, into the world she so much wants, one of home and children with the boring insurance salesman Ralph Bellamy, a great and subdued straight man here. Grant is outstanding of course, though strange to report acts in a broadly comic fashion, so much that we expect him to do the back-flips we know hes capable of. Much of Grants performance, perhaps incidentally to most viewers, is well understood to be ""winking"" at his own homosexuality, very much in the proto-Warholian style of Hawks. There has always been a vein of the hyper-modern in Hawks. In a bit of post-modernist self-referentiality, Grant even says about Hildy's fianc ""He looks like that fellow in the movies - Ralph Bellamy."" But all this aside, His Girl Friday is one of Hawks' most entertaining films, though many will find the conclusion, and Hildy's ultimate behavior, not exactly a great fit with today's norms of what constitutes the excellence of the feminine. In His Girl Friday, everything is relative, and all motion is circularalways orbital and unfree. But there we go again, analyzing to death what most will agree is a terrific, fast-paced newsroom comedy-drama, well worth viewing, not just once but twice, and that is justly celebrated as a classic. But consider this: Any great comedy is always about things that arewell, not so funny.",1372377600,,2114,4.92436974789916

Ok, so I've seen Wilder's 1974 film and liked it more than most, but it never really sat comfortably with me as `the film it could have been'.  The material is so ripe and yet the film had this filmy `un-eventfulness' that corroded what could have been absolute perfection.  Like I said, I liked it more than most and yet I still recognize that something was off, despite a killer cast and director.  Then I saw `His Girl Friday' (a film I was unaware was based off the same stage play) and it all clicked.

Hildy NEEDS to be a woman.

It is funny to think that a mere gender change can make all the difference, but the same dialog spouted between ex-lovers makes a much broader impact, and it doesn't hurt that the chemistry created contains a stiffer upper-cut.  Lemmon and Matthau make a great team, don't get me wrong, and they built on that chemistry for years, but there is something about the way that Russell and Grant spar off one another that is otherworldly.

The film centers on Hildy, a newspaper reporter who is reporting to her boss, her ex-husband Walter, with her resignation.  She is quitting the newspaper business and getting married.  Walter isn't going to take this lying down.  Not only is he still infatuated with his ex-wife, but she is his best reporter, and he isn't about to lose her.  So, he manipulates the situation to get her to stay for one last report, and once she's been bitten by the bug she has a very hard time walking away.  As the situation spins out of control thanks to circumstances beyond all control, these two are forced to reevaluate what it is that they want from each other and their lives; and their careers.

I find it baffling that this was ignored entirely by Oscar.  Not only is Rosalind Russell Oscar worthy here, but Grant is also at the top of his game, and the sensationally written dialog certainly deserved an Oscar nomination.  This is one of those great comedies of times past that deserves all the attention it can get.  One of the best!",1368662400,,2065,4.493297587131368

The film is not without its in-jokes either: Cary Grant as Walter Burns makes a derogatory reference to Ralph Bellamy, when Bellamy himself is standing right opposite him playing Hildy Johnson's (Rosalind Russell's) luckless fiance Bruce Baldwin.  On another occasion Grant makes reference to Archie Leach, which was his real name.

1025256,4,6305416192,"fabulous dialogue.  Fine acting.  A perfect example of the quick witted humor of the 30s,  before there were cell phones and everything was abbreviated.

clever and fun repartee,  though a bit overwhelming at times.  The actors seem to know they are cute... but except for those moments Miss Russell hits the mark and sets the standard for the hard nosed new woman of the 30's. ( pre war 40s..)
The story...  divorced couple still in love,  but she is heading for the suburbs with an unsuspecting protestant insurance salesman,  and He,  the editor of a newspaper,  is not about to let her go without a fight.  He tricks and maims
and upsets the happy apple cart,  using characters of unsavory remark,  and employing every dirty trick to exhaust the husband ( and his mother)  before they can board that train for HappyeverAfterville..  Meanwhile someones life is at stake,
a man has murdered a policeman.  Here is where the story takes on an unexpected complexity.  This mild mannered unemployed sadsack has not only shot a policeman - but a black policeman - they emphasize - and you know what that
means.  Liberals will be lining up to have him killed. Why?  To keep the black - I mean 'colored' vote.  Colored in these decades was a term used by hipper white folks who,  while surely racists,  did not want to be so.  It felt the least degrading.
So you hear a complaint about a black man who has been killed and a white man who will be killed in return - because he is black!  and you know how we aren't allowing any black folks to get killed right now.  I mean it goes by so
fast but it,  while maybe appearing to be honest,  is downright racist and frightenly so.  Then the socialist stuff.  This out of work killer would just walk around in the rain in the park,  he was hungry,  sad, lonely.  He'd been fired after
a lifetime.  And he hears a speech about everything must have a use.  And then he has the gun in his hand and...  IT seems that there was probably a lot of socialize propaganda going on at the time,  i get that impression by the easy
reference to things that no longer seem clear.  So I like this complexity,  especially since on the surface it just seems to be a comedy of no particular merit except for the fabulous rhythm of the writing and the beautiful spirits of Rosalind Russell
and Cary Grant.

Culmination-  the news room above the gallows...with the various scribes,  their phones and their garters,  who care about no one and nothing but the story,  playing cards waiting for the execution.  Our lady journalists stops by
and so does the lady witness who had tried to do the poor sap a good turn and take him in...only to be slandered in the press  by mocking innuendo.  The sad,  tiny killer hiding in the rolltop desk,  an effeminate writer who, when he offers to come to her wedding Russell quips  ( you can be the bridesmaid..) and the irascible orchestrator of this rondo,  Cary Grant,  handsome enough to carry the scene when the dialogue is to exhausting to stay with.  All this goes by without blinking an eye, no reactions,  just hit after hit,  its operatic,  really..  Then enters the ignoramous messenger and the corruption is revealed..... A  Capra-esque stew of Shakespear proportions written in the gritty street style of the 30's.  I love
this movie. And,  in the hands of Howard Hawks,  it is a classic of its kind.

205us His Girl Friday (Howard Hawks, 1940, 92')

Produced by Howard Hawks.
Written by Charles Lederer, Ben Hecht, Charles MacArthur.
Starring Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, Ralph Bellamy, Gene Lockhart.
Music by Sidney Cutner, Felix Mills. Cinematography by Joseph Walker.
Editing by Gene Havlick. Distributed by Columbia Pictures.

American screwball comedy: A newspaper editor uses every trick in the book to keep his ace reporter ex-wife from remarrying. The change in this version is that the role of Hildy Johnson was converted from male to female.

His Girl Friday was originally supposed to be a straightforward adaptation of The Front Page, with both the editor and reporter being men. But during auditions, Howard Hawks's secretary read reporter Hildy Johnson's lines. Hawks liked the way the dialogue sounded coming from a woman, resulting in the script being rewritten to make Hildy female and the ex-wife of editor Walter Burns. Most of the original dialogue and all of the characters' names (with the exception of Bruce Baldwin, Hildy's fiance, who was of course a woman in the play) were left the same.

Hawks had a very difficult time casting this film. While the choice of Cary Grant was almost instantaneous, the casting of Hildy was a far more extended process. Hawks finally turned to Rosalind Russell, who was annoyed that she was not his first choice. During filming, Russell noticed that Hawks treated her like an also-ran, so she confronted him: ""You don't want me, do you? Well, you're stuck with me, so you might as well make the most of it.""

The film is noted for its rapid-fire repartee, using overlapping dialogue to make conversations sound more realistic, with one character speaking before another finishes. Although overlapping dialog is specified and cued in the 1928 play script by Hecht and MacArthur. Grant's character describes Bellamy's character by saying ""He looks like that fellow in the movies, you know...Ralph Bellamy!"" According to Bellamy, the remark was ad libbed by Grant. Columbia studio head Harry Cohn thought it was too cheeky and ordered it removed, but Hawks insisted that it stay. Grant makes several other ""inside"" remarks in the film.

1025413,5,6305416192,"HIS GIRL FRIDAY has been one of those rare treats I have missed out on until now. The title always made me think Cary Grant was a businessman and Rosalind Russell his secretary. Far from it. Grant is Walter Burns and he runs a newspaper. Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) is not only his ex-wife but his star reporter. No one can cover a story better than Hildy.

Hildy shows up to announce she is leaving town to marry a man a mild-mannered Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy) with a domineering wife. Her reporting days will give way to a life as a housewife. Of course, no one can believe that Hildy will be satisfied away from her reporting days.

 I had recently seen THE AWFUL TRUTH and was immediately reminded of the similarities. Grant again is an annoying, lout with a mouth that keeps running. In that film his soon to be ex-wife is going to marry a mild-mannered man with a domineering mother AGAIN played by Ralph Bellamy. Fortunately, the similarities end there. Enter Rosalind Russell as the dedicated reporter about to give up her career to be Mrs. Bruce Baldwin. Hildy Johnson is a strong character who is well aware of  Burns's less than honorable scruples that keep ending Bruce in jail.

The film seemed so to start and then I began to see the charm in the story. The crispt, fast-pace dialogue that sometimes never seems to end. Grant seems to always be talking over another character and we all know people like this. Hildy is tricked into covering one last story-a convicted murdered is about to be executed. There is hope of a reprieve. Hildy and the other reporters are at the prison in a room that overlooks the execution site. Things don't go as planned and Hildy becomes much more involved that she ever expects.

Here is a fine film where the female lead is a strong and strong character. She holds her on against the charms of Cary Grant and he allows her to be independent and actually appreciates her talents as a reporter. Of course, it seems like a career woman of the 30's and 40's can never go out in public without an elaborate hat. Those were the days, I guess! The hats are another charm of this film.

Don't miss a couple of subtle comedic lines in the film. Grant is one the phone and mentions a thug called Arhcie Leach (His real name). He is later asked to describe Bruce Baldwin (played by Ralph Bellamy) and describes him as a looking like that famous actor Bruce Bellamy. Nice humorous touch.

I always think of Howard Hawks as a director of action films. Here he showed his talents in a romantic comedy. The story we changed from the original FRONT PAGE version. Hildy not only is a woman this time but she is the boss's ex-wife. The film is a total charmer and I can clearly see why it is so well respected and beloved. They don't make them like this anymore.",1333324800,,2800,4.476470588235294

Grant's character begins to try and sabotage the relationship by pulling Russel's character back into the newspaper game with a juicy story. Russel's character is resistant at first but later on you see she's in denial that getting married and having kids may not be the best choice for her. Rapidfire dialogue reigns supreme. Nice interplay between the two love interests as they finish lines for each other showing how well they know each other. Reporters have their fast talking sarcastic cynical dialogue as well.  Ironically Rosalind Russel was not a top choice for this role. She resented it during the production and actually hired her own script writer to do some of her own lines to make her a more active character. In 2002 the AFI gave this film a ranking of number 19 in 100 Films, 100 Laughs. This was based on a play titled FRONT PAGE and the Hildy Johnson character was a male in that presentation. I am not a fan of screwball comedies, per se, so this is a high grade for me.

HIS GIRL FRIDAY is an energetic remake of the MacArthur/Hecht play ""The Front Page,"" with Rosalind Russell as star reporter Hildy Johnson and Cary Grant playing her boss and ex-husband, Walter Burns. Hildy's plans to quit her job, remarry and move elsewhere are put on hold so she can work on the hottest story in years: the escape of a condemned prisoner. Meanwhile, Walter tries to figure a way to get his ex-wife and best employee back.

Certainly the fastest-paced version of this comedy, its machine-gun speed dialogue often has three characters speaking simultaneously. With added whimsy from Grant's direct references to both Bellamy and himself (he mentions his own real name, Archie Leach). Having Walter and Hildy as a divorced couple is the smartest twist of all. It's a classic in every sense!

1026042,4,6305416192,"The introduction says this picture has no resemblance to the men and women of the press today. [Really? Do people still think a Hollywood film is reality?] This was adapted from the famous play ""The Front Page"", a parody of Chicago and the press of the 1920s. The film opens on a newspaper office from decades past. A reporter tells the Editor of her plans, they discuss their past. Hildy is getting married and will quit journalism. What will Walter do? A sneaky trick? Hildy wants a normal life. Does life insurance help people? [Does this chatter slow down the film?] Will the editor exploit a death sentence to sell newspapers? Or other sensational news of an unexpected death? [Yes, its what people want.]

The condemned man will be checked by an alienist. The reporters wait in the newsroom. They tell what happened. [Does unemployment cause more crime?] Hildy Johnson knows how to get an interview? Will she create a story? ""Production for use."" Will reporters make up a story? Are they cynical? Is Molly too emotional? [But it makes good drama. This story mocks government as much as newspapers.] But an event changes Hildy's mind: Earl Williams escaped! Walter Burns is terribly tricky. So too the Mayor. ""I can fix anything."" There is a dramatic surprise! The film picks up when the original story is used. Will the story be played to influence the election? Hildy can't give up the excitement of her job. Is there anyone who won't be double-crossed by Walter Burns?

The highpoint is the recapture of Earl Williams. Each reporter files a different version of the capture. Who can you believe? Then the courier with the reprieve shows up; this changes everything. Walter Burns' scheme with the money causes more trouble for Bruce Baldwin. Hildy relents, she returns to the excitement of her job (and her old marriage?). [Was this ending required by the movie code or censorship?] I think the 1975 version of this play was better than this film. Was it modified for changing tastes?

The real Walter N. Burns was a newspaper editor who wrote a biography of `Billy the Kid' in 1926 that presented him as a popular hero to some of the people of New Mexico. Previously he was always shown as a dangerous killer. Robert M. Utley's book is the complete biography.",1251504000,,2267,4.763358778625954

Cary Grant never won an oscar even though he deserved several, this movie being one of those foremost.  His Girl Friday is about a newspaper man who puts his work first no matter what.  Even when it comes to losing his wife, played by Rosalind Russell.  He plays this character to a tee.  His almost over the top acting is what makes this movie great.  It has a Groucho Marx feel to it that you will see in the first scene when his estranged wife shows up to tell him she is marrying another man.  He proclaims ""Well Hello Hildy"" and the character is defined.

Of course it helps that the two stars were Cary Grant, arguably the greatest of all comedic actors in early Hollywood, and Rosalind Russell, an actress borrowed from another studio but may very well be the only one who could have pulled this part off. The dialog also works as something of true genius. Charles Lederer adapted the play, but it is really Hawks that deserves the credit as he was open to allowing virtually any type of spontaneous idea or improvisation to further improve the story.

With Howard Hawks in the director's chair and Cary Grant in the lead role, you're pretty much guaranteed to have a good time. His Girl Friday isn't the first or last film adaptation of the 1928 play The Front Page, but it is easily the best. This thing comes at you a mile a minute, with dialogue that starts out at break-neck speed and never slows down and more humorous moments than you can find time to laugh at. It's an unusual romantic comedy, given the fact that Cary Grant's character is a little less than noble (he is a rather ruthless newspaper man, after all) and the nice guy in the picture is lucky to finish at all, but there's still something endearing about the whole relationship between Walter Burns (Grant) and his former ace reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell), who also happens to be his ex-wife (in earlier adaptations of the story, Hildy was just a darn good male reporter). Hildy is due to get married in less than 24 hours, and Burns is desperate to win her back - for the newspaper as well as himself. The big city proves most cooperative in his endeavors, with a corrupt sheriff and mayor getting set to hang a ""dangerous"" little man for murder in order to bolster their bids for reelection in three days. And that's only the beginning of this screwball comedy story. This battle of the sexes turns into one of the most impressive battles of wits the big screen has ever seen, and the whole wild and crazy story makes for an extraordinary experience.",1217030400,5,1889,4.505847953216374

I mean, yeah, OK, Cary Grant DOES manage to get Rosalind Russell to revert back to her old newspaper ways, in spite of her initial adamant refusal to do so...but she really does it cause it's in her blood, not because good old Cary is a dominating type. She's NOT his girl Friday; she's her own person. Dig the Abe Lincoln stovepipe hat--nice touch. Newspaper people are honest. Yep, of course they are.

You can't get dialogue more whip smart, faster, and witter than this. It's just not possible, thanks to Billy Wilder, co-writer. While stuff like My Favorite Brunette and Nothing Sacred may have their occasional guffaws, His Girl Friday is so fast and furious you don't have time to guffaw--just marvel and laugh constantly at the amazing display of language fireworks, and the two leads who pull these fireworks off absolutely flawlessly. NOBODY else could have been cast in these two lead roles, NOBODY. Grant and Russell are PERFECT.

One of the best American movies of the 40s and my vote for one of the best American comedies period.",1215388800,2,1080,4.73936170212766
1026195,5,6305416192,"Howard Hawks was responsible for a lot of outstanding movies, like ""The Big Sleep"" and ""Bringing Up Baby.""

But one of his best was wild, witty screwball comedy ""His Girl Friday,"" which has never quite gotten the same recognition as those better known films. It has razor-sharp, bullet-fast dialogue, a hilarious plot and Cary Grant as (once more) a divorced man who won't give up so easily. You'll never look at a rolltop desk the same way again.

Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) comes into her ex-husband's newspaper office. Walter (Cary Grant) is ready to give her her old job -- until she announces that she's marrying a nice, dull insurance agent (Ralph Bellamy). Walter insists that Hildy can't just go to Albany and be a housewife, and she insists that that's exactly what she wants.

So the wily ex bribes Hildy to cover a sensational cop-killing case -- the convicted man is scheduled to be executed in the morning -- and takes the opportunity to make life difficult for her fiancee. Now Hildy tries to get the facts behind the cop-shooting, while battling with a corrupt mayor who wants the convicted man dead. Is the sordid world of journalism -- and Walter -- what Hildy really wants? Looks like it.

Sometimes even if people don't get along, they fit so perfectly that trying to get together with someone else is pointless -- just look at Shakespeare's Beatrice and Benedick. Personally I've never experienced that kind of love (yet), but I've seen couples who do work the way Hildy and Walter do. Howard Hawks captures the feel of such couples perfectly.

In addition to the screwball romance, Hawks mixes in a cop-killing, a prison break, an attempted suicide, a conspiracy for mayoral votes, and a lot of reporters slavering for a hit story. It's a tight, taut little story peppered with humor, like the convict in the roll-top desk, or Bellamy's imperious mother being dragged out of the building.

Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell have electric chemistry in this movie, from the first scene right to the finale. It's a shame that they apparently didn't collaborate on any other movies, because in terms of comedy skill, they fit as snugly as two pieces of a puzzle -- they jabber together, trade fast barbs, and lob insults that don't pierce each other's skin.

Their dialogue is as fast as their wits: ""I wish you hadn't done that, Hildy."" ""Done what?"" ""Divorced me. It makes a man feel he's not wanted!"" And on the sidelines, Bellamy has an amusing role as the rather slow-witted fiancee whom Grant charms and then gets arrested. Interestingly, Bellamy played the same role in ""Awful Truth,"" another Grant movie about a divorced guy trying to win his ex-wife...

""His Girl Friday"" is one of those classic movies that leaves you with a warm glow and a cynical chuckle. Hilarious from start to finish, especially with Grant and Russell.",1213315200,,2854,4.810204081632653
1026196,5,6305416192,"ESSENTIAL MOVIE!!! Cary Grant was a comedic genius with near impeccable timing. Rosalind Russell was perfect counterpoint. The repartee between the two is fast, furious & witty. The director Howard Hawks put together one of the best comedies ever committed to film! Grant & Russell were married but now divorced before the movie starts. He's the editor of a newspaper & she's the ace reporter. They can't stand each other but they're the perfect team.

This is considered to be of the screwball comedy version but there's so much intelligent stuff going on it's hard to consider it screwball. Hawks decided to give the film a fast pacing; many times Grant & Russell (among others) are all talking at the same time. His Girl Friday was one of the first films to take this approach. There's never a dull or slow moment in the movie. If ever there was a film that could be the perfect comedy this one is it. There are some inside jokes, the best one involving Ralph Bellamy. This movie's pacing is so fast it demands to be seen more than one time. One of Hollywood's most entertaining movies of all time!",1210723200,2,1101,4.61734693877551
1026197,2,6305416192,"Unlike your earlier screwball comedy movies, this one has a little dark edge to it as it covers issues such as the death penalty for innocent people and police and government corruption.  For its time, it was also unique in that the female lead was treated somewhat as an equal with her other male colleagues which we take for granted today but was unheard of in 1940.  As far as screwball comedies go, I wouldn't call this the best one I've seen as that accolade would have to go to ""My Man Godfrey"" or perhaps ""The Thin Man"" but this movie while not coming close to the standard of these two is still entertaining.

The problem with this DVD though is the poor video quality although the sound quality isn't that bad if you have a system with Dolby Pro Logic which simulates surround sound and yet the hissing is still noticeable.  The picture quality is riddled with imperfections and it may be a good idea to wait for a properly restored version to come out or maybe Blu-Ray?  The Biography - Cary Grant On Film was entertaining but it isn't the best biopic on the man that I've seen.  For that you would have to see the special features for the 2-Disc version of ""Bringing Up Baby"" which by the way is also a much better movie than this one.  The jokes on ""His Girl Friday"" while they may have been funny 68 years ago have not aged very well and despite the quick dialogue, I guess living in this extremely fast paced society today, I didn't think it was that extraordinary either.  Believe me people in Singapore speak just as fast or even faster as a matter of course.  As far as screwball comedy with jokes that are still funny today go, I'd recommend ""My Man Godfrey"", ""The Thin Man"" and ""Bringing Up Baby"" ahead of this one and in that order.  By the way, the Tony Curtis intro does nothing for the disc and I'm not sure what exactly his input had to do with improving the overall enjoyment of the disc as it clearly didn't do that.

Short on special features, okay sound but poor picture quality on humour material that doesn't age well makes me recommend you give this DVD a miss.",1204675200,,2092,4.37984496124031

Both Grant and Russell are in top form, and all we have to do is keep up with them. A rip-roaring good time, start to finish",1182470400,,490,4.9156626506024095
1026457,5,6305416192,"This movie reminds us what movies used to be: fun.

Carey Grant is handsome and debonair (and all that stuff that drove women crazy) and downright evil sometimes in this movie. He is not above twisting arms (men or women's) to get what he wants and needs, but he does it with such charm that most people just follow him. This is a lesson in alpha-male behavior 101. I won't reveal the storyline or any spoilers (I am sure someone has already done that), but instead I ill say that the movie reeks of another era, which wasn't that long ago chronologically. The witty banter and seemingly endless conflict between the main characters drives the movie forward like a roller coaster that threatens to come off of the tracks at any moment.

This is Howard Hawks' brilliance. The director, the actors, even the lighting all work together seamlessly to create this film. The truest beauty of this film I believe was not the way that Hawks was able to entertain men and women equally in this truly romantic comedy (as compared to the trash that passes for ""romantic crap (oops! I mean 'comedy')"" today. It was the way this and other films laid down archetypes to aspire to. Cary Grant wasn't just a good looking guy with money - he was a good looking guy with money and a demonic bent and a razor-sharp tongue that he coated with just enough charm to make the poison work all the better. He had an iron will and was Hell bent on getting his way, and not looking like the bad guy in the process. His counterpart, ""Hildy Johnson"" was his intellectual equal and very sexy, and independent as well. Not the type of woman you would ever get tired of - or bored with.

With characters like this on screen, it became all to easy to imagine that people like that existed somewhere, and that you might get lucky enough to snag one. The characters in this film were not as flat and 2-dimensional as many of the films today, and that is why it stands up so well even though it is shot in black and white, and the actors are long deceased. This is truly a night's worth of great entertainment and a movie *worth* owning, not just viewing.",1176854400,5,2119,4.4282051282051285
1026458,5,6305416192,"This is the 95th review to appear here at Amazon on this movie.  As always, it has proved enlightening to read the preceding writers had to say.  Most of them loved the film, as was wholly predictable.  A goodly number issued dire warnings about the appalling quality of one issue or another, so there is very much a buyer beware factor involved here.  A handful didn't care for the film at all, almost always because thedialogueissofasttheycan'tkeepupwithit.  That ... is ... a ... real ... shame, especially in this era of the fidgety edit, the sound bite and the five-second commercial.

Many, altogether too many, praised director Howard Hawks to the skies for his brilliant story, his brilliant dialogue, his brilliant re-visioning, his brilliant this, his brilliant that.  Now that requires a comment or two.

In the Roaring Twenties, Chicago was the most raffish newspaper town in the world.  Reporters who had seen it all--many, many times--covered Prohibition-era beer wars, gangsters several times bigger than life, crooked politicians, lurid scandals of every conceivable stripe, Red scares, repeated labor strife, mesmerizing mouthpieces who reduced juries to tears in order to save thrill killers from their justly deserved dates with public executioners, and any other mad things that turned up by land, sea or air.  The pop culture of the day was fascinated by it all and two contemporary plays survive into our time to remind us of those hard-charging times: ""Chicago"" and ""The Front Page.""  ""Chicago,"" of course, was a hit play, that became a hit movie (and advanced the career of Ginger Rogers), that became a hit Broadway musical, that became a hit retro-movie musical.

""The Front Page"" was an even bigger hit on stage in its first go-around.  It was written by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur who had served time in the news bullpen at the Chicago City Hall and had finally escaped to write for other venues that were no more respectable but paid a whole lot more money.  Their subject was Hildy Johnson, a reporter on his last day in the bullpen before escaping into the real world and his boss Walter Burns, an amalgamation of every editor who'd ever run a beady eye over Hecht and MacArthur's deathless prose.  I should point out that Hildy Johnson in the play is a man.  The reason for that is ... well, because there actually was a Hildy (short for Hilding) Johnson who happened to be a bullpen reporter at the Chicago City Hall.  Whatever inclination (if such a thing ever entered their minds at all) that Hecht and MacArthur had to make Hildy Johnson a woman would have promptly fallen by the wayside because the two authors were aware that the real Hildy Johnson would be in the theater on opening night to observe the antics of the fictional Hildy on stage.  By all accounts, the real Hildy was a large and formidable Swede, not at all someone H&Mac wished to annoy.

In very short order, the play was faithfully transferred to the movie screen with Pat O'Brien as Hildy and dapper Adolph Menjou as Walter Burns.  That film is largely forgotten today, but is well worth watching.  It was the first major film of the talkie era in which the old fluid movement of the silent film camera was re-attained.  Menjou and O'Brien are both terrific.

More than a decade later, a geologic era of Hollywood time, Howard Hawks set himself to the task of making a remake.  He hired Charles Lederer, yet another raffish writer, to make a 1940-ish screenplay out of the 1928 play.  He, or Lederer, or both simultaneously succumbed to the psycho-magnetic pull of that name, Hildy.  They subjected Johnson to a gender transformation ... which changed the relationship between Burns and Johnson from Mephistopheles and Faust to lovers-separated ... which allowed for the importation of a new character as the temporary impediment to the course of true love ... which yielded a magnificent screenplay that maintained all the cynical energy of the original, but in the context of a romantic comedy.

In the apportioning of credit, so far, I would put writer Lederer far ahead of director Hawks.  Hawks racks up points for casting Cary Grant in the unaccustomed role of an authority figure, for casting Roz Russell who was perfectly capable of going toe-to-toe with Grant and always giving as good as she got, and for tossing in the wonderful, but still under-appreciated Ralph Bellamy as hilarious ballast to keep everything on course.

Hawks did one more thing.  He rehearsed each scene in long takes, again and again, until the rapid, overlapping rhythm of the words was ingrained in the performers.  Then, and only then, did he shoot it.

This film is a masterpiece for its screenplay, for its performers down to the smallest parts (a perfect, Big Studio-era repertory company of players), for Hawks' masterful direction.  Sheesh, what more could you want?  Of course it's worth five stars!",1171584000,12,4903,4.881642512077295

But it took four Marx brothers to match what Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell do in this picture.

 For those who don't know ""His Girl Friday"" is a remake of the stage play ""The Front Page"" written by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur only in this version a battle of the sexes element is added, as the star report (played by Russell) is a woman, turning this into one of the great screwball comedies.

When Walter finds out his star report and may I add ex-wife ""Hildy"" Johnson (Russell) is going to leave the paper in order to get married to Bruce Baldwin (played by an actor who looks surprisingly like Ralph Bellamy, as Cary Grant tells us in the movie). Well, Walter simply won't hear of this. How can he just sit by and watch his ace reporter leave. Plus we suspect perhaps deep down they still love each other. But ""love"" really doesn't matter. Walter will say or do anything just as long as ""Hildy"" doesn't leave.

 Now while all of this is going on a major story is about to break out as an execution is going to take place in a murder case. Walter's paper has been defended the man claiming he's criminally insane. So Walter wants ""Hildy"" to go and interview the prisoner to prove his innocence.

 In the newsroom though is where most of the fun takes place. Some of the reports include Cliff Edwards (probably best known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket in ""Pinocchio"" and star of a couple of Buster Keaton comedies such as ""Bedroom, Parlor, and Bath"" and ""Doughboys"") and Roscoe Kerns (""It Happened One Night"" and Hawk's ""Twentieth Century"")

 Hawks wasn't primarily a comedy director, he did direct some John Wayne westerns and gangster pictures (the original ""Scarface""). But some of his best work can be found in his comedies. He and Grant worked together on ""Bringing Up Baby"" two years earlier and ""I Was A Male War Bride"" nine years later.

 ""His Girl Friday"" is a classic example of great screwball comedy. The witty banther between Grant and Russell is priceless and worth the price of a DVD alone. You will never see a comedy as fast as this one.

 Also worth mentioning is a delightful cameo by Billy Gilbert. His brief work is scene-stealing good!

 Bottom-line: One of the fastest dialogue comedies of all-time. One of Hawks' and Grant's best works together. This is a classic example of great screwball comedy. They don't make 'em like this anymore!",1141603200,2,2743,4.56734693877551
1026600,3,6305416192,"Why is it that so many people overrate old movies and call them the greatest of all time when they simply aren't?  This is a good movie, no question about it.  But why do people go overboard about good old movies and act as if they are better than all the rest?

Watch this one and then watch The Lady Eve starring Barbara Stanwyck.  There are some excellent lines here, and the plot is a good one, but The Lady Eve is far superior.  People say that this movie is smart, and it is, but The Lady Eve is a lot smarter, has a lot more heart, and is just much better.

There's something tinny about this.  About Cary Grant's character, always bs'ing everyone.  About all the fast talking.  There are a few scenes during which I was thinking that the director hurried the actors through their lines to the point where it was not believable.  People do have to think before they can speak.  Some of these frenetic scenes are rushed through.  Others sustain the fast pace very well.

The characters played by Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda in The Lady Eve are genuinely adorable.  The same can't be said here.  Cary Grant is a lot to take, in this movie, and Hildy isn't a heart throb either.  There's more appeal and more heart in The Lady Eve.

It is unfair to compare any film to the Stanwyck-Fonda classic, but the other reviews on this site force me to it, because they make the inaccurate claim that His Girl Friday is one of the best movies ever made.  I'm pointing you to a movie that really is, as opposed to this one.

This movie has some great laughs though.  A few of the throwaway lines really got me.  I like when Cary Grant opens the rollup desk in which the killer is hiding and calls him a mock turtle, or whatever he calls him.

There's a bit of silliness early on when Cary Grant looks at his rival, the insurance salesman from Albany, and says he looks like Ralph Bellamy.  That's cute, considering that he is being played by Ralph Bellamy.  Talk about taking away the fourth wall.

This is a good movie, but one of my pet peeves is just how often reviewers will call every good old movie one of the greatest of all time.  That makes about 400 movies the greatest of all time.",1136419200,8,2191,4.3088235294117645

1026602,5,6305416192,"Of all of the remarriage comedies, this is one of my very favorites (along with _My Favorite Wife_ and _The Philadelphia Story_--also Grant vehicles). In fact, if snappy dialogue were my only criterion, _His Girl Friday_ would top my list. Howard Hawks deserves a medal for making the Hildy Johnson character into a woman. That little stroke of genius added a new dimension to _The Front Page_, resulting in one of very few remakes that dance rings around the originals. That honor is thanks, in no small part, to an outstanding cast. Russel and Grant fire off streams of vitriol at each other with such rapidity that you really have to keep your ears open or you'll miss something priceless. And Ralph Bellamy as the hapless Bruce Baldwin is endearingly clueless, an excellent foil to the street-smart Grant and his wicked barbs.

Russell and Grant are perfectly matched, but although she plays the main character, Grant is the true star. His personality is so kinetic and dynamic that whenever he's on screen, it's hard to take your eyes off him--and when he's not, you wonder when he will return. With his deadpan delivery and eloquent eyes, Cary Grant imbues the picture with many layers of humor that harmonize with, and yet transcend, the script. His comic timing is flawless, his acting effortless. He is unafraid to simper, scowl, smirk, and sneer, but never goes over the top (well, hardly ever). Best of all, Grant can express himself even when he remains expressionless. His stony-faced stares provide some of my favorite moments in the film.

It doesn't hurt that he is absolutely gorgeous. Grant stops just shy of being a pretty boy--that square jaw and aggressive nose ensure that he looks thoroughly masculine. I am not old enough to remember Cary Grant as a young man, but still I mourn the end of the era of the truly tall, dark, and handsome movie star. They're all so short, scruffy, and crude these days. Harrison Ford and George Clooney are fine actors with the requisite looks, but it is hard to recall any performance in which they exuded the same level of sophistication, arrogance, and wit as Cary Grant.

Sure, there are some elements of the film that date it, and even make it a bit offensive to the modern viewer. But it would be a shame to let that stand in the way of your enjoyment of this brilliant comedy. If I had my way, all contemporary comedy writers would be forced to watch this film again and again, to learn how to write smart, funny, intelligent dialogue. I can think of few writers who even come close to duplicating HGF's achievements in that arena: Nora Ephron and Bonnie Hunt, perhaps.

I have not bought the DVD. Based on the reviews, I'll probably purchase the Columbia version. In the meantime, I wanted to put in my two cents' worth, and recommend this movie to anyone who has a taste for smart, dialogue-driven comedy.",1127692800,5,2869,4.709163346613546
1026603,5,6305416192,"""His Girl Friday"", released in 1940, is a reworking of the Hecht and Macarthur play ""The Front Page"", a witty and ruthless comedy/drama about the press covering a murder case. The story has not dated and the film contains some of the fastest dialogue put on celluloid.

Cary Grant plays the editor of the paper and Rosalind Russell, his star reporter and in this version, his ex-wife. Part of the reason that Russell seems so modern is that her part was originally a male role. By switching reporter Hildy Johnson to a female, the director, Howard Hawks, introduced sex and issues such as women competing in a male world and career versus private life, still relevant today. The depiction of the press is also still spot on. Grant's character is actually very unlikeable, a real creep, so there is nothing sentimental here. Special mention too of Ralph Bellamy, Russell's fiance, giving an hilarious portrayal of a hick as he did in ""The Awful Truth"".

This DVD copy of the film contains an excellent print but there are no extras included. This film, with Aunty Mame, was Rosalind Russell's moment for film immortality - brilliant.

P.S. It is worth noting that the copy of the film available in one of the Cary Grant Signature Collections contains a featurette about the film and a worthwhile commentary.",1126396800,3,1306,4.821428571428571
1026604,4,6305416192,"A few weeks ago I reviewed one of Grant's earlier projects with director Howard Hawks called Bringing Up Baby and completely despised it.  It was annoying, unfunny, and the timing was completely moldy.  Well, maybe Hawks learned from his mistakes because His Girl Friday was the direct opposite.  While in Baby I thought that Grant and Hepburn made a horrific team whom couldn't play off each other, in this film Grant's chemistry with Rosalind Russell is impeccable.  They both know timing and they both are able to keep up with each other.  Both have their characters developed and understood so even if there was some ad lib mixed in with the script, we wouldn't know because they are able to playfully compete with each other on screen.  The story is rather dark, surprisingly, which keeps the viewer attracted to the themes and plot, which unfolds with lightning speed in front of us.  You have the sensation that Hawks felt comfortable with this film, the challenges and the actors unlike the outcome of Bringing Up Baby.  Everyone involved seems to be on top of their game providing yet another memorable chapter in ""screwball comedy"" history.

I must say that originally my impression of Cary Grant was not a desirable one.  My first film viewed in which he stars did not leave a great taste in my mouth, but thankfully he was able to counter with this film.  Grant seemed born to play Burns, and I wonder if it wasn't more comforting for him.  He seemed relaxed in this role, familiar with his mannerisms, and completely in control.  His ability to be constantly above 100% in each scene we watch was impressive, but what I found most enjoyable was Rosalind Russell's performance.  She matched what Grant had and raised it even higher.  You could not keep your eyes off her as she controlled every scene she was involved with.  Her ability to be stronger than the male characters, and honestly smarter, was impressive for a film made in the 1940s.  This was a strong woman doing a man's job, and I wouldn't be surprised if Hawks wasn't trying to tell us something here.  While the ending of the film didn't seem to fit as well as the rest of the film with Russell, she was so charismatic, so charming, and so innocent, that you could not help but root for her during the entire run.  She captured you and never let you go!

While the characters did create this film and keep you laughing constantly, the story wasn't shabby either.  It was actually a very dark story, darker than I anticipated a film starring Cary Grant would be.  Here you have a newspaper conglomerate that has the power to sway the decisions of Governors, to take sides in public matters, to cohort with evildoers and still remain at the top of their game.  While I do believe Hawks was trying to recreate the reality of such a fast paced work environment, I couldn't help but wonder if he wasn't speaking even on broader terms.  Did he hold some animosity towards the media?  Did Hawks think that perhaps the media was swaying the public's image away from the truth?  One scene that I thought was sheer brilliance was when Molly Malloy (Helen Mack) arrived in the pressroom frantically yelling about how the newsmen smeared the truth throughout the paper.  It was so bad that she herself couldn't remember what really happened.  It seemed that every word that came from Molly's mouth was twisted into a new, far-fetched story.  It was similar to a game of telephone.  The truth may be staring you in the face, but when it reaches the end of the line, it may be something completely different.  I think Hawks was trying to tell us something.  Even when Molly finally reaches her climactic scene, you cannot help but wonder if she doesn't represent a part of Hawks, or the entertainment industry, or anyone hurt by the media.  Inside this ""screwball comedy"" was something deeper and very disturbing.

Overall, I was impressed with this film.  I loved the language of the characters.  I love the way that Cary Grant embodied this manipulative man who got everything he reached out for.  Beware those thinking that this is a feminist film, while there may be a very strong central female character, the smarter Grant constantly undermines her.  The ending was the only part of this film that I had trouble dealing with.  While Hawks was trying desperately to drive a point home, it just seemed choppier than the rest of the film.  The ending felt rushed and completely bland.  I needed a stronger structure, but was extremely happy with the rest of the film.  This was an amazing feature, for both the creative and charismatic characters that were painted onto the screen, but also with the hidden themes that Hawks threw in between jokes.  I found myself laughing and thinking at the same time.  This truly was one of those films that was released well before its time.

Just like in a movie like the Philadelphia Story (also with Cary Grant) the dialogue is fast, crisp, funny and like a tennismatch: from one person to the other and back again.

'His Girl Friday' is the same. It's the story about a newspaper man and his ex-wife, he comes back to the office telling him that she is getting married again the next day. He lures her into covering a story about an execution the next day while also harassing the husband-to-be.

The charm  he so effortlessly exudes just can't be found in movies nowadays.  The wit of his verbal battles with Russell put to shame any other romantic comedy of today.  They just don't make them like this anymore.  This movie inspired me to rent Bringing up Baby (which was also great and very funny) but this one is infinitely better.

1026707,5,6305416192,"How's this for a double helping of classic comedy from two of America's most revered entertainers?  Arguably, His Girl Friday and My Favorite Brunette feature the best of both Cary Grant and Bob Hope, respectively.

With Howard Hawks in the director's chair and Cary Grant in the lead role, you're pretty much guaranteed to have a good time.  His Girl Friday comes at you a mile a minute, with dialogue that starts out at break-neck speed and never slows down and more humorous moments than you can find time to laugh at.  It's an unusual romantic comedy, given the fact that Cary Grant's character is a little less than noble (he is a rather ruthless newspaper man, after all) and the nice guy in the picture is lucky to finish at all, but there's still something endearing about the whole relationship between Walter Burns (Grant) and his former ace reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell), who also happens to be his ex-wife.  Hildy is due to get married in less than 24 hours, and Burns is desperate to win her back - for the newspaper as well as himself.  This battle of the sexes turns into one of the most impressive battles of wits the big screen has ever seen, and the whole wild and crazy story makes for an extraordinary experience.

Grant and Russell demonstrate remarkable chemistry together, which is a necessity given the fact that their characters are divorced and know each other's ways so well.  Poor Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy), Hildy's mild-mannered fianc, is overwhelmed by the charm and manipulations of the remarkable Walter Burns.  Even Hildy falls prey to his spontaneously elaborate schemes, finding herself agreeing to do one last story before leaving the newspaper business for good.  That story, about a timid little man guilty of shooting a policeman whose forthcoming execution is being exploited as a triumph of law and order over anarchists and Reds, explodes in the hours leading up to the scheduled hanging, as the murderer escapes and ultimately provides the paper with a scoop that even the imaginative Burns could hardly have engineered on his own.

His Girl Friday is all about the dialogue.  There are more words spoken during this ninety-minute film than you will find in any handful of other motion pictures.  Grant and Russell really are remarkable, as most scenes go on for many minutes without either actor breaking stride.  All of the minor characters jump in and out at the same unstoppable pace, and many are the times multiple characters are speaking to different people simultaneously.  This is nothing less than an elaborate circus of vocalization, and it is all you as the viewer can do to keep up with everything that is going on.  Burns and Hildy may have little time to think, but that doesn't stop them from unleashing words of great wit, innuendo, sarcasm, comic genius, and even a couple of in-jokes one on top of the other.  Meanwhile, the script becomes much more complicated than I expected, as the murderer awaiting the gallows escapes, the corruption of the police and local government is made manifest, a woman tries to kill herself, and Hildy's husband-to-be and his mother find themselves victimized by Burns' ruthless schemes to keep Hildy right where she belongs.

His Girl Friday is an inspired example of moviemaking at its best, a classic that demands multiple viewings and loses none of its edge over the ensuing decades since its 1940 release.  Not only is the film a real hoot to watch, it's a strange sort of pleasure to sit back and enjoy a host of extraordinary actors performing at the very tops of their games.

In My Favorite Brunette (1947), Bob Hope plays a baby photographer who dreams of becoming a detective.  When an exotic brunette by the name of Carlotta Montay (Dorothy Lamour) mistakes him for a detective, he decides to throw caution to the wind and handle her case himself.  A detective only needs smarts, courage, and a gun, and he has a gun; he has even invented a camera that takes pictures through keyholes.  Carlotta says her husband is missing, although she later changes her story to say it is her uncle.  When Jackson comes out to the house, he meets the missing uncle and starts to believe Carlotta is rowing upstream without a paddle, but Ronnie Jackson (Bob Hope) is not one to leave a gorgeous brunette in distress.  To him, being a detective basically involves making time with beautiful female clients.  Soon, as there really are all sorts of thug-induced shenanigans going on, Jackson is in over his head, eventually finding himself framed for a murder he didn't commit.

My Favorite Brunette features vintage Bob Hope comedy.  He has one-liners for even the darkest of occasions; he even complains jokingly about his last meal when he is locked up in the hoosegow awaiting execution.  Dorothy Lamour's character remains serious and reserved throughout, but this doesn't slow Bob Hope down, as he quite easily carries the movie's load of comedy single-handedly.  As always with Hope, the comedy comes out in so many ways, particularly in the facial expressions; I don't think the man could ever have been not funny if he tried.  The ending of this movie screams deus ex machina, but it really doesn't matter.  My Favorite Brunette features an hour and a half of Bob Hope comedy in its most concentrated and effective form, guaranteeing a ton of laughs for anyone with a funny bone in his/her body.  There's even a very special dessert at the end of this comedic buffet, as Bing Crosby puts in a quick but noteworthy appearance.",1116720000,7,5538,4.826455026455027

One of the main things that you will see in other films made around this time is that the good guy role is always good and he always ends up with the girl.

Well in this film Cary Grant is really kind of a bad guy and the good guy is played by Ralph Bellamy. Ralph is this sweet natured guy wanting to marry this girl Hildy played by Rosalind Russell. Ralph is your prototypical guy, the kind that your mom wants you to bring home. However Cary Grant is the exact opposite of him. (DO NOT READ NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM)

Cary ends up with the girl and Ralph is sent packing. Besides the girl issue Cary also gets Ralph in trouble, not to mention has Ralph's mother kidnapped. Is that a role of the good guy back in the 30's & 40's? No!

The significance is that the film broke the rules and did great job of doing so.

Personally I'm not a big fan of movies made back before the 60's because most of them aren't all that good. Movies like Casablanca are horrible productions. They refuse to 1) depicit reality and 2) push the bounds of film making and usually keep movies very conservative.

1026713,5,6305416192,"One of the finest examples of 1930s comedy, and an excellent adaptation of a story that has been told many times, *His Girl Friday* is Hollywood at its best. Perfectly pairing Grant and Russell with an excellent script by Charles Lederer, based on Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's 1931 play, *The Front Page*, it is the kind of studio magic that could occur when the powers-that-be assigned the best work to the best candidates. Grant, whom I found arrogant and repellant later in his career - not to mention redundant - is at his suave-and-smooth best here as Walter Burns, newspaper editor, with the perfect foil in Rosiland Russell. As Hildy Johnson, Burns' ex-wife, Russell plays was in the process of cutting her teeth developing characters like this. Hildy is the archetype that gave Russell her reputation as a fast-talking dame, with machine gun delivery, and a smart-mouthed answer for everything. Hildy is off to marry Bruce, played by Bellamy, but her ex, Walter, still needs her to be his star reporter and cover the execution of a convicted killer. Every early journalistic stereotype is in full force - from reporters who would stop at nothing to get their story, to the city editor with a visor and sleeve-garters. Gene Lockhart, Ernest Truex and Clarence Kolb are all in fine form, but even the finest supporting performances pale against Grant and Russell. They are both delightful in this stylish slapstick farce that had previously been filmed as *The Front Page* (and later, again as *The Front Page* in 1974, and as *Switching Channels*). It also spawned a slew of imitators, not the least of which was TV's *Moonlighting*.

In this version they changed the gender of Hildy to a female and the professional tension of the original is replaced by sexual tension.

Studio heads were appalled at the ad-libs they heard in the dailies ""He looks like er...that fellow in the movies, Ralph Bellamy.""  They wondered if there was a madman in charge.
(There was. His name was Howard Hawks)
Adapted from the 1928 play and film ""The Front Page"", the madman realized that it would be much funnier if Hildy was female and, for good measure, about to leave not only the newspaper but also her dashing but um...slightly unethical ex-husband to marry a dullish Mama's boy (played to perfection by Bellamy) in order to finally lead a 'normal life.'
Of course she's leaving on the 3 o'clock train so there's still  time for Walter to concoct some insane scheme to stop Hildy from making a terrible mistake and win her back.
Now if you're wondering how one can leave an EX-husband, or how  hanging an innocent man to win an election, kidnapping old ladies, or framing a sweet simpleton for 'mashing' with the help of a blonde bombshell albino could possibly be funny

1026850,4,6305416192,"Based upon the Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur play ""The Front Page"", ""His Girl Friday"" is one of the most terrific and enjoyable of screwball comedies, as well as a satire of the newspaper business (Which explains it lack of Oscars).
Cary Grant is Walter Burns, the chief editor of the Morning Daily newspaper. He runs into trouble with his ex-wife ""Hildy"" Johnson (Rosalind Russell), who is also the best writer at the paper. Hildy tells Walter that she is moving to Albany and is getting married to an insurance man, Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy). Thus, she's quitting her job. This comes at a bad time, for an innocent man named Earl Williams (John Qualen) has been charged with and will be hanged for murder. Walter seems to still love Hildy, and sure isn't going to loose his best writer. So he has her interview Williams and get a story on him to prove he isn't insane. Walter, however, has a plan behind this. He wants to delay the trip of Hildy and Bruce long enough to allow Hildy to reconsider her decision to leave the paper. Thus, he has Bruce put on the charge of stealing a watch. Hildy becomes so irate that she destroys her story and is about to depart when Earl Williams breaks out, causing a chain reaction of events that'll make Walter and Hildy feel as though they're in a tea kettle.
Hildy Johnson's character in the original play was a man. Which might explain some of her not so lady like gestures and actions. There's ink flowing in her blood and Walter knows that. He knows that she was meant to be active and adventurous, not bogged down by figures and facts in an insurance office. But, it is also very likely that some of the things Walter does are out of love. He wants to make up for lost time that he didn't have with Hildy, like how their honeymoon was spoiled because they were trapped in a mine. Grant seems to be perfect for the role. But, though Russell was also a terrific choice, other actresses of the period (Katherine Hepburn, Irene Dunne, Myrna Loy) would have also been good choices. They would have presented the character differently though; they don't have newspaper ink flowing in their blood. Then again, what right do I have to complain? I'm a film buff, yes, but one who still needs more experience in screwball comedies.
A fine supporting cast assists Grant and Russell. Bellamy replays a role that's similar to his in ""The Awful Truth"". Come to think of it, this movie is a lot like ""The Awful Truth"", at least with the bickering ex-lovers and with Bellamy's Bruce, like his Daniel in ""Awful Truth"", being loyal to his mother. Gene Lockhart (""Going My Way"") has some funny scenes as Sheriff Peter B. `Pinky', who inadvertently helps Earl Williams escape from prison (Which causes Hildy to say that the B means Brains). The newspaper reporters are all a cruel bunch: They published bad things about Earl Williams and smeared the name of his girlfriend, Molly Malloy (Helen Mack). They only spring into action when they hear a news lead that sounds interesting, such as a background check that shows Earl Williams failed a class in High School. Among this group includes Porter Hall, Cliff Edwards, Roscoe Karns, Frank Jenks, and Regis Toomey (There's also Ernest Truex as Roy Bensinger, a tribune reporter). Also in the supporting cast include Clarence Kold as the mayor who would hang his own mother to be reelected, Abner Biberman as Louis, a hood who seems to be a send up of ""Scarface"" Al Capone (Or at least as he was played by Paul Muni), Alma Kruger as Bruce's mother, who uncovers the hiding place of Williams, Pat Westas as Warden Cooley, Edwin Maxwell as Psychiatrist Dr. Egelhoffer and Billy Gilber as a messenger with news from the governor.
Though it could be another item that makes this show great, the rapid, twisting plot may annoy some. Walter teams with Hildy, only to then double cross her by getting Bruce landed in jail. But not just once, oh no no. The poor guy goes there three times. It's like ""Come three times in one day and your next visit is free"" (That's right. All this occurs in about 12-18 hours). The ending I'll try not to spoil. But I will say that'll either make sense to you or just seem like another happy Hollywood ending (Or similar to endings of screwball comedies like ""It Happened One Night"", ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", ""The Awful Truth"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"").
The VHS edition I saw this on was from the Goodtimes Video series ""Hollywood Movie Greats"" and is erroneously called a ""Collector's Edition."" Well, I guess if the collector wants a so-so print of the movie. The picture quality is clear for the most part, though some scenes are lighter or darker then others. One such scene is when one reporter asks for more light in the pressroom, saying that he can't see a thing. He must be blind because I could see fine. The sound is clear for the most part, though some scenes suddenly become louder for a few minutes and then tone down. A collector's edition should also have something like a theatrical trailer, or at least an advertisement for others in the collection. Fortunately, the movie has been put on DVD in an edition licensed by Columbia. I don't have it, but it should at least have better audio and video (Not to mention some extras).",1035504000,,5253,4.601279317697228

1026987,5,6305416192,"This is a priceless, brilliant comedy from 1940. Although several movies were made based on the hit play The Front Page, a sarcastic comedy about the newspaper business, none was as successful or is as hilarious as His Girl Friday.
Made by expert director Howard Hawks, His Girl Friday is one of the most entertaining and hilarious films ever! The film was the first to use overlapping dialogue, and it is probably the fastest talking film in history! It can be watched again and again, because every time you find new things to laugh about that you missed the last time!
The cast is fantastic as well. Cary Grant, especially, though usually very good, gives one of his best performances in His Girl Friday as the amoral and manipulative newpaper editor Walter Burns. He is spectacular! Every scene he is in is hilarious because of his funny expressions and clever way of saying his lines. He also contributes greatly to the film by several ""in jokes"", such as the Archie Leach line and the part in which he describes Ralph Bellamy's character as looking like ""uhh..that fellow in the movies..you know, Ralph Bellamy.""
Rosalind Russell is excellent as well as Hildy Johnson, the star reporter who wants to quit, and she and Cary make a wonderfully spunky pair! Ralph Bellamy does a good job with his role as Hildy's fiancee, the bumbling insurance guy. The rest of the cast is just as good.
Anyhow, this movie is a must have! Make sure to get a good copy of the DVD though - personally, I would recommend the His Girl Friday/Cary Grant on Film version because of its clarity.",1025913600,9,1575,4.669064748201439
1026988,5,6305416192,"Cary Grant plays a newspaper editor and Rosalind Russell plays his ex-wife and fellow reporter who is about to quit her job and remarry. Grant doesn't want to lose one of his star reporters, and he is unscrupulous enough to do just about anything to stop the marriage going ahead, including having her prospective husband framed and thrown in prison- not once, but twice. Russell is desperate to leave journalism behind her and start a family and a home, but her journalistic instincts flair up when she hears of a man about to be unfairly executed and she thinks she can stop it. Watching her facilitate between her desire to be a journalist and a housewife is genuinely funny.
The film is gripping and Howard Hawks, one of Hollywood's greatest directors, handles the direction with real flair, never letting the pace slacken. Cary Grant is a master of comic timing and both he and Russell make a great double act. The rest of the cast put in a sterling performance. This is a much better film than the more famous Billy Wilder remake.",1022284800,,1036,4.666666666666667

Second, I'm sure someone will say that this Marx Bros. movie is funnier or that Billy Wilder movie is funnier, but this is (in my mind) the funniest movie ever.  Timing is everything in screwball comedies and this one is nearly perfect in its timing.  ""How could you break up our home like that?""  ""What home?""  Don't you remember the home I promised you?"" all at breakneck speed.  And then when Hilde is interviewing Earl Williams it is much slower.  His ""Oh, I don't smoke"" is very pathetic and induces sympathy in the viewer even though its pretty hard to defend his actions.  Brilliant!
Ralph Bellamy is also good as the sweet, but unexciting Bruce Baldwin.  Watch Cary Grant's face as Bellamy delivers the line ""So, Mrs. Sweeney didn't have twins?"".  Its priceless and gives me a laugh every single time I see it.
The audio track by Todd McCarthy is fairly insightful.  The best stories are those about Rosalind Russell hiring an adman to write better lines for her and the producers wanting to cut Cary Grant's ad-lib ""He looks like that fellow from the movies, what's-his-name, Ralph Bellamy."" because it was insolent.  Thank God better sense prevailed.  I think that might be the first movie ""in-joke"" followed by Grant's ""Archie Leach"" gag.
The documentaries are good, but don't really reveal too much.  I was interested to hear that Jean Arthur was originally offered the part but turned it down.  I always thought she would be perfect.  Oh well, Rosalind Russell is just as good (and that's saying a lot).

1026990,5,6305416192,"HIS GIRL FRIDAY was directed by Howard Hawks and stars Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. What more needs to be said? Back in the day, when you had a combination like that you knew a movie was going to be good (unlike today when an all-star cast doesn't guarantee anything).
I have yet to see a film that Grant made that wasn't good and HIS GIRL FRIDAY is one of his finest performances. Instead of the bumbling buffoon that Grant usually plays, in HIS GIRL FRIDAY he plays Walter Burns, a fast-talking newspaper editor who writes for the people instead of the big business and political corporations that support it. Russell portrays Hildy, one of the best writers in the business and Burns' ex-wife. The verbal bombardment between the two is some of the best ever captured on film. Nevertheless, all that wit is spoken so naturally that it feels completely normal and ordinary.
Howard Hawks was one of the best directors and made great films in all genres from Westerns to comedies to the fast-paced roller coaster that is HIS GIRL FRIDAY. Hawks made a lot of great films in his career, but HIS GIRL FRIDAY ranks as one of the top five Hawks films of all time.
The movie is not only full of verbal intelligence, but it's full of action as well. Of course, the action here isn't the ""let's-blow-up-another-building"" action of the modern movie era. The action in HIS GIRL FRIDAY is, well, simply action: the stuff that makes for great drama. Nobody is still in HIS GIRL FRIDAY, everyone is moving in a motion that resembles real life.

1026992,5,6305416192,"(Please note that the DVD version I am reviewing is the Laserlight release that features an additional documentary on the life of Cary Grant as well as an introduction by an even-more-confused-than-usual Tony Curtis.)
With Laserlight you can never predict from the outside case exactly what the quality of the film itself is going to be in.  I've watched good quality prints from them in the past, but I've also seen some truly awful releases that aren't worth the plastic that they're pressed on.  Fortunately, their version of HIS GIRL FRIDAY is quite excellent, with a crisp picture and a clear soundtrack.  Their budget releases are usually worth the risk, and in this case, you end up with a great movie that's quite well preserved and all for a fairly low price.
The movie itself is simply fantastic.  The dialogue comes flying at you so fast that'll be afraid to laugh for fear of speaking over the next line.  The story itself is also intensely funny, and deceptively dark.  What begins as a seemingly light romantic comedy slowly becomes more and more twisted until the final scene, where the reinstatement of the romance subplot reminds us of how far we've come.  It's a testament to the skills of the director, Howard Hawks, that the result is not only coherent, but also highly enjoyable.  The story flows effortlessly from moment to moment, with each scene being slightly more frantic than the last, yet still together enough to be extremely entertaining.
The acting from the two main leads is also a delight.  In the past I had thought of Cary Grant as always playing the same sort of character in every film.  Although, you'll see some similarity to other roles that he played, he's incredibly amusing in this film and playing a far more manipulative character than I'd seen him perform.  It's a nice change to see the usually easily befuddled Cary Grant actually running rings around the rest of the cast.
As for the DVD extras, they don't distract from the feature, but they won't be the deciding factor in whether you purchase this DVD or not.  The included documentary, CARY GRANT ON FILM: A BIOGRAPHY runs about 28 minutes long and consists mainly of random trailers that span Grant's entire film career.  It's fairly interesting, although not terribly riveting.  The introductory remarks by Tony Curtis are as bizarrely entertaining as always.  The film contains Spanish, Japanese and Chinese subtitles, but does not include an option for English, which is a slightly annoying oversight.
In the end, it's not the extras that you should be buying this disc for; it's the wonderful film that's packaged with them.  Kick back, relax, and watch the dialog fly across the screen.  You'll want to keep the remote control handy so that you can rewind to catch all the great moments that you missed while laughing over them.",1014076800,9,2837,4.840579710144928

However, I am so relieved at the good people who review DVD's on this site for the recommendation of the Columbia Classics version, which was remastered and shows some dignity and respect towards their audience. Evidently, d3k expects to sucker-in one time only buyers, since no one in their right mind would ever buy a DVD from this outfit ever again.",1009584000,3,747,4.666666666666667
1026994,5,6305416192,"Of all the great directors in cinema history, Howard Hawks was easily the most versatile.  Think of a great director.  Any director.  Think of the kinds of films they directed?  No matter who you consider, at best they worked in two or three genres.  but Hawks turned to every conceivable genre with his cinematic mastery intact.  Had he worked in the 1970s or 1980s, he would probably have produced a great martial arts film.  Hawks made great war films, comedies, Westerns, gangster films, detective films, adventure films, musicals, and is even acknowledged to be the uncredited creative force behind THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE, the film that started the Sci-fi craze of the fifties.
But in my mind, Hawks was first and foremost a director of screwball comedies.  He more or less invented the genre with his 1934 TWENTIETH CENTURY, and went on to direct BRINGING UP BABY, BALL OF FIRE, and lesser efforts like I WAS A MALE WAR BRIDE and MONKEY BUSINESS.  But as much as I like TWENTIETH CENTURY and BRINGING UP BABY, my favorite Hawks comedy is easily HIS GIRL FRIDAY.
This movie gets so many things right that it is difficult to begin isolating just a few of its excellencies.  You almost have to begin with the utterly breathtaking verbal interchanges between Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell.  The script is heavily based on the great Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur play THE FRONT PAGE.  In becoming a comedy, many of the impressive social themes of the play become muted.  Fortunately, some of the racism of the play also is muted, though not eliminated (an unfortunate joke about a black woman giving birth is retained in the Hawks script and film).  But whatever is lost in seriousness is gained by in sheer comedic force and exuberance.  Which leads us back to Grant and Russell's verbal exchanges.  They are intense, quick, fast-paced, and almost manic.  This film may contain more words per minute than any other Hollywood has produced.  The pace is so rapid that in many spots the characters are intentionally tripping over the others' lines.  Frequently two and even three characters are talking at once.  But over and over again, the viewer is just stunned by the virtuosity of Grant and Russell.  It is difficult to imagine better comedic acting than this.
The cast is almost impossible to overpraise.  All the way down to the top 15 or 20 characters, the casting is perfect.  Although Grant and Russell stand out, this is really an ensemble cast.  Ralph Bellamy is solid in his thankless but essential role as Rosalind Russell's fianc.
The movie also features some great in jokes.  I'll mention only three.  When Grant sends someone to give some (counterfeit) money to Bellamy's character, Grant is asked what he looks like.  He hesitates for only a fraction of a second before answering, ""He looks just like that movie fellow, Ralph Bellamy.""  At another point, a frustrated Cary Grant threatens someone by saying, ""I'll do to you what I did to Archie Leech.""  Archie Leech, was, of course, Cary Grant's real name.  When Earl Williams, who is hiding in a roll top desk, attempts to get out, Grant says, ""Get back in there, you old Mock Turtle.""  Near the beginning of his career, Grant had played the part of the Mock Turtle (in heavy make up but singing his own song--most people are not aware that Grant had a pleasant light tenor and was quite at ease in musical comedy).
Just a great comedy.  I would, however, like to caution people with the other reviewers to get only the Columbia version of the film.  This movie was in public domain for some time, and during that time a large number of execrable versions were produced.

This brand new DVD is immaculate in the transfer - Make sure though you're getting the DVD that has the ""Columbia Classics"" across the top - any other version is more than likely an old transfer with little care taken in the DVD mastering...  This new DVD is the best the movie will probably ever look and is still a great film with some of the best bantering/overlapping dialogue and hilarious acting by Cary Grant you'll ever find....",974764800,23,605,4.392857142857143

Russell and Grant are both fabulous in the leads, and even though this story has been remade several times (in fact, this version itself is a remake), niothing compares to this glorious B&W masterpiece. I don't care how old you are, rent or buy this title today.  You'll laugh and enjoy this film for years to come. Enjoy, --Jason",974419200,,469,4.559523809523809
1027091,5,6305416192,"Cary Grant & Rosalind Russell star in a classic that began on the stage. Because of those theatrical roots, there is an atmosphere here at work that is seldom seen in movies today. You will never see more characters on screen at the same time trying to talk over each other. You have to see the movie numerous times to catch all the witicisms, so imagine how the play must have been. Cary Grant is perfect in this role, and really gets to play the center of the universe of this film. Rosalind Russell plays a great star reporter/ex-wife to Grant, the editor of a newspaper. The swarm of other characters that revolve around these two are perfect, fiancees, future mother-in-laws, reporters, civil servants. Years Later, in the fifties, Jack Lemmon and the late great Walter Mathau tried to remake this film, obviously without the romantic undertones. They may have been the only two with enough screen chemistry to even attempt this recreation. Unfortunately it just never worked, some masterpieces just can't be redone.",974160000,,1021,4.873563218390805

The Laserlight edition has sharp and crisp image and clear  sound and though the documentary feature 'Cary Grant on Film' is pretty  boring, at least it looks good!

1027093,5,6305416192,"Every movie directed by Howard Hawks with Cary Grant in it I adore!
Starring Rosalind Russel as an ex-newspaperwoman and ex-husband of the  editor of her newspaper- Cary Grant. Her name is Hildy Burns, his is Walter  Burns.
About six months prior, Hildy divorced Walter and quit her job,  but Walter is still in love.
When she comes back to tell him of her  marriage with insurance bumpkin Ralph Bellamy, Walter decides to win Hildy  back- via the story of the decade that only she could write.
HIS GIRL  FRIDAY is perhaps the best film made of the newspaper world. Suitably fast  talked (200- 240 words per minute, as opposed to the usual 100-125) and  cynical, well acted and greatly directed, it's a rare treat that you don't  find anymore these days.",966038400,,754,4.651515151515151
1027094,5,6305416192,"His Girl Friday is one of the most famous comedies from the classic film  era, and its reputation is well earned.  Superior acting, directing, and  writing combine to create a unique film that holds up with every viewing.  Rosalind Russell and especially Cary Grant appear to be having a great time  in their roles, and their comedic timing during their verbal clashes is  perfect.  Grant plays the wily newspaper editor with just the right mix of  charm and mischief, while Russell brings intelligence and equal doses of  vulnerability and toughness to her role.  What a match!  Howard Hawks  directs with a lot of energy so that dialogue is fired at machine gun pace,  and the viewer needs to pay close attention so as not miss anything.  This  comedy has carved out its own niche in the history of film, and should be  considered required viewing by anyone who ""seriously"" loves film  comedies.",965865600,2,897,4.796052631578948
1027261,5,6305416192,"A genuine screwball comedy at it's best!  These are the best words used to describe ""His Girl Friday,"" staring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, and directed by Howard Hawks. Made and released durning the  ""golden age of Hollywood"" the story centers on the relationship  of newspaper editor Walter Burns and his ex-wife; reporter Hildy Johnson,  in their quest of being the first to report the upcoming execution of  anarchist Earl Williams.  Along the way, editor Burns must deal with the  upcoming marriage of ex-wife Hildy.  Knowing that Hildy was one of his best  reporters, when employed under his leadership, he goes all out to make sure  that she calls off the marriage and go back to work for him, since the  biggest scoop of the year is about to happen concerning Earl Williams.  Director Howard Hawks, who is a master of snappy dialogue, uses the  characters of both Walter and Hildy to touch our funny bones in somehow  wanting us to cheer that these two can be together again, either as a  business relationship or that of a love hate couple.  But, as a viewer, you  cannot miss the ending to what I believe is a genuine screwball comedy  classic.",964224000,,1158,4.705
1027262,4,6305416192,"OK, we all know that 'His Girl Friday' (aka 'The Front Page') is a terrific movie which belongs in every DVD collection. But there are some really bad, almost unviewable versions out there.  Fortunately, I chose the  right version, and it's a clean crisp image, tightly-focused sound -- a joy  throughout.  So if you want 'His Girl Friday', make sure you get the  Laserlight DVD version, complete with a Cary Grant biog documentary and an  unvelievably hokey intro from Tony Curtis on a bad day.  I got the  Laserlight disc from Amazon for around $7 -- the really bad dubs other  reviewers have complained about from other companies cost more! I've found  Laserlight transfers of old films are generally ok -- their cheapie  Hitchcock transfers of 'The Lady Vanishes' and 'The 39 Steps' are almost as  good as as Criterion in image, though pretty scratchy in sound. For a  budget label, they do a good job compared to the absolute garbage put out  by Madacy and others.  So remember -- 'His Girl Friday' has to be from  Laserlight or you're wasting your money and buying something totally  unviewable. And no, this is NOT a paid ad! Just trying to steer people  towards a good edition of a classic comedy. If Laserlight wants to thank  me, they could prepare a DVD edition of my favourite of all Billy Wilder  comedies, 'The Major and the Minor' with Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland.  Love those 1940s comedies!",964051200,21,1409,4.692622950819672

1027264,5,6305416192,"I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about concerning this  movie. This is a masterpiece of comedy and acting, way ahead of it's time.  The copy of this movie that I have seen on various TV stations is terrible,  however this is a Laserlight production DVD and the quality is excellent. I  think there is another version of this DVD by another company which maybe  what the other reviewers are talking about, I don't know. A very  sophisticated comedy, the dialogue between the actors is done the way real  people talk to one another, which is Howard Hawks' style. The characters  are very colorful. The story is basically about how a newspaper run by Cary  Grant is trying to stop the execution of a disturbed communist who murdered  a black police officer, this in 1940. They point out how the black vote is  very important to the politicians, all of whom are heels. The portrayal of  politics was very unique to Hollywood films of the time. Also Grant is  trying to persuade Rosalind Russell to do the story instead of running off  to Albany to marry that guy ""who looks like Ralph Bellamy"".  Anyway if you know this film I reccommend it highly. Laserlight does a very  good job transferring this film to DVD, the TV versions are terrible. I  bought this film because I have bad VHS versions of it taped from TV and  figured for $7.99 it could only be better. I was surprised because I never  saw such an excellent copy of this movie. It is well worth it, I have other  Laserlight movies and they so far have been great transfers to DVD of old  classic films.

In other words, the movie is very  inchoherant. There are a few funny scenes and it's OK for about the first  ten minutes or so, but then everything goes haywire and there is also an  abrupt ending. I love classic movies, but this one just succeeded in giving  me a headache mostly. Not recommended.

The Laserlight DVD is fairly good - certainly much  cleaner and sharper than other VHS versions around at present,but the  introduction by Tony Curtis is excruciating - he alternates between staring  at the teleprompter and glancing to the side (in search,perhaps,of the  agent who got him into this mess)-and the mini-documentary that follows is  -how can one put it?-""familiar"".Until a Criterion version  appears,however,this will have to do.",958348800,3,681,5.617647058823529

This film however is head and  shoulders above the rest. Grant and Russell are terrific..and the cast  matches them all the way. Clarence Kolb as the Mayor, Gene Lochart as the  Sherrif, John Qualen as the doomed man, Ralph Bellamy who is always funny  and lessor known actors such as Frank Orth and Abner Biberman and of course  Billy Gilbert( pardon servor) are all timeless.
Sit back, relax, if you  seen it 40 times one more won't hurt a bit(except your sides when they get  taped up from laughing) . A real trivia game would be to name all the  actors in the press room...ex: Porter hall.",957916800,3,769,4.521739130434782

I have a  five-year-old VHS copy of a TV broadcast of the movie that has much better  sound/picture quality.  To make things worse, the feature menus on the DVD  are poorly designed, so that you cannot tell what you are selecting.

Luckily my friend had another version I could compare (and  eventually buy).  The ""His Girl Friday/Cary Grant on Film""  version is superb in comparison:  Dialog is crisp, picture sharp.

This edition is terrible quality. the video is low grade, with the high quality black and white film of the original now appearly as high contrast with all the detail washed out.

But what makes this copy unwatchable is this copy of the video has popping in the source audio every minute or so,as if it was sourced from a vhs tape.

I performed several checks, before posting this review, and it is definately this copy of the movie, not any problems on my end with my equipment or internet connection.

This is especially frustrating, since the version of this film that has been on prime for years and is now the 2nd search result below this one, has vastly better audio and video.

Do not be tricked by this somehow being the top search result. watch the version with the black and white production still as the cover art for a much better viewing experience.",1520467200,,1002,4.513812154696133
