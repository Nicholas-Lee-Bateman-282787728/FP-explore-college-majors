It would not be an exaggeration to say my first viewing of 'A Study In Pink' was a Holmesian experience like no other - I actually remember thinking this must have been how fresh and innovative and clever SCAN was to the Victorians. To this day, I regard that first episode as one of the greatest Sherlock Holmes adaptations, though while it's only fair to review this series based on its own merits, let me first begin by saying that while I have always enjoyed the plot deviations, Sherlock has strayed so far from its roots, I no longer regard it as something even loosely based on Doyle's characters.

Despite complaints from certain quarters, I enjoyed The Empty Hearse immensely, even overlooking my hesitations regarding John's less than ebullient reaction to his friend's return, whose literal and metaphorical blow was softened nicely with humor. All the tension that had been building from the last series' cliffhanger was alleviated cleverly with the tongue-in-cheek way in which it was approached. I give Mr Gatiss a good deal of credit for what he created out of the corner he could have very well been painted into had the resolution taken itself too seriously. Much as I loved 'Sherlock', I found the complaints this episode was terribly out of character to be baseless - it did, of course, have moments of such, but then again, this has been a running theme throughout the series, and I have always in the past forgiven such instances when the episode itself was solid.

The Sign Of Three was phenomenal. It was not conventionally plotted, but did have several plot threads, one of which becomes the main puzzle for Sherlock to solve during the wedding. In all honesty, I actually felt that the fan service was slacking and the program was getting back to its roots as a crime drama, albeit a more lighthearted one. The glimpses we get of Sherlock and John in their ""off hours"" was lovely, and Mary was scripted so well this was the first time in the umpteen adaptations I have read/watched that I really felt we were being given those scraps of what Watson tells us about her in Canon. Bits of OOC behaviors ran through the episode, though this came to a head during parts of the wedding reception's end - my honest assessment being this was Benedict Cumberbatch at a wedding, not any incarnation of Sherlock Holmes.

This was a very disappointing turn of events, but while I was beginning to regard series 3 as more of an AU adaptation where suspension of belief is required, the second episode still managed to become one of my favorites.

What happened with His Last Vow, where precisely it went so irredeemably wrong, I am not certain, but veer off course it did, and it was somewhere towards the middle of this episode that it occurred to me I no longer had any emotional investment in this program anymore, because to do so would have made me utterly disgusted. I had severe problems with parts of A Scandal In Belgravia, as I felt Irene Adler was not done justice to, nor could I reconcile some of Sherlock's behavior and that love interest claptrap. Even so, the supporting characters were strong, especially Martin Freeman's John, who has been like a lighthouse in a storm throughout instances of weak scripting.

If you have any great wish to despise this world and the wonderful characters that once inhabited it, then by all means, watch His Last Vow. Even if one comes into this series with no background knowledge of the books, there are deep-seated issues that simply cannot be ignored. There was so much wrong here, I cannot even find a suitable place to begin. There was promise in the first 20-30 minutes, but had Moffat been writing fan fiction he would have been ""flamed"" for character bashing of the worst kind. It was made astoundingly clear that he has no qualms whatsoever with turning the characterizations of all major and several minor players on their head, for what reason I am unable to discern. For that matter, he seems to be perfectly fine with making Holmes mentally deficient, as any acumen possessed by the detective or cerebral merit of the program was entirely lost. Plainly spoken, Moffat's Holmes was painfully stupid.

Suffice it to say, Moffat has absolutely no concept of what characterization is, much less how it naturally evolves in one's writing, and all the nonsense from ASiB and this last episode was made perfectly clear when he makes several blatant references plucked straight from the pages of Baring-Gould. He presents himself as being some sort of Holmesian expert, but if any of his fodder is coming from that particular avenue, it explains his shoddy take on Sherlock Holmes and his inability to write the man to save his life.

But that's not to say he only managed to run Holmes through the mud, here. No, he had to drag Mary (in the most abominable of ways - I don't care how the issue was resolved!!!), Molly, even to a small extent Mrs Hudson and John through the mud. This craving for danger he's given John Watson is deplorable. In Canon, his sole interest in Holmes was bourne of a scientific curiosity (""the greatest study of mankind is man""), which grew into a mutual love and respect on both their parts. Here, John is just a cheap thrill seeker who is pretty much a psychopath himself and seeks out his like - i.e. Sherlock & Mary.

So. I do honestly believe the first two episodes, even with their faults, were deserving of high marks, hence my three star rating, which I think is being generous. Taken for what it is, this was great entertainment of a far superior quality to 99.9% of shows on television. I was willing to continue watching even with the deviations, to simply enjoy it as a crime drama if nothing else. Unfortunately, I do not foresee any improvements whatsoever with Moffat at the helm, and unless he is thrown overboard in the capacity of a writer, I will not be watching series four. I simply do not care what happens anymore, a sad thing to admit of a program that was once one of the best and wisest I had ever known.",1375401600,259,6051,4.663542642924086

5848627,1,B00DRDBTT8,"At the time of this writing, late December 2017, there are renewed threats that the terrible Sherlock television show might be revived. Im begging that this vile piece of filth  which never should have existed in the first place  not be given yet more time to damage the true Sherlock Holmes! This show is an abomination from first to last, making people think that Sherlock Holmes was a murderous creepy sociopath, Watson had a psychosomatic wound (with all the A to A-0.1 range that Martin Freemans little sputtering double-take Jim/Hobbit skill can generate), that Mary is a ninja and Mrs. Hudson is the widow of a drug dealer and Irene Adler is a dominatrix, and that Mycroft and Moriarty were . . . whatever that was that those terrible terrible actors, Mark Gatiss and Andrew Scott tried to portray.

When I first heard about a new Sherlock Holmes television show several years ago, to be produced by BBC Wales, I was thrilled. Ive been an avid reader and collector of literally thousands of stories about the original true Holmes since I was a boy in the 1970s. (Ive even written some Holmes stories and novels, and edited a lot of other Holmes anthologies.) Soon, in spite of my initial enthusiasm, I was disappointed to see that this new show was going to be set in modern times. This has been done before in several films, so it was not a new or original idea  do these clowns have any original ideas? Additionally, there have been shows such as House that lift many Sherlockian aspects, giving us even more versions of a modern Holmes. The thing these modern versions have in common is that they are not actually about Sherlock Holmes, a character born in the 1850s, and working as a consulting detective in the Victorian and Edwardian ages. These modern takes are instead about a character that has the same name, a few personality quirks, and little else.

Of course, when I first saw Sherlock I was mightily disappointed. Still, Im just one voice, and it went on to be wildly popular, with many people arguing that it didn't matter if it was set in the correct era, as long as the characters had the correct names. I have to disagree with that. As Ive explained before elsewhere: Imagine a new movie re-make featuring a character named Luke Skywalker, who lives in a dusty desert Old West town and meets a crazy old prospector/ex-soldier named Ben Kenobi. They find out about a girl that needs to be rescued, and they hire a roguish wagon driver, Hans, and his big hairy unintelligible tobacco-chewing side-kick (named Chew Bacer) to take them somewhere. Then, there is some big-shot with a pun-like name similar to Darth Vader who has a Death Train  kind of like the one in the Lone Ranger movie  and so on. The character names are the same or very similar, and there are all sorts of winks and nods to the original fans, showing that the creators are very familiar with the original material  as the Bard said, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose  but if its not actually set in the stars, then it isn't Star Wars anymore.

As the show Sherlock progressed, many people who had initially enjoyed it came to dislike it, as it wandered farther and farther from Sherlock Holmes, becoming a shrine to how clever Gatiss and Moffat think they are. As things stand following their desecration, Holmes is a drug addict murderer and Mary Watson is a global assassin. How does that fit at all with the true Canon?

When it was first teased that there was going to be a stand-alone episode of the show, in what came to be The Abominable Bride, setting Holmes and Watson back in the correct Victorian era, I was cautiously optimistic. Gatiss and Moffat stated in interviews that they had the chance to film Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Holmes and Watson the way they were supposed to be, back to basics. Photos were released throughout the process showing the actors in period costume and on appropriate sets. Over and over, it was indicated that this was going to be a unique episode, wherein Holmes and Watson would be in the correct time period, with no explanation whatsoever. It would be completely separate from the modern-day version, which had concluded Season 3 by sending Sherlock, that modern-day alternate universe simulacrum of the true Holmes, into exile following his cold-blooded murder of a rich criminal.

On the night of the premiere, January 1st, 2016, the episode ran in England five hours before appearing in the U.S. Before the 9pm showing here in the U.S., I had four emails from friends warning me, including one that indicated there were some modern aspects. However, we settled in to watch. The first hour was okay. It was exceptionally well filmed, I didn't mind some of the snappy in-joke dialogue, and I didn't object to the film techniques of reenacting the crimes as seen from the sitting room, or having Holmes grab the floating newspaper articles in his mind. I thought that was the modern part that I had been told/warned about.

And then, at around the one hour mark, that exceptionally terrible actor  and I cant overstate that fact enough, hes simply awful  Andrew Scott, shows up as a Moriarty hallucination. The room starts to shake and rock, and suddenly were back on the airplane in modern times, where Season 3 left off. My blood pressure spiked in anger so much that my head hurt, and  to paraphrase a character in A Study in Scarlet  I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me. Actually, I didn't have a nose bleed, but I probably needed to.

For it turned out that Gatiss and Moffat had  no surprise here  proven to be liars.

The next half hour devolved into a mess in which Holmes was drug-hallucinating the whole 1890s segment in order to figure out how Moriarty in the present had supposedly survived. It then went through a whole round-about of dreams within dreams  a concept blatantly stolen from Inception  and alternate realities wherein the modern version might be a story told by the 1890s Holmes or the 1890s version might be a drug hallucination from the present  a concept blatantly stolen from a Deep Space 9 episode, and probably a number of other things blatantly stolen that I don't even recognize.

In the end, I wasn't surprised, as Gatiss and Moffat just cant help themselves. I don't watch Doctor Who, but I can only imagine the pain felt by some of those true fans as these people ruin their character too. I do know that when Gatiss adapted the Poirot episode The Big Four, he stated that the novel that it was based on was an almost unadaptable mess. He certainly unadapted it, all right. In fact, he ruined it. There were parts of it that should NOT have been changed or eliminated, but of course he did. Theres a reason certain books and characters are beloved across generations, and it constantly amazes me that script writers like Gatiss think that they can do better than the original authors when messing up original material that has millions of loyal followers for a reason.

 The Abominable Bride can only be rewatched if one only views the 1890s segments that relate to the Ricoletti investigation  most of the first hour, and a very few pieces from the last half-hour  ignoring the modern dreck tacked on to it. Ive had to do this kind of thing before. For instance, Ive re-read several times the first two chapters of The Last Sherlock Holmes Story by Michael Dibdin, but I go no further, as the rest of the book is a spurious addition that only damages Holmes. The same is true for Sherlock  To paraphrase Doyle: It takes peoples minds from better things.

No one needs to see Mr. Cumberbatch say something snarky or cute while wearing a cool coat. I could not care less specifically about Benedict Cumberbatch, et al. Ive never in my life watched a film or TV show just because it had a certain actor in it. I watch for characters. It doesnt matter to me if Indiana Jones is played by Harrison Ford or Sean Patrick Flanery or River Phoenix, as long as they get the character of Indiana Jones right. Cumberbatchs Holmes was almost right for 2/3s of The Abominable Bride, as close as some other actors have come, and the whole thing could have been really great  the first time that Cumberbatch had actually played the true Holmes on screen  but then they went off in the weeds. And then they went off a cliff. And the episodes that followed simply became too loathsome for even many crazed fans. This sickening show should die.

Gatiss and Moffat claim to respect The Canon, and that there would be no modern adaptations, as they wanted to direct people back to the originals. But they had no problems putting out their terrible versions as comics, and also defiling the original stories by putting out versions with Cumberbatch and Bilbo Baggins on the cover. Hypocrites to the end.

Tell Gatiss and Moffat I said so. Tell them I hate their stinking show and what they're trying to do to the True Sherlock Holmes. Tell them to go try to ruin something else instead.",1514592000,2,9037,4.637445209768315

I am especially drawn to the writers' and actors' ability to seamlessly blend humor with often dark themes. If you're new to the show, give yourself a full season to absorb the subtleties of the overarching themes and key relationship elements. Every episode seems to advance these larger scale story lines while advancing in complex and creative ways through the more immediate stories (the case focus for the episode). There are enough unexpected twists and delightful turns to make both the immediate narrative and the larger themes advance very seamlessly. And there are always cliffhangers to keep you guessing!

Edgy as always, I am writing about Episode 101 (Miss Me?) - I thought it was a bit much, but it did bring into play future plots for this season, or at least topics that will need to be addressed: Is Moriarty back? Did John have an affair? Will Sherlock learn his lesson from Norberry?

The writers definitely like the Hollywood shoot 'em up action - I suppose modernizing Sherlock meant that we would have to address the more violent world we live in with its proliferation of weapons, terrorism and access to explosives, but I always loved the Sherlock Holmes that applied his undeniable observation skills with his immense knowledge of the arcane to bring about the resolution of the problem.
So, I am interested to see how this season unfolds - hopefully it will be a chess match and not plot twists involving old ladies and revolvers.",1483401600,,915,4.573170731707317

Like any other performer not reined in by a good director, B.C. indulges here in overacting and histrionics.  The manic ""solution"" in the wedding scene is so over the top and dizzying it inspires nausea, not awe.  Mary, a VERY minor character in the Doyle novels, is given way too much importance, and now in the next season we can look forward to the cozy domesticity of Mary and Watson having a.....wait for it, wait for it....baby!

5848773,5,B00DRDBTT8,"First I decided Jeremy Brett was the best Sherlock Holmes on the screen, then Johnny Lee Miller, then Benedict Cumberbatch, but now I think it's Jeremy Brett for the first season, before he put too much Brett into the character.  There's nothing wrong with Cumberbatch's interpretation - well, there is: he's just not fastidious enough for my taste.  Holmes of the penny dreadful stories is nothing if not fastidious.  I see him on the floor, examining a clue no one else can even see, then when he stands up, he's still clean, as if he had just stepped out of the entrance to 221B.  He is never called Sherlock, his name is ""Holmes.""  But Cumberbatch revels in the behaviors that make one dirty.  He may be Sherlock, but he is not Holmes.
Martin Freeman's Watson, however, is far and away the best Watson I have ever seen, better that I could have imagined after at least a dozen bumbling, moronic Watsons we seem to have been gifted with over the years.  Freeman's Watson is courageous,, intelligent, but injured by the horrors of war, and with the need for action that life with Holmes offers.  Absolutely the best, a match for Sherlock in every way except Watson has a moral compass that Sherlock seems to lack.
To say Cumberbatch's Sherlock was not my favorite Holmes is not to say that I didn't thoroughly enjoy every minute of every episode in three seasons of the show, I was completely involved, entangled, addicted to the show.  And while I was watching, I thought Cumberbatch had the character down pat, but in retrospect I can't say he was ""better"", just new and different, and unfortunately, like a child who doesn't mind getting muddy as he splashes through the puddles after a rain.
So...  An excellent re-interpretation of the iconic detective Sherlock Holmes, excellent in all aspects save one, and Benedict Cumberbbatch is an excellent, award worthy actor who's immersion in the character of Sherlock the hyper-intelligent man, stuck developmentally at twelve years old, who's exuberant pursuit of accurate explanations of reality lead to wonderful stories for us to watch unfold.  I will watch them again, and possibly again, and enjoy every minute.  You should too.",1475798400,12,2185,4.859838274932614

Sexual content and profanity peppers the dialog leaving me once again wondering what audience the BBC had in mind with this reboot.  It's not surprising to me that the series were brief.

The action is incredibly fast; the logic is impeccable but inscrutable at times; and the guy playing Sherlock in superb.  Intensity is the best overall word I can use to describe the series.  There are three seasons, each with three episodes.  A fourth season will soon be filmed.  Start with Season 1, episode 1, A Study in Pink.  Marilyn and I couldn't keep up our one--a-week goal.  We watched them all much quicker.  I bought them on Amazon but I'm sure you can watch them through one of the video services.  We're looking forward to season four.",1461715200,,718,4.619047619047619

Other reviewers said this was the version to have, as the unedited BBC version. Maybe, I don't know, I only watched it on Netflix. I will be getting the first two seasons too and watching carefully for anything further. The scripts are awesome and fresh, the pacing and camera work great and intersting, and the casting superb. Not gorey but enough chase scenes and action to suit anybody. LOvE It.

5848862,2,B00DRDBTT8,"These episodes of Sherlock Holmes started wonderfully.  Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent Sherlock, kind of in the Basil Rathbone mold -- prickly but brilliant.  The initial episodes delivered what new Sherlock Holmes stories should be -- original intricate crime stories solved by genius and uncanny attention to detail.  Third season has seen the quality of the crimes and crime solving fall flat entirely.  The last episode is perhaps the ultimate example.  There is next to no crime solving, and not really even any crime.  In the end Sherlock realizes he has made a huge mistake and simply shoots an innocent man to get out of the situation.  That is not the Sherlock Holmes character in any way shape or form, nor was it very entertaining to watch.  These episodes are rare as rubies get made sporadically in small batches.  Given that, the quality should be excellent.  I hope it improves.",1456617600,2,899,4.933333333333334

I love how the show explored everybody's theories of how Sherlock faked his own death  yet did not actually reveal it. I love how everyone's life had moved on while Sherlock was gone  in significant ways. It seemed as if Watson and Molly would not have found serious partners had Sherlock been in their lives. He is completely self-absorbed but such a larger than life figure that anyone who cares for him would have had no room for other serious relationships.

My daughter introduced me to this show, and I watched S1 and S2 just before S3 came out. Then watched S3 three times before going back and watching S1, S2 and S3 together. Have since watched S3 again.  I'll probably watch S3 at least a couple more times waiting for Season 4 to come out. Never gets old.

5849011,2,B00DRDBTT8,"Living abroad I saw the first two seasons and absolutely loved this series.  The first two seasons were clever, smart, entertaining, exciting and left you wanting more.  This season falls far short (the third show in this season recovers a little).  I am stunned by the positive reviews of this season.  The actors are once again awesome, the problem is the muddling of the story line and some very painful jumping around.  The first episode is almost exclusively reconciling what happened to Sherlock at the end of season two and Sherlock and Watson dealing with his return (you should not attempt to watch this season without viewing the others first).  The story jumps back and forth through boring and disorganized timelines.  Mild spoiler: at one point Sherlock draws a mustache on himself and attempts a French accent to let Watson know he is alive.  Painful.  The second episode is equally disorganized and for some reason they are infatuated with jumping timelines.  I had to fast forward through one part: mild spoiler: Sherlock has to give a best man speech.  Yeah, it's as painful as you would imagine.  Too make it worse the story keeps jumping between his agonizing speech and other scenes.  Finally, episode three shows some signs of life and there is actually some deducing and storyline.  If you loved season one and two, I would go for this and suffer through the awkward moments.  If you only liked the first two seasons, I would skip this.  I really hope there is a season four and the talent and potential of this show can recover.",1436659200,,1551,4.774436090225564

In order to get the best experience from watching season 3, you need to watch season 1 and 2 (especially) to get the full understanding of what's going on and the full development of each character. I also recommend buying/watching only the UK version of Sherlock as American PBS edits the show before it airs.

I will say, though, that while I'm still a fan, season 3 isn't my favorite (I've watched the others multiple times) but if you're going to collect the seasons of Sherlock on DVD, your collection wouldn't be complete without the original UK version.",1433116800,,734,4.511278195488722

Seasons 1 & 2 had me riveted, on the edge of my seat - deliciously ENTERTAINING!! (perfect balance of whimsical-GORE-intrigue).
Trust me, I wouldn't be caught dead viewing soap operas OR  daytime TV -- SEASON 3  DVD 2, sort of, gave off that effect.
Its worth noting..... I  ENJOYED IMMENSELY ' DVD 1'  of SEASON 3.....TOP NOTCH ACTING BY ALL~~ SOUNDTRACK ROCKS!
However... Characters re-emerging from the dead, etc....somewhat annoying (predictable)  -One character returning from the afterlife
is tolerable  --More than that can't be taken seriously.....Still PLEASED to have mini-series in my collection  --Watch them over & over!
*Personal opinion in respect to John's  (Martin Freeman) love interest in season 3 --no chemistry....Ooops ... Just found out she is his real life partner... LOL  .....

Most of the first episode had plot points lifted from the internet fan sites, with zero credit given to those that came up with the theories. While many people think it's clever and a nice nod to the fans, it came off as lazy and a get-out-of-jail-free card so Moffat wouldn't need to come up with his own survival technique for Sherlock.

Those involved have done an outstanding job of bringing Sherlock Holmes and John Watson into the 21st century.  The Moriarty character was a bit over the top but I guess this nerdy guy could be a master criminal just because he is so intelligent and amoral.

5849166,4,B00DRDBTT8,"I really loved the first and second series of Sherlock. I had high expectations for the third season. The strength of the previous series has been the acting, the production, and the scripts and plots. In the third series the plots don't work out in such a satisfying manner as in the first two. The real disappointment is the first episode as Moffat and Gatiss try to explain how Sherlock survived falling from the top of St. Bart's. Sir Arthur Conan DOyle never tried to explain the survival of his Sherlock but this isn;t really an option for this version. What they came up with wasn't very satisfactory to me. This is more a problem inherent in the medium but it shows how hard it is to get out of a hole you've already dug for yourself when the viewer can see and remember the details of the previous series (a 7/10 at best for this). The second episode with Dr. Watson's marriage was bland and was rescued by Sherlock's best man's speech.
The best episode is the last episode. The viewer learns more about the past of Mary. The episode also touches upon the role of the media in ruining the lives of both public and private individuals. The villain is exquisitely played by Lars Mikkelsen and surely owes something to Elliott Carver and a lot to the reputation of Rupert Murdoch. The malevolent power and influence an unfettered, barely ethical media organisation can bring to bear is eerily reminiscent of Murdoch's News Organisation as explained by Nick Davies in ""Hack Attack"". In Sherlock the  good guys win, in Britain the villain triumphs; how's that for irony.
So the final episode is the best one and fully up to the expectations of Sherlock's many fans. If you can look at the other episodes as filler until the final episode they are still enjoyable but the final episode is a true return to glory for this series",1423958400,2,1830,4.5963302752293576

5849171,5,B00DRDBTT8,"As soon as I saw the first season, I became hooked on this show. It has to be one of the cleverest, freshest shows on TV.  Benedict Cumberbatch portrays a very quirky Sherlock, and Martin Freeman makes a great side-kick as Dr. John Watson.  The shows are modern interpretations of the original books, and are very interesting;  I only wish there were more shows each season.  I highly recommend the series to anyone who enjoys a great mystery/crime drama.",1423612800,,455,4.7215189873417724

5849174,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This third season of Sherlock and Watson as lived present day loses none of its incredible panache. The biggest difference is that by now both actors are on the verge of great success, not only Bernard C. Matin Freeman, who plays Watson, went on to play the villain you love to hate in the 2014 American tv series of ""Fargo"". Bernard meanwhile kept adding on the expert film roles, including playing master spy code maker Alan Turing. The two of them by no means gave short shrift to this season of Sherlock, however. It opens with the terrific episode where Watson thinks Sherlock has been dead for the past two years. The two stars also show the great comedic rapport and timing needed to bring off this episode which has Watson furious with Holmes for tricking him.. We now have an American series which does a modern Holmes but no one can ever take it away from these two that they did the Holmes epsiodes in modern form firstand with spectacular style.",1423353600,,957,4.569767441860465

5849176,1,B00DRDBTT8,"It's always disappointing to see a masterpiece be turned into uber crap! That's what's happened here. I think the producers/writers forgot what show they were working on - Dr Who or Sherlock - when they were conceiving series 3. Matt Smith could have easily delivered Benedict Cumberbatch's lines in the recent episodes. I swear having the TARDIS appear on Baker Street and Clara popping out to greet Holmes and Watson would have felt less weird than viewing some of the latest offerings! Eg Sherlock's God-awful best man's speech at Watson's wedding, Mary's sociopath assassin past coming to light (BTW this was the greatest mystery of the season), Sherlock's cold blooded murder of Magnussen - WTF???

Benedict Cumberbatch was absolutely incredible.  So many plot twists that kept me on the seat of my chair.  I really hated for Season 3 to end.

As a child, I watched the old-school Sherlock Holmes TV shows and movies with him. The Benedict Cumberbatch version is a refreshing adaptation of Holmes, one that my father and I welcomed. This season does not disappoint. In the beginning, we see a Watson who is attempting to move on with his life after witnessing the ""death"" of Sherlock, while unaware that Sherlock is in fact, very much alive.

Also, that Mary could so intimately know SH's chest physiology to place a bullet so precisely, was ridiculous.  Really hope the writer can get back on track.",1414627200,,412,4.54054054054054

5849343,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I must start my review of the Sherlock Holmes series, by saying that I have all the movies made of Sherlock Holmes starting with the Movies starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce up to and including Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. They were and are very good however I just finished watching Sherlock Holmes Seasons 1 thru 3, for the 3rd time and found season #3, the most difficult one to keep up with.
  It was very good, and I hope there will be more of Sherlock made, but parts of it just about drove me nuts in trying to keep up with all of the twists and turns that it has. Regardless of the movies that I, and I have many, I buy them for enjoyment of them, as well as knowledge that comes from them. But not to drive myself crazy in trying to figure out who and why someone would set out to so much into them as to make me feel ignorant, at times. No offense to anyone, but I like to get some enjoyment out of things and not have to analyze each and every scene with my minds microscope. Please don't think I did not enjoy #3, because I did, and I will continue to buy any future Season's made, but if I want to befuddle my brain, all I really need do is to go into Politics to get so confused.  ""Tongue in Cheek"" is how I am saying this last part. Thank you Amazon for really making me think more than I anticipated I'd have.

It was without a doubt the BEST modernized Sherlock ever.  This third season, for me, was a bitter disappointment.  It lacks the depth of understanding and respect for the original Arthur Conan Doyle characters and plots that was evident in the first two seasons.  The acting is as excellent as ever, but the writing is not up to snuff and the special effects do not make up for the lack of true Holmesian detection and character interplay.  In fact, I found the odd use of camera angles, special effects, and 'time splicing' distracting.  Had this been the first season of Sherlock I viewed I would not have bothered with the other two, and would have missed a great treat!  I know many people have had nice things to say about this season, but if you are a hard core Holmes fan I cannot recommend it.

The rest of the cast works well in the show and each bring something to the table.  One thing us fans wish that the series would have more than 3 episodes and there is a year between each season.

5849444,4,B00DRDBTT8,"I LOVED the first 2 seasons, and waiting so long for Season 3 was tough.

Glad to have another 3 episodes finally...but really, I have to agree with the other reviewers who say that head writer Stephen Moffat (who also writes Dr Who--which says everything you need to know) is just over his head and has exceeded the limit of his abilities.
Killing off Sherlock in the end of Season 2 was already a Dr Who-ish sort of writing stunt. I don't watch Dr Who precisely because it's full of this sort of boringly sloppy writing--characters are killed off amid many press releases, then they are brought back, then killed again, a constant rinse and repeat that just does not work for entertainment for grown up adults.

I was hoping Moffat had something smarter in mind than just another 'Hello I'm back!"" resurrection a la Dr Who, but no. I suppose he sees no reason why SHERLOCK fans won't settle for the same kiddy-show stunts the BBC lets him get away with on Dr Who. Annoying, and boring, and I'm losing interest in the series. I'm in no hurry for Season 4 and more Dr. Who-isms.

And as other reviewers have noted, Moffat just can't write for women. Bringing in the future Mrs. Watson was inevitable, and Watson's real life actress wife is a nice touch, and fun to know they're really partnered in real life.
But an ex-CIA hit woman, who just 'happens' to meet and fall for Watson? Incredibly unlikely--another Dr Who standard tactic.

And the final episode, in which Mary first sends Sherlock to Intensive Care and Sherlock then shoots the bad guy in front of a dozen LEO witnesses come to arrest him anyway--this is Dr. Who on steroids.
It's worse than sloppy. In a show about 'fetishizing Genius', it's just stupid. Dr. Who-kiddy-show-stupid.

Come Season 4, Moffat may resurrect the baddie, and seems already scripted to resurrect the same Moriarty we watched blow his brains out literally in Sherlock's face.
Moffat will probably kill Mary off, then bring her back, and by the Season 4 Finale it will be time for Moffat to kill off Sherlock again--with a closing shot that shows he's still alive. Once again.

If I wanted that, I'd watch Dr. Who (which I outgrew at age 11). Moffat has gotten away with it (and gotten lavishly paid and idolized as well) for his entire writing career. I doubt he knows any other way to write--and after all, it's paid very well so far.

So I am on the verge of being done with the Sherlock series. I doubt it will ever again rise to the sheer brilliance of the Irene Adler episode.
And I suspect I'm one of millions who are ready to say 'thanks for two great seasons' and tune out next year.
Honestly, there is totally amateur Fanfic out there on the Sherlock! blogs that seems better written than Moffat's third season.

By the way, the US broadcast versions ARE edited. The UK versions have additional minutes whose loss does diminish the US versions. Remember UK discs are not usually compatible on US players unless you have a multi-regional player (check first).
NOTE: THIS IS THE UK VERSION DISC, not the US compatible disc.

So I loved the first two seasons, but 3 was a disappointment. I do hope Moffat can regain the brilliance of Season 2. Maybe it's time to bring back Miss Adler for Round 2...

Hope this is helpful. Fingers crossed for Season 4.",1410048000,,3296,4.590136054421769

5849455,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The writers and producers of SHERLOCK took a chance in Season 1 by creating a completely quirky yet fantastic version of a modern Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) and John Watson (Martin Freeman). With SHERLOCK becoming a worldwide season, the writers handled Season Three with more daring pizzazz and excitement than the previous 2 seasons combined. SHERLOCK only gets better and when you think it can't be outdone, the writers take us in a completely unexpected direction.
There are only three episodes this season but they are extended episodes that are almost like self-contained films. As we know from the end of Season 2, Sherlock Holmes ""died"" from a fall, yet as a teaser we know in the last minutes that he is very much alive. Season Three begins two years later as Watson is still grieving the ""loss"" of his friend. Easing his pain is Watson's new love Mary Morstan (played by Martin Freeman's real-life partner Amanda Abbington). Sherlock reappears in an amazing scene and well, now there are three main players.
There never has been such a n off-beat and comedic version of Sherlock and Watson as in this brilliant BBC series. These two maintain a love/hate releationship that only depends by the minute. There is a just the right amount of intrigue peppered with comedic interaction. The cast is cleaning enjoying this show. Kudos to Una Stubbs as the confused but loveable landlady Mrs. Hudson and to Louise Brealey as Molly Hopper, the pathologist with a longing for Sherlock. There are so many cast members to praise. All are a pure delight on screen.
Adding to the comedy is the Sherlock Holmes fan club members trying to figure out how Sherlock faked what about to be a genuinely real death. The writers, no doubt, had fun with this story line.
Episode 3, ""HIS LAST VOW"" takes us further into the story that could ever be imagined. Be prepared for a major story twist and a life-changing event for Sherlock that only he can brush off in his most quirky way. The twist is so shocking and so surprising and it it is all explained with surprising finesse by the writers. Add in the mysterious Charles Augustus Magnessen who has secrets on just about everyone. Lars Mikkelsen plays Magnessen with a cool, conniving manner that is rarely seen. Again, here is a cast that enjoys every second of their roles.

Benedict Cumberbatch is a complete revelation, and I love his characterization just as much in this season as Season 1, though I do feel like this season was so much different, and I love how it explores Sherlock and Watson's relationship more in-depth. I enjoy that each episode is like a mini movie, else the episodes would get so choppy with having to air each week with more episodes.

5849542,3,B00DRDBTT8,"I just finished watching all 3 seasons of Sherlock and I must admit that is was... not as good as I have heard. I am going to review the entire series. I am going to be very honest. I am not a hipster, nor do I have some bizarre notion that if the show comes from BBC it is automatically better than those found in the US. I am fair and I believe a show must pass on its own merit, not on how cool I will seem for liking it.
First, the good- and there is quite a lot of it. The show is a good one. True to form, BBC assembles a terrific crew with top notch costuming, set designs, and music. It is beautiful to look at and hear. It offers a modern update to the Victorian world of Sherlock Holmes that possesses to-the-moment technological savvy. It works this well, capitalizing on how the original tales displayed a hero who used any and all methods to solve crime.
The cast, too, is fantastic. Benedict Cumberbatch is far better than I expected. He is funny, sharp, and sells the audience on his crazy intellect. He even, once or twice, manages to make Holmes a fully realized character who is more than his rudeness and brilliance. Though- for the most part he is simply a superhero with no tact. Oh, and the 'mind palace' stuff is dreadful and the creators of the show need to forget about it.
Martin Freeman truly shines. His all-too-human Watson is magnetic and immediately accessible. He elevates the show as the single best performer on it. His performance, more than the writing or Cumberbatch's performance, truly grounds the show and makes it seem plausible.
Also outstanding are Mark Gatiss as Mycroft Holmes, Laura Pulver as Irene Adler (though she is woefully under-used), and Amanda Abbington as Mary Watson (though the plot twist surrounding her at the end of season 3 is so awful that it is painful to watch).
The writing for the show, overall, is deeply at odds with itself. The dialog is great and the characterization of most of the players is enjoyable. However, the mysteries aren't particularly hard to deduce. In some cases, they are telegraphed so blatantly that one wonders how stupid Holmes, et al, must be not to see it. The pacing is uneven as well. Too often, a great deal of time is spent in setting up the problem, which is then solved in the final 10 minutes of the show. That is a problem easily overlooked, however, since most mysteries similarly suffer. What haunts Sherlock is that its character moments are too clever for its own good. They are great moments. Brilliant, as a matter of fact, but the writers know it and they dwell on it. This leads to the plot of the episode almost always getting set aside for long tracts of witty banter. It is as if the show gets distracted by its own cleverness. Fortunately, the clever is very, very clever.
So, the show is excellent. 4 to 5 stars depending upon the episode (well, the pilot is a weak link, 3 for it, but it IS a pilot and they are almost universally weak, so slack should be cut).
BUT
The bad guys in this show are crap. Everything good about the show is in its heroes. As soon as the big bads show up, the but starts to smell up the room.
Laura Pulver is the sole exception. Her Catwoman-ish turn as Irene Adler is excellent and she departs the show far too soon.
Lars Mikkelsen is Magnussen in season 3 and while his performance cannot be faulted, the writing for the character is pathetic. He is described by all parties as brilliant and yet when he actually shows up and begins talking, he comes across as petty, insipid, and idiotic. He literally stupids his way to defeat, obviously handing over to the heroes many great reasons to dispose of him and not one for his keeping. It is blunderingly ridiculous.
The villains from A Study in Pink, The Hounds of Baskerville, and The Sign of Three are adequate to the tale at hand, to be sure, but easily forgotten.
The biggest but, and the show's weakest link, is Andrew Scott as Moriarty. Holmes' most notorious villain is here notorious for all the wrong reasons.
I should first say that the part is disastrously written, lacking any menace or subtlty whatsoever. In fact, the role lacks almost all intelligence, as Moriarty comes across as an idiotic drama queen most of the time (In all fairness, his robbery/prison escape/trial plot in the second season was brilliant). That much is not Scott's fault. An actor can only do so much with a crap role (witness Cumberbatch as Kahn, for example).
However, Scott chews the scenery with a ravenous display of campy overacting that would make the cast of the 1966 Batman blush. His choices as an actor reduce the poorly written lines he is delivering into obnoxiousness so overwhelming that I'd likely give the show 2 stars if it were not for his lack of on-screen time. Barbarian Queen II has finer performances. Somehow he won awards for this mess. Don't let those little statues impress you, though. This one's as ill-deserved as handing out a knighthood to Guy Fawlkes.
So, overall, the show is great, but for its villains. Still, it was entertaining enough to make me watch all 3 seasons and be curious about season 4, though with Moriary's unfortunate return I'm not too curious. I guess it boils down to this:
The hype is more impressive than the show.",1406073600,2,5252,4.535300316122234

The idea of a human being solving crimes with his mind and not needing all the lab equipment of CSI or Major Crimes is great to watch. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because I think seasons 1 and 2 were better. This Watson is a lot like the current movie version of Watson . He can fight, he can shoot and he has a love life. The character development is much deeper in season 3 than it was in seasons 1 and 2. The surround characters in this Sherlock are plus and not a detraction from the show. I also enjoy the different places that Sherlock goes to solve crimes in the series.

How? By turning the tables on Sherlock by placing him into social situations in which he is out of his depth. In fact, when I first saw it on TV, I was almost thrown by the different emotional tenor of Season Three, but after I got in on DVD and was able to watch each new episode closely, I liked it even better than the first two seasons, which I would not have believed possible. I don't know how the writers, actors, directors, cinematograhers, editors, and producers are going to top themselves in future, but I am certainly looking forward to seeing them try.",1404345600,,822,4.598639455782313

The British dialogue is so witty and fast that I didn't realize that I had missed some of the jokes.  Season 3 is about changes in John Watson's personal life and Sherlock's evolution as a human being.  We get to see sides of Mycroft that we haven't seen before.

5849608,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Possibly one of the most artful and well-done series in the history of TV, series three was a long-awaited addition to the two previous seasons, both of which have already been acclaimed by both critic and viewer alike. The was very, very little I could find wrong in and of the show itself. Further, in-depth analysis follows.

Sherlock Holmes, portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch
I have to say that Mr. Cumberbatch is perfect for the role of Sherlock Holmes. While Moffat's Holmes differs from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's interpretation, the change is pulled off flawlessly, resulting in, as Holmes puts it, 'A highly-functioning sociopath.' His quirks, ranging from microwaving human eyeballs for an experiment to keeping entire human heads in the freezer for study, are one of the most entertaining things in the entire show. Utterly cold and detached one moment, and then completely and utterly vulnerable, it seems a realistic depiction of how a true-to-life Sherlock would be received: suspicion, caution, doubt verging on cruelty at times. Mr. Cumberbatch's Holmes has the ability to smile, yet be icy at the same time. Even as possibly the most annoying little git to ever walk the face of the planet, you can't help but fall in love with his cluelessness and eclectic nature... but most of all, by the wonderfully-pulled off genius. A fully platable, excelling rendition of Sherlock Holmes.

John Watson, portrayed by Martin Freeman
While the show may be primarily about Sherlock Holmes, Dr. John Watson is a crucial, vital aspect in the show's success. While previous Watsons have been bland and rather tasteless to compare to the brilliant Holmes, this Watson is a different type of contrast, putting a massive intellect to a large heart and cold logic to courage and reliability. It is still a contrast... but one of a much different kind. John Watson is not just the sidekick here: he's a fully-fledged working partner, and perfectly capable on his own. A war veteran of Afghanistan and an army doctor, he compels you to love him through a combination of his pugnacious nature, his before-mentioned big heart, and the array of sweaters (more on that later). Martin Freeman is the sort of actor that can pull off in a glance what others have to use a full paragraph of speech to adequately convey. His performance grows only better, leading up to the climax of 'The Reichenbach Fall' in season two. So far, Mr. Freeman's Watson is by far the best and most realistic portrayal of the character I have seen yet.

Supporting characters
Where to start? There is not one of the side characters I do not like the portrayal of. (While some I may actively dislike, they are all pulled into play admirably well.) Molly Hooper, a minor character in season one, has grown in leaps and bounds since. I cannot wait to see where she heads from here. DI Lestrade, and his constant ability to put up with all of the crap Sherlock dishes out to him, is not at all the bumbler that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle makes him to be, but instead a reasonably smart, competent man who is never out of his depth for a sarcastic comment or jibe. James Moriarty is possibly the most fun I've ever had just watching a villain at work: a genius, a madman, but so gleeful and fun at the same time that I almost wanted to dance about when he came on the screen, so excellent was his appearance. While I cannot say that I'm fond of Irene Adler in any sense, the class and grace with which she is pulled off is perfect for her role: a resourceful, cunning dominatrix. Mrs. Hudson, the landlady, is just about as sweet as anyone hoping to tangle with Sherlock Holmes can be, but there is still some inexplainable sense of grit to her despite the motherliness. Cynical and brilliant yet entertaining, Mycroft Holmes deserves every second of his screen time. And last but not least, Anderson. Oh, Anderson. We hated you at the end of season two, but somehow you became the symbol of the fans for season three. I think that a lot of people owe Mr. Anderson an apology.

The plot
The crimes can be complex and baffling, but the plot is anything but. Only fairly stupid people would have a hard time following it. I enjoyed (in a horrible, masochistic sort of way) every twist and turn that the episodes led me on. Well constructed and almost perfectly rigged to come crashing down with full emotional force upon the viewers.

The soundtrack
Let us hear it for the musical masterminds that created this particular one. From the sad John Waston theme to the Deduction theme to the Chase theme to the utterly impeccable Main Theme, the music is never anything but spot on, always perfect for the setting and brilliantly executed as such.

The costume design
There are many, many geniuses at work on the set of 'Sherlock', and yet somehow this ones never seems to get mentioned. Well, it's high time she did. This wonderful costume designer has brought up everything from Sherlock's black overcoat and scarf to the widely-praised purple shirt to John's array of jumpers and his jacket to impeccable Westwoods and Anderson's cleverly fan-girl ensemble. So tasteful and well done that it could almost be the best part.

The writing
Where to start? At times, the dialogue is suspenseful and even chilling. At other times, it can actually make you roar out loud with laughter. It makes you weep and feel dead inside, or it can touch you in ways that you never thought possible. Sometimes, it does both. With that in mind, this is my final conclusion for not only Season three, but for the entire show:

Five stars have never been more well-deserved than the one I am giving BBC's 'Sherlock'. The one fault is the quantity of the episodes, and the wait between them. So, we wait for a new season, always hungry for more.",1404259200,4,5774,4.721230158730159
5849609,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I love this show! I wish there were more episodes in a season! Can't want until the next season is out. By far, one of the best shows on TV right now!",1404259200,2,150,3.71875
5849610,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Amazing show- awesome acting- entertaining from start to finish.  This is truly one of my favorite shows, it proves that Masterpiece is so genius in their shows and actors.  I read some of the negative reviews, and I think if you are a true fan of the show, you would have liked this season.  They have to keep us guessing, or else there is no show.  The show is so funny, Cumberbatch and Freeman are so excellent.  I love Mark Gatiss as Mycroft.  I also love that you can watch the shows several times and they are still entertaining.  My only complaint is that we have to wait 2+ years for the next series and we needed more Moriarity this season, although the villian Magnussen was super creepy.  Definitely one of my all time favorites.",1404259200,2,740,4.42962962962963

They stretched an entire season trying to show how smart he is, basically boring us to death with empty dialogs and in the end there was not even one attempt to solve a case.

I really like the way the actors work together; they seem to be real friends.  Adding ""Mary"" and changing the duo to a trio seems fine so far, but the test will be next season.  I am not a purist, so this change and the deviations from the canon don't bother me.  If things were required to remain as they were first created, can you imagine what entertainment would be like?  As Sherlock would say, ""Boring.""  Three cheers for creativity.  Three cheers for the creators, cast, and crew.",1403308800,,606,4.3097345132743365

I couldn't quite get my footing during the first ep (it's different from the earlier eps in ways hard to describe), but I loved it nonetheless. There were parts of the second ep that dragged for me but loved it still. And I hated the very, very, very end of the third ep and yet for me this show's the very best television offers. And I don't feel a bit like I'm settling for less when I say that. It is extraordinary television viewing.

It is important to watch the first two series before watching this one, so if you've not watched series one and two, go do that. Then come back here and share with us your thoughts.",1403222400,,678,4.2153846153846155

5849643,5,B00DRDBTT8,"we have way too many television characters based on the Sherlock Holmes model of insanely smart and socially inept, tops in their fields, types. always above suspicion, supported by an army of loyal friends who 'truly understand them' and working on a fringe of manic and near operatic intensity. this series makes a run at it with some success. we spend a bit too much time looking longingly into the eyes of the men though. a little too much time is spent denying their obvious attraction to each other as the 21st century implication of homosexuality is attributed to their original, pastoral 19th century 'boy's club' which denied the ladies' any sort of reasoning faculties. it's filmed beautifully, Sherlock has millions of hours of film of himself standing alone on craggy rocks, in dark alleys and bombarded by computer text, subtext, overtext etc. much of what passed for a surplus of information in a man's brain 100 years ago is now exemplified though the internet and with the ease of that availability makes Holmes stand out only in quirkiness.",1402704000,,1057,4.910614525139665

5849645,5,B00DRDBTT8,"After a dip in Season 2 it was fantastic to see Holmes and Watson return to form. Ripping good mysteries are only part of the magic Doyle originally created. What makes for an engaging re-imagining or interpretation of this literary gift is the relationship between the consulting detective and retired military doctor. Cumberbatch and Freeman play the relationship for all that its worth including deep affection, co-dependency, ying and yang, sarcastic but never inappropriate homophobia, Batman/Robin and more.

""The Empty Hearse"" is the first episode and it follows Holmes' return to London and the thoroughly enjoyable reunion with John Watson who has thought him dead. The two go on to dispatch an underground terrorist network. In ""The Sign of Three"", Watson and Mary Morstan tie the knot. This episode rang as a bit of a sitcom given the use of flashbacks and heavy handed humour. It was almost as if the series was punning itself. The final episode ""His Last Vow"" leads Holmes into a conflict with Charles Augustus Magnussen. Billed as a ""terrifying"" villain I felt this professional blackmailer a bit wimpy when compared with Moriarity or any other of the baddies the duo has faced...not to mention the fact that Magnussen is completely upstaged by a significant side plot that involved Watson and his wife. The good news is Season Four is well set up with a face-off with Holmes' arch nemesis. The game is afoot, or on, or whatever - just as long as it continues.",1402617600,,1474,4.919678714859438
5849646,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Still my favourite TV series with superb acting and multiple story lines that make you stay on the tele for the entire program.  Refreshing plots and interesting characters are a mainstay of British TV and rarely duplicated in our American ""dumb down"" society.  I especially like the modern twist of putting Sherlock on Twitter, Facebook and other social media.  It's a great show that is intelligent, witty and downright addictive.  Those who don't like it are probably fans of GIlligan's Island.",1402617600,,497,5.098765432098766

5849657,5,B00DRDBTT8,"All things considered, in my opinion this is one of the greatest television series of all time.  There is a reason why there are only 3 episodes per season:  They are so beautifully done that it's the moral equivalent of 3 commercial-free 90-minute films.

The story lines are dutifully reminiscent of Sir Arthur's own, but naturally are updated for modern times.  Exceedingly clever and at subtle wit (even by the highest of British standards) is part and parcel, rearing its head unpredictably, and only rarely cliche.

Cumberbatch plays a better Holmes than Holmes himself could, if he actually existed.  Outside of this series I'm not very big on Freeman (Watson) or Gatiss (Mycroft), but this series simply could not float without them both.  Brealey (Molly) and Stubbs (Mrs. Hudson) are so remarkable that they've been written into all 12 episodes, having originally been slated only for the pilot.  The other supporting characters are not brilliant, just good enough not to detract.

I've re-watched the series a couple of times and it's as marvelous each time as the first.",1402358400,,1081,5.02808988764045

5849668,5,B00DRDBTT8,What can I say?  This is hands down the best TV show out there right next to Downton Abbey.  It actually much better written and the casting is amazing.  Martin Freeman makes a superb Dr Watson and Benedict Cumberbatch lends a commanding presence as always.  Think Khan from the latest Star Trek movie with Chris Pine.

5849676,1,B00DRDBTT8,"*SPOILER ALERT!!!!*  Season 3 ruined Sherlock for me!  Why did this happen?  They completely flushed the show down the toilet.  Like Watson said, aren't there enough psychopaths on the show?  Can't we have one normal, down to earth character?  Is that too much to ask?  Mary represented the one grounded member in this crew of mental patients.  She was a necessary character with a much needed role to play.  You have ""functional sociopath"" Sherlock, war damaged therapy required Watson, druggie stripper Hudson, gay Moriarty, morbidly bizarre Mycroft,anger control problem Lestrade, woman scorned Janine, lesbian dominatrix Irene Adler,....and the list goes on.  Sometimes its hard to watch the show because the characters are so wacky that the crimes don't seem shocking anymore.  That's why I liked the introduction of Mary.  She was cute, maternal, likeable, with quirky wholesome qualities.  She encouraged the friendship of Sherlock and Watson and brought levity and sanity to the show.  Now we find out she's a psychotic mass murderer?  WHY!!  I really liked her the way she was.  She made the group fun, being the possible damsel in distress, but not a slouch.  What worked in the traditional Sherlock Holmes programs was the fact the Sherlock was the only nutcase in the room.  He shocked and surprised everyone around him.  He dashed conventions in genteel England and it was fun watching everyone react to his lunacy.  And Miss Hudson was the lovable, caring foil who reigned Sherlock in when required.  Since we don't have that kind of Miss Hudson in this new incarnation of Sherlock, I was hoping Mary Watson would fill those shoes.  Well, I guess not.",1401840000,14,1665,5.040441176470588

The term ""show"" is actually a bit misleading because every episode clocks in at around 90 minutes and they feel like short films.  Sherlock is well cast, the plots are witty, and the show has a great balance of humor with actual danger.  Unfortunately, Season 3 lost it's way for a bit after a stellar 2 seasons and you never really felt like it found it's footing until the end of the season.

5849694,5,B00DRDBTT8,"BBCs Sherlock is the best TV around  a smart show about a brilliant man.  Each episode is based on one of Conan Doyles original stories about Sherlock Holmes updated with modern twists.  Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect as Sherlock.  The trench coat and flapped cap look like they were made for him.  Where others see problems, his Holmes sees only puzzles that are fun to solve.  Emotionally cold and Aspergerish, he is always at least one step ahead of everyone, and as a viewer you are always jumping to try to keep up.

5849720,5,B00DRDBTT8,"It's been a long wait for Season 3 of the BBC's brilliant revival of Sherlock Holmes, with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman returning from their respective movie careers to renew a priceless partnership as a thoroughly modern Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson.  In the first episode, ""The Empty Hearse"", John Watson is astonished and, well, angry to find out what the audience already knows, that Holmes somehow survived his fatal fall at the end of Season 2.  In fact, this will be become a bit of a running joke, as numerous theories are offered for just how this might have happened, with the truth remaining just out of reach.  In ""The Sign of Three"", Sherlock helps John Watson and his fiance Mary Morstan pull off a madcap wedding, highlighted by Sherlock trying to prevent an inconveniently timed murder.  In the final episode of what we hope is not the last season, Sherlock must find a way to protect those he loves from an evil blackmailer.

This recreation of Holmes and Watson continues to amaze and entertain, with its clever updating of the original Conan Doyle stories and its equally clever portrayal of Holmes' detecting techniques.  The cast of regulars from the first two season is back in harness, of whom Amanda Abbington as Mary Morstan shines as an essential partner to the two men in her life.  As a very special Christmas treat, we the audience will get to meet the parents of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes.

5849735,3,B00DRDBTT8,"The conclusion to season two, titled ""The Reichenbach Fall"" is an amazing episode of television and one of my favorites ever, so naturally my excitement for where this show would go from there was very exciting. Unfortunately, I feel that season three ultimately fell short of its promise. Note that this review is going to have some SPOILERS.

Episodes one, two, and three of this season were all very different in my opinion, but they all had some issues. The first episode primarily focuses on Sherlock's return and how everyone reacts as a result. We get to watch some fun theories play out on screen as a result, but I did have a major problem with the answer we finally got (unless Sherlock was just messing with Anderson, which I'm assuming is not actually true). Part of what made the season two finale so great was that Moriarty had managed to ruin Sherlock's image, so revealing that all of the events that occured in this entire episode were all part of a large group of people's plans was disappointing to find out. Other issues with this episode including a rushed terrorist plotline and some visually stylistic sequences that simply became annoying, although thankfully this issue evaporated in the latter two episodes.

The second episode, while doing a good job at developing Sherlock's character, felt like it had A LOT of filler moments and the overall mystery with the belts was not very interesting. I thought it was the weakest the show has had so far because they seemed to have to really stretch the material to get it to 90 minutes. . Finally, the third episode, though the best of the bunch, had two different disappointing resolutions. The major villain storing all of the information in his mind was a weak reveal, and the fact that Moriarty is still alive is just ridiculous. At this point, ""The Reichenbach"" Fall is basically irrelevant, which is a major disappointment.

Despite all of these problems I had this season, there are still some very great things about Sherlock. The show's sense of humor is still fantastic, and Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman carry this show on their backs and make it enjoyable even when the plot is weak. I personally did not enjoy the character Mary but I understand her purpose. Ultimately, I was more let down with this season because we get so little of this show in such a great amount of time that I feel like we should have accomplished more along the way. If season four does happen, I will continue watching, but this season was a disappointment overall.",1400544000,,2534,4.754545454545455

5849743,5,B00DRDBTT8,"It would be hard to top the second season but the third season gave it a valiant try.

After killing of the protagonist and the antagonist in the third episode of season two so assuredly one could hardly believe it would be possible to resurrect them convincingly. I'm sorry to say it could not be done. The writers had painted themselves so deeply into a corner that it could not be extricated. Then they did a shuffle that made the season one to two segue seem downright plausible.

That said I still found the third season entrancing giving a glimpse into the lighter side of Sherlock and Watson and I am looking forward to the fourth season.

Worst episode of the series so far; CAM.

Bring back Jim Moriarty and Irene Adler Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1400371200,,759,4.684210526315789
5849744,2,B00DRDBTT8,"The writers have taken a new approach.  Less action, more interpersonal B/S.

Season three is more soap opera-ish rather than the fast paced action one is accustomed to
with this series.  At first, the on screen text/editing resembles a Joycean inner monologue, or at the very least,
an instrument to help the audience keep pace. But this season looks inward at the characters.  Watson's previous sweetheart was far more hotter and believable than the covert agent he is enamored with in season three.  The Doctor that
hired him, and covered for him in season two is much more plausible than season three's
sleeper/retired agent.  It is nice to get a female perspective on the pair, yet I for one was disappointed.

True Holmesians desire a fresh spin on Doyle's iconic characters rather than a whole episode devoted to
a wedding toast by Holmes as the best man. Save your time and money for season four, or revisit Doyle's
original story lines with Basil Rathbone and Jeremey Brett on YOUTUBE.  Every DIrector in this genre
seems to take artistic license, but S3 is a bit OTT for a serious opthamologist who played rugby into his 50""s
as Doyle did.

The modern interpretation that Sherlock is a borderline sociopath (making his intellect a part of some neuro-psychological diagnosis) is an interesting position, taken up by many writer/producers today. In this case, they make it work, by offsetting it by Sherlock's immaturity in sharp contrast to Watson's battle scars and sense of duty/honor. A great pair, solving horrible crimes under the specter if Moriarty and the Mycroft, the older Holmes of MI-5. Both using this younger Holmes as a pawn sometimes un-wittingly, sometimes not!

The scripts are amazing, and the acting talents of the principals Benedict Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman, and Amanda Abbington do more than justice to them.  The three episodes are also more tightly correlated with each other than in the previous two seasons, giving the feel of a real trilogy.

5849763,5,B00DRDBTT8,Such amazing writing and fabulous acting makes for an explosive (in a positive manner) entertainment! I have been intrigued by the first episode!,1399939200,,145,5.3478260869565215
5849764,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Can the writers  WRITE?  Can the actors ACT?  OMG Yes, yes, yes.  We laughed, we cried, we watched it over, we thought.  We want more.",1399939200,,134,4.2
5849765,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This is by far the best season.  I never expect what is going to happen next, and yet it makes perfect sense!  Kudos to the writers!",1399939200,,132,4.038461538461538
5849766,5,B00DRDBTT8,"what can i say?  it is all wonderful.  it is everything that we expect from sherlock.  everything was fun, exciting and as always the endings are always a surprise.  a must watch.",1399852800,,179,4.5
5849767,3,B00DRDBTT8,"While they are good episodes,why only 3??? they could have at least made 5 or 6,for this price and 2 dvds  i watched the whole season in 1 night and still caught the local news,season 4 in about a year meanwhile Ripper Street is cancelled way to jump on the screw the consumer bandwagon bbc",1399852800,,290,4.2727272727272725
5849768,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Sherlock is one of the best shows on TV today, definitely worth sitting through 90 minute episodes to see the details unfold at the end. The only problem is there are only 3 episodes per season, which is not nearly enough once you are hooked.",1399852800,,242,4.4
5849769,5,B00DRDBTT8,Love this show!!! So very well written! Only sorry there are not more to watch yet! You feel a little more clever after watching.,1399852800,,129,4.416666666666667
5849770,5,B00DRDBTT8,"One doesn't watch this just to see Sherlock be clever. The  interplay between the actors, the back story, the restraint, all create a richness that is really compelling.",1399852800,,169,5.035714285714286
5849771,5,B00DRDBTT8,This interpretation of Sherlock is edgy and brilliant.  The episode which explains Sherlock's resurrection is one of the best episodes of anything I have ever seen.,1399852800,,164,5.3076923076923075
5849772,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The modern twist to Sherlock Holmes is fun and fast moving. The two principal actors are excellent, playing off each other perfectly. The only criticism would be against the weird twist in the last episode regarding Dr. Watson's wife. Not sure Arthur Conan Doyle would have liked that much.",1399766400,,290,4.938775510204081
5849773,5,B00DRDBTT8,I have been a massive fan of Sherlock since I first discovered season one in 2012! Benedict Cumberbatch & Martin Freeman along with the rest of the cast are incredible! Season 3 was soooooo good! Lars Mikkelson as C.A.M. Was amazing! & John & Mary's wedding combined with a murder investigation was hilarious and intriguing. I recommend this to anyone who loves Sherlock Holmes or mysteries in general! So intricate & brilliant you can't stop watching!!!!,1399766400,,455,5.0
5849774,5,B00DRDBTT8,Very well done series. I wish we had T.V. of this quality in the U.S.All three seasons were equally excellent. I hope they do a fourth season.,1399766400,,142,4.296296296296297

5849776,5,B00DRDBTT8,I love this show! Need to have all seasons available on Prime! More of this kind of stuff is needed.,1399680000,,100,4.05
5849777,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Well they did it again.  Another wonderful series, the writing, acting, sets, editing and directing are just great.  Some series start to slip after a few years but not this one.  We love the series and the addition of Mary into the mix is working very well. We own all three years and look forward to another wonderful year.",1399680000,,325,4.47457627118644
5849778,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Well, this was a departure from the first two seasons and chock full of quick lines and innuendos which took this slow mind two viewings to take all in.  The cast has the best script any actor could wish for and the story line is totally unpredictable which of course makes the show so enjoyable.  Perhaps, at first, season 3 may have been a bit off-putting for its rapid pace delivery and unorthodox presentation (I'm a sedate senior).  I still would have loved to have been part of that wedding or Christmas Day ""family"" celebration!",1399680000,,535,4.610526315789474
5849779,4,B00DRDBTT8,"Excellent! A tad slow and a bit odd at the beginning of each episode, but after that excellent. I can't wait for season four.",1399680000,,125,4.25
5849780,1,B00DRDBTT8,"Loved the first two seasons, this one is just ridiculous! The hoops they jumped through to explain Sherlock surviving his ""suicide"" was beyond my ability to suspend reality--Star Trek seemed more plausible. And of course the leftist Brit writers had to make an ""evil capitalist"" the bad guy--yawn.",1399680000,15,297,5.208333333333333
5849781,5,B00DRDBTT8,A-freakin'-mazing show. The writing is  phenomenal.  The acting is stellar. One of the best shows the BBC has ever made.,1399680000,,120,4.95
5849782,5,B00DRDBTT8,Thank God...Sherlock 3 has been released!!!!!!!! My life is no longer an empty void. This was different from Series 1 and 2  but don't worry....it grows on you the more often you watch it (like 50 times). It did make me nervous to watch Sherlock help Mary with the wedding plans.....is he feeling entirely well?????,1399593600,,315,4.7272727272727275
5849783,5,B00DRDBTT8,What a twist favorite part was Ep. 2 I wanna see the case with the matchboxes. Cannot wait till season 4.,1399593600,,105,4.0476190476190474

5849785,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The season opener did everything to answer the questions of ""how he did it"", and Watson's reaction to Sherlock's return is priceless!",1399593600,,133,5.090909090909091
5849786,5,B00DRDBTT8,"A great show for all the whodunit buffs, I really enjoy the story lines and special effects. Great acting performance from all the cast. Awesome location!",1399593600,,154,4.961538461538462
5849787,5,B00DRDBTT8,This is the best season of the best modern interpretation of the classic stories to date. BBC delivers as usual,1399507200,,111,4.6

5849789,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This one is my favorite and I watch all of them, read a lot of the short stories and books. I feel like the chemistry in this one is great, Myncroft's wit and disdain for Sherlock also comes through better. 5 Stars! Get it while you can, since they are both turning into big stars I don't see more series being produced. Sad really.",1399507200,,332,4.203125
5849790,5,B00DRDBTT8,We are always waiting for new ones to be released.  Really enjoy the relationships in the series.  Cumberbatch is an incredible actor.,1399507200,,134,5.045454545454546
5849791,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Love everything about Sherlock. This show has it all: suspense, wittiness, humor. Oh, and let's not forget Benedict Cumberbatch!! I just hate that there isn't a fourth season out yet!!",1399507200,,184,5.166666666666667
5849792,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I waiteed a yer to get this and loved every minute of it.  Shelock and Watson are back, better and funnier than ever, the resteraunt scence and subsequent face punches from Watson to Holmes had me dying laughing.  I also emjoyed Holmes sterling attempt to be the best man; BBC please make more episodes.",1399507200,,303,4.592592592592593
5849793,5,B00DRDBTT8,"For my money, Sherlock is the best series produced for television EVER.  Not only is Benedict Cumberbatch an incredible Sherlock - weird, funny, adorable, sexy and sometimes even heartbreaking, Martin Freeman is a three-dimensional Doc Watson who also wins our affection and admiration.  Andrew Scott is the best villain.  This is a series of best best best.",1399420800,,358,5.245614035087719
5849794,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I love this show, and have watched the three seasons many times. I'm glad that I own the DVDs. Both Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are marvelous. I would like to get new seasons more often than every two years, however!",1399420800,,228,4.585365853658536
5849795,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I've never purchase an instant download before, and was pleasantly surprised with both the ease of the process and the quality of the video. This is definitely the best season of Sherlock so far- watched it 3 times in rapid succession, avoiding all other obligations (Mea Culpa!)",1399420800,,279,4.957446808510638
5849796,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Not since Brett and Hardwicke has there been a team to properly perform the greatest detective of all time.  If Sherlock could be here in 2013, then it would be Mr. Cumberpatch and Mr. Freeman.  They are as believable now as Brett and Hardewick were when they performed their series.  A sheer delight!",1399420800,,301,4.6415094339622645

5849798,5,B00DRDBTT8,Fantastic series. I hope it runs for years. Only problem is that there are only three episodes per season. Enjoy.,1399420800,,113,4.7
5849799,5,B00DRDBTT8,Great to have a show that actually is intellectually stimulating and causes the mind to work on solving the mysteries.,1399334400,,118,4.95
5849800,5,B00DRDBTT8,We enjoy the new Sherlock series and thought there was some editing by PBS on a few episodes.  If you are a Sherlock fan these are worth the money.,1399334400,,147,4.068965517241379
5849801,4,B00DRDBTT8,I don't really know how you can mess up a DVD but I love it! It came later than I expected and I couldn't track the package so that was scary! But it obviously got here in one piece so I'm happy!,1399334400,,195,3.6666666666666665
5849802,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The BBC Sherlock is one of THE best TV series I've ever seen. VERY well written, well directed, well acted, well shot, and well edited. I will watch all the episodes again and again.",1399334400,,182,4.382352941176471
5849803,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Endlessly entertaining to watch Sherlock.  It's luxurious to watch episodes that are 90 minutes--so much more can be developed in the characters and plot.  The villians are the most villainy and BC is brilliant (the actor as much as the character).  The third episode was amazing, although slightly different in a variety of aspects which I can't reveal to you, obviously.  Rent it!  Watch it! Enjoy it!
(And then no news ones until 2016--ugh)",1399334400,,443,4.9324324324324325

5849805,5,B00DRDBTT8,"My wife and I are totally hooked on this Sherlock Holmes series. Well thought out scripts, wonderfully directed, superb cast. After the suspenseful season two ending we couldn't wait for season three.  Can't get enough!",1399334400,,219,5.257142857142857

5849808,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This show is delightfully entertaining and most definitely keeps you on your toes. Highly recommended to anyone. Seriously, anyone. Perhaps don't watch it at night if murder mysteries freak you out like they do me.",1399334400,,214,5.142857142857143
5849809,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I am not capable of writing a review on how much I love this show.  With the exception of David Suchot,
Benedict Cumberbatch captures this fictional character to perfection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Benedict:  I love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The relationship between Watson and Sherlock in this series is my favorite.  I love how both of them keep
denying it is anything but a guy relationship.  I love Martin Freeman, he is sooooooooo perfect for this role,
the way he keeps Sherlock in line is superb!!!  Thank you BBC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1399248000,,532,5.349397590361446

From Mrs. Hudson to Lastrade to that gorgeous brunette who plays Microft's assistant, there isn't a weak link in the bunch.  Too much fun.",1399248000,,293,4.86
5849812,5,B00DRDBTT8,Considering it takes so long in between seasons for this show...this was well worth the wait. The characters reach all new depths. My only wish was that we got to see Irene Adler again. But you are in for a delightful treat at the end of the last episode.,1399248000,,255,4.224489795918367
5849813,5,B00DRDBTT8,This show is absolutely brilliant.  It's well thought out...well written...well acted.  It's all-around a great show.  I highly recommend you check out all three seasons.,1399248000,,170,5.72

5849815,5,B00DRDBTT8,"A show with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, there is nothing better.  The two play off each other so well, I don't think that there is a better television show any where else.  Thank you BBC.",1399248000,,200,4.527777777777778
5849816,3,B00DRDBTT8,Fabulous! I've missed these boys. Sadly this season is not as good as the other two. Slightly more predictable but entertaining nonetheless. Glad the boys are back in town. Anxiously awaiting their next debut.,1399248000,,209,5.176470588235294
5849817,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I love the Sherlock  series, for many reasons including the creativity, actors and the fun storyline.  You never know what Sherlock is going to say or do.  He see's the world through different eyes than the rest of us  The writers and producers have created a great series from the original books of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  Its a lot of fun to watch and try to solve the mystery.",1399161600,,380,4.371428571428571

5849822,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This is an excellent series,episode. Amazing and very believable acting. It is fast and sometimes very humorous. If you had enjoyed the other seasons, or mystery/crime things to watch, watch this. This is very different from the Robert Downey jr Sherlock Holmes, but I think this is better acting and more believable.",1399161600,,317,5.115384615384615

5849825,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I almost missed this because I was confused by the titles.  With the first series being 5 seasons, I thought at first this was simple re-release.

After watching both Freeman and Cumberbatch in other current work, it was like seeing old friends to have them back in Sherlock's harness again.  Bring on more! I felt that adding Mary in and framing the wedding as it was so superbly done made the characters become more than they have been before.  I also applaud casting Mary as a mature woman in her own right and not just a sidekick for John.  More from these writers, please!

We need a crosssover with Sherlock and Watson helping Dr. Who solve a murder.",1399075200,,656,4.516949152542373
5849826,4,B00DRDBTT8,"I love the Sherlock series. I think the stories are fun, well acted, and visually beautiful. My only critism of this blu-ray was the lack of extras, esp. commentaries.",1399075200,,167,4.793103448275862
5849827,5,B00DRDBTT8,"While we are not rabid fans, we really like this series. The first and third eipisodes are a bit better than the second, but its a keeper. Lots of room for future episodes with all the loose ends from previous and this series. Hope they do more.",1399075200,,245,4.23404255319149
5849828,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Another great season of BBC mystery mini-movies. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman noe absolutely own the roles, and this update to modern times is far more successful and entertaining than ""Elementary"" on American TV (with all due respect to Jonny Lee Miller, as it's hardly his fault). This year begins by explaining Sherlock's supposed demise at the end of Season 2, and ends with a similar conundrum surrounding Sherlock's long-time nemesis, Moriarity.

5849829,3,B00DRDBTT8,"I'm sad to say Season 3 is my least favorite - I loved the other seasons and could hardly wait to get to Season 3. Sherlock has become a bit of a slapstick character. Exaggerated characteristics. Gets sloppy drunk, increased sexual innuendos all more than a tad overdone really so that it looses its charm overall. The ""improvements"" diminished the program for me anyway. I preferred the last 2, which were so well done. Family viewing? Goes beyond for our family anyway.",1398988800,,471,4.7560975609756095

5849831,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The two main characters, Holmes and Watson, continue with the great chemistry and humor from the first season.  The introduction of Mary, who manages to hold her own, making this a genuine trio, provides some of the more entertaining dialogue and twists.  She makes Sherlock, and us, not only like her, but genuinely welcome her presence. There is continued great interaction with Mycroft, Mrs. Hudson, and Molly, making this season tremendously entertaining.  Poor Sherlock gets punched by John, slapped by Molly, and shot by...I won't spoil it.",1398988800,,546,5.252873563218391

5849840,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Benedict and Martin continue to amaze me with their great portrayals of Sherlock and Watson.  I love what the writers are doing in terms of their relationship in season 3, and the ending doesn't disappoint.  I've watched seasons 1-3 at least 3 times now and probably will continue to watch them over and over until the actors, writers, the BBC and all the parties are able to bring us season 4 - sooner than later, but I know that all of them are busy with other projects. It's too bad because it is such terrific entertainment, so well written and acted.  Maybe I'm a little biased, as I absolutely adore Benedict Cumberbatch - yes he's eye candy, but I've not come across a more gifted actor with his range, and at his age!!  I know it will be a while before there is a season 4.  At least I have the first 3 seasons to keep me comfy while I patiently (ahem) wait.",1398816000,,866,4.288343558282208

5849842,5,B00DRDBTT8,Sherlock is my favorite show on television.  Different than any other show.  You have to stay on your toes to keep up with the plots and dialogue.  Not the boring predictable shows on television.  A must watch show for more sophisticated viewers.,1398816000,,246,4.785714285714286
5849843,5,B00DRDBTT8,The best depiction of a modern-day Sherlock Holmes.  Great casting and acting.  Wonderful writing.  Benedict Cumberbatch shows great skill in balancing Holmes' mental aberration with a deep down desire to be a little more in touch with his chosen human companions.,1398816000,,264,5.390243902439025
5849844,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I bought this together with Seasons One and Two. They arrived in one package, nearly 2 weeks later than the estimated date of delivery. Other than the un-expected late delivery, I'm happy with the purchase. The package is compact and well-sealed, the discs are brand-new and I had a good time watching them.",1398816000,,307,4.811320754716981
5849845,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This show does such a good job of showing us the character of the dtectives and the bad guys.
It keeps you guessing all of the time. Odd people just like you meet in real life. You just
can't beat it. It's to bad there are only 3 episodes.",1398729600,,239,3.8979591836734695
5849846,5,B00DRDBTT8,I can't write a review without spoilers. So i'll just say that i've missed my boys and find this just as delightful as the first two seasons.,1398729600,,141,4.2592592592592595
5849847,5,B00DRDBTT8,"May sound silly but I like the energy of the show. The acting is great and even though the plot at times could be considered slightly exaggerated, it, in my opinion, adds to its finesse. It is fun to watch and has lots of unexpected twists and turns. Well written.",1398729600,,264,4.3
5849848,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Great acting, great stores, keeps you riveted to the plot, and anticipating the next scene in the story line. One of the best shows Ive seen in years. Will not disappoint.",1398729600,,171,4.548387096774194
5849849,5,B00DRDBTT8,"My friend made me watch this the first time and i totally love her for it. Benedict Cumberbatch you sexy man you. You know what i can't do that, i love the whole cast.",1398643200,,167,3.9411764705882355
5849850,5,B00DRDBTT8,Very different from all the versions of Sherlock Holmes I've seen with a funny side that I really enjoyed.  Can't wait for the next season.,1398643200,,139,4.56
5849851,5,B00DRDBTT8,The entire series is good but I like this season the best. It is very witty and clever. I personally like British moves and these are deftly my favorite,1398643200,,152,4.275862068965517
5849852,5,B00DRDBTT8,Supper installent of this  excellent series. I wish they woulld do more. I never get tired of watching the interaction of these two opposite personalities.,1398643200,,155,5.2
5849853,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman have been following each other around the theater quite a bit lately and no wonder:  they provide absolutely fantastic balance between their personalities.  Having watched Benedict in Star Trek 2 and Martin Freeman in the Hobbit, the second installation of which has Benedict voicing the ever dark Sauron, they are perfect together!",1398643200,,372,5.508771929824562
5849854,5,B00DRDBTT8,Best show ever! I fell in love with this show probably after watching the first 10 minutes of the first episode.,1398643200,,112,4.380952380952381
5849855,5,B00DRDBTT8,More Sherlock would be grat! Just seems like 3 episodes every other year isn't enough. Maybe that is why they always leave us wanting more.,1398643200,,139,4.6
5849856,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Sherlock is brilliant! Writing, acting, filming, editing, production--it's all great. The chemistry between Sherlock and Dr. Watson is so much fun. If you're a fan of the original Sherlock Holmes, remember that in its time is was contemporary. This series is also contemporary but for the 21st century. I love the fresh look at Sherlock's personality (self-proclaimed high-functioning sociopath) and Dr. Watson (veteran of a modern Afghan war). I don't think the Moriarty character works as well as he could--but that's the only real negative I can think of.",1398556800,,558,5.280898876404494
5849857,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Can't wait for Season 4. So true to the spirit of the original Sherlock, but inventive, witty and incredibly involving. Soooo much better than Elementary.",1398556800,,154,5.2

5849859,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I love the way that the Mind Palace was handled in this season - the way that the series depicts Holmes (and other characters who employ this mnemonic device) is getting more engaging and creative ... more than just text/images/internal dialogue displayed on the wall for us to see and a bit more dramatic than the 'Minority report' style visualization from previous seasons. It has also been a pleasure to see new faces, especially Holmes' parents and Mary.

My only complaint with the series, is that it seems to reuse the same 'type' of villain/nemesis over and over ... Moriarty (Richard Brooks), Adler and most recently Magnussen are a bit too similar ... perhaps they are all faces of something larger we haven't seen yet ... (the real Moriarty, perhaps) :P",1398556800,,763,4.824427480916031
5849860,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This show is great I can understand what they're saying at all times. Its not too English, if u know what I mean. Lol And is sooo intelligently worded and explained. It captivated me from the first 5 mins. I love when shows do that.",1398556800,,232,4.177777777777778
5849861,5,B00DRDBTT8,The characters are amazing.  It is a truly addicting show.  Of you watch the first episode you will inevitable be compelled to watch all three seasons.,1398556800,,151,4.769230769230769
5849862,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Sherlock is the first well-known avenger to use his brain as his superpower.  He was widely read, somewhat globally, and ACD who wanted to be known for other kinds of works, did kill him off, and by popular demand brought him back. This is the central theme of who he is, and Watson is his everyman, who we see him through.  As such, reinterpretations that are true to that, in my opinion, are true to who he is.
Moving to season 3- this is largely centered on Watson, his progress in life, how he reacts to Sherlock's return, how he goes forward and how they bring Mary into their life.  So odd to hear names from various stories dropped into these stories. CAM, major Sholto, etc. Mary was a ""case"" before she ""hooked up"" with Watson, and progressing her from a proper, but self-assured, independent Victorian young lady to a former spy reflects modernizing the whole series.",1398556800,,877,4.573248407643312
5849863,5,B00DRDBTT8,Love this Season!  Fun to watch the unfolding of the Cliff hanger from last season.  Martin Freeman is really an excellent Dr. Watson with a depth of character that other versions lacked.,1398556800,,187,4.8125
5849864,1,B00DRDBTT8,"Season 1 was great, and Season 2 was good. But Season 3 is just so full of itself, and so hyperactive with its music video style, I cannot even watch it. Why can't they just tell a good story? Why do they have to muck everything up with cuts every fraction-of-a-second and weird post production effects as if this were sci-fi? I hate Sherlock now. It's back to Jeremy Brett for me.",1398556800,12,381,4.305555555555555
5849865,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Wonderful show!  So many twists and turns , keeps you guessing to the very end. Quirky, flawed but lovable characters,",1398556800,,118,4.9
5849866,5,B00DRDBTT8,One of the greatest shows on tv. Not many episodes a season about 3-4 and only 3 seasons. But the episodes are about and hour and a half  each. It's amazing how with such few episodes the fandom for this has grown so much. It says a lot for the show. It has the perfect chemistry of actors and creators that make it so successful.,1398470400,,330,4.076923076923077
5849867,3,B00DRDBTT8,"Loved Sherlock 1 and 2!
Season 3 is OK but does not quite live up to its predecessors, although the last episode had some redeeming qualities.",1398470400,,142,4.5
5849868,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Both actors return to form, and this season was just as good as the previous ones, I highly recommend this show",1398470400,,111,4.333333333333333
5849869,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Great update on the Sherlock story.  Benedict Cumberbatch is wonderfully manic in his portrayal of the brilliant, drug-addicted, abrasive detective.  Martin Freeman's long-suffering Watson is delightful, as are Mrs. Hudson, Inspector Lastrade, and the many other supporting characters.  We Americans have to use a different part of our brains to catch all the British-accented dialogue, but the baffling mysteries and never-ending twists make it all worthwhile!",1398470400,,461,5.954545454545454
5849870,5,B00DRDBTT8,"*SPOILER FREE REVIEW* Why is BBC's Sherlock better than RDJ and Guy Richie's movies? or CBS' Elementary? Hands down: it's the 1-2 punch of Cumberbatch and Martin.

RDJ was a great Sherlock, dare I say, much more neurotic than Benedict. But Jude Law as Watson? There is no on air chemistry between Downing and Law. Often I feel Law was casted to appeal to female audiences as a male sex icon - which is ironic considering how conservative Watson's character is. Conversely, CBS' Elementary makes a point to incorporate women into it's traditionally male roles. But the one question audiences will always ask: is how long can CBS keep the show going without the sex issue happening between the two of them? A time and true old question if men and women can be friends - and the bases of several great movies - most notably though was When Harry Met Sally. (Many feel the question has been thwarted by Joan Watson's most recent, discreet affair - but there's a lot of sexual tension on air between Liu and Miller - and that's confusing).

BBC has captured the essence of the Sherlock tale though. One man obsessed with his work, to the point he has minimized human contact as a distraction. And an ex solider struggling to find the balance between happiness in the civilian world and the danger of the non normal world. All casting selections are superb. All modern twists on the classic old tales are great. And Season 3 ends with a cliff hanger nearly as big as season 2.

Hopefully there will not be another TWO year gap between series/seasons this time..... still a bit sore about that. Especially since it was only for The Hobbit (which is a horrible bunch of movies, 2 movies in).",1398470400,3,1683,4.6033333333333335
5849871,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Love the show and the characters. After watching at least 4 interpretations of Conan Doyle's novels, u can honestly say this is a great way to bring these characters to modern day, make then interesting while preserving their authenticity.",1398470400,,239,5.153846153846154
5849872,5,B00DRDBTT8,This is a great series The way it is filmed and the content is brilliant. All of the original stories are given a cool hip modern spin.

5849873,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Our familiarity with and affection for the characters solidifies by now, and we notice the subtle changes in Sherlock's behavior and always wonder what is on the horizon for every one involved.  This will leave you desperate for Season 4!",1398384000,,238,4.95

5849876,5,B00DRDBTT8,"One could work long and hard to find anything wrong with Season 3 of Sherlock.  Plot, action, dialogue, all are superlatively written and acted.  The ensemble is incredible.  Anxiously awaiting Season 4.",1398297600,,203,5.28125

5849883,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I couldn't wait for Season, or ""series"" 3 to hit Netflix, so I went ahead and bought it here on Amazon, and I was not disappointed. The show has definitely gotten a bit more self-referential, but it is still spot-on in terms of keeping the audience guessing and staying fresh. Anyone who liked seasons 1 and 2 will love continuing the adventure with John and Sherlock. Love this show.",1398211200,,384,4.579710144927536

5849886,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Season 1,2 or 3 all of them amazing.  Cumberbatch has hit just the right note to convey Sherlock's self absorbed personality and Martin Freeman has a wonderfully expressive face.  Both men are gifted actors just as capable of making you or cry. I hope for many more seasons of this series.",1398211200,,289,4.647058823529412

5849890,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I love this program.  It is really excellent.  The only issue I have is that there is really a lot of jumping around sometimes making it difficult to follow the story line.  that seems to be the style these days, though.  The characters and the plots are great.",1398124800,,261,4.375
5849891,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I watched Episode 1 of season 1 because of all the hullabaloo surrounding it.  Then I binged watched the rest because of the story, the acting, the chemistry and of course, the Cumberbatch.",1398124800,,189,4.7272727272727275

5849895,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Oh I didn't want to love this show. Having recently ended a serious relationship with Breaking Bad. Also Benedict's neck is way too long. But the incredible acting and the extraordinary talent seen in every aspect of this unexpectedly addictive series, eventually wormed its way into my heart. By the end of Season 2 I was crying my freaking eyes out GD it.
Fine I love you, now give me MORE SHERLOCK. Actually Watson. Give me more John Watson.",1398124800,,444,4.632911392405063
5849896,4,B00DRDBTT8,The only problem I had with the third season was that Holmes was so involved in John and Mary's wedding. I wanted more of the interesting twists the writers devise to meld the original stories into the modern world. Still think it's the best TV readapt on Sherlock Holmes though.,1398038400,2,279,4.6
5849897,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The wedding, episode 2, was absolutely brilliant!  Superb writing and acting.  If I could give this a ten rating, I would.  Sincerely hope they continue with this series.  Don't miss Sherlock.",1398038400,,192,5.096774193548387

5849899,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I had to over-come a personal hurdle to appreciate the metamorphosis of Sherlock Holmes from his very Victorian persona into a modern sleuth who can say ""Piss off!"" and  remain highly erudite in a way that tech savvy youth can appreciate. Gone  is Conan Doyle's precise visual creation for Holmes as being excessively lean with a hawk nose and piercing grey eyes. Sydney Paget who created the drawings of Holmes for the stories that were originally published as a series in ""The Strand Magazine"" set the image of Holmes in concrete for the next hundred years. The human inspiration for Holmes according to Conan Doyle was Joseph Bell, an Edinburgh professor of medicine who was able to tell what diseases his patients had by watching them walk into the room.

Hundreds of thousands of theatrical performances have been built around the world's most portrayed  literary figure of all time and hundreds of actors have played Sherlock and Watson. Holmes will simply not go away even though bumped off by Conan Doyle himself as well as the ""Sherlock"" writers.

Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss created the sensationally popular television series ""Sherlock"" and moved the great detective and Watson and all the famous characters Conan Doyle so marvelously integrated into Victorian history away from the Victorian fogs and dropped  them bodily into the twenty-first century.

Benedict Cumberbatch is the  young actor who portrays Holmes in  the""Sherlock""series. He has an unusual face, the eyes deeply set, the lips finely etched. The nose is somewhat tilted up, not the slightest bit aquiline. Like the original sleuth he is  lean and tall and energetic and describes himself as ""focused like a shark."" His nervous energy is almost palpable.

Eerily, the modern Doctor Watson played by Martin Freeman is wounded in Afghanistan during the same war that has been tearing the country apart for a century. Freeman's Watson is a pleasant looking man, reliable and trustworthy and supporter of his roommate Sherlock. Although Watson as famously portrayed by Nigel Bruce is a loveable buffoon, the original Watson was steady, sober, honest, the type of man who was the backbone of the British nation. The Watson of ""Sherlock"" as Holmes' confidante  and sounding board has ""an outrageous sense of entitlement."" Returning from military service in Afghanistan, however, Watson is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and Holmes gets him to write a blog as therapy. Holmes and Watson are the co-lead. Without Watson you have no Holmes.

""Unlocking Sherlock"" discusses all the familiar roles in their new environment- Inspector Lestrade, Irene Adler, Professor Moriarty and even Mrs. Hudson all are modernized and their transformations explained. The documentary will greatly enhance your experience when watching ""Sherlock.""And it's a comforting thought that Holmes and Watson and all the Conan Doyle characters are alive and well.",1398038400,,2922,5.244635193133047
5849900,5,B00DRDBTT8,after catching this on BBC I couldn't get enough of the series and was itching for the 3rd to me made.  the opening here was excellent. love the story line as much of the original books have been incorporated and modernized into this series.,1398038400,,241,4.4772727272727275

5849903,4,B00DRDBTT8,The acting and story is great.  But I do wish they would not use the name of God and of Jesus Christ in a disrespectful way.  That was the only reason I gave 4 stars otherwise I would have given 5 stars.,1398038400,,203,3.8095238095238093

5849949,5,B00DRDBTT8,Brilliant writing and acting!  The first episode was the least favorite of the three.  It seemed like Mr Cumberbatch was having difficulty finding Sherlock but after that it just got better and better.

5849950,5,B00DRDBTT8,"OK I admit: we haven't finished watching season three yet.
This is a 2-disc set labeled ""BBC"" but watchable in format
1 (North America) and it's the Blu-Ray version.

Usually Blu-Ray seems to shine the best compared to DVD
with environmental scenes or computer graphics.  There
aren't a large amount of either (so far) in the episodes, but
nevertheless the extremely crisp and vivid images look
fantastic.

Some will probably complain: too sentimental; where's this
going; and so on and so forth.  All I have to say is: these
actors are just superb for their characters.  Also the dialog
seems very good: it neither over-states the obvious, nor is
it too sparse.  Great entertainment that doesn't leave you feeling
depressed nor (unless you are obsessive-compulsive) leave
you still trying to figure everything out.  Enjoy the ride and I
hope it goes on to a fourth!",1397260800,,866,4.931034482758621

5849954,5,B00DRDBTT8,I used to think that Jeremy Brett's Sherlock couldn't be topped.  This series does.  Moffat and Gatniss have done a superb job in creating a new environment for Cumberbatch and Freeman to investigate.  The cliff hanger endings will REALLY get to you.,1397260800,,250,4.904761904761905
5849955,5,B00DRDBTT8,Outstanding show! I watched all 3 seasons and always a great watch. If you enjoy a good mystery with some humor yet keeps you thinking this is the series.  Money and time well spent!,1397260800,,182,4.352941176470588
5849956,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I'm a die-hard Robert Downey Jr as Sherlock Holmes fan and put off watching this series because Benedict just didn't seem to fit. In the Holmes books, the British give him a typical stiff upper lip and dry humor that is as crumbly as his biscuits. That's why I adore RDJ in this part because of his sense of humor. Plus, who could possibly play Dr Watson other than Jude Law, right? Well, I was wrong! This series is brilliant! Ben plays a most unusual, quirky and clever Sherlock who I have grown to love. I just want to hug him! He is hilarious. Listen carefully to his mumblings and he grows to hysterical. Dr Watson tags along with his own brand of humor and keeps Sherlock in line. Don't blow this series off just because of what you THINK it will be like. I've watched all 9 episodes twice. They are each wonderful. Try S1 E1 and see if I'm right.",1397260800,,853,4.271604938271605
5849957,5,B00DRDBTT8,This is not as good as the first two seasons but I still find it better than most television shows out there.  I find myself watching these episodes over and over again and I never seem to get bored or tired of them.  They are so well written and the acting is even better than that.  Between the excellent writing and even better acting this show is a can't miss!,1397260800,,364,4.171428571428572
5849958,5,B00DRDBTT8,"....And he is definitely still high on my list...but Benedict now shares that pinnacle with him.  I'm continually entertained and enchanted by the way he breathes life into this modern version of Sherlock.  Absolutely nails it for me.  It's been nice to see a creative turn in basing it in modern day London.  Brett's Victorian Holmes is untouchable...but Benedict and Martin are just as fantastic to watch --- and the gifted actors who brought the despicable, villainous characters of Moriarty and Magnusson to life are immensely talented, as well.  I was in tears watching the ""Fall,"" and this season has me totally excited to see what happens next.  It's a bit of a bummer that the seasons have been so short overall, but I figure it's been due to the fact that they're both doing serious time in Peter Jackson's Hobbit films.  Here's hoping once they've finished filming maybe they can settle into more episodes per season.  Seriously can't wait for the next season -- is it later this year???  Ah, well.  Patience is a virtue.  Time to do some reflecting meditation inside my mind palace.  Does anyone else think Benedict has the most incredible eyes and a voice that melts even the most hardened heart???",1397174400,,1210,4.820388349514563

5849961,5,B00DRDBTT8,"It is hard to go wrong with a Sherlock Holmes show.  Harder still if it is produced by the BBC.  Transplanting the stories to modern times was a stroke of genius.  Love this series!

Dislikes: Sherlock seems more haughty than he was in the books and older shows.  It gives him more flaws, sure, but it also makes him a much less likable character.  I'm not used to relating more to Watson than Holmes in these stories.",1397174400,,418,4.363636363636363

Steven Moffat and Mark Gatis (and Sue Vertue) have created the most amazing, deep, well-written, fantastically plotted and and and.... series imaginable!  Oddly, I didn't like it the first time I saw a bit of it... a friend told me , after the second season was out -- to go give it a chance...  After watching the first episode, I immediately ordered both seasons on DVD -- and pre-ordered the third season as soon as it was announced.  The allusions back to various Sherlock stories (many of which I don't catch, as I have not actually read the Sherlock Holmes stories), the fantastic plotting and the AMAZING Moffat's usual cross-episode, cross-season story arcs and oh-so-carefully planted clues and hints just make this as wonderful as Dr Who!

I am a fan of this series and was excited to see 7 episodes this time (instead of 3).

However, after I purchased it, I realized that there are only 3 actual episodes. Four of the seven are ""behind the scenes"" things which gets more confusing because there are also two ""meet the makers"" episodes.

It would be cheaper to just buy the 3 real episodes (unless you like the other stuff)",1396915200,,467,4.535714285714286

5850011,5,B00DRDBTT8,I am such a fan of Sherlock.  I love the beautiful way these two actors tell their story.  The depth of their respect and devotion is shown by Watson in this season.  And the need for things to have been the way they had to be breaks your heart.  Never underestimate the power of Watson.  Sherlock would not be who he is without him.  Change comes.  Accepting it may be difficult.  The gift is being happy for someone who has what you wish you could have found even a fraction of in your lifetimeand being able to move on in your adapted relationship.

5850017,5,B00DRDBTT8,"What can I say? I am in love with this series and this season was better than the other two. The casting is terrific, there is not one bad actor in the bunch, and the modern plots are complex and fast-paced. I do have to say that I have come to love Martin Freeman's portrayal of Dr. Watson. I don't know that I've seen a better actor in the past few years (despite Hollywood's A list...). His talent is amazing and fortunately the rest of the cast is so good he doesn't leave them behind. I have never done this before but when I found out I could purchase the season online, I did it immediately.

5850020,5,B00DRDBTT8,My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed the third season of Sherlock. The writing is brilliantly both in its turns and twists and in its ability to be thought provoking.

5850026,5,B00DRDBTT8,"So season 2 ended with a heartbreaking, emotional, dramatic, shocking and surprising ending, as we all know, and so many people were wondering just how Sherlock had survived the Fall. There were so many fan theories and speculation amidst the fan art, fanvids, and fanfiction from people who absolutely have adored the show for all of these years with their favorite pairings and characters that it begged the question from so many: how could Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss (with occasional collaborator Stephen Thompson) pull off the impossible, in a sense, and set up the perfect trick by which Sherlock survived?

But the answer, which came two years or so after season 2, is quite unexpected in that it doesn't really matter. Nothing that Sherlock and the writers could come up with would match the drama and problem of the Fall. It matters that Sherlock survived, but it doesn't matter how he survived, and that is brilliant in quite a few ways. They present the problem and several solutions to it as there is no final problem and no final solution to Sherlock's Fall. He will survive the Fall, for that is part of Sherlock's mythos and mystique, and important to who he is. Reichenbach Falls is the point where Sherlock turned around and changed from being a famous detective that everyone loved into a legend in his own right.

Season 3 itself is a response and an answer to so many of the fans' wishes over the years in that the creators of the show are aware of the enormous popularity that Sherlock has garnered in its first two seasons, and they give the fans what they want in a sense, although not every wish is granted, which is probably for the best. Sherlock himself changes. He seems more personal and more approachable than he had been before. The last two years have changed him in many ways as he was forced to flee deep undercover, probably to the darkest regions of the world, and might have grown to miss everything that he had left behind him. Of course, he is still a high-level functioning sociopath, and doesn't let us forget it. (It had been noticed by a fan in the early 1900s, speaking to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, that Sherlock wasn't the same since he came back from Reichenbach Falls. Here, that historical, canonical change is acknowledged and developed upon.)

Mycroft and Sherlock are more familiar with each other than they have been in the past, and we even meet...well, oh, boy, that was a surprise. As for Watson, he grew a mustache in his grief for Sherlock and immediately punches him when he returns from the dead, but Mary, Watson's fiance and then wife (They get married in The Sign of Three) becomes companionable with Sherlock and smoothes the way between them, although it is a very rough road. Watson and Sherlock reunite with the Guy Fawkes disaster in episode 1, The Empty Hearse. Sherlock serves as Watson's best man in episode 2, The Sign of Three, and averts a disaster or two. In episode 3, His Last Vow, both Sherlock and Watson face their toughest personal problem yet. Expect some surprise guests and developments along the way.",1396569600,,3084,4.696857670979667

5850030,2,B00DRDBTT8,Disappointing. No real mystery/crime solved. The last episode especially was disjointed and difficult to follow. I think the writer's lost sight of what made Sherlock so popular.,1396569600,6,178,5.62962962962963
5850031,4,B00DRDBTT8,"OK, so they're 1 1/2 hours each...still 3 episodes?  They're good episodes, and there is a plot twist I certainly did not see coming, but still...3 episodes? Since when is that a Season?  There are some changes this season in the dialog, the cinematography, the style of the drama is a bit different.  I did not read the credits to verify, but I would guess a new person is involved.  It took a little getting used to.  I found the new style a bit hard to follow in the beginning--felt like when smoke in the way of a clear view, you keep wanting to brush it aside so you can see. Show feels a bit dumbed down from the previous 2 seasons--like they had to tell us more rather than trust we're bright enough to follow...that was a shame.  All in all, not sorry I own it, but....3 episodes? Really? I'm still not over that!",1396483200,,821,4.264516129032258

5850036,3,B00DRDBTT8,"Season 3 was a disappointment. Each episode was disconnected from the others; there was no flow. The 'villain' didn't fit at all and didn't really make sense why he was a threat. And poor John took the role of the clueless sidekick this time around. Sherlock seemed less than himself. He was no longer the high functioning sociopath we fell in love with in season 1, he was now a egotistical stanger the writers thought would appeal to Americans. The main plot twist was pointless and completely unnecessary. And the end didn't leave me wanting more sadly. I was confused and disappointed with this season.",1396483200,2,606,4.780952380952381

Season 3, intriguing, as always, was not quite at the creative level of Season 2. The interaction of Sherlock, Dr. Watson, and Mary, was an interesting twist. How they all reconciled remains a bit of a mystery to me, but that's ""Sherlock""! Looking forward to Season 4 and hoping it won't take two years before Benedict and Martin can coordinate their schedules.",1396483200,,485,4.773809523809524

The BBC mangles the sounds so much that much of the dialog cannot be understood as Sherlock talks very fast and very low in level.  One you listen to the DVDs you know that the show was not produced this way and that the BBC's audio Codecs are of very poor quality. PBS told me here that what we hear is what they get from the BBC.  I was also unaware of missed scenes that the BBC does not broadcast.

5850045,4,B00DRDBTT8,"I love this series - fun, smart and funny. Read other reviews regarding the show. However, be careful of the pricing structure. I ended up purchasing the whole season after I purchased 'Episode 1' - which was not actually an episode but an extra you would get for free with the purchase of the whole season. Since it was $2.99 I thought all episodes were $2.99. They are not. They cost between $4-6 depending on whether you want HD or not. It was only a $3 mistake but calling it 'Episode 1' I was expecting a story - not a back story. Since this ordering structure differed from previous seasons I felt it was work taking a 'star' off and explaining the issue. So if you're a fan and intend to watch the whole series, order the whole series or it will cost you unnecessarily.",1396396800,,776,4.358620689655172

5850062,5,B00DRDBTT8,Best season yet. Love this series.  You will be glad that you purchased it.  Sherlock & Watson are perfect together.,1396224000,,116,4.75
5850063,5,B00DRDBTT8,"If you were asking ""How could Sherlock get any better?""  The answer is Season 3! Unlike seasons one and two, I can't choose a favorite episode. A marvelous Dickens-esque subplot runs throughout all three episodes. There are more exciting camera shots that cross into the movie genre, some exquisite scripting (pull out your hankies for John's wedding), all directed with the energy and expertise of seasons one and two.
The only thing missing is that, this time, there are no running commentaries. There is much consolation, though, in the extra material that explains ""HOW done it.""
I find myself asking ""Can they keep this level of caliber going in the next season?!  And , while I wonder how long we're going to have to wait, I am enjoying watching the episodes over and over again.",1396224000,,785,4.807407407407408
5850064,1,B00DRDBTT8,"Pretty much the worst season that has been made so far.
The shaky-cam will give you whiplash, Sherlock isn't very likable or interesting despite trying to make him more of both for this season, the plots for each episode are pretty boring with very little charm, and Mark Gatiss has WAY too much screen time as Mycroft Holmes (Executive Producer and Co-Creator on the series has too much screen time? No.... Can't be.)
Oh, and the big payoff on how Sherlock survived his jump is remarkably unimaginative and doesn't really make sense in a couple of spots.",1396224000,11,555,4.731958762886598
5850065,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The sad thing was there were only 3 episodes in Season 3, but with extra features.  As the writers/producers say, it takes a lot of imaginative effort to continue to write more stories that were as good as the last one.  I hope they do because I'm hooked on the style, actors and personality of the show. (who doesn't love to see London in Blu-ray quality).",1396224000,,357,4.393939393939394

I think with His Last Vow the writers couldn't figure out how to work themselves out of the corner they wrote themselves into and it was disappointing.

5850071,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I compared the first two seasons of Sherlock versus previous depictions as Hendrix playing Dylan songs.  Perhaps this one should be compared to the Hendrix song, ""1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)"" from the Electric Ladyland album.  For those not familiar with Hendrix (is that possible?), he played guitar backwards functionally but turned the rock guitar world upside down with his creative use of pedals and feedback while playing the instrument behind his back, with his teeth, against a microphone stand, and simply blowing away the boundaries of the genre.  This is what the makers of Sherlock have done with Arthur Conan Doyle's novels...you know it is basically the same cast of characters, but they are also brand new iterations of all former depictions.  The people who inhabit this world are not only far more weird than any previous version of the stories and yet they are more human and less predictable than all who came before them.",1396137600,,952,4.93125

5850081,4,B00DRDBTT8,"I'm ridiculously obsessing over this show. It makes it incredibly clear why Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are so in demand right now. They have amazing chemistry and while I was never a Sherlock/Watson fan even though I was a fan of the books - these two make me desperately wish that Sherlock/Watson was canon.

Gattiss and Moffat are also to be commended - the actors probably wouldn't be where they are if they hadn't been handed such excellent dialogue and story lines.

This isn't a stand alone season - I doubt it would make a lot of sense without the series before and whatever will be the series after. I wouldn't recommend jumping in on this season. This is one part where the show really departs from the books - you could pick up any of the stories and get a good feel for the characters and what was going on. I believe I myself started on The Hound of the Baskervilles.

I think choosing Martin Freeman's real life partner to play Mary Morstan/AGRA was a good choice - they do have good chemistry in front of the camera and I felt less annoyed that she was getting in between the two stars. Though her back ground story would help flesh out the character a bit. Still not sure who she is.",1396051200,4,1211,4.42152466367713

5850085,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Excellent extra videos.  I would enjoy more time dedicated to special effects and how the main characters related to original tales by Arthur C. Doyle.  Dare we get an honest response by one of the writers on how they feel about ""Elementary""?  What do they like about how portrayed by the writers?  Let's get deep and profound!  We know the actors and actresses are tremendous.  Could we have some heavy discussion here?  By the way, B.C. is tremendous as narrator in Death in a White Tie.

This show is so incredibly well-cast, from the main characters to the peripherals. Well-written also, and true to the vision of the original Sherlock Holmes while updated to present settings.

My only complaint is that they only release three shows per season and it's a long wait to the next.

I managed to get past the Irene Adler as a bisexual dominatrix (WTF?) and the fact that Irene was made up to look a lot like a Joan Crawford impersonator in a drag show. The main thing is the  mysteries (which is what SH fans want) and the great chemistry between Holmes and Watson.  Now we get to Season 3 and suddenly I hear  ""Feelings, oh oh oh, feeeelings..."" in the background as soppy Oprah-style musings appear like malignant emotional mushrooms on the fine Holmesian lawn.  British people with class  and men with dignity don't go about like 14 year old girls ""sharing"" with their galpals. My favorite part of Holmes' return is when Watson jumps up and punches Holmes instead of giving him a (ugh) hug, because that is how real men (used to) behave.

5850130,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The only problem with this amazing show is that it takes so darn long for the new seasons to come out. My husband and I watched all the shows while I was laid up with foot surgery. Our only disappointment was that it was over too soon.

Cumberbatch is delightful as Sherlock and though the show doesn't take itself too seriously, there were some real emotional moments. I really love all the nods to the original stories. It makes me want to dive back into them.",1395705600,,462,4.372093023255814
5850131,3,B00DRDBTT8,"I imagine many people have been caught in this.  For all intents and purposes, it looked like I was ordering Episode 1 -- because that's what it says.  Not ""Bonus Content.""  It says, ""Episode 1.""

Very deceptive and frustrating, and I'm surprised Amazon allows them to get away with it.",1395705600,,286,4.66
5850132,5,B00DRDBTT8,Sherlock is the most intelligent and witty detective show on TV ever . Dialogue is so sparkling and intelligent need subtitles to catch it all.,1395705600,,143,4.76

Benedict and Martin at their very best... Well everyone fit like T... Love it",1395705600,,119,4.217391304347826
5850136,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Season 1 starts slowly, but the series just keeps getting better and Season 3 is the best.
Absolutely cannot wait for Season 4!",1395705600,,127,4.565217391304348
5850137,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Sherlock is an amazing BBC production. If you're interested in getting the dvd's / blu rays - make sure it's the BBC - UK version.

Wish Amazon would get rid of their minimum word requirement for a review, however.",1395705600,,214,4.487179487179487
5850138,5,B00DRDBTT8,Exciting from start to finish. We can't wait to watch the next episode.  The actors are fabulous. Perfectly cast for their individual roles.,1395705600,,140,5.086956521739131
5850139,2,B00DRDBTT8,"If you are a fan of the original Sherlock Holmes and if you enjoyed seeing the detective brought forward into present times with such skill, you know why I did NOT like season three.  I bought it - yes, I did.  I own the other two and I can't imagine having a collection and not having all of the collection.  I even own Star Trek 5, and we all know how bad that was.  Anyway, I hope the creators of this series go back to the Master and remember just WHO Sherlock Holmes is.",1395705600,6,475,4.0212765957446805

5850142,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I enjoy the way they keep the flavor of the old Sherlock Holmes while they make the shows more current to our times. I've always liked the old books, series, and movies of Sherlock Holmes. This new series does not disappoint. They give us different ways that Sherlock may have accomplished his suicidal jump without exactly telling us how. Imagination is key and stories should always leave you with something to think about. An ongoing series should leave us with something to look forward to and Season 3 does just that. I look forward to Season 4!!",1395705600,,551,4.690721649484536
5850143,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I have thoroughly enjoyed both seasons 1 and 2 and if episode 1 is an indicator of season 3 then it promises to be equally good. I love the humor and Cumberbatch's Sherlock is a delight to get to know. What I really enjoy is the relationships between Holmes and Watson, and surprisingly, Holmes and his brother. It's all great fun with twists and turns, laughter, sadness, and surprises. My only complaint is there are only 3 episodes per season!",1395705600,,446,4.5875
5850144,5,B00DRDBTT8,I love this show for the acting and writing.  You actually need to pay attention and have a brain to enjoy it separating it from 99% of the crap on TV.  The only issues I have is that they make so few episodes and it is starting to get a little silly.  How many times are people going to die only to come back later?,1395705600,,316,3.830769230769231
5850145,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Too many people built up their expectations for Sherlock way too high before even watching season 3 of this fantastic show. They were bound to be disappointed, no matter how brilliant. And yes, I found brilliance in this season. Character growth and the chances the writers and directors took are to be commended and most importantly- enjoyed!

Sit back and enjoy a different but satisfying season of Sherlock. Know going in that the time away has changed and matured our heroes. They missed each other and we have missed them. Welcome back Sherlock!",1395619200,,550,4.913978494623656
5850146,5,B00DRDBTT8,"If you like benedict Cumberbatch or Martin Freeman, and you love cheeky British humor--you will LOVE this series! I suggest you watch season 1 and 2 first only because their friendship does build over all 3 seasons and the humor and banter that both Sherlock and Watson have is incredible!",1395619200,,289,4.8
5850147,5,B00DRDBTT8,What can I say?  I love the series and the UK version had stuff that I had not notice on the PBS showing.,1395619200,,105,3.5652173913043477
5850148,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Although the ending of the season Three was to a certain degree predictable, nobody seriously expects Sherlock to die (sorry for the spoiler) in a modern version of a Charge of the Light Brigade, the story lines simply get better and better. The problem is that you would love to see more of these pair and the savory secondary characters, and these stories have been carefully and meticulously crafted giving the end product an almost magically quality, but they are so few... Quality regrettably requires time, and this people are true to the form and content of this jewel of the crown. (Forgive my clichs, but life is short....) Do I love the series and the characters? Does a Kodiak bear eat salmon? Elementary, I would say, even if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle never said it, it is, it is so, and it shall be.",1395619200,,809,4.586206896551724
5850149,5,B00DRDBTT8,Can't wait for more episodes.  Benedict Cumberbatch is the best. Martin Freeman is fantastic as John Watson. Love the writing.,1395619200,,126,5.3
5850150,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Original, great style, quirky and fascinating characters, fantastic writing, beautifully funky camera work, flawless direction, superb acting - terrifically entertaining. This is one of the BEST shows to come out of Britain in years. Though set in the present, the stories are incredibly faithful to the original books.",1395619200,,319,5.666666666666667
5850151,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Excellent series, highly recommended. Get the whole series. Wonderful cast that work beautifully together in a show that has enough twists and turns to force you to watch it numerous times.",1395619200,,189,5.129032258064516
5850152,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The overal project to recast and re-present Sherlock has really been  a pleasure to watch and this episode has been my favorite.  The wit, humanity, suspence and humor were all present to make this a great episode.  My only dissappointment is that there are only three episodes per season.",1395619200,,289,4.857142857142857
5850153,5,B00DRDBTT8,"How can you go wrong with the actors in this? Love buying the seasons of this because here in the US, PBS cuts out a lot of scenes to make time for their advertising before and after the show. I got to see those missed scenes in this DVD set.",1395619200,,242,3.86
5850154,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This is the best possible re-imagining of an classic possible.  And this third season has upped everything that made the first two seasons so good.  I love the format of having each episode at movie length (though sad that there are only three episodes per season).  Who'd have thought that Kahn, from Star Trek:  Into Darkness (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Bilbo Baggins from The Hobbit (Martin Freeman) would have made the perfect Holmes and Watson?",1395619200,,448,5.013513513513513
5850155,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Excellent series - the best the BBC has produced, in my opinion. The writing is superb, the cast is perfect. Video quality pretty good, but I don't think it's quite as good as I've found with DVD's produced in the U.S.  Nevertheless, I will be watching all three seasons of Sherlock for many years to come.",1395619200,,306,4.464285714285714

5850158,5,B00DRDBTT8,"As a long-time fan of Sherlock Holmes novels and TV/film adaptations, I was skeptical the show would be anything more than a modernized view. Instead the show has proven it is certainly the best television available now, particularly season 3. The writing, television production values, visual editing, pacing, creative impact and story arc are nothing short of amazing.

Even if you've already seen Season 3, I highly recommend getting the Blu-ray version to watch again and again, particularly on an HD TV.

Only one question... WHEN IS SEASON 4?

Bravo for this series.",1395532800,,572,5.129032258064516
5850159,5,B00DRDBTT8,Love the series.  Sometimes I need to re-watch to catch something I missed.  There needs to be more episodes in a season.,1395532800,,121,4.454545454545454

5850163,5,B00DRDBTT8,Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are brilliant once again in their roles as Sherlock Holmes and Watson in the BBC version of this series. It's the best series out there right now. The chemistry between these two is fun to watch. Well done boy's.,1395446400,,252,4.75
5850164,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Absolutely fantastic! You will want to watch this over and over. The final episode leaves us with a new question of how someone survived, or who is now pretending. Sherlock, the East Wind is coming.",1395446400,,198,4.685714285714286
5850165,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Of course this season was MUCH anticipated and we all had to wait SOOOOO very long!  I have to admit that I was VERY worried about how the writers would handle revealing that Sherlock was still alive to Watson.  I mean, good heavens, the poor Dr. was devastated by Sherlock's ""death""!  Well, if you have any worries like I did, let me alleviate them - the writers handled this very well - in my opinion at least.  It was hilarious, sad, and I have really come to like Mary... you go girl!  *chuckle*",1395446400,,499,4.32258064516129
5850166,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Fun show! Complicated mysteries, witty jokes, handsome men, British accents. Need I say more? Really? If you like Firefly, Dr Who, Star Trek, you'll like Sherlock :)",1395446400,,165,5.148148148148148
5850167,5,B00DRDBTT8,I never knew anything about this show until I watched it. Loved it from the beginning. Tactful and well written and acted. Way to go BBC!,1395446400,,137,4.3076923076923075
5850168,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I fell in love with the Sherlock Holmes novels/stories something over 40 years ago, and in all this time, this is the only film version I have felt really gives you the complexity of Holmes (who is by now more of a social construct than a literary figure, I suppose).  It's a modern rendition, which gives it leeway to adapt without having to do the ""revising the character"" thing that many movies have had to do to keep some innovation there.  I will say that while season 1 seemed to be adaptations of some of the stories, this season is increasingly incorporating elements from different ones into its own trajectory.  That works for me.  Excellent actors and nice running jokes that work the centuries-long divide between original and modern (the gay thing, the hat thing, etc.)  (BTW, on the subject of successful Holmes revisions, I also like Laurie R. King's novels, which are totally different but work in their own way.)",1395446400,,929,4.745341614906832
5850169,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I don't care for this series one way or the other, but it is my wife's favorite, and she is a real big screen and little screen fanatic. I pre-ordered the third season when ordering the first two seasons, receiving all three at one time. My wife was thrilled. If your significant other even hints at wanting this series, buy it immediately.",1395446400,,340,4.5
5850170,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Martin Freeman could carry this series, but what a tremendous bit of acting when Cumberbatch is on screen. With the pair it is like the book you cannot leave.",1395360000,,158,4.482758620689655
5850171,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Well, now, wasn't this one a surprise?  They showed how they did it and I had to wait half of forever to see what happened.  Sherlock really is something else and Mr. Cumberbatch very cleverly acted this one beautifully.  A really good series.  We liked this one a lot.",1395360000,,269,4.428571428571429
5850172,4,B00DRDBTT8,"Overall it was great to see the characters again and see how the writers were going to address some of the issues from the original stories, such as Mary.  However, it would have been nice if the writers had bothered to cover some of the questions left over from Series 2 instead of just bringing up new questions.",1395360000,,314,4.413793103448276
5850173,5,B00DRDBTT8,Wonderful!  Cumberbatch & Freeman make a wonderful pair of sleuths!  Can't wait for season 4!  I'm sure there will be more surprises.  The writing is superb!,1395360000,,157,4.923076923076923

5850186,4,B00DRDBTT8,I really love this show. All three seasons are fantastic. This is one of the best series out there. I only wish there were more episodes per season. Why are there only 3 or four episodes!? Please consider making Season 4 longer and don't wait so long between seasons!!!!!,1395273600,,271,4.551020408163265

5850188,3,B00DRDBTT8,The first episode just bounced way too much and all the suggesting that Sherlock or Watson for that matter might be gay is rediculious.,1395273600,3,135,4.666666666666667
5850189,4,B00DRDBTT8,"I had a feeling ""Sherlock"" would slowly start getting a bit wobbly as the seasons wore on and the producers focused on the best and most well-known of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, leaving less and less material to work with. I was right. Season 3 consists of three episodes, the best being ""The Sign of Three,"" which is actually one of my favorite episodes of the entire series. The first episode, ""The Empty Hearse,"" answers the question of how Sherlock survived his apparent death in the Season 2 cliffhanger. The final episode, ""His Last Vow,"" starts off strong and includes some unexpected twists, but it left me a bit unsettled, as I have a hard time accepting that Sherlock would actually commit the crime he does at the end. It's so out of character, in my opinion. Still, the cliffhanger for next season was great, and I hope the return of a memorable villain will bring some great stories in Season 4.",1395273600,,915,4.619631901840491
5850190,5,B00DRDBTT8,This series is a favorite.  Superbly written and delivered.  I never get bored even though I typically like shorter episodes.  I found myself wanting more even after 1.5 hours.,1395273600,,176,5.0
5850191,5,B00DRDBTT8,Great series...and kinda weird that it keeps telling me that 3-D signal is detected when it's not 3-d...but VERY sharp and clear.,1395273600,,129,4.909090909090909
5850192,5,B00DRDBTT8,I never thought this end for the third season. There are more questions than answers at the end. The only I can do is to wait for the new season. It was amazing!,1395273600,,161,3.909090909090909
5850193,5,B00DRDBTT8,This show seems to improve with every episode. I love the small nuances with the writing and acting that has made this age old story come to life in a new way. The third season was the best yet.,1395273600,,194,4.0
5850194,5,B00DRDBTT8,Saw season 1 and 2 on Netflix.  Couldn't wait for season 3 to come out on Netflix so I bought it.  Worth every penny.  Fantastic series.,1395273600,,136,4.153846153846154

5850196,5,B00DRDBTT8,I also recommend the bonus features of the year where the stars and writers are interviewed.  Stories are a modern day adaptation of the original work.,1395273600,,151,4.8076923076923075

5850206,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Sherlock immediately sucked me in and I now measure time in my life as before BC and after BC (BC of course being Benedict Cumberbatch).

Season 2 was nothing short of amazing and brilliant.  The introduction of characters Moriarty (my favorite villain ever) and Irene Adler made for the best chemistry & drama (and humor), I've ever seen on TV!! Since this review is geared toward Season 3, I'll keep it to just that, but just wanted to mention season 2.

Season 3, WOW! Sherlock delivered again! BEST SHOW ON TV BAR NONE! Wonderfully written, superb acting (supurb is an understatement), amazing plot twists.  Did I say WOW already?? I laughed a lot, cried, and laughed some more.  I CAN NOT take my eyes off the screen when Sherlock is on.  My house can be burning down and I would never even notice it. The action, the plot twists, the camera angles, the cast (doesn't hurt that Cumberbatch is a nice piece of eye candy) and the on screen texts and thoughts make for an invigorating show (to say the least).  Sherlock developing more feelings & ""human"" characteristics is so interesting and unique to watch.  LOVE that there is more Dr. Watson...Martin Freeman is an incredible actor! Sherlock & John are terrific together and their interactions are perfect. Since watching I've become a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman..their acting is outstanding and it sucks you in...you are doomed right from the start. The characters in Sherlock have a way of getting under your skin, making themselves comfortable, and staying right there...

I won't post spoilers, but the episodes are really, really great and I am SO happy that Sherlock is back with Dr. Watson at his side. So pleased that the last show of the series (His Last Vow) ended like it did...it was PERFECT.  Left me happy, and of course, wanting more. Can not wait for the return of Andrew Scott (Moriarty) next season!!! I can only pray that co-creators Steven Moffat & Mark Gatiss create many, many more seasons of Sherlock with Cumberbatch & Freeman. Please make the episodes longer (1.5 hours goes by like 10 minutes) AND PLEASE DON'T MAKE US WAIT TWO YEARS for the next season.  Yes, I am SHERLOCKED.",1395187200,,2184,4.751322751322752

5850214,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Series 2 is no easy act to follow, and they didn't have Moriarty this time. In the end this show proves that it can create new and exciting villains just as effective as Moriarty while still being something audiences haven't seen before.

The highlight of the overall series, in addition to the continued perfect chemistry between Holmes and Watson of course, is the addition of Mary. Adding Watson's love interest should have disrupted everything. Instead it just elevated everything in a surprisingly emotionally impactful way.

To talk about specifics would be to spoil it, but it's a perfectly balanced return and every episode just gets better.",1395187200,,649,5.113207547169812

5850219,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Quick-witted, intelligent and pithy, the third season of Sherlock (or Schlock, as it 's lovingly called in my family), did not disappoint.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are a joy to watch, even though their relationship is more than a tad bit unhealthy.  We love them, we root for them, we hunger for them and their continued escapades.  I particularly enjoyed the second episode of this season, and found again, as in Seasons One and Two, that I was disappointed when each episode ended.  Thank goodness for DVDs and the instant gratification they provide.  We are jonesing for the fourth season and understand that it will break earlier than originally planned, thanks to the collective outcry of support from the Sherlock community.  Actors, writers and producers, keep up the good work and keep Sherlock coming!",1395100800,,826,5.0814814814814815

5850221,4,B00DRDBTT8,"While this episode was good, it wasn't as good as past episodes.  The pace was even more frantic than usual, the ""punch line"" at the end too improbable even for Sherlock",1395100800,,169,4.451612903225806
5850222,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The best Holmes' derivatives. The acting is stupendous, the plots are intricate and convoluted, Holmes is arrogant, Watson is down-to-earth, supporting characters are marvelous, the directing is imaginative and I am enthralled in every episode. I think I have seen 10 different Holmes series or movies and this is my favorite of the TV series--American or British. (Of course I love Robert Downey, Jr and Jude Law too but it is a different medium.)

If you are a Sherlock lover, you will enjoy this series.",1395100800,,506,4.952941176470588
5850223,1,B00DRDBTT8,"I watched this show faithfully I love Sherlock stories and the actors. However during one of the new episodes there is a comment ""GOD is an invented idea for the family idiot"". I am a Christian and have read Sherlock and numerous scientific material regarding creation and the foolishness of not understanding at a minimum that there is a creator. This coming from Sherlock both made me sick and understand how the writers have a liberal agenda that is not even based on scientific or logical conclusions for the most logical character Sherlock!
""Scientist say many things...that science itself has never said. Unchecked by the general public becomes a weapon to brainwash the masses into slavery"".",1395100800,5,698,5.025862068965517

5850225,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Wow. Just wow.
The Empty Hearse was absolutely brilliant, *spoiler alert* Sherlock's return is quite dramatic in so many ways, and Watson's reaction was priceless. And so vague, too, leaving it so that we STILL don't truly know how he did it, not with any definitive sense.
The wedding episode was quite entertaining, as Sherlock was trying to multitask. There was a few key short scenes in this that really set up the stage for the finale . . . WHICH WAS AMAZING.
The finale was brilliantly filmed, if you look closely there are clues in how they film it that help the plot. Such art, such beauty, and holy cow, there are plot twists that I don't think ANYONE would have expected that really stun you. Definitely worth watching!",1395100800,,729,4.615384615384615
5850226,5,B00DRDBTT8,"It was a long time coming but Sherlock Season Three was well worth the wait.  John Watson's Mary has become a welcome addition to the cast and she brings her own kind of fun to the well established characters.  Rather than coming in between Sherlock and Watson, she has found her own little niche.  The only downside to this show is having to wait another two years for the next season.",1395100800,,386,4.408450704225352

5850232,5,B00DRDBTT8,"We are huge fans of this series (and of course almost all Holmes material). Jeremy Brett, Basil Rathbone, all great. But there has never been anything as sophisticated and engaging as this version. Each of these episodes is as complex and exciting as a full-fledged feature film. This episode is the ultimate: to begin to describe it here would ruin your enjoyment. Trust us, even if you already are a fan, this particular show will expand your consciousness -- in a good way.

If you like watching Benedict Cumberbatch mugging and winking, by all means buy it; you won't be disappointed.  But if you were expecting an interesting story with a coherent narrative, fuggedabout it.  All the clever computer graphics and time dilation cannot disguise the thinness of the stories, which don't resemble the Arthur Conan Doyle stories in the slightest.

And once again, I was not disappointed. Well, I was a bit, when I found out that there were only THREE episodes in the series after I waited for two years or so. (I guess that Martin Freeman was too busy battling orcs to spend much time solving crimes.)
Witty dialogue, unique characters and dry humor all makes up why we love tho series so much. It also wouldn't be Sherlock if there weren't any plot twists and mysteries to solve. Sherlock season 3 has given us more intriguing cases, funny moments and pure brilliance. The kind of TV that is sorely lacking.

It has a different tone, but I relished the change: from the characters, the plots, the structure, and the humor.  The show has to grow, too.  Series 3 was worth the wait.  The DVD is good.

If you are trying to decide on what parts of the season to buy, do consider the episodes labeled Bonus Content Sherlock Uncovered.

Cumberbatch lends a deft hand to a character beginning to recognize the importance of certain other people to his satisfaction in life. It is a departure from the first two seasons in that respect, but why not let the characters develop new aspects? To quote Moriarty quite out of context, ""It's what people do."" The writing is adding dramatic layers via flashbacks and Sherlock's interior imaging that is inventive and invites this viewer to let go of the reins and just take the ride.

All of this season is visually stunning, and in particular the third episode, ""His Last Vow."" We're in the hands of a very talented cast and crew.",1394841600,,719,4.661417322834645

5850280,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Watched this show only recently and was hooked from first to last episode. Though I have not seen the accompanying features in Season 3, I thoroughly enjoyed the episodes, especially Episode 3. I actually gasped in horrified astonishment, which of course meant a delightful turn of events had occurred.

The acting is fantastic, as are the cast who brings these characters to life.

I particularly liked the growth of Sherlock from a rude and mainly uncaring man into a human being. He actually gained some friends and colleagues and exhibited a more caring manner in spite of himself. Now that he does care, he will go to extraordinary lengths to protect them when necessary.

Looking forward to future episodes and continued character development, as well as the next arch villain. Lovely!",1394841600,,791,5.022900763358779
5850281,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The actors and writers deserve major points for translating Holmes to a modern setting.  The latest season of three tales sees the return of Holmes (oh, was that a spoiler?), John Watson's marriage, and plenty of serious investigation.  The stars are simply ideal as a a modern Holmes who is true to the core of the original Victorian detective and a Watson who shows more character than simply as a common man reflection Doyle originally intended (just as the Rathbone-Bruce movies offered a regrettably buffoonish Watson so that his character would not simply be buried by Homes' presence).  The actors who play Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade are great.  And I'm continually delighted at how the writers successfully adapt Doyle's original tales, telling a modern London-set tale while skillfully weaving in the central vision of what makes Sherlock the character who took England by storm in his day, making fans casually cling to the Elvis-returns-like delusion that there really was a Sherlock Holmes...because they wanted him to exist.",1394841600,,1035,5.179640718562874

5850283,5,B00DRDBTT8,"What would a non-Victorian 'high-functioning sociopath' Sherlock be like?  Exactly as created by the Dr. Who team!  The fast-paced, multi-layered storylines mirror the traditional stories, but propel them into today's world. Episode 1: 'John, how can you be upset that I didn't tell you I was dead, but why did you go on with your life?'  I thought it couldn't be topped, but...Sherlock's ocd management of John's wedding while crime solving was a writing/acting tour de force.  It emphasizes that this version of Sherlock cares so deeply about the people he can allow himself to care about.  And the sibling rivalry between Mycroft and Sherlock  is wonderful.  Mary's character adds so much spice to the mix. Thank you for the 'Plot spoiler.'  I know MaryMustDie, but her character is terrific.  I have not been able to bring myself to watch her unveiled...but it is a masterful move.  The only problem with the series is the 2 year lag.

This was a great season. I wish that it had been a little better, but it is a good bridge from the first two to season 4. I can't wait until these guys return.  They are all must see stories, but with the exception of the final episode they lack an identifiable villainous crime. In other words, most of the time in the first two episodes is spent thinking, ""what exactly is going wrong here,"" instead of, ""all right...definite shenanigans...who dunnit?"" The final episode is not short a villainous presence though the the question of who is answered rather easily.

I think the biggest difference is that we now have Sherlock's POV more than we do John's.  Surprisingly, this is also a much more emotional/personal season.  Who would've guessed?",1394755200,,437,4.837837837837838

They make ""episode one"" of the prime listing a Bonus program and ""episode two"" in their list is actually Season 3 episode 1?

Sherlock as a human being who dates and makes a girl's heart flutter?  Huh.  Sherlock as ever is brutally honest, and the emphasis is on brutal. He should be loved.  But at a distance.",1394668800,,386,4.093333333333334
5850315,3,B00DRDBTT8,"i started watching BBC Sherlock only from this series, and was shocked by the style and acting, but felt uncomfortable after watching the ending of 3rd episode, when they made Sherlock a cold blood killer (not self defense or with any immediate danger). this is not the Sherlock we know from books and anywhere, and the one we love and know.

then i got series 1 & 2 DVDs to watch, which confirmed my disappointment for series 3. what a beautiful Sherlock introduction from the very first episode, and don't we all miss that Sherlock? but such a Sherlock disappeared from series 3, even with the great acting from Cumberbatch, and stunning cinematography of that mind palace in episode 3. it is entirely the writers' fault, and they simply go cheap and made Sherlock's usual intelligence go away, but made him as stupid as ordinary people and totally outplayed by his opponent. in the end, i just have to go back to series 1 and 2 to relive this great Sherlock stories...

writing is really the big problem for this series, which made me feel cheated and betrayed on Sherlock's intelligence. the writers seem really lower IQ of many audience this season, with those stupid plots and non-mysteries. the point is that what we love about Sherlock is his super intelligence and super wit and smartness in detective work. if such an intelligence no longer exists, then there's no point of the show.

i don't recommend buying this series 3 DVD (no extras either), though i got it regardless but don't have much desire to watch it over and over again. definitely get series 1 and 2 DVDs, which would be enough to leave you on a happy note.",1394668800,2,1632,4.640138408304498

5850319,4,B00DRDBTT8,"Series 3 would be a complete disaster, but when you have actors of this caliber, even the self-indulgent, fan-bashing to fan-servicing nature of these three episodes can't sink the show.  Benedict Cumberbatch was obviously having a great deal of fun what with all the winking and P-popping.  He came off Star Trek into Darkness needing to smash through more glass and really want to show his sexy stuff. And who wouldn't indulge him?

Like all fans, I'm a sucker for the emotional, personal moments.  There were a lot of delightful scenes, moving scenes and entertaining scenes.  But on the whole, the abandonment of the basics that made the first two Series great and the obvious contempt the writers have for the fans rendered these three episodes more problematic than satisfying.

I can't say I care that much if it comes back.  I can always see these actors in other great roles.  Here's hoping it was a glitch and Series Four is better.  Maybe Moffat will get some therapy or something.",1394668800,,992,4.788235294117647

The story lines are clever and compelling, and frequently do not stray far from their source. The writing is crisp and consistently strong. The directing and overall production quality are of the highest caliber, and the acting...well, I just can't say enough good things about Cumberbatch and Freeman, both as a team and as individual performances. The supporting cast is top notch, as well. I love this show. Period.",1394668800,,598,5.05050505050505
5850326,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The most noticeable thing about Season 3 of Sherlock is that he becomes much more of a complex human being to us.  Of course, he has always been complex - but now in this series, he is becoming more human, as well.  We get glimpses of his early life, his family,( we even learn his full name!) and maybe a tiny bit of insight into how he and Mycroft evolved into the people they are today.

It's hard to believe that anyone will read this review who hasn't already seen Season 3, but in any case, no spoilers are needed to discuss the 3 episodes, because in my mind, the story is less about the crimes solved or the villains apprehended than it is about the friendship between Sherlock and John, the love Mycroft has for his troublesome younger brother, and the evolution of everyone in Sherlock's orbit.  Mrs Hudson, Molly Hooper, Anderson, and of course Mary Morstan - all of them become part of the tapestry that is life at 221B Baker St.
Gatiss and Moffatt have done some masterful writing for this season, and every episode underlines their very genuine love of the Sherlock character, and their devotion to making this a quality show, rather than just a show that will rake in the viewers.  Of course the cast is perfect in every way, but the show would be nothing without he heart and soul infused into it by Gatiss and Moffatt.  Season 4 can't come soon enough.",1394668800,,1369,4.456

5850331,5,B00DRDBTT8,"In Season 3, each story development of all three episodes was quite intriguing with well-written scripts. In particular, I liked the Episode 2 as it incorporated so many different case stories and the little side skits involving many different characters, and the entire tone was light and comical, but had enough substance.  Episode 3 was interesting in that Sherlock reveals a few new sides to him that are very different from the personality of his portrayed in the other episodes; more mature, deliberate, calculating, reserved, and unexpectedly self-sacrificing (?).  One thing I did not get was the real impeding motive for Sherlock to shoot Magnussen, but I suppose the harmful pest must be eradicated at some point, and Sherlock was that pest terminator.  Both Cumberbatch and Freeman were excellent in acting out all the shifting dynamics  throughout these interesting changes and transitions that occur along the story lines.",1394668800,,935,5.297297297297297

5850348,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The cast in this series is superb. I am a Sherlockian for 50 years and this modern twist to one if the best detective series ever written is stellar in its performance, photography, story lines, and direction. It is without a doubt the best portrayal of Conan Doyke's Sherlovk since Basil Rathburn and Dr Watson is finally portrayed as the genius he is!",1394582400,,353,4.619047619047619
5850349,4,B00DRDBTT8,"I'll have to admit that I liked seasons 1 & 2 a little more...  However, I still enjoyed Season 3 and I am looking forward to many more seasons to follow.  Cumberbatch and Freeman are complete opposites in their roles and that is what makes them so interesting to watch...",1394582400,,272,4.42
5850350,5,B00DRDBTT8,This is a very well written and well cast show.  I love how the show pulls you in.  I try to solve the cases too!,1394582400,,113,3.48
5850351,1,B00DRDBTT8,"I was expecting so much more of this series.  I loved the first two seasons, but they have so destroyed everything that was interesting about Sherlock.  Sherlock and Watson used to be cool and actually did detective work.  The characters and mysteries have become ridiculous.",1394496000,19,275,5.066666666666666

5850353,5,B00DRDBTT8,I am a big fan of Sherlock Holmes and this series has me hooked!!  The characters are spot on and what a cast!!!  Not sure who I love more Sherlock or Watson.,1394496000,,158,3.90625
5850354,5,B00DRDBTT8,"No wonder this series is such a big international hit. I like the Blu-ray/DVD versions because they include English subtitles. Some of us have great difficulty understanding all the dialog in these British TV movies. And Benedict talks extremely fast! Seeing the English words on the screen in real-time makes all the difference. And, of course, the quality of the picture and sound and program writing is outstanding.",1394496000,,418,5.161764705882353
5850355,4,B00DRDBTT8,"I have loved all things Sherlock Holmes since I was first introduced to the detective via Jeremy Brett when I was a kid.  I wasn't sure how I would like it reincarnated in modern times, but I had heard so many good things about this series that I decided to give it a whirl -- and I was hooked after that first episode.  The plotlines don't try to copy Conan Doyle's original works, but instead are reinvented with clever tie-ins to the Sherlock Holmes canon.  The characters' personalities are fairly consistent with how they always played out in my mind when reading the books or watching Jeremy Brett.  The mysteries are clever and fitting with the times.  I love the minor characters of Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade, and I am so pleased with the one minor recurring character NOT in the canon, Molly.  The writing is witty, the actors spot-on, the mysteries engrossing.  The only reason I didn't give this five stars was that I wish John Watson would have more opportunities to use his skill sets instead of always relying on Sherlock, but all in all, this is well done and I recommend it.",1394496000,,1089,4.553846153846154
5850356,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Cumberbatch and Freeman deliver another series of tightly woven, fascinating and exciting retellings of Sherlock Holmes. The series has not lost its momentum, if anything, the viewer is already demanding more! The challenge of Moriarity and killing off Sherlock is well handled--we haven't gotten to Rickenbach Falls yet! Watch!",1394496000,,328,5.714285714285714
5850357,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I watched the first episode with my brother, whom I just got hooked on Sherlock, and we were laughing so hard. It's definitely different from the other two seasons, but contrary to other reviewers, I don't think the stories are any less in value or intensity. It is a very character-driven series, but I enjoyed that. The only qualm: it's over far too soon! ;)",1394496000,,360,4.553846153846154

5850359,5,B00DRDBTT8,"ditto from last review:  I love letting you know via the star system that I like an item, but don't always feel inclined to write a review.  I don't like this ""all or nothing"" system.  I'm glad I have the DVDs but have yet to open them.",1394496000,,236,3.978723404255319
5850360,2,B00DRDBTT8,"Seasons 1 and 2 were clever, original, and fresh.  Yes, some episodes were better than others, but, overall, this series became a hit.  This season they seem to have forgotten a few essential components--a plot and a mystery.  (To be fair I have only watched the first two episodes of season 3, but they were more than enough.)  This season is a mess.  Sherlock and John engage is witty (too clever by half, as the Brits would say) conversation that is juvenile, at best.  What a waste of good talent.",1394496000,7,501,4.511111111111111
5850361,5,B00DRDBTT8,"A somewhat flawed Sherlock is presented in season 3. His relationship with his brother Mycroft becomes more acute. The explanation (?) of the season 2 finale is somewhat oblique and confusing, and a new villain is provided, one that is the intellectual equal to Sherlock and Moriarity. I liked them, but they are a little less engaging than season 2",1394496000,,349,4.833333333333333
5850362,5,B00DRDBTT8,I Love this series. Just wish there were commentaries included like the previous two seasons. Still glad to have it though.,1394496000,,123,4.904761904761905
5850363,5,B00DRDBTT8,"By jettisoning Sherlock and Watson into contemporary times, the smoke screen of the Victorian era no longer plays such a prominent role in the characters of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  The human relationships play a dominant part of the series and that is what has made the duo outlast the test of time. It's also what makes any book, television show, or movie successful.  The mysteries are good and the actors that play the roles are outstanding.  If there was a negative it's that we have to wait two years between seasons and I think that is a bit long.",1394496000,,554,4.52
5850364,5,B00DRDBTT8,Each season just keeps getting better and better with this program. I'm so disappointed it's taking 2 years between seasons. The BBC is really ramping up the programs coming out of England. My husband and I love the action and humor of Sherlock. Keep them coming!!,1394409600,,264,4.760869565217392
5850365,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This is a terrific show! I was hooked on Cumberbatch's interpretation of Sherlock Holmes straight away. I find it rather amusing to see him play such an aloof and eccentric role and pull it off magnificently. Martin is most excellent as well. They are a great pairing and I hope to see much, much more the duo in the future!",1394409600,,324,4.416666666666667

5850367,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The series is outstanding. I wasn't sure how they were going to continue the momentum but they did. I am anxiously awaiting the next season. I think we will see more of Moriarity, or his clone.
Benedict Cumberbatch and Freeman are superb. Big Brother Mycroft is a real scene stealer as well. Kudos to all who crafted this fine series.",1394409600,,334,4.583333333333333
5850368,2,B00DRDBTT8,"which is in the description, so I find that I have decidedly wasted 26 min.  Basically they tell you what was already strongly suspected...there IS no answer, because the writers couldn't come up with anything that would make enough sense to satisfy the critics.  They bit off more than they could chew with the suicide scene, and couldn't figure a way out of it.  Pretty cheap, if you ask me.  They tried to play it off with humor with fake explanations, but self deprecation aside, they really kinda insulted the intelligence of the fan.  Pretty good series...but that unexplained death of the star...any show can do that.",1394409600,5,624,4.794392523364486
5850369,4,B00DRDBTT8,"Was really looking forward to hearing some commentary on the episodes, and was sorely disappointed that there wasn't any.  Not on any of them.  So if you're looking for that level of detail, it's missing from the Series 3 set.  Overall there are fewer extras than on Series 1 & 2.  Guess they're all too busy.",1394409600,,309,4.464285714285714
5850370,5,B00DRDBTT8,"What's to say?  It's Sherlock & Watson.  One has to pay attention to the ""small talk"" between those two.  For instance, the drunk scene and the need to sleep and conduct business a t the same time--hilarious.

5850373,3,B00DRDBTT8,"I consider this season not as good as season 1, and season 2. It looked to me as if I was watching a different kind of TV Show, more like a soap-opera.",1394409600,3,151,3.75
5850374,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I have always been a Sherlock Holmes fan and have read every book and story. I was skeptical of a modernized version, and while it has its modern quirks, Benedict Cumberbatch really captures the essence of  Sherlock without going over the over the top with it. His co-star as Dr. Watson really also makes the show. He is a pivotal character and perfect in the role. Can't wait for new episodes!",1394409600,,394,4.549295774647887

5850376,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I know a lot of people have said that this season wasn't as good as 1 & 2. And that the producers ""have jumped the shark"" as the saying goes. But I disagree. I loved this season! Yes, there is some awkwardness in the beginning between John and Sherlock, but they haven't seen each other in 2 years, and in that time John eventually moved on. A lot of people have said that the character of Sherlock isn't the same as he was way back in seson 1, just because the writers have decided to bring out his humanity a little more. As for the shift between John and Sherlock, people change, relationships and friendships change, that's just life. And if it can happen to us in the real world, then why not have it happen in a fictional one? This by the way, does not mean that I agree with everything the writers did. Do I wish some things may have been handled differently? Yes. However, I still enjoyed the season overall and I can't wait for season 4!",1394409600,,946,4.261111111111111

Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman have definitely raised the bar for anyone undertaking their respective roles. Well acted and well done throughout!!",1394409600,,563,4.98936170212766

Every now and then you'll see a plot point or a joke coming a mile away. 99% of the time you are kept glued to the screen to see what's going to happen next.

The mysteries are actually mysterious, not dumbed down for a broader audience.  Well worth watching repeatedly to catch all of the British idioms and word play.

Suggest you watch the entire series in order to understand the resolution of the previous serie's cliff hanger.

There was humor, tension, thrills and so much heart. I highly recommend the entire series, which has a throughline of character development and excellent writing. The cast is perfect, from the leads to the supporting roles. Enjoy! The game is on!",1394150400,,408,4.927536231884058
5850425,2,B00DRDBTT8,"I loved Seasons One and Two so I preordered Season Three. As far as the episodes are concerned, the scenes are splintered so you can't really follow what's going on. But with the DVD I turned on the subtitles so I could read what the actors are saying and that helped me understand a lot more. Like the rest of the SHERLOCK fans, I wanted to find out how he faked his death. We're shown  some possibilities but in an interview Mark Gatiss laughs, ""Sherlock wouldn't have explained how he did it."" Ha, ha, ha. There's not a knock-down-drag-out between Sherlock and John when John finds out Sherlock didn't let him know he was still alive but that issue just kind of dissipates over several scenes. The Sign of the Three -- I did think it was hilarious when Sherlock got drunk with John and his on-screen deductions were in triple-vision and his Best Man's speech very poignant. That gave me hope that was unjustified for His Last Vow. Magnussen was not creepy and mysterious like Moriarty, but repellent. Urinating in the fireplace? PLEASE! He doesn't have documents to blackmail people with but it's all in his head. How does that work? In the closing scenes, Sherlock shoots Magnussen in front of John, his brother Mycroft, and asst military personnel. Sherlock has to be whisked out of the country for this -- like they couldn't have covered it up -- because of all the trouble it would cause if he stood trial for murder. Not to worry: this is resolved in a matter of seconds when Sherlock's helicopter is recalled so he can handle a case that would be too difficult for anyone else.

So far, I have watched maybe a third of The Empty Hearse but have not felt inclined to turn the DVD player on again.",1394150400,4,1704,4.529220779220779

The way back however, is not as smooth as it should be thanks to Sherlock's problems adjusting to London after dismantling Moriarty's network.  The first episode Sherlock must convince Watson to join him once more.  The third and final episode Sherlock faces a blackmailer who has hooks in many people including the leaders of the nation that leads to a bombshell of an ending.",1394150400,,545,4.827956989247312

I like a show with well defined characters that are challenged by the story. I enjoy the fact that the writers lead you on to believe that Sherlock is challenged but only by the limitations of the pyhsical universe. Sherlock is the best super hero, I like him even better than batman. What is great about him is that he is almost believable as a real person but not quite. Great show! :)",1394150400,,539,4.346534653465347

I have long been a fan of most anything on BBC/PBS, and was not disappointed.  This program is great.  Funny, heartfelt, and intense.  Benedict Cumberbatch & Martin Freeman, along with the entire supporting cast are a joy to watch.  It wasn't until after I started watching, that I learned it generally takes 2 years between series.  I am not sure I can wait that long!  I will just have to immerse myself in all things Cumberbatch, there is no lack of them.

I have a mile long list of BBC shows I love but this one tops it. It's witty, challenging, and all around great. Definitely worth watching!!",1393977600,,276,4.326923076923077
5850447,3,B00DRDBTT8,"This is simply not the same series as the six episodes which preceded. I understand that as time progresses, characters can legitimately change, but it is good to actually witness the change in progress, not have them foisted on us like a surprise party. This was a bridge too far. I don't mind the idea of an updated internet-age Sherlock Holmes -- I thought the first two seasons were brilliant. However I cannot quite swallow a Holmes who does what this Holmes does in the final bit of the last episode of the third season. Vigilantism, to say the least, but it goes beyond that. I will say no more lest it be a spoiler. And then to imagine John's wife as having the former life established for her in that same episode. Does not compute.

A last complaint -- Sherlock Holmes has always been first and foremost about solving mysteries. This season is more about relationships. The main plot (the crime or puzzle to be solved) becomes almost a sub-plot.

You may like the changes. You may not mind the rather frivolous attitude toward character development. I thought season 3 was clever in a sort of glib off-the-hand way, and it passed the time. It simply does not seamlessly connect with what came before. And the final scenes left a bad taste on the palate. A warning to audition this before actually laying down good money.",1393977600,2,1330,4.6075949367088604

5850458,5,B00DRDBTT8,"As in the case of the previous seasons, this continues to be a great series, though truthfully I did not recognize any of the stories being from the original Sherlock Holmes. It tends to be a rather confusing situation at times and requires more concentration to follow the storyline. SPOILER ALERT: if you haven't seen the third series yet, you might want to skip this part of the review. The first story spent some time on how Sherlock faked his death. The end of the second DVD tantalizes one on how his archenemy seemingly faked his. Watching this Sherlock is like eating a bag of potato chips. Once you start, you don't want it to end, but it does much too quickly. Why do the Brits only make four or five episodes a season? Hopefully, there will be more to come, especially in light of the ending. I don't have cable or satellite TV, so I have to wait for the DVDs, which means it's a long wait to see any more of this series.",1393891200,,932,4.331428571428572

The whole second episode, we were hoping that bloody Mary would turn out to be either the next victim or the criminal mastermind - so that in either case, we would be rid of her following this episode.

The camera reveals an aging process that success and critical acclaim seem to breed. This year they've (actors and writers for sherlock) become self aware, much like we fear our computers might change someday. The scenary is still lovely England, the stories, at least early in season 3, are mostly reflexive of the first 2 years success. Fingers crossed, it is still far and away above American writing.

I feel that the story should not be cluttered up with special effects that are on the screen for seconds and words are too small to read easily. nor should we constantly have to go back and forth in time to understand the outcome.

aside from that, the actors and actresses are wonderful and are perfect in their roles.

I've heard that in season 4 we're going to meet up with moriarity again. didn't he blow his brains out? I don't like bring characters back from the dead like that. (except for Sherlock's 'suicide', of course.) let the villains RIP and give us something new.",1393459200,,890,4.55

The interchange between Sherlock and John is so unique to watch. Sherlock with his fast moving self and John (Dr. Watson) with his low key approach to life. I am not sure how to describe this show except that it is must see TV. It is rated TV-14 so you have a bit of gore here and there, however, not that much. The story lines are tremendous and one path leads you down another and another. I would suggest starting with Season 1 and working your way through until Season 3 so you don't have any spoilers by working your way backwards. The acting from Benedict Cumberbatch is second to none. No one can act and portray Sherlock as he does. There are not that many episodes per season so start watching and you will not be able to stop.

5850533,2,B00DRDBTT8,"While I realize that the producers/writers/creators of the series don't want to give a whole lot away for the upcoming Season 3 of 'Sherlock', this preview was regrettably as exciting as watching the proverbial paint dry. At first I didn't mind watching the minds behind it all give some insight on what we viewers would see in upcoming episodes (without spoiling things after the massive cliffhanger of Season 2), but considering there is a new season, and considering we heard little comments like ""Well, Watson has moved on"" or ""Well, when Watson learned Holmes was alive in the Conan Doyle books he reacted this way..."" we sort of know how things will move along.

I had just hoped we might see a bit more 'behind the scenes' -- not a static shot of three individuals sitting on a sofa or in chairs, talking and talking and talking and talking. Unfortunately, I didn't learn a lot that would get me excited about the new season; I don't feel that watching these people share ""insider's"" information that we in the audience can't share, and then spreading it out over not one but two parts gave me much insight. I wasn't expecting to see actual full scenes from season 3, but a short interview with the actors might have been nice, and at the very least one with Martin Freeman, who now has even more worldwide attention after his performance as Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit' trilogy.

I'll be watching the third season when it finally arrives in the U.S. because I'm a fan of the series. I have a feeling that all involved will continue the high quality we've already seen, and it will be interesting watching how the cliffhanger will be solved; how Sherlock recovers the loss of his reputation, and how the Holmes-Watson relationship will proceed. I'm just thankful this preview was free as I would have been very disappointed paying for roughly 10 minutes of learning little outside what I've already learned about online. However, if you've tried to stay clear of online news you might find these videos of minor interest.",1393286400,,2045,4.75774647887324

5850542,3,B00DRDBTT8,"I do believe Gatiss and Moffat have jumped the shark.  Both men are so busy...perhaps they had to resort to fanfic for inspiration?

First, the good news: even when it's bad, Sherlock is still better than most anything else on TV.  Series 3 is worth watching.  Its entertaining.  Production values are still high.  The actors do a good job with the material they are given.  The bad news: The storylines are rubbish  frenetic and disjointed with no clear resolution or adequately defined or developed antagonist.  You cannot just reuse plot devices from the first two seasons and transport them to the third without some supporting story (the whole wall-of-clues thing  the antagonist was never adequately identified imo).  Its just not must-see television for me anymore.

Ill try to avoid spoilers:  The first two series are (forgive the clichs) fast-paced, edgy and centered on the mystery to be solved, closely followed by the relationship between Sherlock and John.  Sherlock is brilliant, arrogant, abrupt and emotionally stunted.  Watson is no goofy sidekick, but an intelligent individual who does more than just stand by and watch Sherlock solve crimes.  Moffat and Gatiss had taken the Sherlock Holmes franchise and almost flawlessly re-imagined them for the 21st century.

Season 3 is a major disappointment.  What was once genius has been reduced to Sherlock and Watsons Excellent Adventures, where an obnoxious-but-brilliant sociopath and his lovable sidekick stumble through some mysterious doings while navigating the river of bromance.  I was willing to suspend belief for the first episode, but The Sign of Three pushed me closer to the edge.  The whole pub-crawling-drunk-buddies scenario was at least ten minutes too long, and I found my mind wandering during the entirely-too-long-lets-get-on-with-it speech/plot device to where I had previously seen Major Sholto (he played Major Gordon on the fantastic BBC production, Cranford).  And Sherlock admitting that hes a big baby?  Um, no.  Sherlock was acting more like Steve from Coupling thenwaitdidnt Moffat create/write that also?  Hmmm  Warm and fuzzy Sherlock is the stuff of fangirls and should remain there.",1393200000,6,2182,5.347058823529411

Two years elapse from that faithful day when Sherlock must try to stop some terrorists who are going to blow up a strategic part of London.  Sherlock decides he needs his friend and sidekick Watson to help. Holmes always picks the right moment to reveal himself...on a night Watson is planning to propose marriage to a new lady friend who we just meet.  Watson does not take Holmes re-appearance well....

The highlight remains the witty banter between the two stars. The way their relationship is explored through the events depicted is extremely entertaining. Holmes' social awkwardness and Watson's pugnacious nature are on display to great effect. As for the actual episodes themselves, Holmes' wedding speech and the odious villain in episode three were the highlights. The show continues to be deliciously physical and it's almost worth keeping a list of the reasons various friends get to punch or slap Holmes. While this is a superbly written series that updates the original characters in interesting and highly entertaining ways, there are occasional plot developments that seem a bit far-fetched or are in some way unsatisfying. These moments are very much in the minority though. Sherlock continues to be a leading contributor to what is a Golden Age in television.

As in previous seasons, there are many tributes to the original stories by Conan Doyle which I always find witty and enjoyable, and keep discovering more every time I watch the show - and, at last count, I have watched the three episodes of Season 3 four times already, and have lost count of how many times those of Sessions 1 and 2. (For those who might be interested in reading the original stories: there is an inexpensive two-volume paperback edition of ""Sherlock Holmes, the Complete Novels and Stories"" published by Ballantine in its ""Classic"" series.)
Now, to the problems I see with the plots of the latest ""Sherlock"" episodes.
Gentle reader: if you happened to be one of the very few people in the planet that are fans of ""Sherlock"" but do not know by now ""how he did it"" and seen, or at least read or heard about the stories told in each of the three episodes of Season 3, please stop reading now!
To everybody else who bother to keep reading: these are the problems with the plot I see that make the whole Season 3 deserve only four stars (this is, of course, just my own opinion, and there is always the possibility that I might be wrong).
Episode 1, ""The Empty Hearse"": No matter how it was done, Jim Moriarty had people watching to see if Sherlock jumped and died -- or not -- in order to send word to go ahead to the hit men prepositioned to kill Inspector Lestrade, Ms. Hudson, and John Watson if he did not, and to call off the hit if he did. Those people had to be in places where they had a clear view of the front of the Hospital, including the likely impact area of Sherlock's body (were he to jump), namely the sidewalk. It was only John and we, the TV viewing audience, that shared his point of view, that were unable to see that place. Moriarti's people did not share this handicap. In fact, towards the end of the episode, we see what the sniper tasked with killing John saw through his rifle scope: the head of John, who, by then, was standing on the sidewalk next to where Sherlock was lying. Obviously, the sniper had had a clear view of that place all along and could not have failed to realize that the whole thing was just a trick, however cleverly done.
Episode 2, ""The Sign of Three"": The case of ""The Bloody Guardsman"" involves stabbing through the abdomen from the back with a roast beef skewer, or some such implement. The victim not only does not feel the injury, but continues to do whatever he was doing for quite some time afterwards without noticing anything wrong (and that included eating a hearty meal in the case of Major James Sholto), in spite of having had, at the very least, their intestines and stomach perforated. The excuse offered for this was that both victims were wearing very tight military uniform belts, so they did not bleed outwardly. But: No deadly internal hemorrhages? Not going into shock pretty soon afterwards? Not excruciating pain (anybody that has ever been punched in the solar plexus or had a gastric ulcer knows that the intestines and stomach are very well innervated). And what was the (supposedly) clever assassin thinking when he ""experimented"" first with a guard of Buckingham Palace, while he was on duty at a place heavily guarded by much more than two ramrod stiff men in quaint uniforms? What if the ""experiment"" went wrong there and then?
Episode 3, ""His Last Vow"": How did Sherlock and John manage to get John's gun (that he was carrying in his coat pocket when leaving Sherlock's parents' house) past the inevitable and very thorough weapons' search the fearsome (and, as seen earlier in the episode, thoroughly competent) minions of Charles Augustus Magnussen were going to subject them even before they would let them board their helicopter, let alone actually reach CAM's presence at his nest of villainy in ""Appledore""?
Well ... I don't really mind that much the flaws I see in the stories, because I enjoyed them very much, warts and all, but I can't help wondering how they could have possibly been allowed to happen in a show of this extraordinarily high caliber, with such a huge, dedicated and attentive audience following it, obsessing over it, and fastidiously dissecting it, in the first place?",1393113600,2,4439,4.634517766497462

5850569,4,B00DRDBTT8,"I have been a huge fan of this series, and think that Seasons 1 & 2 were flat-out brilliant.  I loved watching all of Season 3, and am still astounded both by Martin Freeman's portrayal of Watson, and how Watson has been written in this show - a much closer Watson to the intelligent and articulate Watson in the books than I have seen in ANY other filmed version.  However, there are some flaws this season - there is a bit too much focus on film technique and less on the mystery, the deductions, the depth of character.  I think Magnusson was very badly overdone - he's a very awful villain, but actually TOO awful - I literally cringed at scenes he was in.  Andrew Scot's portrayal of Moriarity, on the other hand, made me laugh out loud with delight over and over, even (maybe especially) when he was being evil.  Not only was he written brilliantly, but Scott's acting is flawless.  And that leads me to the final flaw I found - I knew (from the end of Season 2) that they would have to find a way to bring Moriarity back, so the ""surprise"" at the end of Season 3 was no surprise to me.  And I wanted to be surprised.  I do, however, have high hopes for season 4 with the return of Scott's Moriarity - and I hope I'm not disappointed.  Get back to Sherlock's ability to reason, and Watson's ability to humanize him, and throw in Andrew Scott's brilliant acting, and it should be a fine season.",1393113600,2,1399,4.309160305343512
5850570,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Superb everything. This high functioning sociopath and his adrenaline junky side-kick are great fun to watch. The mysteries are fair play, the writers give you everything you need to solve the puzzles, and the humor is priceless.",1393113600,,229,5.216216216216216

5850572,5,B00DRDBTT8,Amazing show amazing season. I love Sherlock the characters are awesome and there are some great new twists. It's a must see.,1393113600,,125,4.7272727272727275
5850573,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I realize that this show is a monster hit, both here and in England (and maybe other places too).  It isn't a fluke.  The writing is very good.  The acting is outstanding.  The writers delve more and more into the supporting characters as time goes on.

Season 3 is no exception to what I wrote concerning season 1 and 2.  We get more inside of Sherlock's head this time around - and some very strange things are there.  It is amazing that two great actors can occupy the screen at the same time with a ""lesser: character and have the third character carry the scene.  Such is the writing and acting, that it is carried off.

Seeing Sherlock deliver the speech as the best man is worth the price of the set.  But we get so much more.  And the ending of season 3?  Wow!  I cannot wait for season 4.

Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are just so damn good in these roles that any future tellings of these tales will have trouble overcoming the job this crew and these actors have done.  They are now Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson.",1393113600,2,1040,4.316062176165803
5850574,5,B00DRDBTT8,"There are just so many parts to this series that are so original, from the presentation of what's in Sherlocks mind, to the action sequences (albeit occasional), to the pace and editing. Not to mention the performances, of course. And not just the main characters-Cumberbatch or Freeman-but everyone in the supporting roles too. Just fantastic. I have not seen TV this good in many years.",1393027200,,388,4.984615384615385
5850575,5,B00DRDBTT8,"For two years fans of Sherlock have waited to learn how, or if, the great detective survived his leap from the Reichenbach tower in London.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman were otherwise engaged in New Zealand and other places filming The Hobbit trilogy, but fear not, once they returned they found time to make three excellent new episodes of our favorite detective series: ""The Empty Hearse,"" ""The Sign of Three,"" and ""His Last Vow.""  Each episode is approximately 90 minutes long.  The two DVD set also includes three intriguing featurettes ""The Fall,"" ""Villains and Speculation,"" and ""Shooting Sherlock.""

When I first heard that the Sherlock Holmes stories were being redramatized set in the 21st century I cringed in horror.  Nothing is so quintessential Holmesian as gas lamps, hansom cabs, and Victorian clothing, I thought.  How wrong I was! These reimaginings of Doyle's stories with skyscrapers and smartphones are brilliant achievements.

In Season 3 we see Holmes reintroduced to the world.  The mystery behind what actually happened on top of the Reichenbach tower is resolved, (or is it?)  Moriarty is dead (perhaps), but there's another master criminal at work. John Watson's life has taken a new turn into wedded bliss (possibly), but his often exasperated devotion to Holmes continues.  It's all great fun and extremely fast paced (you'll want to keep a finger on the Reverse button so you can make sure you actually saw or heard what you think you did.)  I think my own favorite of these episodes has to be the second one, but I can't really explain why lest I give away too much of the plot.

As is PBS's normal practice parts of each episode were edited out before they were broadcast, so the complete BBC versions to be found in this set will contain some scenes and dialogue which will be new to Americans.  Don't hesitate, the game is afoot!",1393027200,2,1874,4.911111111111111

We get that already.  We don't need a long, drawn out, dramatic scene in every episode where they confess their devotion for one another.  Back to solving crimes, please. More incredible desuctions from Mr Holmes.  That's what made us fall in love with him in the first place.  ""Brainy is the new sexy,"" after all.",1393027200,,490,4.586206896551724

5850598,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Having watched and loved the first two seasons (or series if you're on the other side of the pond), it felt like an eternity waiting those two years since the conclusion of season 2.  Thankfully, the waiting was more than worth it!  Just the first episode alone was worth the price of admission (money and the aforementioned wait).  Now I'm no expert on Sherlockian lore but I love the cinematic/television Sherlock universe.  This one stands with the various movies and series' of its respective past; quite proudly, might I add.

I know there was some complaints about the handling of Sherlock's character; that somehow he got somewhat soft, that he seemed more human.  How is this a complaint?  I think that him becoming more human makes his character more relateable.  This seems to be case in episode 2, ""The sign of three"".  I find that it fits with Lestrade's quote to Watson in the first episode, ""He's a great man. With a little help, someday, he might even be a good one"".

Third times the charm, as they would say; the same can be said of this series as well.",1392940800,2,1070,4.58421052631579

5850601,1,B00DRDBTT8,"Nothing spells FAILURE like a spin off TV show from a movie. Few exceptions come to mind like 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Serenity' (I'm almost through with Season 01 after seeing the movie 'Firefly.')
Aside from those two successful examples, this 'Sherlock' is just a sad attempt to ""modernize"" what Robert Downey Jr. made great.
This weak sauce attempt to be edgy has failed miserably from the very beginning. After watching the first episode, I was being lead to believe that these was some sort of culminating event leading up to where this one takes place, but the explaination simply never transpires.
Confusion passing off as provocative storytelling and everyone just silently nods in agreement.  If you vocalize that you do not understand it, than you are the fool?  No, I will not subscribe to such an imbecile thought process or a complete lack thereof.
This explains why the show only lasted three episode on PBS of all places.
It is no wonder why PBS is always holding telethons begging people for money.

I can list ten other noteworthy detective shows on TV I rather watch:
10) Gerald McRaney and James Parker: Simon & Simon

I enjoyed the humor between Sherlock and Mycroft and Sherlock and John.  Sherlock's parents were fun (Sherlock was kinda mean to them in a nice way) and of course, Mrs. Hudson was really cool.  Sherlock's anger came through very well as he could not stand to lose to another.  He hit a new level with his resolution to this.  I can't wait for the next Season.

5850607,4,B00DRDBTT8,"To sum it up, before I sink into possibly spoilery depths, I felt while watching that Season 3 was a long and often frustrating bridge between Season 2 and the so-far-unknown Season 4.  The writing was uneven, with illogical and stupid behavior exhibited by major characters practically punching me in the face.  The cinematography was different as well, although not worse; the sound however suffered and dialogue was muffled in spots.  Extras on the blu-ray were a bit thin compared to the other seasons.  None of the episodes were provided commentary by the cast and crew.  The addition of the Christmas clip, Many Happy Returns, would have been nice.

The season's criminal mastermind was Charles Augustus Magnussen who, unlike Moriarty's insidious presence in Seasons 1 and 2, got major play only in the final episode.  He was appropriately sleazy and slimy, and I'll just leave his treatment by the show at that.  Family matters and relationships were the season's predominant arc, not brain-teasers.  The mysteries were...dull.  Numerous characters' back-stories were provided instead and there was some character development.  I'll even admit to being interested in knowing more about the Sherlock family.  In small doses.  However, not a few motivations and actions strained believability, and some completely destroyed it.

The episodes - so many winks and nods to the fandom, or a niche of the fandom, it was as if the 4th wall wasn't even built first to be subsequently broken.  You whip off that scarf, Sherlock!  Brag about the number of (admittedly fabulous) coats, collar turned up of course, that you have.  There is shirtless Sherlock, bloody shirtless Sherlock.  Sherlock in shackles and Holmes with handcuffs.  Even a slash! Sherlock pops up, as does Liplock Sherlock (and I may have muttered ""You lucky b! tch"" at the screen.  More than once).  Surely there were enough gif-able scenes to last at least 10 years.  The actors made the episodes watchable, even enjoyable at times, but I pray the writers got all of the giggles out of their system.

I hope that the last scene in the finale indicates a return to the sparkling fast-paced wit and story lines which made most of Seasons 1 and 2 so watchable.  Three and a half stars, rounded up, because - sentiment.",1392854400,6,2282,4.992042440318302

And I'm sorry, but in the the third episode, it seems like BBC basically copy-pasted River Song's profile into Mary's profile.  It works great (how couldn't it?) but still the more we find out about Mary the more I'm reminded of River song.
...For those who know who River Song is...",1392768000,,323,4.568965517241379

5850619,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I just watched the first season last December as a recommendation from my son.  I was amazed at the writing and casting in this show.  It is intelligent enough to engage adults and techie enough for teenagers.  I was worried a new, young version of Sherlock and Watson would be cheesy and thinly plotted.  It turns out to be a tour de force of incredible acting and writing.  Season 2 and 3 keep getting better than ever.  Do yourself a favor and start watching this show.",1392768000,,472,4.430232558139535
5850620,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This is a very clever and interesting Sherlock Holmes.  They have updated the characters without totally corrupting the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  It is worth watching.  Do not mix this up with the American version, which is TERRIBLE.  These are really good actors with authentic British pedigree.

Because the Sherlock series (BBC/Masterpiece Mystery on PBS) is the best thing to hit the airwaves in a very long while! The casting, the writing, the acting, the chemistry between the characters- all of it is amazing!

I can't think of higher praise for a series than to say that it honors the originals so well and yet gives you something so deeply interesting, witty and fun to look forward to. We want more episodes! I have only the tiniest complaint in that it looks as though they will follow suit with other screen versions and give Moriarity far more screen time than he's due given his minor and short role in the originals...goodness leave him over the cliff and do something else.",1392768000,2,817,4.72027972027972

once and awhile. ha !  Watson and the wife - well it works to my surprise, once again do to great acting and writers.  Well all I can

5850639,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Without a doubt, this series is a love letter from Sherlock to John, even if John doesn't see it as clearly as he should.  There are such special moments in these three episodes.  The stag party that only contains John and Sherlock may be my favorite of all.

Amanda Abbington is a wonderful addition to the cast.  I'm intrigued by her and wondering what they will do with the character based on what was shown in ""His Last Vow"".",1392681600,,429,4.3924050632911396

5850659,2,B00DRDBTT8,"I mean really, what happened?  This show had everything going for it.  I loved seasons 1 & 2.  I had already pre-ordered season 3, I mean how could it not be great?  Well, I just canceled that order.  Episode 1 was OK, with some clever answers to how Sherlock survived.  Episode 2 was so bad that I want that 90 minutes of my life back.  I mean do I really care that Mrs. Hudson used to have great sex with her hubby, or that Molly is having great sex now?  Plus Sherlock and John get drunk and make complete fools of themselves for what seems like half the show.  This is the kind of crap that is on every network TV show in the U.S.  It has replaced the fine writing that we saw in the first two seasons.  Episode three was better then 2, but that really wouldn't take much.  I may buy episode one on streaming video.  It's the only one I really would care to watch again.  Evidently the creators are aiming it all that the hormone driven fan girls and boys who can't wait for Sherlock to jump in the sack with somebody or anybody.

5850666,5,B00DRDBTT8,I thought season 3 stepped it up a notch from season 2 and the ending (won't give it away) was a nice twist several times! The acting again was superb and the evolution of the characters lead to a much deeper dive in season 3. Highly recommended!,1392595200,,246,4.25531914893617

5850679,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Quite simply the acting is brilliant, the cinematography on par with a full featured movie , and the scripting outstanding.

The ninety minute episodes are great, allowing more time  for plot lines, suspense, and character interactions to become fully realized.  Thereby the viewer is more drawn into each show.

Last, having fewer episodes during a season proves a great advantage.  It means more money being funneled into hiring great actors, top notch writers, and taking long meticulous care during scene shots.  Yeah, tremendous formula for success!  I hope the profile is emulated with other shows.",1392595200,,604,5.294736842105263

Martin Freeman as John Watson is a revelation, if you've not seen him in anything else don't worry, he's utterly brilliant in every single thing he does. So sure, go on and throw your money at this, it's worth it's weight in gold....and if you've not paid attention to the price of gold? That's saying A LOT.",1392508800,,726,4.549618320610687

It's entertaining in a manner that is as pretentious as the creators of the series render Sherlock and Mycroft.  It's nothing more than a comic book for adults and not a very good one at that.

5850694,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Season 3 Of Sherlock ended up being a bit of a tease for something that promises to be shocking with the return possibly of Moriarty.

What we got in season 3 was a little more shading on our main protagonists. The shocker of course is Mary, and it portends of a bigger role for Mrs. Watson in the future. We thought she was a sturdy, stiff upper lipped, handsome good woman. What we find out is she can be a wild card.",1392422400,,419,4.109756097560975
5850695,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Finally got this in the mail after an ice delay (In the deep south no less!). Couldn't wait to watch it, and once I started I just couldn't stop. I loved the first episode, where Sherlock comes back from the dead (oops - spoiler alert, although I think everyone knew this was coming).  By the way, Sherlock really does reveal the actual solution to his fan club president near the end of the first show. (I found this out in the Special Features where they talk about it). I love the way that Sherlock is so brilliant, and a bit of a trickster, and yet totally clueless when it comes to his friend John.

The second show (there are three in each Season) was enjoyable in a different manner, where again Sherlock is clueless about his friend John's wedding, yet manages to pull off one of the best Best Man speeches ever despite a train-wreck of a start.

The third show starts with some pure evil and we discover yet another side of Sherlock - the sociopath. If he seems a bit too human at the beginning of this show, worry not - he really is the same old Sherlock - maybe even worse. He is also revealed to be very loyal to the wedding promise he made.

And the cliffhanger at the end? WATCH THE FINAL SHOW TO THE END OF THE CREDITS. OMG - really? Can it be? Wait until next season... (there go my finger nails - I hope they are true to the book series, but at the same time I can't wait to see the twist they put on it)",1392422400,3,1421,4.156363636363636

I love this season & have watched it several times now. Not sure if I am swallowing the explanation for how ""it"" was done but I love all the red herrings they threw at us! DVD arrived in good condition and earlier than expected. Give this one a try. Some fans said they only watched part of Episode One and got so angry they turned it off & never watched it any further. What a shame! This is different than Season 1 and Season 2, but I think it has its own merits. Come on, SHERLOCK fans, get off your high horse and give it a chance!",1392422400,,876,4.189349112426036

5850730,2,B00DRDBTT8,"This series has inspired more mood swings in me than I care to count. I initially had a disappointing reaction to Season One, feeling that while there was incredible wit and invention in the updating of Holmes and company, the characters were really new personages using the old names. I also was put off by what I considered somewhat muddled storytelling that employed far too many coincidences and easy ways out situations. Eventually, however, I grudgingly found myself liking these versions of Holmes and Watson so much that I was able to live with the first three tales in the series. Season Two struck me as an improvement, in the sense that the characters seemed a bit more in line with the originals, though Sherlock himself struck me as still too childish and unmindful of others. Indeed, I liked everything about Season Two except the constant sticking point: Very poor plots.

The end of the sophomore year set us up for The Return, since at the end of the sixth episode Holmes had stepped off the top of a building and presumably died, as confirmed by Watson himself. Yet we knew Sherlock would come back -- the only question was, how would he have done it? Sadly, Season Three never tells us. In the episode ""The Empty Hearse,"" we get three hypothetical answers, all of them ludicrous in the extreme, but never an honest, truthful one. So, well, I guess we just take The Return as a given. I guess Sherlock is so damned good that logical justifications and explanation are unnecessary. There is hubris, and then there is hubris. Obviously, the writers of this series have that quality in abundance.

The episode ""The Sign of Three"" hinges upon a method of murder that makes no sense to me. I can't go into detail for fear of spraying the reader with spoilers, but despite the argument for why the victim would not die immediately, would he or she not feel the wound being created? Moreover, we are told at one point that various witnesses have no connection with one another, while minutes later we find out that they do. Ridiculous.

The final installment, which for some unknown reason transforms the canonical Charles Augustus Milverton into Charles Augustus Magnussen, once more drags us through a murky tale whose chief revelation once more is plagued by plot holes and inconsistencies. As I think at least one other reviewer has noted, Season Three drops most of the pretense of mystery in favor of displaying the characters again and again in situations that are endlessly repetitious in tone and, almost, in content. The series is getting drunk on itself. Up to now, I could look the other way when it came to bad storytelling. Not this time around. The Sherlock Schtick is getting old and not enough to enthrall. Please, people: start telling us good stories for a change.",1392422400,10,2794,4.756701030927835
5850731,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Sherlock is a very well written and produced television series, that gives the original slueth's concept a modern edge.

5850732,3,B00DRDBTT8,"Hrm, looks like this review is directed just toward The Empty Hearse. Ah well, close enough, but what I'm mainly going to comment on is the entire third season.

Sherlock Holmes is a coldly calculating, logic driven detective. That's what we all love about him. And this new incarnation with Mr. Cumberbatch began brilliantly. By the end of the first season I'd have said that he supplanted Jeremy Brett. Season Two mostly maintained the quality. The newly conceived dynamic between Watson and Holmes, the brilliant casting and the superb acting, combined with excellent (usually) scripts, created a major win. Although ... as we reached the end of Season Two there began to creep in a bit of ""The Big Wow"" and a loss of the ""ah, that makes sense."" Holes in the overall logic that took away from the overall enjoyment. The worst offender being the final episode.

Would Moffat and company erase that trend and return to what initially grabbed my attention once Season Three began? Sadly not. Rather than tightly scripted and logical stories, the writers seemed to instead demand Bigger, Better, MORE EXCITING!! The writers seemed to think that it was no longer sufficient to solve baffling mysteries. Now each episode had to have monumental stakes. Moriarity was gone and had to be replaced by someone even more dangerous, who wove a web even more insidious and threatening. Worse, in order to make it all ""work"" Sherlock had to experience unexplained gaps in his deductive abilities. In the very first episode he deduced Watson's past from a collection of trifling clues. But now, despite months of close proximity to Watson's new wife, he failed to discern the slightest hint of what's revealed in the third episode. I won't provide spoilers but suffice it to say the lack of insight he was force by the writers to display runs completely at odds with everything they'd created for him at the start.

And to add to the problems, the writers also felt compelled to create the most bizarre and AMAZING backstories and inner motivations to the established characters, little of which felt real or needed or even remotely believable.

So ... three stars overall. Brilliant beginning and a descent into the ridiculous. I rewatched the early episodes repeatedly. The same shan't be happening with the last three. At least I hope they're the last; Sherlock deserves better than to have to endure further indignities of the sort this last season has felt impelled to impose upon him.",1392422400,5,2477,4.91866028708134

Season 3 kicks off well for about half of the first episode, then the second is great (my favorite episode ever of this Sherlock), then is followed by the worst ever episode. The third episode is so bad since it uses so little of what makes these characters great, has terrible pacing, a totally boring villain, and even ends with a -Minor Spoiler incoming- that Moriarty may be coming back. Boo!

I hope season 4 is more consistent in either direction. Hopefully it is better and I can get back to expecting great things from it or it is worse and I can just stop watching.",1392336000,3,760,4.352112676056338

The duo of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman has terrific chemistry (and as we know, Sherlock Holmes was first of all a chemist).  Cumberbatch's Holmes is an indescribable hilarious lunatic genius. The portrayals of the recurring characters (including but not limited to Una Stubbs as Mrs. Hudson; Mark Gatis as Mycroft Holmes and Andrew Scott as Moriarity) shine, as well. The plot lines are a bit over the top which may or may not suit your taste.

Was having an increasingly difficult time telling the 'good' guys from the 'bad' guys, then by the end of episode three, realized there was no difference.  As annoying as the villain was, I think it sends the wrong message, or perhaps it is just an accurate portrayal of present day culture, to portray the ruthless murder of the villain, committed for convenience sake, as a virtue.  The coda was even more lame.  Reminded me of Dr. Who, no matter how many times the Dr. exterminates the Daleks, they seem to always come back, their numbers undiminished.

I found my mind wandering to other things as this season did not keep my interest.  And only three episodes?,...thank God!  They should have paid me to watch this mess.  I was warned by others who saw this season when it originally aired, and said that it was a waste of time, but I did not listen.  Hopefully you will.",1392249600,16,616,4.4375
5850758,3,B00DRDBTT8,"You know, I love the Sherlock series.  It's fun, smart, witty, and simply a joy to watch.  It also does great justice to the original work by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  The acting is top-notch, the writing is amazing, and the cinematography is unique and atmospheric.  As an over-all series, Sherlock is up there with Breaking Bad and The Wire in terms of quality dramatic television.

Though I would give Seasons 1 and 2 five stars each, season three just did not live up to expectations.  It's still a good season, with lots of humor, wit, and smarts.  But something is off in season 3, and the show just never quite recovers from it.

I think the biggest issue with Season 3 was the Watson/Holmes dynamic.  Their relationship has been harmed by Sherlock's deception in the faking of his death, and all three episodes somewhat deal with the mending of their friendship, up to the point where Sherlock makes a gigantic sacrifice for the sake of Watson's happiness.  Though it could be argued that all three seasons have Sherlock going out of his way to protect his best friend, Season 3 is the first time Watson really gets to see and understand the lengths to which Sherlock is willing to go for him.  However, though thematically this is touching, when watching the show you simply notice how awkward it is that Watson and Holmes seem estranged most of the time.  Episode 1 is all about them reconnecting, but you never get the sense that things are ""back to normal"" with them.  I really preferred it when they were roommates and both having to adjust to each other, rather than trying to mend fences after 2 years.

Also, the addition of Watson's love interest, Mary, puts a stumbling block in the Holmes/Watson dynamic as well, since it could be argued that Season 3 is all about her.  The show takes a different tact than the Guy Ritchie movies, where Sherlock was jealous of Watson's affection for Mary.  Here, he's quite civil and understanding of Watson's relationship, and even connects with Mary and likes her, which makes sense considering his ""loner"" status, because Sherlock is a guy used to not having people in his life.  But her introduction to the dynamic just never quite meshed with me - especially after a certain ""shocking twist"" was revealed that caused me to roll my eyes.  Though Sherlock is known for its surprising twists, this time around it felt like they were just trying too hard.

Sherlock, as a series, has always done a great job of taking the original works of Doyle and giving them unique twists to keep hard-core Sherlock fans guessing or giggling, and this season is no different.  Fans of the original Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories will definitely recognize a number of cases that the writers incorporated into this season.  However, unlike previous seasons, many of these cases seem kinda far-fetched within the established universe of the show.  (How does someone not feel being stabbed?  How does a bullet to the chest miss every vital organ and bone and leave no lasting damage?)  I was even able to figure out one of the mysteries in the show before Sherlock did, which is something that never happened before, and made the big reveal feel cheap and sloppy when Sherlock finally caught up with me, the viewer.

Season 3 also takes a slightly different thematic approach to it's narrative than the other two seasons did.  For some reason, the show's creators decided to do lots of ""Time Jumping"" in this season, making me suspect they may have watched a bit too much Pulp Fiction before writing season 3.  The biggest culprit of this is episode 2, The Sign Of Three, where the narrative jumps are so frequent and confusing, it may take some people more than one viewing to understand everything that's going on.

For me, these ""time jumps"" were quite jarring, and tended to take me out of the narrative every time they happened.  The previous two seasons were quite linear, and when they did get ""arty,"" such as when Irene Adler drugs Sherlock, they're never confusing.  However, here, I found the editing between past and present to be quite unenjoyable, particularly during the end of episode 1, and I felt the series used it way too much.

Sherlock is also usually good at tying up plot threads, but I still had a number of lingering questions by the time series 3 had concluded.  Who was behind the terrorist organization in episode 1?  Was Magnenson's eye-read-out part of his mind palace, or a bit of high-tech trickery?  Why was Sherlock coming back from the dead not more of a bigger deal to the world of the show?  Who was the ""other brother"" Mycroft made reference to?  I'm used to some lingering questions, but I felt like most of these answers should have been addressed in this season.

Another huge problem this season is the lack of Moriarty.  Seasons 1 and 2 had this wonderful thread of the Master Criminal running through them, where he was a character in every episode, even if you never saw him.  His rivalry with Sherlock was the thing of legend, and the fact that Sherlock had to step up his game whenever their paths crossed was really fun to watch.  Without a real ""nemesis"" for Sherlock to be pitted against in this season, everything felt a little too episodic for my tastes.

It could be argued that Charles Agustus Magnenson (in the novels, his name was Milverton) was the new nemesis this season.  However, because he's far less known than Moriarty, and we don't really get to meet him until the final episode in the season, he's a non-entity in the first two episodes.  I almost feel as though he should have had a more active role in episodes 1 & 2, so we get a better sense of just how big of a threat he really is.  By the end of episode 3, I feel like he actually eclipsed Moriarty in the ""evil genius"" department, and it would have been nice to have gotten a sense of that in episode 1 so we could see how his shadowy hand touches the things in the lives of Holmes and Watson.  In hindsight, we can see it, but upon initial viewing, it's completely hidden and not in the viewer's mind.

Because of this, episode 2 feels like a complete ""bottle episode.""  The second episode in Sherlock seasons always feels more stand-alone than the first and third, but this one felt so isolated, it was surprising.  This is coupled by the fact that episode 2 is arguably the best Sherlock episode there is when it comes to the Holmes/Watson relationship.  Seeing Sherlock's reaction to Watson asking him to be his best man at his wedding was incredibly awesome, heartwarming, and funny all at once.  And Sherlock's speech at the wedding was truly endearing.  Also, finally getting to see Sherlock drunk was beyond hilarious.  His observational skills while under the influence of alcohol are beyond humorous, and his interactions with drunk Watson are a thing of beauty.

Another issue that was bound to come up was how Sherlock faked his death.  That was the big question after season 2, and frankly, the explanation as to how it was done was disappointing.  The show kinda made fun of this with different characters giving different theories on how it was done, and Sherlock saying ""everyone's a critic"" when he finally reveals how it really happened and the guy listening to his explanation immediately expresses his disappointment and starts pointing out its various flaws.  Unfortunately, as a viewer, I'm more in line with the disappointed ""Sherlockian"" than I am with the snyde Sherlock himself, since the real explanation seemed so convoluted - especially considering the only person who seemed to not be in on the ruse was Watson.

As always, the season ends on a big cliffhanger, and the one this season was quite awesome and is probably going to have a lot of people talking.  I'll just say I don't know how the writers are going to explain this one, but I'm certainly glad they are doing it.

Over-all, this is by far the weakest season of the series, but even a weak Sherlock season is better than 90% of the other TV out there.  Fans of the previous two will not want to miss out on this one, but just be prepared for a slight drop in quality from the previous seasons.",1392249600,5,8155,4.649685973482205

5850763,5,B00DRDBTT8,"it about time!!
the most obvious thing to address is the ""answer"" to two years of debate. just how did Sherlock Holmes cheat death? of course what we finally get is a Rorschact test: a dozen theories of varying plausibility but no definitive ""truth."" seriously, how cool is THAT? who'd've thought that The Usual Suspects would ever influence a Sherlock Holmes production?
but i digress...
Sherlock might've preferred to remain ""dead,"" because upon resurfacing his efforts to navigate Dr. John Watson's world of human passion and/or frailty are as stumbling as ever. his version of a best-man toast is only the most obvious example. he still doesn't quite ""get"" the inherent faux-pas of, say, getting engaged simply to facilitate a burglary. much has been made of the ironic influence of House (himself famously a Holmesian pastiche) on this approach, but there are times when Benedict Cumberbatch's take reminds me of another American television ""hero"" entirely, namely (dare i say it) Dexter. Benedict makes you wonder just how narrowly Sherlock missed having a ""Dark Passenger"" of his own.
(for The Record, it could be argued that the whole ""high-functioning sociopath"" angle gets overplayed from time to time, but it is central to this interpretation, and does have it's moments.)
the major new development is that Watson finally meets and marries Mary Morstan. this could've been shaky ground because there is no greater line drawn in the sand of the ""Sacred Canon."" even those who don't neccesarily resent her for breaking the boys up sometimes wonder what was the point, since Watson still accompanies Sherlock on as many adventures after the wedding. but the redoubtable Moffat and Gatiss managed to make something completely fitting out of the character. only i can't say what because it'd be a ""spoiler."" (i know, most of the audience would know by know, but there are still motions we have to go through. what about people who don't become fans until a couple years from now?)
the major villain this year is Charles Augustus Magnussen, nee' Milverton, who's extortion currently takes the form of tabloid journalism. i said in another review that Milverton is such a great villain that even Moriarty wouldn't want to find himself at his mercy, and the claim stands with Magnussen. this is ironic, given that Moriarty is a genuinely malevolent troublemaker, whereas Milverton/Magnussen isn't much more than an opportunist. where the former wreaks genuine havoc for recreation, the later is simply trying to make a not-so-honest buck. measured by Sherlock's precious ""cold reason,"" Moriarty is the more dangerous. yet, even Sherlock expresses a passionate hatred toward Magnussen, where his feelings toward Moriarty were basically indignation. so the same hats-off to Lars Mikkelson that Andrew Scott earned a season ago.
(which would i rather meet down the proverbial dark alley on the proverbial dark night? i'd rather not have to make that choice, quite frankly.)
one of the cool things about the series is that it makes more room for character study than many prior Sherlock productions have managed. even in the comparatively easygoing form of Basil Rathbone, you just knew Sherlock Holmes had to be an occasionally frustrating person to live with. but it's not an angle that was very much explored before now, possibly because it's the sort of incidental matter that's easy to trim away if the pace starts to slag or whatever. (even Doyle only managed to mention their domestic squabbles in passing once or twice.) the series continues it's tradition of exploring the characters, this year to the seeming expense of the action. it's not really until Magnussen's entrance in ""His Last Vow"" that the good-vs.-evil element makes it all the way to centerstage, and even then it gets a bit sidetracked by character issues.
""The Empty Hearse"" has two driving forces. the first is the aforementioned futile attempt to determine how Sherlock managed not to die. there's a nifty satire of conspiracy theories here. besides, as Steven Moffat says, why would Sherlock Holmes tell anybody?
the real drama, though, boils down to Sherlock begging Watson's forgiveness. those who know their ""Sacred Canon"" will remember that the original Watson got it out of his system with a simple faint, but writer Mark Gatiss wondered how realistic that was. certainly Martin Freeman's Watson never seemed to sort who could forgive such a manipulation so easily.
""The Sign Of Three"" is ultimately a virtual stream-of-consciousness: Sherlock's best man toast basically lists anecdotes from their exploits before the key to a case he couldn't quite crack distracts him completely. of course, through the magic of television, the revelation is just in time to prevent a potential tragedy right there at the wedding, so it's all good.
what's more, the season became something of a family affair. Mary Morstan is played by Amanda Abbington, currently Martin Freeman's significant other. and we meet Sherlock's parents, as played by Benedict's parents.
in short the season doesn't disappoint. it goes off on a couple of left-field tangents which make you wonder if it will, but ultimately it doesn't dare. Sherlock, Watson, and Company and Moffat, Gatiss, and Company alike know better than to let us down.
the big question is, is the third time indeed the ""charm,"" or can they put it off a fourth? i daresay time will tell.",1392249600,2,5404,5.107344632768362

5850778,5,B00DRDBTT8,"For many the third season of ""Sherlock"" was polarizing--season three focused as much on the procedural aspects of solving the crime as on the character development and interaction of Sherlock, Watson, Mary and Mycroft. That unique mixture is also what made the third season so memorable for me--the writers/producers Matt Gatiss and Steve Moffat didn't simply rely on replicating the formula of the two previous seasons but on expanding the characters.

SPOILERS:

The brief third season consisted of three episodes ""The Empty Hearse"", ""The Sign of the Three"" and ""His Last Vow"". There was also a 7 minute short made entitled (which I haven't seen yet and is not on this set --that I have been able to discover so far)  ""Many Happy Returns"" that focus on Watson and Lestrade trying to move on with their lives after the death of Sherlock from season two. Those who have seen it please post your thoughts on whether it is worth while watching.

""The Empty Hearse"" finds Mycroft (Matt Gatiss) going into the field to ""rescue"" Sherlock(Benedict Cumberbatch). Sherlock spent the last two years since his death dismantling Morarity's organization but finds a new challenge when London is threatened by a mysterious terrorist.

""The Sign of the Three"" combines Watson's (Martin Freeman)marriage to Mary (Amanda Abbington)and the murder attempt against someone in the wedding party. Sherlock struggles with trying to come up with a great speech as the best man.

The third episode ties into the first one and an attempt on someone close to Sherlock. ""His Last Vow"" focuses on Sherlock trying to defeat a powerful man (Lars Mikkelsen)for whom information is both the ultimate leverage and punishment for those he dislikes including John Watson. Sherlock must figure out where his new nemesis hides the information he keeps and formulate a plan to destroy it in order to protect his friends and England.

END OF SPOILERS:

The third season looks exceptional on Blu-ray (I'm assuming that the DVD also used the same source transfer so should look good as well). Colors pop and fine detail is exceptionall sharp and crisp. The 5.1 lossless sound comes across with quite a bit of power but dialog is never lost in the detailed soundtrack.

The special features include a trio of featurettes-- ""The Fall,"" ""Shooting Sherlock,"" and ""Fans, Villains, & Speculation.""  My only complaint with the third season set is that there aren't any commentary tracks from the actors, writers or directors who worked on the show. I'm a fan of commentary tracks and find that they are just as insightful (when done correctly)as featurettes while allowing the person doing the commentary to focus (real time)on events that transpired during shooting.

The presentation for ""Sherlock"" remains terrific and the special features present a pretty good peak behind the curtain.

Recommended.",1392163200,,2855,5.103004291845494
5850779,5,B00DRDBTT8,"As I post this review there are already 476 reviews on Amazon (even though the David and BD were just released). This is because Amazon has a ;policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats (Broadcast TV, Amazon Instant, David and BD) together and lists on every format. So I always advise folks to sort by Newest First and then look to see which format the review is covering. Also, As someone has already pointed out, the show which aired on PBS in the US is the EDITED edition, not the original UK one.

With that said, this is review of the BD. If you are coming to this review under Series (Season) 3, then you have probably seen Seasons 1 and 2 already. (If not, go back to the beginning).  At the end of Season 2 the title character dies. Its not really a spoiler to say that he didn't  because  otherwise there would be no Sherlock 3. But I won't reveal why he didn't die. In fact that is the main reason for the first of the 3 (approx.) 90-minute episodes in this third season.  I will admit that since it was at least six months since I watched Season 2,  it took a little while to catch up as the first episode of Season 3 doesnt really replay much of the last seasons ending.

In the bonuses that Ill mention in a minute (or less) one of the co-writers says that the show is NOT a detective story; it is, rather, a story about a detective. This is important because much of the four hours is about the relationship between Sherlock and Watson and a woman. (I told you, no spoilers!). I felt the second of the three episodes dragged more than any other in the series  but that is a subjective opinion. The show is still technically brilliant and the cast is perfect.  There is a new villain introduced in the story arc and, of course there is a cliff hanger at the end of episode 3 because there will be a Season 4.

The BD, of course, looks great and has the same Bonus Features as the David. There are three featurettes, each  running about 15 minutes  each featuring insightful interview segments with the cast members and the production crew:
The Fall  which dissects the finale from  Season 2 and discusses how it was filmed.
Fame, Villains and Speculation  Shows rehearsals, discussion of the script and all the new fans of the show
Shooting Sherlock covers the technical tricks used in the seasons episodes. Youll find that very little CGI effects were used. A lot of specially-designed props were devised.

Since the Instant Video versions do not (to my knowledge) include the 45-minutes of bonuses, I do recommend that real fans go for the Physical disc versions. And if you saw it on PBS and some scenes seemed unfulfilled, then knowing they were edited may help explain that.  The BBC Home Video version is the original shown on the BBC.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

This review isn't only for ""His Last Vow"",  it is actually for all of season 3.

After only the first half hour into the first episode, ""The Empty Hearse"", something about this season felt different.  The acting was superb as usual, the humor was there and there were some good scenes, but something was missing.  I waited until I had seen all 3 episodes before I came to any conclusions.

I think that the issue is with the story.  Making Sherlock more ""human"" is good, but it all came too hard and too fast.  So much of the story was ""over the top"" and unbelievable:  Never really answering the question why John had to wait two years before knowing Sherlock was alive when he's the one that should've known the soonest?  Mary almost killing Sherlock and everyone being ""ok"" with that?  Sherlock making every mistake that could be made?  Sherlock a drug addict?
Sometimes it seemed more of a soap opera or superhero movie than the Sherlock that we were introduced to in the first season.  Much of the mystery itself seemed to be missing, and that's what I thought it was supposed to be.

One of the things that originally made this series great was the uniqueness of the story and that it remained fairly true to the character from the books.  Season 3 has diverged too far from those origins.  I hope that the writers return to the brilliance of the first season in season 4.  If they don't and continue the way that season 3 was heading, Sherlock will become just like every other show.  Sherlock will become ""ordinary"" which is something that he never was.",1392163200,4,1586,4.544169611307421

Season Two was a mixed bag. Some adventures intriguing and well told, others less so.

Season Three, however, is such a total disappointment that I canceled my pre-order after viewing it 'on the air.'

Disappointing how? Instead of interesting characters dealing with interesting mysteries in interesting ways, what Sherlock: Season Three provides is weird characters acting weirdly in unbelievably weird situations,

In my opinion the producers of this series have simply lost their way. They have forgotten what they apparently used to know and appreciate; the very things that have made Conan Doyle's Holmes and Watson endure. Their total believability. Their intelligence. Their honesty. Their goodness. That Holmes and Watson, and the very human mysteries they solved, have been welcome guests in my home in one variation after another, right on through the earlier seasons of this show.

For me the commentaries are one of the biggest reasons I buy TV shows on DVD, so it's definitely disappointing in that respect, but I guess you can't have it come to DVD so quickly and get the best products.

I still love the characters and the modern twists on classic stories, but I like a more focused mystery. I could have done without one of the mysteries being couched in a wedding, but I did enjoy the introduction of Mary, especially her twist in the 3rd episode. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman continue to have excellent chemistry, and I think both inhabit their characters fully and believably.",1392076800,,483,4.694117647058824

Both new DVDs play perfectly on my region 1 player (yay!). The 270 minutes include special features currently unavailable on the streaming version for season 3, though ""meet the makers"" is.  We learn, finally, how scenes were done from the POV of CG artists, film technicians and stunt doubles.  Filming multiple scenarios, shot for ""the fall"" for instance, are discussed in interviews with the actors, directors, producer/creators, and fans.  Also mentioned are ""red herring"" scenes filmed in an effort to stay ahead of the rumor mill.  Discussions on disc 2 are for ""the fall,"" ""shooting Sherlock"" and a piece called ""villains and speculation. "" Subtitles are available if you need them, in english.  Distributed by Warner Home Video in US & Canada, this is a Hartswood Films Production for the BBC.

I heard that some scenes were dropped in production.  I too prefer more content, but this is the only dvd available and I don't want to wait.  So happy my husband thought of this for Valentine's Day. High quality, Awesome!",1392076800,4,1243,4.848341232227488

5850810,5,B00DRDBTT8,"*This review may contain spoilers for this series. If you haven't seen it, don't read.*

Many other people have written brilliant reviews on the series itself, which I will let stand for themselves.

However, I was, disappointed, for lack of a better word, with the DVD extras.

I, like many other people, pre-ordered this box set the moment it was available. I was happy with the extras on the prior two seasons, so the fact that there was no information on the extras prior to my purchase was not an issue.

The extras that are on the set are very nice. It's what isn't there that left me, against my will, disappointed.

I'll start with the extras that are actually present.

""The Fall""- 13:57 This was a nice segment on the fall of Sherlock Holmes and the different theories with an extensive interview with Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat interspersed with fan reaction and bits from the lead cast as well as the filming process. I had seen clips of these interviews on the internet before, but this is the whole thing. Interesting, but not really anything new.

""Fans, Villains & Speculation""- 16:33 I liked this bit the best, actually. This was a compilation of Gatiss, Moffat, Cumberbatch, Freeman, Abbington, Vertue, and many other SFX and other production people interviews. It didn't focus on one thing, but instead addressed a bit of everything about the series. From Moffat and Gatiss talking about how this series was ""fanfiction"" of the original Holmes stories to Amanda Abbington talking about her take of Mary.

""Shooting Sherlock""- 14:04 This was more about the ""shooting"" of the scene where *SPOILER* Sherlock gets shot. There was quite a bit of clever filmography that went on as well as brief interviews with the actors involved in the scene. Fun to watch, but nothing mind blowing.

What was missing:

""Commentaries on the episodes""- I know that this DVD was released under a month after the U.S. premier, and about that same amount of time for the U.K. box set (it was released in late January), which I think was the problem. There simply was a huge demand for the DVDs and no time to do commentaries. My favorite commentaries are when the actors themselves get to weigh in, but the writers or the directors are fun to listen to as well. But there were none, which disappointed me greatly.

""Deleted or missing scenes""- I am aware that neither of the prior series had these on their DVD extras, but with all these interviews coming out with the actors themselves mentioning scenes that were deleted (can I point out the ""gay strip club"" scene that was deleted from episode two during the drunk reel) I was hoping for something. However, I think the fact that the DVDs were released so soon after the premier is to blame as well. I, for one, would have waited two more months for a few of these gems to be added before I got the DVDs.

""Gag reel""- Again, I am aware that neither of the prior series had gag reels, but I was really hoping against hope that the creators of the DVDs would add them, especially after the two year wait we endured to see series three. From interviews, there have been mentions of takes that were hilarious and went so wrong, but I suppose the public will never witness them.

I am very happy to have this series on a DVD boxset, but I wish the making of the boxset itself wasn't so rushed.",1392076800,12,3339,4.601010101010101
5850811,5,B00DRDBTT8,I love this series. Each season is more incredible than the last! My only wish is that there were more! A must watch!,1392076800,,117,4.130434782608695
5850812,5,B00DRDBTT8,I have watched the first three episodes and they are movies basically. Each one with it's own twists and turns. if you want to be challenged watch the show,1392076800,,155,4.379310344827586
5850813,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Great show, incredible cinematography and acting. Story is thick and riveting.  def worth the money to buy!!! get one it",1392076800,,120,5.0
5850814,4,B00DRDBTT8,It's a great show and very entertaining. I really like how they mixed in action and humor into the show.,1392076800,,104,4.25
5850815,2,B00DRDBTT8,"I really loved the initial Sherlock series but now I find that Sherlock (despite the great quirky acting of Cumberbatch) is headed in the wrong direction. As a longtime fan of Conan Doyle's written works and the many screen adaptations I really enjoy almost all related material. Sherlock season 3 includes too many insane deviations (and flashed false scenarios) from the original plots. The series is becoming very confusing and hard to grasp or see any cohesive plot lines.
I also find the increasingly frequent and overwhelming presence of Mycroft's character extremely annoying. Seems like an obvious self-insertion of an egotistic Co-Director's personal whims and scenes into the series despite an apparent lack of acting talent. The personality of Mycroft is overwhelmingly snobbish and pretentious- very typical British aristocracy I suppose- but it does not fit well into in the series and distracts/clashes strongly with the basic plots.",1392076800,11,947,5.405405405405405
5850816,4,B00DRDBTT8,"Interesting season...but maybe too much emphasis on Sherlock's idiosyncrasies and not enough case solving. The third episode was the best, in my opinion.",1392076800,4,153,5.695652173913044
5850817,5,B00DRDBTT8,This is the best season so far.  The character development really goes deep between Mr. Holmes and Mr. Watson.  The stories are so deeply involved that you will find yourself watching each episode over and over again to catch the clues.  By and afar Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman make the best Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson ever created.,1392076800,2,343,4.779661016949152
5850818,5,B00DRDBTT8,Good streaming on this video.  The characters are developing and the cinematography is interesting. We look forward to the next installment.,1392076800,,140,5.666666666666667
5850819,4,B00DRDBTT8,"Inventive.  Not the usual Sherlock.  Much more involvement from his brother, and Sherlock is not always the ""winner"" here.  But the presentation has you guessing, and the stories grow out of the written stories, so this is a fun series.  Love the other characters",1391990400,,263,4.909090909090909
5850820,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This is a new fresh spin on the classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle series Sherlock Holmes.  You should watch from Series One.  Although there are only 3 episodes per series so far, they are fabulous!!  I hope we don't have to wait too long for the next series.",1391990400,,256,4.291666666666667
5850821,5,B00DRDBTT8,"The writers have taken some big risks this season, and most of them paid off. The Sherlock-John relationship is the heart of the show, ""a show about a detective,'' rather than a ""detective show,"" as the writers put it, and there's plenty of relationship stuff here to chew on. Mary is a great addition, and the episodes are very funny in many places. Clever, heartbreaking, charming, chilling.",1391990400,,393,4.880597014925373
5850822,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Watched it on PBS, bought it on Amazon Prime, and ordered it on DVD- another addictive season of the modernized Sherlock Holmes. Season 3 as usual needs to be watched multiple times to fully enjoy the details, dialogue and plot twists- some of which required a little more suspension of disbelief than usual ( "" Off switch ?"" Please!) However, after watching Steven Moffat's amazingly written Episode 3 'The Last Vow' I'm still reeling from some of the plot twists that I definitely didn't see coming and can't stop thinking about. If you haven't seen this series- you must watch. I'm just afraid we may not be able to stand the wait to next season. Give yourself the pleasure of watching- there are definitely worse things to be addicted to. Enjoy.",1391990400,,749,4.7251908396946565

5850829,5,B00DRDBTT8,Great episodes and characters.  Only three episodes (each movie length).  Leaves you wanting more.  Two long between seasons.  The fact they you will feel like that is a good thing.,1391990400,,181,4.933333333333334
5850830,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I don't know how they're going to top this season, but I'm sure they will.  Simply amazing stories, acting, and locations.  The second episode of the season - John Watson's wedding - embodies everything this series can do: I laughed, cried, and was astounded in equal turns.",1391990400,,274,4.808510638297872
5850831,5,B00DRDBTT8,I actually thought that this first episode of season 3 was an improvement.  It was far more clever and lighthearted and didn't take itself as seriously as seasons past.  Very entertaining.,1391990400,,188,5.032258064516129

5850833,5,B00DRDBTT8,This a thoroughly entertaining show. Lots if twists and turns in the plot. Can't wait for the next season. Realistic Sherlock.,1391990400,,126,5.0476190476190474
5850834,5,B00DRDBTT8,It just gets better and better.. Cumberbatch and Freeman pair up seamlessly... effortlessly.  At this point you are quite familiar with ... ie attached to all the characters.  always a twist. always funny. always suspenseful... What more could you want?,1391990400,,253,5.3
5850835,5,B00DRDBTT8,"recently stumbled upon  this series and fell in love!  it has become a family favorite.  I have been a fan of Martin Freeman for some time (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and Love Actually)  He is such a lovable character.  Benedict Cumberbatch is a new favorite of mine!!
My husband had me find all of the old seasons so we could watch it from the beginning and to be honest, we don't watch a lot of tv ( he has a very demanding job, and I would rather be playing w/ the dogs or our daughter or working out.  So to get us to sit and watch an entire series is quite an accomplishment!! to get us to sit and watch it over a weekend!!!?? gotta be good.)

5850838,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Brilliant!  BBC has always brought some amazing television to her American cousins, but this outshines it all.  The well written, smart story line is matched  by the brilliant acting of both Cumberbatch and Freeman.",1391990400,,215,5.264705882352941
5850839,4,B00DRDBTT8,"The season was too short, but I loved it!! The script is well written, the acting is fantastic, the characters are familiar with the original story, but have a believable and modern energy to them. Wish there were more to watch!",1391990400,,228,4.585365853658536

I am already a Freeman fan and think that his portrayal of Watson is just the best.  Season 3 was just remarkable. Episode 2 was definitely my favorite, though episode 1 gave me a real good laugh.

Benedict Cumberbatch's performance is stunning, as always, and Martin Freeman and Amanda Abbington are riveting. I came to this series late, thank God for Cumberbatch's appearance in Star Trek Into Darkness, I might never have gotten around to investigating who this guy was playing the most sympathetic Khan I did not think possible. YOU MUST SEE THIS SERIES FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF SEASON 3! LOVED IT!!!...no I don't miss you-know-who, but can't wait to see Amanda Abbington's newly revealed skill sets put to good use!

5850860,5,B00DRDBTT8,"What's not to like here?  Benedict Cumberbatch (Almost as bad a name as Englebert Humperdink - but not quite...) is now my quintessential Sherlock Holmes.  Jeremy Brett still has a special place, But Cumberbatch has created a character that's hard to forget.  Martin Freeman does a fantastic job as Watson - the best Watson I've ever seen.  The supporting cast is outstanding as well - Mark Gatiss as Mycroft is the perfect foil to Sherlock. Rupert Graves as LaStrade is much more likeable than he is usually portrayed - but I like that he's not a complete git.  Una Stubbs as Mrs. Hudson gives her character much more life and interest than just the side-kick housekeeper.  Andrew Scott as Moriarty is(was) the man you love to hate.

Little coherence in terror story with the idea that everything will be explained later serving merely as an excuse for uninspired writing.  A motorback dash?  Another criminal mastermind??

I am, however, quite disappointed in the latest episode, the season finale, ""His Last Vow."" The antagonist does an excellent job of being utterly despicable, and early into the show, I wanted to shoot him in the head myself. But seriously, guys, that's the best you could do? Sherlock comes up with a completely flawed plan, with no consideration for alternate possibilities, no back up, no way to beat this guy, and no way out of a hopeless situation. Was the point supposed to be that he's finally gotten way too sure of himself? And then, exiled on a death mission...oh, no, just joking?! I personally, did not appreciate the introduction of a proteg either. The writers just failed on this one for me.

Something fundamental changed from season 1 and 2 ... need to fire the Director and Writers.  They did not pull their own weight as part of a team and made the actors look bad ... yet actors are very talented.  I watched the third episode until the antagonist urinated in Sherlock's apartment, then I turned off the TV.  Add bad taste to the list of reasons to fire the Director and writers.

The reason I gave it a 1 star versus a 2 or 3 star is simple ... I would never watch it again.  I have watched Season 1 and 2 episodes many times ... all good and entertaining.  Hopefully, season 4 will go back to the quality from Seasons 1 and 2.",1391644800,29,813,4.26797385620915

5850924,5,B00DRDBTT8,"As the third series of Sherlock aired I heard a lot of mixed reviews. A lot of people didn't care for how the show was more personal and character driven, as opposed to the last two series which focused on the cases.

After finally watching all three episodes (and also some fantastic extra featurettes) I can safely say this was a fantastic season of Sherlock. I think the move to character driven stories makes perfect sense. Sherlock faked his own death, and as such John Watson learned to move on and found love.

When you have episodes that deal with death (or not!) and marriage, obviously some character development is necessary to move the plot forward, and Sherlock did this perfectly in my opinion. There were still plenty of mysteries and cases to solve, but I was thrilled with the way Sherlock realized how his faked death affected his best friend. Additionally I loved watching Sherlock and Mr. and Mrs. Watson come to terms with their relationship and how it would work out together. After seven episodes you finally see how important John is to Sherlock.

After the two character focused episodes in The Empty Hearse and The Sign of Three we were given an outstanding episode and villian in His Last Vow. Charles Magnusen was an incredible villian. I won't spoil the ending for anyone but I'll say that I'm definitely excited where it leaves off for series 4!

There's an east wind coming...",1391644800,2,1407,4.7306122448979595
5850925,5,B00DRDBTT8,"When it comes to British television, we Americans love two programs primarily: Doctor Who and Sherlock.  Both are currently written by a man whom we equally love and loathe (Steven Moffat), and for both shows we must wait an inordinate amount of time for new episodes (a time which hasn't been paying off so well lately in the Who department).  It hasn't even been a full week yet since we finished the third series of Sherlock, and we already miss it.  Though, if the rumors are to be believed, were going to continue missing it for quite some time, as Moffat has hinted that the release date for series four may not occur until 2016.  Ugh.

But, thankfully, theres always Netflix, re-runs, and our DVRs to tide us over.  Granted, by 2016, you could probably re-watch Sherlock to the point where you could recite verbatim the lines from every episode, but at least theres the option to re-watch it, unlike back in the day where once you missed it or watched it, it was gone.  Now, you Cumberbitches and Freeman...fans(?) can analyze to the death for the next year (or more) the morsels you were given this month, which is pretty fulfilling in theory but is, in fact, crumbs when you have to wait as long as we do for more.

In any event, here are some of our favorite moments from series three to obsess over while we oh-so-patiently (but not really, because what choice were we given?) wait.

That Kiss

Okay, so when Sherlock initially busts through the window and kisses Molly Hooper in the first episode, you're not sure what to feel.  At first, you're psyched, because admit it - that scene was pretty damn sexy.  Then, you're happy for Molly, because you can a) put yourself in her position and therefore b) understand how happy she must be in that moment.  But then you find yourself getting upset because wait a minute, Sherlock never expressed a desire for a female companion in the books, and he certainly never kissed one (and if he should be kissing anyone, it should be Irene Adler), so what the hell Moffat, are you taking your poetic license a little too far again?  But no, thankfully, this was all just a fantasy concocted by the fans (one of Moffats many in-jokes), and one we can appreciate better later on upon further inspection.

When Sherlock Reveals Himself to Watson

Imagine your best friend has been gone for a couple of years, faked you out by pretending he or she was dead, then showed up at the restaurant you and your soon-to-be-betrothed were dining at, interrupting you in the middle of your proposal.  Youd be pretty happy/pissed off/relieved, too.  Martin Freeman is a master of conveying a multitude of emotions via facial expression.  So too is Benedict Cumberbatch a master of pretending to lack emotion while simultaneously lacking the ability to understand it in others.  Hes Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory if Sheldon were forced out of a sitcom and into real life - and in Britain.  And Freeman reminds us of Bernard, the mouse, from The Rescuers: Down Under as hes about to propose to his girlfriend, Bianca.  Its just as easy to rattle his feathers.

The Style

One of the best things about Sherlock is its style.  Like the morphine drip meter scrolling up, and then down, on Sherlocks arm, or the messages that scroll across the screen when someone gets an incoming text, or the several words that are thrown at us at once when Sherlock is doing his deducing, like the words in the foreground of a screensaver.  One of the things we miss about the show when its gone, and one of the things that is brilliant enough to forgive even Moffat for, is its sheer originality in showing, not telling (but still telling).

Mycroft

Wasnt Mark Gatiss simply mesmerizing this season as Mycroft?  Sure, hes been enjoyable in the past, but his character really got a chance to shine this season, and we saw how startlingly evil he could be (like the Just look frightened and scuttle speech), and how not-quite-good-not-quite-bad he could be in sending his brother off to what could be assumed to be a suicide mission as penance for murdering Magnusson, only to bring him back four minutes later to contend with...

...The Return of Moriarty

Okay, so we don't yet know how the hell this one is going to work, and frankly, we don't care.  Were just excited that Andrew Scott is possibly back to reprise his role as Sherlocks ultimate nemesis.  Granted, we watched him blow his own brains out, but weve seen Moffat pull his way out of a painted corner several times on Who and enough times on Sherlock to consider it a viable possibility.  Maybe we weren't seeing the whole picture.  Maybe it was a fantasy concocted by a drug-addled Holmes.  Maybe it was fake blood.  Or a fake gun.  Or who knows what.  Heck, we still probably don't even really know how Sherlock escaped from that roof alive.  Do you believe the story he told Anderson?  I certainly dont.",1391644800,2,4889,4.625290023201856

5850929,4,B00DRDBTT8,"I started watching Sherlock last year and absolutely loved the first two seasons. I read all of Doyle's original books and was impressed that the writers did such a good job of sticking with the plot while managing to give it a modern twist. I felt that the third season shifted away from the original plot, however. For most viewers, that won't make a difference, but for those of us who were originally book fans, it's just a bit disappointing. Still, all things considered, this is an incredibly well-written, engaging, and exciting show....and hey, at least it isn't Elementary.",1391644800,2,582,4.888888888888889

5850933,3,B00DRDBTT8,"I""m two episodes in to Season 3 of Sherlock and disappointed but hopeful.  There were episodes of Breaking Bad I didn't care much for.  They were slowdowns in the action and plot, they could have been removed entirely and not affected anything story wise (Walt obsessing over the fly comes to mind.)  However, they developed the characters and were important for the overall feel of the show and understanding of the characters.

I say all that to say that I feel the same way about these episodes.  Were they a few episodes out of a 24 episode season it wouldn't be so bad.  However, as an ENTIRE SEASON taking a timeout from Sherlockian greatness it is a painful sidestep away from what makes Sherlock awesome.  I hope that, should we get to experience further seasons of Sherlock, that they leave these experiments behind and get back to focusing on the main two characters and their adventures together.  If Sherlock hits 8-10 seasons (24-30 episodes) then it will be wonderful that these episodes are part of that overall arc (see Breaking Bad analogy above) of character growth and development.  But, I want to get back to the meat and away from this fluff.  If all we get is another season or two then I feel like this was wasted time and this was the beginning of the end.",1391644800,3,1280,4.599118942731278

5850940,5,B00DRDBTT8,"It's pretty redundant to write about how terrific Sherlock is.  Thank God for the BBC, which is providing some pretty great programming these days.

Benedict Cumberbatch is quickly becoming a household name in America, with good reason.  This young actor has an amazing ability to convey emotions with some of the most deadpan expressions I've ever seen.  His Sherlock is perfection.  Tall and lithe, gorgeous, snide, snobbish and superior.  Martin Freeman, whose everyman style is also just right for the part, gives Dr. Watson the touch of humanity and kindness needed to play opposite Cumberbatch's Sherlock.

The first episode of Season Thee deals with the death of Sherlock in Season Two.  Two years have past, and Dr. Watson has finally moved on, his grief subsiding enough to have found love with a kind and sympathetic partner, Mary.  The two are dining out, and Watson is just about to pop the question and ask Mary to marry him, when, like the ghost of Christmas past, Sherlock appears, hovering over him disguised as a waiter at the restaurant the couple are dining in.  Watson is properly gobsmacked, angry, relieved, outraged, thrilled.  The two find themselves quickly embroiled in a new mystery involving the potential bombing of Buckingham Palace. The typical fun ensues, and so fun is it to watch these two that it almost hurts.  Where is this programming in America (although The Following and The Blacklist are pretty darn close).

I can't recommend the purchase of this episode more highly.  I actually bought the whole season after I'd already paid for this episode and I'd do it again.  Unfortunately I have very little self control and binge watched the whole thing as soon as I bought the Season (same thing with Downton Abbey and Orange is the New Black...I need to get some help).  If you haven't experienced Sherlock, then go back to Season One and start from the beginning.  It's worth it, I promise.  If you are trying to decide on the purchase of this episode, all I can say is buy it.  Trust me....just go ahead and buy it.  I envy you because you get to experience Sherlock, and I've watched the whole Season already.  Sit back, grab some popcorn and prepare to be properly wowed by Sherlock.

5850941,1,B00DRDBTT8,"Why is it that so many series whose popularity was built on good plots devolve into shows centered on the emotions, quirks, secrets and even the clothing of their central characters? They morph into People magazines for viewers hooked on fictional TV characters.

What type of audience were the writers imagining when they decided that Sherlock's owning several identical coats or the number of his Facebook friends would be matters of interest? Or that Holmes' troubles as a best man should eclipse his prowess as a crime-solver for an entire episode? It's as if they were trying to attract a new audience rather than keep the one they'd already earned.

This series went from a tight ""must-see"" detective mystery to a muddled chronicle of two bent people running around London, examining their feelings and exhibiting their flaws. It's now a ""record-it-maybe-watch-it-later"" thing.

Sad to see a really good show go off the rails. And it's a disservice to viewers who assume a Masterpiece Mystery presentation should at least try to live up to the name.",1391558400,39,1055,5.017142857142857

5850945,2,B00DRDBTT8,"I loved season's one and two.  Loved, Loved, Loved.  Then comes season three.  What happened to the writing Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat???

In seasons one and two each episode was like a mini movie.  Great, well developed plots, but each was still tied together with Moriarty.

Then comes season three.  In the first first episode of season three so much of the episode is devoted to how Sherlock could have come back from the dead.  Okay, I will give the writers that much, I knew it would take up a lot of the story to try to explain what happened, where Sherlock has been and how is going to reunite with Dr. Watson.  The second episode is devoted to Watson's wedding.  The stag night is kind of funny, but the story about Watson's old Army pal/officer being stabbed is really pathetic and not well written.  The third episode was supposed to be about Sherlock's greatest enemy, a man who can read anyone's weaknesses.  Most of the episode is devoted to John's wife Mary.  She used to be a trained killer?  Okay?  I didn't like that at all!  In the end, Sherlock kills his greatest enemy, who's name I cannot even remember, to protect John's wife.  The best part of season three the last minute when Moriarty asks if we missed him.  Of course we did!

I read today that Steven Moffat said we may have to wait 5 years to see that next Sherlock.  Guess what Steven?  We won't be waiting!",1391558400,23,1390,4.436507936507937

But in either case, this season was brilliantly made, it was different where it needed to be and still held the Sherlock charm I came to love.

A bit disappointing in the handling of the ""Big Baddie"" for the season, didn't write him in all that much.  I think it could have been a lot more intense / interesting.  Seemed like they sort of wasted the character.

5850969,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I am not a Sherlockian, but I have read and re-read the original stories and listened to audiobook versions and also read a biography of ACD, so I am a fan. I like Benedict better than any of the other Sherlocks, including the guy on Elementary and Downey Jr. I like MOST of the new Sherlocks episodes, and I liked MOST of the wedding episode ( spoiler alert: although I am supposed to believe that two men are stabbed with thin blades in the back and don't realize it!!!! ) This one fact spoils the entire episode for me. Now, on to the finale, about the blackmailer Gustafson. I remember the original story fondly. And I don't mind that the plot is changed. Arthur Conan Doyle was not perfect, and his stories sometimes were just stupid. But they are creative, and well written. What I don't like and don't see any need to do is to take bits and pieces of the original stories and hodge-podge them together as a sort of homage pie. I was reading ""The Man With The Twisted Lip ""when I watched the Sherlock finale. So I knew that the crack house scene is taken from that opium den scene; with the twist that Watson went there to vent his pent up anger ( not at all the Watson that I prefer ). I was content with Watson being passive and sensitive and married to a real normal nice woman. I should have noticed that when Sherlock had a girlfriend ( spoiler alert: she is not really his girlfriend, he is using her to get into Gustafson's house ) I should have remembered that the idea comes directly from ACD's original story, but I was enjoying the scene too much. After all this build-up and a nice creepy character villain, I was hoping for a bit of the old detective work, some meaty mystery for Sherlock to solve. NO SUCH LUCK !!! The finale episode goes right off the deep end into ridiculousness and spoils everything for me. ( Spoiler alert again: Mary, who I was very happy with, suddenly has a dark past as an assassin, of all the stupid things; and then she shoots Sherlock for no good reason, honestly... no good reason. You can try to twist the plot around all you want, but she shoots him for no good reason ) After this bad decision on the writer's parts, the episode falls apart. We have to watch a very long description of Sherlock figuring out how not to die. And then even though he is shot in the chest, near his heart, he is out and about pretty quickly, wincing whenever he moves. This is the cheapest of plot devices and has ruined many a great character ( like Prendergast, by Preston and Child, who was never interesting after getting shot in the chest ) . I was still hoping that even a damaged Sherlock would now get on with sleuthing, but NO. ( Spoiler alert again: Sherlock shoots Gustafson, who everyone wanted dead; and then Sherlock is sent away as punishment... SO MELODRAMATIC!!!!! ). It just does not make sense, and now Mary is not interesting. Anyway, the ending is even worse. Moriarty is not even dead. I guess nobody dies in this Sherlock universe.

I watched series 1 and 2 in two days. Both do wonderfully to build and enrich the setting and character relationships while still managing to gift compelling plots and subplots in rich layers of blackmail, intrigue, the nature of evil, and completely credible psychological continuity for each character.

I sympathize with fellow reviewers who have been disappointed to see a Sherlock that is less than heroic; less ""in control.""  However, his behavior in Season 3 just goes to show how important John Watson is to the stability and grounding of an almost out of control force that is Sherlock Holmes.  There are moments in ""His Last Vow"" that are simply heartbreaking to watch. The plot is completely unpredictable and left me on the edge of my seat.  Despite many harrowing moments, what carries the day is that these two friends clearly understand and trust each other despite their suffering.  This goes beyond a simple ""bromance.""  This relationship is epic and makes this version of Sherlock Holmes the most compelling I've seen.

Both Seasons 1 and 2 were ""5 stars"" in my opinion.  Season 3 is far less interesting, strays beyond the limits of updating the original stories and so drastically changes the Holmes-Watson relationship it is painful. Season 3 was difficult to watch due to the constant flashbacks, poor flow of each episode, and lack of a mutual comaraderie that had previously existed between Holmes and Watson.",1391385600,13,665,4.8584070796460175
5850975,2,B00DRDBTT8,"To say that Series 3 of ""Sherlock"" is not up to the standard of the previous seasons understates the fact and misses the point. The writers weren't even trying to write mysteries or, it seems, plots at all. And they certainly weren't trying to write characters. The episodes are ""The Empty Hearse"", ""The Sign of Three"", and ""The Last Vow"". The first two involve mysteries but no detective work. The third is not a mystery. Two years after Sherlock's (Benedict Cumberbatch) supposed death, Dr. Watson (Martin Freeman) has moved out of 221B Baker Street and gone back to practicing medicine. He has plans to marry his girlfriend Mary Morstan (Amanda Abbington). Mycroft Holmes (Mark Gatiss) is still the UK's puppetmaster. Mrs. Hudson is still entrenched (Una Stubbs). Molly Hooper (Louise Brealey), the pathologist, has moved on to another man. Then Sherlock reappears.

""The Empty Hearse"" takes the easy way out with Sherlock exonerated of all wrongdoing in his absence. The writers like to toy with those who want to know how Sherlock staged his demise, and that provides the filler needed to plump this episode out to 90 minutes. All three episodes contain enormous quantities of filler. It's no wonder, as they do not actually contain plots. The writers did not attempt to base these episodes on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books or stories, except for some inspiration ""His Last Vow"" takes from ""The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton"". That's unfortunate, because the writers badly needed the discipline that adapting a story would have provided. Instead we have stories -if you can call them that- that take a painful amount of time to start, don't involve detection, and are all theatrics and no substance.

Sherlock is not so much a character anymore as a hyperactive performing seal. Benedict Cumberbatch is doing Sherlock schtick these days, which involves making a lot of faces, while Sherlock travels to his ""mind palace"" -a lot of quick cutting there- which is beyond tedious. The ""mind palace"" is also frequently employed as filler. Sherlock veers between being mawkishly sentimental and casually and deliberately cruel. He plays with people's emotions where he used to ignore them. He has developed a sharp social insight, so he has no excuse for ignoring others' feelings now. His newfound concern for what everyone thinks of him, and tendency to express undying devotion to them, will induce nausea. Sherlock has been reduced to a collection of bizarre mannerisms. His behavior is characterized by sentimentality and changeability.

The banter between Sherlock and brother Mycroft and between Sherlock and Dr. Watson, which has always been entertaining, is now boring. Another genre of filler. Perhaps having one entire episode -""The Sign of Three""- revolve around a Best Man's speech is not a horrible idea, if Sherlock can cleverly solve a mystery while he's droning on. He does that, for maybe 5 minutes. But the episode revolves around the speech, not the mystery, and it may be the longest speech in the history of wedding receptions. This stuff is literally difficult to sit through. ""His Last Vow"" is a lame excuse for a thriller, but it is not a mystery. The villainous blackmailer, called the most dangerous man in the world, has been praised to the heavens by the British press. But he barely has more than a walk-on presence and is utterly bland. There's nothing to him.

Series 3 is about emotions, and Sherlock has the most of all. But we liked him because he didn't have the same emotions as other people, and because he couldn't understand those feelings. These three episodes were written by three different people: Mark Gatiss,  Stephen Moffat, and Stephen Thompson, who seems to have collaborated with the others on ""The Sign of Three"". It's a conspiracy. Moffat did the same thing to ""Doctor Who"". He wrote the reboot of that series in 2005, which was not really science fiction so much as an unbearably sappy soap opera. Same problem here. ""Sherlock"" Series 3 is not a detective show; it is a soap opera, and a lousy one. Tip: If you didn't see it on the BBC, be sure to look up the 7-minute short film ""Many Happy Returns"" on YouTube before watching Series 3. It takes place in the interim between Series 2 and 3.

The episodes are:

""The Empty Hearse"" opens as Sherlock Holmes has been cleared of all wrongdoing and reinstated as a hero in his absence. Brother Mycroft insists that Sherlock return to London to prevent an imminent terror attack. A British intelligence agent died to get information about an ""underground terror network"" in London, but no one has been able to uncover it. Amidst a string of unchallenging new cases, a former client finds an intriguing mystery for Sherlock: A man boarded the last subway car leaving the station one night...and disappeared before reaching the next station. Watson, meanwhile, did not take the news of Sherlock's resurrection well, and he's having a rough time back on the job. We are kept guessing as to how Sherlock's suicide was staged. The title of the episode refers to a club of conspiracy theorists who believed him to be alive.

""The Sign of Three"" brings us to Watson's wedding day and Sherlock's greatest challenge: the Best Man's speech. Sherlock is secretly worried that he is losing a friend and partner, while Watson's fianc&eacute;e Mary (Amanda Abbington) has been trying her best to make both men feel secure and needed, even enlisting Sherlock as a wedding planner, a task to which he has dedicated himself obsessively. On the wedding day, the maid of honor Janine (Yasmine Akram) is pleased to have the advantage of Sherlock's powers of observation in sorting through the guests for eligible bachelors. A very long time is spent on Sherlock's speech, which naturally involves solving a mystery and flashbacks to a couple of old cases that turn out to be related. Unfortunately Sherlock is mawkish, out of character, and Mycroft is an annoying distraction in this episode for no reason.

""His Last Vow"" begins as Lady Elizabeth Smallwood (Lindsay Duncan) is blackmailed by media mogul Charles Augustus Magnussen (Lars Mikkelsen), a man whose vast store of embarrassing materials puts him in a position to manipulate every person of power in the Western world. Not content to cave in, Lady Smallwood hires Sherlock Holmes to retrieve the problematic documents. Meanwhile, as John and Mary Watson are getting used to married life, a distraught neighbor asks for help in retrieving her missing son from a crackhouse. While there, Watson stumbles upon Sherlock, apparently in a drugged stupor. Sherlock insists that he was working on a case, and, when Mycroft realizes that Sherlock intends to take on Magnussen, he forbids his brother to do it.

5850979,4,B00DRDBTT8,"My first impression is horrific disappointment that my much looked forward to Sherlock Season 3 has spent so much time on romance. The two main actors of course gave interviews stating the vaunted friendship is based on platonic love. Why that is important is that the reason many viewers so love the series created by Gatiss and Co. is that the relationship between the characters of Sherlock and Watson has a spark of that indefinable chemistry that can't ever be taken for granted. It is a gift when found, and troubling when squandered. And some fear it might be physical in nature. Silly, huh?

There are many lovely moments, and many annoying ones. The irritation I felt at the romance that dominated the episodes while it weakened the cases isn't dimmed on a second viewing. Making Mary an Assassin is not a plus. Nor is making her a pregnant wife with the possibility in the future that there will be murderous people after Mary because of her past, the kind of people that would not be hesitant if it came to killing her children if they were in the way of getting to her.

And yet, Freeman and Cumberbatch together remain scene stealers of such greatness I forget quite often that I am convinced of season three's position as my least favorite offering of Sherlock. The best man speech is brilliant.

So. Then there is an oddly offensive moment where a joke played by Sherlock on John is over a ticking bomb. Is it Sherlock's attempt to punish John? Make him admit that for a moment Sherlock is the most important person in his life still? Who knows. The joke doesn't show any caring at all, it is rather vicious. And they supposedly love each other, (platonically of course)? Oh, yes, and the last case, Sherlock apparently gives up his life, ending up on a plane to face the East Wind, all for Mary and John's love.

I am never a fan of romance muddling a wondrous show. Sherlock was my absolutely favorite show for the first 2 seasons. Now it is still good yet closer to an average good instead of stunningly incredible to watch. I do have to mention Molly stands out several times, most especially as a temporary John replacement at Sherlock's side. Great to watch her.

I did have moments that I had to giggle, and hence the 4 stars, though I'd have preferred 3.5 stars. The version of Sherlock's suicide that had Moriarity and Sherlock sitting atop Barts and about to kiss.... Entirely implausible, but I'd have enjoyed that more than the way they chose to follow.... Season 3 being the season of Mary. Making the vaunted partnership of Sherlock and Watson more Sherlock, Watson and Watson(Mary). Putting the chemistry of Freeman and Cumberbatch on the back burner for much of the episodes.

The news magnate as the bad guy is weak. I was actually relieved to see Moriarity in the end, and given how delighted I was when he took himself out of the game....

Do I advise people to not watch? Of course not. The scene with Mycroft and Sherlock playing Operation is hysterical. The moving of John's chair... nostalgic and almost sweet. The actors who portray the three main stars, Mycroft, Watson and Sherlock are still so watchable. No, I am not including Mary. I find her intrusive. Yes, Mrs. Hudson is still so much fun. And Molly. Took me forever to recognize Anderson. Not enough Lestrade.

5850985,1,B00DRDBTT8,"I have been a faithful fan of this series since its beginning, but I'm ready to abandon ship.
The first episode, The Empty Hearse, was endearing and very much what a Sherlock fan would want for a Watson/Sherlock reunion (action, emotion, humor).  I was pleased and surprised as I always have been with this series, in spite of some very chaotic editing (flash forward, flash backward, maybe even a flash sideways in there).
The second episode, The Sign of Three, started to rub me the wrong way but I dealt with it, and it has grown on me.  There seemed to be some serious lull time and way too much emotional growth on Sherlock's part.  We like Sherlock loving Watson, but a general need for companionship is just too much.  Mycroft looked more like Sherlock than Sherlock did in some parts of this series. SPOILER ALERT: The real kicker for me was when Mary turned out to be pregnant.  My thoughts are that you just can't have a Watson with kids running around, but I was willing to wait and see how the writers work with this concept.  After all, they have been brilliant up to this point.
The third episode, His Final Vow, the worst episode of this season, killed the show for me completely.  SPOILER ALERT for the reset of this review:
Episode 3 starts out with all the right touches.  We get a snippet of a traditional Holmes story, Sherlock in the opium den/ Sherlock holed up in shack with a bunch of druggies.  The humor was great!  Molly gets a few slaps in.  Then we have the whole Charles Augustus Malverton's maid thing going on with Janine from Mary and John's wedding.  I loved Watson's face in that.  Everything was great.  Mary was great.  Watson was great.  The villain was great.  Everything perfect, right up to the point where Sherlock finds Mary attempting to assassinate Magnussen.  The show lost the devotion of a friend of mine a few minutes later, when we discover that Mary shot Sherlock for his own good.  My reasoning works like this: people started watching Sherlock because they were fans of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, and the writers made a really written transition of this character into the 21st Century.  There was just enough of the old to charm us, and there were just enough surprises to keep us guessing.  Making Watson into a psychologically disturbed man who unconsciously needs to be near dangerous people is just not what Watson is, and it's not what makes us or Holmes love him.  Mary could have been the good wife she seemed to be, or a baddie, but the explanation we are given during this episode just leaves me feeling hollow.

Added to all of this, Sherlock screws up more often in this season than he ever did in any other incarnation that has ever been made of him combined.  We don't expect a perfect Sherlock, but this is just too much.

Furthermore, the goodbye scene at the airport is just empty.  The last goodbye between Watson and Sherlock was just so moving that it felt real and appropriate to these two characters.  Contrast this to the cool ""I'll probably never see you again""/""We're not naming the baby after you""/""Okay"" goodbye that we got.  It doesn't even fit with the characters the writers created, let alone the original set created by Doyle.

To my mind there is simply no way to undo all the wrong that was done in this one episode.  The writers simply throw around too many 21st century labels, a terrible trend I've been watching in British television for some time now.  It was bad enough when our people did it, now we can't even count on British television.

The only way this show has of catching my interest again is start season 4 with the realization that season 3 was just a nightmare someone was having.  It surely was for me.",1391385600,54,3706,4.566666666666666

5850996,4,B00DRDBTT8,"Contains Spoilers: I've seen all 3 episodes in the U.S. and I think the writers spoiled their own character of Sherlock Holmes. In past seasons, they made him who he should be: an introvert, calm, an outcast, and someone who doesn't understand human nature, but right away in this season, Sherlock doesn't fit that description. He's loud, obnoxious, made cruel jokes about not being dead, he seems more emotional, caring, and understanding... yuck. That wasn't the Sherlock we fell in love with! This is an ORDINARY person. Moriarty was right all along, ""...Now I have to go back to playing with the ordinary people, and it turns out you're ordinary just like all of them."" Sherlock may have come back from the dead, but with some weird Monkey's Paw magic trick. The writers left behind the true character of Sherlock. So I didn't beLIEve Sherlock really came back. He was just some shadow of what once was. So one more miracle for me too, Sherlock? Just come back they way you were before... and bring Moriarty with you. Also, if Anderson's theory wasn't accurate (which is what the writers are implying) then where is Moriarty's body? It doesn't seem that Molly took him, nothing was mentioned about his body, it wasn't even used in Sherlock's version of what happened... so where it is? What happened to him? When it's not explained in this first episode I take it as: Andrew Scott created this amazing, ingenious versions of Jim Moriarty, built him up, made him who we all know and love, and then when he's dead, he has no more use, so the writers seem to have throw that part of the story out like an old chicken bone. I don't appreciate that. So, this season was the worse but at least it revealed that my all time favorite villain is back. ""Did you miss me?"" YES I DID SOOOO MUCH. I will definitely purchase season 4! I'll love seeing more from the brilliantly psychotic mind of Moriarty. I hope the writers don't have character mutiny twice. Moriarty is important to me as a very well thought out and brilliant character. I hope he's not all sunshine and lollipops like Sherlock was in this season but it's always hard to screw up the dark side of things... no matter if you're on the side of the angels or not. I hope Sherlock goes back to being who he was in the first season. I'm still debating whether or not to purchase season 3. I would want to see some parts in episode 1, wouldn't want to see episode 2 ever again, but episode 3 is way better because it's more fast paced and I'd watch the ending over and over again obviously. I'll probably buy this after a while when the price goes down just to have the entire series on dvd.

5850999,5,B00DRDBTT8,"What I liked about this series is the insight the first two stories gave to the viewer, about the relationship between Sherlock and John (and in S3E2 - including the relationship of Mary, john's wife,  to them both). Some may want only the fast-paced mystery, without the incidentals, but when the incidentals are needed, by all means, give them, and that, Stephen Moffat and Mark Gatiss did in the first two episodes of Series 3, still finding time for a little mystery along the way.

I feel there is plenty of time for a driving mystery, but when you are re-introducing Sherlock (after his untimely death), and then firmly introducing Mary as the love of John's life, you must take some time to show how this all affects Sherlock's and john's relationship.

Then, in Episode 3, we get down to what everyone wants (A GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED ""SHERLOCK"" MYSTERY) - while, ensuring that the ""picky fans"" (those not wanting ""background"" info to help develop the debt of the characters and move the story along) are not saying snippy things about the new characters, as well as the changes to the older ones. Mary is as much a well-rounded character now, than any others involved with Sherlock. To those picky fans, I say, ""Everything, even the 'background' info is extremely important, later in the series.""

ONE THING MR. MOFFAT AND MR. GATISS MUST CEASE DOING IS - the idea of bringing characters back from the dead. It seems to me that they have done that (storyline) ""to death,"" now.

5851009,3,B00DRDBTT8,"I was so looking forward to finding out how Sherlock survived the end of Season 2.  I have now paid to watch the first 2 episodes of Season 3, and still have no idea.  A few impossible scenarios were presented (one of them intensely amusing) but no plausible explanation.  It's like the writers decided, oops, we painted ourselves into a corner here and there is no way out, so we are just going to laugh about it and move on.

Or, are we ever to know why almost everyone knew Sherlock was alive except John?  The writers seem to think that is hilariously funny but no reason is ever given and come on, not even Sherlock is that clueless, especially as he stood at his own graveside listening to John pleading for him to be alive.

There seems to be much less storytelling going on in Season 3 than in Seasons 1 & 2, it is much more about highlighting (exploiting?) the truly remarkable talents of some amazing actors.

I give it 3 stars, because there are some intriguing and even some hilarious moments, but I am deeply disappointed with the writers for never letting us know who shot J.R., so to speak.  Too much smoke and mirrors, not enough substance.

Then again, perhaps I am the only one who did not read between the lines and figure out how Sherlock survived and why he did not let John know he was alive for 2 years?

Speaking as a fan of the ACD books, season three of Sherlock was a hit and a miss for me. I adored the first two episodes and loathed ""His Last Vow."" Why? If you are a Holmesian purist like me, then the bastardization of the John Watson's character is just horrible. Yes, they got around the Mary Watson is dead problem from the books, but to have morally upstanding Watson married to a killer? Yeah, not buying it. At all.

I have no problem with Moffat and Company playing with the ACD timeline in their quest from A to Z, but in the end I want Sherlock and John retired together and Sherlock tending his bees! *g* Not sure how that will happen given this latest plot twist with John Watson as daddy/husband. Plus, I have no desire for Moriarty to be brought back. He's dead in the books for a purpose, so leave him that way. As usual, Moffat screws up again, first Dr. Who, now Sherlock.

So, loved the first two episodes, third one was a bust for me. We'll see what they do for season four, but losing interest in this version of Sherlock Holmes if it strays too far from book canon.",1391126400,12,1109,4.29665071770335

5851029,5,B00DRDBTT8,It's an incredibly well written show and this season has not disappointed. Bringing Sherlock into the 21st century was executed flawlessly and more shows in the US could learn much from it.,1391126400,,189,4.9375
5851030,5,B00DRDBTT8,"First of all, the complaints by reviewers that they felt misled and bought a ""behind the scenes"" clip verses the true episode really should have read the explanations better. Don't follow their advice, simply look at the Episode explanation, the run time, and the cost. It was great to watch these engaging readings, the filming creators, etc. but it was clear that I was buying a ""documentary clip"" and not an episode.

So on to Season Three. Again, the mystery of this murder in the wedding sequence weaves a powerful tale of Sherlock's skills, but this time it binds it strongly with Watson's medical skills and the bond of friendship that has grown between two men whofor the first timecall themselves friends.

If you forgot the last episode of Season 2, do not watch Episode 1 of Season 3 without going back and watching that episode from Season 2it leads you to Season 3, it builds into Season 3, and explains the depth of friendship.

The creators have done a marvelous job of deviating from the original stories of Sherlock Holmes but using the masterful acting skill of Martin and Benedict, these three Seasons bring a great look into the life of this historical detective, but even more, we see the bond of the two men who have lived with us for decades as Holmes and Watson, but now looking at it through the lens of 21st Century technology and tools. From Season 1 to the latest Episode (Season 3, part 2) we have witnessed the depth of intelligence and the growth of friendshipan artful balance by the writers and directors.

You will love the the whole series and I hope the creators take us into at least 5 seasonsand beyond.",1391040000,,1641,4.628865979381444
5851031,5,B00DRDBTT8,"THE EMPTY HEARSE: Kicking off SHERLOCK's third season is The Empty Hearse; part stage setting, part howdunit, and part good ol'fashioned Sherlock business. When we meet up with our heroes, Sherlock Holmes is deep undercover in Eastern Europe, taking down the web of supercriminal Jim Moriarty. John Watson meanwhile, has grown a depression-stache and gotten himself a girlfriend: Mary Morstan, played with charm and lovable humor by Amanda Abbington. The best thing about The Empty Hearse is that it is probably the most character-centric episode of SHERLOCK yet. Steven Moffat's action-packed, witty script gives SHERLOCK's supporting characters time to shine. Look for a moving moment between Sherlock and Molly Hooper - a relationship that has always been extremely compelling, and a searing meet-up between Holmes and his ex-rival and fanboy, Anderson. And of course, Martin Freeman is nothing short of brilliant, proving once more he can make us laugh and break our hearts. There are a few hitches, though. The plot takes a bit too long to get going, and a bit inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. But on the whole, The Empty Hearse is the Sherlock-formula firing on all cylinders: it's packed with action, hilarious, heart-warming, brilliantly acted, stylish...and you finally get to see how Holmes did it! 8/10

THE SIGN OF THREE: In between the drama and action of HEARSE, and the absolute mayhem of VOW, The Sign of Three is a lovely little episode filled with vibrant color, a fast-paced, fun narrative, and tons of humor. Where the first episode gave Freeman the space to sharpen his chops, THREE is Cumberbatch's time to shine. Sherlock has never been more honest or frank about his strange life, than here. And over a rambling, sprawling narrative, we hear of Holmes and Watson's strangest, most inexplicable cases, and see the human side of the irascible, high-functioning sociopath called Sherlock Holmes. Featuring some fine performances, loads of witty banter, and heapings of that style that sets SHERLOCK apart from the rest of the crowd, THREE is the deep breath before the plunge. If it has a fault, it would be that seeing Sherlock show his human side and make jokes may have seemed a little twee...until that is, we come to the final shot. I will not spoil it for you, but it is perhaps the most haunting, quietly brilliant shot in the entire series. Now THAT is Sherlock Holmes. 9/10

HIS LAST VOW: When the world asked Steven Moffat how he could top the unpredictable, over-the-top insanity of Moriarty...he created Charles Augustus Magnussen. His Last Vow is by far the finest episode in Season 3, and a strong contender for best episode of the entire series. From right out of the gate, His Last Vow tells us it's going to be a new type of story...by introducing us to our villain. Charles Augustus Magnussen, played with icy, loathsome aplomb by Lars Mikkelsen...steals, no - licks and pisses on (literally) - every scene he is in. He is absolutely, deliciously despicable, and if there was a worthier opponent for Sherlock Holmes, he has yet to be found. To describe His Last Vow is to rattle off a string of superlatives. Moffat and Gatiss's writing is on tip-top form, while Benedict Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman, and Gatiss have never been better. The action is the best yet, the highlight being a jaw-dropping sequence where Sherlock must retreat into the deepest recesses of his mind to stay alive. This electrifying sequence had me numb with shock by the end...and we're only half way through. The humor, wit, and requisite Doyle references are all there, as well as some pithy commentary and family drama. And if this wasn't enough, they have to pull the rug out from under us one last time...with a memorable after-credits scene. THIS is the best of the bunch. 10/10",1391040000,3,3812,4.945397815912637
5851032,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Expectation is indeed a flighty creature, and it's natural that people have certain expectations after Sherlock spends two years away from the limelight, while Steven Moffat focuses on major changes to Doctor Who; such as the fiftieth response and the wave goodbye to The Doctor. But people have to realize that times change, and so does Sherlock. While I was never a fan of the books, I can still say that in the books, Sherlock eventually stops becoming such a psychopath and learns to start trusting people more, and something along those lines happens in the new season of Sherlock. So it was natural and bound to happen in the latest Sherlock movie trilogy that he changes. And so does the show, in a few areas.

For one, Sherlock is sharper than ever. He may be less sociopathic, but he can think better as a result. His mind-palace is more accessible to him. He can now draw conclusions quicker- a good example being in ""His Last Vow"", when he gets shot in the chest. Notice how he manages to deduce in three seconds whether he should fall forward or backward? Or in ""The Sign of Three"", when he manages to figure out that the threat from these flunked cases is in the room- and so is the victim, as he delivers his speech. He becomes a much better person, now that he has people on his side. And John Watson is put into good focus too- in fact, his relationships with the people around him is studied in depth, and it's really interesting EPSECIALLY to see how things appear through his eyes.

That's what's always kept me drawn to this show- how it's focused primarily on characters. This is something that Steven Moffat has been known to do in everything he tackles, and here it's heavier on character development, in addition to lending a more human side to the sleuth. That's something that he has been doing with Doctor Who recently- for the better, I must add. And it works for Sherlock too. Sherlock, for ages has been far from the superhero role model that most media forms depict him to be- in the books, he was a suicidal, drug-addicted jerk, and minus the drug addictions, Moffat's incarnation of the sleuth depicts this dark side of him perfectly.

And that may be why season 3 was my favourite season yet. I impatiently kept hitting ""reload"" on the torrent networks every week to get the new episode while it aired in the UK and it didn't disappoint in the least. It is unusually faster paced, but that works better for the show. It's clever, it's taut, it's thrilling, there's new twists every minute. Everything you love about Sherlock is handled differently here, for the better. Moffat, I salute you.

By the way, one last note. If you're watching this on PBS, stop what you're doing, and seek out torrents of the UK BBC One airings- the PBS airings are edited. Do be careful what torrent you download of His Last Vow too- on some files, the after credits scene is replaced with a trailer for The Musketeers.",1391040000,2,2933,4.570342205323194
5851033,3,B00DRDBTT8,"Having watched all of Season 3 (twice), I must agree with other reviewers who are a bit disappointed - the show's creators clearly believe there is no limit to how far afield they can wander and still retain the gestalt that made Conan Doyle's great stories the success that they were. In Season 3, they are reaching that limit: the episodes are overwritten, Sherlock may be turning into someone interesting, but that someone is soon to be Sherlock Holmes in name only, and the quirks that made Cumberbatch's Sherlock so endearing in Seasons 1 and 2 are in danger of becoming shticks. The show's creators are overloading the episodes with too many superfluous tricks of the ""Oh, come on,"" sort.

That said, it is still enjoyable to watch Cumberbatch, who is never less than interesting. But I would urge Gatiss and Moffat to take a step back - to Season 1, Episode 1, if possible, before their successful update goes from a well-executed concept to a circus trick.",1391040000,13,964,4.738095238095238
5851034,3,B00DRDBTT8,"While a great deal of this episode was dealing with Sherlock trying to get John to understand why he didn't contact him after 2 years to let him know that he was in fact alive, it as never really fully dealt with. It felt like an unanswered question and neither John nor the view were satisfied and treated like a child who should just accept it and move on.

Sherlock joking about it over and over just didn't make sense and I think that the episode was really poorly written and I left feeling unsatisfied after watching it. However, as a child, John accepted it and now they are best pals again ready to have more adventures so hopefully the story line will get back to being more true to the characters.",1391040000,18,707,4.356060606060606

5851036,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This updated view of sherlock & Watson tickles my intellect in so many ways.

5851038,3,B00DRDBTT8,"My wife and I own Seasons One and Two of this brilliant show on Blu-ray. We watch all six of those episodes constantly. So we were waiting on pins and needles for Season Three to air and we sat in front of our TV the night it did...

...only to shake our heads when it was over and think, ""What happened?""

The first episode of Season Three lacks the pizzazz and charm of the first two seasons. In fact, it almost appears to be a different show. Here's why:

1. The explanation as to how Sherlock faked his own death was way beyond convoluted, unbelievable, and just plain hokey. It made no logical sense at all. For Sherlock to pull together a massive team to help him -- who all kept totally silent! -- stretches credibility to the breaking point.

2. It was disjointed and choppy, filmed as if by an apoplectic camera operator. The storyline hopped around as often as the camera did. Quick cut, quick cut, quick cut...close up, close up, close up. It was distracting.

3. Two years? TWO YEARS? Nearly every character but poor John Watson knew Sherlock was still alive. TWO FREAKIN' YEARS?!?!? I realize Sherlock is a sociopath. But that's just plain cruel.

4. The writing - by co-creator and actor Mark Gatiss - tried too hard to be clever and, instead, had to settle for frenetic.

Compare Season Three, Episode One with any previous episode. Watch them side by side, back to back -- doesn't matter. Season Three, Episode One is darker, less coherent, more focused on action than on character...

In short, we were so unimpressed by the first episode that we forgot there was a second episode airing the next week. For us, that's akin to blasphemy and punishable by death. That's how big of Sherlock fans we were.

There's something off about Season Three.

Your mileage may vary.

NOTE: I see a phenomenon happening with Sherlock that I do with Downton Abbey - a host of dubious 5-star reviews, all supposedly from Amazon Verified purchasers, all about a sentence or two in length, all not saying much at all other than ""Great Show!"" These short ""reviews"" appear in bursts from time to time. Methinks the game is afoot.

***UPDATE***

My wife and I watched the third episode last night -- and fell asleep about a half hour into it, something we would never have dreamed of with any episode from the first two seasons.

This morning, we talked about it. I think we know what's wrong with Season 3.

What made the first two seasons special was the fact that Holmes and Watson lived together and were often mistaken for a couple, which ticked off Watson to no end. They were very close, and their banter reflected that.

Consequently, the show was about those two.

Now, thanks to Watson's marriage, and Holmes'""girlfriend,"" the show is not just about Holmes and Watson; it's about the lives of two separate people who now only occasionally interact to solve a case.

Which means, a large portion of the magic is gone.

The Sherlock Homes canon is vast - some 56 short stories and four novels - so Moffat and Gatiss did not have to introduce Watson's wife this early in the series, if they did at all.

We think doing so threw off the chemistry and radically altered the interplay, which made the show so special.

Whatever the reason, we went from being two of the world's biggest Sherlock fans to falling sleep watching the show.

One more thing: the camera work in episode three was as choppy and disruptive as it was in episode one. It seems someone behind the scenes (producer? director? writer?) knows the material is weak. So there's been an effort to try to make what's happening on the screen seem more kinetic, rather than static. Doesn't work.

The main idea which they seemed to want to pound into your head for a total of ninety minutes is that Sherlock is socially inept... but Sherlock is a genius. So we get to watch him be terrified at the prospect of being John's best man, get drunk, get emotional,  (aww, isn't that cute, girls?) solve a couple of random crimes which actually turn out to be connected to something REALLY important and then leave everybody to happily enjoy John's and Mary's wedding reception after spilling the beans to Mary that she is pregnant. (Wow. Didn't she even notice she was late?)

I am beyond disappointed. The first episode was not as good as I had hoped it would be, but there was promise in it of newer and more interesting developments for the next episode. There were several threads left off at the end of episode one which could have been picked up and continued for episode two. There was too much focus on the wedding and of Sherlock being emotional in his weird way about it. I waited two stinking years to see this season and so far it is a huge letdown. We still don't even know for sure how Sherlock faked his death. His testimony to Anderson in episode one left us with reason to doubt he was telling the truth. I just hope the last episode lives up to the quality of seasons one and two.",1390867200,22,1401,4.363984674329502
5851075,3,B00DRDBTT8,"Sigh. This will be considered ""heresy"" by the hoi polloi,  considering the press this series has engendered.  But I cannot give the new season of ""Sherlock"" the hightest of marks, much as I had hoped.

The three new episodes are simply (relatively) vacuous. No main plot--no REAL mystery to solve. What has happened--I am afraid--is that Cumberbatch and Freeman (Sherlock and Watson) now have become SUCH popular stars that the writers have forsaken what got them there in the first place and so now are simply Hollywoodizing the two actors (to which neither seems to mind!), like Lady Gaga or Paris Hilton or Kate Middleton.  The first episode was ""trying"" to explain, with lots of smoke and mirrors, how Sherlock survived the Reichenball ""fall""!  Big time sigh. Too easy.  And too much time ""explaining it,"" although, of course, no ""real"" explanation is given. And then we see just how clever Sherlock continues to be--and it's clever for clever's sake. No real plot here.  But I excused it, saying that the audience needed an explanation (but not for 1.5 hours, of course).  Then episode 2--another big sigh. Would that wedding reception NEVER end? Pul-eeze. More smoke and mirrors and no real mystery to solve, just bits and pieces either to tantalize the viewers or the scriptwriters simply had nothing better.  Episode three picks up a bit--and of course I am eager to see what the next season brings.  I love series.  The First Season was A-plus, certainly one of the most exciting episodes I've ever seen (""Study in Pink"" is a classic!). Ditto for the full episodes of the two first seasons.  First time viewers of the series were sure to be confused and turned off, as some have reported to me.

But, please, scriptwriters/producers--get back to a central case and forget about what cute, clever, and camera-ready actors you are featuring. We want great action plots.  And of course we're completely ready for Moriarity to re-surface.",1390867200,32,1943,4.920245398773006

5851081,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This is, hands-down, the single best adaptation of the original books since...well since the original books!
Sherlock seems cold, calculating, and manipulative, but when we get to see more of him he's actually very protective of his friends, and willing to do whatever he can to protect them. Even if his sense of humor and occasional need to feed his hubris can get just a TAD out of hand (Season 3, episode 1. You know what I mean.) Also, Benedict Cumberbatch is now tied with David Tennant as my favorite actor of all time. Ever.
Watson is fantastic as well! He's a bit guarded, and a total womanizer, but I love how even in the later episodes his almost over-emotional and instinct-prone attitudes clash in all the right ways with Sherlock's cold logic, and vise versa sometimes. They ground each other, and are the best of friends. Also, the running joke that everyone thinks Watson is secretly gay for Sherlock is amazingly funny, and they never overplay it! Only true friends are so close that they could be mistaken for a gay couple.
I'd go on for ages about the rest of the cast; How this adaptation of Moriarty is the best villain I've seen in years, just the right mix of insane and genius! How Mycroft slowly starts to question his ""Caring is an evolution disadvantage"" line when he sees his little brother open up to people (if only a little) and watches Sherlock's skills almost seem to grow, or be put to even more efficient use, rather than diminish! The caretaker, Mrs. Hudson, being the sweetest (and funniest) little old lady in the history of humanity! But I think everyone who has Amazon, Netflix, or cable should watch every last episode of this show and make their own opinions shine.
WARNING; There are split opinions on Season 3. I'd say 70% still love it, even if it does change up the style and flavor just a bit, but 30% of the fandom will (of course) swear in front of God and the Universe that it's trash. Watch Season 3 for yourself, and come up with your own opinion.

5851121,3,B00DRDBTT8,"Okay, let me start off by stating that I am a HUGE fan of this new Sherlock series. I love it to pieces. And when series 3 was finally released, I couldn't wait to watch it. I watched each episode when it aired and now that they've all been released, I can finally make a review.

*NOTE, THIS DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS*
All I have to say about Season 3 is that it was a great, great difference from Series 1 and 2, which I loved. There were plenty of funny and heartfelt moments in Series 3 but at the end of it all, I feel like Sherlock became more of a soap opera rather than a detective show. Knowing what I do about the original Sherlock stories, there are things that take place in this season that are not canon to the original stories and that alone made me pretty unhappy. Also, in the three episodes there is hardly any detective work to even speak of. They have released that they've planned a season four and I just hope that it sticks to more detective stories between Watson and Holmes rather than teasing for multiple relationships between characters and such.

I loved Season 3, do not get me wrong. But no where near as much as I love seasons 1 and 2. I miss the tone of the first two seasons. Sherlock alone is very different in this new season, much more emotional and it's not bad, just odd. Out of character for this Sherlock. All in all, I wasn't overly pleased with this season but I did not hate it.

Here's to Series 4. xoxo",1390780800,4,1448,4.2202166064981945
5851122,1,B00DRDBTT8,"This series took a 180 degree turn right off a cliff.  Crashed and burned! Consequently no cliff hangers.  No mysteries either? Huh? Is this Sherlock Holmes or Facebook? How many friends do I have?  A.C Doyles's Sherlock could care less. How about writing an intriguing mystery story guys? Season #3 is a narcissistic mess turning inward and cannibalizing itself.  It is also unfortunately quite unwatchable.  ""Aren't we cute?"" the shows creators seem to be screaming. Season #3 is a one trick pony focusing on the Holmes Watson relationship which goes no where over and over and over. I loved the first two seasons!  But it would have been better not to have made this third season and have Sherlock really die falling off the roof! This isn't the bloody ""Love Boat!""  We don't need a soppy wedding.  If you like silly wedding stories pick up a Hugh Grant film, I think one is available.  I bought the UK version and I'm going to ask for my money back. Talk about killing the goose that laid the golden egg: these folks have done it.  Guys, take a deep breath, watch season #2 again and strive to recapture the magic in season #4 please!",1390780800,48,1138,4.589108910891089
5851123,1,B00DRDBTT8,"Looked forward to the new season but if the first two episodes are any indication I won't be back.  The show just can't keep my interest which is amazing since I have been an all things Sherlock fan my whole life.

A brilliant sociopath would be smart enough to understand his affliction and not go looking to experience everyday feelings.  This plot line (character development) is not funny or hip.  I am reduced to clicking stop before I pass out.",1390780800,18,450,4.5875
5851124,2,B00DRDBTT8,"This is a rambling, uninspired series of improvised, poorly conceived sketches, more of a human interest thing. It doesn't hang together.  I can only guess at what the producers thought they were doing. Maybe they were trying to show the human or humorous side of Sherlock's life with Dr. Watson. Whatever. I don't know. They didn't so much explore a little known side of these characters as distort them, and risked losing all sense of the characters.

In the end, most of it was just boring. It's like they told us an awful lot of things we didn't need to know and didn't want to know about Holmes and Watson.

It is not the kind of tightly constructed, flawlessly paced, well-acted, ingenious and suspenseful detective yarn one expects from Sherlock. Not worth the rental fee. Believe me, if you skip it, you will not be missing a classic, must-see episode of Sherlock Holmes. It started me thinking that this version of the Sherlock Holmes saga might not really work out all that well. I will tune in for the next episode, fingers crossed.

Don't believe the strongly positive reviews. The emperor has no clothes.

I gave it two stars because there were bits of it that were reminiscent of the old Holmes and Watson. And some of the bits did actually work. Also, I think the actors did a darned good job with what they were given to work with.",1390780800,23,1347,4.595833333333333
5851125,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I have seen all of the Season 3 episodes 3 times.  The first two are quite funny.  Holmes is a bit more human after his time away and John perhaps distances himself a little in the first episode.  The first episode can get a little chaotic and the mystery is not a big deal in it, but the whole thing of bringing Sherlock and John back together is worth it.  And I loved Mary!  Then the second episode, revolving around the wedding, Sherlock's best-man speech, and a long unwinding mystery, is touching, hysterically funny at times, and creatively filmed.  But the third episode is my favorite - perhaps my favorite of all the Sherlock episodes.  Moffat follows The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton fairly closely and he also draws on many other stories in Doyle's canon including His Last Bow.  There's some pretty shocking twists, but I felt that Moffat had all of his characters well in hand.  Moffat isn't trying to re-create 19th century characters in the modern world, so Doyles characters don't always act *exactly* like we might expect from ACD's stories.  Moffat instead shows us a version of what these same characters (not just Sherlock and John) could be like if they were products of our world rather than the Victorian world.  His Last Vow ends with several unresolved issues, but they just make you want Series 4 all the more quickly.

Season 3 has some over-arching themes of friendship, forgiveness (a big one), and the nature of caring.  Somewhere I read recently a reviewer commenting that in earlier seasons, the stories revolved around Sherlock with John orbiting him, but this season has Sherlock orbiting John.  I think that works very well as Sherlock and John discover more about just what it means to truly commit to caring for someone.",1390780800,2,1769,4.795379537953796
5851126,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I've seen some people bashing on the third season, saying that it isn't the same show anymore and all that jazz. However, I think they are missing a very important aspect of this show; as writer/creator Mark Gatiss once stated, this show is not a detective show, but a show about a detective. While the cases Sherlock Holmes involves himself with are, indeed, exciting, the primary focus of this show is Sherlock becoming a hero and a good man. This show isn't a cop show. This season is all about the relationship of Sherlock and John Watson, and boy, is it beautifully carried out. By the end of the season, we are left feeling sympathetic for our beloved consulting detective. He definitely isn't the same man we saw in season 1. Oh no. He's become more human while still maintaining his quirks we fell in love with.
So, in short, if you fell in love with this show because of the cases, this season probably won't appeal to you. However, if you fell in love with this show for its brilliant and beautiful characterization, then season 3 will be a treat.",1390780800,3,1057,4.539267015706806

5851130,2,B00DRDBTT8,"I've been a Holmes aficionado since I was a teenager. I've enjoyed the old and the new and have never been stodgy toward modern adaptations whether set in the original period or the modern day.

Cumberbatch is an electrifying Holmes and Freeman is a perfect modern Watson. The first 2 seasons have been extremely entertaining and deserving of the acclaim they have received. But......

Unfortunately, the first 2 episodes of Season 3 have been disappointing. The first 2 seasons had interesting stories with occasional and effective humor inserted in the proper places. This season has been excessive humor with the occasional interesting story  inserted as an after thought. The Empty Hearse was weak but acceptable; the ""The Sign of Three"" was a train wreck, it is borderline farcical, somewhat embarrassing and the most forgettable episode of the entire series. This episode is not at all worthy of the high standards this series has achieved so far. I realize you can't hit a homerun every time you swing, but I just can't understand how this episode escaped the editing room.

I'm hoping the last episode saves the season, but in any event, the first 2 seasons are television at it's finest and worthy of their own acclaim.",1390780800,14,1228,4.946601941747573

I got fooled into purchasing one of Season 3's weird not a ""real episode"" for $1.99. Feel silly about that but finally Season 3 started and I purchased ""The Empty Hearse"" for $1.99. Now when I go to purchase this week's episode ""The Sign of Three"" the purchase price for HD is $6.99 and SD is $4.99. Can anyone say ""price gouging?"" Amazon, I'm so happy that I didn't sign up for the season because this type of price change seems sneaky.

Needless to say, I won't be purchasing any more episodes. The price per episode guarantees that I'll wait for it to become a Prime TV show .",1390780800,4,678,4.296875

While I really like the general direction the the writers are going in making this Sherlock accessible and more vulnerable, they laid it on so thick in this episode.  I'd imagine  ""the reveal"" for many  ""fan""tastical and I'm sure very satisfying for those who have been waiting for him to be humanized. Too much happy and too soon for me.  I would have liked the courtship of John and Mary to go on a bit longer with some doubt as to whether she could deal with Sherlock.  The speech had it's job, and for the first few minutes I enjoyed squirming for everyone, but l enjoy solving the puzzle with John.  I feel brilliant if I can just figure it out before John. Isn't that the point? You can't do that if Sherlock never shuts up and they are not interacting with one another about ""the game"".

5851138,5,B00DRDBTT8,"This season has a different feel to it. The plots are less linear, and not the center of the show. They're a thread woven through the episodes, and it's more about the characters, their lives, and their interaction. A lot of creative camera work and a quick pace characterize the episodes. The writing for the dialogue is quite ingenious. The actors are clearly having a good time with the material. You may miss the more linear plots. However, if you love this incarnation of Sherlock and Watson, and the ancillary characters, you will probably just sit back and enjoy watching their antics. This season is even more innovative and risk-taking for an already original show. 4.5 stars",1390694400,,684,4.854700854700854

5851144,3,B00DRDBTT8,"A few folks talk about new direction, a different director, etc. But to me Season 3 is the middle child of the series. Meaning that it's only purpose is to set up Season 4.

This season does well with character development and progressing the story towards a certain goal. However, that goal is a cliff-hangar and not actually achieved. But I've never been so excited to see the next installment of a show since Breaking Bad. If you were baffled by the ending of Season 2, just wait until you are trying to wrap your head around the twist at the end of this season.

The first episode is pretty great. The second is a filler, and the third feels like a tried-and-true Sherlock. At the end of the day a lot of people are right; it is a different show with a different feel. But if you like this show as much as I think you do, you're going to get it, you're going to watch it, and you're going to make your own opinion despite what everyone says.",1390608000,11,945,4.2444444444444445

I was an avid fan of the first two seasons and remain a fan having watched 3.1; however, I was surprised to see an apparently softer, less sociopathic Sherlock who now concerns himself with others' happiness. This episode contained less mystery and less classically brilliant Holmes, in my opinion, and crept into a bit more of a 'human' character. Interesting, unexpected, yet worth watching.",1390521600,7,508,5.059523809523809

The producers brought in a different director so the lovely artful videography is gone.  The writers bragged that they didn't want to write a detective story, they wanted to write a story about a detective so the Mystery is barely present.  There is humor, but it is the cruel school boy kind that depends on hurting, humiliating, or frightening a friend.  I can't imagine why mystery fans would write such positive reviews:  I suppose that the show may just now be focused on a different audience. Or else the stories about Review Trolls are true and some of the positives are just sales pitches.  At any rate, be warned.

5851153,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I have always been a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes series of stories. I have read them all. We all have our favorite film versions - so many have been made - and if I was to select one that truly represented the stories in the correct time period my vote is for the Jeremy Brett series. I usually don't care for revisionist versions of beloved stories or films.  However, now we are offered a truly spectacular, updated version of Sherlock starring the incredible talents of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman in the lead roles of Holmes and Watson and I am absolutely floored!  They had me on the very first episode of the first season. The blend of talent, script writing, direction, set design and extremely creative film production and editing makes this series one of the absolutely BEST shows on television, bar none.  Creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss (who plays Sherlock's older and smarter brother Mycroft with great flair) are to be congratulated. They are both huge fans of AC Doyle's super sleuth themselves and treat their ""offspring"" with great respect and professionalism.  Well done! I highly recommend watching these with a steaming cup of Earl Grey, a box of really good dark chocolates and a roaring fire!",1390435200,3,1252,4.836448598130841

5851158,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Two years. Two years of obsessing, and patiently (and sometimes not) waiting, and hoping and wondering. That's what this series does to people. Why is Sherlock so spectacular? Why has it dramatically increased its viewership and fan base? Well, simple, it's just plain awesome. Oh yea, and Benedict Cumberbatch. But more on him later...

Once again we get three 1 1/2 hour episodes, which truly feel like mini films, at that length. Each episode is completely different from each other. Tonally, this entire season is different from the past two, but different doesn't necessarily equal bad/better, it's just contrasting.

The Empty Hearse:

Episode one gives us the answer to the excruciating question: How did Sherlock service that fall? We do get that answer, albeit in a strange way. It will not satisfy everyone, for a number of reasons. But, that said, it is probably the most plausible explanation we could expect. We also get the inevitable reunion between Sherlock and John. Poor John, who took nearly two years to grieve over Sherlock, who has moved on with a new woman in his life, and who gets the biggest shock of his life all over again. Everyone in the world has envisioned their reunion, and it does not disappoint. Again, it is so much more different than I anticipated, but still thoroughly entertaining. In fact the entire episode is pretty lively and upbeat. We get more Molly, and even more Mycroft who nearly steals the scenes from Sherlock when he's on. We get a bit of a mystery of course, and we also get a new character: Mary. She is a perfect match for John, and you can tell they are over the moon for each other (shouldn't be hard to fake since they are in actuality a real couple). She is actually very charming and in no way comes between Sherlock and John, and in fact encourages John to see more of Sherlock. She's a great addition to the series and really brings her game when on screen with Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch. Sherlock is still sharp, and cutting, derision dripping from his mouth. But we start to see something crumble behind that mask that's been in place for so long. He comes across as almost generous at times, and patient. And then the next scene has us cringing all over again. It's a wonderful dynamic and Cumberbatch is better than ever.

The Sign of Three:

The big wedding! John is getting married to Mary and of course Sherlock is the best man. To say any more would be to ruin what is easily the funniest episode in the history of Sherlock. Truly, the wit, and utter silliness that this episode produces will merit constant repeats. It also features what is probably the longest Best Man speech in history. It's clever with the interplaying flashbacks and we get an in depth look into how Sherlock's mind actually works. We also get Sherlock and John doing...things. Truly, best not to be spoiled.  While it is John's big day, this episode belongs entirely to Sherlock and once again to Cumberbatch. Here we truly see a magnificent actor at work. He is probably in every single page in the script and has his work cut out for him. And he is. Flawless. Funny, and clever and annoying and surprising. I have to say that while I constantly praise Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman is spot on and perfect as Watson. He contrasts Sherlock so well, that I cannot see another person in his role. He is on his game 100% of the time, and I KNOW this series would not be what it is without him in that role. These two characters really compliment each other and it's this dynamic that keeps people coming back for more. And this episode really showcases that. And there's even a mystery for him to solve at John's wedding. We get a little bit of everything. And then we get a glimpse of melancholy at the end. Which brings us to the third and last part.

His Last Vow:

Where as The Sign of Three was a riotous affair, His Last Vow is the complete opposite. Gloomy from beginning to end, somber and ghastly, depressing and shocking. This is by far the darkest episode we have seen. We encounter Sherlock in a new light. It is a new low for the detective, right from the beginning, and things do not improve in the slightest. We also meet a new villain, Charles Magnussen, played to freakishly perfection by Lars Mikkelsen (Mad's Brother). He is vile, beyond repulsive in every way imaginable, has a dark secret and is the one man Sherlock truly despises. Where Moriarty was psychotic, yet playful, Magnussen is just plain evil. It's chilling to watch him on screen. This episode is full of twists. Dark, surprising, heart-breaking twists. And oh yes, a gorgeous, pulse-racing, brutal twenty minute sequence featuring some of the best acting from Cumberbatch I've seen in all of Sherlock. If people were, for some dull reason disappointed by the first two episodes (and I've read plenty of grumbles) then this should not displease anyone and will certainly more than make up for the jovial and frivolous nature of the earlier episodes. The ending is heart-wrenching and so bittersweet. And then there is another ending. Another 'shocker' if you will. I personally, without spoiling anything, do not think it's going where people are thinking it's going. But, like everyone else, I will just have to wait and see.

I think the main reason why this series works so well, and attracts so many different people, is because of the creators. Steve Moffat and Mark Gatiss(who not only acts but wrote The Empty Hearse). You can tell they know who their audience is, and they actually LISTEN to them. It's refreshing to see that and how involved they are with their fan base. They, 'get it'. And as long as Sherlock is in their capable hands, I will continue to watch and hope that this series continues for years to come.

Edit 1-27-13: I completely forgot to talk about the score! Sherlock season 3 features a fantastic musical score, very reminiscent of season 2, with its dark, dramatic tones, especially in His Last Vow. It really fluctuates from light and airy, the violin once again prevelant and beautiful, to somber and suspenseful. I know it seems like an afterthought to add this, but I really think the music can make or break your viewing experience and the score in Sherlock does not dissapoint.",1390435200,4,6253,4.686703096539162

5851160,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Sherlock is clever, quirky, humorous, dark, and intelligent in sufficient measure that fans (like my wife and I) will put up with a 2-year hiatus and forgive all once the show returns ... or in the case of Season 3, where Sherlock himself, presumed dead, makes his unforgettable return. The interplay between Holmes and Watson as they painfully and hilariously reconnect is just fabulous.

5851165,4,B00DRDBTT8,While definitely not perfect I have to say i adored this new series.  This theme of this series was character development and it delivers in spades.

This show gave us the emotional closure or opening for the characters we love. But I really loved the Molly moments.

When I started watching this show I was so amazed at the skill with which Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat brought my favorite characters back to life.  If I am being completely honest, I would have to say that I am one of those fans that would rate every single episode I've watched so far with five stars.  However, I feel that this first episode of season three was something special. Maybe even out of the ordinary. I feel like the writers/creators took a little bit of what the fans (parched from two years of waiting for its return) wanted/needed to see and created this (pardon the pun) MASTERPIECE of a comeback episode. I will not write much about it because I know that I hate stumbling onto spoilers myself. But if you have always been a Sherlock fan, you will find yourself once again swept away into the mysterious grandeur of Sherlock. If you are a newcomer to our wonderful fandom, I beg you, don't watch this yet!! Start from the first episode.

But the newest episode of Sherlock has made up for it and then some!!  In fact, this episode would go down as my favorite episode in the entire series.  The episode was witty, humorous and surprising.  There were so many hidden nuances that I re-watched the episode twice and found that I enjoyed even more the second time around.

In many ways, it's like catching up with old friends you have not seen in several years.  If you are a fan of Doyle's books or any of the previous incarnation of Sherlock Holmes on TV or movies, you will have a great time watching this BBC series.

5851187,3,B00DRDBTT8,"By this title I mean that the new Season 3 ceased to be Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock, and this has nothing to do with the modernization.  Doyle's Sherlock stayed ""above the fray"" at all times (I believe timeless characters have this bit of nobility about them).  Sherlock's quirky behavior was charming, but the writers fell off the rails with his sightgag playing Operation with Mycroft, when I believe Doyle would have expected him to have kept the nobility of a game like chess.  Moreover, the kissing of the quirky medical assistant didn't bother me, but the suggestion of a kiss with Moriarity after continuing ""the woman"" respect immerses the noble character in a ""swing both ways"" which I think has Doyle rolling in his grave...his Sherlock would never have given in to such expression, even if present society is much more tolerant of this...titalating for a moment, but it brings this character down ultimately...stay classy, writers, and go for the legacy in the memorable Holmes' portrayals...50 years from now that's what folks will want to remember.

I found this out after Season 1, when I bought the DVD's (NOTE: you can get the DVDs earlier from amazon.uk, though you'll need an all-region DVD player to watch them). I realized I was seeing entire scenes that PBS didn't broadcast.  A crucial scene in ""A Study in Pink"", where the murderer reveals his motivation, was cut short on PBS.  So you never know until you watch the DVD why he did the murders.

Whenever they are together, the best and worst of each comes out it seems.

Watching this show is great because you get a bunch of interesting mysteries and an evolving relationship between two very deep individuals.

The acting is excellent.  Freeman and Cumberbatch deftly bring these two characters to life.  Never melodramatic.  Never stiff.  You can relate to each of them.

Another nice thing about this show is that it is a more ""British"" series.  Filming is more toned-down, with darker settings, quaint and pleasing British architecture.  Nothing faked.  Nothing too splashy or showy.  The comedy is intelligent and dry.

I think the show makers and actors have approached this work with great respect and a drive to achieve authenticity.

5851199,5,B00DRDBTT8,"If you're a previous fan of Sherlock from the first two series, I would not take the critiques up here TOO seriously, if only because this season seems very divisive among fans. Some loved it, some didn't, but I wouldn't say its either/or, and it's up to your judgment in the end, but it's absolutely worth watching regardless. I personally loved it, and I think it'll take a few more viewings before I can rank the episodes among the rest, although The Sign of Three is already one of my favorites. Most notably, this season begins more light hearted, but don't be fooled, there's darker themes going on underneath and the last episode is probably the darkest episode of Sherlock ever, period. Sherlock emerges more human and flawed than ever and it's inevitably changed the show a bit, but I'm intrigued to keep watching, because it's fascinating, the show and the character! I think every show has a season that is used to build, set up a new direction for the show, and thus it lags a little. This is probably that season for Sherlock, but it's by no means bad. It'll definitely be interesting to see where Sherlock, the character and the show, go from here.

*Note- There are also a ton of earlier reviews from fall '13 that are ridiculous, not only because the series wasn't even OUT YET??? But they're purposefully lying about the episodes' story lines. Just keep that in mind, again, make your own judgement. Sherlock is wonderful, better than 90% of shows on the air right now and totally worth your time.",1389916800,5,1514,4.649253731343284

5851201,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I've seen a lot of people bashing this season as not fitting the Sherlock Holmes we know and love but it truly is better than you might initially think. (Also beware spoilers, though I will try to keep them minimal). I have currently seen each new episode at least twice, and each time I watch them, I appreciate them a bit more.

The biggest complaint is the change, but just like the awkwardness we see in The Blind Banker, episode 1 of this season shows us John and Sherlock trying to find a new balance after 2 years apart. John spent those two years trying to cope with the loss of his best friend and in some ways reason for living (remember the bedsit?), while Sherlock was deep undercover eliminating the threat to the only person/people he truly cares about. This has left Sherlock far more human than we remember him, and John more detached in some ways. The Empty Hearse is full of tension that is lightened with a fair amount of humor. In fact, overall until episode two, it was the most lighthearted episode we've seen. To be honest, it took a few viewings for me to fully appreciate the episode, because there is so much going on, and it's done at a rather fast pace, but overall I thought it was a solid episode.

The Sign of Three is and probably will be for a long time my favorite episode of BBC Sherlock. We see a very different Sherlock again, who is much more human, to the point of setting aside cases to help plan all of the minutia of his best friend's wedding. The play between Mary, John, and Sherlock is absolutely brilliant, and as a viewer I was torn between laughing at the sheer silliness of Sherlock (see the napkin scene), and warm feelings like during Sherlock's best man speech (one of the most touching moments I have ever seen in a show, bar none). Once again the biggest complaint I've seen is a shift of focus away from the cases (which are still there but very much in the background). But this is John's wedding, and Sherlock puts the focus he uses on mysteries to work at making John's wedding perfect. This episode also brings Sherlock's love of John into the forefront. I'm not going to argue which type of love, either best friends or possibly more, because it's beside the point. This episode was all about showing us how much John means to Sherlock, which is very important for leading into episode three.

His Last Vow brings a very well known ACD villain to life, and the actor playing CAM does a great job making you hate him right off the bat. Surprisingly the writers follow the canon more closely than normal, but I don't think that detracts from the episode. There are quite a few unexpected twists, and on the first play through I was left feeling unsatisfied at the end. So I watched it again, and realized how much was going unsaid, left for us to read between the lines. For the first time we really see Sherlock out of his depth, and I think as viewers we don't like that. Sherlock is supposed to be a genius, better than the criminals. And this time a criminal is his equal, not to mention at least one other person manages to trick him. But I think we as viewers forget that Sherlock is human. He even says ""There's always something,"" acknowledging that he isn't always right. This episode also shows us how serious Sherlock was about keeping his vow to John. So after watching it a second time and paying closer attention to the nonverbal cues, I really think the episode, while not as good as TSoT, is still a solid episode in its own right.",1389916800,261,3504,4.437888198757764

Nevertheless, it is worth watching.  As with any movie in this genre, particularly this series, it is important for you to discover the plots as they unfold.  No spoilers.

5851209,2,B00DRDBTT8,"The first two seasons of Sherlock were quite brilliant. Sadly, after a two year wait, fans will mostly be disappointed by this new series. Steve Moffat, the showrunner both for Sherlock and for Doctor Who, has gone far beyond the limits of his ability both as a writer and as a series ""mastermind.""  While there are occasional aspects of cleverness in each of the three episodes of Series 3, and some glimpses of what might have been, the general effect is so off-key as to be jarring.

Moffat has a few tropes that undermine what might otherwise have been achieved. His first trope is a total inability to write serious parts for women. His second trope is his inability to deal with emotions in anything other than a here's-a-quick-laugh manner. His final trope is to use death as merely a momentary plot device. Doctor Who became famous for characters who died, then were resurrected, then killed again, then resurrected again.... it was awful in a children's show and it's utterly ruinous in adult entertainment. In the end the audience switches off, bored and irritated. Moffat can't help doing it in Sherlock. Thus, instead of real pathos and loss we get - a stupid ""plot twist"" which is boring once and excessively tedious thereafter. But Moffat can't help it. It's how he writes. And Sherlock is the worse for it. Each of the ""unexpected twists"" were so obvious - once you know Moffat's reflexive writing style - that on first watching I wondered whether subliminal ""here it comes!!"" messages were being flashed in between frames. Nothing was surprising although much was preposterous. For example, do ex-CIA hit-people really go into hiding as .... receptionist nurses in a small London doctor's practice? Really? And not be bored out of their minds within 15 seconds? Would a man seriously on the Asperger's spectrum be able to pretend convincingly that he was in a relationship with a full-blooded woman (just to gain access to an office he could have gained access to more easily by swiping the woman's entry card directly....)? There's better fan fiction available for free on the Internet than the stuff Moffat & Co are churning out here.

On the plus side the actors are uniformly excellent, despite the clunky scripts and absurd situations. They manage to make poor dialog and inconsistent characterization fade slightly into the background because of superlative performances. If only they had better material to work with! Even the camera work, which in the first two series was as much a ""character"" as the actors we watch, is less interesting and more humdrum in Series 3.

All in all it's difficult to recommend paying the purchase price for what is a rather vapid effort. The gap between what could have been and what actually was produced is so vast as to engender nothing but lasting disappointment.

There's far too much schoolboy humor and far too little of the reason-based cleverness that made the first two series so appealing. If you're going to write a show based around a character who makes logical deductions, you can't write scripts that have gaping plot holes and which rely on ""here's another joke, please don't notice the gaps"" tricks and evasions. Sherlock's character is utterly unconvincing now, despite the very best efforts of Cumberpatch. In short, this series reflects the fact that Sherlock became far more popular than the writers expected and now they are milking it for all it's worth, without making any real effort to write scripts worthy of viewing.",1389744000,88,3501,4.917089678510998
5851210,3,B00DRDBTT8,"(Spoilers) Sherlock is the new fad, particularly in America. It's the new Wire or Breaking Bad, that programme you have to say is amazing in order to seem like an intellectual. For seasons 1 and 2, that's fair enough as they were for the most part very impressive. They had a few missteps but the good far outweighed the bad. They were two 4 star seasons that presented something filled with potential, only for all of its worst aspects to be prominent in S3. All three episodes are overlong (each took at least thirty minutes to actually start), self indulgent, nepotastic, nonsensical and sometimes even dumb. Each of which would be hastily denied by the fawning fanboys (fawnboys? You heard it here first!), delusional hordes that counter with profanities and condescension. As much as I may enjoy something, I'm always objective and bias doesn't obscure anything negative unlike with these people. So here I go, the good and the bad:

Episode 1 The Empty Hearse  7/10

The first 30%+ was unashamed procrastination, smarmy self indulgence from the writers who are aware of how popular and well thought of the show is. There was an obvious hesitation to get to the meat of the episode with the ample delays though once that initial trudge was out of the way, the last hour was highly entertaining.

Episode 2 Signs of Three  6.5/10

Worst episode of the show by far, the speech shouldn't have been longer than five minutes but went on and on. Here we see how Moffat and Gatiss pay more heed to the teenage fanboys and girls, making Sherlock sickeningly sentimental. Humanising him so much so quickly has caused the character to lose his edge. Don't get me wrong, this was the most enjoyable 6.5 episode I've ever seen, containing some great and even brilliant scenes such as the mind palace and the scene at the end where the lighting, music and Benedict Cumberbatch's acting perfectly joined together to show how Sherlock was alone and how he at that moment truly realised that fact but overall there was too much excess. It seemed, like the season in general, hastily written as it didn't make sense, which is unacceptable considering that they've had two years to work on it. You would feel getting stabbed. You'd feel a pinprick let alone something inches deep in your body. You'd also feel the blood flowing down your body as well as seeing it flow down your body, so the soldier stepping into the shower completely unaware was ridiculous too. When you take off your trousers, you look down, you look at them as otherwise you could fall over or something, therefore missing the wound and blood would never happen realistically.

Everyone knew that the major was in danger, it was obvious. He was the only one that we were told received death threats. Plus the photographer being the attempted murderer was also clear. Never before S3, to the best of my recollection, have I deduced quicker than Sherlock nor have I so clearly seen how dumb certain things are.

This is a show about cases, mysteries and character development. This episode pretty much discarded all but the latter. We got fragments of cases, one that didn't even make sense and no underlying mystery.

Humour used to weave in between the cases and mysteries but here they tried too hard to put the laughs at the forefront as opposed to real substance, yet hollow dialogue doesn't carry an episode like a good case/mystery does.

Episode 3 His Last Vow  6.9/10

Far more consistent than the other two despite once again taking half an hour to start, it focused on a case and an underlying mystery, what Sherlock used to be all about. However establishing and killing off the new villain in a single episode was far too rushed and could've/should've easily been better set up in the prior two episodes, which both seem like a waste of time spent on character development rather than having a real plot. Lars Mikkelsen's Magnussen was a compelling villain yet I can only lament at how greater he would have been if he had been in more than a single episode and if there were more skilled writers to handle his character and everything around him. It was obvious before it was shown that his vault was actually his mind and it was again clear that once this was made known, the only option would be to kill him. Having no security around or even having Sherlock and Watson searched as they arrived was idiotic and hindered an otherwise good episode.

S3 reeked of nepotism with the inclusion of Martin Freeman's wife and to a lesser degree Cumberbatch's parents was only another example of the shameless self indulgence that the makers of S3 have embraced. Having Freeman's wife as Mary Watson took me out of the experience too often and despite how nice it must be (or not!) to work with your wife, it made every scene between them seem... fake. Her being an assassin was ludicrous and considering how CAM sent her a message in Signs of Three saying that her family would be so proud, I assumed that she was being blackmailed by Magnussen, who held her family under the threat of death, to essentially go undercover to gather information only close encounters could uncover and soon after break John's heart as a way of getting under his skin as well as Sherlock's, who would be distracted from whatever Magnussen was planning by his failing to see what should have been clear to him. Being an assassin that broke into Magnussen's building, about to assassinate him, severely undercut his menace and made him look far too vulnerable too quickly. Plus as assassin that has gone into hiding you'd think wouldn't choose to live in the most surveilled city in the world, being a partner to the colleague of the most famous crime solver in the country.

Sherlock was too unintelligent this season and too much was handed to him rather than discovered by him, for instance Magnussen telling him exactly where John was about to burned alive. I watch this show to see a unique individual be brilliant and uncover plots, not to see him act all schmaltzy and happy that he has friends and express this for 30% of the season. In this way I think the writers have lost their focus.

I enjoyed a lot about all three episodes yet my mind is drawn to the many gaping flaws, and when this occurs to such an extent it's clear that while good, they were disappointing. Moriarty in S1 and 2 was constantly alluded to, this big villain behind everything. That underlying mystery that drove everything as well as the cases and character interactions are what made the show as regarded as it was. Those 3 aspects worked in unison. In S3 we had a weak implication in the first episode (with the villain telling Sherlock where to go to save his friend, no intelligence used by Holmes at all, the bomb had an off switch, again no intellect used or needed, unlike the previous two seasons), fragments of cases in the second episode that don't satisfy as they're either too brief and/or absurd (why would a guy annoyed that his noob soldier brother was killed through the negligence of his commander... try to kill another innocent soldier? Nonsensical.) and almost all character development rather than being weaved amongst intricate cases. It was all over the place. Fan service is nice but it was excessive to say the least and as an audience I think we'd rather the writers focused on giving us more of what makes Sherlock so entertaining, which are intricate cases and underlying mysteries, the two things that made Sherlock what it was.",1389744000,11,7485,4.703053435114504
5851211,4,B00DRDBTT8,"Sherlock Holmes is dead... or so the world has thought for the past two years.

But of course, he's not -- and now he must reveal that he's not dead to the world and/or Watson. ""Sherlock: Season Three"" sees  the peerless detective returning to his old life, with a lighter tone prevailing in the first two episodes -- only to take a brilliantly dark turn in the season finale. It can be a little silly, but the powerful characterizations are worth it.

In ""The Empty Hearse,"" terrorists are threatening London. So Mycroft (Mark Gatiss) hunts down his presumed-to-be-dead brother Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch), and convinces him to return to his old life. Sherlock reveals himself to Watson (Martin Freeman) in a typically dramatic, slightly goofy fashion... and Watson doesn't react well. Think repeated attempts at throttling.

But after a mysterious person kidnaps and almost kills Watson -- which is only thwarted by his girlfriend Mary (Amanda Abbington), Sherlock and a motorcycle -- he reluctantly joins forces with his old friend again, to stop an attack that could destroy the British government.

""The Sign of Three"": John and Mary's wedding is here, and Sherlock is overwrought with anxiety at the idea of his best friend leaving him behind for his new life. Also, he's terrified of making a best-man speech. But while making his speech -- and recounting various odd cases he and Watson did -- he realizes that a murderer is at the wedding. And if he doesn't act fast, someone will die.

""His Last Vow"" has Watson discovering that Sherlock is trying to take down Charles Augustus Magnussen (Lars Mikkelsen), a sadistic blackmailer. But Sherlock soon discovers that Mary is somehow embroiled in Magnussen's schemes, and has a secret past that John never knew of. To take down Magnussen -- and protect the people he loves -- Sherlock may have to do the unthinkable.

Sherlock Holmes deeply cares about John Watson, and will do anything to keep him and Mary safe, even though he fears losing him. Really, that is the central theme of ""Sherlock: Season Three"" -- the deep bond between these two men, and how Watson has ""saved"" Sherlock from his cold, cynical self by bringing warmth and humanity to his life.

However, it's also a lot lighter than the last two seasons. The first two episodes are laden with funny moments, and ""The Sign of Three"" sometimes gets downright sitcommy (Sherlock and John go out on a pub crawl, get drunk, and Sherlock pukes on a crime scene). Admittedly this stuff is hilarious, with many clever gags (""F-"" ""Cough"") and wickedly funny pokes at the Sherlock fandom (the ""slash"" theory of Sherlock's survival).

But the mysteries are still top-notch stuff, genuinely baffling and suspenseful. And the third episode slips into darker, more harrowing territory, where Sherlock's one and only vow is put to the test. The villain is hatable, the stakes are sky-high, and it has some truly shocking twists.

But while the mysteries are magnificent, the story's success rests on the magnificent acting skills of Cumberbatch and Freeman. It becomes increasingly clear that Sherlock (no matter what he says) is not a sociopath -- he cares passionately about the people who make it into his affections, almost too much. He will do anything for them, even if he believes that they will leave him behind.

Freeman's Watson remains the series' rock, although it's rather sad to see Watson struggling with his trust issues throughout the season. And Abbington -- Freeman's real-life lover -- gives an equally great performance as Mary, who realizes how essential Sherlock and John are to each other, and accepts it.

""Sherlock: Season Three"" has moments of excessive fluffiness, but the powerful undercurrent of Sherlock and John's friendship is absolutely beautiful -- and yes, the mysteries are amazing. Bring it on, Season Four!",1389744000,2,3853,5.003125
5851212,1,B00DRDBTT8,"I was able to see the three new episodes in season three, and they were incredibly disappointing. It is as if the producers forgot the Sherlock Holmes is, well, a detective.  It's more like Sherlock Holmes International Man of Mystery than the solid and very we'll produced first two seasons.

The production team is responsible for Doctor Who, and these new Sherlock shows really reflect the uneven, haphazard quality inherent in the latest Doctor Who series.  The charm, wit, and cleverness of the first two Sherlock series, and particularly the first, are absent.  Instead, Sherlock season three presents the soap operatic, interpersonal melodrama that befalls Doctor Who at its worst.  Overacting, far-fetched plots, and hollow echoes of Sherlocks past make for a disappointment to true Sherlock fans.",1389571200,55,805,5.307086614173229
5851213,3,B00DRDBTT8,"Why should I write a review when I haven't seen these episodes yet? Because I felt that they would not meet expectations and judging from the other reviews I was right. I am a HUGE Sherlock Holmes fan and this series held out high hopes that there was at last a modern day version that might approach the true flavor of Doyle's work. I predicted that these episodes would be a disappointment simply because Benedict Cumberbatch was on his way to becoming a big screen star and didn't put the time or best effort into this production; a ""filler"" if you will. If his star continues to rise (which is great) it wouldn't surprise me if the series dies completely. No one thus far has surpassed the performances of Jeremy Brett who is the epitome of Holmes. We shall see. I'm buying this episode nevertheless as I collect all Sherlock Holmes episodes.",1389484800,3,846,4.572368421052632
5851214,5,B00DRDBTT8,"When I first watched The Empty Hearse, I felt a bit disenchanted. It was fast-paced in a different, very erratic--a word that several articles have used to describe this series so far--way. I wanted to laugh at the humorous bits, but didn't find them funny enough. It had just failed to meet my expectations, yet I was excited to be watching it. All-in-all, I felt absolutely nothing after finishing it, which is an altogether unfamiliar feeling for me after finishing an episode of Sherlock.

About a couple of days later, however, I decided to revisit it, and haven't regretted my decision since.

Maybe it's missing some of its old flair to some, but I think a lot of it has to do with the plain and simple fact that things have changed for both Sherlock and Watson. Sherlock's more human, and, in a sense, a bit weaker because of it, but he's still Sherlock (though I'm sure some would disagree).
...And Watson? Well, he's said himself that two people have greatly changed his life: First Sherlock, then Mary. Mary is now in the picture--Watson's got a wife, and (skip this if you don't want spoilers) quite possibly a child along the way. Even in Doyle's works, this was a significant change in their lives, as it would be in anyone's life. When you put all this into consideration, the events of Series 3 aren't as surprising, and its mood is a bit different, but suitably so. It's still the show I fell in love with, I think, just headed in a new direction.

Yes, sometimes Sherlock (in particular) feels a bit out of character, his actions and the reactions of others seem a bit absurd/irrational, and a lot of 'deductions' and other bits seem to be more bizarre/left unexplained. And, yes, it's definitely got more humour in it than before. And I'm sure some people feel that it's too obvious sometimes. That is the one complaint I will agree with wholeheartedly.

When it comes to the loose ends, the bits that feel unexplained, though--these explanations that the 'fans' felt they deserved--I will say this: Even in the first two series/seasons of Sherlock, there have been a few inaccuracies and simply unrealistic occurrences. It's important to remember that this is a fictional detective show, and should be treated as such. As Sherlock rightly notes of John's blogs, real life doesn't quite  work like that way. Certain aspects are embellished. If you want realistic, watch a different detective/cop show. Though I guarantee it won't have the same feeling, the same excitement, the thrill, because these shows don't romanticize crime, murder, and the investigations involved quite the same way.

For what it is, I like this series. The mood is different, sure, but it's still enjoyable, you just have to give it another chance. I'm still enjoying it immensely.

I'll still be watching.

(If not, take heart, you'll have an hour twenty minutes for the other things that call for your attention.)",1388880000,185,2909,4.81563126252505
5851215,2,B00DRDBTT8,"I can't believe that the producers of the excellent first two seasons made these episodes.  How could they turn this series into a soap opera?  Season 3 begins with The Empty Hearse, the conclusion to the Season Two cliff-hanger.  I was disappointed.  While I loved the idea, the execution of the scheme was really pretty ridiculous, like something you would expect in a Disney sitcom.  I expected to see bigger and better things for the death of Moriarty.  This was seriously weak.  Worst of all, many details in the story line were just glossed over.  Get used to it, because in this season the mystery is the least important element in any story.  Solving a mystery should be the best part!  The episode was also difficult to follow because there were so many flashbacks, while the video editing was done by a meth junkie, IMO. The dramatic use of the editing room is another overused artifice fans will find irritating in all the new episodes.  In the end, the first episode raised more questions than it answered.  I found it overwhelmingly unsatisfactory.  I wish I could find something more to like about it.
Episode two started out in a very thrilling fashion, with bank robbers foiling Scotland Yard.  But it was all over before the opening credits.  What a wasted opportunity.  It was nothing more than a tease!  The rest of the episode was all about Watson's wedding and the Holmes/Watson bromance.  A fascinating murder mystery was thrown in as an afterthought, covered completely in perhaps ten minutes of this 90 minute episode. They almost didn't bother with such tiresome details like how the crime was actually accomplished.  The producers of the series have gone wildly off track.  Solving a mystery is no longer the central purpose of the story, but merely background to emotional drama.  There really is no longer a reason for a mystery lover to watch the series.  Now if you're wondering whether Sherlock might ever find love...
Then watch episode three, which actually starts out to be a real mystery.  But just as you are thanking the producers for including a fascinating episode in the season, it degenerates into a spiral of video outtakes and dream sequences.  I warned you the director had lost it.  Someone should have hidden his stash.  Just as the episode appears to regain its momentum, it loses its way again. There were severe flaws in the logic of the plot, and instead of a mystery we got the dirtbag monologues. There seemed to be no point to the episode at all (unless you count the soap opera drama).  Getting rid of the villain certainly didn't involve any special Sherlock cleverness.  I finally couldn't stand watching it any longer, and just wanted the last 20 minutes to be over.  Honestly, they completely lost me as a fan.  Save your money and hope Season 3 doesn't kill the franchise.",1388880000,21,2831,4.765432098765432
5851216,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Where to start.......i could rave about this episode all day. Previously my favorite had been 'a scandal in belgravia' for its cheeky humor. 'The empty hearse' blows that out of the water.
SPOILERS:
Without giving too much away......Former Sherlock hater turned fan club president Anderson (the 'former' cop) shares his (and a fanclub member's) theories of how Sherlock faked his suicide.....which turns out part James Bond, crazy stunt and mannequin thrown off the roof, involving a bromance with Moriarty.......yes, it sounds crazy and it is hilarious.
Sherlock himself gives an explanation a lot more plausible and less exciting.....leaving Anderson underwhelmed. Sherlock sums it up nicely......""everyone's a critic"".
Maybe some fans of the show will feel underwhelmed as well but the solution worked for me.
Sherlock's lenghty reunion with Watson is just stellar......at once funny, touching......i had goosebumps and i held my breath......it was worth the wait.
Mary, John's girlfriend, is a nice and charming addition, never distracting from the relationship of Sherlock & watson.
The terrorist plot is secondary here because most of the time is spend on rebuilding relationships with Watson, Molly, Lestrade, Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson......and i loved every minute of it.

I mean, I heard that Sherlock survived by miraculously turning into a dragon and that John then joined a troop of dwarves on an epic quest to find him, traveling across the entire country and running into all sorts of dangers.  That was what I was expecting to see, not Sherlock just surprising John showing up at a cafe with Irene Adler (who, in a twist, was revealed to be both his rescuer and the 15th Doctor). False advertising!

If anyone saw the real reunion, surely Sherlock not even recognizing his former flatmate and attempting to burn him alive was a thousand times more heartbreaking than John fainting before forgiving Sherlock instantly?",1387411200,17,816,4.891304347826087

5851220,5,B00DRDBTT8,"After waiting with mounting impatience for Season 3, it was an absolute joy to review it early.
  The first question on my mind was, of course, ""How the heck did Sherlock survive the fall?!""
Well, if you're reading this, you don't mind spoilers: he didn't. He died, and was whisked away by Molly Hooper to a secret laboratory in the Sussex Downs (disguised as a branch of the Apiculturists' Association) There, he was reanimated via electricity using a technique Molly learned while studying in Ingolstadt; sharp-eyed viewers will remember this was foreshadowed in ""The Hounds of Baskerville"".
  He then spent three years in Pakistan and Tibet under the alias of Sigerson Paget, taking out Moriarty's crime syndicate while avoiding suspicion with little more than contact lenses, various hair dyes, and a stoop-shouldered walk.
(How he could keep a low profile with an alias like that is another question entirely.) On his travels, he crossed paths with a truly ruthless sniper by name of Sebastian Moran, who had been Moriarty's second-in-command.

Sherlock's return was beautifully done, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Reunion Scene: John's mixture of shock, anger at the deception, and ultimately cracking a zombie joke was a true tour de force. His reunion with Mycroft was equally priceless, and I cackled loud and long seeing Mycroft I-am-the-British-Government Holmes FAINT at the sight of his little brother.

Now on to the episodes:
  THE EMPTY HEARSE: When a prominent businessman's body is found missing from his hearse, it is discovered that a former cagefighter named Rathbone -""Rat"" for short- known as the Giant of Sumatra, is operating an organ trafficking ring; ""Rat"" enlists Moran's help in an attempt on Sherlock's life in retaliation, which is foiled spectacularly by use of an extremely life-like animatronic double.
  (Sherlock keeps the double for target-practice afterward, in a fit of black humor/attempt at guilt-tripping his former flatmate over John's engagement to Mary Morstan)
 THE SIGN OF THREE: This adventure begins with John and Mary's wedding -Sherlock's the best man!- interrupted though it is by Toms Sholto's band of three-fingered assassins: the ""Six Pearls"" abduct Mary under the belief that she knows the location of a priceless treasure, leading our heroes on a suspenseful chase along the Thames to save her from their clutches.
 One would think that after the Black Lotus assassins in Season 1, the novelty would wear off, but I was riveted by these new antagonists nonetheless.

5851224,5,B00DRDBTT8,"I'm a '60s kid, and much too old for fangirling, even if I was the right sex, but I'm addicted to the show as much as the fangirls are (though I draw the line at ""shipping""). Heck, though, Sherlock is testing my stamina as well as my hearing. Benedict Cumberbatch talks at roughly the speed computer chips used to go in the days before computer chips started going at the speed of light. Which is difficult enough for a brain like mine that only goes at the speed of clockwork, but on top of that you have the visual graffiti, those fly-past word-jumbles that litter the screen like a hallucinogenic Scrabble game every time some new character attracts Sherlock's gaze. It makes for an information-flow that is more than my cerebral cortex can process without overloading the circuits and causing smoke to leak from my ears.

Still, there's always the good old BBC iPlayer where you can re-play the show at your leisure. I've seen two episodes so far, and careful analysis of the content tells me that Sherlock is still alive and Moriarty is still dead. That's about all I can say for a certainty, because in terms of comprehension I'm struggling along at the back of the pack.

But certainty is not something you should look for in any case from Sherlock, which specializes in teasing the viewer. Steven Moffat is just one of three writers for the series, but it is his presence that is most strongly felt, even in episodes he didn't write. In many ways the psychology of the show occupies the same territory as Moffat's other show, Doctor Who, where comedy and drama can alternate several times within the space of a minute, and false scents and long-delayed payoffs are part of a strategy that seems increasingly audience-aware. In Episode 1, The Empty Hearse, Moffat goes as far as lampooning his own fans, or the hard-core at least, by dramatizing no less than three different solutions to Sherlock's faked death based on theories circulating on the internet since the Reichenbach Fall episode that seemingly killed him off (and then seemingly didn't). It's gone further than any show has before in breaking the ""fourth wall"", and is edging dangerously close to what would probably be called Deconstructionist drama, where the distinction between actors and audience is dissolved entirely, and where fictional structure falls into a Perception Paradox and implodes with a gentle sigh. No, I'm joking (I think).

But say what you like about Moffat (and many bad things have been said), he's never boring. If this remarkable show is going to vanish down its own plughole, I'd like to be there to see it happen. In the meantime, here are some good reasons to keep watching:

Martin Freeman as Dr Watson - surely the face-actor of all time. First seen as Tim Canterbury in The Office (UK original), Freeman can do more with a fleeting look than others can do with a whole paragraph of speech. There is a lunatic moment in Episode 2 (The Sign of Three) where, for no obvious reason, he calls Sherlock ""mate"". In the barely perceptible pause that follows, the merest flash of facial expression succeeds brilliantly in conveying his astonishment at himself for having used such a blokey form of address. It happens so fast that the inattentive viewer could easily miss it, but for me it was the funniest moment in an episode that contained a lot of funny moments. More than that, it reinforces the feeling I've always had that Freeman does not play Watson; Freeman *is* Watson. He is thinking and feeling everything that Watson is thinking and feeling, no acting required. A master-class.

Una Stubbs as Mrs Hudson - often described in her native land as a ""national treasure"", which undervalues her. In my view, she's precious enough to deserve her own vault in the Bank of England with guards at the door 24/7. Older viewers will remember her in Worzel Gummidge playing opposite Jon Pertwee as Aunt Sally. (I mean she, not Jon Pertwee, was Aunt Sally.) Viewers even older than that will remember her as Rita in Till Death Us Do Part (US remake: All in the Family). Mrs Hudson, the good-hearted chatterbox, is not an easy part to play without becoming tiresome, but Stubbs hits exactly the right tone and is an essential ingredient in at least two great comic scenes.

Look out for:
Lars Mikkelson as Charles Augustus Magnussen, who promises to be the new Moriarty. I say ""look out for"", because so far we've seen only his eyes, which might or might not be a conscious echo of the eyes-only view we had of the new Doctor (Peter Capaldi) in The Day of the Doctor. Undoubtedly cast on the strength of his impressive performance in the Danish series, Forbrydelsen (The Killing), he might be a sign of a change in mood. Up to now the present season has tended more towards the comic and self-referential. Mikkelsen's appearance might be the moment when the new season turns serious.

Speculate about:
Mary Morstan, as played by Martin Freeman's real-life partner, Amanda Abbington. In Episode 2 she marries Watson, and Sherlock is best man. However, in the previous episode Sherlock had subjected her to his usual scrutiny at their first encounter, generating a screenful of the aforementioned word-jumbles: ""linguist"", ""nurse"", ""short-sighted"", ""cat-lover"", ""bakes own bread"", and several others. One that could easily be missed is ""liar"". Was that thrown in on a whim, or is it a time-bomb? Hmmm......

That's my review. What follows below is something I posted back in September, when Amazon was offering the DVDs for Season 3 on pre-order. Which was absurdly premature, since not only had the season not been screened yet, it hadn't even been shot. We were being invited to review discs for a non-existent show. So, predictably, a lot of people took up the challenge. I couldn't resist making my own contribution, in the form of a Victorian fantasy. I should probably delete it now, since it's lost its topicality, but people seemed to like it, so I'll leave it be.

*************************

(Scene: 221b Baker St, London NW1. Date: April 1st, 1895)

WATSON: Pray, Holmes, instead of puffing on that ridiculously large pipe and staring moodily out of the window, apprise me of the solution to the Case of the Missing Moving-Picture Show.

HOLMES:  I'm cogitating, Watson.

WATSON: Indeed? Well, let us hope Mrs Hudson doesn't enter unexpectedly.

HOLMES:  You are very droll.

WATSON: I confess, Holmes, that I grow vexed at your obfuscation. You speak mysteriously of products that are for sale, yet do not exist; which can be rated and ranked and judged for quality by their customers, yet the warehouses that supposedly store them are empty. You can buy them, but cannot hold them in your hands. You speak of dogs that didn't bark in the night, of cars that didn't park in the night, and ghosts that didn't give me a fright, but still I know no more than I did at the start.

HOLMES:  Very well. I see that I have been remiss in not furnishing you with the fruits of my mental labours. Consider, Watson: once you have eliminated the absurd, whatever remains, however ludicrous, must be the total minus the former.

WATSON: That's the latter.

HOLMES: You have it precisely.

WATSON: And what is it, in a nutshell?

HOLMES: It's a nut, Watson, as any book on botany will reveal.

WATSON: I mean, what is your conclusion in this case.

HOLMES: Ah. My conclusion is that we have been conspired against by men from the future.

WATSON: Good Lord! Is that possible?

HOLMES: I am forced to deduce it from the evidence. Outside we hear the reassuring clip-clop of horses and the rattle of carriages, but these men, inhabiting this same street, hear the sound of machines flying overhead.

WATSON: Holmes, you never cease to astonish me. But what of this conspiracy?

HOLMES: Seemingly it is the doing of an inter-galactic time-traveller, who I am led to believe is a sinister Chinaman called Doctor Hu. This cosmic mischief-maker hurtles across the centuries in a stolen police-box, accompanied only by a succession of ""companions"", who I understand to be attractive young women who run a lot. By his agency, we -- that's you and I, Watson -- have been constrained to have our lives re-lived in some future century. And these have been recorded as images on a kinematograph, and compressed, if you can believe it, onto a single spinning disc.

WATSON: You mean, like a gramophone record?

HOLMES: Just so, except smaller and much more difficult to get out of its case without bending it.

WATSON: Remarkable. And they have recorded our expeditions and peregrinations?

HOLMES: That is my conclusion. We two, and Mrs Hudson besides, have been mimicked and made a mockery of by skilled impersonators with preposterous names, like.... Cumberdick Bendersquatch, or some such thing. He, it seems, is my alter ego, while yours is colloquially known as ""Tim from the office"". I am unable to ascertain what office that might be, and can only surmise that he's a renegade government clerk fallen on hard times.

WATSON: But why us, Holmes? What use can be made of our lives by these ruffians from another century?

HOLMES:  Aha. Well, I have since delved further. And, as I suspected, there is second criminal mind at work, one that keeps to the shadows and dark places while he concocts his fiendish plots. You see, Watson, Doctor Hu is but the visible face, while the brain belongs to another.

WATSON: Good Lord, Holmes, is there no end to the ingenuity of those who would bring us down? Does this mastermind have a name?

HOLMES:  He does, yet I can hardly bring myself to utter it.

WATSON: You don't mean--?

HOLMES:  My nemesis? The one man of whom I fear I will never be rid? I wish it were not so. Yet I must conclude that it is.

WATSON: Moffiarty!

HOLMES:  Exactly so, Watson. The only begetter of this devilish scheme is indeed Professor Moffiarty. And Doctor Hu is Moffiarty's creature and does his bidding in all things.

WATSON: Holmes, I shudder to think that your nemesis assaults us yet again! What mischief has this demon conjured up in that future time?

HOLMES:  Killing, mostly. He is notorious as a killer and a destroyer of dreams. On a mere whim he has killed several of Doctor Hu's running ""companions"", some of them more than once, and left a trail of weeping women around the world who have followed the Doctor's adventures on the kinematograph. At any hour of the day or night their despairing wail can be heard: ""Moffiarty!! Nooooooooo!!...crying now.""

WATSON: Then, at the very least he deserves a straight left to the chin, for I abhor the maltreatment of the gentler sex. What a bounder!

HOLMES:  Hush, Watson. I fancy the game is not yet afoot, still less ayard or amile. Let us ask ourselves the following questions....

5851225,4,B00DRDBTT8,"It was great to hear that season 3 is finally seeing the light, after a wait since season 2 to shame the ""Eagles"". But I say it's worth it, even if some of his older fans didn't make it to the Promised Land. Us whipper-snappers of fifty still remember being glued to our clunky flat-screen plasma television sets (don't laugh - it was a very long time ago), live-blogging the episodes with our ""tumblr"" friends. (Ask your mother about that one.)

Scheduling snafus aside, it's the good old days at 221B once again! Well, sort of: the story had to get tweaked a bit along the way to adjust for the tectonic shifts in society and technology between the last two seasons. We know how picky those Generation Z young 'uns are about their 'IntraBrainFlix' direct streaming queues. Thankfully, the first seasons of ""Sherlock"" have long aged past 'dated' and into 'retro', so the new season is sure to find its audience.

The stories still follow the old ACD canon, with some tasteful updating for the modern times. Sherlock and John, reunited after a thirty year separation, once more chase criminals, though on rather creakier joints or strapped into their scratched-up old 6th generation exoskeletons. But if it's not quite fast times for our boys anymore, it's still high times, though Sherlock, bowing to his doctor's wisdom and his inability to keep on healthy weight, has finally forsaken cocaine in favor of cannabis, which His Nearly-All-Powerful Excellence Mycroft Holmes legalized in 2019 after assuming control of Western Europe in a bloodless and highly efficient lunch hour coup.

Our heroes are not quite what they used to be - John's once psychosomatic limp is now a very real one due to a cyborg leg that seems to have a mind of its own, and Sherlock's back can't handle more than thirty consecutive minutes of elegant sprawls on the sofa before the A.I. climate and resident wellness monitoring system of 221B starts to chide him in a motherly tone, - but the thrills and spills are still there, even if now they sometimes revolve around blood pressure jumps and incontinence. Sherlock is still the misanthropic genius we remember, though perhaps a touch more cantankerous now that his aging 'transport' insists on regularly scheduled refueling and maintenance, and John, well, John's just happy to have Sherlock back after all these years. And sure, his four grown children quirked their eyebrows a bit at their dear old Dad suddenly running off from the family home to shack up with an ex-boyfriend in his dotage, but that's life for you.

Favorite episodes: ""The Case of the Missing Moon Shuttle"", ""Nanobot Nuisance, part 2"", and ""The Other Locked Room Mystery"", where John spends forty minutes in front of 221B searching his pockets for the house keys clenched in his hand.",1379289600,17,2787,4.8734177215189876
5851226,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Original Gag Review: I couldn't believe I was picked to be an early reviewer, and it was a treat indeed!
The biggest spoiler that I still can't wrap my head around was the fact that Sherlock was so quickly able to disguise Moriarty's body as his own which he threw down the edge of the building.
The Sign of Three's biggest spoiler is that Irene Adler returns with what's left of Moriarty's criminal empire, including the black lotus and an even larger wave of serial killer taxi drivers.
Finally, in the Last Vow, of all the spoilers in the world, Sherlock confesses his love for Mrs. Hudson and their wedding is planned. The episode ends in such an amazing manner, such that even I of all people couldn't see the end coming(Mrs. Hudson is Moriarty's mom).
Genius writing, genius acting, definitely the best Sherlock series of all time.

Real Review: I see an unnecessary amount of negative reviews for the first episode on here. I will admit that the formatting of the first two episodes is a rough divergence from the first two seasons. It does not however, mean that these two episodes are bad. They are in fact, great episodes, and I'd recommend watching them three times each before watching the season finale. It quite nicely ends the series and I was greatly satisfied with only one qualm(which is a spoiler so I won't talk about it here). I thoroughly recommend this series and this season is no exception. Genius writing, genius acting, definitely the best Sherlock series of all time.",1378944000,23,1495,4.706106870229007

5851228,5,B00DRDBTT8,"When I say the Series 3 was tremendously ambitious, it was. Yet it did not fail to set the bar really high for the other BBC drama and shows the whole world round. I still can't get over how they faked Sherlock's death.

And their reunion! My God. I've been crying for a few hours after watching the first episode. really!
In the first episode, you can see how much Sherlock restrains himself from jumping John.

Pretty racy scenes for the nest 2 episodes. ugh. utter perfection. The sex scenes were immaculate! great cinematography. everything looks delicate. you can feel how much they love each other while giving in to their pleasures. ugh. utter perfection!!!",1378512000,7,664,4.765217391304348
5851229,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Well, I must say, Moffat didn't disappoint us! Sherlock explaining to John that the Doctor swooped in last minute in his TARDIS to save him as he fell, and him and John professing their undying love for each other, was a great way to kick off the season! I was, however, a little confused as to why they broke into song half way through the first episode, but with every sherlock episode comes a little confusion, I suppose!

Season 3 has premiered on BBC One, and in a few short weeks it will premiere in the U.S. on PBS. BBC is making it available online for a short time, to those that can watch it on their iPlayer. PBS will also make it available online for a short time on their website when it premieres.

This review will not give any spoilers for those who have not been able to view it. I know that this DVD set is going to be out next month (so I do not know what DVD people have been reviewing before, as it is only on pre-order). I am assuming that Season 3 will also be streamed soon on Amazon Prime, like the first two seasons.

In short, the wait was worth it. I so enjoy the writing and the evolution of the story line, the characters, and their milieu. I do not want to question, I do not want to think. I want to be so absorbed, so immersed that I can be swept away by the world of Sherlock and John. And when I do, for a moment, stop to think, to contemplate, it is in satisfaction.

I was prepared to love it. I was actually prepared to hate it (cynic that I can be). I was not prepared to feel the exact same rush (exhilaration?) that I did before in the first two seasons.

There is nothing else like it on TV. And I hope that there never will be, because with writers like Moffat and Gatiss, and actors like Cumberbatch and Freeman, I hope things will only keep getting better and more amazing. You will not be disappointed. There is a certain comfort (for me) in knowing that I am on the same page as Gatiss.

When this last episode plays, I may be needing some type of therapy.

My desperate wait for the Season 3 premiere below from last year, still available for those that enjoyed my rambling:

SHERLOCK AND JOHN WITHDRAWAL

Here I was telling all and sundry about my obsession with Sherlock and Watson and that I was so glad that Season 3 was finally near; and lo and behold the release date has changed yet again! January 2014 is now the latest it will be appearing to relieve my strained and deprived mind of any sort of intelligent entertainment. I have now become a low-functioning Sherlockaholic.

To alleviate this distressing disorder, I have taken the liberty of re-watching Seasons 1+2. The fact that those two seasons are supremely spectacular has given me the ability to fumble along in this mundane world that can in no way compare to living at 221B Baker St. And it has made this wait somewhat bearable.

I fear that if Season 3 is delayed one more time, this withdrawal may become so severe that moving to London may be my only solution.

However, for those Sherlockians who are rating Season 3 so poorly, because of the release date, I say (in the words of Sherlock) to ""'Delete' because only the important stuff matter,"" (very loosely quoted from Season 1).

And on that note, in the eventual Season 3 release, you will get a review from me that is written along the same lines of my Seasons 1+2 reviews.

But for now, yes, this has become a Watson-esque blog (which may, depending on the release date, be expounded upon significantly).",1378339200,23,3101,4.351819757365685
5851231,5,B00DRDBTT8,"Not only was my little fangirl heart toyed with when I stumbled upon the pre order of Sherlock series three on my regular visit to the site, but now Amazon is making a point of sending me emails reminding me that we still have to wait months in agonizing wait for the first episode to air!!!!! Oh well, such is life.  There is a silver lining in the fact that the shooting of series three has just wrapped, and I get to enjoy the reviews by fellows fans with more clever and witty theories of what will eventually be on said DVD set. If the two previous series are any indication, it will be brilliant! Not only are Moffat and Gatiss fantastic writers, they're also huge Sherlock fanboys! Which is probaly why they make such exquisite programs we all enjoy.  Add to that the cast's phenomenal performances and it's no wonder we can get enough.  Just look at that teaser trailer, the emotion shown by the actors is sublime. Ok, I'll stop gushing now :)",1378339200,26,951,4.422857142857143

It was for Mycroft and all, which is great, but I really missed Rupert Graves. Neve McIntosh does a great job though.
