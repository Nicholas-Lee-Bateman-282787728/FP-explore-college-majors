5794987,5,B00DENJIDU,"I'm a big fan of the romcom genre, but am frequently disappointed at the formulaic, predictable plot lines and one-sided characters. Enter A Big Love Story: I'm a happy fan! The flawed but utterly lovable characters make this movie, and the clever premise gets two thumbs up. Well-written and skillfully directed, this flick will be added to our library of faves that will be watched over and over again (along with Dan in Real Life and Easy A). If you need a laugh, want to believe in love again, or just need a good date movie, I highly recommend A Big Love Story.",1382918400,15,566,4.504854368932039
5794988,5,B00DENJIDU,"This movie tells the story of a guy that was on the road to glory, but due to a career ending injury has fallen into the mediocrity of life, and is nearing rock bottom. The thing I love about this movie is how real it feels. The actors in this movie do a great job of portraying believable characters in a compelling story.

5794990,5,B00DENJIDU,"My wife and I had the pleasure of seeing this beautiful film at two separate film festivals in Oregon. The first one being at the Bend Film Festival. That one was attended by my friend and director of this film Ryan Sage. Great q & a afterwards. The second time was at the Hood River film festival, which Robbie Kaller (Sam) attended. Again, a great q&a with a great, down to earth guy.
We had family members attend with us and we were all blown away by how touching, honest and real this film is. Not a typical love story by any stretch. Excellent script by Dale Zawada. Amazing performances. Glad that it's getting this deserved DVD release.",1380585600,3,643,4.4576271186440675

In other words a reason to look beyond the physical. But there were no endearing qualities to this guy at all! He was rude, dumb, lazy, and a real jerk to the girl. Now I get that he can lose weight and look OK. But he will always be a jerk. I don't know why she would have chosen him. Just another movie reiterating the false notion that a woman NEEDS to have a man. No matter what. She should always settle.  Stupid idea. Stupid film.",1454198400,3,583,4.15929203539823

The female lead, who is a trainer, smokes while sitting on the floor in the middle of the gym. Really?? That scene, and subsequent ones of her training her overweight client between drags on a cigarette, are so unbelievable and ridiculous that it's hard to continue watching the movie. The lead male has some very endearing moments. But the writing on this movie is just average and the characters, other than Mr. Big Love (who is darling), aren't very likable or memorable.

5795093,3,B00DENJIDU,"Cute story line, I cared about the characters, acting was amateurish (except for the main character's best friend, can't remember his name, but he was pretty good).  I do wonder why the main character was reduced to grown man with a childish persona, and that bothered me a bit.  Just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's stupid.  He didn't always come across that way but more often than not I found myself shaking my head at him.  (""I'm a cheeseburger, hehheheh"").  And I do like the fact that his love interest wasn't pure perfection.  She didn't look like a personal trainer and she smoked constantly, but that made her likable.  She's reminiscent of Zooey Deschanel from Elf, sort of snarky but sweet.  Would it have been nice if he fell in love with someone his size?  Yes, but I'm not sure the story would be the same.  Whether that's a good thing is debatable.",1443139200,4,873,4.6103896103896105

I suppose this is a more realistic story than some, wading through issues surrounding obesity. For some reason, I find the movie in my digital line-up; Likely, I'll go back to finish the story I began a couple nights ago. I contrast it with Lbs, which I watched a few weeks ago, during a lull in summer-time activities. I much prefer that story to this one--it has more energy, and documents bigger changes (pun intended) As I write that line, I come to the crux of the issue--both movies are slow documentaries.",1441670400,2,687,4.59349593495935

Explores how fear and loss from years earlier can hold us back in the present, but real human connection can move us forward again.

Implying that loving an overweight person and sticking with them while they lose weight (and then actually become lovable) makes you some kind of selfless hero is beyond irritating.  Media still just can't seem to wrap their minds around the concept of someone being lovable at their most imperfect.

Ginny and I will never get this 90 minutes back.

JESUS!  This won awards?

HOW????????????

I'm giving this 2 stars b/c the dude reminds me of my friend Matt who was a running back from SUNY Albany and their hair and laugh are very similar.

If he didn't look like my friend Matt - I would've tried to give it 1/2 star.

Also - hey - i get the whole demographic thing.  I'm 45.  So...if it were meant for (yes, I type the word if and follow it with the word 'were') folks 14-32...ok...sure....fine...but...wow....this movie was pretty horrible.

*Spoiler Alert* A trainer smoking in the gym where others are working out.  I mean - ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME?  Seriously.  No one smokes in the gym - especially the trainer.

The big guy's roommate wasn't likeable - ROMCOMs have ""LIKEABLE"" characters...and...well...the character most likable was the freaking DUDE who took his shirt off whenever he could...him or the freaking GOLDFISH!

I won't apologize for thinking this movie was horrible.

The actors can be the nicest folks in the world but this movie is just..... BLEHHHHH (that's me throwing up)...

I wish the very best for everyone involved with the movie in front of the scenes and behind the scenes...just b/c i didn't like the movie doesnt mean these folks aren't nice ppl...it just means that the movie they were associated with, I didn't find very entertaining or ROMCOM enough.

If you liked this movie - cool...you liked it...I don't look at you negatively...I just know that I'm right and you're wrong.

Yes...Seriously.

If you're looking for mindless fun - this is not the movie for you.  Ginny and I were.  And BOY.  Did we get hosed.

Best of luck picking a movie.

If you read this to the 'bitter' end...do yourself a favor - watch FORENSIC FILES - at least the ending is positive and uplifting where the bad guy/gal is caught and put in jail.

Robbie Kaller and the rest of the fine talent behind this lovely kept me intrigued and satisfied.  Hope to find more of these gems on Prime.",1402444800,6,395,5.076923076923077
5795320,2,B00DENJIDU,"I expected so much from this movie since most people gave it high ratings and the story line seemed different to other love stories. The movie had potential but the characters were pretty weak. They lacked expression and failed to convince me of what they were trying to portray.

Not horrible but not good either.",1402099200,3,314,4.709090909090909
5795321,1,B00DENJIDU,This movie had too much foul language and vulgarity.  It wasn't my kind of movie.  The actual story line was ok.,1401494400,6,112,4.285714285714286
5795322,4,B00DENJIDU,"I gave this movie 4 stars because it had a good story development and good actors. I liked that it was not a Hollywood production and had a real feeling to it. Yet, I kinda missed a wow-factor, something that would help me remember the movie. I would recommend it to people who want to see something different that the typical glamor-losing-weight Hollywood story.",1401148800,,364,4.703125

5795324,4,B00DENJIDU,"Very charming, simple story of friendship, love and second chances.  The best friend is a interesting as the lead character.  Worth your time to watch this one.",1401062400,,160,4.888888888888889

5795329,4,B00DENJIDU,"At first, I was not quite fond about the title of this movie but decided to take the chance and watch it anyway. However, it turned out to be pretty okay.  This movie is a feel good, hopeful flick, that every and anyone can relate too, in one way or another.  Good movie.",1400630400,,271,4.09433962264151
5795330,3,B00DENJIDU,"Filmed almost like a documentary which gave it a fresh appeal.  It was amusing and somewhat inspiring.  Characters were well played, like-able and easy to relate to.",1400457600,,165,5.074074074074074
5795331,4,B00DENJIDU,Sweet uplifting story ... not formula. The story of two unlikely people who come together ... and share an unusual friendship and bond ...,1399766400,,138,4.791666666666667
5795332,2,B00DENJIDU,"This premise had potential, but the characters didn't ever really materialize in an honest, believable way.  I wouldn't recommend it.",1398643200,,133,5.65
8592631,4,B00DENJIDU,"I liked it but it's not plausible. Not because he looks like a manatee; because I dated several large ladies in college but rather because he's a grown man who works in a bowling alley. Realistically, no woman will want to be with a guy with so many minuses. Now if he we're a great looking guy and worked for nickels, it might be believable or if he were just a big fat person but was worth millions of dollars this relationship would make sense.

Anyway, it was good for what it says it is. No surprises but no major letdowns and as a bonus you actually begin to find yourself rooting for our husky friend to reel himself a solid 7/10 in spite of him thinking she's a 10. The supporting characters were borderline lame and almost seemed unnecessary to the story line.

I recommend this movie if you're looking to burn an hour and a half or as something to play in the background without having to pay too much attention to but still be able to follow along while distracted.",1527724800,,976,4.327868852459017
8592632,3,B00DENJIDU,"First and foremost, this is improbable.  A huge guy and his skinny trainer (who is nearly a chain smoker, BTW--NEVER in real life!!!!!) fall in love.  Nice that he is inspired to change his life and that she sees past the morbidly obese guy to his inner person, but highly implausible.  I'm a big person, and trust me, this kind of love story only exists in your fantasies (and wouldn't it have been nicer if he had found a woman his own size and fallen in love with her--two lives changed for the better?).  The ending was less than satisfying, as well.  The trivia indicates the story was purchased on Craigslist for $500.  Yep.  That doesn't surprise me.",1525478400,2,657,4.516949152542373
