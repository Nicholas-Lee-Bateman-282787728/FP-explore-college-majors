8100415,5,B000CQK47G,"This is one of the funniest shows I've seen in a long time and, although I've seen most of it online before, I jumped at the chance to own them on dvd, even I can only play them on my computer (linked up to the tv, of course). On the other hand, if you're easily offended, don't buy this set. The British have the same sense of humour that we used to have before we embraced political correctness in North America and these ""Too Hot for TV"" shows are about as politically incorrect as you can get. I couldn't stop laughing.",1471305600,,523,4.188118811881188
