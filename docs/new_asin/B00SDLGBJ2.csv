8698184,5,B00SDLGBJ2,"Professors Michele Gordon, Victor Fischer, and James Caron are clearly excellent in giving the history and insight of our hero Sam Clemens / Mark Twain's time in Tuolumne and Calaveras Counties.  They are erudite and eloquent.  What an informative joy to have them connect this pivotal time in Twain's life to my students who are studying his incredibly extraordinary experiences that he transformed into the columns of our American literature!  Documentarian filmmakers John Brown and Bert Simonis have made this portion of our American literary history enjoyable, suspenseful, and always instructive for all students of literature and lovers of Mark Twain.",1517788800,,658,5.4950495049504955

8698187,4,B00SDLGBJ2,"The American author Mark Twain (nom-de-plume of Samuel Clemens) is not as well known in Europe as in the United States. Of course English-speaking people know the titles of his most famous works like The adventures of Tom Sawyerand The adventures of Huckleberry Finn, but have they ever read these books ?
Therefor I was very pleased to see the documentary film 88 Days in the motherlode, that John C. Brown and Bert Simonis made about Mark Twains life and about the way he became a famous author. With the help of some very enthousiastic experts - who seem to know Twains life by heart -, with old photographs and even very old pieces of film, with fragments of Twains semi-autobiographical book Roughing it and of his autobiography, they tell the story of his life, from his early years as the newspaper journalist Samuel L. Clemens to his rise of fame as an author and even a kind of stand-up comedian avant la lettre. They mixed all this with some footage of the lovely Californian nature and with beautiful sepia-colored re-enactments, that give the film a wonderful tinge of authenticity.
Because the film is in fact very much more than just the 88 days in the title and because the expression motherlode is probably typical American and  is not very well known in Europe (I had to look it up in a dictionary), I prefer the sub-title Mark Twain finds his voice. Thanks to John C. Brown and Bert Simonis I found Mark Twain again: I am going to re-read Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn and I will try to find a copy of his autobiography.

8698188,5,B00SDLGBJ2,"This documentary, ""88 Days in the Motherlode,"" by John Brown and Bert Simonis tells a terrific tale about one of our nation's most endeared authors, humorists and tall-tale-tellers. This film's greatest virtue is that it helps us clearly understand how, through hardship, luck, pain, suffering, determination, pluck, drunkenness, and mendacity, Samuel Clemens reinvented himself in a brief period of time into who the world came to know and love as Mark Twain. With both a well-researched scholar's eye and a beautiful documentarian style, I was transported in time through the history of Clemens's transformation. What a wonderful biography--they sure don't make 'em like that anymore! Of course, times were very different when, in 1885, Twain created the stories of Tom Sawyer, Becky Thatcher, Huck Finn, and the runaway slave, Jim. We now can view his works through 21st Century eyes and shudder at the stereotypical racial themes he wrote about the antebellum South. But when they were first published, they set American literature on its head--using vernacular that most readers had never heard before. This documentary informs about how Twain grew as a story teller, both verbally on the lecture circuit and in print and his story is just as remarkable as the tales he fabricated. This is a must see!",1425600000,,1306,5.194312796208531
8698189,5,B00SDLGBJ2,"Sam Clemens was the travelingest writer in 19th-century America, and every place he went, it seems, was just then showcasing a new phase of this bursting new nation. Sam watched it, listened to it, got himself involved in it, took notes on it, and eventually melded all the wild far-flung characters and their wilder tall tales into a literature that helped this new America understand and take heart in itself--and helped the world understand America.

 The young documentarians John C. Brown and Bert Simonis get this. They have selected a stretch of 88 days from Sam's most formative period as a writer, his six years as a fugitive from the urbanizing East among the silver mines and saloons and six-gun shooters of the Wild West. Sam was on the lam then, as he so often was in those days--in the company of a good friend wanted by the San Francisco police for his part in a bar-room brawl. He eventually fetched up in a cabin on the muddy, barren slopes of Jackass Hill, where a local yarn-spinner told a tale of a legendary jumping frog stymied by a load of buckshot poured into its gullet. Sam (now sporting his new pen-name Mark Twain) burnished the homespun tale to comic perfection, brought it back East with him, got it published, and, overnight, elevated American vernacular to a literary form.

Using rare vintage photographs, time-present videography, expert scholars with Western pedigrees, and skilled actors who illuminate Mark Twain's rite of literary passage without drowning it in the usual docu-drama cliches, Brown and Simonis have accomplished a minor miracle: they have taken on the most familiar, and analyzed, figure in American letters, and made him fresh again.

Dang it, I just wish I'd interviewed these two before I wrote my own Mark Twain biography. But they were probably still in grade school then!",1425081600,2,1831,4.896774193548387

8698191,5,B00SDLGBJ2,"A very nice piece of work that deftly sorts out the various experiences that Mark Twain had in the West--Virginia City, San Francisco, and especially the Mother Lode. The film lets Mark Twain's words tell the story, with good experts and plausible re-enactments. Anyone interested in Mark Twain should watch it, and it should be standard viewing in California classrooms.  --David Carkeet",1424304000,3,388,5.258064516129032

8698193,5,B00SDLGBJ2,"This film is entertaining and educational at the same time. I didn't realize how much traveling Samuel Clemens did before he became ""Mark Twain"". The use of re-created scenes really adds a new dimension to this documentary. This film goes into Mark Twain's stay in Northern California much further than any other work by other film makers and does so in an attention holding way that leaves a viewer satisfied.
