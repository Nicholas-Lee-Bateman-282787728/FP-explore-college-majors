4495420,4,B004XEEMA8,"I would advise purchasing this collection. Keaton is a comic genius as we all know, and this collection was about 90% of everything I had been trying to piece together. The booklet/extra scenes/essays are really great.

BUT!!!!!

There's a problem (and solution): when you sit down to watch these, make sure you have your television on ""mute"". The scores are absolutely horribly beyond awful! I'm sick of Robert Israel(What is with that obnoxious & sporadic whistle?!! Why?) Comparing the scores to carnival music is an injustice and offense towards carnivals! They don't deserve that kind of degradation.

So here's what you do...Buy it. Watch it. MUTE it! & enjoy the crap out of it. Well worth it.",1313107200,4,700,4.965811965811966
4495421,5,B004XEEMA8,"When we think about Buster Keaton, we think of one of the kings of slapstick comedy during the silent era. The master of physical comedy, a talent known for his deadpan expression and his films, well-revered today as one of the best actors and directors of all time and beloved by many.

With the release of five Blu-rays consisting of Keaton's well-known feature films, the side of Buster Keaton during the silent era that many people may not be familiar with are his silent shorts.

From his older work with Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle (presented in ""The Best Arbuckle Keaton Collection"" featuring shorts from 1917-1919), Keaton was able to learn from Arbuckle, especially how to make his own films and eventually going from a bit player to his partner while working and impressing his producer Joseph M. Schenk.

But by 1920, impressed with his work with Arbuckle and with Keaton starring in his first feature-length film titled ""Saphead "" (1920), Schenk gave Keaton his own production unit ""Buster Keaton Comedies"" and Buster Keaton wanted to show that he can make his own two-reel comedy short films and also become the film's main star and from 1920-1923, the actor would create nearly two dozen short films and would later graduate towards creating feature length films.

Fast forward over 80-years later and the shorts were released by Kino Video as part of their 2005 ""The Art of Buster Keaton"" DVD Boxset and a short two would be included as special features for the feature-film release.

With the success of the Buster Keaton Blu-ray releases, Kino International will now be releasing the shorts as part of a special three-disc Ultimate Edition on Blu-ray.

Included in this set are the following shorts (featuring a spoilerless summary of each short):

DISC 1:

  The ""High Sign"" - (1920, 19 min.) Buster plays a drifter who tries to find work and ends up recruited to protect a man who is planned to be killed and is also recruited by the organization to kill the man.  What will Buster do.  (Note: Although this was the first short produced by Keaton, because he was disappointed in the short, it was shelved.  It was later released in 1921 when Keaton suffered a broken ankle and a new short needed to be released.)
  One Week  - (1920, 24 min.) Buster and his bride (played by Sybil Seely) are newlyweds who have received a ""build-your-own house in a week"" as a wedding gift.
  Convict 13 - (1920, 19 min.) Buster plays golf but at the same time, an escaped inmate (who is to be executed) is wanted by the police.  When Buster accidentally knocks himself out with his golf ball, the inmate switches clothes with Buster and now Buster is thought of as the convict who will be planned for execution.
  The Scarecrow  - (1920, 18 min.) Buster and Joe (Keaton) are farmhands who both want to marry the farmer's daughter (played by Sybil Seely).  Which man will she pick?
  Neighbors - (1921, 19 min.) Buster and the girl across the other building are lovers but their families are feuding.
  The Haunted House - (1921, 20 min., color-tinted) Buster is a bank teller who accidentally is accused for robbing the bank and ends up trying to hide in a haunted house.
  Hard Luck - (1921, 21 min.) Buster tries to kill himself after losing his girlfriend.  (Note: This short has been lost for over 60-years and was in partially reconstructed in 1987.  Unfortunately, the final scene is missing and happens to be a film that Keaton had once said received the loudest laugh ever.)

DISC 2:

  The Goat - (1921, 23 min.) Buster is accidentally mistaken as the criminal ""Dead Shot Dan"".
  The Play House - (1921, 23 min.) Keaton plays the conductor of nine members of a minstrel show.

  Cops - (1922, 18 min.) Keaton plays a young man who accidentally upsets the police by throwing a bomb during a police parade and now he is wanted by them.
  My Wife's Relations - (1922, 17 min.) A large Irish woman falsely accuses Buster of breaking a window.  When they go see a Polish judge who doesn't know English, he mistakes them as a couple wanting to get married.

DISC 3:

  The Blacksmith - (1922, 21 min.) When Buster clowns around in a blacksmith's shop, he and the blacksmith get in a fight resulting in the blacksmith going to jail.  Now Buster must take care of the clients.
  The Frozen North  - (1922, 17 min.) Buster accidentally has mistaken a woman as his wife and that she is having an affair with another man.  Buster shoots them and finds out that the woman is not his wife.  What will he do?
  Day Dreams - (1922, 23 min.) Buster leaves home in order to make some money, so he can get married to his hometown sweetheart.
  The Electric House - (1922, 23 min., color-tinted) Buster graduates with an electrical engineering degree and is hired to wire a new home. (Note: Buster Keaton broke his leg while filming this film and the original version was shelved, this is the second version of the film.)
  The Balloonatic - (1923, 22 min.) Buster plays a man who goes to an amusement park and meets a group of men preparing for a hot air balloon launch.  But the balloon accidentally launches with Buster inside it.
  The Love Nest - (1923, 20 min., color-tinted) Buster leaves on a small boat to escape from his life and his lost love but ends up crashing into a whaling ship.

VIDEO:

""Buster Keaton: The Short Films Collection 1920-1923' is presented in HD.

The shorts are presented in picture box format (black box around image).  For silent film fans, these shorts look the best than they ever had before, especially compared to its DVD counterpart.  Not only are signs much more readable, but I also found certain details such as fabric to other details much more in clarity via Blu-ray.

For those who are selective of picture quality, some shorts do have mild flickering and of course, you are going to see dust and scratches.  But by no means will this hurt your viewing unless you are a bit anal about picture quality.

For ""Buster Keaton: The Short Films Collection 1920-1923', while the original film elements were not pristine to begin with, the picture quality is among the clearest out there for silent shorts.  In fact, these shorts look very good on Blu-ray and I just want to add, much better than its DVD counterpart which wasn't as detailed for certain environments and various scenes.

AUDIO:

""Buster Keaton: The Short Films Collection 1920-1923' features newer and older scores.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Before ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."", ""The General"" and many of Buster Keaton's popular films, there was his famous silent 2-reel shorts.  Shorts that not only showcased his physical comedy but was a precursor of the greatness that Buster Keaton would bring to the big screen.

But I have been asked several times by new silent film fans of whether or not this Blu-ray was worth it.  Can they get into these shorts, especially if his feature films are quite entertaining.

And there is a certain misnomer it appears with those who have just started watching Keaton that his shorts are not as good as his films and I actually disagree with that.  In fact, there are many moments in these shorts where Keaton puts himself through a lot of physical situations that he actually hurt himself pretty badly.  But because he is a perfectionist and expected nothing but the best for himself when performing his style of comedy, these shorts are fun, entertaining and just wonderful to watch.

For example, in the 1920 short ""One Week"", while Buster Keaton showcases his style of physical comedy, falling off houses and going through a variety of situations but yet maintaining that same look on his face, we see Keaton experimenting with leading ladies.  In this case, the beautiful Sybil Seely.  In this same short, we see a hint of sexuality as she is taking a bath and accidentally drops the soap, only to see a hand covering the camera as she goes to pick it up.  You don't see those moments in Keaton films.

Actually, Seely would go on to appear in two more silent shorts with Keaton but because there was too much attention on his female counterpart and the fact that she was the same height as him, Keaton made sure that his next female actress for his silent shorts would not grab much attention.  And also, she would be much shorter than him.

We also see glimpse of various tricks, such as the side of a house falling and Keaton unhurt as the opened window falls on top of him.  While this trick was dangerous, Keaton would go on to make sure he goes bigger in the film ""Steamboat Bill Jr."".  In fact, you can look at these shorts of seeing Keaton's greatness developing, his ability to make things look so easy but knowing that it is in fact quite difficult.  We are just in awe of what he is able to accomplish.

And because the viewer is able to watch all 19-shorts in this 3-disc Ultimate Collection Set, I don't see how anyone can find ""Buster Keaton: The Short Films Collection"" to be anything less than spectacular.

For one, it's presented in HD and sure, the videophile who are used to the latest technology on Blu-ray may be to used to picture quality that is great or next to pristine picture quality, for silent film fans, these shorts look the best than they ever had before, especially compared to its DVD counterpart.  Not only are signs much more readable, but I also found certain details such as fabric to other details much more in clarity via Blu-ray.

But does that mean it's pristine or great?  Of course not because a lot of silent films and shorts were improperly archived.  In fact, one has to remember that the flammable nitrate film, a lot of them were kept in warehouses because studios didn't know what to do with them.  This is before home video and to the studio execs at the time, movies were disposable.  Once one was done, it made its money and it was time to move forward to the next best thing.

And so, possibly 90% or even higher of silent films and shorts are lost or were destroyed in fires or mishandling of the film elements.  A lot of films during the teens and twenties, you can only hope that there is no degradation of the film and that the warping or scratches aren't too bad.

For ""Buster Keaton: The Short Films Collection 1920-1923', while the original film elements were not exactly pristine and scratches and dust can be seen, the picture quality is among the clearest out there for surviving silent shorts.

In fact, these shorts look very good on Blu-ray and I just want to add, much better than its DVD counterpart which wasn't as detailed for certain environments and various scenes.  Things in the background can be see much, much better in HD.

In fact, according to hardcore Keaton fans, they are quite happy that certain missing bits for a few shorts are now included in some of the shorts.  So, that's another plus for this release!

But should one get rid of their ""Art of Buster Keaton"" DVD box set?  I wouldn't.  For one, that is one heck of a box set and two, it's also a set that has an alternate score for not only the feature-length films but also the shorts.  So, hardcore fans of Keaton may still want to hold on to the DVD box set.  Especially for the ""Keaton Plus"" disc!

The contrast of the film is much better and while I can easily say, each short varies in quality, for newer silent film fans, don't worry so much about the PQ because its good.  Not modern pristine but compared to many shorts/films of its time, over 90-years-later, these shorts look very good!

As for the Blu-ray release, I also enjoyed the fact that we get visual essays for each of the films.  This is very informative to those getting into Buster Keaton and you can learn some interesting factoids of each short.  Also, some titles are given the standard and digitally enhanced versions and you can see for yourself, how different things would look if certain things were done a different way via digital enhancing.

Add in a collection of video clips, an eight-page booklet by Jeffrey Vance, author of ""Buster Keaton Remembered"", film location featurettes, character studies and even excerpt from the 1922 film ""Seeing Stars"" with Keaton, Chaplin and a few others, it makes up for one heck of a solid Keaton release on Blu-ray.

Overall, ""Buster Keaton: The Short Films Collection 1920-1923' is not a title to expect perfection in a modern-sense, but what I do expect from Kino International is doing fans of Buster Keaton a great service by bringing his oeuvre to HD but also making sure that newer fans can find these releases quite accessible and learn from it and hopefully, being inspired to watch more silent films.

So, for newbies who have asked me this question if this set is worth it?

Definitely!  If you are interested in Buster Keaton, ""Buster Keaton: The Short Films Collection 1920-1923' is a must buy, must-own Blu-ray release!",1312156800,5,15682,4.747777777777777
4495422,3,B004XEEMA8,"Buster Keaton is great, but the condition of the films is not. I feel that an extensive restoration should been prepared before these films hit blu-ray! Also, the organ music by Ben Model is awful, it sounds like you're at the circus. It stinks. The other music seems hap-hazzard at the best of times too. Keaton is always fun to watch. But the poor quality of the films really shows badly in blu-ray.",1311724800,9,401,4.506849315068493
4495423,5,B004XEEMA8,"I am going to get the negatives out of the way first...yes the footage that has been found over recent years from Hard Luck, Day Dreams, Convict 13 and The Love Nest are not present on this edition. But that aside there is new footage on The Haunted House (When Buster is running away from the cops in the woods and is shot at...there is extra footage here that I have not seen before) and there are some really beautiful-newly presented prints e.g One Week and Cops.

I have the Masters Of Cinema collection of Keatons short films so if I ever fancy having a gander at the final gag at the end of Hard Luck I will do but I get the same, if not more enjoyment out of watching the blu-ray edition.

This set visually is far far far far... better than any set out there the quality of the prints is astonishing, whether the print is from a good source or not, they still look brilliant. The music accompanying the films are brilliant, I really like the new organ scores by Ben Model.

The visual essays and other great extras make this set the ""Ultimate"" Keaton short films set yet, even if it is not the most complete, but like I said, I get just as much enjoyment out of these beautifully presented classics as they are on this set.

Whether you are a Keaton fan or not this is a set that should be had by any comedy or general film/cinema lover and I would give it 10 stars if I could. Simply...WONDERFUL!!! Great job Kino International, keep the Keaton releases coming!!!

Footnote: Just watched Day Dreams, although it is missing the police parade scene that featured on the Masters Of Cinema set. This set contains additional footage not present on any previous release, and there are added stills, again not previously presented which helps make sense of why Buster is running from a massive group of cops and why he appears on the back of a mail van.

Further Footnaote: I have just finished watching all the Keaton blu-ray shorts and I have to stand corrected. I was under the impression that The Love Nest did not feature the footage found and included in the Masters Of Cinema collection. This blu-ray set DOES include the missing footage and more, it has a small segment at the end which I have never seen before. Also there is a screen shot of the Love Nest ship, that I have again not seen featured on any other set. The Love Nest is now the most complete it has ever been. Other than a small segement at the start of Convict 13, the missing footage from Hard Luck that we all know about and the tiny fragment from Day Dreams, this set is as complete as you can get, I still think this is the very best set of Keatons shorts to be released!",1311724800,33,2652,4.347474747474747
4495424,4,B004XEEMA8,"...and if Kino had used the COMPLETE version of ""Hard Luck"" (released on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keaton-Plus/dp/B0002HOEJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keaton Plus</a>) and hired Ben Model to score the entire collection (doing away with Robert Israel's horrible scores from the mid-90s), then I would have.",1311206400,,355,7.9
4495425,5,B004XEEMA8,"Five stars for Buster Keaton's shorts presented together in one 3-DVD set and in chronological order. It's nice to have a quick reference to Buster's shorts as the Art of Buster Keaton scattered the films over 10 DVDs so that you could not just pop in a DVD and watch the shorts in succession. However, Kino does leave a bit to be desired as you're led to believe that there is no available ending to Hard Luck. The Art of Buster Keaton, ""Keaton Plus"" DVD includes the ending of Hard Luck (explained in Mr. Mular's review). I had hoped that films like The Electric House, Day Dreams and Convict 13 would be improved, but no improvements to these films, although the enhanced films are nice. Everything here, other than the ""visual essays"" is available on The Art of Buster Keaton (shorts), Industrial Strength Keaton (Seeing Stars, Character Studies) and Lost Keaton (Why They Call Him Buster). The new material here, the visual essays, gives interesting details of the films and many of the other actors. The musical scores are appropriate (no Alloy Orchestra). Based on memory, some musical scores are the same as the Art of BK while a few others are different. For those who buy everything Keaton, this set is worth having despite duplicating much of what you already have!",1310947200,26,1276,4.752252252252252

***original review***

The films = *****
The Blu-ray Disc = ****

First off- this is grade A+ Keaton material here. If there is just one Buster Keaton set you want to get, this is it! The king of physical technical humor is at his prime here, and houses are one of his main characters in many of these movies.

Kino claims ""Newly Mastered in HD from 35mm archival elements"" and four titles have been digitally enhanced, but the enhancement didn't go far enough in restoration. In THE BOAT you still see frame shifts (a basic video stabilization process would fix this), contrast flicker and nitrate deterioration. Kino does make the statement that too much restoration alters the original film too much. CONVICT 13 appears to be 50% 16mm film source.

With that said, i decided to cue up the old ART OF BUSTER KEATON DVD set from Kino to do a true comparison to this Blu-ray release and not rely on my memory. The first thing I noticed was how much softer the old DVDs were to this Blu-ray disc, the last time I had seen them was on an older CRT television. While they looked good then, comparing the DVDs now using a Blu-ray player to up-convert them to 1080p on a HD LCD TV they did not look as good.  Window-boxing was common on the old DVDs because Kino assumed they would be seen on CRT TVs that often over-scan.  Now the Blu-ray presents these in full frame as most HD TVs don't over-scan.  IMPROVEMENT?  YES!

The biggest improvement is with the short ""COPS"", which was ""enhanced"", this Blu-ray presentation is razor-sharp!  To compare the quality, just try and read the sign on the front porch of the Police Officer's new house where he is waiting for Buster to arrive with the furniture.  On the old soft DVD the sign is pretty much just a white square with possibly some lettering in it, on this new film transfer the letters are crystal clear and easy to read.  The entire short is improved this much! One strange sequence in the new presentation of COPS is during the police parade scene, what might be stock footage of a police parade is presented here in LETTERBOX format!  I compared these shots to the old DVDs, cued up on two machines to switch back & forth, the old DVDs have these shots in full frame but nothing is really missing in either version. The aspect ratio is just different, in some shots the old DVD looks squeezed while other shots the Blu-ray looks squished. None of these shots includes Buster Keaton, it is just marching policemen.  I found no explanation from Kino about this change in aspect ratio.

I carefully checked THE BOAT as it is one of the ""enhanced"" presentations. The Nitrate Deterioration is still there, but the original DVD has film scratches that were cleaned with DNR. For those opposed to DNR processing, Kino has also included the original un-enhanced version in HD so that you can see the scratches and any small details that the DNR may have removed.  Again, more improvements.

Other shorts I compared that did not get an ""enhancement"" from Kino obviously did not need it as they look great, much better than the old DVDs.

Some exceptions to this are on disc #1: CONVICT 13 seems to exist in only 3rd or 4th generation prints. The picture is grainy & the faces are washed out. The first 9 minutes & the last minute of CONVICT 13 appears to be from a 16mm print where the blacks are crushed (loss of details in dark areas) and the focus is softer.  HARD LUCK is restored from many different prints of varying quality, and the last scene is missing (even though Kino included it on the KEATON PLUS DVD). However, we are lucky to have this film at all. One shot of Buster trying to get on a horse is presented in Letterbox here, I wonder what the framing problem was to require this masking.  Maybe Kino had to stabilize the shot so much that the frame lines shifted up & down in a distracting manor.

On disc #3 DAY DREAMS, reported to be a three-reeler but exists only as two reels, is grainier than usual & missing some opening shots, the ""Dream Sequences"" and judge scene just before the cop chase, stills illustrate these. The contrast is also increased indicating possibly a 3rd generation print was used. THE ELECTRIC HOUSE also looks this way, and the print has more wear as well as missing some opening & middle scenes (described in text). At 23 minutes i don't think much is missing, but some missing key plot devices had to be explained.

Disc 1:
THE HIGH SIGN (1920) 19 min
THE HIGH SIGN (enhanced) (1920) 19 min - The first produced Buster solo short about him protecting a business man from murderous extortionists. Buster shelved this, delaying its release, possibly because it resembled his Arbuckle teamed shorts.
ONE WEEK (1920) 24 min - The second produced, but released as his premier solo short. Buster builds his do-it-yourself dream-house! A true CLASSIC!
CONVICT 13  (1920) 18 min (half 16mm & half 35mm, 3rd generation quality) - Buster is an inept prison guard.
THE SCARECROW (1920) 18 min - While produced after One Week, this tells the story of how Buster get the girl he married.
NEIGHBORS  (1921) 19 min - The first appearance of Buster's real dad Joe, portraying Buster's on-screen father. Watch for the acrobatic team ""The Flying Elephants"".
THE HAUNTED HOUSE (1921) 20 min (Tinted) - The mob is haunting a house to keep outsiders away, but Buster just can't understand what is going on.
HARD LUCK (1921) 21 min (mix of 16mm & 35mm, last scene missing & shown with a production still, even though it is complete on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keaton-Plus/dp/B0002HOEJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keaton Plus</a>&nbsp;DVD also released by Kino!)

Disc 2
THE GOAT (1921) 23min - A case of mistaken identity, Wanted Posters of Dead Shot Dan have Buster's face on them!
THE PLAY HOUSE (1921) 23 min - Buster is very where in the theater, playing almost all of the roles at one time.
THE BOAT (1921) 23 min (nitrate deterioration)
THE BOAT (enhanced) (1921) 23 min (nitrate deterioration) - Buster takes his family on a boat outing, considered one of his best shorts.
THE PALEFACE (1922) 20 min - Buster is a traveling salesman in indian territory, and he likes the women.
COPS (1922) 18 min
COPS (enhanced) (1922) 18 min - Through a series of misunderstandings Buster thinks he bought a horse & wagon & the Police Chief thinks Buster is the moving company wagon.
MY WIFE'S RELATIONS (1922) 17min - Thought to be produced as Buster's reflection on his failed marriage st the time.

Disc 3
THE BLACKSMITH (1922) 21 min (some nitrate deterioration) Watch Buster destroy a vintage Rolls Royce, not a popular gag at the time with audiences.
THE FORZEN NORTH (1922) 17 min (more than usual wear in original print) A very dark comedy as Buster spoofs William S. Hart as a killer cowboy. Hart hated this film.
DAY DREAMS (1922) 23 min (Reported to be a 3-reeler, only 2 reels exist. Opening footage,some brief day dream sequences & judge scene missing, shown with a still, grainier that usual)
THE ELECTRIC HOUSE (1922) 23 min (Tinted - opening & middle footage missing) Buster modernizes a house.
THE BALOONATIC (1923) 22 min
THE BALOONATIC (enhanced) (1923) 22 min - oddly titled short as most of it takes place in a canoe on a river.
THE LOVE NEST (1923) 20 min  (Tinted- the beginning & end scenes seem way too abrupt & it is believed more was shot but disintegrated.) This has to be the most morbit & dark comedy that Buster produced since The Frozen North, death at sea is the basis of some of the humor.

BONUS MATERIAL:
SEEING STARS (excerpts) (1922) featuring cameos by Keaton, Charlie Chaplin & others.
CHARACTER STUDIES (1922) gag film starring Carter DeHaven with cameos by Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle & others.
A series of brief alternate/deleted shots from THE GOAT / THE BLACKSMITH / THE BALOONATIC. (Gee, at one time Buster thought his films were lost, now we even have alternate takes surviving!)
4 visual essays  on the films locations by Silent Echo's author John Benglson
15 visual essays using clips & stills, written by Keaton historians.
A collection of clips from films influenced by Keaton's work (no big deal here).

Hello Baby! (1925) Charley Chase
White Wings (1923) Stan Laurel

There is also a little booklet with descriptions of each film.

Some Keaton historians suggest watching these three shorts in this order to make a feature length movie:
THE SCARECROW
ONE WEEK
THE BOAT
Try it, you will be surprised! A 1949 Life magazine article suggests that these could be strung together, maybe even re-made as a sound feature. That never happened.

Final thought: I used to cherish the old ART OF BUSTER KEATON DVD set from Kino, but now it just looks like an old VHS tape compared to these new Hi-Definition transfers. It is nice to have the shorts collected together in chronological order. I always had trouble remembering which Keaton DVD feature the shorts were included on, and the old DVD menus were painful to get through to the shorts. Now the menus make it easy to cue up to what you want to see.  However, I wish Kino did not use the word ""Ultimate"" for a set that has a few sub-standard prints as masters. We may never find a better master for these, but to me ""Ultimate"" would  mean every short is in pristine condition with no need for an upgrade.

I was informed by Kino that they no longer have access to, nor the rights to, the missing footage used in the ""Keaton Plus"" DVD that they had released. That is why HARD LUCK is missing the ending, it is not lost.",1308873600,145,10699,4.785016286644951

In ""The Playhouse"" he has a dream where he walks into a theater and sees himself as every person there, including a little boy with a lolly pop and a bejeweled matron in the audience. His take on each character is spot on and completely hilarious. And later in the story he plays the orangutan tormenting his trainer and appearing amazingly apelike.
He was a brilliant filmmaker and included an incredible amount of detail in every aspect of his work. And he also knew when to keep it simple. The flashes of dialogue are kept to a bare minimum which makes it all the more amazing!

I am choosing to overlook the missing footage in the one short because the earlier version was not available to Kino.  I am satisfied that it would have been here if it was at all possible.  Shame on the owners of that version for not allowing it to be here.
What I am also applauding here is the fact that the shorts are finally in one place and in chronological order.  I can now throw out my copy that I had made from the earlier Kino DVDs.
I am one of those who consider Chaplin as being #2 with Keaton ruling the roost of silent film comedians so this is, indeed a monumental set in every way.",1405296000,,703,4.139705882352941

I am continually amazed at Keaton's athletic ability and some of the stunts he pulled off (before the era of special effects) and being able to do them with a complete deadpan expression.  There are also some very subtle sight gags worked into the stories which surprised me.  If you go to the movies to see things blown up and people killed by the hundreds, then you will probably find these films boring and dated, but if you like silent slapstick style comedy (at least in my opinion) the collection is well worth the money.",1401494400,2,607,4.353982300884955

4495451,5,B004XEEMA8,"I don't think it's possible for someone to be a true film buff and not appreciate the impact Buster Keaton made on the art of screen comedy. The ingenious gags, daring stunts, and technical virtuosity with which Keaton embellished his films often surpasses the work of his two biggest rivals, Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd.

Kino's three-disc set of all nineteen two-reel comedies Keaton made between 1920-1923 is required viewing for all classic film enthusiasts. Re-mastered in HD from 35mm archival sources, these very funny shorts represent the full range of Keaton's comedic style, and include themes, situations, and props he would expand upon in his feature films. Although not exactly pristine, this collection still boasts the finest quality available on most of these popular titles. There are some with extensive wear, such as splice jumps, missing footage, and nitrate decomposition. For a few select films, Kino opted to include digitally cleaned up versions along with the raw originals. I have my reservations about DNR as it compromises the integrity of the image, and some of the damage was apparently beyond even digital repair.

The excellent musical accompaniment is by the likes of Robert Israel, Bill Model, and the Mont Alto Orchestra. Special features include fifteen visual essays by various Keaton historians, a series of alternate/deleted shots, a collection of clips from comedies influenced by Keaton, an eight-page booklet, four visual essays on the locations Keaton used, and two films featuring cameos by Keaton and many other silent comedians.

As far as a complete collection of Keaton's brilliant two-reelers goes, this edition is unsurpassed and should occupy pride of place in any film lover's home video collection.

I wish there was a more fully developed write-up for each film, but the short paragraphs are nice to provide context for each films.  The films themselves are fantastic.

The features list ""brief alternate/deleted shots"" from three films. So you'd think that if you buy this collection, you really do have the ultimate collection of Buster Keaton short films.

You'd be wrong.

It took me fully two days to stop being absolutely furious that even though Kino includes the most complete current copy of ""Hard Luck"" (think of it as Hard Luck 2.0) in the ""Keaton Plus"" collection, the version of ""Hard Luck"" on this ""ultimate"" set is the old Hard Luck 1.0, missing not just chunks from early scenes but missing the entire ending. Worse yet, it *includes* an obsolete statement that the ending is lost and that only a single still photo remains.

I had expected better from Kino.

Once I got passed being outraged that I hadn't been sold what I was promised, I was able to watch and enjoy the content. It's handy to have the entire collection in chronological order, and the supplemental materials are very nice. I would have been quite pleased with the content had I been told up-front what to expect, and had I not been led to believe that I'd have a full and up-to-date library of the Keaton shorts in one convenient location.

4495466,2,B004XEEMA8,"I won't speak here about the films in themselves, which are OF COURSE WONDERFUL and deserve as much stars as can be given.

Nor would I speak about the music, as many other reviewers do.

I'll just speak about the prints.

Kino calls this set ULTIMATE, which is an insult to the fan, as TWO of the films here are presented in severely cut and damaged prints, while BOTH exist in not pristine but MUCH MORE COMPLETE and WATCHABLE restorations somewhere else.

The first short I'm referring to is CONVICT 13, which appears in the Kino set with a severely fragmented beginning, many missing shots in the middle, and a nearly unwatchable ending sequence. To call this ultimate is outrageous while a vastly superior restoration with the beginning intact, nearly all of the missing middle sequences, and the ending taken from a much sharper print has already been issued on DVD. It`s on the 2001 Arte Video French set BUSTER KEATON ""L'Integrale des courts-metrages"". Ten years have elapsed from that issue. So it's unforgivable that this print wasn't requested. The set is still available on Amazon France:

[...]

The second is, of course, HARD LUCK. The print shown here is the first restoration presented. But since then, much better prints have appeared and a new restoration, much much better than the original one, was included by Kino on its BUSTER KEATON PLUS DVD. It's also on the aforementioned French set. That restoration's improvement doesn't limit to the added ending gag. It has better image quality all throughout, and fills most of the gaps from the original restoration, which is missing footage on plenty of places.

There is a newly discovered (albeit not very important) shot at the ending of DAY DREAMS, but the version on this set doesn't incorporate the police parade sequence which was shown out of place on BUSTER KEATON PLUS. It does, however, add a couple of stills, but I'm not really sure about how right Kino is in putting two of them in between the film. One is a still showing Keaton in front of a judge, and is placed right before the climactic scene on which Buster is running from dozens of cops. The other is placed very near the end and has Keaton literally sending himself to his girl at the mail office. When watching the last still, you'll notice Buster is not hurt at all. But when he arrives to the girl's home in the trunk, he has a brown eye, among other things. It could have happened to him during the trip, but maybe both stills are not from missing but from deleted scenes. I say this because of that possible continuity mistake I mention, and because the big chase seems to me much more climactic and appropriate than a judge scene to follow the shot of the girl dreaming of Buster.
The sequence of Keaton playing a Roman in the theater is improved here using better footage (but that was already like this on the French set).
In any case, the hospital and bank dream sequences (which were surely very short and are showcased with stills) are still missing (and hopefully they will turn up someday), the already found police parade sequence is not inserted here, and the actual ending is still missing. Keaton wouldn't have ended the short that way.

THE LOVE NEST presents here the most complete print I've ever seen, adding the PORT sequence which had been shown separately on BUSTER KEATON PLUS (but is also to be found in its proper place on the French set, although the title card wasn't properly translated (from the print's original Frech title card) and the gag is thus impossible to understand. On the KINO set we do have a previously unkwnown (although, again, not very important) two-second shot of Buster at the very end of the film (absent from the French set). But, as in all known prints so far, the ending is missing. We hope it will be found somewhen.

As for the rest, the prints are all the same as on EVERY previous issue of these shorts. THE ELECTRIC HOUSE has some added explanation title cards explaining missing (and possibly missing) sequences, but not a single new frame is added and the print has all the same old gaps. The same is to be said about THE FROZEN NORTH.  The rest of the films had no gaps whatsoever, and are also fine here.

Some shorts are presented here in digitally enhanced versions. Frankly, I dont't give a lot for the change.

The SPECIAL FEATURES are OK, although they are in no way essential.

I don't say the set is BAD, but to call it ULTIMATE is an insult. It lacks material that has been around for a decade by now. I undestand KINO may have not the rights for the fine restorations of CONVICT 13 or HARD LUCK, or for the missing known footage from DAY DREAMS. But if you are not planning to, or can't arrange to use them, THEN YOU CAN'T CALL THE SET ""ULTIMATE"" AT ALL.

It's like putting on the market an old METROPOLIS restoration without the recently found 25 minutes and call it ULTIMATE.

You cannot still open HARD LUCK with the title card saying that the ending gag might be lost for ever WHEN EVERY KEATON FAN HAS ALREADY SEEN IT MANY YEARS AGO BY NOW.

KINO is a respected and specialized company, and certainly not a newcomer, so they shouldn't do these kind of things.",1324080000,36,5177,4.586580086580087

4495469,5,B004XEEMA8,"Black and white movies put me at ease. Often, I don't much follow the plot, rather it is the image of long gone sets and archaic musical scores that serve to amuse. I carry a completely unsupported notion that every movie made in 1948 is good, or at least worth watching. Other fans of the era are taken with the stars, Gable, Grable and Grant to Hope, Hepburn and Hayworth. They certainly have their charm, but it is the image of the saloon they occupy, or streetcar in the background that holds my interest

To take this fascination with framework of film further, one can reach back to the silent era. In these pictures people wear the fashions and drive the cars of our grandparents youth. Since the technology to synchronize sound with image did not exist, directors and actors had to use melodramatic expression and grand gesture to tell a story or get a laugh. One of the masters of the laugh was Buster Keaton, You may remember him, as he was never really forgotten during his lifetime, and worked in film until his death at 70. In 1965, bright and bubbly Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello were the featured stars of ""Beach Blanket Bingo"". The guy who ran the club where they held their fictional shindigs was 69-year-old Buster Keaton.

When Buster was about Frankie and Annette's age, he was making silent comedic shorts with his mentor Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle. Buster was Fatty's sidekick through a series of slapstick short films made from 1917-19. This was no bit part, Fatty was the first film actor to make a million dollars a year. Buster and Fatty amused audiences with elaborate pratfalls, emphasized by Buster's endlessly deadpan expression.

Buster moved on to direct his own series of shorts beginning in 1920. His comedic expression featured elaborate mechanical devices melded with spectacularly athletic acrobatics. In the ""High Sign"", the final scene features a cross section view showing a home equipped with a series of trap doors and hinged walls that enable Buster to elude an octuplet of villains and win the heart of a winsome woman. In ""Neighbors"" Buster elopes with his tenement neighbor by seamlessly moving from building to building by stepping from the window of the third floor, and alighting on the shoulders of the fellow emerging from the second floor, who is supported by the fellow who has emerged from the first floor. It is an almost unbelievable choreography of stunt unequaled to this day.

Buster uproariously trips, stumbles, runs into walls, and falls into swimming pools in film after film. But it is his endlessly deadpan expression that is endearing. No matter what travail life tosses across his path, after a sigh or a raised eyebrow he is ready to surmount the next obstacle. Watch the table scene in ""My Wife's Relations"". Buster cannot grab a bite during a meal with his cloddish brothers in law forking slabs of meat, clawing salt and peppershakers and passing plate after plate. There are no handstands, back flips or other overt gags, just the nuance of his face tells the story and gets the laugh.

If you get the laugh, move onto his feature length films of the mid to late twenties. ""The General"" is widely regarded as his best. Some, such as iconic actor/director Orson Welles, regard it as one of the best films ever made, period. ""Steamboat Bill"" also includes stunts and images that are recognizable. Significantly, where the faade of a house falls on Buster, who miraculously happens to be standing where an open window saves him from being flattened. But, to me, these films, can be an hour set up for twenty minutes of non-stop gags. The shorts films are non-stop gags that, using an expression with its roots in silent film comedy, cut right to the chase.",1320537600,2,3729,4.802180685358255
4495470,5,B004XEEMA8,"Wow! What a treat! About six years after the successful release of the formidable DVD collection ""The Art of Buster Keaton,"" where KINO International featured some of the best early movies of the late, great comedian, they return with the equally awesome ""Buster Keaton - The Short Films Collection 1920-1923.""

Joseph Francis Keaton Jr., presumably nicknamed ""Buster"" by the famous magician Harry Houdini, was Fatty Arbuckle's disciple early in his career. In 1920, producer Joe Schenck - Buster's father in law - moved Arbuckle from shorts to feature films, allowing Keaton to make his own shorts. The result was nineteen delicious comedy shorts included in the magnificent ""Buster Keaton - The Short Films Collection 1920-1923."" These shorts were filmed in the studio were Charlie Chaplin made some of his legendary shorts, too.

The Blu-ray version of this historic collection features three discs, which, in addition to the nineteen shorts, also includes fifteen visual essays, where we get information about the action behind the scenes of some of the shorts; brief alternate/deleted shots from some of the shorts; a collection of clips from slapstick films that influenced Keaton; a booklet with information about the collection; visual essays about some of the film locations; and much more! A true delight for Keaton fans and film historians.

The shorts are arranged in chronological order, opening with 1920's ""The `High Sign',"" in which Keaton plays ""a man that came from nowhere, he wasn't going anywhere, and got kicked off somewhere,"" which the comic didn't care for too much, because it still had some of Arbuckle's elements on it. He shelved the film for some time, and then made ""One Week"" (1920), which has been described as Keaton's first masterpiece, and established him as a comedian. It has been said that all other of Keaton's comedy shorts ""shall be measured against it."" However, I mostly enjoyed ""The Scarecrow"" (1920), which has an incredible, visionary production design, where Keaton and a friend share a home, in which everything is automated; ""Convict 13"" (1920), which tells us that ""golf is the game that brings out the beast in men,"" where Keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict; ""The Goat"" (1921), in which Keaton is mistaken for a gangster; ""The Paleface"" (1922), in which Keaton plays a naturalist who involuntarily gets involved in a fight where oil sharks want to steal Indian land; ""My Wife Relations"" (1922), where Keaton accidentally marries a woman who lives with a big, tough family; and ""The Play House"" (1921), a masterpiece, in which Keaton plays a custodian in a theater. In this short, the comic plays several characters at the same time, using special effects that were ahead of its time - totally amazing.

""Buster Keaton - The Short Films Collection 1920-1923"" is marvelous not only because of its funny content, but also because it shows the mind of a comic genius, one with extraordinary ability in physical comedy. He was a master in using gadgets as well as a more efficient use of cameras. In the booklet that comes with the collection, we learn that Keaton, if he had not become an actor, would have been a civil engineer. In these shorts, with all the production designs and special effects, we get evidence that he would have been a great one, indeed.

I have to say that, for some reason, I enjoy the short films much more than the feature ones, not only those of Keaton, but also those of other comedians of the silent era, including Chaplin. Buster Keaton, also known as Great Stone Face, left a grandiose legacy, some which sadly disappeared with time. Of particular interest to this writer, was watching the footage of Los Angeles from yesteryear, some locations still easy to find. For this reason and more, ""Buster Keaton - The Short Films Collection 1920-1923"" is a must for present and future generations. Thanks, KINO, for another important piece of our history. The shorts last from 17 min to 24 min and all of them are in black and white, with the exception of ""The Love Nest"" (1923), which is color-tinted.

4495471,3,B004XEEMA8,"I wish that I could give this 5 stars, but I can't. Too many of the films are in poor condition and require major restoration, which Kino is apparently unwilling to undertake. It's rather disingenuous of them to be offering this ""remastered"" set on Blu-ray when the source material so obviously needs help. A Harold Lloyd collection was recently released, fully restored. Buster Keaton is arguably a more important figure in silent film comedy and deserves at least equal treatment. Bad on Kino for not doing so.",1318723200,13,512,4.896551724137931
4495472,5,B004XEEMA8,"This is long overdue. The great Stone Face getting the quality DVD treatment he so richly deserves. All of the great Buster Keaton short film classic like ""Cops"", ""Palceface"", ""The Goat"", ""His Wife's Relations"", ""The Boat"" and others have been given new life and have never looked better. Personally, I would have loved to seen all of the films in this set been digitally remastered, but the ones that are like ""Cops"" have the look of a current new release. One of the more interesting aspects in the Special Features is to see clips from other comics tried to imitate Keaton including the great Stan Laurel. Still, there will be only one Buster Keaton and this is a must for all films fans of all ages.",1317081600,,703,4.587301587301587
4495473,4,B004XEEMA8,"This latest packaging of Buster Keaton's starring short subjects is generally superior to previous collections, including those from Kino. It wasn't that long ago that film scholars were lamenting the close of the century, when all silent era rediscoveries would surely come to an end due to nitrate cellulose's self-destruction. Thanks to a variety of circumstances (and collectors), the situation hasn't been all-out dire, and new discoveries and restorations are still being made, as witness this collection as well as Kino's ongoing ""ultimate"" editions of the Keaton features. But this good fortune hasn't prevented Kino from coming into conflict with itself.

Overall, the majority of these short subjects are in the best visual conditionsthey've ever been in, with a few exceptions. ""The Electric House"" remains in bad shape; ""The Love Nest"" and ""Daydreams"" still lack footage, and nitrate hypo-ing still mars the launch of Buster's ""Damfino"" in ""The Boat."" But the majority of the shorts never looked better, and some, like ""Convict 13,"" are more complete than they were in the original ""Art of Buster Keaton"" set.

So what are we to make of the decision to present ""Hard Luck"" in its patchy and incomplete form rather than in the still incomplete but much repaired and improved version found on Kino's ""Keaton Plus?"" The supplemental material suggests that this is intended as a tribute to Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, who presented this particular restoration in 1987. Okay, but since Kino isn't shy about presenting both standard and digitally enhanced versions of certain titles, even while downplaying the quality of the enhanced versons, why couldn't they also have presented the Brownlow/Gill ""Hard Luck"" side-by-side with the improved print? I suspect that Kino was attempting not to undercut sales of ""Keaton Plus,"" even while that title and the ""Art of Buster Keaton"" titles disappear in the wake of the ""ultimate"" editions. This conjures-up visions of yet another boxed collection with a ""bonus"" disc of rarities added to prompt another round of re-buying; I hope this won't be the case.

Otherwise, this set is something we could only have dreamed about a few decades back. Several of the musical scores are new. One is an archaic relic from the heyday of Raymond Rohauer's reissues; most of the others are new accompaniments by Ben Model and Robert Israel. I must agree with some of the other reviewers on one point: the Fotoplayer scores are a bit much in this format. I live within commuting distance of a functional Cremona Fotoplayer and I enjoy its sound, but for these comedies, the instrument is inadequate, producing more cacophony than audio enhancement. The visual essays and outtakes are all of interest, and the thin booklet is a useful guide to the contents.

This is probably the definitive Keaton short subject collection, at least for the time being. But with so much going for it, it's frustrating to see it come up short of the perfection due its subject.",1315526400,7,2995,5.08130081300813
4495474,5,B004XEEMA8,"I've enjoyed Buster Keaton's ""The General"" for many years -- especially with the sublime Carl Davis score, and I've long wanted to see good copies of his earlier short films, with scores that don't annoy.  I'm pleased with Kino's collection of Keaton's short silents.  The picture quality is quite good, especially the digitally restored copies that are offered as options on certain titles, but really in general, especially considering that these films are 90 years old.  I've not seen them all yet, but so far I'm very pleased with the video quality and with the music scoring.  The price is quite reasonable for a Kino release.",1313971200,,631,4.9245283018867925
4495475,4,B004XEEMA8,"This is a GREAT compilation of movies.  I am not interested in collecting all Keaton's feature-length films, but I very much wanted to see all his shorts.  Well, here they are, and sharper and clearer than ever in Blu-Ray!  The images of the films are GREATLY improved over previous iterations.  Nevertheless, four stars, not five, because Kino did not use the restored version of ""Hard Luck"", because they did not visually ""enhance"" ALL the films (all of which desperately need the scratch-removal treatment); and because they hired Ben Model to compose the new music.

It's interesting to read the wildly differing opinions about the music for the movies on this DVD release.  Some people love it, some people hate it.  Personally, I like silent movies with up-tempo music and sound effects, so I like the Robert Israel soundtracks.  I especially like his music for ""The Goat"", which I've watched three times already.  If you want to know why some of Israel's music sounds so over-the-top, almost like a Spike Jones performance, do a web search for ""American fotoplayer joe rinaudo"" and you'll see what Israel is playing on for some of the films.  It's actually an authentic way to set sound to silent movies.

I have more trouble with Ben Model's music.  His accompaniments are not really bad, just undernourished.  Often dull and unimaginative, he usually makes no musical comment on the comic actions.  He actually explains this in one of the short documentaries: he studied under Lee Erwin, and their idea was to set a flow behind the film and NOT to precisely synchronize sound to image.  This explains everything.  Lee Erwin's soundtracks can be heard on some of the Harry Langdon movies, and as an alternative soundtrack to Kino's release of ""The General"", and they are quite cold and dour, and out of sync with the picture in spirit and often literally.

I can understand why Kino wanted to re-record the organ scores.  The original organ music, played by Gaylord Carter, and still found on older Kino DVDs of these movies, was very poorly recorded.  Carter liked using a lot of high-pitch chords with a lot of vibrato, and this creates a somewhat harsh effect to begin with.  Add to this a thin-sounding recording with WOW, and the sound tracks to ""One Week"" and ""Cops"" can be brutal on the ears unless you turn down the treble and volume a little.  On the other hand, Carter's music-making is exemplary; he makes many a wry comment on the humour through his accompaniment.  For instance, in ""Cops"", you actually hear Keaton call up the horse and talk to him over the telephone.  It's very funny.  The new recordings by Ben Model sound sumptuous: full-bodied and rich, but he pretty much misses all the possibilities of enhancing the comedy, either by NOT musically commenting in any way on the action at hand, or under-playing it so there is little effect.  Keaton's movies have a lot of deliberate cartoonish action, so I am inclined toward accompaniments that accent this characteristic; therefore, I prefer Gaylord Carter over Ben Model, Timothy Brock over Carl Davis, and Robert Israel over Lee Erwin.

Fortunately, and in spite of some miscalculations, Model does some of the best work I've heard from him for these films.  His piano accompaniment to ""The High Sign"" is a particularly fine job, and an exception to his general rule of not making musical comments on the action.  An excellent accompaniment.  On the other hand, I just saw ""One Week"" at the Stanford Theatre, accompanied by Dennis James at the organ.  Compared to James' organwork, Model's score for this film seems stillborn.  He is particularly out of step with the tempo of the film at the beginning, where he plays very slowly.  Most disappointing is the lack of drama during the train sequence, and the overwhelming surprise climax is given little emphasis.

With image as good as you'll probably ever see for these films, a complete and chronological collection of ALL Keaton's shorts, and musical accompaniment ranging from brilliantly ""Fractured Flickers"" to adequate, I highly recommend buying this set.",1313366400,8,4094,4.921282798833819

8446878,4,B004XEEMA8,"Again, I had already bought the whole Keaton set on dvd and laser, and staunchly avoided re-purchasing them on blu ray at an outrageous price.  But all of the items have appeared singly, and I have been able to pick some of them up, while they were being remaindered.  The improvements are sometimes strong, but sometimes it's the scratches that have been upgraded rather than the actual images. There are sometimes extras galore on these new discs.  This one varies in picture quality, but there is a definite improvement. I am a huge Keaton fan, so I couldn't go wrong.  This has been reissued in a new package which includes the Arbuckle titles.  I have those on dvd, so I wasn't all that thrilled with blu ray 'improvement' with stuff from the teens.  Good price, here, but that's the only way I would consider  re-buying any of this material.",1494806400,,847,4.644295302013423

Now equipped with the resources and budgets to fully realize his cinematic ideas, one begins to see how Keaton had begun to evolve not only into one of the greatest cinema comedians, but one of the great filmmakers of the early 20th century.  In many ways, he yet to be equaled, and that's on display here.

Some of the transfers are very good indeed, others a little the worse for wear due mainly to the condition of the originals, which is saying a lot, since many were nearly lost altogether.  But better than you'll see elsewhere. Kudos to Kino.",1477699200,,650,4.577586206896552
