8560288,5,B00B0FRR00,"I think this shows Cat at his best! He gives a strong performance and his voice has the inflections that make him special. The 2 musicians he has performing with him really add another dimension to the show ( although I feel bad for the guitarist as Cat stops several times in the middle of a song so that the other guitar player can get into proper tune.) The audience is interesting to look at as well. And while the logos are a bit odd and the video quality is not top notch, I think kind of adds to the charm!",1455148800,,513,4.089108910891089
8560289,4,B00B0FRR00,Very good ,1428451200,,10,4.0
8560290,3,B00B0FRR00,"video quality is ok, not great.  Also, these are much quieter productions than his earlier work.  Mostly just Cat Stevens and two other musicians.  Good music though. And audience is interesting to watch. Takes one back in time. (Did we really dress like that?)",1422921600,,261,4.886363636363637
8560291,5,B00B0FRR00,"As a fan of cat Stevens, this documentary brings cat to life, barely gave interviews this is a must for cat Stevens fans",1419465600,,120,4.260869565217392
8560292,4,B00B0FRR00,"I knew I wasn't getting a documentary so I wasn't disappointed but it may shock some one looking for information and interviews.
The concert is good except (like everyone else said) for the giant logos in the corners.

The picture isn't that clear.  The audio is great.

This really is Cat at his best and should be purchased by any Cat/Yusuf fans.",1408838400,2,348,4.580645161290323
8560293,5,B00B0FRR00,Great selection of songs good video quality and sound quality yes it is dumb that the two logos stay on in the upper left and lower right corners but still a great collection of early Cat classics,1384214400,,196,4.324324324324325
8560294,5,B00B0FRR00,"This DVD is a concert film, it is not a documentary.  I was satisfied with the audio and video quality.  The logos on the corners of the screen could have been left out.  This DVD contains live versions of I Love My Dog, Bitter Blue, and How Can I Tell You which do not appear on his other concert films.  All Cat Steven fans should buy this DVD.",1376784000,7,346,4.044117647058823
8560295,2,B00B0FRR00,"Completely agree with previous review about the annoying logos and poor video quality. Also would add that this is a compilation of concert footage with no life story, interviews, or narrative that are typical of a ""documentary"" as this DVD is billed. Cat Stevens and his music is the only redeeming quality of this DVD.",1371427200,8,320,4.836363636363636
8560296,3,B00B0FRR00,"The 1971 BBC TV program is wonderful, great music and performances, and anyone who loved Cat Stevens' music around 1970-1973 will really enjoy hearing and seeing these films.

But, what they will NOT enjoy is the poor video quality, plus there are not one but two logos that are permanently on screen and annoying during the entire running time of the DVD. One at the top left says ""LIVE"". How stupid can the producers be to put something like than over the film? The other logo on the lower right is the company logo. And these are not small areas on screen either, they are huge. If the company thinks pushing their company logo at the consumer while viewing the films is a good promotional idea, they're fools. I don't buy a DVD to have the company logo staring me in the face during the whole program.

The video quality is also acceptable but looks washed out. You can view the BBC performance on Youtube and the quality there is excellent compared to this DVD.

Unless you're a Cat Stevens fanatic and have to buy this DVD, I'd recommend avoiding it completely and going to Youtube or elsewhere to view these performances in better quality and without the two on-screen logos.

5 stars for the music and performances by a great entertainer, Zero stars for the DVD quality and onscreen logos.

Unless you absolutely have to buy this DVD because you cannot download the performance from Youtube, avoid it for the above reasons.",1367539200,24,1431,4.640316205533597
