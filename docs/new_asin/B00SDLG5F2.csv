8698180,3,B00SDLG5F2,"Here's the scenario: Stef Dawson was the lead [antagonist]in this presumably micro budget movie, and while shooting she received word about landing her life-changing Hunger Games role (instant movie star, just add water). To her credit, she kept shooting for Mark Pirro's ""Rage"" anyway.
I was going to give this 2 stars but then watched the Behind the Scenes featurette: seeing Stef on morphine IRL (due to her unfortunate encounter with a stingray at the beach) was funny enough that I suddenly felt my money hadn't been wasted.

PROs
+ Stef Dawson, Lauren Baldwin
+ To his credit, Mark Pirro writes Stef's character as not an innately evil girl, but instead disturbed due to a drunk abusive ey hole of a father (which incidentally makes the story more believable)
+ Also to his credit, Mark Pirro seems to do well in taking a ""micro"" budget and producing what [arguably] looks better than a home video. If you'd like to see just how ""micro"" and learn some poor man's tricks of the trade, watch the extras on the DVD!

CONs
-The audio and video quality, the soundtrack, nearly all of the humor, the length (104 minutes is fully 20 minutes too long for a work of this quality), a protagonist who is slightly likable yet self-cursed with the fatal flaw of doing what's obviously not in his best interest (""pigheaded"" is the best descriptor)... I could go on but it hurts my head to think about Rage of Innocence.

COMMENT
Stef Dawson is ""Raven,"" a daughter who is named after... wait for it... the X-Men character Raven Darkhlme (rad, I've always wanted a son named Magneto or Iceman). I'm still not quite convinced Stef is a 5-star actor, but with a face like that who cares (I adored her recently in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cleverman/dp/B01FQ0VU52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cleverman</a>). In Rage of Innocence she plays an intolerable teen who was let out of the mental hospital a few years too early; yet too often here it feels like you're watching somebody acting like a hellion rather than watching an actual hellion. That said, Stef owns a spunkiness that's hard to deny (not surprising for someone who grew up doing gymnastics on horseback in Canberra) and she effectively steals the show while onscreen.

If you can get past an early scene of the slimy gym teacher (played by unfunny comedian Bill Devlin) jabbering dismissively about statutory rape while shooting hoops with a couple of other teachers (including the protagonist Vincent, so the scene was not pointless), then you've made it over the first of many hurdles. ""Rage"" is actually painful to watch in general: it's basically for folks who enjoy tediously slow train wrecks on a barely-there budget. More than anything, I found it depressing in the wrong kind of way. Some films are depressing but with purpose, whether it be motion picture as art, politics, or a glimpse of history. This one succeeds in no particular area, although it certainly provides little-needed emphasis to the understanding that child abuse must be stopped.",1472083200,,3055,5.031620553359684
8698181,5,B00SDLG5F2,Mark Pirro is not exactly known for making impressive drama but boy did he do an amazing job on this. Sure the actress Stef Dawson gets credit but the real genius is from Pirro for sure. Given his prior work such as Rectuma you wouldnt expect this out of him but my hats off to him. He did it and he did it well. What a thriller and how well done. It really makes you think not just twice but a dozen times about what appears to be and what may really be. It shows that the man has skill way beyond making silly (but really funny) comedy. I love all his work so far but this is very unique and I am glad that I happened to stumble upon this gem.,1467936000,,645,3.893939393939394
8698182,5,B00SDLG5F2,Brilliant Stef Dawson movie. Without spoiling the movie.. This performance will impact you and make you think twice about your own actions. Must see! You can really see the talent that got her the Mockingjay gig. Watching the commentary and surprising the producer reveals all the low budget tricks to produce a quality movie on a budget. Pirromount has really matured and reached a new level.,1422489600,,393,4.96969696969697
8698183,5,B00SDLG5F2,"Suspense.  Terror.  Edge of your seat grittiness.  Stef Dawson is amazing as Raven.  When she's on screen, the owns!  Solid performances by the rest of the cast too.",1421452800,,165,4.75
