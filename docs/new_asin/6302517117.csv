7827045,1,6302517117,"I liked Teresa Russel a lot but this is just a terrible movie.  What's with the nuns?  It just made no sense.  The husband is dead.  Okay, she feels guilty.  The story would have had a better ending if she had just imagined his reappearance out of guilt for her affair.  But they bring in a bunch of religious crap with a cross burned into a hillside?  And then at the end she rushes back to live with her dead husband?  Won't he start rotting?  Seldom has a movie made me so angry.  Nicolas Roeg has made some fine movies, ""Man Who Fell To Earth"", ""Aria"", ""English Patient"", ""Insignificance"".  I read that on this one the screen writer emphasized the Catholic stuff.",1366848000,3,667,4.385245901639344
7827046,3,6302517117,"I can't wonder why Teresa Russell's career stalled - this just isn't a good movie, regardless of the fact that Will patton is playing a priest.  No wonder I'd never seen it before.  I can't recommend this film to anyone but the stars' staunchest fans.",1305590400,,251,4.555555555555555
7827047,3,6302517117,"Mark's acting in this movie-literally saves this movie.
The only reason I was able to watch it thru to the end was because of the quality of his performance in this role.

the movie itself was seriously disjointed and unbelievable in storyline.
When you take a story that is seemingly about 1 thing, infidelity in what appears to be a perfect marriage, and the ""fessing up"" to the unsuspecting spouse and take that line and jump to an exorcism type story line as the reason for the strange things happening to a person; who is recovering from being severely injured/presumed dead, it makes for unbelievable.
I was hugely disappointed in this storyline's progression. However, I was more than inpressed by Mark's performance. As one of over 30 movies he has done, I've never been disappointed in his acting yet.",1215734400,3,810,4.827338129496403
7827048,3,6302517117,"Mark Harmon's acting is the saving grace for this disjointed and somewhat bizarre movie. One of the problems with this movie is the jumping from one situation to the next, with no iota of sense that it's even realistic to follow in that train of thought.
Another problem? how do you get from a presumed dead/now missing husband, to a vision/dream that has haunted you for a year?

and better yet, how do you get from a weak/recovering from a head injury to being possessesed in a negative way - that's supposed to be from  a ""Godly"" vision?
Please!
as I said, Mark's portrayal of what was obviously a tough role to play, saved the day on this one.
If you aren't a fan of his - pick another movie.",1215561600,5,696,4.346153846153846
7827049,5,6302517117,this movie is what we want simple yet compelling stories that tell us there is something deeper.,1145577600,5,96,4.705882352941177
7827050,5,6302517117,"This is a very spellbinding movie about a wife who contemplates leaving her husband for another but her husband has a fatal nasty accident leading her to flashbacks and a supernatural encounter. Starring Mark Harmon and Theresa Russell,it's a must see that should be on DVD!!!!",1129507200,8,277,5.043478260869565
