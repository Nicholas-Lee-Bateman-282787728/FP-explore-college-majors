Go onto the internet, bring up ""IMDB"" for reviews on this movie and any movie you are interested in.
They write better reviews than me.
I rate it 4 out of 5 stars'",1469232000,,216,4.046511627906977
8734578,4,B015SE33I8,"""Black Sheep"" is a first rate programmer produced by Sol Wurtzel at the Fox studio, circa 1935.  The film stars Edmund Lowe, a terrific leading man of the period, as a professional gambler on a voyage to New York. The film contains lots of cliched characters - the obnoxious Texan oil man, Eugene Palette, the sophisticated divorcee, the stunning Adrienne Ames, the wealthy drunk, Herbert Mundin etc.  Starring with Lowe is a very young Claire Trevor as a budding actress. The plot is quite corny but all the players are excellent and veteran Alan Dwan directs the film very smoothly. The ship board scenes seem very authentic, preserving a way of life which no longer exists. What makes the film so special is the script. Trevor, in particular, has some great lines and shows real comic ability and a great rapport with Lowe.  Best Line - ""They asked me to play a salad - without the dressing, so I walked out.""

The film is beautifully photographed and the soundtrack is full of familiar tunes from the films of Alice Faye from the 1934/1935 period.  Issued in the Fox Cinema Archives collection, the print is worn but more than an adequate, but there are no extras, not even a scene selection.",1453593600,2,1196,4.6761904761904765

8734580,5,B015SE33I8,"This is a great deal on two great films.  I just want to warn everyone that although it is in fact all regions, it will not work on my Playstation 3.  I have the newest model (currently 320 GB) and when you put the disc in it plays the opening advertisement for movie sponsors but the menu does not load.  The screen just goes to black and nothing happens.  I am however able to play it on my laptop.  Hope this helps people out.",1297987200,5,429,4.059523809523809
