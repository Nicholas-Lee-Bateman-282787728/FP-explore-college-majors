8461010,5,B0057O6II2,"The dialogue in this production of S. Ansky's play The Dybbuk is absolutely poetic.  I have seen a version of this play on DVD in Yiddish (with English subtitles) from 1937 (please see my review).  While that version, (available from Amazon at http://www.amazon.com/The-Dybbuk-Avrom-Morevski/dp/B00067HP9G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1335853279&sr=8-1) delves deeper into the backstory of the pact made between the two fathers, the love between Channon and his beshert, and features some beautiful singing in Yiddish by a popular Cantor, as well as an ominous person with mystical powers, this production of the play, which was a ""Play of the Week"" during the 1950's, I think would be much more palatable to an English speaking audience.
Sweet, inspiring, stimulating and ultimately tragic, this play would be of interest to those with an interest in Jewish theater, Jewish history, the Kabbalah, as well as the esoteric practice of exorcism in the Jewish religion.  There are one or two portions on this transfer of the DVD that are a little warped, picture-wise, but this is a small issue.  I give this item a strong five out of five stars.  Highly recommended!",1335744000,6,1158,5.306010928961749
8461011,5,B0057O6II2,"Unfortunately good television ended in the 1950s and this classic TV production proves it.  A background in Jewish mysticism would help the viewer appreciate the drama better. I originally saw this in 1960 when I was nine and remembered parts all these years, mainly because they frightened me so bad I ran from the room.",1319846400,,321,4.836363636363636
8461012,5,B0057O6II2,"The idea of the Dybbuk reaches deep into the middle ages.

This particular version of this Dybbuk however reaches only early into the beginning of the twentieth century when it was recorded as the story of what a man did when he learned his beloved would not be his.

Reneging on a marriage promise, a man loses his love to a rich man's son.

How he responds to all this and what happens is the subject of this timeless story.

The original and still definative version of this came from Polish Yiddish cinema in 1937.  It's haunting viewing where many of the actors themselves became dybbuk as they died in Nazi concentratrion camps.

For viewers seeking an accessible English language version of this story I think it does a very passable job but I would still heartily recommend at least attempting the 1937 version.  While neither conforms exactly to the original play they help better connect us at one and the same time to this lost man and to ourselves.",1319846400,2,960,4.6117647058823525
