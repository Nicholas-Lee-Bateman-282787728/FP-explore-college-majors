8749304,5,B01B58VTA0,"As a long-time fan of the Signing Time series, this has been my next step towards advancing my sign language skills.  Rachel, Alex, and Leah (and of course, Hopkins!) draw the learner into the experience, and I find myself hearing the songs and sessions in my head long after I have put the DVD away for the day.  I cannot say enough about the approachability of the entire Signing Time series as a tool to make Sign Language accessible to everyone - children and adults alike.  I would recommend this product without hesitation and plan on using the entire series as a teaching tool in my life, as I have encountered deaf people in my daily life who have needed assistance, and I have been able to communicate with them and help.  (One woman locked her keys in her trunk, and I was able to contact the police and act as an interpreter when the officer arrived!)  This series is life-changing.  More folks should take the time to learn sign language, and this is a great way to do it!  Cudos to Rachel and Co. for all they have contributed to this educational process...",1515456000,,1070,4.484536082474227

8749308,5,B01B58VTA0,Great Video in the continuing series. It's fun to see the kids all grown up. I like how genuine Leah and Alex are.,1486857600,,114,4.0
8749309,5,B01B58VTA0,"I am going to be watching this again and again.
My youngest son, 19 months, is in LOVE with the original Signing Time series. He's too young for this video but it helps ME for my adult ASL classes.
I simply ADORE the references back to the original series too!",1478390400,4,260,4.22
8749310,5,B01B58VTA0,"We absolutely LOVE this DVD. I, an adult, am learning SO much. We've watched Alex & Leah grow up from Signing Times Volume 1. I can't rave enough about the self confidence my 2 girls have learning ASL. Rachael & the team have made it so fun, and given us the ability to retain a ton of what we learn.

We find ourselves in the van singing along, and signing to each other just for practice. GREAT first addition to a child's multilingual dialogue. I strongly believe, Signing Time is the reason my daughter could read at 4, with very little instruction from Mom & Dad.

Thank you Rachael, Alex & Leah! <3",1474243200,4,604,4.336283185840708
8749311,5,B01B58VTA0,"As an ASL college student this was done very well and would be helpful as a an introduction for an ASL 1 student especially if you use the Level 2 with Leah voice off option. Rachel, Leah and Alex do an excellent job explaining and teaching proper ASL format, fingerspelling & name signs, basic classifiers, an example of ABC stories, as well as explaining a few basics of Deaf Culture. This will be a beneficial video for my older kids who want to learn ASL as well as my students. I also love that you get to see more of Alex and Leah's personality, I had no idea Alex was a beatboxer at first I thought he was faking until I googled it. My kids will also get a kick out of his dance moves they are very current. The sentence practice with Rachel is great but the speed is a bit fast to read and sign with the voice off option, really that is my only complaint. So when does Vol 2 come out?",1461542400,7,892,4.102857142857143
8749312,4,B01B58VTA0,"We love these and was very excited that they came out with a sentence structure video.  I don't feel like it was as well done as the earlier videos, but still totally worth it.",1457481600,4,176,4.176470588235294
