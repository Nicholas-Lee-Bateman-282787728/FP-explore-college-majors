3136778,2,B0014Z4OLQ,did not meet my expectation at all I saw him in person before and was impressed but this dvd is nothing,1355788800,,103,3.9523809523809526
3136779,5,B0014Z4OLQ,"I enjoyed this dvd performance!  I have always liked Rickey Smiley but I was truly impressed with Marc Theobold!  I had never seen him before and he was hilarious!!!!!  I have seen Dean Edwards before and I know Todd Lynn and they both ""bring the hilarity"" also.  If I had to put my own title to the comedy on this dvd I would call it ""Green Comedy"" because it's comedy that is useful, clean and ""recycleable""!",1326240000,,410,4.355263157894737
3136780,3,B0014Z4OLQ,Rickey Smiley is funny as usual. Todd Lynn made me laugh out loud. The other comedians are not so funny.,1263168000,2,104,4.25
3136781,4,B0014Z4OLQ,Rickey Smiley is stupid funny as usual.  The other comics I have seen before in different settings and they are clean and funny is this dvd.,1260316800,,140,4.384615384615385
3136782,3,B0014Z4OLQ,Sometime this type of comedy is hard for me to understand. But what I did understand I enjoyed.,1252713600,,95,4.333333333333333
3136783,1,B0014Z4OLQ,"This video is not very funny.  It is not worth the time or money. Rickey Smiley is usually funnier. However, this video had a lot of different comedians that were not funny.",1224374400,,173,4.40625
3136784,1,B0014Z4OLQ,This DVD is by far the worst presentation of Rickey Smiley's work.  It is family friendly but it wasn't very funny.,1217548800,2,115,4.476190476190476
3136785,5,B0014Z4OLQ,I purchased this dvd. and i laughed from beginning to end. i would recommend this dvd to any christian that like's a good laugh.,1214784000,,128,4.375
3136786,5,B0014Z4OLQ,"Syndicated radio host and former BET Comic View host Rickey Smiley brings his outrageously comedic antics and impersonations full circle in Kingdom Comedy, the latest entry in the gospel comedy genre.  He brings Dean Edwards (Saturday Night Live), Todd Lynn (My Wife and Kids), Marc Theobald (Def Comedy Jam) and Marc Younger (Last Comic Standing) along for the ride.  Ranging from subjects like church, race & gender differences and raising kids, this is a definite hit that the entire family can enjoy for 2 hours and 4 minutes.  With extras including two extra Rickey Smiley comedy routines, a Rickey Smiley interview (which is divided into several commentaries in between acts) and a music performance from a rising Stellar award-nominated gospel songstress, the runtime is between 2 1/2 and 3 hours.  This DVD is a definite must-have alongside Holla!-The Gospel Comedy Hour and Sinbad's HBO comedy specials.  I hope that he'll release another volume.  What are you waiting for?  Go ahead, buy this and plan a family night laughing at Rickey Smiley & Co. delivering the best in good clean gospel comedy.",1210204800,6,1107,5.082872928176796
