6381755,3,B00JO9O1WG,"Please read absolutely no further, if you are concerned about ""spoilers""....

While his behavior does not seem to be of serious concern to the makers of this film, Brendan Gleeson's priest character should absolutely be suspended from his duties. He gives unbelievably inappropriate pastoral advice to one young man, suggesting the use of pornography and/or the search for young women of ""loose morals."" He appears to consider providing a gun to an elderly parishioner, for a possible suicide. And what's up with his owning and driving a sporty red convertible through a rural Ireland of modest means? It's more than odd that the filmmaker seems to view the younger priest in the rectory as the one who is incompetent for his responsibilities!

Once again, please read no further, if you are concerned about ""spoilers""....

Be all of the above said, Brendan Gleeson's priest character is NOT an abuser of children. Yet, he will die for the reported crimes of a brother priest, who is now deceased. Largely due to such unspeakable crimes against children, apparently inadequate concern about children from the hierarchy, and incredible anger among survivors, the filmmaker seems to be suggesting that we may be moving more and more toward a priestless Ireland....

It's hard to know whether the filmmaker sees that as a good thing or a bad thing. It would be tragic, but God will never abandon His people.",1409443200,5,1404,5.012875536480687
6381756,5,B00JO9O1WG,"This is a movie that is not easy to watch. If you want feel good summer entertainment you had better skip it. . The beginning quote from St. Augustine which also figured prominently in Samuel Beckett's ""Waiting for Godot"". sets the tone. ""Do not despair, one thief was saved, do not presume, one thief was damned""..Aa I write this review the movie is one of the most discussed on movie blogs, reviews, Christian web pages and general blogs I have seen in many years. It is filled with the Irish love for dark humour and language; however, I did not laugh once through the whole film.

The priest, a very good man, but one who has weathered severe  stress and great personal loss,  is cast against various individuals who to me symbolized the malaise in today's society.  Yep, drug use, pedophilia, adultery,  financial misconduct, greed, ethics of suicide and as the priest says early on ""...Machiavellian chicanery."" are all present . The priest dresses in a soutane. You know from the outset, he is not a "" five steps to recovery, feel good, one of the boys type of person""

The movie can be viewed as a mystery but also as a moral journey and  a suspenseful study of one man/'s supreme test of faith against almost impossible odds. I will say nothing more about the plot but only my feelings regarding the film,  since there are so many blogs and reviews out there.

One of the most wonderful allegories in the film is a scene where Holbein's masterful and mysterious painting ""The Ambassadors"" becomes a tense center of conflict between the priest and the supposed ""owner"" of the painting. The painting actually hangs in the National Gallery in London. If you are unfamiliar with the painting, check it out on the web, but only after you have seen the movie. You will get a surprise.

As the great writer Alice Munro stated so beautifully at the end of one of her short stories, ""...we say we cannot forgive ourselves, or that some things cannot be forgiven. But we can, ...we do, ...we do it all the time"".  The priest says the same thing another way, ""..too much talk about sins and not enough about  virtues...I think forgiveness is highly under rated""

A final word on individual performance and background. Brendon Gleeson is wonderful. Watch the opening scene, where the movement of his eyebrows and the expression of horror on his face says much more than he is able to convery to the opening words of a confession. His scene with ""the virtuous woman"" who has just lost her husband I thought to be the most touching in the movie. Two steadfast people finding comfort in each other,  if only for a moment.

I thought Phillip Seymour Hoffman to be one of the great character actors of our time. Now I will be watching every movie Gleeson is in. Gleeson's son  is also in the film. I loved the inclusion of a snippet of Roger Whittaker's song, ""New Day in the Morning"" as the film moves to the climax.",1409270400,4,2909,4.5761078998073215
6381757,4,B00JO9O1WG,"""Calvary"" (2014 release from Ireland; 101 min.) brings the story of Father James (played by Brendan Gleeson), the priest in a remote Irish sea coast village. As the movie opens, we see Father James' face in the half-dark, He is in a confession booth and when the next person comes to confess, the first thing he says is ""I was 7 when I had my first taste of semen"", shocking Father James (and us). The guy goes on to explain how he was raped every other day, for years, by a (now dead) priest. He informs Father James to meet him at the beach next Sunday where he intends to kill him, giving him a week ""to put your house in order"". The rest of the movie plays out over those 7 days. We see Father James deal with small and not-so-small personal issues, including his troubled daughter Fiona (played by Kelly Reilly), as we learn that Father James was married and turned to priesthood after his wife died. Then there is the butcher Jack (played by Chris O'Dowd), whose wife Veronica is openly having affairs left and right. What will become of Father Jack? Who made that confession? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, while the movie is set up as a ""who did it"" (namely who made that confession), in reality it is only a minor aspect of the movie. Much more important is the character study of Father James, a priest who tries to do right in a world where many have lost trust in priests and the Catholic church as a whole. Second, if you think that this movie is a close examination of the Catholic church's guilt (and liability) in the sexual abuse scandal that has been going on for decades, wrong again. Yes, it is touched upon here and there in the film, but again it's not the main focus. Third, this is the latest movie from writer-director John Michael McDonagh, who previously brought us the excellent ""Ned Kelly"" and ""The Guard"". He is on target again in this movie. Fourth, there are a number of outstanding performances in this movie, none more so that Brendan Gleeson who brings a towering performance as Father James (we most recently saw him in ""The Grand Seduction""). But check out Kelly Reilly as his troubled daughter, whom we most recently saw reprise her role of Wendy in ""Chinese Puzzle"", the third movie in the French franchise chronicling Xavier and Wendy's life. And last but certainly not least, keep your eye out for a 5 min. or so appearance of the convicted killer Freddy (whom Father James visits in jail), played magnificently by Domhnall Gleeson, yes the son of Brendan Gleeson! Outstanding.

The movie opened without much pre-release fanfare or buzz this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I went to se it right away. The early evening screening I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, I am happy to say. Bottom line: if you are up for a top-notch movie that brings a complex character study, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Calvary"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1408665600,54,3027,4.572744014732965
6381758,5,B00JO9O1WG,"An honest look at faith and life thru the lens of a small Irish village where the church is no longer the glue that holds it together. Glesson is amazing as the broken hearted priest dealing with his community on every level.  It's a 'who done it', a black comedy, and above all a redemptive story that will leave you shocked and inspired all at once...everyone should see this film, and if Glesson doesn't get an oscar nod for this, the academy should get a phone call telling them what will happen to them in seven days!  On par with that other celtic classic, 'Breaking The Waves'...go get it.",1408579200,11,596,4.458715596330276
6381759,4,B00JO9O1WG,"This is an odd drama which made me scratch my head and feel empty and drained by the time it was all over. Father James (Brendan Gleeson) hears the confession of a man who claims he was abused by a priest and he plans on killing Father James because he is a good priest. The film consists of James making his peace as he visits various members of his parish and community. James also tends to a suicidal daughter (Kelly Reilly). Father James claims he knows who told him this in the confessional, yet does nothing about it. As the audience we don't know and can only guess.

The community in which Father James lives seem to consider him obsolete and a joke. The production is more of an examination of how society has changed with religion no longer the center of people's lives. Indeed, all the characters mock the church either openly or through their deeds. Dark comedy at times.

Amid all the bustle it also offers one of the most honest portrayals of a priest's life I've ever seen in a dramatic film, set in a world that despises the church (owing to pedophiles in the priesthood). The story grabs you from its first five minutes and never lets go. The cinematography of Ireland, vast and village, is beautiful. The actors are perfectly cast. Brendan Gleeson hoists the story on his broad shoulders and carries it home.

6381779,1,B00JO9O1WG,"I wanted to like this movie, the description was intriguing. The acting was great. However the story itself was awful. Fr. James was supposed to have been targeted because he was a ""good"" priest. But when a young man came to him for counsel because he was frustrated, lonely, etc, Fr. James suggested he go to Dublin where there are women with loose morals. And asked the young man if he'd tried pornography as a way of working out his frustrations and social ineptness. Another time he confronts a man who admits to having committed adultery but Fr. James is less concerned about that than he is that the man may have hit the woman. He also talks to the woman, who sleeps around even though she's married, but is only concerned that someone hit her. Then Fr. James says that he knows the person who plans to kill him but never once tries to talk to the man during the week before their scheduled meeting. What priest would not try to counsel a person who has murder on his agenda? He tries to convince the other young man not to join the military because killing is wrong but the one he knows is planning a murder he never even confronts. It's a truly awful story. I was hoping for a good uplifting movie about a good Catholic priest.  This isn't the one.",1485216000,4,1256,4.390557939914163

Eternal salvation versus eternal damnation. The movie starts with Father James (Gleeson) listening a confession from a man whom we don't see and who tells a story about how he was sexually abused by a Catholic priest since he was 7 years old.  The man tells Father James that he will take vengeance for his sufferings by killing a good priest (he means Father James) and gives him a week to put his affairs in order. During that week, Father James keeps trying to help his congregation while listening to their confessions and sometimes witnessing their wrongdoings, and slowly, losing his temper. McDonagh brothers are certainly very talented writers and they surely love Irish actor Brendan Gleeson who stars in John Michael McDonaghs Calvary. After watching him In Bruge, The Guard and finally in Calvary, who can argue with them? He is a brilliant and versatile actor whose screen presence is huge and undeniable.

6381843,1,B00JO9O1WG,"I absolutely hated this movie, and I feel like an idiot for buying this piece of crap movie on Blu-Ray because the reviews were good. I'll admit that the acting was great, and the cinematography was beautiful, but the story was a gigantic pile of feces. The whole movie is incredibly depressing, and the worst part is that it has nothing to say, and no reason to exist. If the director wanted to be edgy and weird, you'd think that he'd actually want to do something, anything with the story other than spending a whole movie introducing a bunch of weird unlikable characters. They don't even go into depth about who any of the characters are, even the main one. The viewer hears their stories, and see who they appear to be, but not one of them feels real or honest. I liked the whodunit vibe of the film, but it was all just so jumpy, going from one suspect to the next, with all of them being weird and mean for no apparent reason.

The only way to talk about the rest of my problems with the movie is to use spoilers, so if you for some reason still want to see the film you should stop reading now. They kill the dog. Yes, they kill the dog. In the end it turns out that the man molested by a priest as a child didn't even kill the dog, as he loves dogs, so not only was the death of the dog pointless, you don't even know who slit the dog's throat or why. I also hated the ending, where he essentially commits suicide by letting the guy kill him without putting up any kind of fight. It was all just so pointless, as if he truly felt that killing anyone would be a sin, he could have gone to the police, or he could have fought him, as he showed that threatening innocent douche bags with a gun and then beating them up is something he has no problems doing. I still don't know what the director was trying to say with this movie, other than life sucks and then you die. It isn't about habitual Church sanctioned child abuse, I mean that only comes up at the very beginning and end of the movie, and it's just a means to an end to give the guy a reason to murder a good man that happens to be a priest.

I really wouldn't recommend this film, and even though I'm a Blu-Ray collector, I'm seriously thinking about trading Cavalry in. However, I'd never want to subject someone else to it, so instead I might just throw it in the trash, like the piece of garbage it is.",1453420800,5,2373,4.167755991285403

6381853,5,B00JO9O1WG,"The film opens with the serious, impassive face of Brendan Gleeson in a confessional, as a priest who hears an unseen man tell him that as retribution for abuse he suffered at the hands of another priest, he will kill him in exactly one week, not because he is evil, but because he is innocent.  The priest knows who the man is, and the rest of the film follows him through the course of that week as he interacts with the various characters (and all of them are, indeed, ""characters"") in the small and remote Irish coastal town where he lives.

It soon becomes clear that the Catholic religion, or even belief in God, is no longer important to anyone here, not even to the other priest in town.  There's one exception; in a powerful scene, a woman who has just lost her husband in an accident says that this is not ""unfair:"" what is unfair is when other people don't experience the same kind of love she had.  In another memorable scene, Aidan Gillen (better known as ""Petyr Baelish"" in HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones/dp/B00DY64CR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones</a>) plays an atheist doctor who describes a truly chilling vision of hell.

Gleeson's priest is complex, a man who entered the priesthood late in life after his wife's death and after the birth of his daughter.  In his dignified and intelligent way, he grapples with the contempt of the townspeople he is attempting to minister to; their contempt due in no small part to the sexual abuse scandals that damaged the church he represents.  At one point, a man describes a list of suicides throughout history; Jesus Christ was said to be one - a troubling thought if one feels that suicide hurts those who must go on living.

Although I have my own issues with religion, I'm not Catholic and fortunately was never a victim of sexual abuse (unless you count circumcision), so I had the luxury of watching the sexual abuse scandal unfold from the outside.  This film, which takes place in what at least used to be a profoundly Catholic country, shows us a place where the scandal has essentially destroyed the credibility of religion in general.  In one scene, the other priest blames the scandal on ""the Yanks"" and blithely dismisses it as ""over 50 years ago - water under the bridge"" while the man standing next to him has been threatened with death over this very issue.  In every scene, ""Calvary"" asks if forgiveness is possible if we cannot let go of the past, or as one man points out, that all sins are ""past sins,"" otherwise, they'd just be bad intentions.  In the end, we can weep only for ourselves.",1443312000,4,2646,4.816777041942605
6381854,3,B00JO9O1WG,"A committed secular liberal would love this movie. Why? because the ultimate goal of secular liberalism at its roots, going back at least to Machiavelli in the sixteenth century has always been the ""liberation"" of culture ""from"" the church, the Catholic Church in particular, and a returning of the world to a pre-christian ancient paganism. Father James, as a ""good priest"", is nonetheless ""bad"" by virtue of his official association with the Catholic Church, and therefore deserving of death in the end. All of the ""bad"" parishioners that Father James is supposed to be converting, are really in fact ""good"", because after all, they are simply ""human"", at least according to a more pagan understanding of what it means to be human. The main underlying statement that this movie is trying to make can easily be seen in the burning down of the church (to the complete joy of all the parishioners), the cold blooded and unremorseful murder of the ""good priest"", as the Church's representative, the sequencing of the parishioners giving themselves over to their vices (or virtues from the liberal perspective), and finally, with the priest's own daughter (he was a widower) showing sympathy for the ""good priest's"" murderer. I will give this movie three stars not because I liked it but because it really shows in an unmasked way the complete violent hatred that committed secular liberals feel toward Christianity in general and the Catholic Church in particular. If you ever wondered why committed liberals have no interest in dialog with committed Christians, this movie will help you understand.",1441929600,6,1597,5.099236641221374

Do not presume; one of the thieves was damned.""...St Augustine.  It seems to be the motto of the main character. There are a lot of heart felt moments in this movie showing a very human man who joined the priesthood to care for damaged people.  He seems to embody most good things about real ministers.  He is honest about his own short comings and genuinely cares about others. The amount of cussing he did undermined that a bit. His character is what gives value to this movie. His persistence in continuing to try to help those he lives among even as they continue wasting their potential. This is much more of a dark drama with a tiny bit of humor.  If the description was more accurate, I would have given it another star.  Despite the quote in the beginning, the ending of this movie seems to give way to despair.

Brendan Gleeson fit his role--as a passionate, compassionate and committed priest trying to help his wayward flock--like a glove, and many other performances were simply stellar.

6381864,5,B00JO9O1WG,"THE FILM: I can't say that I was completely prepared for the emotional punch that CALVARY provided, but am very pleased for it. The plot is almost unimportant, in that the construction merely allows for the exploration of various themes. Basically, a priest (Brendan Gleeson) is told in the confessional booth that he will die soon, and is given a week to get his affairs in order. What follows is essentially a series of conversations that touch on everything from faith, suicide, pedophilia in the Catholic Church, to human nature in general. Even though it examines some very high-minded and profound themes, it never felt pretentious, and always felt emotionally honest. The performances from everyone were excellent, especially Brendan Gleeson. His role as a simple priest was very sympathetic and human, in contrast to the corporate monstrosity that the Church has been and, in some way, continues to be. It makes you take a step back and realize that behind every organization are people not so different from you and I. Despite going to some pretty dark places, Gleeson's priest remains the emotional center that grounds everything, and the film overall is quite hopeful when it comes to human relationships. The only thing that could have been slightly better is for the mystery to be a bit less predictable, although the ""who's gonna do it?"" isn't really the point. When it comes down to it, CALVARY is a great character study that effectively uses its narrative structure to create drama and tension. If I'd seen this last year, it would have definitely been in my top 10. Highly recommended if you're into thoughtful dramas.

THE EXTRAS: As with many smaller films, there isn't a lot of special features, but I was grateful for what was there. The longest one was a roughly 20-minute behind-the-scenes featurette in which the cast get to talk about the characters. It was a great ensemble cast and, even though there wasn't a whole lot of additional insight, it felt like this was a project that they all were proud to be part of. Beyond that, there were a few short promotional featurettes that go into the film's themes, Gleeson's priest character, and the key relationship of the priest with his daughter. There is also a still gallery. The material provided doesn't go that deep, but the film more than makes up for it.

OVERALL: I can't overstate how amazing this film is. The performances are top-notch, the locations and cinematography beautiful, and above all it explores some very human themes that should speak to anyone. As with many Fox releases (especially from the Searchlight sub-label), it's pretty light on supplementary material, but this is worth a purchase based on the film alone. Again, if you haven't yet seen this I highly recommend that you do so. You won't be disappointed.",1436832000,8,2811,4.91578947368421
6381865,5,B00JO9O1WG,"A man comes to confessional and tells a priest that because of the sexual torment he received at the hands of another priest as a child, he was going to exact his revenge by killing him.  He DID have the decency, however, to give the priest a week to ""get his affairs in order.""

Brandon Gleason is absolutely superb as the innocent priest (who has serious issues of his own) upon whom the man intends to exact this revenge.  While a major mystery is trying to figure out who, among this motley crew of Irish villagers was the one in the confessional booth, the bigger issues surround the questions of faith the movie so intensely raises/addresses.

The questions/shadings/perceptions of faith, its meanings, applications or even its relevance are beeeeeeeeautifully realized from the various character studies the film presents forcing the viewer to give serious consideration to these questions loooooooong after the movie is over. And make no mistake about it - regardless of your religious views, the movie is bound to make you think.  My own religious views have been dramatically modified over the years because of personal experience and after watching this yesterday, the wonderful thing about it is that this neither validates nor diminshes those modifications.

The cinematography is breath-taking displaying a gorgeous view of the Emerald Isle amidst this foreboding look at the role of religion in various lives.

This is how the story goes: Father James is a small-town priest in Ireland whose Sunday confessionals suddenly include a threat to kill him in a week's time as a matter of principle. Deeply troubled and conflicted about how to respond, Father James tries to go on with his calling through that week. However, that proves impossible as he is confronted with a troubling variety of spiritual challenges from both his estranged daughter and his own parishioners. In those dispiriting struggles, Father James' life begins to fall apart as time runs out towards a confrontation that seems to crystallize his values and what he wants his life to be.

The cast led by Brendan Gleeson (superb as usual as Father James) & Chris O'Dowd (solid as Jack Brennan) is great. The directing, story & screenplay by John Michael McDonagh is great.

The music by Patrick Cassidy is great. The cinematography by Larry Smith is great. The film editing by Chris Gill is great. The casting by Jina Jay is great.

6381873,4,B00JO9O1WG,"A character study involving people in an Irish town interacting with their local Catholic priest with a twist - the priest's life has been threatened by a parish member. Brendan Gleeson (Cold Mountain, In Bruges) is Father James Lavelle, who became a Catholic priest after his wife died. Chris O'Dowd is Jack Brennan (Bridesmaids, IT Crowd) a parish member who is the husband of an openly adulterous wife. Father James has an emotionally fragile daughter, Fiona (Kelly Reilly) from his marriage. Aidan Gillen (Littlefinger in Game of Thrones) also plays a role.

While this movie was billed as a comedy, it is anything but (in my opinion). The subject matter is a worldwide tragedy as serious as a heart attack. Once revealed, there is no manner of humor to be wrung out of such a script. Gleeson is a superb actor and so viewers will be treated to yet another stellar performance. Chris O'Dowd has a serious role for a change, so viewers will be introduced to his acting versatility. Performances by all are noteworthy and Gillen shines. Each character in the parish has some sort of gripe with the Catholic church and its clergy - some more than others. Yet this is the writer's platform and I, as a viewer, (not a Catholic) sank so low in the muck of it all, and felt so oppressed by the indifference to the offenses by the clergy that I wanted to go to sleep to escape. I think if viewers are looking forward to an In Bruges type of quirky humor encore, they will be sorely disappointed.  Recommended for cast only.

6381878,5,B00JO9O1WG,"John Michael McDonagh is writing a trilogy for actor Brendan Gleeson - the first being THE GUARD, and now CALVARY, and the third has yet to be announced. The trilogy is a profound series of character studies - how men respond in a world that they have wronged in the past and are working to make better in the present. Having seen the first two installments we can only applaud the combined efforts of McDonagh and Gleeson in creating very powerful films that challenge the viewer to observe the world as it is developing.

One of the major `cast' members in this gripping film is the countryside and seaside of Ireland - rarely has it been so eloquently photographed and made part of the storyline of a film. But the story itself is rather terrifying. Father James Brendan Gleeson) is a small-town priest in Ireland with a background of alcoholism and having been married to a wife now deceased, whose Sunday confessionals suddenly include a man's voice who has suffered sexual abuse form priests as a youth and now threatens to kill Father James him in a week's time as a matter of principle. Deeply troubled and conflicted about how to respond, Father James tries to go on with his calling through that week. However, that proves impossible as he is confronted with a troubling variety of spiritual challenges from both his estranged daughter Fiona (Kelley Reilly) and his own parishioners - the butcher Jack Brennan (Chris O'Dowd), Simon - a possible abuser (Isaach De Bankol&eacute;) of Jack Brennan's incestuous wife Veronica (Orla O'Rourke), an old writer (M. Emmet Walsh), Dr. Harte (Aidan Gillen) and a failing priest (David Wilmot) among others. Tragedies occur (the church is burned, Father James' dog Bruno is killed) and as time ticks on the week presses toward Sunday when Father James' life is supposed to end on the beach by someone we do not know. In those dispiriting struggles, Father James' life begins to fall apart as time runs out towards a confrontation that seems to crystallize his values and what he wants his life to be.

This is a story rich in content, addressing issues within the Catholic Church about same sex relations and child abuse by priests, fragile marital relations, and father daughter relationships, and more. Soaring above it all is Brendan Gleeson's magnificent performance - creating a film that will in time no doubt become recognized as a very important work.

Brennan Gleeson, a fine actor, is brilliant as an alcoholic, foul-mouthed priest with a troubled personal life and a parish that's is at best indifferent, at worst hostile and seething with disrespect. Yet he is a good priest, and that earns him the murderous intent of a young man damaged -beyond repair? I think not, but the movie lets you make up your own mind.

The movie follows Fr. James through one week, showing him primarily in his interactions with his parishioners, his one friend (apparently), and his daughter (he became a priest after the death of his wife). You won't get it if you don't meditate upon the title. The ending? Pointless despair following the unspeakable child abuse scandal, or a selfless confrontation that may ultimately heal at least one soul?

6381895,4,B00JO9O1WG,"Probably the most shamefully underrated actor in films today is Brendan Gleeson.  Ill watch a movie knowing almost nothing about it if hes the star.  Shamefully overlooked for an Oscar nomination for IN BRUGES.  Hes got so much charm and so much presence for such a guy who looks nothing like a movie star.  He can do comedy.  He can do drama.  And in the sometimes delightful, sometimes difficult CALVARY, he does both.

From the creator of THE GUARD (another fun film starring Gleeson), CALVARY is the story of a priest in a little Irish town who, in the alarming opening scene, is given a death threat by a man coming to him in the confessional.  The man says he was horribly abused as a child by a priest who never paid for his crimes.  So in return, hes going to murder an innocent and good priest, and hes picked our hero.  Gleeson is clearly alarmed by this threat, and in the week hes given to put his affairs in order he grapples with a lot of things.  He does NOT, thankfully, grapple with his faithweve seen too many movies already where a priest or other religious leader grapples with a faltering faith.  But on the other hand, Gleeson must confront the citizens of his little town.

We first meet these characters, many played by fine character actors such as Chris ODowd or Aiden Giullen (Littlefinger from GAME OF THRONES) as they accept communion in church.  But we come to see these folks and their struggles to find faith or even their outright contempt of the church.  Its alarming, quite frankly, and Gleeson absorbs it all.  And into this comes his daughter (yes, Gleeson was married once but when he was widowed, he joined the priesthood).  Its not spoiling anything to say his daughter (played by Kelly Reilly, always good at playing fragile & damaged) has just recently attempted suicide.  So Father has to grapple with his antagonistic town and father must help his daughter find peace.

CALVARY is sometimes a very depressing or disheartening movie.  While not religious myself, I don't believe I scorn those who are or find contempt for them.  So to watch Gleeson having to take on all the hatred and resentment the people of his town have for the church or God and not spit back is sometimes difficult.  Gleeson allows us to see the faith his character has, the pity he has for those who are so lost, the anger he feels towards them and the confusion he feels.  To him, faith in God is good and just and reasonable and comforting thing.  HOW can it be that so many have wandered so far from that simple message?  What is the churchs culpability and what is the fault of the secular world?

Whats great about Gleeson is that even in the most serious of scenes, he can seem to find humor or at least a wry and cutting wit.  In one disturbing scene, he visits a psycho killer in prison (played by Domhall Gleeson, Brendans talented son [whose hair is distractingly like that of famed movie killer Anton Chigurh]).  The killer is nasty and attempts to bait Gleeson into lashing out.  Gleeson fights back with a witty contempt.  Basically, this priest lets everyone know hes available to them if they need spiritual counseling, but if all they are going to do is hurl abuse at him, he won't listen.  Gleeson is SO capable of playing many colors in his character all at one timethats why hes so great.  His work SEEMS effortless, but it cant be.  His performances are so rich, and his work in CALVARY is among his strongest yet.

I won't lie and say I thoroughly enjoyed CALVARY.  Its overarching metaphor is a bit stretched.  Some of the more minor characters are a bit too stock and cant keep up with the subtlety of Gleeson.  The subplot with the daughter, while very affecting for much of the film, kind of fizzles.  But overall this is a film well-worth watching, if you're not looking for a feel good evening.  But if you want something a bit challenging, or want to enjoy one of our greatest actors in one of his finest performancesput CALVARY on your list.",1429833600,3,3987,4.538569424964937

None of the supporting parts are developed at all, yet these people are so strange and horrible that you can't help but wonder what makes them act the way they do.  It's supposed to be a ""who-will-do-it"" mystery, but aside from the very beginning and very end, there seems to be no point to anything in the middle.  I'd be ok with that if it was entertaining, or thought provoking, or even interesting.  But it's none of those things.  Despite being called a black comedy by some, it is totally humorless.

6381914,5,B00JO9O1WG,"Obviously, some spoilers below. If it's obvious I shouldn't have typed that. Oh well...

What impressed me most about this movie are the characters. They are, sadly, a true microcosm of so many parishes (and society in general) across the West. There was the strong priest (Brendan Gleeson) striving to fulfill his duties in the face of cynicism, anger and hostility towards the Catholic Church. There's the spineless priest who, although ""nice"", might not have the bravery and courage it takes to be a priest today. The bishop who looks the part but doesn't take a true leadership role. There are the parishioners and villagers who, as a whole, are contrarian to anything related to the Church and morality. And, as is usual in the course of Catholic history, that strong woman who keeps the faith. Who is not bitter but thankful.

There's a scene with a just widowed wife and Father James in which the widower and the priest talk about people's reaction to death and how they sometimes lose faith. The widower responds ""It must not have been much of a faith to begin with if it was so easy to lose it."" The Father responds that ""Faith, for most people, is the fear of death. Nothing more than that."" And that's the movie right there. That's what this is about. It accurately portrays what happens to so many people's faith in the face of hardship. Ostensibly, it's the priestly sex scandals they focus on but it can also be death (as in that scene), an 'unfulfilled' marriage, lack of direction in life, being unable to control your passions and so on. Some lose the faith as a result of this but some respond with virtue.

I appreciated the honesty in the movie. As a faithful Catholic I have a hard time finding a movie with the faith in it that's not corny/preachy and overly maudlin and also not just ripping the Church apart without providing a counterpoint that can be so easily injected. Although this movie left me talking to my screen and offering rebuttals and responses to the usual (Inquisition, money/land, all priests are bad, etc.) I didn't get the feeling it was doing this to bash the Church but to show how many segments of society view the Church. And that's the last thing I took from this movie. That after a crisis like Ireland went through (and Boston) many people's emotional reaction leads to a sadder conclusion if they can't reconcile and make something approaching sense: spiritual indifference. They just don't care.

Lastly, with all the lurid and melancholy themes in the movie I would normally have to turn it off. I started to watch this series called Wallander on BBC and that was the case for that show. The dry and caustic, Irish humor really provided a nice antidote to that. Fantastic movie!",1427587200,,2731,4.683333333333334

6381945,5,B00JO9O1WG,"A priest in a small Irish coastal town is hearing confessions when a man comes in and says that he will kill the priest in a week. The man was sexually abused for years as a child by a priest and he wants to make a statement. The priest who abused him is dead but if he killed an innocent priest, that would make a statement. Father James has a week to put his life in order before it ends.

One of the first things he does is report in to his bishop, who encourages him just to report it to the police and get some protection since the guy clearly wasn't confessing (so no seal of confession). Fr. James isn't 100% sure the threat is real (or at least that is what he tells the bishop) or that it is the best way to handle the situation. He goes about his life almost like nothing is about to happen. He ministers to his flock who are often ambivalent or hostile to him even though he is a good man and a good priest (which is probably why he runs afoul of the broken, sinful people who are not repentant). His semi-estranged daughter comes to visit him. She's just tried to commit suicide and is dealing with the grief over losing her mother and the seeming loss of her father to the priesthood after her mom's death. Fr. James has a lot of things to deal with in one week.

Forgiveness is a big theme for this movie, but not in a heavy-handed way. Many different characters deal with wrongs done to them in many different ways. Some ignore the offense or write it off as the cost of living with others. Others want a recompense but do not know how or what to ask for. Answers to tough situations are hard to come by. Father James has the honesty to admit he doesn't always have the answers. He also has the love to recognize that people need answers and reconciliation even if they don't want to admit it to him or themselves. That's why he goes through this personal Calvary, why he goes to the beach to meet the man who wants to kill him.  The movie is very powerful and worth watching.

6381952,4,B00JO9O1WG,"Provocative film about the role of faith and religion in modern society.  The film opens with Father James (Brendan Gleeson)  listening in the confessional to a man who was raped as a small child by a Catholic priest.  The man continues by saying that he will kill Father James in a week's time not because he is a bad priest rather by murdering a good priest the message he is attempting to send society will have greater impact.  Father James' reaction is to maintain a cool head and tend to the needs of his flock and do they ever need tending to.  You couldn't find more dysfunction on ""The Jerry Springer Show"".  This does not deter Father James however because as he sees it Christ served most those whom society deemed most unfit.  ""Calvary"" is an interesting if imperfect film that casts the mirror on both the clergy and its congregants.  The small Irish coastal village depicted in the film serves as a microcosm of the Church as it stands today defined by both clergy and parishioners.  Gleeson's world weary yet doggedly determined take on the modern priest is mesmerizing. Father James is pious but doesn't blanch at profanity or flawed character and isn't opposed to the occasional pint.  If I would fault the film there were moments that teetered on dark comedy that may have been purely intentional if you've seen director John Michael McDonagh and Gleeson's previous collaboration, ""The Guard"", but not always successful and at times the peripheral characters bordered on caricature. I wouldn't call this film heavy handed but the Christ allegory is hard to escape.  Regardless, a thoughtful film that raises a lot of questions that compel the audience to take stock of their convictions.  It should be noted that some of the dialogue on display is quite graphic and there is a depiction of violence that may give pause to the squeamish.  I should also note that I'm a practicing Catholic who's navigated the sex abuse scandals and found the portrayal of my chosen faith to be authentic.",1424563200,4,2004,4.790697674418604

Gleeson is a force in this role, beautifully crafted moments of believability, restraint and sheer dint of will. The excellent script is well served by the supporting cast, (most notably M.Emmett Walsh and Dylan Moran) but it is Gleeson's weary yet undaunted embodiment of an everyman who refuses to flinch that mesmerizes. We learn his backstory in a pub: he was widowed, his grown daughter left for her own troubled life, and he joined the priesthood in midlife where he heads a small parish on the seaside of Sligo. The film covers the one week he has been given to live by a mystery man in the confessional, a survivor of years of sexual abuse by a now dead pedophile priest. The man says he will kill him the following Sunday to atone for the sins of the bad priest not because he deserves it, but because he is a good priest. The gorgeous scenery belies the real difficulties of the individuals living there and the parish priest sees and hears and tries to help in every ugly and heart-wrenching scenario, but without being maudlin, preachy or the least candy-coated.

6381966,5,B00JO9O1WG,"Not for the faint-of-heart. But simply astounding.

Father James (Brendan Gleeson) is hearing confessions when the parishioner on the other side of the screen tells him about five years of childhood abuse at the hands of a bad priest. The man plans to exact revenge by murdering Father James, who is given a week to wind up his affairs. It is a small community and the priest recognizes his parishioner's voice, although that identity is not revealed to the audience. Father James takes no immediate action but spends the week tending to his small flock. They are an erring lot who are flawed, wounded, and deeply critical of Father James, who they verbally flay for the suffering, real and imagined, that they have experienced at the hands of the Catholic Church.

Father James' life is further complicated by his tenuous relationship with his daughter, Fiona. (Father James entered the priesthood after his wife died.) We also see him contrasted with his bishop and a fellow priest, both of whom are not bad men but who are not fully engaged in their vocations. This leaves the audience in the position of trying to suss out the mystery while observing a truly good priest struggle to live his vocation under seemingly impossible circumstances.

Writer and director John Michael McDonagh has given us a layered and nuanced film made for anyone who has ever struggled with faith, forgiveness, betrayal, and revenge. Above all, he looks at the cost to good priests who must struggle with the human fallout and suffering caused by bad ones. Brendan Gleeson, heading up an excellent cast, portrays the good priest with subtlety and depth which allow you to see into his soul as the week progresses.

Some reviews have criticized the villagers as quirky, broad caricatures. I felt that was intentional and that it would be a mistake to think they are intended as realistic personalities. The sharply drawn characters give Calvary the feeling of a morality play where each is a personification of a different sin or modern struggle with religion. Yet McDonagh doesn't allow it to rest there. In each case we are given glimpses, however brief, below the brittle facades to the human beings beneath. The director does not intend to allow us the detachment which has led to the problems his film highlights.

The most fully realized characters and relationship are Father James and Fiona who translate the struggles to live an authentic faith into real human terms for us. The insistence on the value of each person when combined with Father James' absolute integrity are the messages at the core of this movie.

You may see this billed as a dark comedy. I think that is inaccurate. It is a drama, straight up. Yes, there are some lighter moments but that is because life itself has some lighter moments even in the midst of trouble and darkness. It is no comedy.

Fundamentalists of both sorts, from atheist to Catholic, will either celebrate or mourn this movie as an attack on the Catholic Church. That approach is far too simple. Those who know real truth is never that easy will appreciate the way McDonagh shows both sides without setting up straw men to knock down.

The movie never felt like an attack on the Church to me. Instead of looking at the ""evil clergy"" McDonagh took the novel and welcome approach of presenting a good priest who doesn't defend horrific actions of bad men but also never denies his own vocation in the very Church to which they all belong. In fact, the inclusion of an angry Buddhist highlights the point that the problem of authentic faith is not constrained to any one religion but is a matter of each person's cooperation with God and others in their community.

If Calvary makes you uncomfortable, it is meant to do so. That's what the truth does. In this magnificent film we are shown Truth shimmering beneath the surface of a week in the life of this good priest. And given grace for viewers to take back into the world with them.",1424390400,,3964,4.766763848396502

Only rarely have I felt betrayed by a writer/director, but John Michael McDonough is now at the top of that short list. The outstanding acting and production values of Calvary are ultimately put in the service of a deeply cynical conclusion. I mean what else would one call killing off the one caring human being in the whole film, and, in a cheap imitation of a horror flick, showing blood squirting out of the back of his head? And then theres the priests daughter smiling sweetly at her fathers killerwhat is one to make of that?

6381972,5,B00JO9O1WG,"Father James (Brendan Gleeson) is hearing confession when a parishioner reveals he was sexually abused by a priest from the age of seven. He informs him hes going to kill Father James a week from Sunday, as killing an innocent priest is more shocking than killing a bad one. (This isn't a spoilerit happens in the first two minutes.)

The priest then goes about his week as usualmeeting with people, comforting the sick, etc. He does take advice from the local bishop on the situation, though decides himself how to handle it. He settles his daughter (Kelly Reilly), who returns from London for a rest in Ireland after another suicide attempt into his house.

The Father has truly philosophical conversations with a local emergency room doctor (Aiden Gillen) when called in to perform last rites. And does his best to help an aged, possibly dying parishioner, who wishes to end his life on his own terms.

He tries to mediate the marital conflict between Jack Brennan (Chris ODowd) and his wife (Orla ORourke), after she arrives at church with a blackened eye. That situation is more complicated than at first glance; as is everything else in this film.

Another person in the picture is a wealthy new landowner played by Dylan Moran, whose role offers a bit of levity, but its the dark sort of levity at which the Irish excel. There are other moments of humour but the overall tone is a grim one.

Every male becomes suspect to the viewer (Father James says he knows who it is). He vacillates between saving himself and sacrificing himself.

The week carries on with its joys and woesno one else the wiser. The person whos threatened the Father ramps up his campaign of intimidation.

The denouement is tense and startling and satisfactory.

Between the scenes of emotional tension, philosophical conversations and everyday interactions, we are treated to breath-taking shots of beautythe Irish country-side is nearly a character in itself. Which was useful. I cant take anymore! Oh look, a beautiful cliffside.

Many of the characters were stand-ins for the ills of the day. There was the cynical atheist (my personal favourite character), the cynical businessman who cared for nothing but money and whose life now had no meaning, there was a Buddhist, and a woman who embodied the randomness of the universe. In a film about religionabout a man who was choosing to die for his religion, thats pretty thought-provoking.

But perhaps the most important lesson I learned from this film is that, if you decide to watch something based on the cast alone always,  always read a synopsis anyway. I recognised the majority of the cast and, from that, assumed it was going to be a comedy.

Then it was over and it was 2am and I wasn't sure what to do because a person cant go to bed after watching something that heavy.

The Irish take the comedy and tragedy masks far too seriously. Theres a spectrum, my lovelies. Everything isn't either hysterical, goofball comedy, or kill-yourself, lie-facedown-in-a-ditch-after drama.

Always read a synopsis.

Brendan Gleeson played the part of a ""real"" priest. Flawed, yes but ultimately loving enough to lay down his own life for his flock. He was there for them without being overbearing or fake. Father wades through his own Calvary on the last week of his life, pressing on through issues of pain and suffering in his town. The people are clearly miserable in their sinfulness. Intimate moments with each, whether they ultimately decide to accept help or not, are touching in some way. I couldn't help but wonder what they would experience knowing that the one they ridiculed was dead. Would they miss him? Could they feel the hole left without the priest to beat up on anymore? Would their sins ultimately engulf them in despair or would it be the impetus to about face? I just finished it and already I can tell it will continue with me for some time.

6381978,4,B00JO9O1WG,"Brendan Gleeson stars as an Irish priest facing the threat of imminent execution from an unknown assailant in this powerful film.  For years, the few films being produced have been brainless prequels, sequels and remakes of ""franchised properties.""  Here is a film which suffers from a few clichs of its own, but remains the first worthwhile English-language film to come out in many years.

This film submerges the viewer in its small-town Irishness.  The director uses spectacular scenery to its fullest extent, echoing the bleakly haunting story.  The priest has a week to undergo his own ""Calvary,"" facing severe tests of his own faith from a village of disillusioned and cynical people. The film deals with a society which was melancholy before, but has had enough following accusations of pedophilia among the clergy.  As a resolutely good man, Gleeson's character endures severe abuse from his flock, while trying to rekindle faith in them.

The film follows the format of earlier books and films about a good man bearing the moral burden of his community - the film ""High Noon"" is mentioned in the extras - but it does it exceptionally well.  Since it is also a ""Who'll do it?"" mystery, some of its disgruntled community are ""red herrings.""

6381982,4,B00JO9O1WG,"I rented this film thinking it was a quirky murder mystery.  It is not a murder mystery.  ""Calvary"" is a philosophical examination of Fatalism  versus free will.  It is more morality play than anything else.  It is an interesting presentation of the debate, though it goes on a bit long, and in the end the lead actor in the narrative (the priest) clearly sides with the Fatalists.  In this film history is prologue to the present moment. Time has no future and thus no hope.  Predestination is the venue for salvation. All the characters are resigned to the machinery of human nature and enjoy a repeating cycle of pleasures and pains they seem incapable of escaping until death takes them.  God is simply a reference point for their circumstances.  Any effort on the part of the priest to suggest otherwise, to open up a venue that breaks into the supernatural, is immediately met with disrespect. He is the failed catalyst for ending the ironies of living they are resigned to enjoy, and in the end, he too succumbs to the inevitability of the world in motion, embracing an assassin's bullet.

I enjoyed this movie, but it is probably not everybody's cup of Irish tea.  It is a slow moving agony of sorts.

Your stomach drops, your palms get sweaty and every time that someone says hey, can we talk you just know; its the end.

Now, imagine that you not only knew what that bad thing was, but you knew exactly when it was going to happen.

Calvary is one of those films that starts with a scene so jarring, so emotionally harrowing that you're almost convinced that the tone set with obliterate your soul, but the way that John Michael McDonagh shapes this complex morality/spirituality tale is so effortless and so controlled that it literally sits comfortably on the viewer from frame to frame.  This is a hard film to digest, because it is so controversially spun, and yet it is an easy (or at least easier than one should expect it to be) film to swallow.

But Im telling you, that opening scene sent shivers from one end of my body to the other and really, it alone should have earned Brendan Gleeson (whos never been better) an Oscar nomination.

In that opening scene, Father James is informed, through the confession booth, that he is going to die.  He is going to be sacrificed as a bold statement against all those Catholic priests who have taken advantage, sexually, of young boys.  His murderer himself was abused, horrifically, and wants justice to be served.  The thing is, Father James is an innocent man, and this murderer knows this.  But wouldnt the murder of an innocent priest make more of a statement, a cautionary impact, than the murder of a man everyone knew was corrupt?  So, with just a few days of life left to live, Father James goes about his business.  He doesnt want to burden the ones he loves most, and so for the most part he keeps his impending death a secret and just continues with his commission.  He continues to make himself an integral part of his small seaside community, extending his hand to those in need and waiting out the inevitability of his future as he contemplates the man at the end of the gun.

Calvary cuts.  It beautifully rests in this place that feels so natural and honest and so human and so when we watch Father James mediate through his day, we feel a part of his life, a part of his soul, and we understand him.  We collect the information of his past and of his emotional frailties and we begin to understand the construction of his present self, which makes this man so relatable.  He isn't just a figment, a fraction of a being, an ideal with no name; but Father James is a man, an honest man, a man trying to be what he promised himself hed become because of the man he used to be and longs to forget.

And this is where Calvary becomes more than just another movie about the Catholic Church and their history with child abuse.

Yes, child abuse is mentioned more than once, and the allegations that continue to swarm the church are used as ammo against an honest man and his vocation, but at the core of Calvary lies something more; a feeling of universal failings and the encroaching corrosion of sin and guilt.  Father James, a man who was, for all intents and purposes, completely innocent of the crime he was being punished for, was not an innocent man, at least not in his own eyes, and being confronted with this act of essential martyrdom brought flooding back to him the unsettling realization that no matter how hard you may try and dress up your mistakes, hiding them behind a title and a robe, you can never fully escape your past mistakes.  Father James was a good man.  We watched him as he bonded with his daughter and reached out to those in the community in clear need and heard out the cries from those in clear pain and we saw the genuineness in his face as he took in their circumstance, but we also saw that the damage had been done.  He had been reminded.  He had been outed, so-to-speak, and because of that he would forever be doomed to his inevitable.

Calvary has so many interesting things to say about faith, about our past mistakes and our own willingness of forgive or to persecute ourselves, regardless of where we are on our current path, and how much faith can or cant fix those things for us.

Just contemplate the decision Father James makesabout his own life.

Gleeson's range as a truly fine actor demonstrates itself in this intimate portrait of a small Irish town with all the struggles of the individuals who live there. Gleeson is a priest with some of his own personal struggles but is, ultimately, a good and honourable man who genuinely wants to help people find their way.

Paul Byrnes in the Sydney Morning Herald well described Gleeson's role as ""the one good man in a town of jackals"" - the relentless vitriol and mockery spat at him by various village types is matched by their own astonishing, preternatural candour - no feelings are spared in this story. The whole tone reflects an Irish ambivalence vis--vis organized religion, its utility and its scars. Example - Dylan Moran, as the guilt laden, lonely financier, urinates on Holbein's The Ambassadors (hopefully not the original). Perhaps fittingly, the only one to share the condemned man's warmth for faith is a visitor from France. Great performance by Gleeson and the cast are all fine.",1421020800,2,868,5.119718309859155

6382010,4,B00JO9O1WG,"This grotesquely black film actually managed to draw copious tears from me at the end-- which quite shocked me. As an atheist, I was dreading sitting through yet another film about religion, but a friend insisted I watch it (it's alright, I made him watch the 2014 New Zealand ghost story, Housebound, which he loved so much he watched twice, and which like Calvary, is also about lost childhoods). I won't be watching Calvary twice, but, as another reviewer mentioned, it's not the sort of film one usually subjects oneself too more than once, because it is too real.

A religious allegory of Christ, it thankfully works on a deeply secular level as well, as I saw it as a dark and twisted alleyway of the consequences of lost innocence. The murderer must avenge the death of his childhood (a bravura performance by Chris O'Dowd from the stateside comedy Bridesmaids!) by killing another innocent person, as he was killed. And the victim lets him do it, because he believes, if he is honest with himself, that he is complicit by his emotional detachment to the true horror that surrounds him and his chosen profession of the priesthood. The film is at its heart a bleak examination of the spiritual void left by the church's inaction towards its own corruption, which unfortunately, all religions share.

It is hardcore, so be forewarned. But it is also heartfelt. No spoonful of sugar to help this jagged little truth pill go down, down, deeper down.",1420588800,2,1452,4.780876494023905

6382038,3,B00JO9O1WG,"Looking at the rest of the reviews, I apparently stand in the minority. I didn't get it.

What I got was a slow story that had a lot of potential, but meandered along. The plot is that a good priest gets a death threat from a small town community member during confession. The confessor says that his motive is revenge for his childhood abuse. He can't hurt the one who hurt him because he's dead. He thinks that revenge would be sweeter if he attacks a good priest. The murderer tells him to put his affairs in order. He will come for him in a week. The rest of the movie follows the priest for that week.

It says it's a comedy. I found nothing funny about any of this.

It sort of seems like a mystery, but you can see somewhat in a confessional. Not only that, but in a small town, you will know everyone by their voice. So, there shouldn't have been much of a mystery as to who the attacker is, but we spend the movie waiting to find out.

The random events of the week seem unfocused and bizarre. My reaction to much of was, ""Okay, that happened. So what?"" or ""How odd."" It didn't really move the story along, give it any emotional depth, or help me to understand the people or the situation better.

I like slow movies if they are purposeful. This didn't seem that way to me. That said, the acting was good. If you are on the fence, I'd say try it. You may get more out of it than I did. It wasn't horrible. It just didn't live up to the potential.",1420070400,2,1455,4.127208480565371

The characters each had very obvious and disturbing aspects to their personalities that seemed un-natural.  Usually such plots are counter balanced with placid types who could keep the ambiance from appearing psychotic.

But as portrayed in this movie, the beautiful idyllic, coastal setting of Ireland near Sligo, was in sharp contrast with its stressed inhabitants.  One of the most disturbing, and peculiar acts, occurred when a country gentleman desecrates his manor's 16th c. Holbein painting.  Though that's a minor violation to some compared to other acts, the point is clear that the afflictions of contemporary society are universal and timeless, even in remote escapist, postcard-pretty settings.

But, all in all, the movie is worth watching, mainly because of the fine acting of Brendan Gleeson, whose portrayal of the village priest is exceptionally convincing.  The rest of the movie could leave you with memories of an attractive, Irish postcard setting of a place you'd like to visit, as long as you could avoid the locals.",1419724800,5,1133,5.226519337016574
6382061,5,B00JO9O1WG,"This is a magnificent, achingly lovely movie. I'd feared subtle religious proselytizing or another cheap formulaic drama about church corruption, but Calvary is all about the lonely dignity of one profoundly good man, quietly persevering in a sad, crass and cynical world. It's a tragedy, but Gleeson's performance is so uncompromisingly fine that it's the priest's quiet, craggy luminosity of character that takes the day. He's simply huge. The landscape is dreamy and gritty, the townspeople are almost mythical in their various moral unravelings, and the somewhat predictable arc of the passion play theme is satisfyingly complicated by a dark and very contemporary humor.

The institutionalized abuse of children by clergy needs to be confronted, and this film does exactly that. The director is not dismissing faith, but rather is dramatizing people's struggle with it, and without it, as well as some of the base compromises that some clergy have made. The priest protagonist is a Christ-like figure who is to die for the sins of others, and who faces this with immense honesty and integrity.  He follows his vocation to the end, and in doing so, sets up a human  as well as spiritual ideal that most of us can only dream about, no matter how observant we may be. It's saddening to see how the priesthood has fallen in the eyes of its flock, but Gleeson's character is nothing short of redemptive.  The secondary characters in all their humanness are intriguing, the production values of the film are beautiful; in short, this is a fine and thought provoking movie that's well worth a repeat viewing.",1419292800,3,1086,4.640625

6382092,2,B00JO9O1WG,"I went to a preview screening with its star and director present, finding in the discussion afterward that there wasn't any grappling with theology behind the scenes (in other words, actual faith is lacking in this production's motivations). So, for example, even if it feels meaningful for the priest to be dressed in a traditional cassock, in reality, the overwhelming impression is that it was aesthetic opportunism: ""he looks dark and menacing in that robe, let's use it!"" Moreover, the basis of the film is an utterly humanistic point of view, less interested in forgiveness for those grossly cliched rural Irish peccadilloes, moreso contemporary outrage as usual against conservative judgment, advocating unquestioning tolerance in its place. In other words, accountability is totally outside of this world, while the priest goes about grumbling indecisively, deeply tormented with doubt, and a loss of faith. And the larger picture too is that the filmmakers primarily found their motivation in that headline-grabbing, dramatically easy, priest child abuse scandal afflicting the Roman Catholic church continuously (with sin altogether, because humanity is imperfect). If we take a big step back and see this film as a whole, it is really a sort of Tarantino-inspired carnal delight at seeing bloody, violent chaos ensue as the ultimate murderer is avenging his childhood molestation. Using all the tools of dramatic manipulation available in cinematic storytelling, we are led to cheer, concluding that homicidal vengeance is an reasonable consequence of the other sin. From a faithless humanist's point of view, if people would just stop judging and being so hypocritical, we wouldn't be ""forced"" to retaliate: because we are naturally good. And the priest's function is restricted to tolerance of the perfect human inside. That makes everything easier. Simply put, this was not a film for Catholics to celebrate -- and what an unfortunate twist if they get fooled by its intentions.",1418515200,,1992,5.387820512820513

6382106,4,B00JO9O1WG,"Calvary is a layered movie anchored by a fine performance from Irish actor, Brendan Gleeson. Gleeson has appeared in many high profile films like the Harry Potter series, Gangs of New York, and most recently this years Edge of Tomorrow. Yet it is with his smaller films (The General, In Bruges) that he has been able to give his greatest performances. That trend continues with Calvary.

Calvary is the second of a planned trio of films directed by John Michael McDonagh that star Gleeson; the first being 2011s The Guard. These films are not connected by character, plot, or even tone. But they are related thematically. In Calvary, Gleeson plays Father James, the priest of a small village parish in Western Ireland. The film opens with Father James hearing confession from a mysterious parishioner who in the midst of confessing a tortuous childhood at the hands of an abusive priest, reveals that he is going to murder Father James because his abuser is already dead and that murdering a good priest will be a bigger story. He concludes by summoning James to meet him the following Sunday for his execution. The film then becomes a whos-gonna-do-it as it chronicles Father Jamess week as he interacts with a host of characters all with a seemingly bitter view towards the Catholic Church or religion in general, and consequently are all suspects. Ironically, many of these characters have rational reasons for their negative perspectives on Catholicism, God, and religion, yet James is by far the most likable character. And yet James himself is not an average priest. An alcoholic, he joined the priesthood later in life and has a suicidal daughter (Kelly Reilly) whom he looks after, all of this accentuated by the looming threat over his life. As the film progresses, we become less focused on Father Jamess fearful situation and more on the individuals surrounding him. While the identity of the threat is engaging, it is not particularly difficult to figure out, nor is it entirely important who it actually is.

Instead, as Father James goes about his week, the film becomes a sort of Canterbury Tales for the modern age. All of the characters James interacts with have a revealing story that reflects their status in society and that status is tempered with varying levels of sinful behavior. These questionable characters (the Atheist Doctor, the rich and corrupt ex-banker, the lustful housewife just to name a few) all invite the viewer to ponder the seven deadly sins during Father Jamess appropriately poetic seven day journey to his supposed imminent death.

Thus, McDonagh has a rich, textured film here that is open to interpretation and with every question it answers, it poses a new one in its place. Ultimately, a microcosm is formed that revolves around a virtuous central character and as we watch him break down we cant help but fear for ourselves. McDonagh enhances this discomfort with abrupt scene transitions that surprise us, make us wince, and keep us on guard. Calvary is a film that actually yearns to be preachy, and while what it preaches is not entirely clear youll be engrossed anyway. B+

He plays Father James who is told in the opening scene that while he was not the one that had sexually abused a man in his youth, he would be killed the next Sunday on the beach.  Killing an innocent priest was what the man wanted to do for revenge.  The movie follows Father James for the next week as he deals with his parishioners and problems.  Many look like the possible killer and all have major hangups.  He had been married and when his wife passed away he became a priest.

6382111,5,B00JO9O1WG,"The relationship of a priest and his congregation may be similar to a therapist and his/her clients.  Both confessions take place in a small, private area, it's assumed that the exchange is confidential, and when it is breached or betrayed, the results are especially damaging.  In the opening scene of ""Calvary,"" Brendan Gleeson's Father James listens concerned as a man confesses that he was repeatedly raped by a priest as a child.  Even worse, the man believes that closure is best achieved by him killing an ""innocent priest,"" meaning Gleeson a week from that day on a local beach.

Gleeson consults a colleague who urges him to take action, but although he believes he knows the voice, wavers in whether or not to report the man to the authorities.  The film takes place over a week-long period (the viewer is kept aware of when time is passing, resulting in anticipatory tension, although there is much drama in the exchanges between Gleeson and the people in his Irish parish). An elderly writer (M. Emmet Walsh) wants Gleeson to procure a gun for him so that he may die with dignity when the time comes.  Others are struggling with drug use, domestic violence and adultery.  In addition, Gleeson's character is also dealing with his adult daughter (Kelly Reilly) who is staying with him after a suicide attempt.  None of those whom he counsels, with the possible exception of his daughter, seem to be helped much by his efforts.  A series of unfortunate events which are clearly aimed at Gleeson personally occur.  As Gleeson goes about his life, he must decide what to do when his own Judgment Day arrives.

Gleeson gives a chilling and impressive performance for which I hope he receives an Oscar nomination.  The movie raises provocative questions about faith and the changing role of religion in today's world.  This was an uncomfortable film to watch, but an intriguing one nonetheless.",1410480000,4,1900,4.881619937694704

To Christians, Calvary is the hill that the Christ was crucified on; the place where a good and innocent man was overcome by evil.

The lush and gorgeous Irish landscape is the canvas, the players a troupe of diverse and brilliant actors, the playwright is John Michael McDonough, a man whose heart is as pitch black as it is brilliant. The lead is Brendan Gleeson, leading with a performance so subtle, incredible and complex it must rank among cinema's finest.

Calvary is not an easy film to watch, but neither is it overly difficult. Thought-provoking but never preachy, moving but never sappy, funny but never forced, real but never gritty, Calvary is a moving discourse on the nature of a shepherd, forgiveness, and goodness in the face of evil.

The emotional range required of Gleeson is enormous, but he embodies the character with such ease that the result is never forced, but beautifully rendered, gripping, and powerful. If this performance isn't Oscar worthy, I don't know what is.

His directing is gorgeous, his framing impeccable. His film Calvary is gripping and complex, powerful and filled with pain.

You may have seen him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guard/dp/B006SV27C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guard</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B0012GE91W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>, but to truly see the fathomless depths of his acting talent, watch his performance as Father James. In the role of Father James, Gleeson is truly mesmerizing, at once tender, dark, and heavy with the weight of the world. The emotional range required of Gleeson is enormous, but he embodies the character with such ease that the result is never forced, but beautifully rendered, gripping, and powerful. If this performance isn't Oscar worthy, I don't know what is.

The rest of the cast has such a calibre it's scary.

The result is a film filled with subtle, thought-provoking, and wickedly good performances.

But perhaps the most credit goes to director John Michael McDonough, a man who makes me proud to be an Irishman. And yes, I am really an Irishman. His script is deep and dark, funny and ferocious. His directing is gorgeous, his framing impeccable. His film Calvary is gripping and complex, powerful and filled with pain. Its a story of a good priest in a town that doesn't want God, the story of a man on an inevitable path to violence, a story of breaking points, forgiveness, reality, and Christianity. It's also one of the years finest films. Five stars.",1410480000,139,3288,6.675233644859813
6382114,5,B00JO9O1WG,"Written and directed by John Michael McDonagh (The Guard), Calvary is a small independent Irish film that deals with a current-day village priest who's facing a number of dilemmas in his life, foremost of which is a confession by one of his parishioners that he plans to kill him in one week.

The film begins with Father James (Brendan Gleeson) hearing confession. At first the confession seems routine enough, until the man confessing informs Father James that, because he was molested by a priest as a child, he intends to kill him even though James is not the one who molested him and he knows that Father James is actually a good priest, his logic being that the murder of a good priest will draw more attention than the murder of a bad one. The confessor tells James that he has one week to put his affairs in order, after which he will come and kill him.

The movie the unfolds in an episodic fashion, with each day of the seven he's been give being an episode where we learn about James and about the people in the village that is his parish. And the challenges facing him besides the death sentence he's now living under. For one thing, his daughter comes to visit after recently attempted suicide. Unlike most priests, James was married before entering the priesthood and in fact only became a priest after his wife died, and his daughter, Fiona (Kelly Reilly) has deep-rooted resentment over this, feeling that he abandoned her when he became a priest. For another, his assistant priest, Father Leary (David Wilmot) is something of a vapid suck-up whose faith runs no deeper than the material of his cassock, leading a frustrated James at one point to ask him why he ever became a priest in the first place.

And then there are James's parishioners, most of whom generally regard him with less than positive feeling, some with condescension and contempt, others with cynicism and even anger. None of them seem to feel that James - or the church - is relevant to them. In truth the only ones who seem to want to see him are an aging and ailing writer (M. Emmett Walsh) who wants James to get him a gun so he can kill himself to avoid facing a long and debilitating end, and a young former parishioner named Freddie Joyce (Domhnall Gleeson) who's now on death row for murder and just wants someone to talk to.

As we watch James' interactions with these people, we see his inner struggles. How does one keep faith when the very people you're supposed to be keeping it for have no use for it?  And is that faith worth facing death for, when the safe and sane course would be to simply leave, something that James is sorely tempted to do, particularly when it seems that no one in the parish has a use for him?

Highly recommended.",1409961600,7,2738,4.5212121212121215

6382116,5,B00JO9O1WG,"Set over a period of seven days (the time it took for God to create the world), CALVARY can be viewed on one level as a detective story, as we try to discover the identity of the man who vows to kill the Priest (Brendan Gleeson) in revenge for the man's abuse during his childhood by another member of the Catholic Church.  There are two or three likely suspects, including rich dilettante Michael Fitzgerald (Dylan Moran), aggressive bartender Brendan Lynch (Pat Shortt), and a police inspector (Gary Lydon) with more than a passing disrespect for his fellow officers.  At the end the person's identity is revealed in a climactic sequence taking place on a deserted beach.

At a deeper level, however, the film invites us to speculate on the nature of ""good,"" and whether it has any place in today's overtly secular world.  The Priest has taken up his vocation in later life, given up alcohol, and dedicates himself to helping members of the small Sligo community he inhabits.  Some of its members actively solicit his advice, such as prisoner Freddie Joyce (played by Gleeson's real-life son Domhnall; others, such as butcher's wife Veronica (Orla O'Rourke) believe themselves to be irredeemable, and take a savage pleasure in telling the Priest.  The Priest learns to take such criticisms on the chin, but the knowledge that he might be plowing a lonely moral furrow renders him an isolated person: even in the local bar (where he goes for company), he cuts a lonely figure, sitting on his own and largely ignored by his fellow-villagers.

Of perhaps more significance, however, is writer/ director John Michael McDonagh's handling of the relationship between the Priest and his daughter Fiona (Kelly Reilly).  Initially it seems as if the Priest can handle Fiona's emotional difficulties, as he tries to help her negotiate a botched attempt at suicide.  As the action unfolds, however, we understand that the Priest has himself been at least partially responsible for his daughter's problems; following his wife's death, he entered the Church without really considering the effect his decision might have on Fiona's future.  The two forgive each other, but McDonough shoots the scene as a series of slow shot/ reverse shots, suggesting some kind of lingering alienation between the two.  They subsequently communicate with one another by telephone only: the Priest stands on the beach while Fiona speaks from a Thameside caf; neither of them really able to relate to one another.

While McDonagh makes several references to the seamier side of the Catholic Church - notably its history of child abuse - he is more interested in exploring how such incidents prejudice people's views.  The Priest meets a young girl (Annabel Sweeney) and jokes with her as they both walk down a lonely country road; their conversation is interrupted by her furious father (Declan Conlon) who abuses the Priest and bundles the girl into his car.  McDonagh tracks backwards, showing the girl imprisoned behind the car windows, while the Priest stares helplessly at her.  Both are left isolated, the innocent victims of hearsay and rumor.

Beautifully shot in the wilds of Sligo in the Irish Republic, CALVARY is first and foremost a study in isolation; the customers standing waiting for something to happen in the bar; the lonely parishioner seeking counsel from the Priest in a deserted church; and the Priest and Fiona walking the beach and/or the rocky seaside landscapes.  The film ends with a series of close-ups of landscape views, including a stone which according to local myth has the power to kill people.  Perhaps the characters aren't as free to choose their destinies as they they think they are - especially members of the Church.  God may direct them, but there could be other forces restricting their actions.

The film is an absolute gem - beautifully acted and photographed, with a soundtrack comprising a series of songs that underline the film's contrasting moods (I especially liked the choice of Roger Whittaker's ""New World in the Morning,"" and Flanagan and Allen's wartime classic ""Run, Rabbit Run.""",1409702400,,4107,5.038404726735598
6382117,5,B00JO9O1WG,"The quality of this movie surpasses most of today's movies for several reasons:  a strong dramatic plot intersected by continuously unfolding bizarre but wholly realistic sidelines, convincing main characters, clean cinematography, haunting scenes from a particular Irish locale, and the poignant portrayal of a complex situation in today's world, namely the plight of the Christian faith against internal and external antagonists:  pedophile priests who have terribly eroded the confidence of Ireland's Catholics and various contemporary social types floundering in amoral and immoral life-situations.

It wasn't until near the very end when I realized that the protagonist - Father James - was walking a veritable Via Crucis, modelling the passion narrative of Jesus as found in the gospels.  This is a very disturbing movie.  It lays open the fatal wound of the priesthood, the Church, and religion in general and yet authentic faith can still be found in some:  the martyred priest, his daughter who carries on the work of her deceased father, a young widow, and perhaps others...  In the end it is a hopeful story.

I base my review on a cinema experience.  It is disappointing that the only available DVD is Region 2 -- not for U.S. viewing.  I hope this will be remedied in the future.",1409443200,7,1292,5.138755980861244

8652586,5,B00JO9O1WG,"In a time in Australia and also worldwide when the church is finally confronting the sheer scale and ugliness of the sex abuse scandal, this film by Gleeson is a timely reminder of the terrible trials the church has to face if it is to gain any respect back from the society and laity it has so terribly failed.  The plot of this film is simple enough - it begins with the priest in the film (played by Gleeson) in a dark confessional listening to a man who claims he was abused as a child by a priest and who wants revenge.  As the priest who abused him is dead, he demands the death of another priest in his place and threatens to kill Gleeson.

The rest of the film unfolds from this point, depicting the widespread loss of faith in a Post-Christian Ireland, as depicted by the somewhat chaotic social and sexual mores of the people Gleeson's character meets, including a woman in a casual sexual relationship with an African immigrant, a man dominated by greed to the point where he destroys a valuable artwork by simply urinating on it, and also his alienated daughter who tries to reconcile by visiting him.

The film is deeply dark and tragic, as the ending and also several other scenes (such as a terrified parent snatching a child away from the priest and the burning down of the local church) show.  Yet the film's uncompromising stand in my view perfectly captures everything wrong with the church that led to the crisis in the first place.  Perhaps the most poignant scene is where Gleeson's character meets with the local Bishop to discuss his death threat - the Bishop is aloof, indifferent and seemingly unconcerned as he meets Gleeson's character in the comfort of his relatively large and ornate Episcopal residence.  He dismisses Gleeson with some vague advice and admonitions but seems both unaware and unconcerned to face the danger to his pastor or address the events that caused it to begin with.  Sadly, such aloof clericalism is still very common in just about every church today.

The film finishes with a predictable bleak note, but also offers a tiny ray of hope in the sense that at the end, a person is given a choice to take a certain path, and yet even after making a decisive choice for evil over goodness, reconciliation and redemption are still offered.  The poignant and open ending offer what I think is a deeply Catholic sense of hope for the future, which should not be closed and complete and finished (as many seem to want it to be) but that even in the darkest of times, there is a way forward.  It is perhaps this lesson the church needs if it is to move forward into the future from its present crisis.

The film is powerful and riveting and should also be watched in conjunction with the award-winning 'Spotlight.'",1519862400,,2759,4.585365853658536

8652588,4,B00JO9O1WG,"A film that imposes itself on its audience; in other words, you cant help but find yourself debating it long after you watch it. Its a movie lacking in realism by its narrative aesthetics, so Calvary is most stimulating when addressed as a morality tale of the righteous humble prevailing through a brooding secular world. 100 minutes of one man being taunted, mocked, and attacked.  Could this be an allegory of the current state of Catholicism? Or what it means to be Catholic? Or perhaps, if you remove religion  you have a commentary on human decency. The uncomfortable notion of no human decency, lack of respect; do we really want a world where nothing is sacred? What statement is it to kill an innocent man for a crime against the innocent? Is this justice or evil permeating within our conscious?",1514419200,,805,4.742857142857143

8652590,5,B00JO9O1WG,"Calvary is that rare time a director doesn't have a sophomore slump. After making The Guard, John Michael McDonaugh like most writer/directors decided to try something different for his second movie. Instead of a wild story about a reprobate who just sort of ends up doing good in-spite of himself and his flaws, he tells the story of a good man having to deal with the flaws of everyone else who are trying their best to drag him back into his own.

It's not the Hallmark movie that the dvd cover would give you with Brendan Gleeson and Kelly Reilly looking off into the distance with a lovely country side behind them. The movie is more like Graham Greene's novel A Burnt Out Case or a particularly bleak Shusaku Endo novel. Books where people find their character and faith tested in ways that are a lot more brutal than just being hit with rocks. Their trials involve deep psychological and emotional attacks. The main plot driver here is a rough one. Brendan Gleeson is told he will be killed by a man he knows because he's a good priest and he thinks it'll draw proper attention to child sex abuse in the Catholic church. Gleeson isn't sure if he's joking, just mouthing off in anger, or he's dead serious. What happen's next is him trying to attend to daily church work, which funnily enough he does actual church work, while trying to figure out if he's going to be killed and if he should just give up and go somewhere else. Basically, will he stay true to his faith or not.

It's a genuinely great movie that never makes the mistake of talking down to it's audience or holding them in contempt. I really really enjoyed it. It's not light viewing but it's well worth it.",1511568000,2,1679,4.483660130718954
