8366028,5,B002DU39FI,This movie is pretty good. i was suprised to see a list actors in a b list movie. i think if it wasn't for thomas jane and ron pearlman this movie would of stunk. and i was surprised they got john malkovich to do such a small part. i don't recall this movie being in theaters. it was good for what it was. i was entertained they did a good job. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.,1361404800,,401,3.8433734939759034
