4230545,5,B003YKVGME,"We have all the Sid the Science Kid DVD's and my five year old loves them all, he is always quoting things that he has learnt from watching them.  My 10 year old daughter also likes to watch them, but she doesn't like to admit it!",1304812800,,230,4.0
4230546,5,B003YKVGME,"I use Sid The Science Kid as a teaching tool in my Kindergarten science class. My students love it and are highly engaged.
This is an excellent DVD. I use it after I have taught the five senses to expand on the concepts of touch, sight, hearing,
smell and taste. Sid brings these concepts down to my students level and explains them in a real world application. (Sid's world)
I would not recommend using these programs for children older than maybe early 7 as they start to loose there appeal due to
simplified content and seem to be too predictable for older viewers.",1297728000,5,568,4.524271844660194

4230570,5,B003YKVGME,"This DVD is all about the 5 senses and why/how they work the way they do.  My kids have loved Sid the Science Kid since he came out on TV and now my 2-year old is addicted ""Science Kid, Science Kid"" she chants.  All the information is imparted in kid-friendly terms and then at the end Sid takes it into the fantastical by the whole ""If I were in charge"" segment.

4230576,5,B003YKVGME,"I am first a mom and second a school teacher.  I am always looking for educational videos for my toddler to watch and these SID the Science kid videos are fantastic!!!  The characters are colorful and fun to watch and they use a fantastic vocabulary.  They encourage viewers to ask questions and tell them why certain things are important.  My sister also bought some other series of the same video (on my recommendation)and they are all wonderful.  I was having a lot of trouble getting my toddler to allow me to brush his teeth until he saw ""Feeling Good"" out of the other series.  Now he always wants to brush his teeth so that he doesn't get holes in his teeth.",1327190400,,665,4.454545454545454

8409567,5,B003YKVGME,Love the graphics and the lessons taught.  Saw this series at a friends house earlier this year with her two year old and we both had a blast watching them.  Jim Henson is always a win in my book.  Especially as it encourages kids to ask questions about the world around them.  I bought a bunch of these for my 2 yr old niece and she's having a blast being introduced to Sid and his crew.  Fun & Educational to boot too!!!,1482278400,,422,4.097560975609756
