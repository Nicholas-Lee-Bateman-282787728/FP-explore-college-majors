5890596,3,B00E4V0AA6,Interesting because the realistic animation ... but I'm not into humor about serious subjects like a mission to Mars. To me astronauts would be dedicated to the mission and not have ho-hum attitudes like the characters did in this movie.

5890606,4,B00E4V0AA6,"I love sci-fi, especially campy sci-fi, and I love cartoons, but even I almost stopped watching this at first. I've never really seen this style and my brain couldn't decide if this was a cartoon or live action. It's a weird hybrid of both, but after about 20 minutes I got used to it and really enjoyed it. Same thing with the acting: it seemed painfully awkward and amateur, but the deadpan, satirical humor started to shine through and by the end I actually loved the characters.
It's an odd mix: Some scenes, especially when they show the spacecraft, seem truly realistic, but most often the ""science"" is embarrassingly bad, but that's part of the charm. (No, we don't have an EVA suit on the ship, but how about a dip in the olympic-size pool?!)
If Mel Brooks tried to make a low-budget, anime version of ""The Martian"", it might look something like this.

5890626,3,B00E4V0AA6,"It's a cute flick, featuring hipster slackers in space.  The budget is nearly non-existent.  A mix of live action, roto-scoping, and animation done in Photoshop.  The ""science"" is absolutely ridiculous in many parts, but it tells a story... sort of.

Basically, the people that exist in the world/space this film portrays, seem to have stopped excelling at things. But there are still individuals that want to do... something... and be remembered for being slightly more than ""adequate"".  The film also shows that dreams can be pursued and achieved if you put some effort into it.  Not TOO much effort, mind you.  Just enough to be noticed.

It's worth a watch.  Seeing it won't change lives, there aren't really any especially quotable lines, and the trip to Mars won't inspire feelings of greatness... but it's a decent way to spend 1 hour and 22 minutes of your life.",1430265600,2,870,4.863945578231292

5890639,3,B00E4V0AA6,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but the slow pace held it back as did the disappointing treatment of the last quarter of the film.  This movie is much more about the interpersonal relationships between the astronauts than it is about the exploration and their amazing discovery (which received short shrift) of Mars, which was rather disappointing.  The film overall was saved by the well-drawn (ha ha) and rounded characters but it would have been better if there had been far more focus on and reaction to their Mars landing and exploration.  Yes the landing results were amusing and intriguing but it was too little too late. And while up to that point the characters interacted and sounded like real people, their lack of enthusiasm and response to their Mars landing felt very off-kilter.  Up until that point it had been a very well-written and intriguing film with some light comedy tossed in here and there.  So--a mixed review.",1421020800,,936,4.89873417721519

5890657,3,B00E4V0AA6,"Fact is, we've seen plenty of really big-budget sci-fi films over the last couple of decades that aren't even as good as this film. Not that this one's great...just saying'. :)

In this rotoscope-animated feature, Charlie is assigned as the third crew member, along with Casey and Hank, to fly a mission to Mars, in a sort of 21st century space race. They are preceded by the lost Beagle II lander, and a follow-up robot with sophisticated autonomous programming, the first independent decision of which is to alter its landing course so as to arrive closer to the Beagle's location. Most of the manned flight to the planet is downright boring, but ground-control meddling results in some tense moments on arrival.

Throughout the mission, Charlie gradually redeems his lousy first impression on Casey and Hank, as we learn more about all three astronauts.

It's more of a character story than sci-fi. Most of the science is so bad, you just have to set aside critical thinking. Ironically, the two biggest miscues -- microbes in someone's spittle achieving billions of years of evolution in just a dozen, give or take, and a space-walk scene bereft of accurate physics -- were completely unnecessary to the story. Entirely plausible, alternative devices could have been used. But once you do set aside your critical thinking, the story itself and the rest of the execution are entertaining.

I assume that the rotoscoping was done for budgetary reasons, rather than some specific artistic design. Because I can't say that the effect is particularly informative or contributory to the film. But it was done reasonably well, and allowed for some funny background gems. All part of the charm of the movie.",1411171200,,1703,4.985915492957746
5890658,5,B00E4V0AA6,"Extraterrestrial anthropologists visiting Earth in future centuries, discovering no artifact besides American film and television from 1980 and beyond, would certainly conclude that the human race is chiefly a race of tactless, defensive wisecrackers who are always at each others' throats and have very little time for love or passion, just sex, jealousy, tearfulness and downright hostility.
But occasionally a true tender gem would show up like the wonderful movie Mars. There's a warmth radiating from the core of this movie that tells you everyone was having the time of their lives making it. The plot centers on three astronauts and two inadvertently sentient space probes, all of them refreshingly endearing. There's never a moment when a man disrespects a woman, nor a moment when a woman takes a jab at a man's ego. One of the astronauts, a master of the allegedly obsolete art of space walking, is constantly disparaging himself, and the his two colleagues unfailingly try to buck him up. There's a scene where two of the astronauts declare their love for each other by urinating messages  into the Martian sand, and there's no ""ick"" in it at all.
You can tell that this is a movie created by people who love outer space, the golden era of American space exploration, and the searches for intelligent life we undertake with space probes, radio dishes, and also our own terrestrial senses as we approach, encounter, and connect with each other in this amazing life.",1408838400,,1475,4.995934959349594

It was a movie about space programs, space travel & a peopled mission on mars, so that to me, at least, qualifies it as sci-fi.  I thought the idea of some guy's snot creating life on mars was pretty funny & a nice touch.  The only thing that way past my normal suspension of disbelief was the size of the the space ship's living quarters & the pool.  Seemed more like a space colony than a space ship!  (Looked a lot like the space colonies on early Gundam animes, too.)  Also the sewing machine, though that was part of a story line thread that ran throughout the movie.  The TV interviewers reminded me of The Hunger Games & the constantly changing hair styles on the astronauts were hilarious (although again, way past even slightly believable).  I was  glad for the happy ending, too.  I had thought the 'alien identifier' would nuke the planet when it identified 'intelligent' life, but it didn't (guess that shows how much I think of the American government!).  It was a humorous, leave you feeling good, light-hearted movie.  The bit during the credits where they showed some of the 'making of' with the green suits was great, too.  I found this to be a hidden gem (yes, it's low budget, so maybe a zircon instead of a diamond, but still shiny regardless!) & one of the better 'unkown' films I've found on Amazon so far.

5890671,4,B00E4V0AA6,"After reading the reviews and just seeing another great Mars (but very serious) movie, (with a crazed killer robot)
I didn't know if I would like this one. But, it was pretty dang good. I enjoyed it. It was romantic, but not in a chick-flick way. :)

I've been hooked on Sci-Fi movies since the 1950-60s, watching Rocketman serials at the movie house, listening to 'Buck Rogers' on a giant RCA radio (with tubes), and seeing 'The Outer Limits' etc on a B&W TV.

Sci-Fi is like Mexican food to the non-gourmet Texan, almost any Sci-Fi will do in a pinch.. Even if it's in weird animation.",1391126400,,587,4.4766355140186915

5890674,1,B00E4V0AA6,"From the opening moments of this movie I knew it was terrible.  The animation is horrible.  I think the movie makers just filmed people then ran the film through a computer and told it to turn the people into drawings.  The results are stupendously bad.  Very unrealistic and the movie making method threw away the best uses of true animation.  Bad plot to boot.

In short, the movie has nothing to recommend it.

5890677,3,B00E4V0AA6,"The acting and production raise this pedestrian story up.

An international group of actors led by Liev Schrieber did a fine job with the material they had. The story was derivative of ""Alien"" and ""Andromeda Strain"". The special effects, costuming and sets were well done and gave gravitus to the proceedings.",1389139200,,309,5.0588235294117645
5890678,2,B00E4V0AA6,"In, Mars, by Geof Marslet, I found it hard to differentiate between satire and bad science. The rotoscope animation was reasonably well done but so much of the pseudo-science was so sloppy that I lost the sense of humor. I still enjoyed a few moments here and there - but I only stayed with it on a dare. I was ready to give up waiting for another giggle long before the film concluded.

It's better than I could make, which says nothing. My analytical perspective was utterly displeased. I love poking fun at the establishment, but not to the point I have to be the moron to enjoy the humor.

I can't recommend it unless you've already seen everything else for free, or you are investing time learning how not to script an animated comedy.",1388707200,,740,4.474074074074074

5890681,5,B00E4V0AA6,"I stumbled upon this while paging through Prime movies, and my wife and I really enjoyed it.  It is animated in a pseudo-realistic fashion, a bit like Archer.  The plot is humorous and the acting is rather good.  Interesting blend of realistic high technology blended with amusingly bad science, plus a bit of romance.  Like Archer, it will probably reward re-watching.  The animations of spacecraft launches and especially their entry/descent/landing on Mars are quite realistic -- and the loss of ESA's Beagle II probe is a real and recent historical event (it has not yet been found).  Worth a look, but it may not be to everyone's taste.",1388448000,13,641,4.888888888888889

8601187,1,B00E4V0AA6,"Well, if you are thinking of watching this because you love manned spaceflight and/or science fiction, do not waste your time. It was clearly written by the actors. They clearly failed to learn anything from their junior high school science classes. They, like most Americans, may not use the word ""magic"" to describe technology, but their lack of understanding of any underlying scientific principles makes it just that. It is magic to them. And therefore, there are no rules to it. This show is ample evidence of more than three decades of war on public education. Given the political marginalization of intellectuals by people who would be living in trees, and flinging their poop at each other for forty or so years, until dying of old age, and their success at destroying public education, America will be a third rate nation soon. It is why we, as they put it in the beginning of this movie, are ""no longer good at stuff."" Including science fiction, unfortunately.  :(

I hereby dedicate this mission to the ""red planet"" to the great genius, Betsy DeVos. This is her kind of science. There is nothing like a bunch of con-artists and crooks to insure that we never go back to the moon, let alone get to Mars.",1486425600,,1213,4.690140845070423

8601190,4,B00E4V0AA6,"Quiry, offbeat sense of satire, Mars (2010) is also a space opera.  The animation was rather different, it looked the rotoscoping done by Max Fleischer to animate the Koko the clown character.  The animation also gave the film an ""atmosphere"" like the movie ""The Angry Red Planet"" (1959) with its ""CineMagic"" animation technique to animate the scenes on the surface of Mars.  The mode of transportation,  it looked like chemically fueled rockets for acsent and descent of space craft, but for the voyage to and from Mars, it looked like a solar-powered satellite shot a beam at the back end of the manned space craft to push it towrds Mars and towards earth.
The look is cool but Mars and Earth are constantly moving in their orbits so how they aimed the beam could be a little problematic.",1478217600,,790,4.702898550724638
