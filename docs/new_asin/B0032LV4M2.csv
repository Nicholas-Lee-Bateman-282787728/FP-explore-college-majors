4060941,2,B0032LV4M2,"Expected something more comprehensive about this beautiful and fascinating place.  It has such an interesting history.  It was mostly about the wild life and I did learn afew things, particularly about the California condors.  It kept repeating itself.  I found the music annoying.",1370390400,,281,5.465116279069767
4060942,5,B0032LV4M2,"can watch it over & over it's spectacular!  had it on dvr, so I wanted to buy it. worth every penny.",1366934400,,100,3.761904761904762
4060943,2,B0032LV4M2,"This documentary had the oddest organization. The narrative is made up of snippets of information/opinions woven together in a mostly  incoherent way. Pretty videos, though. Just wish the presentation had been given more thought and structure.",1336521600,4,243,5.75
4060944,2,B0032LV4M2,"Condors, cougars, sea lions and otters.  There is sooooo much more to Big Sur than what this weak documentary presented.  No history, no geology, no seasonal explanation.  Yes, the cougars are cool and the condor is big, but this wilderness is so much more complex than this repetitive, shallow, ""show"" had to offer.",1331424000,,316,4.9245283018867925
4060945,2,B0032LV4M2,This was bought as a gift; however it did not show the beautiful scenery at Big Sur. I have been to Big Sur and it has beautiful scenery that this DVD leaves out.,1323561600,,162,3.9393939393939394
4060946,5,B0032LV4M2,Condor footage and knowledge was great.  Exceptional scenes and interesting facts.  Traveling to Big Sur this summer with the family and this was a good pre-cursor.,1322956800,,164,5.269230769230769
4060947,4,B0032LV4M2,A little over dramatic as these usually are. Great mountain lion footage as well as California Condors! Watched for free on Prime,1301961600,2,129,4.909090909090909
4060948,2,B0032LV4M2,"It came today and I was excited.  My wife and I are going to Big Sur later this summer.  We were there once before; but didn't have time to explore.  I thought through this video, I could get a head's up on the area.  I was going to surprise my wife by showing it to her tonight.

Man!!!!  Why don't they call it ""Wild California.....big sur.""  Sea otters are cute; but not for half of it.  Also tons of time spent on condors.

I really should have read ""Bold Consumer's"" review more carefully.  It's my fault really.  I was hoping to see information on lodging, restaurants, Nepenthe, Pfeiffer Park.  You know....... the beauty of the place.  Not who kills who.

I'll pay more attention to reviews next time.  Show me the cliffs and the waves.",1275264000,6,744,4.407407407407407
4060949,5,B0032LV4M2,"Well,...
California is something like "" out of this world "",....

It is absolutly beautifull

I made a very good choice here...",1273449600,3,127,4.7272727272727275
4060950,5,B0032LV4M2,"I love Big Sur. It is no doubt one of the most beautiful places on earth.

Nature couldn't be closer watching this DVD unless you were there touching it. Some of this would be considered inappropriate for children to see. It's rather graphic. Some of it would be educational and fun for them. However, SCENE SELECTION is easy, so parents can choose what is age appropriate for their own children.

At times we see the woods from the viewpoint of the cougar, for example.

The narrator says,

""Cougars are the largest cats that purr, and they can leap over a bus - the L-O-N-G way.""

There is quite a bit of talk about the predators, and I was concerned about that as I have no desire to watch violence other than those tremendous waves pounding onto the shore. There are scenes where a dead animal or bird is shown on the shore or floating in the water, so if you choose to have children watch it, you may want to monitor it as they watch it the first time. There are great closeups of the animals and creatures of the sea and air. Lots of VERY CLOSE rattlesnake coverage. Red-tail hawks, ""Red-tail hawks rarely survive their first two years. Many die in crash landings while learning to fly."" Coyote pups are shown learning to walk and explore. The narrator explains that they are always in danger from cougars, hawks, and turkey vultures, but they don't show that happening.

The ocean is shown in beautiful detail in bright sun and also with what I consider to be beautiful fog. It couldn't be more gorgeous.

More talk about the sea pups now being big enough to venture out into danger.

The we have brief coverage of the wildfires and results. Nothing too graphic. It was fun to watch the time lapse video of the forest reawakening, seeds into seedlings, into trees, etc.

Back to discussion of casualties in the sea-lion community. I did not enjoy this part. Some sea lions were dead on the shore with flies all around them and another one badly injured, ""won't give up"" and we get a close-up view of that horrible situation followed by vultures and condors taking their meal, exceptional and according to the narrator the first footage of California condors eating in the wild.

You'll find plenty of forests, ocean, and sky in this gorgeous DVD. Quite a bit of coverage is given to the condors and sea otters. We even have a view of under those magnificent waves, revealing more than I had imagined was there. I've always been a little bored with underwater videos, not an interest of mine usually, but these are like nothing I've ever seen before. The plants and foliage, the seals and sea otters playing, sharks and whales, schools of fish, but most amazing is the jungle down there.

The photography is wonderful. If I had known about the graphic nature of some of it, I wouldn't have bought it, but that's because I don't enjoy those things. Others will consider that it is, after all, a nature video. Just know what you're getting.

The we have a couple of extra features or ""Wild Chronicles"" below the surface in the Gulf of California searching for a squid called the ""Red Devil"" the narrator says. These are dangerous adventures that many people will enjoy. Again, the photography is awesome. ""His worse nightmare materializes, when one of the squid nearly yanks off his mask. Then, as quickly as it all began, it's over..."" (he reenters the boat) ""Congratulations Bob."" ""Well, for what?"" ""For coming back alive! (laugh).

Another ""Wild Chronicles"" episode is of the Farralon Islands, near California and considered to be part of San Francisco. A brutal 27-mile boat ride. No safe harbor, so a crane hoists them onto shore. The general public is not allowed there. There are 211 miles of islands filled with marine mammals and birds. Scientists are studying the breeding habits of the birds there, effects of global warming, reasons for breeding failure, changing weather habits making it harder for them to find adequate food, the islands serving as a living laboratory.

These are very short, probably a minute or two long, but interesting. Very well done. The music is pleasant throughout the DVD.",1270252800,13,4116,4.70653685674548

8387561,2,B0032LV4M2,I was disappointed.  I watched this film on a flight following a trip to Big Sur and I ended up turning it off after watching half of it. It seemed to be thrown together without a clear direction and a lot of the footage was recycled throughout the film.  There is so much wonderful wildlife and history in Big Sur...this film did not capture the essence of that area.,1454889600,,368,4.318840579710145
8387562,2,B0032LV4M2,"We rented this because we are visiting the area soon. Nice narration by Hector Elizondo, but the footage seemed oddly edited together, somewhat repetitive, and minimally informative.",1440028800,,182,5.777777777777778

8387564,3,B0032LV4M2,They focused too much on seals and birds.  Never showed elephant seals never showed bobcats elk. All of which we saw when at Big asur.  The show was a bit boring,1426723200,,161,4.161290322580645
