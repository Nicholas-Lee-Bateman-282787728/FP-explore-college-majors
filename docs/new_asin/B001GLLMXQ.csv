3614077,5,B001GLLMXQ,"Psi Factor was one of my favorite shows growing up. It's about a group of scientists investigating paranormal phenomena. Contrary to what the show implies, it is fiction and does not appear to be based on actual case files.

Echo Bridge Home Entertainment released Season 3. It appears Alliance Home Entertainment is releasing Seasons 1, 2, and 3 on 07/13/10, 08/10/10, and 09/14/10, respectively.

The only downside to this 5-DVD box set is that DVDs don't have numbers on them so you don't know which is why. They are in order in the box when they arrive so just take a marker and label them ""1, 2, 3, 4 , 5"" respectively.

Here is the Episode list for this 5-DVD box set:

DVD 1:
Jaunt
Comings & Goings
Heartland
The Kiss

DVD 2:
Absolution
All Hallow's Eve
Palimpset
Return

DVD 3:
Harlequin
Little People
The Winding Cloth
Change
Solitary Confinement

DVD 4:
Valentine
Old Wounds
The Observer
School of Thought

DVD 5:
Y2K
Tribunal
John Doe
Forever and a Day, Part 1
Forever and a Day, Part 2",1279756800,4,997,4.561797752808989
3614078,3,B001GLLMXQ,"I agree that this was put together with little effort - the discs are not numbered and there is no summary of the episodes included.  But I'm happy to see the complete Season 3 in one DVD package.  I've just bought Season 4 on Amazon. De - Germany.  It was expensive, but I wanted to see the rest of the series.  That DVD set is in English and German, with German subtitles.  Its not Region 1 (USA and Canada).  Instead, its Region 2 for Europe only, so you have to have a no zone or decoded DVD player to watch it.  In Season 4, the discs are numbered and an episode summary is included (in German but it was pretty easy to figure out the titles, such as ""Die Neue Generation"", ""Die Wilde Frau"" and ""Kannibalen"".)  That makes me wonder why the same level of effort wasn't put into the USA release of Season 3.",1256083200,5,810,4.180645161290323
3614079,1,B001GLLMXQ,"Though I'm very pleased to see at least one season of Psi-Factor released on domestic DVD, I'm apalled at the lousy packaging.  Nowhere in the DVD set (there are 5 DVDs) is there any mention of the individual episode content.  No such information is on the back of the case; there is no booklet or flyer accompanying the DVDs; there is no indication on the individual DVDs as to what episodes are included on a given DVD.  Worse yet, the DVDs aren't even numbered 1-5; thus, there is no easy or logical way to determine the content of a DVD without inserting the DVD into the player and perusing a menu.  Thankfully I found a fan-based Psi-Factor website that does provide such episode information, but was certainly annoyed at the waste of time having to track down and print information that should have been included with the DVD set to begin with.",1251590400,17,851,4.578947368421052
3614080,5,B001GLLMXQ,Kind of lame to start with Season 3. Seasons 1 and 2 were actually better in my opinion. This show was very similar to the X-Files and the stories were quite good.,1251417600,2,163,4.125
3614081,4,B001GLLMXQ,"I still have to shake my head, I don't understand why they're releasing season 3 first.  I was a big fan of this show and have been checking Amazon periodically for it.  Glad something is coming out, but why not season 1 and 2 first?",1229472000,9,233,4.155555555555556
3614082,3,B001GLLMXQ,"Amazon's description says ""Psi Factor: Season Three"", and then later on in the details it says ""Number of discs: 1"".

I am most definitely a fan.  I have been looking on eBay UK for all 4 seasons and would figure out how to watch them in the U.S. later.  I am most grateful we are getting something here.  It is my understanding that all 4 seasons are 22 episodes *each* and I don't think one season can fit on one disc.  I have seen on eBay/UK something like, PSI FACTOR SEASON 3 VOLUME 3.7 EPS 3.20 TO 3.22.  Another example SEASON 2 (5 disc-set 968 minutes).  So ... know what you are paying for so your not surprised and then kick back and enjoy what I call a *great* series.",1225756800,,679,4.176923076923077
3614083,4,B001GLLMXQ,"I think they are releasing season 3 on dvd for region 1(USA).Gosh,I hope so!!!!This series was basically about a team of scientists and former cops who investigated paranormal cases- it was a series filmed in Canada in the late 90's into the year 2000. The series was introduced every week by Dan Ackroid(spelling?)who also introduced the kind of case and who would be investigating it(Barclay Hope,Maurice Dean Wint,etc)-Dan was one of the executive producers of the series. This series has been out on Region 2 for awhile-come on release it here I'm waiting......",1222560000,12,565,5.086021505376344

8305827,1,B001GLLMXQ,Just bought this nonsense. I thought it looked interesting and isn't at all... Lame and nothing paranormal about it .. Don't waste your money and instead look up A Haunting which is a great paranormal show.,1437177600,,206,4.75
8305828,1,B001GLLMXQ,"This is extremely lame, no wonder it was in the 5 dollar bin in Walmart. This famous 'paranormal' never seems to happen, its more like a murder/crime drama than a paranormal one. The series jumps back and fourth from being realistic with crime scenes, to unrealistic with power/lightening purple zaps to open up spirit tunnels. It's so muddled, the series cannot decide if its fiction or nonfiction.

The acting is pretty bland, something out of a Soap Opra. I only watched 2 episodes and was falling asleep it was so boring. If you want more paranormal action with demons, ghosts or anything scary for that matter, don't buy this. It will greatly disappoint. Don't let the spooky cover fool you.",1437177600,,696,4.8
