8443867,5,B004VRCKYM,"Not sure why all the negative reviews on this.
Personally enjoyed it very much from start to finish.  Well written, good plot, nicely executed, direction is perfect, editing is just right, music is different and fits the plot.  Above all the casting was on the dot with superb performances.  The actors are hilarious and compliment each other perfectly, the movie flows with ease throughout. Loved it so much that had to own a copy.",1456012800,,432,4.8108108108108105

8443872,3,B004VRCKYM,"Yacht salesmen Vikram (Irrfan Kahn), Raj (Bobby Deol), and Yogi (Suniel Shetty)are selling a little more than boats. Married to Vishan (Rimi Sen), Sanjana (Sonam Kapoor), and Maya (Celina Jeitley) respectively, these guys think that extra-marital affairs are just a part of life while leaving their wives in the dark. When Sanjana begins to suspect Raj's infidelity, Maya introduces her to Kishan (Akshay Kumar) a flute-playing private investigator who specializes in this sort of ""case.""
Kishan's initial attempt to expose the less than faithful husband is deflected by an elaborate lie. However, soon the husbands are hiring the same P.I. to find out who is tipping off their wives and Kishan concocts an elaborate scheme to get them to out each other.

What I liked...
-I actually did laugh out loud at a couple of points because some of the plot twists were very funny
-The philandering husbands did not get away with their (excessive) womanizing

What I did not like...
-The soundtrack was, in my view, a little unmemorable. Usually, by the end of the film I am humming one of the tunes but this is not the case here.
-This film was supposed to be amusing but some of the ""serious"" bits were way over done taking a dramatic and awkward turn in mood.

This is definitely one of those films to rent before you buy to see if it is to your taste. To me it seems more like a film you watch once just to say you did.",1311379200,3,1415,4.607142857142857
8443873,3,B004VRCKYM,"There is a lot to like here for us guys, beautiful Bollywood eye-candy and slapstick humor.  However, this film feels strange and off-putting.  It is morally corrupt in a specifically Bollywood way.
Marriage is so sacred in the land of Bollywood and yet here is a film that relishes in its infidelity.  It reminds me of American exploitation films of the 1970s.  The film glories in the forbidden fruits, but must conform in plot to the moral rules of the modern India.  That makes for a film that isn't nearly as much fun at it wants to be.
For an American audience (not NRI), this movie will seem quite strange, even if you are used to the amusing excesses of Bollywood Cinema.  You won't regret watching it, but by the end you'll feel like you've been watching a 'fetish film' for a fetish you don't undestand.",1304208000,3,813,4.534246575342466
