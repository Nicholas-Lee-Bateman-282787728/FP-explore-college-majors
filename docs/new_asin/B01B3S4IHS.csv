Sound quality is ok,  Always cool to see the Ramones but being a one shot bootleg quality dvd the guy should have shot more of the other members.",1471478400,2,280,4.245283018867925
8749239,2,B01B3S4IHS,"As a Ramones fan i jumped on this. However after viewing it i got a bad taste in my mouth. it is the Ramones Live but it was recorded on vhs i think. very little camera movement, terrible sound and not much fun. There is 1 disc and 31 songs(32 actually but song 1 is 10 seconds). no liner notes and no indication where it was recorded. i belive it was their last tour. kinda fun to hear the crowd sing every song but you can barely hear Ramones play. Overall it's a cheaply filmed live concert.( there is better on youtube.)  i own better Ramones live dvds.  It could of and Should of been better. i am sad to say this for I am a big Ramones fan.  just my opinion.",1467244800,4,664,4.015151515151516
