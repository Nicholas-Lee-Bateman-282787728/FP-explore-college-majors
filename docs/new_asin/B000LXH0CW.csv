8164994,4,B000LXH0CW,"I was skeptical when a friend of mine suggested I get this 6 pack just because the price seemed way too cheap for any kind of quality movie.  But I'll be the first to admit Unborn Sins is worth the price alone.  The direction and acting were all really good for the obvious low budget and thats one of the reasons why I gave it four stars.  When you have limited resources it can be really difficult to produce a quality movie however this movie pulls it off.  The special effects, lighting, etc are not going to be top quality but the story pulls everything together.  The rest of the movies are hit or miss but do yourself a favor and buy this if you like a good horror movie with plenty of good action, some laughs and scares.",1190332800,6,729,4.215827338129497
8164995,3,B000LXH0CW,"The only reason I give this dvd a 3 is because of ""Unborn Sins"". This is a decent movie and the best on the dvd. The story is good. The lighting stinks some of the time. The acting was surprisingly good, as the acting on most of these  six-in-one dvds stinks beyond repair. The only other problem I had with this movie is the announcements whenever they were changing scenes-NOT GOOD FOR A MOVIE. The story had the continueum, minus the segment announcements, that good movies need from scene to scene. ""The Operation"", The procedure""--the political messages were clear about abortions. There was not doubt of the writers point of view. Would have been nice if both sides were presented, without one side being presented as lunacy. It is also a shame that they did not  have enough money to do the lighting correctly. All in all, a very decent movie. It deserved  to be on dvd by itself.

"" I Dream of Dracula"" was  acomplete waste of time, eyesight and earsound.
Here is a tip-Do not drink and write. Drunk writing kills------time that is, but it still kills.

""Cope"" was okay, but no more. The story about the family dynamics was more interesting than the aliens killing everybody or the girl loosing her mind or whatever. Nothing else to say.

""Sick [...]"" was par for the course as far as most of these cheap, pointless, stupid slashem and eat their guts movies are. The murders have no ryhyme or reason. They are grotesque with poor special effects. One man's entrails looked like red spaghetti. THe Friday the 13th sequels should be a hint-murder without reason does not equal quality. The best thing for a good movie is a good script. This one did not have one.

""The Crucifier"" would only make since if you have experienced with drugs. Since I haven't, I will move on.

""Dominion"" would have been a good movie if this were 1975. Since it is not 1975, I will proceed to throw this dvd in the trash.  Goodbye.",1186876800,20,1915,4.556851311953353

8164997,5,B000LXH0CW,"Unborn Sins, the third movie on this horror compilation, was worth the money I spent on this DVD. These low budget horror movies provide a few hours of entertainment, but Unborn Sins was by far the best. It had horror, comedy, karate and a great soundtrack. It was creative and thought provoking. I highly recommend this DVD for horror fans worldwide.",1173657600,11,351,4.770491803278689
