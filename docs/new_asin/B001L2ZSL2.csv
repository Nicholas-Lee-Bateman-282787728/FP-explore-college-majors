3677684,5,B001L2ZSL2,"The songs are very enjoyable, the dances are easy for a toddler to follow. My son learned to say ""ah"" from Dorothy and jumps around with the dances. It's good clean fun with a bit of learning, catchy tunes, and very colorful characters (flowers, fairies, etc.) I enjoy watching it too!",1307491200,,285,4.607843137254902
3677685,5,B001L2ZSL2,"This video features Dorothy as she reviews her ""memory album"".  It is full of songs and dances as she visits the doctor, takes a dance class and has friends over for tea, ect.  Wags, Henry and Captain Feathersword all appear but the traditional wiggles singers do not.  This video is a favorite of my three year old daughter and was a great purchase for us.",1264118400,6,357,4.461538461538462
3677686,5,B001L2ZSL2,"My daughter is a Wiggles-holic and this is a hit! I bought this DVD because another reviewer said it was more like the old-school Wiggles DVD's prior to all the computer animation. While my husband and I like the newer DVDs, my daugher who is 21 months likes the early Wiggles DVD much, much better. It took a few times for her to warm up to it... the Wiggles aren't in the DVD at all, just Dorthy, Captain, Henry and Wags. Now she sings and dances with Dorthy. As a nice bonus there are some live Wiggles concert clips on the DVD.",1243555200,,531,4.215686274509804
3677687,5,B001L2ZSL2,My eighteen month old son can watch this over and over again.  He stands in front of the tv and giggles and dances.  This DVD is everything the Wiggles were with Greg Page.  No fake looking green screen shots like the new Wiggles series.,1240444800,,237,4.340909090909091

8317043,5,B001L2ZSL2,"Still in packaging for $4.98 flat? U can't beat that! I haven't watched the DVD as it will be a gift, but it being wrapped in plastic is a hugemplus in my book!",1376956800,,160,3.878787878787879
8317044,5,B001L2ZSL2,"I think Dorothy is very lucky to have her own TV show movie.  Although the Wiggles don't appear in this one, her other friends, Wags, Henry, and Captain Feathersword do.

I love it when Dorothy shows her scrapbook to Wags and how she goes to the dentist with the Captain for company...and protection.

The Wiggles and friends always love each other.  I think this show became inspired by Dorothy's and Barney's Dino-Mite on Sprout.",1363996800,,431,4.783783783783784
8317045,5,B001L2ZSL2,"This video is my daughter's new favorite video.  She is a big Wiggles fan and is especially a fan of Dorothy (since Dot is the only main female character, I guess).  Dorothy and Wags go through her ""memory"" photo book and many of Dot's friends appear, like Henry the Octopus, Captain Feathersword, Wags, and lots of guest singers, many of whom we've met before on other Wiggles videos.  The songs are catchy, sets are cute, Dot and friends dance- one of our favorite Wiggles videos.  p.s. no actual Wiggles appear, but my daughter doesn't mind at all.  And she likes that Wags and Henry talk in this video.",1341100800,,606,4.574074074074074
8317046,5,B001L2ZSL2,"If you love the Wiggles characters, especially Dorothy the Dinosaur, this ""best of"" collection from the first version of the Australian TV series, Dorothy the Dinosaur, is a must have.  Fun to watch, hung together with a cute surrounding story, well-paced, and with interesting guest characters.  As always, the music is well done and the sets are bright and colorful. Fun for both the younger (toddler) and older (preschool/kindergarten) kids.",1326326400,2,444,5.328571428571428
8317047,5,B001L2ZSL2,"I bought this movie for my munchkins after they recived ""The Best of the Wiggles"" DVD from Grandma and nearly drove me crazy with the CONSTANT watching (I'm talking about back-to-back-to-back watching for 2 weeks). Having never seen the Wiggles before I was very impressed with the type of songs and dancing that they had. I thought the Dorothy movie would provide a nice variety for us. When I ordered it I thought that is was part of the Dorothy the Dinosaur show but it is really flashbacks to the show. While not what I had expected it was still a cute movie. Dorothy and Wags look through a picture book of Dorothy's and remember all the fun they had. The songs are more ""classical"" in nature than the rest of the songs the Wiggles sing. My 5 and 4 yr. olds (both girls) like to dance along with Dorothy, who shows them how to do the footwork on a few songs. My 3 yr. old (boy) and 18 mo. old (girl) try to sing along but otherwise are happy to watch Dorothy do all the dancing! Even though it was not what I expected I still think this is a great movie.",1323475200,2,1059,4.221674876847291
8317048,5,B001L2ZSL2,"No Wiggles here, but lots of excellent singing and dancing from Dorothy and friends. The dialogue is often paced a little slow, even by kids' standards, but the musical bits are fantastic and little ones love them. The production is on par with the Wiggles' best DVDs, such as ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"" and ""Wiggly Wiggly World.""",1320364800,,335,4.694915254237288
