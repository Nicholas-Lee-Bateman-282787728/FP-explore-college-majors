8054831,4,B0007ZJELO,"Boots Malone is a good story backed by a fine cast.  William Holden is as outstanding in it as he is in every other movie he made regardless of whether the movie was top of the line or a Class B film such as this picture.  His performances always seem to transcend the particular quality of the movie in which he finds himself.  Not to misunderstand, Boots Malone is a good story and is enjoyable to watch, it's just not an outstanding movie like some of his finer films, Sunset Boulevard, The Wild Bunch, Network, etc.  Nevertheless if you like him you'll like this movie since it's enjoyable fare.",1380412800,,599,4.467889908256881

8054834,5,B0007ZJELO,".....There have been literally hundreds of racetrack films made and most of them have been pure hokem ala the implauseable although enjoyable ""National Velvet"".

.....As a former owner of racehorses I recognized immediately the authenticity of this film and its accurate portrayal of the gritty seamier side of life on the backside.

.....Bill Holden gives his usual great performance as the cynical jockey's agent with a tough guy exterior but a soft spot down deep.

.....Johnny Stewart as the rich kid who yearns to be a jockey and Basil Ruysdael as the oldtimer who has seen it all both turn in outstanding performances.

.....But the heart of the movie is Holden's struggle between betrayal and honor.  This is without a doubt the most realistic racetrack movie ever made and one of Holden's most under rated performances.

.....If you like racetrack yarns you want this movie.",1268179200,4,882,5.048275862068966
