8422392,2,B004BUY0I8,"The talks given are great, but the music luls you to sleep. If you are purchasing this for a classroom don't even think about it. Evolution is too important to be presented like this. Instead buy ""The Galapagos"" BBC version or just have them read On the Origin of Species by Darwin followed by 2 weeks of intense genetics and population genetics lectures, because this video is boring. The video could be great but the poor background music choice and the cheap cameras and other production work killed it. Which is sad because the packaging and format of the material would be great if they had only paid more attention to the production details.",1372291200,,647,4.684210526315789

8422394,5,B004BUY0I8,"EVO:Ten Questions Everyone Should Ask About Evolution is an outstanding presentation on evolution, the where and how the universe began and evolved. The cinema photography and narration by filmmaker John Feldman and music by composer Sheila Silver combine synergistically to create a fascinating study of evolution that would be an indispensible aide in science classes across the country. The material is presented in a concise and logical way, with hightened visual and musical drama through out. In addition to being utilized in school curricula by professionals and families with children of all ages, this video should spawn many enthusiastic scientists.",1323734400,,659,5.6
8422395,5,B004BUY0I8,"I wish that everyone who doesn't believe in evolution could see this film.  It explains and shows the ""whys"" and ""hows"" of evolution in simple, yet entertaining (not to mention convincing) terms.  This film would be good for Science classes starting in fifth grade and all the way through high school.  It makes a good educational yet fun gift. I am looking forward to showing it to my grandson.",1321574400,,395,4.695652173913044
8422396,5,B004BUY0I8,"What a pleasure it is to spend 107 minutes in the hands of a smart and talented filmmaker with no obvious agenda to advance. Instead, it's all about inquiry, and what better place to begin than with distinguished scientists who know what they're talking about? The production values are absolutely tops here, and while this would be a superb teaching tool to use in classrooms, as other reviewers have suggested, it's  just as rewarding for the general viewer. In fact, it's for any thinking person--the proverbial nine to 90--who has an interest in a subject that is interesting from almost any angle.",1296086400,,602,4.901960784313726
8422397,5,B004BUY0I8,"Upon watching Evo my singular thought was that every science teacher in the world should have this film. It's engaging, charming, provocative, and educational (without being at all preachy).

Anyone curious about our world and its myriad species -- about Darwin's now-solidly accepted theories of evolution and natural selection, the various refinements that have come from it, and it's relationship to theological thought -- should see it.

John Feldman's well-paced ten-part film never lags.  I was totally impressed - with his research, the film's thoughtful organization, the editing, the photography, the animation, his choice of interviewees.  It's really a perfect and engaging film about a subject many people might not think they need to know.

Evo is a delight.  It should open minds and provoke discussion wherever it's seen -- and isn't that what learning is about?",1294358400,4,877,5.364963503649635
8422398,5,B004BUY0I8,"EVO: Ten Questions Everyone Should Ask About Evolution  is a new educational film by Hummingbird Films, a Spencertown, New York-based husband and wife team consisting of filmmaker John Feldman and composer/arranger Sheila Silver. As its name implies, the film, created with the lay viewer in mind, presents a summary of what biological evolution is and how it works by posing the eponymous inquiries to various luminaries in the field of evolutionary studies. In its first conception, EVO was a pedagogical tool intended for high school biology students, and that pedigree is still evident in the film's current, general-audience incarnation. The film is cerebral and informative, yet still fascinating; it presents a commonly misunderstood topic in a way that tyros will understand and veterans will appreciate.

  The questions begin with the fundamental (""What is evolution? Who was Darwin? What is natural selection?""), tackle the particulars (""How do species come about? Where do variations come from? What is a brief history of life? Is evolution random?""), touch upon the necessary (""What is the controversy? Why should anyone care about evolution?""), and even get into the surprisingly sophisticated (""What role does cooperation play?""). Feldman has picked questions that he believes the average person should (but might not) know the answers to, answers which provide a fairly good overview of what evolution is all about. The featured evolutionists include, but are not limited to, Niles Eldredge, Lynn Margulis, Peter and Rosemary Grant, and Daniel Dennett. The bulk of the film's content consists of the experts' answers to the ten questions, with Feldman narrating and weaving these replies together. This format is surprisingly engrossing, as stunning wildlife footage and attractive visuals provided by graphic designer Guido Alvarez offer the eye plenty to soak in while listening to the voiceovers. In the background, the insistent, meditative musical score offers a beautifully appropriate accompaniment to the marvelous world of evolutionary wonders, with plaintive muted trumpet and flugelhorn providing color and sonority along with more exotic woodwind instruments such as the Egyptian flute.

 As they are introduced by the scientists, key terms and concepts are displayed textually in animated ""memo notes,"" complete with pushpins. These were evidently designed for the convenience of classroom note-takers, yet work fairly well even for a lay audience, as they give the viewer a chance to catch his or her breath and absorb each critical point before the eager interviewees launch into another evolutionary concept. Addressing the basic facts of evolution and its intellectual history,  the film does an admirable job of making the content both accessible and interesting for newcomers while delving deeply enough to satisfy the knowledgeable viewer. Those who already understand evolution will find plenty to enjoy, from the dazzling nature footage to the horse's-mouth wisdom from the evolutionary experts. Photos of Darwin are interspersed with shots of his famous journals during the film's biographical section, while the scientists offer humorous and humanizing anecdotes about the legendary biologist. Failing to appreciate the diversity of the local tortoises among the different islands of the Galapagos, for example, Darwin's crew ate over a dozen of them during the voyage! Each of the fundamentals of evolution, such as natural selection, mutation, differential survival, and speciation are covered, and even fairly advanced concepts such as symbiogenesis are well-explained and elegantly integrated into the film. The ubiquitous political evolution vs. religion conflict is handled gracefully and masterfully, in a way that neither the religious nor scientific materialists should find objectionable (although, of course, some will object).

 Proponents of applied evolutionary approaches might find themselves wanting more from the ""Why should we care?"" section about how evolution applies to us, although this is scarcely Feldman's fault, as Applied Evolution is a surprisingly recent movement. Most of the applications provided by scientists are along the lines of the biomedical, especially with reference to pathogens and microbial resistance. While this may be the among the most salient current uses of natural selection in action, evolution has the potential to be used much more widely in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of countless medical conditions, from cholera to Alzheimer's disease, an application alluded to but never made explicit.

 Environmental and ecological implications are also explored, leading to a short discussion of cultural evolution. One might suspect a slight bit of stray political agenda near the end of the film, when biologist Joan Roughgarden's statement that ""biotechnology and genetic engineering [have been] sold on the basis of health and curing diseases [by] medical authority"" is illustrated by a slow pan over a tableful of books all decrying genetically modified food. Whether or not this is what Roughgarden was referring to, the most compelling objections  to genetic engineering are from the ethical and political spheres, and some viewers might feel a twinge of unease to see such an issue share turf, however briefly, with an educational film about empirical science.

 Feldman, with a couple of  notable exceptions such as cooperation, stops short of delving into behavior and the mind, human or otherwise, precluding a discussion of evolution's applications to the political, economic, educational, or social realms. Of course, the topic  of evolutionary psychology, both theoretical and applied, could take up an entire film (or two) in and of itself, a fertile concept should Feldman ever decide to create a sequel.

 With respect to production, the picture quality is crisp and the music flawless. Some may be surprised to see the Gaia hypothesis presented as if it were somehow central to the field of evolution rather than a controversial concept usually relegated to environmentalism and climate science. Then again, Gaia supporter Lynn Margulis is prominently featured in the film, and this is the one inevitable consequence of the movie's format; Feldman must report what his interviewees cover, whether or not it maps unanimously onto current sentiment in the field of evolutionary biology as a whole. This may be a good or a bad thing, depending upon how any given viewer stands on certain issues. Advocates of punctuated equilibrium will be pleased to find that theory discussed in the film, courtesy of Niles Eldredge.

 The only part of EVO that might actually irk some scientists or educators is the brief discussion of group selection, which does not include explicit clarification that it is an extension of standard gene selection which requires special conditions in order to take place. Most evolutionists who watch the film will wish that kin selection was discussed as the basis behind most group selection. This small point may discourage certain biology teachers from showing it to students, which would be everyone's loss.

 The serious and intellectual milieu created by Silver's sophisticated score and Feldman's cogitative narration, not to mention the film's vaguely P-shaped bird logo, brings to mind one of the educational science documentaries that PBS created in the 1990's, back in the days when a good educational film was both common and widely-appreciated;  EVO recalls many of the strengths of those classics without appearing dated. A couple of minor qualms aside, EVO: Ten Questions Everyone Should Ask About Evolution is a superbly compiled and produced overview of biological evolution, for students, professionals, and lay audiences alike, highly recommended for anyone who can get their hands on a copy or attend a screening.",1292544000,5,7872,5.519933554817276
8422399,5,B004BUY0I8,"My son, age 11, and I watched Evo together. I was planning to watch themovie in sections but my son insisted that we watch the entire movie atonce. I am so glad we did. Evo was entertaining as well as beingeducational....for both of us. The information presented was in a clear andlogical format. Interviews were very interesting and provided thebackdrop upon which the 10 questions of evolution were explained. Both thenarration and musical score provided the cohesiveness that propelled ourinterest forward. Evo is suitable for any age. I think children over theage of 10 would get the most benefit. I highly recommend Evo for anyonewho wants to start learning about evolution and anyone who wants to expandtheir knowledge on the subject. Evo would be a great addition to thecurriculum in any middle school and high school. It's great to watch as afamily or in a small group, so that you can talk about it as you go along.",1292025600,4,924,4.8544303797468356
