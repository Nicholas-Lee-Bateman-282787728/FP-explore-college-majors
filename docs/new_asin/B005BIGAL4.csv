4643797,5,B005BIGAL4,"""Roseanne"" managed to do with television what desperately needed to be done and people from my generation who were made to feel like freaks by The Brady Bunch, the Partirdge family and The Waltons,m finally were vindicated in seeing a real Am erican Family.

Most of the episodes here comes ferom the 3,4 and 5th season with an occasional side step. the pilot is here, with the original DJ and even there, where Roseanne did not yet know how to hit a mark and keep open to the cameras managed to delkve into herself and the pilot, which showed her breaking character for 20 minutes, onlky toi see her rise to the occasions when their middle daughter gets injured and she and her husband (John Goodman) work toegher to repair boith the childs finger and train of thought.

Roseanne attempted to taker on too much, at first she was seelking to show the real American family, then she begame a barge for women';s rights, which she attained by deghrading men (Is there a man on the planet who is a better husband and father than Dan Connor? Hell, I'd married him and we';re both straight) Yet she rolled over him and he placated her, I look at shows now-25 years later and I see that they exist because of what Roseanne did for us, but she did indeed encourage a movement of ""Feminism = Male Bashing"" and this has created as many problems as it solved.

Roseanna tackled many subjects that gave everyone something to think about. She was blessed to be surrounded by brilliant talent (award winners John Goodman and Laurie Metcalk) and she paved the way for a leothora of actors such as George Clooney, Johnny Galecki, CHristian Slater and many more (to say nothing of sarah Chalke)

This is fun. Buy the DVD, laugh. If you enjoy THAT, then you need to buy the entire sreries, which I already did.",1342569600,,1792,4.538699690402477
4643798,5,B005BIGAL4,i love Roseanne and always catch reruns! I have alot of episodes on my DVR. Now I can take up less room by buying seasons. Good buy!,1326499200,,132,3.925925925925926
4643799,5,B005BIGAL4,"I don't know if these are MY favorites but in any case, Roseanne is always great. You can see the progression of her acting chops as she goes from her stand-up type delivery to a really good actor.
This is one of the smartest, best-written series that has ever been on TV. I have to admit, I never watched it when it was on originally and only discovered it on TV Land. Thank you TV Land! and thank you, Roseanne. You have gotten me through many a sleepless night with a smile.",1322006400,7,477,4.195652173913044
4643800,5,B005BIGAL4,"All though I am the owner of all 9 Seasons (even double copies) of Roseanne, I just HAD to purchase 10 Fan Favorites DVD to see as a whole what episodes Roseanne's fans chose! Majority of the episodes that were chosen are some of my faves, there were a couple that I would not have chosen as mine. I still loved the dvd though because I have nothing bad to say about this show!!",1316908800,2,378,4.121621621621622
4643801,4,B005BIGAL4,"I agree with the selection of most of these episodes, such as:

Life and Stuff (Season 1) --- The pilot episode, which is probably the most realistic and honest portrayal of blue collar family life ever presented on TV. It's so realistic is almost borders on boring --- almost. Grade: A

Happy Birthday --- (Season 2) A touching and heartfelt episode without being sappy, honest and realistic. As a writer myself, this episode has always moved me. Grade: A+

Like a Virgin --- (Season 3) Darlene is caught making out with a boy (this was years before she met David Healy). A great episode, yes, but I wouldn't have included it for this collection. Grade: A

Confessions --- (Season 3) An excellent episode with fantastic and sharp writing, and one that we can all relate to. Grade: A+

Scenes From a Barbecue --- (Season 3) One of my personal favorites, this episode showcases the Conners relaxing and actually having fun before the turmoil and tense drama of later seasons. Grade: A+

Crime and Punishment --- (Season 5) Speaking of turmoil and drama, this episode is a MASTERPIECE, with virtuoso acting from Laurie Metcalf. Very, very touching. It's a dark episode, raw and uncomfortable, but also quite moving and pretty funny in parts. Grade: A+

War and Peace --- (Season 5) Part 2 of ""Crime and Punishment,"" just as fantastic as its predecessor. Just phenomenol. Grade: A+

Wait Til Your father Comes Home --- (Season 5) Another dramatic episode, very raw and realistic, concerning the death of Roseanne's abusive, cheating father and her unique reaction to it. A classic episode. Grade: A+

A Stash From the Past --- (Season 6) One of the more controversial episodes, this one features what is perhaps the single funniest scene in the entire 9 year run of the show. Absolutely hysterical. A ""drug episode"" that is not preachy or sappy like in most sitcoms. Remember those ""Very Special Episodes"" from sitcoms in the 80's? This isn't one of them, that's for sure. Grade: A+

Sleeper --- (Season 7) A funny episode, but not worthy of inclusion in this collection. Still, it's quite enjoyable and amusing. Grade: B

It's pretty cheap and WELL worth the price, but do we really need 3 episodes from season 3? What about season 4, (highly regarded amongst ""Roseanne"" snobs such as myself as the show's best season)?

If left up to me, I would've chosen the following episodes:
_____________________________________________________________

Life and Stuff (Season 1) The pilot.

Toto, We're Not in Kansas Anymore (Season 1) The tornado episode.

Brain-Dead Poets Society (Season 2) Darlene discovers that she has a real talent for writing. BEAUTIFUL and moving.

Happy Birthday (Season 2) Roseanne tries to re-discover her talent for writing.

Confessions From a Barbecue (Season 3) The Conners celebrate Mother's Day and have a ton of fun. This episode introduces Nana Mary, one of the show's funniest characters.

Santa Claus (Season 4) Roseanne gets a job at the mall as Santa. Hilarious and the ending is very touching.

Wait Til Your Father Comes Home --- Roseanne's and Jackie's abusive and cheating father dies.

A Stash From the Past (Season 6) --- The infamous ""pot episode.""

Girl Talk (Season 7) Extremely coarse and vulgar, but insightful episode dealing with sex.

The Fifties Show (Season 8) An absolutely hysterical, clever, and witty spoof of 1950's sitcoms --- the complete opposite of what ""Roseanne"" is really about.

Just my 2 cents. :)",1316563200,19,3457,4.963541666666667
