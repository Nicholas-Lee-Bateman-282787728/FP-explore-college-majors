1298094,5,B00003CY51,"John Singleton finally realizes his promise of ""Boyz N the Hood"" with ""Baby Boy."" Full of complex and rich characters and a simple yet engrossing storyline, Singleton's vision weaves unpredictably. That's a good thing. Almost helps me forgive ""Higher Learning.""",993859200,,261,5.55
1298095,5,B00003CY51,"Suprise is the word for this film.  I was not really looking forward to seeing this film, me and my partner just happened to go see it cuz there was nothing else really playing in the theater.  One thing that will shock everyone in this movie is how good Tyrese was in this role.  Watching buffoons like Usher try to act initially made me cringe at the thought of Tyrese playing the lead role, but his performance was exceptional.  Ving Rhames was excellent as always, and even Snoop played his role convincingly.  Omar Gooding overacted in some parts, but i guess he learned from the master of overacting, his brother Cuba.  All in all...this was an excellent film.",993772800,2,666,4.601694915254237
1298096,1,B00003CY51,"Probably the worst movie this year, this drivel makes the long, tedious scenes from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon look positively action-packed.
What starts out with an interesting premise, that society shapes young black men to refuse maturity and responsibility, turns into the worst gangsta' crap produced in a long time, including the rite of passage when one of the baby boys kills a character and becomes a MAN.  Shameless.  Especially the hilarious scene when one baby boy accepts his pseudo step daddy's love when the boy hands over the pistol used to cut down the character.  Apparently, the daddy, a one-time hoodlum himself, knows what to do with dirty pistols.  It's a touching tampon moment...  It's a complete waste of talent: Snoop Dog and Tyrese Gibson.
Avoid the stench of this pile of crap at all costs.  It should be sent directly to landfill...",993686400,8,865,4.972222222222222

1298466,4,B00003CY51,"Baby Boy is a very well made film that illustrates the struggles that boys face becoming men, especially when it is easier to continue on the same road. The setting is Los Angeles, but it could as well been anywhere because the story transcends setting. The characters are archtypes with the young man with two kids struggling to commit to his girlfriend. He likes her, but wants more. His mother wants a relationship too, and she wants space from her son. This is a story that many can relate to. Ving Rhames is excellent in this film, he really steals the show.

1298530,4,B00003CY51,"OK first off, why are people on here clutching their pearls and acting so flabbergasted, what kind of movie did you think Baby Boy was when you saw the cover? This is no Lifetime movie. People are acting like John Singleton is Satan and like they've never heard a curse word before. ""I've never heard such profane language in my life!"" Get over yourself.

Baby Boy is a cult classic. Why? Because let's be real, a lot of ppl know someone who acts similarly to some of the characters (especially Jody, Yvette and P). I'm not saying that's a positive thing, but just being real. People like movies that they can somewhat relate to and that's why it became so popular. For those complaining about Jody being an overgrown mama's boy, well, this is ""Baby Boy"", that is the point. Yes, there are some scenes that will make you wonder what the hell someone was thinking (like Yvette letting Rodney into her apartment as soon as he stepped foot out of jail) but it is a good watch if this is your type of movie. It's not sugar coated.

Tyrese does an excellent and very convincing job as 20 year old Jody, a young man who is stuck in perpetual boyhood, and lives with his mother Juanita. Jody has two baby mamas, cannot hold a job, and can't stand his mother's boyfriend. Does this sound rare? It's not unfortunately. Singleton presents an accurate (yet gritty) portrayal, which has even led to many people referring to men with this complex in real life as Jody or Baby Boys.

Yvette is one of Jody's baby mamas, and she loves him even though he cannot hold down a job, is verbally abusive, uses her car while she is at work to see other women and even hit her once. Sound rare? It's not unfortunately. Some reviewers have stated that they think Singleton was trying to reinforce an ""agenda"" with Baby Boy. No, what he did was make a movie about what is common among many black males around Jody's age (or even older). No one is telling you to go out and act like Jody and Yvette. Just take the movie for what it is. And for those criticizing the end, it was just realistic. Everything isn't always ""happily ever after, riding off on a white horse into the sunset"".",1426291200,3,2158,4.430730478589421

1298735,5,B00003CY51,"The man who brought us Boyz N the Hood, John Singleton, has come out with another great hit. Baby Boy has a great cast of well-known actors that include Tyrese, AJ Johnson, Ving Rhames, Snoop Dogg, MoNique, and Taraji P. Henson. The actors are full of heart and really bring out their characters.
This raunchy, provocative movie tells the story of Jody (played by Tyrese) and paints a vivid image of inner city life in South Central Los Angeles. Hes a black man that just cant seem to grow up and is fighting one battle after another. Even though there are some scenes full of violence and sex, it really helps capture the raw feel that this movie is full of.

1298848,5,B00003CY51,"I was amazed by Baby Boy. I was totally amazed by this film.

Baby Boy is a bit unflinching. For one thing, as the movie goes along, Jody, the protagonist of the movie, begins to seem vaguely unlikeable, perhaps even down-right bad. This could be considered an odd change-up? Jody does, perhaps, redeem himself by the end.

There's a lot of conflict in the relationships in Jody's life. Too many people trying to live in too small a space with probably not quite enough money to go 'round? I think I saw his mom as a victim and Jody as a bad-guy. Really, maybe it would be helpful if his mom were a more compassionate person too. Perhaps Jody is taking after his mom in the first place... donno

I could see myself in the role of his moms' new boyfriend. A friend of mine was talking about something like this awhile back. He was saying, ""you know, if I ever do get married, the lady's going to have kids of her own already."" I swear; they based the guy in the movie 'The 40 Year Virgin' on my friend. I'm pretty much in the same situation - I mean - about dating ladies who already have kids.

Baby Boy seems to lose something with repeated viewings tho perhaps it's the editing for TV. I'm not sure now it deserves the 5 star rating, for me, that I give it.

I was put off some by the moral tone of the movie. . . It seems somehow dehumanizing to assume Jody can only be a good person - if he's able to see himself in the shoes of his potential victim. It's not dehumanizing to point out that facet of the movie, however. No. At least, it's not for me.",1333584000,,1554,4.166666666666667

No matter how many times I've seen it, I can still watch a good portion of it every time because there is always a lesson to learn or something you want to relive again. All of the characters in this movie are imperfect which makes the movie that much more believable. This movie is a ghetto love story at heart with all the
""hip"" language and mannerisms that'd you'd come to expect from a black movie. Tyrese plays a young adult that seems to never want to grow up. Taraji plays his always entertaining baby mama. His mother who has been in a few movies herself plays one of the movie's strongest roles. Ving Rames is his mother's love interest and an ex con. Snoop Dogg plays Taraji's ex and Tyrese's worst enemy! (Lol)

Pretty much everything in this movie comes together pretty seamlessly including the relationships. However, Tyrese's relationship with Taraji's character is absolutely show-stopping. They have up's and down's that are more typical in certain relationships than others, but watching it all unfold as the movie goes on is just downright exciting. The pacing in the movie is pretty good and the music works magic more than it doesn't.

No major complaints here. A modern classic in my eyes.

My daughter is 23 and everyone she knows that is her age, with a few rare exceptions, are feeling like they are between adolescence and adulthood. They are confused and rely way too much on their parents. Partly because of the expense of everything now, but also because they don't feel ready for all of the adult responsibilities that society demands of them. I have friends with 30 year old kids living with them. Yes, there was a lot of cussing, violence and sex scenes in the movie, but that is part of the culture of this youngest generation. They are exposed to it every day. Atleast Jody grew up at the end of the film. Unfortunately, there are men twice his age that haven't made the leap. I was married to one, lol.

1298945,3,B00003CY51,"I saw this movie when it was released and not again till last night.  I was a fan of John Singleton's work and understood from interviews that his movies up to this point were his own ""triology"" of Black male life experiences in South Central L.A. This movie touched on a lot of ills in the Black community but didn't offer solutions tied up in a bow at the movie's end so to me it is an episodic few weeks in the life of one character, Jody aka ""Baby Boy"".

After my second viewing this isn't a movie that I'd add to my favorite list or that I want to see in entirety again though I would probably watch my favorite scenes from time to time.  The pacing of the movie seems uneven to me - it was moving along fine until the Snoop character ""Rodney"" bogarts his way into Yvette's apartment after his release from jail during the final third of the movie.  Clearly the character was only introduced to add tension to the story but I wonder how it would've turned out if Singleton had just focused on the factors and/or experiences that Jody faces during the movie that might have caused him to grow up and be a man and real father to his children and left the gangster bs out.

Like another reviewer, I was a little dismayed that education is not stressed as an option for Jody and his cousin P but as in real life, people only promote what they know which is why Jody's mom (AJ Johnson) stressed that he work but never suggested that he go to college.

I gave the disc 3 stars because I really enjoyed the special feature which I guess aired on Cinemax prior to the movie's release.  I enjoyed all of the actors' comments regarding their characters and was surprised to hear Singleton state that he'd written this script for Tupac Shakur.  Once I heard that statement, I couldn't help but think about how different this movie would have been had he lived to portray this character...Tyrese was good in the role but Tupac would have been magnificent I believe.

One other positive factor for me is that there is excellent chemistry between the cast members so their performances are stronger & more believable - especially Tyrese/Ving Rhames and Tyrese/Taraji P. Henson.",1230336000,3,2168,4.468354430379747
1298946,1,B00003CY51,"John Singleton's baby Boy attempt to make a comment on the state of young black men in Los Angeles. However this irresponsible movie tends to glorify the irresponsible behavior of its male characters instead of explaining the reasons why Black men have such a hard time becoming responsible providers in their communities. Underneath all the violence, foul language and graphic sex of this film is the same disjointed writing, clumsy acting, unfocused direction and poor editing that is prominent in every John Singleton film. Why do they keep letting this guy direct movies?

Baby Boy follows the story of Jody, a 20-year-old black man who still lives with his mother. Sadly his chicken headed mother acts more like a sister than his mom. Jody has two girlfriends, and has two babies by them. He has no way to support himself and has no reason to. Mommy takes care of him and his baby mammas take care of the kids. She's trying to move on with her life doing gardening and a new man, an ex-con with two strikes against him. He's trying to start a business twenty years too late. Jody spends his days hanging out with an unbalanced homie P or driving around town in his baby mama's car. Most times Jody and the young men in this movie have no goals, no dreams, and no aspirations outside of getting drunk or high. Singleton's picture of young Black men in America is heavily distorted, full of stereotypes .

Pressured by his woman, Baby Boy starts selling stolen clothes out of the trunk of her car, and in beauty salons. She starts to get jealous when she sees him flirting with his attractive female customers. But Jody perseveres to the point where he does well for himself. Baby Boy's Mama's Man gives Jody some good advice, but Jody refuses to listen cause he doesn't like the thug who has more wisdom and experience than he does. Hello Pot? This is Kettle. You're black.

Jody starts blowing on worthless stuff like money on rims and clothes. A girl at baby mama's work starts noticing Jody and this is where the film starts losing its perspective. We get long scenes where his insecure baby mama gives him drama about cheating, and mixed signals about their relationship. The movie starts to completely fall apart when Snoop Dogg hits the screen. After a fight turns into domestic violence, Baby Boy abandons his family. Snoop fresh off parole moves himself and his pot-smoking homeboys in. After an attempted rape in front of Jody's son him and his pot smoking homies have it in for Jody. They plan a drive by which miraculously misses Jody. Later that night Jody and his mentally unstable friend plan a hit on Snoop to protect his family. The two men eventually murder Snoop. A terrified Jody returns to Mama's house and Her man helps him gets rid of the evidence. One irresponsible act leads to another irresponsible act and that puts Jody on the right track to responsible behavior. Nice message Singleton.

Baby Boy is solid in the first half, and starts to lose focus and perspective after that. The second Baby mama from the middle class neighborhood disappears after the hour mark. I never get the sense that Jody has learned his lesson despite the idealized happy ending. One thing that irked me was that there was no mention of education in this movie. Education is the most powerful tool out of poverty yet Singleton never plays it up in this movie. Also, he never explores the roots of this irresponsible behavior among black men: the long-term psychological effects of institutional racism in the black community. The Omar Gooding character who was becoming more and more mentally unbalanced and violent due to the effects of this discrimination seems to just change for the better after a baptism. I don't buy it just like I don't buy the characters in this movie have changed at all from their experiences.

Despite Singelton's unfocused direction and clunky writing, the cinematography in this movie is solid portraying the ghetto as a place that is stagnant in a world that is constantly progressing. Tyrese is Okay as Jody. He starts off weak, but gets better as the movie progresses. Ving Rhames gives a solid performance as the ex-con. Omar Gooding steals the movie with his chilling portrayal of a man about to lose his mind. Snoop Dogg is himself playing an evil gangsta without a soul.

1298995,3,B00003CY51,"John Singleton is a director that has brought us great movies that are typically based on the life of a young African American facing some sort of struggle. This, to some may seem very clich&eacute;d and in a sense it is. John Singleton gives us the stereotypical Afro American in LA setting. This is something we see a lot in ""Keeping it real"" black movies, and simply a lot of young Afro-Americans will tell you that life in these areas is simply not like it's depicted. With the clich&eacute; this film does give us a true image of what every person faces in their lives and that's the transition into adulthood when we must all leave the family nest and take flight by ourselves.

Jody is a young African American man who still lives with his mother and her new lover in LA. Jody has a son and daughter to two different women and instead of growing up and becoming a responsible adult, he still remains un-employed and scared to leave home. Jody is a man who desperately wants to turn his life around and become the responsible father that he never had, but can't get over the fear of leaving his mothers nest and flying on his own.

The cast of Ving Rhames, Tyrese Gibson, Taraji P. Henson and A.J. Johnson really make this movie blend well. There are, however some real stereotyping issues that must be discussed to really give a fair and honest portrayal of this movie. There are quite a few stereotypes in this movie that I think all will agree should not really take place in this movie if it was an attempt to give a real depiction of Afro-American life. The black kid without a Dad, the abusive boyfriend slaps around his girl yet she stays with him, the black guy who has more than one girlfriend and a child that he doesn't really care about. These are all typical African American stereotypes that I just feel if John Singleton really set out to make a serious movie then these weren't really necessary. I mentioned that this movie touches on something that we all face in our lifetime, and that's true, we all face the time when we must leave home and start a nest of our own. Some find it easier than others and this film displays someone who really can't get the courage to get out there on his own.

It is something we've seen a thousand times before and is something we will see a thousand times more, the only real triumph of this movie is the believability and chemistry of the cast. Buy it, but be warned, you've seen it all before.",1214092800,,2454,4.424778761061947

Snoop is also good as Rodney as is Omar Gooding. The best acting job comes from Ving Rhames as Jody's mom's new man and Taraji P. Henson as Jody's girl. This film is highly recommended.

1298997,2,B00003CY51,"I really, really hate this movie. John Singleton gave you great movies in the past like Boyz N The Hood,Rosewood,and Higher Learning. Rosewood was the last film of substance John Singleton made. I could say that I don't understand why Singleton made this movie but I do understand all too well. Higher Learning(which eats this movie for breakfast) was panned across the board by snotty critics and pseudo-intellectual charlatans that label every movie that dealt with issues of  race as liberal propaganda. The rest of the masses slept on it or allowed cheesy so-called hip hop publications like Jive...oops I meant Vibe ragazine to persuade their opinions. So I understand why he would make MTV-style fodder like Baby Boy and 2 Fast 2 Furious.

The movie is basically about Tyrese's Character ""Jody"" who still lives with his mom and is trying to make ends meet while having to put with his extremely pesky girl whose ex-boyfriend just got out of prison(played by Snoop Dogg). He also has to deal with his mother dating an ex-con named Melvin(Ving Rhames)that he is not too fond of. Tyrese as well as Ving Rhames do the best they can with the material they've been given but the way their characters are written in this movie gets embarrassing at times. People fail to realize that Boyz N The Hood had a brain as well as a level of awareness that is absent in filth like this movie. Laurence Fishburne's character ""Furious"" was the voice of reason in that movie. Where is his equivalent in Baby Boy? Nowhere to be found. As a matter of fact lets look at the characters of the main people in Baby Boy shall we:

Tyrese Gibson as Jody:  Irresponsible, childish rogue that still lives with his mother. He cheats on his woman, treats her like dirt and ends up living with her. He never attempts to get a real job and sees no shame in that.

AJ Johnson as Juanita: A mother that dresses like a Malibu hooker and dates a convict that has no job. She never pushes Jody to do anything with his life.

Taraji P Henson as Yvette: Naive female that suspects that her man is cheating on her and still sticks with him. She is incredibly whiny and never seems to talk to her man like a respectable woman.

Ving Rhames as Melvin: Psychotic former criminal that brags about his past misdeeds like thats something to be proud of. He grows weed in his girlfriend's backyard and allows Jody to take the blame. He mumbles nonsense about bread and butter beats his former baby mother and wonders why Jody is skeptical about him dating his mother(hell, I would have let Hannibal Lecter date my mother over this clown any day!).

Omar Gooding as SweatPea: A numbskull that curses out his girlfriend and her mother when they gave him a place to stay because he had nowhere else to go. He acts off of impulse instead of thinking it through.

Now tell me, are these the people you want to spend 2 hours of your life with? Its not like Tyrese, Ving Rhames, AJ Johnson cant act: on the contrary they did fine but the story itself stinks. To say that Cuba Gooding Jr's brother Omar Gooding cant act is the least of his problems. The movie is filled to the rim with stereotypes and cliches. Nobody seems to act like normal people but more like crazed rottweilers on heroin. Jody and Yvette never talk to each other respectfully. They fight then they have sex(and for the record only psychotic people have sex when they're angry. No matter the race). The most asinine scene in the movie is when Jody backhands Yvette after she punches him. He takes her to her bedroom and proceeds to give her a tongue delight. WTF!?! That scene is still a head-scratcher till this day. It made no sense and was in bad taste. The rape scene is was in bad taste too. Not just because of what was going to happen but the fact that all Yvette cared about was if her son was watching. Never mind her own safety. Junior cant watch this happening to me. Sick! I'll admit that I chuckled a bit when Jody and Sweatpea beat the hell out a bunch of teenage punks that jumped Jody earlier in the movie but my laughter soon turned to disgust when SweatPea whips the final victim with a belt for showing no fear.

Closing comments. Baby Boy has no conscious. Nobody with a conscious exists in Baby Boy. Just a bunch of unlikeable, stereotypical people that perpetuate those sick caricatures and myths that Follywood has been spouting about black people for years. If you want better films from John Singleton stick with Boyz N The Hood, Rosewood and Higher Learning. Baby Boy is painfully ignorant from start to finish. Now I don't recommend boycotting Black cinema because quiet as kept it was the best thing to ever happen to Follywood. Plus sentiments like that smack of bourgeosie behavior but I do recommend boycotting brainless junk like Baby Boy to force these black directors to put out better material.

I didn't like the fact that Jody played by Tyrese Gibson was always made to say ""Mama this"" and ""Mama that"" in the movie especially being a very athletic and muscular big guy like he was. ALso in Los Angeles, there are many guys who grow up in the same situation as Jody did, but that do not have a close relationship with their mother, at least Jody did continue this relationship with his mama, whether he was freeloading or not. John Singleton did a good job in this movie, and you have to experience SOUTH los angeles to really appreaciate the value and circumstance of this movie. You cant be in NEW YORK or Chicago. Tyrese always seems to make movies based on how his surroundings are and were so in that aspect he is not forgetting where he comes from. The movie was kinda long and at times had a comedic aspect to it, but overall it has continual interest sparked by whoever watches it. There are sexual situations that make for catchy and racy material, and most of the dialogue discussed in the movie is portrayed by rappers in todays hip hop scene anyway.

Baby Boy plays out like an inner city soap opera with incredible acting by the entire ensemble cast and some very interesting cinematography.  I particularly appreciated that Singleton took the gloves off with this one and didn't play around the bush with the social issues he was exploring as a storyteller.  I really thought that this was going to be a bad movie, but I was thankfully pleasantly surprised.  The movie carries a great deal of weight.  I think it is WAY better than Boyz In the Hood.  Can't compare it to Rosewood or Higher Learning because they are really different films, but it blows Poetic Justice completely out of the water.

1299100,3,B00003CY51,"This movie definitely had the potential to be an eye-opener for young black 'baby boys', but in the end it missed its mark. While quite entertaining, it failed to make a sound statement for the socially conscious viewer,which might have been alright if it had been a comedy, but it was obvious it was intended to be a drama taken seriously. And for that reason alone, I am left somewhat disappointed. First, in how passive the girlfriend Yvette's character was. Even though she screamed at Jody all the time, she still basically said it was ok for him to cheat on her as long as it wasn't anyone she knew and as long as he didn't give her any diseases. Sad. He treats her horribly and even has another baby with another girl and she still keeps him. Even more sad. And although she finally kicks him out, she does nothing to get on with her life and instead mopes around the house and cries that he no longer loves her. Sadder still. But actually, what's TRULY sad is that her character probably IS 'keeping it real'. So many young girls today are JUST that insecure to allow such behavior from a man. But it would have been nice to see a stronger female role that could survive without someone who wasn't any good anyway.
But if her character had to stay the same then there could atleast have been a better ending for Jody's character. Am I the only one who didn't see a 'happy ending'? Is it just me or did nothing about Jody's character change? The only difference I noticed was that he was being nicer to his mom's boyfriend, which was only right. But it never showed that he got a job, and he still got into YVETTE's car and took out keys to YVETTE's apartment. What changed?! Looks like he went from living off of his mother to living off of Yvette. It just seems to me that the mark of no longer being a 'baby boy' would have been to show him get a job, his OWN car, and a new apartment for his family. But I suppose that falls on the writer and director. The one good thing I can say is that Tyrese did the best with what he was given. I was very impressed with his acting.",1053993600,4,2082,4.26010101010101
1299101,3,B00003CY51,"John Singleton's movies typically seem to drift between the essential and pointless, and his latest, ""Baby Boy,"" which revisits the south-central Los Angeles neighborhood he chronicled in his breakthrough film, ""Boyz N The Hood,"" is no different. So much of it works, and works well, that the entire scenes and subplots that have no place burn all the much more.
The movie presents itself as a critique of young black men in America, who, as the film's opening narration states, have been ""infantilized"" by white racism. But it's not meant as a jumping-off point to chronicle race relations, but to show this infantile state is willingly embraced, and used as a womb, of sorts, to refuse responsibility.
Singleton introduces Jody, firmly played by newcomer Tyrese Gibson, as a 20-year-old father of two still living with his mother and doing what he can to avoid work and coast comfortably. He eventually embarks on a career, which involves stealing clothes off the rack and selling them wholesale.
But that doesn't stop Jody from living off the mother of one of his children Yvette (Taraji P. Henson), who loves Jody enough to let him ruin her life, if he sticks around long enough. Much of ""Baby Boy"" involves just how much she'll put up with, when she'll stop putting up with it, and what sort of ominous ""get out"" message she'll send when she does - not exactly an original setup.
But to Singleton's credit, he delivers several personal, poignant scenes that emphasize the love in their relationship, which makes the flip side of Jody irresponsibility seem all the more foolish. Unlike the director's ""Poetic Justice,"" which portrayed romance without a pulse, ""Baby Boy"" gives reason to care, and invest.
That subplot runs parallel with that of Jody's home life with mother Juanita (Adrienne Joi-Johnson) barely old enough to be Jody's mom, and new boyfriend Melvin, played by Ving Rhames in one of those intense performances that changes the chemistry when he enters. Both Juanita and Melvin, while still young, have been around the hard-time block, and want a smoother ride this time. Jody blocks it, in a way, by pushing the threat of his getting booted from the house closer and closer to surface, until it explodes, sadly, in the worst way possible.
In fact, much of ""Baby Boy"" is sad. True, but still. Henson evokes a quiet sadness and resignation as Yvette, and has a scene, directly after an argument and smack dab in the midst of a strange makeup, where all of insecure fears (Singleton subtly shows her sucking her thumb throughout the movie) roil to the surface. And when she does boot Jody, her life doesn't improve, as an ex-con boyfriend, played in suave, pot-ridden calm by Snoop Dogg, arrives on the doorstep, looking for sexual hospitality.
Snoop Dogg's character, Rodney, and the rapper's presence at all, signify a traditional flaw of Singleton movies to work in black music and modeling stars who lack the requisite acting chops to fill out a role. Only Ice Cube, among his denizens, made the leap well.
Snoop Dogg is counted on to drive the third act of the movie, and he can't, especially in scenes where Rodney is called to be menacing. Singleton includes pointless scenes, such as Snoop driving, Snoop smoking a blunt and Snoop snapping his fingers to old school Al Green. The last scene has a mark of reticent cool to it (indeed, so cool it's in the trailer) and has the mark of the star's improvisational kickin' it mode.
But Rodney's presence puts a weird spin on the final half hour, and it doesn't quite work, as Jody and best friend Sweet Pea (Omar Gooding, a little too Cuba) aim to settle the score. And there's a scene where the two chase down a group of young thugs, then beat up them one-by-one, that took the audience in the opposite direction Singleton intended them to go. In short, a lot of scenes meant as menacing fall short into slight comedy, and only Rhames serves up bad...bluster on cue every time.
Still, when ""Baby Boy"" sticks to Jody and Yvette, there's a real story. Henson, in her first significant role, shows chops to stay around for awhile. And Tyrese, as he's known in the music world, is more than serviceable. He plays both sides of emotional spectrum like he's been there before, and his Jody is an anchor of self-angst and pity that not only characterizes young black America in LA, but every race, right here, right now, wherever. Jody needs to grow up. Most of us do.",1052524800,7,4432,4.764629388816645

1299134,5,B00003CY51,"BABY BOY has all the makings of a classic cult film. It mixes urban melodrama with some great comedy. I pity the fool who takes this film too seriously! Singleton himself said he just wanted to take one of those rap videos and bring it to life. There's no real socio-political message here. It isn't about racism (there are no white people in this film and nobody blames racism for their problems) and it isn't really about life in the 'hood either. Most folks in the movie seem to live in some kind of mystical netherworld. Jody's mom lives in quite a nice house, don't you think? As does everybody else in this film. It's like Beverly Hills meets East Compton. The characters in the film act ghetto but they are most certainly NOT in the 'hood. This is some kind of idealized 'hood where brothers still have blood vendettas, bikes get stolen, people get jumped but everybody lives in a nice big house and there's plenty of Kool-Aid to go around. None of the characters in the film are particularly likeable but there isn't anybody really detestable either. Jody is lazy and irresponsible but aside from the scene in which he slaps his woman, you don't really want him to get his comeuppance or get run over by a truck. Melvin is supposedly a violent gangsta with a head on his shoulders but you can't really figure him out one way or the other. Is he trying to be nice to Jody or intimidate him? Yvette is a whiny little thing but you know she just wants Jody all to herself. Jody's cousin reminds me of Delmar in O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU. He's just there for comic relief. Even Rodney, played by Snoop Dogg, the villain of the piece, seems to be there for comic purposes. The film is far less violent than BOYS IN DA HOOD although it is loaded with profanity and nudity and sexuality. Watch Melvin and Jody's mom do it kangaroo style.
This is the kind of movie you can enjoy on late night cable if you forget all about political correctness and just have a laugh or two.",1043107200,,1973,4.4082191780821915
1299135,2,B00003CY51,"Truth be told, the first scene, where Tyrese Gibson's character Jody is explaining the meaning of ""baby boy"", is the best scene in the whole movie. It was straightforward and easy to understand. If only I could say the same about the rest of the film.
This movie has many flaws, which is surprising because this is a John Singleton (Boyz in the Hood) production. But none of the flaws have to do with too much cursing, violence, or nudity, because I'd grown accustomed to so many ""keepin'-it-real"" black movies. When I first played this movie at home, I watched the movie for 30 minutes, stopped the DVD, left to get a bite to eat, came back to the movie, and I was already asking when is the movie over. That's because there are so many plots and events happening that you may be wondering just what the hell is this film about. If I could narrow it down, it wouldn't be too attractive: Black girl is womanized, smacked, and misused by her man, but she stays with him. This scenario occurs both with Jody and his woman AND Jody's mom (A.J. Johnson) and her man-from-the-pen Melvin (Ving Rhames).
The plots then range from Jody trying to make a living selling dresses on the street, to a girl from Jody's girl's job trying to seduce him, to his girlfriend's ex coming out of prison (why are all of the thugs in the movie just coming out of prison? Okay, they're tough; we get it already, John!). Played by Snoop Dogg, Rodney, the ex, feels challenged by Jody, and eventually he tries to do Jody in. Snoop does a good job in this role; unfortunately, it's the same role that he's been playing in these hood movies numerous times before.
What truly puzzled me? Well, Jody slapped his woman, was kicked out of her crib, and got back with her towards the end; Melvin slaps his woman, and got back with her towards the end; and Melvin goes from challenging (and choking) Jody to being the best of friends with him after he saved Jody from killing himself (after Jody shot someone, I must add). Also, Jody's friend, played by Omar Gooding, was underdeveloped. He got baptised at the end of the movie, but you don't really hear too much about him during the course of the movie except that he treats his woman wrong, too.
This movie gets two stars for being incoherent, but an extra half-star goes for Tyrese's great acting performance. I look forward to seeing more of him in the future, but not in movies like this.",1041292800,5,2410,4.4795454545454545

""He just going through some things."" Personally, Baby Boy was a little too ignorant for me. Ignorance was bliss throughout the entirety of the movie. I do think that Tyrese is a good actor though. I do appluad John Singleton for wanting to address this particular issue in society. I still think Boyz N' Tha Hood was his best movie.

I guess that the setting for the movie is supposed to be the ghetto or 'hood, but I notice that people who live there have big screen TV's and fireplaces.  Pretty much the movie is about someone who won't move out of his mom's home, stop sleeping with different women, get a job, and support his kids.  Then there is the main character's loser girlfriend who FINALLY breaks up with him after he mistreated her for so long.  She gets back together with him when he almost gets killed by kicking out his criminal cousin from her apartment.  They get back together without him making an effort to change.  Then the main character argues with his mother's boyfriend, but everything is made ok when the BF takes the gun out of the main character's hand.  He and his friend just shot someone.

Johnson is great as his mother, Snoop Dogg plays the perfect thug, and the casting of the always-excellent Ving Rhames as Johnson's ex-con boyfriend who has ""seen it all, and done it all to the fullest"" was a stroke of genius on director John Singleton's part.

1299139,4,B00003CY51,"I'm a big fan of John Singleton's movies. How anyone can watch ""Boyz in the Hood"" without being touched by the struggle is beyond me. This is obviously an updated version of an older man/child struggling with how he matures, in jail or as a productive family member. Involved with all the habits of stereotyped blacks, deep inside the protagonists must decide if he chooses the mother of his child that loves him or the ways of the streets and the influence of his brothers.
While I particularly liked the storyline involving the girlfriend, most viewers will be touched by the role of Ving Rhames, the new boyfriend of his mother's. A former con with two strikes against him, Ving cuts an imposing image on the screen and shows more of a sexual side than in any other of his movies.  Snoop Dog has an excellent roleplaying himself to perfection as a worthless ex-con/ex-boyfriend. Also of significance is the peer pressure influence of his closest friend who easily should end up in jail or dead taking his friend with him.
White Americans of which I am one, live in a world not familiar with the struggles of young black American males. While I believe this movie to be overdramatized, there is still a significant truth to be viewed.

1299140,3,B00003CY51,"Singleton's solid direction didn't save the uneven pacings of this film , and not only the pacing, theres alot of Gap that occured here, i don't know what it is exactly but probably the lack of resolution and the absence of consequences that suppose to be given to some of the lead characters, i don't know maybe its just me, after Boyz n' the hood(1992) where the ending is brilliantly justified or the murkier 'Menace to Society' (1993), this one seems to be too easy going on facing the hard days yet to come, so i should probably blame it on the script.
The story opens with a fresh sequence on the definition of why a black male is defined as a baby boy, we are then introduced with the title character , Jody , A 20 yr old unachieving young man trying to break free off the directionless life on the street but seems to do little about it,instead he preffers the good old in and out and sampling other local females, despite already giving babies to his steady girlfriend and another mistress type of woman,oh yes, he also lives with his young mom who still samples on different type of thug boyfriends, that is until the biggest thug,Melvin aka Ving rhames came by , took the heart of mom, and leave Jody with oedipus angst, now i leave it to here, since it is really hard to break down a summary for this one, every scenes seems to be working like a mini episodes of themselves, which is also the weakness of this film.
Other than that , good acting, Tyrese did a good job playing Jody, considering he is a singer, and a young one at that, he got the emotion played all on the right spot (i think), Taraji Henson as the pressurized lover who bears Jody's baby, Ving ""Marcellus"" Rhames as a proud ex-old schooler who dates Jody's mom (watch for a very innovative stamina requiring squatting activity he and J's Mom perform..priceless) , Omar Gooding steals every scene he is in as Jody's cuz who's raging about his current life status, and what ""lesson of life in da street"" film is it without employing a hardcore gangsta rapper? Snoop Dog appears here looking more evil as usual, heLL, even Tupac did a cameo, sorta...
i rent this DVD without any expectation whatsoever, since one review i read gave this film a 1 outta 5,and also this film went straight rentals without showing anywhere in cinemas out here.... thus i am quite satisfied knowing that this stuff isn't really that bad, i mean Singleton's film couldn't be that bad wouldn't it? well bad it ain't only it could have been much better",1032825600,5,2505,4.483588621444201

It's about an unemployed twenty-year old with two children living under his mother's roof.  The movie is about growing up and learning from experience and what it means to be a real man.  There are still some men over twenty, even thirty still trying to figure out what being a man is.  Not to mention, there are brothas who just don't get what child support is (that also doesn't excuse sistas who think child support is supposed to be for their petty personal expense).

However, it portrayed Jody to be a typical, lazy, unemployed, whorish, cheating, wanna be hard,deadbeat,immature black male. Don't get me wrong, Tyrese did good for his first movie, but his character really had issues. First of all, he was scared to be a man, get from up under his mama, and take care of his kids. Jody's baby mama's weren't any better, they were stupid and immature as well. Then he wanted to run his mama's business knowing full well he couldn't handle his own life much less hers. To top it off, the only way he could make money was to sell dresses on the streets (a step up from drugs I guess).",1030752000,2,773,4.4125874125874125

I know people like this, so it wasn't like seeing anything new and refreshing! I felt that none of the characters had any sense, the mother, girlfriend and home-boys etc, were just extra ghetto fab. It would have been better had they shown you more of a positive transistion from immaturity to maturity. Also, why did Ving have to be an ex-convict? Why did he grow weed in momma's garden? Is Tyrese attracted to his mom sexually? Why is he hitting and running between several women? Did he ever leave L.A. in his life?

I mean come on, there are lots of young black men who hide behind their mama's still live with their mama's and really don't know what they are going to do with their lives.  There's always work at the post office and the military will at least get you outta the house (join the Air Force, not the Navy or Marines if you know what's good for you!) So I don't buy into the idea of their not being any hope for urban black youth, life is hard but c'mon now! I thought the beginning of this movie was insightful but the rest of it seemed to go in all sorts of directions. Jody and nearly every black person in this movie is overly obsessed with sex and saying four-letter words. I think this movie beats Casino in the cussing category.  It seems like Jody spends too much time getting mad about Melvin and his mom and not doing something more practical like finding a decent job and moving out.  And his babies mamas, these women need to take classes on raising their self-esteen, seems like they don't particularly mind being nothing more than sex objects and of course cussing like sailors when their kids are around.  I mean I don't care how urban you are, and I grew up in an urban neighborhood and I am from a dysfunctional family but you know what, I moved out at twenty, I worked my way through college and I am on my own.  What's Jody's excuse? This movie teaches a lesson but it has to go over the river and through the woods to do it and by that time your mind is cluttered with all the bajillion sex scenes in the movie.

1299237,1,B00003CY51,"Horrible is one of the words that comes to mind when I think of this movie.  First of all John Singleton steriotyped the characters as being negative, careless, unreasonable, disrespectful, emotionally-weak,  etc. etc.  I also found that instead of revealing story elements etc., it was  replaced with more sex scenes.  Don't get me wrong sex is good but he put it into overdrive.  And also why does the main character have to work at the car wash making minimum wage and live with his mother?  This main character also has ( you guessed it) no car. Again stereotypical.  Bootlegging women's clothes, stealing, shooting, killing, smoking, sex, violence, cursing in ALMOST EVERY SCENE.  This is not how an average blacc person anywhere behaves.  There are some that do but those characters don't make good movies because they are predictable.  They obviously want a better life etc etc.  If Singleton would have gave us some background or something of anything other than just filler scenes it would have been more effective.
It is obvious he made this movie just to make money.  He put in some music stars Tyrese, and Snoop Dogg.  Threw in some ol school classic names such as Ving Rhames and AJ Johnson, and a fine new hottie for men to drool over in Taraji Henson.  While none are bad actors(Tyrese and Henson surprised me in that category), they all suffer from the script.  A.J. Johnson plays a young mother on her own trying to have her own life while Tyrese is still at home trying to ""protect her"". Oh yeah the father is nowhere to be found and the last son she kicked out the house got shot and killed, which seemingly is what will happen to Tyrese. Her new boyfriend (as you have guessed) is an *drumrolls please* ex-con with no job.  How surprising!  Snoop plays an ex-con as well, fresh outta jail, wanting his girl back, and feuding with Tyrese.  He ultimately gets shot, of course. I won,t go further into the story of this cliched, predictable, and stereotypical movie.  You should be able to figure out what happens.
I will also say that some of the scenes are hardly believable such as Henson and Tyrese arguing outside in front of their neighbors house, each yelling and cursing at the top of their lungs.  Or what about the scene in the park where Tyrese and Cuba Gooding Jr's brother (forgot his name) stick up some kids for twenty minutes without anybody seeing them? Gooding's role all together was hardly believable.
John Singleton let out a serious dud with this movie.  It is horrendous.  I would suggest that you never see it in your life.  Singleton is capable of better, but I seriously doubt he can get worse than this.  The ending is basically wack.  It leaves you hanging, and you still don't know whats going on by the end of the movie.  No one gets arrested for capping Snoop Dogg, and after this event, everything is all merry between Tyrese and Taraji; who previoulsy couldn't talk about a something as frivolous as a TV show.  Ironically, we didn't get to see a single scene with them talking out there problems or smoething to that degree.  What happens after he smacks her across the face?  Do they just forget aobut it and not get help?  This is also stereotypical.  Why does he have to hit her? There is no purpose to that move except just taking up time and space. And at the end they just happen to wanna get married so sudden.  Where are the scenes developing the story?  This movie also drags on forever (2.5 hours) making me really despise this title.  Had it been shorter I wouldn't have had to suffer so long, and thus it would've been a better movie.
Again this movie is terrible.  It is a waste of time for you to see it.  You may also wonder why I am bashing this title.  It is because I hate wasting time that is just too precious and can be spent doing something productive.  I also hate wasting money, so I'm writing to prevent you from wasting time & money.  Overall the only good thing that saves this title is the acting.  I will say that the acting is superb, but haunted by an unmoving, uninspired, and predictable script.  It is good to laugh at but otherwise do not watch this movie for your own sake.",1010016000,4,4160,4.536290322580645

Anyhow Tyrese did a good job as Jody and I was quite suprised. He potrayed a lazy son, a decietful baby's daddy and a young man who had somewhat of a desire to do better, just caught up in temptation. His mother Addrienne Joi Johnson did a fair job, she looked rather young to be his mom, but isn't that truly the way it is. She didn't seem very supportive as a mom, but her part was to give some advice and to stand her ground on having a man in her life played by Ving Rhames. Tyrese main girl Taraji P.

We as women feel just like she did when it comes to a man we love, we want them to do right by us and if they dont, we express ourselves.

1299241,3,B00003CY51,"John Singleton's movie paints a bleak potrait on the state of black people in L.A. As a matter of fact, Singleton's movie does the biggest disservice to the communities of South Central Los Angeles. I graduated from Crenshaw High School Gifted Magnet (a school only a few footsteps away from where the movie Baby Boy was shot). I've been going to school for over 10 years in South Central and I have never once witnessed a drive-by shooting or seen someone get shot. When I visit my relatives they think they way Black Los Angelenos live is a life full of bloodshed and violence. No one in my family is a gangmember and I am not related to any gang members. I am a black male and I now attend the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Singleton's stereotypical depiction of Los Angeles Afro-Americans is biased, prejudiced and counterproductive.
Yes, I do see the need for freedom of speech and freedom of expression, but at what cost? The characters in the movie were not real life characters to me because I know no one in real life who would act like Jody or Yvette any of the other main characters. This movie depicts young black men in all of the common media stereotypes: lazy, implusive, violent, unfaithful, selfish, gang-involved, incarcerated, cheats, con-artists, hoodlums, rapists, womanizers, woman beaters, trigger-happy, etc. Black women are depicted as loud, attidunal, stupid, classless, thug-loving, and dependent. Of course, not all black people act like this. Since I am black, I see many more depictions of my own people on a daily basis as lawyers, doctors, professionals, pre-med majors, thoughtful mothers, beautiful loving fathers, etc. The thing that I find wrong with the film is that it offers no sort of growth. It's cyclical. All of the characters remain in their same tattered state. A man was shot...and suddenly it's happily ever after? A woman was beat...a suddenly it's lover's lane in the park? The ending of the film was ignorant and too utopian to be called ""real-life"" or a true depiction.
I was deeply offended that Singleton chose the route of stereotypist. Instead of trying to find different views and bring different viewpoints to the table. He uses the same, tired 'Hood formula that he rode to success with Boyz N The Hood. I am disappointed in the way Singleton showcases Black Los Angeles. Maybe because Singleton grew up in an environment full of dimwitted-women, animalistic men and gangs, doesn't mean that all of Black California is like that.
I can recall my freshman year of college last year. I was an out-of-state student in Michigan. I told them I was from Los Angeles. The reactions that they gave me were ""whoa, you're from LA, have you ever been shot at?""...""LA must be really violent, how did you survive?"" I've been asked these questions many times and it's startling. People outside of the community of South Central view it as a huge ghetto with gunfire being shot day in and day out. It's not the case. You have many different people in South Central just like any other community. And oh yeah, NOT EVERYONE IS GANG AFFLIATED. Sure gangs exist, but it's not to the point where we fear for our lives on an hour-to-hour basis, those are isolated incidents. Singleton, in his ""bluntness"" decides to throw dozens of normally isolated situations such as being attacked by a gang, drive-by shootings, etc. and act like it's normal livng. Well, it's not. I've never had aspirations of being a gang member and as a matter of fact I've never even talked to anyone in a gang. They were usually lowlifes that stuck to themselves and perished accordingly, unforunately. Also, why is it everytime Singleton does a movie on South Central there's the stereotypical drive-by sequence, that is so stupid. I've never had a drive-by on my street and none of my many friends who also live in South Central have never experienced a drive-by.
These are the many qualms I have about the film. I appreciate the great direction by Singleton, but as a writer, there were many loopholes in his script. The film itself went nowhere and was very cyclical. Many unnecessary vignettes. What was Snoop's purpose in the movie other than to add another ""big name rapper for credibilty."" It's so stupid. Singleton should be ashamed. He doesn't even live in South Central anymore. The community he talks about is one that was Pre-1992. Sure gangs and crime exist, but not to the extent Singleton glorifies. He doesn't offer any solutions to the problems of gangs or anything, he just sensationalizes the situation. He has done a major disservice to the community of South Central Los Angeles and it is a sad story. People who walk away from this film happy and not questioning themselves or the characters' actions afterwards are really lost and oblivious to misrepresentation of South Central's citizens. I could go on for a whole other essay talking about the loopholes of the script and the characters in a sociological and historical perspective, but that would be a book.",1009238400,16,5004,4.833333333333333

How's storyline and plot? Weak, bland, dry, etc. The movie provokes no real interest whatsoever, and i found myself waiting so long for the actual movie to ""rev up"", that before i knew it, it was over entirely. The movie has no point to it at all and is filled with scene after scene of endless sterotyping as to what ""the black man"" in america is. It's almost as if the director *attempted* to get every single element of thug-movie trash in there that he could. Put bluntly, this movie can almost appear as a white persons ignorant and improperly influenced attempt to portay black people. The sad part about that is african americans themselves are putting out movies like this, capitalizing on the image, and in effect *contributing* to racism.

It shows how black woman tolerate a lot of unappropriate behavior from our men and end up settling for less than what we deserve. It also shows how we subject our children to this criminal and violent behavior.
I think that it is more of a wake up call to the young parents of today, to let them know that they don't have to settle for less and the do deserve more.

This film is obviously powerful, and fun, sad and touching all at once.

Baby Boy brings Snoop Dogg to his first motion picture supporting role.  Him and Omar Gooding make a great team.  Baby Boy is a walk through letting go of innnosence, a walk some of us have taken, a walk some are taking, and a walk people will take someday in their lives.  It's too bad the film doesn't have enough grasp to give the film five stars.  Check out Baby Boy.",998352000,,645,4.289256198347108
1299318,5,B00003CY51,"Baby boy is a powerful urban drama about love, family, and relationships.  I never expected a good performance from Tyrese, but he carries it out perfectly!  Everyone does a powerful job.  Snoop Dogg's character wasn't on screen much, so Snoop Dogg fans might be a little disappointed (if they're seeing the movie for him.)  Overall a great and powerful movie with good performances, a must see.",996969600,,395,4.9393939393939394
1299319,4,B00003CY51,"WOW!
Had to see this twice in consecutive nights. You know the ""late movie"" at the 12:30 show at your local urban cinemax... Got to give to John Singleton...He's not afraid to stay in the hood. This south Central story is about a young man at the crossroads of 'manhood' who still clings to the nuances boyhood. This almost 'biblical' story takes off when ""Jody"" (played suprisingly well by neophyte r&b crooner, Tyreese Gibson) is confronted with ""lack of elbow room in the crib"" when ex-gangbanger Melvin takes up with his mom in their LA home. Melvin (Ving Rhames) is a 'kick-butt then take names' character, who's seen it all and is the apparent 'go between' in this coming of age drama.  Jody knows it's time he stepped up his game, and take care of his responsibilities. Manhood's calling and this revelation is 'too soon and too complex'. He does several things to combat this; he sells women clothes then purchases high-profile rims for his car. His baby-mama drama persists as he looks for a way to improve his situation at home.  The movie escalates when the Snoop Dogg character is introduced...Man!! Snoop must of gained some valuable acting experience starring in all those B movies Master P produced...Reason being, his acting has improved to the point where he outshines even seasoned actors with his laid back portrayal of 'Rodney' the just released con, who barges his way into the home of Jody's now ex-girlfriend.......I can say no more, other than this brother keeps it real! This is some real ghetto ish...that must be recognized...Props to John Singleton..Keep makin them gritty urban joints!",996883200,,1614,4.908424908424909
1299320,4,B00003CY51,"There are soooo many people out there that are tired of seeing the typical ""BLACK/Boyz N the Hood"" type films. I admit I was a little sceptical when I decided to see Baby Boy because every one associated it with Boyz N the Hood. True there may be some similarities but Baby Boy isn't as negative and it sets a better mood. It was a great movie that everybody can relate to. There's no constant scenes were guys are just hanging on the front porch or street corners selling drugs, drinking, smoking, and getting high. To me this movie is saying to any male (young/old, black/white) to wake up, grow up and be responsible for yourself as well as your actions. Become a MAN! Baby Boy makes you laugh, makes you cry and leaves you with a good feeling. So dispite what people are saying, this is NOT another Boyz N the Hood.",995846400,6,819,4.359477124183006
1299321,5,B00003CY51,"Without a doubt a must see.  John Singleton has been able to captures, who not only represent the African-American community, but the American community in full.  The ""mama's boy"" syndrome that plagues many single family homes and had affected this nation who is raised by women is fully addressed in this film.  This movie is critical, entertaining, and inspiring.  Hopefully after this film, reviewers and viewers won't need to mention Boyz n The Hood, everytime they think of John Singleton.  Althought the film is set in South Central, the themes relate to every major city in America.  Be you black or white, hispanic or Asian, as long as you have verged on manhood or your a woman who has dated an immature man, this is the film for you.  I won't delve into plot or character, I will just say that this film will expose many things people weren't aware of, and It will open many peoples eyes to the way they act.",995673600,3,918,4.595092024539877

John Singleton & crew did an excellent job putting together this movie. Tyrease, as well as Snoop Dogg & the rest of the cast, gave  grade A top performances. The story was great, you actual have an interest in the characters and their problems. Aside from the movie reflecting real life situations & being well written, it is also very entertaining.

The first hour of this movie was pointless and it had no plot. The writers never fully developed the story and never made us care about the characters. I couldn't care less if they all got killed. It wasn't sad, scary or romantic. Tyrese, Snoop and Ving Rhames did a great job considering what they had to work with, I don't blame them. This movie has nothing to do with the crtically acclaimed ""Boys in the Hood"", which it is often compared. This was a waste of [$] and of my precious time.

1299389,5,B00003CY51,I usually don't take the time to write reviews for any movie that I've seen but in the case of this movie I actually felt compelled to do just that. I have never really felt so many emotions while watching a movie and I have never felt such a connection with the characters. I think that this movie will have the same type of effect on many people because most every black person can relate to some aspect of this film on some level.

1299390,1,B00003CY51,"Singleton's infantile critique of African American men's Peter Pan syndrome is laughable, uncreative, and unartistic with little to go on beyond stock, racist caricatures.  While we are hungry for real stories about our own lives that help to explore our soulwounds and the complexities of urban life, this movie does nothing more than contribute to our exploitation.  Singleton treats women as nothing more than directionless victims, shallow, and one dimensional.  Our men, on the other hand, are nothing more than sex drive and fists.  This is an unfortunate addition to the pile of crap that the film industry is calling ""cutting edge.""  The film is without artistry or decent story-telling.  And it does nothing to extend a revolutionary view that is true HIP HOP.",993945600,14,769,5.161290322580645

Then she provokes him. he hits her. Oh she knew that was coming .He gets scared cause shes crying. Feels guilty so he has ""guilt"" sex with her .Oh he knows what hes doing.

7918047,3,B00003CY51,"Not sure what you're supposed to get out of this film.  Basically it's a fictional characters showing us non African American viewers what life is like in the hood of LA.  All the negative stereotypes are played out here, all that was missing was the police to turn up and shoot someone conducting a crime. It has a completely unlikable main character who like many younger generations of all races still lives with his mother in her house even though he's now an adult.  But unlike most still living at home in their twenties men though, Jody doesn't contribute anything to help his mother pay the bills or help out around the house. Jody is just a leech, he doesn't believe in getting a job, he has gotten two different women pregnant in his life so far yet isn't stepping up as a father on either front, financially or parenting wise, or seemingly doing anything to avoid becoming a father again.  In fact he's doing things like taking one of his kids' mothers cars to drive to other women's houses to sleep with them, leaving her without a vehicle to get to work and for their son's transportation needs. Any complaining about his behaviour by the various women in the film is responded to with aggressive verbal abuse, usually combined with pumping himself up to make himself look bigger while putting his chest or arms in their face.  He even does a bit of domestic violence at one stage, yet after each pathetic act goes away and pouts like he is the victim.  Jody for example justifies the fact in his head that this isn't the mother's car, even though she paid for it, because he without asking put ridiculous rims on it and tinted the windows.  Therefore he's spent money on it, it's just as much his.  Not that this is money that he earned, he makes his cash (that he doesn't take from his mother), from stealing dresses and selling them to women on the street.  In fact his whole neighbourhood does this sort of thing, there's a scene where outside an actual shop in the parking lot no one can get to their car without being hassled by various men selling everything from drugs to consumer goods.  Like I said the movie plays up the negative stereotypes. It's not just Jody who is a deadbeat, his cousin also behaves the same way to the women in his life, in fact the two at one stage armed with a gun decide to beat up some children (children who are also acting like gangsta wannabes and steal Jody's purchase from a bottle shop).

Things aren't going smoothly though for Jody and his bludging and criminal life isn't the bliss he expects it to be.  His mother (who looks way too young to be his mother, but perhaps the character just has good genes) has a new boyfriend who is often around the house and Jody can't intimidate him.  The guy tells him he used to be dumb like him when he was his age and and has done his time in jail.  Jody isn't interested in learning from the man's experience, he just wants him gone before he believes he will ask Jody's mother to kick him out of the house.  Not to mention one of his kids mothers ex is getting out of jail (Snoop Dogg) and this guy is even more pathetic and stupid than Jody and plans on moving back in with her, even though she hasn't agreed to this.  In fact this seems to be the point of the movie, Jody is a complete loser, but hey there's people out there that treat women worse than him.

It's not like this is a coming of age story for Jody or anything. You're kind of enjoying the film to some degree because by the end of it you're expecting him to either grow up and step up to be a parent or be dead.  However by the end of the film he hasn't exactly learnt anything. In fact he seems to have completely forgotten about his other kid, we never see her again for the last hour or so of the movie.",1516579200,,3774,4.3215297450424925
