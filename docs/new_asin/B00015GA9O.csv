8006953,5,B00015GA9O,"My four-year-old has only recently been introduced to Franklin the Turtle and loves the story of the precocious turtle and his friends. The animation is wonderful, with all the woodland animals that inhabit Franklin's world portrayed in glorious color that will fascinate little ones. Each episode has a theme and Franklin usually learns a moral lesson by the end of each episode. As a parent, this is one of the few children's shows that I actually enjoy watching with my child.

In this DVD, there are four episodes altogether - ""Franklin's Birthday Party"", ""Franklin's Nickname"", ""Franklin and Otter's Visit"", and ""Franklin and the Broken Globe"". The entire disc runs for about 60 mins. Additional features include:
English and French Language Tracks
Kid-Friendly Auto Play - 10 second countdown to automatically play the whole program from the main menu.
Full-screen version
Special Bonus Feature - 'Polie Pox"" episode from Rolie Polie Olie

This is quality children's programming, and I highly recommend it to preschoolers and up.",1237939200,6,1035,5.266666666666667
