8061131,5,B0009I9DY2,"Being a former Sports Illustrated Subscriber and purchasing the 1991 ""True Blue"" Video tape, I was looking for a VHS Tape or DVD on the NY Giants first Super Bowl season for a long time. After looking on Ebay with no success I decided to check out Amazon.com and finally found a game by game 1986 regular season with the NY Giants 1987 Superbowl VHS Tape ""Giants Among Men"". I liked the way Pat Summerall narrated the game by game 1986 regular season, the playoffs and of course the 1987 Superbowl. I also like the interviews with players and coaches as well as commentaries on the ""Ny Giants Defence"" back in the 1950's at Yankee Stadium. Even though the Tape was ""Used"", it was still in very good condition and it was worth the money of $39.95 to purchase the tape. I would reccommend this tape for any NY Giant fan.",1336262400,,818,4.423841059602649

8061133,5,B0009I9DY2,"If you are a true blue Giants fan, this video is a must.  From the very  beginning, you will be riveted to the two minute NFL season video, its music, game sounds and narration!  Highlights of all the Giant games, interviews with the coach and players and some unique history enhance the video.  The frequent radio calls of Jim Gordon during the most exciting plays of the season and playoffs will send chills up your spine.  I watch this video at least a couple of times a year....perfect for a workout on the treadmill or a relaxing moment to relish the greatest team in Giants history and one of the best NFL teams of all time.",1233273600,,630,4.396551724137931
8061134,5,B0009I9DY2,"This is the best ny Giant video and season ever.  I love my ny ""football giants, but 1986 will always be my favorite season.  I just turned 16 years old when the Giants won SB XXI.  Later that summer,  with my fast food job money.  I bought the ""Giants Among Men"" video, which was narrated by another great Giant and former broadcaster, Pat Summerall (notice there is no former before Giant. As the late owner Wellington Mara used to say ""Once a Giant, Always a Giant"".).  Anyway, I have watched this video at least once a year, every year for the last 20 years. There's nothing like the story of the 1986 ny Giants. It never gets old. My favorite music from that video came during the highlights of the Giants 20-7 victory over the San Diego Chargers in Week 2. Favorite season moment: When the Giants beat the Washington Redskins 17-0 in the NFC Championship Game.  The crowd noise and the ticker tape celebration at Giants Stadium as the seconds came down still sends chills up my spine today. It was a great moment.  After all those years of losing, they were going to Pasadena.  I wish I had the complete original CBS broadcasts of that game and SB XX1.",1191196800,,1158,4.450236966824645
8061135,5,B0009I9DY2,Great Video Leading up to the 39 to 20 Thrashing of the Broncos. The Giants had gone 14-2 during the 1986 season and destroyed the 49ers and Redskins in the playoffs on route to being NFL champs... If your a Giants fan this is a must own video...,1141171200,,246,4.145833333333333
8061136,5,B0009I9DY2,"Giants and football fans alike will enjoy this wonderfully written piece. With narration by Pat Summeral and great music, the video delivers on all levels.",1116892800,,155,5.24
