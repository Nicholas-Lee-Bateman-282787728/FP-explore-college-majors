5801113,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"I saw this show when it aired on AXS tv. A solid but more laid back performance from Zakk and crew. If you're unfamiliar with Black Label Society, this show would be a good introduction. Great songs performed semi-acoustic. I enjoyed it tremendously.",1378684800,9,250,4.837209302325581

5801131,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"Extreme heavy metal tends to be at the extreme edge of my musical tastes but the unBlackened (not to be confused with unplugged, it's certainly not that) approach here brought this disc well within my comfort range. It's actually pretty cool seeing the band sitting down for the whole show, & while I understand the approach is a bit mellow for them it works really well to my liking. Having them sit also gives you the benefit of actually seeing them play their instruments, something the editors did really well. The editing is marvelous, laid back with lots of prolonged shots of the guys doing what they do best. The audio/video quality is excellent, & packs a pretty hefty wow factor. Apparently Zakk was the producer as well here & I must say he put together a pretty impressive Blu-ray. Kudos to everyone involved here, awesome is a pretty accurate description of this disc.",1456704000,2,881,4.7272727272727275

5801140,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"Buying gifts for my husband is always a major headache. He seems to have everything. He is, however, a huge Zakk Wylde fan. Last year for his birthday I bought him an autographed guitar. Same thing the year before. This year he actually told me he wanted something - this DVD. Made my life a lot easier (and the gift a lot cheaper this year). He loves it. He works from home so I can hear the DVD going on the office TV when he is in there and he has thanked me numerous times. He is overly critical of anything Zakk Wylde so when he says the DVD is now how favorite, I take it to mean that any fan of BLS or Zakk will love it. And as usual you can't beat the price on Amazon with free 2-Day prime shipping.",1430611200,,707,3.9510489510489513

5801188,5,B00DHF3OMQ,I really enjoyed watching this performance. BLS and Zakk Wylde are amazing musicians.  I hope I enjoy their new album just as much.,1399680000,,131,4.695652173913044
5801189,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"I'm sure the venue itself was quite large for this show, but the stage setting was very intimate. The guys were all sitting down, and even though they played some of their heavier, more rockin songs, the real vibe was pretty mellow and appreciative. It just seemed like the band wanted to share their appreciation for their fans by revealing more of themselves and making the show an approachable and memorable experience. I thought it was a stellar concert video with excellent production and a nice window into not only Zakk, but also the rest of the band. I highly recommend this blu-ray for any fans of the band or the genre. There are plenty of electric songs, but they definitely don't shy away from the acoustic pieces and the piano pieces. Definitely a keeper.",1394841600,,768,4.696296296296296
5801190,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"Zakk, Black Label Society, and friends put on a classic, heart wrenching show, that makes the grown men cry, and the women weep.
I was fortunate enough to be at this show, and meet the BLS family from LA.  I really think Zakk outdid himself, and showed the emotional, passionate side of his persona.  Nick was given an opportunity to shine, with classic guitar riffs, that were rare, and raw.  I think the gang was extremely pleased.  Back up vocals, and piano, along with JDesus, leading the way with his bass, brought this event all together, and I would do it all over again.
Thanks LA, Zakk, and family.  xo SDMF",1393286400,,616,4.513513513513513
5801191,3,B00DHF3OMQ,"It felt more like an unplugged kind of concert to me with Zakk Wylde sitting on the drum riser for the entire concert due to a medical situation. It was a good show though... The camera work was good, the sound was good, the lighting was decent. If your a BLS fan or not, I see no reason you wouldn't enjoy this show? I just happened to be looking for a BLS concert where everybody was playing standing up!",1390521600,,406,4.151898734177215
5801192,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"Zakk never disappoints! Although for an ""acoustic"" show, he uses a lot of overdrive and distortion. Overall great sound quality and mixing. Blu ray is the way to go!",1389484800,,165,4.724137931034483
5801193,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"Zakk Wylde live! I think that sums it up. If you're a Zakk Wylde fan, buy it. Excellent video concert!",1389139200,,102,4.15
5801194,5,B00DHF3OMQ,Once again Zakk displays his breadth of musicianship with BLS. Dives deep into his Allman Brothers and Elton John influenced body of work and delivers a remarkable one night performance. The rest of the band is rock solid and it is disappointing to see ET's departure after a performance that showcases his soloing ability. If you are a fan of Zakk's from the P&G through BLS than Unblackened is a must have.,1388534400,,408,4.680555555555555
5801195,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"I get the impression that this concert was called UNBLACKENED because it is a catchy title. Right from the start of the thumping beat when the band kicks in to LOSING YOUR MIND, we get to see the skill and professionalism that makes up the brilliance of BLACK LABEL SOCIETY. Through the light and shade of some well-chosen songs, we experience one hour and 38 minutes of aural brilliance; we get to see the playing that is both the hallmark of Zach Wylde's brilliant diversity, and the reason why he has such a solid following. The 17 songs in the Blu-ray concert superbly mixed, and provide an excellent experience of Zach and his associates.
  I would highly recommend that you get the double CD, which has 23 songs and is just as superbly mixed.

 The extras on the Blu-ray are absolutely awesome. The visit to a UK prison has 55 minutes of playing and talking, both are things which come across superbly. The video quality of the UK prison visit is not as good as the concert, but I have no complaints, since the audio of Zach's playing and the Q and A are extremely good. There is an interview for the concert which is about six minutes and 15 seconds, and is thoroughly enjoyable. THE LOSING YOUR MIND video is from 1994 and is top-notch, a very nice inclusion. The photo gallery from rehearsal production and completion of the concert is great, and lasts about five minutes 20 seconds. All in all a great experience, great extras, and typical delivery of Zach Wylds excellence.",1388275200,,1484,4.588679245283019
5801196,5,B00DHF3OMQ,This DVD is a must have. PERIOD........All the other reviews take the words right out of my mouth......A MUST HAVE DVD......,1387152000,,124,4.9523809523809526

5801198,4,B00DHF3OMQ,I like that Zakk revisited his earlier pre-Black Label stuff. Great sound and picture...wish they weren't sitting down when performing.,1385510400,,135,5.8
5801199,4,B00DHF3OMQ,"I guess we should have read the setlist before purchasing because it didn't contain any of what we really wanted to see. It did introduce us to Losin' Your Mind, which we really enjoyed.  We were hoping this would be much more like what we saw this summer at Gigantour. It was a good concert though, showing Zakk's versatility. Honestly, if we knew when we bought it what we knew now, we wouldn't have bought it. But not because it wasn't good, but because it wasn't what we were looking for.",1385164800,,492,4.406593406593407
5801200,5,B00DHF3OMQ,I love Zack and have been waiting to see him perform some of the songs . Zack is a great performer,1384992000,,98,3.7142857142857144
5801201,4,B00DHF3OMQ,"Love BLS and this was a great live performance but,  They are better when fully plugged in and Jammin.  Still a great buy for BLS fans.",1384560000,,135,4.153846153846154
5801202,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"I am a big Black Label Society fan as it is, and I have all of their previous concert CD's and DVD's, and I have to say that this is the best concert I have seen yet. I mean that from both the songs they play to the quality of their performance to the quality of the DVD itself and the nice camera work. This concert has been a pleasure to watch and listen to, it's awesome.

This is not JUST a Black Label Society show, I love the fact that Zakk goes all the way back to his Pride and Glory days, then picks some from his solo days too, then pulls favorites from all over the Black Label Society catalog. Even if you aren't a fan of Hard Rock or Heavy Metal music, you will love this DVD. It's not an ""unplugged"" concert that is just named ""Unblackened"", no it truly is a one of a kind experience where Zakk and the whole band turn it down a few notches and deliver a lovely grooving mellow time. Yes there are acoustic guitars, and electrics and keyboards and pianos and drums and a GONG even! It's freakin' awesome, one of the best concerts I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of them.

Whatever your music preference, you really cannot go wrong with this show, there is so much to like here I am betting that everyone will find something they like! Get it now and enjoy!",1384560000,,1278,4.108
5801203,5,B00DHF3OMQ,Great DVD!  Of course it's Blu Ray so the quality is exceptional.  The DVD got to me on time.  Since places like Best Buy doesn't like to sell good music any more I always purchase through Amazon.  If you're a BLS fan like I am this is a great DVD to have and this is the best and probably only way to get it these days.,1384041600,,320,3.803030303030303
5801204,5,B00DHF3OMQ,The boys in BLS show us again what talent really is. The stripped down usual thunder is not missed at all because these songs may even have more power now.,1383696000,,155,4.2
5801205,5,B00DHF3OMQ,First time using Amazon and and boy was i impressed.  Not only was Unblakened cheaper but receiving this item was quick and easy.  I will order from Amazon again.  Unblackened is an amazing item and I watch it alot!,1383350400,,215,4.461538461538462
5801206,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"I love BLS , and to have this quality of video from a concert is amazing . The song selection Zakk chose for this show couldn't have been better . I highly recommend this for any Black Label fan .",1383350400,,196,3.925
5801207,5,B00DHF3OMQ,I purchased the Dvd as a companion to the mp3's. As always Zakk and the brethren never fail to entertain and give 120%.,1382572800,,119,4.217391304347826
5801208,5,B00DHF3OMQ,The Best Blu Ray zakk has ever made with full HD and the set are perfect and the setlist. 5 stars zakk.,1382313600,,103,3.727272727272727
5801209,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"I have everything Zakk Wylde has ever put on tape, CD etc...so, yes, clearly biased.  However, I'm impressed with how Zakk clearly wanted this to be as great as possible...and appears to be on top of his game, along with the band.  He's certainly had some quality issues at some shows after having too much of a good time.  Great added in video elements and a couple of older videos which are totally outstanding - one with his daughter, and one with Pride & Glory (a very under-rated band!).  A bit disappointed in any 'interviews' he does for these DVDs as none of his answers are at all serious and completely sarcastic when we'd like a little reality out of him.  He's one of the all time great guitarists that hopefully someday will open up to explaining some of that greatness.",1381017600,,783,4.524822695035461
5801210,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"BUY UNBLACKENED NOW!!!  (keep reading if mommy is unsure if you're old enough to watch)

Yes, Im a fan of live music. Yes, Im a fan of Heavy Metal. Yes, Im a fan of Zakk Wylde and Black Label Society. Yes, I was part of the Nokia crowd on March 6th 2013. Yes, this is the BEST live music DVD in my collection.

There are no lasers, no pyrotechnics, no dancing girls, no crowd surfing, no adult beverages, and no foul language (ok, there are a few swear words when Zakk introduces the band). This is NOT unplugged; it is unBLACKENed.  Zakks famous guitars like The Rebel , Bullseye, and Mirrored Doubleneck are all plugged and played during the initimate/warm setting where the focus is on TheMan, TheBand, TheVocals, TheMusic.

The unique and successful format of unBLACKENed has the band seated while playing; allowing the Hi-Def cameras to zoom in on some of the best guitar shredding ever recorded. Close-ups of the vocals capture the soulful feelings behind the lyrics. Sound on DVD is the highest quality and DVD can be enjoyed on any volume setting; my neighbors prefer Zakk cranked to the Max.

From the opening curtain drop to the Stillborn finale (new reworked version is AMAZING), unBLACKENed stimulates all the senses and leaves you satisfied but yearning to hit Replay to take The Blessed Hellride all over again.

5801212,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"I have been a fan on Zakk's work since the early 90's and I have to say that this is by far the best release by Zakk since ""Book of Shadows"".  Amazing performance, amazing quality and to see this side of Zakk's music absolutely blew me away.  Nice to see a sober and mature Zakk singing and playing with emotion and passion.  I have to admit that I didn't expect this DVD to be 1/10th as good as it is.  Band is killer and this DVD is absolutely a must for BLS/Zakk Wylde fans.  A+",1380153600,5,481,4.021052631578947
5801213,5,B00DHF3OMQ,"Absolutely incredible show. Unfortunately, I got into B.L.S. after Book of Shadows and Pride and Glory were already a few years in the past. Since buying those albums - and listening to them countless times - I have always wanted to see those songs performed live. Needless to say, I was very excited for this live recording to be released... I was counting down the days. It did not disappoint - it is a really really good show. The only thing that I can say negative is that it ended too quickly and left me wanting more. Awesome!",1380067200,,532,4.438775510204081
