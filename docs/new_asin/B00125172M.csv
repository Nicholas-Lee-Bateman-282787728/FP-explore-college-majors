8243914,3,B00125172M,"disappointingly - this contains only 3 dramatizations on 3 significant events in a Jews life

the first story regards circumcision - but - in the end - there is no justification for it except that Jews are supposed to do it

the second story concerns bar/bat mitzvahs - but instead of explaining why - the story becomes a joust between communist atheism and religion - the script leaves out the part that explains religion's victory

the third story on death is very surprising in that it has almost nothing to do with judaism - it has to do  reported ""near-death experiences"" - or the ""tunnel"" - which other religions have readily adopted - but also has been explained away by science

there's no real insight into what makes judaism any different from other religions

the dramas were somewhat interesting in themselves - altho obviously filmed on a budget - with generally good no name actors - and a mix of accents - british - american - and others
