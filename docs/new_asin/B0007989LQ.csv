8046359,3,B0007989LQ,"Poor edition, not remastered. We Bettie Page fans have to suffer through blurry, grainy images to enjoy her sweetness, playfulness and innocence. The only thing that makes worthy this edition, is the rare breed of background music that accompanies Bettie's clips: Is it R&B, Jazz, Funk-Soul, Pop-rock, Vaudeville? All of the above?. Because according to Bettie, sometimes she didn't have any music to dance on, and the type of music we hear is mostly late 60's, early 70's.
So, she never heard that music, because those clips were made in the 50's.
Just go the the latest reissue of ""Bettie Page Reveals All"", with Bettie herself in the Comments plus Bonus tracks.",1417651200,3,664,4.9375
8046360,5,B0007989LQ,What a great DVD! The quality and sound is better than any versions of this that I've seen before. Thanks!,1366416000,4,106,4.35
8046361,4,B0007989LQ,This is a great video for the fans of Bettie Page to have. Consider that there are not too many videos around of Bettie Page. It is a throw back to better times before the 60's came and recked what it was to be a man. This is why we miss Bettie.,1306195200,5,245,3.730769230769231
