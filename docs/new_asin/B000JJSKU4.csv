2672857,5,B000JJSKU4,"I bought this DVD because Leonard Nimoy of Star Trek fame and Jack Larson of the 1950's Superman fame were both in this film way back in 1952.
I am a fan of both actors.
It's especially difficult to find films with Jack Larson in them other than the old 'Adventures of Superman' show mainly because he did 'Superman' at such a young age and then could not get acting work after that because of his being so recognized as 'Jimmy Olsen'.
Jack Larson has a pretty good part in this movie.
But this is a Leonard Nimoy vehicle and he does a very good job in it helped along by a good supporting cast.
Anyway sometimes these obscure old films turn out to be gems and this is the case with ""Kid Monk Baroni"".
The story is pretty good and so is the acting. The film is also well directed. The movie is about 80 minutes in length and moves at a nice pace. It also has several other recognizable cast members in it.
By the way the quality of this DVD print is pretty good.
Anyway, Mr. Spock and Jimmy olsen in the same movie, who knew.
Check it out. You'll be glad ya did. I'm glad I did.",1199750400,8,1078,4.113744075829384
2672858,5,B000JJSKU4,"When I was a young kid I saw this movie in my local theater. It made a lasting impression on me.  The impact of fame and good looks for the boxer fascinated me.  I thought about this movie, this morality play many times over the years.  However, I could never remember the movie's name.  For years I watched TV movies hoping I would see this film again.  About a year ago I met a movie buff, and I explained the plot to him.  He said it was Kid Monk Baroni. After obtaining the video, I was surprised to find the boxer I could never forget was Leonard Nimoy.  I still think it's a great film --even after a half century!!!",1156032000,10,622,4.133333333333334
2672859,5,B000JJSKU4,I think this is the best work i've ever done. Seriously. Ever. I'm not kidding. This was a most fascinating movie about me and boxing. And being a kid and a monk at the same time.,975283200,14,179,4.0
8151150,4,B000JJSKU4,"Almost all film noirs are a morality play to some degree or another, but this movie feels like an extended psa. Whereas other movies, show through action, what the 'moral' to the story is, this one all but tells you its lessons. It is a simple film, but I found myself engaged the whole time and rooting for Paul Baroni. Leonard Nimoy, Richard Rober, and Jack Larson are particularly good in this film. The film never loses its pace, and it made me feel good inside, something that very few modern movies do.

Kid Monk Baroni is a wholesome film with a lot of positive messages about self acceptance and staying true to yourself. It's not a groundbreaking film, but it has a good heart about it.",1490918400,,695,4.47244094488189
8151151,5,B000JJSKU4,"Surprisingly good, appropriate for any audience. Good story, good acting, suspense, humor. Great family film.",1486166400,,109,6.333333333333333
8151152,4,B000JJSKU4,"Leonard Nimoy in his first starring role; it didn't make him a star, but Star Trek wasn't too far down the road. The only thing I found funny about this movie was in trying to have Leonard [spoiler alert] be a handsome woman chaser after his reconstruction surgery. Even on his best day Leonard Nimoy's face was never classically handsome; so you have to suspend credulity when watching this B movie",1441238400,,399,4.633802816901408
8151153,5,B000JJSKU4,"Far better than I thought it would be, this film showcases a young Leonard Nimoy as the title character, a deformed young man who becomes a boxer, falls in love, gets plastic surgery, becomes a weaker boxer, and ....well, eventually things work out for the best.  A bit corny at times but very enjoyable.",1434067200,,304,4.62962962962963
8151154,3,B000JJSKU4,"I had not previously seen this movie, but knew about it and Leonard Nimoy's death caused me to decide to purchase it as a gift for a friend and also finally view it.

The #1 selling point for this movie, I believe, is the fact that there is a commentary track with Leonard Nimoy, Jack Larson & Mona Knox, which was recorded prior to Ms. Knox' passing in 2008.  That track alone, justifies whatever purchase price you may pay for it.",1431561600,,432,4.320987654320987
8151155,5,B000JJSKU4,Great movie.  If you are a Leonard Nimoy fan this is a rare chance to see him real early in his career in a staring role.  Don't miss it!,1430870400,,137,3.689655172413793

8151157,4,B000JJSKU4,"gotta love low budget boxing flicks..esp. when they star two great TV icons, Leonard Nimoy and Jack Larson.

Nimoy is the unhandsome, but masculine kid from the streets...he's got some brains, too, unlike all of his hustling buddies he hangs with. But his *one* hang up is...his looks. Fans, don't laugh at the idea of Spock looking uncool at any time his life - the make up department just twisted up his nose a bit.

An excellent script (most likely based upon ""Bells of St. Marys"" and an amalgam of every boxing film made uip until 1952) involves a nerighbor Priest (Richard Rober, exceptionally good, keeping a lid on the sentimentality), who discovers the dudes ripping apart an abandoned house just for firewood. He says, you wanna do something *constructive* with your hands? Come to the parish and let me show you some boxing moves.

So Baroni learns the art of the left hook - from no one else but the Fadda! He also discovers an interest in Church hymns. This will keep his animal instincts at bay...for a while. He'll also have a wholesome girlfriend to wipe his sweat and patch up his nicks and scrapes; and a true friend (Jack Larson), to keep an eye on him, inside and outside the ring.

Enter the semi-""connected"" boxing manager who introduces the kid to some nice fellows (blandly portrayed, I must say) with his best interests at heart.

No spoiler business here: see the movie. The ending is not ""typical"".",1401667200,4,1424,4.68
8151158,4,B000JJSKU4,"I bought this movie because it was Leonard Nimoy's first film. It was ok, but certainly not an Oscar winner.",1339027200,,108,4.45
8151159,5,B000JJSKU4,This film was a young Leonard Nimoy's first starring role as a boxer. A priest sees his potencial as a fighter and gets him started in the world of boxing. What I love about this film is how this character discovers the good he can bring to the world outside the ring. I don't understand why this doesn't get more air time on Turner Classics.  It's a great film and I'd reccomend it to anyone who loves movies. I wish that there were more films like this and it's a shame that Hollywood didn't give Leonard more roles like this one.,1318032000,2,532,4.267326732673268
