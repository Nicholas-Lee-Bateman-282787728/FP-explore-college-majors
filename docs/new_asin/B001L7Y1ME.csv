3681728,5,B001L7Y1ME,"Love the stories, especially because they are FACT not fiction.  They are so fascinating and yet so little was previously known about these cities.  I definitely recommend the whole series.",1391299200,,189,5.266666666666667

3681731,5,B001L7Y1ME,"This is such a great series. I loved every minute of it. Each episode is compelling and interesting. Insights into history based on what underneath the surface of the earth. If you don't look below, you're just scratching the surface on history! Pun intended! Hightly recommend!",1362960000,,278,5.065217391304348
3681732,4,B001L7Y1ME,The average person obviously couldn't get access to these places and the history attached makes it captivating to watch because you see the things that other tourist or history programs just don't show you. This is like taking it to the next level and you really see what lies beneath.  If you like history and you like a mystery then this is the show for you.,1359849600,,360,4.454545454545454
3681733,4,B001L7Y1ME,"We have gotten the first two seasons through Net Flicks and decided to buy this one as it was offered by a vendor for very little. We have been enjoying them completely. Much of my library is filled with documentaries and this was a welcome addition.  It is so amazing how cities are rebuilt on top of the old so often to create these underground networks in some of the segments. Also amazing are the segments that show how people have dug into the ground for sanctuary through out history and the natural layouts created by elements in time. He does get a little dramatic at times, but it's OK.",1308700800,2,596,4.418181818181818
3681734,4,B001L7Y1ME,"I have a lot of documentary on DVD. From Unsolved Mysteries to documentaries about True Crimes I have a big collection of DVD about History, True Crimes and The Unexplained. Cities of the Underworld is one of my all-time favorite documentary series, and the Third ( and last ) season of the show is by far the best and most interesting.

The list of Country featured in this third season is really impressing: Japan, The U.K., The U.S. (Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco), Belgium, Egypt, Turkey, Australia and many more are featured in this beautiful documentary in 13 episodes. The episodes of Season 3 are:
# DISC ONE: City of Blood(London) / Tunnels of Hell(Okinawa Japan) / Real Mafia Underground(Sicily) / Secret Sin City(Las Vegas)
# DISC TWO: Hitler's Trenches(Belgium) / Barbarians' Lair(Netherland) / Land of Manson(Los Angeles)
# DISC THREE: Gladiators: Blood Sport(Rome) / Secret Holy Land(Ethiopia) / Under the Rock(San Francisco)
# DISC FOUR: Tomb of the Lost Mummies(Egypt) / Gods of War(Turkey) / Alcatraz Down Under(Sydney)

Each episode is 45 minutes long, full of historical pictures/facts, the footage are simply phenomenal. You'll learn a lot of things just by watching this show, each episode is packed with a lot of informations about the History behind the featured city, from World War 2 to Jack The Ripper, from The Dark Ages to Alcatraz. The host is great, he's always really into it and you feel he really cares about the investigations. If you are a sucker for History then this serie will be one of your favorites too. Enjoy the Underworld !!",1307923200,8,1576,4.943396226415095
