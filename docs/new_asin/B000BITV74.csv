8087055,5,B000BITV74,"All '26 Men' are episodes based on true events. History to learn & very good quality. We have certainly enjoyed watching them more than once. They are not just shows/movies like John Wayne movies & so many other very good actors that we all enjoy watching so much. If one listens to the narration at beginning & song, it tells us something about the rangers & each episode starts where one can read that it's based on true stories.

Also very good qulity are 'The Legends of the Old West' with Jim Davis as the railroad detective & his 2 lady partners(different lady on episodes), they are also based on true stories. These ones do have their humor. Also enjoyed watching how Jim Davis & the lady detectives carry themselves.",1248307200,,725,4.576923076923077
