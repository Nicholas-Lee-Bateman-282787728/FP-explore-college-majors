7988910,4,B000093NPQ,"The big adventure in this group of episodes is Louie's first chance to actually save the world.  A magician's research into an old mechanism turns on a device that can control the weather - and it is immediately taken over by maddened ice sprites.  The result is the worst winter in history - during the summer.  Louie and the rest of the adventurers rush to the rescue with the usual comedy of errors (on Louie's part) and looks of chagrin looks (by everyone else).  But all is not lost, and we finally get to see the Louie Punch unleashed.
This is followed by a race between Melissa and her worst rival Isabel to save a poor miner who really doesn't want to be saved from a cave full of giant slugs.  Louie finds himself competing against another champion, and neither is sure what all the hullabaloo is worth it.  As different as night and day, the two instinctively understand what the priestesses of Mylee do not - everyone has their own way of doing things.
Finally, a surprisingly touching episode has our adventurers trying to steal a flower from the magician's guild in order to bring a dying old woman one last moment of joy.  Hired by a young child for the price of a piggy bank the team proves that money isn't always what makes them tick.  Louie finds the answer and improves his credibility quite a bit.
Generally by the twelfth episode I'm wondering when and how the real plot will surface, but I've enjoyed the humorous change of pace this series uses so much that I hope it goes right on - never ending, and never getting serious.  Yes I would like to see Louie really become a champion, and Melissa stop griping that the whole thing is against her will.
There is something special about the four adventurers and their sidekicks that I will hate to see disappear in the end.  The art is pleasing, as well as the music.  If you take the time to get to know this series, I think you will be surprised.",1063843200,2,1916,4.43019943019943
