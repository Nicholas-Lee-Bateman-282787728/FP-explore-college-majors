8471631,5,B005GHL3S0,"Not knowing anything about Matt I was a little hesitant to watch this video. The first thing that caught my attention was the insert that gives a quick summary of the ""arguments"" presented along with scripture references. This in itself is worth the price. The DVD is well done and breaks down why the gospels are reliable and gives a Christian who may not have a seminary background the knowledge they need to defend their faith. The telephone argument was particularly compelling to me, and I look forward to having the opportunity to share it with others.  Practical knowledge for practical people. I look forward to watching his other video.",1329264000,,645,4.863636363636363
8471632,5,B005GHL3S0,"This is a must see for all. It gives one the truth about the Gospels in a clear, detailed way. Mr. DeLockery emphasizes his points and is easy to follow. He stays true to Biblical content and inspires others to follow Jesus. This "" talk"" will help you to be stronger in your daily walk as well as introduce others to Jesus.",1318377600,,323,4.225806451612903
8471633,5,B005GHL3S0,"""Are the Gospels Reliable"" is a good resource for those who need ammunition to counter a disbelief in the reliability of the Gospels.  Mr. DeLockery is very organized, gives excellent examples, helps his audience with powerpoint slides that make note taking very easy, and backs his arguments with solid evidence.  It's obvious he's very knowledgeable of his subject matter and he explains his arguments clearly.  In the tradition of Winston Churchill, his conclusion and reemphasis of his major points makes very clear his arguments and allows his audience to reinforce the points pertinent to them.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who needs specifics to why the Gospels are a real and reliable source to the words and actions of Jesus.",1316908800,,763,5.129032258064516
8471634,5,B005GHL3S0,"The reliability and accuracy of our present-day Bible has been questioned by many over the years, and remains a hot topic of discussion. Whether you are Christian, skeptic, or simply curious, this DVD presents hard evidence to support a justified trust in the words of the Gospels found in Scripture. Matt Delockery is very knowledgeable, articulate, and organized in his delivery, and gives a great overview of this much-debated issue. It is meticulously edited and professionally produced, though I would have personally preferred the video in widescreen High Definition (HD) rather than full screen Standard Definition (SD).

Not only is Matt a very engaging and passionate speaker, but the video is complete with integrated powerpoint slides which enables the viewer to easily follow or take notes. The accompanying insert is a nice bonus and serves as an abbreviated summary of the presentation. It is easy to keep on hand and refer to if the topic comes up in daily conversation.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this resource to any and everyone! For a topic so widely discussed, Matt gives us the background evidence necessary to read the New Testament Gospels with great confidence.",1316649600,2,1197,5.196891191709844
