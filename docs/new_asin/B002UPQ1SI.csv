3992900,1,B002UPQ1SI,This is an insult to those of us who have invested in the entire DVD collections of this wonderful series!  This is NOT what fans of the best drama in the history of television have been waiting for.  I will not be buying this set and supporting Paramount with this travesty.  I'll stick to watching my collection of reruns which I taped from the original run of the series even though they are old and worn.  At least they're complete.  Shame on Paramount.,1253664000,11,457,4.457831325301205
3992901,1,B002UPQ1SI,Probably the best show ever on TV and they refuse to release any more seasons. One can only hope the executives who have decided this get fired or CBS sells the rights to someone else who will release it. Another case of the entrtainment industry trying to keep anything that speaks of God out of the marketplace.,1253145600,8,313,4.508771929824562

3992903,1,B002UPQ1SI,"this new ""inspiration collection"" is seriously on top of my most crushing blows of life list. i love this show. when i watch my season's 1-3 (intend to get 4 for Christmas)it brings me back to my entire teen years. i grew up with this show. when the series finale ended i said, ""well, at least they will put all the seasons on dvd one day and i can relive all these great memories""...i am devestated. i always dreamed of having all of those beautiful episodes all to myself to give me a lift whenever i needed it. i also would have loved to rewatch the episodes with a more adult point of view. with all the poison on tv today this show is a a treasure that should be shared with all generations, as its message is timeless-God loves us. this generation needs to know this more than ever. i sincerely hope and pray that something can be done about getting those last 5 seasons on dvd asap!",1251331200,6,889,4.266272189349112

3992907,1,B002UPQ1SI,"With nearly half of the ENTIRE SERIES already available on DVD, you'd think the next logical step would be to release Season 5, right? CBS and Paramount has apparently dropped this idea, and will only be releasing ""collections"" of the episodes that are considered the ""best"". There are only 4 episodes on this set, 3 of which has been released on DVD already.

I know I should be happy but I'm not. I assume this is for financial reasons (not like CBS and Paramount combined are hurting) and this is better than nothing but it is a lame attempt to appease the fans when nearly half of the series on DVD has been released already. Nearly every tv show known to man is being released on DVD, and they pull a stunt like this? I would say this release should not be supported, but I fear if it's not they will never release seasons of TBAA on DVD again.

3992910,5,B002UPQ1SI,"watched the show when I was young; got the tapes recently (all 9 seasons and three others) and there's only one thing to say; SHOWS ARE THE BEST, EACH AND EVERY ONE. Each episode three angels come to earth to help those souls in trouble for one reason or another. It can get a little 'hokey' now and then but nevertheless I always have a box of  Kleenex ready and cry at every single episode.  This show ran for 9 years--so that tells you all you need to know; check 'em out--you won't be sorry and if you're a husband or boyfriend reading this your girlfriend/wife will adore you. They aren't over the top about religion and the only way most of the time that anything G-d related is when one of them says; 'GOD LOVES YOU' AND NOT BEING CHRISTIAN THAT DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL. CHECK IT OUT- I PROMISE YOUR HONEY OR MAYBE BOTH MAN AND WOMEN HONEYS WILL JUST LOVE THIS SHOW!!! Roma Downy, Della Reese  and the Angel of death; John Dye are the main stars!!!!!

3992960,5,B002UPQ1SI,"When I was a kid, we had certain movies that we loved to watch at Christmastide.

Now, I have a tradition of loving to watch Christmas movies twice a year, December, and sometime during the middle of the year.

NOTE that for me, DECEMBER MOVIES start in November and end in January, sort of when stores start selling Christmas merchandise up until your neighbors take down their Christmas lights.

This DVD is a collection of wonderful, poignant, holiday episodes. Randy Travis is a guest star in three of them.

All of them are Christmas themed.

Even if you own all the seasons, it'll be nice to have this DVD available to get four Christmas shows together in one place.

So far, I only have three seasons (four sets total) plus this DVD, but eventually, Ill own them all.

3992966,5,B002UPQ1SI,"If you're looking for those really special TBAA holiday episodes from the series but can't afford to buy the complete series (or the complete seasons in which these appeared), than you want to BUY this DVD!!

Both the video and audio quality are EXCEPTIONAL for normal TVs.  I do not have a large screen TV or HD TV, which typically need a Blu-Ray format / player, so I cannot comment about how this DVD plays on those devices just using an ordinary DVD player without upscaling technology.

I particular love the episode  FEAR NOT, when Monica reveals herself to the congregation as an angel and the real celestral angelic choir sing to Hndels MESSIAH!  The continuation episode is equally impressive when we see the Lord's reason for giving us his only Son and Savior - so we can learn to forgive.

Please save yourself some time.  Don't look at the 1-Star reviews.  They are not related to the DVD and its content - just anger at the producer and license owner of the series.

I find it troubling that many fan shows negatively rate this release because they want to express their anger against CBS for not releasing later seasons (5-9) of this magnificent series.

I too love this show - but I also like the convenience of having all of the Christmas holiday specials on a single DVD.  I have actually purchased both - this DVD as well as all 9 Seasons (The Complete Series) of TBAA.

I understand your anger and frustration - but don't berate these Holiday episodes because the producer or license owners made disagreeable / bad business decisions.  Their could be other reasons they are unable to make DVD releases - perhaps contracts with the stars and / or special guest stars.

Please keep your comments relevant to the quality of the DVD (defective or poor video / audio as well as / or episodes (actors' performance and story plots).

Finally, if you haven't noticed - CBS did release all 9 seasons to DVD.  So reading those 1-star reviews is a real laugh (as well as unfounded).",1385337600,15,1990,4.610795454545454

3992994,4,B002UPQ1SI,"When Touched By Angel aired on television by kids and I tried our best to never miss an episodes. We loved that a Christian show could capture the attention of the young and the old without being preachy or overly dramatic. And we loved the idea that the God the world has forgotten (and whom we often think has forgotten us) was so present in the lives of each of His people.

It's been years since I've seen Touched By An Angel and I've longed to watch the series again so when I discovered they had a holiday collection, I decided to purchase a copy for my holiday collection.

The collection only contains 4 of the 9 seasons and is priced at $14, which I think is a little steep but I won't complain too much because I actually enjoyed the four episodes on the disc.

There's Fear Not.

An older brother (Wayne) is left to care for his mentally-challenged brother (named Joey) and has grown both weary and bitter about the whole experience. But when the angels appear to help Joey deal with the death of his friend, Wayne discovers hope.

Then there's The Feather.

The day after Christmas Wayne is beginning to doubt the hope he experienced the night before, but when his conman of a brother shows up and tries to take the town of its hard-earned money, the angels make another appearance and help Wayne put things right, while still keeping the respect of the townspeople.

Then there's An Angel On A Rooftop.

This was probably my favorite of the four. God orchestrates the meeting of a bitter old man and his ex lover's granddaughter. The meeting softens the man's heart and gives him a second chance at life.

Finally, there's It Came Upon A Midnight Clear.

To be honest, I'm not sure why the angels had to return to see Joey and Wayne, but return they did. Wayne leaves Joey home alone while he runs an errand, but when he gets into a car accident, Joey is left home to fear the worst. To help Joey pass the time, Monica tells Joey the story of Mark Twain's heartbreak and loss and his newfound hope.",1363824000,2,2011,4.425474254742547
3992995,5,B002UPQ1SI,"I really enjoyed Touched by Angel series when it was on TV, and I especially enjoyed the two Christmas episodes with Joey and his brother.

3993047,4,B002UPQ1SI,"I've noticed a lot of reviews for these sets are pretty much just complaints that they're being released instead of the remaining four/five seasons of the show. When in my experience, if a show's DVD release stops mid-run, it's usually because the previous seasons are not selling well enough to convince the studio they will make back the cost (DVD production, graphic design, menu design, music re-licensing--the BIG one!) of releasing them, let alone make a profit. Based on that, IMO Touched by an Angel fans are being given an extraordinary opportunity: to show the studio by purchasing these sets that they WILL make it worth their while to release the rest of the show. By boycotting these sets because they don't want to have to repurchase episodes when the full-season sets come out, what they're doing to themselves is making it less likely they'll ever GET those season sets. Yeah, it's kind of a pain in the neck to have to buy some episodes twice, but IMO I'd rather do that than risk never getting them at all!

Now on to the set itself: really glad I picked this one up because it has my favorite episode of the entire series on it: ""My Dinner With Andrew."" It also has the show's 100th episode, ""Psalm 151,"" which I can't remember if I saw before but really enjoyed this time around. The third episode, ""Black Like Monica,"" I have more mixed feelings about. It had a really good, necessary message to it, but I have to admit I'm not entirely comfortable with the fact that they conveyed that message by putting Roma Downey in blackface. I'd have preferred the Quantum Leap route--have her look in the mirror and see an African-American woman but we still see her as herself--or actually recasting the role just for this one episode. I think the way they did it, while I'm sure it was done with the best intentions, undermined the episode's message a little. The fourth episode, ""Netherlands,"" I haven't actually watched yet (I didn't even see it first-run on TV), so I can't give an opinion on it. *g*",1295308800,7,2017,4.649859943977591

While disappointed at being duped, they are fine episodes that are representative of the high quality spiritual and moral foundations of TBAA
Furthermore, I concur with many views already expressed revealing the manipulative behaviour of senior corporate managers involved in TBAA's production and circulation.

I only watched maybe a two/three episodes during the original run and I'm not quite done watching season 2 but I have to say from what I have watched so far it is a great TV show, inspiring with little bits of humor. It's nice to get away from the more violent shows sometimes and watch a show that tries to lift you up, cheer you up and make people's lives better. This show reminds me HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN (also a very good show).

Now as for this DVD release, what is going on? Before TV show season releases you could only buy compliation releases from Columbia House DVD and Video. That's exactly what this is, and its a ripoff. Its bad enough the 3rd and 4th seasons we're split seasons, BUT THIS IS NONSENSE. I will not pay a certain price just to get four episodes, that I may or may not have.

We the consumers want FULL SEASON RELEASES OF SEASONS 5 - 9, PLEASE? If Paramount can just do that, people will fork over the money to have the episodes put out the right way.

While I appreciate the anger of people over the release/nonrelease of the different seasons, etc. I didn't read the feedback to learn about how upset people were.  I wanted to know what episodes were on this particular DVD.  So here they are:  Fear Not (Wayne, played by Randy Travis, deals with his brother Joey's growing fear) The Feather (a con man comes to town to exploit the miracle that occurred and encounters real Angels sent by God) An Angel on the Roof (three truckers are led by a light to an Inn, where it suddenly seems like the first Christmas) and It Came Upon a Midnight Clear, which is my personal favorite, although I love all these episodes.  This one has Monica trying to calm Joey (Wayne's mentally-challenged younger brother) when Wayne is caught in a blizzard.  She tells him of the Christmas she spent with Mark Twain.

3993080,1,B002UPQ1SI,"There truly seems to be an ulterior motive against the release of the final 5 seasons of TBAA. It seems that this prejudice existed even with the release of Season 1.  Why would Season 1 be released with the Season 9  finale if not to briefly open and close the door with one release.  The Season 9 finale was an inspiration but that was due to the inspiring episodes it was based on, from Seasons 1 through 9, not Seasons 1-4.  I am undecided whether I will purchase this excuse to tantalize the fans and still not satisfy the fans. Apparently there is something afoot when profits are secondary to what appears to be at best  politically correctness or at worst, a spiritual darkness, which is driving this conscious effort to withhold the remaining seasons. I am not saying this in a vacuum. I wrote to CBS and Paramount with no reply, other than an empty acknowledgment that my message was received ""and appreciated."" Yeah, right!",1254528000,6,934,4.602409638554217
3993081,1,B002UPQ1SI,"I find it insulting that CBS is refusing to release season 5. From all the blogs and message boards, it would seem that I'm not the only one waiting for this. They already released 4 seasons and boosted their profit by splitting them into ""part 1"" and ""part 2"". If they can't make any cash why don't they sell the rights?  I have a theory and it has nothing to do with money. I personally think that the leadership at CBS is at odds with Christian values and doesn't want to release anything new that would support them. Perhaps this series has some particularly ""troubling"" Christian messages that are at odds with their liberal viewpoints. So the way to avoid releasing them and at the same time still release something is to come out with ""special"" releases that strategically avoid episodes with which CBS takes particular exception to. It's the only thing that makes sense. A season 5 release would sell many more copies than a ""special"" release like this. An analogy to this would be ""Song of the South"" which Disney won't release for reasons of ""Political Correctness"". So Disney ends up releasing parts of it in ""Special"" releases so that they can control the message and avoid any controversy. I encourage everyone interested in Touched by an Angel to contact CBS and tell them that they should be in the business of entertainment and not social filtering/engineering.",1254528000,4,1377,4.7615062761506275
