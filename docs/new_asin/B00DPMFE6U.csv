5843670,5,B00DPMFE6U,"Kaufman could sing the life of a stone and move the listener to tears----so you can imagine what Faust is like in his hands---unbelievably moving!!!  Papas plays a Mephistopheles  as terrifyingly evil as can ever be imagined in view of his oh so casual veneer--Heinrich Heine's ""Ich rief den Teufel und er kam"" personified! And that voice!  Marina Poplavskaya is riveting and has a purity of voice that is a perfect match for the character.  The updating of the action works surprisingly well and sets one thinking about the banality of evil surrounding us today.  The orchestra is wonderful and the camera work is superb.  The whole thing is simply wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  This is an amazing production to be watched again and again and again.",1397606400,4,754,4.936507936507937
5843671,5,B00DPMFE6U,"I bought this Blu-ray from another seller for a reasonable price. One week later, Amazon brought the price back to earth.  Glad that competition works.
The production is very imaginative and creative.  Although the first scene is placed after World War II and refers to the design and use of the atomic bomb, it doesnt disturb the actual human aspects of Goethes Faust. It seems to prove that the story of Faust and its encounter with the Devil is timeless and relevant no matter where and when.  The sets are modern and not too crowded and the scenes fit very well the lyrics. The cast is first class. The singers sing and act very well with each other, making the musical and the dramatic experience a compelling one.
We usually point out that opera comprises many different artistic aspects like music, acting, ballet, set designs, vocalization, etc.  I will add another one that is starting to be also a part of operas for TV viewing: Camera takes (photography).  Some of the camera takes on this Blu-ray are exceptional. They are really a work of art by themselves. The sets allow for it, and I assume the sets were designed with camera shots in mind. They certainly succeeded  in creating artistic imagery which is much more than just showing what happens on stage.
This is a keeper and I strongly recommend it.",1397174400,2,1317,4.67965367965368
5843672,4,B00DPMFE6U,"This is from the MET's HD a couple of years back, with Jonas Kaufmann in the title role, Marina Poplavskaya as Margeurite and Rene Pape as  Mephistopheles.  The setting is modern, with Dr. Faustus a scientist who is tired of his 'trade' and wishes for an early and easy death, while the Devil comes and signs him up for a new life.
Kaufmann's French is great, but he does not have much of a French 'timber', and this Faust is not as lyrical as others, like Alagna, would have it.  To match him, Pape as Mephistopheles is also more stentorian than suavely sly.
As Margeurite's brother Valentin, baritone Russell Braun does not make things overtly memorable, either, if his singing is generally fine.
The great saving aspect of this performance surprisingly comes from Russian soprano Marina Poplavskaya, who identifies herself totally with the role both vocally and dramatically.
Her King Thule ballad, the Jewel Song, her duets with Faust and the last scene are all delivered with great aplomb, and she really looks the part with a stunningly pure looking stage presence.
This production isn't appealing, with a French grand opera being cut to the bare bones, but it could have been much worse. The conducting is fine, and generally speaking on the musical side this is a sterling piece, though there are significant cuts and the Walpurgis Scene is non-existent.
Given that there are not too many outstanding Faust videos, this one is still worth seeing.",1393200000,31,1454,4.8785425101214575

5843689,2,B00DPMFE6U,"This is the ugliest production of this opera I have ever see;cold steel staircases,bareness of atomic disaster,devoid of all feeling.,not the Faust of Gounod,where the music is full of feeling from depression to beatitude.

5843690,5,B00DPMFE6U,"This is a nice, clean production of ""Faust"" for the whole family. I liked Des McAnuff's  concept of moving the timeframe into the 1940s, immediately post Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The background depicts a well known photograph of a Hiroshima building, green smoke wafting eerily past it. Faust has spent his whole life studying the sciences, theology included, but has never really experienced life and the pleasures it can offer. He feels that he has wasted his life and accomplished nothing. Goethe lets his Faust say ""Now there I stand, poor fool, and know as little as before"". So that is the mindset of Faust when this opera begins. He comes on stage slowly, supported by a cane and holding a large white handkerchief which he uses occasionally to wipe his face. He feels that he has sold people a bill of goods by pretending to know more than he actually did and is tired of all his  accumulated knowledge, most of all his knowledge of theology. He curses all of it and wants to try black magic. He summons Satan. Mephisto, one of Satan's delegates, appears in the form of a very suave looking Rene Pape and he really steals the show, I think. He moves with the grace of a cabaret dancer and seems to thoroughly enjoy himself in this role. Jonas Kaufmann, of course, makes Faust look like a very likeable man and he is aided here by the composer or librettist who left out some of Faust's evil deeds. So you feel sympathy for Faust who seems to never find the pleasures he sold his soul for. When he finds Marguerite, the young girl he saw in a vision, he does love and leave her, though, persuaded and seduced by Mephisto, although he seems to love her. So that is his misdeed in this story. Marina Poplavskaya sings a very touching Marguerite and she can hit some very high notes. I wondered why the director wanted her to look so frumpy. Her clothes and blondish hair with dark roots looked dirty while her beloved Faust looked like a sharply dressed magazine model from the 1940s. Did the director want to shift the audience's sympathy from Marguerite to Faust? Faust eventually has another vision of Marguerite and goes to see her but a duel between Faust and Marguerite's brother ensues in which the brother is fatally wounded with Mephisto's help. Faust flees and leaves the visibly pregnant Marguerite to be cursed by her brother. Marguerite is next seen in the cathedral where she has gone to pray and she apparently gives birth to the baby there, then drowns it in the holy water basin. Thankfully, nothing graphic is shown here. Next Marguerite is shown in a cage which represents her prison cell and Faust tries to persuade her to follow him when he unlocks her cell door but she sees Mephisto and senses Evil. She still loves Faust but no longer trusts him. She declines his offer and ascends the stairway to Heaven instead while Faust disappears through a trap door, presumably on his way to Hell but he then reappears in his laboratory, drinks a potion and sinks to the floor. There are many excellent singers in this production, I especially liked Michele Losier as Siebel  and I usually don't like seeing women in men's roles,but she pulls it off. There are some beautiful melodies in this opera , the well known waltz, for instance. Then there is Faust's aria ""Demeure chaste et pure...""  for which  Jonas Kaufmann received a rousing ovation and Marguerite's ""Chanson du roi de Thule"". It's all sung in French but you have the usual subtitles. Rene Pape's French diction is excellent and easily understood but Marina Paplovskaya seems to have considerable difficulty with the pronounciation. All in all, I like this production and I will watch it many more times as I always see something I had not noticed before.",1405123200,2,3736,4.671732522796352
5843691,5,B00DPMFE6U,"I first listened to Gounod's FAUST when I was 15 years old on a copy with Nicolai Gedda, Victoria de los Angeles and Boris Christoff, conducted by Andre Cluytens - a dream performance, utterly charming and convincing. However, earlier that day I had an abscessed tooth pulled by a dentist - with a pliers - the novacaine wore off just after the love duet. With Mephistophiles's laughter echoing in my ears a surge of unbelievable pain accompanied my descent into the Walpurgis Night of the devils. You don't forget something like that. Did it taint my experience of FAUST - Y E S ! ! That memory plus a snobbish commitment to the integrity of Goethe's original keeps  me from fully surrendering to Gounod's version. After all, there is also Berlioz's DAMNATION OF FAUST, superior music making covering the same plot. And Schumann's SCENES FROM FAUST, extremely faithful to Goethe. And my favorite Mahler's setting of Faust's redemption in the Eighth Symphony. Did I mention Liszt's FAUST SYMPHONY? . . . That said, I really like this version. It is beautifully sung by Jonas Kaufmann and Rene Pape, who make a winning team here as in their MET PARSIFAL. And the soprano who sings the lead equals that delightful Spanish gamin of the past, Victoria de los Angeles. I also admired the setting at a nuclear weapons site with Faust as a tormented scientist who is trying to escape his guilt by indulging himself in sex and failing miserably. Now that is a meaningful, provocative updating of the libretto. However, do not think this new interpretation makes for a dour performance. All of the highlights - Faust's arias, Marguerite's Jewel Song, Mephistophiles's satirical ballads, the Soldiers' chorus, etc. are performed with aplomb and not a trace of disheartening irony. If you closed your eyes, you'd say to yourself, THIS IS JUST WHAT MADE ME FALL IN LOVE WITH THE OPERA WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN AND EVERYTHING WAS SO FRESH AND WONDERFUL!!",1402099200,3,1935,4.8459214501510575
5843692,5,B00DPMFE6U,"I want to start with a few statements about my own taste in opera. First, I confess to being a rather new consumer of the art having taken a few classes and listened to opera daily for a few years. I own many DVDs. My taste is in traditional staging over modernized productions. I love Wagner's operas. I enjoy Verdi. (There seems to be Wagner/Verdi camps)

With that, how could I possibly give 5 stars to a modernized staging of this opera? The staging, while modernized, is not ""bare bones"" as some have said here. It's modernistic, not spartan. For comparison, I recently reviewed an extremely silly production of Parsifal that takes place with the singers dressed in leaves climbing around in bushes with lighting so poor you can hardly see them. That is modernized staging that goes to the awful. This isn't whacky. It's updated.

That updating gives me an initial pause. When I see these modernized sets, the production needs to prove itself to me. This production had me within 10 minutes. The performances are rare captures. The entire cast delivers a magnificent performance. This will be the gold standard for Faust [performances] in the future. The singing and acting are so good, it's hard to focus on the set. It's there, it adds to mood, but doesn't intrude. If you allow your mind to wonder about what they are trying to say with the bomb and war and nuclear labs, well, you'll miss a great opera.

To be clear, the performances are excellent. The acting is moving. The staging is unobtrusive---not in the way of this superb production.

So, if there is criticism, it can possibly be traced to the opera itself. Why does Faust leave the girl of his dreams in the first place? That's a big hole to leave unfilled in the story. Can't blame the setting for what isn't in the script. Gounod gives us beautiful music but as is the case with many operas, the 'plot' is a bit convoluted and the storyline is certainly flawed. Don't blame the production. When a novel becomes a movie, the producers take great liberties with the story. That can't be done with opera. Remember that.

This is a wonderful opera and I highly recommend it to anyone. And, if you are relatively new to opera and want to try a modern production that is as enjoyable as a traditional staging, try this. You'll be happy with it.

Last comment. The between scenes interviews are interesting but demeaning. I haven't explored the DVD to see if those corny interviews can be shut off. These ""half time reports"" give the opera a sporting event feel. The questions are stupid---asking Pape if he mixes up the role from day to day as in evil one day, mysterious the next, etc., is absurd. His answer is fitting. Of course he doesn't change the role from day to day, there are other singers who must respond to his part---it would be nuts to be changing it up. So please Met, stop this opera for the masses nonsense. The masses can rise. Don't stoop.

Thank you for reading this. I'd like your comments.",1402099200,26,2978,4.5969868173258
5843693,1,B00DPMFE6U,I'll not comment on the singers and the production but want to warn future buyers that the original DVD as well as its replacement sent to me were defective.

5843704,1,B00DPMFE6U,"Once again Peter Gelb has gone out of his way to ruin another great opera.  Why the great need to change the original setting with its beautiful sets and costumes?  As a senior citizen and opera ""traditionalist"", I can no longer support the Met and its disappointments, one after another.  Recent examples are the disastrous sets of Tosca, Traviata, and the Ring Cycle.  I'm waiting for them to destroy La Boheme next.  Oh, for the good old days!",1400457600,17,446,4.666666666666667
5843705,4,B00DPMFE6U,"I had my reservations about getting this Faust because I find Jonas Kaufmann's voice to be so too dark for my tastes (I generally like my tenors on the lyrico side of the things), but his portrayal of Faust was beautiful: well sung and acted.  And I had never heard of Marina Poplavskaya before this DVD.  What a voice! Even along the top and bottom with gorgeous ringing tone!  Rene Pape was of course terrific as Mephisto and the entire supporting cast was excellent (Wendy White as Martha was luxury casting in my book).  And while I had my doubts about the updated time period between the two World Wars, it actually worked well. I would recommend this production across the board.",1400371200,3,685,4.590163934426229
5843706,5,B00DPMFE6U,"It seems not to be appreciated by the public, but the entire conception of this production is to present Faust as a key atomic scientist who made possible the incineration of Hiroshima & Nagasaki.  Without a soapbox, the production daringly seeks to impute parallels between the intellectual thrills and exitements that lured Faust to pry loose deadly atomic secrets from nature --- an evil enterprise ---and Faust the seducer thrilled by the allurement of exploiting Margarite's trust and her pleas of ""You must go now.""  Both are proceeding under the auspices of Mephisto and the annhilation of the Good.  In both cases, Faust is going where the powers of darkness are showing the way.  Without these powers, the Good would be preserved.  The deadly atomic secrets would stay undiscovered and Margarite would stay unviolated.  The production equates the exciting pursuit of forbidden atomic knowledge with Faust's bringing down Margarite's defenses, both of which require invasion of forbidden realms + the resources of the powers of darkness.

The concept succeeds with great subtlety and imagination.  From the very start, the lyrics have acquired sinister double meanings equating erotic excitement and the delirium of unlocking the atomic secrets of the world.  The stage projections of limitless skies portray the avenues for future atomic attacks.  Solemn, white coated scientists with clipbpboards substitute for the thrill happy mob of other productions.  The threat of Pandora's box & the annhilation of mankind hangs palpably over everything --- scenes, stage sets, philosophy, crowd scenes, costumes --- and as the curtain descends on Margarite's seduction, the startlingly real figure of death appears at stage left making explicit  the connection between the two realms.  This production is making demands on us that demand new, higher plateaux of discussion than the usual jabber about the quality of the voices.  The old, conventional frameworks of discussion about ""who sang best?"" --- while germane ---don't unearth enough in this case.

Of course all this unfolds on a rarified and moral level that transcends historical questions about the actual Manhattan project and its mandatory historic justifications.  It carries us into the realm of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST and Mozart's operatic landscapes (with caveats, of course.).  It makes a breathtaking attempt to SUGGEST LATENT LINKAGES between singing, staging and excruciating moral responsibilities that ask if the futures of all humanity have been fatally undercut, and related issues so important as to to be capable only of being hinted at.  It will take endless viewings to begin to absorb the suble reach of this ambitious (and possibly great) innovation.",1399939200,2,2735,5.410377358490566
5843707,5,B00DPMFE6U,"Superb singing and enough to scare the Hell out of anyone.  The only detracting comment would be that Bryn Terfel's Mephestopheles in the 2011 Royal Opera House beat out Rene Pape by an inch.  Bryn Terfel in drag as the Queen of Hell just can't be beat.  Jonas Kaufmann and Marina Poplavskaya, on the other hand, were tops.  And nothing can beat the Metropolitan Orchestra and chorus.  A superb production.",1399939200,,406,4.742857142857143
5843708,5,B00DPMFE6U,"Faust

As a very young American soldier in Paris for a weekend many years ago, I attended a performance of Faust at L'Opera de Paris with its elegant marble staircases. I was enthralled before I even reached my seat in the highest balcony. I became enthralled with the opera with its beautiful music.

Set in Medieval times with appropriate costuming and somewhat of a bare stage with limited stage effects, I was captivated. I returned to my Left Bank hotel exhilarated.  Since then, I have sought first class performances on DVD, with the most recent being the Royal Opera House version a few years ago. Again, I fell in love with the opera, which brought me to an emotional wreck at the end.

Now comes the Met version done recently as a live performance on HD DVD. At first, I was not impressed, romantic that I am, with this performance. It took me three views to come around to this version. I did not like the setting; I had trouble with Kaufmann's deeper registered voice and his enunciation of French and my perception of his glottal stops. Rene Pape exhibited no such difficulties since his cultural heritage is French. He effortlessly sang through the language. Not so with Kaufmann and Poplavskaya, whose singing voices did not shape the words effectively.

Yannick Nezet-Seguin did a marvelous performance, or should I say the orchestra? My headset caught it all and I was transported back to my youth at L'Opera de Paris from many years ago.

Russell Braun was wonderful, especially in his forceful condemnation of Marguerite. Michele Losier seemed as if she were lost onstage. Her body language did not seem to fit her role as a young male infatuated with Marguerite. My headset caught a few mispronunciations.

Finally, on the third try, I came to love this version, flaws and all, and, the romantic that I am, I was crying at the end even though I found climbing the stairs to heaven a bit awkward. Reminded me of the clunky way L'Opera de Paris did that scene.

My ideal version of this opera it was not, but I am learning to live with what I got.",1399334400,10,2065,4.638356164383562

5843710,5,B00DPMFE6U,"Highly recommended. Very smart production, grest conduction, excellent singers: Kaufmann, Pape and Marina are incomparable. You get so much involved and drawn to this excellent opera.",1398384000,2,183,6.076923076923077
5843711,3,B00DPMFE6U,"Since assuming his post in 2006, Met GM Peter Gelb has made a mission of raising the house's theatrical values, significantly increasing the theater's number of new productions per season and recruiting esteemed directors not only from the opera world but from film, musical theater, and the legitimate stage. The track record of the Met's new productions in these years has been predictably mixed, ranging from the provocative (David Alden's BALLO IN MASCHERA) to the stillborn (Michael Grandage's DON GIOVANNI), from the triumphant (Franois Girard's PARSIFAL) to the calamitous (Robert LePage's multimillion-dollar high-tech RING).

Des McAnuff's previous credits include all three non-opera fields of directorial endeavor above, the legitimate stage, Broadway musicals, and film. His operatic maiden voyage, FAUST, initially seen at the English National Opera and new to the Met in 2011-12, has to be marked one of the failures of Gelb's tenure. It attempts to shake the dust off the Goethe source material by placing the action in the 20th century, the five acts unfolding on a chilly unit set, a laboratory with scaffolding on either side. Faust is a guilt-ridden, middle-aged Oppenheimer figure whose devilish bargain allows him to return to his youth circa World War I. In that era, he pursues a Marguerite who (I believe) resembles a colleague who works in his lab, a woman whom the older Faust has admired from afar. At the end of the opera, this all appears to have been a suicide dream or fantasy; Faust has poisoned himself just as he was preparing to do in Act I. McAnuff's production probably does play better on television than it did in the theater, but one still ""watches around"" it, holding to the clear (if hackneyed) story at its center like a life raft amid visuals monotonous when not discordant. Occasionally McAnuff attempts the pointed commentary of one who knows better (or believes he does), as when he juxtaposes Gounod's high-spirited Soldiers' Chorus with unscripted horrors-of-war side stories, a shell-shocked soldier panicking at a photographer's flash, a mother dissolving in tears when Valentin informs her that her son was one of the unfortunate. But in the main, the production seems faintly embarrassed, holding this sentimental-religious Victorian chestnut at arm's length without having the boldness or imagination to go whole hog and take it to a transformative level. The silly choreography of white-coated lab types in front of a projected mushroom cloud at the beginning of Act V seems in line to be the most risible stage business (there is competition; I would rather not discuss the on-stage depiction of Marguerite's labor, delivery, and infanticide), until it is trumped near the end by same white-coated lab types filing in in a liturgical formation, organ blasting away, to sing lines like ""Christ has risen! Christ is born again!"" I would like to believe the humor is intended. I have my doubts.

The reasons to own this are the musical performance running parallel to the uninspiring staging, and a single great dramatic performance. Yannick Nzet-Sguin draws from the Met Orchestra playing of such vitality, beauty, and color as to cause a listener to consider the merits of the score anew. Every one of Nzet-Sguin's Met appearances since his debut in CARMEN (also on DVD) has been an event, and this one is no exception. (His edition omits the Act V ballet.) Jonas Kaufmann, in the title role, is as thrilling and electric a performer in his way as the matinee-idol tenors of two or three generations ago, but the thrills he provides are of a more cerebral cast, which masks the sheer showmanship. Kaufmann is as likely to thrill with ostentatious soft singing as with loud singing or long-held high notes (though he can do those too). One is drawn in to his way of massaging a line, seeming to hold back until some carefully worked out point when he lets the dam burst. Only in his weakest performances does all this artful manipulation seem fussy, and this is not one of those. He is in spectacular form. So, vocally, is Ren Pape's Mphistophls, not as cavernous and chilling as some predecessors but suave of line and with a range of attractive color at his command. Russell Braun's solidly sung, uncharismatic Valentin is good without being good enough to muscle in on the stars, and I was not especially taken with Michele Losier's glassy Siebel.

The most flawed singing from any of the principals is allied to the only dramatic performance to take this static, concert-in-costume-like production and make of it gripping theater: Marina Poplavskaya's Marguerite. There is a great deal to criticize on the vocal level. One can see a worrying tension in the throat; worse, one can hear that tension. The tone has both an inappropriately cool, hollow basic quality and (on this afternoon) a slight rasp. Intonation is far from perfect. The highest notes have a squeezed, yelpy quality, and the soprano seems to have tired by the demanding final act. When she alternates the same music with Kaufmann in their love duet, she cannot come close to matching his scrupulous command of dynamics. With all of that said, there is greatness in her performance of the kind one carries around for years after seeing it. There are imagination, identification, feeling, unmistakable artistry. Whatever else she may be, Poplavskaya is never boring, and she is very smart. She has a firm grasp of who Marguerite is; she knows there has to be a slight longing in the tone in the Ballad of the King of Thule, that this virtuous and sheltered girl has fantasy and curiosity propping the door ajar for her corruption. Over and over, watching her, one feels the drama of Marguerite is being generated from the inside out; that Poplavskaya has carefully weighed the effect of every event, every interaction, every development on Marguerite, and that what we in the audience see and hear is the expression of all this. Her terror and spiritual fortitude in the church scene, her deliverance from madness and damnation in the prison finale, are riveting because they seem lived. Frankly, her efforts on the stage make 90 percent of what passes for operatic acting, the pasted-on ""look frightened/overjoyed/sad on the chord"" business that we sometimes accept as good because we are grateful even to get *that* done efficiently, look feeble and false. Poplavskaya is not merely an actor who sings, either; she has a musical intelligence and can phrase artistically. If the singing technique were anything close to the level of insight, passion, and stage skill she typically exhibits, she would be one of the all-time greats.

There is a pall over Act III and the final ovations, as this FAUST is likely to be the final production to feature veteran company mezzo Wendy White, here Marthe. White was seriously injured when she fell eight feet from an unsecured platform in a performance of the production just days after this HD broadcast, likely ending her career.

Hostess Joyce DiDonato seems as delightful offstage as on, and her interviews with the three principals contrast intriguingly: Kaufmann is generous, cheerful, and open, and is well versed in the Goethe source play. Poplavskaya is very serious and slightly aloof, focusing on mastering some stage business involving sewing, but her comments on her character are heartfelt and touching, in key with her performance. Ren Pape gives little beyond rote, slightly impatient answers, and appears to wish he were elsewhere.",1398124800,24,7512,5.040225261464199

He certainly is the Greatest tenor ever. Highly recommend all his recordings.",1446249600,,197,4.823529411764706
8596086,1,B00DPMFE6U,"The Metropolitan Opera is destroying an art form I love, an art form I thought they were supposed to protect.  And of course, I'm not supposed to say anything.  I'm just expected to talk about how great they are, possibly stay away from the productions I don't like, but whatever else, continue to send in monetary contributions.

But guess what?  Now I hate the Metropolitan Opera.  I think it would be fine if they just went out of business.  No, I don't think they should be blown up with one of their idiotic prop nukes.  Rather, they should be allowed to wither and die on the vine naturally due to their customer base getting sick of the vile trash and garbage they produce.  They can have a couple more dwindling years of red ink, then have their tearful farewell concerts, and then close down.  Then Lincoln Center can be fumigated, and however it be accomplished, whether bankruptcy court or private enterprise or whatever, the orchestra and chorus etc. can come back with a completely new management or corporation.  I will let others work out the details, then I will rejoin their customer base.

Now, what is it about atomic bombs I don't like?  Let me see if I can explain it.  They ruin people's lives.  I would like whatever committee or artiste that designed this masterpiece, or better yet their little intermission hostess, explain it to one of those unfortunate  survivors.  ""Ohio!  How are you doing?  Don't get up.  Ouch!  Some atomic bomb, eh?  Say, we're going to use it as a new theme for the opera Faust.  That's right, Faust.  Fau-su-tu.  You know, the opera.  We think it would be a clever approach.  Here, how about another bandage?  Oh dear.  Anyway, how would you like a pair of free tickets?  Oh, I see, that would be difficult.  At least come join the ballet.  OK then.  I'd like to shake your hand, but afraid it would come off.  Oh yeah, you know, don't touch the mustache, haha.  OK, sayonara!  Now wasn't that wonderful, folks?!""

Yep, it's a great Faust all right.  Cute and funny.  I'd rather watch the Exorcist and leave it on auto-repeat mode, but that's just me.

Drowning of a crying baby on stage was also a very nice touch.

ADDENDUM.  Rewatching this Blu-ray, 2 years later.  I note the soundtrack is ahead of the singers' lip movements.  During that time I have acquired a sound delay box that corrects for these DVDs and Blu-rays that are off.  In this case I have it set to 130 milliseconds and it looks much better.  You may claim my system is causing the delay, but most of my hundreds of DVDs and Blu-rays don't have the discrepancy.  And yes, I still think the production is worse than bad, despicable is a better word.",1444608000,8,2671,4.5517970401691334
8596087,5,B00DPMFE6U,I believe this is my favorite Faust performance.  It is so mesmerizing that you feel you have to see it again and agin so that you can absorb the hidden context.,1440979200,,161,4.193548387096774
