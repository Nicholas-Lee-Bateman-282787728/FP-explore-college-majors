3788007,2,B001T46T92,"This is a two CD set of the Glori-Anne Gilbert movie LUST CONNECTION (2005, Jim Wynorski) and a bonus feature that has busty identical twin hosts Jocelyn and Crystal Potter frolicking around in a bubble bath while showing clips from other ""Seduction Cinema"" films.  As a result, you get a scene with each of Seduction's stars: Taylor Wane, Friday, Monique Parent, Glori-Anne, etc., as well as a brief interlude where you see more of the twins naked.  So in that way it's a good value for the price.  The only minus is the quality of the films themselves.  While Seduction's girls are busty, they're older, so if you prefer younger chicks, this is somewhat of a disappointment.  The twins look great, for the most part, but again, you just see them frolicking around - no simulated sex (all of the scenes in Surrender films are simulated - they're not a hardcore porn company).  And the acting and writing in LUST CONNECTION is awful, though the idea (a murder mystery) is somewhat unique for a softcore film.  Then again, some guys just want big boobs and don't care for good stories or acting in their softcore, so this might work for you.  Me?  I'd say if you want a softcore movie, watch a ""Surrender Cinema"" film.  I only wish they made them with Jocelyn and Crystal Potter.",1269993600,,1278,4.615044247787611
3788008,5,B001T46T92,"What an excellent choice this was to purchase. I higly recommend this one, it has it all. A sloppy but ""hard"" plot of the main character (wich actually used to appear in most of the softcore films of the late 90`s) that actually bangs his hot busty wife repeatedly, but also fools around in the woods, in the tub, in the gym!! OMG, this guy doesnt gets tired at all...And gladly neither are we. If there's to be any sequel no question I'll certenly get it.",1263945600,,456,4.313953488372093

8340398,4,B001T46T92,"The only reason that I gave this a rating of a four was because it had a plot to it.  Oh and there were lots of tits and sex.  Some - not all - of the acting was bad.  Kind of stupid.  But if you are okay with a plot, seeing lots of tits, ass and some pussy, the buy it.",1488153600,2,270,3.377049180327869

8340401,4,B001T46T92,"We know the DVD is 1.78:1 Widescreen, but is it Anamorphic? YES. That's very important to know when purchasing a DVD and 99% of the time reviewers fail to include that info. So please, next time you review a DVD make sure you post if it is anamorphic. You can find this info on the back of your box. Sometimes it will say Anamorphic and sometimes you will see ""Enhanced for Widescreen TVs"".

A Non-Anamorphic DVD will have black bars that are abnormally large like that on ""Crimson Tide"", ""Breakdown"", ""The Abyss"" and ""True Lies"". Isn't it funny how a small studio like Secret Key can make their DVD Anamorphic but a large studio like Paramount and Fox can't be bothered to do so?. It isn't that difficult. Also, any modern DVD should be using the HD transfer without silly edge enhancements and such and at a high bit-rate for maximum quality when played on a HDMI DVD Upscaler. That will give you HD-Like quality equal to HD programming.

In any case, Bust Twins is your main movie and Strip for Action is simply a compilation of scenes from Busty Twins and other movies. It's not bad at all and is exactly the same as when I saw it play on Cinemax long ago. The DVD also has quite a few Trailers from other videos you may want to purchase as it's more useful to see the Trailers than to read a review. Busty Twins has a scene each for Adult Film stars Holly Hollywood and Chasey Lain.

In the end, it is Softcore and although I like Softcore, many people get confused and post bad reviews thinking they were cheated out of some nudity. They simply don't understand what type of movies these are and would probably be more content with X-Rated content rather than Softcore; there is a big difference. And always get the unrated versions of these Softcore movies, the R rated versions are not what you are looking for.",1395446400,,1819,4.456456456456457

Rating 2 out of 5 may not be justified.  However, this DVD has 2 movies.  For price sake, I would like to push the rating upward
to 3 stars.",1392163200,,275,4.132075471698113

8340404,2,B001T46T92,This one is bad. The nudity in this one helps it out. There are some hot scenes between two women. It is an ok movie for the price. The twins who narrate the second part while they are in the bathtub are unattractive with very bad boob jobs.,1339027200,,241,4.041666666666667
8340405,4,B001T46T92,"Ok first lets get something straight if you are looking for hardcore this is not the movie to watch. It is hands down pure softcore. The lines and jokes are very cheesey and as always very sexual innuenedo implications. But the  girls in this movie find any reason  to take their clothes off and get dirty. There is a whole lot of female nudity in this one and the breasts are without a doubt one of the best Ive ever seen on camera. The girls are older but somewhat pretty and make the grade. You don't hav eto pause in this one because pretty much every scene and and every reel features some kind of female genitalia. This script or storyline if they are worthy of having one at all will not be winning any tony or emmy awards soon, so if you're looking for a storyline don't bother. But if you wanna see naked girls and more naked girls buy this one, yes there are a few guys but you rarely see any of their parts and thats good, that is unless you're gay? But I highly reccomend this one and for the price, OMG its a steal baby ! !",1297036800,4,1036,4.123762376237623
8340406,4,B001T46T92,"It's hard to go wrong with Glori-Anne Gilbert, and she has a ton of sex scenes in this one, including one in particular that will knock your socks off (for once she is depicted adequately from behind...for the life of me I can't understand why directors don't utilize these shots more often, especially when the actress looks as good as GAG does from that angle).

Lots and lots of nudity and sex in this little film, with great scenes by Julie K. Smith (whom director Jim Wynorski called difficult on the commentary track...wow!) and the incredible, all-natural Avy Scott. And of course the aforementioned GAG, who plays dual roles here. More graphic nudity than in typical Wynorski releases, though it is of course fleeting. And the plot and acting actually are quite good: who murdered the leading man's wife? It could have been any one of the many women with whom he was having an affair...

This little DVD also is packed with extras. Calling it a two-for-one double feature is misleading, though. The second picture (""Strip for Action""...don't confuse it with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maria-Ford/dp/B00008G97W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maria Ford</a>&nbsp;movie of the same name) is NOT a movie, but rather a series of clips from other Wynorski-directed films that clocks in at under an hour, hosted by twin sisters Crystal and Jocelyn Potter who sit naked in a bubbly hot tub. Never hear of the Potter sisters before? There's a good reason for that. They are skull-rattlingly awful. No wonder they've never been in a real movie before. Just get ready to fast forward through their insipid nonsense.

Better extras, though: commentary track featuring GAG and Wynorski and tons and tons of trailers. Additionally a brief vintage stag film history lesson by 42nd Street Pete.",1278633600,3,1834,5.273972602739726
