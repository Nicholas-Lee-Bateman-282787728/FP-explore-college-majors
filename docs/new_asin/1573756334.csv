8362783,5,1573756334,"We have all 4 Popular Mechanics videos. They are among my children's favorites. They just wish theat there were more.  The whole series is very informative, yet presented in a very entertaining way. There are two  children who narrate and actually participate in all the activities ina  very hands-on approach. My children wish they could be in their place.
This one shows how they made the Aquarium of The Pacific in Long Beach.  It shows how they built the exhibits, how they dove into the ocean to  acquire the fish and the finished product. Full of wonderful information  and brought down to a child's level of understanding.
The second part of  the video is about zoos. It is also very educational and fun.",945820800,4,711,4.7317073170731705
