That criticism aside, the acting was great, and the special effects excellent for that period.  I recommend it.",1383264000,,249,5.333333333333333

4661967,3,B005DTZXL4,"""Run Silent, Run Deep"" is one of the best WW2 submarine pictures ever made.  The action is taut, the characters work well and the story is interesting.  I recommend it highly.  ""Beachhead"" is so-so and very hard to get into.  Not a great movie but worth watching once.  ""Beach Red"" just doesn't work, the story just creeps along slowly and the actors seem to have phoned in their parts.  I would recommend that, if you haven't seen these before, you rent them first, then buy this disk if you like them.",1324771200,12,503,4.472527472527473

4661982,5,B005DTZXL4,Run Silent Run Deep is a Classic movie. No fabulous glitz and effects. Good acting and great tribute the the men of the submarines in WWII pacific theatre.,1403049600,2,155,4.571428571428571
4661983,4,B005DTZXL4,"RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP is a tense WWII submarine drama comprised of Clark Gable (Commander Richardson) battling wits against an unseen Japanese enemy in his obsessive determination to destroy the vessel responsible for sinking his previous sub and responsible for the loss of his command. Clark Gable's determination leads him to vie for a new command and in doing so obtains the go-ahead to take command away from Burt Lancaster's sub. Keeping Lancaster on, as his executive officer, and the rest of Lancaster's crew aboard, Gable leads the submarine back to the Bonsai Straits to take on the enemy. Strong-willed Lancaster (Lieutenant Jim Bledsoe) and Gable battle each other every step of the way as the submarine and crew undergo relentless grueling practice drills for a tactic Gable is keeping secret to himself. Director Robert Wise brilliantly addresses themes concerning loyalty, respect, camaraderie and redemption for the characters aboard from John Gay's script based on Commander Edward L. Beach's novel. The veteran cast includes Jack Warden, Brad Dexter and Don Rickles. Veteran Special Effects man, A. Arnold Gillespie (THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO, FORBIDDEN PLANET) designed some very effective and ominous looking Japanese naval vessels adding to the atmosphere of this lurking enemy that haunts Gable. As this film intensifies to its conclusion Robert Wise builds the tension and suspense of Gable's obsession matched against the crews suspicions that perhaps their Captain has gone mad. Only Lancaster gradually recognizes the force that drives Gable and his risky plan to outwit the Japanese. This is a very good war film exploring what drives and haunts men in command and examines what tests their effectiveness and resourcefulness as leaders.

BEACHHEAD had potential and a good cast headed by Tony Curtis. The script is interesting, but ultimately the production values really hurt this one.

BEACH RED is a very odd film. Believe it or not, the titles are very good, very innovative and then it does not deliver. Again the film suffers from poor production values. At the core, the unsettling script seems in conflict with the genre. It appears ti be an anti-war and anti-military film, yet this is not entirely for certain.

All three films deserve a look and it is interesting to see three distinct styles of film making and points of view.",1398297600,7,2364,5.183246073298429
