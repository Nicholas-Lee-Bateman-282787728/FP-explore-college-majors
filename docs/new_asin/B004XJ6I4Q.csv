Seen his prints in a gallery in New Orleans in '92 wished I purchased a few, this DVD was great, you must pay attention though, lots of talking so I must read the subtitles, so no walking away, hit pause!",1413849600,,263,4.28
8446990,5,B004XJ6I4Q,It's like stepping back in time and watching what went down. This DVD provided much more than a book ever could. I love that I am able to see and hear myself what was going on around President Havel. Totally recommend this.,1287705600,2,223,4.333333333333333
