From the opening credits, I see this was originally a play. The original play may have been superior to the movie; it feels like the story had a lot it was trying to say about life, death, generational divide, the supernatural, superstitions, greed and steadfastness against it. However much potential the story had, the film adaptation couldn't pull it all off. There were definitely some disjointed parts here, and not the whole movie was completely engaging. I was getting bored, but the song Golai Golai Go toward the end did perk me up with the Aamir making those nice costume changes, from Hawaiian Luo to Urban Cowboy to Biker Bar dude.

This movie could be improved better affects (think Zamindar's ghost-vampire in the tree) and also, perhaps a different actress as Chimki. For me, she and Aamir not only lacked chemistry, but this actress also lacked the charm of actresses such as Juhi Chawla, Karisma Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit or Manisha Koirala). Lastly, the sound quality of this movie was relatively poor, as many of these Aamir movies made in this time period were.

Given its potential, it would be interesting to see another version of this story,  especially the ending made the movie worth watching.",1449619200,,1397,4.7366255144032925
8192670,4,B000PMLEDU,"Isi Ka Naam Zindagi can now be called a vintage Aamir Khan starrer. When the movie was first released, I remember, there weren't too many takers. The song 'Babam babam bam bhole', composed by Bappi Lahiri, was a moderate hit, and so was the title track sung by Anup Jalota. But the movie is indeed watchable because of the wry social comment that has been packaged intelligently as an over-the-top comedy. It is based on an acclaimed Bengali play by Manoj Mitra, which was first filmed in Bengali by Tapan Sinha as 'Banchharamer Bagan' (considered by many as a cult Bengali classic). Though the compulsions of mainstream Hindi cinema redeems the delicate flavor of the original work to some extent, yet Isi Ka Naam Zindagi deserves to be seen as a delectable comedy with a heart, and also for the fine performances of Aamir Khan, Farha Naaz and Pran.",1305763200,,850,4.7114093959731544
