8317117,5,B001L2EXHW,"Love this series. Was a High School Mathematics Teacher in Chicago for 21 years (until 1990), but my skills have become rusty after 28 years. I am preparing for part-time online or local math tutoring jobs to give me supplemental income after a move to Orlando, FL during the last week of May 2018 and needed to refresh my memory on terms and shortcuts, etc. This teacher (Jason Gibson) is perfect for my needs. He explains the concepts behind the topics he covers (in my case they are Basic Math, Algebra 1, and Algebra 2) and makes it fun as well. In fact, he is actually doing what I want to learn to do when I tutor. I also purchased the Companion worksheets and glad I did. Had to watch each section a second time before I could complete the homework sheets you print out on your own. There are important formulas you, as a teacher, must remember, and I needed to see the video a second time to write those down, memorize them in order to do the worksheets. So, I'm really going to emphasize the importance of memorization to the students I help. I also have to pass proficiency tests in the subjects I want to teach as a prerequisite to successfully landing a job tutoring and am preparing to do that with this wonderful video tutoring series. I give this product a solid A+, which is kind of cool to say if you take a look at the picture to the left..",1525910400,,1358,4.329411764705882

8317121,5,B001L2EXHW,"My son found this very useful. He will sit glued to the T.V for hours listening to the Algebra 2 Tutor and followed through with this companion worksheet CD. The numerous "" thank you Mummy"" I got from him in genuine gratitude made this one of my best purchases. I have promised him the physics,Chemstry Biology e.t.c Tutors when he gets into High school.",1462060800,,354,4.546875

is really an excellent instructor who guides You thru Math in a way that is really painless.
Anyone who wishes to refresh, go deeper or just learn will never go wrong with this Instructor!
Follow Jason Gibson and You will never be disappointed!! I have purchased nearly every one

8317123,5,B001L2EXHW,"Has to be purchased and used with Mathtutor Alg. 2 dvd which is very good. The Algebra 2 Worksheet Companion is perfect for summer preview or review.  The number of problems per section does not exceed 14-15 so don't be daunted.  And the problems are easy, focusing on basic principles not gotcha questions.

I've used Mathtutor dvd's on my son for Algebra, Precalc & Trig, Chemistry and Physics.  They calm him down and reassure him that his class is doable.  Maybe your son or daughter doesn't have a five star lecturer for a teacher like Jason Gibson, in that case these dvd's are really golden.

My son scored well using the Mathtutor dvd's and, by doing every single problem he could get his hands on from whatever source.",1343088000,,727,4.640625
8317124,5,B001L2EXHW,"I finally passed College Algebra, after running from it for years!  I never took it in high school, so it was no shocker when I took the remedial classes in college & still did poorly.  I saved this class for last.  I invested in this dvd as well as a couple of others from Jason Gibson.  I ended up taking College Algebra online & supplementing classroom time with these instructional dvds.  Algebra did not come easy for me.  I had to work my tail off-but Mr. Gibson's instructions really helped.  He's thorough without being monotonous or boring.  I highly recommend this to anyone needing clear instructions in Algebra.",1265414400,4,623,4.703703703703703
8317125,5,B001L2EXHW,"I bought the DVD's Fractions through Algebra and Algebra 2 and thought maybe I should get the worksheets, I'm very glad I did. I hadn't taken Algebra in High School and at 40 was persueing a BS in Biology so I knew I needed help. Mr. Gibson's videos and worksheets are straight forward, practical tools to learn math fast. They start easy and slowly build on what you already learned. If you struggle with math or have no prior math schooling I highly suggest you also get these worksheets and do them at the end of each video section. Just a few minutes every other day made a huge difference.

The great thing is they are pdf's so they will play on any computer anywhere. Print them out, do the exercises and then check your work in the answer section, each answer has a fully explained step by step solution to it. If you get one wrong you can easily retrace the steps and figure out where you went wrong and then get it right.

I'm now in school and I easily keep up in class and the homework is a breeze, thanks to Mr. Gibson. I feel like I was given a secret weapon.",1232668800,5,1072,4.224390243902439
