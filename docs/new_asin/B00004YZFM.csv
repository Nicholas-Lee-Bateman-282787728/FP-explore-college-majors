7927791,1,B00004YZFM,"This film is complete and utter crap.
I mean what is the point of putting a Japanese fighter in the film if you are not talking about the first or second ""Sino-Japanese"" War in China?
Also, the fight choreography was totally rehearsed and not made to look like there was any effort. BIG WASTE OF TIME by the same producers of ""The 10 Magnificent Killers"".",1463270400,,355,4.476923076923077
