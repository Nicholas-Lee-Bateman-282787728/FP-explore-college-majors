Not all of them aired in the U.S., I heard. The DVD collection does not have the same introduction as seen in America. It instead has the japanese opening. I wasn't too hot about the intro on the collection as it's the same for every episode I assume. I haven't finished watching all the discs yet. The other teknomen have names like dagger, axe and so on. The american episodes had gunner, cain etc. It seems that there is a problem with all of the disc 1's in this collection. I have read other reviews and they have had the same problem. Episodes 4 and above start skipping, resulting in the end of the episode on disc one only. The rest of the discs are fine I believe. This collection is a good price, but good luck on getting a defect free disc 1 in it. The first one I got and then exchanged for another set, have the same problem. I have played the disc 1 in a few different DVD players and a blu-ray player and it's a problem in the disc.",1217030400,5,1116,4.100456621004566

I was not so lucky, so I gave up after my second replacement.  I guess there must be a bad batch of these sets out there that all contain defective disc 1's that freeze and skip after the fourth episode on many (or all) brands of DVD players and cause computers to crash.

3137576,3,B00151QYGM,"I thought this was pretty bad.

It's a mess of an editing job by some no talent hacks. This is like a new cut, combining parts of the J version with one of the English versions.

They cut out the awesome English intro for the series and put in the awful J-pop intro that some of you who may have downloaded or bought the illegal Chinese Version may have heard before. I'm not sure if that awful J-Pop intro is the original Japanese version but the intro is pretty terrible, I would never have become a fan had I heard that intro. It's definitely not the UPN intro which was pretty great.

The video quality is bad, but better than the pirated version lol.

As for the story, it is in English, and there seems to be a lot of editing from the original although you won't find an unedited English version anywhere, all there are is the International edit version, the US edit version 1 (Blade = Slade), the US edit version 2 (Blade = Blade) and the Japanese version (unless you speak Polish or Spanish the other versions won't really work for you). [some have said this is actually the international version and the editing is not so bad, but I doubt it, I have noticed several missing parts in the first episode alone, I haven't watched the rest of the DVDs yet].

I got this for cheap enough that I wasn't TOO disappointed, but I was definitely disappointed. There is another version being sold on Amazon.com but I am unable to tell which version it is, although since it is called ""Tekkaman Blade"" I am assuming it is the J edit (which I already have *acquired*...).

I think this is a really great treat, if you saw Teknoman you'll love it and it will be totally worthy of the money. The only reason why I don't consider it excelent is because I would have liked the discs to have subtitles, japanese/latin spanish audio and perhaps some extras as opposed to only english audio, but this doesn't keep it from being a 5 star product. This are a lot of episodes for such a few bucks. I would appreciate if some time in the future there is a release with the latter adittions.",1272844800,3,761,4.255172413793104

The show is great, the animation has areas where it drops in quality (as in because of the animators not the DVD encoding)and there was an episode where the dialogue got too quiet but it's an early 90's anime to DVD so not a big deal in my opinion.

8257081,3,B00151QYGM,"The original Japanese version of this show ""Tekkaman Blade"" is fantastic.  I got hooked on it when I saw ""Teknoman"" on UPN in the U.S. years ago, and when they only aired the first half of the episodes and it got cancelled, I was crushed.  So crushed, in fact, that it drove me to purchase the Japanese laserdiscs which contained the last half of the story and watch them raw with no subtitles to find out how things ended!

So now, years later, the whole series is available as ""Teknoman.""  Is it what long-time fans were hoping for?  Well, yes and no.  The main problem for me is the change in voice actors.  If you're familiar with the original Saban production and UPN airing of the show, you'll notice differences.  For instance, BOB BERGEN NO LONGER VOICES TEKNOMAN!!  This was an extreme disappointment to me.  He did great work, and whoever they got to fill in for him sounds like he's bored half to death a lot of the time.  Also Ringo's voice is different.  Can't recall who did the original voice for him, but I was partial to his voice as well.  Star, Tina and Cmndr. Jameson all have the same voices and the voice track for them is the same!  Only a few new actors were hired.

Also, there are lots of other changes, like instead of calling him ""Slade"", they call the Teknoman ""Blade"" like in the Japanese version (maybe DC was mad they used the name ""Slade""?)  The theme is different (as others have mentioned) which is a shame, as I loved the theme by Kussa Macchi & Shuki Levy.  The Japanese songs for the opening and closing are good in their own right, if you like Japanese pop music (and the lyrics fit the show's story.)

Anyway, be prepared for a change from what you were used to, or, if you like subtitled anime, I would STRONGLY suggest buying the ""Tekkaman Blade"" DVDs.

I haven't watched all the way to the end of this version, but someone else has said that the ending is different, which is a shame if it's true.  This story ends perfectly and the only way it should.",1383782400,,1995,4.384196185286103

However, the set itself has become somewhat hard to find, and messing 2 or 3 episodes wasn't a big deal to me. I was glad to finally get the chance to see this in it's entirety. When it was on up a lot of episodes and other things were skipped over.
