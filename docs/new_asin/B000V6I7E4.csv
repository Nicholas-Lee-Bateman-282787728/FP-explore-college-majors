2930897,4,B000V6I7E4,"I am a huge Gilad fan, and was delighted to find a whole series of short but effective exercises on these DVDs.

My major complaint is that the DVD's are clearly taken from TV shows, in which presumably people are supposed to continue the moves while commercials are playing.  On the DVD, however, the program just cuts to the next sequence, with the result that you could do 3 sets of exercises one one side and nothing on the other while the DVD moves on to the next segment. This is a problem with all 9 of the short segments on all 3 of the DVD series.  To get the full workout on both sides with all the moves, you either have to stop the DVD, do the missing exercises and start it up again, or rewind it and repeat the exercises from the missing portion.

It's very annoying, particularly given that Gilad and crew have been making exercise videos for 20 years - you would think they would know better than to do something so amateurish.  Is it really that hard to put in the missing pieces in a video designed for the home market???

My other gripe is that they take FOREVER to play the TV series theme music at the beginning of each video and I can't figure out how to skip past it.  On his previous DVD's (such as the Quickfit series) you can go straight to a menu and right to the exercises.  Given that these are short, it would be nice to have the same functionality here, too.

That much being said, the exercises are great.  I will probably use these when I'm short on time, but if I have time for a full workout, I prefer his ""Ultimate Body Sculpt"" and ""Quickfit"" series because they are made for DVD users, not TV watchers.",1199923200,20,1639,4.258064516129032

2930928,4,B000V6I7E4,"Fantastic workout. Quick at only 20 minutes a day but it really works. I've done it for over a year. Gilad explains how to do the exercise correctly.  However, production quality is poor since they just reused the TV version with the pauses for commercials.",1385596800,,257,4.711111111111111
2930929,5,B000V6I7E4,i purchased this for my mom. she had wanted it for a while and absolutly loves it. she uses it every day!,1375920000,,105,3.8181818181818183
2930930,2,B000V6I7E4,I had to return the first one I received from Amazon because it was damaged. It would skip sections or just stop playing. When they sent a replacement it plays a little better but still skips. I think there is something wrong on the manufacturing side of this dvd. It is a shame because the workouts are the best in the series.,1375747200,,327,4.290322580645161
2930931,5,B000V6I7E4,"Watched Gilad's television show when I was in Japan.  His show is on Diamond Head in Hawaii. Gilad's workout is complete and doesn't require a lot of stuff to do it.  More sustained muscle control, less hype.",1368057600,,208,4.594594594594595
2930932,5,B000V6I7E4,I love the way Gilad incorporates all style of fitness in his routine.  The workouts are great for beginners.  They are a lot of fun.,1360281600,,133,4.28

2930934,5,B000V6I7E4,"ah, gilad, what can i say.  first of all he is easy on the eyes.  second of all he has great workouts that go beyond the old school aerobics, i hate those with the routines and grapevines and all, i have two left feet and no patience.  gilad has great kickboxing and weight workouts that i love.  this one is another great addition to my growing gilad collection!",1337731200,,363,4.294117647058823
2930935,5,B000V6I7E4,I did Gilad on FitTv for years.  It was suddenly and without warning discontinued and FitTv changed to Discovery Fit and Health.  A very sucky thing to do.  Anyway this tape is the exact same show I exerciesed to.  This tape filled the void left by the FitTv.,1306886400,,259,4.333333333333333
2930936,2,B000V6I7E4,"It's very simple. You're getting 3 episodes from the TV show, with nothing extra whatsoever. That's OK, I can live with that - I just wanted a DVD copy of the show so I don't always have to wake up early to do my Gilad workouts. But whoever was responsible for this DVD should be fired, because their bright idea was to remove commercial interruptions by SIMPLY CUTTING PARTS OF THE WORKOUT so that you get jarring cuts to the next set.

Like Gilad will be telling you one moment to work on the right side, and a split-second later, everybody on the screen's done and are now moving on to another exercise, so you have to scramble to catch up with them. Really, YOU CAN DO MUCH BETTER BY SIMPLY COPYING THE SHOWS FROM YOUR TV. So what exactly are you getting by shelling out your hard-earned money?

At the very least, they could have replaced the commercials with added scenes of the exercises. That way, the viewers could follow along without having to pause the DVD, finish the exercise, and then un-pause it again. I mean, that's just awkward. If they didn't have footage for those missing scenes, they could just do quick re-shoots (simple close-ups, etc., would make it easy to blend any new scenes to the old footage. It's not like they couldn't get studio time - they work out on a beach in Hawaii). They didn't. Whether they were cheap or just ignorant, I can't say. But this DVD is a dud.

I like Gilad's workouts, but because of this DVD's basic, major problem, I find myself buying and using workout DVD's from other people, like Sharon Mann (great DVD where you can mix-and-match your workouts) and Cathe Friedrich (she's got some tough workouts, so hers is one DVD where I'm glad there's the pause button!). I wish I had any assurance that the other DVD's in the series are any better, but I don't, so I don't intend to buy them. Too bad, because the workouts themselves are great (hence the 2 stars; if this DVD were really usable, I'd give it 5).",1250294400,10,1962,4.459610027855153
2930937,5,B000V6I7E4,"Everything Gilad does is fantastic. Depending on what you want to accomplish personally, he has the product for you.  These are episodes from his TV show minus the commercials.  It is what it says ""Total Body Sculpt""  Easy to learn and simple moves to perform and great for everyday staying in condition.  I do intense weight train 3 times a week with a personal trainer and do two of these episodes daily.  Gilad is a motivational force.",1235952000,,438,4.636363636363637

Gilad takes no prisoners, I love to exercise with him, the choice of light or heavy weights gives me freedom to use what is right for me at this time in my life, I am 77 years old and in good shape thanks to excercises",1455580800,,343,4.119402985074627
8216700,4,B000V6I7E4,I like this DVD. It gives me a great stregnth training session in 25 minutes. The only thing I don't like is he takes breaks like when on television. Its not a real break but probably miss a few moves.,1453507200,,201,4.05
