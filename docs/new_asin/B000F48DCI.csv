2551076,4,B000F48DCI,"... with the exception of two bits, this is NOT the material we saw at the Too Old to Die Young performance at 37 Arts in NYC.

I have mixed feelings, because I had a chance to see some other great material on the DVD; but I was disappointed, because I REALLY wanted to have a chance to re-live some hilarious moments we saw live.

If you're looking to get a video of the NYC performances, this isn't it.  If you're looking for some fresh, fun stuff from Billy, it's right here.",1152489600,,478,4.173913043478261

Wish more of his stage act was available to the U.S. market on DVD.",1150243200,9,129,3.923076923076923

2551080,1,B000F48DCI,"I remember Connelly from the old days with his versions of flying in airplanes and swimming in the ocean in Ireland etc. He was fantastic then and would have tears of laughter rolling down my cheeks.
  What a disapointment he was in this DVD,and I can only assume that with age he's gotten terrible.

  Don't waste a nickle on his humor as I was forcing myself in embarrasment to find any thing to force a laugh.",1363996800,,412,4.368421052631579
2551081,3,B000F48DCI,"Part of Billy Connolly's act is that of a distracted old man; jump to another topic while in the middle of a story, and work his way back to it. I love the style because it adds humor, but i noticed something.

This DVD uses alot of the material from 'Was it something i said?' Sure there are differences, but I paid for two seperate specials and got, like, 1.68 fresh comedy.

B.C. is hilarious, but i just want to throw out that warning.

Hope this helped! :)",1362009600,,461,4.215909090909091
2551082,5,B000F48DCI,"I first remembered Billy Connolly in Boondock Saints, and I thought, this is a cool guy. Then I started looking up some other things about him recently after hearing him on the movie ""Brave"", like how he was on Muppet Treasure Island as Billy Bones (And how he was the only person to ever be killed by a muppet). I never knew he was a stand up comedian, because quite frankly, my generation just saw him as ""Poppa"" of Boondock Saints fame.

So I started visiting these media channels and hearing about Mr. Connolly's standup bits. I told myself that I was going to gather up the funds one day and purchase a DVD or CD and just listen to him. Well that event came yesterday at a thrift store, where I found this used DVD of Billy Connolly Live In New York. The DVD looked perfect for being used. Apparently this wasn't someone's cup of tea, or they loved it so much they took great care of the DVD.

Either way, I went to watching the DVD with a fresh pair of eyes. I've stopped watching the majority of stand up comedy because of all the cursing and toilet humor. For instance, I loved seeing Richard Pryor in the movies, but when it came up to his stand up comedy, I stayed far away. I can't watch Comedy Central's Roast of anyone because it comes off to me as a humor I'll never understand. Someone made the comment on here that Robin Williams loves what Billy Connolly does in his act, and how Billy Connolly improvises a lot of things. Robin Williams is a great improvisor, but the commenter said that Robin also hides behind characters and some scripted parts.

Jeff Dunham and Robin Williams are my two favorite stand up comedians, and I figured Billy Connolly would be an ethnic flair on things, being so used to American comedians. I wasn't let down. I found myself laughing (sadly) about the poor woman who got thrown out of the double decker bus bit from Mr. Connolly. We have the Scottish Games and there is a double decker bus that goes there every year, considering that the UK got rid of those buses years ago. So I'll have to go on the bus next year with Billy Connolly's story in mind. I could have done without the last bit on the show that Billy Connolly did involving a sleeping bag and an ill woman, but the rest of the show I found highly amusing. He would shout the f word, even going on and on at one time without stopping, but I take into account his Scottish ancestry and the stereotypes that they will shout cuss words all the time like a sailor, as false as it may be.

I got tired of hearing these comedians say the n word, and drawing on the same old materials that other comedians have repeated before them. At least with Billy, I was treated to an improvised opera, a trip on a bus, a tattoo convention, and a improvised moment on a Vegemite stain. I don't recall Mr. Connolly ever speaking ill of black people, or stereotyping them as thugs/gangsters/what have you on this DVD. So Billy has taken a new seat in my small choice of stand up comedians, and he ranks up there with Robin Williams in first place in my book.",1349222400,,3050,4.336252189141856
2551083,3,B000F48DCI,"As a big Billy Connolly fan I was looking forward to this.  I owned a lot of his older stuff when I lived in Scotland but since moving to the US though, they seem to be unavailable in US format so seeing as this is one of the few that IS available I snapped it up.

I was a wee bit disappointed with this one as it's not as funny as a lot of his other stand-up's and there is material in this one that has been done a lot before BUT that is really my only main disappointment with this one.

The usual Billy traits are in this one as well from wether it's him addressing people in the audience or his unmistakable talent of going off on a tangent onto other stories and ""jokes"" then coming back to somehow remember what he was talking about in the first place!  I've always loved the way he tells his stories from when he was growing up to talking about things that he does (and we all do) and manages to make us laugh at ourselves.  He also manages to make everyday things that happen seem funny as well.  For example, in this one watch out for one of his stories about a certain little old lady on a bus in Clydebank.  I won't say any more than that as I don't want to ruin it for you, but it's just a classic example of what I mean about him making fun of everyday things.

This is still pure vintage Billy Connolly and even though it does cover older things I would still recommend buying it!!",1266796800,5,1397,4.054545454545455

2551088,1,B000F48DCI,"Unlike all other Billy Connolly dvds; this one failed to offend Catholics, Muslims, women, gays, schoolteachers,foreigners and the 'Good English' Society. My wife,children and our local priest were not offended by this 'Big Yin'offering.
This is suprising for a Clydeside comedian who has a 'no taboo' regime with his comedy.
the reason that no offense was taken is simple.
DVDs from USA do not work in the UK.
Oh yes it took yonks to deliver and the girls at work got a bit spooked with the packaging from Frankfurt airport.
Fingerpost in St Helens is still at war with the Hun.
It does have a nice box though!",1196208000,,611,4.666666666666667

2551093,1,B000F48DCI,"Billy Connolly: Live in New York is a poor recording of his comedic talent both artistically and professionally.  The stage set looks drab and poorly lit, much like an amateur would do on his first chance of recording finger puppets for a kindergarten class.  The comedian's appearance matches that of the set, leaving his grey hair standing out as if he just stepped out of the shower.  His comedy material seems impromptu, with digressions that never establishes ""The Roll"" in any of his comedy bits, stories or subjects, throughout his comedy act.  To be frank, I fell asleep 3/4 of the way through the DVD and decided to use the DVD as a beverage coaster instead.

I originally purchased the DVD based upon samples of his material I've heard from Satellite Radio, and I believe that there are far better recordings of this artist besides this DVD title.",1162857600,,857,4.763513513513513
2551094,2,B000F48DCI,"It had been a while since I had heard his jokes and standup show. But I did not find this DVD as funny as I expected it.

Yes, O'Connolly is unpredictable, but not ""Robin Williams"" umpredictable. It seems more as if he rambles around, goes on the tangent and forgets what he was talking about, and then his jokes lose momentum.

Something no one has mentioned is that the producers did not put a lot of effort in the CD. There are no ""Chapters"" to identify the main themes of the show. For foreign speakers or hearing impaired, there are no closed captions. There are no extras. Nothing. It's just a DVD which says ""Play"", and there you go...

Hopefully this helps you in your decision.",1159315200,4,686,4.428571428571429

8117241,4,B000F48DCI,"Connolly, a Scot, speaks an endearing sort of English that enhances his performance.  Some of his riffs are unforgettable, like the guy who trains suicide bombers: ""Listen very carefully, I'm only going to say this once...""  A pity he made only one touring stop in New York; now nearly 70, we may not see him again over here so this disc is the best way to enjoy his humor.",1374019200,,373,4.391304347826087
