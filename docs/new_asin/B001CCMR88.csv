8286675,5,B001CCMR88,"Cy Enfield's ""Hell Drivers"" provides a interesting peak at a young Patrick McGoohan before he played John Drake and became cool. As Red, the belligent foreman of a crooked trucking firm he exhudes malevolence. The film itself is a tough action piece that plays a bit like a Warner Brothers film from the 1930s. As the ex-con who must work where he can, even when he knows the set-up is a rotten one, Stanley Baker pits his toughness and stoicism against William Hartnell's deviousness and McGoohan's free-flying fists. The always-reliable Herbert Lom is on hand as another outsider, an Italian driver who befriends Baker (big mistake) and the young Sean Connery plays one of McGoohan's admiring cronies.",1234828800,,703,5.017094017094017
