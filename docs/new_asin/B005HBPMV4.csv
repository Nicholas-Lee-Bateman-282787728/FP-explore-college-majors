8472816,3,B005HBPMV4,"I have seen this movie several times and it is a great film, however, the quality of this DVD is not very good.  There are a lot of artifacts present in the video that look like it was authored from a badly compressed or re-encoded version of the movie.  Unfortunately this film is very hard to find and one has to settle for what is available.  It is watchable, but some may find the imperfections distracting.",1389225600,,411,4.381578947368421
