I remember felling ripped off back then but viewing the film now its actually a goos italian horror film. Just don't expect any gore or zombies.",1518566400,,306,4.293103448275862
7982620,3,B00008G7J0,"Revenge of the Dead is very tough to review.  Ignore the cover art, because it doesn't represent the movie, really.  Zeder or ROTD has a pulp mystery feel to it with a tinge of zombie and horror theme behind it.  This isn't a cannibal film or an apocalyptic flick.

That said, there are some creepy moments and interesting ideas, especially involving the K-zones.  This is more of a moody atmospheric film that's a slow burn.  The ending doesn't propel itself over other films, but it's interesting if you're in the mood for something less in your face and more quiet.

I don't know.  I like it, and I don't like it.  It's not a crowd pleaser, but it accomplishes some interesting things.  The quality of the DVD is very high.  Imagine quality is strong.",1509321600,,754,4.552238805970149
7982621,3,B00008G7J0,"This is a straight reissue of the '97 Creature Feature version, 89 min. Fascinating precursor to Pet Semetary, this is definitely worth seeking out. Appearing to have been sourced from a VHS or a TV broadcast with slightly poor reception, this is however slightly overpriced at $16. Enjoy!",1461715200,,289,5.041666666666667
7982622,4,B00008G7J0,"From reading some of the other reviews I see I am not the only one who was disappointed when I got this on DVD because I already had a vhs copy and realized that hey, they cut quite a few scenes out of this movie which I think are of value. People who see this version without the benefit of seeing the uncut version will have hardly a clue of what is going on because the movie itself is a little confusing. I loved the uncut version and I hope they release a better copy of this. I may just have to break down and buy another vhs player so that I can watch this again the way it is meant to be watched, in its' entirety.",1300838400,3,622,3.905511811023622
7982623,1,B00008G7J0,"...don't be fooled by this movie.  The only reason I bought it was because I thought, due to the cover and name, that it was going to be a zombie movie.  It is not.  Apparantly it got renamed by U.S. distributors or what not, but it has nothing to do with zombies.  The reason for the low rating is because I expected a zombie movie due to the name, cover, and quote on the top of the case.  Well I lost interest in this fairly quickly after seeing no zombies at all.  If you are looking for a zombie flick here stay clear, as it has nothing to do with them, if you are looking for the movie ""Zeder"" or whatever it is called then you found it.  I was looking for a zombie movie, didn't get it so hence the one star.",1157846400,8,715,3.958041958041958
7982624,5,B00008G7J0,"The movie 'Revenge of the Dead' was originally titled 'Zeder' and is unfortunately out of print in a US release under that title. There is a Region 2 PAL DVD of 'Zeder' which has excellent video quality unlike the US release. Philips DVD player models DVD726 and DVP642, among other Philips models, and the AMW S-99 DVD player can play the Region 2 PAL DVD with a simple 4 or 5 digit code entered from the remote (with the tray open) which can be found on videohelp.com . The Region 2 PAL DVD of 'Zeder' can be found with a froogle search (Amazon does not carry it). The DVD of 'Revenge of the Dead' listed on this page suffers from 2 issues: 1) poor video quality 2) it is missing ten minutes of the movie including two very important scenes (the same for the VHS version put out by Creature Features). Creature Features has a bad habit of cutting movies randomly to get them under 90 minutes and they slaughtered this movie. If you want a complete copy of 'Revenge of the Dead' and better quality than this DVD but for a low price, go to the VHS listing for 'Revenge of the Dead' and click on the used section (ignore the new one listed on the page, it is the same slaughtered version as this DVD). What you want to find is the Lightning Video release which is either listed as that or as 'different cover art'. The Lightning Video release has the same subject, a zombie coming out of the street, but the artwork is quite different and the background is blue. The Lightning Video release is complete and better quality, and you can probably get one for $8.00 or less. 'Revenge of the Dead'/'Zeder' is the story of a writer, Stefano, who is given a typewriter for an anniversary present which was purchased from a pawn shop. One night while working on his story, the ribbon gives out. Upon closer examination of the ribbon he finds some rather strange content apparently from the previous owner of the typewriter. He decides to investigate these writings about K-zones and bringing the dead back to life. He finds that the typewriter belonged to an ex-priest. As he delves further into this mystery, danger and conspiracy lurk around every corner. This is a movie that crosses several genres; gothic, giallo, conspiracy, and yes zombie movie. This is not a gory movie or even close to one. This is a well structured tale of mystery and horror brilliantly brought to the screen by director Pupi Avati. The American distributors of this film made a mistake when they retitled it 'Revenge of the Dead' and targeted the gore crowd. Several of them went to see a gory plotless movie and instead found a film with a story and this seemed alien to them (as evidenced by several reviews on this page). These same reviewers apparently never watched the movie as there are four on screen appearances and two off screen appearances of zombies in this film (the other reviewers claimed none). If you are looking for a zombie movie involving gut-munching gore, you will not find it here. If you like a horror movie that has a story to tell (and a unique one here) and develops its plot which is frought with conspiracy and an unnerving journey into the unknown, you may well like this movie; just not this DVD.-Bob",1102204800,22,3202,4.541522491349481
7982625,1,B00008G7J0,"This film contains zero zombies. The artwork is a very feeble attempt to get you to buy this. If you're a zombie fan, you WILL be disappointed. There is no gore. No zombies. Nothin good here. If you want some boring horror movie w/ no blood n guts, this may be your ticket. BUYER BEWEARE!!!!",1094169600,5,291,4.3090909090909095
7982626,5,B00008G7J0,"The correct name of this wondeful film by Pupi Avati is ""Zeder,"" and is also available on DVD under that title. I have that copy and it is horrible. By the previous review I take it this copy is just as terrible.
Apparently there is a crystal clear copy available in Europe in the PAL format, Region 2, letterboxed, uncut, and all.
Why does everyone want killing and zombies and action (and it does have these things)? ""Rosemary's Baby,"" for example, is the most perfectly frightening and terrifying film. Not that ""Zeder"" is as superior, but the subtle things happening are what is important.
Now, what needs to happen is someone with brains needs to release this film in its proper format on DVD in the States. Yes, ""Pet Semetary"" is very similar and was perhaps inspired by ""Zeder,"" but otherwise, this is a truly original film.",1067644800,7,831,4.659863945578231
