8643662,5,B00INIDHR4,"An exemplary production of a difficult opera. Forget the over produced claptrap of the Met's Netrebko version (I find her unbearable, frankly). The singing is excellent in every role here. The production serves the story (these days, that's an accomplishment in the opera world!) and tells it clearly and powerfully. Florez and Machaidze are astonishing talents and they make it look effortless. The sound is very good. I only wish they had the Met orchestra. The playing from the pit is very good but there are a couple pitchy moments.",1525132800,,536,4.966666666666667
8643663,5,B00INIDHR4,"This is one of the most beautiful operas in the repertoire I believe. The music is almost divine and the performers were just sensational.
Too bad the production design was somewhat austere and very monochromatic which is not my thing at all , I would have preferred a more traditional approach to the production. The Blu-ray Disc was first class with accurate and pristine colors and textures a great asset to my collection.",1471996800,,425,4.835616438356165

8643666,5,B00INIDHR4,"Puritani was Bellini's last opera; he died some eight months after the premier at the age of 33. It is a difficult opera to stage for several reasons: first, the music is fiendish to sing. The tessatura (range from low note to high) is extreme, especially for the tenor and soprano. Second, it calls for a large number of principal singers, 6 in total, with four being the main roles (The legendary ""Puritani quartet"" of Grisi, Lablache, Tambourini and Rubini who sang in the premier were so named).

This performance is similarly blest: with this quartet being Juan Diego Florez, Nino Machaidze, Ildebrando D'Archangelo and Gabriele Viviani. All sing splendidly, and while the  eternal battle of ""this"" soprano vs. ""that"" soprano continues, Machaidze is not only a vocally excellent Elvira, but a dramatically believable one, as well. JDF makes singing Arturo seem easy, but it is a role that nearly caused both Pavarotti and Gedda to strangle (metaphorically) on the high notes. Both D'Arcangelo and Viviani bring a high level of vocal and dramatic excellence to their portrayals of Georgio and Riccardo.

Staging at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna is traditional, while the camera work is a bit over the top, shifting excessively between the front of the stage and the rear.

Conductor Michele Mariotti, who is a favorite at the annual Rossini Opera Festival, is a sure hand with this score and both chorus and orchestra seem quite at home with it, although the former seem a bit wooden on stage, with little interaction.

Disc quality is superb, with magnificent picture  and sound in the HD MA mode that will amaze.

Highy recommended.",1409011200,8,1639,4.95985401459854
