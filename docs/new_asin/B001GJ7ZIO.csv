8305603,1,B001GJ7ZIO,There is no reason for you to offer this garbage for sale.  It is nothing more than some sophmoric attempt to be funny.,1381881600,,119,4.173913043478261
8305604,5,B001GJ7ZIO,"Wow! Ritter has once agian raised the bar for this genre!  This once ""every-guy average Joe"" has once agian descended into the mirth & mayhem of the human mind.  Ritter takes what we all secertly fear & throws it into the cuisenart of his twisted mind, and with what emerges, truly shows us what could have been, and might still be.  If you only watch it once, then, my friend, you have not seen it twice!  With Dirty Cop 2, Ritter truly steps away from the pack & solidifies himself as the Roger Loy of this generation!!!!",1017014400,,523,4.360824742268041
8305605,4,B001GJ7ZIO,"I had a great time with this movie. It has one of the most realistic COPS type format I have ever seen. Joel does an awesome job as Gus and he does it realistically...tends to make you wonder. Mr. Ritter does a great job directing this gem of a movie and the ending took me completely off guard. It's harsh and brutal at points, which is to be expected and makes the movie more realistic in my opinion. Kudos to Mr. Ritter and everyone involved. I can't wait for the sequel!",969408000,,474,4.21978021978022
8305606,1,B001GJ7ZIO,"For all the hype lavished on this little dirty piece that passes itself  off as ""satire"", I thought there must at least be an element of  provocation here.  Nope.  And forget about any semblance of cinematic  awareness, story, acting, editing.  I've seen works by 12-year-olds that  surpass this one in technical expertise and writing.  You could do better  shooting on your old Video-8 camera.

It astounds me how proudly  director/writer Tim Ritter puts his name (and his editor's) up on the  screen at the end credits.  They're even so bizarrely proud of this piece  of garbage that they put:  ""The preceding video is a work of fiction.  Gotcha!"" at the end.  Baloney.  Not only was it clear from the start  that Dirty Cop:  No Donut was fake through and through, it's also apparent  from the get-go that it was awfully shot, awfully directed, awfully  conceived.  Scenes drag on and on with no real impact, the lead character  is a seething mass of annoyance and gloating arrogance, the cameraman is  hyperactive with no real sense in following the action, and even the camp  value is torn to shreds because of how long everything takes to unravel,  and how one-dimensional the concept is (""I'm the law"" gags for 80  minutes).  In terms of guerilla filmmaking, The Blair Witch Project  succeeded on the strength of skilled actors and novel concept.  Dirty Cop:  No Donut doesn't even have the novelty factor to it:  Everything here has  been done infinitely better nearly a decade ago by the Belgium film Man  Bites Dog, in which a detached camera crew follows a sadistic killer around  and implicates itself as part of the violence.  That was satire.  Dirty  Cop:  No Donut is some kid toting a camera around fancying himself a  filmmaker, with people in front of the lens fancying themselves actors.  Both sides fail on all counts.

Needless to say, I felt like I had been masochistic in subjecting my brain to this snot.  Skip it.  This one  commits all the ultimate crimes -- it's badly made, morally void and, most  grievously, boring.  For once, I wish Amazon had a ""No star""  rating.",968716800,6,2094,4.747191011235955
