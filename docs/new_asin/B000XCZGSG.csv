3000546,5,B000XCZGSG,"Finally I have received this DVD and I think is a MUST for every kind of drummer,this DVD hosted by Carnine Appice is a classic example of what every drummer would like to see............ to learn everything !!!
Classic and cool rock drum solos by wonderful artists: Ginger Backer,Danny
Seraphine,Carl Palmer,Ian Paice,Neil Peart,Cozy Powel and more......
For me the greatest solos are by two legendary Heroes of the drumming:
DON BREWER (Grand Funk Railroad) and STEVE SMITH (Jurney),however this is a great DVD !!!
Thank you Hudson Music and Producers Siegel,Wallis and Klauber.

3000547,5,B000XCZGSG,"Carmine Appice was the perfect choice as a host for this collection of rock drum solo clips. He adds the right amount of background, stories, and respect for nearly all of the drummers featured here. He was there when most of these guys got started or made it big. As a rock drummer and a fan of classic rock, this was worth the wait. Some may have seen these clips on YouTube - get this DVD so you can watch them any time, and with much greater clarity. I hadn't seen the clip with Ian Paice before, and I thought I'd seen them all. The Carl Palmer solo is just incredible, and it's from the early days of ELP, when he played a Gretsch round badge kit. The interview with Ginger Baker is hilarious; the solo by Jethro Tull drummer Clive Bunker may be the best thing on the disc, and that's including Neil Peart's mesmerizing solo from 2004. Bring on Volume II!",1202774400,24,861,4.288343558282208
3000548,5,B000XCZGSG,"Vinnie Appice has gathered an impressive and unbelievable collection of archive drum solo performances. The disk includes what is possibly the only filmed solo by Keith Moon, a clip of Iron Butterfly's Ron Bushy from an old German TV show, a British TV interview with Ginger Baker when he was with Cream, a black & white clip of The Ventures playing ""Wipeout"" at a concert in Japan, a clip of himself playing with Lesley West on the old 1970's ""Don Kirshner's Rock Concert"" TV show and more. He even includes the Santana/Michael Shrieve segment from the Woodstock movie. Something that I assumed would have been contractually impossible. He also includes lesser-known drummers like Jethro Tull's Clive Bunker and the late Cozy Powell. Appice knew most of these artists, including the great Sandy Nelson, and introduces each clip while sharing a personal story about his acquaintances. This DVD is so well done that it is not only a must-have for any percussion enthusiast, college music departments should add it to their film collections.",1202774400,14,1039,5.046511627906977
3000549,5,B000XCZGSG,I got this for my husband who is a drummer and he really likes it and plays it repeadly.  also got one for his friend for Christmas.,1394755200,,132,3.888888888888889
3000550,3,B000XCZGSG,This is okay but I personally think it gets a little boring after awhile.  My husband listens to it in segments.  Otherwise it's a sensory overload.,1388102400,,148,4.653846153846154
3000551,3,B000XCZGSG,"expected the solos to show more of drummers hand movement.  it was more like a video to entertain, not showing their drumming skills.  alot of the early footage was not necessary;  was not focused on drumming.",1382054400,,209,4.75
3000552,5,B000XCZGSG,Good look for vintage drum solos.  I highly recommend it for new and up coming drummers.  Great history here; pick it up!,1371513600,,121,4.454545454545454
3000553,5,B000XCZGSG,My son has really enjoyed this video.  Wonderful solos by music legends along with some great instruction within the video.  I would recommend this to any music lover.,1357257600,,167,4.928571428571429
3000554,5,B000XCZGSG,"This video is amazing! From the 1950s to 2004! Over an hour and a half of fantastic drumming! Carmine Appice is your narrator, which makes it even more amazing! Starting with Gene Krupa and ending with Neil Peart, this is the perfect dvd for a drummer or drum fan!",1353283200,,264,4.408163265306122
3000555,5,B000XCZGSG,"Drum solos of drummers from the past are hard to come by.  We are lucky to have what we have.  I think Carmine did a great job making this dvd, I really enjoy watching it.

I like his stories that he adds and think they are really interesting.  There are other drum solos of some of these people that I would consider better, but all in all it is a great dvd.

Buddy wasn't in there probably because he isn't a rock n' roll drummer or maybe there was some kind of problem with showing him.  Anyway, almost everyone has seen Buddy a million times and knows who he is and what he can do (anything better, faster, cleaner, tighter, etc.).  Also, then you would probably have to throw in Gene, Loui, Joe, Elvin, Art, Max, and so on.  Where would you stop?

I think there are some other rock drummers that could have been included if any  footage of them could have been gotten for this video.  For example:  Mitch Mitchell - Hendrix, Jim fox - James Gang, Jim Gordon - Derek and the Dominos, and John Bonham - Led Zep (There are vidieos of him soloing).  All these drummers have drum solo videos.

Anyway, it's a good dvd for what it has, and I'm waiting for Carmine to make another one.",1350950400,,1183,4.246636771300448
3000556,3,B000XCZGSG,"I know, no one can list everyone's favorite drummer, but no Buddy Rich?  Gene Krupa but no Buddy Rich?  Then there's Ian Paice, one of the most talented drummers around, and we get him in a groove featuring Richie Balckmore? It was more of a guitar solo than a drum solo.  Sandy Nelson?  You've gotta be kidding me.  Then we get a drum sync of Ron Bushy? And Carmine didn't know it was drum synced? (I think Carmine called it lip sync.)  Keith Moon was a respected drummer (love his I Can See for Miles playing--refusing to fall into a 4/4 groove), but we're shown a bunch of noise and goldfish in a drum?

Absolutely loved Powell's clasical work!  And Neil Pert mixing melodic percussion with drums. Tremendous.  Danny Seraphine's solo was excellent (you could see Terry Kath having to count the measures to know when to come back in).  Carl Palmer show why he's one of the finest ever.  I was surprised to see Don Brewer's solo, and it was inovative (head on the snare?).  Mel Taylor's solos are always clean and technically sound, and of course, the host, Carmine Appice, was excellent.  I wish we could have seen his solo on ""Break Song."" (The whole cut is excellent).

Still, no Buddy Rich?",1302220800,3,1195,4.5233644859813085

It all picks up nicely into some classic rock bands as the DVD rolls along. Fun to watch. When they make a Classic 2 I'll get it.",1296604800,4,433,4.2926829268292686
