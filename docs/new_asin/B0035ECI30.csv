8388930,5,B0035ECI30,"First, Logic Pro is such a massive DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), it's not a small feat to teach it.  I've read MANY books to try to become more comfortable and more efficient with Logic.  Everything helps and, as Anthony Robbins likes to say...""Repetition is the mother of skill.""  So, I don't mind hearing something over and over again if it will help something sink in and/or for me to apply it.  I don't think any one source can teach EVERYTHING about Logic.  That being said, I feel that this video does a great job in covering a LOT of material.

I'm about 3/4 of the way through the video.  There is a lot that I already knew about because I have read so many books on Logic, but there is also a lot that I did not learn about.  One of the things I really like about the demonstrator in the video is that he hits each topic by getting right to the point and then moves on.  For someone not knowing anything about Logic at all, I can see that such a person might be thinking that the video actually moves a little too fast.  But, for someone like me who understands some of the basics, I really like the pace.

As far as the video presentation, I feel the publisher did a good job.  The screen is big enough to be able to see things and there are times when the video zooms in so you can see something that is smaller in size.

This video is a beginner to immediate lesson.  I also purchased the advanced DVD by Hal Leonard, but I haven't watched it yet since I'm not done with this video.  For anyone in the beginner to intermediate range, I feel this is likely a good purchase...it was for me.  I not only learned more, but I was able to reaffirm some great tools that I read or saw before, but hadn't used them because there is so much to learn that they weren't on the forefront of my mind.",1373068800,,1802,4.179710144927537

However, this video is not dynamic, sometimes gets to be boring, unfortunately.
I expected more.",1371772800,,149,5.521739130434782
8388932,5,B0035ECI30,"The only thing I dislike, is that there isn't a quick reference index.  There is soooooo much information in these videos that it's kind of hard to take it all in, but you will learn some amazing shortcuts.",1370217600,,206,4.421052631578948
