8543414,5,B009OO288U,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like ROH, DragonGate, and CWFH with this event being their annual singles tournament (spread across two back to back nights) with the winner being able to have any type of match against whoever they want in future.

Night One:
The opening round contest featuring Joey Ryan vs. T.J. Perkins with Joey cutting a funny promo before the match towards Willie Mack, Roderick Stong vs. Drake Younger, Eddie Edwards vs. Kyle O'Riley with Davey Richards on commentary that saw both men know each other so well they were able to keep having various reversals & counters throughout the contest, B-Boy vs. Brian Cage, Ricochet vs. Kevin Steen in a ""speed & aerial vs. power & size"" contest where Ricochet was going for the strategy of frustrating Steen so he would make a mistake but that only made Steen more angry & violent instead of his usual comedic self, Sami Callahan vs. Willie Mack that was aggressive from the start with Willie taking more risk than usual, El Generico vs. Adam Cole with Cole showing a different side of him than we've seen before to the point where he kept trying to unmask Generico, and Davey Richards vs. Michael Elgin in a ""David vs. Goliath"" match that was very stiff to say the least.

Night Two:
Night Two featured the last three rounds (quarter, semi, finals) of the tournament but was held under a ""blind bracket"" meaning that none of the competitors or audience knew who they were going to face each round in advance.

The quarter finals of the tournament featured Sami Callihan vs. T.J. Perkins in a submission based contest, Eddie Edwards vs. Adam Cole in a match that saw Cole be so disrespectful towards Eddie with his comments & showing off that Edwards gave receipts with both men taking some hard hits, Brian Cage vs. Michael Elgin with both men being so strong that they were delivering power moves & even had a battle of delayed suplexes, and Ricochet vs. Roderick Strong.  Semi-final matches featured Adam Cole vs. Sami Callahan that was intense from the start while Ricochet vs. Michael Elgin was a ""speed vs. power"" type of contest before the final round of Cole vs. Elgin which was a highly competitive that saw them not only fight in the ring but also brawled in the crowd.  One non-tournament match included one six man tag match of B-Boy & Drake Younger & Willie Mack vs. Joey Ryan's ""Team Statutory"" that gave us a completely different side of Davey Richards & Kyle O'Riley like you've never seen them before featuring chest hair pulled, dueling chair fights, running around ringside & trying to escape out of the arena, and bare asses to the point where the crowd had to chant ""This Is Awkward!""  The other non-tournament match saw referee Mike Knox making an offer to Kevin Steen to join him with El Generico to face off against Young Bucks & Brian Cage that saw a bunch of moments that you would never expect from Knox or his partner.

Night One was mostly a strictly wrestling based show instead of having it's usual variety while Night Two was solid quality while the bonus tag matches were completely entertaining with the highlights definately being Davey Richards & Kyle O'Riley in their match along with referee Rick Knox in his.  This is a show I recommend to see.",1354233600,,3471,4.744610281923714
