4683623,4,B005FPT2E0,"Got this blu-ray in the post last week and i have to say I really enjoyed it.  Im a huge Beatles fan and look forward to anything new Beatle-wise.  Even though its 3.5 hours long it goes by quite quickly.  A few observations, I thought it was probably a little bit top heavy with the Beatle years.  I realise the Beatles were a huge defining moment of Georges career but a lot of it has been covered before, particularly in the anthology DVD's, so if your a Beatle fan you will have seen a lot of it before.  About 1 hr 45 minutes of it are the Beatle years. They miss a lot of the latter years which i would have liked more of.  For example, no mention of the Somewhere in England Album which had the single All those years ago, written after John Lennons death and released in tribute. No real footage of his reaction to Johns death. Also no mention of Cloud 9 and Got my mind set on you, his biggest single bar My sweet lord which kicked off his comeback in the late 80's.  Also no mention he was sued for plagurism on My sweet lord etc.  There is a lot missing.

Having said that, there is a good bit i didn't know too and its great to see McCartney, Ringo, Clapton, the Phytons, F1 drivers etc etc all talking and sharing stories about the man himself. One tit bit I didn't know, Paul siad when he wrote And I love her, he played it for George and George said it needs a guitar riff and on the spot came up with 4 notes that make the intro to the song and run through the it.  As Paul said, that is the song and he wrote it, very generous credit given from Paul.

As for Blu-ray vs DVD, the DVD is probably just as good, most of the footage was recorded before the days of high definition so probably don't need the blu-ray, a few bucks dearer. However the quality is excellent.  All in all, if your a Beatles fans you will enjoy it and if you're a nuetral, looking to find out some stuff on George and the Beatles, again it should be an enjoyable watch.  What does shine true is what a good little song writer George actually was, he just happened to be in a band with Lennon and McCartney, what are the  the odds on that.",1319068800,6,2128,4.096385542168675
4683624,5,B005FPT2E0,"""Here comes the sun....the smile's returning to their faces."" -- George Harrison, 1969

""I want to tell you, my head is filled with things to say."" -- George Harrison, 1966

This is the documentary Beatle fans and George Harrison fans have prayed for and long awaited!  As others have noted, I, too could have happily watched both installments at one time.  Seeing it broken into 2 separate parts had an advantage in that it gave me something to look forward to wataching.  This is a brilliant work covering the life and artwork of George Harrison, artist extraordinaire in his multi-faceted glory.

I've said all along that George was all about love.  From the time George made his presence known and felt; from the time he was placed in the loving arms of Louise French Harrison and she saw her own intensity looking back at her; from the time Harold Sr. first set eyes on George and his only sister and two older brothers welcomed this ""new little Harrison,"" as Louise French Harrison would later describe George and other new arrivals (nieces, nephews and grandchildren) with much love.  Harold Sr. and Louise French were from all accounts a very loving couple who were nuturing to their 4 children.  George, surrounded by love from the beginning would live full circle by making a final request that people ""love one another.""

This documentary portrays the REAL George Harrison and does not degenerate into idolatry.  George is shown in many moods, some less than cheery and shown warts, wrinkles, atrocious perm days and all.

George's fellow Wilburys and former Beatle bandmate Paul McCartney and wife Olivia provide the best interviews. I just wish more Harrison family members had been a part of this stellar documentary.  George's sister, also named Louise has banged on the drum for her brother for many years.  In fact, George was the first Beatle to cross the Atlantic, coming to America in 1963 to visit his only sister.

Most, if not all Harrison fans find George's view of religions very interesting.  It has been documented that Louise French Harrison, herself Catholic had George baptized in March of 1943 when he was 1 month old.  In 1965 George and Ravi Shankar met and during that time, George introduced the world at large to Eastern music and was exploring his philosophies and religious expression.  His Catholic roots never left him; a lovely statue of Mother Mary graced his property at Friar Park.

Louise, George's only sister would say in an early April 2011 interview that it was a shock to her to discover that the ""real world"" wasn't as honest as Harold Sr. and Louise French were and not everybody lived up to their high standard of honesty.  George too lived by that credo and he took things to heart deeply and passionately.

George was also fun. He liked cool cars and was an avid Formula One Fan.  His sister had a serious Dodge Dart when he first came to visit her in 1963 when she was living in Benton, Illinois.  He had a brilliant, dry, droll wit. He loved nature and demonstrated a very nurturing side, which was a Louise French trait.  His passion for gardening was a gift from Harold Sr. and Louise French.  George was an intensely curious and interested person, seeking information and trying to make sense out of the world in which he lived.

George had beautiful wavy hair, courtesy of Harold Sr.; the deep-set Harold Sr. eyes, but he had the burning Louise intensity that never once left his eyes. Pictures of George as an infant and as a very young child show his ubiquitous intensity, which never left him at any time.  It could be a tad unnerving to see such intensity radiating from one so young.  It was a trait that never left him.  George resembled Harold Sr. from the eyes up.  From the nose down, he was Louise French Harrison all over again and his brother Peter was almost a double of Harold Sr.!  Harold Jr. looked more French than Harrison; he and George inherited their maternal grandfather's tall, lean frame.  Lou was a Franco-Harrison creation as was George.  You get to appreciate these things all the more in the book AND in the documentary.  Paul McCartney even says in the book that George had a lot of Louise French's character and personality in him.  Louise definitely left her stamp on George!  Louise even said in the newsletter that she always thought George looked like her dad, John French Sr.)

Louise French Harrison lent her voice to the George Harrison Official Fan Club Newsletter from 1965-1969.  It is plain that Louise loved George and his siblings and in her column, each Harrison child is included and given his or her place under Here Comes the Sun.

Olivia is a beautiful gracious lady and she discusses her life with George and some of the road bumps they hit along the way.  She does so with grace, tact and aplomb. At no time does she resort to tawdry tale-bearing and finger pointing.  Despite all they had been through together, they raised a good son and Olivia loved George, warts, problems, atrocious perms, infidelity and all.  Dhani, their son resembles George and his maternal grandmother who unfortunately died 8 years before he was born.  Clearly George and Olivia loved and cared about each other and again, to Olivia's credit, she is tactful and discreet when certain questions crop up. That reflects well on her and speaks to good.

Readers walk the Long & Winding Road with George from his early days until his untimely death in 2001.  I love the way George could see humor in himself AND his fellow Beatles, as evidenced in his laughing at a Beatle video.  The interviews make a good thing even better and I thank the kind person who made it possible for me to watch this until I am able to buy this dvd.

George Harrison has given the gift of his beautiful voice to many.  I knew a child with Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form of autism.  She was a MAJOR Beatles fan and George was her favorite.  This child, like so many children with autism spectrum issues was a late talker.  Once she acquired speech and an awareness of music, she found her voice in the Beatles.  She would let George ""talk"" for her in that she would quote Harrison lyrics and lyrics from Beatle songs to get a point/message across.  This later segued into richer, developed speech.  As I said about the book, George Harrison's music and his natural, yet childlike grace of sorts reached countless many. He has a large following of fans with autism, as do the Beatles as a group. Beatle fans with autism is a demographic that is not at all rare or unusual.

George's humor comes through time and again.  His sardonic wit after that crackpot broke into his home at the tail end of 1999 was evidenced when he said in re the crackpot: ""well, he sure wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys.""  He had made peace with his life; he was surrounded by love every step of the way.  George during his post-1999 brush with death had a very peaceful and serene look about him; his eyes, always intense like those of Louise French Harrison included an inner peace, like his 1968 song ""The Inner Light.""  He disclosed his peace and the fact that he was ready to let go to Olivia, who bore this with dignity and grace.

A beautiful tribute to George and how meaningful his life has been in the eyes of those who knew him and others who love his art/music.  George has brought more people closer to God. In fact, my church, which is a Catholic church uses George songs, some of which like ""Dear One"" are beautiful prayers set to  music for our prayer meetings, Bible studes and discussion groups.  George is, as we say ""a parishioner by proxy"" because his beautiful music and his open heart and mind have set a good example to countless people.

Bless George, George's family and all who have traveled down the Long & Winding Road with George.

4683625,5,B005FPT2E0,"I just finished watching this on cable over the span of the last two days, parts 1 and 2, but as far as I'm concerned they could have run the entire documentary in one day, and I would have sat through the entire 5-hour uminterrupted run.  A nicely done biography courtesy of Martin Scorsese on the life, music, and personality of ""the quiet Beatle.""  Although some of the editing was a bit choppy on some of the musical footage, I found the biography to be a fascinating look into a performer I didn't really know about as much as I thought I did.

One thing you come away with is that George, in his aspiration to spread love, was greatly loved in return by friends and family for a lot of obvious reasons.  What was really nice to see is that he was accepted with his moody side as well, something lots of people look at in others first, disregarding the rest.  Of all the people interviewed for commentary, the most inciteful ones seemed to be Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, and wife Olivia.

George's religious philosophy and world views may not necessarily be eye to eye with your own, but anyone who is trying to make a difference in the lives of the lesser off and is a true advocate for positive change is a good icon for the world at large.  Apparently the quiet Beatle had a gift for reaching out and opening people's minds at a one-on-one level, though not good at delivering speeches in front of thousands.  He was obviously very personable, candid, and passionate about the things that he believed in.  That passion--or any--can make an orator out of a mute.  Funny how one of the most telling things about him was his eyes!  You can see the depths of his emotions constantly, and maybe the weight of the world was something he placed too firmly on his own shoulders.  You would be moody too!

In contrast, we see he had a very playful side, loved mischief, and got simple joy out of colors, flowers, and close friendships.  Unfortunately, the mischief veered into unfortunate territory for the main women in his life, and Olivia makes it plain in what she says about him--or, rather, what she DOESN'T say.  ""The key to a long marriage...Don't get divorced,"" speaks volumes on her thoughts about his quirks and aberrant behavior.  She was trying to be graceful without giving details, but not too many people appreciate infidelity.  Was he a good husband?  Well, it's very obvious she loved him, which covers up a multitude of foibles.  Was he a good father?  It certainly looked like it to me, because Dhani seems to be a good kid, and boy, he sure looks a lot like his dad!  Was he a good friend?  Undoubtedly.  Was he a great spiritualist?  He tried his hardest with lots of success.  Was he a great musician?  Ringing affirmative!

Moments that stand out in the film:
George standing protectively by John's side after Stu Sutcliffe passed away while Astrid shot their photos.

George laughing and singing along to ""This Boy"" while viewing an old Beatle performance.

Eric Clapton's recounting the entire Patty Boyd situation.

The wonderful footage of that huge, sprawling mansion.

All the interviews with Tom Petty, from the funny ukelele story to his recounting of George's post Orbison death comment:  ""Aren't you glad it's not you?""  Well, at least he was bold enough to say what most people are thinking anyway.

The music footage, of course, and getting to see nearly everyone who was anybody in it!

The most touching part for me was after that lunatic broke into the estate, nearly killing George and Olivia, forcing them to have to fight back.  The results of the attack seemed to bring out the best thing for George in his preparation for death:  closure.  His telling Olivia that he finally figured out he really had to let go of all his bitterness and be more forgiving made me want to take stock in the way I've been conducting my own life, and maybe it's time to be more spiritual myself.  No matter what your faith is, forgiveness can do wonderful things--well, I've generally seen it in other people.

To sum it up, this was an excellent account of George's life because it didn't put him on a sugary pedestal.  It was brutally and delightfully honest, portraying the man as a multi-talented, intelligent, loving, spiritual human being with flaws like anyone else.  His major goal toward the end of his life was to be more and more God conscious.  In closing, all I can say is bless you, George.",1318204800,199,4424,4.603580562659847
4683626,5,B005FPT2E0,"A documentary on a music celebrity can be measured by content and insight - what footage did they access and who was willing to contribute and what new light did it shed on the subject? On the first point Martin Scorsese knocks the ball out of the park. Though I didn't feel I knew George any better than before by the end, I was treated to nearly four hours of dazzling and emotionally moving entertainment.

I watched both parts of the film at UK preview and at no point did my attention or enthusiasm flag. In fact I would have happily sat through any outtakes! This beautifully crafted film is packed with concert footage, home movies, press conferences, interviews, photos and documents that I've never seen before, even though I've been researching the Beatles quite heavily for several years for Beatles Songwriting Academy. There are interviews with (or at least footage of) everyone you would hope to see. Beatles, wives, brothers, son, Pythons and peers. Everyone from Eric Clapton to Eric Idle.

The documentary is constructed entirely from interviews and clips without explanation or analysis. The closest we get to a voiceover is Dhani Harrison reading excerpts from his father's diary and letters to his mum. Though the film is visually stunning it's strange watching the practically square picture forced upon us by the source material. Equally quirky is the sound editing. Scorsese doesn't know the meaning of 'fade'. All the music cuts brutally, sometimes after a few seconds. Sometimes this is cool. Mostly it's odd. The film is largely chronological and there are some great juxtapositions of sound and visuals like All Things Must Pass accompanies footage of the WW2 bombers that plagued the Liverpool of Harrison's birth. The first part covers George's life up to the White Album.

It's hard to pick out favourite parts. But Harrison's obvious delight watching archive footage of the Beatles miming This Boy, laughing and singing along, is one. The Beatles performing If I Needed Someone, Harrison playing What Is Love? with Billy Preston, and seeing the Travelling Wilburys in the studio would be others.

There are moments of laugh out loud humour, especially TV footage of crusty professors discuss the significance of Pop music while Beatles and Mick Jagger seeth like captive wild animal in the background and Tom Petty recounting Harrison arriving at his house with a trunk full of ukeleles. But Harrison's story of how Lennon and McCartney inspired him to start composing is the best - ""If John and Paul can write [songs] everybody must be able to"". The Maharishi (a spiritual Joe Pasquali) and Phil Spector (a croaking, unblinking vision of craziness with a permanent twitching thumb) also provide some unintentional humour.

Scorsese deserves praise for not going down the revisionist myth making route trodden by the Anthology series, especially as Olivia Harrison was one of his producers. Olivia is honest, though vague, about George's infidelity as is Klaus Voorman is about his drug problems. But the lack of a narrator almost makes George a mirror in which we see his world. We know he was loved, deeply, by friends - racing drivers, comedians and film makers, musicians, but we don't whether he was truly loveable. Terry Gilliam describes George as a mix of ""grace, humour and a weird kind of angry bitterness"" but what made him that way? Did he ever find a release from that bitterness? Was he a good father? Nearing death Harrison asked Olivia if he had been a good husband. She never tells us what her answer was.""What's the secret of a long marriage?"" She asks herself. ""Don't get divorced"".

It may sound strange but the highest point for me was simply hearing the music. Listening to Here Comes The Sun and While My Guitar Gently Weeps I was almost moved to tears at the transcendent beauty of those recordings.

Perhaps the fact that the film cause me to fall in love with the music all over again is it's greatest recommendation.",1317772800,271,3974,4.931240657698057

To call him a Beatle,  a guitarist, a musician is selling him way short. He found true peace and harmony in life.

4683679,3,B005FPT2E0,"I love George Harrison. I love the Beatles. I kinda like Martin Scorsese (loved The Last Waltz). However this movie didn't quite cut it.

All Things Must Pass is one of the finest achievements in Rock and Roll history and the period surrounding that is featured briefly in the film. I would've loved to see more of the making of that album as it was the peak of George's career. Instead we get Eric Clapton's love story which seems like he's hogging the spot light. The interview snippets of Paul and Ringo are complete garbage as well. Ringo doesn't say anything coherent and Paul also seems to be there for cash and not for George. I wish the movie focused more on George, his spirituality, his life and his music more than just him as a ""Solo Beatle"" when he really was more than that.

The entire first disc is just the Beatles. I would've rented a Beatles movie if I wanted that. I would've loved half a disc of Beatles, a bout an hour - two hours of ATMP, Living in The Material World and Dark Horse materials but it really seems like that stuff (aka George's career) was just skimmed over. Really wish this was done better but I appreciate it for getting me into George Harrison! One of my favorite artists.",1479081600,,1214,4.415178571428571

4683681,3,B005FPT2E0,"Let's be honest...John and Paul ran the show. George was an important cog in the wheel, but he stayed in the background until the group's final years (at which point he wrote better songs than his band mates). The film bogs down when it focuses on his interest in Indian music.",1478563200,,277,4.450980392156863

4683683,5,B005FPT2E0,"Outstanding excursion through the life of the quiet Beatle, the Dark Horse that provided lead guitar for the greatest rock group ever, the Jr bandmember that provided some of the bands most remembered songs.

It has amazing footage from the earliest years of the Beatles and the British Invasion, and insightful and candid interviews with people close to him. I came away from it with a new-found appreciation of his talent and realized that of that era, his songs are the ones that have stood the test of time best for me. He was highly talented and creative, and it's a pity that he died at 58 as I'm sure he had much more to offer.",1471564800,,503,4.195876288659794

4683703,5,B005FPT2E0,"See I thought it was Madonna who lived in the 'Material World', but apparently George Harrison did too, and a few other people, like Bill Gates and Kim Kardashian and this guy I used to know when I worked as a puddle filler  it's a real job, why do you think you still see puddles full of water on sunny days? - but he left puddle filling and invented an app for phones that tells you when your nose hairs need clipped. He made millions and now lives inside a small mountain in Arizona.  Anyway, back to George Harrison. He was one of the Beatles, not to be confused with the Crickets who were also an insect-themed-pop-band but were a lot chirpier in the morning. Actually there's been quite a few insect-themed-pop-artists: You've got your Beatles and Crickets of course, then there's Adam and the Ants, Bee Bee King, Flea from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (yes, I know spiders are arachnids but I'm not going to mention that),

George Harrison moved on from insects to become a pretty successful rock star in his own right, and this Martin Scorsese DVD documents this. It doesn't really mention any insects though, which is disappointing, but if you can live with that then you'll probably die for this.",1465603200,,1249,4.566964285714286

4683721,5,B005FPT2E0,"It's true that half the film deals with the Beatles years, which has been covered so often, but there's plenty of footage I've never seen before (and I've seen a LOT of Beatles footage). It also shows Harrison's solo career (including the Traveling Wilburys), spirituality, passion for auto racing and film making (including Monty Python), and his family.

Even though it's 3-4 hours, it could easily have been longer. It's not a proper biography in that it doesn't fill in the gaps between periods of time and it assumes you already know much of his history... if you do, the film works well and shows much new footage. I think the film works, in that it captures the essence of Harrison as a person.

Many could argue that the reason we know George is because of the music, and so the film should have far more footage of him performing and recording (for example, a clip of Harrison performing on Saturday Night Live in the late 1970's, or during his Japan tour in 1991, or include some of his unique music videos), stress each of his solo hits (for example, Blow Away, All Those Years Ago, the hits from the Cloud Nine album, etc.), and have far less talking about his film making, auto racing, etc.

Overall, at around $20 I think this film offers much bang for your buck. I also think George deserves to have a comprehensive DVD release of all his videos and concerts.",1456617600,,1374,4.554655870445344

I continued to enjoy and follow his career, as an adult and I was really looking forward to watching this documentary. Unfortunately,it was boring, tedious and for the most part, a waste of time.

I thought there would be a lot more about George's younger years, growing up in England, meeting up with the other members of the group, etc...but most of the emphasis was on his time in India, his work with Ravi Shankar and a lot about the Beatle's breakup.

The only part I really enjoyed was the ending, when his wife Olivia was interviewed and spoke about the day that George died. That was worth a couple of stars here but overall, this could have been SO much better.",1429660800,,781,4.409722222222222

4683790,4,B005FPT2E0,"First, the obvious stuff-- this is great, essential viewing for Beatles fans, and Harrison fans in particular. Interviews are revealing, and we get the likes of Macca, Clapton and even Phil Spector casting their versions of events into the mix (some of it contestable, but everyone has an opinion and POV etc)..

But it's basically hagiography.

What's missing? We're told how brilliant My Sweet Lord is, along with Spector's suggestion that it be a single. There's not a trace of irony, given the legal action which eventuated over He's So Fine. Also, the financial issues affecting the Bangladesh concert and LP release aren't mentioned. Either is Shanghai Surprise and its detrimental effect on Handmade. Perhaps this is all because Harrison didn't care too much for the business side. But that in itself had various repercussions, and surely influenced all of the above.

Even positives like the comeback album Cloud Nine are overlooked, while The Traveling Wilburys (a direct result of Cloud Nine) get a big slice of time.

And not dealing with The Beatles Anthology period at all is just unbelievable. Surely given that Paul, Ringo and Yoko were all in, this shouldn't have been a problem.

The stuff that's left out is mystifying, especially when we do get some home video footage which adds little to the legend.",1422835200,2,1320,5.0091324200913245

There are beautiful images, nice films and Olivia's multiple homages.
At the end, I felt tired of so much greatness. Poor George must have been the greatest man alive at his time.
Then, he wrote some really great songs. I appreciate him for that (Here comes the sun, Hare Krishna).
I actually appreciate him more after seeing this biopic. They've done him wrong.

If you are a Beatles fan and watch the film(s) from 1964-1966 their scedule was brutal, hostile, the rainy parades and isolation was the cost of being a Beatle.

The interviews with Olivia were very powerful and Patty Boyd's contribution was enlightening too.

George Harrison was a fixture in my life. He lead me into interests I never thought I had and I probably learned more about life from his example than I did from any of the other Beatles although consciously John was my favorite.

You will not be disappointed!!!",1389657600,,272,5.428571428571429
4683867,1,B005FPT2E0,"First, let me say there is no bigger Martin Scorsese fan than myself nor is there any bigger George Harrison fan than myself. I enjoy their work tremendously.

But this documentary just isn't worth your time.

I am astonished at how Scorsese has taken the extremely fascinating life of one of the world's most brilliant musicians and turned it into a boring documentary. I don't even know where to begin.

The first DVD covers the pre-Beatles breakup period. It drags at times, but I figured we'd get to the meat of Harrison's solo career in DVD 2.

Boy was I wrong. The second DVD we're bored to tears with what feels like an hour of All Things Must Pass/Concert for Bangladesh material. His entire mid-to-late 70's and 80's period (except for the Wilburys) is ignored. Not a word about the Cloud 9 album. No reaction from George to Lennon's shooting. No coverage of the ""All These Years Ago"" tribute song.

Boring, boring, boring. If you want to watch interviews about George Harrison, hit YouTube. Do not waste your time here. This really is unfortunate.",1389571200,5,1057,4.7228260869565215

4683874,5,B005FPT2E0,"Disclaimer: I'm one of the worlds biggest Beatles fans so I'm biased.  But I especially think younger music lovers should do themselves a favor and learn more about one of the most influential guitarists that ever lived.  IMO he was a much better person than a musician.  Being a Scorcese film, the production quality is top notch.  With the volume pushed past 75db you will definitely experience both the genius of George Martin and Phil Spector's wall of sound.  This man's journey is inspirational, interesting, and very human.  You don't have to be a Krishna follower or Beatle fanatic to appreciate this documentary.  For those who believe the music produced today is far superior to that made in the 60s/70s...prepare to have your theory blown away!

4683881,4,B005FPT2E0,"So anyone, like me, who is a George Harrison fan probably knows much of the information in this collection.  However if you're like me you always love hearing the stories again from the people who lived the experiences with George.  There's a lot of information here about his involvement in Formula 1 as well as his U.S. tour back in the 70's.  I enjoyed seeing the film of his U.S. tour which brought back a lot of memories as I was an impressionable 11 year old when I saw him on this tour.

Someone else wrote that there is also a question of what subjects you cover in the case of a life like George's.  Like Attenborough's Gandhi, Scorcese with George's family captures the essence of the man even though the man was incredibly complex and beloved throughout the world.",1383004800,,775,4.507142857142857

I was quickly disappointed when I realized it was simply a bunch of interviews and old film clips.  There was no narration to carry the film so it was essentially a grab bag of items.  The first hour was a waste as it didn't reveal anything new about the Beatle era.  His life after the Beatles was what I really wanted to see and although there were a few bits and pieces that were worth seeing (the interviews with Tom Petty and Patti Harrison were by far the best) it was really not worth the cost of admission.,1378944000,,637,4.283333333333333

4683903,3,B005FPT2E0,"The information provided in this documentary is necessary for anyone who wants to know a little more about one the greatest human beings and musicans in the world, so it's worth the price.

The disappointment is the extremely unbalanced level of volume throughout the DVD. The music attacks the viewer/listener with the gain being so much higher than the dialogues that one has to constantly fiddle with the volume on the remote control. George would never have allowed such an oversight.

It's great to see that Patty has aged gracefully - she's still a beautiful woman. It is, however, a shame to hear her reading excerpts (from what I guess is her book) rather than her giving us that information during her all-too-short interview.

And the very beginning of this documentary is a cheezy copy of the Beatles Anthology and I can't imagine George ever allowing a retread in any of his work. He was much to original for that sort of stuff.

In the end, I am still glad I have the DVD even though its producers did George a disfavor by putting it together the way they did.",1374883200,,1073,4.631578947368421

I cant even imagine how difficult it was to become the song writer he became, with being in the shadow of Lennon and McCartney, but he did it with great skill and with class.  I always appreciated Georges role in the Beatles (from the beginning he appeared as a quite presence but still had great sense of showmanship and style and his guitarmanship grew exponentially throughout the Beatles era and after) but this movie highlights what a good man he was.

But some people may not mind this, and I may just be nitpicking. Just something to note. Still, an enjoyable film. I found it particularly touching when he spoke about John's death, when the interviewer said to him ""but he was no angel..."" and George said ""he wasn't... but he was, as well.""",1363392000,2,667,4.344

4683941,3,B005FPT2E0,"I watched the first half with my 13 year old daughter and found myself stopping the video every 15 minutes to provide context.  Throughout the movie I found that there was vague allusion to events that took place or things George did - such as drug use contributing to his poor vocal performance during his 70s concert tour - but it never got specific.  What was the extent of George's unfaithfulness to Olivia?  Was he a serial adulterer?

Alternatively, there would be contradictory narrative - such as Clapton saying George gave his blessing for Eric to be with Patty.  Yet, a few minutes later, George gets angry at Eric and Patty for acting on their feelings.  Why the confusion?

I did think it was good at highlighting the complex nature of George (and the love/devotion he had from friends).  However, it never satisfactorily resolved/reconciled his deep spiritual quest with his earthly/base practices.

The prior feedback aside, it was a moving piece.  If you don't shed a tear at the end when Ringo last saw George, you may not be human.",1361836800,,1048,4.772222222222222

Beatle fans know most of the story, but haven't seen much of the footage and photos, which are the most impressive part of this film. A must have for collectors,(show me a Beatle fan who's not), but might be tedious for casual fans or anyone introducing young people to The Beatles' legacy.

 Olivia's telling of the break in and attack on George is particularly frightening and disturbing. As much as and in some ways more than Lennon's murder, because the guy didn't seem to know who's house he was in. I will watch it more than once and play it for friends that come to house.",1361750400,2,667,4.285714285714286

. Paul Mccartney noted that whenever he or John wrote a song for an album while the album was was actually being recorded, they would just give George a brief overvirew and a quick look at it hours before they actually recorded the song. Paul was not only amazed how quickly George got the chords down but frequently added his own riffs which made the song better.

 But there was an in depth look at George's beliefs which made him a an irreplaceable human being even with his shortcomings which were not glossed over. Just a brilliant work by a brilliant director.",1359936000,,777,4.535714285714286

That's why I bought this after watching it on netflix. This CD has footage and interviews from the whole span of that time up to the present. Really enjoyed the perspective of Paul and Ringo and Eric Clapton among others. George always seemed like a ""special' one to me - and this documentary explores how deeply his spiritual quest went which also helps to explain why the four could not possibly have stayed together.  It's a great documentary for 20th century music historians as well as people who just loved the Beatles - or don't remember them and want to know what the fuss was about.",1359676800,2,772,4.514285714285714

Even if you are only an average Beatles fan you will really enjoy this!,1359504000,,260,3.8333333333333335
4683959,5,B005FPT2E0,"Okay. I love the Beatles and I especially love George Harrison. From my perspective, as a guitarist Harrison has always been underrated.

The movie for me was as if you were watching the evolution of Harrison from being caught up in being part of the Beatles where they all seemed to be just taken along for the ride. They just seemed to follow things where those things took them.

He then goes into his next phase where he was trying to find himself as an individual and as a musician. What comes across is Harrison's love of music and wanting to play music. What comes across is his desire to simply get together with others to CREATE.

About this same time, it goes into Harrison's search for life. I thought that this was all handled very well. To me, it seemed more as if they were simply reporting it as part of him as opposed to getting preachy about the effect all of this was having on him and his life. About the same way they would have reported that he had decided to get a tattoo.

I don't know if it's true, or simply my interpretation, but some of the parts discussing the break up of the Beatles seemed to focus on Harrison simply getting to the point where he felt that he was no longer developing as a musician. He was being dragged along by primarily Paul McCartney and simply asking Paul, ""What do you want me to do musically here?""

There's not a lot of focus on that part of his life.

If you appreciate movies about musicians and their real lives. I think you'll find this interesting.",1359331200,,1509,4.352313167259786

I believe that he was an exceptional spiritual person whom had very complex personalities that also made him more human to the average person.  He had a gift no doubt and touched many with it.  He trained himself to prepare for the end and I am sure he is happier now then he ever was in this lifetime.",1358121600,,426,4.367088607594937

What an interesting, insightful look into the life of someone who to many might 'just' be known as one of the Beatles.  George Harrison was certainly one-fourth of the greatest rock band of all times, but he was also an accomplished artist on his own, and most importantly, he was an interesting, thoughtful person, searching for the answers to life's many questions.

Scorsese does more than just assemble old clips and current interivews - he somehow makes George's spirit come alive again, making us realize how much the world lost when he died - and also reminding us of the wonderful body of work he left for us to enjoy and be inspired by for years to come.

I'm not a star-struck person but rather someone who choses to admire only those deserving of it. I research everything about The Beatles I can find and sift through the ever-present misconcpetions. I know of their hypocracy (e.g., While not as hypocritical as Paul or John, George writes of living in the material world and tells us we should limit our possessions lest they possess us... writing such things while sitting in one of the rooms of his castle). I'm realistic enough to accept these things, look past them, and listen to George, the man. I have always admired him for his honesty, his humor, and for his wonderful ability to truly not care what anyone else thinks of him. You'll see a lot of that in the video, along with some great historical photos and films which are very factual. You'll definitely learn something about him. I'm not a fan of his later music, and the video contains a lot of that. However, it does show his devotion to his beliefs. Of course, his greatest music is also included as are interviews with his close friends such as Eric Clapton.",1355616000,,1172,4.6124401913875595

I loved the beginning and seeing George's early days, seeing his evolution as a person and artist.  It's a little long at just over 3 hours I think, but I'm not a person who is very good at sitting still for more than an hour at a time.

4684012,5,B005FPT2E0,"""George Harrison"" (2011) documentary it the best ""trip"" back to the 1960's era mentality Harrison never abandoned! See it and you'll experience ""the 60's""...the noblest era of modern times!

See this noble documentary by Marin Scorcese! It will take you back to the fabled ""1960's"" and everybody needs to re-visit those times, including people like me who remember it well, and also people never part of it, or who were there but left it when the calendar changed and ""modern times"" after the ""60's"" started up and continued to the present (2012).

The famous movie titled ""My Dinner With Andre"" (1981) asked the important question ""What if the '60's were the best years ever to have happened, and it's been all down hill after that?"" Worth thinking about! The ""'60's"" were a highlight in human history of great importance, a benchmark of cultural and human excellence.

They somehow got disappeared, and more to the sad point, never properly or adequately explained or communicated after the times changed, and glory of the '60's died.

George Harrison was an icon of the 1960's, and his life after the '60's was devoted to ideals part of the high water mark times of the '60's.....and we see his important life in this wonderful documentary movie.....created in 2011 by Martin Scorcese.

Scorcese attended NYU Film School in the mid-1960's and was a senior camera crew tech guy for the ""Woodstock"" (1969) documentary when Scorcese was still in his 20's. He was there for all of it, and never forgot it.

""George Harrison: Living In The Material World"" (2011) is a memorial to the whole decade as well as to Mr. Harrison who was and is a remarkably representative person part of the 1960's.

You had to be there to understand it, and remember it.

No adequate documentary or other cinema art work effort ever came near to communicating what the 1960's were all about, why they were so important, and truly different than times before or since.....not until this documentary.

See it, and you'll see the 1960's ideals and way of life, mentality.....so important and beautiful and worth preserving and studying.

The 1960's were more than ""flower power"" and ""social protest"" times and events......those years, for some people, were a way of life never to be forgotten or abandoned.

Yet, they are hard to describe......memories supported by visual and sound images need to be presented about the 1960's.

This documentary is the very best effort doing that...succeeds as no other documentary about those times has ever done, to my thinking.

You'll ""feel"" the 1960's........if you screen this documentary movie....and that's a worthwhile experience...one worth repeating often until you ""get the point"" and then start working to bring it back...somehow.

4684021,5,B005FPT2E0,"Knowing Martin Scorsese's track record with music documentaries about The Band in ""The Last Waltz"" and the Rolling Stones ""Shine A Light,"" it's no wonder ""Living in the Material World"" is a well done, thoughtful review of the life of ""The Quiet Beatle."" But it is also so much more than just that. You will absolutely learn more than you thought you knew about George Harrison. Surely The Beatles and their respective members have been chronicled extensively in several mediums from books, television, films, radio and a huge catalogue of YouTube programs and videos. The coverage of the history of the Liverpool band is staggering. And that's why LITMW is such a joy to watch. You learn about George's extraordinary life through the voices of his many close friends like surviving Beatle band mates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, Beatle's producer George Martin, close friend legendary guitarist Eric Clapton, Eric Idle, Jackie Stewart, Tom Petty, Ravi Shankar, Ray Cooper, Terry Gilliam, Yoko Ono, and many others including his brothers Harry and Pete, ex-wife Patty Boyd and his son Dhani and widow Olivia.

They paint a picture of a man far more talented, powerful, spiritual, and accomplished then some might give George credit. And yet the endearing quality about all the reminiscences by his friends and family is how vitally important and good having George was in all their lives and the profound impact he had on all his family and friends. In the end, we get a more complete, more endearing, more human portrait of George than we have ever seen before. And a look inside what drove the man and his massive talent, whether it was music, films, gardening, racing cars, or the spiritual journey he took from being an icon of popular music to being a man at one with God. It chronicles his search for the spiritual understanding of the purpose of his life and the sometimes elusive peace of mind he sought for himself and the world around him.

4684022,4,B005FPT2E0,"The most eerie part of this comprehensive document was how little the death of John Lennon was dealt with in it.  The segment that dealt with the most tragic aspect of the Beatles mythos was treated , well, dismissively, with Olivia quoting George as saying something to the effect of ""that was a bad way for John to have to leave his body""...what the hell does that even mean?  This brings to mind the exclusion of John Lennon from George's autobiography (I, Me, Mine) and the fact that Lennon, in his last days makes note of it.  I'm sure George was a good man, but he seems to come off as being somewhat aloof and removed from events and people going on around him, perhaps his ""spirituality"" caused this...or maybe that's just ""George being George"".",1347753600,,753,4.562962962962963

Lots of respect for a man who went the way of trying things differently than the rest of the world. Great introspect of George when he was with the Beatles and his amazing career afterwards. Definately worth more than just a watch of one time which is the reason that I purchased it. I see more things every time that I watch it.

4684031,5,B005FPT2E0,"I think George Harrison was the least satisfied of all the four Beatles.  This is because he was unable to get as many of his own songs published while he was still in his old band.  Plus he became more occupied with India and spirituality; not that there is anything wrong with that.
Along with that, George was getting very stressed out about all the money and fame that was associated with The Beatles, and that can take its toll on anyone.

I would say that this the best biography of George Harrison so far.  I say this because while it does point out his upbringings, his positive aspects, and his accomplishments, it also points out his faults or frailties.  I admire that the film is not a hero-worshipping whitewash.

Here are some positive aspects about George:
  1. He was a brilliant guitar player and songwriter both as a Beatle and as a solo artist.
  2. He was able to live a relatively healthy and productive life with the influence of Indian spirituality and Ravi Shankar.
  3. He married the right woman, Olivia, who helped defend him from that one intruder who intended to murder him back in December 30th, 1999.
  4. He was a great father to his son, Dhani.
  5. He formed the Traveling Wilburys along with Roy Orbison,(who unfortunately died of a heart attack later on), Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and Bob Dylan.
  6. He created his own film label, ""Hand Made Films"", along which he became the executive producer for films like ""Monty Python's Life of Brian"" and ""Time Bandits"", (which George also composed the music score.)
  7. When he bought his home in England, he eventually planted trees and flowers in order to create his own forest.  So that's a great way of contributing to our environment.
  8. In 1971, he organized ""The Concert for Bangela Desh"", which showed that rock 'n' roll musicians can have a good heart and provied aid for charity.

Now here are some negative aspects about George:
  1.  He was a constant smoker, which would make it obvious as to why he was to die of cancer at the age of fifty-eight.
  2.  Like many other rock 'n' roll musicians, he was a drug user.
  3.  Eric Clapton recalls talking with George about wife-swapping his first wife Patty Boyd, as if she wasn't worth that much to him.
  4.  Terry Gilliam tells the interviewers that when George bought a house in Switzerland, he would refuse to pay his property taxes, even when he was slowly dying of cancer.

Martin Scorsese and the film crew also do a thorough job with interviewing celebrities such Sir Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, the late Billy Preston, Yoko Ono, Sir George Martin, as well as interviewing some of his family members like his wife, Olivia, and his son, Dhani.  All of the people interviewed would tell you their opinion on George, whether it is good or bad.
Another thing that I learned about George Harrison, while seeing this film was that while he was always referred to as the ""quiet Beatle"", he would always give his close friends or aquaintences his opinion about a certain subject, whether it was politically correct or not.  Therefore this ""quiet Beatle"" was not so quiet after all.

""George Harrison:  Living in the Material World""  shows you that while he had his talents, good-heartedness and strong points, he also had his drawbacks and weak points.  This is just a reminder that celcbrities are still human, and every human has both a good side and and evil side.
Hopefully, in the afterlife, (to those who are belivers), I'll be able to establish a friendship with George Harrison.  But in the meantime, I'll have to settle with meeting people like him.",1344384000,3,3597,4.650238473767885

A must see for music lovers and film buffs.  It will send you back through musical history and force you to find your old albums and CD""S.  The timeless music of Harrison particularly post Beatles is astounding and many themes resonate today in terms of the search for understanding, compassion, and peace.",1344384000,,626,4.914285714285715
4684033,3,B005FPT2E0,"In my opinion, the documentary is okay and is very respectful of George's legacy. However, after comparing it to ""Imagine: John Lennon"" done in 1988 then,  I see huge differences

Following, some of them:

* Imagine John Lennon was narrated by Lennon himself  and has lots of unseen footage. Everything was neatly interconnected. One thing lead to the next one.

* LITMW is a compilation of very nice interviews to George and people who new him but the documentary doesn't ""flow"", it jumps to one subject to the next one and leaves lots of gaps. There is very little unseen footage. And the unseen footage is not as relevant as you could have expected

Besides the comparision to ""Imagine John Lennon"", I didn't like that Scorcese neither mentioned his ""comeback"" album ""Cloud Nine"" , nor ""The Beatles 1994/1995 Reunion"". I only saw a three second clip of Paul & George doing vocal harmonies presumably for ""Free as Bird"". Even though is not a documentary about ""The Beatles"", I though Scorcese should have given that historic reunion al least 3 minutes...., not 3 seconds.

Anyway, it is very decent documentary; However it is very far from G-R-E-A-T

After watching Imagine John Lennon I was deeply moved, after watching LITMW I just smiled slightly.

That is all I can say

GOD bless George!

But like George, I'm a humble person who loves all & practices forgiveness no matter what the opinion. Peace, love & understanding.  After all, I don't want to come back as a Seattle Meter Maid... lovely Rita, Rita Maid....  No Sir.  But I digress.  This is a remarkable story about the heart & soul of The Beatles.

I smiled through all four hours of this movie in which the quiet Beatle is not so quiet, nor are those close to him quiet about him. We really get a good look here at a man who made the most of what the world gave him, and who was quite aware of what it all meant in close to real time.  That is rare. Most of us, myself included, figure out why we did what we did a bit later, looking back, sorting through it all.

And, without coming out and saying it, the film illuminates why the East-meets-West spiritual path Harrison walked (and pioneered) was such a perfect fit and a success for him, while others, famous and not-so-famous, only managed to annoy those around them with similar inner journeyings. The reason TM and mantras and Krishna-consciousness worked for Harrison is that they were not empty exercises in ""self-actualization"".

4684064,3,B005FPT2E0,"I thought ""Living In The Material World"" presented a fairly good portrait of George Harrison's life, music and philosophy.

Here's what I would have done differently:

-  Less running time devoted to The Beatles and more devoted to George's solo career.  Most of the Beatles stuff was a rehash from ""Anthology"".

-  More focus on George's guitar playing.  They should have discussed his early country/rockabilly style (influenced by Chet Atkins, Eddie Cochran and others) and his later slide guitar style.  I don't think there was ANY footage of George playing slide!  Some of that should exist in the concert footage; at the very least, they could have shown part of the Dick Cavett clip with George playing slide behind Gary Wright on ""Two Faced Man"".

-  More video clips.  They should have at least shown a short clip from the Japan tour that George did with Eric and his band in 1991.  An example from that final musical collaboration would have fit in nicely after all the time devoted to the George/Patti/Eric story.

-  More discussion of George's solo albums.  I think they only mentioned two or three of them.  There is some great music in those albums!  I would have at least included a discography in the ""DVD Extras"", with the track list of each album.

-  More generous DVD extras. I felt those were pretty skimpy.  I was hoping for a more goodies like extended interviews, discography, filmography, sessionography, photos, and videos.

Well, you can't please everyone, and those are my quibbles.  I did enjoy seeing the film, and it stands as a nice tribute to George.",1338681600,7,1583,4.802973977695167

I also really appreciated the candid interviews with his son, Eric Clapton and Tom Petty.  It was clear that the few people that were close to George loved him very much.  The special features on the disc are fairly sparse, mostly featuring cut interviews.  It kind of makes you wonder why an additional 2 minute conversation with Paul McCartney would get cut out of a 210 minute film.

4684074,4,B005FPT2E0,"None other than Martin Scorsese pulls together tons of video clips, home movies, still photos, print clippings and interesting interviews to explore the life of the ""quiet"" Beatle.  The 2 disc Blu ray set runs nearly 3  hours (not including supplements) divided into 2 parts.  There is another 20 minutes or so of bonus features.

Part I details Harrison's early days with the Beatles.  This section is as much about the Beatles and their emergence as it is about George.  We can see that John and Paul essentially run the group, write almost all the songs leaving George and Ringo only occasional input.  All the while George is collecting numerous songs he'd written but never made it on a record, at least until the last Beatle albums.  By then he had had enough.  For him the break-up was a good thing.

Part 2 deals with Harrison's talents becoming mainstream with a cadre of great songs, many of which were attributed to The Beatles.  We see his first marriage fail when Pattie Boyd leaves for best friend Eric Clapton, although there isn't anything too juicy explained by any of the participants.  We see how Harrison became heavily influenced by Ravi Shankar and meditation.  Even the eventual love of his life, Olivia admits George continued to have affairs after their marriage, but Scorsese keeps a respectful distance.

The best part of the film is the great interviews with those that loved Harrison.  In addition to the obvious choices, we hear from race car driver Jackie Stewart, record impresario Phil Spector, actress Jane Birkin, actor/comedian Eric Idle and director Terry Gilliam along with some of the great musicians Harrison played with.  The documentary is long, too long, but is very revealing as to the musical genius that was George Harrison.",1338163200,4,1770,4.909090909090909
4684075,4,B005FPT2E0,"Martin Scorcese's Living In The Material World, while more cohesive than his Bob Dylan doc, still has its peaks and valleys, and the fact that it holds together better might well be due to pervasive knowledge of the Beatles story rather than his presentation. That said, there are a lot of treats for the eyes via photos and video footage that has never been seen before.
Its downfall of course is reliance on photos and footage that have been seen if not over-exposed.

In some respects the use of footage from the Beatles Anthology seems redundant. Borrowing footage from someone else's documentary to make your own does not seem to be the way to go. In some instances, Scorcese redeems himself on that point by using alternate takes or material that didn't make it into the Anthology's final cut. But in a pinch he does fall upon segments lifted directly from Anthology. Meanwhile those bits culled from the Anthology's cutting room floor pose the tittilating question, how much more is there we haven't seen, an answer those of us who own a bootleg of an early cut of that doc already partially know. Doubtlessly, Scorcese would have offered more were it not for the fact that the scope of his film was George alone.

Probably the most disappointing offering here is the footage from Let It Be. Not only is public starved for and denied the film's re-release, but in the modern world view of fans who enjoy outtakes as much as the finished product, the Let It Be archives surely offer a treasure trove. One would have hoped a man of the reputation of Martin Scorcese could have wrestled some of those unseen treats from tightly guarding fists of Apple. Disappointing, not only is that not the case but we get the one scene that emphasizes the aspect of that project remaining Beatles believe should not be made public, the ugly in-fighting between members of the band. It has been argued by Paul and Ringo, apparently, that Let It Be's release would denigrate the reputation and legacy of the band for future fans. Unfortunately, by denying fans access both to the original film and miles of outtakes that certainly exist, they only further emphasize that one little tif between Paul and George, as we see it repeatedly with no other material to give it context or balance it out.

Also disappointing among what's missing from the Material World is more footage from obvious sources like the Rutles, a project that George championed and even did a cameo in. It gets mentioned only in passing.

Overall, I'm nitpicking here. There is much here that is good. A lot of great interviews and a few moving moments and another great excuse to pour over details about the Fab Four. That it could have been better does not mean it ain't worth the price of the ticket. If you're a fan you will enjoy it!",1338163200,2,2797,4.667342799188641
4684076,5,B005FPT2E0,"Just finished watching the second half of ""George Harrison - Living In The Material World"" and all I can say is POWERFUL! The second half really was more about George's great spirituality as well as his many projects and solo endeavors from the time the Beatles broke up until he died, as well as his many friends and the effect George had on their lives. I think Martin Scorcesse did a phenominal job documenting George's life. Where the first disc documented his young life and his time with The Beatles, the second disc really was about the man that George had become. He was so humorous and really looked at the world in a very special way. He never took the material world too seriously because he had a great sense of what lies beyond this life. An excellent film!

4684078,5,B005FPT2E0,"I have seen the Beatles in many online videos just prior to and after arriving in the U.S. in 1964. Two things I noted about George: First, he would kind of dance or shuffle his feet to the music as the band played and he was really smiling like he enjoyed the performance every bit as much as the members of the audience. He liked to perform on stage and had fun doing it. Second: After the first appearance on the Ed Sullivan show, the Beatles performed their first concert in the U.S. in Washington D.C. The first number performed in that concert was a solo by George Harrison and his voice was every bit as good as Paul and John. He did a fantastic job. It made me wonder if he did a lot more lead singing prior to the Beatles coming to the U.S. and then the group decided to record and perform only the songs that they wrote after they released their second album. The only song I remember them performing that they did't write after that time was John's occasional ""Twist and Shout"" and just maybe ""Please Mister Postman."" George was an outstanding performer that just seemed overshadowed by John and Paul who were also outstanding performers, but since John and Paul wrote almost all of the songs, they did most of the singing. George was indeed special.",1337904000,,1261,4.439655172413793

4684081,4,B005FPT2E0,"Well, the film is great, where I issues with the CD Vol 1 release (probably many more to come & reviewed it recently ) this was fantastic look at George's life. My only complaint is that it covered The Beatles years far too long and went through the solo years too fast. The film shows throughout how George felt spiritual belief was becoming far more important then chart success (if it covered his Cloud 9 period you would have seen he really enjoyed chart success). Then again it we don't see as much of what he liked in the material sense as much as the title of the films name (and title of his second album by the way). The Beatles portion was a ""5"" but gave it a ""4"" due to the fact it skipped over his solo career too fast. It covers ""All Things Must Pass"" well, skims over the rest of his solo work. Maybe it was a time restraint, nevertheless I would recommend it to anyone wondering how good George became at the close of The Beatles break-up. Back to the material world vs the spiritual world. A lot was put on the religious beliefs etc but skimmed over what material things he loved. It did mention racing but maybe it was because he was fortunate to have had money to do things and looked into the things money could not buy. Well, I think I've taken up enough of your time & go out and get the DVD & be your own judge. Drop by my website some @ ""JudeMac Forever & say ""Hi"".",1337472000,2,1388,4.163568773234201
4684082,4,B005FPT2E0,"This DVD tries to frame George Harrison's spiritual journey from his beginnings in Liverpool to his search for himself while still a member of the Beatles to his route to self-discovery as an artist in his own right. Scorcese uses interviews of people who knew Harrison (some recent but most are older) as well as home movies, clips from shows and other material to look at how George Harrison sought to develop his own spiritual identity.

A bit long but well worth it if you're interested in George Harrison. The only downside is that if you don't already know George's bio then you're often at a loss as to when some of the events seem to be taking place or the film just barely touches on some topics without really discussing them.

I loved the bit with men in suits trying to discuss meditation with George and John. Interviews are great, we hear from Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam too, the Rutles story by Eric is priceless. Extras were good, not just photos labeled as extras. When I saw a Jeff Lynne interview I immediately went to watch it. I've always liked him, another genius IMO!

I personally would have preferred less of the 60's material (which is well documented) and more of the later years. First, George was a musician (gardener according to him). I found the lack of acknowledgement about his albums and music a bit concerning. Several of his albums are not even mentioned. I know time is limited on a documentary but this oversight was tough to overcome. Those complaints being said I did find Part 2 to be informative and learned a lot about the wonderful man.",1337126400,4,595,4.518518518518518
4684086,3,B005FPT2E0,"This film stands as a testament to Harrison and his spiritual journey through life. There is no Narrator to bind the films various interviews together. As a result the film can sometimes be a little confusing. If you are a huge Harrison fan, you will have no problem following, but if you are not, it may be difficult to understand, particularly at the beginning of the film which is somewhat fragmented and lose in chronology. About 2/3 of this film is about George in the Beatles. At one point it seems more like a John Lennon Documentary. I was very disappointed with the films treatment of Georges solo material. Over half of his works are not even mentioned (some that contained hits such as the album ""cloud 9"") and the impression the film gives is that he gives music an effort immediately following the Beatles and then does nothing until the Traveling Wilburys. This is of course not the case, and the fact that a film on George fails miserably in documenting the music he made in the last 20 years of his life is a shame.

Where the film gets it right is in his spiritual journey and capturing the essence of the man. The interviews are heart felt and a beautiful testament to the man behind the music.

I would like to have seen more footage. in the Beatles years, I would like to have heard less of John and Paul's music and more of Georges. This is his documentary after all.

To sum up my opinion, this movie is a mixed bag. I think a die hard fan will enjoy it, but it could have been better and more focused.",1336608000,5,1524,4.3780918727915195
4684087,3,B005FPT2E0,"As a huge Beatles fan I couldn't wait to see this film. Some parts of it were very moving, especially when Olivia Harrison was speaking about George. Unfortunately that access also means that the film was not as informative as it could have been. His wife hints at and infidelities and drug use is sort of passed over. The conflicts of say George's criticism of the drug fueled flower child era, with his own later (intense?) drug use is never explored. The whole thing paints a sort of saintly picture of the man which I feel actually undermines his standing, by not exploring his complexity further. Of course there are many interesting parts, especially for a Beatles addict like me. But I do not feel there is anything new here and perhaps a chance was missed. It's worth watching but not not a definitive exploration of the subject. Certainly not up to the standards of the spate of Dylan documentaries that came out.",1336521600,12,922,4.662576687116564
4684088,5,B005FPT2E0,"I took the time to read almost all the reviews some of them with certainly a feeling of shock and surprise. While I understand why people will like to have more ""just George after the Beatles"" footage I also understand that even though Beatles always try to under play being a ""Beatle"" that was most likely the most important thing that happened in their lives. George is not a stranger to that feeling. It is true that all of that has been well documented before but that happened and was paramount in his life and also in the others Beatles lives. I enjoyed a lot the part that shows his other interests such as car racing, movies (Life of Brian an episode that I did not know), and his relationship with other great musicians such as Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne, etc. That was a nice addition.
In my opinion the documental was candid and very well presented the facts.  They did not try to portrait him like a saint. It was kind of hard to hear his own wife talking about his weakness for ladies something that others have reported but not in such a personal way like Olivia Harrison did. I think they did a great job in that part.
I enjoyed the documental and I recommend it to George's or Beatles fans. If you are not a Beatle fan I am afraid that you could get a little bit bored I wasn't. Still it is a nice historical perspective. The music we have today definitively had its rots and influences in the music from that time.
George Harrison always has been my favorite Beatle because while the others wrote, sang and played songs about peace/love George Actually took action in the Bangladesh concert to help people tormented by natural disasters and give them some relief and hope. In that regard he was a pioneer as well it was the first time that an artist got together with a plethora of stars for a good cause. If you notice Paul was not there and I read somewhere that John wanted that Yoko was in the stage after Harrison's refusal Lennon opted out.....None of that was also included in the part that talks about the Bangladesh concert.
The fact that he has such close relationship with Eric Clapton drove me back to the times of the great impressionist painters that know each other such as Degas, Cezanne, Monet, Manet, or Paul Gauguin friendship with Vincent Van Gogh. History usually sends us those geniuses in groups....
Harrison definitively was the more ""spiritual"" of the four the fact that he needed to cope with some frustrations and sometimes shows  a kind of erratic behavior with great swings between vicious words and gentle actions puts him in a level that the rest of us can understand, relate and identify and of course love/admire him even more.",1336348800,4,2696,4.5338809034907595
4684090,3,B005FPT2E0,"I loved George, I still do. He was highly intelligent, highly spiritual and was NOT interested in commercial pop music charts. He hated touring. He hated the media. He had a wicked sense of humor. With that said,. I watched this entire documentary and keep thinking ""where is the candid interviews with stories we have NOT heard?"" ""Where is the rare video footage  we have NOT all seen? For the most part this has concert and video clips we have ALL seen. That is fairly inexcusable. The rest of the JAPAN  video concert exists  --put a song or two in. There is video from the 1974 tour ..(we got one song here). There is MORE rare Wilbury's rehearsal footage (OK not the greatest quality..still very rare and would have been welcomed). So I felt theis was lacking in having any truly rare video.

As to the interviews --McCartney refused to speak candidly. It is very obvious he was NOT interested in revelaing ANYTHING. He hardly spoke . A few clips. Not much and when pressed about ""drugs and women"": he refused to even answer. It is Scorces's JOB to get that rare bit of information or story on George we do not already know. How about an interview with his close friends DYLAN (LOL yeah now I am PUSGHING it--I know). I felt it was a GOOD documentary, certainly not 5 stars.",1336176000,16,1279,4.5
4684092,5,B005FPT2E0,"I guess when Martin Scorsese is putting together a documentary, no one is shy about granting an interview. It was great to see the likes of wife Olivia, son Dhani, Mac, Clapton, Jackie Stewart, Eric Idle, Ray Cooper, that Krishna Consciousness devotee, Ravi, Ringo et al reminiscing. Olivia gives a pretty frank account of their relationship, which must have been pretty stormy for her to have cited an adage I hadn`t heard before: `What is the secret of a long marriage...Not getting divorced`. She wouldn`t say so explicitly, but it would seem that George had a major problem with sexual fidelity even during this, his second and more fulfilling marriage. And how good could it make her feel, at the very end of the film, when George says the only thing he will REALLY regret about leaving this life is not being a father longer to his son. No mention of the wife.

I, doubtless, am not the only one who has a real problem with George`s denigration of the only life we know for the sake of glorifying existence on some astral plane that probably doesn`t even exist. Still it seems he was a wonderful friend to a great many people and went out of his way to make them feel good. It could be a matter of both one-upsmanship and sour grapes: In his own mind he kept one-up on his rock`n`roll friends by holding to Krishna Consciousness by way of a supposedly profound and exotic (to Westerners) system of belief, one that would trump the superficiality of the celebrity circuit, and at the same time, he could wield his celebrity status to maintain a safe distance from real immersion in Krishna Con and many of its more boring adherents by keeping one foot in the world of music and film. Too bad he didn`t truly immerse himself for enough time to quit smoking, since that`s mainly what took away a decade or two from his lifespan. There`s where the sour grapes come in. It`s easier to accept that you`re dying prematurely (due to mostly your own misguided actions) if you believe that you`re not going to be missing much anyways since life is just maya and a pale shadow of a life beyond. I think if George had grown up in India, he might have eventually wanted to try on Roman Catholicism for size, but be equally ambivalent about that as well.

Would have liked to see more about his career as an executive film producer, presiding over a very impressive set of films. More on his 1991 tour of Japan. Would have been nice to get a Dylan interview but I guess there`s the Dylan ego problem. More on his development as an Indian-music-influenced slide guitar player. Something on how he helped wreck Ringo`s first marriage by having an affair with Mo (Of course, they both wound up with far happier second marriages, so...) Such suggestions are not to criticize Scorsese`s choices, but merely to suggest just how interesting and rich George`s post-Beatles life was. We appreciators of George as an equal of John or Paul as a songwriter and player as of 1969 would love to have seen more, but I guess a four-hour documentary might have been too much for most viewers.

Hilarious George ad Mac anecdote by Mac in the bonus features, though it does sound familiar. The bonus features are worth a peek, but all were definitely best left out.

Anyways, a deserving tribute to the man from a director of note with a genuine interest in Harrison`s life. Well-done. Bravo. Much better than I had anticipated.",1336089600,4,3401,4.616528925619835

I feel that I have been eternally touched and hope that you will be too.",1335916800,,505,4.308510638297872
4684095,5,B005FPT2E0,"Following on from his outstanding 2005 documentary of Bob Dylan's early career `No Direction Home' and his excellent series on the blues, Martin Scorsese again proves himself to be a master of the craft of in-depth bio-pic documentary film-making with this glorious, colourful, warts-and-all portrait of George Harrison.

The film is available either on two separate DVDs with the Beatles break-up as the divider, or as one single uninterrupted DVD - if you can take a three-and-a-half hour film in one sitting. Despite its 210-minute running time it never drags and holds the viewer's attention throughout.

The format is a roughly chronological narrative which follows Scorsese's usual `fly-on-the-wall' style of no-voiceover-commentary, allowing for the interviewees - Paul McCartney, Ringo, Eric Clapton, Phil Spector, Jackie Stewart, Klaus Voorman, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Olivia and Dhani Harrison and George himself (not a complete list by any means) - to do the talking. The memories are poignant, honest, heartfelt and engaging, offering a mostly sympathetic portrait of this most introspective of Beatles juxtaposed with archive footage and stills from George's long career, plus some live concert and studio sessions.

Some of the most arresting moments explore George's rejection of the trappings of fame, lack of interest in awards and quest for deeper self-knowledge and `spirituality'. Harrison's long friendship with Ravi Shankar and interest in Indian mysticism, his wicked sense of humour and his warm generosity, his love of privacy in his Surrey home which he carefully re-landscaped himself with spade in hand, all reveal a man who strove, sometimes in small ways and sometimes on a big canvas - like his 1971 visionary project to raise money for victims of the Bangladesh famine, a blueprint for Bob Geldof's `Live Aid' project 15 years later - to make the world a better place; to make a difference.

George Harrison was in so many ways an exceptional and atypical rock star, and Martin Scorsese has done him proud with this superb film. If you are of a later generation who missed the 1960s and 1970s, and the name George Harrison means little to you, then seeing this film might be time well spent; it'll give you a flavour of this talented, generous and unusual man. And BTW if you love and appreciate the Pythons' `Life of Brian' - well, it would never have seen the light of day without George, whose financial support enabled the film to be made.",1335916800,37,2477,5.123762376237623

""I want to tell you, my head is filled with things to say."" -- George Harrison, 1966

This is the documentary Beatle fans and George Harrison fans have prayed for and long awaited! As others have noted, I, too could have happily watched both installments at one time. Seeing it broken into 2 separate parts had an advantage in that it gave me something to look forward to wataching. This is a brilliant work covering the life and artwork of George Harrison, artist extraordinaire in his multi-faceted glory.

I've said all along that George was all about love. From the time George made his presence known and felt; from the time he was placed in the loving arms of Louise French Harrison and she saw her own intensity looking back at her; from the time Harold Sr. first set eyes on George and his only sister and two older brothers welcomed this ""new little Harrison,"" as Louise French Harrison would later describe George and other new arrivals (nieces, nephews and grandchildren) with much love. Harold Sr. and Louise French were from all accounts a very loving couple who were nuturing to their 4 children. George, surrounded by love from the beginning would live full circle by making a final request that people ""love one another.""

This documentary portrays the REAL George Harrison and does not degenerate into idolatry. George is shown in many moods, some less than cheery and shown warts, wrinkles, atrocious perm days and all.

George's fellow Wilburys and former Beatle bandmate Paul McCartney and wife Olivia provide the best interviews. I just wish more Harrison family members had been a part of this stellar documentary. George's sister, also named Louise has banged on the drum for her brother for many years. In fact, George was the first Beatle to cross the Atlantic, coming to America in 1963 to visit his only sister.

Most, if not all Harrison fans find George's view of religions very interesting. It has been documented that Louise French Harrison, herself Catholic had George baptized in March of 1943 when he was 1 month old. In 1965 George and Ravi Shankar met and during that time, George introduced the world at large to Eastern music and was exploring his philosophies and religious expression. His Catholic roots never left him; a lovely statue of Mother Mary graced his property at Friar Park.

Louise, George's only sister would say in an early April 2011 interview that it was a shock to her to discover that the ""real world"" wasn't as honest as Harold Sr. and Louise French were and not everybody lived up to their high standard of honesty. George too lived by that credo and he took things to heart deeply and passionately.

George was also fun. He liked cool cars and was an avid Formula One Fan. His sister had a serious Dodge Dart when he first came to visit her in 1963 when she was living in Benton, Illinois. He had a brilliant, dry, droll wit. He loved nature and demonstrated a very nurturing side, which was a Louise French trait. His passion for gardening was a gift from Harold Sr. and Louise French. George was an intensely curious and interested person, seeking information and trying to make sense out of the world in which he lived.

George had beautiful wavy hair, courtesy of Harold Sr.; the deep-set Harold Sr. eyes, but he had the burning Louise intensity that never once left his eyes. Pictures of George as an infant and as a very young child show his ubiquitous intensity, which never left him at any time. It could be a tad unnerving to see such intensity radiating from one so young. It was a trait that never left him. George resembled Harold Sr. from the eyes up. From the nose down, he was Louise French Harrison all over again and his brother Peter was almost a double of Harold Sr.! Harold Jr. looked more French than Harrison; he and George inherited their maternal grandfather's tall, lean frame. Lou was a Franco-Harrison creation as was George. You get to appreciate these things all the more in the book AND in the documentary. Paul McCartney even says in the book that George had a lot of Louise French's character and personality in him. Louise definitely left her stamp on George! Louise even said in the newsletter that she always thought George looked like her dad, John French Sr.)

Louise French Harrison lent her voice to the George Harrison Official Fan Club Newsletter from 1965-1969. It is plain that Louise loved George and his siblings and in her column, each Harrison child is included and given his or her place under Here Comes the Sun.

Olivia is a beautiful gracious lady and she discusses her life with George and some of the road bumps they hit along the way. She does so with grace, tact and aplomb. At no time does she resort to tawdry tale-bearing and finger pointing. Despite all they had been through together, they raised a good son and Olivia loved George, warts, problems, atrocious perms, infidelity and all. Dhani, their son resembles George and his maternal grandmother who unfortunately died 8 years before he was born. Clearly George and Olivia loved and cared about each other and again, to Olivia's credit, she is tactful and discreet when certain questions crop up. That reflects well on her and speaks to good.

Readers walk the Long & Winding Road with George from his early days until his untimely death in 2001. I love the way George could see humor in himself AND his fellow Beatles, as evidenced in his laughing at a Beatle video. The interviews make a good thing even better and I thank the kind person who made it possible for me to watch this until I am able to buy this dvd.

George Harrison has given the gift of his beautiful voice to many. I knew a child with Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form of autism. She was a MAJOR Beatles fan and George was her favorite. This child, like so many children with autism spectrum issues was a late talker. Once she acquired speech and an awareness of music, she found her voice in the Beatles. She would let George ""talk"" for her in that she would quote Harrison lyrics and lyrics from Beatle songs to get a point/message across. This later segued into richer, developed speech. As I said about the book, George Harrison's music and his natural, yet childlike grace of sorts reached countless many. He has a large following of fans with autism, as do the Beatles as a group. Beatle fans with autism is a demographic that is not at all rare or unusual.

George's humor comes through time and again. His sardonic wit after that crackpot broke into his home at the tail end of 1999 was evidenced when he said in re the crackpot: ""well, he sure wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys."" He had made peace with his life; he was surrounded by love every step of the way. George during his post-1999 brush with death had a very peaceful and serene look about him; his eyes, always intense like those of Louise French Harrison included an inner peace, like his 1968 song ""The Inner Light."" He disclosed his peace and the fact that he was ready to let go to Olivia, who bore this with dignity and grace.

A beautiful tribute to George and how meaningful his life has been in the eyes of those who knew him and others who love his art/music. George has brought more people closer to God. In fact, my church, which is a Catholic church uses George songs, some of which like ""Dear One"" are beautiful prayers set to music for our prayer meetings, Bible studes and discussion groups. George is, as we say ""a parishioner by proxy"" because his beautiful music and his open heart and mind have set a good example to countless people.

Bless George, George's family and all who have traveled down the Long & Winding Road with George.

This dvd is a MUST HAVE for all George Harrison fans.  Again, this book is a gift that will keep on giving.

4684109,5,B005FPT2E0,"I have always been interested and curious about George Harrison, being aware of his talent eclipsed by John and Paul while part of The Beattles. I also knew of his interest in Eastern spirituality but never really found out more about it. This film answers those questions and more. This documentary is extraordinary; of course, what else could we expect of Martin Scorsese!

The film documents, primarily based on the archives kept and life experiences shared by his wife Olivia, George's life from early infancy until his departure from this material existence. Along the way the viewer is treated to very rare photographs, intimate interviews with the many people who George deeply touched during this soujourn, home movies, and rare interview footage. We get to see various aspects and facets of the man: his wit, humor, charity, creativity, innovativeness, seriousness, perseverance, compassion, and depth. We also get an inkling about his vulnerabilities, though only by vague mention, his anger and weakness for the ladies, aspects only mentioned, very briefly, by his wife of thirty years, and Paul McCartney, probably to not take away the focus off the remarkable elements of George's life.

We also catch sight of his discontent with aspects of the 60's revolution, which, instead of being a mind expansion leading to greater achievements in humanity, it became a regression into useless and self satifying materialism. We also witness his work for the Concert for Bangla Desh, the first rock concert ever organized for charitable purposes and the greatest gathering of prominent artists since Woodstock, and his close involvement in film production with the Monty Python crew -George even morgaged his house so the Python's could produce the Life of Brian.

We see George as a musician, a collaborator, a creater, a spouse, a friend, a mystic, and a cool father. You may even have a tear pour out at some point, as Ringo does when he recalls the last words he heard from his friend shortly before disincarnating.",1332028800,,2023,5.1057401812688825

Over the years I had seen and heard many stories about the Beatle's and this is by far the most interesting. It covers most all of the mile stones in George's life and career. The greatest asset to this film is the interviews and insights by many of the people in his life that were there. But it also is a reminder of all of his many amazing songs that were part of the fabric of my life growing up.

I am not a major Beatles fan, But they were ever present as I grew up in the 70's and have older siblings that listened ,I became familar with a lot of their music.

What is especially annoying is that all the songs are cut off brutally... My 11 year old daughter was wondering why they did not choose a 'fading-out' technique to ending songs prematurely and actually why not just play the song to the end???
There sure has been a lot of cutting and jumping around from one interviewee to the next. It was great to hear Dhani read George's diary, but he could have been coached do to it more naturally.

In fact, George was the first Beatle to cross the Atlantic, coming to America in 1963 to visit his only sister.

Most, if not all Harrison fans find George's view of religions very interesting. It has been documented that Louise French Harrison, herself Catholic had George baptized in March of 1943 when he was 1 month old. In 1965 George and Ravi Shankar met and during that time, George introduced the world at large to Eastern music and was exploring his philosophies and religious expression. His Catholic roots never left him; a lovely statue of Mother Mary graced his property at Friar Park.

Louise, George's only sister would say in an early April 2011 interview that it was a shock to her to discover that the ""real world"" wasn't as honest as Harold Sr. and Louise French were and not everybody lived up to their high standard of honesty. George too lived by that credo and he took things to heart deeply and passionately.

George was also fun. He liked cool cars and was an avid Formula One Fan. His sister had a serious Dodge Dart when he first came to visit her in 1963 when she was living in Benton, Illinois. He had a brilliant, dry, droll wit. He loved nature and demonstrated a very nurturing side, which was a Louise French trait. His passion for gardening was a gift from Harold Sr. and Louise French. George was an intensely curious and interested person, seeking information and trying to make sense out of the world in which he lived.

George had beautiful wavy hair, courtesy of Harold Sr.; the deep-set Harold Sr. eyes, but he had the burning Louise intensity that never once left his eyes. Pictures of George as an infant and as a very young child show his ubiquitous intensity, which never left him at any time. It could be a tad unnerving to see such intensity radiating from one so young. It was a trait that never left him. George resembled Harold Sr. from the eyes up. From the nose down, he was Louise French Harrison all over again and his brother Peter was almost a double of Harold Sr.! Harold Jr. looked more French than Harrison; he and George inherited their maternal grandfather's tall, lean frame. Lou was a Franco-Harrison creation as was George. You get to appreciate these things all the more in the book AND in the documentary. Paul McCartney even says in the book that George had a lot of Louise French's character and personality in him. Louise definitely left her stamp on George! Louise even said in the newsletter that she always thought George looked like her dad, John French Sr.)

Louise French Harrison lent her voice to the George Harrison Official Fan Club Newsletter from 1965-1969. It is plain that Louise loved George and his siblings and in her column, each Harrison child is included and given his or her place under Here Comes the Sun.

Olivia is a beautiful gracious lady and she discusses her life with George and some of the road bumps they hit along the way. She does so with grace, tact and aplomb. At no time does she resort to tawdry tale-bearing and finger pointing. Despite all they had been through together, they raised a good son and Olivia loved George, warts, problems, atrocious perms, infidelity and all. Dhani, their son resembles George and his maternal grandmother who unfortunately died 8 years before he was born. Clearly George and Olivia loved and cared about each other and again, to Olivia's credit, she is tactful and discreet when certain questions crop up. That reflects well on her and speaks to good.

Readers walk the Long & Winding Road with George from his early days until his untimely death in 2001. I love the way George could see humor in himself AND his fellow Beatles, as evidenced in his laughing at a Beatle video. The interviews make a good thing even better and I thank the kind person who made it possible for me to watch this until I am able to buy this dvd.

George Harrison has given the gift of his beautiful voice to many. I knew a child with Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form of autism. She was a MAJOR Beatles fan and George was her favorite. This child, like so many children with autism spectrum issues was a late talker. Once she acquired speech and an awareness of music, she found her voice in the Beatles. She would let George ""talk"" for her in that she would quote Harrison lyrics and lyrics from Beatle songs to get a point/message across. This later segued into richer, developed speech. As I said about the book, George Harrison's music and his natural, yet childlike grace of sorts reached countless many. He has a large following of fans with autism, as do the Beatles as a group. Beatle fans with autism is a demographic that is not at all rare or unusual.

George's humor comes through time and again. His sardonic wit after that crackpot broke into his home at the tail end of 1999 was evidenced when he said in re the crackpot: ""well, he sure wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys."" He had made peace with his life; he was surrounded by love every step of the way. George during his post-1999 brush with death had a very peaceful and serene look about him; his eyes, always intense like those of Louise French Harrison included an inner peace, like his 1968 song ""The Inner Light."" He disclosed his peace and the fact that he was ready to let go to Olivia, who bore this with dignity and grace.

A beautiful tribute to George and how meaningful his life has been in the eyes of those who knew him and others who love his art/music. George has brought more people closer to God. In fact, my church, which is a Catholic church uses George songs, some of which like ""Dear One"" are beautiful prayers set to music for our prayer meetings, Bible studies and discussion groups. George is, as we say ""a parishioner by proxy"" because his beautiful music and his open heart and mind have set a good example to countless people.

Bless George, George's family and all who have traveled down the Long & Winding Road with George.

4684126,5,B005FPT2E0,Thoroughly enjoyed this documentary.  Would very much like to purchase this documentary as a Christmas gift.  I don't understand why this DVD would be released in one country and not another. What is stopping the public from recording this show off HBO?  What is the purpose of waiting for a Spring release in the USA?,1321401600,15,318,4.745454545454545
4684127,3,B005FPT2E0,"George Harrison: Living in the Material World is a documentary by Martin Scorsese. The film is approximately four hours long, and since HBO doesn't allow folks to pause for bathroom breaks, delivered in two parts, the evenings of October 5 and 6. It was billed by Olivia Harrison, the ex-Beatle's widow, as definitive. She admitted that it was made, in part, to get the adulatory public off her (and son Dhani's) back.

I suppose it's entirely possible to enjoy an artist, only to dislike a documentary or biopic about the person. This happens rarely; in fact, it's more often than not the opposite. It's revealing to watch films like Scott Joplin, where Billy Dee Williams played the very-unlikeable ragtime star. I liked the film. I learned a lot, through the filter of Hollywood storytelling of course, but these things are informative. Recently, I reviewed No Direction Home, Scorsese's documentary that reveals Bob Dylan's early years. I find Dylan to be an extremely unlikeable fellow, but I left the film feeling sympathetic toward him. Furthermore, I admired Scorsese's craftsmanship.

The opposite occurred when I watched Living in the Material World. Maybe this is because I knew the story already. I've read a number of biographies about the guy, watched all ten hours of the Beatles Anthology, and heard most of the film clips. It was interesting to hear Eric Clapton's voice, as well as former wives Patty Boyd and Olivia Harrison. The usual cast was there: the surviving ex-Beatles, and their inner circle, as well as Yoko Ono, sitting in for John. We also got to see auto racer Jackie Stewart, Monty Python alumnus Eric Idle, and rocker Tom Petty.

The story was banal. What stones were there left to turn over? The media have scavenged for Beatles trivia for the fifty years now, when they first landed their recording contract. We knew George wrote Taxman, and had a stereotypically Scottish obsession with hoarding money. We knew he was quite sour with Paul when the Beatles broke up. We knew he poured himself into Eastern thoughts and religion.

Scorsese barely mentions Harrison's family. Is this out of respect to Harrison's privacy, or does the director just view it as irrelevant? I notice that No Direction Home pays no attention to Dylan's family either. I suppose I found myself wishing the film had dug deeper.

The friends interviewed seemed to universally state things like ""I wish I believed we were close friends, but I just don't know."" Even Clapton, who I always assumed was Harrison's closest friend, said this, as did Tony Stewart, Jeff Lynne, Eric Idle, and Tom Petty. It makes me wonder where the title came from. I assume because of his adherence to Eastern thought. Harrison himself marks Ravi Shankar as one of the most influential human beings in his life: ""certain people can teach without saying a word. Ravi Shankar is one of those people.""

Olivia said that one of George's greatest regrets of Lennon's 1980 death was that John was unable to leave his body in the way he chose. This was a predominant narrative throughout the latter half of the film. George says everything in life was a preparation for his moment of death, when he leaves his body. I suppose, in a way, this was my one discovery from the film: all life, for George, is a preparation for being ready to die. His thoughts were nearly borne out in 1999: the documentary devotes 10 or 15 minutes to Harrison's home invasion, when he and his wife were stabbed and nearly killed by a deranged fan. It made me think of the line from the Bob Dylan track ""It's All Right Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"": ""...he not busy being born is busy dying."" I wondered if Scorsese noticed the similarity between the philosophies of his two subjects.

The first ten minutes of the documentary were chaotic, in a rapidfire review of several songs and pictures, from current Harrison to old Beatles at their peak, to a pre-Beatles Harrison on a tape recorder. Cutaways in the first ten minutes were of video and still montages, songs, color and b&w. If I had not known Harrison's early story, I'd have felt a bit cheated, as the overwhelming amount of information being given me at once. I'm sure it was intentional on Scorsese's part. Every once in awhile, throughout the film the editing was startling: there would be several seconds of black, or moving from a song, to silence. I'm sure these effects, too, had some sort of meaning. It escaped me, and simply proved to be an annoying distraction.

There were a few moments of joy and beauty. He loved his garden, and worked for hours on end, sometimes by moonlight. We find out that in the 1970s he gave up the sitar, when he realized that his medium would always be guitar; and there, he redoubled his efforts to pop music. We understand, from two or three new angles, the story of Patty Boyd, Clapton, and Harrison. Clapton himself refers to the Harrison home in Esher as Camelot, and to himself as Lancelot. Two or three letters home, to Harrison's mother, while on tour, were beautifully and touchingly read. Harrison's was the only family untouched by death or divorce. When Ringo told the camera Harrison's last words to him, a tear ran down the drummer's eye, as well as my wife's and my own.

In well, it was a well-executed, if pedestrian documentary. The first quarter-hour was chaotic and confusing. It gave nothing new to veteran Beatles fans. I liked it. Nothing amazing.",1321315200,6,5420,4.775880469583778

""I want to tell you, my head is filled with things to say."" -- George Harrison, 1966

This is the documentary Beatle fans and George Harrison fans have prayed for and long awaited! As others have noted, I, too could have happily watched both installments at one time. Seeing it broken into 2 separate parts had an advantage in that it gave me something to look forward to wataching. This is a brilliant work covering the life and artwork of George Harrison, artist extraordinaire in his multi-faceted glory.

I've said all along that George was all about love. From the time George made his presence known and felt; from the time he was placed in the loving arms of Louise French Harrison and she saw her own intensity looking back at her; from the time Harold Sr. first set eyes on George and his only sister and two older brothers welcomed this ""new little Harrison,"" as Louise French Harrison would later describe George and other new arrivals (nieces, nephews and grandchildren) with much love. Harold Sr. and Louise French were from all accounts a very loving couple who were nuturing to their 4 children. George, surrounded by love from the beginning would live full circle by making a final request that people ""love one another.""

This documentary portrays the REAL George Harrison and does not degenerate into idolatry. George is shown in many moods, some less than cheery and shown warts, wrinkles, atrocious perm days and all.

George's fellow Wilburys and former Beatle bandmate Paul McCartney and wife Olivia provide the best interviews. I just wish more Harrison family members had been a part of this stellar documentary.

I have been a George Harrison fan for many years and I just could not wait to get my hands on this.
The dvd or blueray is surely only for the keen harrison/Beatle fan, if you are not - don't buy.
I am actually a little disappointed, and I actually most probably have expected too much.
I say that there was no inclusion of Badfinger and Splinter - George was strongly involved with them. These would have been worth the inclusion. The dvd focused more of the hara krishna stuff.
I also would have loved all his singles complete with video in this set. The strong point is that the mixing of those songs are awesome in 5.1 surround. Hopefully that will come next.",1320105600,,771,4.361111111111111
4684131,3,B005FPT2E0,"The first 10 minutes of LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD is stunning in its use of the archival visuals, showing the audience how The Beatles came about through a confluence of things including the harsh reality of post-World War II England, the rise of American rock and roll, and the chance meetings of four cocky but talented young lads who wanted to make it big. Once this very impressive intro passes by, LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD dives into conventional bio storytelling that centers largely on George -- and that's where the problems begin. It's not George's fault that he's a bit dull. As he says himself somewhere toward the end of the film from what is probably a 1980s or 1990s interview, he's not a showbiz kind of guy. Far from it, he's a spiritualist living in a mansion who was, by all accounts of those who knew him, a good and kind friend and a great dad. Lovely man, for sure, a bit dire at times, but still a man who really did try to live a decent and meaningful life and strived to help others when he could. He also loved the ukulele. And long, meandering Indian tunes. And he loved planting trees. You see where I am going here? A meaningful and decent life is admirable, but it's also pretty dull as story material for a documentary.

4684132,3,B005FPT2E0,"We'll soon be marking the tenth anniversary of George Harrison's death, this project has been in the works for quite some time and I find myself torn over this release.  As a Beatles fan, a George fan, I was excited to see the documentary being broadcast on HBO in two parts totaling nearly four hours.  Here is the first issue-why only four hours?  A life such as Harrisons' deserves much more.  If four hours is all you're allotted, make the most of it!  Although the first part of the film focuses primarily on The Beatles, it is not entirely chronological-this may please some, but I found it irritating.  Most can agree that one of the incredible aspects of this band is how quickly they developed; musically and personally.  This film jumps back and forth so much, it gives the viewer a sense of confusion or, even worse, haphazard movie-making.  Within the first hour, we are shown George's devotion to Ravi Shankar, the sitar before we really understand why!  Very poor editing.  There are lots of unseen photos and film clips which is fantastic-just keep them in some kind of order, Mr. Scorsese!  There are interviews with many of George's intimates yet we're given just a few lines from, say, Eric Clapton, cut to some photos, then back to Clapton via Ringo Starr!  The majority of the interviews are fascinating.  Pattie Boyd, Eric Clapton, Paul, Ringo, the list goes on.  It's too bad that Pattie is given short-shrift as this is a great opportunity for her to lend her insight into a younger George.  Klaus Voorman and Astrid Kirschner are similarly treated.  What a pity.  Even Yoko Ono makes a brief appearance which comes off as being awkward at best.  Moving on to the music.  With such an enormous wealth at his disposal, Mr. Scorsese really blows it.  I can't recall one song of George's being played in full throughout this movie and I've watched it twice!  The music is butchered.  Thirty seconds into a song, cut to a snippet of an interview. A perfect example of this is with Clapton talking about the evolution of 'Here Comes the Sun'. Song, cut to Clapton, song, cut to Ringo, etc.  While Harrison's faith is discussed throughout the movie, it should have been woven into the story in a better manner that we can understand and appreciate.  Thirty seconds into a song-cut to interview.  Part two doesn't fare much better production-wise, but is still packed with tons of unseen, unreleased footage and an emotional ending featuring Olivia Harrison, George's second wife.  Very open, very moving.  Son Dhani is interviewed and also serves as something of a narrator.  Many fans will certainly enjoy this very much, I felt it deserved four out of five stars simply because the man hasn't received this kind of treatment after all these years.  But beware, lots of the material you'll see were simply lifted from the Beatles Anthology Series released back in the 90's.  In the end, we're not left understanding this extraordinary individual any better...how did this one man have such an amazing impact on the world?  Maybe we'll never know-maybe we're not supposed to.  I'm guessing this film will be reworked into a director's cut or an 'extended' version for dvd.  We'd love to see what was left on the cutting room floor!",1319587200,23,3248,4.773788150807899
4684133,5,B005FPT2E0,"This is extremely well done, and there is much to love and appreciate about George Harrison.  I went from not knowing much about him to being completely and utterly intrigued.",1319414400,2,175,4.833333333333333
4684134,3,B005FPT2E0,"The documentary has so many gaps, I wouldn't know which I should start with. The most blatant are George's music and some people in his life.

Re the missing music: there is nothing that George recorded between Dark Horse and The Traveling Wilburys. No 33 & 1/3, no All Those Years Ago, not even Cloud Nine (including the great videos of these records). Also: nothing from the pro-shot 1991 Japanese tour with Eric, from the Prince's Trust Concert, and neither from the Carl Perkins TV special.

It's true the documentary is 3 and a half hours long, but had it to be a one-piece film? George wanted an Anthology, like the Beatles' one, so why didn't they make a series of 7 or 8 episodes? They had plenty of material.

The other big absence is Patty's. In this respect, Olivia did quite a nasty job. Patty, the woman who shared the most significant part of George's life, the one who introduced him to the Indian spirituality, is reduced to some discussions about her infidelity with Eric. As for her presence in the film, there is a fragment of an old footage (quite insignificant) where she was a bit angry with the other three Beatles, and a paragraph from her (audio)book. Isn't that a shame...

How ironic this must be for Patty: after being forced to deal with the fans' nastiness in the 60's (and she was constantly physically and verbally abused), with all the humiliations coming from George (mainly his many infidelities inclusively with Ringo's first wife), as well as with George's public statement that Something was not about her (he could be a perfect gentleman sometimes, George), now she is refused her own past and history. By Olivia. But how could the great Scorsese have no say in this matter and accept this flagrant gap? Go figure.

The movie has some highlights, hence the three stars: Ringo, Astrid, Klaus and (even) Paul give some emotional insights full of sincerity.",1319328000,32,1893,4.724242424242425
4684135,5,B005FPT2E0,"A documentary on a music celebrity can be measured by content and insight - what footage did they access and who was willing to contribute and what new light did it shed on the subject? On the first point Martin Scorsese knocks the ball out of the park. Though I didn't feel I knew George any better than before by the end, I was treated to nearly four hours of dazzling and emotionally moving entertainment.

I watched both parts of the film at UK preview and at no point did my attention or enthusiasm flag. In fact I would have happily sat through any outtakes! This beautifully crafted film is packed with concert footage, home movies, press conferences, interviews, photos and documents that I've never seen before, even though I've been researching the Beatles quite heavily for several years for Beatles Songwriting Academy. There are interviews with (or at least footage of) everyone you would hope to see. Beatles, wives, brothers, son, Pythons and peers. Everyone from Eric Clapton to Eric Idle.

The documentary is constructed entirely from interviews and clips without explanation or analysis. The closest we get to a voiceover is Dhani Harrison reading excerpts from his father's diary and letters to his mum. Though the film is visually stunning it's strange watching the practically square picture forced upon us by the source material. Equally quirky is the sound editing. Scorsese doesn't know the meaning of 'fade'. All the music cuts brutally, sometimes after a few seconds. Sometimes this is cool. Mostly it's odd. The film is largely chronological and there are some great juxtapositions of sound and visuals like All Things Must Pass accompanies footage of the WW2 bombers that plagued the Liverpool of Harrison's birth. The first part covers George's life up to the White Album.

It's hard to pick out favourite parts. But Harrison's obvious delight watching archive footage of the Beatles miming This Boy, laughing and singing along, is one. The Beatles performing If I Needed Someone, Harrison playing What Is Love? with Billy Preston, and seeing the Travelling Wilburys in the studio would be others.

There are moments of laugh out loud humour, especially TV footage of crusty professors discuss the significance of Pop music while Beatles and Mick Jagger seeth like captive wild animal in the background and Tom Petty recounting Harrison arriving at his house with a trunk full of ukeleles. But Harrison's story of how Lennon and McCartney inspired him to start composing is the best - ""If John and Paul can write [songs] everybody must be able to"". The Maharishi (a spiritual Joe Pasquali) and Phil Spector (a croaking, unblinking vision of craziness with a permanent twitching thumb) also provide some unintentional humour.

Scorsese deserves praise for not going down the revisionist myth making route trodden by the Anthology series, especially as Olivia Harrison was one of his producers. Olivia is honest, though vague, about George's infidelity as is Klaus Voorman is about his drug problems. But the lack of a narrator almost makes George a mirror in which we see his world. We know he was loved, deeply, by friends - racing drivers, comedians and film makers, musicians, but we don't whether he was truly loveable. Terry Gilliam describes George as a mix of ""grace, humour and a weird kind of angry bitterness"" but what made him that way? Did he ever find a release from that bitterness? Was he a good father? Nearing death Harrison asked Olivia if he had been a good husband. She never tells us what her answer was.""What's the secret of a long marriage?"" She asks herself. ""Don't get divorced"".

It may sound strange but the highest point for me was simply hearing the music. Listening to Here Comes The Sun and While My Guitar Gently Weeps I was almost moved to tears at the transcendent beauty of those recordings.

Perhaps the fact that the film cause me to fall in love with the music all over again is it's greatest recommendation.",1319155200,76,3974,4.931240657698057

8470401,5,B005FPT2E0,"Watched this on Netflix and just fell in love with George.  As a fan of the Beatles and most of their solo careers, oddly, George was someone i never fully was all that interested in.  Sure, I liked him....he was a Beatle!  Sure, I knew he had a few memorable songs from the The Beatles and during the 70s, but until the Travelling Wilburys, he just did not peak my interest too much.  And even during the Wilbury years, I still didn't give him all that much credit.....he's pals with these guys, so they probably just brought him along.  But, I now understand....that's George Harrison.  He never wanted to be a front man.  Never wanted to be superstar.  The guy was extremely talented.  So, this doc open my eyes to a very interesting man.  So much so, I am currently reading his biography, Behind the Locked Door.",1518393600,,816,4.489795918367347

8470403,5,B005FPT2E0,"One of the finest documentary about one of the true genius behind the Beatles. He started off behind John and Paul, and by the end of the Beatles had a back log of music that the Beatles never used and crafted the 3 disc LP, All Things Must Pass. An album of such passion that it is the finest solo LP from any members of the former Beatles hands down. This documentary preserves the beauty of the human being that was George Harrison. A serious Rocker who was also a gentle soul and a man of spiritual nature. I could not get enough of this film and at 3 hours plus, its so well worth the time to spend learning about the quiet Beatle.",1516147200,,636,4.137096774193548
