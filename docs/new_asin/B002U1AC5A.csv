8380870,5,B002U1AC5A,"I bought this item as a present for my husband and he just recently open it.  While we were watching after the opening credit a series of B&W pictures were showing but there was no sound. I thought it was the way the opening worked until I saw on the back of the cover that a poem was taking place while the B&W pictures were shown. Would it possible to replace this item for one that has audio on its entirety. what should I do?
I appreciate your feedback,
