There do not seem to be many videos of him commercially available.  I have two others.

In this dvd, which is about an hour long, you will see the main authors of his work Jay Haley, author of Uncommon Conversations, and Conversations with Erickson, Ernest Rossi and Jeffrey Zeig share their personal experiences of Erickson.

You will also see segments with different family members, including his wife Betty, his daughter Betty Alice, son Allan, daughter Roxanne, and daughter in law Luanne.

Included is footage of Erickson in session. If you're like me you may find the one with the girl in the wheelchair particularly interesting.

Interestingly, her main goal was to walk, and Erickson, in a wheelchair himself said 'if we can't make you walk, then what?' The answer was to handle the pain.  She is shown again three years later sitting on a couch and talking about her experience.

If you are hoping to see a ton of footage of Erickson hypnotising people, you will see numerous clips from different periods of his life, with very little extended footage of any one session.

I trust you find this helpful.",1225238400,51,1188,4.784313725490196
