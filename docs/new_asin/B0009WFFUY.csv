8068340,3,B0009WFFUY,"First of all: I have to say I am a friend of the guy who made this movie.  It takes a lot to make a concept into a film, and the work involved is often excruciating with no budget whatsoever.  So this is how I recommend you watch this movie - zero budget, lots of work, and a good imagination.

As to its aesthetics; well, if you are in the mood for campy this should fill you up just fine.",1419465600,2,390,3.85
