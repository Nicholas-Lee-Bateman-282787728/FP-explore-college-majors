8726501,5,B012SEEZ2O,"This is no doubt the best production of Love's Labour's Lost I have ever seen. The acting is excellent. It's set in 1914, just before World War I. The RSC adds music---Moth sings a sonnet by Michael Drayton, they turn The Nine Worthies into a mini-operetta in the style of Gilbert & Sullivan, and at the end when they sing Berowne's sonnet to Rosaline, it's so beautiful I was in tears.

Love's Labour's Won (AKA Much Ado About Nothing) is set in 1918 after the war and with the same cast and is equally excellent.",1462665600,5,514,4.410526315789474

8726503,4,B012SEEZ2O,"Christopher Luscombe, the director, tells us that he was asked by the Royal Shakespeare Company to pair up Loves Labours Lost and Much Ado About Nothing. He decided to place both plays on Charlecote Park, which is located a stones throw from Stratford. In this RSCs production, Much Ado About Nothing is presented as the sequel to Loves Labours Lost. These two plays have been moved from the 15th  16th centuries to the beginning of the 20th century. In addition to these changes, the title of Much Ado About Nothing is substituted by Loves Labours Won, i.e., a title of one of the so-called Shakespeares lost plays. The main argument for the title change is Beatrices comment addressed to Benedick I know you of old. This comment indicates that Beatrice and Benedick met before. However, Beatrice points out that during that previous encounter, she was mistreated by Benedick. She openly complains that once before he won it of me with false dice. This does not apply to the situation illustrated in Loves Labours Lost. In that play, it was the lady who rejected the man. Gregory Doran, the artistic director of RSC, defends the title change by saying that nobody has yet given me any evidence to suggest that Much Ado About Nothing cannot have been Loves Labours Won. Lets recall that there are very few things about Shakespeare and his plays that may be proven by evidence. It seems that the entire Shakespeares project was intentionally designed in such as a way as to demonstrate that certain processes within the human mind are beyond the grasp of rationality and intellectuality. As I indicate in the reviews of these two RSCs productions, it is not evidence but certain ambiguities that drive the plots of the plays. It is these ambiguities that act as a subtle signal superimposed on the plays plots and links them together. In this way, all plays form a single coherent narrative. Shakespeare refers to this subtle signal as the music that may not be heard. This is why the scholarly methodology is at a loss when trying to resolve Shakespeares enigma. There is no place in this endeavour for scholarly evidences. Instead, one needs to overcome intellectual and emotional reflexes, put aside personal liking and disliking, and abandon preconceived ideas, favourite views and biased personal opinions. Only then this non audible music may be perceived and followed. It seems that the RSC producers overall aim was to further enshrine Stratford and its surrounding. They were more concerned with reproducing details of 20th century Charlecote Park than paying attention to Shakespeares words. In accordance with Shakespeares narrative, the plays are set in specific places and at specific times. Much Ado About Nothing takes place in 15th century Messina of Sicily; this play is the third episode within Shakespeares Italian sequence. Loves Labours Lost is set in the 16th century Kingdom of Navarre; this play is the concluding episode of Shakespeares French trilogy. Therefore, placing these two plays on a 20th century English estate removes the links between these and other plays; it veils the audience from perceiving the overall design of Shakespeares plays. This, of course, does not mean that the RSCs productions are not enjoyable and entertaining.",1451520000,9,3266,5.036968576709796
