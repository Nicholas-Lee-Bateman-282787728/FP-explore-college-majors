And no one represents that era better than Gene Kelly, who got my attention when I was little and watched his movies and specials on tv.  On this DVD, it was fun seeing the stars who worked with him at MGM.  And how about the man, at almost 66 years of age, still being able to perform like that??  I know there are plenty of Kelly fans out there.  Buy it.  You will love it!",1362182400,,489,4.138297872340425
