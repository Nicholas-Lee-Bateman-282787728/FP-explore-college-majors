Three professional criminals including Georges (Tom Georgeson) set out to steel some diamonds. They need a fourth person with martial or weapons skills. This person Otto (Kevin Kline) is Wanda's (Jamie Lee Curtis) supposed brother.

Each criminal then covets the pilfered plunder individually. Wanda has the upper hand until the diamonds are not where they are supposed to be.

The only way to obtain their location is for Wanda to rub up against Georges' barrister, Archie Leach (John Cleese.) This close encounter irks Otto. This creates a pericoloso situation.

Will the diamonds be found and by whom?

The character interaction and one-liners make the movie.",1496534400,,756,5.1138211382113825
