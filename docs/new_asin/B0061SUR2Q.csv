4931683,5,B0061SUR2Q,"This DVD contains two episodes of ""Turnaround King"", an hour-long show that appeared on the National Geographic Channel in 2011.

The ""hero"" is Grant Cardone, known as a sales trainer but truly a business turnaround specialist.  His clients in the first episode are a family who owns a Gold's Gym franchise in Whippany, NJ, and who are around $700K in debt.  In the second episode, we see two brothers who are the third-generation of ownership of a GMC/Buick dealership in Keyport, NJ, hemorraging money to the point where payroll is met out of the brothers' personal savings.

While this show is reminicent of Gordon Ramsay's ""Kitchen Nightmares"", Grant's clients are uniformly nice people, not always the case in Gordon Ramsay's show.  Also, while Grant ""tells it like it is"", he's less ""in your face"" or as abrasive as Gordon.

Just a few tips I picked up from watching these episodes:

--- a ""sales culture"" is important.  As many people as possible should make promoting the business and its special features a part of their job.  Everyone should be ""all in""...interesting to note in the Gold's Gym episode, the rank-and-file employees had more passion and energy than the owners, at first.

--- Price is definitely not as important as ""value"", especially in showing clients you care, and why what you have to offer is special.  A ""unique selling feature"" or ""unique selling proposition"" is key.

--- In the 21st Century, spending more time with clients doesn't translate to more sales.  There is a specific process for selling where there's mutual discovery and agreement, clever use of technology, and a logically deduced ""close"" all within a short period of time.

As one of the owners of the auto dealership said, ""Grant's not showing us anything new.""  The difference is how it's all put together, in a way where it's easy to take action.

The primary thing I took away from my viewing: the skills taught and learned in these two episodes are transferrable for any business.

Grant comes off as a caring, winning individual.  Both clients turnaround the fortunes of their respective businesses.

PLEASE NOTE: I don't know Mr. Cardone, nor am affiliated with him in any way.  I merely own three of his books (and now, this video).",1329264000,4,2239,4.888594164456234
8490972,4,B0061SUR2Q,"PROS: loved seeing Grant in action. It's one thing to read sales literature but it's a different ballgame getting to watch things unfold. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it.

CONS: this only has 2 episodes...you're paying $20 for 2 episodes. The only way I could rationalize that is if your business/line of work was in either a gym or a car dealership (the focus of the 2 episodes). Otherwise, the price seems a bit high but ""what are ya gonna do?""

FINAL THOUGHTS: Grant, make another show. You don't need a deal on a network. Make it yourself and sell access or seasons. Clearly there is a market for this so why not be the first?!?",1473465600,,629,4.413793103448276

He makes it look easy, but the truth is, it IS easy, and he shows people how easy it can be to change how you look at things and turn things around, not only for your business, but for your life.",1420329600,,251,3.9411764705882355
8490975,5,B0061SUR2Q,"No doubt the show is great, it's not even TV show it is more like educational program.
There is only one big minus - only 2 episodes. I wish thee would be a complete season consists of 11-12 episodes.
Anyway, this DVD is equal to good sales book.",1397520000,,246,4.145833333333333

8490977,5,B0061SUR2Q,"The man knows people and he knows how to sell. You don't have to like everything about him to accept that. His books/audio programs/video programs and this DVD are great if you want to learn how to sell or up your game. At first when I came across his books I thought it was fluff. Then I read up on him and the guy has made serious paper in his core business and in real estate. Grant Cardone's main product line involves providing materials and training to salespeople that teach them how to sell or sell better. If he can make big $$$ doing that, then unless I have proven I can move as much or more product in the marketplace then I can learn something from him. It's a shame that they cut this show Turnaround King short. He really does have the Midas Touch when it comes to turning around companies and salespeople. And they're all simple concepts that he uses. Simple to learn, hard to master.",1381968000,,900,4.331360946745562
8490978,5,B0061SUR2Q,"Grant Cardone is simply outstanding! Love the simplicity of the message, but then again success is simple the catch is that it is not easy.... only worth it!",1374451200,,157,4.642857142857143
8490979,5,B0061SUR2Q,"In this exciting program, sales expert Grant Cardone works with small business owners who are struggling because sales are not where they need to be.  The businesses featured in the program include a gym and a car dealership.

Cardone begins by interviewing the owners and staff to find out why they think sales are poor.  Next, he presents a plan for increasing sales.  Each plan is very logical and systematic, focusing on two things:

1. Basic selling skills: how to greet a customer when they walk in the door, how to assess the customer's unique needs and desires, how to give them a tour of the business to emphasize what the business has to offer, how to present a sales offer, how to overcome objections, and how to close the sale.  Plus a great deal more.

2.  The training is for ALL employees, not just sales people.

Cardone takes all of the staff through his sales training program, and works with them so they all understand how to put into practice what they have learned.  This infuses a SALES CULTURE in each of the businesses Cardone works with.

I cannot recommend this program highly enough.  If you own a business and sales are not where they need to be, GET THIS DVD, study it, and put what you learn into practice.",1341446400,,1237,4.547511312217194
8490980,5,B0061SUR2Q,"I read his books, and watched his video, and I must say that he's terrific. But his turnarounds focus nearly exclusively on sales and pricing. That's okay, but it's limited. Turnarounds also include firing the undeserving and the interfering, elevating the worthy, negotiating with various constituencies to trim their claims, tighten operations, cut some products and expand others, and other such sleep-disrupting tasks.

Yet, I give Grant's work 5 stars, because most of the other books on turnarounds focus on the latter aspects, and less on the sales-boosting parts. Therefore, Grant's work is a welcome addition to the reading of all turnaround specialists, whether budding or experienced. (I am more the latter.)

Two specific comments, though, and somewhat related:

First: In the turnaround of the Gold gym, it was quite apparent that the younger brother was unsuited to his position, and was a negative. Not only he did not believe in the product, in the team, and in himself, but he syphoned away energy from others. In a turnaround done by a new partner, he would be gone, or re-assigned.

Second: It is quite clear that Grant's motivation is not really money, but an audience. In the case of the Gold gym, all he had to do was wait for the family to go bankrupt, then take over the mortgage and own the joint, at which point he could negotiate with the bank for a haircut in the mortgage amount, and only THEN do his sales-boosting magic. The revenues could then again surpass $1 million per year, and after a year or two, he could have made himself a cool half a million, perhaps more, on very little investment.

Of course, this would have come at the expense of bank, which would have taken a haircut on the mortgage, which is sort of acceptable, but also at the expense of the family, who would have lost their home, and would have to go work for others-- since they clearly were not able to be managers.

It is their good luck that Grant did them this favour, both out of sentiment (remembering the misfortune of his own father), and because his real motivation is that of a showman, rather than that of a money-accumulator. i.e.: He wants to make money on the video and on consulting, and receive kudos and applause, rather than on owning a growing business and receive little more than dollars.

In other words, he is a good man, whose goodness costs him. Luckily, here it did not cost others-- the gym's employees. Because at a certain point, if the entire owner-family were like younger son, Cardone's bound duty would have been to kick them out in some fashion, run the place himself (and make a half million, yes), so as to let everyone else maintain their job.

As I said, they are lucky they got him-- and so are we, to see his videos and read his books. Buy them.",1335744000,2,2790,4.645030425963489
8490981,5,B0061SUR2Q,"This video has two episodes of Grant helping struggling businesses turn around their sales. If you're a fan of Grant's no nonsense sales techniques and philosophies, you'll love it. This was a great educational/motivational video for my college-bound son to watch. I only wish there were more than two episodes included.",1331942400,2,320,5.294117647058823
