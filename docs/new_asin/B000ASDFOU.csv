8079600,5,B000ASDFOU,"I enjoyed this DVD so much.  Ninon Sevilla is the best rhumba dancer of all times. She felt the rhythm and danced so gracefully. This is a vintage movie, of course. But, I find incredible that in the 1940s and early 1950s, movies were being made in Mexico to fit to the dancing of Ninon Sevilla. I understand this genre is now being called the Tropical Queens. Way to go, Ninon!",1355529600,7,378,4.323943661971831
