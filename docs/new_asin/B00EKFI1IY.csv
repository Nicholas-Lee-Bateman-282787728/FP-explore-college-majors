8606363,1,B00EKFI1IY,"The series is great but one of the discs was loose when delivered and scratched badly. In addition, you can't watch it unless you switch your ps4 over to another country setting to be compatible for viewing, however, you can only switch it over 4 times on the ps4, so not sure how I'll be able to watch this after a couple more times...",1487721600,,336,4.265625
8606364,5,B00EKFI1IY,The DVD's meet the description and work perfectly.,1483315200,,50,5.375
8606365,5,B00EKFI1IY,"One of the best TV series I've ever watched.  Engaging, Original, Funny, Dramatic, Well Acted, all actors were excellent.  Refreshing in this age of sappy soap operas and fake reality shows.

What would you do if you suddenly had a super power?  What if your super power was a bit..inconvenient?  I came to love each and every character on this show, when a new person entered, I didn't think I'd like them as much as the original cast members, but it turned out that I loved them too!  Original concept, very well written, I love (and miss!) these guys like they're my actual friends.  Robert Sheehan was naughty but nice, the now infamous Iwan Rheon showed his star quality and Joesph Gilgun was simply superb, but Lauren Socha was my favorite character overall.

If only American TV shows were this good.",1481673600,,807,4.673758865248227
