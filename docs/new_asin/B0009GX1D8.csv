8060467,4,B0009GX1D8,"You'll also find this under the title Confessions of a Young Bride outside of the US.  It's basically the tale of a bride planning her wedding, told from her point of view to the viewer (Malcolm in the Middle style to a camera, that she stops and talks to every now and then).  Of course things don't go smoothly or there wouldn't be much of a movie, her boyfriend has surprised her with an apartment for them to move into six months or so before the wedding, she's feeling the stress of talking to caterers, gift registry retailer, planning the seating, getting a dress, dealing with her parents and the in laws, the florist, cake providers and everything else that she is making into a life and death decision while her boyfriend really doesn't care. This is affecting her performance at work where they are set to land a huge contract.  She thinks she's about to be fired due to her performance but is surprised that the client has insisted he works with her. Even more surprised when it is a guy called Luke a handsome guy she worked on a group assignment at university with. who she used to fantasized about being in a relationship with.  Unfortunately for her back in the day she fell over a railing and class was over by the time she got out of hospital.

It has a lot of sight gags, and is more than just a chick flick about getting married, although it is fairly predictable and the storyline a bit formulaic it's something guys can more than sit through as well.  The only actor I recognised was Geoff Stults who plays Luke, who was in the later seasons of 7th Heaven.  But Shannon Elizabeth (the main character and bride to be) and the supporting to a more than adequate job.",1493510400,,1686,4.436893203883495

8060470,4,B0009GX1D8,"This isn't your typical movie where boy meets girl, they fall in love and live happily ever after.  This movie is about a couple who are already established in a relationship.  At first they seem like the perfect couple who are happily in love.  But then he proposes, they find the perfect house, and decide to move in together before they get married.  That's when the problems start.  This once happy couple start bickering about everything from wedding plans, to how they want to set up their house, to how many kids they want.  Throw in an old college crush, and this couple are starting to wonder if they really knew each other at all.  What I love about this movie is that it shows relationships in a healthy light.  It's not all about meeting the perfect person, and having the perfect wedding.  It's about knowing relationships are not always easy, but you're willing to put the work in if you really love someone, and want to spend the rest of your life with that person.

This movie gives an important lesson on relationships, while still being funny and enjoyable.  Shannon Elizabeth has such great, comic timing and is a delight to watch in this movie.  She could easily give Jennifer Aniston and Meg Ryan a run for their money in the rom-com stakes.  I would love to see her in more movies like this in the future.  The only reason why I didn't give this movie a full five stars is because I think there could have been more focus on the mother's relationship with her two daughters, and also the sisters relationship.  It was like their problems were briefly mentioned at the beginning, and then all resolved by the end of the movie.  Apart from that one flaw, I love this movie and would definitely watch it again and again :-)",1374364800,2,1742,4.517571884984026

8060472,5,B0009GX1D8,"Ticks all the boxes for a great romantic comedy. Nice little twists and turns throughout. Eddie McClintock was great in this. So thankful it got a decent dvd release.

This film is also known as Confessions of a Young Bride.",1184976000,,224,4.6
8060473,3,B0009GX1D8,"""Confessions of an American Bride"" is not a dvd I would buy, but it is the kind of movie you probably won't regret renting, if you know what you are getting into.

The main character is Samantha (Shannon Elizabeth), a young woman about to get married to Ben (Eddie McClintock), the man of her dreams. But as the ""Big day"" approaches, wedding arrangements (cake, flowers, guests...) turn into big problems, and Sam and Ben realize their tastes are more different that they previously thought. Things get even more complicated when Luke (Geoff Stults), the man Sam had a crush on during university, starts to work with her and ends up admitting to having a crush on her. What will Sam do? And who is really the man of her dreams?

""Confessions of an American Bride"" is not an excellent movie, but it isn't an awful one either. From my point of view, this is one of those films made specially for women, that most women will find entertaining, and most men hate. Now, whether to rent it or not is your call...

PS: If you want an outstandingly good  ""chick movie""  that both women and men will love, give ""Bridget Jones' diary"" a try  :)",1169510400,3,1147,4.51207729468599
8060474,3,B0009GX1D8,This is a fun movie. It is movie good to spend spare time but not one that you have to see. Only for fun not a trscendental movie.,1168300800,,130,3.6785714285714284
8060475,3,B0009GX1D8,"I did not know what to expect when I bought this movie.  But I really enjoyed it.

Elizabeth Shannon shines in her role as Sam.  I must admit I never really liked her in the American Pie movies, but this movie has really changed my opinion of her.

A cute movie that anyone who enjoys a wedding and everything that comes along with it.",1151452800,5,335,4.1875
8060476,5,B0009GX1D8,"First off, if you've ever had doubts about a current relationship, this movie is for you.  I just got done watching it with a fine bottle of muscato wine.  I must say this movie has exemplified almost all of my feelings I have when I'm in a serious relationship.  What if there is someone else out there?  What if I never sleep with another man again? What if the relationship does a complete 180?  What if the man of my current dreams isn't what he seems?  I felt that almost all of these issues were brought into perspective in this movie.  The man she meets seems too good to be true, her crush from a previous life comes back to bring all of her feelings and or fears (any normal person's fears anyway) into the forefront less than 6 months before her wedding day!  The movie is comically laid out, little tidbits that break into the movie of her in a perfectly pristine environment in all white explaining her doubts, fears and all of her desperate wantings which is good, it is as if you're brought into her mind after hitting a pause button as she narrates.  I fully recommend this movie to any woman or man who has any doubts about the person they're currently seeing or are fully serious about and have doubts.  Total girl movie night/sleepover flick.  Light-hearted with a lot of ""oh no, oh no, oh no, don't do that"" moments to keep the fun rolling along.  This is officially my first review of any movie an amazon and I hope it is helpful.",1120867200,40,1450,4.369402985074627
