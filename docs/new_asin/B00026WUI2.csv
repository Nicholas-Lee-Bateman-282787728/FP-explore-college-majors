2064264,4,B00026WUI2,"My 2-1/2 year old was unimpressed with this at first, but ""got"" the concept after a couple of viewings and now asks for it every day.  He was so excited when we got to actual Halloween this year, because he understood the concept of costumes and jack-o-lanterns.  The songs aren't as catchy as the ones on most Sesame Street videos, but the segments with the real children really keep his attention and Caroline Rhea's mugging makes him giggle.",1099526400,7,444,4.67948717948718
2064265,5,B00026WUI2,"Our daughter, who just turned two in August, absolutely loves Sesame Street.  When we bought her this movie we hoped it would keep her as involved and interested as the TV show and it has far exceeded our hopes.  She has watched it over and over since the beginning of October, (along with her 9 year-old sister and 10 year-old brother if you can believe that!) and she now not only sings some of the silly songs, but says some of the lines with the characters, too!

It is very informative and yet it keeps her attention.  Every time she sees the part about the apples and the cider mill, she asks for an apple to eat!

I am now in the hunt for the perfect Sesame Street holiday show, (maybe Elmo's World Happy Holidays?), so that the Halloween shows can be hidden away until next year.",1099267200,11,787,4.326530612244898
2064266,3,B00026WUI2,"My son loves Sesame Street and has since he was a year old. He's not Elmo-crazed but he does love Elmo along with Cookie Monster (his favorite), Ernie, the Count and Baby Bear. I was trying to stay away from Elmo says BOO! because I bought him Elmo Saves Christmas last year and he won't watch it all the way through (I think it's too much elmo and not enough of the other guys) wich is why I picked this Halloween DVD. It's got more characters in it. This DVD is basically about the rituals of Halloween and what people do on the holiday for example it's got a trip to an apple cider factory to show how they make apple cider.

The movie's educational and I, personally, like it but I think it's more for a 4+ child, not toddlers. If your child is 4yrs or older then I think it'll be an excellent choice.

We've got It's The Great Pumpkin Charlie brown wich he loves & The Nightmare Before Christmas (or what he calls ""JACK"") wich he loves but I wouldn't recommend for toddlers. I guess we'll try Elmo says BOO! Wish us luck and Happy Halloween! :)",1097366400,12,1049,4.24

2064282,5,B00026WUI2,My daughter loves this.  Hard to find child appropriate Halloween shows that are not scary at all.,1417305600,,98,4.764705882352941
2064283,2,B00026WUI2,"We LOVE Sesame Street but this is not a fun program.  It talks about ""monsters"" and such and seems disjointed a bit.",1414886400,,116,4.2727272727272725
2064284,3,B00026WUI2,Great show but poor video quality,1414713600,,33,4.666666666666667
2064285,5,B00026WUI2,"This was a really cute sesame st halloween movie. It's not old looking - more up to date then the very outdated Elmo says boo (the one with Elmo n the count on the cover of DVD)
Worth the money ! Sweet n not scary for kids!",1413244800,2,223,3.765957446808511
2064286,2,B00026WUI2,"My son was a huge fan of the Count so we bought many different Sesame Street videos. The storyline was lame, and we gave away the video almost immediately. There are other Sesame Street videos that are worth the money, but this is not one of them.",1406592000,,247,4.276595744680851
2064287,5,B00026WUI2,"I was afraid it might confuse my Grandson with costumes on Sesame Street characters.  He loved it.  My daugter-in-law has a group of what is called PEPS in Seattle with a group of Moms with children that are the same ages, now two and a half,  that meet weekly at different homes/libraries/ parks etc. to support and navigate young motherhood.  This was an incredible hit.  While Moms had lunch in her dining room, the little ones LOVED this in the den.  A must have. Was played about 30 times over Halloween.  Know a long way off as Christmas approaching and just delighted I found the original Sesame Street Christmas Story with Bert, Ernie and Mr. Hooper!",1383955200,,658,4.620689655172414
2064288,5,B00026WUI2,My twin grand daughters love Sesame Street - anything Sesame Street - and they have quite a collection.  I was very happy they did not have this one and come to find out it quickly became their favorite.  They wanted to watch it over and over again to the chagrin of my daughter-in-law.  She cannot get them to watch any other.  Definitely worth the price.,1349740800,,356,4.430769230769231
2064289,5,B00026WUI2,"The animation/computer graphics are very sharp and beautiful in this video and it is very colorful.  It catches my 3 year old's attention well.  He loves Halloween and ""spooky"" stuff, so he loves this video.  It's not one of his all time favorites that he watches over and over, but he does enjoy it.  I would recommend it highly.  Great for a Halloween-time gift!",1314403200,2,364,4.625
2064290,4,B00026WUI2,This is a great Sesame St. show! My kids like the ones where there is an actual storyline as opposed to the show itself that goes from skit to skit. This one is very cute and they watch it year round.,1264291200,,200,3.902439024390244
2064291,2,B00026WUI2,"I wasn't impressed with this dvd at all. My daughter is an Elmo freak, but even she barely paid any attention to it.",1260230400,,116,4.086956521739131
2064292,5,B00026WUI2,"As another reviewer said, every time my children watch this movie and the part about apples and the cider mill they ask for an apple to eat! That is suggestive advertising at its best! (:

Elmo, Zoe and Telly are wondering what can they do on a crisp autumn day. And Mumford the Magician sure delivers!

This isn't all about Elmo, or even Sesame Street. Takes viewers via hayride to a orchard, a farm at harvest time,a pumpkin patch with pumpkin carving and various halloween parties. A great tool to teach toddlers and kids about fall activities.

My kids would request, sit and watch non-stop from around 18 months... and at 8 are still sitting down to watch it.

And the best part is 100+ views I can still enjoy parts myself.",1251072000,2,729,4.5
2064293,4,B00026WUI2,I haven't seen the quality of the video.  I hope it's to my satisfaction.,1247875200,,73,4.214285714285714
2064294,5,B00026WUI2,"This is a cute dvd and talks about how monsters don't have to be scary which is great. Has clips of costume ideas, pumpkin carving, hayride and apple farm. Have had it since my daughter was 2 and we still watch it yr. round 3 yrs. later.",1227657600,,237,4.0638297872340425
2064295,5,B00026WUI2,"My 2 yo is a sesame street fanatic, so this dvd was a no-brainer, but my 18 mos-old nephew loves it too and he does not like to sit still for many shows.

The nice thing about this dvd as opposed to Elmo Says Boo (which is also great) is that it is an hour long as opposed to 1/2 hr.",1226966400,,283,3.639344262295082
2064296,5,B00026WUI2,This is the first DVD my 18 month old insisted I play over and over! The songs are catchy and fun. I really enjoyed this DVD as well. Really great SS episode. Catherine Rhea is great as the main character.,1201305600,,205,4.15

8023004,5,B00026WUI2,Very cute movie. All of my 2 year old's favorite Sesame St. Characters mixed together with a fun Halloween themed movie. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the show.,1478131200,,173,4.612903225806452
8023005,2,B00026WUI2,"Not one of the best sesame Street dvds. It was just ok, caroline rhea is not that great of an actress and the storyline was just kind of blah. It really didn't hold my sons attentikn for long. It's definitely at the bottom of the movie pile.",1477353600,,241,4.148936170212766

8023007,5,B00026WUI2,This is a good show for ages 1-1.5 years old as my daughter was that age when she was watching it. She enjoyed it however she was looking for abby cadabby. Since she is a newer character she is not in this show (just so parents whose children love abby cadabby).,1462060800,,262,4.1568627450980395
