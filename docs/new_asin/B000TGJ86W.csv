8209043,2,B000TGJ86W,Just not what I was hoping for or expecting.  skating was only okay and theme was different - many countries of origin represented -  would have thought it would have had a lot more American songs for Christmas !,1491264000,,212,4.410256410256411
8209044,5,B000TGJ86W,Just as described! Good deal being brand new.  Christmas gift for my 13 year old daughter whom takes figure skating lessons. She watched/enjoyed right away. Bought another for cousin. Personalized gift that doesn't break the bank. Thanks!!,1453939200,,239,5.45945945945946

8209047,5,B000TGJ86W,"I got this Video from the Library and I watched it a million times.  The routines are action packed, and very exciting.  One of the skaters even sings live in German as he is skating.  Definitely worth watching, and it features songs and routines that are based on holiday celebrations from around the world.",1323820800,2,308,4.666666666666667
8209048,5,B000TGJ86W,I gave this to my mother in law for Christmas who loves ice skating. Came in quickly and put a smile on her face.,1263340800,,113,3.75
8209049,1,B000TGJ86W,"On the strength of Nancy Kerrigan's name, we bought this item. But unfortunately she doesn't skate. As MC of the show, she is not dynamic. She reads her text.

While the skaters are good, their material is not interesting. By and large, the show features routine skating.

The music purports to be holiday music, but actually is a hodge-podge of rock-arranged nondescript themes.

Only good moment in the show features a tango.",1193097600,19,427,4.902777777777778
