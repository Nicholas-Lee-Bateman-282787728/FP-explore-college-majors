6402775,5,B00K36AGQY,Jason Franklin's information is extremely helpful when navigating your high schools students options for college. I am certain that because we followed Jason's advise we are paying far less for college.,1431648000,,202,5.548387096774194
6402776,5,B00K36AGQY,I attended this seminar live and the information presented was much more than I anticipated!!! The college admissions process has changed so much from 20 years ago and this is a MUST for parents of children that are college bound. You won't be sorry you bought this!!! Worth EVERY penny!!,1431648000,,288,4.78
6402777,4,B00K36AGQY,"Mr. Franklin's seminar on preparing for college is a quick and informative way to begin the college search process. A lot of the information is based on students' actual experiences (he teaches ACT prep courses) and gave us lots of excellent ideas to begin the process of finding the right college for our child.
We have since learned that every student's situation is completely unique so what worked for one student is not necessarily going to work for everyone - so this cannot be the end-all guide to college admissions - just a starting point.",1431648000,,548,4.778947368421052
6402778,5,B00K36AGQY,"I went to this seminar live and it was extremely helpful.  The flow of the seminar works really well to help you get prepared for junior year and beyond.  I recommend looking at this prior to or early into junior year, but honestly this will be great information even if you get started on the college search later than that.",1431648000,,325,4.4
8655643,5,B00K36AGQY,"We took Jason's seminar the spring of our daughter's sophomore year.  After using his advice the last 12 months as we have started to go through the college choice and admission process, I can honestly say it's worth every penny (and then some).  We have found that you can't always rely on high school guidance counsellors, and if you don't know who to talk to or what questions to ask, you are wasting a lot of time and possible costing yourself (and your child) a lot of money.  His timelines are priceless to have. He takes so much of the guesswork out of an already head spinning process.",1432166400,,593,4.472222222222222
8655644,5,B00K36AGQY,This is a must read for students and parents as they prepare to make one of the most important decisions in their lives. I also attended Jason's seminar that corresponds with this book.  BOTH ARE EXCELLENT!,1432080000,,206,4.722222222222222
8655645,5,B00K36AGQY,"I attended Jason's live seminar this past weekend.  I found the information very valuable and the presentation engaging.  This DVD is a taped version of one of his seminar presentations.  My daughter (finishing her junior year now) was unable to attend, but she has already viewed the DVD we received and has started reading the companion book as well (with no prompting from me!).  We loved the tips and suggested timeline.  Based on Jason's advice we are already taking action to put my daughter in a better position to get accepted by her school of choice, earn maximum academic scholarships, and increase the odds of completing a 4 year degree...in 4 years!",1431993600,,661,4.866071428571429
8655646,5,B00K36AGQY,"I first watched College Bound when my daughter was a sophomore. It was a great time to start learning the ins and outs of college admission. More importantly how to look for scholarships and how to route the most affordable way to send your kids to college. I have revisited the video knowing I was at a different point in our journey. I took away yet more information than before. This book has tips from what to look for in a recommendation letter, to getting the most from your high school course work, to graduating from college in 4 years or less. I am very thankful that we have had the privilege of learning from his years of research. The price of this video and book are a fraction of the savings I will gain from his wisdom and advice. Thank you Jason Franklin!",1431907200,,771,4.361111111111111
8655647,5,B00K36AGQY,"I attended Jason's live seminar with my daughter last weekend.  It is the end of her Soph. year.  I learned a incredible amount about the ins and outs of college admission today.  I never heard any of this from our school's guidance councilor in his informational meetings for college bound parents.  This is especially geared for parents of students competing for merit based scholarships, but his common sense information would help any college applicant.  He also talks to the students themselves, explaining the realities of college costs, the cost of not graduating in four years, and the cost of not pushing for your very best GPA and ACT score.  The difference between B plus and A minus can be thousands of dollars in merit scholarships.  My daughter learned this in her older brother's experience with college applications, and if we had known earlier, he very well may have made that extra effort for the higher GPA.  This is all common sense, but because you don't know what you don't know, and can't ask questions you've never thought of, Jason provides the background you need to be a savvy shopper when it comes to college costs!!!  Absolutely worth the cost, return on the cost of the book can be HUGE!!",1431907200,,1218,4.7894736842105265
8655648,5,B00K36AGQY,"Extraordinarily practical information for any student preparing for college!  Parents, this material could help save you THOUSANDS of dollars on your child's education! My wife, son, and I attended Jason's seminar about a year ago (when our son was finishing his sophomore year of high school); we were floored by how much things have changed over the past few decades as it relates to paying for college. Jason's book, CDs, and DVD will offer you tremendous insights in navigating this new world of higher education. Thank you Jason for sharing your highly practical experience, research, and wisdom with families across our country; you are a blessing!",1431820800,,654,5.169811320754717
8655649,5,B00K36AGQY,"This information is definitely a must read for parents of college bound kids. We took his live seminar and it was worth the time and money. He gives clear, basic steps to take to help get your child into college and for you to pay as little as possible! He was entertaining and made it easy for us to go home and review what we needed with a DVD. Highly recommended and remember it is never too early to start preparing.",1431820800,,420,4.197530864197531
8655650,4,B00K36AGQY,"We attended Jason's class in December. It was very informative. The cost of college and the admissions process has changed a lot  over the years. This book will help you through the process and provide valuable information on managing costs.

8655651,5,B00K36AGQY,"Jason Franklin has changed my life. Prior to taking his class, I had no clue what the college admissions process was going to be like. Jason's presentation was well prepared, informative, organized, and easy to follow. He covered topics like admissions essays, financial aid, college visits and more.

Furthermore, Jason answers questions after the class and even via email in the event the seminar does not answer your question.",1431734400,,429,5.217391304347826
8655652,5,B00K36AGQY,"I attended a similar seminar in December of 2014 and have since watched this video several more times.  This is an opportunity to learn from Jason, but also from the thousands of students he was worked with in the past.  He gives many real life examples of how to save money and how to pick a college.  The 3 hours seminar goes very quickly because it is so full of information.  I have loaned my CD to several others and they have had great feedback as well.  This is definitely information that all college bound parents need to know!",1431734400,,536,4.373737373737374
