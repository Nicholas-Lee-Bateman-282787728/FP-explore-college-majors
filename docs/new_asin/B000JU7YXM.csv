8222470,1,B000JU7YXM,Good to know Gary Popkin is such a positive guy - all his reviews are 5 stars. And all for Hardfire programmes; that must be one great programme. Who produces Hardfire? Gary Popkin! Fancy that.,1198368000,4,193,4.542857142857143
8222471,1,B000JU7YXM,"I was disappointed with this DVD.It appears to me that Les Jamison is being used by the powers that be to discredit the 911 ""Truth Movement""(You know, a clueless conspiracy nut?) He comes across as weak and confused (Often looking like a deer caught in the headlights?) I thought Wieck made him look like a fool in the interview (Even though I agree with what he was saying! I just thought he did a terrible job of arguing his points; he seemed unprepared!). Also, there's nothing new in this DVD, they're just using footage from 'Loose Change'... Would like to have my money back!",1174262400,3,581,4.596153846153846
8222472,5,B000JU7YXM,"These two TV programs are unusual interviews of one of the major 9/11 conspiracy theorists, in that the needed homework on the matter was done in advance. The main belief of the conspiracy theorists is that every structural engineer, most of the major media outlets, the FAA, the EPA, the FBI, the CIA, the Secret Service, both major political parties, the multitude of the nations' SWAT teams, the multitude of the nations' police services, the multitude of the nations' firefighters, the army, and many others were behind those events. But since that idea is presented in MTV-style videos such as Loose Change, many people buy into it without a second thought, and people such as Les Jamison gain credibility because of it.

For the interviewer to know what the other side of the pictured WTC building looked like, the name of another building that was damaged, what skills were needed to steer a plane, and other details to counter the ""proof"" was a welcome change to what some of the other interviewers have done. These programs are an informed interview with the disinformed, instead of contributing to their cause.",1162684800,5,1120,4.925925925925926
