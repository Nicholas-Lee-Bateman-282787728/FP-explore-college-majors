8389501,1,B00365FEES,"This was a big disappointment.  I ordered it for the second feature (Long Long Ago with Tommy Rettig) and it was an edited version of the original.  The first feature (Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde) was funny (I didn't know it was a silent movie), but not good either.  Wish I hadn't bought it.  Too much money for what I got.",1383177600,,319,4.180327868852459
8389502,5,B00365FEES,"I saw ""Long, Long Ago"" on television when I was 7 and it has haunted me ever since.
Even hearing the song brought back the terror of that less-than-half an hour TV offering
and if you enjoy ""old dark house"" dramas or just plain like having holy heck scared out of you, this will be right up your alley.

Money well spent, say I!",1323734400,,328,4.125
