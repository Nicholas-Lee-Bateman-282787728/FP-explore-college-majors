6487579,4,B00LHK21PO,"My only problem is that it's not the complete collection, for some unknown reason it does not include the Frank Sinatra Roast, I had to order it separately. It is a very good set but should of been called The Complete Collection except The Frank Sinatra Roast",1416700800,29,259,4.531914893617022

ded?",1416441600,9,72,4.615384615384615
6487581,3,B00LHK21PO,"This box set is advertised as having all 54 Dean Martin celebrity roasts.  It doesn't.  It contains 53, and the one that is missing is of Frank Sinatra.  Aside from the obvious problem of not receiving what was advertised and what I paid for, it is disappointing that my favorite roast was excluded, and for what reason I do not know.  I definitely feel cheated and would not recommend purchasing this.

Update 11/5/2014:  Just to clarify, the DVD box states that this set contains 53 roasts, which is accurate.  The problem is with Amazon's listing which states it contains the complete set of 54 roasts.  I have no proof, but my suspicion is that TimeLife produced these sets in error.  TimeLife claims that the sets they are selling on their web site contain all 54.",1414281600,42,769,4.637037037037037

6487583,2,B00LHK21PO,53 Roasts and still no Sinatra! This is NOT a complete collection. You need to get the collection that has 54 roasts to get Frank Sinatra. $100 and no Sinatra or $200 to get 54 roasts with Sinatra. You decide!,1497484800,,209,4.25

6487592,5,B00LHK21PO,"Beautifully presented in a box. Box contains a book and the dvd's are individually wrapped. My family has always enjoyed the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts and his Variety show.
Good clean laughs from great performers.",1483660800,,216,5.2
6487593,5,B00LHK21PO,"I have seen plenty of complaints about this collection from MANY. It IS missing the
FRANK SINATRA Roast----which is on the new $250 collection----and many of the,
individual----thirty-three, or less, DVDs----new and used DVD/VHS-video cassettes.
The, lone, Frank Sinatra tape costs 72 [separately]. The DVD is around $40.
I'm buying THIS, particular, ""DELUXE COLLECTION"" since I already have 33 of
the [olden] Time/Life DVD discs that were sold through subscriptions back in the
old days when I was young (I'm a '68 High School graduate and will BE 68 soon).
So, I'll add my Frank Sinatra Roast to THIS, and HAVE a complete 54 roast set. I
will have a lot L=E=S=S DVDs, and a lot MORE shelf-space. Those 33 DVDs were
a pain-in-the-butt: A few roasts were repeated on the discs---the first 25 roasts were
segments on The Dean Martin Shows, and were not as long as the last 29 longer-
length shows that were actually filmed in Las Vegas.
I'll attach a circa 1974; 1984; and, recent pic.... get ya in the mood to see a lot of the
old/dead/aging folks in the videos!
A lot of these broadcast episodes LOOK edited. They were. Broadcast THAT way, on
occasion, some roasters were on-a-roll and went longer than others. Look close! Often,
a roaster/toaster skipped due to time... or, maybe their material just sucked. In any case,
the entire series of 54 roasts are highly recommended... whether a 15-minute segment,
or long one...",1482969600,2,1423,4.836065573770492

6487613,5,B00LHK21PO,"Perhaps the finest collection of roasts of it's type. Many many comedians from the golden age of television, people who have perfected their craft the hard way by practicing and failing or succeeding in front of live audiences, with no laugh track or audience warmup coaches.  This rarely descends into obscenity, all too often the humor-crutch of today's Comedy Channel roasts, and exceeds the Friar's Club roasts no longer broadcast. For older folks who saw many of these people in shows, or for younger folks who want to see masters at work, this is an awesome collection.  Bear in mind that these were originally on network broadcast TV, so they won't be full hours as there are no commercials.

You'll have to buy the  Frank Sinatra roast. For some reason, that's not in this,",1447718400,9,781,4.8059701492537314

Not worth the $ 150. Disappointing . Do not order if you are expecting complete hour long roast. Good for someone who just wants to see clips.
