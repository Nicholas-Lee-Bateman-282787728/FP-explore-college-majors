2712320,5,B000LPS4JI,"This 2004 film is not for the light-hearted, as it deals with the horrific atrocities happened through the last ten years with two different groups of people in Africa.  And more recently, there was a brutal slaughter of people one night.  The two groups in the African country the Nayak and the Bonands, will come together one night for a celebration of peace, and we follow the activities in preparation for the celebration, anticipating peace after a decade.

Forgiveness
The wife of the President of the Nayak national army, Edna is not forgiving person, haunted by the knowledge that her young son was horrifically murdered by cutting off his testicles and stuffing them in his mouth.  She feels her dead son is not at rest until his death is avenged. Will she, and can she forgive as she confronts the man who begs her forgiveness that he horrifically murdered her son?

The film is tense, and you cannot help but watch the entire length, as the events unfold, seeing a mother haunted.  Most of the character actors are nonprofessionals,  but the acting by lead character, Edna is compelling as she is memorable and moving!

In an interview with the Executive Director of the Tribeca Film Festival, Fanta Regina Nacro, film's director said she was inspired by reports of the atrocities of the Yugoslavian war and how today, we take pleasure with watching humans suffer.  She said in humans, there is a part that is animal and a part that is human, good and bad, and which part dominates.

This story has one truth, in real life, Director Nacro's uncle was killed in a brutal manner the same way the film depicts.  It remained haunting to her.  She said that during showings through the world, people forgot it was about Africa, but relayed it to their countries, their atrocities, brutalities, and cruelities in their own wars; and that atrocities are universal, not defined to black skin color.

Global Film Initiative provides film from around the world, that educates and exposes the viewer to the different global cultures, through cinema.  The Board is made up of filmmakers, promoters, producers, etc.  Generally with each film, you can insert the disc into your computer for discussion on the film, but often, it has not worked for me.

A most memorable film ......Rizzo",1291248000,4,2283,4.845360824742268

""The Night of the Truth"" (La nuit de la vrit) is a fictional story of two ethnic groups who are sawing the seeds of reconciliation after a ten year civil war. But it could very well be the real story of Rwanda, Burundi, Sierra Leone or Liberia. Possibly conceived for an African audience by the rising African director Fanta Rgina Nacro, the message behind the movie is simple and considerate: an African solution for an Africa problem is what can and will work best for the African people.

The storyline is simple. The movie starts at dawn the day in which a reconciliation pact will be signed between two fictional ethnic groups the Bonand and the Nayak. The camera acts as a silent intruder in the lives of the two main actors and orchestrators of the war: the Nayak president (Adama Oudraougo) and the Bonand rebel leader, Colonel Theo (Commandant Moussa Ciss). They are anxious about the day that just begun and feel that they walked a long path to see this day coming. Unlike the usual movies about war, the wives of the two warriors play a significant role in the peace process. Soumari, Theo's wife makes careful arrangements so that nothing goes wrong during the day. She organizes everything in detail and makes sure that any sensitive issue is dealt with accordingly. At the other end, Edna, the president's wife is still bitter about the untimely, tragic, and brutal death of her son. While thinking that she can talk to him, her only goal is to seek revenge for her son's death. At all cost.

There are compelling signs of tragedy and misery in the rebel's camp. Children compare their lost limbs. Bloody graffiti are on display on every block. Young soldiers talk about their violent victories and about the enemies. In brief, the reconciliation seems a dream that's fading away. Ms. Nacro however then shifts focus on the two opponent leaders possibly in a quest to show that great leaders are the only ones that can bring peace and prosperity to their countries. During the reconciliation night both man, the president and the general, speak wisely and make sure their soldiers behave the way they should at all times.

When everything seems to work according to the plan, a tragedy befalls over both groups. If they can survive this tragedy, the ""tribes"" will no longer exist as separate entities and re-become one people, with one common ideal and dream. Watch the movie to see what solution Ms. Nacro has prepared for you.

Why watch the movie?

Despite my love for East Africa I never imagined how a reconciliation process will go through. With the exception of Congo and Sudan, I went to the other countries in the aftermath of war. This movie fills in some gaps in my understanding of war and peace and the complexities and contradictions a reconciliation period brings along. It is a complex and progressive story about that process of achieving peace. It is inspiring, considerate and somewhat unexpected. A great debut for director Fanta Rgina Nacro. And a wonderful story to be told.

I give the movie 10/10

There is hope at the end of the night seems to be the inherent lesson one takes out of this movie and I happen to completely agree with it.

2712322,5,B000LPS4JI,"I was actually surprised by how much I liked this film, but I have to say it's one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. Everything about it is stellar - the way the characters are first introduced, one by one; the way the story unfolds, slowly gaining momentum; the beautiful dialog... Seriously, this is what filmmaking SHOULD be.

There's definitely a theatrical quality about the story telling that is very Brechtian... so the audience is always kept one step away from really getting involved with the story... and I could see that being a turn-off for some people. But, as a cautionary tale/examination of the human spirit, I've never seen anything half as good.",1235174400,,678,4.697478991596639
2712323,4,B000LPS4JI,"The Night of Truth DVD exemplifies the tragic aftermath of African civil wars on its people. Memories and recollections of the unjustified killings,amputations,mutilation and other horrors of the war can be an exceedingly difficult and painful challenge for both opponents after the war when peace,forgiveness and reconciliation become the issue to tackle which is absolutely necessary for the rehabilitation,stabilization and reconstruction of their country. This recollection of atrocities committed is an extremely difficult challenge particularly to those who lost their loved ones during the conflict,let alone when they find themselves face to face with the perpetrators of the ghastly deed committed on their friends or family. Forgive or not forgive, forgive and forget,forgive but not forget,etc,in a variety of ""flavors"" affront the victims of the war. The French language with English subtitles just makes this movie more authentic,more interesting and more true-to-life. That is how we know Africa with its French,English,Portuguese,Arabic languages depending on the regions portrayed. I highly recommend this DVD who are interested in gaining more knowledge of how African civil wars affect its people.",1217203200,6,1215,5.870056497175141

8163436,4,B000LPS4JI,"This was a well done movie that captured the inherent difficulty and suffering of a civil war.  When a war is between two different countries, at the end of it, if one does not conquer the other, fighters from each side do not have to forgive.  Their decedents can forgive, but the rage in the actual combatants hearts is not inflamed by day to day interactions with their former enemies.  When a war is between  peoples within the same country, when it ends they must find ways to live with the people who killed their loved ones.  This movie tackles that difficult transition.  While I do think it is well done, the description says, ""this bold and ultimately uplifting film.""  Respectfully, I disagree.  The message of the film is one of peace, but the atrocities are dark enough that any uplifting message is muted.",1466553600,2,819,4.638888888888889
8163437,5,B000LPS4JI,"Two sides with mutual hatred decided enough is enough and peace given a chance.
The acting is superb and the plot engaging. I was hoping that the drama unfolds as the two parties forces each other to feel their pain and suffering as a result of the other atrocities. The President vs the commandant, the wives at each other. But the plot twist was worth it and a bitter sweet ending. This is what movies should be about- explores the ills and consequences of ethnic hatred and offers a solution, at least. This is a movie to see for those hurting for reconciliation.",1463184000,,566,4.504854368932039
