If you don't know why people are Cubs' fans after all the years of losing teams, you will understand after watching this.  It leaves you wondering whether to feel sorry for their fans or to envy them for their faith in the impossible.

Super fun viewing!",1347753600,,392,4.402777777777778

I was in for a delightful surprise, the film is so well done with a mix of Cubs players and celebrity fans. Plenty of great shots of the city and how it ties in with the Cubs and Wrigley Field.
It makes you long for the days of summer and a day game at Wrigley!
The film also had lots of extras such as the Ernie Banks statue dedication, profile of Kerry Wood, the 1908 Cubs and more.
Don't hesitate to buy it! GO CUBS GO! GO CUBS GO! HEY CHICAGO WHAT DO YOU SAY, THE CUBS ARE GOING TO WIN TODAY!",1390780800,6,595,3.8852459016393444
