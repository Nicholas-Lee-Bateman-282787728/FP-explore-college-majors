8537224,4,B00979KPWS,"Great collection of 80's movies. ""Back to School"" looks like I'm watching 240 DVD NOT 1080 Blu-Ray. ""City Slickers"" looks like I AM watching 720 Blu-Ray. ""My Cousin Vinny"" looks like I AM watching 720 Blu-Ray. The listing on Amazon says 1 disc NOT 3. I strongly believe that movies like this don't need to be 1080 resolution to be enjoyed. I also know that every single movie in this collection could easily fit on a single Blu-Ray disc at its CURRENT resolution. I paid extra to get ONE DISC NOT THREE. To me the whole purpose behind Blu-Ray is better options and for me taking LESS space on my shelf AND/OR better picture BUT in this case I have NEITHER for MORE MONEY!",1418342400,,671,4.419354838709677
