8580265,5,B00CCF7TUU,"Released in Finland as `Puhdistus', this is an adaptation of the award winning book by Sofi Oksanen. It is about a young girl who is trafficked in modern day Estonia by some low life types to be a sex slave. She manages to escape and finds herself in a remote village settlement where a wary but kindly enough old woman takes her in. It soon becomes clear that there is a familial link between the two women.  The old woman Aliide, then takes us back to the bleak days of World War 2 where her story begins and when Estonia was invaded by the Soviet Union and they never left.

What they did in occupied territories is now a matter of record. Aliide and her sister both fell for the same man; he on the other hand only fell for her sister. This did not stop her dreaming that one day he might hold her even if it was to be just once. He was a proud man and joined the resistance. The resistance of course had no chance, and the Russians went after anyone they thought was aiding their enemy. This included Aliide and her family. We get to see the full tragedy of her life and are brought right up to the present day and the ruthlessness of the sex traffickers is no less than what the conquering Russians did in the war.

Aliide is played by two actresses; the younger Laura Birn is excellent and has a true screen presence, That said everyone puts in amazing performances. It is filmed beautifully, with the shots so well framed that you take it for granted until you take a step back. One of the things I found most interesting is the constant refrain from the Estonians of `The West will come'; in that they feel `The West' will not have forgotten them. They sadly had no idea that the cold war had begun even before the fires of war had burnt themselves out.

Finland is not an over producer of films, but this from Antti Jokinen (who did `The Eurovision Song Contest' in 2007) is proof they are capable of making world class cinema. It is in Finnish with sub titles that I found to be very good and runs to just under two hours. This is a film that tells a part of history, a family's personal tragedy and has a message that is as valid today as it was seventy years ago. This is just a brilliant film and should be a must for all cinephiles and I absolutely loved it - massively recommended.",1377216000,2,2297,4.249427917620137
