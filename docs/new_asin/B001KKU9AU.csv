3666188,3,B001KKU9AU,"I'm not here to review this fine movie as this has already been done.  I'm writing more to address the issue of the picture quality of this dvd.  I truly don't understand one reviewers complaint here about the picture of this dvd being way too dark.  I just got a copy and found the quality to be outstanding, a beautiful picture, with the brightness being perfect.  No problems here, and I didn't have to make any adjustments to my tv.  I'm sure for some reason the picture was too dark for the reviewer or else he/she wouldn't have complained, but some setting or connection on their equipment must have been set differently or malfunctioned.  The picture is excellent.

Take care...

3666192,4,B001KKU9AU,"I loved this movie on the Hallmark Channel and was excited to be able to get it on DVD. But I was very disappointed to see that the DVD is not good quality, and the movie looks so much darker than it does when it's on TV. Even with our TV's brightness setting at the highest level, this DVD just looks way too dark. Very disappointing. The surprising thing is that they added scenes that were deleted in the TV version of the movie. At first, I didn't like the added scenes, because I loved the original movie so much and didn't feel that it needed to be changed in any way. I've decided now that I do like the added scenes, but I really DON'T like the fact that this DVD looks so dark.  If your TV has a brightness setting that goes higher than ours, then you may be able to take out the darkness.  As it is, I do like the movie, but I am very disappointed in the way it looks.  There's no reason that the DVD should have been made with such poor quality.",1238976000,5,956,4.0476190476190474

3666195,4,B001KKU9AU,"""Melrose Place"" bad girl, Laura Leighton is cast against type as she portrays a New York magazine editor who must leave her busy job and frantic wedding planning behind so she can spread her estranged father's ashes in her tiny New England hometown. Once there, she renews old acquaintances, develops an attraction to a handsome local attorney (portrayed by Sebastian Spence), and begins to discover father she never really knew.

This is a Hallmark Channel movie and is a bit schmaltzy, but at the same time it's a refreshing story of love and self-renewal. It's nice to see another side to Leighton for a change.

3666198,3,B001KKU9AU,"You may enjoy it, but it left me feeling a bit blah...could have been much more emotionally connecting. I thought the friendship with her bestie was lacking emotional connection as well as with the guy she chose. Also something should have been said about the elephant in the room, even as a joke from one of the characters - that she was going to marry a father like guy as a result of a daddy abandonment wound.  Pleasant watch because acting was good, characters were charming, and overall well done film. But really missed stronger plot development and could have been so much better. The character barely cried over her history and dad, and needed a therapist, not a man. Even her talks with her best friend were flat. The best part was probably the last two minutes of the film when she said more of her truth. I found the lead character to be too quiet in her emotional expression.",1472947200,,888,4.515527950310559

It would have been nice to add in a scene of forgiveness of her father because there are so many people walking around like Catherine with unforgiveness eating away at their souls. We surely need more movies and positive influences out in the entertainment industry! God (literally) knows we need it!

That being said, she found herself drawn to him because life, for him, was just the opposite and once Cate realized what her childhood had been like and her best friend ""Fi"" was so genuine and after 25 years apart it all felt like a time warp and she found that the man she was about to marry was none of the things that her heart truly desired and in the end she followed her heart.

3666330,4,B001KKU9AU,"The movie is well paced, has attractive scenes and settings and a cast that seems to fit their parts very well. The story is supposed to take place in New Kerry, Massachusetts, New York City, and back again to New Kerry. It appears it was all actually filmed in Canada and produced for the Hallmark Channel which tells you something about how it will play out.

The story starts with a flashback to the heroine as a 9 year old child being sent away by her father after the death of her mother. This is followed by a rather abrupt shift to the present when the viewer must determine that a tough-minded woman editor is that same little girl grown up. The movie is divided up into segments by sudden black screen breaks that were obviously intended to hold the original TV commercials; these are not really too disturbing but certainly reveal the origins of this made for TV movie.

The heroine, Cate, has her future all carefully planned when the unexpected arrival of a package containing her father's ashes and a request for her to scatter them back in New Kerry changes everything. The movie is about her trip back and the trials and tribulations she faces trying to fulfill her father's final request. The movie is blessed with a typical Hallmark ending which leaves the lead characters happy without bothering to fill in all of the troubling details implied by their decisions.

This is a suitable family movie and can be enjoyed by most family members including understanding husbands.",1316908800,3,1490,4.7011494252873565

Not by the predictable storyline, but by the fine acting of all the characters in it...including the dog. It was a warm, fuzzy, chick-flick, to be sure, and I was wondering why Sandra Bullock wasn't cast in the part of the ""All Work/No Play"" magazine editor Katherine instead of Laura Leighton. It seemed more like a Bullock vehicle. But that's just my opinion and I'm probably in the minority.

""Daniel's Daughter"" was a very romantic movie set in New Kerry, MA, where just about all of the locals are Irish-American and a few still speak with a brogue. You'd think Massachusetts was a suburb of Dublin the way Hollywood envisions it in just about every movie I've ever seen that was flimed there. Fortunately, H'wood managed to not ruin a nice love story.

3666341,4,B001KKU9AU,"As a girl of 9 Katharine lost her mother and, not sure how to care for her and provide for her at the same time, her father sent her to live with relatives she didn't know. He never came back for her or contacted her and she felt abandon.
Flash forward to Katharine as a high-powered editor of ""Perfect"" magazine, helping people achieve a perfect life. She is engaged to her extremely rich and successful publisher and is planning her wedding by bluetooth while simultaneously holding staff meetings. Did I mention that her publisher has children older than Katharine?
In the midst of all this a package arrives at her office. Thinking it is a wedding gift, she instructs her assistant to open it. He hands the envelope inside to her and proceeds to remove what he thinks is a music box. Katharine reads the letter and learns that the box contains her father's ashes and his last wish was to have her go to the old hometown and spread his ashes as they had her mother's and have his longtime friends and former fellow trio members sing ""Danny Boy"", as they had at her Mother's funeral.
She resents what she perceives as the selfishness of his request--to interrupt her busy life after having neglected her all these years, but the ""perfect ideals"" her magazine teaches spur her on to be the bigger person of the two and follow his wish.
Returning to the home of her childhood friend, now married with several boys of her own, she realizes this won't be as easy as she thought. Complications arise when she learns that the two men her father wanted to have sing together haven't spoken to each other in 20 years. Her fiance, who is away on business himself, has no idea where she is and expects her to be home in two days, when he returns, for an opera date with friends. She feels she can't tell him about the situation because he doesn't like to look back, and he doesn't like messy situations. And in the middle of it all she begins to enjoy the company of the town's Oxford educated, world-traveled attorney.
Lessons in forgiveness and being true to yourself are learned along the way.
There are some things about the story that just didn't add up for me, but I didn't let it detract from the fact that this is a movie with an interesting storyline, characters with which you can become involved, and nothing that you couldn't let your kids see, unless the mother dying in the beginning might disturb them. But it is handled very tastefully--just moving from a happy family scene one minute to a funeral the next with no suffering or death actually shown.  There is nothing inappropriate, even the kissing scenes are brief and tender, not overly passionate and sloppy. No foul language, either, just good, clean entertainment.
Also, when I first reviewed this movie I had only seen a videotaped copy, so I couldn't comment on the picture quality from the disc. Having received it for Christmas, I can now say that we did not notice that the picture seemed dark, as has been mentioned elsewhere.",1254441600,40,2997,4.5914179104477615

The movie is packed with very high quality actors and actresses (they could not have picked more perfect actors/actresses for the parts).  Also, each person sees a movie with a different slant.  For me, the story was based on the evolving truth of seeing others through your heart and not through the wallet.",1500854400,,563,4.77319587628866
8315164,3,B001KKU9AU,"This is a very predictable movie, about a woman supposedly 28 but Laura Leighton looks about ten years older than that, who is a successful magazine celebrity editor, she's about to marry an at least one generation older tycoon, who really talks down to her like he's the boss and she's an underling.  One day she gets a crate in the mail, you're thinking gees that would weigh a lot more than the cardboard box norm, and cost a bit to post.  We find out someone (we never find out who) has shipped her father's ashes to her. Also inside is a note from her deceased dad, that he wants her to go back to a small rural Massachusetts island town they left when she was eight, where her mother is buried, and scatter his ashes next to her while his two best friends from those days sing Danny Boy. She hasn't seen her dad since they left that town (the movie never explains why) and has resented him for the past 20 years.  She sees his final wishes as selfish, interrupting her  busy successful life, but (and this makes very little sense) her magazine cover slogans do not gel with simply returning the ashes to sender or posting them to the town and paying someone else to scatter them.  So she gets on a plane from New York, then a boat to the island town.  For some reason (again not explained, as he doesn't help her to arrange the scattering or to get the old guys to sing) she takes her personal assistant, a snobby posh man with her.

Some setting up the plot of the movie spoilers - Upon arriving at the island with a ridiculous amount of luggage for just an night or two, the two ask for directions from a couple to her former childhood besties house.  The guy acts like a jerk while giving them. Arriving at the former bestie's house she sees the woman has settled for an average looking dude, isn't well off, has let herself go a bit and has a couple of male children. The interior of the house definitely doesn't meet her personal assistant's taste, who can't leave the place until he has fixed his room and hers as it's even worse.  So after asking her former bestie where the two old guys she needs to sing are these days, she goes to the local pubs to talk to them. Now who catches up with someone they haven't seen for 20 years and doesn't go into town with them on their first night there, even if you weren't best friends?  Well the supposed bestie that's who, in fact she could well have just been a landlord at a Bed and Breakfast for the unbelievably small amount of time these two spend together. In fact I wondered how she ended up staying there in the first place, if she hadn't remained in contact. At the pubs though, you guessed it the jerk happens to be there, turns out his female companion is a huge fan, and that she's actually his wingman, not his girlfriend and he's sorry for the way he acted earlier, can he show her around the town.  Now remember she's supposedly about to get married, not to mention you'd think she'd want to hang out with her childhood friend, but no she hangs out with the guy who clearly wants to get into her pants. He ""runs into her"" again the next day and you can see where this is going.  Meanwhile the old guys refuse to sing at her father's service (who neither knew was dead, even though again they are supposedly his best friends), because they haven't liked the other one for the past twenty years.

For me this movie was watchable, much of the watchability due to the fact Laura Leighton (Sydney from Melrose Place) still looks smoking hot after all these years (the movie first aired on TV in 2008).  But other than being ridiculously predictable, just had too much stuff that made no sense to rate it any higher.  The severe lack of wanting to spend time with someone you obviously agreed on the spot to stay with you by a woman who has kept crap from their childhood as keepsakes of the time she had a close best friend just made no sense. The old guys feud, surely if the deceased was your best friend and her daughter turns up, you'd suck it up and get on with his simple wish out of respect to both of them.  The (spoiler) fact she's supposed to learn her father did love her, cared about her and wasn't a bad guy.  Sorry but he was, even if you're in prison or a fugitive you can at least write to her or call on the phone, even e-mail or Facebook in the second ten years she never heard from him, anything other excuse for his absence he can visit her.  They needed to give a reason, he seemed to love her when she was a kid, it made no sense he never saw her again.  Maybe if he'd simply disappeared and they found his body and he'd been dead for twenty years and wrote the note while trapped in a cave in or something that might have made sense.

Also why couldn't she tell her fiance she was going to spread her dad's ashes?  Spoilers - He hardly gets upset when he learns she's messing around with another dude, it's unlikely he would have over saying goodbye to her dad. That lack of emotion when he walks in on the two of them in his office wasn't plausible at all. Plus why was she dating this other guy while in town anyway when she's about to get married.  Either she'd straight away realise she's really after someone closer to her age who treats her better the second she started talking to the guy, or she'd say I'm just about to get married, I think some other people need to come along as well, and no I'm not going on a picnic with you.",1493164800,,5424,4.26095423563778
