Whenever any of our ""salt water"" friends come to visit, we always take them on a tour. Before they leave town, we always give them a copy of this video. They all really like it.

""Halls of Honor - The Navy Museum"" combines a history lesson and beautiful cinematography to bring the Navy Museum to life.  Lou Linden knows a lot about naval history which is not surprising since he was responsible for saving USS Constellation, the last surviving Civil War era naval vessel. I've never been to the Navy Museum but I feel like I know it now and it is wonderful. Perhaps my favorite thing is the Navy's ship model collection which is wonderfully, minutely photographed showing some of the most telling details.

Everything in the video is on display at the Museum. Also included on the DVD are videos from government footage on carrier warfare and submarine warfare in the Pacific that are shown daily in the Museum.  They were produced for the Museum by Yellow Cat Productions, the outfit that produced this video. If you can't make it down to the Navy Museum located in the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., this is the next best thing.
