There is no other video out there (Ive tried several others) that make you feel like you're really there, with just the natural sounds around you as you work out.  To me the pace is perfect for a quick-stepping routine, not quite a jog.  Thats easier on my knees and yet I get plenty of exercise, all while seeing the fantastic sights of this wonderful area.
Speaking of which, the scenery here in Carmel and Monterey area is just so special, really a treat- enough to use the video over and over.  I especially liked the tour through the Spanish mission- very cultural and it gave me some decorating ideas.",1438992000,,651,4.586206896551724

8652457,3,B00JMKA0X6,"Scenery is very nice, however ... I have bought Bike-O-Vision DVDs in the past and was curious as to the Hike version of these DVDs.  Unfortunately, all seem to be DVD-R now instead of actual DVDs like in the past.  The case is cheap and the DVD does not stay put in the centre lock. DVD-R label seems to have been printed on a home printer.

There is a noticeable up-and-down camera motion from the walking action, which is distracting and makes me slightly dizzy. Compared to the Bike-O-Vision DVDs, in this one there is no music and only sounds from the surrounding area/wind.  In my view, the walking pace is too slow, so it will not suit someone jogging or running on a treadmill.  I prefer the 'Virtual Active Hike' DVDs, which are far superior in production quality, have a good pace and cost about the same.",1408320000,,815,4.47972972972973
