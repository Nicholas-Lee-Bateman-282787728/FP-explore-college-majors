8148889,5,B000J3FBEI,"This is a great film for peace, showing how similar we all are and against war. I collect films. This is sophisticated, before watching should know about the US overthrow of democratically elected President Allende of Chile, replacing him w/Dictator/Torturer Pinochet. I was happy to find ""Mi Mejor Enemigo"" on Amazon. Very Unique moving film! Thanks a lot! Peace on earth.",1385164800,,373,5.131147540983607
8148890,5,B000J3FBEI,"A very funny, very sad, very poignant description of futility in war. Wars are waged between ""nations"" not individuals and seem to be more tragic for individuals than for nations. I don't think I've ever seen a film that made that point so clearly as this does. I recommend it very highly.",1336089600,,289,4.576923076923077
8148891,5,B000J3FBEI,A very good war time movie that gives great insight into the soldiers emotional conflicts. It has bits of humor here and there too. The Chilean and Argentinian accents are beautiful as well. The beginning is super  S L O W....but don't give up! It gets SOOO good! If someone watches this film to the end and doesn't cry they must be dead inside. Loved it!! And I am not one usually for war movies.,1335830400,,397,4.293333333333333
8148892,4,B000J3FBEI,A nice movie that highlights some interesting dynamics between Argentina and Chile in the 70s.  Recommended for anyone who enjoys South America.,1326499200,,144,5.545454545454546
8148893,5,B000J3FBEI,"A real pity movies such as this one never make it to the big screen in the USA.  A Chilean take on the absurdity of war, or better still of a war that does not take place though it exacts two quite painful and unnnecessary casualties.  I recommend it for anyone who uses film as an instruction medium, in spite of the sometimes salty language (the language of the common people).",1235520000,,379,4.323943661971831
8148894,4,B000J3FBEI,"Anyone that has opinions on war and peace should see this movie. It is very philosophycal and with a great sense of humor tells how absurd are wars and how detatched people are from conflicts that ""obligate"" them to go and fight. Good video and sound, acting is excellent.",1168300800,2,272,4.571428571428571
