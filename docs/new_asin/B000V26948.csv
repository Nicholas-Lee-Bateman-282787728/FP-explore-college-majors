IDK why anyone would pay $15 for it though when it's completely free to watch on Youtube.",1376611200,,206,4.54054054054054
8216267,5,B000V26948,"Peter Jennings Report-Ecstasy Rising is an unbiased review of the club drug ecstasy in the United States. The dvd shows the real side of taking ecstasy.  This is not a video that says taking ecstasy is good or bad. This video shows both sides and leaves the viewer to make their own opinion. If you want to get the truth about ecstasy or are considering taking the drug, watch this video.",1219017600,2,388,4.464788732394366
