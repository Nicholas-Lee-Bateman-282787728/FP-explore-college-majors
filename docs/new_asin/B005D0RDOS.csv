4656039,4,B005D0RDOS,"While I do not necessarily anticipate PAGE ONE: INSIDE THE NEW YORK TIMES addressing it, somehow it disappoints me that this documentary leaves the so-called demise of newspapers at blame-the-Internet.  I have read that many papers would be in better shape, and certainly fewer out of business, had publishers not left what was already a very profitable business alone by unnecessarily cutting costs, the appeal of even bigger short-term payoffs dooming long-term revenue.  Still, I can't complain about PAGE ONE being what it is, especially since many NEW YORK TIMES reporters we meet aren't the stuffed shirts I, for one, would have expected.

PAGE ONE reminds us that even if the Internet had not cut in on some of the newspaper industry's action, THE NEW YORK TIMES probably still would have lost readers when its complicity with the Bush White House became public knowledge.  As a subscriber to the F.A.I.R. (Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting) publication EXTRA! for 25 years, I've read more than a few articles about the TIMES' pro-moneyed interests reporting, but the Judith Miller/Iraq scandal took it to a higher level.

Nonetheless, I'm still rooting for the NEW YORK TIMES to survive and be a great newspaper, even if it was never as great as we think.  We need newspapers.  There is no substitute for them.",1323388800,7,1317,4.986301369863014

4656041,4,B005D0RDOS,"This is a must-see (if somewhat unfocused) documentary for anyone interested in the future of the mainstream media. Page One covers a year in the life of the New York Times, a once mighty newspaper now reduced to mortgaging its own building and taking out costly loans from a Mexican telecommunications tycoon. The paper, which is a ""legacy"" media operation (i.e. very expensive to run) has been hit hard by the simultaneous collapse in advertising revenue and the rise of new media. The days when a story wasn't a story until it the New York Times are over. Or are they?

The giant may be wounded, but it's still a giant. Page One shows some of the negotiations with Julian Assange of Wikileaks, who provided material to the paper because he knew it was the best way to spread his message. Popular news aggregator sites are happy to link to, or rewrite, New York Times stories but don't want to pay for them.

So what does the paper do? Does it stop printing and focus only on digital delivery, does it put up a paywall to fend off the freeloaders, or does it continue trying to save costs (we see tearful farewells of people who have been fired) as it slowly bleeds away? Several other major U.S. newspapers have already folded while others are effectively in bankruptcy protection. Who cares who produces the news as long as it's out there?

Because this is a media story, Page One tells it largely through the eyes of the paper's media reporters. This is where the film starts to run into problems. Much of the film focuses on David Carr, the loud and opinionated media correspondent who used to be a violent drug addict until he turned his life around. Although Carr is certainly a character, and resolutely defends the traditional values of the paper at the many panels he speaks at, putting so much emphasis on one person means the audience starts to wonder whether the film is really about him or the Times or both or neither. The effect is confusing and we wander down a few dead-ends, such as the farewell party for a reporter heading off for Iraq. This is supposed to show that the Times does matter, that it is devoting a lot of resources to cover a difficult and important story. Yet the way it is slotted into the film makes it look almost like an afterthought.

That said, there's enough here to make it worthwhile, including some very funny moments (the bemused reaction of reporters and editors when NBC ""announces"" the pullout of the last U.S. troops from Iraq is worth the entry price alone) and many scenarios which will ring true for reporters in the audience.

Page One doesn't really answer any of the questions it poses, although it does seem to conclude the Times would be sorely missed if the paper went under. All in all, this is a flawed documentary, yet one well worth watching.",1323043200,23,2807,4.583665338645418
4656042,5,B005D0RDOS,"I usually review music and entertainment items on Amazon but - when something catches my eye outside that arena - I often review those releases. This is one of those cases.

On its surface, this thoroughly engaging documentary may look like it's the story of how the New York Times operates but, even more it's a contemporary story of the future of the PRINTED newspaper in the digital age. After viewing this, especially with someone else in the room, you'll find yourself discussing the issues raised here.

Another reviewer here suggested that this is a film that will be of interest to those fascinated with journalism. I'll counter that comment by saying that this will interest ANYONE who gets their news via TV, radio, print media or - even more importantly - from Twitter or Facebook. And, with total access to the newsroom (mostly the ""Media"" department) at the Times, for a 2-3 year period, Director Andrew Rossi, were there when news was ""made"". The film will hold your attention for the full 92 minutes, especially since Rossi chose to use Media Reporter David Carr (a former crack addict and convicted felon!) as a thread weaving throughout the film. Carr has a personality and dry wit that may rub some folks the wrong way but which I found fascinating - as well as (I'm searching for the right word here) ""entertaining"". There are interviews with non-Times folks like Carl Bernstein (Washington Post), author Gay Talease (who wrote the corporate history of the Times), and Managing Editors for Vanity Fair, The Nation, the New Yorker and The Atlantic. At one point in the film NBC takes a lot of flak for announcing that the war in Iraq was over - when the Pentagon denied it.

But - again - the story here is about the future of print media with the introduction of the iPad and smart phones and Twitter (which Carr says he uses to get his news updates!).

The Bonus features make this DVD worth getting, even if you saw the film in a theater. The five ""additional scenes"" (totaling 21 minutes) are just as important as what was included in the theatrical release - they just would have made it longer. There are comments by Bernstein and two others interviewed in the film (totaling nine more minutes). A segment showing well-known journalists (Brian Williams, Morley Safer, etc) providing their reactions to seeing the film last three minutes). A compilation of Q&A sessions with the Director and the Times Staff featured in the film is superfluous and runs 16 minutes). Finally there is a 5-minute mini-feature made by the Times Media report shipped to Iraq, using a Flip camera. This little ""film"" is heart wrenching with some of the footage.

This is one of the best documentaries I've seen this year and I highly recommend it.

4656043,4,B005D0RDOS,"There is a lot of good material here, but using David Carr, or any reporter or editor as a protagonist doesn't do justice to the issues.  The film concerns the role of the Times in the online world. Good reporting is essential for a successful democracy which is why citizens should be concerned about demise of the print journalism and/or the Times.

I'm a former NYT devotee, so much so such that Judith Miller's stories swayed me.  While not fully back in the fold, I understand the void that the cut backs at the NYT are already causing. But I cannot help but wonder, from this film, who the custodians of this institution might actually be?

They admit missing the connection between Monster Jobs and Craig's List and their revenue stream. For those supposedly on top of news and trends, this in itself is an indictment. If the documentary reflects the public face the paper presents, the first Black I remember seeing was Jayson Blair, followed by the woman laid off, then there were the Black street vendors... One featured story was the Times coverage of the Tribune bankruptcy... as if to show ""we're not them"". Another one was Wiki-leaks where it seemed they felt that Julian Assange's using the Times as an outlet was a validation of their revelance.

In recent years, the Times has not lived up to its reputation. It wasn't only Judith Miller or Jason Blair, it was holding negative stories about Bush until after the 2004 election and the presentation of Al Gore in the election before that. There was a lot of writing about VP Cheney and his secret energy meetings, but, in those days when I still read the Times faithfully, I never saw it reported what that energy policy was or even what it was about.o That is, the focus was more on the the process of getting information about who was at meetings than on the policies those meetings might be addressing.  Just recently the Times was slow to even mention Occupy Wall Steeet... how many blocks is this from the Times HQ?

Perhaps the reasons they've been eclipsed are in this personality driven film. Those featured were bright, intelligent... I've read their work... and very good writers. They feel the tradition, the importance and the weight, but they seem to be like deer in the headlights.

The Times never tried a cable channel. Al Gore is starting from scratch... why had they not reached out and offered their tremendous asset base? Why isn't Rachel Maddow a Times property? Buying Nate Silver's blog was a good move (but try to find him on their web site), but how could they have missed Swing State Project or having open reader comment on almost everything like the WaPo. In investigations, the time spent on the Tribune, might have been better spent on the Murdock enterprises. The coulda woulda shoulda list is long.

I know my comments are more about the Times than this film, but I believe this film is the Times' comments on itself and they seem to be saying ""we're stuck"".",1319500800,3,2956,4.6692307692307695
4656044,4,B005D0RDOS,"This documentary isn't for everyone, which is why I rated it a 4 not a 5. But for someone interested in journalism today, I think it's very interesting. I thought the filmmakers did a good job of balancing perspectives about topics like the shrinking of print journalism, who will pay for the news? (real news...you know, with facts and such), and the Gray Lady herself. I found David Carr (who's Carpetbagger series bored me in the NYT online) a very interesting character. Then-Editor Bill Keller was very open and thoughtful. The younger guns who are neck deep in new/social media were sharp and insightful. And the timing of the announcements at the end was very cool. Great stuff.",1319414400,13,685,4.813559322033898
4656045,4,B005D0RDOS,"It's about traditional media vs. new media.  It's about the demise of newspapers.  Most of all, this is a look at the way journalism is capable of working.  I really didn't hear a lot ""complaining"" about new media. There was a lamination by people who care about their job and what they do under attack by a culture not interested in learning about the world.

I really enjoyed Page One.  This is the first time I had the chance to watch editors pick apart stories as they happen; this was the first chance I had to actually watch a reporter fact check a story for balance and accuracy.  It explores numerous questions, and doesn't pretend to have a single definitive answer.

What is the visual of the end of the war, when there is no end of the war?
(Concerning the troop width-drawl from Iraq)

What does a community loose when a local newspaper closes?

4656046,1,B005D0RDOS,"This film examines the decline of the newspaper business from the point of view of the smug, self-important reporters who have been polishing the brass on the Titanic over the past dozen years.  They blame everyone but themselves for their failures.  Monster took our job ads.  Craigslist stole our classifieds.  Bloggers are scooping us.  It's everyone else's fault but their own.  Nonsense.  If their reporting was anywhere near the quality it used to be, people would still be buying the paper on and offline.  Of course the NYT lost revenue streams.  That's what happens in business.  This film reveals the cause of their looming downfall.  A failure to adapt brought on by snobbery and short term risk aversion.  The chose to trim the meat with the fat.  The result can be spelled out in four words.  Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq.",1319328000,8,829,4.828571428571428

In light of Mr. Carr's early and untimely passing, Page One has a nostalgic twist that wouldn't have been the case even a month ago.

Although that is nothing new, the repercussions are just now coming to light. You actually see multiple instances of how a story gets published in the NYT vs. another new age online news site that have no right to call themselves journalist. One thing is for certain, our society may not care about the important stories, but the threat of public knowledge keeps things in balance. That goes for government officials, corporations, and regular citizens. Without an institute that upholds that accountability, we are doomed. That was my takeaway from this movie.

not, whether you like the New York Times or not, you have to admit that it is one of --if not the-- leading
source of news information in the world. Sure, go ahead and log on to an online service news provider if
you want, but next time really study to see how many of them generate news (that is, do first-hand news
reporting) versus simply recapping something from another new source. Then count the other news
sources. Guaranteed at least one of them is from the New York Times.
Page One is a new documentary about the New York Times and how it manages to stay in business
(although somewhat tenuously it would seem) in an electronic age. The film follows one of its star
reporters, David Carr, whos focus at the paper is media trends. Carr is as interesting a character as any
film could hope for, and his antics tell the story. And while clearly this film has the blessing of the Times
(i.e., not so many disparaging remarks about the paper unless followed by a rebuttal that trumps the
criticism), the film does still manage to get its point across with compelling drive and vigor. So high marks

4656155,5,B005D0RDOS,"For all it's warts and shortcomings, the Times has been a steady beacon delivering ""all the news that's fit to print"" for most of the country's history. Founded in 1861 and winner of 112 Pulitzer Prize awards for journalism, the Times has weathered a lot of storms, and has been covering every corner of our vast country, and world, setting the benchmark for journalistic excellence for all other papers to follow.

That was yesterday. Today the Times is holding on for dear life. As noted in the film, it costs more to by one copy of the paper on the newsstand than to buy one share of the company's stock. It gets worse. The Internet's disruptive technology, which has already decimated the music recording industry, and has been aiming at doing the same to film and art, now has spilled over to journalism.

Our nation depends on a strong journalistic presence to keep the government honest, and to give context and perspective on the issues of our times. And just when Wall Street has gone rogue and the Supreme Court has backed Citizens United, we are at a very crucial juncture in our country. Everything, including our weather and shifting climate, has become politicized. The Times is running as fast as it can to stay in place, yet it still losses ground.

The documentary does not bother walking through the long dark smoke-stained hallways of the past, it lives in the ever disappearing present where everything on the Internet is just one big hustle to get a piece of the advertising bucks. Competing websites to the Times most often aggregate news from all over the web, and in a very funny moment at a journalism conference, David Carr illustrates just how dependent all other media outlets are on the Times.

I found this documentary to be a wake up call. If it goes under, as fewer people are willing to pay for news, nothing could replace it. In 1861 in reported on the Civil War. Today it covers every inch of the globe, and rarely gets it wrong. Tomorrow it could be toast. The only viable alternative route might be to become a non-profit organization supported by large foundations and individual gifts. America needs the Times. The world needs the Times.

David Carr, is a reporter for the New York Times, and he has a large presence in the film.

Carr is an interesting guy and he wrote The Night of the Gun which is an honest portrayal of his life with substance abuse and using his investigative tools to put together his biography. It was a bonus to see him in action and changes my idea of what a print man looks like. The end of the film discusses the impact of the bankruptcy by The Tribune and Carrs investigative article to the abuse of power by the managing editor.

I imagined they would be more professional, kind of like Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford in ""All the President's Men"". I guess this is a case of how media influences our perceptions, and gives us unrealistic ideas.

So I found the video worthwhile to give the reality of work at the NYT. The reporters' work seemed stressful, their jobs difficult.

I gave the documentary three stars because it seemed somewhat disjointed / random, and to very much over-emphasize one reporter, David Carr. I was hoping for something more organized and comprehensive about the NYT. But it's an OK documentary.

Here are some of the main topics:

- NYT negotiations with Julian Assange.
- Decreasing ad revenues for papers.
- All about David Carr, an unconventional reporter.
- Is the NYT ""too important to fail""?
- Judith Miller - wrong assessment pre-Iraq war
- Jayson Blair - his fabricated stories
- Sad story of Sam Zell and Tribune Company
- Brian Stelter and new media at the NYT
- Google and Yahoo using news stories for free
- Hard decisions about how to keep NYT in the black

Who reports the news if there are no big papers left? Who will keep powerful interests honest if we don't have real investigative reporting? I think these are very important questions raised by the documentary.",1391990400,,1544,4.678966789667896
4656164,3,B005D0RDOS,"I suppose this might be an interesting film for someone who cares about the print news business but somehow has been completely oblivious to what's happened to newspaper revenue streams.

Because that's all this movie really boils down to: some not particularly revelatory pieces about how print revenue is down (although Rossi never asks the various print magazines featured what they're doing differently), there's this amazing new thing called Twitter and news aggregators like the Huffington Post, Gawker and does-it-still-even-exist Newser are getting all the Web hits generated by the NYT and old media shoe leather reporting. In other words, nothing new for anyone who'd be interested in this movie.

Also probably not news is that everyone on camera, with the exception of the fascinating David Carr, who merits a documentary all his own (as does Tim Arango, who heads to Iraq and only reappears soundlessly in the credits), is inordinately pleased with themselves, acting as though the NYT is the source of all journalism in America. (Hilariously, one staffer claims you can trace nearly every story in major media in America back to the NYT, which is never challenged despite being clearly nonsense.) Counterarguments like Judith Miller, Watergate and Jayson Blair have to be brought up by third parties; apparently they've been forgotten already by the NYT staff.

I've worked in newspapers since 1992, so maybe I'm a little too aware of these issues already, but I feel director Andrew Rossi wasted his access and produced a 90-minute equivalent of any number of American Journalism Review articles written years ago about this issue. If viewers want a better understanding of hear all newspapers are grappling with, they should go there.

And for a better understanding of what life is actually like inside a newspaper, hunt down the one-season Bravo reality show, Tabloid Wars, which is both more insightful and not filled with staffers spending all their time patting themselves on the back for being so wonderful.",1387670400,,2029,5.195718654434251

4656203,1,B005D0RDOS,"This film comes off a slick marketing stunt and skin-deep alibi for why the NY Times - called ""the Grey Lady"" in its heyday - fell on its own double-edged corporate media sword. It denies the stunt with a bit of skill over the usual reasons for failure (paradigm shift of online news, web classifieds competition, etc.)

A good deal of the story is told through the NY Times and life of former drug addict turned rehabbed and righteous reporter - David Carr. Choosing this kind of character to build sympathy for a corporate product is a very old PR tactic. The pick of what appears an everyday hardworking ex-underdog as spokesman to buff-clean the toxic NYT ""news"" record could hardly be accidental. According to pulitzer prize winning ex-NY Times journalist Chris Hedges in his thoughtful piece on this very documentary: Carr was ""an anomaly at a company that attracts well-heeled and often overeducated reporters"". (see Truthdig: ""The Myth of The New York Times, in Documentary Form"")

Now to the core reasons for the fall...

NYT's utterly phony ""reporting"" on the need for an Iraq War by a ""she-acted-alone"" scapegoat operation starring Judith Miller goes well beyond the inexcusable. Virtually the entire paper was behind the deception (again, see Chris Hedges Truthdig story: ""The Myth of The New York Times, in Documentary Form""). This is as close to a criminal act for any news source in memory where consequences include a million plus dead in Iraq along with thousands of Americans over a trillion dollars in blood money channeled to a swollen Big Oil military-security complex. Withholding the story of illegal spying on American citizens by Bush/Cheney to insure Bush victory for 2004 is another obvious example for why the paper has vaporized most of its credibility.

To suggest as others have that ""everyone in the media was doing it"" and nobody else knew better is an arrant crock for a transparently cooked ""war on terror"" (backed by 935 official lies passed on by the U.S. corporate media as of 2008 according to the Center for Public Integrity). Bloggers throughout the web posted real reporting on the criminal fraud and deception of Iraq War as opposed to NY Times deliberate disinformation. And this, without a fraction of the vast budget and resources pumped through the NY Times indoctrination machine. (facts were available from people like UNSCOM inspector Scott Ritter)

A sample of the NYT being busted for soiling itself in action...

The NYT ""Covers"" the Susan Lindauer Hearing
[...]
Yeah, the NY Times occasionally turns in a good story but when the bought message becomes the medium, it's not worth the paper it's no longer printed on. No, the NY Times is not uniquely crooked or compromised. Far from it. But it has become the Tokyo Rose of the corporate media snake pit.

Cute moments aside, this film is whitewashed propaganda.",1336435200,,2864,4.941787941787942
4656204,4,B005D0RDOS,"You know its odd to think that it takes a documentary to humanize a totally human entity, one that has been around for decades. Computers do a lot of things for us yet they don't write newspaper articles, although a lot of people may think they do.  And that is what is fascinating about Page One. It lends faces and stories to the stories and the words that create the New York Times, both online and in print. I don't live in the New York area, I live in Long Beach, Ca, yet I read the New York Times many times a day because it is a publication that I trust.  And what I like about this documentary is that it tries to merge all of the issues that the newspaper business as a whole has and ones that media companies face all together. Where is the future? Is the future free? And if not, how much should it cost? These and many other questions that aren't going away any time soon. Page One gives you a glimpse inside the newspaper, writers and editorial meetings of how decisions are made at the Times.

One of my contentions with new media is that they say that legacy publications like the Times edit what readers get in the paper. And that new media allows the uninterrupted flow of information to the end user.  And I say, yes, that is what I  paying for, somebody with the knowledge and experience to craft a story that is understandable with facts, and even some opinion that give it credit. I'm purchasing the experiences of the person who wrote the story, and even their reputation.

I've never received the print edition of the paper, but I am devoted follower of the publication and the people who work for it. I'm glad the Times went to a pay site and I hope that it helps keep them around for decades to come.",1334793600,,1725,4.292307692307692
4656205,2,B005D0RDOS,"I went into this movie thinking I was going to see a general look at the struggles of the newspaper industry. Instead this movie appears to be a one sided agenda driven story, with the goal of convincing the viewer that the New York Times is still relevant, and why. I don't believe that was the goal for this film, but considering that the story is seen through the eyes of one NYT newsroom instead of a more general point of view, it leaves you wondering about the other side of this important story.

One question that I believe is central to this media debate is the value of paid reporters and who they work for. This documentary correctly asserts (through the voice of NYT reporters) that you can't replace on the scene reporters with bloggers working from home. However, the film never investigates the possibility that the news world can get along without a centralized regime that revolves around the New York Time's shoe leather reporting. Can other media outlets (and yes, including web based operations) provide shoe leather reporting as well as the Times? Can the The Grey Lady (and other legacy media giants) evolve into the modern instant access news outlet that the public craves? What about the TV network news giants, will they still be relevant as the ""Me"" generation grows up and takes over? If you want the answer to any of these questions, don't bother watching this film.

If instead you are a fan of the New York Times and you are hoping to hear evidence that the paper is still on the right track, buy some popcorn and enjoy this movie.",1334448000,6,1561,4.611510791366906
4656206,5,B005D0RDOS,Great documentary.  Interesting perspectives from people who live and breathe journalism and are witness to the way technology is changing the way we disseminate and consume information.,1334361600,,186,5.888888888888889
4656207,4,B005D0RDOS,"When the New York Times decided that they needed to charge for the digital version of their paper, I was undecided. I could view 20 items a month, but quickly realized that would take me through a few days. I love the Times, and signed my contract. I read the New York Times everyday, but I had only a passing understanding of how a newspaper really works. I had seen all the films, read all the books by the famous journalists, but watching this documentary, gave me such a different view of the New York Times.

The documentary gives an overview of how the best newspaper in the world, functions and runs its daily business. It concentrates a great deal on the financial crisis of 2008 and on. This time was probably the most critical time in the face of journalism, many newspapers went under, thousands of lay offs occurred across the US. We are given a first hand look at the media desk, and a sampling of journalists, but not the nitty gritty of newspaper life. We follow David Carr as he discovers a great story about the Chicago Tribune and the scandals involved. David Carr is a superb journalist and we see how he works and how he gathers his information. We follow him on several speaking events. This documentary also focuses on the Pentagon Papers, Judith Miller, and Jayson Blair. We meet Bill Keller, the executive editor, but don't really see him at his job. We meet Brian Stelter who garnered his job from a blog that became so popular that Brian Williams read it everyday, and he was offered a job at the New York Times. I follow his tweets and learn a great deal from him about the news of the world.

This documentary gave me a bird's eye view of the New York Times, but I felt I was missing the real guts and glory of the paper. I came away feeling more impressed with the New York Times. A second edition documentary would be a great investment.

4656218,5,B005D0RDOS,"First off, everyone who cares about newspapers and journalism in general or the New York Times in particular should see this movie.

Page One: Inside The New York Times is a compelling fly-on-the-wall documentary (released in 2011) that takes you inside the newsroom during a stressful, challenging time in The Gray Lady's history.

It's 2010, and as newspapers all around the country are going bankrupt, things are looking dire at The Times too. The question is, if it's this tough for the New York Times - and by extension every other national and major metro newspaper - what hope is there for everyone else?

For those who know the industry, the challenges are not new: Like most US newspapers, the NYT is struggling in the age of the internet. The high costs of the ""legacy"" business - a big newsroom, a network of global bureaus, a dead-tree product distributed inefficiently by a fleet of trucks, etc. etc. - are slamming up against a declining print readership and, even more importantly, a cratering ad market, with the Classified section already savaged by Craiglist and the ""expensive"" display advertising market tanking in the face of a brutal recession.

But if the future is all online, where does the future revenue come from? Especially in a world where, as the Times's Brian Stelter points out, more and more online readers have, ""grown up in the era where everything seems free.""

Beyond the business questions, the film also explores the crucial debate about the role newspapers like the Times play in American society. Are they, as then-Executive Editor Bill Keller says, ""essential to a functioning democracy."" Do they still fulfill the mission described by famed Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein of delivering ""the best obtainable version of the truth""?

Among the 2010 news stories we see covered: The release of the Wikileaks cables. The final pullout of combat troops from Iraq. The Times reporting on the bankruptcy of Sam Zell's doomed experiment at the Tribune Company. Plus, stories crucial to the Times's own future: the launch of the iPad, the decision to charge for access to the Times online. (This attempt to reinvent the online business model with a ""metered paywall,"" is described by media and tech guru Clay Shirky as the ""NPR model"" relying on the support of a faithful, well-intentioned audience so that a product may survive to serve the general good.)

At one point Sam Zell is seen (in a clip from a YouTube video) talking to his newspaper employees explaining how he will save the Tribune Company because ""he is not a newspaperman, (but) a business man.""

The movie follows business columnist David Carr - a star of the movie - as he reports on the collapse of Sam Zell's Tribune Company, the biggest media bankruptcy in history. When explaining how CEO Randy Michaels and a handful of executives extracted $100 million in bonuses even as billions of dollars of value evaporated, Carr wryly states: ""you could call that incentives or you could call that looting, depending on your perspective.""

Later we see how David Carr's extensive takedown of the ""frat-house"" culture that helped destroy the morale of Tribune employees comes together--and how Carr relies on ""the muscles of the institution"" of The Times to get to work when the Tribune lawyers threaten legal action before his story goes to press.

Watch this movie and you will, I'm sure, care about the answers to the questions it raises: Can news(papers) be saved? Can reporting staffs and foreign bureaus be saved? What is journalism in the age of Twitter and Wikileaks? Who will pay to keep newspapers going? How much do we all lose if and when the journalism now produced by newspapers goes away?",1333497600,3,3708,4.927884615384615
4656219,4,B005D0RDOS,"Advertising revenues are down (how much?), and the number of competitors is up (eg. HuffingtonPost), innumerable blogs). Major advertising losses can be attributable to CraigsList, Monster.com, and corporate websites. Judy Miller and Jason Blair created significant credibility problems for The Times as well. Layoffs have resulted (industry-wide #?). Viewers also get an inside view of decision-making on sensitive information - eg. from WikiLeaks. Media reporter David Carr was featured prominently.

Makes one think about a world without quality newspapers such as The New York Times. Blogs certainly are not a substitute, neither is the Huffington Post (superficial). Much of today's writing is done by unpaid writers - impossible to provide the depth and credibility that are essential.",1332806400,,791,5.760683760683761
4656220,4,B005D0RDOS,"An interesting behind-the-scenes look at the paper of record, and perhaps the only newspaper in America worth paying for. Certainly more questions than answers here, as the paper tries to come up with ways to continue to do its important work as advertising revenue decreases, but I think the people who say that a true democracy must have a free press are correct. Without the Times, many of the outlets we get our news from in trickle-down fashion would dry up as well. If we don't pay for this paper, who will be there to tell us what goes on in the world in a trustworthy, balanced, and as fair as possible manner?

It certainly won't be FOX News. It certainly won't be Vice Magazine partnering with CNN. And, much as we may enjoy them, it won't be Wikileaks. Perhaps the Grey Lady still has something to say, a few stories worth telling?

Also, this is certainly off track, but the ending of this film states that the Times now charges to read its stories. I visit the site regularly and have never been asked to pay for anything. Does this only take effect after a certain number of stories viewed (as suggested earlier in the film), or does it only apply to ""old"" news in the archives, or is this info simply incorrect? Just curious.",1332720000,2,1240,4.482300884955753
4656221,5,B005D0RDOS,"This is a movie about those of us from the 60s who wanted to make a change in the world and we actually did. An enormous change; one in which we have taken the icons off the shelf and shattered them, not merely to destroy them, but to determine their character, internal mechanism, values.  I think we did this because we all wanted the unvarnished truth; even if we can't take it, don't know what to do with it once we have that truth. Making tough decision and then standing up to the consequences can be a rare tight rope walk, and someone will or even has gotten hurt. Yet changes are inevitable and while we seem to have less control over these events that are taking place, it is all part of the ebb and tide, or the current term may be more like the yin and yang of all things. I, myself wanted to become a journalist before making the final choice to use my investigative and analytical nature in the field of health care. Choosing Traditional Chinese Medicine allowed me to use the same searching within a large field of knowledge and wisdom, in order to collect and determine a diagnosis and treatment, and relieve suffering. Funny, it has been nearly impossible to survive the loss of integrity in the printed or virtual word, however. Followed by use of public opinion and fear based accusations, regardless of the successes in undisclosed patient records and lives successfully changed, I have not survived the drastic use of fraudulent documentation. I can no longer refer to myself as an acupuncturist, even in the past tense, according to the legal threats, indicating that I am responsible for using the title doctor on the internet, when directories posted my name as such to promote their 'lists'. In the not to distant past, it was referred to as slander and libel, or even fraud. I am not sure that these terms still exist in the legal codes any longer. Now we call it bullying and frown on it. I am a digital subscriber to the NY Times out of loyalty to the truth and integrity that it (truth) can call forward when published, albeit in print or online. Of course, I was already getting my news throughout the web on other sites, before returning to pay for my subscription at the NYT. Somehow, it is an exchange of trust. I with my meager digital subscription rate get to read the headlines and breaking news 24/7, search for stories on topic that influence my daily decisions, share articles that are noteworthy with collaboratives or combatants, while the NYT continue to use journalism ethics, reporting as accurately as I expect them to, I hope...

4656222,3,B005D0RDOS,"I enjoyed this documentary - and found David Carr's commentary to be the best part of the film.

The description of the program indicates that it covers a period of a year at the paper - which of course - will be a bit of a random walk - so not sure why another reviewer calls out the fact that it is ""unfocused"".

While living in Washington D.C. the Washington Post was a Sunday ritual - and to this day - I still consider it to have been the best newspaper I've ever read, hands-down.

While living in Los Angeles, the L.A. Times became part of my Sunday ritual - and holds the rank of the 2nd best newspaper to my mind.

In the 1999-2002 time frame, while living in Seattle, Washington - the Seattle Post Intelligencer was introduced into my Sunday ritual - and the writing of John Cook still stands out in my mind to this day - as some of the very reporting ever.

A free and robust press is essential to the survival of democracy.  Reporters, who are free to pursue stories, independent of other concerns required to earn a livelihood are essential - and are not so easily replaced by the likes of Facebook, Twitter, Gawker, or the like.

Steadfast reporting such as was produced by the likes of Cronkite, Murrow, Rather, Woodward & Berstein - must not perish - or else our democracy will fall to tyranny.",1327104000,2,1310,4.366255144032922

4656227,4,B005D0RDOS,"I had to watch this a couple of times in order to digest just how behind the times the print media is (as is old media in general).  For a news organization such as the New York Times not to understand or appreciate Twitter, not have heard of wikileaks until it was hitting them over the head is incomprehensible, and certainly negligent. When your job is reporting the news you should know these things, you should know the pulse of the world you report on.

The New York Times has clearly been living in a bubble, as has most of the media.  They've been picking and choosing the news, which in part has empowered the forces they are now contending with, and that could be the cause for their demise.

This documentary touches upon this, but shifts towards examining the personalities behind the news who just aren't coming to grips with the fact that their world has changed drastically.  The media can't seem to get past its sense of self-importance.

The film comes across as a tragedy that hasn't finished the final act.  How this will play out for the New York Times is anyone's guess.  I don't think the solution is hiding behind a pay wall and further removing yourself from the world at large.  Adapt or die.  Create a new business model or perish.  It's that simple.

I'd love to see a companion documentary to this that focuses on the rise of the new media and the challenges it faces.

I for one am happy about the rise of the digital world, which provides a more immersive experience for both news and entertainment.

It's going to be interesting to see how the shift in news gathering and reporting plays out.",1323561600,2,1623,4.513698630136986

8466199,5,B005D0RDOS,"This is a great documentary. The intent was to be a feature on the New York Times, but what is memorable is David Carr. He was so dedicated and passionate about his work. Truly inspirational. As for the year in the life of NYT, the film seemed like the downplayed the credibility blows the paper took with their plagiarism and fabrication scandals. The film definitely gives insights how the newspaper business has changed dramatically in the last 15 years. Overall great film. Especially David Carr.",1502755200,,500,4.894117647058824
