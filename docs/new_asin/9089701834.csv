1172428,4,9089701834,"I watched this during my treadmill workout. It was nice to have outdoor scenery to watch. I don't like watching tv while I walk because I want my thoughts to wander and not have to focus on a tv show. Music is nice for awhile but it gets tiring to have earbuds in my ears too long. My tv location requires me to turn my head to the side which is not comfortable. I was able to watch this on my laptop which was positioned right in front of the treadmill.

I've only used one of the scenic loops so far and did find that the scenery became a bit monotonous after 30 minutes so next time I will try to watch one of the other loops or switch off between loops to maintain interest. I think I just need to have a change of interest halfway in my workout to keep my motivation strong. The same thing all the time makes me lose interest. I love the dvd though and find it an excellent tool for fitness and plan on buying others to supplement my workout. I recommend it as a tool but don't think one scenic theme is enough to keep interest over and over again. I think variety in exercise and in the dvds you watch help keep motivation strong and keep you continuing to exercise.",1334102400,6,1172,4.117903930131004
1172429,5,9089701834,this DVD was absolutely beautiful; so peaceful both scenery and sounds.  I actually was looking for a virtual bicycle DVD for excercise and this particular DVD did not have the speed that I would have liked but WOW it is so peaceful that I am glad I got it. There was an added benefit that I had not anticipated;  my dog Max really chilled out when this DVD was running.  He is usually very hyper and makes it difficult to concentrate on my exercise but he was enjoying the sights and sounds so much I actually got some of my yoga routine done without a Max attack.,1329264000,16,565,4.261682242990654
1172430,5,9089701834,Absolutely love this dvd. Beautiful scenery. I look forward to working out. I have been walking on average for 20 more minutes. I highly recommend their products!!!,1329177600,7,164,5.111111111111111
1172431,5,9089701834,"I really love the fitness journey - Tropical Scenery. I have a DVD player attached to my treadmill and walk through the trails every day.  I like the variety of paths to chose
from, and I like the option of hearing only nature sounds.  I belong in the senior citizen group and enjoy seeing these trails which I can no longer walk along.  It is a wonderful reminder of something I used to enjoy, but now enjoy in a different way.  I walk slower than the camera moves, but it doesn't seem to matter.  I also turn the volume up loud which puts a little static in the background - but not enough to be disturbing.  I am not really a fan of too many electronic gizmos, but these DVDs are 100% outstanding.  It is obvious that a lot of work went into making a quality product. Thank you for keeping alive the beauty of nature in my life.",1326844800,13,831,4.188679245283019
1172432,5,9089701834,"Fitness Journeys - Tropical Scenery

When I was younger, I ran miles and miles outside on nearby trails. Once I turned 50, my knees started giving me trouble, and my doctor told me that I needed to give up running for good. My husband bought me an elliptical machine and a small TV so that I could watch movies while I exercised. But I missed seeing trees and hearing the sounds of nature. Then I heard about the Fitness Journeys, a virtual trip through different surroundings. I ordered several from the Ambient Collection DVDs, and I've been enjoying my exercise more than ever! The Tropical Scenery Fitness Journey includes four different tracks with tropical images and sounds that vary in length, from Mountain Sea Views, which is a about 14 and a half minutes long, to Coastal Butterflies, which is nearly 33 minutes. Each one has its distinct views and sounds. I enjoy them all, though my favorite is Mountain Sea Views with its breathtaking scenes of the ocean.",1289001600,34,969,4.733727810650888

1172457,5,9089701834,"To Potential Customers, the product description is accurate.  I will add to it but try not to include too many ""spoilers"" so as not to ruin your experience, but this is my favorite daytime walk so far.  The first Track - Lush Green Lane starts you off on a clear morning in front of a Balinese temple, I see the sign ""Pura"" which indicates this.  The paved pathway meanders along the outskirts of this temple through green tropical foliage, blue skies, the sun is shining, some white puffy clouds but not much, and purple mountains majesty in the background as you seem to be going somewhat downhill.  Track 2 Mountain Sea Views takes you on a cloudless blue sky day down a neat paved path where you may occasionally see the natives doing their daily tasks, some animals pop out, I won't spoil the surprise, but I really like the little dogs.  You can see some of the residences which are decorated for, I think, the Balinese holiday of Galungan, with long bamboo poles called penjors arcing over the roadway, each house has one, it is so festive!  Track 3 is a bit different, the roadway is gravel and the vegetation is smaller-leafed, the trek is long so make sure you have your water bottle!  It ends with a special surprise!  The 4th Track, Tropical Walk, takes you again on a paved path, blue skies, green lush large-leafed tropical foliage and palms.  Again you will see the natives here and there doing their work harvesting bananas etc, but I don't want to give away all the surprise elements.  89 minutes of great walking footage.  After exercising on the machine of your choice watching these tracks, you will feel happy and rejuvenated, the visuals plus the exercise should release endorphins for a most gratifying experience.  There are natural sounds accompanying the video, but you can also play your own Zen music to add to your enjoyment.  I highly recommend this one.",1450051200,7,1884,4.672727272727273

1172464,4,9089701834,"This one is much better.  Shortly after starting, there was a chicken on the side of the road.  Several dogs then a boy leading a cow and calf.  Nearer the end, there was an animal in the woods on the left of the road, by the time I realized it was an animal we had passed it but I think it was a horse.  Also, quite a few people appeared.

1172472,4,9089701834,"Beautiful tropical scenery makes exercise fun. However, there is little variety. It could be one long track instead of 4 tracks. One track is supposed to feature butterflies, but all I saw were a few specks that darted across the screen here and there. But the scenery is gorgeous, and I will definitely use this DVD often.",1402358400,,323,4.684210526315789
1172473,5,9089701834,It is what I wanted in a walking tape. I walk slow and it works perfectly. The dvd makes walking on the treadmill enjoyable as you look outside and see nothing but snow. I would say this dvd is perfect for any speed that you walk.,1392249600,,230,4.021739130434782
1172474,1,9089701834,"I bought this one particularly for the ""Coastal Butterflies"" track. There are a couple of butterflies that flit across the screen. Easy to miss them. Basically this DVD does not live up to its description, and is of poor quality and very boring, so I returned it. I just said I didn't want it any more and the company who sells these charged me $9.98 restocking fee and $3.98 return shipping. Not much of a refund. I expected to pay return shipping but had no idea there was a restocking fee, especially a 50% one.
I will be very careful not to buy anything that comes for this group call themselves the Ambient Collection.",1392076800,,623,4.473684210526316

1172479,4,9089701834,"This is the first time I've tried using something like this and yes, it does make the work-out a little less boring, but I wish there were a way to mix it up a bit, perhaps by settting up options to travel different roads or paths each time you play it? Or, how about creating options so the user could select a running/walking rate for the video so that what you're seeing onscreen matches your work-out speed? The overall quality is good, but I'm not sure if I would consider similar items unless it was a download from an online video service library. I appreciate a variety of options.",1365897600,,589,4.412844036697248
