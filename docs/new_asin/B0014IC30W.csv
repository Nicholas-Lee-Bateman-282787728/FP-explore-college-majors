8255759,5,B0014IC30W,"If you love interesting weapons and military ingenuity, you've love Furure Weapons season two. Hosted by a Navy Seal this is a fun, and informative presentation of cutting edge weapontry. Mind you when this show came out, many weapons shown have since become our present weapons used by the military or gone through some changes.",1381708800,,329,5.0
8255760,4,B0014IC30W,"I want this man's job hosting an awesome show about the many weapons that we have out there.  Some of the things Mac talks about got canned by the army, but whatever thats their loss from the result of their stupidity and ignorance.  I find this very entertaining and educational at the same time.  Season 3 was the best of them all.  Cant wait til that comes out on DVD.",1284076800,,371,4.257142857142857
8255761,5,B0014IC30W,The sections on small arms are particularly interesting. Well done series. Can't beat the price. I can't wait until Season 3 comes out!,1251072000,,135,4.913043478260869

would be better if cover pages would contain more detailed content of the DVD",1243468800,,93,4.8125
8255763,5,B0014IC30W,"I love knowing where the technology is standing at, new inventions, I Love Guns, action, explosion and Sci-fi.  I got what I like in a different format.  I like the way they say more then I expect and the animator ""Mark"" Machowicz is making it fun and entertaining.  Good job marine...

It's worth the price and to be in my collection.  There only two minor thing I can bring to your attention that did make a difference v/s a movie or a regular documentary.  It's a TV presentation and there the ""retrospective"" of before the pause or, last episode was...  Repetition of ""dj-vue"".  Well not a big deal but for me it's breaking the flow of information and the rhythm.  The other thing is, I could see limitation and flaw of many thing presented and the format was more a propaganda of our power more than an exhaustive presentation of what out-there.  But don't get me wrong, I did love-it.  It's highly instructive and entertaining.  As an engineer and ballistic fan, well I saw some side that did not get un-reveled discus or emphases.

Let say I will get the next season, and I know Mark you will not let me behind...",1242432000,,1120,4.485148514851486
8255764,5,B0014IC30W,"Future Weapons season 2 is a very informative documentary. It talks about
the various types of future weapons that are being developed around the globe. I was very happy with the shipping time that it took.  A little over a week which is very fast for the location that I'm at.",1220227200,2,277,4.431372549019608
