5076911,5,B007C8RZBK,Another one of my grandsons favorites.  He just can't seem to get enough of dinosaurs films.  And the amazing part is he is learning and retaining dinosaur facts.,1374364800,3,162,4.75
5076912,3,B007C8RZBK,"I thought by this being an educational type video and the fact that my son watches a ton of other dinosaur movies, educational and otherwise, that he would enjoy this movie. He is actually too scared to watch it and made me turn it off within the first 10 minutes. Needless to say he hasn't watched it all the way through and I don't blame him.",1357948800,7,344,4.2272727272727275
5076913,2,B007C8RZBK,"This was pretty boring. Lot's of talking, not much animation, and definitely not enough to keep our three year old interested. Maybe better for someone obsessed with dinosaurs who is at least 14.",1357084800,5,195,4.9393939393939394

5076916,5,B007C8RZBK,looks great! I haven't watched it but it looks really interesting.  A lot of playing time for your money. Thanks!,1354406400,,113,4.65
5076917,5,B007C8RZBK,"So many independent producers are making less than wonderful, slice & dice junk.  This Is NOT one of them!  Terrific camera work, excellent information that is fun, educational and does a great job of entertaining, while informing!  The two young actors were engaging and professional.  I would recommend for young children through pre-teen.  Excellent video especially for the price!",1334016000,15,384,5.440677966101695

5076944,5,B007C8RZBK,Great gift for those who love to learn about dinosaurs- They tell it all in a clear voice and in a way one can understand-,1392940800,4,122,3.92
5076945,1,B007C8RZBK,"Okay, so I'm all for dinosaur documentaries but this was a real groaner.  It seemed like two kids got together and decided to make a series.  They spend most of their time talking in front of a green screen and seemed nervous being on camera.  Their interviews were yawners and let's be honest, when was the last time any credible documentary used the word ""Brontosaurus"" (seeing as they changed the name over twenty years ago).

In one episode I forced my way through they mentioned Oviraptor meant ""Egg Eater.""  Well, they got it part right.  It means ""Egg Thief"" since it was discovered sitting on a clutch of eggs (did they even mention it was later discovered to be Oviraptor eggs?""

You're not missing anything with this.  Want a dinosaur show for kids stick with Dinosaur Train or the Gary Owens & Eric Boardman shows (old but still fun).",1386374400,16,845,4.624161073825503
5076946,5,B007C8RZBK,Great movie I highly recommend the Amazing World of Dinosaurs. My nephew loved and I was amazed with the quality.,1383696000,,113,4.7
5076947,3,B007C8RZBK,"I got this because I love dinosaur documentaries that combine pictures of actual finds with good computer animation. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the lack of sophisticated graphics in this DVD. I guess it would be informative for little kids, though. Not at all interesting for older kids or adults.",1382313600,,314,5.176470588235294
8514340,1,B007C8RZBK,I bought this as a supplement to my boys homeschool curriculum. The last part of this video skipped thru the whole series! I am very disappointed.,1493856000,,146,4.653846153846154

8514347,3,B007C8RZBK,"Not as professionally done as Paleoworld, but I liked it okay for entertainment purposes. As a low budget production, it does occasionally suffer from the MST3K Effect. Some reviewers have complained that it isn't like those cool CG nature films like ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" and ""Dinosaur Revolution"" which actually bring the animals to life on their screen, but it's not supposed to be. Those are a different type of show. This is just a second rate, retro style, old school paleontology documentary like the kind made in the 1980s. I don't actually mind that though, this is some fine schlock here. The fact that this one appears to have been made very recently makes it a curiosity to collectors. It's almost like a living fossil! Okay, okay, no more bad jokes.

I would have to say that by far the best thing about this series is the music. The very deep and immersive electronic soundscapes that this video has for a soundtrack are AWESOME! It really lets the viewer use their imagination. David Arkenstone was the composer. David Arkenstone - check him out!

And now for the negative. I noticed that in one episode the boy misidentified the T.Rex skeleton behind him as an Allosaurus. 25 years ago this would have been forgivable, as the Allosaurus was often drawn in older books and stop-motion films to resemble a scaled-down version of the Tyrannosaurus, but that isn't what an Allosaurus looks like. This has often confused people and misled them to think that Allosaurus is a synonym for Albertosaurus. Anybody who has seen an Allosaurus skeleton before would NEVER mistake it for a T.Rex. Allosaurus actually bears a striking resemblance to the fictional hybrid ""Indominus Rex"" from Jurassic World; it basically looks like a giant Deinonychus with a fancy crest on its skull. I would know this because Allosaurus and Mapusaurus (an Allosaurus relative) happen to be my two favorite dinosaurs. Which brings me to my other complaint.

When they're discussing the large theropods, T.Rex completely hogs the spotlight! The only time Giganotosaurus and Spinosaurus are even mentioned is when they're being compared to the T.Rex. C'mon, T.Rex is not the only large carnivore with its own story to tell, people! The others might not have had the trademarked bone-crushing jaws, the large brain, or the forward-facing vision, but they're still just as interesting as Rex...maybe even more so.

(sorry, you T.Rex fanboys are not changing my mind)",1451174400,,2450,5.012285012285012
8514348,5,B007C8RZBK,well done,1432771200,,9,4.0
