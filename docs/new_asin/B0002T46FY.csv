2118288,5,B0002T46FY,"Baby's First from The First Wave series is by far the most comprehensive educational video available to babies & Toddlers!
Both my 3 1/2 year old and 2 year old enjoy watching it. Their eyes are glued to the screen! They especially love the STAR characters and laugh and dance when the stars dance to the music!
I am a Baby Einstein Fan and both of my children watched their videos regularly up until about age Two. I wish this video was available when they were younger! They hardly watch any of the Baby Einstein's anymore but both really enjoyed this video. My son enjoyed watching a little boy [Myles] and my two year old daughter enjoyed watching the baby [Lita] - she smiled every time Lita came on screen!
What I like about the video is the way it covers great information not regularly seen on other baby videos. I like how it covered body parts; I have not seen that in other videos and
directions (R, L, diagonal, horizontal, etc). The phonics section is terrific, I can see how it is already helping my two year old to form & speak words correctly and will help lay the foundation for my 3 1/2 year old to learn to read.
I especially like the idea of having the box with Melissa Neumann as the teacher on the screen throughout the entire video speaking to the audience. It gives a personal instructional style to this video that I have not seen in others and my children seem to respond well to it.
I'm very impressed! This is a great product, I highly recommend it! A+!",1087948800,3,1481,4.389090909090909
2118289,5,B0002T46FY,"As a mother of a 13 month old, I have watched many baby videos and Baby's First video is the best on the market. My son is mesmerized by all the colors, shapes and sounds on the video. I think that watching the video has expedited his talking and helped him identify objects. I am excited for more videos to come out by the producers. They know what babies want and need. I would highly recommend Baby's First.",1087776000,,410,4.269230769230769
2118290,5,B0002T46FY,"This video was fantastic. My son who is 3 1/2 years old loves it and has learned so much information from it. The sophisticated use of vocabulary is brilliant. I am so happy to find something out there that gives a toddler and infant the credit for being able to understand and express themselves in an elegant and ambitious way. It is wonderous when a child discovers a whole new language.

This video was especially good for my son who had some hearing issues and the woman speaking and enunciating in the corner (Melissa) was invaluable to him and to his understanding of the material. Children have different learing styles and respond to a variety of techniques, I believe that this video catered perfectly to both the oral and visual approaches in learning.

My child asks for me to play it again and again. Thank you so much for creating an insightful, creative, stimulating and fun video for him to watch.",1146614400,4,913,4.6645962732919255
2118291,5,B0002T46FY,"Fundamentals video holds my son's attention with its fast pace, song-like format, and cheerful narrator, whom he speaks to when watching the video.  I hope there are more videos to come.",1145232000,,186,5.0
2118292,5,B0002T46FY,"I credit Fundamentals for helping my daughter's speech problem. She was almost 2 years old and she did not talk that much. Thanks to the video, which she liked since the first time she watched it, her ability to talk increased very quickly. She started to say more words and also to recognize shapes, colors, letters, and numbers.

Since I found the video very helpful, I gave one to my sister as a gift for my nephew. She first showed it to him when he was 1 1/2 months.  He loved it. At first he watched for five minutes at a time. She played the video for him every day, and three months later he could watch it all. This is the only video that he can watch from start to finish without getting tired, and it is her son's favorite video.  My nephew also likes the narrator, smiles at her, and tries to talk to her and repeat what she says.  My sister said it is really helpful for her too, because while he watches the video she is able to cook and take a shower.

We are anxiously awaiting the next video.",1145232000,3,1009,4.180412371134021
2118293,2,B0002T46FY,"Based on the reviews, I purchased this DVD and was really diappointed.  Like a lot of the reviews I felt that my son was getting a little beyond the Baby Einstein DVDs.  This DVD is really unpolished and the women in the upper left hand corner is really distracting for my son. Additionally, the pace is a bit fast.  By this I mean that the woman in the upper left hand corner of the screen repeats what's going on in the screen but she does it really fast and the item in the main screen is flashed. I'm pretty quick, but watching the DVD with my child I though the items were flashing quickly so I can only imagine that my child wasn't getting it either. Five minutes into it, my son got up and left.  Such a disappointment and a waste of money.  The preschool prep DVDs are so much better, but unfortunately there are only 3 of them (shapes, numbers and letters).",1142726400,8,866,4.2560975609756095
2118294,5,B0002T46FY,"I bought this DVD for my 2 and 3 year old boys and was very impressed.  It's not flashy and polished, but it effectively teaches the basics (shapes, colors, large and small, letters etc.)  My boys were not only watching, but also interacting.  We just received it today and I'm looking forward to playing it for them once a day.",1142640000,5,328,4.433333333333334
2118295,5,B0002T46FY,"I have a three year old girl and a one year old boy and they were both captivated by the video.  More importantly, my daughter was engaging with the video and kept wanting to watch it more and more.  It is a far better product than the Baby Einstein videos, and I've seen them all.  Please make more!",1141603200,3,300,4.137931034482759
2118296,5,B0002T46FY,"I watched this DVD with my two sons, ages 4 years and 6 mos. My younger son was entertained by the Starlets and I even caught him laughing when something on the screen delighted him. (Incidentally, I've tried a Baby Einstein or two with both my babies and they never seemed to enjoy them. So I was so pleasantly surprised to see the positive reaction with Fundamentals.)  My 4 year old son was equally entranced with the DVD and watched it 3x in one sitting. He is working at preschool on putting concepts together (two red cars, three blue carts, etc.) and having that reiterated was very interesting to him.

I think that this is a terrific DVD for kiddos to learn in so many ways. The sing-song repetition and the friendly narrator are inviting as well so the kids stick with it and inevitably learn through this unique method. I highly recommend this DVD to help children understand more about this wonderful world of ours.",1095379200,5,927,4.578313253012048
2118297,5,B0002T46FY,"The First Wave ""Fundamentals"" DVD is an exceptional educational video for babies. In fact, my 8 month old son loves watching this DVD. As the title of the DVD punningly suggests, the style and content of the video make the learning process both fun and enjoyable for the baby.  For example, essential subjects such as the alphabet, numbers, shapes, and colors are presented in not only a visually stimulating manner, but usefully and informatively, as well.  The video also covers information such as parts of the body, and has an excellent section on phonics that encourages babies to learn how to speak and pronounce letters.  What is particularly appealing about the DVD is that it doesn't underestimate the ability and capacity of a baby to learn and retain information from a very early age.",1094947200,3,796,4.925373134328358
2118298,5,B0002T46FY,"My 16 month-year old was entranced by this educational video with captivating music. I was amazed it inspired my infant to speak. The video taught her colors, parts of her body, letters, and numbers. Now, when I ask her to point to ""blue"" versus ""red"", she always gets it right. My daughter now says over 220 words (including ""around"" ""door"" and ""purple""), words introduced in the video.  This video is perfect for the busy mom who wants to ensure her baby is exposed to many subjects and educated.",1094688000,,498,4.659090909090909
8031493,5,B0002T46FY,"Both my kids have watched this. Simple animation, music, pics. A repeat play option. I think it would be boring, but the young kids love it!",1395878400,,140,4.423076923076923
8031494,2,B0002T46FY,I was expecting a lively learning presentation or show but it turned out the opposite. True that there is a guide on the upper left corner of the screen but it seems repetitive & not lively enough to catch my daughter's attention. She got bored right away and didn't even finish watching the dvd :(,1363910400,,298,4.4363636363636365
8031495,1,B0002T46FY,"I thought this would be great for my son 4 to watch in the car, a little learning while we go to the store etc.  Well he would not watch it at all.  I sat and watched it to see why he didn't like it, it is very poorly made.  It is not engaging or fun for kids, with all the educational shows out now there are many better options to choose from, don't buy this one.",1355788800,,365,3.7142857142857144
8031496,5,B0002T46FY,"So I read the bad review and, (raise my right hand) thought EXACTLY THE SAME THING.  Boy was I wrong...

Rewind history.. my baby was about 8 months - hated this video.  Roll forward four months - he started LOVING Fundamentals, The First Wave, but hated this video.  Roll forward for months - he started LOVING this video.

Long story short; your child MUST have seen the Fundamentals The First Wave before seeing this one.  At first, to an adult, the video seems a bit bizzare and disjointed.  However, after watching the first, then the second videos with my son the thirtieth time (no, literally..), I started to see the method behind the madness.

At first, the first video seems too simplistic (ex. curve, dot, line for drawing).  The second video seems too difficult (ex. drawing full letters).  However, the first video is a ""set up"" to watch the second video.  The first video decomposes the difficult pieces of a concept, then the second video threads them together - ex. a ""p"" is drawn as curve-line, and an ""i"" is dot-line.

Also, I used to think that Melissa Neumann was a bit of an egocentric person, since her face is in just about every video frame.  I was wrong again.  My son was actually looking at her face to mouth words and pay better attention to the materials presented.

Summary - will this be the ONLY video in your child's educational collection?  No.  However, if you're serious about pre-preschool preparation for your little genius; this is an INDISPENSIBLE tool to fuse together abstract and difficult concepts for your baby (and yes, I do mean BABY) to master, in a fun and interesting way.

Does it work?  For my son, yes.  Was it the ONLY video he saw?  No, he had the benefit of numerous others, but this was definitely a ""mainstay video"" for almost two months solid (to the point I was late for work a few times because he refused to leave the car because THIS video was playing.  Go figure.

All I can say is ""thanks Melissa Neumann!""",1316304000,,1971,4.5685714285714285
8031497,5,B0002T46FY,"I own every Baby Einstein, Sesame Street, Dora, Disney etc etc video under the sun, and this is far-and-away my son's favorite one. He is just starting to speak, and he tries to mouth the letters of the alphabet along with the narrator. He also plays along when the video does body parts, and loves to go get his pots and pans from the kitchen when the narrator goes through the rooms in the house (including the kitchen). I can see that he is actually LEARNING from this video, and not just being distrated by colors, shapes and sounds.",1275523200,,537,4.434343434343434
8031498,5,B0002T46FY,i bought this for my daughter for christmas along with a sesame street dvd. she is 10 months old and as soon as i put this dvd on she stops whatever she is doing and watches the whole movie. she is a very active baby and never still from the time she wakes up untill she goes to sleep except when this dvd is on. she won't watch the sesame street one for more that a minute before she crawls off to play. i only let her watch it once a day becacuse i don't want her in front of a tv all day. it seems a little fast pase for children that young so i hope she is learning while watching i haven't seen her do anything like point to her eyes or ears and name them yet but maybe it will come. i have a 3 year old niece who also likes to watch. i would recomed this video,1264291200,,766,3.7639751552795033
8031499,5,B0002T46FY,"As a preschool teacher, I was delighted to find this DVD.  Never speaking down to its audience, the children in my class (ages 2) learned their letters, and numbers to 12.  Letter recognition is the beginning of reading, and the DVD taught letters in a number clever ways, including matching letters with objects that start with that letter and look like that letter.  Learning numbers and counting is the beginning of math, and the DVD taught both counting, and arithmetic through cute stories (playdates and stars).  It also taught many other age appropriate skills. I give it the highest rating, and would recommend it to any classroom of 2-3 year olds.",1239494400,,656,4.882882882882883
8031500,2,B0002T46FY,"I bought this item reading above 3 reviews. I am really disappointed by this dvd.
it is definitely not for kids below 4 yrs of age.
it does not even last for 1 hr and really not worth $15. i would pay $5 for this kind of dvd.
As the title says that i teaches addition and sentences is just not true.",1239148800,,299,3.838709677419355
8031501,4,B0002T46FY,"This is a great DVD for preschoolers. My four year old grandson loves it.
Fundamentals 1 & 2 are good learning tools. Sometimes the segment goes a bit too fast. Other than that I give it the highest recommendation.",1187222400,,214,4.512820512820513
8031502,5,B0002T46FY,"When I saw the box, I thought FUNDAMENTALS would be just another ""me-too"" baby video.  Instead, it is so unique, both FUNDAMENTALS and FUNDAMENTALS 2 are the only two videos we take on long trips for my 1 and 3 1/2 year olds.  They are the only videos to hold both my childrens' attention, given their age difference.  And, most importantly for me they are learning when watching it.",1158624000,2,383,4.521739130434782
