It is an amazing and productive way to foster team work and acceptance among students.  As a parent, I found Laughter Friends to be a great bonding tool with my son.  We have had so much fun and many laughs with this energetic brainchild of Laura Gentry!",1210550400,2,408,4.625
3166369,5,B001714GSI,"Laughter Yoga instructor Laura Gentry invites children to join in on the experience of Laughter Yoga. In the video 20 children -- boys and girls of various ages (from pre-school to approx. 12-years-old) participate in laughter yoga exercises. The group activities involve movement and sound. What could be better than getting exercise, feeling better, and interacting with others? This is natural for young children who love to play, act silly, dance and sing...but some older children become inhibited and embarrassed...(and that kind of attitude can dampen the rest of our lives!) This video is a great reminder to get up and move and interact and laugh. It can be used like a workout video or as activities to incorporate with your own children. I am a bit of a quiet, introspective person and it is not my usual routine to be exuberant and noisy and interactive -- however I came away with higher energy and a positive outlook when I allowed myself time to be silly and to laugh.",1209600000,8,983,4.822485207100592
3166370,5,B001714GSI,"I wholeheartedly recommend this beautifully done film by Laughing Laura and her wonderful young laughing friends!  Laura is such a lovely and pure spirit and she clearly understands children. This reasonably priced film has it all: an adorable cast in colorful costumes, exuberant laughter exercises, deep breathing, relaxation, positive messages, and catchy laughter songs. The music and artwork are stunningly congruent with the theme and very appropriate for children. Overall, it highlights the goodness and purity of intention behind Laughter Yoga.  I love it! Laughter Friends makes my heart sing!

I enjoyed the exercises so much that I bought the DVD to share with my adult friends, and to use as an icebreaker. It makes me laugh every time I play it.",1209081600,7,330,4.516666666666667

8264541,5,B001714GSI,My 3 1/2 year old and 15 month old had a blast wiggling and giggling to Laughing Laura and her laughter friends. Great DVD when it's cold outside and need to get them moving!,1390953600,2,174,4.147058823529412
8264542,3,B001714GSI,"I thought this would be good for my son, who I wanted to help get more exercising in part due to some anxiety he seemed to be having. I thought the laughing would be helpful in addition to exercise. I think there are definitely good things about this video--and my son may just be a little bit too young for it. It is not a lot of exercise, really, especially for my son who doesn't really follow very quickly, and will often miss an entire segment before he figures out what they are doing (the activities are not often well-described, and sometimes are not described at all except for a title flashed on the screen that he can't read). Since he doesn't already know the songs they sing, and again, can't read, the lyrics don't really help him sing along. I try to play along and facilitate/read for him, but the video does move quickly, and he will still miss a lot of the things. Some activities only last for 10 seconds or so, it seems! Maybe when he is older, he'll get more out of it.

For what it's worth, there doesn't seem to be much association with yoga, although that wasn't of big import for me. If it is for you, though, it is not very yoga-ish.",1361577600,2,1159,4.292237442922374
8264543,5,B001714GSI,"As a therapist and a fellow Laughter Yoga Leader, i have to say that this DVD is awesome & so are all of Laura's products.  Do yourself a favor & ""get your laugh on"" with ""Laughing Laura"".  It's not only fun, but it's great for your mental and physical health.  As we say in laughter yoga sessions: Very Good Yaaayyy!!",1330646400,2,318,4.266666666666667
8264544,5,B001714GSI,Shared your kids video with a severe autistic boy at LY session yesterday. It made him laugh and smile. Big breakthrough. He usually just keeps his head down - this helped to engage and delight him. Thanks,1276473600,2,205,4.5675675675675675
8264545,5,B001714GSI,"My daughter loves this DVD. She was about 2.5 years old when she first saw it.  Today, she is about 3.5 years old and she still loves it!  Normally, she was shy and very reserved when it came to dancing, or doing anything physical (in front of others).  But, she seemed to really like this DVD. From the first day that she saw it, she was up and moving and laughing in no time!  It was fun to watch her involved with this. I am also quite reserved and shy. Laura's DVD got me up and moving too!  I enjoyed her catchy tunes and my daughter did too.  I think that my daughter felt safe because there were many children on the DVD. She seemed to be intrigued with this. Also, I know, from my own (limited) studies in neuropsychology, that laughing is healthy for the body!  I realized that it was healthy for my toddler if I turned on the DVD and just went through the motions, sang and laughed.  Even if she doesn't do it with me, she seems to relax just by watching me.  Thanks, Laura, for your fun, healthy and engaging DVD!",1243728000,3,1024,4.183673469387755

This DVD is a refreshing experience, that gets children and fun-loving adults moving and feeling happy.  It is contagious!

I had a ball of joy with our 5 children ages 4-10.
They all got into it! Laughter is contagious and this dvd got us dancing and laughing to the easy to catch onto songs. Not only did we laugh but we shared precious time together.
The songs are well written, the packaging professional and Laura Shines as a Laughter leader.
This Dvd is a blessing to our family.",1216771200,2,387,4.173333333333333
