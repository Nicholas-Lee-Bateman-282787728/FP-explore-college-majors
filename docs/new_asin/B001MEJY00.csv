3695366,4,B001MEJY00,"Odd little film from `67 involving a traumatized boy in his late teens who is wheel-chair bound and undergoes shock therapy to stimulate him mentally and alleviate his condition so he can walk again. (`Sound harsh? Remember, it`s the 60`s, and shock treatment was popular...good times indeed). His rich parents want to vacation, so they send him off to his loving aunt, who`s an unmarried (though romantically involved) attractive professional who dotes on the boy, indulging his every whim. As it turns out, he CAN walk, and utilizes his 'disability' to take advantage, manipulate and abuse those around him. Bringing a new meaning to the phrase 'Handi-capable'. He`s sexually attracted to his aunt, and they begin a series of 'games' that start out innocently enough, and end up becoming anything but. Once he gets his aunt sexually aroused, she too becomes a victim of his dementia, ignoring her long-standing lover and career, and her life spirals downward quickly. I won`t add 'spoilers' beyond this point. Nonetheless, it`s an absorbing minor film with a gothic feel, shot in full screen, filmed in black and white, competently dubbed in English, and an enjoyable ride for those curious.
