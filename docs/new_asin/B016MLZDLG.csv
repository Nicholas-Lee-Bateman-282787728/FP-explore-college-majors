8736782,5,B016MLZDLG,"This documentary from film maker Conor Horgan (One Hundred Mornings) is a journey of gay rights in Ireland as seen through the experiences of the undoubted Queen of Ireland Rory ONeil aka Panti Bliss.

It uses archive material and footage filmed for the film to tell us his life story and the ups and downs of being gay in Ireland. We also have pieces from Senator David Norris  The first gay man in Ireland who still carries the torch of equality. Alongside the personal story we also get Irelands road to referendum on changing the constitution to allow gay marriage and the fanatical opposition from certain parts of society. The whole film holds together incredibly well and is in parts uplifting, moving, frustrating and very human.

The serious side to life is brought to the fore which is a real juxtaposition of the role of a drag queen, which as Rory ONeil explains is akin to that of an old time court jester  often saying the things that others steer away from, making fun of them and spreading mirth and joy. He is a marvellous man and I have to admit Panti Bliss is a stunning woman. He will brighten up any room that is lucky enough t have him/her grace it. A truly wonderful film and now I shall stop gushing and go and straighten up my mascara.",1458518400,5,1260,4.489082969432315
