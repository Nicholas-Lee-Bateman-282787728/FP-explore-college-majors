8592061,5,B00DD03T8O,"The format is great, I like that I can navigate through the menu and find the moves I want to recap on.  I'm learning both lead and follow, this does both. So happy days! Recommended",1469577600,,182,4.2
8592062,5,B00DD03T8O,"nice product, i would recommend it to everyone",1446249600,,46,4.875
8592063,5,B00DD03T8O,"If you have  Christian's first dvd Act-1 Beginner, an introduction to Kizomba, i can recommend  Act-2 Intermediate,as it will take you to the next level to becoming a good Kizomba dancer. Christian and his partner Shirene break down each step for the man and the lady into sections, which makes it very easy for you  to practice and  learn. Even if you do go to classes why not purchase this dvd, have some fun in the comfort of your own home learning and building your confidence, then get on the dance floor and enjoy dancing Kizomba.",1431388800,2,536,4.552083333333333
8592064,1,B00DD03T8O,"VERY DISGUSTED!!! First, the dvds were not stabilized in cover, thus, the second dvd is scratched and will start then stop. It will not play. Tried several times. The dvd is boring and the couple make me want to dooze off to sleep. The steps are nothing like the Kizomba youTube videos I have viewed. A WASTE OF MY HARD EARNED MONEY!",1427068800,,333,4.387096774193548
8592065,3,B00DD03T8O,Good but short,1422835200,,14,4.0
8592066,5,B00DD03T8O,"There are many Kizomba DVD's to choose from, but for me, I loved Act 1 and highly recommend it for beginners as it has very clear instructions and was easy to follow and understand. Now Act 2 doesn't disappoint. For those who would like to progress from ACT1 and for those who would like to improve their Kizomba technique and add eye catching and unique moves to their dance, this DVD is a must have. Once again as ACT 1, very clear step by step instructions making it very easy to follow for both men and women. I totally loved it and would highly recommend it.",1415232000,,563,4.320754716981132
8592067,1,B00DD03T8O,Not enough on the DVD too short it only last 5 minute in total,1408320000,2,62,3.5
8592068,5,B00DD03T8O,"Early this year I was introduced to Kizomba while at a Salsa Cruise (dancefun.com). This is a great and sensual dance that when others see it done on the dance floor the only thing they can say is ""Wow, that looks so beautiful!""

There are a lot of tutorials on Youtube and the Internet but none is as good on explaining the different weight shifts and other things that are needed to dance it well. I've been dancing Salsa, Cha Cha Cha and others for years and didn't find Kizomba easy to learn, but the DVD Act 1 work as a great foundation and this Act 2 enhanced it further.",1403222400,5,577,4.245454545454545
