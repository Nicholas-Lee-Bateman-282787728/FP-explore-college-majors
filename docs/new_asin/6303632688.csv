7851838,4,6303632688,"Bill Mumy does a credible job narrating this documentary of Apollo 13. Lots of interviews with NASA people and the astronauts, plus a lot of good original footage.  Good to add to your Apollo 13 collection and the price is right.  Haven't seen it on DVD yet.",1304812800,,258,4.468085106382978
