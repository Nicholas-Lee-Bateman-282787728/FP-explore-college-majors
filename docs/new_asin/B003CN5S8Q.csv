4109823,5,B003CN5S8Q,"One of the best WWII adaptations I've seen. This series made me a fan of actors previously unknown to me, like Damien lewis and Scott Grimes. Known actors like Ron Livingston and Neal Mcdonough give the performances of their careers. The box set arrived in excellent condition, no problems whatsoever. It also arrived about 3-4 days faster than I expected.",1289606400,,356,4.95
4109824,5,B003CN5S8Q,"This series (sometimes I refer to it as a movie so forgive me if I do), is the best documentary on World War II ever. Hands down, it has comedy, tradgedy, a love story among other things... Everything you need to make a good movie, but it is put together in this mini-series that tastefully, but graphicly shows what it was for the allied troops in WWII.

Of course the 2-3 episodes are all excitement and everything. The first gives a lot to the story of how they came to be the best. 4-the end are a bit harder to watch, not because it's not entertaining, but because to see how things were for them. Bastone (spelling?) really emotional.  The concentration camp is the hardest in my opinion just for the fact of what it is.

Overall 10/5 stars. I had seen this time and time again before buying this on a goldbox deal. I have watched it once since, and will watch it again and again.

Last bit, this review doesn't have the verified amazon purchase tag because I ordered this off of my Amazon app on my iPod, I did order this off Amazon, and was more than happy with the shipping/price that I got it for. Now I just have to get around to purchasing The Pacific.",1288828800,,1164,4.277272727272727
4109825,5,B003CN5S8Q,"Very entertainin & informatve dramatic epic WWII story.  Tying the real life personal interviews to the characters is super.  It's nice playing the picture in picture personal interviews - lends a great deal of depth and realism to the events you watch unfolding in the movie.  The Blu-ray video quality is super.  Audio is also great.  Incoming shells, bullets are bouncing off the walls - wow.  You just don't watch the movie-you experience it!  It's worth every penny!",1288137600,,471,4.961538461538462
4109826,5,B003CN5S8Q,This was the absolute best mini series I have ever watched! Nothing comes close. I've watched it over 5 times and I could easily watch it again.,1286928000,,144,4.37037037037037
4109827,5,B003CN5S8Q,"I can't add anything to the comments already made about this wonderful HBO series.  It's outstanding and should be a part of anyone's DVD movie collection.  Highly recommended, especially for those interested in WWII history.  All A+++++++",1280188800,,239,5.405405405405405
4109828,4,B003CN5S8Q,I've seen this serie three times on HBO and I want to see this on DVD.,1279756800,,70,3.4375

4109830,5,B003CN5S8Q,The DVD came within just a few days and was exactly what I wanted.  My husband was thrilled to have it.,1278374400,,103,3.9047619047619047
4109831,5,B003CN5S8Q,this story invites you into the minds and hearts of some very fine people called to serve and fight in world war II.  I felt a measure of what they did and at the same time came to realize what a touch and go thing the allied victory really was.  It also made me understand the large measure of graditude we all owe the vets who are very much just like us.  Like all of us except for the fact they stoodup for their country and for basic human decency.  They demonstrated strength and endurance I doubt they knew they had and they changed the world by being there for us at a time when the world was going mad.,1277683200,,610,4.058333333333334
4109832,5,B003CN5S8Q,"If you enjoy any war movies, especially Saving Private Ryan, this series should be the next thing you watch. The blu-ray version of this series is beautiful. The grainy film looks amazing on this version. The whole series takes on new life. I watch this series once a year and have ever since it came out on VHS (at that time my neighbor handed it to me one day and said, ""Go watch this.""). I consider this a must own blu-ray boxset along with The Godfather trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, The Bourne trilogy, the Oceans trilogy, and The Dark Knight trilogy.

Disclaimer: This movie will make you feel a thousand times more patriotic and appreciative. A great reminder of why we should be thankful for the privilege of living here.",1387756800,2,731,4.537878787878788
4109833,5,B003CN5S8Q,"But you already know that.

This version is a very good mastering of the series and should be in every household that has an interest in Modern Military History.  You won't be dissappointed.",1360281600,,190,4.7272727272727275

4109836,5,B003CN5S8Q,My son wanted this for his seventeenth birthday this year.  He thinks it is the best war movie made.  Enjoy!,1352246400,,108,4.35
4109837,5,B003CN5S8Q,"This show was wonderful on HBO, but now that it is on blu-ray it is absolutely stunning. I highly recommend you buy this if you like any sort of war or action film.",1337299200,,164,4.0
4109838,3,B003CN5S8Q,"Everyting was find other than I didn't recieve my full order, I am missing disc one adn the pacidfic part one on blu-ray, very dissapointing to open my new collection and be missing the first disc",1315094400,,196,4.472222222222222

4109840,5,B003CN5S8Q,The best story of WWII ever told.  Historically accurate and narrated by the soldiers themselves. Sounds and visuals are just like real. The emotions you feel are real.,1308268800,,168,5.0
4109841,5,B003CN5S8Q,"An outstanding series.  Each episode is worthy of its own place as a great film.

4109843,5,B003CN5S8Q,I was very pleased with this purchase.  It was a Christmas present for my boyfriend and he simply loves it.,1293840000,,107,4.35
4109844,5,B003CN5S8Q,"This is one of the best miniseries I have seen. I purchased band of brothers for my husband and now I'm hooked! Who knew! My husband is a WWII buff and thinks this series is fantastic. I don't usually like War movies or stories, but this is the exception!  I ordered through Amazon and received it very quickly. It even came with the first episode of the Pacific. What a bonus! It was priced cheaper than in any of the leading stores. I will definitely be ordering more blu Ray discs from Amazon in the future.",1293753600,,510,4.3125
4109845,4,B003CN5S8Q,"This is a fantastic tribute to the Greatest Generation. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend you do. The price was exceptional as well. Thanks Amazon.",1290470400,,156,4.814814814814815
4109846,5,B003CN5S8Q,"I am a big fan of the HBO Band of Brothers series and I was prompted to purchase Pacific without ever seeing the series. I was not disappointed. Pacific is a reality check on just how hard the War was for our Marines. Outstanding, do not miss out on owning these series.",1290211200,2,270,4.211538461538462
4109847,5,B003CN5S8Q,The filming was excellent. It is so nice to see all of the film without waiting for a weekly show. The service was fast and dependable. It was also a deciding factor to be able to get ALL of the discs at one time. Having to buy discs individually and not consecutively puts me off and I will not order that way again. Never one disc monthly etc.,1289952000,,345,4.088235294117647
4109848,5,B003CN5S8Q,"If you like war movies such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", this series is a must have. Been waiting a long time for it to go on sale, when it did on Amazon, I picked it up immediately.",1289865600,,179,3.864864864864865
4109849,5,B003CN5S8Q,"then they release this series on Blu-ray.  It might be a bit of hyperbole, but I think BOB is perhaps the best mini-series ever made--perhaps the best television series ever.  The writing, acting, directing and photography is wonderful.  I bought the regular series on DVD sometime back--then I watched the first episode on Blu-ray and was captivated.  The level of detail that you can see in the Blu-ray is much better than the regular DVD.  I highly recommend BOB on Blu-ray.
The Pacific, too, was technically very good.  But, I was a little disappointed in the first episode.  Judging from the reviews of my friends, it sounds as though the rest of the series is pretty good--but not on a par with BOB.",1289865600,3,705,4.682926829268292

The bonus disc came as a blueray which was a let down since i do not yet own a player. I don't understand why it was sent as blueray since i ordered the series in dvd. Oh well, its a bone us.",1454025600,,310,3.6417910447761193
