8108287,3,B000EBGFR2,"Good, but not completely satisfying mix of older western traditions and modern smalltown organized crime. The direction and ideas flow pretty easily at the start, but in the final half hour, it seems to run out of steam. The final showdown almost felt like an obligation, rather than a much anticipated climax.",1440201600,,310,4.980769230769231

8108289,1,B000EBGFR2,This was low budget garbage and only in my stoner days could this be enjoyed. Some funny parts; but really you are unamerican to take time out to watch this during a recession! You could have filmed this yourself in the backyard with a cell phone.,1289952000,,247,4.391304347826087
8108290,5,B000EBGFR2,An indie film of remarkable caliber.  A successful cinematic experiment combining unique comic-book artistry with classic western conventions... an obvious ode to Sergio Leone.,1175126400,4,176,6.333333333333333
8108291,5,B000EBGFR2,"This is a verry good independent film I give it a 5 star raiting b/c it's a comic feel to it and each charracter has a passed that connects to Sonny King! Like Iron Joe, Buddy Colt, and Danny Strong. Hired by the original leader of the ""Judges"" then was over thrown by Sonny King, ask help threw theses men three men to come back and take over the town and restore order. Not for peace but for good and not evil. You have to decied what side you belong to eaither good or evil. This is diffently the best preformance for DJ Perry and Terry Jerrnigan in thier work for this film as well in Wicked Spring, it seems like they can't never get a long by always beeing enemys to each other in there movies lol. But overall it's a verry good film I like it a lot.

5 stars!",1157587200,,766,4.0394736842105265
8108292,3,B000EBGFR2,"Judges is a very unique film. Mixing in a comic book feel with Western and with an old fashioned story line of good vs evil. The actors were great, I especially liked DJ Perry because he carried a strong presence on screen and he played a suave character. The color schemes used in the film were perfect and it really caught my attention and the western music/the score &  background music was just icing on the cake.",1146787200,7,417,4.415584415584416
