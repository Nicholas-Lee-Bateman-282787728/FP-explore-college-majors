5741662,5,B00CU6WBRW,"Its good to see a film that doesn't stereotype in the way that many gay and lesbian films do. I liked that the focus wasn't on the sexuality but the actual storyline.

The film was interesting, and had a good twist at the end. The film is also very picturesque.",1374624000,,261,4.22
5741663,5,B00CU6WBRW,Great twist and dark! I adored The Adored. Nice to see a really good British film. Can't wait for another one,1374624000,,109,4.238095238095238
5741664,5,B00CU6WBRW,I think the tension that builds throughout the movie is incredibly intelligent. The performances of the actors is a testament to the writing and direction of what is a rather emotional journey.,1374537600,3,193,5.0625
5741665,1,B00CU6WBRW,WHY AREN'T THERE ANY NEW LESBIAN LOVE STORIES.  A BIZARRE MOVIE.  I DIDN'T FIND ANY ROMANCE OR TENSION BUILDING BETWEEN THE WOMEN.  STRANGE!,1383868800,2,140,5.0
5741666,1,B00CU6WBRW,Don't waste your money. I stopped watching it about 20 mins in. Horrible.  I am always looking for lesbian flicks. Glad it was a rental and not a DVD I invested in.,1383091200,,164,4.125
5741667,2,B00CU6WBRW,I will not see this again. A waste of time and money. It could have been a better storyline. Don't waste your time with this movie.,1381622400,,131,4.076923076923077
5741668,4,B00CU6WBRW,The movie itself was pretty good..although a little slow moving. Had great soundtrack in the movie. Does anyone know who the Musician singing the song in the beginning of the movie? Great song.,1380931200,,193,4.878787878787879
5741669,5,B00CU6WBRW,"Great script, incredible ending. This is where the common film departs the common story, where the start, middle and ending are the same..",1380412800,,138,5.043478260869565
5741670,3,B00CU6WBRW,"I get what the writers, director, etc were going for in this movie, but I'm not sure if they pulled it off.
There was obviously a little build-up of suspense, which was great. But it did become a bit tedious as Maia, the model, was just TOO naive. She didn't seem to pick up on anything that was going on, which was odd because Frankie, the photographer, did a really good job of being just creepy/seductive enough to raise some red flags.
If the audience could see it, she should have been able to see it. So the fact that things kept plodding along as usual was unrealistic to me.
The other plot line with the therapy session was fine, I suppose, but it didn't add enough. Having seen the movie, I know why it was set up that way, but it could have been done much better.
Overall, this doesn't qualify to be a REAL thriller. I love the ambiguity and unanswered questions they threw in, but that alone isn't enough to make it good enough to recommend.",1379030400,6,952,4.324022346368715
5741671,3,B00CU6WBRW,"first half was intriguing but led to absolutely nowhere.  Ending was disappointing.
Not suspenseful or thrilling, just dark and a bit of a mystery.",1377648000,,147,5.125
5741672,5,B00CU6WBRW,"this was an entertaining rental.  It had interesting characters and a thrilling plot.  Though it was thrilling, it was not suspenseful.  So, it was definitely a romance/thriller.  definitely wasn't watching the clock.",1377302400,,217,5.6875
5741673,4,B00CU6WBRW,the film was too much over the top with flashbacks with the 'male lead' not enough of the female leads.,1376784000,,103,4.2
5741674,5,B00CU6WBRW,"I liked the tension that builds from the outset - keeps you watching, curious about where this one will go.  The characters have the depth that makes you want to meet them to find out more about them!  If you like films that don't simply pick up on stereotypes and recycle over used formulaic story lines then you'll enjoy this one.",1375833600,,332,4.426229508196721
8586407,1,B00CU6WBRW,The only thing that would bring this rating up a notch is if they all 3 went off the cliff!!,1465084800,,92,3.65
8586408,1,B00CU6WBRW,"I thought this was a horrible movie. Why are so many lesbian focus movies focused on drama, craziness,etc ?",1458604800,,107,4.684210526315789
8586409,1,B00CU6WBRW,Very slow movie without argument. I didn't like it,1437523200,,50,4.666666666666667
8586410,1,B00CU6WBRW,Wack ending,1436400000,,11,5.0
8586411,3,B00CU6WBRW,"Maia (Ione Butler) is a model who wants to remake herself. She trust herself to Frankie (Laura Martin-Simpson) a photographer who takes her to her secluded home own by the Shellys. Frankie is compulsively meticulous. She has desires for Maia who she convinces to spend the weekend.

Maia is having issue with her husband and says, ""I need my space."" We know what that means guys. Meanwhile there is a subplot of a man (Jake Maskall) talking to a transgender looking psychologist (Caroline Burns Cooke) about life and love. He is apparently connected to one of the two women, but we don't know who or how.

The film consists mostly of Frankie attempting to seduce Maia, interrupted by a guy talking to a shrink. The production awkwardly comes together at the end.

The acting was fair. The story didn't move. I didn't really care about any of the characters. I enjoyed watching Frankie putting everything back in its place after Maia moved it an inch...and the fact she sleeps nude.

A mediocre Indie stye rental.

8586412,2,B00CU6WBRW,Really?,1408924800,,7,7.0
8586413,5,B00CU6WBRW,"the taught passing of this film gives some of the more obvious points of the plot line real life... the director lets you really feel the tension all ready there in the primary relationship and building in the secondary relationship... we have seen a lot of love triangles before but this is different in so many ways.... i will be a good internet citizen and not blow spoilers at you but it does make it difficult to tell you why this film is worth your time and money.

The relationships are believable and well developed they don't just plop up on the screen and leave you saying what the hell.... i liked it so much that i bought it and so many days after still feel no buyers remorse",1407715200,,688,4.333333333333333
