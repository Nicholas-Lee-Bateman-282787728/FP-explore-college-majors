2761396,5,B000N8UY1Y,Aside from Transformers I am an El Mongo fan of Ed Edd n Eddy. I just love this show. All the characters always make me laugh. I wish Cartoon Network would have a contest where you could be on the show (or at least being animated into a character). All my friends and I love this show and we can't get enough of em. I hope that they return for a sixth season. I also hope they make one as a refrence to Indiana Jones (like Indiana Ed or Ediana Jones etc). There is an Movie coming out where they try to find Eddy's older brother (who  is the only unseen character aside from the adults hands). So I GOT to get these die hard funny movies. ED EDD N EDDY BOOO YEAHHHHH!!!,1223942400,,669,4.030075187969925
