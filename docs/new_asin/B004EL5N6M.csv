8427190,3,B004EL5N6M,"This movie begins as a romance, when Ayaan (Salman Khan) meets model Ahana (Shilpa Shetty) and falls in love with her. After finding her diary, he woos and marries her with the help of the information her diary provides. Then the movie becomes a domestic drama, with their marriage on the rocks--with the diary as the apex--and the viewer is left wondering if love will be enough to reconcile them.

The plot starts off interesting, but after a while, the arguments become tiresome. The resolution happens too quickly, and is not fully believable. Khan goes from charming to stubborn well, but the viewer will be conflicted as to whether he is in the right. Ahana's character is too spoiled and sullen to be fully likable; whether this is the fault of the actress or the writing is uncertain. There are some quite good songs, but the choreography is below average. Overall, this is an okay movie, but not one I would universally recommend.",1501804800,,939,4.7607361963190185

It wasn't recorded as I excpected",1356220800,,113,3.9565217391304346

And not as described of the recording studio.  They did return my money",1349654400,,132,4.28
