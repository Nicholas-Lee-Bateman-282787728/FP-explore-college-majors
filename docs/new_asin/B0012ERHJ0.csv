8245722,4,B0012ERHJ0,"This triple pack was supposed to contain three DVDs, The King and I, The Sound of Music, and Oklahoma.  However, Oklahoma had been replaced with South Pacific, which is also a Rogers & Hammerstein production.  Each of these movies makes its own statement, but being a native son of Oklahoma, I was disappointed that it had been replaced with South Pacific.  I have particularly enjoyed The sound of Music since it contains some very good music as well as the story Trapp which made its way to the USA during World War II.",1398211200,2,521,4.580645161290323
8245723,5,B0012ERHJ0,"Three of their greatest. Great music, fun to watch repeatedly. Keep in workroom to watch while I sew & knit",1391558400,,107,4.4
8245724,4,B0012ERHJ0,"The DVDs and packaging were in excellent condition and arrived when expected.  The manufacturer had recorded the movies with a narrow-top-to-bottom screen to ""preserve the body ratio"" or something like that.  It is difficult to watch a narrow screen...it looks like you're looking at a preview.  Not the sender's fault but a nuisance.  I'd be happy to order from this seller again.",1390694400,2,381,5.096774193548387
