4287597,5,B00498BKXU,"I ordered this DVD set for my 13 month son at the time. He loves this set. After two days watching first DVD, he started signing for ""drink"" and ""more"". I was surprized how quick he picked up. He is now 20 months old and still these are his favorate DVDs. I also bought Wordworld but he prefer to watch signing time. So I ordered signing time practice which teach him ABCs and 123s but he doesn't like to watch it too long. Maybe he is too young for that. Before he started watching this, I let him watch ""your baby can read"" since he was 3 month old. No, he didn't learn how to read but, he learned all his body parts from that DVDs. I don't play after we got signing time but he still knows all his body parts. Our family was impressed that he knows all his body parts at 8 month. Another DVD he really likes is ""Letter factory"" but not as much as signing time. Anyways, I would highly recommend this to every mom who wants to communicate with their little one.",1352419200,4,963,4.127659574468085
4287598,4,B00498BKXU,"I bought these when my daughter was about 4 months. We have only watched the 1st DVD so far, so that is why I have only rated this as 4 stars. My daughter loves watching the other babies' faces, so this signing video definitely keeps her attention, much more so than the animated baby sign flash cards we play with on my iPad from time to time. Your baby will learn the signs faster if you watch the video and sign along with him or her. For instance, during the song about drinking, I always have a glass of water near by and am sure to sign to her that 'mommy is drinking water' while the video is playing the 'drink' song. So yes, you should watch this video with your children so you can lean the signs and use them with baby, I try to avoid using this video as ababy sitter, although it sure is tempting sometimes. If she loves the other DVDs as much as the first, this will be a 5 star product.

UPDATE: It's official - these DVDs are awesome! My daughter just turned 7 months old and started signing 'milk' to me this week while she was drinking a bottle. Now I can ask her by signing if she wants milk and if she doesn't she just looks at me, but if she does she signs milk back to me. It is so amazing that she can communicate with me now on some level. She gets really excited now everytime we watch one of the DVDs.",1352332800,27,1326,4.061068702290076
4287599,5,B00498BKXU,These DVDs are awesome ... My niece is 2 years old and she knows over 200 signs she also can speak over 200 words these DVDs really help I would recommend them to everyone,1513641600,,171,4.0588235294117645

4287602,5,B00498BKXU,Perfect tool for you and your child development. My son is 15m and is enhacing his assosiation skills with things animails and better expressing him self. He used to cry when he was hungry or thirsty. Now he simply signs it and we understand him better. This is a great investment every parent should make. The baby sings also enhace recall. I am teachng my son animals and sounds and actions. Having these videos are great. Lot's of sing-alongs.,1502323200,2,446,4.658227848101266
4287603,5,B00498BKXU,"My baby is only 5 months, so no signing yet, but we absolutely love these videos. I know the professionals recommend no TV before age 2, but I always watch it with him and keep it interactive and engaging by singing and signing along with the video. I can't wait until he starts signing back! The songs are so catchy and fun! Highly recommended!

Update: Baby is 13 months old and knows a handful of signs - more, wash hands, all done, and eat. He recently started pointing at the remote and TV and signing more. The only time our TV is on is once or twice a week when we watch Signing Time, so hes definitely signing that he wants to watch Signing Time! Very cool!",1501372800,,665,4.2362204724409445

4287607,5,B00498BKXU,"These videos are adorable and well-made with catchy songs that kids love. My daughter started watching them when she was about one year, and immediately started signing. The songs reallly helped to reinforce the signs for her.

Thanks to these videos she prob had around 100 signs in her vocabulary within a very short period of time. Now at four years old, she still signs--especially when she is shy and doesn't want to speak OR when she thinks I'm not listening and she wants to make a point. Haha Love all four of these videos and look forward to showing them to our four month old very soon!",1486339200,3,596,4.518518518518518
4287608,5,B00498BKXU,Awesome series.  My non-verbal young toddler has picked up so many signs and has increased her ability to communicate with the rest of the family.  They have songs and signs that are age appropriate.  Would highly recommend this series for younger kids (older too because they can use it as well).,1484697600,,297,4.784313725490196
4287609,5,B00498BKXU,"I have been using these DVD's since my daughter was about 6 months.  She is 2 now and I'm telling you, this is such a great investment in your child!  They taught my baby how to communicate before she could speak.  I largely attribute these to her being such a happy baby and so smart!  It really reduces the frustration of you and baby not being able to communicate.  Everyone who has a baby should get these and show them to your child.  They are so easy to learn, even if you do not know any sign language.  You learn with them!  I would give it 10 stars if I could!",1484524800,,569,4.063063063063063

4287611,5,B00498BKXU,"My almost two-year-old twin babies are completely obsessed with these DVDs.  We hear the baby girl on the monitor as soon as she wakes up signing the theme song, ""baby, baby...""  Soon as she's up, she starts begging ""Leah! Leah!"" until we put a DVD on.  So, that's good and bad, and a little scary at times.

The songs are really pretty clever and not annoying at all on the first couple of listens, though they are getting more and more wearing as we're entering the hundreds and hundreds of replays realm.  Fragments of the songs are in our heads all day long.  I've been up at nights staring at the ceiling with the same lyrical line on repeat for hours.

The whole tone of the series is great and Rachel seems like a totally awesome person, although possibly slightly insane.  Reviews online indicate that actual ASL users take exception to some of the signing, and the fact that it's sign language put to music (which deaf people can't enjoy), and the fact that it's ASL used for profit... I even read someone complaining about the fact Leah got cochlear implants (please).  But whatever...

I would recommend these to anyone with little children, just be prepared for potential disturbances to your own sanity.",1480464000,,1216,4.666666666666667
4287612,5,B00498BKXU,She does a great job. Every morning my son and I watch this to learn. It is a great way to learn sign language. I like that you get the CD as well. The signs are easy to follow if you are learning with your kiddo.,1480118400,,213,3.652173913043478
4287613,5,B00498BKXU,"I love this series. Two Little Hands did this exactly right! My, now 18 month old, has had a word explosion after his first birthday. I purchase the full online library(directly from TLH) and do not regret it one bit. We watch a few episodes a week, and my son can recognize colors, letters, and numbers. He signs over 100 words and rarely has frustrated melt downs. I can not recommend this program enough.
  I am even looking into becoming a certified instructor!",1480118400,,465,4.590361445783133
4287614,5,B00498BKXU,I highly recommend these DVDs if you are interested in teaching your child sign language! My daughter is 16 months and uses all of the signs from these DVDs and requests to watch them daily.,1477699200,,190,4.457142857142857
4287615,5,B00498BKXU,I cant tell if my daughter is getting much from these dvds yet since we just started. She does love watching them though. Theyre very cute and match with asl so easy for transition if she decides to stick with it. Overall happy as if shes tired she can get a good nap in.

4287619,3,B00498BKXU,Every baby is different. I love the videos and catchy songs but my son still prefers baby Einstein's. I still put baby signing time on though and he will watch a few minutes here and there and dance along. Great product and worth a shot!,1465776000,,237,4.288888888888889
4287620,5,B00498BKXU,"Wonderful program. I bought this as a gift for a friend, after observing 2 grandsons learn how to sign before they could speak.  Very engaging.  The boys wanted to watch if over and over.  It was so encouraging to know that they could communicate their needs, even before they could speak.  Would highly recommend Baby Signing Time.\!",1464998400,,334,4.807017543859649

Hopefully he'll pick up some signs. I know I learned them super easy lol If anything it's great educational entertainment so you can eat a meal or take a quick shower haha,1462838400,,326,4.158730158730159
4287623,5,B00498BKXU,"My daughter is 13 months and isn't allowed to watch really any TV except for Baby Signing Time.  I purchased this set for my daughter for Christmas after visiting with a friend whose almost two year old could communicate SO well with signs.  I couldn't believe all the things he could say through signs that other children that age just couldn't say with words.  I own and operate an in-home child care, so I am now teaching the signs to the children in my care of all ages.  It can never hurt a child to have multiple ways of expressing their thoughts!

My daughter was slow to pick up the signs from about 10-12 months, but ever since then, she has been learning about 2 new signs a week, and I'm sure she can understand a lot more of them than what she will actually sign back.  She amazes people with her abilities and it has definitely not impeded upon her ability to speak.  She amazes people with her manners as she loves to say ""please,"" ""thank you,"" ""you're welcome,"" as well as many other words.  I believe Baby Signing Time has just helped her communicate through signs and taught her new words we may not have taught her yet (ball, boat, train, etc.) had we not watched the videos with her.

I love that the set comes with CDs as well so we could just listen to the songs once we are very familiar with the signs and continue our learning that way.  All babies should learn sign language!  It's so invaluable!",1459641600,7,1421,4.365019011406844
4287624,5,B00498BKXU,My first baby picked right up on signing and we loved that ability to communicate so young. My second is 8 months now and he just lights up when he watches it. Perfect for 6 months and up. The songs are cute and my toddler will still sing them at random till this day! Highly recommend these DVD for any baby- toddler,1456876800,2,317,4.129032258064516
4287625,5,B00498BKXU,"If you are looking for a signing series for children that gives the foundational and functional vocabulary to your child, look no further.  Rachel and the baby signing times videos makes it easy for parent and child to develop together.  Each video is full of songs and signs made simple.  The real-people showing the modified signs they use show there is no perfect way to sign these signs as babies.  The songs are so amazingly catchy you find yourself singing along with you hands and voice.  As a teacher of the deaf, I found these useful with my younger students but I purchased it for my own baby.

My son took his time with the videos.  He didn't initially want to sign, he would just watch and dance to the music. I continued the path of showing the video once a day.  What I noticed is he would respond to the signs before he ever attempted to sign one time.  If I signed milk to him, he would become excited and happily drank.  Soon, he began to sign things he really wanted: cracker, milk, drink, eat, mommy.  He cried less because he was able to communicate and be understood.  Once he started talking, he used signing less but he still at age 3.5 still remembers the signs and uses them when he wants.

I highly suggest using it with your baby.  Less frustration and it's wonderful watching their language develop well before they are able to speak.",1456790400,7,1362,4.461538461538462

4287629,5,B00498BKXU,"I was initially introduced to Signing Time (the older production DVDs) but tried switching to these because our then 11-month-old didn't seem very into the older versions. I was skeptical at first, but after sticking with it for the past 5 months, I have truly been amazed at how these have helped our son pick up everyday, helpful signs. I HIGHLY recommend these and would encourage parents to keep using them even if at first your child doesn't seem that interested. Now, our son asks (using signs) for baby signing time every day, and it is the only screen time he gets and LOVES it. It's amazing to see him (now 19 months) be able to communicate his wants, needs, and what he sees going on in the world around him using signs. I also think it has helped a ton with reducing toddler frustrations from not being able to communicate. Truly can't say enough about how happy we are to have stuck with these DVDs, and will absolutely be using them (probably starting even earlier!) with our next child coming in March. A very rewarding investment, and very thankful to friends who introduced us to this series. I nerve write reviews, but this has been so fabulous for our little guy that I felt like I had to!",1449792000,,1207,4.5159817351598175

These DVDs are educational if done correctly using flash cards, child is engaged, care taker is interacting in sign language in a fun up beat manner. If the child is not interested or engaged in watching the DVD do something else and try later or in a few days, don't force a child or they will lose interest, learning should be fun.",1447286400,,497,4.472527472527473

4287633,5,B00498BKXU,"These were recommended to me by someone I know. I was hesitant because it wasn't cheap, but took the plunge and I'm glad I did.  My 8 month old loves them and sometimes, it's the only thing that calms her down when she is having a meltdown.  I don't feel guilty putting her in front of it because it's educational and I'm learning the signs with her.",1446336000,,350,4.208955223880597
4287634,5,B00498BKXU,I purchased this collection for my nieces boy who has Downs Syndrome.  He just turned 2 years old and also attending a pre-school that has been using the same ones.

Added bonus is that his sister who is 5 years old is also learning so she can sign with her brother.  It's been a wonderful gift for the whole family.,1446249600,3,423,4.185185185185185

4287636,5,B00498BKXU,"I am so thankful for these DVD's. My daughter loves them and is signing like crazy at 16 months. She doesn't have a huge vocabulary yet and these DVDs have given her the ability to communicate things that she is not yet able to vocalize.  She signs for ""baby signing time"" when she wants to watch them or listen to the CD's.  I can't help but think about all the wonderful ""conversations"" with her I would be missing out on if I hadn't purchased these.  Because of these materials, I have insight into what she is thinking about, what reaches her and makes an impression on her.  We are a family that sings a lot and the songs, cartoons, and real kids using the signs is the perfect combination for her to stay interested and learn something new every time we watch one. CDs are great for being in the car and help to calm her when she's getting bored. Best purchase I have made for her!",1440115200,,887,4.293413173652695

A little pricey but worth it to me since my daughter has hearing loss. Both children have learned a ton of signs from Rachel and our communication has been such a blessing.

4287652,5,B00498BKXU,My daughter loves these movies she is very vocal and signs a lot to she refers them as baby signing but she puts two and two together especially if they sing about things she connects  it to her life. Would recommend for anyone with children 1-5 years. We use it as a reward because I don't believe in cartoons babysitting my children but its amazing what you can get a two year old to do as far as picking up toys or finishing dinner if she knows that the end result is watching an episode of baby signing time.

I personally was super excited about these, even if they were way overpriced but unfortunately I was the only person in the house excited.  Perhaps my years of sign language courses and my passion for speech pathology made me blindingly optimistic. These are the least used dvds is my house, when on my toddler loses interest in the tv (rare) and my hubby is complaining.

4287664,5,B00498BKXU,"These have been amazing.  Although I really tried not to let our little guy watch much television, we started using these several months ago as a way to entertain him when he would wake up ready to party at 5:00am every day and mommy and daddy needed just a little more sleep.  We found that he gained so much from watching these that we still let him watch almost every day (although if it were up to him, we would have them playing ALL DAY EVERY DAY).  :-)

The songs are catchy (annoyingly so)  :-), the images of other kids and little cartoons completely captivate my son, and most importantly it truly teaches him to sign.  At 20 months, he regularly uses about 50 signs and continues to learn more every week.  It's also helped his vocabulary as the words on these DVDs are most of the first ones he learned to speak.

This has also been an incredibly helpful tool as a parent because he can communicate with us even when he isn't yet capable of saying a word or pronouncing it in a way that we can understand... and because these DVDs focus on many of the everyday words that are a part of a child's life (like mom, dad, apple, juice, hurt, outside, car, train, eat, drink, milk, more, etc), it made ALL of our lives easier because he had a way to express them before he was able to do so verbally.

I can't say enough about these.  If you buy them and watch them with your child so that you can also learn the signs and help your kiddo to learn them, your child will absolutely learn to sign.",1408492800,11,1500,4.25

His vocabulary is unbelievable, well above and beyond his peers. When we went for his 1yr wellness visit they asked if he was saying a few words and he was saying a few dozen by then and is now saying full sentences. Our favorite part is that it is an adult talking like an adult rather than silly nonsense talk like other kids videos. Yet it is still fun and entertaining with lots of silly things and songs that will make your little one giggle and sing along.",1402444800,,606,4.324561403508772

It was unfortunate that during his colicky period of about 10 months, he wasn't able to communicate, which was my initial hope when I bought these DVD's.

4287679,5,B00498BKXU,"My 10 month old son is in love with these videos. Cartoons cannot keep his attention for more than a minute, but he will intently watch Baby Signing Time from start to finish (I don't allow much TV but Baby Signing Time is one of our few exceptions).
The most AMAZING thing is that at 10 months old he can already use 4 signs (eat, milk, more, and all done) appropriately to communicate with me! I have learned right along with him and am able to communicate with deaf customers at my job (restaurant manager) at least on a very minimal level. The signs for eat, drink, more, all done, please, thank you, etc come in handy every day! We encourage him to use signs to communicate. The videos would not be effective if we (his parents and grandparents) did not learn the signs and encourage him to use them. I love being able to learn with my son and teach him at such a young age.
The bright colors, repetition, fun songs, and smiling faces are all key elements that appeal to a baby/toddler and help them to learn. The most effective element, however, is watching other children use each sign on the video. It makes my son want to do what they are doing!
I love what Rachel has done by creating baby signing time. I am amazed at what my son is learning thanks to her.",1394755200,,1267,4.305439330543933

Many of the toddlers speak very little but I have noted their parents signing to them. I helped just last Sunday when one of our autistic toddlers hit one of the others who signs. I was able to verify it was his ear and it was hurt. How cool is this to be able to communicate with basically non-verbal children??

She was very excited even before the movie started, when she hears the giggles and the logo popping up. When she was about 13 months old, her signing vocabulary increases by 1-2 words per week if I keep showing her the signing and the real subjects.

Now, she is 16 months old. she can sign baby, music, food, drink, peach, dog, dada mama, hat, music, more, milk, shoes, socks, dirty, nice, please, sorry, etc. It is a lot of fun seeing her signing because she looks so cute and silly!",1356480000,3,631,4.302521008403361

We have moved on to the second video in the set and she's picking up those signs quickly as well. We feel if her impairment doesn't improve she has at least developed these communication skills.
