3718567,1,B001NGNLO2,"I am very disappointed on this film. First, the story is too much about the mum = 70 %, and she talked non-stop, after 20 min I stopped the dvd and throwed it away! I don't recommend this dvd to anyone.",1238198400,2,202,3.951219512195122
3718568,5,B001NGNLO2,"I saw this movie in New York with two friends and we all loved it. Bautifully handled, the acting was great and the story was at times funny and at times moving. It was a feel good movie that left you wanting for more. The audience could not stop clapping at the end. Just wonderful.",1237248000,,283,4.163636363636364
3718569,5,B001NGNLO2,"I highly recommend ""Ready! O.K!"" It's a really well made film all around, with great story telling and excellent acting! It is quite moving and very funny at times. I wish more movies were written, acted and directed as well as ""Ready! O.K!""",1235001600,,241,4.627906976744186
3718570,5,B001NGNLO2,"I was lucky enough to see ""Ready? OK!"" on the big screen in New York and I can't say enough about it.  It was so nice to see a great movie about a family and a single mother coming to grips with her son's ""atypical"" nature.  Joshua doesn't want to play sports, he wants to cheer.  And why shouldn't he?  The conservative Catholic school doesn't know what to do with him while his mom, Andy, gently tries to convince him to do other activities.  Meanwhile Andy's struggling brother, Alex, shows up to further complicate her frazzled life.

A kind homosexual neighbor (wonderfully played by ""Lost"" actor Michael Emerson) helps Andy and her family see that Joshua is perfect, just the way he is.

What I really appreciated about the film was that it doesn't hit you over the head that Joshua is probably gay.  He may be gay but all we know is he loves to cheer.  Lurie Posten is a real find as Joshua.  You can't help but love him and cheer for him.

You won't be disappointed in ""Ready? OK!"".  It's a well-made smart little movie that deserves a wide audience.  Check it out!!!",1234828800,4,1075,4.423469387755102
3718571,5,B001NGNLO2,"From the first few moments of this film, I knew I was in for a treat!  This film makes me think of my own childhood.  Most importantly it makes me so thankful that I had open minded parents.  For anyone who is in an artistic profession and had a passion for a hobby outside of the norm, this movie will be right up your alley.",1234742400,,326,3.9846153846153847
3718572,5,B001NGNLO2,"I didn't know much about this film when I went to see it at the Palm Springs International Film Festival (which I almost didn't get into because it was SOLD OUT).  Thankfully I got in because it was one of the sweetest, most heartfelt films I had seen in a while.  A few years back I saw '29th and Gay' (made by the same team) and loved that too.  What I love about Daisy Pictures is that their films are a refreshing take on gay life.  Well acted, well crafted, and fun.  And who doesn't love Carrie Preston on True Blood?!",1234569600,,524,4.148514851485149
3718573,5,B001NGNLO2,"All I can say is, this is a great, sweet, warm tale about a boy trying to find his way, and a mom trying too. Wonderful film that takes you by surprise.",1234483200,5,152,3.78125
3718574,5,B001NGNLO2,What an amazing film.  So often situations present themselves that deter us from our goals and aspirations.  The characters in this film tell a believable and striking story about how love and passion vanquish doubt.  It is also an undeniably refreshing microcosm demonstrating the relevant double-edged sword that homosexuality is in society.,1234483200,5,343,5.5576923076923075
3718575,5,B001NGNLO2,"This is a great film about family,acceptance, and love. The characters are real, people you know, family and friends. Importantly it is all about acceptance, of who we are, what we can do and where we belong.",1234483200,5,208,4.648648648648648

This is a great film with a great cast, the little boy is just amazing.  It is really about being your own person in the face of what society expects - and finding your own way.  I feel like this film provides a wonderful, sweet, story about being different and embracing it.  The performances are terrific.",1234483200,3,444,6.213114754098361

8326924,5,B001NGNLO2,I loved this movie. Carrie Preston and Michael Emerson did a great job. So did the rest of the actors.,1459209600,,102,4.15
8326925,1,B001NGNLO2,Expected more from Michael & Carrie.,1430697600,,36,5.166666666666667
8326926,3,B001NGNLO2,"There's not a lot to this DVD, and it IS very predictable. However, it is interesting enough as an exploration of gender expectations and associated issues without going to an extreme of repression or the far end of license.",1274572800,4,224,4.769230769230769
8326927,3,B001NGNLO2,"Josh is an intelligent 10 year old boy, living with his single mother, Andrea (Carrie Preston), a local television remote producer.  Andrea worries about Josh's growing up without a father, and her deadbeat brother's occasional presence in the home may be doing more harm than good. Then there's the gay next-door neighbor, Charlie (played by Michael Emerson from ""Lost""), whom Josh seems to have a good rappor with. Josh wants to quit the wrestling team, find a way to get on the cheerleading squad (which is ""girls only"" at the Catholic school he attends), and - with Charlie's help - dresses up as one of the Von Trapp girls for a school Halloween party.  Uh, oh.

The film deserves kudos for its fine acting (including newcomer Lurie Poston as Josh, although he was a bit big to be playing a 10 year old), as well as providing a positive message about diversity and changing the rules where necessary.  The direction is good, although I noticed some audio problems making some characters' lines difficult to understand. I thought the film concentrated too much on the mother's and uncle's problems, while it would have been better devoting more time to Josh's experiences, making the plot a bit less predictable and ordinary.  DVD includes commentary and blooper reel.  Not to be confused with a similar (and identically titled) gay short also released theatrically in 2008, which has been shown on Logo.  Overally, I give the film three stars out of five.",1259712000,,1460,4.862903225806452
8326928,1,B001NGNLO2,"I saw an amazing short film with the same title and same basic plot at the NC gay and lesbian movie festival 2009. I don't know the story behind this but despite the striking similarities, the directors are distinct and this ""feature"" movie despite being longer is very shallow compared with the short one. I felt cheated because I thought this was an augmented version of the short but it is a very diluted one. I stopped watching it after 20 or 30 minutes.",1253750400,,458,4.464285714285714
8326929,5,B001NGNLO2,"I was lucky enough to see this film at the recent MAGA film festival in Macon, GA and it was the highlight of the weekend!  I couldn't wait to order a copy to share with friends and family.  To echo the praises of everyone else, this film is beautifully acted, poignantly written, and a must-see for any audience.  It effectively drives the message of love and acceptance both within and outside the family unit and paints a picture of what honor and respect for not only individuals around us in our society, but also for ourselves, should look like.",1241049600,2,551,4.545454545454546
8326930,5,B001NGNLO2,"This is a finely written and acted movie. The situation of the young protagonist, a boy who longs to be a cheerleader, is a direct and compelling challenge to myriad adults in his orbit. It is their varied responses to his quest, sometimes amid their own personal struggles or ideological limitations, that provides so much humor and emotional depth. The boy's mother (played by Carrie Preston)is really the main character in the movie, however. Most of her struggles with work and family are independent of her son's ambition. My own favorite moment in the movie is when she talks to a priest in the confessional.  The long, quiet shot of her face as she reveals her doubts and struggles is a precious bit of acting.",1239667200,,717,4.736
8326931,5,B001NGNLO2,"This movie is very sweet and is appropriate for all ages and all audiences.  The take-home message is the importance of accepting honoring people for who they are, not who you think they should be.  Loved it!",1239321600,,208,4.594594594594595
8326932,5,B001NGNLO2,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It's warm, touching, funny, and sweet.  Many of us can relate to feeling different from everyone else as a child, and this movie shows how he and the people around him deal with that difference.  Not a perfect movie, but well done, well acted, and with a wonderful cast.",1238198400,2,300,4.518518518518518
