4370897,4,B004FPXMDI,"Latter day shoot 'em ups with Eastwood as the principal character. It would be wrong though to say Eastwood is the ""hero"" in these movies. His character is just as violent and evil as the opposition ""bad guys"".  Eastwood's character might be better identified as the Man With No Conscience. But, they're entertaining at least which is something Hollywood has been mostly lacking for years now.",1424476800,,393,4.954545454545454

4370910,5,B004FPXMDI,"Most people looking at buying this trilogy have probably already seen, or already know well, the movies and story lines.  Clint Eastwood plays ""The man with no name"" in this 3 movie set.  The stories and characters are not really connected in any way except that Clint's is a set type that one takes to mean is meant it is the same person through all three films.  Brooding, mysterious and motivated by various things for various reasons.  Many people take for granted what Sergio Leone did for the Western genre of movie.  Gone were the days of the formulaic, singing-on-horseback ""Lone Ranger"" types with stereotypical good guy lead.  Raw, gritty and violent was the name of the game, and Leone brought more of an artistic touch to his style of delivery.

For the packaging you get a DVD case of normal width containing two discs.  ""A Fist Full of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"" are on one disc, each a different side, and ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" on it's own separate disc.  Video transfer quality is decent....but don't expect HD quality....just not going to happen on 3 60's era movies.  Sound quality is decent, but again not perfect due to the age of the films.",1393372800,13,1183,4.59047619047619

8428207,1,B004FPXMDI,"I don't want to say this is a bootleg copy...but this is the aspect ratio. I am incredibly disappointed in the DVD I got. Don't waste your time or money with this seller. Download it from iTunes or something, but do not for the love of Sergio Leone buy it from here.",1472601600,,266,4.134615384615385
