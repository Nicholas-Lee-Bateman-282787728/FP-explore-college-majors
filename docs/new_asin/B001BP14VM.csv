Review of the Australian Film  - This is a morality tale. The core of the film is a $100,000 bet between two friends about who can make the most money in 90 days. The story twists a bit with both taking turns struggling with the pressure and being in a position of control. Ego complicates things, as does the love interest. Generally things were quite predictable, but there are some surprising unexpected developments.

One problem with the story is that it is all a bit unlikely, but so too then are many elements of Shakespeare's. It does get you in though as the characters take turns to ramp up the pressure rather than let each other off the hook. It's odd behaviour for supposed friends. It's no doubt intentional but neither of the key protagonists or their `umpire' Benno, is particularly likeable. In fact they were all hard to connect with, though Matthew Newton is fine in this role. Aden Young as Angus, a sort of James Packer character, alternately kept reminding me of Adam from Spooks (Rupert William Penry-Jones) and Captain Jack Harkness  of Torchwood (John Barrowman). He mumbles a bit too and was often a bit hard to understand.

Given the film was made in 2006, just prior to the Global Financial Crash, it does have some pertinent things to say about greed and the financial industry. It is by no means a great film but I was drawn in by the drama of the decisions that the characters were making. The production values were fairly high and there were some interesting uses of the camera. Overall it was reasonable entertainment and the messages, though fairly obvious, were worth repeating given what happened in the real world straight after.",1295481600,,1842,4.603658536585366
