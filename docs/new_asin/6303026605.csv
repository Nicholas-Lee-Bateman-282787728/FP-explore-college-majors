538691,5,6303026605,"What fun both of these films are.

""Circus of Horrors"" looks and feels very much like a Hammer film from the period.  Marvelous English/German cast, gorgeous color cinematography and fresh, exciting script with plenty of surprises.  Despite it's ghastly murders, the film has an undercurrent of fiendish wit which becomes quite noticeable during the murder scenes, all of which are so jaw-droppingly cruel and mean-spirited you'll find yourself laughing on occasionnot with derision but delight at how satisfying everyone's revenge-fueled homicide is.  The theme song, ""Look for a Star,"" is delightful and adds an extra, lively touch.  I love every minute of this film.

""Theater of Death"" is very different in tone from ""Circus.""  It's very subtle and its murders so subdued you might actually miss one or two if you're not paying attention.  The pacing is a tad slower here but for all that, it's still an excellent, fascinating movie.  The setting is wonderfulan ornate, Parisian theater whose resident troupe performs nothing but horror sketches.  One realizes how interesting this concept is when watching their ""Witches of Salem"" scene.  Again, the cast and performances are wonderful, as is the music; watch for some especially engaging guitar music towards the end.  A dreamy, moody piece, richly photographed in gorgeous color.

538791,4,6303026605,"Notorious at the time of it's release for earning the ""X-certificate"" for it's explicit murder scenes, CIRCUS OF HORRORS (1960) is a bold horror film, and a ripe showcase for it's brooding leading man Anton Diffring, who plays a maniacal plastic surgeon driven to murder in order to cover up his medical bungles.

Forced to flee England following a disastrous plastic surgery job on the daughter of the hospital's lead board member, Dr. Schuler (Diffring) and his two unwitting assistants (Jane Hylton and Kenneth Griffith) wind up at a tatty circus in the French countryside.  There, Schuler performs restorative surgery on the scarred face of the circus manager's young daughter Nicole, but also winds up ""inheriting"" the entire enterprise.

Ten years pass, in which time Schuler has transformed the circus into Europe's most acclaimed and glamorous entertainment spectacle.  Pulling his acts literally from the streets, Schuler's artistes are mostly female criminals and prostitutes, for whom Schuler performed plastic surgery in exchange for their services at the circus.  Despite holding their previous faces and professions against them as blackmail, that hasn't stopped several women from trying to escape Schuler.  Each one has met with a freak accidental death, earning the circus the dubious nickname of the ""Jinx Circus"".  A private investigator's arrival on the scene coincides with two more accidental murders...

CIRCUS OF HORRORS is a very enjoyable title; especially for fans of Sixties horror.  This was director Sidney Hayers' first big film; he'd later helm such Brit-horror gems as ""Night of the Eagle"".  The cast is filled out with some striking European actresses, including Erika Remberg, Vanda Hudson and Yvonne Romain.  Yvonne Monlaur is Nicole (Carla Challoner is the younger Nicole at the beginning of the film).  Jane Hylton (""The Manster"") has a fantastic supporting role as Schuler's would-be girlfriend.

The actual circus used in the film was the UK's Billy Smart Circus; the movie also launched Garry Mills' ""Look for a Star"" (played ad nauseum during Erika Remberg's trapeze act), it later hit the charts.",1301616000,,2139,5.330357142857143
538792,5,6303026605,"WARNING:  Some spoilers ahead

I really like Circus Of Horrors (1960).  This movie takes place in England in 1947.  Basically this movie is about a plastic surgeon who has botched up a procedure on a young woman and is wanted by police.  He flees, changes his name, and befriends the owner of a circus who has a daughter with a deformity caused by bombs in World War II.  He operates on the daughter to try to correct the deformity and make her beautiful again.  As time goes on, he sort of takes over the circus himself after the owner dies in a so-called ""accident"".  This plastic surgeon ends up turning this circus into a hugely successful operation, but he's using it as a front to hide what his real intentions are - befriending deformed women, performing plastic surgery on them to make them beautiful again, forcing them into becoming beautiful circus performers, and getting them in bed.  When these circus performers decide they've had enough and want out of the circus, the plastic surgeon starts rigging some circus acts so the performers will die, but wants these incidents to appear as ""accidents"".  After several ""accidents"" the police become suspicious and start closing in on the plastic surgeon/circus owner.  I won't reveal the ending.

This movie is pretty risque for a 1960 movie.  It has violence, cruelty, blood, gore, and sadism.  The DVD transfer is outstanding.  The picture is extremely clear and the sound is great.  The movie looks like it was made yesterday.  This movie reminds me so much of the Hammer films with the use of vibrant colors on the sets and colorful costumes.  The acting is good and is similar to Hammer films, as is the musical score.  This movie has the hit 1960 song ""Look For A Star"" by Garry Mills in it.  Real circus acrobats were used in this film.  In fact, footage was used from actual circus performances.  There are a lot of tense moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

This movie stars Anton Diffring, Erika Remberg, Yvonne Monlaur, Donald Pleasence, Conrad Phillips, Kenneth Griffith, Jane Hylton, Vanda Hudson, Yvonne Romain, and Colette Wilde.

I highly recommend this movie.",1299283200,,2152,4.769647696476965
538793,5,6303026605,"Circus of Horrors was recommended viewing by one of the many horror-genre web sites. I have to say this film was one of the top films of this genre I have seen. It's 1960 british tone will not scare you to death, but this one doesn't need all the gore were used to. A simple and colorful background of a lively little rural touring circus provides the mat for a murder mystery more than a horror film. The acting is good enough to draw you quickly as you'll start follwing the beginning and end of the lead, Anton Diffring. He plays a man with a couple of names as he works his craziness and genius into the circus as it weaves through several beautifully ""made"" women performers. Enjoy this one.

538883,4,6303026605,"Remember that this is a horror film of British origin, not American, and as such if you're looking for a typical film of the genre, this is not one of them. British horror films tend to give more attention to the psychological aspects of horror and short shrift to the physical aspects. If you realize this, you should really enjoy this one.

The story revolves around a German plastic surgeon who, in 1947, botches a job badly and has to leave England to escape the notoriety. Fortunately a horrible car accident and near brush with death makes almost everyone convinced of the doctor's death and makes his escape easy. In France he runs across a young girl who was scarred in the war. He repairs her face and in turn inherits the father's circus when the father is mauled by a bear. And I'm not talking about the parts that are a hoot yet.

Now for the discrete charm and campiness of it all. The doctor decides that, along with a name change and a new face for himself, running a circus will be a great front for continuing his plastic surgery practice and experiments. He seems to have no trouble finding scarred female criminals - they practically fall into his lap - and once repairing them he not only has no trouble bedding them, all of the doctor's girls have a talent for walking the high-wire, eating fire, lion taming, etc. - talents that befit a circus. Not a clumsy or shy one or one who would rather be an accountant in the lot.

The doctor does resent it though whenever one wants to leave. Every time one of them announces a desire to leave or an engagement they die a horrible ""accidental"" death in the ring during what was supposed to be - and tragically is - their last performance. In spite of the bodies piling up, the authorities allow the circus to remain open, and stranger yet - the girls keep TELLING the doctor whenever they want to leave! As for me, after the third freak accident, I'd be packing my things in the middle of the night and disappearing if I had any desire to change careers.

However, without these confrontational and agile girls there would be no story, so it's an understandable plot device. Don't think I'm disrespecting this film - it is great entertainment, just not horror in the conventional sense. And that hammy yet hummable little tune ""Reach for a Star"" that gets played during every performance is pure 60's British cinema.

As for DVD quality, this one is in very good shape, which is unfortunately untrue for many British films made between 1945-1965. Too bad it's out of print.",1279324800,,2537,4.542669584245076

538886,3,6303026605,"Circus of Horrors (1960) is a mostly atmospheric tale of suspense, reminiscent of a Hammer Horror production, involving an unscrupulous doctor and his assistants.  Anton Diffring is Dr. Rossiter, a plastic surgeon who flees from England to France, after disfiguring a patient.  Changing his name to Schuler, the doctor and his assistants (Kenneth Griffith and Jane Hylton), encounter a circus owner (Donald Pleasance) with a disfigured daughter.  Schuler repairs the girl's face, and in return becomes part owner of the circus.

Schuler takes full control of the circus, when the owner is killed in an accident, and things take a weird turn, when the doctor decides to recruit talent for his circus from the streetwalkers and the criminal element on the street.  Elissa (Erika Rembert), a disfigured prostitute who has her face repaired by Rossiter, becomes a talented acrobat.  The troupe has become a success, but has a dubious reputation.  When the star of the circus (Vanda Hudson) plans to leave the big show, Schuler sees that she meets a horrific end during a performance.  Another in a series of tragic `accidents', for the `jinxed' circus.

The circus travels to England, but the suspicions of the police have been aroused.  The doctor's weakness for the ladies causes him to live dangerously and create unrest.  When the disgruntled Elissa is injured in a fall, there is a moment of high tension where the truth almost revealed, but with the police around, it is just a matter of time before matters totally unravel.

Fed by Rossiter's sinister resolve, director Sidney Hayers' film's has a strong atmosphere of suspense, bolstered by the occasional act of violence.  Aside from one knifing, there isn't much bloodshed until the very end, when the level of action ramps up nicely.  Anton Diffring gives a strong performance, as a fanatic full of hubris, in this campy, entertaining thriller.",1257206400,3,1901,5.090322580645161
538887,4,6303026605,"Anchor Bay has become an extremely reliable purveyor of near-vintage, almost-classics that are, nevertheless, highly entertaining and great fun.  I've found that all the films presented on their DVD's are restored to pristine condition and have found few, if any, flaws; they're rapidly becoming one of my favorite entertainment companies.

The ""Circus of Horrors""/""Theatre of Death"" DVD is no exception, as far as quality goes.  They both look wonderful!  But, while ""Circus of Horrors"" is, indeed, highly entertaining, ""Theatre of Death"" managed to put me to sleep; it is (I think) one of  Anchor Bay's less successful entries.

""Circus of Horrors"" stars Anton Diffring as a mad doctor who performs plastic surgery on scarred but beautiful (and, oh so bad) women, forcing them to perform in his traveling circus that is generating acclaim across Europe.  When the ladies decide that they've had enough and want to leave the circus, the good doctor devises deadly and unique methods of hastening their departures.  It's all silly as can be, but the actors are quite good, with Diffring taking his performance to the very edge of camp, and bringing it back before it quite crosses over.  Erika Remberg, Yvonne Romain (later Mrs. Leslie Bricusse), and Yvonne (""Brides of Dracula"") Monlaur are statuesque and shine like Vegas showgirls, as the damsels in distress, while ""Halloween""s original Doctor Loomis, the venerable Donald Pleasance, enjoys a few brief moments as a concerned father who attempts to get a bit too chummy with the circus' bear.

To its credit, ""Circus of Horrors"" never takes itself too seriously and doesn't spend a lot of talk time setting up its storyline.  There's quite a bit of action and, to me, at least, it never seems to drag.

""Theatre of Death"", on the other hand, is just coma-inducing.  Not really a horror film, it's sort of a mystery that's practically all talk, a set-up for a thrill ride that never happens.  Christopher Lee plays the nasty, ill-tempered owner of a Paris theater company.  There are a series of murders in which the victims are drained of their blood, and somehow the murders are connected to Lee's theater.  Meantime, American Leila Goldoni is trying to make her mark in the theater world and catch the attention of her boss, Lee, who's hot for young, blonde ingenue, Jenny Till.  A handsome cop (played by Julian Glover) becomes involved with both the case, and with Goldoni's character, and there are nearly nude African performers chanting and thrashing about on the stage, while Till seems to be possessed by...I'm not sure what, but she seems to have it in for Goldoni.

The film, itself, looks glorious (although it's plainly not shot in Paris), but I found it to be tiresome and needlessly convoluted.  The acting (even Lee's) is so-so, and the characters were just plain boring. The only reason that I can think of to explain this film's success at drive-in movie theaters, would be its incentive for young lovers to climb into the backseats of their cars.

I give three stars to ""Circus of Horrors"" and one star to ""Theatre of Death"", hence the four star review.",1222128000,,3126,4.929389312977099

""Circus of Horrors"" has always been one of my favorite horror films.  From its very beginning when the disfigured woman confronts her face in the mirror and belts out a deranged scream of ""Rossiter! Rossiter!"" it grabs you by the throat in an outrageous meolodramatic way.  The entire movie has an off-kilter nightmare quality to it, reaching its zenith at the eponymous circus of horrors that Rossiter, Anton Diffring, creates in France.  Tame by today's standards compared to horror fare like ""Saw,"" it nevertheless ratchets up the suspense when members of the circus start dying horribly.  Anton Diffring has a field day as the psychotic plastic surgeon Rossiter who becomes progressively more psychotic as he has to commit more and more murders to protect his true identity.",1216252800,2,921,5.902255639097745

538890,4,6303026605,"Written by George Baxt (Night of the Eagle, Vampire Circus) and directed by Sidney Hayers (Night of the Eagle, Satan's Playthings), Circus of Horrors (1960) stars Anton Diffring (The Man Who Could Cheat Death, Fahrenheit 451, Where Eagles Dare).  Also appearing is Jane Hylton (The Manster), Kenneth Griffith (The Assassination Bureau), Erika Remberg (Night of the Vampires), who would later marry the director, Yvonne Monlaur (The Brides of Dracula), Conrad Phillips (Sons and Lovers), Vanda Hudson (Strip Tease Murder), Yvonne Romain (Devil Doll), and Donald Pleasence (The Great Escape, You Only Live Twice).

Anton Diffring plays a character named Dr. Rossiter, a plastic surgeon with a spotty history now on the run from English authorities due to some `unpleasantness'.  With the help of his assistants Martin (Griffith) and Angela (Hylton), who are also brother and sister, Rossiter gets new face, along with a new identity as Dr. Bernard Schueler.  The trio leave the English isle for France where they happen upon flea bitten, washed up circus run by a man named Vanet (Pleasence), whose young daughter Nicole suffers from a horrible facial disfigurement as a result of the war not so long ago (as the story begins the year is 1947).  Anyway, Rossiter, aka Schueler makes a deal with Vanet, one that would allow for Schueler to use the circus as a front while continuing his work in exchange for fixing Nicole's face.  Vanet agrees and circumstances eventually lead to Schueler taking over the circus (Vanet got a little too friendly with a bear).  Seeing the number of facially disfigured young women running around Europe at the time, Schueler gets the bright idea to focus on those who are criminals (pickpockets, prostitutes, murderesses, etc.), giving them new faces in exchange for their servitude in the circus.  Ten years pass and business is booming although the circus does seem to have an unusually mortality rate (where's OSHA when you need them?), particularly among its young and comely female performers, all of whom Schueler's operated on...also Schuler seems to have a habit of falling for each of the women he `fixes', at least until the next one comes along, much to the consternation of Angela, whose had a thing for Schueler as far back when he was known as Rossiter.  Eventually the authorities become suspicious, Schueler has a falling out with Martin and Angela, there's an incident with a guy in a bad gorilla suit, there's some more deaths under the big top, Schueler is recognized from someone from his past, all leading up to an exciting finale that proves while the circus may certainly be an entertaining show, not all the action happens within its three rings...

I enjoyed this semi-sleazy English horror nugget a lot despite my perception of there being a slight overabundance of drama and not enough horror (and sleaze)...what horror elements included were certainly impressive and shocking (except maybe for the bear and gorilla attacks, which I'll talk about later), but I think the film could have done with some more.  There's more than enough drama to go around as we see Differing's character deal with his various love interests, the numerous circus performers and their problems (not getting top billing, having to share the spotlight, etc.), and so on...that's not to say I don't enjoy good drama but some of it here seemed scattered about haphazardly, one example specifically in terms of the sad sack clown who had a thing for an uppity aerial ballet performer who winds up on Rossiter's bad side (guess what happens to her?).  Anyway, there are numerous scenes where we see Bozo (or whatever the hell his name was) on the sidelines, intently watching the woman perform, so we know he's got it bad for her, but then when she suffers a mishap, where does this element of the plot go?  Nowhere in particular as Bozo vanishes, never to be seen again which ultimately made me wonder what was the point?  Seemed like a dilly of a revenge motif was in the works but oh well...there's certainly more good than bad here as the production values are very solid, the performances professional, and the action exciting.  It's nice to see Anton Diffring featured in the lead especially since I've always thought him a character actor relegated to playing German heavies in war pictures.  The man had depth, along with the creepy eyes, and did very well bringing to life his character here, one blessed with an amazing ability to change lives yet eventually becomes drunk on his own hubris, lording his gifts over those whom he pretends to help.  There was one character, played by Conrad Phillips, which annoyed me somewhat as the film progressed.  His was the main hero role, as he was an investigator posing as a pushy reporter.  Through most of the last half of the film we see him walking around behind the scenes of the circus, trying to dig up dirt by questioning performers and what not.  At one point he's told to beat it as he's not allowed in the backstage areas, yet no one ever really pushes the point which basically results in his having free reign.  Seems to me with all the monkey business going on behind the scenes, the last thing you'd want is a nosy reporter (who's actually a police detective) milling about.  If it were my show (and my secrets to hide), I would have had the habitual trespasser seriously pummeled by the strongman at the very least.  There were a couple of really goofy sequences featuring guys in fake animal suits attacking characters, something the filmmakers obviously knew looked phony given the quick cut shots showing bits of faux fur and not much else.  On the flipside I thought the various scars and bits of gruesome horror effects done well, looking highly realistic.  All in all Circus of Horrors is worth checking out as it's a better than average film (of its kind) with a strong sense of direction, solid performances all around, some grisly effects (along with some goofy ones), interesting characters, and a decent script.

This DVD release, provided by Anchor Bay Entertainment, includes a sharp looking picture presented in widescreen (1.77:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, along with a very solid Dolby Digital mono audio track available in English and Spanish.  Extra features include an original theatrical trailer, three television spots, a still gallery, a gallery of posters and advertising material, an Anton Differing biography, and a 5X7 reproduction insert of a poster for the film, the flipside featuring the chapter stops.

By the way, if you're interested in picking up this film on DVD, you might want to search out a double feature DVD release from Anchor Bay Entertainment, one that includes Circus of Horrors along with Christopher Lee flick titled Theater of Death (1966).  Another thing, Lee did appear in a film titled Circus of Fear (1966), which shouldn't be confused with Circus of Horrors as it's not nearly as good.",1160438400,2,6948,4.928877463581833
538891,5,6303026605,I finally purchased this movie.  I remember when I saw it on t.v. in the 1960s.  The music was haunting and I couldn't get it out of my mind.  This movie is typical of the horror flix of the time.  You'll enjoy it.,1125964800,,214,3.9069767441860463
538892,4,6303026605,"Here are two gems with two yummy and hot male foreigners!  The first film, Circus Of Horrors with the lead male played by Anton Diefring.  Diefring plays a totally psychotic and over sexed plastic surgeon that takes over a carnival and subjects his female circus stars to some time under the knife with him. (HA HA) Diefring is a creepy, sexy, cold, megalomaniac intent on making disfigured women beautiful and then having his way with them.  A youngish Donald Pleasance (the psychiatrist in the Halloween movies) has a bit part in the film.  For the date the movie was filmed in (1960) it is QUITE THE horror/sexploitation film.  The second film has Mr. Horror Guru himself, Christopher Lee as a creepalicious, power hungry theatre (of death) director and owner.  The special effects are well done and the set of the theatre and Lee's home with secret passageways and the like is top-notch. This is the weaker of the two films, however, but still an enjoyable pic...",1078099200,12,967,4.795180722891566
538984,5,6303026605,"It's amazing to see so many reviewers remembering the song ""Look for a Star"" from this 1960 thriller gem.  I saw this movie first back in 1960 when I was a highly impressionable child and was overwhelmed by its brutality and gripping suspense.  The song has haunted me ever since; it's one of those melodies that stays in your head even years later.
And in addition, the movie's many scenes have haunted me:  the beautiful Yvonne Romaine's fatal lion taming scene; Donald Plesance's brief role as the drunken owner of the circus; Erika Romberg's fall from grace; the actors who portrayed Rossiter's compatriates in crime--how their subtly understated performances are so well done; and of course, the finale where poetic justice is so passionately observed.
This is really nothing more than a very good thriller; it's horrors are psychological, and so well evidenced in Anton Diffring's performance as Rossiter/Schuler.  His egomania and love for what he does is the soul of Diffring's performance and in spite of a sometimes difficult accent, he is perfect in this little gem.",1071273600,8,1077,5.033707865168539

Watching it again, I was amazed I still remembered many images as clearly as if I'd seen it yesterday.  Great fun, the picture's an unholy brew of sex and sadism; Anton Diffring's chilly intelligence as the crazed plastic surgeon turned ringmaster provides a disturbing center to the film's moral universe.  CIRCUS is pleasingly peopled with large-busted European starlets constantly in a state of undressed distress, sports luscious color photography by Douglas Slocombe (presented by Anchor Bay in a stunningly crisp transfer), and features an insistent pop ballad that's repeated so often, Helen Keller could leave the theatre humming the theme!  Like many horror films, this one's a mixture of intelligent handling of trashy material; it manages to transcend the genre and become truly memorable, like EYES WITHOUT A FACE.  Grab this CIRCUS while it's in town!",1039046400,13,1016,5.133333333333334
538987,5,6303026605,"Anchor Bay outdid themselves with this DVD. I hadn't seen this Euro-shocker in years and it's flawlessly preserved on disc. It's a grisly tale of plastic surgeon Dr. Lassiter (a deliciously over-the-top Anton Diffring) who messes up on a wealthy socialites's face and, fearing ruin and/or jail, takes it on the lam with his nurse and her brother. They discover a broken down circus kept by the drunken owner (Donald Pleasance) and his war disfigured little girl. After the convenient death of the owner by bear mauling and miraculously fixing the daughters' face, Lassiter seizes a golden opportunity and creates his own circus. Over the years he enlists disfigured shady ladies, restores their beauty and puts them to work as performers. If they try to leave, they meet with violent death in ""accidents"". The little girl is now grown into the gorgeous Yvonne Monlaur who is devoted to Lassiter and training to be in the show. She knows nothing of his grotesque business arrangements. The beautiful Erika Remberg is featured as a temperamental trapeze artist who resorts to blackmailing Lassiter for star status. Her theme song is a syrupy pop tune ""Look to a Star"" that is repeatedly used to creepy effect. This film is British/European horror at its' most luridly bizarre and is wonderful in color. The circus atmosphere is vividly captured and Remberg's routines are an eyeful. Yvonne Romain (""Devil Doll"", ""Curse of the Werewolf"") is also featured as a disfigured (but what a figure!) doll restored to her stunning beauty and put to work as a lion tamer. Horror fans should treasure this glorious excercise in the macabre and it's a must have for collectors.",1038182400,6,1662,4.982014388489208
538988,4,6303026605,"The DVD remaster/transfer that Anchor Bay has done for ""Circus of Horrors"" is amazing, colors are fresh, vivid even in night scenes.  The audio is equally stunning for a horror film that is over forty years old.  Anton Diffring is scary and Yvonne Monlaur is truly ""beautiful"".  A close comparison to the 1990 HBO/Thorn EMI fullscreen laserdisc release of ""Circus"" shows just what a wonderful remaster this DVD contains.  Anchor Bay, far from being a minor player, is setting the benchmark for quality DVD.  The big studios haven't taken this much care on far more recent, more important films, such as ""Bladerunner"".  Lets hope they take note, in the meanwhile treat yourself or a friend to this DVD.  It will make a great Christmas/Holiday gift.",1031616000,2,747,4.928

Plenty of gruesome incidents keep the cliche plot moving along.  One interesting footnote: we learn quite early in the film that a caged circus gorilla hates the villain.  Obviously, he will be killed by the gorilla in the thrilling climax, right?  (Unless he first dies of cancer or emphysema caused by his chain smoking.)  Wrong.  Getting attacked by the gorilla is merely one of about six bad things that happen to him during the last several minutes of the film, before he finally dies.",1028678400,2,652,4.767857142857143

538991,5,6303026605,"What was it about the years 1959 and 1960 that gave us Horrors of the Black Museum, The Hypnotic Eye, and finally this well-crafted, adult-themed, gruesome and exciting melodrama, all three movies fixated on scarring and facial mutilation? Well let's just be glad for it, whatever it was. This has always been an overlooked gem, a crackling shocker that gives Hammer a run for its money in the sex-and-violence department, and features a terrific Continental cast headed by the deliciously icy Anton Diffring, and including Erika Remberg, Yvonne (Brides of Dracula) Monlaur, Donald Pleasance, Jane (The Manster) Hylton, and Yvonne (Curse of the Werewolf) Romain. The colorful cinematography is by Douglas Slocombe (Fearless Vampire Killers, The Music Lovers, all three Indiana Jones movies), and several incredibly convincing deep scar makeups are courtesy of Trevor Crole-Rees (Dr. Phibes). The plot moves along at a snappy pace and there's plenty of naked flesh and verbal/physical violence to distract one from the occasional implausibility (not to mention that really cheesy gorilla suit). I love the fact that Dr. Rossiter (Diffring), though ostensibly an amoral sociopath, is really the protagonist of the film, and I still find myself hoping he won't get caught. (I always did wonder how this passed for Saturday-afternoon kiddie fare all those years.) Highly recommended for fans of British horror or sleazy shockers, fundamentalist gorehounds, etc. You know who you are.
Anchor Bay's DVD presentation is definitely one of the most impressive I've seen for a neglected film like this (perhaps rivaled only by Allday's The Sadist DVD, another must-have). As stated by others here, the anamorphic widescreen (1.77:1) source print is nearly flawless! Bright, sharp, detailed, with better color than I've ever seen it, and virtually speckle/spot-free. Just stunning. Add to that the trailer, TV spots, still gallery, posters, ads, well-researched Anton Diffring bio, and French language track and you've got an awesome package that it's hard to imagine will ever be topped. The only thing missing is a commentary track. But that's really just nitpicking considering the overall quality of this release. Buy this now.",1006819200,26,2220,5.400576368876081
538992,5,6303026605,"This movie was a wonderful surprise. The colors, the acting, the music and the production were all excellent for a movie of this type.

I will watch this one again and again.",1005436800,7,351,4.67741935483871
538993,4,6303026605,"First off, the film transfer on this DVD is nothing short of stunning. The picture is presented in widescreen and the colors are very comparable to the same studio's production of ""Peeping Tom"". Sound transfer is fine, and there is even a French language soundtrack available.
""Circus of Horrors"" is quite enjoyable, but it is a tiny bit of a cheat. There are not nearly as many ""horrors"" as one might expect. However, a final 15-minute sequence is worth the price of admission. The acting is generally good among the principles, with the lead, Anton Diffring, a standout. He plays just the right amount of crazed obsession to keep it entertaining.
Reizenstein's musical score is more than adequate and often very good. As for the featured song, ""Look for a Star""--it's true, you will hum it to yourself for days afterward.
Extras are absolutely top-drawer: trailers, tv spots, posters, lobby cards etc, excerpts from a comic-book version of the film, and, most surprising, a reproduction of the song-sheet for the song! There is also a nicely done biography/filmography for Diffring.
Menus are extremely well-done, animated and accompanied by music from the film.
And, if all this is not enough, there is an Easter Egg. Go to the 'Extras' menu, sit back, and you will hear ""Look for a Star"" in a complete, uninterrupted performance.
A must-have for 1950s and 60s horror aficionados.",1005004800,43,1383,4.9655172413793105
7835121,5,6303026605,"When I was a wee tyke, my granny would take me on day-long excursions to see a movie; go shopping, during which I could pick out anything I wanted (within reason) and she'd buy it for me, then get something to eat. I loved those days out with her.

My granny was cool. Most often, she'd take me to horror movies (at my request.) One of them was Circus of Horrors.

From as far back as I can remember, I've loved horror movies. For some reason, Circus of Horrors has stood out in my mind all this time. I'm so happy I came across it on Amazon. Watching it has brought back some nice memories.

Others have detailed the plot, so I won't rehash it here. I don't consider Circus of Horrors to be a schlock horror movie. Okay, so maybe it's a little schlocky. It's quite reminiscent of the old American International/Hammer/William Castle/Roger Corman films. But it has great production values and Anton Diffring at his creepy best. I only wish Donald Pleasence could have stuck around longer.

And ah, yes...the song: Reach for a Star. DJs would make a big deal over it being FROM CIRCUS OF HORRORS! I rather like it. And it isn't played that much in the movie. When it is, I think it offers quite a contrast to the grisly murders that are taking place.

I enjoyed this movie all those years ago, and I still enjoy it today. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves horror, schlocky or otherwise.",1526342400,,1397,4.42023346303502

7835125,3,6303026605,"This review is for the DVD release of Circus of Horrors and Theatre of Death released by Anchor Bay in 2003.

DVD & EXTRA'S: The two movies come on a double sided DVD. 'Circus of Horrors' is shown in 1.77:1 Wide Screen format and 'Theatre of Death' is shown in 2.35:1 Wide Screen format. Each comes with trailer, TV spots, Still Galleries, and bio's on the main stars (Anton Diffring & Christopher Lee). There is also an 11 minute interview with Christopher Lee. The picture on both movies is good. The prints are clean and as good as can be expected from standard definition DVD format.

PLOT:
Circus of Horrors: Dr. Rossiter (Anton Diffring) is a plastic surgeon who is running from the police after an operation goes very badly and he ruins a person's face. He is travelling with two assistants. Rossiter has his assistant's perform plastic surgery on him while on the run. While running they come across a small travelling circus and Rossiter befriends the owner. The owner takes him into his confidence after Rossiter fixes the owner's daughter's badly scarred face. One night the circus owner gets drunk and is killed by one of his animal's as Rossiter stands by and let's it happen. He takes over and makes the circus very successful. A big part of his success comes from fixing the faces of badly scarred women and turning them into beauties. For their part, they join the circus and become an attraction. Whenever the women tell Rossiter they are leaving they suddenly have an accident and are killed. The police soon start inquiring into the mysterious death's.

Theatre of Death:
Christopher Lee plays Darvas, a theatre owner. He is quite arrogant and at times violent. He has the power to hypnotize people and does so to one of female performers. There are several deaths throughout the city and the police come looking at the theatre run by Darvas. It's clear that Darvas is hiding something but he's not saying. Shortly thereafter Darvas disappears and the death's continue.

COMMENTS:  'Circus of Horrors' was a joint production between a British company and AIP. It was shot in England in 1960. It was a follow up of sorts to the successful 'Horrors of the Black Museum.'

I felt that 'Circus of Horrors' has it's moments but really is just your typical horror/murder movie. There is nothing supernatural or unusual going on. It's just a typical story of a jealous guy who goes on a murdering rampage. It is fairly well directed.

An actual circus was used and you see plenty of actual circus acts being performed throughout the movie.

Donald Pleasance plays the circus owner but his part is short lived.

The song 'Look for a Star' was a hit in the United States. I thought it was irritating to have to listen to throughout the movie. But this is just a person preference.

I thought 'Theatre of Death' was the better of the two movies but I figured out half way through who was not the killer! Christopher Lee only appears in about half the movie as he disappears.

RECOMMENDATIONS: At the time of this review in January, 2018 you could pick up this DVD used for about $4-5 plus shipping. It's worthwhile if you are a fan of 60's Horror or perhaps Christopher Lee.

I didn't find that it was anything special but it's not bad either. I'm giving it 3 stars for two average movies with some extra's.",1515456000,,3316,4.659246575342466
