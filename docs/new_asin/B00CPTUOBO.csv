5733362,5,B00CPTUOBO,"I have seen a lot of big budget movies over the last few years in the theatre , however I liked this low budget DVD only movie better than most things in the theatre that cost a lot more money to make. This movie has a simple, easy to understand plot and is very inspiring. The acting is very good and I was not bored one bit looking at this movie. This movie has a great christian theme and though there are sad parts throughout the movie, you will have a smile on your face at the end. The price of this movie is low and it is well worth buying or renting.",1376265600,,558,3.9469026548672566
5733363,5,B00CPTUOBO,"This is such a sweet movie.  In a time when everyone seems to have become ""hardened"" and self absorbed, this movie comes along and puts a smile on your face.  Two homeless girls are in desperate need of a home.  Its been almost a year since they lost their mother and the oldest sister is trying her best to take care of her young sister and keep them both out of the legal system.  Then there is a husband and wife that seems happy on the outside, but are somewhat unhappy behind closed doors.  What's missing?  Children.  A conventional family is nothing new, although a good conventional family is what most of us strive to have.  Sometimes we take the smallest things for granted.  A good marriage is wonderful and adding children to the mix is a blessing.  This is what makes this movie special.  A man, woman, and two orphan girls are brought together under difficult circumstances.  Through a lot of soul searching and some help from the child social services, a family is made.  There are twists and turns throughout the movie and I don't want to spoil anything, but this is a feel good movie that will bring some tears to your eyes and smiles to your lips.",1374278400,22,1165,4.464454976303317

5733418,2,B00CPTUOBO,"disappointing mix of ""im trying to be a christian movie but I don't want to look to christian"" type of movie. story line had potential but a few things were just completely off. (spoiler alert)  The conversation where the dad figure is explaining to the 14 yr old girl how his wife made him feel felt misplaced as the two then swung into talking about prayer, is one example. also there is an unbalance of how many social issues the movie is dealing with so really nothing is addressed as the movie want to address it.",1514505600,,518,4.395833333333333

It was perfect for a family and I watched it with my 6, 10 and 12 year old. There was a little bit of suggestive talk between the married couple but it was mild and I think it's good for kids to see (very mild) interactions between a loving married couple.

5733452,5,B00CPTUOBO,"Okay this is a god film. If you can't of won't except that there is a god or that some believe in him then this is not a film for you.
Izzie is a little girl with a big heart. Her sister has been raising her for the last year on her own. The girl is lost hurt and needs outside help but unwilling to except it. She doesn't trust anyone and anytime Izzie gets out of her sight she fears the worst. She loves her sister but time is taking it's toll on the poor girl.
In steps the caring teacher. Though rare these days as the system seems more and more to crank out mindless drones to do the job and go home. This teacher seeks to not just help the problem children but the gifted as well and that puts her target hairs on Izzie's sister. This makes it harder and harder for the girl to stay out of mind and keep things going.
When the two girls house burned down the jig is up and the teacher finds out. what happens next well that my friend is to big of a spoiler for me to give away.
Good story, great acting and it all falls together for a great movie to watch over and over. LOVE IT.",1482796800,3,1086,3.918552036199095

Instead it was a simplistic plot with crude devices to keep people happy who already believe in God. The ending could have made the same point by explaining that God built a beautiful new family for Greg but, no, it's not that clever. Skip it unless you want more God in your life.",1435881600,,445,4.717948717948718

I like the concpect of the movie that love knows no boundaries. The acting was good. Nothing outstanding, but very good. I enjoyed Izzie and think is makes a great family movie.  It's one that the entire family can watch and there is a great take away message for your children about the acceptance of others and that a family can be as diverse as you want it to be as long as there is love.

5733544,3,B00CPTUOBO,"It is overall a fair movie (see synopsis below) with good acting by the kids, but it is far from being as good as Letters to God, and does not do a good job with the deep theological issue it works to present. Others have described the movie, so let me address the theological issue  this movie seeks to deal with.

In the movie the older daughter, 14-year old Gertie,  is bitter at God whom she denies exists after seeing her mother die after earnest prayer that she would live, while her teacher,  Tonya  Freeman,  and the wife of the Greg who ends up taking them in is also not talking to God after the doctor told her she was infertile, and could not have the kids they wanted to have. Greg and Issie  are strong believers, but can offer no answers in response to the angry denials of God by the two hurt individuals who see God as not acting as the believed He should. The wife is healed in the end in answer to prayer,  which does happen and for which there are examples. But the movie kind of places God on trial to do so,  yet she could have died also, and made this work for even greater good, for which there are examples.

Thus while i can attest that God certainly does answer prayer, even that defy reasonable  naturalistic explanations, but the answers can be no, and negative things  must happen, and if we were God we would let it.  Besides the actions of man having direct and indirect effects on others, for good or bad,  and the necessity of making that manifest, if we did not go thru things that hurt us, that break our hearts, then we may not see our own need for help,  nor could not feel the pain of others who are hurt and help them as much as we can by having endured it ourselves.  And even though evil does happen and must be allowed to have consequences, God does make what the devil meant for bad to work for the good of those who love God, and thus what is good. (Romans 8:28)

 If all the world was filled with people who never suffered than it would be full of superficial people, and or those whose potential was never realized.  The process of enduring negative things in this fallen world is designed to bring us to break and  enlarge our hearts, showing us our need for God and others, and thus we a solution to the evil the devil works. But if we give into the blinding  destructive  victim mentality and bitterness, which the devil uses to spiritually ruin people after he has worked to hurt them, then we have made the wrong choice. Instead we need to confess to God that we do not understand what He is doing, and even pour  our heart out to Him the  way the Bible says and shows (read the Psalms), confident that He knows what He is doing, and has the best interest in mind in Christ,  and He will make all  work to that end.

Job was such a man who endured much, with no satisfying (or corect)  theological answers from his 3 accusative ""friends, but ""saw"" God as one who knows what He is doing in the end, and forgave and prayed for his friends, and  realized the tender mercy and goodness of God in the end.  ""Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, wickedness; and from the Almighty,  iniquity. (Job 34:10)",1421798400,2,3184,4.265442404006678

I have to say I enjoyed the story line, the characters and even appreciated the lesson it gave in standing firm in your faith no matter how bad it may get.

The movie gives you a real good look at how hard it can be at time to stand on your faith in God due to the terrible blows life can bring our way.  But it was refreshing to see that when God ""shows up and shows out"" that life can be more than you ever could imagine.  Thank you Jesus for restoration!!!!!",1408752000,,596,3.991596638655462

The director has an underlying message that God is real and wants to bring that out. Fair enough. The problem is that there is no subtlety at all that in the message, and after about twenty minutes, everything, even the dialogue becomes preachy, trite and contrived. I could barely stand to watch the last forty five minutes, it was so sappy and predictable. And of course, in the end, faith is always rewarded with good outcomes, which negates the point of faith itself, as true faith is not outcome oriented. It's a shame the director had all the finesse of a sledgehammer, which ruins some genuinely fine performances by the starring foursome. The older sister's performance is particularly strong, but it's not enough to save this. I really wanted to like this more, but the longer it went on, the less I could stand it. It's kind of like watching an old propaganda film like Reefer Madness, but without the humor to salvage the absurdly heavy-handedness of the director's point of view. If you're really religious, you will probably like this movie a lot. If you're not religious, like me, you'll want to fast forward through this disappointing bowl of preachy sap.",1397692800,2,1338,4.771551724137931

5733675,5,B00CPTUOBO,"This is a great movie which can teach families and children about faith.  This movie is great for several reasons, but I will name a few. The first is that it shows God's love knows no color barriers,  The second is that we have to learn to love each other daily because tomorrow is not promised and lastly that in the midst of all of our trials and tribulations God always provides a silver lining, its just whether or not we choose to see it.  I first saw this movie on the UP channel with my husband and knew immediately it was a film I wanted to show to the Tween group at church.  Great family movie.",1396569600,,605,4.145299145299146

5733681,5,B00CPTUOBO,"I had seen trailers for this and couldn't wait for it to air. When I watched it, I loved this movie. One reviewer indicated that the sexual innuendos  were inappropriate. I didn't see anything that was distasteful in this movie. There were flirtatious remarks made. For example, in one scene, the couple was on a date, having dinner at a restaurant and the husband said he couldn't wait to get home to get dessert (not the dessert on the menu). In another scene, the husband and wife were waiting for a medical diagnosis to see if the he and his wife could have children. He said when they received the report, they would celebrate by having twins..they kissedend of scene. Those were the only two scenes I remember. Honestly, I didn't get offended by these scenes, as I have seen and heard worse in Christian movies. There were no sex scenes and the movie didn't show anything outside of a husband and wife showing clean affection. Vanessa and Rockmand were the perfect cast and showed the same on-screen chemistry shown in the TV series Soul Food. The couples faith was evident as they prayed when faced with disappointments. The two girls who played, Girdie and her sister, Izzie, were new to me, but their acting impressed me. The movie kept my interest, which is hard since I tend to analyze movies harshly. Roger Bob has a positive history of making quality and inspirational movies so I wasn't surprised that this movie was another to add to that list.",1393718400,,1459,4.655038759689923

Lying unconscious in the hospital after being hit into by a car the teacher's husband and girls pray for her recovery.

5733698,4,B00CPTUOBO,"This movie is good for entertainment value, but not accurate biblically as perhaps it should or could have been. This, like most all Christian themed/ wholesome family movies, is more about the heart of God displayed in people in general and their rough road towards accepting that God is always in control. There is prayer in this movie (despite other really bad Amazon reviewers claiming there wasn't) and a seeming tug-of-war between the will's of a couple of the characters (both the two little girls and the married couple) and their willingness to obey God. One Amazon review said that God's name was blasphemed, but I saw no such occurrence, though I attentively looked for it. I'm glad to say that it was not there! The storyline was really good and the bottom line is that God used two different sets of people to provide a much wanted need for each other. Despite some negative and very mild suggestive dialogue (between a married couple by the way), there is very little about this movie to be overly concerned about if you want to watch it with your 12yo kids + family. ""Raising Izzie"" portrays real people with real issues and how they ultimately overcome real challenges.",1391212800,,1185,4.757281553398058

This is a Christian drama.",1388880000,,325,4.821428571428571
5733701,5,B00CPTUOBO,This is a wonderful movie and teaches us that we should accept each other no matter what the circumstances are or race.

5733703,5,B00CPTUOBO,"While I'm not into religion, I got past my prejudicial attitude surrounding it and just gave the movie a chance and it was great.  People who are into religion and ""God"" would love it more.  I'll take off half a star for the lighting and camera work as it (sometimes) gave things an amateurish feel, otherwise it's a solid 5 stars all around.  The actors made me forget I was watching a movie and pulled me into the story; not many can do that even with their hundreds of millions spent in production.  I can't say anything else except this movie was SUPER AWESOME.",1386374400,,565,4.403846153846154

The movie sparked some engaging discussion on forgiveness, race relations, Christ, and love.  The movie is gripping and includes great performances by all four main characters, particularly the children.  It's funny, believable and faith-filled, with an accurate representation of the tensions each character would bring to this unique scenario.

Watch this one with your children and take what you learn to heart.  Too bad the trailer gives away a little too much of the plot.  The movie unfolds beautifully if you don't what's going to happen next.",1385510400,,730,4.942622950819672

5733719,5,B00CPTUOBO,Would recommend this movie highly! Sometimes you just have to accept in faith that God's knows what is best and that he sees the Big Picture and he told us due to our sin and rebellion that there would be trouble in the life but while here if we trust him and if we allow him Lordship in this life we have a promise of eternal life....our real home is with him..lean not on our own understanding!,1383955200,,396,4.1558441558441555

It's a very good movie with a powerful message.  It not only showed God healing two families, but how He healed four individuals, each with their own issue, hurt, or problem, and how He used each healing in healing the others.  We couldn't get enough of it.  That said, we have no complaints with the quality of the DVD, the timeliness of the shipping, or the condition of the DVD once it arrived.  It was timely and well-done all around.  I highly recommend this movie.  For the record, my family consists of me (Karen: Leigh's wife), my husband Leigh, and our daughters, who are ages 10 and 8.

5733744,1,B00CPTUOBO,"There are many elements in this movie that are likeable...you can read all the rave reviews on here to see what those elements are about...

But, just in case you are a family that has a standard that is a little different than most, I wanted to share my views.  My 1 star is strictly based on the fact that I believed that this would be a Christian movie (as per the back cover & the reviews posted here).  I, therefore did not expect cursing, blaspheming of God's name, or many sexual references and innuendos.  Just to clarify, the innuendos were mainly between the married couple (so at least they are put in their proper context), however, their conversation about ""doing it"" and ""how often"" and ""all the different ways""...well, that was a little too much for my taste.  In my eyes, this is not a family movie...these scenes could have been cut out to make a more wholesome choice.

Also, do not expect to hear anything about Jesus or repentance...they do talk about God and prayer...

So, if the cursing, blaspheming God's Holy name, and the innuendos do not bother you, you will most likely enjoy this film.  If those things are deal breakers for your family, you will want to pass on this one...there are plenty of touching movies (Christian and even non-Christian) that stay away from those things.",1379030400,10,1307,4.627705627705628
