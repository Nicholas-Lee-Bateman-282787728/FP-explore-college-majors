902282,2,6304622694,"This is an example of what happens when a British film company tackles American history. The Custer story has been told in many films for many years. The various depictions are generally amusing in their fabrications, half-truths, historical inaccuracies, and outright lies. This film is essentially a B movie given a '60s Cinerama treatment that stresses visual presentation over substance. There is one long scene, for example, of a man escaping danger by riding down a miner's sluice. This segment is protracted, and one suspects it's only there to demonstrate Cinerama's camera technique. Custer (Robert Shaw, with Scottish burr intact) is depicted heroically. Reno (Ty Hardin) is disparaged as a drunken coward who failed to come to Custer's aid. The complexities of Custer's personality and the doubtful integrity of his motivations as an Indian fighter are not explored. The only Indians mentioned are the Cheyenne. The scriptwriters didn't add that the Native Americans at the Battle of Little Bighorn also included a major contingent of Sioux. Historical problems aside, the movie falters as an action-adventure film. The climactic battle is disappointingly lethargic. As Custer movies go, ""Son of the Morning Star"" is more accurate, and ""They Died With Their Boots On"" is better as an action-adventure film. ;-)",952300800,16,1321,5.355769230769231

His forces were divided and the final battle was a moving one to last stand hill. I didn't see one thing in this entire movie, (and it was hard to watch the entire thing), that had any basis in fact!  You can tell it was foreign made.

902676,5,6304622694,"I wouldn't bother to review this picture if it hadn't been for the ""alarmists"" around here, who claim that the picture has been cropped down to 1.85:1 (and this has to be assumed, when reading the back of the MGM/UA sleeve).

IT IS A TYPO! (Illiterate printers?)

IT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE AND THIS IS WHY...

The picture was filmed in the ""bastardized"" Cinerama format, which at one time was spectacular in scope and as we know from ""How the West Was Won"" (just recently reissued in a cleaned up and digitalized format) and ""The Fabulous Adventures of the Brothers Grimm"", was that famous three camera process that should have emulated ""what the eye sees"" (a sort of expanded 3D, but without the need of special spectacles), and corresponded to about 2.90:1 (HTWWW is in 2.89:1 now).

The ""bastardized"" version of Cinerama came after 1965 and was a fraud in terms, since only the name remained but in fact was just a feeble version of CinemaScope (2.35:1).
That particular format came in two frame ratios, depending on the kind of film and camera used. One was in 2.2:1, which clearly corresponded to a Todd-AO format, and the other was slightly bigger than CinemaScope and was at 2.4:1 (which is today's Panavision standard).

I have compared my videotape version of the movie of some years ago, released by ANCHOR BAY, and it was in the right ratio of 2.2:1 (even specified by the releasing company itself).

I watched them both on my 16:9 widescreen LCD TV simultaneously, and guess what?

There is absolutely no difference.

Both Anchor Bay's version and the present MGM/UA release (which is actually nothing more than the original transfer by ARTISAN, just in a different packaging and logo) are in the correct ratio.

Compared to the VHS tape there is an obvious improvement in sharpness and brighter colors. Alas, the sound is not up to par, and there is certainly a way one could improve that, but even so, it is not too bad.

There are though some artifacts that stand out, but only in scenes where there's lots of movement and therefore barely noticeable to the eye (unless one sits two inches from the screen).

Even though as a movie it is not really the greatest movie about this subject ever made (if you want a better one, you have to go back to the Errol Flynn version called ""They Died with Their Boots On""), it still stands out for performers like Robert Shaw, Jeffrey Hunter and Robert Ryan.

It is still watchable and could be taken as a treatment comparison piece to the above mentioned Errol Flynn version.

It is entertaining though, and yet not really something for the accurate historian.

It's a Western, for Heaven's sake! Enjoy it as such and have a laughter afterwards...",1222128000,6,2697,4.698513800424628

902678,3,6304622694,"Over the years, certain incidents from the Wild West have been dealt with over and over again in Hollywood; the gunfight at the OK Corral, the battle of the Alamo, and as in the case of Custer of the West, the life of George Armstrong Custer.  Following the Civil War, General Phil Sheridan gives Custer a post in the west with the 7th Cavalry and orders to clean out the Indians no matter what.  Upon arriving, Custer gets his regiment into fighting shape and unleashes attacks on the Cheyenne (no Sioux in this one).  But as he fights the Indians, Custer begins to question what he's doing and why and for who even as he greedily seeks glory.  Obviously not the best of the movies made about Custer, or the most historically accurate, but I felt there was enough here to recommend the movie.  The locations in Almeria, Spain, where many spaghetti westerns were filmed, doesn't look like the American West, but is still great to look at.  Also, there's plenty of action, including a unique look at the massacre at the Little Big Horn, and a good musical score from Bernardo Segall.  So give this movie a chance, even if it's just to see a different take on the legend of George Armstrong Custer.

  Throughout his short career that was cut short far too early, Robert Shaw tackled a wide variety of roles and here is no exception. The English actor plays Custer here and pulls it off pretty well.  He's no Errol Flynn, but Shaw tries to explain some of the complexities of the character.  He was egotistical and a glory seeker, but there's more to the man as Shaw shows.  Mary Ure isn't given much to do as Libby, Custer's wife, but she is good in the few scenes she does have.  Jeffrey Hunter and Ty Hardin play Capteen Benteen, the moralist who questions what the cavalry is doing, and Major Marcus Reno, the alcoholic second in command who hates Custer from the first time he meets him.  Neither have a ton of screen time which is a shame because they're both good actors.  Lawrence Tierney is good in a small part as General Phil Sheridan, Custer's commanding officer who is conflicted with what he has to do.  Charles Stalmaker as the eager Lt. Howells, Kieron Moore as Chief Dull Knife (no Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse here), and Robert Hall as Sgt. Buckley also star.  And in a great, if short, cameo, Robert Ryan plays Sgt. Paddy Mulligan, a 7th cavalry deserter who gets the itch for gold and tangles with Custer.

  As for the DVD, MGM went ""all out"" once again.  The widescreen presentation is good but not great and doesn't really take advantage of the Cinerama filming.  I saw a good-looking version on Turner Classic Movies recently to compare the two.  Special features are slim here as well so don't expect too much.  Still, it's an entertaining movie with some interesting cast choices and a very different look at the career and death of George Armstrong Custer.  Give Custer of the West a try!",1191283200,,2912,4.551923076923077
902728,1,6304622694,"It was once said that you shouldn't get your history or your religion from the movies, and this is a GREAT example why!  It would have you think that ALL the battles of the U.S. Civil War were fought with about a dozen Confederates and a handful of Federal cavalry.  There were even scenes of unmanned cannon firing themselves -- not an artilleryman (or anyone else) anywhere in sight!  In fact, throughout this movie all cavalry battle sequences were anemic, lethargic and DULL!  The Little Big Horn battle is a laughing stock.  The warriors' final charge is weirdly setup then staged -- probably the biggest historical inaccuracy in the whole sad world of historic inaccuracies.  To make matters worse, it was shot mostly from long distance.  Any detail of action you get will remind you of a bad-guy-indian raid on a wagon train in some obscure ""B"" western matinee.  The story of Custer between these ""battles"" is BORING!  You couldn't care less about the main characters!  To be fair though, Mr. Shaw as Armstrong (very miscast) does his best with this weak script.  In a couple of the early scenes he almost ""channels"" Errol Flynn.  Jeffrey Hunter, Robert Ryan (who turns in the BEST performance here -- but brief) and Ty Hardin were all wasted in this project.  BUT the MOST glaring fault of the movie: the 7th Cavalry's anthem of ""Garry Owen"" was never, ever played!  Not once!  Speaking of tunes, the odd soundtrack lends nothing to the flick at all.  The music rarely matches up to what is happening on the screen.  All-in-all, it is easy to see why this never made a splash (or dull thud) in the U.S. movie circuit.  Vastly better films are: THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON (historically off, but the Last Stand battle is probably the closest to the scope and intensity of the real fight); LITTLE BIG MAN (essentially an Old West history lesson that includes the Last Stand, Custer is portrayed as a total nut-case mostly for comedic relief -- but nice overall presentation of the Battle of Little Big Horn); and SON OF THE MORNING STAR (probably the most accurate of the Hollywood Custer stories).  After all is said and done, CUSTER OF THE WEST is not worth the purchase, rent or trouble.  Who could EVER fall asleep when the command ""CHARGE!"" is given?  You will!",1183852800,10,2274,4.6775818639798485
902729,2,6304622694,"CUSTER OF THE WEST (1967) might be a good movie, although it's definitely not a very good or great one.

Sorry, you just aren't supposed to watch an action movie that's missing more than a quarter of the image.

 Robert Shaw plays Custer in this biopic, director Robert Siodmak's last American film and the weakest one of his I've seen.  The movie follows Custer from the Civil War to his Last Stand at the Little Big Horn. Most of the film is devoted to Custer fighting the Cheyenne, warning Congress of government corruption, and leading his small host to its appointment with destiny.  Episodic and detached, about the only high point in the movie is a short segment in the middle with the marvelous Robert Ryan playing an Irish calvary man who wants to leave the service to take up gold mining.  Physically Shaw looks enough like Custer to pass, but he doesn't have the theatrical flair, the bigger-than-life quality that the role demands.  Even if I'd seen this in a widescreen format I don't think I would have liked it much more than I did seeing it in its butchered state.

902736,5,6304622694,"Early on in the pre-production stages CUSTER OF THE WEST was originally supposed to be directed by Akira Kurosawa. It was meant to be a biography of epic proportions combining both story and thrilling action sequences filmed in Cinerama. Eventually it was filmed in Spain in Super Technirama directed by Robert Siodmak. The production is still fairly ambitious but the screenplay by Bernard Gordon and Julian Halevy makes for a rather episodic tale lacking a narrative sweep that would have been very beneficial to this film. Part of this can be attributed to the producers' wishes to insert Cinerama-type effects (a runaway train, a downhill ride in an out-of-control buckboard, a soldier escaping down lumber jammed rapids, etc) into what should have been a straightforward biographical filming of General Custer and the historical events surrounding him. Robert Shaw gives a solid performance as General George Custer and beautifully creates another interpretation into the myth of the man. Shaw demonstrates none of the flamboyancy associated with Custer but instead concentrates on the virility and single-minded duty of his command. Through the entire film Shaw remains introverted and a somewhat enigmatic character. The viewer is never sure if Custer has a single humanitarian bone in his body because every time the question arises Shaw reverts back to his dutiful military facade.  This is demonstrated in his scenes with Dull Knife (Kieron Moore) and Sergeant Mulligan (Robert Ryan) the deserter. This film contains other good performances. Jeffrey Hunter plays Lieutenant Benteen as a professional soldier but one who is sensitive to the plight of the Indians yet never lets his sentiments interfere with his duties. On a psychological level Hunter's somber character mirrors the feelings that Custer will never show the viewer. Ty Hardin plays Major Reno a hard drinking officer with a long family military history. Custer distrusts him and Reno will eventually let him down. Lawrence Tierney plays a gruff General Philip Sheridan and a somewhat indifferent Mary Ure plays Elizabeth, Custer's wife. However, Robert Ryan is the only actor that breathes some real life into this film. We all know from history what eventually happens to Custer. Ryan's character represents the uninhibited free spirit of all men. He shows up like a guardian angle to give Custer one last chance to change his destiny. This is one of the best roles of Robert Ryan's career. The photography by Cinematographer Cecilio Paniagua is very good. The frame compositions are well thought out. His camera traverses many landscapes of open plains, rushing rivers and rolling hills very beautifully in Technicolor. The music score composed by Bernardo Segall is very different in approach and sound for a film of this type. The Brazilian composer decided to build his score on an atmosphere of heroism, which he creates and builds upon. Segall essentially puts aside most references to the traditional Western and falls back on Civil War arrangements and orchestrations (especially in the film's opening) and further period influences. Added to this Segall also seems to have been inspired by the Spaghetti Western (in the film's more reflective moments), which was at its zenith at the time this film was made. In fact, much of this film seems to have been inspired by the Spaghetti Western in its look and feel. Even though this is a Spanish-US co-production it looks more akin to a Spaghetti Western. Art designs by Jean d'Eaubonne, Eugne Louri and Julio Molina, Set designs by Antonio Mateos and Costumes by Laure de Zarate greatly contribute to the `Spaghetti' and European look of this film.
This film always intrigued me ever since it was released in 1968. In fact it hardly got released. It only showed at my neighborhood theatre in a 90 minute edited version. I remember reading in a newspaper at the time that the film was going to be released in a drastically cut version in the United States by Cinerama Releasing Corp. That was that! Now, thanks to Anchor Bay Entertainment this film has been released at this 141 minute length. Visually Anchor Bay produces the best DVDs. (You have really got to see Anchor Bay's DVD of Disney's ISLAND AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD to really appreciate how good their product is.) That aside CUSTER OF THE WEST remains a good film and an epic in its own right. The rousing Civil War sequence at the beginning of the film is some of the best work ever put on film. Irving Lerner, not Robert Siodmak, directed this brilliant opening and shows us Custer a man driven by duty. Custer's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn is perhaps not historically accurate but is very impressively staged and filmed and gives the viewer an idea of the scope of Custer's folly. Bernardo Segall's music at the denouement is very poignant. Above all, the brilliant Super Technirama photography effects are like a real roller coaster ride and are crisp and colorful as ever. This is a great DVD.",994377600,50,4995,5.0108303249097474
7874855,3,6304622694,"RELEASED IN 1967 and directed by Robert Siodmak, ""Custer of the West"" is a French/Spanish/American production starring Robert Shaw as the titular hero who becomes the youngest general in the Civil War at 23 and then goes on to fight in the Indian Wars of the northern plains, eventually dying at the Battle of Little Bighorn at the age of 36. Mary Ure plays Custers wife while Ty Hardin and Jeffrey Hunter play his subordinates Major Reno and Capt. Benteen. Lawrence Tierney is on hand as Gen. Sheridan.

Custer of the West both stresses the mistreatment of the plains Indians by the U.S. and portrays Custer as a tragic American hero who was a puppet of government policy. The film is usually lambasted for its inaccuracies, particularly its depiction of the closing battle. For instance, in real-life Custer's soldiers surprised the Native encampment, they didn't ride up and dialogue with the waiting Indians; moreover, the battle was a chaotic one, moving toward Last Stand Hill. Yet its not like previous films were any more accurate, e.g. They Died with Their Boots On (1941), but audiences apparently demanded more accuracy by the late 60s.

Regardless, the gist of events is true: Reno and Benteen were real-life subordinate officers at odds with Custer and reportedly failed him on the day of battle, although they supposedly had justified cause. If I were Benteen, I wouldve probably done what he did in the face of Custers glory-hound rashness and a formidable foe: Dig in, face the enemy, and survive to fight another day. In any case, if you want historical accuracy (to a point) see Son of the Morning Star (1991).

The main problem I have with this movie are the Spanish locations substituting for Virginia, the Dakotas and Montana. Fortunately, the creators at least tried to find a setting with trees for Virginia and some of the locations they used for Dakota/Montana occasionally work (just occasionally). But theres a long desert sequence when nothing of the sort exists in the region. Youd have to go far south to New Mexico/Arizona or way further west to eastern Washington to find such deserts.

If you can ignore the disingenuous topographies, theres a lot to appreciate in Custer of the West. But the films overlong and bogged down by tedious or useless sequences, like the capture/imprisonment of Sgt. Mulligan (Robert Ryan). But there are some gems, like when Dull Knife (Kieron Moore) pays Custer a visit at the fort (which in real life didn't have a timber stockade). Custer bluntly conveys to the Chief the simple (awful) truth about conquerors and those they conquer: The problem is precisely the same as when you Cheyenne decided to take another tribe's hunting ground. You didn't ask them about their rights. You didn't care if they had been there a thousand years. You just had more men and more horses. You destroyed them in battle. You took what you wanted and, right or wrong, for better or worse, that is the way things seem to get done. That's history.

FYI: Deviating from the original script, Robert Shaw made the character of Custer over to suit himself, turning him into a sadist of Shakespearean depth. He also directed the battle scenes with Siodmak staging everything else.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 21 minutes and was mostly shot 30 miles from Madrid, Spain, except for the Battle of Little Bighorn which was filmed in Costa del Sol near Almira. WRITERS: Bernard Gordon and Julian Zimet with additional work by Shaw.

7874858,2,6304622694,"Watchable but heavily flawed western. Full of inaccuracies, where they shot the Battle of Little Big Horn being nothing like the place really is, and Custer's demise at the end is pure Hollywood hokum. Robert Shaw's performance is the best thing this movie has going for it.",1516492800,,274,4.851063829787234
7874859,4,6304622694,"Excellent blu-ray picture, given the age of the movie. Unfortunately the sound is only in stereo and for a Cinerama released movie - they were all in 6 track sound in those days - a little disappointing. No special features - only previews of other movies. A good cast and Robert Shaw is excellent as Custer.",1513728000,,308,4.517857142857143

7874862,3,6304622694,"In the first place, Custer was not a general at the time of the Little Big Horn, he was a lieutenant colonel. Otherwise, there are lots of inaccuracies in this movie. There is no court martial the one in which he got stripped of his generalship, and dismissed to private life for over a year. Having actually been to the battle ground site, I believe the final assault to be completely inaccurate. it shows he and his men trapped in a very small space and not very many Indians. The battle is spread out over a larger area. No mention of the Indian leaders in the movie at all who included Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull. Other than that, the movie is a fun western with top notch people including Robert Shaw as Custer. Originally presented in the single lens Cinerama process, this movie is letterboxed, but omits original overture, intermission and exit music prevalent in the day. A better movie about Custer is the Errol Flynn starrer They Died With their Boots On. Also no explanation about the aftermath. Most of the plains Indians went to reservations after this. there was one more fight, in 1890 at a place called Wounded Knee in South Dakota.",1508457600,,1151,4.592233009708738
