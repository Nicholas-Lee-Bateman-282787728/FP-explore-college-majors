2831939,5,B000Q6GUS4,"The seasons just got better and better on JAG... DJE and CB were the best couple w. amazing chemistry!!!! The acting was great from the start, but as the years went by the acting got that much better!!!!!! CB is without a doubt one of the most underrated young actresses today- just go and watch her performance in JAG and currently Army Wives and she will soooo not disappoint!! DJE was (and is ) the hottest military guy on TV!!! Get all of the JAGs and you won't be disappointed!! Just now waiting for Season 5!!!!",1189900800,3,517,4.395833333333333
2831940,5,B000Q6GUS4,"The subject matter of this series becomes more relevant with the passage of time. With the divisiveness in our country over military matters becoming ever more profound with each passing day, I believe it is imperative to take a time out and look back at JAG and see what the military is all about. These are honorable decent men and women that serve our country. Even with the sometimes contrived storylines, JAG the 4th season still puts the lives of our service people in perspective, and brings the reality of military service to those who watch it. I look forward to future release of the subsequent seasons of JAG to DVD. It is an important series that may be more important now than it ever was when the episodes first aired. We, as Americans can differ in our views, but there is one factor that should bring solidarity among us: We must support our military because they put themselves in harm's way all over the world to protect the right to dissent here at home.",1189814400,3,973,4.565714285714286

I enjoy the plots and characters, and it is one series that allows the characters to grow and develop over the 10 years it was in production. Its portrayal of the Navy is responsible and favorable enough to get a lot of cooperation from the armed forces.",1185926400,14,325,4.258064516129032

2831988,5,B000Q6GUS4,"JAG Season 4 - [0727 - reviewed October 2, 2017]

Summary:
JAG stands for Judge Advocate General - essentially lawyers in uniform versed in military law that investigate and litigate violation of the UCMJ -Uniform Code of Military Justice. The leading actor in these shows is James Elliott who plays Harmon ""Harm"" Rabb a former Navel aviator turned JAG lawyer. Harm is supported by three very capable actors but make no mistake the shows pivot around Commander Harmon Rabb.  In each show there is either a violation of the UCMJ that requires investigation or a member of the military requires legal assistance. Most episodes take place on navel vessels or military bases and feature impressive photography of ships and planes.

Content:
The Season 4 package consists of 6 disks and 24 episodes originally show on the CBS Network during the period September 22, 1998 through May 25 1999. Oddly and disappointing there are no deleted, extended scenes or ""extras"" making of video. Sometimes these extras add immensely to the pleasure of watching an admired show.

Positive Comments:
I have recently watched seasons 1-3 on DVD and was sufficiently interested in the military/legal subject matter to continue on with season 4. To be truthful a few of the shows from S1-3 were ""just ok"" and were only mildly entertaining. CBS took over from NBC as broadcaster of this show and the episodes during season 4 have been uniformly excellent. I will go so far to say that my wife and I greatly looked forward to the next episode - a rare occurrence by us jaded TV viewers!.

As with most long run TV shows there is a multi-season unanswered story line that is intended to keep faithful fans returning to see how it's resolved. In the case of JAG we are informed that Harmon ""Harm"" Rabb's father, a fighter pilot during the Viet-Nam war who was shot down and assumed to be dead, is very possibly alive and a prisoner in Moscow. In the context of the series so far as I have seen this is presented as a plausible state of affairs, admittedly without any hard proof. This story line plays very credibly as a mostly background buzz in many episodes.

The Cast:
James Elliott who plays Harmon ""Harm"" Rabb is movie star hansom and all the lady want to cozy up to him - it's that kind show. Interestingly ""Harm"" although enjoying the attention of the ladies maintains a sardonic twinkle in his eyes and, so far, forgoes any intimacies. The supporting actors are quite good and attest to that fact that this show ran for 10 seasons with essentially the same cast which is quite an accomplishment in it's own right.

Negative Comments:
I know this is ""entertainment television"" but I have never seen so many extraordinary attractive and shapely women in military uniforms - nice eye candy but so unbelievable.

In many respect these shows are recruiting documentaries for the military - nothing wrong with that - it pays to advertise - as long as all the dress white uniforms and screaming jets don't dazzle the uniformed.

As mentioned with S4 the plot complexities are compelling and the jets and starched whites fade into the background.

My Opinion:
Highly recommended - if you like uniformed military lawyers, on  jets, helicopters and aircraft carriers solving cases of murder and espionage. These show work very well for me and as 10 seasons attest for many other viewers too.",1475366400,,3362,4.789291882556132

It tells the stories that always seem to be stood by the basic principles of human kind and also shows humanity in every day functions.

It shows  much of what the military people may have to go through within political limitations and its incompetency.  I believe those environment will be always there.  This also shows how critical it is for the American people to elect the best people possible for our leaders.  It makes the viewers to wonder how much truths are set aside when decisions are made by our leaders in this country.

The tools in the show may get outdated but what the creator wants to tell the viewers will always be refreshing.
It has great casts and the leading man (David James Elliot) is the perfect man to play the role, hansom, great voice, and great acting)  He also pays very close attention to the detail in his role.  After you see the show a movie such as 'Top Gun' looks very tinny.  Tom Cruise does not even come close in his role next to David J Elliot.  It is no wonder he has earned a 'Audy Murphy' award for his performance.

I can also understand why this show has not been a darling of Holliwood because all the principles presented in JAG are against what they believe in the movie kingdom.",1389052800,3,1475,4.496240601503759

2832254,5,B000Q6GUS4,"This is an EXCELLENT show; from seasons 1-10...

The following is my comment to a 2 star review for the 4th season; which I find an odd way to judge the series anyhow.  Either you like it and watch all seasons possible, or you watch a couple of shows and you're done.  This person doesn't seem worthy of writing the review if he started in the middle and watched a few episodes.  I couldn't help but notice his HOBBY of writing so many reviews of everything.

I have to give HIGH HONOURS for this show; if only for others like myself who heard about [it], had many relatives involved in many wars and services, and just took it as a part of life.  This show, although glamorized, will change your perspective of what National Defense and patriotism mean...
............
I think you missed the whole POINT of the series; and couldn't possibly have watched the whole season, yet alone the full 10 years it ran, and come to the conclusion that you did. If so, you saw only what you wanted; ""Politically Correct storylines with purty people flirting or otherwise fooling around. Good entertainment after a fashion, but not my cup of tea.""

If this were true, I don't think the Navy and the Marines would have exposed themselves as much as they did. What JAG, the TV show did was show you, using actual scenarios from many different cases, much of the true heroism these men and women did and faced. Much was taken out of true files, as taught in one of the documentaries of Bellisario. As the show earned the respect from the ""real life"" Marines and Navy, they were invited to learn more about the actual protocols, happenings, receive real film footage, etc. This all began in Season 2 and continued through the complete series. I think the show has been a dedication to ALL those serving.

More important than the inner office workings (which seem to be what you noticed; this is a GOOD storyline if you follow it), is seeing how all the battle equipment looks & works, the ranks and roles of the people, protocols, etc. I have learned SO MUCH. This is real military footage; (and my husband backs up at least the Navy protocols/ rules, etc). There were also official Navy and Marine representatives on stage/scene/filming, making sure everything is as realistic as possible for the audience to follow.

Yes, it all seems to happen to this one, small, head of JAG unit, of dashing young men and women; but this IS a TV series and needs to keep the social dilemmas, histories, etc, ""where they all came from to where they strive to get themselves to""; that is necessary to discuss the real social problems that remain the undercurrents of these special ""grin and bear it"" personalities. As many of the court cases show, it is an opportunity to take something to the public that needs to be rethought. A large variety of actual ""truths"" come forward in an investigation, that may not have been foreseen initially. There is a lot of ""gray area"" in the court room which leaves the viewer with something to think about for a few days; not just in the JAG court room, but also how it applies into their own lives.

Many of us have our own jobs that risk lives and careers within split seconds, and work hard to get to that highest of perfection; where we know that those who are counting on us have a very good chance of finding 'our best moment' in there. There are many people and occupations that reach that high, but this show is the ONLY SHOW I know of that gives you an inner look, as realistic as it can be, to those people who choose these careers, with so much at stake. I have learned such GREAT RESPECT for ALL THOSE involved in our military. I think we heard so much about it while growing up, that we never understood the true dedication, heartaches and misfortunes.

This IS a much better series than you rated it.
Perhaps you should have stopped watching it once it wasn't for you...",1235952000,,3890,4.511363636363637

2832257,5,B000Q6GUS4,"I didn't watch Jag until it was in the 10th season. Recently I caught it on TV reruns and got totally hooked. I had to get the DVD's. Needless to say I LOVE Harm Rabb, he couldn't be any cuter. Season two brought Catherine Bell on the scene as Harm's Partner. I love the immediate chemistry between them and the looks Harm gives her...my heart swoons. The love is there for sure now but they cannot act on it.

I didn't think it would keep getting better and better but what can I say it does. Season 4 is no dissapointment. I love how it is current with the year it was made as far as what wars are going on.

I think watching this also makes us remember our troops more and all they are doing for us. We can sit and enjoy watching DVD's safe in our homes because they are protecting and defending our freedom.

The adventures are so varied and different in each show. Season two has more courtroom time it's investigations and drama.

2832296,4,B000Q6GUS4,"Season four provides more depth to the main characters in JAG.  Harm and Mac survive the cliffhanger in which they were dangling in the last episode of season three, and the search for Harm's father comes to a conclusion.  The chemistry between Harm and Mac continues to grow, but neither Harm nor Mac are anywhere near making a committment.  Harm is still ""playing the field,"" and emotional wounds from Mac's past require more than bandaids to heal.  We see more of AJ's life before and beyond being the Navy's Judge Advocate General, and Bud becomes a ""real"" lawyer and shows that he is more than just the comic relief for the series.

The action episodes contine to thrill, but at times with resolutions that stretch plausability. ""The Embassy"" is probably the best with a plot twist that explores the limits of military solutions to the world's problems and lifts the series above military recruiting propaganda.  ""Nobody's Child"" and ""Goodbyes"" present an emoltional side of Harm we knew he had but only saw glimpses of before.  Most of the courtroom episodes are much more realistic than shows like the legal farce, ""Matlock,""(my 35 years practicing law more than qualify me to say this) but ""People v. Mac"" strains legal credibility.  However, the episode does give us a glimpe into Mac's Freudian past, and presents a disturbing insight into Brumby, a newcomer to JAG.

Although all of the episodes can ""stand alone,"" CIA Agent Clayton Webb, Congressperson Bobbi Latham, Vietnam vet Roscoe Martin, SEAL Lt. Vernon Rivers,  Lt. Cmdr. Theresa Coulter, Francesca Paretti (AJ's daughter) and Special Agent Clark Palmer (Boo!), all reappear from past seasons in their good/good, bad/good or bad/bad rolls.  However viewing these episodes without at least a fleeting knowledge of what went before does not allow one to experience the growth of the characters in their rolls that makes the series all that more entertaining and enjoyable.",1190419200,18,1939,5.047021943573668
