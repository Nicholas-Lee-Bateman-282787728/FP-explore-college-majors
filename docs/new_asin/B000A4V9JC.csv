2359936,5,B000A4V9JC,"I have been looking for this movie ever since I saw it with my dad 30 years ago.  I keep going on Amazon and get the same message -- not available.  Well, Amazon, the movie is great and if you have any influence with the movie company, you would have them put it on a DVD.  Edward G. Robinson is a performer who ""predicts"" for the members of the audience.  It is all a scam untl one night he really gets to predict something true.  It starts a chain reaction.  It is one of the scariest (without special effects) movies I have ever seen.  What do you say Amazon, use your influence.  Thanks.  Kathy",1320019200,14,598,4.175438596491228
2359937,5,B000A4V9JC,"This is one of the best film noir thrillers I've ever seen, remembered with great admiration for the role of Edward G. Robinson in particular (one of the few movies in which he does not play a gangster or a heavy). It is beyond my comprehension to find it is no longer available. Robinson was an exceptional actor and personality who was rarely given the chance to step out of the Gangster stereotype. Gail Russell, in this one of her few films, is also an outstanding choice for the role of the threatened heroine. Anyone having an old VHS copy please let me know!",1301702400,13,565,4.4423076923076925

8074510,5,B000A4V9JC,"Come on Paramount. Get off you duff and release this classic on DVD. It is criminal that one of the finest
film noirs with a performance as brilliant as Edward G. Robinson's lies in the vaults gathering dust.
I don't understand  Paramount being so behind the times with the wonderful Fox films, RKO films and the classics from Warner Brothers being released on DVD.
Why should we have to go Germany or Spain to get a copy of a great American film?
If it is MCA holding on to all these titles, then shame on you.
Aside from my diatribe, this film is worth finding in any format as it is one of the best 40's mysteries around. Robinson gives his usual broken man performance as he did so well in THE RED HOUSE. the film moves along rapidly at 80 minutes and in support of Edddie G. is Gail Russell as gorgeous as ever and so perfect for the role of the tormented girl whose very life has been fortold to end at the strike of eleven. John Lund, one of HOLLYWOOD'S most under-rated actors(watch FOREIGN AFFAIR, MISS TATLOCK'S MILLIONS, THE MATING SEASON or TO EACH HIS OWN)  and you will agree. Riveting and great film noir and the breath-taking Gail Russell as an added attraction.",1468108800,,1178,4.423963133640553
8074511,5,B000A4V9JC,"Today marked the opening of Noir City D.C. the annual festival of film noir held at the AFI Theater in Silver Spring.  A large audience of dedicated film noir fans came out to see the opening show at 11:00 a.m -- the 1948 film ""The Night has a Thousand Eyes"".  Those in attendance had the opportunity to hear Eddie Muller, known as  the ""czar of noir"" offer a brief introduction to the film. The film apparently is no longer available on DVD.

""The Night has a Thousand Eyes""  benefits from being seen in a beautiful old-style theater on a large screen.  The film is based on a novel of the same name by Cornell Woolrich (1903 -- 1968) whose works form the basis of many noir movies. The film tells the story of a phony mind-reader who performs in sleazy shows, John Triton, who suddenly discovers he in fact possesses psychic powers.  Triton is able to predict impending catastrophic events but unfortunately is unable to prevent them.  He becomes an outcast in his own mind and in the minds of others and leads the life of a recluse.  In the film, Triton meets the beautiful young daughter of a woman he once loved and tries to save her from what he sees in his mind as her impending violent death.

Edward G. Robinson offers a convincing performance of the tormented psychic Triton while Gail Russell plays the young woman, Jean, and John Lund plays her highly skeptical boyfriend, Elliott. John Farrow directed.  The film's main musical theme has become famous.  The cinematography by John Seitz is classic film noir with its dark, angular scenes.  The most effective theme is the opening with two onrushing trains passing one another on a dark night at a remote station, as Elliott saves Jean from an attempted suicide. The movie also includes highly effective night street scenes and scenes of the tawdry kinds of shows in which Triton got his start.

I look forward every year to Noir City DC.  I enjoyed the opportunity to see ""The Night has a Thousand Eyes"" on screen in company with other noir lovers and Eddie Muller. The film has been well-maintained and the print and sound were clear and a pleasure to watch. It would be good to have this film noir reissued on DVD.

8074514,5,B000A4V9JC,I have been after this movie for a long time. I only wish the Studio (Paramount) would bring out an official release. The quality was what you would expect from a video taped copy. I did notice that noise was visible at the bottom of the screen and the start and end title were slightly incomplete.,1418860800,,298,4.339285714285714

8074516,4,B000A4V9JC,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I saw it as a kid on late night television and found the story intriguing.  It is a little dated and maybe a little over the top in melodramatic dialog, but Robinson is in great form and even John Lund isn't quite as stiff as he usually is.  Gail Russell was a beautiful if not somewhat typed character.  One of my favorite things about the movie is the hauntingly beautiful musical score by the often overlooked master Victor Young.  The print on this version was a little dark.  I would love to have a freshly minted, well restored version.",1376265600,7,587,4.388888888888889
8074517,4,B000A4V9JC,I saw first this movie when it was released in the 40's or 50's. It is a suspenseful drama with a surprise ending. Edward G. Robinson is at his best and the cinematography is excellent in maintaining the suspense. Black and white was the best choice for this film because it adds to the drama. I recommend it for anyone who likes old classics.,1371254400,5,343,4.375
8074518,3,B000A4V9JC,"This is a terrible print of a decent film. The concept of the story I found interesting enough but the real reason to see the movie is to watch the great Edward G. Robinson. Once again, he turns in a superb and affecting performance. Unfortunately, this copy of the movie is abysmal. I stuck it out, though, because of Mr. Robinson.",1369872000,6,332,4.459016393442623
