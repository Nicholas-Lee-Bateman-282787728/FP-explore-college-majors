8400436,4,B003MR7HI6,"This series is great and I love Ruth Watson's way of presenting but what disappointed me was that in this 2 DVD set, there are actually only 6 episodes in total; they are actually episodes from Country House Revisited and so whilst interesting, most of the ones from the 2008 series are not here, except for the tiny selection on the DVD. Was looking forward to sinking into all the episodes but there's not enough on here to make it really satisying.",1410998400,2,451,4.512195121951219
8400437,5,B003MR7HI6,This is the first of 5 seasons for Country House.  Ruth Watson can be a bit brash at times but tells the owners exactly what needs to be done to save these beautiful homes from destruction.  Recommend the entire series but can only be streamed via other sources.,1401926400,,262,4.4375
