8018320,5,B0001YJ4BQ,"I got this as a digital download to my iPad using Amazon's new app, and it is exactly what I wanted.  There was no music in the background, only soothing waves and beautiful scenery.  (I looked through all the relaxation videos I could find for download, and they all had music in the background.) I'm pretty sure that the video quality would be greatly improved if I purchased the actual DVD version from the creator's website, wavesdvd.com, but for my purposes the digital download is just fine.",1346803200,3,497,4.7011494252873565

8018322,4,B0001YJ4BQ,"Feeling depressed? Feeling overwhelmed at your job? Feeling those wintertime woes? Then this is THE DVD for you! Whenever you feel like getting away from it all, push play and you are instantly in the Bahamas! The scenery is amazing and the waves are realistic. There are no people, no traffic, no commercials, no cells phones, no music, no voices- just nature. It's you and the beach. The locations chosen are truly awe-inspiring. Very soothing & relaxing dvd. 60 minutes, then it loops (replays). Highly recommended.",1196553600,,518,5.034883720930233

8018324,5,B0001YJ4BQ,"If you are weary of conflict and violence and all the negativity

the media throws at you.  If just want to be away.  If you love

the sea.  The Best Bahamas Beaches is the therapy you seek.

For me, it is the runaway best video experience in 60 years of viewing.",1152316800,3,263,4.0588235294117645
8018325,5,B0001YJ4BQ,"The DVD is great. Beautiful beach scenery and minimal graphics. Perfect for setting the mood in your home when you need to relax.

I actually bought the DVD because I'm in a Jimmy Buffett cover band. ( [...] ) One bar we play at has a huge screen TV on stage behind where I put my drums. We turn it off when we play but I figured there's gotta be something better than playing in front of a big blank screen. Much of Buffett's music is about the beach, the vacation mindset, and the distant locations that many of us long for. This DVD is the perfect backdrop for the music and vibe we put out during our performances. It's gorgeous, yet it's not busy so it isn't distracting. The creative uses for this beautiful DVD are only limited by your own imagination!",1106697600,4,759,4.3076923076923075
8018326,5,B0001YJ4BQ,"Another great wave virtual vacation dvd this one features the bahamas. This dvd looks similar to Caribbean Beaches with lapping waves but the islands look a little different. My favorite scene is the thunderstorm which is on Day 2 Shot 4 and 5. If you look carefully on shot 4 you will see a flash of lightning over the ocean overlooking the dark thundercloud. This is sheet lightning(cloud to cloud)you then hear several claps of thunder over the ocean shot 5. Interestly the waves don't seem to get bigger as the storm moves in they continue lapping. Another one of my favorite scenes is the lighthouse on Day 5 shot 3 and 4 with ocean views in the forground and I love many of the ocean views on this dvd as well. The waves are mostely lapping but occasionally they are so calm you get quiter wavelets. The picture is crisp similar to the caribbean beaches dvd it really brings out the blues and greens of the waves and the transistions from day to day are very quick. Also each day ends with a beautiful sunset. Make sure you turn on the beach subtitles to see were you are on Abaco,Eleuthera and New Providence. Just go to the beach subtitles in the menu or cut on subtitles on your remote. Now you can see the Bahamas when you want too. The Virgin Islands one is now available too. I highly recommend the Bahamas Beaches.",1082160000,8,1327,4.442622950819672
