8383803,5,B002XPQZDQ,"For my 85th birthday my nephew and his wife gave me the DVD called ""The Yiddish Theater-A Love Story"".
 I absolutely lovedit! I showed it to several friends who felt the same way. If you remember the Yiddish theater from your younger days, you will love this. It is very nostalgic and reminds you of the ""Good old days"" when going to the yiddish theatre brought so much joy and entertainment to families. I loved this video and so will you. I have already seen it several times and enjoy it each time, and so will you. The nominal purchase price will bring you dividends of joy! ENJOY!!!",1390953600,4,587,4.435185185185185
