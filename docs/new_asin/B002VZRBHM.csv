8479364,4,B002VZRBHM,"LOTS of good footage from different hunts and setups.  Each hunt includes a lot of the activity and not just chopped up, highly edited, animals falling with the host bubbling out a catch phrase.  I took away a star simply because they ought to have included an instructional piece.  If not in the regular feature than at least from the main menu.  I would have liked to have seen more explained like blind choice, how to identify gender/species of bird in flock, and something about calls, to name a few.  There is, however, intelligent conversations throughout.

I would recommend to those who would like to see excellent waterfowl hunts as well as to beginners who want to get a feeling for what to expect.",1365811200,,708,4.669354838709677
