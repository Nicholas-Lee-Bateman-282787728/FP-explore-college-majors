7963030,4,B000067IYA,"I would make this a 5 star dvd, but the background music is irritating!  I solve that by putting in one ear bud with my own music.  I break a sweat, the time flys and the ladies on the video don't drive me crazy!  If you're looking for an exercise video to make use of that large walking surface sitting around your house this is it.",1263427200,,333,4.015151515151516
7963031,4,B000067IYA,Good workout.  The two instructors provide lots of options for different levesl of fitness.  I was really sweating after the sprints.  Good for me because alone on my treadmill I won't sprint.  The workout with weights was also a great change from the regular routine of walking on a treadmill for 45 minutes.,1187654400,,309,4.773584905660377
7963032,4,B000067IYA,"Thanks to this DVD I am jogging for the first time in my life. This DVD is really motivating and challenging. I am definetly at the ""beginner"" level and have been doing this routine for over a month so I certainly have room for improvement. I too am at my target heat rate for 36 minutes. They go by pretty fast. I definely reccomed this one!",1150070400,3,342,4.196969696969697
7963033,3,B000067IYA,"i really wasn't pushing my speed while watching the golden girls. this dvd will help you pick up the pace, I don't keep up with the lead instructor yet, but the second in command goes at a slower pace. it's not exciting (it's a TREADMILL DVD, guys) but i have noticed going back to watching tv and walking i'm moving faster and more willing to incline. i just use the dvd when i feel i'm falling back to a slower pace.",1142553600,4,418,4.172839506172839
7963034,4,B000067IYA,"You will definitely sweat if you do this workout.  The trainers change the pace and incline quickly and often, which may keep some off balance.  Moreover, when the trainers told me what levels they were working at, I could hardly believe it.  They were at 4.5 and weren't even jogging.  The advanced ones were running at a 6.0 level!  I have a hard time understanding that.  I guess all treadmills are not designed alike.  This workout is good in that you can do it at your own pace.  (I did it at a much less intense level than even the recommendations for beginners and was still within my target heart rate zone for 36 minutes!)  One drawback:  the strength segments are done while you are walking on the treadmill.  I find it hard to use a heavier weight while walking at 3.5 or 4 mph.  Moreover, I don't think the pace of the lifting coincides with the pace of your feet making for a somewhat off balance walk.  They covered biceps, triceps, shoulders and deltoids on the treadmill during the cardio segment.  Then, following the walk, you are expected to do floor work, including some pushups, lunges and abs. The instructors are chatty and repetitive, but I didn't find them aggravating or obnoxious.",1131580800,10,1207,4.605633802816901
7963035,4,B000067IYA,I am very happy with the service I received.  The VHS I ordered arrived in a very timely manner and in very good condition.,1126569600,,123,4.125
7963036,3,B000067IYA,"I rented this DVD from Netflix and I'm glad I didn't buy it. What I wasn't aware of until I was actually on my treadmill doing it was that in addition to walking/running, you are supposed to lift weights at the same time! Bicep, triceps curls, shoulder lifts....it was all a bit too much for me. I was looking for something that just focused on increasing one's speed and incline.

If I'm doing cardio I want to do cardio, if I'm lifting weights I want to lift weights, I'm not one that like to mix the two. If you are that type, maybe this video is for you.

The treadmill/resistance training workout lasts for about 35 minutes. Afterwards, you get off the treadmill and do lunges (!) and then an ab workout using the treadmill to prop your feet. One problem I found was that since my treadmill was up against the wall in the corner, I couldn't perform all the exercises. Finally, there is a cooldown which again uses the treadmill and a prop.

If you are the slightest bit uncoordinated, you will need to be very careful with this workout. Trying to keep up your speed and correctly lift weights is a challenge. There is also a stage where they are skipping on the treadmill which is very unsafe to do on a typical home treadmill.

I give it 3 stars because it's not a terrible workout if you are looking to mix running and lifting weights. However if you are looking for a spinning type video for your treadmill, you should look somewhere else.",1112832000,14,1447,4.408239700374532
7963037,4,B000067IYA,"I have been working out on my treadmill for about 4 years now. I went from listening to music to watching TV while walking on it. I was getting bored with the same routine. Then I found out through the internet that this DVD excists. I was very hesitant to buy it, because I got burned before buying fitness tapes without viewing them first.
If you are looking for an easy to follow workout DVD for the treadmill, this is it. I was able to get the moves on the first try (which usually is not the case for me). The time flies and I get a total body workout. I like the fact that I can adjust the speed and intensity of the workout to my liking, without missing a beat. Great for all levels of fitness.
I also bought the other Treadmoves DVD. I have a bit of a hard time with the side step shuffles. My treadmill is not as wide as theirs and I am afraid to fall. Maybe with some practice I will be more comfortable to do this move. All in all not as easy to follow, therefore is not as much fun for me.",1042588800,35,1001,3.985074626865672
