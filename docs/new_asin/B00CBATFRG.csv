8579660,2,B00CBATFRG,"This blu ray set began down one star due to its intermittent POOR picture quality. See attached photo of just how bad it gets. This is blu ray recorded in 2012; you'd think you're watching a VHS with severe degeneration from 1987.
The edits were a huge draw for me: a condensed Ring -- I can get my fix without a 15-hour commitment! But the edits, to me, have more to do with accommodating the story that was shoved onto the Ring. I enjoy both traditional and regie productions, but this one simply doesn't work. They cut out Donner, Froh, and Erda (imagine the Entrance of the Gods into Valhalla sans ""Heda, hedo!"") and other iconic parts of the Ring, then characters ramble on where there's plenty fat to be trimmed. No thanks. No Hojoto-ho at the beginning of the second act of Walkre. A shortened Ride of the Valkyries...
The singing is adequate with no real standouts. I enjoyed Linda Watson's Brunnhilde from Bayreuth, but here something is amiss; perhaps she wasn't feeling the production either.",1497744000,3,1003,4.672316384180791

8579663,1,B00CBATFRG,"One star for the concept. Setting the music drama in Argentina during the 1970s when the generals ruled and identifying the Rhine Gold with the Argentinian children who were stolen is a wonderful idea. I wish the producer and the director could have done the complete Ring. The cuts are terrible and disasterous. Most of the time the story line does not make sense due to the cuts. The excuse that people today are fast paced and cannot watch a 16 hour music drama is nonsense. Are we going to see Hamlet is 5 minutes very soon? What's wrong with you people? Cutting great master works of art is an insult to the art. If you cannot watch Wagner complete, please go watch popular music. You don't deserve Wagner. The performance is ok. Some of the singers are terrible. The whole opera stands on the shoulders of Linda Watson as Brunhilde. She rescued the production and encouraged the Colon Theater to produce it after Katherina Wagner, the great great grand daughter of the composer who was supposed to direct it quit.",1372377600,26,1019,4.6353591160221
