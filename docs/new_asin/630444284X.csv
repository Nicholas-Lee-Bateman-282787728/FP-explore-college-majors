886022,5,630444284X,"I have heard John Leguizamo say he prefers not to talk about his movie. While by no means his finest hour, it is chock full of banal humor. Which after a hard day is just how I like it.  So, If you prefer not to think while relaxing, but just want to chuckle throughout, then this movie is for you too.

It is so amazingly bad, it's good.",1471996800,4,338,3.9558823529411766

This movie makes no sense it really has no plot.  I mean there is kind of a story about him being hunted by rich a-holes.  Then there is the obviously gay child of the rich a-hole thrown in there for no apparent reason.  They use the word pheromone a lot in this movie.  This movie is really one long skit showing all of the characters John Leguzamo can do.  If you are not a huge fan of him, I wouldn't waste your time on this one.",1443052800,,600,4.042735042735043

886233,5,630444284X,"This is a comedy spoof of Van Damme's 'Hard Target' and Ice-T's 'Surviving The Game'. It takes an ethnic con-artist and gives him a chance to win $50,000 if he makes it to the end of the race.
The twist the plot follows is someone is hunting him for sport. Once this is realized by our main character, he's got to find a way to stop this and save his own life at the same time.
Using John Leguizamo as the main character offers a bit of crude slapstick comedy that does present very funny episodes during the movie",1436313600,,514,4.202020202020202

It most likely is inspired and adapts from both films--both serious films while this was a farce and satire.  Perhaps not politically correct if analyzing those ""Quacky"" and karaoke scenes?

Some would say too much emphasis on bodily humor, but this is a film about hunting--the outdoors--where men (& women) squat and use pheremones [""Father, I feel funny""] to attract prey!

It's filled with comedy, whackyness and over the top humour, you could say it's a real life cartoon in ways. John plays a funny charactor named Pestorio ""Pest"" and also Mad TV's Aries Spears plays his best friend along with a bunch of unknowns.

Overall the movie has some funny stuff and it's pretty underrated. I hope John didn't apologise for it, he has nothing to apologise about for this film. Bring on The Return Of The Pest. (Part 2)

The bonus features are an Audio Commentary (zzzz) and a badly done biography read on John and the producer. And there is also a 5 minute featureete / behind the scenes thing and a couple of trailers.

John actualy wrote the opening song he's singing and it's hillarious to hear what he can come up with in improv. It's only a cheapie, so it's worth the price. Other wise rent it before dissmissing it, it is highly underrated.",1120435200,2,1066,4.363636363636363

The great thing about this movie is how Leguizamo acts like a live, human version of Bugs Bunny. This is the type of slapstick rarely seen in modern films. Further, Leguizamo mocks all people who think of race in solely black&white terms by his ethnic drag of all cultures. Too funny. And the ""Latinus S___ticus"" gag was rollover funny!

It's kind of fitting that Bevis and Butthead are referred to several times in the film, because that's about what it's like, minus the social satire. You could spend all day listing flaws (the humor is juvenile and often in bad taste, Jeffrey Jones' ridiculous German accent comes and goes without warning, and the guy playing his son shows no acting ability at all...) - but what's the point?

886829,5,630444284X,The Pest is the greatest and funniest movie I have ever seen! It is the best movie to see if you have been feeling down! John Leguizamo plays a very good role in this movie and I love the song he sings at the beginning and at the end. It's a good movie for teens and adults. I highly recommend that you should either rent or buy it! It's hilarious! I loved it!!!,1025568000,,362,3.9726027397260273
886830,3,630444284X,"This is a quirky, throw-away joke comedy along the lines of ""Dude, wheres my car?"" or ""Pootie-Tang"". It has it's funny moments, but it tends to slug along with witless minority humor and seemingly pointless sub-plots. It can get pretty over the top. John Leguizamo gives a bad good performance. He flawlessly captures the pure essence of an annoying and crazy character. This is essentially a ""chase"" movie. The premise is somewhere along the lines of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" but it takes the idea of a bored hunter hunting humans in a whole new and strange direction. This is a fun movie to see maybe once or twice with your friends but it has little value aside from that.",1019260800,,676,4.641666666666667
886831,2,630444284X,"As much as I love John Leguizamo, this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen.  Leguizamo fans, rent it, but don't spend your money on the DVD.",1017619200,2,145,4.0
886832,3,630444284X,"Basically, this movie is a modern comical update of the famed short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game"". John Leguizamo stars as a Miami con man called ""The Pest"" (it's the shortened version of a really, really, really long name). The Pest gets in trouble when he finds himself owing the Miami Scottish (that's right, Scottish, kilts and all) mafia $50,000. He is accidentally picked up by the henchman of an exiled Nazi (Jeffery Jones) and offered a ""scholarship"" for $50,000 if he agrees to participate in a little hunt. Little does Pest know that the Nazi has hunted every race of man but one, a Latino, and the Pest is to be his final victim before he returns to Germany as a free man.

The movie moves fast from one location to another: Miami to an exotic private island back to Miami. The jokes are also thrown out fast and furious. Some of the stuff is pretty tame, but a lot of the humor is rather crude.

Overall, the movie doesn't have much plot but is rather a showcase for Leguizamo to show off his variety of talents.",1017014400,,1027,4.457446808510638
886833,5,630444284X,"""The Pest"" is, by far, one of my favorite comedy films.  It's so hilarious that you laugh the whole way through the film.  John Leguizamo is one of the funniest and genius commedians on the planet.  See this movie, and you'll know what I mean...
Pest Vargas (Leguizamo) is the neighboorhood pest (Duh!).  He lives in the suburbs of Lantio Miami, Florida, were his job isn't working or trading...it's conning.  Being a master con-artist, he cons his way through the street of Miami, being anywhere from a Blind-card Tricker, to a Japanesee Business man.  While being constantly hunted by the Scottish Mafia (yes, there is one), Pest comes across a German Business man, who claims to give Pest $50,000 for College spendings, just for doing a few tests and visits.  But what Pest will find out, is that the Test...is to stay alive!  It turns out to be that the man is a Neo-Nazi and a manhunter, whom wants to hunt every enthnic color and post their head on his hunting shelf, like a stuffed animal!  If Pest stays alive for 24 hours, he gets the money.  But if he doesn't, its the shelf.  And so begins Pest's long and Hilarious escape from the Neo-Nazi, along with staying one foot ahead of the Scottish mob, while at the same time, trying to arive in time for dinner at his Girlfriend's house!  Pest's buddies, Chubby (Mad TV's Aries Spears) and Ninja (Freddy Rodrguez) attempt to help Pest, while Pest's Girlfriend (Tammy Townsend) doesn't have a clue whats going on.
""The Pest"" is on of the funniest movies of all time...",1016755200,2,1523,4.620817843866171

Jeffery Jones co-stars as a native of Germany who has succesfully hunted all races of human beings except for one: Latino.
