2258565,5,B0008ENHXA,"The 'student coming out to family' plot has been done before, but rarely with such freshness and depth. Here are some of the reasons this film stands out: 1. The characters, especially the lead character, are more complex and conflicted than in most 'coming out' movies. The protagonist is a realistic and compelling blend of conflicts, strengths and weaknesses, virtues and failings. It makes him more human and memorable than most protagonists. 2. The film devotes a reasonable amount of time to the parents' perspective. This makes the film valuable to a wider audience and gives it greater depth. 3. The acting was very good. 4. There were several unexpected plot twists that kept things interesting and fresh. Much more can be said about this movie, and other reviewers have said it. If you're looking for quality gay-themed movies, this one should be at or near the top of the list.",1120435200,8,888,4.887417218543046
2258566,5,B0008ENHXA,"""Just a question of love"" brings it to the point how a gay relationship between an openly and closeted gay brings up problems. How difficult it is on one hand to be in love with a wonderful man and on the other hand denying this relationship to his parents. It shows also how important it is to accept and help each other and not just being selfish and going either this or the other way but finding a common way of life. Both actors fit well together and showed pure romantic love between to handsome gays. I really recommend this movie to everyone.",1119052800,16,550,4.349514563106796

2258568,5,B0008ENHXA,".......you're there, right there, for every tumultuous and fun-loving moment of it!

(1)  WOW!!......and DOUBLEWOW!!  You've just got to hand it to the French.  In this reviewer's opinion only they, thus far in ""gay filmdom,"" seem to have been truly capturing that ""certain naturalness"" all of us look for in a male couple's touching, kissing and relating to one another.  All of you know what it is; it's a ""something"" which American directors have merely come close to achieving, perhaps in such films** as C. Jay Cox's ""Latter Days"" and Julie Davis's ""All Over the Guy.""  All this leads to a couple of big questions:  Why does it seem, in practically all American gay films, that the act of a kiss most often comes across as ""just a task"" which has to be accomplished (and in front of the camera to boot---isn't that so embarrassing!)  And what about even the simplest passing touch between partners in a scene?  Why would a US actor, in preparing for a gay role, never think of doing something as small but meaningful as that?  Whatever the answer, our actors mostly just don't (and American directors do not seem to take the time to ensure that they do, or even to ""instruct"" them on kissing halfway decently, for that matter).  If our directors are going to spend all that money and effort, why not do it right?  In summing up this lead-in, it has to be again asked:  why is it so natural and easy for the French?  (see, also, that 1997 French title, ""The Man I Love"")(or France's 2000 ""Come Undone"" with its beach-side copulation scene).

(2)  Moving on now, more directly into this film, it's got to be said that these 2 French actors have Chemistry (that's spelled with a capital ""C""......and, well, you just gotta make the ""H"", the ""E"", the ""M"" and all the rest of 'em, capital letters, too).  Plus, as actors, these guys are not afraid to express their feelings by making that extra gesture of a passing touch or hand-on-arm (as noted above, how often we don't see that from American actors).  There's a very striking feeling, projected by this film, that really makes you have to wonder:  if these guys weren't already in love prior to filming, then surely mustn't they have become so during the process.......at least that's the feeling which their performances so vividly project to the audience.  It's what we're left with after watching this film:  THAT WAS REALLY LOVE!  (What greater mark of success could be asked for, or achieved, in setting a gay romance on film?)

(3)  One other important point on their performances:  while the actors portraying Laurent and Cedric can be so explosive in their expressiveness toward each other, they also make themselves such fun to be with (as a viewer you feel as if you're right there, actually sharing their fun, excitement and joy in discovering sex and love with each other).  Make note of these things as you watch, and see if your pulse-rate doesn't go way up on more than one occasion......as well as your ""chuckle-bone"" getting a good workout.  What it all boils down to is simply that seeing and experiencing their strongly expressed feelings for each other is worth a 1000 times the price of admission.

As a little bit of a postscript, this reviewer just has to add:  Rarely has a movie title been more fitting and meaningful than this one's, especially as it is explained and demonstrated in the heartrending denouement which takes place between father and son in the final moments of the film.  ""Really,"" it tells us, ""after everything else has come, been considered, and gone, all that's left and important is......just a question of love!""

SCENES YA GOTTA WATCH FOR:

--Don't miss this couple's first one-on-one in the agricultural lab which is to be their joint workplace:  it's a first-meeting-and-feeling-each-other-out scene in which sparks fly---the tension between them fairly crackles  (watch the eyes; watch the eyes).

--And you should definitely note:  this pair's first post-coital scene is so full of satisfaction and obvious feelings for one another  (what such heterosexual scene of the past could top it?)  that those feelings practically jump off the screen.  It's only topped, moments later, during a scene in which ""Mom"" walks in on the pair, unannounced----it's beyond priceless.

--Even more telling is the ""water-fight"" scene:  you've never seen such fun and joy over being together expressed by a gay couple in any previous movie  (watch the eyes; watch the eyes).  No wonder this scene leads to the one which it does.

**David Moreton's 1998 ""Edge of Seventeen"" set an earlier standard for more realistic love-making",1118102400,49,4614,4.852752880921895
2258569,4,B0008ENHXA,"...that they always seem to make gay films that rise above just about everything Hollywood and the Indies here in the US can make?

Don't get me wrong. There have been some good films released here...Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, Trick, Latter Day, and Saved amoung them, but a lot of them just can't seem to match the sincerity and feeling that Wild Reeds, The Man I Love, Come Undone, and this film (just to name a few) seem to have.

Not that the story is anything new...closeted gay guy falls in love with very out gay guy and is faced with losing him if he doesn't come out to his very homophobic family. This same story has been done many times, on both sides of the Atlantic. It's just that this one is dealt with with no apologies. It is deeply romantic and believeable, and at the end you realize you cared about the characters and what ultimately happens to them.

Laurent is a college student who lives with his best friend, Carole, who everyone thinks is his girlfriend. This suit him fine. It's not that he is ashamed of being gay. A lot of people know...just not his family. It seems his cousin came out a while back and was disowned. He subsequently died alone(though not of AIDS, as his family assumes), and Laurent does not want this to happen to him. By staying in the closet he is sparing himself and his family a lot of pain. All goes well until he meets Cedric, and he is faced between love and telling his family the truth, or losing both Cedric and his family. This is a tough choice to make, and one that is dealt with honestly in this film.

I keep hoping that we here in the States will one day be able to make more than a couple of movies that are not afraid to show gay life as it really is...but in a time when even controversial director Oliver Stone has to tone down the gay content of a film about a historically bisexual Alexander the Great so his DVD will reach an audience, I think we will have to rely on other countries.",1117929600,21,1958,4.29810298102981
2258570,5,B0008ENHXA,"I rented ""Just a Question of Love"" expecting once again to be disappointed by the bad acting, bad production, bad direction  and self-loathing characters hooked on drugs, suicidal and all destined for a life of unhappiness. Instead, what I got was one of the most beautiful and real gay themed love stories i've ever seen. And i've viewed a lot of gay movies, but this is no question one of the best.

The movie stars Cyrille Thouvenin as Laurent, and Stephen Guerin-Tillie as Cedric. Laurent is closeted to his family, while Cedric is out and proud. Cedric lives with his mother. Laurent lives with his close friend, Carole. Laurent's parents are clearly homophobic and cannot imagine two people of the same sex loving each other. While Cedric's mother is the opposite. She is loving mother who is accepting and proud of her son. She only want him to meet someone he can love and be happy.

Laurent's grades are so bad at University that he is assigned to do a field agriculture project to raise his academic standing. He's tutor is Cedric. When the two first meet there is instant attraction, but they do not reveal their feelings believing the other is straight. That is until, one night when Cedric drops Laurent to his part time cleaning job and feelings are revealed. Cedric is lighting Laurent's cigerette, but Laurent holds onto Cedric's hand for just that second too long. He then rushes out the car embarrassed, beliving that Cedric is just a ""nice hetrosexual."" The story unfolds from there. They both fall madly in love, but because Laurent is closeted, major turmoil within the relationship developes. Cedrics refuses to be his secret boyfriend. He want's Laurent to come out of the closet and tell his parents about their relationship. Things get even more complicated when Cedric's mother, unable to take both of them suffering and not wanting to see her son's heart get broken, decides to tell Laurent's mother that her son is gay. Then things really begin to unravel.

This movie is simply stunning. All the actors did a super job. And the two male leads were excellent in depicting the depth of their character. The intimate scenes and chemistry between  Stepan Guerin-Tillie and Cyrille Thouvein was amazing. The scene when they first kiss after desiring each other for weeks without contact is very tastefully done. An extremely beautiful and passionate moment in the film. Bravo to these guys on making their intimate scenes seem so very real. Infact, a big round of applause to all the actors involved in this movie. You can see every effort was made to put in a good performance.

I cannot recomment this French movie enough. Once again the Foreign movie makers come out tops with tackling sensitive subject matter. I'm still waiting for that well made gay american movie.

My order is already in for this one. Highly recommended.",1117411200,13,2853,4.84599589322382
2258571,5,B0008ENHXA,"'Juste une question d'amour' is a small film made for French TV that is one of the most sensitive, unbiased examinations of how the 'coming out' of gay men impacts not only the one who bravely steps forward but also his friends both male and female and his family.  So often films such as this fall under the title 'Queer Cinema' and that is as unfair to the audience as it is to the writer and director of the film.  This film is meant for the general public and should it receive higher profile in publicity, many longstanding prejudices would at least have the chance to be questioned by both gays and straights.

Laurent (Cyrille Thouvenin) lives with his parents Jeanne (Danile Denie) and  Pierre (Idwig Stephane) behind the family Pharmacy.  Laurent is secretly gay though he lives with his best girlfriend Carole (Caroline Veyt) who adores him and wholly accepts his sexuality and is content to serve as a 'front' for Laurent's closeted role with his parents.  He is not doing well studying agriculture, primarily due to the fact the his close cousin Marc died recently and had been disowned by his aunt and uncle when he announced he was gay.  Laurent can only see that he must keep his secret so that his parents (whom he loves deeply) will not be 'injured' by his admitting his sexuality.  His marks in school are so poor that he is instructed to do an internship in field agriculture to raise his academic standing.  His assigned tutor is Cdric (Stphan Gurin-Tilli) who lives an openly gay life with his warmly understanding and loving mother Emma (Eva Darlan) in an idyllic garden setting that also serves as Cdric's agricultural research lab.

Though instantly attracted to each other, Laurent maintains his closeted life until Cdric reveals his affection: the two become happy, passionate lovers. All goes well until Cdric insists that Laurent be in an open relationship, a state that would demand that Laurent inform his parents of his preferences.  Laurent, fearful that his parents would disown him as his cousin was treated, flees and it is only after Cdric's mother Emma, a woman who loves the fact that her son is in a healthy relationship and longs for Laurent to allow his parents to love him for who truly he is, takes it upon herself to confront Laurent's parents with the truth.  The manner in which this initial trauma affects each of the characters forms the platform for the resolution of the story.

This is a brave film, very intelligent and sensitive and informative, and is made all the better by the excellent cast.  Each actor gives characterizations that are completely credible and three-dimensional: none of the too familiar stereotypes are here.  It is to the credit of director Christian Faure and his co-writer Annick Larboulette that JUST A QUESTION OF LOVE succeeds on every level.  This is one of the most quietly powerful stories about same sex challenges to be addressed on the screen.  Highly Recommended for ALL audiences.  In French with English subtitles.

2258572,5,B0008ENHXA,"It has been said by more than a few individuals that there just are not very many films that are being made that could be considered realistic ""gay love stories"".  ""Just a Question of Love"" is the exception. It is a very realistic gay LOVE STORY. Although the film is in French (with, of course, subtitles), the story and/or message can be translated to apply to any country where gay people fall in love and suffer the ramifications thereof.  Laurent a young agricultural student lives in great fear of his parents finding out that he is a gay.  However he has the ""ideal alibi"" because he shares an apartment with his best friend who happens to be a very attractive young women that is comfortable with the knowledge that Laurent is gay (we the audience, however, get the strong feeling she is or has been in love with Laurent and would prefer him straight; nevertheless, she accepts him as he is and enjoys him as a friend).  Outwardly, and especially, to Laurent's parents, Laurent and his roommate are distend to get married and they make the  ""perfect couple"" at least it keeps his parent off his back and he's free to play with the boys.  Inter Cedric-a handsome tutor to Laurent.  The two men fall madly in love with each other. Cedric is very comfortable with his homosexuality and not willing to live a ""lie"".  His mother is also comfortable with her son's homosexuality (or at least accepting because she loves her son).  The closet crumbles in a surprising way (no they are not caught ""doing it!"").  All involved have to face some issues (both hidden and bubbling just below the surface).
All of the actors are very believable in their roles giving wonderful performances.  The film is beautiful to watch with a great soundtrack.

2258574,4,B0008ENHXA,"One could say: another coming-out film, but this one is very enjoyable and well played.
Laurent is a typical closet case. He lives a lie, because he is afraid of losing his parents' love.
Then he meets Cedric (rough, but handsome gay, who is very open about his sexuality). Along with him comes his mother (potrayed by Eva Darlan). And things are getting a bit difficult...

Although my coming-out had happend some time ago, I could easily identify with the main character. The film is good in every aspect. Both actors portraying Laurent and Cedric are likable, there is nothing artificial in the chemistry between them.

Cyrille Thuvenin's performance is excellent--and if he ever reads these reviews, I hope he will know that I for one enjoy his performances--in this and in CONFUSION OF GENDERS.  At any rate, his co-stars are equally great in their performances, and the whole issue at hand--being who you are and accepting yourself--is brought out very well, and with well thought out scenes and performances.  If I ever assumed that France had nothing but liberals in it, this movie alone would put paid to that thesis.  Of course, there is no such thing in any country, but this film showed that people everywhere can be uptight about their children.

2258579,5,B0008ENHXA,I rented this movie not knowing what to expect. When I started to watch and had to read the subtitles as the movie was in French I almost turned it off but so very glad I didn't as I enjoyed this movie as much as any other I have seen. Laurent is a young gay man trying to come to terms with his sexuality and afraid to tell his parents and Cedric who doesn't care what people think takes Laurent under his wings and the two fall in love. Unfortunately things happen and the relationship strains because Cedric gives Laurent a choice of coming out or loosing him. My favorite scene is at the end of the movie where Cedric is driving Laurent to the airport so he could go to Paris and start over but along the way Laurent finally realizes what he is about to give up. A great movie about love and a must see. After returning the rental I came to Amazon and bought it.,1265932800,3,866,4.1301775147929

2258582,4,B0008ENHXA,"A friend recommended this film to me and even though my college French is rusty and the subtitles were annoying sometimes, I did enjoy this movie. Why? The chemistry between the two leads, Cyrille Thouvenin and Stephan Guerin-Tillie who play the lovers, Laurent and Cedric.

While this could have been another ""coming out"" film, the heart-felt portrayal of Laurent (Thouvenin) attempting to please his homophobic parents while having a love affair with another man and trying to keep his two worlds from colliding was moving. In the end, the truth had to be told and I felt this was a realistic journey of one man's step from childhood into adulthood and finally acceptance of himself as a gay man.

Now, I still prefer ""Shelter"" and ""Latter Days"" for their style, pacing and overall likeability as the premiere 'coming out' films of the last ten years, but ""Just A Question of Love"" should also be included on your viewing list too.",1235347200,3,933,4.825
2258583,5,B0008ENHXA,"""Just A Question Of Love"" is such a really good movie. The plot is one that has been done again and again. A young gay man Laurent (Cyrille Thouvenin) is in love with Cedric (Stephan Guerin-Tilie) but cannot tell his parents Jeanne (Daniele Denie) and Pierre (Idwig Sephane) that he is gay in part because a beloved first cousin Marc has just died and who did tell his parents about his sexuality and was not even visited in the hospital while he was dying. Laurent is well aware of how his parents felt about Marc, who was like a brother to him. Add to that the additional conflict between the two lovers because Cedric is open to his mother Emma (Eva Darlan) and keeps urging Laurent to come out to his parents. Of course, Laurent feels he can't right now and hides behind a so-called romantic relationship that his parents buy into of course between him and a very understanding Carole (Caroline Veyt). With a less talented group of actors, this film could have degenerated to a basic gay soap opera. The actors, to a person, are superb. They are not cardboard creations but complex many-sided characters. Emma, for instance, sounds like so many parents when she reminds Laurent that she had difficulty with her only son Cedric's sexuality-- he told her at his father's funeral-- but that she did not want to lose his love so she adjusted.  There are many other wonderful scenes, particularly when Emma tells Laurent's parents that their son is in love with her son. No wonder that Laurent tells her that he wishes she were his mother. I particularly like the scene when Cedric makes a surprise visit to Laurent's father's pharmacy to buy aspirin. Laurent's terror that he is about to be outted is palpable.

""Just A Question Of Love""-- Laurent, after being outted by Emma, tells his father that ""it is not just about being gay or straight, but just a question of love""-- is one of the best films on the subject of being gay that I've seen lately. Highly recommended.",1232236800,2,1970,4.6257142857142854
2258584,2,B0008ENHXA,"After reading such good reviews here, I was seriously disappointed in this movie. It's the weakest of the seven gay romances I've watched recently (even weaker than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Latter-Days/dp/B0002I84JO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Latter Days</a>, which says a lot).

I didn't see any convincing chemistry between the two lead characters, although Stphan Gurin-Tilli is one of those straight French actors who play gay very convincingly. His Cdric is mature, sensible and intensely masculine, with a kind of controlled, smoldering fire that's profoundly attractive. I can see why just about anybody would fall for him.

But Cyrille Thouvenin's Laurent is just a pain in the [...], a spoiled, petulant, completely selfish 20-something baby who sulks and throws tantrums at the drop of a hat and is generally about as unattractive as a grown man can be. I don't believe for a minute that a cool guy like Cdric would look twice at Laurent, much less hang around after the first tantrum. If Laurent were supposed to be in his early teens, his behavior might be a little easier to take, but he's supposed to be close to finishing university, an age when men who throw tantrums are seriously unattractive regardless of sexual orientation. He spouts pretentious poetry and misses his dead cousin--so what? That's no excuse for being such a jerk. He's just a big baby, and he's not even cute.

Another French movie with a spoiled young coming-outer is "" cause d'un garon"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-ll-Get-Over-It/dp/B0002MFG8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You'll Get Over It</a>), in which Julien Baumgartner plays a similarly self-centered seventeen-year-old. But in addition to being a lot younger and better behaved, Baumgartner's character has many other redeeming qualities, including gentleness, a genuinely haunting melancholy, and tons of charm; overall he's a much more complex and interesting person. Laurent, in this movie, has no positive qualities at all that I can see.

There are also big problems with the movie's credibility. Cdric is supposed to be such an eminent research botanist that the French government let him work from home, but his lab looks like a middle-school science project, and you sense that the pseudo-scientific dialog sounds ridiculous even to the actors speaking it. Then when Cdric and Laurent have a cutesy water fight in the lab using random containers of variously-colored liquids, and end up splashing their way to bed through the flooded lab floor, any remaining credibility vanishes.

Another particularly incredible development is when Laurent's parents don't even recognize Cdric when he comes to visit them, just a few weeks after an ominous surprise visit to the family pharmacy that traumatized Laurent, took place with his mother watching curiously, and ignited yet another tantrum when Laurent got back to the lab. Maybe Mom's thick glasses are supposed to be the excuse, but they don't seem much of a handicap in other scenes.

Most of the supporting characters aren't much better than Laurent is. They're one-dimensional and cartoonish, played by not very good actors. Laurent's parents and ""girlfriend"" are nearly as obnoxious and shallow as Laurent is, so maybe it just runs in the family.

The only supporting character who's interesting at all is Cdric's mother Emma, played beautifully by Eva Darlan. When she alone has the good sense to cut through the drama-queen crap and tell the truth, her reward is Laurent's biggest tantrum ever and his insistence at the end of the movie that she go into therapy. I think that demand is supposed to be cute, but for me it was just the nail that sealed the coffin on this unpalatable mess of a movie. I'd give it one star, but I'm saving that for a really awful movie, which--thanks only to Gurin-Tilli and Darlan--this one barely misses being.",1230508800,4,3945,5.3841166936790925

And when the end credits were rolling, I felt thoroughly satisfied and highly amused.

This thoughtful and well-acted film presented many sides to the subject of coming out to your parents, especially when you know for a fact that they will not react well.  As others have noted, all of the characters were multi-dimensional, and there was not a bad performance among the whole cast.  The conflicts were lifelike and the writer presented a multitude of opinions, all of which made me think I was viewing real people instead of a film.  See it with someone special.

2258588,5,B0008ENHXA,"This humane, intelligent French drama was made by, and appeared in prime time on, France 2.  It inspired thousands of letters praising its most deserving young stars and their story.  Try to imagine such a positive, thought-provoking drama on - much less made by - American broadcast television which is simply about an impassioned gay relationship (and no one gets sick or dies!).

Cyrille Thouvenin (Confusion of Genders) stars as angry, deeply-closeted Laurent.  He is unwilling to come out to his parents because they are so virulently homophobic, and Laurent can't bear the thought of losing them.  He lives with his best friend Carole who goes along with the fiction that she is his girlfriend for their benefit.

Everything changes when Laurent meets Cedric (sexy Stephan Guerin-Tillie), but they're both a bit cranky and get off to a noisy, antagonistic start.  Thinking better of it, sparks soon fly and they revel in an exuberant, spirited fling.  The delight the two beautiful actors project is authentic and gratifying.

The problem is that Cedric is quite aboveboard about his sexuality and pressures (bullies?) the younger man into coming out. Laurent is truculent, uncommunicative, and defiant.  Carole is tired of the charade and has a love of her own to nurture.  Everyone wants Laurent out, but he is immobilized.  When Cedric's mother impulsively reveals the boys' secret, their world comes apart.  How everyone deals with the fallout is the core of the narrative.

This transcends being just another 'gay' film.  It is about learning how to love for all concerned:  gay, straight, old or young.  As for Laurent and Cedric, rarely on film has ""I love you"" been uttered with more poignancy.",1206576000,4,1708,5.064516129032258

It was something about how the story was told, the sex, the facial expressions,the story line, the characters, the realness of it all. A lot was said during the movie, but it was during those times when nothing was said that made the movie stand out. The body language spoke where words couldn't. The hard hitting and bluntness of the movie made it stand out where others have failed. As one of the lines go ""So much unhappiness for such little reason"" or something like that. It was so true.

2258592,5,B0008ENHXA,"What a wonderful little film--an ""older"" version of ""Beautiful Thing."" Juste une question d'amour is a well written, well acted story of coming out and first time love that manages to avoid the clichs that unfortunately riddle other movies like it.

Laurent is a college student who, thanks to his aunt and uncle throwing his gay cousin out of the family and then abandoning him when he dies, is struggling to keep his homosexuality a secret from his family and struggling to keep his life from falling apart. He's given an internship when he screws up, yet again, but ends up finding companionship and love with an openly gay researcher named Cedric. Their affair is passionate, playful and fully exposed to Cedric's mother. Even Laurent's seemingly clueless mother notices his ""radiance"" when he comes home for a quick visit. However, Laurent's refusal to talk with his parents about Cedric's true place in his life, even bringing his roommate Carole to the family home to add to the ruse, causes an ultimatum and a major, well-intentioned interference from Cedric's mother.

Although this is a French film, there are no explicit sex scenes or nudity and, unlike many French films I've seen, doesn't use endless exposition to mask a weak storyline. The supporting players are exceptional and believable as parents who have chosen or must choose. Their reactions are natural, especially when confronted with a deep deception. The best part of the movie are the leads, who are natural, good-looking actors who have fantastic chemistry. This is a gem of a movie that will surely please all the romantics out there. This is one of the better gay films I've seen; I highly recommend it.",1171065600,9,1683,4.943462897526501

I wish I could watch it with my parents, but they don't speak neither English nor French, and probably not even my ""language"". Watch it with your friends and learn from a beautiful story.

2258595,5,B0008ENHXA,"""Juste une question d'amour"" both opens and closes with a dizzying shot of whirling trees seen through the joyful, playful eyes of Laurent, the main character. The first scene is simulated joy, the last the real thing. In between we have a gem of a film about love, both familial and romantic, honesty, and the product of their fusion: joy.

Laurent is a closeted undergraduate living in a provincial French town. When he falls in love, he is forced to confront the conflict between his sexuality and the expectations of his socially conservative family. This by now is a well-used plot. But Laurent is given sufficient back story, and there are enough unexpected wrinkles in the resolution to keep the film from being preachy or repetitive.

Christian Faure made this film for French television, as he did another outstanding film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Un-amour--taire/dp/B000IJ7A6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Un amour  taire""</a>&nbsp;(2006). Such is the difference between European and North American standards, that both of these TV films far surpass most of what comes out of the American film factories for cinematic release. The acting in ""Juste une question d'amour"" is excellent, as are the score and the cinematography. Everyone I've talked to about this film has remarked how refreshing it is to see 'real' people on the screen -- with somewhat crooked teeth and slightly blemished skin, for example. All that I could see to mark this as a television film is its brevity (88 minutes) and some resulting plot compression visible in a too-frequent reliance on well-timed telephone calls to move the story along.

With a well-written script and actors of such ability, Faure believably creates the tensions that are familiar to many gays and lesbians and their families. But you don't need to be gay or lesbian to enjoy this film. Love and honesty have universal appeal, and everyone should be able to rejoice as they make the world in this film spin round.",1152230400,17,2020,5.303125

The sensitive story of a young gay man struggling with living in the closet to his homophobic parents is not only realistic from his point of view but from the parent's view as well.

One the surface, Cedric's mother appears to be the great parent who accepts her son's homosexuality.  However, I saw something else.  I saw very little acceptance and alot of fear and loneliness.  Cedric's father passed away and Cedric's mom will do anything to keep her son close by--even paying lip service to the concept that she is open and accepting of this sexuality.

I think Laurent's father's reaction towards the end is much more believeable.  Laurent, with his hand on his father's shoulder, gets the response ""I need more time"".  He doesn't need more time to fake some acceptance...he needs more time for real acceptance.

An intelligent, very well-acted gay-themed drama that pulls no emotional punches, JUSTE UNE QUESTION D'AMOUR is not to be missed. Unlike so many others in this subgenre, this film achieves (through writing and acting) something rare: it generates real emotions from characters who are actually believeable. The two leads are both very attractive, but more in a 'cute guy next door' way, rather than the typically buffed model-types we see in so many other gay films. They look, and act, like real people. And because they are above-average actors, they convince the viewer of what they are going through. The main plot is a simple one: one man, Laurent, is not out to his family and fears his parents' wrath (based on the way his gay cousin was treated by his own family). He is also full of torment about his sexual preference. The other man, Cdric, is out to his mother and very secure in his sexuality. The plot follows conventional lines, with a few good surprises. It's so well-directed and played with such truth that it works perfectly. This is not a gay film full of hot sex scenes, put there for their own sake. We see only one or two moments of heated sensuality. The main focus is on watching a real relationship begin, and lead toward love. Actors Cyrille Thouvenin and Stphan Gurin-Tilli will be hard to forget. And the actress playing Cdric's mother, Eva Darlan, is also a standout.",1125964800,11,1588,4.7328519855595665
2258617,5,B0008ENHXA,"As much as I loved this film (for all the reasons mentioned by others--the initial kissing scene in particular), something that I noticed about the story that I haven't seen commented on is the following: I didn't view Cedric as being particularly ""out and proud"" as most reviewers seem to.

He is out to his mother, but the circumstances under which he came out to her were pretty unique. He essentially demanded, ""I like guys. Accept me as I am or you won't get to have me in your life."" He apparently has no siblings or extended family, and apparently no close friends. He has chosen to live a fairly solitary life due to wanting to keep his father's nursery business going and at the same time conduct his own academic research. Pretty easy to be out when there's no one to be out to.

Along comes Laurent, who has a close-knit family (although rabidly homophobic on his mother's side), and who has learned in the most harsh way possible the risk of coming out to these people. And what does Cedric do, even when he is exposed to this family and knows the history, but impose his own conditions under which he will continue to have a relationship with Laurent--essentially, ""I won't have a relationship with someone who is ashamed of who he is!"" It isn't until he realizes that maintaining this stance will cost him his relationship with Laurent and that the cost is too high, that he relents.

So, I think this part of the story tells a lesson about unconditional love as much as anything that happens between Laurent and his family.",1123545600,16,1538,4.565217391304348

For instance, instead of being gay, it could be difference of religions or other beliefs. And the best line in the movie i believe is when Laurent says, ""It's not a question of gay or straight. Its a question of love."" I strongly reccomend this movie. At this moment the wait for it is and additional 7-11 days (i think) and it is worth it.
