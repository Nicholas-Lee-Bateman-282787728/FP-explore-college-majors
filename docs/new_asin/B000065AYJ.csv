8190767,5,B000065AYJ,"We have here the first four episodes of Matsumoto's Cosmo Warrior Zero. Another great series dealing with loss, manhood, and fighting the good fight. The animation is crisp and the English dubbing is top-notch. The opening and closing credits are superb. If your a big fan of L. Matsumoto this dvd is a must. Same goes for fans of space opera, sci-fi, and meaningful/ serious animes. Enjoy!",1029456000,5,390,4.835820895522388
