8109395,2,B000EGDAV6,"Corey Large (Chasing Ghosts) stars as Ethan Humphries a complete dip who is coming back to his hometown to be a part of his best friend Jeff's wedding. Who is Jeff marrying? Well that is none other then Ethan's old high school girlfriend Stephanie played by the beautiful Jennifer O'Dell (The Lost World). This enrages Ethan and he doesnt like it one bit. He doesnt want Stephanie to marry Jeff because well, deep down inside he is still madly in love with her. But is she in love with him? Will she choose Jeff over Ethan? Well, that's for you to decide if you watch it. Large co-wrote the script which could of been a hell of a lot better then what it came out to be. Comedy has its moments but the dialouge isn't the best. Large should take acting lessons. I don't know if he has but he needs help. His performance is down right annoying and you just wanna punch this guy for some reason. Also starring Tom Lenk (Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Luke Flynn (The Brooke Ellison Story), Luke Kirby (Halloween: Resurrection), Melissa Schuman (The Hollow), Paul Johannson (Highlander: The Raven), James Duval (Nowhere), Carly Pope (Two For The Money), John Cassini (Cool Money), Ron Jeremy (Porn N' Chicken) and Alexandra Holden (The Hot Chick).",1150934400,4,1238,4.657534246575342
8109396,2,B000EGDAV6,"The actual window theory, the ""theory"" postulated by the lead character that gives the film its title, is rubbish, and shows the lead character for what he is: a shallow, misguided waste of space. This ""theory"" has to do with the window of opportunity a guy has for getting a girl when they're ""commitment-ready"". Never mind that the lead character isn't commitment-ready, and isn't likely to be in the next decade or two.

I had a question about him returning to his hometown, but if the answer was given, I didn't hear it. I certainly didn't read it in the captioning or the subtitles, because there weren't any. There are strict laws about captioning for cable and television providers, but none that I'm aware of for producers of DVDs or videos. Quite frustrating if you're hearing impaired.

Ranting aside, here's my question: he's coming home to see his old friends, but where are his parents? Other parents are around and spoken of (if not seen). It's a bit odd.

The only redeeming quality, for me at least, was Tom Lenk. He was crazy funny in Buffy, and in this film his lines were well written for his character. Almost everything he does is funny.

Other than that, not much made sense. A guy is mad because one of his best friends is getting married and didn't tell him. They mad guy lives in L.A. in a decent apartment, but doesn't do anything. Yet he's able to scrounge up money and hop on a plane home ASAP. His friend is marrying his ex-girlfriend from high school. Maybe it's just me...but so what? The guy's 25, they broke up in high school (he broke up with her), PLUS he moved to LA and hasn't spoken to her since he left. Does that make any sense? Not to me.

The movie makes some feeble attempts at character development and resolution, and that's what saves it from the dreaded ""1 star"". Some of the attempts were half decent. Some were dreadful.

Again, if you like Tom Lenk (sadly, most people reading this, if there are any, don't know who Tom Henk is), watch it. He's funny. It's the only reason I rented it, and in that sense, I'm glad I watched it.",1150070400,4,2077,4.481481481481482
8109397,3,B000EGDAV6,"I watched this DVD with very low expectations, realizing before viewing it that it was a low budjet movie. The story is that of a twentyfive year old guy, that has moved away from his home town to LA. He returns home as he find out from his friends that one of his best mates is getting married. However there is a snag: his best friend is getting married to his ex-girlfriend from high school. From here a story develops that is part comedy, part reflection on growing up, friendship, love and the nostalgia that is always shared with people we have been close to in our younger years.

This is not a masterpiece, but I really enjoyed watching these carachters at work...Almost every single character reminded me of someone I knew in real life. The friendship interactions feel quite realistic and I got more and more involved as the movie progressed, after a lukewarm start. A good movie for an otherwise boring evening with nothing to do.",1149984000,3,941,4.601190476190476
