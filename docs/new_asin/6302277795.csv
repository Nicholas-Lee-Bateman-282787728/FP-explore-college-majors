7823829,4,6302277795,"Adapted from the novel by Alan Paton, this 1951 film is set in South Africa and is a sad commentary about apartheid. It stars Canada Lee as a native aging Christian priest, who travels to Johannesburg in search of his sister and his son. He finds that his sister is a prostitute and his son is missing. After a long search with the help of his fellow priest, played by Sidney Poitier, they discover that his son is involved in a murder of a white man. Charles Carson plays the father of the murdered man, a bigot who changes his views as he reads some of his own son's writings about the inhumanity of apartheid. There is a major scene when he and murderer's father, both grieving, come face to face.
Sidney Poitier is listed as a star but his role was actually quite small. He became star years later but his name on a video box does bring instant recognition. The theme is a good one and so is the story and the acting is superb. I did enjoy it but found it a bit slow and hard to follow. Perhaps it was the editing or just the way the film was transferred to video but it distracted from the high drama. It is worthwhile seeing, of course, and it was done well, but it just didn't grab me enough to give it my highest recommendation.",1001462400,15,1236,4.219409282700422
