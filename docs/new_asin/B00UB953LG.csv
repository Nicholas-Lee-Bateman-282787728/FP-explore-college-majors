8705202,4,B00UB953LG,"Amanda showed the basic moves slowly first (shimmy, hips accents, torso movements, figure 8...) and then combined the shimmy with this moves. The key move is the knee shimmy which is then added to the other moves and also while walking. I wished she would have used more music. There were long sections with just explanation and drills but no music. And I missed a performance, some kind of colour to spice all up.",1442793600,,414,4.608108108108108
8705203,5,B00UB953LG,Amanda is an accomplished Dancer and Instructor. I love this DVD. The shimmy drill is the best. You can't go wrong with this DVD. She explains moves well and then drills them.  No performance at the end but packed with instruction and then drilling the moves by putting them into short choreographies.,1431993600,5,301,4.788461538461538
