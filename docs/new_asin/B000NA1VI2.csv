2762006,5,B000NA1VI2,"David Chase wrote the Sopranos to be a show about a mob boss who is having problems with his real family not his mob family. The focus and consistent plot has always been about his real family, with the mob family being the background. A lot of fans took it the other way, that it was a show about a mob guy and his real life family. His original idea was for a mob guy who's mom was trying to have him killed for putting her in a nursing home. That's what the show has been about all along, watching a flawed protagonist muddle through his personal and professional life. David Chase wasn't trying to write characters we would like who would do things we would agree with. The series ended like it began; a mob guy and his wife and kids.",1186444800,4,738,4.204225352112676
2762007,5,B000NA1VI2,"Even though the theme of the last nine episodes was sadness, boredom, and unfulfillment, I felt none of these things after the final credits rolled.  The last nine episodes of the Sopranos are monuments to the superlative abilities of everyone involved in this groundbreaking series.  The writing and acting have never been better.  When Robert Iler as AJ finally puts together a good performance, you know the series is running at a high pace.

For myself, the Sopranos has always been about moments that you're thinking about long after the episode ends.  I've never gotten chills watching the Sopranos until the final episodes, and this season was full of chill-inducing moments.  Carm asking ""Is this it?"" in the opening scene.  Paulie's Big Pussy dream.  The huge fight Tony and Carm have over her housing profits.  Chris stumbling into his house and then his heartbreaking confession in ""Kennedy and Heidi.""  Tony and the Nevada desert.  Tony saving AJ from himself.  Bobby talking about his son while buying a toy train.  Too many heartfelt looks and hilarious lines to remember.

And of course, the final episode.  To those that always complain about the open-endedness with which the Sopranos is written, the final episode did a lot of bow-tying.  Every character was shown, and given some closure.  As for the final scene, who knows what happened?  Tony existed in the story before we started watching and he and his family will exist after the series ends.  Maybe Tony died in that diner.  Maybe his whole family died with him.  Maybe Tony died twenty years later of a heart attack after eating too many greasy onion rings.  That pop culture moment attained its immortality by allowing every viewer to have their own ideas.  I'd imagine the Sopranos fans that hated it were hoping the Members Only Jacket man was paid to kill Tony by the vengeful triumvarate of Furio, Ade, and the Russian, but that's just absurd.  The final season is about so much more than the last minutes anyways, so enjoy it for the other 8 hours and fifty-five minutes.

Lastly, I've got to mention the music.  Bobby hugging his daughter at the end of the first episode to ""This Magic Moment.""  ""Evidently Chickentown"" playing over the baptism of Chris's daughter.  ""The Valley"" by Los Lobos playing at the end of the fifth episode.  Journey having the honor of backing the final scene.  All perfect mood-setting choices by writers at the top of their game.  If the Sopranos doesn't sweep the Emmys, it'll be one of the greatest crimes in TV history.",1186272000,8,2535,4.839160839160839
2762008,4,B000NA1VI2,"I am a HUGE Sopranos fan. I have all the seasons except this one...While I did like this season, it was kinda disappointing to me. I have heard all the arguments about the end or whatever, but I just thought the whole thing was too rushed. They tried to throw too many new people and things at you. If anything, I would have wanted them to make two more seasons.
This season was very dark and depressing, but it was good. Bittersweet.
 The end was just that, THE END. You can choose anyway you want to decide what happens to the fam.",1186012800,4,533,4.2254901960784315
2762009,3,B000NA1VI2,"i sort of agree with the 1 star guy. we kept watching thinking it's going to get better . there'r in a slump. its hard to keep up with the great stories they've givin us in the past. i would have settled on them(chase and co.)taking another year or two to get it right. but for the time they made us wait (almost two years a piece for the last three seasons.)and not get  it back on track.  but they didn't.unexceptable! they should at least not  charge as much for the inferior seaons. anything over 35$ is absurd. the way i would have changed or fixed the show would be TO HAVE TONY , UNCLE JUNE,MEADOW, AND PAULY ...(fade to black. __________________ Directed by David Chase..................................................",1185926400,6,727,4.753968253968254
2762010,5,B000NA1VI2,"This season was filled with some of the darkest hours these characters have ever faced and from the openning episode you could tell that things were coming to an end.  I can't wait to complete my collection to what is probably the greatest television show of all time with Tony Soprano being the reason to watch tv.  This is one of the first ever shows I got into enough to buy on DVD and the final 9 finished up with probably the best stretch of episodes to end a season ever.  Starting with ""Walk Like A Man"",""Kennedy And Heidi"",""The Second Coming"", ""Blue Comet"" and the finale ""Made In America"" all simply amazing I don't think there will be a show like this for a long time R.I.P. The Sopranos but at least it lives on in the DVD's.  The cast of this show is like an all star team of actors James Gandolfini,Edie Falco, Loraine Braco, Michael Imperioli the list goes on hope they all win there deserved Emmy's once again.",1185753600,28,925,4.391812865497076
2762011,5,B000NA1VI2,"If you've read the five star reviews above and below me, you can see they were put together by thoughtful, analytical ,and critical thinkers. I would just like to say that if we are expected to take the only person who claimed the show was pathetic seriously, he should learn proper grammar. Before criticizing on how the show is thrown together, think about how your review is thrown together. It shows that idiots who don't understand the show gave it a low rating. Thus, if you consider yourself an intelligent person who is capable of critical thinking then get this show. It is a definite must.",1185408000,5,599,4.660377358490566
2762012,5,B000NA1VI2,"I think that this was a very good season; David did a good job of closing the whole thing up. I can't wait to get my own copy...so I can watch it over and over again...hahaha...

The scene between Junior and Tony on the last episode was amazing...I think that in all actuality that this was the final scene that ended the Sopranos...

If you are a fan...pick this up when it comes out!",1182124800,7,385,4.1891891891891895
2762013,5,B000NA1VI2,"The Sopranos season 6 part 2 was a return to form.  I think Episode 86 ""Made in America"" the finale was perfect.  David Chase didn't give viewers that closure that they wanted, but life doesn't come with a nice bow at the end of the day, and the series kept it real.  It also had alot of the comedy that season 1 had.
The end of the series finale when Tony first walks into the restaurant then sees himself sitting down, is it a dream?  Are some of the people in the restaurant notorious or related characters from ealier episodes and seasons?  Earlier in the Sopranos there was talk of how a killing happens, you don't hear it, you don't see it, just bang and the lights go out, like how the last moments ended, did Tony Die?  Who knows, but people on every talk show, on every sports show on espn, on blogs, everywhere are discussing it, analyzing it, and debating it, isn't that what great movies do for us?  If mobsters walked in and shot tony and there was a huge shoot out, what is there to comment on, ""whoa did you see him get shot""?, damn.  The end.  David Chase is smarter, and as i said the end was so suspenseful it was Hitchcockian.  Hitchcock once said it's not the explosion of the bomb that goes off.  That'll make you jump for one second, it's the knowing a bomb is under the table and it could go off, the waiting, and anticipation and it doesn't that was the last 5 minutes and i'd think everyone would agree even the dissapointed people that it was very intense.  Great movies make us feel something whether it is good or bad, a great movie can change us or our mood.
I've loved watching the Sopranos over the years it's more than just a violent show, it's almost always fresh and current and dealing with alot of the same issues we all deal with in our lives.  I'm jealous of anyone who has never seen this series and is about to for the first time.
The finale, basically life goes on and it will, we just won't be a part of it anymore.  However we can pop season 1 back in the dvd player anytime and experience it all over again.
Maybe they'll make a movie of it, and David chase will write it, Coppolla will produce it, and Scorsese will direct it.

2762072,4,B000NA1VI2,"My only qualm with the last season of the Sopranos is how in the hell did Tony, after getting shot, having an open sepsis wound, almost dying and being fed through a tube, leave the hospital looking 50 pounds heavier than when he went in?  Was that capicola (gabagool) in the feeding tube all of that time?  I was pissed at James Gandolfini (RIP) for not being professional enough during the break between the 2 Season Sixes (What's up with that?  A year apart should make it Season 7, right?)  to lose weight for the sake of the show rather than look like a pig coming out of the hospital.  Other than that, I thought the ending was just great and it set the show up for a possible sequel or a film.  That was squelched when Gandolfini died.  I am now hoping for a spinoff with Meadow, 20 years later, in charge of the Soprano family with AJ at her side and Carmela the matriarch and adviser.  Maybe in the year 2020, eh?",1464307200,,922,4.258620689655173

2762173,5,B000NA1VI2,"Contains Spoilers.  Good Final Season.  I've read where some have said that this season looked as if the writers were running out of ideas and story lines.  I am not sure that is true.  This season holds up well with all that has gone before.  It does have a little bit of a desultory feel, perhaps as it is tying up a lot of character arcs, such as that of Johnny Sack, that of Junior Soprano, and also that of Anthony Jr., Tony's son.  Obviously, the wheels of drama have to slow a little on these arcs, but they do so only a little.  Otherwise, there are some awesome moments, such as the death of Christopher, which to me was the hardest one in the series to really absorb: how could Tony stoop so low?  And yet, it is in character for him.  His trip to Vegas afterwards puts much of it in context for him: how he processes his emotions.  In Vegas, he buries his guilt and feelings under good sex, psychotropic drugs and a perhaps false epiphany under the aegis of both.  Tony trundles on.  He's built that way.  He's spent years now murdering anyone who stood in his way or threatened his world, including many of his own crime family, even kith and kin.  All he's kept sacred, really, is his own immediate family...as long as you don't count his cheating on Carmela and his threats against his son.  The season builds to a climatic confrontation with the New York family, headed by Phil Leotardo, who was never appeased over the death of hs brother Billy, and has a grudge against Tony over it.  The ending of the series, in my view, is perfect, and perfectly ambiguous.  When and where Tony trundles off this Earth was and is not the point.  The point is what condition is his soul when he does leave.  Tony still demonstrates some capacity for love, and is perhaps not beyond the possibility of redemption.",1431216000,,1814,4.409638554216867

2762372,5,B000NA1VI2,"Time to Say so long to a certain cable company's saga of an Italian-American Family neck deep in a certain subculture. It's Season 6- the remaining 9 eps of The final 21. As we reach this TV milestone let's review what we've learned from the Sopranos:  the Family comes first, never break a soldier's oath, beware of Cousins from Italy, a little therapy never hurts (just don't deface your therapist's magazines), the Don't-ask-Don't tell policy works best for mob wives and goomars, you don't have to eat every dish of Rigatoni, e.g. don't sleep with the Boss' ex-mistress, 'Made men' shouldn't play competitive Monopoly and absolutely do not be a Rat!

An amazing final season for one of TV's all-time finest! The Saga of Jersey crime fam comes to a close as  Anthony Jr. loses his lady and goes to a dark place as a result. Chris continues his Hollywood pursuits as Cleaver is final released ...""F' Ben Kingsley. Danny Baldwin took 'em to F'n actin'school.""
Uncle Junior has been committed, begins running a game there and has other troubles fitting in at 'the home.' Phil Leotardo, now running Brooklyn in Johnny's stead, continues to break balls & press Tony's buttons but still has time to talk to Vito Junior leading to Tony doing some counseling of his own. Tony must deal with his lack of remorse over his part in the death of another friend. All this and the Feds are hot to nail Tony's gang, but not as hot as the Brooklyn gang. It's all come down to this, measures are taken... mistakes are made... a blood bath ensues.. Seriously.

There are no weak stories this season. Mid-season opener ""Soprano Home Movies"" was excellent.  ""Stage 5"" is  Johnny Sack heavy but good, This season Anthony Jr Blanca/collage/therapy arc is over heavy but it's mercifully Meadow light (and then she's only cheering A.J. up, but at least it's not moaning about Finn). ""Remember When"" are ""Walk like a man"" are solid. ""Kennedy & Heidi"" is a terrific ep when the asbestos hits the fan and Tony goes on a Vegas vision quest. In ""Second Coming"" there's more than one scene that will make even tough guys cringe, but the Sopranos never shies from showing the violence. ""Blue Comet"" has some of the most stylistic executions of the entire series.  In spite of all internet debate on the subject ""Made in America"" is an ok closer for the series run.

The throwaway line at the Cleaver Film premiere: ""The Sacred & the Propane"" ... Exemplifies the series itself high crime drama opposite the darkly funny. As my 15th anniversary re-screening comes to a close I gotta say the series, as a whole, has aged well like a fine italian wine... It means what it means.",1404259200,,2645,4.673118279569892

2762489,3,B000NA1VI2,"My wife and I loved this series, or at least loved most of it. As with all fictional works devoted to organized crime, the most engaging aspect for me is The Business and the attendant adherence to The Code. That goes for these last episodes of the run. I frankly could never get interested in Tony's own immediate family, as opposed to his Familly -- Meadow seemed just a typical rebellious yet ultimately devoted daughter transposed to the  realm of the Mob, while A.J. was an annoying little lump. Carmela was a bit more intriguing as the wife quietly humiliated by Tony's philandering but ultimately staying for the perks that are too much to resist. The final season frittered much of its time away by concentrating on Anthony Jr.'s search for love and meaning in his life, and in a way the Business aspect was treated in a more perfunctory manner, almost as if to take care of loose ends and little more. As for the overly praised finale, no me it's nothing but an unimaginative cop-out, a tacit admission by David Chase that he couldn't pull any real closure out of his nether regions. I wasn't outraged by it, but at the same time I was hardly impressed. Still, looking back beyond this faltering end at the entire Sopranos run, you can see stretches of some of the best drama ever seen on any screen, large or small. Some detours and diversions kept it from perfection, but it's almost as close as anyone had ever gotten before.",1352937600,,1437,4.569767441860465

New York doesn't respect them; calling them a glorified crew. Being that it's a New Jersey mob family, the ""F"" word is used as a noun, adjective, verb, adverb and finally as a curse word. It has Adult Content, Adult Language, Violence and Nudity. One of the favorite places for the New Jersey mob guys to meet is at a strip club called The Bing. So there is nudity in just about every episode. It is very well written and directed and the actors make you believe you are getting a glimpse inside an actual mob family. But be aware that about half the dialogue is a curse word. And most of the men have a ""Gumar"" which is a girlfriend on the side that their wives may or may not know about.

The final season did nothing to let this viewer down (well, they played JOURNEY in the scene and added insult to injury by playing this heinous group way too loud... maybe they are from New Jersey? HORRIBLE.. at least they had the affect of making me want the show to be over and DONE).

Aside from one notable Soprano crew member getting whacked, the final season did not disappoint me in the least. It stuck to its 'day in the life' formula and integrated very normal plots with normal / non-surprising finales. No twists.

Unfortunately, you can't help but like Tony and his family (well, AJ could die). And any Soprano follower could have watched this show continue for the next .. well, 'til they are dead. And there is no reason they couldn't keep the show going if slowly filtered in new characters to ... yes... replace the current ones. Hey, that's the stoy of the mob so go with it.

So yes, it is sad to see a great show go, but it's not a sad conclusion (someone should get whacked for putting that horrid Journey song in the final scene).

The only reason this gets a 4 vs. a 5 is because season 5 was clearly a ""5"" and there were episodes in seasons 1-3 that were pure works of art (see ""Isabella"", season 1). Oh yeah and Journey.. maybe I should make this one a ""3"".",1241136000,,1309,4.308943089430894

2762537,5,B000NA1VI2,"The final season of The Sopranos is a satisfying end to a fantastic television series that has captured my interest for nearly a decade. This show was the reason I subscribed to HBO and Sunday nights at 9 pm were a sacred hour when this show was on. While I am well aware of the criticism that the series finale drew for its abrupt end; it certainly is not a bad episode and it is much better after a second viewing. The season as a whole contained many gripping story arcs and once again the writing is top notch. Over the years I have developed a liking towards many of the characters; therefore, it was sad for me to see this show conclude and see the demise of many characters I have grown to like. I equate the first half of the show as a farewell tour that sets up the plot for the riveting second half which crosses the Rubicon in terms of war between the two families. The last five episodes of this show are among the best in the series' history but the true gem of the bunch is the penultimate episode The Blue Comet. I equate that episode to DEFCOM 1 as an absolute state of emergency ensues for the Soprano crime family. I was on the edge of my seat during much of that episode due to the fact that I didn't know what would happen next. I recommend purchasing this series on DVD simply it has a lot of replay value. I have watched this show countless times in comparison to just about everything else in my DVD library. I have found that re-watching this season on DVD to be more enjoyable to watching it when it aired in the spring of 2007. This is due to the fact that I can pick up on elements that I overlooked the first time I watched it. All of this said, I probably don't even have to recommend purchasing this season because chances are if you are a true fan of the show you probably own the previous seasons of the show and will buy this one anyway. Owning this show on DVD is much better than watching the abridged edition which airs on A&E. Watching the syndicated version is about as satisfying as drinking a can of Natty Light with a fine meal. Without sounding like a hired gun for HBO the only other shows that can hold a candle to the great writing on this show are The Wire, Six Feet Under, and The Shield which is on FX. I also recommend those three shows but The Wire certainly can hold its own and even best the Sopranos in some ways. Even though I am a big fan of The Wire, I enjoy the character development of The Sopranos more so and it is essential to view this season to see how things end for Tony Soprano and other characters we have grown to either love or hate.

Season 6 Part 2 Grade: A - (92%)
DVD special features: B - (82%) Although the main menu has a slick interface.",1222560000,,2714,4.159695817490494
2762538,5,B000NA1VI2,"The first TV series since Seinfeld and Married With Children that I waited for. Checked the schedule. And waited for. Didn't see it originally on HBO, so I waited for my local cable to schedule it. Watched every episode until about the last 9 and then...bada bing....nothing. I chased it around the remote [formerly known as the ""dial""] for weeks. Ok. Ok.
Not in the least bit disappointed. I think those final shows were among the best.
I think of The Sopranos as a combination Soap Opera/Crime Series. To my knowledge, that was never even done in the movies.
I'va had reservations about what I surmise [based upon 621 viewings of ""Goodfellas""] to be flaws in writing and concept: (1) Why would a ""Boss"" (a 5 o'clock News celebrity) drive up in his own car, looking exactly like himself, using his real name, to a Pschologist's office where he's expected to pour his guts out? (2) Why would he openly display the discord in his own home, to his ""Crew""? Why would he even *think* Divorce in his world? (3) Why would his Daughter be allowed to roam unprotected through a rough section of town in her Social Worker Intern role? (4) How would ""Cleaver"" have even gotten past the conference stage? Also, I don't understand all the footage inside toilets; other bits of business which make the viewer want to look away.
Not all of the above criticisms are really reflected in the final nine, though.
The DVD quality is awesome. And if I say it's awesome, considering my ancient entertainment system, it's gotta be. The viewer obviously has the chance with this boxed-set to watch the show muninterrupted by the commercials (more violent than the show), and so it takes on a more *movie* feel.
Each Disc has one running commentary, with a total of five voices. The voice of ""Uncle Junior"" is the most impressive. A very insightful, and moving dialogue. He's not particulary emotive, but his calm and cool technique only enhances the detail.
I was disappointed that Lorraine Bracco did not have a Commentary. (Gotta check the other packages). ""Dr. Melfi"", like ""Junior"", is a very soft-spoken character, an interesting counterpoint to the often explosive behavior of the other principals.
I'm not comfortable with how the Dr. and The Boss ended. Ultimately, she was to blame for not doing better research on a situation that could only work against her...and society. She basically slams the door on Tony...he replaces the torn out recipe page from the magazine in the waiting room...and leaves.
Not to be overcritical of this amazing series, but I wish that a small romance would have developped with them. Although, on a deeper level, it was a ""telepathic"" romance. She expressed to *her* Advisor that, yes, in the beginning, she was taken by Tony's masculinity. The fan can decide if that feeling grew even sronger.
Features include the above-mentioned Commentaries, plus a ""mock"" Documentary on the making of ""Cleaver"", and the making of the music soundtrack to the show (David Gray's comments about the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Elvis Costello are brilliant and can make their fans swell with pride).",1220227200,,3103,4.8676748582230625

2762541,5,B000NA1VI2,"Watching the Sopranos season 6 part two was bitter-sweet.  It was nice to get to a conclusion, but it was sad to see the show end.

I know many people were disappointed with the ending, but you know, I liked it.  I thought it served a purpose in what it was telling us as viwers about life.  And I thought it was original, as I can't think of another show who has done anything similar.  In all of the episodes this season we're put on a rollercoaster of emotions, we see a lot of things happen in a short time.  We see lose ends tied up and questions answered.  It's engrossing.  By the last episode, we're coming off of that rollercoaster and the ride is winding down.  It was a great ride, but it's over now.

I can't say enough good things about this show.  Although it's hard to find something that hasnt' already been said.

There is no definite end, as in real life there is often no definite end. Unlike what some people believe, there is no Michael Corleone coming out of the bathroom to kill Tony.
  There is one objection to the last season. The way that Chase ended the relationship between Melfi and Tony was very poorly done. From the beginning of the series, there was no belief expressed by Melfi that she could change Tony's way of life. Her goal was to make him as comfortable as possible in the life that he had.

2762545,5,B000NA1VI2,"""The Sopranos"" created one of the most entertainingly vivid and flawed cast of characters - both major and minor - ever for a television show.  We tuned in to see what was going to happen to Tony, Carmela, and dozens of others because we cared - often too much.  There are those still broken over Adriana's exit and scarred by Steve Buscemi's untimely end.

That's good writing.

So what else could Season Six, Part II offer but resolutions over its nine episodes?  There are resolutions aplenty, including Chris-ta-pha's final mano-a-mano with his drug use and Bobby Bacala's extra devotion to trains, but there are plenty of new stories to uncover.  A.J. struggles with matters of the heart and with nihilism.  Carmela still carries the demons of marrying Tony.  Dr. Melfi finally confronts the question of whether she has helped Tony heal or made him a better criminal.  And Tony must face down both Phil Leotardo and dissension among his own ranks.

Some of the series' finest writing can be found in these nine episodes - including the word ""miffled"" and a death scene involving an SUV and two grandchildren in child seats that will go down as one of the great gangster death scenes ever.

Much has been written about the enigmatic ending in the diner.  I have my own theories on what happens to Tony, but there are others . . . and many other folks who thought David Chase copped out.  The fact that there is such a furious debate over the ending just tells us how important this family has been to us over the years . . . and how much we'll miss them.",1211587200,,1558,4.561151079136691
2762546,5,B000NA1VI2,"I normally don't listen to audio commentary on DVDs, but I did with this set. The best of the lot is on Episode 8, ""The Blue Comet,"" featuring Little Steven and Arthur J. Nascarella. Little Steven makes an observation about the AJ character that is so apt, so hilarious, so spot-on accurate that I won't spoil it here. Both actors seem to have the most fun of all with their commentary.

One of the gems from the commentary is the revelation of David Chase's intention with the series: He did not want to portray mob life as glamorous, and he did not want to portray it as NOT glamorous. I think he found his balance.

Take the AJ character, for example. Could anyone who's watched the show for 7 seasons really expect redemption? In his final scenes, tooling around with his model girlfriend in his brand-new Beemer and laughing like an idiot on the sofa, stuffing his face with chips and enjoying the antics of ""MC Karl Rove"" on the TV...anyone surprised? Did you really think that he'd enlist and go to the front lines in Afghanistan or Iraq, or that he'd become The Donald's helicopter pilot? The genius of Chase is found in the fact that AJ is a bum, no doubt...but we see Tony and Carmela as his chief enablers. There's a point in everyone's life where the parents turn their kids loose in the world. AJ's 20 and they have no intention of letting him go. Listen to the Little Steven remark. He sums up AJ in 25 words or less.

What about Christopher? Somewhere around the first or second season, TV Guide featured an interview with ""real-life Jersey Wise Guys""...actual mob figures who rated the show's cast for accuracy. One of them called Christopher ""one for the trunk""...meaning that if it were real ife instead of TV, he would have easily been whacked within the first few episodes. In this instance, Tony received closure...he expressed his gratitude for the way he was portrayed in Christopher's movie, ""Cleaver.""

Janice takes one last sniff around Uncle Junior to see if she can locate his ""hidden money,"" but it is to no avail. Carmela still longingly looks at architect drawings and floor plans, but she's still not the real estate diva she's dreamed of becoming. Phil Leotardo's feeling a little run down (literally), Paulie's going through the ""every time I think I'm out they pull me back IN"" angst, and Tony claims he can no longer eat eggplant.

It all comes down to onion rings and Journey on the jukebox. I applaud David Chase for defying expectations, upsetting more than a few ""fans,"" and sending out one of the strongest series to ever hit the airwaves on a high note indees.",1210204800,,2602,4.623376623376624
2762547,5,B000NA1VI2,"On the first run-through of Season 6B, I thought it was really good, but a bit underwhelming at times, especially early on, but after watching the season a second and then a third time, I can safely say that The Sopranos went out on top.  Was it their best season?  I cannot say that, as it is hard to anything to top Season 2, which is arguably the best season of any television show ever, but Season 6B was outstanding, nonetheless.  It was definitely a darker season than we were used to, but the high quality was still there, in spades.

For me, one of the highlights of the season was the continuing buildup and the eventual resolution to the Tony/Christopher arc.  Animosity between the two had been building for several seasons, and it finally came to head.  At the end of ""Stage 5,"" when they hugged following the baptism of Christopher's daugher, you could see it in both of their eyes...there was nothing left.  Both were empty inside towards the other, and I thought, this is not going to end well.  And it didn't, as we all saw in ""Kennedy and Heidi.""  Without going into too much detail, I can honestly say that no episode of the show shocked me as much as this one, not even ""Long Term Parking,"" which I still regard as the best 60 minutes of television ever.  In fact, no matter how times I see ""Kennedy and Heidi,"" I am still shocked and amazed at how everything transpired.  The feel of the episode is unlike any other in the series, and it was at that point where you knew that there would be no redemption or salvation for Tony Soprano.

Which brings me to ""Made in America.""  What happened?  We will never know for sure, thanks to the creative mind of David Chase, who left it up to us to decide what Tony Soprano's fate was.  Personally, when I watched the ending live as it happened, like so many other fans, I was not happy with it.  I was like, ""that is it?""  But after watching it again, and after taking everything into consideration, there was enough there for me to draw my own conclusion as to what Tony's fate was.  Sure, David Chase could have made it nice and easy, but most fans of The Sopranos know that he was never about wrapping everything up in a nice and neat little package.  Chase always liked to make his viewers think, and he ended the show by making us all think.  Kudos to him for not doing the ""typical"" ending.  He took a chance, and the finale is now one of the most talked about television shows in history, and will probably remain so for a long time.

Ultimately, while I would have loved for The Sopranos to go on and on, the show went out on top.  Very few shows can say that, but to me, it is only fitting that what I consider the best dramatic television show ever did in fact go out on top.",1209772800,,2746,4.299610894941634

I actually fell asleep during the first episode it was that boring.  The second episode is more depressing than boring with Johnny Sack conveniently for the plot's sake dying of cancer in a prison hospital.

The show makes a recovery in the third episode and continues from there.  All of Tony's friends either end up being alienated, killed, or put into a coma we'll never see them wake up from.

Overall I was satisfied with the final season and I liked the much examined final scene and its ambiguity.  I thought it was quite brilliant actually.

2762563,5,B000NA1VI2,"I don't quite understand the Season 6 Part I and Part II breaks as opposed to breaking them into seasons proper, but whatever.  I'm sure on paper it makes sense to the writers.

This is the swan song for the famed HBO show about the New Jersey branch of the Mafia and it's beefy leader Anthony 'Tony' Soprano.  A recognizable figure to many today, this season takes pains to show the darkness, the pain and the evil of the man and his world.  This is probably the darkest season of a very dark show.

In fact, the season left me in a funk after nearly every episode in Spring of 2007.  Each of the eight final episodes explores Tony's relationship with both the major and supporting characters.  Something bad happens to nearly all of them as they're touched by Tony and his way of life.  Whether it's another confrontation with his appalling sister Janice and her husband, teddybear capo Bobby, which results in Bacala's full initiation into Tony's world, to the gambling insanity and it's strain on T's relationship with Hesh...it's all headed downhill for the big man.  Even the character of AJ, one of the more useless and unlikable during the course of the show (this in a cast of psychos and thieves) gets a fuller exploration as he heads into his own dark place.  Paulie, Christopher, Sil, Carmela...nobody is spared the black cloud that has followed Tony through five and a half seasons.  The Sopranos, a show about a mobster battling depression, became as much about depression as it did about gangsterism, gobbagool, and those amazing shirts Tony's been wearing for years.

As for the now-famous ending and the 'did Tony die or not' question...judge for yourself.  And whether he died or not, the final portion of the sixth season makes clear that things are not going to end well.

Excellent box set, though still pricey.  Only eight episodes, but a lot packed into each one.  The usual extras, including commentaries, but the real draw is the show itself.  Looks fantastic, too, as the production really began to benefit from HD with it's careful and moody lighting.

Actually, there were many incredible moments, as everybody who loves the show knows, but there was something particularly touching and ""right"" about these last ones.  How fun was Melfi's coming to terms with the fact that Tony's therapy is a bunch of b.s. and her dinner with her envious colleagues, including her sly therapist, played wonderfully by Peter Bogdanovich? As for the ending itself: it's impossible to kill someone you love (yes, even Christopher knew that).  So why did we expect David Chase to kill off the Sopranos we know he must love, with all their flaws and vices?  Did we expect that he would leave them any less a conundrum to us in the end? They finally appear, despite all the horrible things they've seen and done, a loyal, amusing, fun-loving, stylish, charming family unit, munching on onion rings at a beloved diner, and waiting, no doubt, for the axe to fall. Actually, they're like a lot of folks I know, how about you?",1202083200,2,1298,4.725663716814159
2762568,5,B000NA1VI2,"The end of the line came for ""The Sopranos"" last year when the critically acclaimed mob drama ended its eight year run. This was one of the best dramatic shows of all-time, and season 6, part 2 for the most part was excellent. It was an improvement over season 6, part 1, though just a tad below the first five seasons. It was a wise decision to end the show where it did. It might have gotten too tiresome if it had ran longer. Tony Soprano and gang returned for nine final episodes, and they didn't disappoint. The tension level rose with each episode as we wondered which characters would get whacked (some of the shows' major supporting characters did), and as the show was coming closer to the end we wondered what fate had in store for our favorite TV mobster. And yes, this show does have without question the most bizarre ending for a television series. I need not say anymore about the ending; just about everybody who's ever watched an episode of ""The Sopranos"" knows how it ended. Nevertheless, there was rarely a dull moment in any of the episodes in season 6, part 2; just another collection of great acting, writing, and directing. And it went out with a bang at the Emmys, receiving 15 nominations and winning for the second time as Best Drama Series (beating out fan favorite ""Grey's Anatomy"" and my current favorite drama series ""House""). It also won its sixth Emmy for Best Writing (David Chase for the final episode ""Made in America""), and (finally) winning its first Emmy for Best Directing (Alan Taylor for the sixth episode ""Kennedy and Heidi""). The total Emmy tally for ""The Sopranos"": 111 nominations and 21 wins.

The few quibbles I had with season 6, part 2: one problem was the absence of a few great supporting characters who were seen very little throughout the season, such as Uncle Junior (who got less and less screen time the past few seasons because of his trip into dementia) and sister Janice (who appeared often in the first episode, then is rarely seen until the last few episodes). Another complaint that I had was a moment that has to be seen to be disbelieved. Now throughout the show's run there were plenty of disgusting moments, and I'm not necessarily talking about the graphic violence. This show featured plenty of drug usage, vomiting, and characters breaking wind (the latter was always good for laughs). But the show went just too far in the disgusting department in episode 4 (titled ""Chasing It""). There's a scene where you see a bunch of teenage boys taking a shower in the boys locker room at their school (there's no nudity in the scene). Then the troubled son of the late mobster Vito (the one who turned out to be gay in season 6, part 1) steps into the shower, and has a bowel movement. And the camera actually pans down to show the mess he made. Was this really necessary?

Even though I gave ""The Sopranos - Season 6, Part 2"" five stars, I really give it 4  stars. Amazon's rating system won't allow  star reviews, so I ended up giving it 5 stars. If it did, I would give it 4  stars, because that's how I felt about this particular season. (I did this exact same thing in my review of ""The Golden Girls - The Complete Fifth Season"".) It was definitely better than the four star season 6, part 1; but a notch below the five star seasons 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Still, lots to like here in season 6, part 2. It shouldn't be missed.

Let me take a moment here to run down the list of people who made this show work during the eight years it was on. ""The Sopranos"" would not have been the great show it was if it weren't for the following individuals: James Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Lorraine Bracco, Michael Imperioli, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Robert Iler, Dominic Chianese, Tony Sirico, Steven Van Zandt, Aida Turturro, Drea de Matteo, Steven Schirripa, John Ventimiglia, Sharon Angela, Vincent Curatola, Frank Vincent, Joe Pantoliano, Steve Buscemi, Jerry Adler, Vincent Pastore, Federico Castelluccio, David Proval, Dan Grimaldi, Max Casella, Katherine Narducci, Tom Aldredge, Suzanne Shepherd, Peter Bogdanovich, Jason Cerbone, Joseph Gannascoli, Matt Servitto, Toni Kalem, Al Sapienza, and the late Nancy Marchand. Whether their roles were big or small, they all did a spectacular job. Nobody else could have played Tony Soprano as good as Gandolfini did. Same goes for Falco as Carmela; Imperioli as Christopher; Bracco as Dr. Melfi; etc. Much of the credit for this show being so good should go to creator David Chase. He made one hell of a show. It'll be with us forever.",1201564800,,4524,4.64875

2762603,5,B000NA1VI2,"I love this series and I watched all six seasons on DVD - three episodes a night.

The sixth season was as brilliant as all the others. The ending which so many don't like is related to Tony's favorite scene in ""The Godfather"" when Michael Corleone goes into the bathroom and comes out firing.

Are the individuals we see in flashes at the diner killers ready to spring on Tony? Are they the FBI ready to arrest him --- keeping in mind that his lawyer said it was 80 to 90 percent certain he was going to be arrested and brought to trial. or was it merely the writers attempt to end in a quandry?

I have my ideas on this but I'll keep them to myself not to ruin it for others.

This is writing, directing, and acting at a superior level all the way. My congratulations to everyone involved in this show.

i had actually waited till the BD version of season 6 parts 1 & 2 came out. Never read or bothered to ask anyone what happend in the end of this amazing saga.

Just  today i finished watching both parts and honeslty i was shocked by disapointment on 2 levels:
1) the ending seemed like not an ending but some leaway for possibly bringing it back, (wishful thinking)
2) very poor special features on the last disk. (even the commentay was not there for the last episode.)

i mean i am still a fan and will be forever but i don't know i felt like ...there is still something. The cat staring @ Chris's picture @ the Badda Bing back room and the way T sort of ....well i will stop here.

The cashier scanned the first 3 seasons and they all rang up at $19.99, but she scanned seasons 4-6 Part 1 and they rang up at $29.99. I said, ""the sign says $19.99"" and she said ""They're supposed to be"" and took off the $29.99 and re-rang them in at $19.99 each by overriding each price. I was astounded--WOW. Now all I need is Season 6 Part 2. The ad stated Seasons 1-3 for $19.99 and Seasons 4-6 Part 1 for $29.99, but it so happened that the sign at the display was wrong, so I got them all for $19.99 each--how cool is THAT? Guess I was in the right place at the right time, huh?

I expected this movie to keep you at the edge of your seat. It did not.
The other series were better than this one was. I even liked season 6 part 1.

I watched the first 3 episodes of season 6 part 2 and was ready to turn it off because thats how boring it was.
I kept watching it though because I was hoping that the rest would be better. They were not.
This one episode they show nothing but junior at his home and he has to take pills and he even wets himself at one point. Diary of an old man.

I didn't like the fact that they kept killing people of tony sopranos crew left and right.

And the ending of this season? I didn't like that either. Nothing suspenceful. It did not keep you at the edge of your seat waiting what was going to happen. It was boring as heck.

Everybody has their own opinion but my opinion is that if I had HBO back then and saw this season, I would not buy the dvd.
I am a long time Sopranos fan, but season six was garbage of the worst kind, comparable, inevitably, to the Godfather Part III. Everything was forced and the plot went nowhere, and it was quite obvious that the show became in some way self conscious. The writers began to take themselves far too seriously, and the ending to season six part 2 (a lame finale which only contains 9 episodes) is one of the worst endings in the history of television.
Enjoy seasons 1-5 just as you enjoy the Godfather Parts 1 and 2. Pretend the Godfather 3 never happened, and pretend that all 21 episodes of season 6 were never made.",1196380800,4,1787,4.2441176470588236

Like Mr. Chase said recently, ""it's not like the DaVinci Code - it's all right there."" That quick cut to black had everyone in the nation who'd seen the last show talking, and 4 out of 5 friends who hated the ending originally have revised their viewpoint after rewatching ""Made In America."" I laughed out loud at the audacity of that ending when I saw it.

2762657,5,B000NA1VI2,"If you've been under a rock and don't know how this series ends, well, I won't spoil it for you. Season 6, Part 2 of the Sopranos on DVD is a must have for anyone collecting the series, and one cannot review this part without considering the whole.

The entire saga is a case study of a brotherhood of sociopaths in a modern day Mafia setting. On the surface, you might describe The Sopranos as something between The Godfather and My Cousin Vinny. This mob functions quietly and efficiently, as one might expect, skillfully piloted by the boss, Tony Soprano, yet we watch him struggle to address his inner demons in weekly psychotherapy sessions.

Tony is a loving family guy, full of contradictions, who cannot resist temptation, engaging in serial affairs with women he meets in casual settings. Throughout the story, there are flashbacks to his youth, and we see his young father and mother as they interact with each other and with other family members. It doesn't take long for the viewer to begin to see resemblance to his mother in the women he dallies with, a very definite Oedipus complex at work.

Our main character is very intelligent in mob business and one must pay close attention to dialog to catch his subtle malapropisms... so subtle are they, you might miss them. Personally, I found them somehow ""jarring"" to the story line, distracting, but perhaps my judgment is too harsh, and the writer enjoys playing with our brain in a tongue-in-cheek way.

There is no resolution to Tony's psychological problems, but he doesn't know that. His visits to Dr. Melfi are skillfully used to give the viewer insight into our main character by underlining and highlighting the flaws in his thinking, watching him circle around his personality defect but never recognizing the elephant in the room.

All of the acting is perfect. Every character is perfectly cast and every story is neatly wrapped up, even if it extends into multiple episodes. The series netted a number of well deserved Emmys over the years it played on HBO.

The end of Season 6 leaves the viewer craving more even while acknowledging the end MUST come. One will ponder the fate of the Soprano family, whom we have come to love over the years in spite of the lack of compunction, contrition or remorse.

Note of caution: The Sopranos is not for everyone. If your sensibilities are easily affronted, avoid this series. There is nudity, adult sexual situations, strong language - oh - and violence. Lots of violence... to say nothing of the absence of morality.",1195862400,4,2533,4.795871559633028

I can appreciate the quality of a production independent of how edifying the ""message"" is, but apparently as I am getting older, I'm losing my ability to enjoy movies that are basically negative with little to redeem the lives of the participants. By now we all know that there is little to redeem the lives of individuals wrapped up in organized crime, and without some kind of an uplifting aspect to the drama, I'm left with the feeling that I wish it would just go away.

Just to show you that I am capable of enjoying serious movies about crime, take the recent, ""Eastern Promises."" I just love that movie and plan on buying it when it becomes available. That's a movie I can watch over and over again. It's exhilarating. Another one is ""A History of Violence."" Wow. Exhilerating, no matter how nasty some of the characters are.

2762665,5,B000NA1VI2,"i don't think i need to tell anyone reading this how excellent the sopranos is. it's great, epochal television, a series well worth owning and rewatching. my beef is with hbo charging a list price of almost 100 dollars for 9 episodes on 4 discs (they could easily fit on 3). 22 episodes of a show like alias, or buffy, sells for one quarter of the price (plus you get more extras).

maybe at some point the sopranos, entourage, etc. will be rereleased at reasonable prices (a la the x files). but that just means the truest fans are getting ripped off. shame on you, hbo.",1194480000,,571,4.386792452830188

I was not thrilled with all the time spent you A.J., his depression was sad and his attempt to drown himself was powerful, but he was always represented such sloth, and it was hard to really feel for this spoiled, indulged kid..the story arc just went on and on.  I like when the show focuses on Tony, and the tension between he and Phil Leotardo is riviting,  when the war starts it's no holds bared.  Alot of people felt the ending was trite and disappointing, but I had no problem with the fade to black and the ambiguousness of the ending, it just seemed so David Chase.

2762678,5,B000NA1VI2,With this DVD I will have the complete set of all the Soprano collection. I am sorry to see it end. In my opinion the Sopranos is the best drama every made.,1193011200,3,156,3.90625
2762679,5,B000NA1VI2,"In previous seasons, violence has always been apparent.  It has never been over done, it has always occurred but then things calmed down again.  In season six part two, the violence finally explodes.  The brakes come off.  The very worst of each character, their essence, is portrayed.  This is not as subtly as previous seasons, but it works.

It is a closing season,and it offers closure.  Paulie is a nostalgic motor mouth loner.  Bobby is a nice guy who finally kills, and by return karma, gets killed.  We are left in no doubt that Tony Sr is a selfish and nasty piece of work, who's ""bonhomie"" manner is no cover for his violent inner self.  Tony Jr is his father's son in that he gets depression and thinks deeply, but pampered by his family's wealth, lacks his father's steely inner core.

Season three was the most enjoyable, but this runs it a close second.  The ending is fine...we have been shown a window into The Sopranos' world, and now it has closed.

The one quirk which has been noted by another reviewer is the odd storyline of Tony borrowing money off Hesh.  It is only 200k, the sort of amount one has seen him stash in a flower pot at home before.  Tony suffers gambling losses, but one feels his character shows more restraint than to gamble to the extent to be so badly in need of a relatively small amount of money.",1192924800,5,1340,4.45679012345679
2762680,5,B000NA1VI2,"The greatest writing , acting and directing of all time - simply perfection - invest the time to enjoy 70 hrs of the mob , and then be given the gift that is the final scene - pure tension , pure wonder , pure art ... fade to black and don't stop believing.",1192492800,2,257,3.8679245283018866
2762681,5,B000NA1VI2,"Rather than force feeding his loyal viewers a trite, cliche-ridden ending that left nothing to the imagination, David Chase allowed for everyone's interpretation of ""what happened"" after the screen went black.  I don't think any of us will ever listen to ""Don't Stop Believing"" the same ever again!

Final episode aside, Season Six Part 2 was chock full of excellent story lines, superior character development, and fantastic episodes, beginning with ""Soprano Home Movies"", which contained one of the series' best fight scenes, this one between Tony and Bobby.  ""Kennedy and Heidi"", in which Christopher ""died"", mortified me more than just about any other episode, and showed Tony for the monster he truly was.

While ""Made in America"", the series finale, could have easily ended after Tony's visit to see his uncle Junior, it infuriated some while enthralling others, all the while maintaining the intensity and chutzpah that is David Chase and ""The Sopranos"".",1192406400,4,961,5.261437908496732
2762682,5,B000NA1VI2,"Heidi and Kennedy, one of the last episodes of the series included in this package, is probably the finest and most complex hour in the history of television, and one of the highlights of the decade in terms of audiovisual art. Hell, The Sopranos is, maybe with the exception of David Lynch's work (Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire) and Wes Anderson's films (Royal Tennenbaums), the best american movie of the decade (it really doesn't matter that it didn't hit the cinemas and lasts more than 70 hours). A classic.",1191628800,6,517,4.820224719101123
2762683,5,B000NA1VI2,"For years, like many others, I have thought of film, at its best, as ""art.""  I have also thought that while television had that potential, it was doomed never to achieve it. Granted, documentaries like ""The Civil War"" and ""Baseball"" by Ric Burns exceeded in quality and depth anything done in film, but TV drama was somehow inherently limited, despite a few flashes of brilliance here and there.  There would never be a TV show as excellent, as drama, as the best of the movies.

  That has, I believe, changed - by the ""Sopranos"" above all, but also ""Prime Suspect""  ""The L Word"" ""Six Feet  Under"" and even shows like ""Big Love"" and ""Dexter"" (neither of which Ilike nearly as much - but they are still orders of magnitude better than the usual network pap).  TV has - finally - discovered that it has the capacity for sustained drama and in depth character development.  ""The Departed"" was a wonderful film - but no 2 hour drama can show and illuminate the kind of character changes and nuances the ""Sopranos"" consistently managed.  Dirty Harry looks like a cartoon compared to Brenda Lee Johnson of ""The Closer.""  Madeleine Kahn and Loretta Swit did great goofy characters in the movies, but Mary Louise Parker's character in ""Weeds"" sets new standards.

  ""Sopranos,"" I think, wll endure both as excellent drama in its own right, and as a seminal event in the history of television.  It has been,. more than any other show, the one that proved that TV at its best could be the equal of any movie.

  I think it also interesting that the break-through came by way of cable with its greater freedom in terms of language and what can be shown.

  And one minor point.  Everyone praises David Chase, the writers, James Gandolfini, Edi Falco, etc etc but we should not forget that part  of what made the ""Soprano's""  so good  was  its soundtrack.  The thing was just fun to listen to, as well as watch.  Stevie Van Zandt, as well as being a totally amusing consigliere, selected or inspired a lot of that and I think he deserved a special Emmy just for being...him.",1190678400,11,2063,4.593406593406593
2762684,5,B000NA1VI2,"If you manage to still be one of those people complaining about the ending of ""Made In America,"" the final hour of The Sopranos, may I congratulate you - you've managed to prove something that many of us who love the episode know to be true: you simply cannot get the thing out of your head.  I spent days after it aired thinking the initial cut to black did not mean what my gut reaction felt - that Tony and his family were gunned down and David Chase simply opted not to show it, and that instead it proved that in this existence, the anxiety is more ""real"" than life or death.  I think that is true, but I also think I was reluctant to admit the intention of that scene, based on the rich creation of those characters - not knowing that The Sopranos are dead spares us the reality that The Sopranos are dead; my analysis was a little self-protective.  It is, however, the anxiety that seals it, in a (half) season full of one shock after another, the grim truth that, as Tony states in ""Soprano Home Movies"" - ""80% of the time, this thing ends in the can like Johnny Sack, or on the embalming table,"" and Tony, probably, faces both.  This is the season that redefines fearlessness, setting off one bomb after another - exploding the ferocity barely masked in Christopher's addiction (""Walk Like A Man,"" which should've given Michael Imperioli a victory lap Emmy) only to shock us with his first-act death an episode later (""Kennedy and Heidi"").  Having Janice state that she will never become her mother (""Soprano Home Movies"") while her destiny seems to be exactly the opposite (Junior mistakes her for Livia in their final moments together).  The season is so extraordinary, it shows us the last moments of Junior's sanity in ""Remember When,"" but does so with so little fanfare, we don't realize just what we saw until the very end.  It turns Chrisopher's death in ""Kennedy and Heidi"" into an uncomfortable rumination on those of us that remain alive.  It shocks us with Tony's humanity (his suited dive into the pool to save AJ in ""The Second Coming"") while fulfilling his vileness (the moment we're certain he'll kill Paulie in ""Remember When"").  So much can be said about each astonishing installment here - and its final second ensures that most things will get said - that it bares stating the simplest of facts: this is the most visionary work ever created on television, and no amounts of repeated viewings can do it justice.",1190592000,16,2438,4.599078341013825
2762685,5,B000NA1VI2,"So much of what's said abut the final season of The Sopranos refers to the last five minutes, as people unfortunately overlook the best nine episode string of the entire series.  David Chase's last season of television's finest program is full of all the qualities that attracted viewers and critics for the past decade.  Characters live in a world where death is a possibility each day, but aren't shown to be gods or royalty.  Rather, viewers see in them all of the emotions experienced in every family, as Tony, Carmela, Christopher and the rest of the cast share their memorable loves, hates, dreams, failures...and meals.

Season 6.2 has three distinct parts.  The first four episodes  are ""last moments in the sun"" for some of the more important characters.  Bobby and Janice retreat for a weekend on a lake with Tony and Carm; Johnny Sack battles a new enemy in prison; institutionalized Uncle Junior spends his last moments of sanity running a card game and mentoring a young killer; and Hesh fears for his safety when Tony owes him money and seems reluctant to pay.

Next, the season moves to the difficulties of AJ and Christopher and how both problems affect Tony.  Tony takes a backseat to other characters in the opening episodes of the season, but he's never been more laid bare than in how he deals with his literal and figurative sons.  As with the ambiguous nature of the show,  Tony at times appears to be a heroic, thoughtful and brave, while other times, he's a monster.

Finally, the last two episodes end in the much anticipated war with New York, as successful and unsuccessful hits are targeted at the show's biggest players.  A sense of closure is reached with Tony's relationships with his rivals, his crew, his family and the FBI, but as everyone in America knows, nothing concrete is declared about his future.  Does he live?  Does he go to prison?  Will his crew survive?  Those questions aren't answered, Chase`s last gift to his viewers, as people can continue turning this show over in their heads for years.

I wasn't there when The Tempest first played at the Globe, and I didn't see The Beatles at Candlestick Park.  But Sunday Nights at 9pm on HBO, I saw my generation's finest contribution to pop culture and to literature, with the final season providing a closing act worthy of such a masterpiece.",1190419200,178,2336,4.751861042183623
2762699,5,B000NA1VI2,"I'm really going to miss looking forward to Sunday nights at 8:00.  I loved this show and am going to preorder Season 6, Part 2 as soon as I'm done typing this though I don't like the high price but HBO knows the can get away with it.

I disagree with all the people saying that Part 2 was a disappointment.  Most of the past seasons started slowly and built up to a big season finale.  In my opinion David Chase did the same thing here.  You couldn't take your eyes off the TV during the last episode.  It was perfect.

Tony didn't get killed.  His life went, ""On and on and on.""  I won't, ""...Stop believing.""",1189987200,4,611,4.153846153846154
2762700,3,B000NA1VI2,"...and I'm not talking about the controversial final seconds of this great show.  (My only complaint about that was that it wasn't set up better.  If it was a hit, who ordered it?  To have Tony whacked at that moment in the storyline only raised more questions that smothered a surprising but satisfying end to the saga).

But that's the story of Season Six: it wasn't set up well enough.  There were so many threads from the previous five seasons that surely something could have reappeared!  And I mean more than the handgun Tony ditched when Johnny Sack got taken down by the Feds.

I loved this show and I think the first three seasons are among the best television ever produced.  Season Four had its moments (but no real momentum), Five was back to family business, and Six just flopped around, filling in a lot of dead air between some truly great moments.  Vito's gay mobster storyline had me constantly wondering what was going on back in Jersey.  Just too long.  The cast was great, as always, but the writing has been slacking for a while.

I couldn't wait to buy Seasons One through Three when they were released.  I still haven't picked up the others.

I wish they did.

When Season 5 ended, all who were not yet convinced were certain that The Sopranos was one of the greatest shows of all time. The final two episodes of that season (Long Term Parking and All Due Respect) were two of the greatest episodes of all time in the history of television. Let me be frank, people. I am a long time Sopranos fan, but season six was garbage of the worst kind, comparable, inevitably, to the Godfather Part III. Everything was forced and the plot went nowhere, and it was quite obvious that the show became in some way self conscious. The writers began to take themselves far too seriously, and the ending to season six part 2 (a lame finale which only contains 9 episodes) is one of the worst endings in the history of television.

Out of the 9 episodes on this disc, two of the episodes were good. The Second Coming and The Blue Comet. This is where all of us got excited, because we were sure that the final episode would be incredible.

It starts off with nothing happening (Sopranos home movies, they play freakin Monopoly half the time) and it ends with nothing happening (the notorious Made in America). So unless you are a collector, there is no reason to buy this, especially given the enormous price tag.

Enjoy seasons 1-5 just as you enjoy the Godfather Parts 1 and 2. Pretend the Godfather 3 never happened, and pretend that all 21 episodes of season 6 were never made.

2762702,5,B000NA1VI2,"Remember viewers: Tony Soprano is the most organic and challenging character on television; he is larger than life.  Think of the thousands of T.V. characters that have appeared over the years.  Tony is iconic.

That said, viewers must understand Tony and his world in order to fully appreciate the last nine episodes.  Ignore the naysayers folks; Tony and his crew light it up one last time (or rather, nine times) in order to finish strong.  The final nine shows are the capstone for the series.  Each episode is a monument.

For fans of the program, buying this set is a no-brainer.  Forget the price and buy the set.

2762703,5,B000NA1VI2,"Since I don't suppose many people are going to consider purchasing this if they haven't already seen the episodes, I won't go on at length about the quality of the show itself. I don't see how any Sopranos fan could fail to appreciate how Chase continually raised the emotional stakes, pushing Tony farther and farther along the precipice until we can't help but see him as Dr. Melfi finally does: an irredeemable sociopath. Powerful, powerful stuff, and fully in keeping with everything that has gone before.

A note to the reviewers who complained about the price: yes, the DVDs are expensive, because the episodes are expensive. Each one contains upwards of half a dozen or more popular songs, all of which must be re-licensed for inclusion on the DVD. The only way to make the DVDs cheaper would be to drop the songs or replace them with cheap soundalike versions ... and imagine the outcry if THAT happened.",1189209600,7,912,4.772151898734177
2762704,3,B000NA1VI2,"The Sopranos for the current era, rivaled the Dallas series of the late 70's early 80's, during its time people tuned in weekly to see what J.R. would do next, or see how the sideline stories and plots played out, usually with a season ending teaser, so you would be on edge until next season, Who can forget ""Who Shot J.R."" season ending. The Sopranos brought back that type of weekly fan following and anticipation, with people tuning in on Sunday to see what Tony would do next, and how the various side plots would play out. The series was great and will go down as one well remembered for years, and no doubt there will be some attempt to make a follow up Box office or made for HBO movie down the line. The negitive side of this series is how HBO has exploited the fans of this show with the huge price tag attached to the season box sets. A true must have fan of the show will pay $140-$200 for one whole season broken up into 2 sets what a rip-off. Most other season based shows put out by Fox or other producers come out at $30-40, but HBO prices all of its series twice as much. The true fan that can wait a little to add this season to their collection would help their pocket out by waiting a few months and picking the season up from a good after seller for probably half the price. Right now you can find any previous released season for prices from $18-35, so the fan that has waited can get a good deal. HBO should stop exploiting their fan base so much, and be more reasonable with their prices.",1188604800,17,1512,4.2172413793103445

It was this; I may not like every show, but the acting and the writing was never less than first rate.  This last season was yet another example of how Chase and team could never write a script too complex for the most talented group of actors and extras ever assembled.  Regardless of the fact that should you subscribe to a cable service offering 'On Demand' you can see these episodes pretty much when you wish, I would rather own the DVDs.

8175872,5,B000NA1VI2,"I also bought this for a friend so they could complete their collection.

Two years ago when I started a new job and I didn't have a car at the time I decided to walk to Pizza Hut before work and order a personal pan pizza. They're very small. But I wasn't aware how small or how expensive they were.

 So I entered the lobby remembering an article I had read either online or in a newspaper that Pizza Hut, facing a slump in sales, had been considering changing their franchise name to ""The Hut"" and re-doing the lobby so that when you enter the store it would have a different look, and adding a tv that would have game shows like Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy playing on it.

 I ordered my personal pan pizza. It was like $6. They seriously took 40 minutes to make it. I couldn't believe it.
 It took so long to get my food I was actually amused and entertained by it. I started laughing to myself in a deranged and frustrated manner.
 So they finally brought it out to me when it was done. By then I only had a short time before work and I started walking.

 Not ten seconds after I left the restaurant it started pouring rain, very hard too. I didn't want to get all soaking wet so I ran into the nearest building for shelter, which was a local carwash.
 They had put my tiny little pizza, in its box, inside of a flimsy plastic bag.
  And apparently the personal pan pizza box was even more of a joke, as I noticed that it didn't hold the tabs closed that secures the lid.
 So my entire dinky little pizza had fallen out into the plastic bag and what miniscule toppings were on it were in their own little sector of grease separate from the dough/crust.
 So I stood there in the car wash with it pouring rain outside, irritated, my clothes completely soaked in rain water, and ate my Pizza Hut Personal Pan Pizza out of the bottom of the plastic bag. And I had it gone in record time, little as it was.
