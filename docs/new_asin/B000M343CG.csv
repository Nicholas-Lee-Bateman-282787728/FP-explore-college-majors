2719133,5,B000M343CG,"Awesome Movie !!! Nick really did a good job making this movie and series. It's a movie about real kids in a band, and they do play the instruments and sing. It's awsome, I don't want to spoil it, but you should really buy it or at least watch it. Support the Naked Brothers Band. Nat's songs are really deep and really good.",1171670400,4,325,4.174603174603175

2719147,5,B000M343CG,"I gave it five stars because my daughter, who is a Naked Bros Band fan, loves it.  I, on the otherhand, think it's incredibly silly - but it's not me that it's designed for so it really doesn't matter what I think, anyway.  If you like these guys, you'll like the DVD.",1198800000,,268,4.134615384615385

2719149,5,B000M343CG,"I bought this movie after watching and thoroughly enjoying the series of the same name. In all honesty, I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as the show - and I turned out to be completely wrong! I loved it.
To be brief, The Naked brothers Band: The Movie is a rockumentary/mockumentary (a documentary based loosely, but not on actual real life) based loosely on the lives of nine- and six-year-old brothers Nat and Alex Wolff and their band. It follows the band through their rehearsals, concerts...and arguments! When the band, The Silver Boulders, breaks up, Nat and Alex attempt to form another band with the help of their funny, but clueless, accordion-playing father.
What makes this movie even funnier is the fact that Nat, nine, has a huge crush on band member Josh Kaye's 11-year-old step-sister Rosalina. He finds all encounters with her daunting to say the leats, and even more so when his fellow band members begin to tease him, leading to tension in the band and eventually their break-up. Alex is also hilarious - he is only six, and says many things Nat deems 'inappropriate', not to mention the fact that he behaves the way every child would like to if only they had the nerve!
However, the songs and the music are the highlight of the movie for me. They are catchy and definitely score high in my top 50 songs! Also, they are written by nine-year-old Nat himself (in true life, but just the movie)! The brothers are extremely talented. The ending was definitely the icing on the cake. It finished with a song, Crazy Car, and the whole band singing on a rooftop overlooking New York City.
I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has watched the TV series or would like a good laugh and some fun! It is perfect for children aged 3 - 13.
NOTE: Although there is a warning on the page about trying to play this DVD on DVD-Players outside of America/DVD-Players that are not built for Region 1 DVDs, I live in the UK and the DVD played fine on the second DVD-Player I tried, although it would not play on the first. Most DVD-Players will play it, although some, that are supposed to be multi-region (meaning that they should play DVDs from any country) will not.",1186876800,,2174,4.562659846547315
2719150,5,B000M343CG,"The dvd was in excellent condition and my daughter absolutely loves the movie...since I received it, she's watch it 10 times.",1181174400,,125,5.0
2719151,4,B000M343CG,"Bought this at request of my eight year old daughter. The movie captures the  TV debut of this totally engineered for TV band. It is humorous and appropriate for a pre-teen or older child, no mindless gore and violence/gratuitious sex and profanity. Very bubblegum, not that there's anything wrong with that. The kids are cute, and there are a few nice bits of visual interest with time lapsed action sequences, some music and slapstick routines. Nothing terribly surprising in this light fare.",1180396800,5,494,5.024390243902439
2719152,5,B000M343CG,"My 6 and 4 year old daughters absolutely adore Nat & Alex Wolff, and I must admit that I do too! They are both so stinking cute, I could squeeze them silly ;) I find myself watching the show/movie when my kiddos have left the room at times. Very clean, fun entertainment for parents and kids to watch together. I love the interaction between Nat and Rosalina, Alex & Jesse and the sheer goofiness of Michael Wolff and that accordian ;) So much fun. These kids are all TRULY talented at acting and music alike. Great songs that keep your toes tapping...very infectious. The impromptu nature of the ""mockumentary"" film is captivating. Order it today!! Only snafu is that the bonus CD is *not* included as previously offered with the DVD. You have to request a copy of the 5 song CD from Paramount. But it ships via UPS quickly and my kids have just about worn a hole in it from repeated use :) We all LOVE it!",1179878400,4,907,4.372781065088757
2719153,5,B000M343CG,"My grandson loves the show and the music. Wasn't happy with the marketing of the bonus CD, but finally received it....he loves it.",1179014400,3,130,4.695652173913044
2719154,5,B000M343CG,"The Naked Brothers Band movie was a really good purchase. I enjoyed the movie and the songs they played. I found the price for the item was really low and was very happy with the value I got.  Someday Nat Wolf will be one of the best stars. For his age he is very talented as well as the rest of his band. I look forward to more cds showing this talent. He puts a lot of effort in the music he writes. I also want to thank Amazon for their help in receiving the extra cd that was to come with it. It shows that they really want to do what is best for the consumer. I did receive it and Paramount was great too, sending it by UPS, I really appreciated their effort to please us also.",1179014400,,682,3.906474820143885
2719165,5,B000M343CG,"This is a fun family film. It reminds me of the Monkees and The Beatles' film HELP! The Wolff brothers are obviously products of a creative family and are not just a ""pet project"" of their parents. They have talent to back it up. My child likes the movie and the series for the music, the comedy and the kids, who seem real.  My husband and I like the satire and mockumentary style of the film. And the songs are catchy, too. Keep on doing your thing Nat and Alex!",1176163200,3,464,4.155555555555556

2719167,5,B000M343CG,"This show is Spinal Tap meets The Monkees, with kids in the place of adults. This is marketed for kids, and it pretty much is for them, but there is a lot going on here that spans age groups. I'm sure many parents get a kick out of it as much as their kids do. I know I do. The writing and dialog is top notch, and the actors actually act like kids, not the usual phoney stuff you see on similar shows, many of which are generally unwatchable. Either Polly Draper really understands them, and/or the kids all have input into the show. They all have good chemistry. Nat's singing is solid, and Alex's dialog delivery is hilarious. The songs are 60's pop/indie style, and for what they are, far more listenable than the horrible Alecia Keys/Justin Timberlake clone stuff you hear on many other shows on the same channel. My one and only criticism is the title. The band originally called themselves the Silver Boulders, which is a much better name for a band. But it's not much of a complaint. I wish the show and Nat and Alex all the success in the world. Keep rockin'!",1175644800,3,1068,4.371859296482412
2719168,5,B000M343CG,"My sons, ages 8 and 4, are HUGE fans of The Naked Brothers. They aspire to be just like Nat and Alex and are planning on having their own T.V show ,too. We have homemade posters on our walls that say ""Nat and Alex Rock!!!!"" The fact is, everyone in our house enjoys The Naked Brothers show. We watch it together as a family. It is good, wholesome entertainment and I am thrilled that my sons have the Wolff brothers as role models.

I purchased the DVD as an Easter gift for my boys. I know they will be thrilled.",1175040000,3,513,4.13
2719169,5,B000M343CG,"I have a 7-year old ""budding musician"" son who is absolutely HOOKED on the Naked Brothers Band.  I ordered this movie/CD combo for him as an Easter gift and I am SURE it'll be a bigger hit than the chocolate rabbit!  My son is probably Alex's biggest fan and has dreams of inviting the band to play at his school someday....  As a parent, I have no problem, whatsoever, with the Naked Brothers.  They are cute, spunky kids doing something that they love doing and they are not drug-crazed, violent role models that our kids could otherwise be looking up to.  Give them a chance...you won't be disappointed.",1174953600,2,606,4.574074074074074
2719170,5,B000M343CG,Don't judge a movie by it's cover!!! This is an awesome show and band. I really love Nat's voice and his lyrics. They seem to be about the weirdest things which is why I love them. The show is good but at times I feel like the humor is a tad forced. Otherwise this is great and I can't wait for all of their songs are available.,1174867200,2,328,3.91044776119403

Then along came Justin Leave it to Bieber  ( I'm stuck on myself, don't care about my young fans anymore, just buy my songs so I can party like Miley C. etc..)  and she fell in love like the rest of young girls.  But now she has seen how he treats his fans.  So down came the posters and delete his songs from her mp3 player and she remembered The Naked Brothers Band didn't let the fame get to their heads like others.  So she is really interested in them again!!  Trust me these guys are alright!",1377302400,,612,4.041666666666667
