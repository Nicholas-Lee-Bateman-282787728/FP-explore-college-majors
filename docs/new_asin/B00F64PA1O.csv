5968202,4,B00F64PA1O,"a really interesting insight into an iconic picture and a very plausible identification of two Irish workers, made even more so by the fact that the picture was hanging in a pub in their native village in Ireland too - the sort of pub that would not normally have such pictures.  Fascinating to discover all the archives of photos, what a splendid record.",1418342400,,355,4.634920634920635
5968203,4,B00F64PA1O,"The only comment I have regarding the Ove' Glove is that the set I have personally has hang-up loops inside at the cuff whereas the ones I purchased as a gift did not.

However, many cooks keep their pot holders in a draw, so that is not a big drawback.  All in all, I think the Ove' Glove pot holders are
the best pot holders on the market.

Thanks,

5968205,3,B00F64PA1O,Supported by an irish company - of course they will support the hypothesis that the man on the edge is from ireland :) They have no proof. Slovak Gusti Popovic is in fact sitting there and there is a proof - he sent this picture back to slovakia to his wife as a postcard with a descriptive text written in slovak. This photo is on his tomb there.,1402963200,2,347,4.117647058823529
5968206,5,B00F64PA1O,"Men eating their lunch atop an I-beam while building 30 Rockefeller Plaza during the Great Depression proves to be the best documentary of the year. Its called Men at Lunch and is based on a single photograph that epitomizes New York, New York, in a way nothing else can.

Made by an Irish film company, the movie is quintessential Americana, showing the character of the men who literally built New York City one beam at a time.

No one is sure who took the picture, and no one is certain as to the identity of the eleven men in various states of ease and conviviality while having lunch hour. They sit like birds on a high-wire with Central Park behind them.

Why this photograph has come to epitomize New York over hundreds of other iconic images turns out to be the force behind the moving picture. You will be moved.

We seldom tell you to drop everything and put a movie at the head of your movie queue, but this is the occasion. The film is a joy forever and is all the more delightful if you want an affirmation of whats good about America.

The photo itself was likely staged, but the characters and their modeling acumen could not come from the man taking the picture. What you see is the brave and genuine men who did ironwork on the mammoth skyscrapers of New York.

Narrated by Fionnula Flanagan and directed by Sean O Cualain, it gives an outsider perspective to show Americans what rugged individualism they had in their ancestors, and what we still admire today.

September 20, 1932, has been frozen in time, as they say, for our delectation. What was likely a throwaway human-interest photo for a Sunday newspaper audience has become something akin to the Sistine Chapel for America.

Art comes in all shapes, sizes, and people.",1400803200,2,1745,4.57051282051282
5968207,5,B00F64PA1O,"A local supper club has added copies of these workmen along their roof ledge.  This dvd explained the history of the picture very well, and has added a new appreciation to the statues every time I pass them.  Thanks to your explanations in the dvd, I can pass on their stories to others.  Thank you for gathering the background stories and presenting it in this format.",1399075200,,369,4.5606060606060606
5968208,3,B00F64PA1O,I had already seen Men At Lunch on the big screen. I wanted to have it at home as a very touching historical document on the little Irish village from which came the spidermen who planted up New York.,1396915200,,200,4.153846153846154
5968209,5,B00F64PA1O,"Most folks have seen the iconic photo from 1932 of the 11 steelworks perched on an I-beam high above the Manhattan skyline. (If you aren't sure of what Im referring to, look at the image on the DVD package for this Amazon listing). According to the folks at Cortis (the image archive with 20 million images to license) this is the most requested one. It was taken in 1932 as the central skyscraper for Rockefeller Center in New York was being constructed. This is what is now known as 30 Rock  the home of NBC, as well as the name for Tina Feys hit comedy show.

As I watched this 67-minute film the opening credits appeared and I learned that this was a production from the Irish Film Board and most of the production credits were of Irish individuals. It wasn't until about 2/3 of the way through the fascinating film that I learned why it was produced in Ireland (though filmed in New York).  Ill try not to give a spoiler by sharing the answer as I think its more interesting if you hear (see) it for yourself.

There are interviews here with the curator for the Rockefeller Center (where the filmmakers visited to find more images taken of the construction site) as well as the American author of a book on skyscrapers titled  High Steel and documentarian Ric Burns (Kens brother who made the film on The Statue of Liberty, among other New York films) plus an Irish photographer who captured the rebuilding of the Twin Towers.

The quality of the images  both the archival still photos and film  is really high and, honestly, those who have acrophobia (fear of heights) may find some the images uncomfortable on a large flat screen.

Part of the story had documentation and part of it is still unproven but the film is worth your time.
The bonus features include five deleted scenes (for a total of 8 minutes) , the most informative one being the 1-minute history of Rockefeller Center.

This is another in the fine series of documentaries from First Run Features. (A few trailers for other FRF documentaries are included as extras on the DVD)

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8612588,4,B00F64PA1O,"""Men At Lunch"" (2012 release from Ireland; 75 min.) is a documentary that takes a closer look at the story (more accurately: the stories) behind the infamous ""Lunch Atop a Skyscraper"" picture that features 11 men having lunch on a steal beam high above the streets of Manhattan. If you've ever been to New York, in particular the touristy areas like Times Square, surely you have seen the street vendors hawking this picture.

As the documentary opens, Irish director Sen Cualin (indeed, this turns out to be an Irish production--more on that later) (re)introduces us to the picture, cleverly inducing a 3D effect as we are watching the B&W picture. Maybe some viewers already know the background information but for me much of it was new information: the picture was taken on September 29, 1932, during construction of the Rockefeller Center at the height of the Depression, and first published in a New York newspaper a few days later (October 2, 1932). The documentary does a great job providing context of the times (the Yankees won the WS that week over the Cubs; presidential elections looming a month later, etc.), and what the construction of ""30 Rock"" and other skyscrapers meant for the city. The best insights come from the Rockefeller Center Archive, which has a bunch of other pictures taken during its construction. The length to which photographers went, and the risks they took, to take these pictures! When looking at the 11 men sitting on the steel beam, I can't help but wonder how they weren't petrified to somehow fall off the beam, to a death certain. Or, as someone comments: ""The pay (for that work) was good, but you had to be willing to die"", wow.

The second part of the documentary takes a different direction, becoming an investigation of sorts as to who those 11 men at lunch were. Surprisingly, this part of the documentary (where the link to Ireland is made--hence the Irish funding of this) is far less interesting and entertaining. So in the end, the documentary about ""the common men's superheroes"" is terrific to start off, but fizzles out in the second part. Still, I'd say that ""Men At Lunch"" is worth checking out if you have more than a passing interest in the history of New York and/or the 1930s.",1423612800,3,2238,4.765463917525773
8612589,4,B00F64PA1O,"This Irish documentary provides an informative look at the men and photographers behind one of America's most iconic photographs. There is a fair bit of repetition and at times the action drags, but it's well worth the time spent.",1421539200,2,230,4.923076923076923
8612590,5,B00F64PA1O,We were pleasantly surprised and in awe by the anonymity of the men pictured on the beam photo that we had to view this documentary. The documentary does a great job in sharing the history of the photo as well as the life stories of the known Irish men pictured on each end of the beam. Wonderful mix of interviews and photos from both sides of the pond.,1421366400,,354,4.220588235294118
