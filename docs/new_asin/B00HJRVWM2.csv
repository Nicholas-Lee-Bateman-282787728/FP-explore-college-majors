6167283,5,B00HJRVWM2,"The five star rating is for the double-feature and good deal/price.  Four stars for The Two Jakes (1990), a much better squeal to the Chinatown (1974).  I know that many people will disagree with me on that, but in my opinion--folks who think that Chinatown is Polanski's best film are--- out of their mind. The Two Jakes is a film with a much more interesting intrigue and its cinematography is beautifully shot.  The plot is more involving compared to Chinatown...which I found very boring and out right extremely over-rated.  In The Two Jakes, directed and starting Jack Nicholson, Jake is hired by a wealthy businessman (in this role Harvey Keitel) to wire-tap his unfaithful wife who is cheating on him with his business-partner.  The film takes place few years later after the original Chinatown events.  The wire-tapping and eavesdropping goes haywire, when the husband (Harvey Keitel) storms the hotel room and shoots in cold blood his wife's lover.  Afterwards, Jake is accused of murder plotting...

The Two Jakes reminded of such great detective films like: Maltese Falcon (1941), Harper (1966), Marlowe (1969), and L.A. Confidential (1997).",1453593600,,1152,5.155913978494624

6167290,5,B00HJRVWM2,"A classic mystery with a shocking surprise twist. Great characters, played by very gifted actors, who really click together. Directed only as a European director of the statue of Roman Polanski can do. This is Chinatown, where nothing is really as it appears. Packaged together with it's sequel, that brings it up to date with an intriguing new mystery included. One of Jack Nicholson's greatest roles in two movies. Enjoy.",1436400000,3,423,5.057142857142857

6167295,4,B00HJRVWM2,"One of the best detective stories every made.... NIcholson and Dunaway were in their prime.... great story... and the sequel which was also great.... about the past creeping back up on you... instead of the usual drugs or terrorists this was a somewhat true story about fights over water and oil rights... corrupt cops, corrupt politicians, the influence of the wealthy.... both movies have great characterization and solid mysteries that will keep you guessing right up to the end.  Set in L.A., first pre-WWII, the second in the 1950's.  Love those cars....",1424649600,8,559,5.065217391304348

8633146,4,B00HJRVWM2,"The Two Jakes does not compare to Chinatown, but it was meant to be part of a trilogy of films based on LAs history: the 1st part focused on water and land; the 2nd on oil, the 3rd was to be on cars and pollution(never got made due to the 2nds poor showing at the box office). TTJ draws from Chinatown and there are characters that connect both films together, but you have to judge the movie on its own merits. And Chinatown was a one-off, where director, writer and actor came together to make it great. Chinatown was in the pre-war period, this was set in the post-war 40s. It was one of the themes of Chinatown that there was a quality of dj vu in everything that happened. That investigator Jake Gittes (Nicholson) had been through this scenario before, and was doomed to re-enact it in the Chinatown of his mind. But the tragedy that once afflicted the characters was doomed to be re-enacted by the major production personnel. The Two Jakes was a film at which they had two goes.

The 1st attempt in 1984/5 with Robert Evans, Robert Towne and Jack Nicholson,collapsed in personal acrimony-centred on Evans ill-fated attempt to make a come -back as an actor, playing the 2nd Jake. Paramount too had 2nd thoughts. The project was only revived 4 years later, with the box-office clout of Nicholson as both star and director.  The film is an auteur piece, but with the wrong auteur. Nicholsons direction puts a good-looking movie together, with well-crafted physical feel to it, with good period details, set costumes and cars. There is good camera work, everything is moving fluidly on the surface, but he doesnt make the elements underneath click. Scenes don't move smoothly from one to the next, they seem to collide and cancel each other out. He shows no talent for story telling. Jake seems more secure and successful (even smug and smarmy), but is personally all at sea. There is something of the clown about Gittes, victimised by the (plentiful) women in his life, and played by Nicholson, in an unflatteringly wide 40s look, as a man always on the point of being knocked sideways(as he is by one explosion and three earthquakes in the movie).

Harvey Keitel is watchable, turning from badass, but adding shading and vulnerability to his role: we watch him come to terms with himself and the central conceit of his life. Meg Tilly and Madeleine Stowe make a good fist of their roles. But the script has certain parallels with Townes own directed effort Tequila Sunrise, doodling as an exercise in male bonding- the same over awe for its own script, while building up no interest in the characters or tension in plot. The two Jakes finally triumphing over the miasma of the past, and the regimen of femmes fatales, to land in each others arms. Van Dyke and Jo Stafford provide a good soundtrack. We learn the past is never past helped by Zsigmonds cinematography. Gittes remains deeply hurt by the murder of Faye Dunaway's Evelyn Mulray in Chinatown.",1509408000,,2958,4.695568400770713

8633148,4,B00HJRVWM2,"I liked Chinatown more than The Two Jakes.  Chinatown is definitely a classic, has a great cast (Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston) and the pace and plot are well crafted.  Also it was directed by Roman Polanski and he actually appears in one scene.  I have viewed this movie before and it's as good as I remembered.  I'm glad that I added it to my collection.  The Two Jakes is a sequel to Chinatown so it's interesting from that stand point but I wouldn't have bought it alone.",1501200000,2,487,4.426966292134831
