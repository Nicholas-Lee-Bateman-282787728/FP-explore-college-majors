7846196,5,630343374X,"Great actors like Robert Duval, James Earl Jones, Fredrick Forrest and many more do Horton Foote's films because they love them, and get paid very little. Money is not the deal here. These films unveil the dialog of an acute intuition of the ins and outs of daily lives of people who could've been next door to you in those simpler times. Simple, yet unearthing these rivetting, inner complex scenarios.
And in my books this is Horton's finest.
Must also see Road to Bountiful.
You can see Horton's influence on Billy Bob Thornton at the time of his writing ""Slingblade""
This is near the end of Brad Davis' life.  His performance is beautiful.",1239580800,9,643,4.6902654867256635
