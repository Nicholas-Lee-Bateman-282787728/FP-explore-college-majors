8335865,5,B001QIVEP0,"Dennis Rodman, who was the Bulls best player, helps a bunch of midgets play basketball. Some so-called ""film critics"" may have scoffed at such a notion as being the drunken ramblings of a schizophrenic. Don't listen to those sour grapes! This is cinema at its finest!

Rodman should have gotten the Oscar for best actor. The director as well. And of course the midgets should have gotten miniature awards as well. Something on a smaller level like an Emmy or Grammy.",1395360000,,466,4.753086419753086
8335866,1,B001QIVEP0,"I was in a real low point in my life when I decided one fateful day to rent this off of youtube! it took a few minutes but once my eyes crossed, I zoned out, blood poured out of my eyes, and my bowels released, I found the genius in Valerio's directing/producing/writing/composing style. Jesus came to me and helped me turn my life around. I'm now volunteering at the local YMCA teaching other underprivilaged ""little-people"" how to meet their very own Dennis Rodman. God bless you Valerio Zanoli. Bless you.",1370217600,,508,4.655555555555556
8335867,1,B001QIVEP0,"Funny this got nothing but good reviews. One of the worst movies i have seen in a while. I like the Worm and realize hes no actor, but this was just garbage. If you need a feel good movie that bad there are plenty others out there.

This one misses on all cylinders.",1362268800,,266,4.018867924528302
8335868,5,B001QIVEP0,"At first, I thought this was going to be a SHORT film.  But then I did a LITTLE research and came to find out it was much more SIZABLE.  I guess, in the end, I was the one selling it SHORT.",1303344000,9,189,3.5853658536585367
8335869,4,B001QIVEP0,"An inspiring tale, full of great music and some funny moments. The messages here: believe in yourself, follow your dreams, and never give up.

Four dwarf men want to raise money for the son of one of the men to go to college, so they form a basketball team and get Dennis Rodman to join them. Rodman's agent (the funny Richard Portnow) encourages them, as it will improve his image and make them money. (Though of course he's not above exploiting the dwarfs for an embarrassing ad endorsement!)

There's a cow-obsessed gal from Paris (...Texas); the dwarf waitress who befriends the smallest of them, Chevy ; his Worm-ness himself, and Chevy, (Gabriel Pimental)who thinks a risky limb-lengthening operation would help him. Can this ragtag team of little guys win?

Fast paced action and catchy music enlivens the story, which is suitable for all ages.",1241308800,3,851,4.895833333333333
