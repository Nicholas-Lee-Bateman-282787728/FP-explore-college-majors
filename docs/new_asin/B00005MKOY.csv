7945821,5,B00005MKOY,"I must disagree with the other reviewers (who appear to be biased and shockingly prejudiced!) the only other comparable productions I can think of is the Hockney stage production for Glyndebourne, marred by poor recording and in places singing, also available on dvd, and a live performance I went to at the Aix en provence festival with Daniel Harding, again marred by poor some singing and not as interesting.
You can have large scale, overly sweet and sentimental, rather odd, jazzed up, modern approaches - it all works for some people out there, and there is room for everybody in Mozart's universe - but for small scale and true to its original, commedia de l'arte/singspiel roots, I would select this without hestitation. Wonderful!

On the singing: Deon van der Walt in his all too tragically brief career, has left us with some great performances on disc and DVD. Here he sings his heart out and is reminiscent in attack, tone and phrasing of Wunderlich, which is praise enough. It is the best sung Tamino on film. He is a convincing actor too. The Pamina of Ulrike Sonntag displays these virtues also and gains in strength as she builds towards her central aria of loss and desolation. This is as good as any I have seen on stage. The Papageno of Thomas Mohr is likeable and funny, and again his set piece arias are as well executed and pointed as any on disc. He does not appear TOO refined, TOO intelligent or TOO boisterous and his voice is not TOO beautiful. Other Papagenos can be over acted and eventually grate, but Thomas Mohr has struck just the right balance here I think. Having heard Cornelius
Hauptmann in this role live, I can't deny he is miscast and simply does not have the weight in the bottom register to project the role of Sarasto. The Queen of the Night in Andrea Frei is a tad shakey in the slow intros but when she starts singing coloratura it is up there with best..and all the while negotiating some pretty eye-catching scenery, costumes and staging. It is a good performance by her. The Papagena of Patricia Rozario needs more work or was under the weather on this occasion. The Monostatos is right nasty and totally in character! Well sung too.
The stage direction is superior to anything I have seen on disc or live. The camera work sets the scene by panning the interior of this tiny ducal theatre, pauses for the performance to start, focusing on the minimalist stage, but from the first entrance of Tamino this production flies!
This is the first time I have ever experienced this opera as such an overall success, and as a production I think Mozart himself would have enjoyed. Anyway, off to Valencia in April 2013 to sample another production! Whether that's a good or bad thing, Die Zauberflote has become the classical equivalent of the Sound of Music, it seems to be on EVERYWHERE! If only Mozart could have enjoyed those royalties...

I believe if you love this opera you will enjoy this version. Please ignore the rather ignorant and prejudiced accusations, hilariously generalised in the tradition of the standard bigot, accusing the participants of ""central European racism"" posted on Amazon.com by one reviewer. It is offensive.
Please also ignore the rather sniffy, cool reviews you might find elsewhere, that hold unrealistic expectations of a small scale live production from a southern German music festival. Above all this production has honoured the original format, scale and intentions I believe of the composer.

And this is great fun...BUY IT!",1361059200,2,3505,4.8092868988391375
7945822,2,B00005MKOY,"Pretty much bottom of the heap for available productions of The Magic Flute. The Behrens review is right on target in most respects, although I can't think why he gave it 4 stars. Average singing, racism (typical, however for Europeans in 1992, who still thought racist images were cute - they are just getting it now), boring production, not really modern or post-modern, just simple-minded. My sympathy to all the people who worked hard under poor management. Nevertheless, it's only for those whose curiosity gets the better of them.",1271116800,4,536,5.033707865168539
7945823,1,B00005MKOY,"Unimpressive as to the quality of this musical presentation, and it is not staged as I would  have expected. I wanted to learn more about this opera, having neglected to add it to my collection.  From this version, I did not get a picture of what Mozart must have had intended. Maybe I should have read the description better. Having searched for a desirable version, I passed over the Met's presentation. More expensive is not necessarily better.  Note that Amazon recommends ordering these two together.  What I experienced tells me why they recommend buying two versions of the same opera.  I missed getting a discounted price.  Do order both, if you order this one.",1139616000,7,669,4.824561403508772
7945824,4,B00005MKOY,"The 1992 production of <Die Zauberflote>, now available on ArtHaus DVD, performed by cast, chorus and orchestra of the Ludwigsburger Festspiele under Wolfgang Gonnenwein, is a good example of the current European minimalism that has taken over too many productions in opera houses. The entire work is performed on a white slab with occasionally colorful drapes along the back and some two-dimensional cutouts (the serpent, a branch to receive Papageno's rope) to relieve the visual monotony.
 The Three Women are dressed spectacularly and sexily in red body stockings with half blue gowns, and when the Queen of the Night (Andrea Frei) first appears in a hemispherical gown she seems to emerge from the backdrop of stars. Tamino (Deon van der Walt), for once, is dressed in a vaguely Japanese fashion as the text demands; but Papageno (Thomas Mohr) looks like a cross between a carpenter and Big Bird. And those ubiquitous Three Boys simply look silly and ill at ease in their white shorts, beach hats, and wings. Monostros (Kevin Conners) and his minions, in Little Black Sambo outfits, would never be allowed on a more Politically Correct stage; while the chorus are uniformly bald and dressed in a sort of Indian mode, Sorastro (Cornelius Hauptmann) looking particularly unimposing. Paminia (Ulrike Sonntag) does not look a young girl and is made to wear an unbecoming gown throughout.
 None of the singing is especially top notch, and the audience seems not to know when to applaud, being merely polite for the most part when they do. The two ordeals by Fire and Water are very poorly handled (as they usually are) , the animals responding to the flute very well done, and in general the scenes with the Three Women seem to come off the best. Perhaps the more traditional version from the Metropolitan would be a better introduction to this work; but this one certainly does have its moments.
 It also has German subtitles for those who want to see exactly what is being sung, as well as English, French and Chinese....",995587200,40,2023,4.909356725146199
