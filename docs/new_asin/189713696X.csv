My mother sent them to us from the UK about 3 years ago so I'm glad to be able to get them in USA now. We have most of the series and this is actually our second copy of this one as the first one was used so much it got scratched to badly! It is from a British perspective (which i don't mind as I grew up there), which is good for the kids to see farming in other countries. The little songs are catchy and not too annoying. The accompanying books are wonderful too! We have the John Deere DVD too and they are similar although it feels like Tractor Ted is more of a story and a day in the life of. Great healthy entertainment for busy farming kids, and girls will like it too!!!",1397779200,,773,3.9615384615384617
