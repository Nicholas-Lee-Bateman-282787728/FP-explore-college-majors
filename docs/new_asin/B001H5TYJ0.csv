8307873,1,B001H5TYJ0,"I have been looking for this movie for some time. I was happy when i found it,Recieved in less than a week .Happy about that,But the movie was in very poor condition. I mean the movie itself. It was all fuzzy and seamed to be in Black and white. First problem with amazon. Been ordering movies for a while now. I guess I will keep looking for another one. Thanks for nothing.",1299715200,,375,4.222222222222222
8307874,1,B001H5TYJ0,"The two-part miniseries ""Deceptions"" which I taped from TV some time ago ran for 180 minutes.  I have no idea how long ""Anastasia"" is but it definitely takes up more than 8 minutes.  That means that both pieces have to be cut horribly.  Also, the description of ""Anastasia"" talks about Catherine the Great who has nothing to do with that story.
I was tempted to order this combination just for the ""Deceptions"" part, but not under these circumstances.",1266624000,2,451,4.756410256410256
8307875,3,B001H5TYJ0,"I reviewed as good because of a fast delivery. I would be better if Anastasia was as pictured. When playing, it plays as a cartoon. Also, the DVD on plays in players that are specially formated.",1255046400,,194,4.416666666666667
