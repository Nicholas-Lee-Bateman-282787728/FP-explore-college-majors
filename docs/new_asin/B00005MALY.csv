even these type of films need chemistry between leading actors",1218412800,,118,5.2631578947368425
7945093,5,B00005MALY,"It was with some trepidation that I purchased this film. My experience of this genre was directed mainly through the American market. The action came thick and fast, excuse the play on words. I have a quite large collection of this style, all in DVD and I can say the quality was phenominal. I was able to feeze frame on the action without any of the distortion normally experienced with VHS.
The boys are all good looking and obviously work out, I would love to know where their gym is!!
To finish I would like to offer my services as body oiler to Bruce the lead actor.",1000857600,12,571,4.345794392523365
