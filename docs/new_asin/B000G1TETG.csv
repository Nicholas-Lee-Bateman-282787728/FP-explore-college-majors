2598302,5,B000G1TETG,"The John Deere videos are a great alternative to mainstream shows/movies. This is all tractors - combines, harvesters, plows, skid steers and so forth.  And it's real human beings ... nothing animated. The jingle is a bit hokey and the slant is somewhat on the conservative side (how couldn't it be, with tractors?); overall I recommend this for kids interested in the farming life.",1186704000,,382,4.96875
2598303,4,B000G1TETG,"A friend of ours gave us 'All About John Deere for Kids Vol I' some time ago. Their 6 year old had out-grown it and our two year old boy was just getting into TV and DVDs. We're not farmers and are no way mechanically minded at all but our son seems to have picked up an inetrest in trucks & tractors from somwhere (is it genetic?). Anyway, he actually wore out that DVD playing it so much (mis-handling more-like!). In searching for a replacement, I came across the 4x DVD set on Amazon and bought it.

These DVDs are great fun. They appeal very much to the 2-4 year demographic and have great visuals. They also seem to improve vocabulary (my two year old  now knows the diference between excavators, tractors etc.). For an insight into a particular way of life and enough big machines to keep any young boy happy, I can recommend this series. Knocked off a star for the set being a tad repeditive and advertising merchandise on later discs.",1183420800,11,943,4.413793103448276
2598304,5,B000G1TETG,My son just turned one and he has been watching these John Deere videos for a couple months now and he loves them.  He will bring me the DVD and he gets so excited when it first comes one.  There is no interrupting him during these videos.,1173916800,3,239,4.0638297872340425
2598305,5,B000G1TETG,"Yes girls like John Deere! My 2 y/o daughter is a very girly girl and she loves watching these movies with her twin brother and older brother.

As a Mom, I appreciate that it's interesting to watch (not annoying) it's fast paced, sometimes silly, has plenty of easy to remember songs and best of all, it shows kids not much older than mine having fun with John Deere.",1170115200,6,367,4.397058823529412
2598306,5,B000G1TETG,"We have all four DVDs and my son, who is three, loves them (and my husband, too!)! He knows all the tractor models, names, the details of the tractors and more!  He will watch these John Deere DVDs over any disney cartoon any day.",1169942400,2,230,4.2272727272727275
2598307,5,B000G1TETG,Another great video from John Deere.  My son loves these videos.  He loves this one too.,1168300800,,88,4.4375
2598308,5,B000G1TETG,"Unfortunately, when I was buying them I had to buy them one at a time.  All four dvds hold the attention of my son, who began watching them before he was two and continues to watch them at 3+.  They are interesting and even parents can tolerate them, unlike many of the silly kiddie dvds that are out there.  While they aren't directly ""educational"" in the traditional sense, my kid learns a lot from them.  He can distinguish between all kinds of farm and heavy equipment and knows what they are used for.  I had no idea there was a machine called a fellerbuncher.  These dvds are much more fun for Dad than ABC's, purple critters and blue dogs.

If you have a young son, I highly recommend this set.  You won't be disappointed.  (Girls may like them too, but I wouldn't know anything about that.)",1168300800,28,798,4.410958904109589
2598309,5,B000G1TETG,"My toddler son has all of the dvds in the series.  They are his favorite videos in the world and continue to hold his attention after many viewings.  I'm not a big fan of sticking a kid in front of a TV, but every parent knows that once in a while something is needed to keep him busy so you can get something done.  This one does the trick EVERY TIME.  This video is referred to by my son as ""the one with the John Deere chainsaw in it.""  I enjoy watching the series myself, unlike many of the intolerable kiddie videos with their stupid characters and insane music.

I agree with another commenter that this one does not have as much equipment in it as the others.  As for the cover of the DVD, we never look at it.",1168300800,3,717,4.078571428571428
2598310,2,B000G1TETG,"We own JD for kids vol 1 & 2 and love to watch them with our 3 YO son so this Christmas we gave him vol 3 & 4 and were very disappointed with both but especially vol 4. There is a large picture of a combine plus a cotton stripper on the front cover. Unfortunatly, neither appear in this video!! There is probably less than 5% of the DVD that is modern farm equipment. It is primarily about a two cylinder expo and a JD train/miniature farm scene. Neither of which I dislike but was just very disappointed that there was such a miniscule amount of modern farm equipment. The cover picture is misleading.",1167350400,8,602,4.243478260869566

He could watch these John Deere DVDs all day. He loves the music. I find it slightly irritating but ignorable. These have saved my sanity. I bought a DVD player just for the John Deere videos.

2598443,5,B000G1TETG,"My 4 y/o son LOVES John Deere.  When he was younger (when he turned 1) we got the John Deere: Fun on The Farm collection (which is also great!) for him, but now that he's a little older we've been turning to YouTube for video clips of tractors in the fields.  We bought this collection and he really enjoys them!!!!  Bonus-we don't have to wait between each video clip to upload like we did with YouTube...just pop in a DVD and be content for 45mins.  In my opinion the Fun on the Farm is more cartoon-ish learning and this one seems more like watching live action in the fields while still learning.  Songs are great and catchy...son likes to get up and dance for the songs.  I'm also happy that its 4 DVDs in one case.",1418947200,3,720,4.257352941176471
