7794885,4,0979150922,"This DVD is part of a series by John Friend. It was taped live at a workshop. The routine is a good workout and I liked the tone and attitude of John Friend. He is colloquial and down to earth, with a good sense of humour. Like the other DVDs in the series, it's probably too narrowly focused to be of use for regular practice, but it's a good source to learn a bit about the principles behind anusara yoga (Friend's ""branch"" of yoga).",1259020800,5,435,4.190476190476191
7794886,4,0979150922,"This is the 2nd of 4 DVDs. If you are looking for a beginner DVD, buy the first DVD ""Laxshmi rocks me"". If you want to master more advanced poses...well..before you do...open up those hips!

As 30-something year old dude, I despise hip openers. But I realize for me to get into and maintain certain advanced poses...well, I got to do it. While the instructions on this DVD is not what I would call a traditional yoga class, the poses and the needed alignment to get into them will be needed for more advanced poses that show up in later DVDs (or even in your more advanced classes)

While the first DVD may have sweating....this one has you stretched and opened more than you will want to remember! :)

Not a bad DVD...my only complaint (and thus the lack of the fifth star) is that  the poses were not properly demo-ed. John does talk you through the asanas, but there were moments where I wished the camera was on Emily, who  is introduced at the beginning of the DVD as somebody who would be there for demo purposes. Instead the camera focuses on John while he talks. Huge bummer. What's the point of having somebody do demos if the camera isn't even on her for more advanced poses?  The first couple of times of watching this DVD, it may take 2 hours to complete the asanas -- mainly because I found myself pausing, watching, and then  rewinding so I can listen and figure out the pose myself.",1240099200,22,1397,4.412451361867705
7794887,3,0979150922,"I expected a Yoga routine, something I could do daily. The description of the CD wasn't complete. Do you know one of his that would give the complete sun salutation?",1229904000,4,165,4.533333333333333
7794888,5,0979150922,"I have been taking yoga with teachers who follow the Anusara method. The video is a tape of John Friend teaching a large class. Although he does not demonstrate the postures himself, he does talk through them and the tape shows participants following the instructions. He talks gently a lot about the prana and how the postures help the body's energy. About half way through, there is a brief meditation break. The pace is slow, but not too slow. The DVD provides the ""sacred space"" aspect of yoga; it is not just a series of postures. Participating is just like being part of the class.",1199491200,26,587,4.6
7794889,4,0979150922,I enjoy this video he has a wonderful perspective on energy and flow.  Would like to take a class in person..this is the next best thing.,1194566400,6,137,4.269230769230769
