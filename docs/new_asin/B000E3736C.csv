8104882,5,B000E3736C,"So happy with the DVD of the original series. . .A & E America's Palaces - Equestrians. . . it has a lot more to do with the splendid homes in Virginia and Tennessee architecturally and the families who built these homes than with the horses but you still learn a good deal about the history of some of the lineage and breeding of horses. . . some whose bloodlines carry over to racing greats, i.e. Secretariat, etc.  Very happy with the DVD and have now looked at it several times.  Thank you.",1403136000,,494,4.301075268817204
8104883,1,B000E3736C,Having read as much about the dvd as was available I looked forward to watching it--great dissappointment!! It was for Architectural Students NOT a grand tour of Americas finest stables and equestrian facilities as I expected but a rather dry presentation of the houses and their history with rather tenuous links to the horse world.,1259280000,2,333,5.072727272727272
