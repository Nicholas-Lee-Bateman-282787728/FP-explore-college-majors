1928183,5,B0000DZ3EG,As a christian and mother of 11 I am very strict with what I get movie-wise. We don't have cable or an antenna or dish and only watch carefully chosen movies. I had never even heard of this movie and came across it accidentally. Am I ever glad I did. It was one of the most wonderfull heartwarming films I have ever seen. It is sweet and wholesome in a way that does not at all come across as cloying. Go and get it now! You won't be sorry!,1078963200,2,440,3.955056179775281
1928184,1,B0000DZ3EG,"Sorry, Disney Home Video.  If you won't release DVDs with their appropriate widescreen aspect ratio, I won't be buying them.
""Follow Me, Boys"" is a good film, but you've given it a very poor DVD release by including only a pan & scan version.
I would have thought you might have learned from your mistake with ""The Absent-Minded Professor"", which you went back and corrected.
At a minimum, you could release both pan & scan AND widescreen on the same DVD or DVD set...
PLEASE show some respect for your company's considerable film heritage.",1076716800,27,540,4.74468085106383
1928185,5,B0000DZ3EG,"One of Disney's greatest classics, FOLLOW ME, BOYS! goes well beyond its theme about Boy Scouting in its early days in America.  It's a story of love and of priorities when a disenchanted band member studying law, Lemuel Siddons, decides to get back to the basics in rural America.  In the process he finds love and provides a sterling example to the  town's boys.

This film also includes terrific performances by some Hollywood's who's who including the great Fred MacMurray (MY THREE SONS) as Lemuel Siddons, the would-be lawyer who settles for shopkeeping and leading the local scout troop, Vera Miles (THE SEARCHERS) as Vida Downey, the bank secretary who supports Siddons, falls in love with him and ultimately becomes his wife, Kurt Russell (MIRACLE) in one of his first films as Whitey, the tough who is adopted by Lem and Vida and becomes a boy-leader in the troop and finally a soldier and doctor. Look for a cameo by a bona fide screen legend, Lillian Gish as one of the town's business leaders Hetty Seibert.

Whether you've been a scout, know one or have had nothing to do with scouting FOLLOW ME, BOYS!  Tracks the development of the troop and their experiences that bond them together.  One of Siddon's later troops even captures a tank.

Yes, it's squeaky clean but who can't use a dose of Disney fantasy now and again.

1928186,5,B0000DZ3EG,"I got my DVD and I love it.

Great Movie

1928187,5,B0000DZ3EG,"Likely a lot of kids will not relate to this film, because this sort of family film is rarely made these days.  Fred MacMurry (My Three Sons) decides three sons is not enough and takes on a whole troop of them - other peoples as he becomes a reluctant scoutmaster.  Slowly he throws himself into the idea.  As I say, kids my not warm to this Baden-Powell wholesomeness, but who knows, they might surprise you.  A very young Kurt Russell plays tough boy that MacMurry wins over.
Interesting point: at the end when you see his ""boys"" all grown up, take note of William Reynolds as Hoodoo Henderson as a Man  (FBI, The Thing That Couldn't Die).  He played MacMurray's son in There's Always Tomorrow (1956).",1074038400,28,703,4.5396825396825395
1928188,5,B0000DZ3EG,"This movie has been the epitomy of millions of Boy Scouts and the enjoyable moments shared by Boys and Parents and the scout organization.  It is motivating in that it encourages children to gain Respect and learn about life.  The touching ending is especially good when they all get together and finally give Fred McMurray his long sought after law degree, which he had been putting off all his life for the love of the scouts and their activities.",1074038400,2,449,4.670886075949367
1928189,4,B0000DZ3EG,"For every human hobby, there will eventually be made a film. For fighter pilots, there's ""Top Gun."" For pee-wee hockey players, there's ""The Mighty Ducks."" For Boy Scouts, there's ""Follow Me, Boys!"" Of course you can appreciate and enjoy this movie if you're not a scout or scouter, but let's not fool ourselves about the intended audience here.
--
This film is the epitome of old-school Boy Scouting. Every traditionalist Scouter pines for the days when the boys didn't have to be back from the campout early for soccer practice. Every new scoutmaster wants to be the square-jawed, campaign hat-wearing, all-American scoutmaster of Norman Rockwell paintings. You'll never pull it off if you haven't seen this film.
In ""Follow Me Boys!"" Fred Macmurray goes from reluctant scoutmaster to super-scoutmaster, teaching boys to be men, year after year. His boys actually sing. They sing! What traditionalist scoutmaster hasn't given up years ago trying to get the boys to sing around the campfire or on the trail? The Scout program of ""Follow me, boys!"" is the antidote to the 1980's scouting movement that gave us nasty-colored patches and ball caps. It's the bridge between the scouts of today, and the scouts of 97 years ago.
If you ever want to be a great scouter, see this film, and read up on Baden-Powell. Make sure your boys know what he did at Mafeking. Make sure they know that their uniforms are based on the South African Constabulary. Make sure they stand up straight when they recite the Oath and Law. Get them off the trail occasionally. Get them to sing, loud and proud.
But you'll have to see ""Follow me, Boys!"" I don't know if it will work on the boys anymore, but it worked on me when I was a Tenderfoot.",1072915200,3,1718,4.749163879598663
1928190,5,B0000DZ3EG,"If you are in scouts this movie is perfect for you, if not, you will want to be involved after seeing it.  This movie will take you through the ups and the downs of scouting.  You will laugh and you might even cry.  The message is very clear about how scouting can play a role in your community with your youth.  Fred MacMurray brings out the role of scoutmaster perfectly.",1072396800,3,373,4.285714285714286

The casting at the time represented some of the finest actors and actresses available, and their casting and touching performances brought moist eyes to me, my wife, and I daresay a quiet tone to even our ten year old son. The movie is long, but is so well paced and full of good story that you are still disappointed when it ends. It not only includes great acting, but some wonderful songs. Those who consider themselves too sophisticated or too adult to enjoy this movie might be surprised. This is a great adult movie, a great date night movie, or a great family night movie.

It does not shrink away from hard problems, nor does it sugar-coat the story, despite the main character's chery and positive attitude. And Kurt Russel brings some real pathos to his character as a lonely boy with a chip on his shoulder due to his shame about having an alcoholic father (the dad is the one true stereotype in the movie of the ""Irish sot""). Both my wife and 10 yr. old son really enjoyed it (he's been in Cub Scouts for a while so he really liked all the adventures).",1462406400,3,622,4.191666666666666

1928602,5,B0000DZ3EG,No nudity or potty mouthing from hell. Doesn't get any better than this. Too bad hollywood can't make a movie today without nudity and cussing in it. Many good movies in the last 20 years that could have been great without the garbage in it. A good example is One Fine Day. The movie was doing fine with no nudity or cussing and had some fun parts for the children in your family to watch from the kids that were in the movie then soon as the kids miss the boat George Clooney with EXTREMELY  GREAT PASSION says with a very loud voice GOD DAMMIT two times and totally ruined it for me. Why ignorant retarded hollywood directors think porn and potty mouths have to be in about every film to make it good is beyond me. The 30's thru 60's movies made great movies left & right without that garbage in it and people loved it. Guess hollywood is filled with nothing but filthy minded directors today.

Kurt Russell  was the perfect little terror which put Mr. MacMurray to the test. I may be in a time warp, but this movie did have good morals- showing that  love, rules, and understanding really can change a boy's life.

1928801,1,B0000DZ3EG,"I have never written a review in my life, but people need to know--this show is NOT for young children.  No one here said so and that is a shame because my family did not know before viewing it.  There is a scene or two with the boy's very alcoholic dad that is disturbing.  His father is a drunkard and a bum and the shame and anger the boy exhibits because of it is very disturbing.  The relationship between the scout master and this boy is not developed enough to mend the sorrow of it.  He just shows up later as a mature, healthy adult.  Nice concept, but how did it happen?  That would have given the show more meaning.  The boy is a thief, the drunkard dies, the store owner dies, the wife is infertile, and the ending has more bummer news--so much tragedy.  The show is just not worth it.  It is choppy and goes from scene to scene, thing to thing with no continuity.  I found myself seeing them as actors and not a movie.  The timeline (and show) is too long and not believable.  That being said, I liked the scout scenes a lot, but this show was too serious and had a heavy and downer feeling.

1928995,4,B0000DZ3EG,"I had not heard of this movie, until my son came back from a scout camp raving about it.  We watched it as a family and really enjoyed it.  The language is a bit dated, but the story is engaging, and it makes for a great family movie- especially if you have a child in scouts.  Funny to see a young Kurt Russell so prominently featured in his Disney days.

The only gripe I would make is that it too closely parallels 'it's a wonderful life.'  However, if you're going to clone major elements of a movie- that's a good one to go with.  There are idealized characters and flawed ones, sending a timeless message of making good choices and treating others well.  I'm no expert, but I'd say it is probably appropriate for those older than 9.  There are also some good points for families to discuss (e.g., character flaws, and how closely children should be supervised).

Probably not a movie many non-scouting families will turn to- but those with scouts (or former scouts) will be pleased.",1412467200,,988,4.50561797752809

My younger boys find some of the spots slow (compared to the frenetic modern editing style they are accustomed to) but everyone in the family loves to sing ""Follow Me Boys!""

(chorus):
Follow me boys, follow me,
When you think you're really beat
That's the time to lift your feet,
And follow me boys, follow me,
Pick'em up, put'em down and follow me,
Pick'em up, put'em down pick'em up.
There's a job to do,
There's a fight to win,
Follow me boys, follow me,
And it won't be done till we all pitch in,
Lift your chin with a grin and follow me.

(chorus)

It's a long long climb,
But we've got the will,
Follow me boys, follow me,
When we reach the top
Then it's all down hill,
Till you drop don't stop and follow me.
So the journey's end
Is beyond our sight,
Follow me boys, follow me,
If we do our best
Then we've done alright,
Pack your load, hit the road and follow me.

1929141,5,B0000DZ3EG,I really enjoyed the message of this movie. The entire community was concerned about the children of the town. This is something we don't see much of any more. The characters showed that taking the time to show a little attention to the children of the community brought about a brighter future for the entire town. Volunteering to help our young people will make a difference in all our tomorrows. This movie brought laughter and tears and was a pleasure to watch. I have shared this with my neighbors and they have enjoyed it too.,1402876800,,532,4.610526315789474

1929144,5,B0000DZ3EG,"I believe this was one of Kurt Russell's first movie rolls.  And he is quite excellent in it.  Fred McMurray, with his understated approach is the perfect actor for Lemuel Siddons, a travelling musician who finally puts down roots.  This tender love story spans several decades, but focuses on the first few months.  It shows that small things done with love and kindness turn into very big things, indeed.  It takes time, patience, and love unfeigned to grow rowdy boys into exceptional men.  This is a must have for any family film library.  Get it, watch it, practice it.

Great cast of actors, headed up by the kind & understanding father figure in Fred MacMurray (I live in the same area Fred used to and I can tell you he was the genuine article, just as he is in this movie.) Great story about a man settling his roots in a small town and willing to help out the youth who are bored with nothing to do.  They start a boy scout pack which spans across two decades.  Longer movie than I thought, with a story line that kept going. Fun and serious life moments in this movie, which make it part of growing up as a young man...you can tell the story writers made sure of this. Most of todays teenagers could learn something from this movie; they ought to re-make this film.

I get all the little nuances from both Fred MacMurry and his supporting cast, and the story makes a little more sense to me now.  The shooting style is a bit dated, as is the film stock, but it's still a very solid piece of professional entertainment.

As a former scout I'm kind of proud that Disney made this film.

A good watch.",1392940800,,505,4.070707070707071
1929225,5,B0000DZ3EG,"This was one of the few films I saw in the theater as a small child, and it is one I remembered fondly all my life.

In watching the DVD, it was even better from my adult viewpoint. I've whistled the ""Follow Me Boys"" tune off and on all my life.

The story is told in a series of set pieces, much like the style of ""It's a Wonderful Life"". They hang together so well that you get a true sense of the passage of time within a recognizable framework of the town, and the characters and their lives.

Lem Siddons leaves a band as they pass through a small town. Little does he suspect that when he takes a job in the hardware store it will lead to spending the rest of his life there. He soon becomes involved in the local Boy Scouts as a Scoutmaster, and the focus of the movie is on the lives of his Scouts as they grow and his interaction with them.

You'll end the movie wishing you had grown up in that town, and wishing that Fred MacMurray (or his character Lem Siddons), had been your friend and neighbor.

If you don't shed a tear or two at the end, you're not human.

Highly recommended.",1392336000,3,1093,4.107981220657277

What is a person's worth?  Did they make a change or leave a legacy?  Here is a man that had a dream, that like so many of us, never get to follow through with it.....but he realizes that what he was allowed to do, was even greater.

The Story:
Lem Siddons is part of a traveling band, but his dream is to settle down and become a lawyer.  He impulsively leaves the band, after a brief meeting with a cute gal in this small town.  So, settling down, he finds a job as a stock boy in the town's general store.  Trying to fit in, he volunteers to become scoutmaster of the newly formed Troop 1.  Becoming more and more involved with the scout troop, he finds his plans to become a lawyer being put on the back burner.  However, the good news is that his initially unsuccessful efforts at romancing the woman he first met, eventually bears fruit.  In time, he becomes the general store's owner, married, and a very loved and respected man in the community.  Still, he holds on to his dream, and with a bit of sadness, that never got to finish a law degree and practice that profession.  In the end, the town turns out to show their love and respect, to acknowledge the difference he made in their lives.  He has led a full and rich life.

Sometimes with all the troubles we have in our troops, we forget that the boys that sometimes get dumped off for 'adolescent day care' are actually a tremendous opportunity.  Their parents may lack wisdom in other areas, but they were smart enough to take their boys to you for mentorship, guidance, and growth.

I've seen tremendous success from the boys I've helped over the years - yet I can only aspire to be as great a man as depicted in this simple, dated movie.

1929597,4,B0000DZ3EG,"They honestly do not make 'em like this anymore.

Part of that is understandable though - the world of open spaces and innocent small towns are long gone, buried under ugly rolling concrete pavers, the internet, ass-fattening video games, embarrassing social media, and a seemingly endless supply of really scary mental cases. Sad.

One of my all-time Disney favorites, starring a man that I've come to understand was so much more complex than I could've ever imagined - Fred MacMurray. It took many, many years to come to grips with who he was, not just on screen, but off it as well. But those on-screen moments were oh so special. The man was just about as good as it got when he took on the sweet and funny roles.

In this production it's 1930 and Fred plays Lemuel Siddons - Lem for short. A world weary traveler who, through pure happenstance, stumbles into the small town of Hickory. Having spent his entire life on the move, he knows this is the place where he'll put down roots - settle down; maybe find someone special.

Turns out that someone is Ms. Vida Downey, played by the beautiful Vera Miles. A loan clerk at the town bank who rebuffs the newcomer as she's already involved with the Vice-President of the bank. But there's a sweetness and a genuine kindness to Lem that she slowly begins to appreciate, and eventually, love.

What follows is the passage of twenty years as one man lives a seemingly insignificant existence working as an assistant shop keeper in a small forgettable town. But the critical differences he makes in that tiny, but crucial, role as scout leader to a bunch of young knuckleheads changes everything. Boys that, with the right influence, grow up to be good men and eventually husbands, fathers and contributing citizens. It's not always about money or prestige - and this movie presents the acts of one man who lives a humble but productive life.

About as far from an adult movie as one can get and still feature adults in the lead roles. For me, this stands amongst some of the best that Disney produced during it's heyday of live-action films while Walt was still alive.

Long a favorite and one that I hope all families, but especially ones with boys, will sit down to watch together. Of course it wasn't always like this, and remembrance has a way of twisting, albeit pleasantly; rounding off the rougher edges of the past. But films like this can and should inspire people, to make an attempt to strive for Lem's kindness, personal sacrifice, and sense of community.

A Couple Of Movie Notes:

- I was mildly disappointed that the Amazon.com download version presents the cropped pan-n-scan version of this wonderful film. It's not a huge issue, but it does seem silly given the source material can, and ought to, be readily available in the original widescreen presentation.

-  Can you imagine Kurt Russell ever being this young? Hard to believe he would have a nearly 60-year career. A true survivor, more so given that he exited the somewhat infamous Disney production mill. Very, very few can make that claim even to this day. For myself, the amazing days of Snake Plissken were yet to come. <g>",1329696000,3,3149,4.696914700544465

1929620,4,B0000DZ3EG,"Lemuel ""Lem"" Siddons, played by the late great Fred McMurray (I grew up watching Fred on ""My Three Sons""; note that this movie was made in 1966 during the original run of ""My Three Sons""), stops in the small town of Hickory and decides that perhaps this is the town for him.  It takes Lem little time to fall in love with local hottie Vida Downy, played by beautiful Vera Miles, who has appeared in more than 150 films.

In order to impress Vida, Lem volunteers to be the first scoutmaster in Hickory.  Lem turns out to be the perfect scoutmaster as he is patient, kind and empathetic.  Lem quickly figures out how to motivate the boys and encourage them to be good scouts.  On the other hand, Lem does less well when it comes to his love life, and he manages to stumble a bit with respect to Vida.  Fortunately, for Lem, Vida is nearly as patient and understanding as Lem.

Lem is a rookie scoutmaster, but his heart is in the right place and he works hard to become a better scoutmaster.  The next thing you know, several generations of Hickory boys have had Lem as a scoutmaster and Lem is one of the most respected people in town.

While Fred McMurray brings a lot to this movie, Lem's boys make the film complete.  The boys get a lot of screen time and show us what it meant to be a boy and a Boy Scout in the 1930's and 1940's.  The boys camp and try hard to be helpful.  Perhaps one of the best aspects of the movie is that it reminds us what scouting was like when scouts went for hikes, camped and built fires.

Kurt Russell plays one of Lem's boys, Whitey.  Russell's career was just kicking off.  He had appeared in quite a few television shows, including a title role, but his movie parts had been relatively minor to this point.  In two more years, Disney would give Russell his first starring role in a movie.

There are several other noteworthy actors in this movie.  The late Charles ""Charlie"" Ruggles, who gave Lem a job as John Everett Hughes when he first came to town, appeared in dozens of movies and television shows.  The late Lillian Gish, who began her career in silent movies, plays wealthy Hetty Siebert who supports Lem in his efforts for the boys.  A surprise comes further down in the credits with Luana Patten, who was one of Disney's earliest contract players.  Luana was a lead in both ""Song of the South"" and ""So Dear to My Heart.""  An actor who appeared without credit is a very young John Larroquette.

Disney movies from the 1960's sometimes received criticism that they were unrealistic in their portrayal of life.  However, this movie does touch on several difficult subjects, including alcoholism.  I applaud Disney for putting these issues before us, even if these issues can be difficult to explain.  Certainly, these issues have not disappeared in the decades since this film first appeared.

Noteworthy is that this movie was final Disney produced movie released before Walt Disney's death.

The DVD has a couple of extras, but the gem is ""Looking Back with Lem's Boys.""  Several of the members of Lem's scouting troop recall making the movie with McMurray and some of the events that happened during the movie.  This extra is worth watching for some of the details about the making of the movie and about how well the boys got along with McMurray.

""Follow Me, Boys!"" has long been one of my favorite Disney movies.  Fred McMurray plays a loveable character who makes a perfect father figure.  Vera Miles is a perfect match for McMurray and keeps pace with him on the screen.  The strong supporting cast is great and has a genuine purpose rather than just being background characters and help make this movie a family gem even for the present generation.  Movies like this one are relatively rare, so you have to have this one if you are a fan of family movies.  Movies about scouting are rarer than good family films, which is yet another reason to have this film.

One side note regarding the aspect ratio.  This DVD has an aspect of 1.33:1, or full screen.  As far as I can tell, Disney made this movie in 1966 for theatrical release, which means that its aspect ratio should be bigger than 1.33:1 (I think the first time this movie appeared on television was in 1981).  That means that the DVD version is pan and scan.  I know some reviewers have rated this film low because of pan and scan rather than using the available aspect.  I must admit to a bit of chagrin regarding the aspect ratio, but the movie is good even with full screen aspect so I am sticking with a four-star rating.  I do think Disney missed broader appeal with pan and scan, but I suspect since widescreen is becoming the format of choice, perhaps on the next release we will get everything that is available.

1929638,5,B0000DZ3EG,"This is an old Disney movie that falls back on the traditional Disney morals and gentleness.

It is a great movie about Scouting. However, if you are looking to show young boys a movie about scouting, this is more than a movie about Scouting.

This story is about a man who plays in a traveling band. The band stops in a town, the man sees a girl and he's in love. So he quits the band, gets a job and tries to make a place in the community for himself and woo the girl of his dreams. One of the things he does is volunteer to lead a troop of Scouts.

Eventually he does get the woman and he continues to lead the troop of Scouts during the rest of his life. During the course of this movie he learns he can't have children, meets a young man with an alcoholic father, and then he ends up adopting that boy when the father dies. While this part of the movie is heart breaking there are some funny times as well. I think we laughed more than we were sad when watching this movie.

Throughout the movie he sings this catchy tune 'Follow Me boys'. After the movie, my children and I sang it over and over. So be warned, it's one that sticks in your head.

Exellent Movie, Worth every penny. Enjoy.",1285286400,,1194,4.129310344827586

1929642,5,B0000DZ3EG,"PLOT: The film begins in the 1930's, as Lem Siddons (Fred MacMurray)  decides to stop touring as a jazz musician and settles down in a small town named Hickory.  He goes to work for a local store. After noticing the boys in town seem to get into a lot of mischief because there is nothing to do, Lem offers to start a local Boy Scout troop. He also has time to fall for a local girl, Vida (Vera Miles). The story takes place over several generations of boys that grow up in the Boy Scouts under Lem's leadership, and he gets to see the positive outcome of his part in developing character and values in their lives. A very heartwarming and humorous story, and a favorite with scout leaders to this day.

TRIVIA & BEHIND THE SCENES: Directed by Norman Tokar, who also directed other films for the Walt Disney Studios including A Tiger Walks, Savage Sam, The Apple Dumpling Gang, Snowball Express, The Boatniks, The Ugly Dachsund, The Cat from Outer Space, and more. Lead actors Fred MacMurray and Vera Miles both appeared in several Disney movies, and were naturals in this film.  This was young Kurt Russel's first big part for Disney in a feature film. Elliot Reed as the banker, and Charlie Ruggles as the general store owner, you may remember him as the girls grandfather that always has peppermints in his pocket in The Parent Trap.  Filmed in Technicolor. Screenplay by Louis Polletier (who wrote the scripts for Big Red, Those Calloways, Smith!, Bayou Boy), and it was supposed to be based on the book by Mackinlay Kantor, ""God and My Country"". But during the pre-production, the story was completely changed, including many changes by Walt himself. It is said that Walt created the part for Lilian Gish himself. The title song was written by the Sherman Brothers. An LP record was put together as a marketing tie-in to the film, and had songs to sing around the campfire, with the intention of selling the record to summer camps, campgrounds, scouts troops, etc. The small town was built in the back-lot at the Disney studios, and the scenes of camping out were shot at the studios well used Golden Oaks Ranch.

There is a whole fleet of wonderful antique cars in the film, 1915 Baker Electric car; 1927 Lincoln Touring Car; 1929 Fords and Chevrolets;  1940, 1946, and 1950 Cadillacs; vintage trucks, a jeep and more. Radio City Music Hall hosted the premier of the film, and it did brisk Christmas box office business.
First released on December 1, 1966.  Walt Disney passed away just two weeks later on December 14. Running time 131 minutes. For a special theatrical re-issue of the movie for 1976, it was edited down by 24 minutes to a new length of 107 minutes.  It aired once on the NBC television on the ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" weekly show, on August 2 & 16, 1982 as a two episode movie. Released to VHS for the first time in 1984. First DVD release was in 2004, but it is not in full widescreen. It is in the longer version though. It would be nice to see both versions to compare, and some extras as well. One of the scenes cut from the film that I would love to see restored at least as an extra is when Fred MacMurray and Vera Miles canoe sinks to the bottom of the water. Great family friendly movie, about a regular guy sacrificing for the good of others.",1264032000,2,3291,4.526936026936027

Definitely a family-friendly film that our children enjoyed watching.

*The only portion which some parents may want to know about ahead of time is that one of the fathers is an alcoholic.

As someone that has been working with boys in scouting for many years (looking forward to many years to come) this is a movie I always keep handy. You can't watch it to many times and it makes a great reward to gather the boys for a movie night and watch their eyes light up. I don't agree that boys may not find it revelant or interesting we watched it last night with 15 boys piled on top of each other in the living room and barely had a peep out of them except when they all sang along with the theme song.

The one that has been close to my heart is Follow Me Boys, It is because of Fred Macmurray from My 3 sons but also a cute blonde haired boy , one of my favorite actors today Kurt Russell. Well Follow Me Boys is about a Man named Lemuel  (Fred) takes on a job in a 5 and 10 small store and settles down in a small town and found love  along with being a Scout master for many years. Not having a child of his own with his wife Vida  . After the sudden death of his father Whitey (Kurt) goes and lives with Lem and Vida.

My favorite movie with Kurt is : Overboard , he stars in it with his long time live in love Goldie Hawn.

The other classic movies  I have watched and enjoyed were : Mister Roberts starring the late great actor Henry Fonda and Father Goose starring Cary Grant.

He gets (marries) the girl, adopts the local tough kid (played by Kurt Russell) and helps all the boys become successful and respected men.

1929710,5,B0000DZ3EG,"This nostalgic tale is one of my favorite Disney live-action offerings.  It begins in 1930, when Lem Siddons (Fred MacMurray), ""out of South Chicago"" and a veteran of the battlefields of France, is travelling with a low-end jazz dance band, Melody Murphy's Collegians (""We're not collegians any more,"" he observes wryly), that takes a pit stop in Hickory, a classic small town probably somewhere in southern Illinois (they hope to get Chicago before night, and there's a ""Clark County"" right next door).  Lem has been nicknamed ""Counsellor"" by his bandmates for the set of law books in his luggage and the correspondence legal course he's always studying; now in his 30's (MacMurray was 58 when he made the film but doesn't look it), he's beginning to feel a need of ""roots.""  When he spots Vida Downey (Vera Miles), secretary and sometime girlfriend of bank president Ralph Hastings (Elliot Reed), and has his attention called to a ""clerk wanted"" sign at John Hughes's (Charlie Ruggles) mercantile, he decides Hickory is the place to put them down.  Within a few weeks, partly in hopes of impressing Vida, he volunteers to serve as scoutmaster if Hickory will form a Boy Scout troop.  Starting out with 15 boys in very much improvised kit, he reaches out (as he was once reached out to) to the town's ""tough kid,"" Whitey (Kurt Russell), whose father (Sean McClory), once a respected plumber, has fallen into drink since the death of his wife, and when Ed's heart gives out from all the bootleg whiskey he's consumed, Lem and Vida, by now married but aware they can't have children of their own, take his son in.  Through a crisis of leadership brought on by Whitey's appointment as patrol leader, an opportunity to shine in court when the troop's patron, town grand dame Hetty Seibert (Lillian Gish), fights nephew Ralph's attempt to have her declared mentally incompetent, and a delightful interlude in which his 1944 troop gets inadvertantly caught in the middle of a wargaming exercise and ends up capturing a tank, he finds not only the roots he sought but rich fulfillment and--without seeking it--a role as a town hero.  When overwork forces him to retire from scoutmastering, he learns just how much Hickory has come to love him and how much influence he has really had (one of his original boys, Hoodoo, has become Governor of the State, while Whitey, after a stint in the Army Medical Corps, is now a town doctor, and Leo an attorney).

Lem's character shows us just how possible it is for even an ordinary American to make a difference, and its image of contented, self-sufficient small town life (including some of its warts, as when Mrs. Seibert declares, ""Gossip!  That's all anybody does around here--gossip!""), while perhaps a bit idealized, gives a strong sense of the kind of environment in which Disney himself must have grown up, and which didn't really begin to change until the booming economy and the Interstate Highway construction of the 1950's.  I personally think the movie would have been better if it had been extended to 1960 (which would certainly have been possible) rather than ending 10 years earlier, but it's definitely highly enjoyable even as it stands, and the closing act, when Hickory proclaims Lem Siddons Day and honors its home-town hero, can bring tears to your eyes.  The title (the original source was ""God and My Country,"" a slender novel by ""Andersonville"" author MacKinlay Kantor) comes from the jaunty marching song, formerly sung by ""our outfit over in France,"" that Lem adopts for his first troop.  Families can enjoy this movie over and over, and kids can pick up some important lessons from it.",1143417600,52,3649,4.8772213247172855

1929714,5,B0000DZ3EG,"Lemuel Siddons is a musician (but studying to be a lawyer) with a travelling band around the early 1930s.  The bus makes a brief stop in a small town called Hickory, a charming middle-America kind of place, and Lem makes a fateful decision to stay.  He ends up volunteering to be the Boy Scout leader, impressing the sweet and beautiful Vida in the process.  As a selfless Scout leader he touches the lives of the boys in the town down through the years and influences them for the better, particularly young Kurt Russell.

One of my favorite movies of all time, one I like to put on every once in a while when I need a great inspiring kind of movie.  Fred MacMurray plays the role so wonderfully, and I'm reminded of kind Scoutmasters I had when growing up.  But it's not just a great Scout movie, or a great family film, it's just a good entertaining movie to watch.  Some people may call it a sappy and sentimental kind of Disney movie (as though that were something bad), but that's okay with me, I like it that way - and it's a LOT better than the majority of what the entertainment industry (Disney included, unfortunately) turns out now.  I don't know if towns like Hickory ever really existed, but I like to think that that's how life used to be (and OUGHT to be).",1129161600,7,1272,4.382978723404255

Fred MacMurray is wonderfull, the kid - Kurt Russell's debute, by the way, was sweet and believable. the mom, sweet and so June Cleaver-ish. the heartach, the joys - it's all good.

What a breath of fresh air compared to the tripe that Disney puts out today. Films like these remind us of America's Golden Age. Wonderful performances by all, uplifting singing on the trail, and a heart-rending, happy ending make this film a MUST HAVE in the libraries of parents who want wholesome entertainment for their kids. I wonder why more of the 1960's Disney movies have not come out on DVD. As a parent, I don't have to be woried about foul language ,sexual inuendos, or even ""attitudes"" that my kids will see glorified when we watch films like these.

1929719,4,B0000DZ3EG,"This is a classic all-American Disney feel good movie.  If that's your thing you will love this film.  I found it highly entertaining and a great look back to an idealized simpler time.  My only complaint with the film would be that the last quarter seems to drag on a bit because of several drastic plot twists that come completely out of left field.  But this is a minor flaw to a great film that is suited for the entire family.
The DVD itself needs some help.  For reasons unknown the film is not presented in it's original aspect ratio and worse, there is a yellow border around the picture while the opening credits are playing.  On the plus side, there is a great 11 minute bonus documentary, ""Looking back With Lem's boys"" which features interviews with the grown up kids who appeared in the film.  Kurt Russell does not appear in it but it's still a great feature",1088035200,,872,4.446540880503145

1929722,2,B0000DZ3EG,"Disney, Disney, Disney.  ""Follow Me, Boys"" is a flat-out wonderful film.  When first saw it during its mid-'70's re-release, I was absolutely riveted by the story and performances and moved by the Capra-esque ending.  I would recommend this film to everyone.  But I cannot recommend this version of one of your most beloved films.  You see, the pan-and-scan version you have presented on DVD is horrible.  The picture is muddy, the picture is cut-off, and the whole picture suffers because of it.  The only reason I give it two stars is because you did include a wonderful documentary with reminiscences from ""Lem's boys,"" while your other fullscreen DVDs have not had any special features whatsoever.  And contrary to what Disney apologists like some of these reviewers like to think, it DOES matter whether or not a film is in widescreen.  It's called ARTISTIC INTEGRITY, something Walt Disney had but the current Eisner-led idiots do not.  The actors, technicians, writer and director all deserve better, to say nothing of Walt himself, who happened to produce the darn thing and would have loved widescreen format.  Let's face it:  there's a reason all of today's top directors--Eastwood, Scorsese, Spielberg, Allen, Stone, Lucas, Jackson,etc.--insist on widescreen transfers of their films.  It's the only format that truly respects their work as filmmakers.
I bought this DVD in spite of the format because I love the film so much but I'm sorry I did.  In fact, I will no longer buy any video from any company unless it is widescreen.  I encourage everyone who loves movies to do likewise.",1083974400,37,1595,5.011406844106464
1929723,5,B0000DZ3EG,"I first saw this movie in the theater in 1966.  It was rated as ""too hokey and sugar sweet"".  At that time, as a high school student, I was compelled to write a letter to the local newspaper in defense of this wholesome and inspiring movie.  I have been searching for a copy for the past 16 years since my son joined scouting.  Today, at last, I am a proud owner of this terrific, inspirational film.  The quality of both sound and picture is terrific, and it is refreshing to remember a world where people cared for and loved one another.  It is also a great testimonial to the spirit of scounting.

1929725,5,B0000DZ3EG,"I first saw this movie in 2003 when I was serving on staff for a Scoutmaster training course.  We showed the movie in a cabin at Broadcreek Memorial Scout Reservation during a training weekend.  We had about 20 Scoutmasters and assistant Scoutmasters in one room watching this film.  It was probably the best indoor scouting experience I ever had!  The film takes place during a different time, but every one of the people in that room could relate to something in the film.  We had a great time watching, and commenting on, the film.  If you are involved with scouting, try to watch this film with the boys, leaders, and families of your troop.  I guarantee that you will be glad that you did.

1929726,4,B0000DZ3EG,"I first saw FOLLOW ME, BOYS on The Disney Channel long ago and looked forward to seeing it again. I initially watched it out of a sense of Duty -- as an admirer of the art of Walt Disney. I was anything but a Boy Scout and expected the film to be syrupy and nauseating, but was surprised to find FOLLOW ME, BOYS to be one of Uncle Walt's warmest and most genuinely sentimental works. The film shares a compelling spirit of real goodness and positive idealism with such Walt Disney classics as POLLYANNA, THOSE CALLOWAYS and OLD YELLER, along with much of their quality and entertainment value. Fred MacMurray is in his element here, giving one of his best performances. The Disney Company should certainly be including widescreen alternates on their DVDs but I was not going to miss this moving film for anything.
