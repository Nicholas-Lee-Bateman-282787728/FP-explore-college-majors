8425484,4,B004DK4J4Q,"I was recently browsing for a good movie in the foreign film section of my local library and fell upont this. I must admist I knew nothing about this movie, but upon seeing that it stars Jane Birkin was good enough for me.

As ""Around a Small Mountain"" (2009 release from France; original title ""36 vues du Pic Saint-Loup""; 84 min.) starts off, Kate (played by Jane Birkin) gets some road assistance from Vittorio (played by Sergio Castelitto) and later runs into Sergio again in the town where her family's small circus happens to be that day. She invites Vittorio to come check out the circus, which he does, and more: he decides to hang around for a few days. As the movie develops, we get to understand that Kate only recently had returned to the family circus, and why she went away in the first place. I am not going to give any further plot points away as it would ruin your viewing experience, but suffice it to say that there are a couple of ""surprises"". Although don't let that fool you (as apparently it may have one of the other reviewers here who dared to term this movie as ""the worst ever""), this is not an action movie at all. It is an intimate look at a small group of people, and how they interact with each other, nothing more, nothing less. I quite enjoyed the movie for what it was, and the hour and a half just flew by.

As a complete aside, as a life-long fan of Jane Birkin, I finally had the opportunity to see her in concert for the first time ever last December in Washington, DC, and what an evening that was. She couldn't have been be more personable and charming (and of course a great performer, as she is as well as an actress). Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for a good foreign movie, ""Around a Small Mountain"" is highly recommended!",1338595200,9,1769,4.341389728096677
8425485,5,B004DK4J4Q,"I'm sorry for people who don't love Jacques Rivette's movies. They're like people who hate Bergman, or Fellini. They're like people who are allergic to ice cream.

I can't tell you to enjoy something when you don't --  that's what critics really want to be able to do, but nobody can do that.  You should see this movie; there's a good chance you'll love it. Then you can see his others, and you'll love them, too. If not, not.",1315872000,8,427,4.379746835443038
8425486,1,B004DK4J4Q,"This is possibly the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune to watch.  Save yourself an hour and a half and look for something else.  There is nothing to see here!

Update:  Just noticed that people think my review wasn't helpful, so please be my guest and waste your time and money on this movie.  Just remember you were warned.",1300147200,4,333,4.39344262295082
8425487,4,B004DK4J4Q,"Good news: if you have followed the work of Jacques Rivette over the course of years--if his films have stamped themselves on your DNA--you will like this movie very much. You will ""get"" it. For others, start almost anywhere else, as long as it is not the 2007 film, NE TOUCHEZ PAS LA HACHE.

The script (as usual with Rivette, it was written during shooting) is a human comedy embedded in a Sirkian melodrama. There is a dysfunctional family, in this case a troupe of circus performers. A past trauma paralyzes the ""family"": a death, a guilty party, a lot of pointing fingers. Into this picture enters Vittorio  (Sergio Castellitto), who starts out with a casual crush on Kate (Jane Birkin), but who emerges as the ""intruder/redeemer"" figure.

At one point, Vittorio finds himself in the nightmare situation of having to replace a performer who is AWOL. He botches the performance so badly, there is no way to go on. He addresses the crowd (which is never a true crowd in this tiniest of circuses). ""This little ring is the most dangerous place in the world, but also where everything is possible. Where eyes are opened.""

M. Rivette, I have felt the danger of your films roiling just beneath the surface. You have helped me see that everything is possible. You have opened my eyes. Thank you for your lifetime of work.",1299801600,11,1320,4.676724137931035
