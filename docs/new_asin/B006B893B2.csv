The audience is then faced with moral dilemmas vicariously through the shows alternating main characters. The writing is absolutely brilliant, and I do not use that term lightly.

4981992,4,B006B893B2,"This is a smart, dark and well-plotted anthology show, two episodes of which have a sociological science fictional angle.  The premise of each story is engaging and the production values are quite high and the acting is generally good, though a bit histrionic at times, especially in the second episode, which is the weakest of the three.  Overall, a pretty unsettling and creative triptych of independent/stand alone stories.  All three episodes will stay with you and detail a morally ambiguous situation that is compelling.
Worth seeking out for fans of The Twilight Zone, Ghost in the Shell, The Hammer House of Horror, Ted Chiang's fiction.  I'm not sure if there's been an anthology show as good as this since The Hammer House of Horror (which had some duds, but also some incredibly disturbing stuff), and I look forward to season 2.  This should be properly released in the US on blu ray.",1384646400,12,896,4.868421052631579
4981993,3,B006B893B2,"A fairly good series. The first story is well acted but a little overwrought - it requires a fairly large suspension of disbelief but viscerally conveys the hold that the media and public emotion have over an elected official. I did not watch the middle story but the third story was the most interesting. The premise is a society where people have continuous recording devices and explores a relationship in the context of such a device.  Unfortunately, it is an exploration of the 'big lies' in a rather conventional way, which can be explored without the fiction of such a device.  More interesting might have been to explore the common, small lies that generally pass unnoticed and may even be told for the sake of the person being lied to.",1384473600,7,744,4.7153846153846155
4981994,4,B006B893B2,"I liked the series overall. The second episode was not as good as the first and the third espisodes. These ""outer"" episodes touched upon interesting issues about the networked world and the persistence of information. By the way, they have some ""mature"" issues which are crucial for the plots. I am looking forward to the getting the second series when it is available on DVD.

Technical note: The DVD is region-free but is in the PAL format. If your television or DVD player doesn't support PAL, the DVD won't be watchable. But it works fine view on a computer. No problems at all.",1364083200,30,582,4.650485436893204

4981996,5,B006B893B2,"Wow...must be a lot of fans of ""television"" that appeals to the lowest common denominator around here.  ""The Voice"" much?  How about some ""Big Brother""?!?  Seriously, the bad reviews for this awe-inspiring collection of stories really shows you what the glut of society truly is: ""dumbed"" down to comfort zones.  Try to step outside of that shell every once in a while.  This series does not conform to the typical ""and they all lived happily ever"" narrative.  You're not SUPPOSED to feel good after watching.

You wanna know what ""Black Mirror"" is in a nutshell?  Think, Alfred Hitchcock on steroids.  ""Tales from the Darkside"" but much deeper.  ""The Twilight Zone"" with more of an edge.  This series makes you think and think hard if you're willing to give it a chance.  Honestly, I can only stomach an episode or two at a time b/c they can be quite depressing.

Black Mirror isn't disgusting or obscene just to be so.  Mere shock value is not what the collaborators are looking for here.  If that's what you think, you're missing the point entirely.  Have an open mind and remember, not every episode is pitched with a negative slant.  I think that the one (almost fatal) flaw of this series was going with such a truly disturbing story for the pilot.  Looking around at some of the other reviews, it's quite clear that many refused to soldier on past episode one.  Which is truly a shame because much of the content is groundbreaking and I know that a lot of you giving negative remarks would agree had you watched more.  I'd like to believe that this many of you aren't so...shut off.

Masses, eat your heart out.  Stick to cable news and ""2 Broke Girls"".",1499731200,6,1660,4.613013698630137
4981997,5,B006B893B2,"Not yet a purchaser. I'm waiting for Amazon to buy the digital rights for distribution. With all that being said, this show is the most amazing modern day ""Twilight Zone"".

I've watched all 3 seasons, and the creativity and twists are just amazing. I laughed, cried, lost sleep, and talked the ears off of many people over this show.

The future world and technology that they use in each episode is different, and actually quite close to reality.

If I had to guess, this show's future world would probably be the norm in 10-15 years for the most part. Many of the ideas have already been introduced in our modern day times, but the capabilies of what everything can do is in the early stages.

Just buy all three seasons when all are available! Watch everything to the end. That's when the entire plot comes together and surprises you. Very good show! Finally...I've waited my entire life for a show that's made for me. This is it.

Cheers,

Pacing was too slow for several of the episodes such that there were sections that were excruciatingly boring. I found myself putting the episode on pause and going off to do something else to keep me awake before returning to unpause the video.

The premises and plot twists were interesting and surprising for some of the episodes, so I give it 3 stars. I feel like it would have been better if I had read these as a book or series of short stories than watched them as TV. So much more of the characters' inner dialogue would have been available via printed word, filling up a lot of the boring sections with meaning and further insight into the characters.

My favorite book Is 1984 and favorite movie is A Clockwork Orange. I like them because it's possible that in the not so distant future society can change for the worst. But this show says that we are currently living in a dystopian society. This show along with Mr Robot, just whine about first world problems. What's next mr Brooker? Will someone's cell phone die in the most Inopportune time? Of all the real gripping drama in the world, Brooker has to over exaggerate first world issues. Pretentious and preachy.

Sometimes the twists were a little too obvious or familiar, or the ideas a bit heavy handed.  But the writing, acting and direction were all of a very high order.  3 short films, between a half hour and an hour, all set in the quite near future, all examining our plugged in social media age.  As with any collection, some stories worked better for me than others.  And, as with all anthologies YMMV - what works best for me may not work best for you.  But personally, my favorite two episodes were actually in season 2.  Be Right Back is more than just clever, its also deeply moving, surprisingly subtle and complex in its examination of the nature of loss and our attempts to deal with pain.  And I found White Bear genuinely disturbing and frightening, a great, harrowing job of capturing just what it feels like to be stuck in a nightmare.",1443830400,3,1141,4.5

4982013,5,B006B893B2,"Pretty much all of the one-star reviews were by people who admittedly only watched one episode and then stopped. That should tell you a lot. Ironically, that first episode is quite different from all the rest (not much of a sci-fi/technological hook, more just shock value) and probably the least representative of the series as a whole.

If you're concerned you might succumb to terminal prudishness like all the one-stars, skip the first episode and go straight to either ""The Entire History of You"" or ""15 Million Merits"", then ease into the rest of the series gradually. OR find the episode ""White Christmas"" online to watch.

Point being, this series is superb. We are long overdue for something like this in the media. The only bad part about this show is that there isn't more of it.

4982014,5,B006B893B2,"While it has been compared to the 'twilight zone', I'm not sure that's an accurate description. The first episode was quite disturbing, but good, but I wasn't sure I wanted to continue to watch.  I found the 2nd episode pretty dull. After that it began to pick up again. All of the episodes are a statement of what technology is becoming in our society and where it may go. Some of the stories are quite riveting, especially the 'White Bear' episode - watch it for that, if none else.
If you like futuristic, yet present-day style sci-fi (and I'm not sure that's the right word for it), you will enjoy most of this series. Each episode is unique to itself, non are related. There is gore, cursing, and other graphic scenes, so if you can't handle that, this isn't for you. Very unique-recommended.",1432080000,,797,4.573426573426573

4982017,4,B006B893B2,"The Brits have some appallingly short TV seasons, but when they go ahead with something worth doing, they do it properly.

Like a couple of other reviewers who have posted here, I checked this out after hearing a glowing review of Black Mirror on the radio program Studio 360 (Public Radio International). Unlike those viewers who shot it down with 1-star ratings (after watching only the first episode), I found this to be very worthwhile. Perhaps I hold a favorable opinion because I skipped ahead of the ""sex with a pig"" episode (ep. 1, ""The National Anthem"") and instead started with ep. 3, watching the season in reverse chronological order (viewing order doesn't matter, as the episodes are unconnected). I'd recommend this approach if you are feeling unease about getting thru The National Anthem.

I found ep. 3, ""The Entire History of You,"" to be insightful and beyond reproach, as well as a fair assessment of what the future holds. If you are a science fiction enthusiast, it hits all the right notes.
I'm not sure that I would call this serial ""dark,"" as others are so fond of proclaiming (have they been out of the house lately?) Rather, it is a wary premonition of technology's downside; we have already seen the first indications of privacy becoming a commodity, and a reasoning mind can conclude that this is only the tip of an iceberg. 

PROs
 the acting is quite respectable
 the special effects are nothing to sneeze at
 the stories are daring and thought-provoking

CONs
 the price is criminal for a set with only 3 episodes

Bravo, off to Series 2 I go.

If you are hesitant about starting the serial due to negative comments re: ""The National Anthem,"" then why not start with the best first? Specifically, ""White Christmas,"" followed by Series 2, and finally Series 1; remember, there is no overarching story arc, so the order in which you watch Black Mirror episodes matters not.",1423526400,27,2209,5.179775280898877

This is not something you want to view unless you seriously want to degrade yourself as a human being.

I watched the first episode only because I heard on NPR that this was equivalent to the Twilight Zone. Hardly so. The Twilight Zone was something that could be easily viewed by all ages, and it had a moral to every story. It made you think. This show Black Mirror only makes you feel disgusted that somebody actually made a show this terrible.

I disagree with the techy Twilight Zone comparisons.  Each episode feels like it was based on a pretty interesting short story.  They don't demonize technology because that would be simplistic and stupid, and this is not a stupid series (it's BBC).

I suspect people's favorite episodes will vary wildly.  My favorites were National Anthem and White Bear.  I would only recommend The Waldo Moment to a certain type of person (see comment section).  This series is very subversive and attacks pop culture and mainstream attitudes in what I think are interesting ways.  The only plot I will mention is the first episode, National Anthem.  A Dutchess, who is more popular than Princess Di is kidnapped and the ransom demands of her kidnappers is posted on YouTube-- She will be executed tomorrow at 6 pm if the Prime Minister doesn't go on live tv to a specified location and have sex with a pig.  That takes some ambition and balls to write an episode like that and not turn it into a joke!  You have to really despise political leaders and want to see them totally debase themselves to like that episode.  I feel like I view the world pretty similarly to the show's creators, but I know most people will probably be too offended to enjoy some of the stories.  My least favorite episode was Fifteen Million Merits and so I suspect that one will be the crowd favorite.  Actually, I didn't even finish watching The Entire History of You or We'll Be Right Back because their plots seemed too familiar.

While I would be the first to admit that those two episodes may, by coincidence, not be representative of the series, I would say that for anyone who would feel they are relatively consistently representative of the whole that my commentary can be taken to be equally representative of all of it.

If I take two bites out of a sandwich I don't like, Im probably not going to end up loving it if I eat the whole thing.

The above disclaimer given, I have to say there is so much to criticize in this series that it is difficult to figure out where to begin.

At a high level the most vulnerable areas to dissect have to do with the look, feel, concept and production of it.

In all these areas it is a ubiquitously boring, conventional, self absorbed and unimaginative experience. The writing is terrible - stilted, lacking variety, bland and flat. So much so that to recall storylines, character traits and character arc is a challenge. It is nearly immediately excruciating to listen to the dialogue and from the limited exposure to the actors Ive seen they do little with the dialogue (mostly an extension of the quality of the writing).

(After Kelly and Yorkie have sex, the orgasm of which was conveyed with crashing waves - the oldest trope in prudish cinema; yawn)
Kelly: ...but youve been with others
Yorkie: Youve deflowered me

Huh? What exactly was the point of that dialogue? That she was inexperienced and shy? We knew that in the first FIVE minutes of the episode!

The look and feel of it harkens back to the days of twilight zone (when a segmented and fragmented storyline was unique), day-time moralistic weekday movies and pseudo sci-fi storylines from shows like The Avengers, Twilight Zone and The Protectors (two of which were also UK produced series). So in this respect the feel of it is derivative but the feel is ersatz rather than trying to pay homage to an earlier time.

The visual cues and editing is equally conventional, melodramatic and predictable (the unpredictableness comes from the storyline), The episode San Junipero is soaked in this. We see the shy retiring shut-in Yorkie trying to make her way in a new town she is visiting. We are shown a quasi-bacchanalian party town for teens and young adults which is bathed in dark light has a flat depth of field and filled with prototypical period stage dressing and throwback music. It has the feel of all being muted, nearly dreamlike and anyone who has seen Memento, Ex Machina, Sixth Sense, Inception or Fight Club will immediately realize this is a made up place (we eventually learn it is augmented reality- ooooohhh, how cool). Yorkie has two personal interactions and by the second one (to the outgoing Kelly) this shy and socially awkward misfit is all in.

It is astonishing and tears down the fourth wall since theres nothing remotely interesting or appealing about Kelly save her kindness of paying back a unsolicited ruse Yorkie helps her pull off to rebuff an old boyfriend. The crux of the storyline hangs on this simple and improbable suspension of disbelief. But the incredible allure that Yorkie has toward Kelly is soon trumped by the inexplicable care and interest Kelly has in Yorkie. There is no chemistry between the actors and the writing lies on the screen like cold cooked spaghetti drooping off a wall.

What follows are the exploits of the two that becomes filler for the sausage of the episode.  The excruciating nature of the bored matter in the middle is virtually underscored by the self referential black screens informing us one week later.

We would have been better served with a substitute on a black screen of Yorkie and Kelly frolic, have a variety of interludes, have sex, split then try to make restitution but cant because of their histories. A month has passed or a montage but either would have saved time.

In this new genre of anthology series the concept seems the most tenuous and susceptible to critique. Since it becomes the purpose of each episode. In this regard it again feels pandering, quasi topical and seeking to convey a message, in a contemporary vernacular by use of science fiction.

The difference in the message between this and in earlier incarnations was more easily identifiable as related to political themes and social ills. For example, the line Klaatu barada nikto"" from the brilliant 1951 sci-fi classic The Day the Earth Stood Still was a clear message to an audience living daily under the specter of nuclear war. The apparent message in the San Junipero episode is one of utopian hopefulness of living a meaningful life due to futuristic technology after life (which is what, science is showing, is exactly what keeps us apart) - which the episode isn't even willing to call death. Now, thats Utopian hell. In this sense then the series is both confused and confusing. The message is no message and the message is not the medium.

I was encouraged when I saw a wider range of reviews here than on Rotten Tomatoes. I can see how this simplistic, mysterious, contemporary aesthetic can be intriguing in the same way that posting a picture of a sandwich and calling it Awesome can have the temporary sense of representing meaning and connection.

A note about reviews:
After scanning a number of negative and positive reviews (5s and 1s) there is one clear commonality. A lack of critique, thought and respect for opinion.

There is copious amounts of I love it or I hate it with one odd (and unsubstantiated comparison to Hitchcock, care to give an example? I saw no comparisons to Hitchcock). One hilariously called for banning poor reviews who haven't seen all the episodes (and presumably youll need to memorize the dialogue too). But the reality is that from the perspective of being helpful or insightful in your reviews you all get Fs.

Im agnostic on if someone wants to state their opinion. You cant argue about chocolate ice cream if someone say they like it. Its their OPINION!

This is probably an unfair hypothesis, but my gut instinct tells me that many of the I love it audience falls into the anti king has no clothes camp. He had no clothes. There was no there, there.

In fact, if I had to make a case for a positive review of what Ive seen - it would be tough. I apologize for sounding insulting and condescending here but Id probably be inclined toward the nice try or swing and miss position.

The San Junipero episode seemed like it was trying to make some kind of universal statement about life, love and humanity and trans-generational connection. If so it would have been more engaging had the character relationship development been less forced. At the end I knew nothing about each character, who they were, what were their lives and what mattered to them. There was nothing for us to remember and reminisce or have empathy about. No sense of loss. Maybe we see the shy is a cover for a prior life and the outgoing persona is also hiding something. That could have made for an interesting connection and self discovery bond. I might have cared for them.

Its my opinion that this series doesnt seem to be worth my time. If someone disagrees, fine - thats YOUR opinion. And if you don't like my opinion, fine - thats still just YOUR opinion.

And if you hated it, please articulate why? One positive review insulted naysayers by suggesting they were somehow devoid of the ability to recognize good quality. For those aesthetes I say what makes you think you know the difference between good and bad?",1517011200,2,7611,4.718161266013564

8495919,4,B006B893B2,"I have watched this series on NetFlix which has four seasons of the show. I don't know how many seasons there are but I think they have all of them. Black Mirror is a very different type of show. Each episode is entirely different from other episodes and can stand alone without the other seasons. The series explores the growth of technology and this digital age we live in. The series shows the positive and negative complexities of technology and just how intertwined our lives could become with that technology in the coming age. The writing is very innovative, daring, frightening, and very coherent. I can't even begin to tell you where the show can take your mind. I simply recommend you give this show a chance. Series one starts out with a rather repulsive bit of content in the very first episode but thankfully the rest of the series didn't go where that episode went again.",1516233600,,885,4.643312101910828
