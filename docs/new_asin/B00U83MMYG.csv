8704654,3,B00U83MMYG,"This recent Drive-In Double Bill from Vinegar Syndrome provides 2 'R' Rated films from Director Chris Wakefield - a guy, who it would appear, seems to think that women are out to 'screw' men (both literally and figuratively!) OR that, at least, such sexually malicious machinations make for a good exploitation plot.  The female protagonists in both of these 70's vintage 'adult' flix have an 'axe to grind' and it is some poor guy that ends up on the chopping block.

Personally - I found ""Little Miss Innocence"" to be the more satisfying film - largely because it had two super cute 70's sweeties in it and they took their clothes off A LOT. In the simplistic plot line: a nice average middle aged guy in L.A. picks up a couple of attractive hitch-hiking teen girls who end up moving in with him for a few days and attempting to ruin his life by 'screwing him to death'! It turns out one of the girls was sexually abused by her 'family' and she's out for 'payback' against the male gender in general while her friend is not quite so vindictive - she just wants to lose her virginity and try out every sex position known to man! (Gotta love the 70's!)  Between them they soon have their unwilling 'host' begging for mercy (and sleep).  As previously noted - there is a goodly amount of full female nudity in this flik but the sex scenes are soft core and seem sorta chopped up - nothing really arousing - but a quirky story with hot chicks.

""Teenage Seductress"" plays like it was a bit of an 'excuse' for the film-maker to take a trip to Taos, New Mexico - where the action is situated. The 'seductress' in this rather improbable tale isn't actually 'teenage'  - as she states at one point that she has graduated w/ a college degree - which would put her in early 20's! Regardless ...This attractive young woman is searching for her father - who dumped both she and her mother when she was a child. Her bitter single mom warned the daughter repeatedly that: 'men only want one thing!""  SO she, apparently, sets out to give that 'THING' to her dad!! - thereby 'punishing' him for his abandonment with a shameful dose of incestuous behavior. A weird plot line to be sure! In the screenplay, the father is a successful writer in the art colony of Taos - the 'daughter' secretly worms her way into his life by becoming his 'secretary' and, ultimately, lover!  The ending is played enigmatically with two opposing realities (neither of which is particularly politically correct!) leaving a bit of a 'question mark' for both the 'father' and the audience! Precious little sex or nudity in this one - the lead actress gets naked briefly in the shower AND there's the artfully rendered 'climactic' incestuous love scene - but that's about it for sexploitation - much more time is spent with scenes of  local folk and locales in the picturesque New Mexico art community... an interesting juxtaposition to the rather creepy storyline!

As usual for Vinegar Syndrome releases, the visual quality for both pictures is excellent.  The only extras are the original 'trailers' for both films.  As is often the case the 'trailers' make the 'actual' films look a lot better than they really are.  I found this to be an 'interesting' set of 'B' grade films - but not particularly 'hot'- if thatz what U R looking 4!",1429574400,13,3299,4.609215017064846
