I enjoyed the wry self-reference of the animated character narrating his thoughts in terms of a marionette, though, and wondered how much the puppet puppeteer represented Cole's own experience as stop animator. But, on the whole, I have to admit that the philosophizing monologue didn't do a lot for me.

What really matters is that stop animation just reached a new high. The two characters' faces are lovingly sculpted and delightfully agile, giving them the most lifelike and delicate motion I've ever seen. When you see the extras, you'll see why. Each one is built over an elaborate mechanical armature, one that gives an exquisite level of control over every part of the character. I'm not ignoring the artistry of the animation itself, by the way. However beautiful and complex, the puppets are just tools, and Cole wields those tools with consummate skill.

This short animation is said to be an abbreviated version of something nearly ten times as long - something that has yet to be realized. If Cole ever finds the time and means to create that feature-length film at this level of craft, it will be truly wonderful.

This is not just an ordinary short film; it is a stunning display of art, craftsmanship and intellect. It was also wonderful to see the extra feature where Ron gives some insight into the various aspects of it's creation. Ron Cole is a talent to be reckoned with; hopefully we will soon see much more of this masters work on display.

 Attention Directors and Producers, don't miss a chance to present something unique, hand crafted and stunning; see what can be done with stop motion in the 21st century.

As a challenge you certainly took on a massive task. Having two characters chatting and keeping it interesting is difficult enough with live action actors but your creations are believable and remarkable with the way you made them come alive. The review of Coraline was a great bonus film and I want to wish you the best of success with your art and film making. Thanks Ron! You are a Master of Stop Motion Animation and you have my admiration.",1402704000,2,611,4.464285714285714
