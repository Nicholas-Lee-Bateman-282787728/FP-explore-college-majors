8473918,3,B005HWRQVW,"Pretty ridiculous plot, mostly badly acted. Only bought it because I saw the 2 leads in a You Tube video and wanted to know more.",1522713600,,129,4.2
8473919,4,B005HWRQVW,"This is a super ""TONGUE - IN - CHEEK"" movie... The acting isn't the best, the story plot isn't as good as the acting, but I couldn't give it the solid 3.5 that it deserves... So my rating is rounded UP instead of DOWN. If you are expecting anything better than the trailer depicts DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE. If you just feel like watching something really ridiculously cheesy... Here it is!!!",1423785600,,389,4.416666666666667
8473920,2,B005HWRQVW,"I had purchased a copy of this movie expecting a beach-type picture with some mild between-the-sexes ribbing.  What I got was a picture
that even the corporate male-bashers at Lifetime would consider to be excessive.  The two girls in this movie, victims of love affairs
gone awry, decide to exterminate the entire male gender (or at least it looks like that's their aim), and never once do they even come
close to justice; the only time is when one of their boyfriends / victims - wearing a T-shirt that says ""police"" - whines to another one
about his potential fate.  If this picture had been about men assaulting women in a similar manner, it would be called a hate crime,
but since it's women against men, it's considered a public service?  If this is the ""war between the sexes"", I'm dodging the draft.",1408924800,3,807,4.6223776223776225
8473921,5,B005HWRQVW,This was just a really humorous 'girls side of the story' for the dating age.  Get the gang together to see it.,1356220800,,111,4.045454545454546
8473922,3,B005HWRQVW,"""My emotionally crippling father has nothing to do with the fact that I knock guys over the head and have sex with them."" Two girls, Alexis (Richardson) & Lindsay (Monk) are single and living in Los Angeles. They have a hard time finding dates and after failure after failure they decide to change their approach. They walk around, see someone that looks cute and knock them out, when they wake up in the girls house the date begins. Every once in a while it is nice to just sit back and relax watching a movie that you don't have to think about. Like most of this type of movie they try to put a deep emotional plot in it without realizing that there is only one reason that people will want to watch. This is another movie where the plot isn't needed and you can just put in and veg out to. Sometimes those movies are needed after watching some emotional ones. All that said this is a movie about two hot blondes who have problems (?) getting dates. Think the ""Sweetest Thing"" but more of a ""USA up-all night"" version. After all this you are probably wondering one thing and no...there isn't really that much nudity in this. Overall, if you want a movie you don't have to think about and just watch you could do worse. I give it a C.",1336003200,2,1235,4.304721030042918
8473923,5,B005HWRQVW,"Oh what a great independent movie! Reminds me of the classic 80's fun formula movies, with a 2000's twist and edginess.  Fun cast, funny writing, awesome cameo appearances. Fun ride!",1329091200,4,182,5.066666666666666
8473924,4,B005HWRQVW,"I laughed and laughed at the movie because it was so funny, I was in the mood for a good time and this movie was the answer. Trust me it is not for everyone, so if you thought All About Steve with Sandra Bullock was funny you are going to love this.",1320192000,,249,3.8076923076923075
