2604361,4,B000GBEWMU,"Although a dark comedy with a serious lean toward sexual narcissism, this film's quirks will appeal to those who don't mind exploring those dark corners of one's desires and laughing at their own inadequacies.

Caveh Zahedi is the screenwriter, director, star, and historian regarding his personal battles with sex addiction.

The most entertaining aspects of the film are that it is shot rather unconventionally. Although the film starts with Zahedi talking to the camera, waiting to be married for the third time, the scenes zip back and forth between Zahedi the narrator, Zahedi the actor, and Zahedi the narrator during acting (he'll occasionally stare at the camera and make a rather pithy comment while acting within the framework of the film). Part documentary, part fictional take on his experiences, the film delves deep into sexual promiscuity. Bit by bit we get to watch Zahedi fall into a pit of self-gratification with little or no concern for his girlfriends or wives. That he tries to be ""honest"" and ""open"" only shows his continued deep slide into the addictive process. When the women in his life fight with him, he's at a loss to understand why (""But you said I could have sex with a prostitute!"")

The comedy is all based around Zahedi's lack of self-control and his relationships based solely on sexual need. Watching him receive oral sex -- his facial expressions and loss of auditory control -- are absolutely hilarious; not to mention his fifteen second rise to orgasm.

The film is edited extremely well, mostly taking place in San Francisco, but also in Paris and a few other locations. The map animation sequences are very nicely done as are a few other animations related to travel and Zahedi's history.

The fact that I AM A SEX ADDICT won the Gotham Award in 2005 for Best Film Not Playing at a Theater Near You should be a useful gauge for those considering this movie as a rental or purchase.",1158278400,13,1923,4.832826747720365
2604362,4,B000GBEWMU,"This movie is not for everyone.  Zahedi portrays a very particular addiction very explicitly (scan the Internet for specifics), and it is a very personal portrayal.  He has a deft comic touch, but the comedy here can make things even more disturbing.  His honesty is staggering, but, even though I loved the film, I'm not sure that I needed to hear about his struggles.

I would say that this is Zahedi's most accessible film, but I'm not sure that that would be a very useful insight.  I Am a Sex Addict continues Zahedi's interest in combining life and art.  The self-awareness works, and the film's shortcomings (low budget, etc.) are part of its charm.

At the very least, this movie shows how phoney most nebbish characters in film are.  Zahedi's personality and his obsessions are very disturbing, and he does not sugarcoat anything to ease anyone's discomfort.  Yes, it is narcissistic (though, in Zehedi's defense, he does allow his friends to question his ideas in his DVD commentary for a previous film; how many people--even the non-narcissists--allow that?), but it is also very humanizing.

This film probably has something more to say to people with sex addictions and sexual disfunctions.  But hardly anyone has sexual hang-ups, right?",1158278400,3,1250,4.990338164251208
2604363,4,B000GBEWMU,"Although I tend to agree with Dalton's assesment regarding Caveh's

narcissistic bent -- but what better way to tell the story of an addiction of pandemic proportions here in the US than with the uniquely American-style confessional? Spilling our guts is an American pastime. This film would never have been made in this way in Europe, and that's what makes it uniquely our own. Fascinating, funny, and honest-- guaranteed to make your inner voyeur cringe with laughter.",1157241600,4,470,5.103896103896104
2604364,4,B000GBEWMU,"I enjoyed Caveh's film.  Trinie Dalton comes across as a prude in her review. Honestly, there's nothing shocking in Caveh's film of any sexual nature.  The film is well edited although it could have been shortened a bit.  But Caveh does know how to make a film with a beginning, middle and end. This one is linear and Caveh goes out on a limb asking you not to judge him too harshly on his sex addiction.  Caveh was definitely influenced by Woody Allen so if you like Woody there's no reason why you wouldn't like Caveh. I found myself entertained by Caveh's story and felt it took alot of guts on Caveh's part to put himself on film so ""nakedly.""  Don't judge this film so harshly. Sex addiction is a serious problem that affects people all over the world. It would have been interesting if Caveh had actually shown what exactly he learned while he attended his sex addiction meetings (we don't know exactly what he learned other than his own self-admission to sex addiction) but he obviously was able to stop prostitute binging and was able to find love again.  Caveh is a bright, articulate artist and he came across genuinely in this film (which is why I liked it).  Most importantly, he shows actual footage of the REAL women he actually dated who are represented by actors in the film.  This proves EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE and is emotionally MOVING. These are REAL PEOPLE folks!! Lest any of you forget!  Kudos for Caveh for tackling a difficult subject and doing it creatively and in his own ""inimitable"" way!",1155772800,7,1512,4.611940298507463

2604367,3,B000GBEWMU,"Ok I get it. You discovered sex. Most people discover sex when they are, like, 14, and then they discover doing it with other people a couple of years later. This guy is like 30 or more, and you'd think he discovered something new we all don't know about. Basically, I thought I was watching the biography of Anthony Wiener...very skinny guy of middle eastern descent wants to have sex with everybody. But Caveh is a lot more likeable guy than Wiener. Back to the movie...this guy's not happy with his girlfriend so he hires hookers. Why is he a sex addict? It sure can't be an overproduction of testosterone. In fact, I'd be happy if he got a hold of Alex Rodguez trainer's phone number for some 'roids, he's such a little soft-spoken little thing. I didn't enjoy the movie much.

2604370,3,B000GBEWMU,I stumbled upon this movie in the middle of the night and it ended up being pretty entertaining.  It's really really strange but it's funny and interesting.  It also made me cringe a number of times.,1346889600,,199,4.5
2604371,2,B000GBEWMU,"I really tried to be impressed by this movie after reading some of the stellar reviews, but I found the dialogue almost juvenile with a lot of amateur acting.

Director Caveh Zahedi who plays himself, a sex addict in this semi-documentary, is interesting for a little while, but begins to just ramble on and makes many of the characters in his film almost cardboard like. While he does put real faces to some of the women in his film and what apparently are real sex addicts in a group that he attended, there was no real amazing revelation to his problem/solution to his sex addiction. It did not help that Caveh Zahedi talks with a monotone lisp and looks a bit like a troll doll yet all the women he has sex with are fairly beautiful, but I have met worse off directors who have done well too, so it is not implausible.

Granted it is not easy to develop an interest in a girlfriend character that then changes to another one every 5-10 minutes or so. Also the director's personality  and film approach is compared to Woody Allen, but it lacks the humor on human behavior that Woody Allen's films often portrays.

The film is not bad and I can understand how some people are enthralled by it as the content is a bit taboo in the United States and the director is a unique character. As films go, however, it is not something I would pay to see in the theater (unlike My dinner with Andre, The brothers McMullen, She's gotta have it, Grizzly Man, Brothers at War...etc).",1338595200,2,1472,4.440740740740741
2604372,4,B000GBEWMU,"This is an intensely autobiographical film by a skinny oddball filmmaker in which he attempts to be extraordinarily open about his sex life, his relationships and his thinking. The film is basically a real life drama with some re-enactments added (and noted as such). A graduate of the UCLA film school, Zahedi's semi documentary techniques are well crafted, and his cast is excellent - performances are natural and appealing, including some talented beauties who play girlfriends and prostitutes.

All are appealing that is except for the protagonist, who is physically not very attractive and seems obsessively self centered. On the other hand he displays genuine emotion, quite rare in cinema. And it's all quite funny too, even though we sometimes wish one of the women would pick up the  annoying 90 lb director and launch him out the window.

Mr. Zahedi has not been very successful as a filmaker, due in part to his stubborn insistence on offending everyone including his sponsors. Nevertheless this is a serious work of art; we may not end up liking him much but we do have to admire his effort to be so revealing regarding an area of life most people, even authors and artists, prefer to conceal. He wears his heart on his sleeve. Towards the end of the film he recognizes that his behavior is problematic, and the film ends with his real life happy marriage and genuine emotions of gratitude and breakthrough from our hero.

A unique effort, and quite moving in its way. Recommended.

He's so minute, humble and ultimately interesting both as a filmmaker and the subject.  As the two roles constantly intertwine, we're left with an amusing look at a serious subject.

He's stupid and shallow and as far as the movie, it's awful and dull and thoroughly unenjoyable.

2604382,5,B000GBEWMU,"I've got to tell you about a hilarious, quirky little independent autobiographical film  by filmmaker Caveh Zahidi that I and my friends saw last night called ""I Am A Sex Addict"".  We weren't sure what to think with a title like that but Zahidi is brilliant.  He has a unique way of seeing himself and his actions and the humor and irony in all of it all as he weaves an incredible story of his addiction to prostitutes and the effect on the relationship he has with the serious women of his life. He makes us laugh at him in plight as he tries different ""strategies"" to break his habit.  The film was funny, brilliant, thoughtful,  poignant,  surprisingly philosophical,  full of irony and  just totally entertaining on many different levels. Every scene was meticulously set up.  It was by far one of the more entertaining movies any of us had seen in a long time. And all that without an extravagant hollywood budget! There were parts where I laughed till I cried. Go see it, or buy it...it's that good.",1164585600,6,1006,4.544444444444444
2604383,4,B000GBEWMU,"I enjoyed this quirky little film. It's a low budget dramatized biopic about the sad love-life of Iranian-American director Caveh Zahedi. He is plagued by what he terms ""sex addiction"" (He has a prostitute and bl__job fetish). It begins and ends with what hopefully will be his last and finally-successful marriage. It blends original home movie footage with filmed recreations, with Zahedi appearing as subject, actor, director and narrator.

I loved his hapless, self-deprecating, dead-pan nature. As must many women, because he is quite possibly the least physically impressive man I've ever seen; scrawny, puny, close to being a wimp and yet he obviously has something that draws so many beautiful women to him. His ex-wives and girlfriends (they appear on the home movies) are very lovely. I don't know if I'd label him a narcissist but he is certainly obsessed with sex, especially with prostitutes and bl__jobs. The first thing he learns in a foreign country is how to say, ""Will you suck my c__k?"" in the local language. I love the way he repeatedly delivers the line with that timid, hopeful, earnest look. Luckily he goes to very accomdating places like France, Holland and Germany. And when he visits a European brothel, he's like a kid in a candy store. Although his wives eventually divorce him, they are remarkably tolerant and accomodating - in the film he recounts how his second wife gave him five bj's in succession after he confessed his addiction; although it's true, he doesn't last very long each time - about 15 seconds is all it takes for him to be squealing like a rabbit. His orgasms are hilarious to behold.

To his credit he puts all blame on the broken relationships solely on himself; he doesn't blame his wives or girlfriends at all; in fact he paints them as long-suffering martyrs. Still, laughs and moral issues aside, it is very sad for someone to be so consumed by an obsession that he cannot form a lasting relationship with anyone. Hopefully this final marriage will indeed be his last and he gets to find some peace and satisfaction in life.

Zahedi has an official website and he also writes a blog. If you go there you can read his bio. He actually studied Philosophy at Yale and tried to get apprenticed to Godard (rebuffed). There is a picture of him as a young boy with Woody Allen whom he obviously admires.

IFC presents the film in its original 1.33:1 full screen. Colours are strong and natural. It's generally pleasing on the eye. Only the home movie segments have a large amount of grain. Although the women are shown full-frontal, Zahedi never shows his dumbstick - a black rectangle always blocks it from view. I wonder if that was due to shyness, vanity or an MPAA requirement. The DVD comes with a half-hour long documentary ""Shooting I am a Sex Addict"" in which Zahedi dissects 3 scenes in the film.

PS: Speaking of blogs and sex, I do hope some studio picks up blogger Zoe Margolis' ""Girl With A One Track Mind,"" and turns that into a film. That would be hilarious. One of the rare women who confesses to being addicted to sex and one of the few blogs that I look forward to reading.",1161648000,28,3140,4.691470054446461
2604384,5,B000GBEWMU,"Which is ironic as Caveh appeared in one of Allen's films as a child. What is shocking about this film is it was made with such a low budget. Hollywood studios pump out garbage that cost millions to produce which goes to show big budgets do not always equal good productions. I am a Sex Addict is another hit for Caveh. What makes this film interesting to watch it is a first person (Caveh) biographical look back at his past struggles with Sex addiction with prostitues and the toll it took on his personal relationships, but told in a a way that keeps the audience wondering whether what Caveh is telling is truth or fiction, then he reveals that.................I won't spoil it.

2604385,5,B000GBEWMU,"""I Am a Sex Addict"" is a semi-documentary written and directed by a little bug-eyed dude named Caveh Zahedi. I'd never heard of the guy and only stumbled upon this film because I saw it on the Joblo Release Dates. When I read that Roger Ebert had called the film ""Perversely Interesting"" I was even more intrigued. The reason I said it's a semi-documentary is because Zahedi is narrating past events that apparently happened in real life, while recreating them onscreen using actors. It's almost like a movie-within-a-movie, except for the whole annoying part of movies like that. In the film, Zahedi plays himself...We're introduced as he's about to get married, it's his third trip down the aisle. He takes us back in time and explains that he was always looking for his soulmate, even as a young kid. He then meets the love of his life, Anna...Problem is, he also meets a french woman named Caroline (Rebecca Lord) that strikes his fancy. He then explains that the actress he cast as Caroline is a pornstar, something he didn't find out until later. He ends up parting ways with Anna and marrying Caroline, all the while becoming increasingly addicted to sex...Especially sex with prostitutes. The film deals with him going through several girlfriends, all the while trying not to give into his addiction completely. The movie is funny, but it's in a deadpan and subtle way. One scene in particular, when Caveh explains that there's a scene where a female character is supposed to give him a b**wjob, but the actress refuses to do it. Instead, he supplies us with a voice-over and asks us to pretend that it's happening. Zahedi also gets some laughs from his facial expressions. I'm not sure just how much of this stuff is true (first the actress being a porn star thing, then he later reveals that one actress who's playing a character with a drinking problem actually has a drinking problem.), but it's still pretty damn entertaining. This movie is very funny and very interesting, no matter how perversely. It's one of the best films of it's kind to come out in 2006.

It saddens me, then, that I can't even draw on a lifetime of being in a showbiz family to say one redeeming thing about this... travesty. I would say, ""Love your work!"", but this is unlovable. It takes time, money, let-downs, money, false starts, script issues, talent, and maybe 5-10 years of your life to put a film on a screen.

Woody Allen saw his shot, and gave us 'Annie Hall', from which Mr. Z appropriates clumsily. Yes, he is endearingly bound to not just truth, but the compulsion to broadcast his honesty is hollow -- what he is desperate to ensure the indie fest crowd knows, even if it means boring them to death, is that he's nailed some premium ladies; that even when he blows it with one, another stunner is always in the wings waiting to blow him until he blows yet another relationship.

Production quality: there are security cameras at CVS framed up with care unseen in this thing. Direction: I'm certain Mr. Z figured he could train himself on the job, but one can almost see the crew deserting this mess as it crumbles from its initial 'Dad on first day with a video camera' excitement through a story that rivals Matlock in its sheer lack of necessity to be told over drinks, let alone committing it to the American Canon of Cinema.

Wes Anderson. Jerry Weintraub. Scorsese. John Huston. Francois T. Kurosawa. Woody Allen... these folks are directors who tell stories in pictures brilliantly.
