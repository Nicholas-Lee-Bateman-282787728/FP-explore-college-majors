5795566,5,B00DEYJRSU,"We live in Dsseldorf, Germany, and when we heard about this concert in February, 2013, we immediately bought tickets. 2nd row from the stage, on the aisle.

Neither of us had ever seen Joe Cocker live, though we'd long admired his interpretations and his intenstity and passion when he sings. So, this seemed like a once-in-a-lifetime event not to be missed.

And it was all of that and more.

Not only was Joe Cocker head-on into the music, and hitting every note with such intenstity, but, the band was doing the same thing. I expect that he would expect no less from them. They were incredible, and obviously having a lot of fun at the same time, which always makes for a great time for the audience. Us. And, apparently, everybody else, all 14,000 of us.

And there were cameras all over the place. One on a big boom right in front of us, the spiderman-cam floating all over the auditorium all night, and lots of other cameras, hand-held, and otherwise, which, in total captured all of the best of this extraordinary performance. Kudos to the production crew!

Yes, we were there, and have seen this DVD twice, now, since then.

It is a moment of musical history.

Joe said he would be back to Cologne, as he left the stage, and maybe he will be.

But, I'm just glad that we saw him on that magical night, on a Monday, in April, in Cologne, Germany.

And that an excellent production company filmed that, so, we'll always have it.

Superb! Enjoy!",1380844800,17,1450,4.521072796934866

5795571,1,B00DEYJRSU,"As another reviewer stated, BEWARE, because this disc would not play in my brand new Sony player.  All warning messages were in German.  Three different screens would appear and then the playback would go back to the player's menu.  It would recognize wht the disc was, but would only show 3 screens and never get to the play menu.

Good news is the entire concert is on YOUTUBE in HD so I watched it there after being disappointed that this disc wouldn't play.

5795574,1,B00DEYJRSU,"Great concert!  Unfortunately, like everyone else in the U.S., the Bluray DVD would not play.  How disappointing! This is a simple basic issue and Amazon should care more about the products they carry.  Pull it from the U.S. audience if it doesn't work in the U.S.  Take some responsibility.  I suppose sales are more important than customer satisfaction.  Unfortunately, perhaps Amazon doesn't understand that they are connected.",1447200000,2,430,5.343283582089552

5795578,1,B00DEYJRSU,"Like many other people who bought this fantastic concert on blu ray DVD, I have experienced the same problem: There is sound but no picture - only when you pause or try to go to another song or to the menu. The problem for American customers, I guess, is that although the DVD is region free but the video signal is encoded in PAL format while here in the US most of our hardware uses NTSC. Great music, great performance, however, I cannot play it (with the video) either on my Denon blu ray or on my Pioneer players - only on my PC. I am very disappointed.",1428537600,3,558,4.175925925925926
5795579,4,B00DEYJRSU,"regrettably, the Blu-ray disc was unplayable here in the US......listing did not show that until after I returned mine.... will definitely buy it if they come up with a USA version.....would have been a five star, but, if you can't play it, it's a lost cause.

well, after ordering it three different times, all of which said...""for all regions"" I give up. none will play, and because Iprocratinated, I'm stuck with the last one. Come on Amazon, get your act together and stock one that works.",1421280000,4,493,4.732558139534884
5795580,5,B00DEYJRSU,"A must-have DVD of Joe's last recorded live concert. They pulled out all the plugs when they made this DVD -- HD quality video and sound, and they really capture the wonderful soul and energy of the late, great Joe Cocker and his rock'n band.",1420675200,,242,4.4

5795583,5,B00DEYJRSU,"It's amazing to see Joe Cocker at age 69 perform with such energy.  His voice is vintage Joe Cocker and his soul comes through on all songs here. ""Fire It Up"" is a great title and that's exactly what he does. It's a shame that the idiots who gave this one star don't know the difference between a customer service issue and what they're supposed to rate here.",1419465600,2,359,4.279411764705882
5795584,5,B00DEYJRSU,"Amazon, please get together with Sony and get this DVD / Blu Ray version so that fans in America can buy and watch it.

5795589,1,B00DEYJRSU,"Like many others have written about, I bought one and found it will not play. Watched the concert on youtube for free. It is an awesome event.",1395792000,2,142,4.296296296296297
5795590,1,B00DEYJRSU,"It's supposed to be region free, but the blu-ray did not play in either of my blu-ray players.  So you are taking a chance with this one.  I have two Sony players, both bought in 2013.  Oddly, the blu-ray is published by Sony entertainment.

I returned the blu-ray and bought the DVD.  Again, the DVD did not play in either of my blu-ray players, or a PS2.  However, the DVD worked perfectly fine using my Xbox 360, so I kept it.  Luckily, my 360 is in my living room, where I tend to watch concerts.

As for content, the concert is fantastic- It's a greatest hits compilation with a very enthusiastic audience in attendance.  Audio quality is excellent. Picture quality is so-so on the DVD (a touch pixelated on my 65 inch screen), so it's too bad the blu-ray did not work.

Amazon is great with returns, but this should come with a disclaimer that it may not work.",1395187200,9,866,4.389937106918239
5795591,3,B00DEYJRSU,"I've loved Joe Cocker for decades and was excited to get this DVD. The DVD was used but was in superb condition and came in the mail (like everything else Amazon sells) very quickly.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because Joe is now in his 70's and although he still sounds quite a lot like the old Joe Cocker, he stands still now when he sings, has gained too much weight and can't hit the high notes, which is understandable, but I would have appreciated knowing this before I purchased it because I wouldn't have purchased it.  NO disrespect intended for the beloved Joe Cocker because ALL of us will be there soon.  But if I pay good money for this DVD and get all excited to see it, I expected the old Joe and it sadly wasn't.  Reminded me of when I went to see a Foreigner live concert following Lou Graham's brain surgery.  His ""old voice"" was gone.  He couldn't begin to hit notes he'd been able to sing before and I was left with the same sour taste in my mouth for that too!  It boils down to a kind of ""bait and switch,"" when these performers book their gigs, gather in the hoards of money and then can't deliver the product!",1395187200,,1145,4.200913242009133

5795593,5,B00DEYJRSU,"Joe is proving once more that he still got it ! The concert is very good and I enjoyed it. The Disc itself was well packed along with another DVD I purchased (Eric Clapton:Crossroads) in a bubble envelope which is the most appropriate packaging. Prompt delivery, so overall no complaints.",1392163200,,288,4.78
5795594,5,B00DEYJRSU,So very good to hear and see Joe Cocker once more....and better than ever. He sings from his very soul....and the slower ballads give us a hint of his beautiful heart.,1388534400,2,167,4.419354838709677
5795595,1,B00DEYJRSU,"When it arrived I anxiously placed it in my new Sony Blu-Ray DVD player and a caption immediately announced ' this disc

Sony clarified the problem with playing this on a standard BluRay DVD player..  Though DVD states region free 0 region, it still has to be played on a region free BluRay DVD player to work.

Got it to work, but had to clone it with FabDVD10 and convert to DB9.",1505260800,,448,4.390243902439025
