8439039,5,B004REYDDA,Picture quality...excellent. Top quality packaging. For English speaking viewers Dutch subtitles are removable. Yes...you need an all-region player for these Region 2 DVDs. BUT...there are a number of all-region players for under $50 available right here on Amazon. I think the Phillips I bought cost $30 and change. No...it's not the most deluxe player you might find. All it does is play the DVDs efficiently and without issues.,1471219200,,430,5.338235294117647
