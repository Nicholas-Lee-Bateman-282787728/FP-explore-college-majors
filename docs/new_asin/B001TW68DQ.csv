I had really high hopes for this DVD, but it was a huge let down. Doug isn't Doug without that great fiddling, and you couldn't hear his fiddle. And it seemed to be because they had his mike turned down. The sound was pretty good on Doug's vocals, and was marvelous on everyone else who came up and played a solo; the sound of their violins and horns came through loud and clear. The sound of Doug's fiddle was almost nonexistent, however.
Maybe there was a reason for doing that, I don't know. The set list wasn't very good, either, but I knew that going in. I thought Doug's great fiddle playing would make up for it. It didn't.",1390521600,,818,4.318181818181818
