8182450,5,B000NYRKWO,"I recently came across this film on YouTube quite by accident and am certainly thankful that I did! ""Vedma - the Power of Fear"" is an outstanding 2006 Russian horror film which clearly stands shoulder-to-shoulder with any American-made film of the same genre! (I refer here, not to the senseless ""blood fests"" like the ""Saw"" series of movies, but to the truly sophisticated and utterly frightening films like ""The Grudge,"" ""The Ring,"" or more recently ""Let Me In."") Unfortunately, this DVD is available from Amazon only in Russian, without subtitles, and is formatted for Region 5 - the former Soviet Union. (The US and Canada comprise Region 1.) Nevertheless, some enterprising soul has compiled this film in 10 parts, complete with English subtitles, on YouTube to make this horror masterpiece available for a more global audience. (The English subtitles, however, are a bit  ""off"" in some places: thus, replace ""Evan"" with ""Ivan"" for the main character's name as well as ""crucifixion"" with ""crucifix"" in the climactic battle scene from the film.)

The plotline of ""Vedma"" (a Russian word meaning ""witch"") is relatively straightforward, but quite clever. It is, in fact, a modern adaptation of a 1968 classic Russian horror film entitled ""Viy,"" which, in turn, was a retelling of a short story of the same name by the great nineteenth-century Russian novelist Nikolai Gogel. In ""Vedma,"" a bumbling ""everyman"" named Ivan Berghoff, a sated tabloid journalist, stumbles into a quaint village that contains a dark and menacing secret. Mistaken for the priest whom the inhabitants had requested to relieve them of their ""resident"" evil, Ivan finds himself face-to-face with the full force of the powers of darkness. In the process, this ""ersatz"" priest must face his own paralyzing fear and utter lack of faith. Indeed, ""faith"" -- how to obtain it and how to sustain it -- becomes the pivotal question in this deeply engrossing film. (Ivan's new-found faith is, in fact, sorely tested at the film's conclusion!)

I cannot praise this film enough! The acting is priceless, with full accolades going to Valery Nikolaev as Ivan. His performance is most convincing and of the highest caliber, as his character reluctantly transforms from playboy journalist to faithful exorcist in the course of the film. The stunningly beautiful Russian actress Yevgenia Kryukova gives an equally powerful performance as Merryl, the vampire-like vixen, who is Ivan's evil nemesis. Although her character rarely speaks, her facial expressions -- both in the ""sleep"" of the undead and in her ""waking"" moments -- are truly breathtaking. ""Vedma's"" special effects, camera movement and angles, and cinematography, moreover, are also essential ingredients to the film's success. Lastly, the soundtrack adds perfectly to the ""gothic"" ambience of ""Vedma"". In fact, the Gothic instrumental band Nox Arcana has created an outstanding tribute to ""Vedma"" in its music video of the song ""Night of the Wolf,"" which is also available on YouTube!

Sadly, this priceless Russian horror film is now available from Asylum Home Entertainment only in a poorly dubbed and badly edited Americanized version entitled ""Evil"" (2008). Hopefully, some American distributor will pick up ""Vedma"" and reissue it in the full Russian version with English subtitles. Then ""Vedma"" can rightly receive a wider viewing audience and earn the critical praise which it fully deserves!

UPDATE: Apparently, YouTube has removed the 10-part video series of Vedma mentioned above! What a tragedy! I did find the complete version of Vedma with Spanish subtitles. Unfortunately, my Spanish is not proficient enough to keep up with fast-moving subtitles! The music video of ""Night of the Wolf"" by Nox Arcana is still available; the latter will provide you with a tantalizing ""taste"" of one of the greatest horror films ever made!",1322524800,6,3859,5.247974068071313
