4472042,5,B004UXUVM0,"Some reviewers were negative about this movie but I think it was funny.  Take it for what it is.  It's a low budget, slapstick funny movie.  Don't expect something like the Godfather with Al Pacino.",1356825600,,198,4.6
4472043,4,B004UXUVM0,"I actually would rate this closer to a 3 star, but I feel the need to offset the 1 star reviews.  If you are into mafia movies...fuhgettaboutit...this is NOT 'The Godfather'.  If you are a fan of the new 'Three Stooges' movie (or the old ones for that matter) then you will probably enjoy this flick.

The story is about a son trying to earn his father's respect with a 'Romeo and Juliet' sub-plot.  The jokes and gags are so ridiculous you can't help but laugh.  This movie is family-friendly (except for the tommy gun fight between the mob families), there is no blood and gore, no 'adult' language and no vulgar jokes.  There is a scene where the son is chasing his hat down the street (actually kicking it away)...Charlie Chaplin style.  This movie is stupid, but so stupid it's funny!

The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the Korean son looks to be about the same age as Harvey Keitel.  And since Asians age better than white folks, that means he's like, 102.",1355097600,,978,4.449438202247191
4472044,5,B004UXUVM0,This was such a funny movie!  I love John Pinette and ordered this because he was in it.  We had a great family night watching this one!,1354838400,,136,4.0
4472045,1,B004UXUVM0,"There are movies made that are so bad they're good. That is to say they are made with the intent of being a good movie but due to budget constraints, over acting and other variables, they end up being really bad movies...that viewers can enjoy by laughing at them. And then there are just really bad movies like THE LAST GODFATHER.

Harvey Keitel (completely wasted here) stars as Don Carini, a Mafioso who is in his declining years and has decided to pass on the title of Don. Tony V (Michael Rispoli) seems the logical choice, the right hand man of the Don for many years. So you can imagine his surprise to learn that the Don had a son years ago that he kept away from everything to protect him.

That son is Young-gu (Hyung-rae Shim), the love child that Don Carini had when he was in hiding in Korea. Young-gu's mother took a bullet for the Don and to protect his son he placed him in an orphanage that he took care of. Now grown, Young-gu is brought to America to take over his father's empire. The problem is that when you say Young-gu is innocent it doesn't completely describe him. He's a bumbling idiot.

The Don's men can't believe their eyes. This is the man they are supposed to follow. The Don puts Tony and his sidekick Macho (John Pinette) in charge of educating Young-gu in the business. They start with loan sharking and Young-gu can't get the hang of it. When they try to teach him to defend himself he does so more by accident than by intent.

On one job they take him along on, Young-gu meets Nancy Bonfante (Jocelin Donahue), an attractive young woman he inadvertently saves from a supposed mugger. The two fall in love unaware that her father is Don Bonfante (Jon Polito) and has been at war for years with Don Carini. It's Romeo and Juliet...sort of.

Trouble happens when Don Bonfante's right hand man Vinnie (a totally out of place Jason Mewes) decides to make his move and take over the family. Wanting Nancy for himself he starts a fight between the two families that ends in a gun battle where few if anyone gets hit by even a stray bullet. So who wins? Who cares!

The movie is filled with slapstick style comedy that has been done, redone and overdone for years. The pranks seen on screen were done by Red Skelton back in the sixties on television and offer nothing new here. Movies which feature an innocent character who is a total idiot are insulting to viewers unless the film is intended perhaps for children. But this movie is filled with gun battles between gangsters, a love story of sorts and all sorts of things not intended for kids. That makes it too adult for kids and too stupid for adults. So who's this movie for then?

Let's put it this way. If you took the NUTTY PROFESSOR films of Eddie Murphy or even his DR. DOOLITTLE films, both family friendly series, and placed them against this movie they would see like Oscar contenders. This movie is THAT bad. If you were to rent this movie for $1 at a Redbox you are spending too much for it. This movie is so bad that they should pay YOU to watch it.",1332806400,3,3045,4.397868561278863
4472046,4,B004UXUVM0,Its a comedy NOT a real gangster flick. Its pretty funny! Jason Mewes did well and Hyung-Rae Shim was hilarious as Harvey Keitel son. Was worth the money spent on the rental.,1315699200,3,174,4.46875
4472047,1,B004UXUVM0,"Short attention span summary:

1. Why, Harvey Keitel, WHY???

Intended for immature audiences only, this movie tells the tale of Younggu, the illegitimate son of a mafia boss and his Korean lover, raised by nuns and eventually brought to the US to become his father's successor.

Slapstick of the worst kind ensues, leading to premature theatre departure.

The trailer gives a hint of what can be expected, but the movie is far, far, far worse than you can imagine.  Instead of watching this, send a cheque to Harvey Keitel so he never has to make a movie like this, EVER again.

4472342,2,B004UXUVM0,"The Last Godfather (2010) is a light comedy, skillfully crafted
such that it  won't offend even the most sensitive audiences,
considering the touchy subject-matter( the underworld, and mob.)

 The technical aspects of filming are excellent, such as the
 time-pieces (automobiles, buildings, neighborhoods recreated as
 with the  restaurants, fruit and vegetable stores, tailors and
 men's wear stores, etc)

The music is also very good in recreating the Brooklyn section of
New York from as far back as 150 years ago.

Conversely, the acting, pace and  agility of the dialog  is often
lacking in subtlety and sophistication. In factor, it is often-times
reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin's clumsy style seen in his silent
pictures, played here by  Hyung-rae Shim, who is a top star in
Korea.

Another weakness, for example, is that at no time does the audience
take at face-value the notion that Shim's character is actually
HK's own progeny.

In fact, given HK's occasional struggles in naturally expressing
emotion (unless, with effort, etc)  this challenge is made even
more obvious, considering that Shim's acting style  appears
afflicted in this aspect to a much larger degree, slowing down the
film's momentum and sequences.

Conversely, the other  actors all do  a fine job on this one, such
as  Michael Rispoli, Jocelin Donahue, Jon Polito  and the known
food comedian John Pinette, reprising his gig relating to food and
eating.

For the harsher critics, this picture may reach the groveling
level in regards to those who enjoy films based in the New York of
the 18th and 19th centuries;  for the others, this work is
amusing  and mildly interesting. 1.5 stars",1388707200,,1666,5.153558052434457
