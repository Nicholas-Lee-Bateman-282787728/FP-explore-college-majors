8617211,5,B00FNPQWAO,"I love StoryCorps, and I often go to their website to listen to stories. It really is an oral history of the people of the US, with all our differences and similarities. I had already seen some of the animations online, but it's wonderful to revisit them along with new ones on the dvd. It's a gem!",1412726400,2,298,4.245614035087719
