8526330,2,B0089EW57A,"I bought this DVD along with the follow up based on the reviews here and the only conclusion I can draw is the publishing company paid fans of Television to write reviews.  This DVD is not good and will only make you neurotic like poor Richard Lloyd, the tortured and disheveled tutor in this DVD.

First off, the title of the DVD gives it away, ""Alchemical.""  News flash, not one Alchemist in the history of humanity ever turned lead into gold and they spent their whole life at it, so you know this DVD is selling something impossible.  What I learned playing guitar is that, ""shortcuts,"" take a long time to learn and are not musical.  Needless to write, this DVD does not teach any shortcuts either.

I gave it two stars because there are points where something he says is valuable but, but, but he says it in passing so you'll miss it.  For example, he throws out the comment, ""but actually you are changing keys when you are changing modes.""  That is the wisest most valuable thing he could have ever investigated in this DVD but he just says it briefly in passing.  If you know the concept that each mode is relative to the ionian (major scale) in different keys then all you have to do is learn all SEVEN fingering patterns of the ionian and you have just learned all the modes...now, how you use them musically is the goal of music so no DVD is going to teach you that.

There are other nuggets out there of things he says briefly but it just isn't worth it.  I don't find using numbers in music helpful, it will just make you neurotic like poor Lloyd.  I get what he is doing with the numbers, intervals which he doesn't explain, but, but, but in my opinion that is what your ears are for...believe it or not music involves the ears, so you may benefit from working on that instead.  As for his other fretboard suggestions, well they can be easily answered by learning the notes on the fretboard then there is much less mystery and much less to memorize.  Sometimes taking a longer road is the shortest and most musical road.

My suggestion to you is if you are buying this DVD to learn the fretboard, I suggest you instead by a tutor on Lessonface.com.  If you don't want to spend $30 a week on personalized tutoring from a musician who went to music school then I would not play guitar; there are other hobbies out there.",1461542400,,2333,4.390697674418605
8526331,4,B0089EW57A,"Lloyd's material can be a tad esoteric, and not all of it is going to directly translate to something you can use while playing -- but the lessons and videos will help deepen your understanding of the fret board and how notes are connected across it.",1448236800,,250,4.456521739130435
8526332,3,B0089EW57A,"this CD might be okay, but I couldn't tell because I didn't finish watching it. The author was a guitarist with the punk era band Television, and may be a great guitarist but he lost me with his meandering talking and esoteric references. He opens the video by separating the guitar neck and strings into sections in a way I never heard before and talks so rapidly with no explanation of what he is talking about that I didn't understand a thing, and I am an intermediate guitarist with a good foundation in theory. Like I said in the beginning, it may be a great video but I just couldn't get into it. UPDATE: After reading the other reviews, it looks like a lot of people had some WTF moments in the beginning but they said to stick with it and watch it a few times so I will respect their advice and try again.",1441152000,2,813,4.251612903225807
8526333,5,B0089EW57A,"As someone who has played for around 30 years, I was often embarrassed by how little I knew about the fretboard.  Sure, I could write songs and come up with complimentary parts when playing with like-minded people, but I could never shake that feeling that I really should know more.  Being a Television fan, this DVD was an easy sell.  Richard's style takes a little getting used to, and his personality may not suit everyone.  Personally, I found him very entertaining and his teaching style really opened a new world for me.  Granted, it probably took about 6 or 8 viewings of the first couple of episodes before I even started to understand what he was going on about, but once the idea of intervals really sunk in, and the cyclical nature of scales, I was able to move pretty quickly.

One caveat is that there are some mistakes here and there (especially with the counting while playing), and he tends to jump into certain subjects from the view of someone who knows a lot more rather than a beginner (I'm talking about dealing with these concepts, not a beginner guitarist).  The fact that I was able to even catch these mistakes, though, is because I understood and used the earlier lessons.  So be prepared to watch these over and over again, because that's where the beauty lies.  It's like watching someone paint something and what looks like just a bunch of colors gradually comes into focus.  As someone else mentioned, the columns are on the DVD, so you can put it in your computer and print it out.  There are some mistakes in there as well, though, so if something doesn't make sense after reading it a dozen times, it may be because it's not right (remember ""1526374"" and ""1473625"").",1438560000,,1700,4.614617940199335
8526334,5,B0089EW57A,"The title of my review says it all. These lessons are packed with valuable information on how the fretboard is laid out. The cycle of fourths and fifths are very thoroughly explained, which are invaluable to know, and if learned, will seriously open things up as far as musical knowledge, especially given the way the guitar is tuned. Richard Lloyd is very knowledgeable as a teacher. Yes, he is a bit quirky, but so many great musicians are anyway. The way he presents things are a bit unorthodox, but if you study the lessons enough with an open mind, eventually things click and really sink in. I haven't gone through all the lessons yet, but already my knowledge of the fretboard has DEFINITELY grown. This is NOT a group of lessons full of technique exercises. What is presented here will help you greatly with theory and really knowing your way around the fretboard. That will make learning songs and riffs easier, and will facilitate with unlocking your own musical creativity, which in a way is more valuable than learning someone else's songs. There is great stuff to learn here!",1419984000,3,1088,4.761904761904762

8526336,5,B0089EW57A,"You will be shocked and pleased at how far you advance if you follow Richard Lloyd's ""The Alchemical Guitarist"" DVD (and its companion, Vol. 2.)

At first, youll probably be curled into a big ol' ball of ""WTF."" Pythagoras? String length ratios? Telephone numbers? Wormholes? God vs. Lucifer? ""Agricultural-cadabra???""

But I implore you to stick with it. Lloyd (a founding member of the seminal 70's rock band Television) is an engaging and unorthodox teacher. It is precisely that unorthodoxy that lifts these lessons off the screen and gets them under your fingers  and into your marrow.

Lloyd demonstrates musical laws that are immutable - and then breaks those laws down into their most individual pieces. It's then up to you to put those pieces back together as you apply them to the fretboard. Before you know it, you'll be gliding up and down the neck vertically, bashing through the 'boxes,' and applying the modes in MUSICAL fashion (and not in the flat manner in which they are presented in other materials.) I learned more in two weeks about modes and their application with ""TAG"" than I did in the past twenty five years from other guitar methods.

WARNING: This is not a licks method; if that's what you're looking for, move on. The Alchemical Guitarist is heavy on intervallic knowledge, and pounds on moving it all through the cycles of fourths and fifths. Some parts are really, really tough. (Don't overlook: the printed materials are embedded in the DVD.)

But here's the carrot: Each DVD has 12 lessons. Spend a solid week working through each lesson, and guaranteed, you WILL be an improved guitarist at the end of 12 weeks; even better after 24. Then, repeat and apply  with the stuff you already know and a push from Richard Lloyd, you'll be well on the road to finding your OWN voice as a guitarist and musician.

And THAT, my fellow Amazonian axe-wielders, is the source of the real alchemy.

Isnt that better than an umpteenth copy of  Stevie Page ClaptoBecks 50 Hottest Licks?",1412726400,4,2003,4.813411078717201
8526337,4,B0089EW57A,Great information. Just takes time to get the ideas and concepts into your mind and under your fingers.,1412121600,,103,4.777777777777778
8526338,5,B0089EW57A,"Richard Lloyd is a genius! With this book, I learned the modes in under one hour. I am also able to move freely around the fretboard with pentatonic scales. This system is no joke. Be warned...it may take a few read throughs and watching the video a couple times to really grasp the concept, but once you do it will unlock your endless potential.",1395878400,3,346,4.421875
