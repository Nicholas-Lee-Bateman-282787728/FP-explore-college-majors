8174360,1,B000N3AMVG,"This one is a stinker!!  The cover of the DVD box has the best picture of battleships that you will see in the whole thing.  I was looking for footage of the pre-war battleline showing the capital units of the US Navy at the height of their power.  Unfortunately, there is precious little actual footage of the battleships from the 1920's or 1930's.  NOT for the battleship enthusiast !!",1335052800,5,387,4.565217391304348

8174362,5,B000N3AMVG,"If you have an interest in the old USN, this dvd can't be beat. Some historic footage can be rough, but where are you going to see Admiral Dewey's hero's return from the Spanish-American war to the USA along with his fleet. Or cruising on a USN gunboat in 1920's China. The real ""Sand Pebbles"". A couple of clips didn't especially intrigue me, but I would say, 90% did.

A time machine documentary worth viewing again and again.",1217462400,4,428,4.487179487179487
