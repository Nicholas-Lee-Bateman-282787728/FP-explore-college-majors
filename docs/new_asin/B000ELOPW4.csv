8597501,1,B000ELOPW4,Finley was once the biggest producer of National Park films. But this was decades ago. Today the basement of his company is build on a handful of Blu-Rays. The rest is old VHS footage from the 90s and 80s poorly transfered on DVD like this one here. Greenish 4:3 picture throughout. And believe it or not .. sometimes it looks like they inserted 8mm footage. Don't support these guys anymore. They became lazy 20 years ago. But they try to cash in as long as possible. Sad.,1426377600,,473,4.448275862068965
8597502,1,B000ELOPW4,"Don't waste your money purchasing this video.  Images are grainy and for a supposed 2002 production according to the info on the case, it is a re-release of a 1985 production.  This DVD does NOT display well on a high def TV.  It really isn't worth a One Star rating and should be priced under $3.50 -- perhaps that way you won't feel you've been cheated.",1221696000,,355,4.348484848484849
