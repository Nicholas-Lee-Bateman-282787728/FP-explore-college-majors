1931694,4,B0000E32V2,"In a movie with Jean Reno and Juliette Binoche, the best acting here comes - as usual - from Sergi Lopez.  He gets 5 - 7 minutes in a powerful cameo, in which he almost comes through the screen with intensity.

That aside, this is a charming, melancholy movie, but one a bit undermined - as usual - by its US coverbox.  From the frothy picture of the two stars there, you'd get the impression of a screwball-like comedy.  It's far from that.  While there are some comedic aspects, 'Jet Lag' is all about the serendipitous meeting of two lonely people hitting major inflection points in their lives.  American audiences know Binoche from 'Chocolat' and other US-made films.  The treat here is Reno, flying mostly under the radar in the US marketplace expect for suporting roles in 'Mission Impossible' and 'Ronin'.  He is superlative as a world-weary chef/business owner.",1093305600,2,870,4.791946308724833
1931695,2,B0000E32V2,"Jet Lag proves that just because it's in French, doesnt mean it's good. The movie is dull and looks like a French version of an American romantic comedy. If there was an American version, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan would star in it. There are so many good French movie, Jet Lag isn't one of them.",1087948800,5,292,4.232142857142857
1931696,3,B0000E32V2,"***1/2 ""Jet Lag"" is a French romantic comedy that takes place almost entirely in an airport terminal and an airport hotel.  Juliette Binoche and Jean Reno are two strangers who meet at the Paris airport and end up sharing a room when all flights are cancelled due to an air traffic controllers strike (think of how this affair would have been thwarted had Reagan been France's president at the time!).  Rose and Felix are both riddled with insecurities and anxieties, having been largely unlucky in the ways of love.  Yet, after some predictable initial tension between them, they somehow manage to find a mutual strength - and attraction - in their combined weaknesses.
""Jet Lag"" is so simple and unassuming in its early stages that we are amazed to discover, about a third of the way through, just how completely it has managed to sneak up on us and win us over.  Unlike most American romantic comedies, ""Jet Lag"" allows its characters to actually talk and get to know one another.  It sure doesn't hurt, of course, that Binoche and Reno are such talented, attractive performers who establish an astonishing rapport in their scenes together.  Sure, the plotting isn't exactly believable, but when is that ever the case in a film of this type anyway?  The thing that matters is that we like the people we have become involved with and that we can accept, if only for just a moment, the possibility that they might be able to find happiness together.  That is certainly the case in this film.  (If there is a criticism to be leveled against the film, it is that it is simply too short, clocking in at barely over 80 minutes.  How many films can one say THAT about?).
""Jet Lag"" could have been a completely insubstantial little film; instead, it resonates with a joyfulness and charm that truly captivate the viewer.  This is a winner well worth checking out.",1084665600,21,1858,4.686153846153847
1931697,4,B0000E32V2,"This is a French movie, but modern French - as in French Kiss- with delightful acting, bright, well developed dialogue, and a plot which keeps you hoping the whole time and doesn't disappoint.  The recipes...

What makes the movie are Juliet Binoche, which looks great without meakup (in the beginning of the movie she looks almost American)and Jean Reno is great as in all his movies.
All in all it is a fun and interesting movie to watch.",1082246400,2,439,4.569620253164557
1931699,4,B0000E32V2,"In JET LAG two strangers meet under unusual circumstances in a crowded and chaotic Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. As a result of various labor union strikes flights are either delayed or cancelled while travelers are impatient and nerves are frayed. Rose first approaches Felix in the airport terminal to borrow his phone after she accidentally dropped her cell phone down the toilet. There is certainly no ""love at first sight"" for these two individuals, and they even succeed in getting on each other's nerves. But each time they say goodbye they end up bumping into each other at a different time and place in the airport. Each appears to have little in common Felix and Rose have little in common other than being stuck in an airport. Felix is a twice-divorced idiosyncratic man who has immigrated to New York and detests everything about his native country. On the other hand, Rose is a woman who feels naked without makeup and is escaping an abusive boyfriend. But as time progresses they warm up to each other and form a meaningful friendship. What really makes this film work is that they form a bond based on their differences and they begin to appreciate and understand each other's lived experiences. Their relationship isn't based on lust and sex but rather delves deeper into emotional longing to be understood and affirmed in the modern world. As the film progresses they become more connected and appreciated in each other's company. In JET LAG Juliette Binoche delivers another wonderful performance that his indicative of her successful film career in French cinema. It is always a pleasure to watch her perform as she rarely plays the same character repeatedly. This film is fun to watch and is a good diversion for a cozy night inside in front of the television. JET LAG is described as a ""romantic comedy"" but I believe it delves deeper and says volumes more than other films in this genre. Enjoy!",1076198400,3,1922,4.827272727272727
1931700,4,B0000E32V2,"JET LAG is a rare treat.  It is a smart, saucy film that takes two well known actors and gives then a chance to play different types and the result is very successful.
Juliette Binouche steps into the tacky clothes and glitzy makeup of a superficial loquacious beautician who needs her makeup, perfumes, and wacky clothes to complete her 'self', an unlucky-at-love waif on her way to Acapulco from the Charles DeGaulle airport.  She encounters a neurotic, fastidious (except for his groungy hair and beard) chef play by the usually dark 'hitman' Jean Reno and because of strikes in the Paris airlines and trains preventing scheduled flights, she agrees to share a room wiht him for the night until their separate flights are available.  Well, of course, the 'odd couple' find subtle but strong needs in the opposite persons  and the way their rather bizarre cohabitation results in their mutual and individual awakenings is the source of the plot and the delight for the viewer. Both Binouche and Reno create indelible characters and their transformations are wise and wonderful.. A definite 'feel good' movie - and we certainly need films like this as warm entertainment.  Kudos to director Danielle Thompson for uncovering other layers in these two fine actors' gifts.",1074902400,10,1270,5.0285714285714285

1931769,3,B0000E32V2,It's a French movie with a Hollywood ending. There are so many unlikely situations and bad interactions that it is amazing the two of them even get it on. It's not really a comedy as much a tragedy -- I did like their performances and that is what kept me hanging on.,1316563200,,267,4.153846153846154
1931770,4,B0000E32V2,"Juliet Binoche is ""Rose"", a beautician waiting for a flight to a new job and life in Acapulco, Mexico. Her ""baggage"" is a boyfiend (Sergi Lopez) in bad need of an anger management class.  Jean Reno is ""Felix,"" a confirmed misanthrope, on his way to a funeral in Munich for the mother of an ex-wife.  His ""baggage"" is his father, a master French chef of fine cuisine living in Burgundy. The father's constant disapproval of Felix's cuisine inventions has discouraged Felix from being a fine cuisine chef himself.

Felix is a successful but much less than happy frozen food executive with two failed relationships with women when he meets Rose. Both Felix and Rose are stranded in a Paris airport for the night due to a transit strike, faulty airline computers, and bad weather. Felix loans Rose his cellphone when they accidentally bump into each other as strangers.

Most of the inter-personal drama between Rose and Felix takes place at the airport Hilton where Felix is put up for the night by the airline because he is flying first class.  He reluctantly invites Binoche, who gives a first impression of being nothing more than cosmetic, to share the room non-romantically after he sees her trying to settle down to sleep in seats in the airport and takes pity on her.

Casting Binoche as a beautician whose life revolves around makeup is inspired. It gives the camera many opportunities to persistently focus on one of the most beautiful faces in modern cinema.  Even when she takes her makeup off Binoche is an exquisite beauty. She is also a surprisingly good romantic comic.

The deep-voiced Reno manages to look jet-lagged, world-weary, and handsome all at the same time. His Felix finds Binoche by turns mundane and fascinating. Her homespun wisdom changes him, of course, for the better. True love cannot be denied even though we see a couple so seemingly poorly matched at the beginning of the movie.

If you don't mind English subtitles in this French film it is well worth adding to your collection.  The musical director even manages to effectively slip in a little of the plaintive music from ""Midnight Cowboy"" toward the end of the movie. This film is highly romantic and entertaining.  It is also priced right on Amazon.",1240876800,2,2237,4.829842931937173
1931771,5,B0000E32V2,"One of my perennial romantic comedy favorites, this French film is delightful. The sets, as well as the characters, are very colorful and the actors who play them (Jean Reno and Juliette Binoche) are marvelous. This movie is always a lovely rewatch. The only lamenting thing about rewatching it is realizing how pitifully and dully Hollywood makes romantic comedies.",1200182400,9,366,5.220338983050848
1931822,3,B0000E32V2,"""Dcalage horaire"" (2002) aka Jet Lag was the third film written/directed by Daniele Thompson that I've seen. It may not be as marvelous as La Bche (1999), her directorial debut or charming  and delightful as Fauteuils d'orchestre (2006), her latest film but it is definitely worth seeing for the wonderful acting by two fine French actors, Juliette Binoche  and Jean Reno who both  played against their types. Binoche does not appear often in the comedies and Reno is not well known as a romantic lead but they were pleasure to watch in the light romantic dramedy that takes place in the famous Paris Charles de Gaulle airport one long rainy night when all flights were grounded by weather and a baggage strike. Two strangers meet by chance, when Rose (Binoche) who had accidentally flushed her cell phone in a toilet, asks a perfect stranger, Felix (Reno), to use his phone. They are both professionally successful. He is a chef who made a fortune in the frozen-food business, and she has won a golden brush, the equivalent of Pulitzer Prize for the make-up artists. Their personal lives are the mess. Each has the problems, disappointments, unsatisfying or unfinished relationships by the time of their first encounter. She flees from her abusive boyfriend of 12 years (Sergio Lopes is memorably scary in a tiny cameo). He still can't recover from his previous relationship and suffers from anxiety attacks. Perhaps, 81 minutes is not enough to convince us that these two flawed and insecure individuals will overcome their past and live happily ever after but Binoche and Reno masterfully and elegantly created on the  screen the possibility of love and readiness to accept it.

1931823,3,B0000E32V2,"Fans of foreign cinema might find more to love in this movie than I did. It's watchable but not much more. It does give a perceptive viewer the unique opportunity of hearing a French actor speak his native language with an American accent, though. (Think Pepe Le Pew in reverse.) As we watch Juliette Binoche transform herself from a stranger to our eyes, buried as she was at first beneath a cocoon of makeup with her hair densely piled atop her head, back to the actress audiences are more familiar with, the movie itself begins to seem warmer and the two lost souls who unexpectedly meet in an airport fall almost plausibly in love. As a sort of public service message to those who rent and buy French films based on an expectation of seeing skin, Jet Lag lacked the copious nudity that keeps many Americans going through subtitled foreign movies but a little bit was gratuitously slipped in almost as an afterthought. Jet Lag wasn't bad or very good either, and if my review doesn't take it seriously, then note that my impression was that the actors in it didn't either.",1191110400,2,1075,4.604166666666667

But like most french films, as the story went on, the characters came to life. I began to understand them, their choices, their situations, their intentions, and their past. This movie is a Woody Allen type of me -- not much happens, but nothing much needs to...it's about the deep intimacy you develop with the characters. Great movie.",1179446400,2,506,4.571428571428571
1931826,5,B0000E32V2,"Two people with nothing in common stuck at an airport? I know it might sound kinda boring, but this film has much more going on under the surface, much like our 2 main characters.

Don't be fooled by the ""oh we're having so much fun"" (which I am assuming is an American-ized) dvd cover, and if you've seen the American/English preview, it is just as misleading.

Juliette Binoche and Jean Reno serve wonderful performances as two people who are struggling with their very livestyles and personal problems.  Initially they are not impressed with the other person but as this story grows, so does their realization that a book cannot be judged by its cover.

It is exciting watching them challenge one another, and each character takes what they have learned in order to find the courage to take giant steps in improving their lives.

I would not call this a comedy, nor a drama. Its a ""dramedy"", more like. Funny at points, dramatic, sad, romantic, and real. If you dislike the rubbish that Hollywood churns out, please check out this film. C'est magnifique!",1172102400,10,1057,4.754098360655738

1931828,3,B0000E32V2,"Jetlag began life as a high-concept Hollywood romcom before becoming a French vehicle for Jean Reno and Juliette Binoche. Similarities to 'One Fine Day' notwithstanding, this is pretty much 'Avanti' in an airport, albeit without Wilder's wit or romanticism. Reno is the Jack Lemmon substitute, an uptight chef-turned-frozen-dinner-company-owner in a hurry to reach his ex's grandmother's funeral while Binoche takes the Juliet Mills role as the working class beautician. When their planes are constantly delayed and they find themselves sharing a hotel room... fill in the blanks. It's not particularly good and wildly over-reliant on starpower to hide the gaps in the script, but it's a watchable soaper which does have one nice scene in a hotel kitchen when Reno cooks dinner while revealing family secrets (the equivalent of the nude swim in 'Avanti' where the two characters' barriers finally come down). Thin stuff even at the 81-minute mark (seven of which are credits), but it just about manages to fill the gap between real movies.

The transfer is acceptable but although the film was shown in theaters in 2.35:1, once the titles are over the film is presented 1.85:1.",1119052800,4,1177,5.1947368421052635
