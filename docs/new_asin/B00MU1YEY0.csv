Wasn't sure what to expect as I love Fluffy and ordered without looking at reviews. The first part of the movie is dramatization of Fluffy's early life and then morphs into a stand-up performance. Enjoyed the movie and hope to someday see him in person...",1435536000,,272,4.666666666666667

6601025,5,B00MU1YEY0,"You had me at Fluffy!

I've not only seen all of his comedy specials, but have been fortunate enough to have seen him in person several times.  I feel like I'm a member of the family as well, since we've heard so much about them during his shows.

I can't remember the last time that I laughed so hard while watching a show, only to sob uncontrollably at the end.

Gracias Fluffy for sharing such a poignant moment with us.  Anyone who is a stepparent will surely appreciate the open heart that Fluffy has and how he shares it with us.

I'm going to wait 30 years!",1434931200,,564,4.224299065420561

6601027,3,B00MU1YEY0,"I was a little disappointed. This DVD really didn't do it for me. I have all 3 of the previous fluffy DVDs and was disappointed to see many of the jokes and material from those previous dvds recycled in this one. As much as I love Gabriel Iglesias, I just can't give it a higher rating than 3 stars.",1434758400,,299,4.084745762711864
6601028,5,B00MU1YEY0,"When Fluffy said in a previous special that he talks about stuff that happens in his life...the Fluffy Movie takes it to a poignant level.  This not to say it was not funny, it definitely was.  But you get to see how he handled a major event in his life.

Well done.",1434672000,,266,4.076923076923077
6601029,4,B00MU1YEY0,Another great comedy show from Gabriel Iglesias very heartfelt and loved all his stories from his heart to the audience.  Not much difference between extended and regular version maybe 13 minutes total extra.  I want spoil anyting but one of main stories that really touch my heart was about his father coming to visit him and second story fact his stepson sees Gabriel Iglesias as his real father after being there for his mother and him all theses years.  But basically if you loved his way of making stories into joke form and sound effects which I do alot then pick this new special up and be prepare to laugh very hard threwout the whole thing one of his better specials.  For those who have been giving this one and two star ratings are not watching it with an open mind and open heart.  You can't watch this whole special and not feel anything because it does hit home and makes you feel something in your heart and emotions.  Only one joke I felt went over the edge during the special thats why gave it a four star rating and that was the bit about the German fans giving him a hard time during one of his specials and I was like oh my God did he really just say that line during the special made my jaw drop open.  But yeah add this to your comedy collection full of laughs and stories that will touch your heart.,1434499200,,1322,4.306451612903226
6601030,4,B00MU1YEY0,This was a pretty funny story of Gabriel Iglesias' career in standup.  One gets to see that he is human and can laugh at himself.  We really enjoyed it.,1433721600,,152,4.206896551724138
6601031,5,B00MU1YEY0,Lots of laughs,1432944000,,14,4.0
6601042,1,B00MU1YEY0,"Terrible, he is normally very good. Very disapointed",1432857600,,52,5.625
6601043,5,B00MU1YEY0,"How ""Fluffy"" has maintained not crossing the line into the ""Depths of the Vulgar and Obscene"" is beyond me. While some material can be Adult rated, compared to all other Comedy it is MILD to say the least. I wanted to see this in the Theater when it first came out but I was reluctant to because I didn't have the confidence it would meet up to standards of the rest of his DVD line and specials.
  This went above and beyond it's expectations.

SPOILER ALERT:

If you never saw this before stop here and read after you watch.
There is something Genuine and Genius about someone who can make you laugh so hard you literally cry. Even better is to laugh even though you are shedding a tear from sadness that is revealed. Reminded me of Classic TV shows that had that knack of doing so, for example, MASH, ALL IN THE FAMILY, FAMILY TIES, and many others.

This solidified Fluffy as my all time favorite Comedian, knocking off many others including Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams, Ellen DeGeneres.",1432080000,,1004,4.524861878453039

Maybe he's just becoming too much of a family man.  This stuff is pretty boring.  I wasn't even interested enough watch it all at once, and in the end, I didn't finish it.  The dieting stuff was boring.  What was supposed to be funny about the stuff about meeting his father?  And that his kid is spoiled?

6601118,3,B00MU1YEY0,"I had never even heard of Gabriel Iglesias before I read a brief blurb about this DVD, ""The Fluffy Movie"".  I then noted he's released quite a few DVD's prior to this one.  For anyone unfamiliar with him like I was before watching, here is some idea of what to expect:

He did a ""world tour"" (I don't know exactly how many countries were included in that) with a theme of ""Unity Through Laughter"".
This DVD is mostly comprised of his stand-up act in the San Francisco Bay area, which seems to have been near the end of the
world tour from what I could gather.

For a certain group of fans, he and even his manager are famous.  I'm thinking many of those fans must be Hispanic-American, as this is his background.  He describes having been raised by a single mother on welfare and section 8 housing.  Then through whatever combination of talent and good fortune, he managed to become quite successful as a comedian.  However, his life often consists of around 42 weeks of traveling for performances, out of 52 weeks in the year.

His act is not so much funny (at least for me) as it is very sincere and engaging.  He describes the struggles of his life in (sometimes excruciating) detail, and many of them are struggles that a lot of other people are familiar with.  He has a girlfriend or common-law wife with whom he lives, who had a son (age 16 at the time of this performance) from a prior relationship, that Gabriel has raised like his own child since he started staying with the kid's mother.

He describes the problems of trying to communicate with a 16 year old son.
He describes the unexpected trauma of a father that you never knew suddenly wanting to see you and get to know you.  In his case, he hadn't seen his own father for 30 years.  In his step-son's case, he hadn't seen his father for most of his 16 years.

He discusses how he's been trying to manage morbid obesity (he was up to 445 lbs) and diabetes, after his doctor told him that if something didn't change, he wouldn't be alive for another 2 years.  He was then referred for possible gastric bypass surgery, but when the surgeon learned that he spends most of his time ""on the road"" eating at fast-food type places, he was judged a poor candidate for surgery, leaving him wondering how soon he'd die.  He then went on a low-carb diet.....

He describes his tour of India, prominently including a few rowdy (probably drunk) German guests who were heckling him from the front aisle.

His language is tame compared to most comedians, though he sometimes indicates a sexual act with hand-gestures.

I hope this DVD remains popular and perhaps inspires some other people to pay more attention to chronic medical conditions like obesity, type II diabetes and hypertension.  Certainly there is a quite high incidence of diabetes in Hispanic-Americans...

Overall I give this a C+.  It's hardly the funniest stand-up comedy I've seen, but as far as stand-up ""let's talk about real life problems"", it's actually pretty good.",1423353600,,2989,4.59811320754717
6601119,5,B00MU1YEY0,Truly funny and always manages to at least make me fall out of my chair at least once. His humor is more of a real world situation type of humor more than anything else.,1423267200,,169,4.0

6601136,5,B00MU1YEY0,Great show. Incredible storyteller. On his way to being this generations Carlin!,1422144000,,80,5.75
6601137,2,B00MU1YEY0,"Ive been a fan of Gabriel Iglasias for a long time.  The way he tells a story is really like no other mainstream comedian working today.  He just has this relaxed knack for making his stories so relatable.  When Fluffy talks, its as if were in his living room, sitting on his couch with our hands in a bowl of potato chips and our attention firmly set on his moving lips.  He just has that effortless quality.

It also doesnt hurt that his stories are funny.  He has a normal life with an abnormal job, and the two make for some really relatable and inspired stories.

But this just didn't work for me.

Its hard to decide how to review a comedy special, because there isn't a plot, but a collection of stories and jokes, and so without re-telling you every story and joke, its hard to truly review this.  But Ill try my hardest.

Two things about The Fluffy Movie irk me.

First, Gabriels material just isn't as strong.  This really is the main reason why The Fluffy Movie ultimately doesnt work as a whole.  Hes released quite a few comedy specials, and all of them have been pretty on the money.  His stories about his work on Magic Mike or his travels through Hawaii or his frustrations with his step son are really, truly, hilarious.  Sadly, the material on The Fluffy Movie just isn't as funny.  His tone is also too direct at points, dragging out his stories in a way that lay flat for too long until he finally reaches the end of a not so funny story to hit that one funny moment, and the effect is lost.  He also choses some more mature material (not content-wise), in that he discusses some weighter personal matters; like his weight (shocker) and reuniting with his father.  The weight stories are laborious and uninteresting, unfortunately (we know you're fluffy, we know youve lost weight, we know you like being fluffy, we know its a health risk) and the last story, about his father, while touching, is just not funny.  Its not funny.  This is a comedy special.  Your stories NEED to be funny.  I want to laugh, and while I care enough about you as a performer to be happy for you when your life and your issues come together in your favor, I didn't pay to hear a heartwarming story; I paid to LAUGH!

Second, Gabriels ego is getting too big.  Hes become extremely famous in a short period of time.  In about a five year span, hes become GLOBAL, and he knows itto the point where he likes to remind us about it, and this takes away from his usually likable persona.  Hes getting full of himself, and his overly vocal humility is starting to feel forced and fake.

I haven't given up on Fluffy.  When his next comedy special comes out, Ill see it, but hes on thin ice.  He needs to develop some new material and not just rely on the previous laughs he got for jokes hes already told us.  I don't want an extension of a story you already told me about your step son and how little he cares about his hygiene.  I want something fresh, something exciting, and most of all, I want something funny.",1421884800,4,3007,4.373646209386282
6601138,1,B00MU1YEY0,We love Fluffy but this was disappointing.  He's coming to town for live shows in a few weeks but we chose not to buy tickes this time.  We are afraid it is more of this.  Fluffy - return to your roots.  You are incredibly talented.,1421625600,,232,4.088888888888889

While there were some funny jokes, many of them had such a 'sharp' undertone of sadness or 'bite' that it lessened the humor too much.  Instead of a day/week/year in the life of Fluffy, it was weight loss (where he sounded like he was trying to be a motivational speaker), parenthood (and lack thereof) and differences in cultures.

He's generally funny, and I hope his next work is better, more reminiscent of his earlier comedy.",1417046400,,663,4.739130434782608

6601305,1,B00MU1YEY0,"I was truly disappointed by this movie. I had been a fan of Gabriel Iglesias until I watched this terrible movie. I wanted to enjoy a stand up comedy instead was berated with a boring therapy session. The stepfather dedication at the end did not compensate for him attacking single fathers. It only showed his deep seated insecurity feeling threatened by a father wanting to love his son and spend more time with him. I felt sorry for Randy the biological father as Gabriel went on tirade broadcasting his inappropriate reaction when biological father wrote considerate letter to the stepfather thanking him for being constructive presence in his son's life. The appropriate reaction is to take the moral high ground and reply that it is a pleasure to have a stepson in your life not maliciously publicly attack biological father and emotionally manipulate stepson to reject visitation rights or custody from his biological father.

Gabriel starts off the show informing audience that he is lowering his weight but not to worry that he will have plenty of material. Unfortunately we find a self fulfilling prophecy as the act lacks the appeal of his former entertainment. Gone is the jolly fat man and in his place is a malicious, jaded, petty little man. Gabriel should seek therapy from professional psychiatrist not abuse his audience with mundane material and hate speech against single fathers struggling to make a connection with their children despite obstacles constructed by other parent.

Society wonders where are all the fathers and we only have to look at those who encourage breaking up families, keeping families apart, or fight against reconciliation. Surprising that a man whose last name is Church does not follow Matthew 6:14. Learn to forgive, understand, be patient, and love. I can only hope that Gabriel matures and helps Randy reunite with his son. Humans have the great capacity to falter, show weakness, recover, and make amends given the chance.",1416787200,3,1972,5.064615384615385

6601310,2,B00MU1YEY0,"Not very funny.  In fact, a lot of his show is depressing.  Some of it is starkly boring.  The intro movie is incredibly boring and unfunny.  Fluffy is a nice guy, but his writing chops have degraded quite a bit.

Real comedians you should check out who are genuinely funny are Joe Rogan and Steve Rannazzisi.  Both of these guys recently aired comedy specials on Comedy Central FOR FREE.

Absolutely mind-boggling that Fluffy gets a movie deal.  His current comedy routine is lame and cloyingly family friendly.

If you cannot stomach edgy or smart comedy, Fluffy is the way to go.  If you need a movie for little kids, Fluffy will do.

For adults, no.  Check out guys like Joe Rogan, Steve Rannazzisi, Joe Koi, Louis C.K., John Oliver, etc.

Unlike most comedy shows this one had a storyline with a light beginning that escalated pretty quickly and ended with a bittersweet tragedy. He has added more voices and animations to his lineup which is a must see for any Fluffy fan.
