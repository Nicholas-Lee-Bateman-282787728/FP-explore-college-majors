4454220,5,B004QQDUZ6,"With this 2010 production of Donizetti's ""Don Pasquale"" the Metropolitan Opera has once again triumphed in making opera accessible to our skeptical post-moder way of thinking.  Anna Netrebco as Norina really does appear to be a tantalizing young woman for whom an old man (Don Pasquale) would lose his cool.  Netrebco is simply hilarious as she cavorts around the stage turning everything she sings and does into her very own triumphs.  John del Carlo is also excellent.  He's funny and believable.  And his male belcanto singing is entrancing.
Peter Gelb, Gary Halvorson and James Levine are doing their best to revive opera for a wider audience.  Bravo!  I was surprised to see how much James Levine has declined physically in a very short amount of time.",1318636800,3,757,4.9603174603174605
4454221,5,B004QQDUZ6,"This is a joyous, happy performance that leaves you smiling; I'm really delighted to be able to add it to my collection.

In college I sang the role of Dr. Malatesta but had let the opera fall off my radar for several years. Earlier this year my son gave us the gift of tickets to the opera and it just so happened he gave us tickets to Don Pasquale not realizing my past association with that opera. This was the catalyst that renewed my interest in this charming opera and I've been on the lookout for a version I could enjoy.

This one seemed to show promise so I threw the dice and ordered it and played it for the first time yesterday and was very pleased with the entire thing. The soloists, the staging, the music, the video, and the sound are all first class and get out of the way so one can enjoy the music and the story. This performance was refreshing and lively and had me laughing out loud.

One of the fascinating features of this production is the opportunity to view the scene changes back stage and watch the highly professional stage crew do their thing between the various scenes. I know of no other opera presentation that does this and it was of great interest to me; there are also interviews with the featured soloists between the second and third acts that support my impression that everyone was having fun.

It was pointed out that this was James Levine's first time to conduct this opera after 40 years at the Met; I'm happy to report that he does a spectacular job. One gets the impression that everyone associated with this production was really having fun doing it.

The sound on this disc is available as either PCM stereo or DTS 5.1 surround sound; I used the DTS alternative and found the sound to be excellent. Subtitles in various languages, including English, are available for viewers.

This one is highly recommend!",1314576000,10,1854,4.502976190476191
4454222,5,B004QQDUZ6,"Absolutely fantastic!  We saw it twice, already.  It is musically brilliant, of course, and the cast is not only vocally amazing but hugely entertaining as actors.  We knew that Mariusz Kwiecien was a superb baritone, but we had no idea that both he and Ms. Netrebko can match and at times surpass the comedic talent of John Del Carlo.  I highly recommend it.",1313884800,3,359,4.650793650793651
4454223,5,B004QQDUZ6,"This was funnier than I could imagine.  All of the performances were very well done.  I wasn't sure Anna N could pull off comedy so well... her singing was, as usual, outstanding and worth the price !!!",1313452800,3,202,4.4324324324324325
4454224,5,B004QQDUZ6,"Really worth the price, though, if you have a Blu-ray player, you should definitely go for the Blu-Ray edition instead.",1309910400,,119,5.0
4454225,5,B004QQDUZ6,"Don Pasquale, first performed in 1843, is the third and last of Donizetti's timeless comedies, following L'Elisir D'Amore (1832) and La Fille du Regiment (1840). What is reflective of Donizetti's immense (but inconsistant) talent is that all three can be and have been exceptionally well staged and performed after better than 150 years, and all are presently available on DVD in immensely enjoyable performances (which is a fair comment on the silliness on some recent ""Eurotrash"" stagings, which, by analogy, suggest that the Mona Lisa might be better off being re-done as Lady Gaga to be ""relevant""!)!

 Many opera fans belong to the ""cult of the soprano"" (or tenor). To be enjoyable, for me at least, the performance must work as a theatrical event. That concept subsumes the vocal and acting qualities of the performers, the staging, sets and costumes, as well as the skill of the musical conductor, orchestra and chorus. The whole, then, is the sum of its parts, and becomes less so as any one or more of those parts are less than excellent.

As is obvious from the five star rating above, this disc provided an outstanding audio/visual event. As will be set forth in more detail below, the principal singers delivered consistantly high level performances. Staging was similarly excellent. Disc quality in both picture and DTS sound was absulutely perfect.

Of the four principals, three were A+ vocally and one was B+; in acting skills, the same ratio applies but is differently apportioned. Netrebko, Polenzani and Kwiecien were incredibly fine vocally, while John Del Carlo was a tiny bit less so, showing a bit of dryness in tone and a limited top. Netrebko, Del Carlo and Kwiecien were simply marvellous as actors, while Polenzani was a bit less so. Of course, the role of Ernesto isn't very demanding from an acting perspective. To make comedy comedic is hard work, because of things like timing, and thats seems expecially true of a comedy that was written over 150 years ago. But work it does and funny it is. ( In the intermission interview between Acts I & II, hostess Susan Graham questions, Del Carlo and Kwiecien; Netrebko slips up behind them, mugs the camera, and says, ""Anyone wanna marry me??"" Hugely funny considering what has happened on stage, and apparantly sua sponte.) There is so much going on onstage that one wonders if a choreographer was involved to keep the performers from colliding. Netrebko and Kwiecien have particularly ""active"" presences onstage, all of which works very well comedically.

Orchestra and chorus are near perfect, although, as along time fan of James Levine's work, I was saddened to see how infirm he has become. But considering that he is nearly 70, it is gratifying (though not suprising these days) that his talents remain undiminished and his conducting skill remain first rate. (IMHO, I think he is the best conductor of Italian opera since Toscanini; I am less qualified to opine on his skills in the orchestral repertoire, but those CDs I own are superbly conducted.)

So, gentle reader, if you are looking for an exceptional ""night at the opera"" (sans Marx brothers), I cannot praise this performance too highly. And, if you are (or become) curious as to Donizetti's two other comedies, may I presume to suggest L'Elisir with Netrebko and Villazon, and La Fille with Dessay and Florez, both on Virgin Classics. The La Scala version of the latter on TDK with Mariella Devia is also superb!

Enjoy!",1309046400,35,3461,4.936426116838488
4454226,2,B004QQDUZ6,"I have to confess, my first irritation is that The Met releases this recent DVD version BEFORE the LONG AWAITED ""Pasquale"" with Beverly Sills, Alfredo Kraus, Hakan Hagegard and Gabriel Bacquier!? - each of whom were exemplary in their prospective roles ... Only today does Juan Diego Florez present a challenge to Kraus, but that might only represent a tie.  Even in the twilight of her career, Beverly Sills sings circles around Netbrenko.  SHAME on the MET, but when have they listened? ... a tin ear in so many regards.  On to this outing of Donizetti's PASQUALE - Great production ~  fantastic as always chorus, however the conducting left something to be desired.  Levine has never been a 'bel canto' conductor, puzzling for he has mastery of so many other fachs, but the detail in bel canto, it's rhythm, it's brilliance, never get completely wound up under Jimmy's baton. It's emotion is somehow defused.  The Pasquale of John Del Carlo appears more brittle than usual; more of a buffoon than an elderly gentleman in the folly of old age - his signing somewhat as dry as his performance.  Kwiecien makes for a perfect foil in the role of Maletesta, always energetic, pleasantly voiced but little technical aplomb.  Though as even the first reviewer pointed out, Anna Netrebko is not a belcatno or coloratura soprano, I expected more from her as this is a role she's taken on previously at the Met.  However, I find that she is now even less suited to the role.  Her voice now darker, thicker and even less agile than prior outings as Norina.  I must say I'm surprised, for Norina is a 'creampuff' of a role, yet Ms. Netrebko slides past all of it's available intricacies and delivers a vocally deflated Norina.  I have to ask though - MUST we always be subject to seeing her (entrance and exit) in a nightgown or bustier?  I don't think a lady of that period would be outside the house at night strolling in a nightie?!  Please Met, clothe that poor woman and let her VOICE present the beauty ... perhaps this is in truth what's wrong in the entire production, focus ... focus on the genius music of Maestro Donizetti - which when succeeded, will elevate any accompanying production.  PLEASE open your archives METROPOLITAN - Beverly's PASQUALE and Leontyne's AIDA are prime examples of lost opportunities for the enlightenment of current day audiences.  If you're going to spoon feed opera to the masses, make it a dose of the real thing!  And you DO a great job in the promotion of Opera today, don't get me wrong, ~BRAVO.",1304726400,34,2531,4.702947845804989

4454257,5,B004QQDUZ6,"This was an Otto Schenk production, so my expectations were high. I had never seen nor heard ""Don Pasquale"" before and I loved the music and the singers immediately. The stars who shone brightest in this production were, of course, Anna Netrebko (who sounds like she has an echo chamber in her head) and Mariusz Kwiecien who sang and played the doctor with wit and graceful agility. Anna Netrebko was equally witty and agile. They also made it look so easy and so much fun. Matthew Polenzani sang Ernesto with his buttery and seemingly infinitely stretchable tenor voice beautifully but his character came across as fairly bland. I think he could have made Ernesto more interesting and funny by making him more melodramatic in his singing, acting, and body language. And I also think that Don Pasquale could have been a more interesting and funny character if he had been portrayed as an old aristocratic, self-aggrandizing, self-deluding hypochondriac who eventually winds up tricked and humiliated which brings about his change of heart and his grasp on reality. John Del Carlo sang the title role well but I thought he overplayed the buffoon. The stage sets and costumes were beautiful and added a lot to this production. I also enjoyed the few back stage shots, especially the one where Polenzani sings off stage with his own conductor who is watching James Levine conduct out front via a monitor. Netrebko fans will enjoy this DVD thoroughly.",1390003200,5,1447,4.934426229508197

The marble column had metal bands around it to support, and there was a board to support the floor above. Nice touches. The set really looked like a dilapidated 17th century Italian villa. The music and the singing were excellent. I like to see all the non-verbal expressions in the faces of the actors and the body language which give so much meaning. One could almost see the opera in mute and be able to follow the plot lines.

I also loved the color coordination in the set and in the costumes of the actors. The backstage interviews displayed a contrast between the actors and their characters on stage.

I saw this performance when it was shown on PBS and I enjoyed it a lot thinking that I would like to buy it in the future.
When I was looking for this opera long time ago there were some versions of it. For this opera it was required to have four very good singers for the main characters because they have to sing together very often, for this reason I decided to buy a version with four very good singers produced by Teatro dela Scala with Ferruccino Furlaneto playing the main character.
A year later I bought the 2010 Metropolitan version and I had the same opinion as I had had when I saw it on TV.
May be if any of the main characters are taken individually they are not the best, but the four actors together form a very good cast with all the voices in harmony. The cast is very balanced.
There are some scenes when the chemistry among the performers is very good, for instance when Dr. Malatesta and Norina played by Mariuusz Kwencien and Anna Netrebko respectively developed a plan to convince Don Pasquale to accepts his nephew's relationship with Norina, to succeed with the plot Norina, herself has to act dr. Malatesta's sister and be Don Pasquale's future wife, this scene was very fanny; when this plot went to far the spectator almost feel sorry for Don Pasquale.
I enjoyed the duet between Don Pasquale and Dr. Malatesta which was repeated before starting the Third Act which had beautiful scenery. The characters sang very well.
The ending was the one every one expected for a comic story.
The quality of the DVD was great in all aspects.",1344729600,5,1719,4.931034482758621
4454295,4,B004QQDUZ6,"I've been hesitating as to whether to buy this DVD.' The reason for it is that It was one of Levine's last appeareances before his recent illness. He is such a wonderful conductor. But, let's face it, it's a bel canto opera. Donizetti is not Beethoven or Wagner. The orchestration is simple and uninspiring. With this kind of lessner music, the Met orchestra doesn't have a chance to bring out its full potential.

Anna Netrebko: It's really a turnoff to see a fat cow fondling her feet on the stage.",1331769600,,500,4.555555555555555
4454296,5,B004QQDUZ6,"With so few comedic operas you really want the ones that are funny to BE funny.  This production of Don Pasquale by the Met is truly that.  You can quibble about this or that singer, but this is one of the few productions of Don Pasquale I've encountered that can really burst your sides laughing.

That aside, I found all the principles to be spell binding.  The singing is excellent and the acting is superb.  John Del Carlo makes a fine Don Pasquale, his singing is a bit dry at times, but his interpretation of the character is perfect.  While Netrebko lacks the ornamentation and precision of someone like Sills, her singing is absolutely amazing.  She is able to portray such raw emotion in her singing.  Plus her and Kwiecien's capers are hilarious and they are perfectly matched working together.

This oper is a must for any Donizetti collection, presenting the genuine hilarity of this work.  It is also a must for anyone who is a fan of either Anna Netrebko or Mariusz Kwiecien.",1325289600,6,989,4.632183908045977
