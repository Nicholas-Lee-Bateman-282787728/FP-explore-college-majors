8109209,1,B000EFOU3O,"I have tried the AOL's cd that gives free connection for 3 months, and when I wanted to cancel the subscription (because I changed my home address) it was impossible to stop the bank tranfers. As incredible as this may sound, AOL claims that they cannot cancel my subscription because I don't remember my password. Even when I am able to confirm all other information (credit card number, date of birth, social, etc), they refuse the cancel the subscription.

When I talked to my bank, the bank clerk told me that many people have had the same problems with AOL. I have met dozens of people in my University that faced very similar problems with AOL.

AOL has a very bad approach to business and found a easy and certain way of losing customers.",1155600000,,745,4.552238805970149
