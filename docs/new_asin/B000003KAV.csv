7902816,4,B000003KAV,"""Star Trek: Voyager,"" Episode 55, ""Alter Ego"" (Written by Joe Menosky, Aired January 15, 1997) is one of those episodes where the two seemingly unrelated plot lines come together in the end.  On the one hand ""Voyager"" is observing the odd behavior of a nebula, forgetting that every single strange phenomenon they have encountered in the Delta Quadrant has resulted in weird things happening on the ship.  Meanwhile, Harry Kim (Garrett Wong) confesses to Tuvok (Tim Russ) that he has fallen in love with Marayna (Sandra Nelson), a holodeck creation.  Tuvok points out the obvious problem, the impossibility of having a serious relationship with a computer subroutine.  But where Harry sneaks down to the holodeck to see Marayna, he finds her in a deep conversation with Tuvok, who know understands why the young ensign is so smitten.  Meanwhile, that wacky nebula has plasma strands igniting but without cause the chain reaction that should result.
At this point ""Voyager"" tries to go its merry way, but suddenly the propulsion system goes off-line for no reason, and when Kim finds Tuvok visiting Marayna on the holodeck he accuses the Vulcan of betrayal.  Tuvok deletes Marayna's program to avoid further problems, but they seem pretty inevitable when he returns to his quarters and finds the holodeck character there.  Vulcan logic cannot be easily fooled, so Tuvok knows something is not right here.  It is a bit surprising that ""Alter Ego"" ends up being primarily a Tuvok episode, but it does provide a novel approach for finding a chink in his Vulcan armor.  Of course, in the end logic wins out and that is why this is an above average ""Voyager"" episode but not quite a classic.",1066348800,,1685,4.925795053003534
7902817,4,B000003KAV,"I had reservations about buying this episode because of the bad review on this page, but I'm glad I bought the episode. The story centers on a holodeck character that Harry falls in love with. Knowing how silly that is, but deeply infatuated, he asks Tuvok to help him purge his emotions.  Tuvok then meets with the holodeck character and finds she's not like anyone he's ever met before.
A good Tuvok episode. I highly recommend this one.",1026345600,3,439,4.628205128205129
