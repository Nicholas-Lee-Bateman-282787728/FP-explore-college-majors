8283835,5,B001BNEEXE,I have studied various styles of martial arts for over 30 years now and have studied Yang Family taijiquan for over 5 years. Dr. Yang is definitely one of the great martial art experts of our time.,1518825600,,197,4.351351351351352
8283836,5,B001BNEEXE,"In 2014 at a BJJ workshops is where I discovered the hidden power of TAI CHI CHUN is wrestling. Because of time limitations, I may have only10 to20 minutes a day to practice,but I'm feeling the difference ALL ready and I don't even have a training partner,so I act as if. Dr. Yang makes it easy to learn.",1515628800,,304,4.258620689655173

8283841,5,B001BNEEXE,"Love this video.  I also have the other video Kung Fu Wrestling by Dr Yang Jwing-Ming.
The tai chi video main difference is how you get into the technique via feeling the opponents movement, as opposed to intercepting strikes.

So this one is great to perform takedowns from the bridge.  He goes into great depth, and as with Kung Fu Wrestling you get to see common mistakes.",1406505600,4,375,4.567164179104478
8283842,5,B001BNEEXE,"Useful info for the reality / self defense practitioner. If you've taken traditional martial arts and wanted to find more depth and realism, or competitive MMA styles and wanted to find more street application I wll tell you this video opened new worlds for me. If you have a decent grasp of mechanical concepts and any experience in wrestling, ju jitsu, judo, aikido, jeet kune do, or just good coordination you should be able to see all kinds of opportunities from these techniques. I would especially recommend it at least for review and consideration by karate, jeet kune do, and boxing practitioners. The likes of whom may have a hard time adapting the principals to their style but believe me, when you get it YOU GET IT. I was a karate black belt who always knew there was more to it then I was taught, and after meeting a ( competant)  Taiji practitioner I started rebuilding my curriculum and what I have now is miles ahead of what karate alone gave me. Dr. Yang will break down and de-mystify the techniques to their true mechanical level and how they are used to manipulate the opponents balance efficiently. With some imagination you can easily picture how to integrate strikes in to it and make your old style work for you; BETTER THAN IT DID BEFORE.
The only weak point I can see is you will at some point need a competant instructor in some real fighting art to get the most out of it. But it doesn't have to be taiji based. I would actually recommend the escrima styles more over as they will integrate well with both Chinese and Japanese systems. Don't know what escrima is? It's philipino, and it's what was used to correograph the fight scenes in the Bourne series.
Good luck.",1326067200,7,1695,4.5756578947368425
8283843,5,B001BNEEXE,"If you have viewed Dr. Yang's other Taiji DVDs and have liked them then you will like this one as well.
Dr. Yang seems to have hit upon a very good format for presenting and teaching Taiji on DVDs.

Dr. Yang has developed a very good formula for instructional DVDs, that he applies in this DVD.
He does a short lecture on the subject. And then he leads into the techniques.

For the techniques:
He does a short explanation.
He then demonstrates the technique on a student, and explaining what he is doing as he demonstrates the technique.
He then has 2 or more students (in this DVD 3 students) take turns demonstrating the technique 4 or 6 times. This presents the viewer with common mistakes made and helps with knowing with what to watch out for.
While the students are demonstrating the technique he points out and corrects their their technique. And explains some of the finer points.

He presents the technique on one of his students with an excellent explanation and then has his two students try it on each other.  As his two students make common mistakes, he points out the mistakes, explains them and then points out how to correct them.  This makes a very good format for learning from DVDs.

His focus is on Yang style, but this is easily applied to all styles of Taiji and even to Bagua Zhang.
Dr. Yang makes references to Taiji push hands and Taiji 37 Postures Martial Applications DVDs, but you don't have to have watched them to understand this DVD.  The applications in this DVD start from push hand techniques.

This makes a good follow up to Dr. Yang's DVD on Shuai Jiao.  And the DVD on Shuai Jiao is a good video to watch before this one, as this DVD does not cover the basics in as much as the Shuai Jiao DVD does.  But don't worry if you don't have the Shuai Jiao DVD, you will still learn a lot from this DVD.",1260144000,6,1833,4.396449704142012
