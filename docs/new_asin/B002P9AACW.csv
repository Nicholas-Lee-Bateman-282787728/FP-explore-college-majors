8376767,3,B002P9AACW,"Video and photos of the Wolf Schanze aka Wolfe's Lair

DVD 1~ starts with logic and reason for construction of the Wolf's Lair in EAST Prussia....surrounded by forest and lakes the ideal HIDING EAST Command Center for Hitler. This has plenty of filler of video of Hitler traveling to Russia. We see how Dr. Todt and the others decided on the location which was marshy but the 3 lakes to the EAST offered both a barrier and security for the Headquarters. Labeled the Askania Chemical Works they used this ""title"" for the construction. There was a rail line there from 1907 which also helped 'hide"" the new construction. Complete with houses and barracks for his bodyguards and other WAR planners. Also included are some videos of the airmen coming to HQ for Iron Cross Medals awarded to them by Hitler. We also get to see a very good view of the entire area shot from a plane so the over all ability to hide buildings and bunkers was very successful. a little info on the Bomb plot and video of Hitler visiting the ""wounded"" in hospital. And the final decision to move to Berlin and blowing up of the HQ. DVD 2~ photos YEAR by year of The Wolf's Lair and a several short films shot in 1995 that show what the bunkers look like now and even video of the still used train tracks. The narrator is British. I question the back ground music.....(Ballet type) which is out of place in this DVD~ over all 3 STARS~ I was not disappointed .

 For a another good DVD on Wolf's Lair.....try.....Hitler's Body Guard Volume 4 that has some excellent computer generated images of Wolf Schanze/Wolf's Lair and even some additional information on the Bomb Plot July 20, 1944~",1456617600,,1658,4.557046979865772
