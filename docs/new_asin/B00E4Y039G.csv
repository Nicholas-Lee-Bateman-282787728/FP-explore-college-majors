8601260,5,B00E4Y039G,"I have seen this on NatGeo several times and it is truly amazing how a wild dog can interact successfully with ""enemies"" (hyenas, jackals) and not only survive but thrive.  I love it when she ""adopts"" the baby jackals and how she and the parents are able to live and work together to raise all the pups.  She hunts for them and protects them from her prior hyena friend, who starts to stalk them.  Sad but wonderful and I hope Solo has found more wild dogs to live with and mate with, as her maternal instinct is enormous.  But if she hasn't yet found any wild dogs, she will continue to survive with her surrogate families.  Solo can teach us important lessons about tolerance and perseverance and inner strength.  A wonderful movie to watch with your children.  I can't recommend it enough!",1400371200,6,792,4.535211267605634
8601261,5,B00E4Y039G,Amazing!  I was fortunate enough to observe Solo a few years ago while on safari. To watch this film and see her struggles and achievements is incredible. The filming is everything you'd expect from National Geographic.,1399420800,5,219,5.083333333333333
8601262,5,B00E4Y039G,"This documentary is well done. I have seen Solo for the past 2 years, and she is exactly as the video shows. She is a beautiful animal, leading an amazing life.",1390521600,3,160,4.193548387096774
