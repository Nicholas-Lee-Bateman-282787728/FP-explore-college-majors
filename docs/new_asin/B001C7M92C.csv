8286220,3,B001C7M92C,"I wonder a little bit whether the documentary-maker entirely missed the point.  I am American, but I've lived abroad, and many of my friends are from other cultures.  I've also attended a so-called 'prestigious' universities, and I can tell you definitively that most American college students are not like this.  Most of my fellow students were 'nerds', the sort of person who is easy to pass over because they're not loud or aggressive enough.  Interestingly, their regrets about their time in high school wasn't that they hadn't worked hard enough, but rather that their high schools didn't bother to teach.

The point is not that Chinese and Indian students work harder. The point is that Americans have the wrong values.  The girl chosen for the film was a typical obnoxious, over-confident, aggressive b*tch; the kind of personality who most people from my culture view as 'successful'.  And undoubtedly she will be successful; she'll bully professors and TAs into getting the grades she wants, her sorority will give her old exams, and if things get rough, she'll take her aggression out on her room mate by sexiling her on finals week; but who cares, as long as she's getting some?  It's this stupidly and excessively extraverted attitude which is hurting America; not that our students are lazy, not talented enough, or not motivated enough.

I wish that the maker of this documentary, had chosen people who actually cared about learning, and not these miserable narcissists who are becoming all too prevalent in our culture.",1369785600,8,1534,5.031620553359684
8286221,5,B001C7M92C,"Students from Shanghai high schools scored the highest on the latest international comparisons, while American students of Indian heritage regularly dominate the national Spelling Bee competition. So, it's only natural to wonder why. '2 Million Minutes' helps answer the question - their pupils work much harder and longer than ours. The DVD also confirms the earlier reports by the late Harold Stevenson, Professor at U. of Mich. who traveled to China and Japan, comparing education there with that in Chicago and Minneapolis. (Read his 'Learning Gap: Why Our Schools Are Failing and What We Can Learn from Japanese and Chinese Education.')

The two American students followed in the program were in Carmel High School, near Indianapolis; the school is rated in the top 5% of academic programs within the U.S. The featured female student wants to be a physician, is in the top 3% of her class, but also makes certain she's 'well-rounded' with time off for school activities, group studying while watching TV, and showing up for a genetic test without having even read the chapter. She was accepted into a pre-med program, with Spanish as a second concentration. Her male counterpart is basically just coasting, holding down a job, as well as being class president and editor of the school newspaper. He's already won a scholarship to Purdue based on his PSAT results, even though he also admits doing no advance preparation.

Tidbits: only 3% of African-American pupils, 4% of Hispanics, 10% of American Indians, 20% of Whites, and 34% of Asian-Americans test proficient in U.S. high-school mathematics. Part of the reason - 93% of middle-school science teachers in the U.S. have had no preparation in that area. (No problem - Carmel High recently spent $13 million to renovate its football field; better yet - Allen, Texas is constructing a new $60 million 18,000 seat stadium for a high school with 3,900 pupils. Meanwhile, science fairs in the U.S. are being cancelled.)

U.S. pupils do lead in one area, however - self-confidence. (Again, similar to Stevenson, the DVD also reports high parental and school principal satisfaction with the rigor of their schools.) Their Asian counterparts are much more doubtful of their success, and seemingly never satisfied with their performance. (Amazingly, the Shanghai male student featured in the film was #1 in math at his school, and in the top 100 in China - he was admitted to Peking University, however, in their 'General Studies' program, and deemed not qualified for what he really wanted - their Advanced Mathematics program!) Asian parents are also much more committed and setting high standards than their U.S. counterparts.

Small class size has become the American answer to most every achievement concern - yet, the number of pupils in two of the Chinese classes, 50 in one (English; 110 million Chinese pupils are studying English - the class shown used the 'immersion' method and was far above any elementary level), and 48 in the other (math) far exceed that anywhere in the U.S. Female math/science teachers were prevalent in both India and China; not in the U.S.

The film also showed considerable parental interest in their childrens' education, in all three nations. However, a follow-up report from the latest PISA testing also reported a strong relationship with national test scores and the level of parental interest as evidenced by reading books with them during their first year of primary school, as well as engagement with their 15-year-olds later.

Bottom-Line: The Chinese school year is a month longer than that in the U.S.; overall, their high-school students study/are in class twice that of Americans. The Indian pupils only worked 50% harder than the Americans. My one criticism - Why did the producer price this movie so high? The result, far fewer see it than otherwise - few libraries carry it, and neither NetFlix nor Blockbuster do either.

Sudhakar Kudva adds the following in a 1/4/2009 blog: One study estimates the number of students in the gifted programs in China outnumbers the total number of students in the US. Even when American kids do well, a large proportion of our top students who compete in math, science, chess, spelling bees, geography bees, science fairs and so on, are children of first generation immigrants from China, India and other countries. Apparently, these students do well in spite of our public education system, and not because of it.

Side Note: I was appalled by Indian eating practice - using their fingers, instead of utensils, and putting food in each others' mouths.",1321488000,6,4591,5.0795755968169765
8286222,4,B001C7M92C,"I am a middle and high school AIG (Academically and Intellectually Gifted) facilitator.  I was introduced to this movie by a colleague at the high school level.  We were having a discussion about why students transitioning from middle to high school completed the transition with such a mixed bag of emotions.  This movie of 2 Million Minutes really does put an accurate real-time spin on what students are expected to know and do in the short amount of time they are enrolled in high school.  The comparisons between US, Chinese, and Indian students is extremely interesting.  I developed some study/discussion questions to accompany the viewing of this documentary.  The movie isn't very lengthy, but it does pose some real visible contrast in the motivation, attitude, drive, and intellect of students.  In this day and time of educational transformation, students have to see they are in a global competition.  The arms race is now a minds race.  Allowing the best and brightest to successfully compete for the handful of available careers.

I also highly recommend this documentary because of the cost efficient staff development opportunity this is for schools.  Viewing the documentary and allowing for discussion during PLCs is the most conducive vehicle for educators on a budget.
I would encourage anyone who works with young adults to view this documentary; not recommended for students under thirteen for full comprehension.  The conversations will truly be rich when the students hit the ""aha"" moment and see their relationship to the students portrayed in the video.",1301097600,7,1580,5.201581027667984
8286223,5,B001C7M92C,I had no idea that the Chinese had come so far in their educational systems. We are in for a world of hurt if we don't get our kids motivated. This movie was not only informative but also very entertaining.,1263945600,9,206,4.175
8286224,4,B001C7M92C,"This video does a reasonably good job of showing the reasons for the difference in motivation level between top American students and top Asian students.  It boils down to the fact that in America there's an environment in which students are relatively relaxed in terms of academic stress, and this is because of the huge economic advantages that the US has had historically.  Academic achievement just isn't as important--and when it is, it's mixed with other things that are thought to be important--socializing, working part time jobs, sports, etc.  Obviously the Asian students are more focused.

I showed the film to my college sociology class and they took it in quite well.  The commentary got a bit repetitive at times, but overall it's a worthwhile program.  Four of five stars.",1227744000,24,787,5.015384615384615
