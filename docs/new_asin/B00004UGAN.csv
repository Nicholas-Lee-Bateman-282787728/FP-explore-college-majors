7924249,5,B00004UGAN,"This set of Monty Python TV episodes is particularly silly - it contains episodes 4, 5 and 6 of Season 1 of Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Episode 4 - Owl Stretching Time - has Eric Idle's teeth song (appearing three times throughout, complete with a busty blonde's caresses - I bet they love scripting stuff like that!!), museum mums (or pepper pots - that is, Monty Pythons in drag), the art critic, the Army commander, a bizarre Benny Hill-like no-dialogue beach sketch, the famous fruit defence skit, meat Gillimation, book store secret agent Fleming of the BDA.

Episode 5 - Man's Crisis of Identity in the Latter Half of the 20th Century - starts with the cat doctor and the confuse-a-cat paramilitary troupe with some weird stage act (nice car!), animation, the dubious customs official and Zurich clock smuggler, interview with a lizard, a cat and a duck, talks with ""the man on the street"", letters for Monty Python, the on-air newscaster arrest (surreal!), a love scene, animation for ""the insult that made a man of Mack"", management training course interview, visit by robber/encyclopaedia salesman.

Episode 6 - It's the Arts (or: The BBC Entry to the Zinc Stoat of Budapest) - has Arthur Figgis animation, long name gag, art Gillimation, Mob planning for legal activity, crunchy frog (yes!!), stockbroker adventures including a topless convenience store attendant (!!!!), upskirt in the office, custom comics animated, Indian at awards ceremony (heap funny), ad for policeman friendship, strange ""A Scotsman On A Horse"" skit, pram animation, 20th century vole, cattle baron studio chief.

It comes with plenty of bonus materials - each episode has in its own menu a ""useless tidbit"", which is typically some sort of trivia item; can be ignored. It has the same ""Meet The Chaps"" menu that you'll find in all of the DVDs, each of which includes a video clip, a brief bio, and a list of noteworthy appearances (""Monty Python And The Holy Grail"", ""And Now For Something Completely Different"", etc). There's Graham Chapman doing his military commander rebuking silliness (0:30), Eric Idle doing 0:33 of his ""Nudge nudge, wink wink"" sketch, Terry Jones' Ron Obvious eating an Anglican cathedral bit (0:30), part of John Cleese's ""Dead Parrot"" sketch (0:40), Michael Palin doing a bit of art critic stuff (0:15), and Terry Gilliam in Viking gear moaning ""But that was my only line"" (0:07).

""A Trivial Quest"" contains ""Trivia for Gumbys"" (with six questions in triple choice format, with funny videos for wrong answers and for correct answers, often with a relevant clip) and ""Trivia for Upper Class Twits"". There's a section of ""Gillimations"" is a set of Terry Gilliam animations, including famous paintings. ""Crunchy Frog Live"" is a Live From The Hollywood Bowl version of the skit included on this disc from the original TV broadcast, this time with a barf gag. ""Historical Figures"" gathers three skits about Atilla the Hun, Queen Victoria, and Hitler from various episodes; good fun, but hardly necessary (ditto for ""Gillimations"").",1449273600,,3042,5.063872255489022

7924252,5,B00004UGAN,"Episode 3-How To Recognise Different Types of Trees From Quite A Long Ways Away
The Bicycle Repairman sketch gets great notice, as BR is F.G. Superman's (Michael Palin) secret identity.  The joke here is that everybody is dressed in a Superman outfit, but they are clueless in ordinary things.  The heavy exaggerated dialogue of two of the Supermans as well as the captions going Clink! Bend! and Inflate!, re the Biff! Bam! and Pow! of Batman TV series is marvelous!
However, the Restaurant Sketch is the highlight, as it shows how being apologetic and taking responsibility for a dirty fork can go too far, making a mountain out of a molehill.  The head waiter and manager's overreaction would make people so uncomfortable and self-conscious of pointing out the smallest of mistakes that can be easily remedied.
My favourite is the storytime sketch, where Eric Idle tries to read a children's book but finds it full of adult material, and the scene of the hippo squashing the bunny rabbits had me on the floor laughing when I saw it the first couple of times.
The chicken-wielding knight is pretty busy here, as he coshes the head of a barrister who's so clueless about his client's case, he calls in a gossiping pepperpot, a corpse in a coffin, and Cardinal Richlieu as witnesses, the redcoat compere who introduces the Restaurant Sketch, and goes after the overacting announcer who gets into a raving anti-communist fury before his wife calls him to tea.
The episode ends with the famous ""Nudge Nudge"" sketch, where Norman (Idle) asks a stockbroker-type city gent (Jones) about his wife with a very salacious bent.  ""Your wife, does she go, eh?  Know what I mean, know what I mean?  Say no more, nudge nudge!"" and nudges the freaked out city gent.  This was originally a sketch offered to Ronnie Barker, who refused it, until it was redone here.
Episode 4-Owl Stretching Time
Well, no owls are stretched here as such, but the running theme is ""It's A Man's Life <fill in blank here>,"" with a guitar-strumming Eric Idle, who is being seduced by beautiful Katya Wyeth, ending with the two of them in bed.  Interrupting the sketch is a stern, no-nonsense brigadier (Graham Chapman) who protests the copyright infringement of the army's phrase, ""it's a pig's life... man's life, in the modern army.""
For those who didn't know why the art critic became scornful of his wife's line, ""What ho, dear?"" is because she meant it as a pun, ""Watteau, dear?"" in reference to Jean-Antoine Watteau, a Flemish painter influenced by Rubens.  Poor Katya Wyeth!
Terry Jones is constantly foiled in his attempts to discretely undress so he can get into his bathing costume at the beach (is this Brighton, Paignton, or Margate?)
However, the best sketch is the RMS (royal master sergeant) (John Cleese) who teaches his class how to defend themselves against...fresh fruit, with Eric Idle being the wiseacre who keeps asking him about pointed sticks, which earns him a harsh ""Shut up!""  This sketch must've been written by Cleese or Chapman, as their sketches involve people being verbally abused, often scornfully and/or at loud volume.  This features the debut of the 16-Ton weight.
Reviewed by Mr. Valencia Orange eating a Botticelli's Venus who knows how to defend himself against anyone wielding a gooseberry and a dirty fork.
