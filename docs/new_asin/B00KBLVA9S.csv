6413696,5,B00KBLVA9S,"I came across this series, while searching Netflix for a good romantic movie.  I eventually (binged) watched both seasons 1 & 2 and am absolutely hooked!  The casting, the music (I even purchased the soundtrack from Amazon Spain), the story line are excellent.  I apprecate that it is an authentic and realistic story.  The story centers around the love interest of the main characters Alberto and Ana and the store, Velvet Galleria.

But while Ana and Alberto are central, the supporting cast serves an equally importantl purpose in making the series a sucess.  There are the other ""Velvet Girls"" (Rita, Clara, and Luisa who round out the four) and their love interests, respectively, Pedro, Mateo and Jonas.  Each has an interesting story and their relationships and friendships with each other are what make the entire series fantastic. The themes of love (young, old and forbidden), family, friend and business relationships play out throughout the series, making it interesting.  Along with love, there is betrayal, distrust and scheming.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat and it will engage your emotions.  You will rejoice at their victores, cry at their pain and loss and feel annoyed and dismayed by some of their actions.  At least that's how I experienced the series.

For example,  I sometimes found the drawn out tensions between all of the romantic relationships a bit much.  This was especially the case for Rita and Pedro; and I didn't particularly like how their relationship came to be.  I liked them both as characters, individually.  I thought Pedro's comforting words to Emilio after his loss was absolutely touching.  Rita is a favorite of mine.  But I think Alberto would be my most favorite; I identified with his struggles and think he's a great actor.  And, I route for his and Ana's relationship.

Any movie or book that makes you care about the characters, that causes you to feel (love, laughter, anger, like, dislike, etc) is worth taking the time to read or view.  I highly recommend this series.  It has English subtitles, but you'll be so engaged in the movie that you won't find them bothersome.

Season 3 (15 episodes)  is now available in Spain.  Antena3.com has some preview clips (in Spanish of course) that you can view.  I have friends who speak Spanish to translate for me.  I am waiting anxiously for Netflix to get this latest season.  I contacted them, but they had no update on viewing date. In the meantime, I will savor seasons 1&2 and look for another series that comes as close to holding my interest.  I welcome recommendations.",1444521600,,2587,4.855835240274599
6413697,5,B00KBLVA9S,"Best series in a long time, the casting is excellent and acting even better.  The music selections are amazing.",1443916800,,111,4.842105263157895

6413699,5,B00KBLVA9S,"I have watched Velvet Season 1 and 2. I am watching it again. I am in love with love. this is the best. I hope there is a season 3. This is the best. My Spanish is rough and the English dubbing was great. Come on Netflis, or Amazon get season 3",1439510400,2,244,3.7115384615384617
6413700,5,B00KBLVA9S,I do not watch much TV but I was hooked after the first episode.  Watched both seasons on Netflix in one weekend and have watched some episodes again.  Loved the Alberto and Ana storyline.  Would like to purchase the DVD but not sure if it has English subtitles.  The music was great...should sell the soundtrack.,1439164800,,313,4.636363636363637
6413701,5,B00KBLVA9S,"I loved this series.  Everything about it was beautifully captured on film.  I loved Miguel Angel Silvestre, and 'Rita'.  I did not like Ana's wig one bit. When her hair was done in a flip, it looked much better, but it was still a wig.  Luisa's singing was so bad, that I had to turn the volume off.  Why show her in such a bad way?  Wasn't a decent singing voice available?  Ana's girdle in the two love scenes was like a 'fly in the ointment'. Alberto's mother was a sad case.  She looked awful.  Why not pick another beautiful or pretty woman like Blanca for that part.  Something was wrong with Isabel's eyes and walk.  I suspect she was trying to compensate for her poor vision and poor gait.  I don't know, but I did not like looking at her.
All else was well done.  The acting was good. The main characters were wonderful, especially Mateo and Don Emilio.  I am patiently awaiting Season 3.  I hope there will be one.",1438819200,,925,4.296511627906977
6413702,5,B00KBLVA9S,I'm almost finished with season 2 and it does get ridiculous in the way the writers keep the characters apart--especially Rita and Pedro. It's really overkill. Enough is enough!,1438819200,,177,5.137931034482759
6413703,5,B00KBLVA9S,I just finished watching both seasons on Netflix. I literally could not leave my Mac Laptop  for three and a half days. I was so absorbed and hooked after the first episode.

6413711,5,B00KBLVA9S,"Words can't express how much I adored Season 1 of this series!  Everything from the music to the sets to both the cute and poignant plot lines were fabulous.  And the actors!  Really, truly just an incredible level of talent.  Romantic and fun, I was laughing out loud, crying, and smiling like a fool throughout the entire thing :)  Cannot wait for Season 2!  I ordered the soundtrack CD from Amazon. Spain; great collection but unfortunately lacking a few of my very favorite songs - guessing they couldn't get the rights to use them?  Though that seems odd since they were used in the series...",1428364800,4,597,4.628571428571429

6413717,5,B00KBLVA9S,I LOVE this show!  My husband and I watched it over a two week period each night and we are both hooked. I was not sure about watching this with the subtitles but you won't even care cause it is such a good story!  Here is where I have a problem and I hope that someone can help.  How can we get the second season of this program with the english subtitles?  I have heard that they are already done with season 3!  I have contacted netflix several times requesting that they get the next season.  I have searched online where you can find some episodes but without subtitles.,1424649600,4,575,4.229357798165138
6413718,4,B00KBLVA9S,"I just finished watching the first season on Netflix and enjoyed it very much. There is a ""telenovela"" quality to it but very entertaining and the performance are done with just the right balance of intensity and authenticity with a sprinkle of humor. Doesn't hurt that the fashions, sets and beautiful people that inhabit the world of ""Velvet"" make it a visual feast. I am looking forward to the second season even if I feel I can predict exactly what's going to happen... the tale is told with so much style that I can forgive the obvious story line.",1423612800,3,552,4.585858585858586
6413719,5,B00KBLVA9S,"omg, OMG, O EM GAWWWWD!!!  I binge-watched this this past weekend on Netflix and just absolutely fell in love with this TV show.  I'm one of those people who love the fashion and style of the 50's and miss how people of that era used to dress.  None of this sweat pants crap you see going on today.  But also, the actors and actresses on this show are just so beautiful and funny and human on all levels.  The romance, betrayal, friendships, etc and MUSIC, oh the music!  Is there a soundtrack?  I'd totally buy it!  I just can't get enough of this show and I can't wait for Season 2.  PLEASE HURRY!  Jonesing for Velvet over here!!!",1423440000,4,633,4.288135593220339

6413722,5,B00KBLVA9S,"I binge watched Velvet over a three day weekend.  Why can't American filmmakers make these crazy, lovely, tragic, comedic movies (or series)?  All the characters were so believable -- as opposed to what is produced here where nearly everyone has had veneers (or plastic surgery) for the perfect smile, older men and women are props, the acting is uneven, the music tiresome.  Please, directors, producers, sponsors; take a page or two from this series.  When is Season 2 available?  BTW my favorite couples: Dona Blance and Maximiliano, and Pedro and Rita.  (Oh, wait, I think American movies like this were made in the 50's and 60's)",1422748800,41,634,4.933962264150943

8657389,1,B00KBLVA9S,"Wow, I read these reviews and it makes me even more disturbed. This show is about a group of rich people whore mainly psychopaths. The simple workers are decent human beings, but starting from the parents of Alberto (his father and stepmother), then his wife, half sister, brother in law, others who would become partners or owners of velvet, the main clients and colleagues their petty competitive actions there are only a few who have redeeming characteristics. Typically, they're remorseless, manipulative, deviant, mean, liars, who actually think their actions are justified by what they believe to be love. The potential this show had wouldve been far more enjoyable, if the behaviors of the characters were more complex in an endearing way; they're are mostly despicable human beings, overall the behaviors of 80% of the main characters became increasingly more disturbing. None but a handful have qualities that give this show depth. If you like novellas that insult your intelligence, then I guess enjoy! It was painful to watch and I only skimmed through episodes hoping to find something in the writing that was worth my time. There are a few good moments. I watched mostly out of boredom, because I was traveling and had limited shows to watch.",1516579200,,1255,5.038461538461538

This love story between Alberto and Ana, was my  story , the names were different  mine was between  Odete and Jafar, and with  a differences of course, the painful one ? Theirs was a movie with a perfect end , mine was real and no perfect ending.  We were separated and when we found each other he had married someone else thinking I had done the same. Fifty years later I am still waiting for a good ending.  This story gave me may hours of joy and the opportunity to remember how love felt like.  We need more stories like this one to help us through a very difficult time we are all experiencing, I can not turn TV on, all I see is bad news, bad stories, crime stories nothing to make us feel good anymore.",1500336000,,926,3.9782608695652173

You get to associate with specific characters and they become part of your daily household discussion. Sad it ends hope to see one more season, their lives outside the gallery, how Rita manages with her cancer, and how their lives unfold. Simply one of the best mini-series I saw in years.
