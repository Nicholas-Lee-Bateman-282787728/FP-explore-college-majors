8475296,3,B000XJO1VM,"As stated, 'Postcards From The Future' follows civilian electrical engineer Sean Everman as he starts out hired to do a tour on the moon, installing parts of the electrical grid for a rapidly expanding moon base.  Sean's video postcard's home to his wife recount his initial frustration, and gradual commitment to the grand vision.  Step by step he takes another tour, then finds his wife can't join him, but talks him into staying out anyway, and talks him into seeing this as a great opportunity to be part of history.  He go on to set up parts of the power grid on the Mars base, and deep space efforts to the outer solar system.  Later his grown up daughter comes up to join the vision and go on her own missions out ahead of dad, to set up the initial base on Mars, etc.

This is a personal project of Alan Chan, who did a excellent job with the effects; and following this everyman Sean Everman as he effectively gives his life to the cause, and in the end goes home home old and in declining health; works well on a emotional level as you relate to him and his Daughter.  But given you only hear their side of discussions, you wonder exactly what his wife's compelling argument was that inspired him to see the importance of the project?  Or for that mater why the wife stayed married to him, spending decades alone back on Earth, seemingly with little if any contact with her husband beyond the video letters?  Also the reason for the cause, this vast huge project to colonize and explore the solar system, is never defined.

The last is its greatest failing.  Giving no real explanation of why the world, or even the main character, is convinced to throw this massive investment of money and lives into the project.  The audience will likely be divided into two camps.  Those (the writer director Alan Chan likely among them) who find it inconceivable that anyone wouldn't give anything to see this dream come to pass; and the more general public, who wonder what such a huge project would be for?  What rewards (other then being a part of history) this could bring.  By not really engaging in that discussion, or showing more then a staggeringly huge development program, that seemingly does nothing but construct facilities for later bigger parts of the same program; the audience has no reason to embrace the vision unless they already have.  So the movie is well constructed case of illustrating the vision to the already faithful, rather then a attempt to convince others to adopt the vision.  But though it may just be preaching to the choir, it's a rich visual illustration of the faithful's dreams, and will greatly inspire those who already embrace the vision.",1211673600,2,2678,4.641949152542373
