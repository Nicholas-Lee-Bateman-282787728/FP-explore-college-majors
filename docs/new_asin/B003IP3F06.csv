4127882,4,B003IP3F06,"This DVD (""Amazon Verified Purchase"") is a fine account of the great Johanna Budwig's treatment from which she had a 90% success rate, a tad better than current medical treatment of chemotherapy in America.  Budwig was a woman whose genius offended the medical establishment which probably prevented her from winning the Nobel Prize.  I think, given the situation, that her being nominated seven times is a greater honor.  Watson and Crick beat Pauling in getting the structure of DNA and the Nobel prize because a woman, Franklin (see the NOVA program), showed Watson her superb pictures revealing the helical structure of DNA.  Watson subsequently belittled Franklin.  Budwig died in 2003 but I am betting my life on Bill Henderson's How to CURE Almost Any CANCER at Home for $5.15 a Day (also published in 2003) because Henderson provides techniques for monitoring progress and seems less of an ordeal than Budwig's preparations.",1325376000,5,932,5.145695364238411
4127883,5,B003IP3F06,"This is an enjoyable DVD to watch, full of information, but not overwhelming or overly technical.  I am a cancer patient and have incorporated parts of the Budwig diet into my routine via the Bill Henderson protocol.  I was not aware of the full history, background and diversity of the diet.  I will no doubt watch this a second time and take advantage of some of the resources and recipes it provides.  Having an understanding of the concepts behind the development of the diet and their workability is key to making any dietary commitment.",1294963200,16,542,4.73404255319149
4127884,5,B003IP3F06,"If you are going to try the Budwig Protocol, this DVD, will help you to be able to implement it.  Sometimes reading the book can be confusing as to how to mix the cottage cheese and flax.  This DVD takes you through a whole day of the Protocol, showing you how to mix, what to eat, and at what times, along with tips and ways to vary the mix for taste and variety.  It helped out tremendously, giving me the confidence I needed to feel like the protocol is both achievable and practical.  If you have read her books, do yourself a favor and get this DVD, it is pleasant to watch and so informative.",1292976000,27,598,4.173913043478261
4127885,5,B003IP3F06,"I have read many medical diets over the years including Gerson, who was also a German medical doctor. I find it amazing that Budwig also espoused organic and fresh foods. It is no secret that processed foods are killing us. It's too bad that most of these books are written in German and only a very few have been translated into english. Dr. Budwig's diet in the DVD is very informative and it provides a detailed plan. However, it is recommended that it be strictly followed in order for it to work. She also gives a time frame for how long one needs to be on her diet. It is worth getting along with her other two books which are published in english in order to understand her theory completely.",1285459200,28,699,4.384615384615385
4127886,5,B003IP3F06,"This video is very basic and simple. No high tech effects or graphics, but if you are looking to truly be healed from major illnesses this will do it. It does not happen overnight, but it is effective and does not have the side effects of the synthetic medicines the doctor is prescribing.  Excellent to get the basic protocol down. Would highly recommend her book ""Flax Oil as a True Aid Against Arthritis, Heart Infarction, Cancer and Other Diseases"" it will give you the science behind Dr. Budwig's work.",1284336000,22,507,4.696629213483146
4127887,5,B003IP3F06,"If you're interested in Dr. Budwig's books and her work at all for yourself and/or a loved one, this DVD will make the entire process of understanding and more importantly IMPLEMENTING the diet as painless and as easy as possible.

""A Day in the Budwig Diet"" answered all of my questions about how to use the diet.

Dr. Budwig's books are an essential part of your library. But in my opinion, this video deserves to be right next to them to create a wonderful Trilogy.

The presentation in the video is interesting, informative and very clear.

You'll love ""A Day in the Budwig Diet"" and like me, you'll thank Ursula Escher for making it with such care and attention.

Buy the DVD.

You'll be so glad you did.",1279584000,41,709,4.5

4127906,5,B003IP3F06,"This DVD gives very clear instructions on how to use flaxseed oil and protein mixture to improve your health and fight against cancer.

For me more energy, for my husband who has stage 4 brain cancer, we saw him get stronger each day.
Do what she says and you will get well.
The best part is that is doable and other than buying this book and the simple supplies of organic cottage cheese and flax oil and seeds, all this information is free.
You do not have to have tests done or go to the hospital for treatments.
It works! Praise God!",1375574400,7,497,4.081632653061225
4127909,3,B003IP3F06,"I was very disappointed in the production of this video. I think the producer could have done a better job. It looked like just something she threw together to sell videos. The video had no sound, no narration at all. It was pretty bad. The budwig website is much better if a person takes the time to bookmark it, read it, and return to read it again. It has lots of information. No one can digest all that information on the site in one sitting without repeated visits to the site. I would not recommend this video to any one serious about their health.",1373414400,,554,4.336538461538462
4127910,5,B003IP3F06,"This DVD should be used along with Dr. Budwig's books, especially the cook book.  As the old cliche' goes, ""seeing is believing.""

4127911,5,B003IP3F06,"Easy to understand and diet is easy to follow.  Geared to someone with a serious disease like cancer, where there is a sincere commitment to natural healing.  This Dr. Budwig has proven her success in ""curing"" even advanced cancer by her thorough documentation in the healing responses of her patients.  Have purchased this while in good health, and plan to incorporate her flaxseed oil information into our daily nutrition regimen.",1363392000,2,432,5.142857142857143
4127912,1,B003IP3F06,"The DVD is made very nice, but unfortunately it contains too many mistakes and is therefore completely useless if not dangerous for people with cancer. From whom did Ms. Escher learn the OPD? She should at least be able to read German books from Dr. Budwig BEFORE she is producing a manual on the oil-protein diet.",1358726400,6,314,4.625
4127913,5,B003IP3F06,"I have read several of the books written by Johanna Budwig and took great interest in her literature due to my family's extensive history of cancer.  Not only has this simple protocol been proven effective at curing cancer, but it is effective towards attaining general well-being and helping with many other diseases as well.  This DVD gives a simple video presentation of how to implement her plan.  For a woman to have an over 90% success rate on curing cancer, even with patients so sick that the hospitals had given up on them and said there was nothing more that could be done with them, is absolutely incredible.  I read one of her other books that contained testimonials from her patients who were cured from pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and a whole host of other ""deadly"" cancers - read [ASIN:B007EF7ENK Cancer: The Problem and the Solution].  The fact that the medical profession, the pharmaceutical industry, and the fast-food industry had so much money to lose if the public were to accept her protocols, that they kept taking her to court trying to sue her so that she would be taken away from her life's work of healing patients and spreading her philosophy.  This is truly incredible information that needs to be shared with the public.  People forget that the medical industry is also a business looking to make money and will do anything possible to stop the spread of information that will prevent it from doing so.",1332201600,22,1433,4.800813008130081

I used her formula to nearly completely stop my tumor's growth, when it was going wild and nothing else that I did worked.  It's years later and I still take her oil/protein mixture nearly daily ( sometimes I forget ).  I've been fighting Stage IV cancer, on and off for 18 years.  I don't use doctors and do it all naturally.  Dr Budwig's protocol is one of the main things that I do to help keep the cancer at bay.  Also, I do a lot of bleeding with the cancer I have, and her oil/protein mixture helps to control the bleeding.",1493596800,6,640,4.19672131147541
