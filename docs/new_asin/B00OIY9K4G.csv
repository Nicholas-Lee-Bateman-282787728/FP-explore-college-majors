8683813,3,B00OIY9K4G,Was not what I expected.  Not really a concert with Dolly & Kenny.  Only one song together. The rest were separate songs sung individually by each artist.  So sad it was not both of them singing together for more than one song.  Would not buy it if I knew it was what it turned out to be.,1512864000,,288,4.0

8683816,1,B00OIY9K4G,"If you haven't yet bought the DVD recently released entitled Live In Concert Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers (Country Legends) Cat ref: LM315  THEN DONT BOTHER!!

It looks the part with a nice cover and fairly decent graphics. Then  once you play the disk, there are a catalogue of errors:

1. There are a mere 5 songs where Dolly is in concert as a pose to Kennys 14.
2. Track one  Jolene (taken from the BBC Glastonbury appearance 2014) is very clearly an inferior copy.
3. Islands In The Stream (track 3) is good on sound but quality is poor and blurred.
4. This is the shocker  its actually someones mobile phone recording of Dolly singing Lay Your Hands On Me complete with wobbly picture, people shadows in the shots and sound fading in and out.

The rest of the DVD (all Kenny) is is appearance at Glastonbury in 2013  quality is questionable.

We are surprised that the people who are involved in this release allowed such poor quality stuff  especially as it appears to be a genuine release sold via Amazon and such-like.",1440115200,16,1028,4.538043478260869
