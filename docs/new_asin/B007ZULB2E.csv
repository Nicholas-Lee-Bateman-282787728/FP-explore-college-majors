8523487,5,B007ZULB2E,"Excellent. The interviews are interesting and not boring at all, the archival film is crisp, and excellent and the narration is well written and extremely informative. I was barely born when Vietnam started so I can not say if everything is true and accurate but as far as film making goes this is a must have DVD. I recommend it to anyone who believes the men of Vietnam are true heros, and those who don't need to watch it and appreciate what these young men mostly just young boys did for their country. Hats of to true American heros.",1462924800,,538,4.444444444444445
