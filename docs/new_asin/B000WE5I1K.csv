If Darth Vader were gay and had braids there wouldn't be much difference. There a lot of interesting characters in this anime. There is a good mix of action and drama. The most impressive aspects of this anime are the animation quality and the space battles. It's a unique anime series and there aren't too many other series that are all that similar. I really enjoyed watching this anime. As I said the characters are the best part of Glass Fleet. The bad guy is so bad that you'll wanna fight him yourself, and the heroes will make you wanna strap up and go to bat with them. Overall Glass Fleet is a solid anime. I'd say that my only complaint is the sick little pervert that always follows Vetti, the bad guy, around everywhere. He's pretty sickening. Glass Fleet will probably be a good addition to your collection. It's not a bad price either.",1355270400,,975,4.4525139664804465
8222857,3,B000WE5I1K,A slow story that I have been some what disappointed in.  Not what I expected and would say the animation is good but story line is not that interesting and slow.  If I was to do over I would not buy.,1266451200,,200,3.8536585365853657
8222858,5,B000WE5I1K,"I just startet with the series some weeks ago, but after a tiny hangover i started to love it.

The Story is continuing to get complicated, the characters act a little bit more serious, and the surprises start to come faster.

Michelles secret is liftet - well, perhaps to fast but in a nice manner.

Technically i had sone sequences not so good as normally - but thats no big fault for me.

Surely will follow this :)",1205971200,,418,4.32051282051282
