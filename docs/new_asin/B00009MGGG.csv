7991713,5,B00009MGGG,"""Fugitivas"" is an excellent action movie. It may be a little too violent for some people, but it is fast paced and has a good story line.  Laia Malou is a great actress and gives an excellent performance as ""girl gone wrong"" but with a ""heart"". My only dislike was that the men in the film are all the worst examples of ""losers"", ""users"" and ""abusers"" that young women from a bad home seem to end up with. The movie is shot on beautiful locations throughout Spain, and there is quite a variety of characters, old and young, very regional.  The film is in Spanish with English sub titles which is very helpful because the slang and accents were very different to my american ears.  Beatriz Coronel is wonderful and lovable as the little girl that Toni(Laia Malou)becomes attached to while helping her find her father. And of course they both start to care and love each other at the end(come on, this isn't giving anything away, don't we all expect this to happen??)",1374537600,,965,4.5344827586206895
