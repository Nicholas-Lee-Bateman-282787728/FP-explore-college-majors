8561965,5,B00B361IU6,WWE's most creative booking of the first 4.  A main event without Hogan that made sense.  Savage and DiBiase deserved it.,1433116800,,121,4.714285714285714
8561966,5,B00B361IU6,"Three hours of wrestling from 1988 at the Trump Plaza.  Andre the Giant and Hulk Hogan make appearances, but the night belongs to Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage.  A tournament format for the heavyweight championship, while the Honky Tonk Man squares off with Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake for the Intercontinental belt.  Demolition (with Mr. Fuji) are after the Tag Team belt.  An opportunity to once again see the stars of the WWE from nearly 30 years ago while they were in their prime.",1424390400,,481,4.829268292682927

8561970,4,B00B361IU6,"A couple of notes here in that this is the exact same version of this event taken from the WrestleMania Anthology set meaning that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring but there is no blurring of the WWF logo since this event happened before the ""Attitude Era.""

""What The World Is Watching"" was the perfect title for this WrestleMania at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City as going into this event was the first time ever that the WWE Championship was vacant in the history of the company leading to the first ever 14 man tournament to crown a new undisputed champion.  Various celebrities include Bob Uecker, Robin Leach from ""Lifestyles Of The Rich & Famous"", Vanna White, and Gladys Knight singing ""America The Beautiful.""  This event also featured the WrestleMania debuts of various superstars & legends like Rick Rude, Bam Bam Bigelow, One Man Gang, Ted Dibiase, Demolition, and Ultimate Warrior.

The finals of the tournament came down to Randy Savage vs. Ted Dibiase who had Andre The Giant in his corner & kept making his presence known throughout the match causing Ms. Elizabeth to go get a ""Mega Power"" of her own.  The other attraction match in the tournament was the quarterfinal ""rubber match"" between Hulk Hogan & Andre which honestly was more of an angle than a match that didn't come close to the quality of their previous encounters.  Randy Savage had the only match in the semifinals against One Man Gang while wrestled Greg Valentine in the quarterfinals while Ted Dibiase also wrestled in the quarterfinals against Don Muraco.  Opening round matches included Jim Duggan vs. Ted Dibiase, Don Muraco vs. Dino Bravo, Ricky Steamboat vs. Greg Valentine, Randy Savage vs. Butch Reed, Bam Bam Bigelow vs. One Man Gang, and Jake Roberts vs. Rick Rude in what was the most technical match throughout the tournament.  Non-tournament matches include Strike Force vs. Demolition for the Tag Team Championships that began a history making title reign, Honky Tonk Man defending the Intercontinental Championship against Brutus Beefcake, Ultimate Warrior vs. Hercules, British Bulldogs & Koko B. Ware vs. Islanders & Bobby Heenan, and a 20 man battle royal featuring Bad News Brown & Junkyard Dog & Hart Foundation & Harley Race & George Steele.

This Mania was very similar to WrestleMania II where it was ""quantity over quality"" as the tournament format allowed too many matches & people on the card to the point where the tournament matches were very short with very little of them being memorable once they were over.  In the end, I would heavily recommend this for fans of the tournament format, this time period in WWE, or Randy Savage fans as this was his night to remember.",1364515200,,2733,4.883369330453564
