2753239,5,B000N2HDLY,"Anything with or about Streisand is always a treat for me, being one of her lifelong fans.  This interview was frank and I noticed that Bab's was fairly at ease with this interview.  This video is a MUST for anybody who claims to be her fan.",1229904000,,241,4.217391304347826
2753240,5,B000N2HDLY,"Let me begin by saying flatly I Love Barbra Streisand and think her voice is one of the most beautiful of the 20th century. However, in the Amazon Editorial Description of this product there is a misprint or type O. Here is what Amazon wrote:
""Product Description
Over four decades, Barbra Streisand has reached the pinnacle of every art form she has encountered. She is the first artist ever to earn a Grammy, a Tony, an Emmy and an Oscar. In this program, this beloved entertainer speaks revealingly about herself and her craft.......""
The statement that Barbra is the first artist to have won all four awards is not correct. It is, in fact, Rita Moreno. I am getting my information from Google.com as well as WikiPedia. Plus I knew this already in my head but had to confirm. Just letting Amazon know as well as someone who would not know this information readily.",1226102400,2,867,4.636363636363637
2753241,5,B000N2HDLY,"Wow!  For major league fans, a must see, for those who are on the fence, you won't be after you see this very unguarded, relaxed, insightful, and at times intimate interview.  My only beef is that the actual interview was almost 6 hours long, but only 1.4 hours made it to the DVD...what a huge shame.  I am a medium BS fan, but find myself now even more in awe of her accomplishments and looking at and enjoying her work from a new perspective thanks to this interview.",1208304000,6,470,4.318181818181818
2753242,5,B000N2HDLY,"This is a great interview. If you are a film student, an artist, theatre person or interested in learning about your career and how to approach it view this DVD. It will give you a great insight into the concept of passion, perseverance and tenacity in the creative field.",1192579200,7,272,4.571428571428571
2753243,4,B000N2HDLY,"I will state the obvious and say your enjoyment of this DVD will depend entirely on how much admiration you have for Barbra Streisand, an inarguable legend, a multi-hyphenated megatalent and a most polarizing figure among the general public. James Lipton has been conducting these substantive, non-controversial interviews for over a dozen years and consistently infiltrates each show with the sometimes mind-numbing depth of research he gathers in preparation, i.e., his voluminous stack of blue index cards. His approach to interviewing Streisand in 2003 is no different, and in response, after a tentative beginning, she is forthcoming in her particularly idiosyncratic manner - sometimes erudite, sometimes abrupt, and sometimes snappily funny. In other words, a pure, unfettered Streisand is presented here, and at 61, she looks terrific.

He starts the conversation by probing her about her origins in Brooklyn and tracking her professional history chronologically through documented milestones and achievements. The difference between Lipton and other talk show hosts - in particular, Mike Wallace's infamously harsh profile on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/60-Minutes/dp/B000GBFRN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">60 Minutes</a>&nbsp;in 1991 - is that he does not dwell on tabloid gossip or personal exposs but rather draws out what it took for Streisand to achieve certain noteworthy performances or accomplishments. Given the time he spends explaining the hurdles he had to overcome to get her to come on the show, Lipton seems particularly worshipful and has her discuss her singing career and politics as much as her acting and filmmaking ventures. Of course, she is subjected to the familiar Bernard Pivot questionnaire, which yields some insightful responses despite its veneer of pretense, and this is followed by a more open-ended Q&A with the drama school students. This one is truly for her fans.",1190764800,27,1954,5.856140350877193
2753244,4,B000N2HDLY,"Even though I cannot see this dvd on my dvd player because the region code is not the right one , I still wanted to see this dvd. So I ordered it and saw it on my computer. It was very fun to watch and many moments I had tears in my eyes...
Barbra was very relaxed and seemed to have a good time.
A must have for all Barbra fans!!",1189123200,2,330,3.6619718309859155
2753245,5,B000N2HDLY,To hear in her own words about her rise to fame.....fantastic...James Lipton asked over 5 hours worth of questions...very enlightening...I would have loved to have all 5 hours but this is the televised version...Streisand was direct and seemed pretty straight forward on her answers....a Must for any fan!!!,1188691200,4,307,5.416666666666667
2753246,5,B000N2HDLY,"If you are a Streisand fan, this DVD is a must.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable interview and Streisand is at ease.  James Lipton ""gets"" who the real Barbra is, unlike so many other misinformed and confused interviewers and critics.",1188604800,4,230,4.725

2753257,5,B000N2HDLY,This interview really corrects the records and bad press Barbra has gotten for decade that were all obviously fabricated to sell publications.

2753263,5,B000N2HDLY,Barbara has always been known for her straightforward look on life and she could look at you that way as well. So don't ask her what she thinks unless you really want to know. I truly wish I could sit and have a cup of coffee and just talk for awhile.,1372464000,,251,3.9411764705882355

2753266,3,B000N2HDLY,"I watched this when it orginally aired and Tivo'd it..I HAD read Barbra had sat there for an 6 hour interview and they cut it down to ONE HOUR,,SO I was hoping that when they released the DVD they would add a lot more footage  they had cut out...WRONG...:( I was so disappointed the same hour cut they used for tv...STILL.. all in all a GREAT interview to watch...",1240185600,2,364,4.27536231884058
2753267,5,B000N2HDLY,"Through this interview you get a good view of Barbra Streisand. She tells about her youth, her experiences with making movies, about what is important to her. How kind she is, and how much she loves food.
It's incredible if you hear how much work and trouble she goes through to make a movie or an album or do anything else to get it right. She for example read the whole bible and the talmud for making Yentl (among things).
Also I like it that Barbra gets the chance to tell things, sometimes in intervieuws she is cut of at every second sentence she tries to say, here she is allowed to speak.
If you're a fan of Barbra get it, if you're interested in movie-making, get it, if you want to know why people love Barbra, get it!",1231286400,3,728,4.244604316546763

There is one segment where she makes a comment, that the interviewers tell her that she is the only person daring enough to use the words she does of all interviews in the actors studio, I won't ruin it by telling you, just see, and hear it for yourself.",1419465600,,315,4.266666666666667
