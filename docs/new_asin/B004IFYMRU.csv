8430684,4,B004IFYMRU,"Being a fan of Anthony Newley, I bought this movie for the music in it, and wasn't disappointed. There are a few good laughs along the way, especially with the way the British army was at the time, much like what I went through as a member of the Canadian army.",1443484800,,261,4.137254901960785
8430685,5,B004IFYMRU,"This is a great film if you're simply looking for a funny story that isn't too deep. So many of the British comedies from the 50's are overlooked but like this one, they deliver witty, dry humor. Some things in the film are just plain absurd but that's what makes the film. As usual, Lionel Jeffries steals the show and is the main reason this movie is funny.",1344470400,,359,4.294117647058823
8430686,4,B004IFYMRU,"Early Anthony Newly movie based on Elvis's drafting in US Army.
Newly is very good as the ""idol"" and supported well by British stalwarts like Lionel Jeffries,David Lodge.
Small part for the great comedian Bernie Winters and Anne Aubrey is stuning as the ""love interest""
Newly was a major talent who commenced his career with child parts in U.K. in plenty films.
Only criticism are the songs are overproduced and a bit ""corny"" but the film is very entertaining.
I've been after this one for a long time.
Really happy it is now available to all of us on DVD.",1330473600,,556,4.57
