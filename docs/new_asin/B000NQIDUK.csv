Seventh Heaven is a masterpiece of romantic sentimentality, and is one of the finest of its kind made during the silent era of film. A timeless masterpiece of silent art, it remains as beautiful today as it was in 1927.  Its director, Frank Borzage, was the greatest romanticist the movies have ever had, and its female star, Janet Gaynor, its most embraced waif. Their two films made together, Seventh Heaven and Street Angel, helped both win Academy Awards.

While Murnau's Sunrise, made at the same time as Seventh Heaven, is today embraced by critics as an artistic masterpiece, it actually rode the popular coattails of Borzage's Seventh Heaven. While both are triumphs of filmmaking, Seventh Heaven was by far the more commercially successful, and was adored by the public of the day. Borzage's lyricism in capturing true love was astounding, and reached its zenith in this silent masterwork. His films portrayed couples as if living in a netherworld where love resided in purity, untouched by the harsh world around it.

Frank Borzage was a pioneer of the soft focus look, and the lush photography of Ernest Palmer and J.A.Valentine encouraged by the director blended perfectly with the tender nature of Austin Strong's stage play. This romantic framing transformed the simple story of a lowly sewer worker and an abused waif in the slums of Paris during the 1920's into one of the most beautiful and sensitive romances the screen has ever seen.

The two stars, Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell, became ""America's Favorite Lovebirds"" making ten more movies in the following seven years till 1934. In Seventh Heaven Farrell portrays the vibrant, optimistic sewer worker, Chico, who dreams of the world above, and of rising to become a street washer like Gobin (David Butler). Diane (Janet Gaynor) is honest but forced by her abusive sister to live a debauched life that she longs to escape. In this role, Gaynor is not only sweet and endearing, but has an earthy sensuality seldom associated with her innocent countenance. There is despair and longing in her early moments, her soul damaged and her prospects for happiness dark.

'High above the streets and sewers, in Chico's seventh floor dwelling, the two fall in love in their `seventh heaven'. It happens with a charm and tenderness unique to silent films and never again reached when sound came along. The sentimental brush strokes Borzage used to paint the love between Chico and Diane are on every frame of nitrate, painting a picture of romance today's world may have lost, but which still lives on in films like Seventh Heaven.

Borzage's Seventh Heaven was the beginning of a trilogy of sorts about love and war which extended to sound, Seventh Heaven dealing with a pure and otherworldly love intruded upon by WWI. Five years later, he would use his sentimental brush again in A Farewell to Arms, showing a love found amidst the Great War and doomed by it. Six years later he would paint his picture of pure love in the aftermath of World War I, showing the time it stole from people, in Three Comrades, as yet another war loomed on the horizon. The Great War intruding upon deep and romantic love in its purest form is a recurring theme in his films.

Seventh Heaven is the most unabashedly romantic of the three, and one must see this film to really appreciate the fresh and pure ray of light it shines on faith and love. It is beautifully sentimental and startlingly wonderful. A must see film classic.",1268006400,7,3552,4.869205298013245
8180658,5,B000NQIDUK,"Probably Frank Borzage's best-known and generally best-regarded film, 7th HEAVEN was filmed at Fox with one of the first synchronized scores (also with some sound effects) though it is still considered a silent as it doesn't have dialogue, and this Hollywood Attic version utilizes a silent print with a nicely-done piano score by Keith Taylor.  The first of three films the director made starring Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor, this was a huge critical and commercial success, winning Gaynor the first Oscar for Best Actress and Borzage and screenwriter Benjamin Glazer the first prizes in their categories. Glazer adapted a recently-popular play (by Austin Strong), and Gaynor and Farrell were two of the hottest young stars, so it was all in a all a match made in ""heaven"".  Surprise then that it's taken so long for a legitimate DVD release - at least, it's surprising until you start watching and see what kind of condition the film is in. The first couple of reels in particular are pretty tatty and speckly; though it does clear up after about 20-25 minutes this remains a somewhat rough print, so viewer beware.

If you can get past the technical issues though, you are in for a rapturous Borzagian romantic fantasy, set primarily in the streets and gutters, and one spectacular 7th floor garret of a poor neighborhood in Paris just before and during the first world war. The plot is striking in its simplicity and spareness - waifish Diane, abused by her older sister, is almost beaten to death but saved by the noble if rather arrogant Chico, a sewer worker aspiring to higher things. Through Dickensian circumstance and coincidence Chico and Diane have to pretend to be married, and rather quickly fall in love and pledge to be married for real, before the God whom Chico despises and refuses. The war comes and the the two ecstatic lovers pledge to speak to each other at the same hour every day, but fate intervenes....or does it?

It's up to the brilliant studio-bound expressionistic set design, Borzage's sensitive movement between ""action"" sequences (a rapidfire, excting shot of Diane running diagonally towards the camera mirrors similar sequences in Borzage's 1925 LAZYBONES and appears to be a trademark of sorts), lyrical movements describing the heavenward thoughts and feelings of the star-crossed lovers, and closeups of his two wonderfully expressive stars. Gaynor tends to get most of the credit, but on the strength of this film at least Farrell was a terrific presence, moving pretty effortlessly from joviality to tenderness and showing such a pure optimism and decency that you never wonder that he can turn Diane around from a scared child into a confident woman in just a few minutes of screen time. The secondary cast is pretty terrific as well, and it's probably the top-to-bottom quality here that for me bumps this slightly above LAZYBONES, and excellent film that is more obviously dominated by Buck Jones' tremendous lead work, and is of a little less interest when he's not on the screen.

The ending is visionary and completely unrealistic, fantastic, and silly if you think too much about it, but the power of the film's film belief in love and truth, even in a God that I personally don't believe in, compelled me, and I hope would compel most, to want to accept it. Not many directors could ask you to take what is essentially a return from death in an otherwise ""realistic"" film and expect that you wouldn't laugh at it, but Borzage manages it.

All in all then this is absolutely essentially stuff for silent film buffs, romantics, and heck, just anybody that loves and cares about the power of cinema to move, to feel, and to create a world larger than our own dull ones.

8180660,5,B000NQIDUK,"The release of this exceptionally beautiful film has been long overdue, but with all such gems of early cinema, it has been worth the wait.  An impressive cast and crew combined to win ""Seventh Heaven"" three Academy Awards: for Best Screenplay, Best Director and Best Actress, namely Janet Gaynor.  Director Frank Borzage, who had been acting in silent films since 1913, brought all his acquired skills and talents to films like this and later ones in the 30s and 40s, giving them his special touch of soul-stirring sentiments concerning love, hope and faith.  They are also often set during the war when lovers were separated and endured anguish by having hope and faith, and ""Seventh Heaven"" is a shining example.  Struggling with poverty and poor conditions, a couple comes together under unusual circumstances, sharing a flat on the seventh floor in Paris - a traditionally romantic setting of old streets, houses and rooftop views from the cosy and charming home the man calls `heaven'.  Charles Farrell, who went on to star opposite Janet Gaynor in other successful films, put in quite a dynamic performance as the lively and optimistic Chico, always looking upwards and telling himself he is `a very remarkable fellow', which helped him rise from being a sewer worker to a street cleaner.  This vibrant optimism and confidence infected the homeless and abused young woman played superbly by Janet Gaynor, who rises above her miserable past and circumstances because of Chico.

Capturing certain images and moments with the right light and camera angle makes ""Seventh Heaven"" more than just a standard war-time love story, and in particular the references to something spiritual and even godly about the couple's love and devotion make this film even more moving, even for the non-religious.  When Chico is called to war, the couple seem to have a spiritual bond and connection, particularly at eleven o'clock every morning, at which time he had promised to `talk to her' as he left.  Suspense slowly  but surely escalates towards the end as it becomes uncertain what will become of Chico, by which time the viewer has become fully involved in the delightful story and likeable characters.

This DVD by Hollywood Attic has no special features, and the picture quality is surprisingly good, being just a touch below the standard of Kino Video or Image releases of similar silent films.  The piano accompaniment is beautifully and skilfully played by Keith Taylor, blending perfectly with the settings and moods and thereby enhancing this beautiful film even more, making it a movie well worth having in either a silent or classic film collection.",1243814400,8,2651,5.068965517241379
8180661,5,B000NQIDUK,"""I'm not used to being happy...it's funny--it hurts!"" -- Janet Gaynor (Diane)

Frank Borzage was the greatest romanticist the movies have ever had, and Janet Gaynor its greatest and most embraced waif. Their two films made together, Seventh Heaven and Street Angel, helped both win the Academy Award. People often point to Murnau's Sunrise, made at the same time, as an artistic masterpiece, forgetting that film rode the coattails of Seventh Heaven, in genuine time, and of the two, Seventh Heaven was by far the more successful and adored choice of moviegoers of the day. Both are triumphs of filmmaking. Borzage's  lyricism at capturing true love was astounding, however, and reached its zenith in the silent masterwork, Seventh Heaven. It was always as if Borzage's couples lived in another world, where love resided in purity, untouched by the harsh world around it. Austin Strong's stage play fit perfectly with the lush photography of Ernest Palmer and J.A. Valentine encouraged by Borzage, who was a pioneer of the soft focus look.

A simple story of a sewer worker and an abused waif in the slums of Paris during the 1920's is transformed by Borzage and Gaynor, as Diane, into one of the most beautiful and sensitive romances the screen has ever seen. The film begins as Chico (Charles Farrell), a sewer worker, dreams of the world above the sewers, and of being a street washer like Gobin (David Butler). Diane is sweet and honest, but fallen, doing things and living a life she also wishes to escape. Her sister's harsh beatings send her out into the streets of Paris. Gaynor is not only sweet and endearing, but with an earthy sensuality seldom associated with her innocent countenance. There is despair and longing in her early moments, her soul damaged and her prospects for happiness dark. A moment when her aunt tells her she's pretty and she nearly collapses under the weight of a kind word is when the audience falls in love with Diane. Her horrible sister chases her in a murderous rage, afterward, into the streets of Paris, surely killing her if not for sewer worker Chico.

It is no fairy tale romance, however, Chico having lost his faith in God, who never answered his two prayers; one to be a street washer; the other for the love of a good wife with yellow hair. The audience already loves Diane, so Chico's rejection of her as an unwanted street girl, while he sits around with his pals dreaming about what a remarkable fellow he is is infuriating. When a despairing Diane tries to end it all, however, he intervenes and then does so once more, so she won't have to go with the police. He must then take her home until police investigate his claim that she is his wife, so he will not lose his newfound chance to be a street washer. This opportunity has come from a kindly padre passing on the street, hearing Chico's reasoning for not believing. Along with the card, a small box with religious medals is entrusted to Chico by the padre, and the viewer begins to wonder if Divine intervention is taking a hand in the lives of Diane and Chico.

Gaynor simply glows from this point on. Her acting has been marvelous, but turns softer now, as her heart sees the good heart in Chico. High above, in Chico's seventh floor dwelling, the two fall in love in their seventh heaven. It happens with charm and tenderness, Janet Gaynor wonderful and sensitive as she aches for Chico to love her, and not turn her out once the police make their visit. The world may have lost its romance in our day, but this film never has. Viewers hearts will never forget this romance, and cling to scenes of Diane mastering the catwalk; their charming ride home as man and wife in ""Eloise.""; Diane wrapping herself in Chico's coat with tender love while he's working; a wedding dress Chico brings to her; and their prayer together for their hasty marriage to be a true one, those religious medals serving as a bond, as Chico and his pal Gobin must leave for WWI.

One has only to look at Borzage's A Farewell to Arms and Three Comrades from the sound era to see how the Great War intruding upon a pure and otherworldly love is a recurring theme in his films. Those familiar with this great director's work, recognize it as a trilogy of sorts; Seventh Heaven dealing with special and pure love being intruded upon by the outbreak of WWI, A Farewell to Arms showing a love found during the Great War, and doomed by it, and Three Comrades a love found too late, WWI having stolen lives and the time two people could have enjoyed together as another war looms on the horizon. Seventh Heaven is the most unabashedly romantic of the three, however. Their first night together in their seventh heaven takes on a charm and tenderness never reached when sound came along, and is sustained throughout the entire film. At 11:00 every day, their two hearts meet in their seventh heaven apartment, his eyes still filled with her in her wedding dress. She can feel him as though he is there, so is disbelieving, then crushed when people converge on their seventh heaven to inform her that her Chico has fallen in battle.

I cannot reveal anything further, as one must see this film to really appreciate the fresh and pure ray of light it shines on faith and love. It is beautifully sentimental and startlingly wonderful. Janet Gaynor has been sort of forgotten today, but should not be. The public adored her, and she and Charles Farrell became ""America's Favorite Lovebirds"" making a dozen or more pictures together. Her contribution to Seventh Heaven cannot be overstated. Her performance is perfect. Even without Sunrise or Street Angel she would easily have walked away with the Academy Award, at a time before it was tainted. By 1934 she was the top box office star, and had been close to it for several years. At the very least, a boxed set of the films she and Farrell made together is long overdue. Seventh Heaven is a masterpiece of romantic sentimentality, and is one of the greatest made during the silent era of film. It remains as beautiful today as it was in 1927.

This edition is a very good print, for a film this age, and can be obtained separately from the more expensive Borzage boxed set, should you wish to view this timeless masterpiece of silent art. The music by Keith Taylor, apparently recorded at a library showing, works quite well with everything onscreen. Not having heard the original score, which contains the famous ""Diane"" theme, I have no frame of reference. But it is quite nice and blends well with the story. Everyone who views this will feel a tug to experience their own piece of heaven. It is thanks to my Seventh Heaven I was able to view this most beautiful and romantic of films. A must see.",1240704000,14,6723,4.648444070647603
