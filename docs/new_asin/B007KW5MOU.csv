5094135,5,B007KW5MOU,"This is a fantastic show. Truly brilliant and exciting. It's sad that this is the last set of the show called, ""Batman: The Brave and the Bold""",1349308800,,143,4.333333333333333
5094136,3,B007KW5MOU,"I purchased BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD COMPLETE SEASON THREE for 2 main reasons:
1) To complete my BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD DVD collection;
2) And to finally enjoy the oh-so-controversial-for-American-television, never-aired-in-the-US episode THE MASK OF MATCHES MALONE! in widescreen with DVD quality.

Having said this, I was hugely disappointed to find out that THE MASK OF MATCHES MALONE! episode (from season 2) is actually presented in 4:3 (letterbox) in this DVD release, that unlike every episode in this set it doesn't include any subtitles, and to make matters worse, it's not even the original version but the edited cut for ""young viewers"" instead! ""Outrageous!"" Thankfully, I've had the opportunity to watch the original version of this episode, just like so many viewers outside the United States, so I can surely state that I can't wrap my head around of what makes it so controversial for Warner Bros. to ban it from American television and release an alternative cut on DVD as nothing more than a mere special feature.

If it weren't for some of the outstanding episodes that make this such a terrific and enjoyable DVD set (the series finale MITEFALL! comes to mind), I'd have rated it 2 stars instead of 3. BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD COMPLETE SEASON THREE is definitely a treat for fans of the series that have been collecting the episodes on DVD -- especially when so many shows never get released on DVD in its entirety -- but also a sign of disregard and disrespect from Warner Bros. Home Video, especially for the hardcore fans.",1348358400,10,1565,4.879699248120301
5094137,4,B007KW5MOU,"The Dark Knight hangs up his ""Hammers of Justice"" in Batman: The Brave and the Bold - The Complete Third Season. Batman (Diedrich Bader) might be the World's Greatest Detective, but even he's not above a little superhero help battling such villains likes the Joker, Lex Luther, Ra's Al Ghul and Equinox. When he's not fighting crime in the streets of Gotham City, he's in the orbiting Watchtower, using his cunning, resourcefulness and vast array of gadgets along side the new Justice League International (JLI). In theses final 12 action-packed episodes of the Cartoon Network series, Batman teams up with Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Captain Atom and Space Ghost against the forces of evil. Based on the comic book series published by DC Comics, this light adaptation offers an amusing mix of old-school comic book action and refreshing humor. The 2-disc DVD set includes such standout episodes Shadow of the Bat!, Night of the Batmen!, Scorn of the Star Sapphire!, Time Out for Vengeance!, Triumvirate of Terror!, Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above the Earth!, and Mitefall!.

Batman: The Brave and the Bold - The Complete Third Season is a pretty standard DVD release, but if you already purchased the previous DVD sets then you're pretty familiar with its presentation. All 12 episodes of the Cartoon Network animated series are presented in 16X9 widescreen format. The picture quality is surprisingly sharp and its 2.0 Dolby surround sound is pretty solid. The interactive menus are exactly similar to the previous DVD releases. Its most interesting bonus features are a Batman: The Brave and the Bold digital comic and the bonus episode The Mask of Matches Malone that wasn't aired in the US due to a brief sexual innuendo during the episode's highlighted musical number. Overall, Batman: The Brave and the Bold - The Complete Third Season scores a ""B-"".",1345248000,,1891,5.1
5094138,5,B007KW5MOU,"I have reviewed every collection of this series, and nothing has changed with the final set; Batman the Brave and the bold is still the best Batman property since Batman: The Animated Series. For those who are able to look past the bright, colorful visuals, and plethora of guest characters, you will find one of the most enjoyable Batman experiences available today.

The Episodes on this set are wildly imaginative; so much so that purists will probably be put off, at least initially. They range from ""Night of the Batmen"", where batman is incapacitated and it is up to Aquaman, Green Arrow, Captain Marvel, and Plastic Man to don the cowl, and keep gotham safe. As weird as that may sound, this episode is pure fun, and a joy to watch. Other stand outs are the never before seen in the states ""The Mask of Matches Malone"", ""Shadow of the Bat"", ""Scorn of the Star Sapphire"", and ""Powerless"".

Special mention has to be made of the final episode of the series however, ""Mitefall"". In this meta episode, Batmite does a fantastic job breaking down why the series is ending, and the disconnect of the so-called ""purists"", whose baseless, closed minded, ignorance eventually doomed this excellent series.

Now, as with all the other sets, this is only available in Standard Definition, to my great disappointment, but it still looks and sounds great. A welcome change is the inclusion of actual special features, though not as many as the final set deserves. I am STILL holding out hope that if enough people buy these sets, those stingy money grubbers running WB will relent and finally release the Blu Ray collection, filled with special features, that us loyal fans so richly deserve. To be fair though, I'm surprised they released the entire series.

When all is said and done, we received three outstanding, and criminally underrated, seasons and it is a joy to see. This set is absolutely worth buying, not even considering the rock bottom price it goes for. Please support this incredible series. An absolute buy, worthy of Batman.",1341878400,31,2036,4.841954022988506
5094139,5,B007KW5MOU,"Season three struck gold for this series. It's funny and cool, imaginative and addictive. Aquaman steals the show as a blustery, pompous yapper who'll remind Seinfeld fans of J. Peterman. It's all here - a celebrity roast, complete with Jeffery Ross, clever dialogue and jokes, even an Aquaman sitcom with a ""live"" audience! I love how Justice Society has Spectre, and Plasticman make s a terrific appearance in the bonuses. Even DC fan fave the Creeper is on board. Bliss for Batman cartoon fans and fans of cool TV shows, in general.",1341187200,8,535,4.826086956521739
5094140,5,B007KW5MOU,"If you favor the 50's version of Batman, this is the last of the series.  I was hoping this would run longer. In fact I prefer it to the 90's animated series.  In one episode, Batman gets a chance to battle Superman and of course they become friends. The many classic team ups are taken straight from the comics.  I favor this version because it isn't dark.  It's the Batman I grew up with in the Adam West tradition. If you look at the style of the cartoon it's pure retro 50's.  This may be why it didn't become popular with younger fans.  The quality transends all the critics who say this is a light version of the caped crusader.  The Frank Miller Dark Knght has been wearing thin because it's been done so often. Overall I'd have to say this one is a great addition to your collection.",1340150400,27,791,4.268456375838926

5094145,5,B007KW5MOU,Great to have found the final installment  of this campy addition to the Batman TV lineup.. Too bad The Brave and the Bold ended so quickly. Same as Beware The Batman which followed. Both ended too soon.,1453248000,,203,4.486486486486487
5094146,4,B007KW5MOU,Was a little let down with the last season - loved the 1st season and 2nd too the end where they had Bat Mite ruin the show and have them jump the shark was hilarious - honestly it deserves 3.5 stars it was a cuter lighter version of golden/silver age Batman. Hammers of Justice! I loved the catchphrases and the Birds of Prey skit - WAS AWESOME (season 2) good show!,1450742400,,367,4.183098591549296

5094156,5,B007KW5MOU,"My 5 year old loves this batman! he is always looking him up on Netflix so I decided to get him some DVDs for the car where we don't have internet service. He takes his portable player and his movies and gets in the car. Season 3 keeps him busy for a while, and the great news is he loves it so much he watches it again and again. Batman in general has a little violence and a little scare, but he is a mature 5 year old and handles it fine. I do have a 3 year old I babysit, and I think it is too old for him. He does say it is scary. In general the Brave and the Bold's tone is lighter, which makes it more enjoyable for younger viewers.. and their moms!",1423526400,,656,3.795620437956204
5094157,5,B007KW5MOU,"I wish this series had lasted about four more seasons.  It had the right mixture of comedy, action and drama, along with nods to all the previous Batman incarnations.  The voice acting was top notch as well, and the lack of concern about any real continuity worked well with this show.  It's just that great. The ending of the show was a bit weird, but well worth watching.",1423180800,,373,4.455882352941177

5094166,4,B007KW5MOU,"I just ordered this collection because of Bronze Tiger. This Batman wore on my nerves and the theme also wore me out. Glad it was cancelled when it was because as expansive as the DC Universe was, the same characters reappeared and that was disappointing.",1399852800,,255,4.688888888888889
5094167,3,B007KW5MOU,"I didn't hate this show, in fact, it was quit enjoyable, but it was losing it's flavor quickly (not as quick as 2004's The Batman) but still, this type of show, unless they are gonna use all of Batman's nemesis's should not continue on, it was fun while it lasted, but it's time for it to end, it was a show well worth a look, and thankfully THIS season wasn't split into two parts for their rip-off sales.

Batman: The Brave and the Bold - The Complete Season Three *** out of *****

Violent Content: 3/10 - Strong Stylized Action Violence.",1394150400,,541,4.346534653465347
5094168,5,B007KW5MOU,"I bought this season's DVDs used, yet they were in excellent shape. The episodes were all good. I just wish they made more 2D Batman series. The new 3D Batman is odd in the sense that it doesn't have that comic book look that most Batman cartoons have. The stories were interesting. The obscure superheroes are very entertaining. The cartoony style suits the stories really well. Overall, a great series.",1391472000,,404,4.785714285714286
5094169,5,B007KW5MOU,Batman Brave and the bold was awesome to watch lots of humor lots of adventure. I purchased all seasons. And wish there were more,1384041600,,129,4.416666666666667
5094170,5,B007KW5MOU,my 4-y/o grandson is obsessed with super heroes.  These old cartoons are the best.  He watches them every day for his nap.,1381363200,,122,4.5
5094171,1,B007KW5MOU,I bought this (from Target not Amazon)for our 4 year old grandson. It has very cheap graphics and was not as good as I thought. Will be sending it back. I ordered the Batman animated series for his birthday and I'm hoping it is better because it had good reviews too. Just my personal opinion. I have read many of the other reviews and they stated how good it was but it's not to me.,1378512000,,383,4.12
5094172,4,B007KW5MOU,"I liked this more than I thought I would. It's "" old school"" and kind of campy and fun. Recommend.",1378166400,,98,3.95
5094173,4,B007KW5MOU,"At times Season 3 of the Brave and the Bold does seem like they were running out of ideas.  John Wilkes Boom is a dreadful low point to me.  However, you get a team up I never thought would happen - Batman and Space Ghost.  Brilliant.

Even better, the last episode, Mitefall, is perhaps the best final episode of any TV show I've seen and easily in my Top 10 of all time favorite Batman animated episodes.  Pick this up for that episode alone.",1377907200,4,444,4.238095238095238
5094174,5,B007KW5MOU,"I love this TV show because it shows how even superheroes make mistakes and own up to them. Even they aren't perfect. I also like how this show has actual plots and characters you care about. Marvel seems to be in it for the money, but DC Comics seems to care about the relation between the viewer and the characters on the show; making sure you can connect to some of the characters in a personal way.",1374364800,6,402,4.233766233766234
5094175,5,B007KW5MOU,"I really enjoyed this series and season 3 is the icing on the cake. They showcase tons of characters and story`s.
Three years is perfect for an animated superhero show. You get to tell all the stories you want and wrap things up with a pretty red bow. Many series now only last 1 year whether it is popular or not. DC and Marvel take note!
Why do I like Brave and Bold. Because it is fun and doesn`t take it self seriously.",1370995200,3,423,4.108433734939759
5094176,4,B007KW5MOU,"Batman Brave And The Bold is a fresh new look on the Dark knight.  Although, I would have liked to see more of the older characters like Joker, Penguin, The Riddler, Cat Woman, MR.. Freeze, Scarecrow, and Two Face.  But the series has a great pairing of Super heroes such as Green Lantern, plastic Man, Green Arrow, Aquaman and etc... The theme was very enjoyable and it was good to see Batman back in traditional D.C. Looks again.  But Batman The Animated Series still remains to be my favorite all time Batman Series.  They showed the classic villains, but my favorite DC Series is Justice League & Justice League Unlimited.  That was the best show ever! I also recommend Batman beyond and Superman The Animated Series, Teen Titans and Super Friends.  If you like these sort of Super Hero shows like I do. Season 3 to Brave and The Bold however was not the greatest nor the worse season.  I understand why the writers ended the series.  If they would have added more classic villains and Batgirl and Change Robin's lousy outfit.  Superman would have been nice and why not Wonder Woman? The Flash looks more like Flash Gordon! What is up with that???",1367366400,,1151,4.602941176470588
5094177,4,B007KW5MOU,"This was my personal favorite of the may animated Batman series made since the 80's.  It is a light-hearted but not overly campy Silver Age Batman combined with just about every major and minor super hero or super villain in the DC universe.  Even fans of the much more serious DCAU will love these.  TDK and TDKR fans may not enjoy them so much without a child or 2 present...

I hoped for some additional content with the DVD set but sadly there is none.  This is the only reason I did not give this 5 stars, however I do like that the DVD's load immediately to the DVD menu and not the obligatory commercials that can not be skipped.  I thank WB for acknowledging that we already spent the money to purchase these and deserve to be spared the advertising push.  If only more DVD distributors would take note.",1367107200,2,811,4.366666666666666
5094178,5,B007KW5MOU,"This is the most fun and entertaining version of Batman ever. Its a sad that it ended after only 3 seasons. It feels like a retro trip the the silver age of DC comics, when comic's were for everyone.",1359936000,,199,4.128205128205129
5094179,5,B007KW5MOU,"Camp, fun and a great nod and love letter to the silver age way of story telling for comics.
BBATB is a show that indulges in the wacky antics of that time in comics that had fun with its source material and not take it so so seriously and make it dark and morbid.
The show does occasionally travel into serious tone stories but never loses its feeling of a show that makes uses of the greater DC Comic universe.
it uses a lot of DC Comic characters not just Batman.
We get to see a revision of Aquaman that has become a fan favorite [if only he got a spin-off] and we get golden age heroes like Plastic Man.
This exploration of the DCU is great for fans of the comics, cartoon lovers and those who just want to have fun.",1359849600,2,721,4.084507042253521
