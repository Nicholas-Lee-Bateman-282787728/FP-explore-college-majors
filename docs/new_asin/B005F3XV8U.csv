4671314,5,B005F3XV8U,"This reminds me of the old Hitchcock stuff. Mary divorces Steve and moves into an apartment. Steve is of questionable character. Mary gets calls from Rose asking for Bobby. Rose claims she lives in the 1970's. At first she thinks a friend of Steve's is behind this. Her and Rose become semi-friends. Weird things start to happen. Whatever changes Rose makes to the pantry in the 1970's materializes in the present day. This really spokes out Mary. Steven violates his restraining order and Mary gets help from her French teacher. Upon doing some research she discovers a Rose really did live there. Is this supernatural or an elaborate hoax?

The film hooks you from the first phone call. You can't wait for the phone to ring. Then at some point, you don't want the phone to ring. But it does...

4671490,3,B005F3XV8U,"I've just started watching this movie on Netflix and I just had to pause it and spew my wrath (sorry)!
I hate movies that try to make the most mundane of situations ominous.
Case in point: the lead character, Mary,  goes into a typical super-market, think Walmart, and it's dimly lit and filled with flashes of movement that Mary sees out of the corner of her eye.
I've been to Walmarts at night.  At 1 a.m., at 2 a.m., all the way up till 6 a.m. and they are never poorly lit, nor are they creepy.  Even weirdos look wholesome (sometimes funny) under the extra bright lights of Walmart.  I also agree with the reviewer that said, ""just hang up""!  Or get a brand new CELL PHONE!  Her apartment has a dial phone!!!!  Is this set in the 60's?
I try to suspend disbelief but for cryin' out loud; give me something to work with here.
Oh yeah, I'll finish watching this movie but I won't like it.  I won't ""hang up"" because I paid good money for this movie!",1403481600,,952,4.25
4671491,5,B005F3XV8U,I thought this movie was fantastic. The problem is people confuse horror and thriller. This is more thriller than horror. Kind of a VERY dark version of Back to the Future and Frequency. What happens when you change the past so much that it changes who you are in the present? This is low budget but in a good way and although the genre bills it as supernatural thriller it is more psychological thriller than anything else. I am not sure why people are having trouble understanding it. Either they are under thinking it or over thinking it. Its actually kind of straight forward considering it has to do with time and its affects on a person's personality. Anyway good movie.,1402358400,,676,4.595041322314049

4671493,5,B005F3XV8U,"THE CALLER tells a superb story that mixes Twilight Zone, Frequency, and Edgar Allen Poe into a potent cocktail. The set-up is simple: A young woman takes an apartment in an effort to leave a bad situation and get a new lease on life. When she discovers an old phone, however, she begins receiving calls from...well, it's best if you enter into this situation knowing as little as possible. Suffice it to say, we've got an odd combination of genre elements that work together beautifully. Horror, thriller, time/space paradoxes, oh my! These old ideas combine into something new and effective. Rachelle Lefevre is a strong heroine and a terrific actor who SELLS it. Director Mathew Parkhill puts Story at the fore and is apparently oblivious to the modern mandate for shaky cam, rapid editing, and CGI shenanigans, because he put none of it in here, and the results are remarkably refreshing. This film is some kind of best-kept secret, so spread the word because it deserves a higher profile among genre afficionados.",1388966400,,1018,4.924418604651163

4671547,5,B005F3XV8U,"The atmosphere of this movie, created by the location and direction, contributes greatly to the suspense. Can't say much more without giving anything away. Simply that this is one of my all-time favorite scary/supernatural/suspense movies. Trivia: The late Brittany Murphy was considered for this role. Rachelle Lefevre does a great job. Although Brittany would have been a great choice, Rachelle gives nothing away and allows the suspense to build.",1383609600,,449,5.521739130434782
4671548,4,B005F3XV8U,"All Mary Kee wants out of life is to move on with hers now that she's divorced her abusive husband and gotten her own apartment.  And at first, things seem to be moving in that direction.  She's taking time off work, she's taking a few night classes at the college, where she meets a mathematics professor who seems to like her.  There is still the occasional visit from the mean ex, who just doesn't understand that 500 feet means 500 feet and he can't come any closer, but Mary's a woman discovering her inner strength, and she's not going to put up with too much nonsense from him.

The only real major concern for Mary now is the disturbed woman who keeps calling her.  At first, it seemed like a wrong number, the woman was looking for Bobby.  But she had the number and the address right.  Must have been the person who lived here before me, Mary thinks.  But then Rose says Bobby proposed to her when he got back from Vietnam.  That was over 35 years ago, Mary says.

Some time later, Rose calls again and says she's going to draw something inside the pantry for Mary to find.  Mary does find it, a picture of a rose, but it's hidden beneath a layer of paint.

That's because I'm calling you from 1979, Rose claims.

Mary thinks it's all an elaborate trick being played by her ex, until Rose calls again one day and says she took Mary's advice and got rid of her cheating boyfriend Bobby, and no one will ever find him.  Then Mary goes to the pantry and finds it's been bricked up.  It wasn't like that the last time she went in there, and this seems too much even for her ex-husband.

She tells Rose to never call her again.  But that was the exact wrong thing to say to an unstable woman who lives in the same town you lived in 32 years earlier, and knows how to find your younger self.

THE CALLER is a very intelligent thriller from writer Sergio Casci and director Matthew Parkhill.  Originally written as a short titled ""Rose"" in 1998, THE CALLER stars Rachelle Lefevre from ""Under the Dome"" as Mary.  Lefevre carries the movie very well, giving a very subtle but believable performance.  She comes across as someone tired of being the victim and is making the necessary changes in her life.  She has her moments of fear against her ex when he shows up, but Lefevre displays a growing confidence throughout the movie that makes us root all the more for her character.  Which makes her trials against Rose all the more suspenseful.

The premise of the plot is full of tension and a pervading sense of hopelessness.  Mary can't give Rose the friendship she wants, but if Mary doesn't give Rose something, anything, there's no telling what will happen.  With the kind of one-way access road going on where Rose can get to Mary 32 years before Mary can even bat an eye, really, how can Mary hope to protect herself?

Stephen Moyer stars as Johnny, the college professor/hopeful boyfriend, and for a change I actually found him pleasant and charming.

Casci's script is well-crafted and Parkhill's direction creates an excellent atmosphere.  A few of the plot twists were predictable from miles away, but it didn't make them any less effective when they came, and there were a couple of really glaring plot holes in the third act, but nothing that couldn't be ignored for the greater good of the movie as a whole.  Overall, I very much enjoyed THE CALLER, and can recommend it without hesitation.",1382832000,,3404,4.505709624796085
4671549,2,B005F3XV8U,"I don't know where I heard of this movie or why I decided to get it but it wasn't totally awful, if you're half asleep.  It boasts poor production quality and while I'm sure it's original idea was promising, the writers did little to explain how the paranormal activity was possible. I don't regret seeing it, but I wouldn't watch it again.",1382400000,,340,4.483870967741935
4671550,5,B005F3XV8U,Loved it. Stephan Moyer from True Blood is in this and his acting is always good and he also provides some always welcome 'eye candy'.,1382313600,,134,4.4
4671551,3,B005F3XV8U,"A decent movie with an interesting idea. The trouble was that almost every scene was pretty much pitch black! I know that lighting can create certain moods, but it has to be used sparingly in my opinion. I'm sorry, but if I'm alone in my house late at night getting some unusual phone calls and having an unstable ex-husband/wife in the picture, you turn an f'ing light on! This dark lighting effect gets rather annoying as you can't see most of what is actually happening. With that said though, this is still an OK movie. The concept was by far the best thing going for this film. It allowed for some creative writing to weave tons of weird scenarios and create some rather well put together tension. Yes, it develops some questions that don't get answered in certain cases, but still lets the viewer's mind race formulating strategies and alternate timelines.

Certainly worth a view for the plot alone, but it's not going to win an Emmy or anything.",1382227200,,953,4.6390532544378695
4671552,4,B005F3XV8U,"It wasn't the best movie, but it wasn't horrible. I guess I expected it to be worse with all the bad reviews it got. Granted she probably could've came up with a more elaborate way of killing the old lady (or even pay her off with football scores, stock ideas, and lotto numbers), but it was still good concept that felt more original than most movies that come out now. Especially how the main character's view on murder twists from moral outrage to justifiable. Maybe I just like movies where the protagonist ends up disturbed. A lot of people hated the antique phone, but seriously if I found an antique phone I'd use it too.",1377475200,,628,4.469565217391304

4671555,5,B005F3XV8U,"THE CALLER is about a woman named Mary Kee (Rachelle Lefevre), who has just moved into a run-down apartment. She is in the middle of a bitter divorce from her uber-macho, violent husband. She has no chance to get settled into her new digs before a strange phone call starts her down a path of dark mystery and murderous events. Mary finds herself in the midst of a nightmarish, time / space anomaly. This movie plays like a superb, extra-long episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, w/ some modern, more disturbing twists thrown in. Stephen Moyer (RESTRAINT, THE BARRENS, OPEN HOUSE, TV's TRUE BLOOD) is great as Mary's hapless love interest. Luis Guzman plays a gardener who knows important secrets about Mary's predicament. If you enjoy horror built on suspense and bizarre situations, then you should watch THE CALLER right now!...",1368057600,3,824,4.892857142857143
4671572,3,B005F3XV8U,"After a messy divorce, Mary is left to live alone in a new home... Or so it would seem... Mary begins receiving strange phone calls from an old woman that claims to be from the past, and the two strike up an odd friendship until Rose begins to show cracks in her fractured personality. Every time Mary upsets Rose over the phone, Rose is somehow able to manipulate the past to cause trouble for Mary in the future, with dire consequences! THE CALLER gets off to a thrilling start, but eventually digresses into the supernatural equivalent of BACK TO THE FUTURE. By the end, the film becomes so laughably absurd and far-fetched that it loses all credibility. Twisted timelines require a huge suspension of disbelief, and often result in plot holes and logical inconsistencies. THE CALLER is no exception. The dramatic events that Rose initiates in the past have only a single small impact on the future. This leaves the audience focused on their confusion, and not on the film. While these things often distract, THE CALLER is fairly played by TWILIGHT's Rachelle Lefevre, and director Matthew Parkhill does manage to bring a creepy mood to an otherwise messy script.

The phone calls in this film are the best part; Rose's voice and actions are chilling, even if you don't see her throughout the film. You know she is an unstable character just by the sound of her voice, which is an accomplishment. But, the movie also focuses on Mary and her divorce. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but the cheap, repetitive jump scares that accompany this part of the story are ineffective and poorly explained. Is she haunted by Rose or her ex-husband? I won't spoil the film but her husband appears multiple times and, most of the time, he is a hallucination. Also, I say the jump scares are cheap and ineffective because they're completely random and basically pointless; they may jolt you for a moment, but you'll quickly shrug them off. Basically, the phone calls were scarier than the jump scares. The ending was ok, I had mixed feelings about it. The acting was decent, and the pacing was fast.

The Caller is a decent time-killer; the concept and the phone calls were scary, the jump-scares and divorce side-story were not. As of 10/20/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, I recommend renting or dreaming before purchasing.

The Caller has violence and blood, and nudity and sex.",1350691200,2,1426,4.696

To the people who are saying how awful the cinematography was - It's supposed to have a dingier, darker atmosphere to fit with the tone of the movie, which is creepy! I didn't have a problem with it at all. I really liked the story, even though it was creepy and weird. I felt like the storyline was different than a lot of horror movies now  a days, being more sci fi and psychological in a sense. It's kind of a thriller, honestly, because it is very ""edge of the seat."" The acting was well done. Nothing phenomenal, but it was believable, and I found myself rooting for the main character which usually means they are doing a good job with the role. I didn't have a clue to how it would end, and I was satisfied. The ending is definitely one that I would describe as poetic irony.

4671615,2,B005F3XV8U,"This is sort of a time slip movie where it appears two parallel universes are overlapping.

Here's the scoop. Mary moves into an apartment to get away from her soon to be ex-husband. She starts getting threatening calls from a gal called Rose who might be running on a different calendar. She seems to be tuned in around the Viet Nam war. She meets a new guy. He seems nice. Talks with the building's janitor. He seems nice. But do they really exist? And Rose keeps calling as creepy things start to happen. Now Rose is trying to kill her but not her the adult. Her the child.

This is messy. I was interested to begin with, but as the facets of the story started to come together it began to annoy me. I didn't think it hung together. I suppose I have to compare it to the movie ""Triangle."" But there you see the different, overlapping worlds. Here, the other world only exists on the other end of the phone. What if Mary saw herself in danger as a child instead of just hearing her? And, though maybe I missed it, what does Mary's abusive husband have to do with anything? Is he just there to pose an immediate threat? And then there are the old photos with the creepy, indistinct, images of Rose in the background. That's getting tired.

It was shot and cut OK. The perfromances were decent enough. The sound design was overwrought. There is a problem with any soundtrack that makes itself that noticeable.

Person tries to break contact.  Entity doesn't like this and plays rough.  Person pushes back.  Entity reveals true malevolent self.  Person is backed into a corner and makes a desperate play to win it all.  We've seen this storyline a million times already (and done much better).  Adding a domineering and abusive ex-husband as a second creepy entity did nothing for the film.  Stick to the main storyline.  My suggestion is that if there is bad weather and cable, satellite, and streaming are not available, and you can't rent a video somewhere, consider watching this.  Better yet, call someone instead.

4671617,3,B005F3XV8U,"The Caller isn't all that effective as a psychological thriller nor is it that smart and you can honestly drive right through the holes in this one but for what it's worth I found myself entertained and engaged in the mystery despite feeling like the film nearly collpases under it's own weight.
The Caller revolves around Mary a depressed recently divorced young woman who has just moved into her even more depressing little apartment. Soon enough she starts recieving phone calls of a woman who claims she is from the past and desperatly needs a friend. Unlucky for Mary the woman is also seriously disturbed and soon uses the past to destroy Mary's present.
The Caller would be something Rod Serling would write in his worse days. The film isn't intelligent nor is it scary in anyway imaginable but it's also perfectly watchable. The film does manage an impressive little atmosphere throughout and there are a few decent albeit confusing plot twists here and there but it just never elevates to anything above average. It just simmers until it's eye roll worthy final scene and never takes off. Rod Serling would rightfully trash this one amazon shoppers and start from scratch!
The Caller also struggles to properly identify itself. You'll groan as you notice every part of town needs better lighting. You'll mutter when the lead sees a figure in her old photos she just never noticed before. Really the list goes on and on but I don't have all night ;)  Maybe if The Caller had a few more capable people behind the camera  and a much more talented screenwriter with ides of his own then we would've got a more satisfying finished product.
But even if I was hard on it it's not all bad really! It's still rather interesting and I wasn't bored so I say give it a watch and judge for yourself :) If you aren't familar with The Twilight Zone or the horror genre you'll likely dig it much more then I did.

I watch movies mainly to be entertained, not to play cinema ivestigator.  Give me the clues, involve me in the mystery, but don't expect me to finish the writer's job.
THE CALLER posits time distortion at one point and then suggests a haunted phone, child abuse, ghosts, attempted murder, bodies behind walls.  Not to mention the time shifts that never make sense.  That's the movie's downfall--it doesn't make sense.  Add the hideous lighting and lack of sustainable tension, you get one frustrating film!

Didn't the prospectus warn you that you'll probably lose all of your money? I've heard good things about the Red One cameras (4K digital resolutions and all of that for under $20K) but if seeing is believing, well then I've seen better video clips shot with an iPhone compared to the dimly lit shadow-figures found fading incoherently from one fuzzy frame to the next in this fog-filled flick. Did the DI colorist use a box of crayons for primary and secondary color corrections instead of video scopes that measure luminance and saturation and color levels? I had to adjust the brightness and contrast levels on my TV to compensate for what appeared to be one poorly lit scene after another which worked for a while until being temporarily blinded by a sudden bursting blast of bright white light (usually coming in from a background window that wasn't masked by the colorist before cranking down the luma levels enough to discourage our sun from wanting to charge royalties for having an uncredited lead role). Other reviews here and elsewhere have covered the countless plot holes (a polite way to refer to inconsistencies found within a ridiculously absurd script) so I won't even get started on those except to say that when all was said and done, I knew I had wasted my time and energy trying to make sense out of a plot that makes no sense to anyone who has stopped wearing bibs and diapers.

4671655,4,B005F3XV8U,"Let us make something clear first before i start my review of this film.
It seems Amazon have made a mistake, mixing the reviews of two different films in the same place, as i have noticed people are reviewing this film "" the Caller 2011 "" and another film from the 80s with the same name starring Malcolm Mcdowel, which i have not seen.
So my review is for the newest 2011 film starring the lovely and beautiful Rachelle Lafevre. To be honest, i was not expecting much out of this film, i was thinking it was another slasher Horror film involving prank calls, but to my surprise, this film was much more and the plot was more twisted than i expected.
the story in brief and without giving any clues or hints to details, is that of a lady called Marry who is recently divorced and is constantly being harrassed by her Ex, she moves to a new apartement with a creepy looking phone. soon after she starts getting wierd phone calls from a strange women, who brings unpleasant surprises to Marry and to us viewers as well !
the plot is creepy, thrilling and intriguing, and the acting was above average to my surprise. the leading actress Rachelle is someone whom i didn't really know before this film, but i really enjoyed her performance, not to mention she was really adorable and beautiful, forget Angilena Jolie !! Rachelle is really charming
In general, quite an enjoyable film with very good acting and an intriguing plot, however, it did have some minor plot holes, but not too much to harm the movie. A pleasant surprise from a low budget and a hidden gem that can easily compete with big budget Hollywood films, highly recommended. 4.5 stars",1322956800,2,1647,4.548821548821548

4671658,5,B005F3XV8U,"For all the negative reviews I've read from reviewers on this movie, I am very inclined to clarify one thing: There are TWO PREMISES HERE. These you will see as the plot develops. The first premise is a QUANTUM TIME LOOP. The movie begins with this premise. If you have any intelligence and some understanding of science, you'll get this right off the bat - otherwise, don't watch this, it's too complicated for you to understanding... The SECOND PREMISE is PSYCHOLOGICAL. This premise is most clearly seen at the end, and when you look at the plot in retrospect, it's entirely clear that a TIME LOOP MAY NEVER HAVE EXISTED! As the TIME LOOP changes, MARY'S HISTORY IS TOO. As ROSE CHANGES the PAST it becomes MARY'S REAL PAST. By the end of the movie she is IN THE HOUSE OF THE WOMAN WHO ABDUCTED HER AND HURT HER AS A CHILD! This leads up to the idea that perhaps there was never a time loop, that perhaps Mary's having a psychotic breakdown and imagining what looks like a time warp, and that MAYBE she's returned to Rose's apartment (where she was abducted and held as a child) to she kill and hide her abusive husband (who has stalked her ALL THE WAY BACK TO PUERTO RICO) in the wall where Rose's victims lay undiscovered! A psychotic break that leads to an unconscious plan to lure and murder her husband!

THE CHANGE IN THE PERCEPTION OF REALITY = THE CHANGE IN QUANTUM REALITY. The First is the psychological premise in the movie, and the second is it's scientific premise. The reason WHY none of the many WHY's you keep bringing up are never answered is because AS THE PAST CHANGED, SO WOULD EVERYTHING that the whys would have explained - so explaining all the WHYS would have been pointless, seeing how it all would have changed anyway!

To get this movie think: Beginning to End = TIME LOOP, and End to Beginning = PSYCHOSIS. It's brilliant! 5 STARS. Fantastic movie with fantastics twists and reversals! What seems impossible becomes entirely probably and then almost obvious!

I'll tell you how: A perfectly crafted plot, dead on performances, good use of a score that while plays in the background makes you eat your nails, and a GREAT script brought to life by good acting. Those are the key elements that happen behind scenes, and make a movie, simply great. No gratuitous CGI, no cheesy one liners, just a good old school thriller, with an amazing plot and great performances. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen and don't get me wrong, I love Hollywood blockbusters. I'm a sucker for movies like Avatar or planet of the Apes.

Mary begins receiving strange phone calls in her new, depressing apartment. The actress playing Mary does a very convincing job as well as the woman doing the voice on the phone. The movie begins to fall apart, how ever, when Mary enters the food closet off the kitchen after one of the strange calls. She is upset, but we, the viewers, don't really understand why. The closet was never really shown up until this point. Later, it is revealed that suddenly, a brick wall had been built in it that was not there a few minutes before.

And that sets the plot of the rest of the movie. Things will happen, characters will appear, only in the next scene to be revealed that they/it never happened or existed. The caller is doing things in the past and Mary is finding them in the present. That alone, could have made the movie very creepy, but when the plot twists and fake people are thrown in, it got muddled and confusing.

Still, this could have been a superior supernatural thriller if the photography had been better. As it is, the DVD projects muddily onto the screen. Also, the film was shot in Puerto Rico, but doesn't take advantage of that setting. Perhaps some shots of the Island's primordial lushness could have suggested a floating time frame. But Puerto Rico is usually presented as squalid, ugly, and industrial, without being ominous. Our eyes strain to make out what's happening in the murky gloom, inside and out. What's more, the presence of the heroine and a variety of English-speaking characters is only sketchily and unconvincingly explained. So the viewer gets the feeling that the choice of Puerto Rico as locale was strictly a matter of shooting on the cheap - adding another disappointing element to the film's generally poor production values.

In particular Lefevre, who was tossed into the role at the last moment and might be well served to use that method for future roles, looked very comfortable.

Brief storyline:
Mary moves into an apartment in about 2010 that was inhabited by Rose in 1979. Rose calls Mary from around 1979 which becomes obsessively more frequent. They both acknowledge that their connection is happening for a reason. Both Rose and Mary have issues with males close to them and just in general. ""Men don't change ever!"" Then Mary suggests to Rose, while thinking of solving her own problems, to ""just get rid of him."" At this point you see that Rose instantly alters the future by changing the past and more than once.

Spoiler (read when confused after watching the film):
The rotary phone in Puerto Rico in the 70s would not be unusual. Using a phone as a vehicle for the past to communicate with the present is common in film. The phone was shown, in deleted scenes, being found in a box in the pantry coincidentally it was a phone cord used by Rose to hang herself. Rose lived close to where Mary (as a child) lived so she is able to threaten Mary (as a child) as well as people close to her. Rose kills her boyfriend Bobby and Mary's friends George and John (but when John was a boy). Thus the future changes and memories of each from the moment of death ceases. Rose wraps them all in the same old burlap and rope tucking them into the pantry while building a brick wall to hide the evidence. Rose eventually becomes upset with older Mary and takes it out on young Mary by spilling hot cooking oil consequently we see the burn marks instantly appear on the older Mary. Mary, in response, tries to get Rose to kill herself and in failing to do so Rose gets even more upset and tries to kill the visiting young Mary. The young Mary protects herself by breaking a wardrobe mirror and uses the broken glass to disable Rose. In 2010 we see the the now broken wardrobe mirror as well as a now appearing scar in Mary's palm where she held the glass. Both the young and old Mary are trying to protect themselves from Rose at the same time. As for Mary's ex (Steven) who several times threatens (e.g. Wedding photo with ""Till death do us part."" written on the back as well as stalking) she eventually says, ""Last chance Steven."" and to which he says, ""Yeah. Or what?"" which is why Mary's dispatching and tucking him into the newly re-bricked pantry along with the others fits into the story. She not only is re-enacting Rose but is singing her Shafto ""broken heart"" song at the end.

Problems:
Most of the ages and times just don't match up e.g. the gravestone used for the missing young John appears to say 1924. Rose was in her 40s in the '70s and appears not to have aged and still moves like she in her 40s. Rose did not die when she hung herself according to deleted scenes which changes the story considerably such as how can she be calling from the 70s while also in the present where she again attempts to kill the now older Mary. Without seeing the deleted scenes we have Rose in two separate time periods at once. What do the previous occupants (Mr. Mrs. Alvarez) of Mary's apartment have to do with the story. The alternate ending of a refurbished apartment with ringing phone makes no sense. The reason for the two scenes with blood on her finger is not clear. The subway and dream scenes just add confusion. Why didn't Mary search for Ruse's grave, or get rid of the phone, or call the police or phone company to trace?  Generally too many holes with poorly developed backgrounds. Poorly thought out plot loose ends and editing made the movie more confusing than it should be.

The recent movie ""Enter Nowhere"" also offers a thoughtful time-space continuum conundrum. These movies, especially with low budgets, are difficult to pull off so I applaud whenever somewhat successful.",1318982400,2,4416,4.627551020408164

4671706,4,B005F3XV8U,Excellent film very Hitchcock vibe. Love the setting of san juan PR. The voice on the phone is just chilling..Like Norman Bates mother only way more damaged. The part with the chicken frying gave me nightmares.worth watching,1318118400,,224,5.081081081081081
4671707,4,B005F3XV8U,all different stories have all different ways they are shoot and how there paced fast or slow however they want you to get a feel for the ambuiance the characters the plot and surrounding. I thought for what it is and what it does takes you on a litlle slow paced relaxing journey with thrls and nail biting intensity. AWESOME,1316736000,,326,4.45
4671708,4,B005F3XV8U,"""People come together for a reason Mary, doesn't matter how."" After starting divorce proceedings against her husband Mary (Leferve) starts a new life in a new apartment. After a series of phone calls from a woman they begin to talk about their situations. When the woman acts on an off-handed remark by Mary she begins to rethink the friendship. When people she knows start to disappear she doesn't know how to make it stop. 90% of the way you feel about a movie, I think, has to do with your expectations going in. Movies like ""Bridesmaids"" with all the hype can really let you down after it's talked up as much as it was. This one is the total opposite. Never hearing of this the trailer seemed interesting so I watched it. I was blown away. A very neat (although not original) idea. Think a suspense version of the ""Lake House"". I don't want to give anymore away so I will end this, but this is a surprisingly good must see. I really liked this movie. Overall, a very tense and exciting suspense that deserves more of an audience that I'm sure it will get. Watch this! I give it an A-.

Would I watch again? - I think I might *Also try - Forget Me Not & Lake House",1316563200,2,1167,4.304545454545455
4671709,1,B005F3XV8U,I am so upset that I spent eight dollars to watch a horrid movie with my best friend and I value our movie night.  It was one the worst movies I have ever seen.  Being a valued customer I feel I should recieve compensation for the tortmeting expiernece.,1316044800,,253,4.25
4671710,1,B005F3XV8U,"Wow!...I had high hopes for this film, based on the synopsis and the reviews of others who have already seen it, but this film blows! It has an interesting premise and could've been very good or even awesome, but the story is just boring and very slow. I actually felt myself nodding off to sleep--and I suffer from insomnia! LOL! There are many other good flicks in this genre available here on Amazon Video On-Demand and I highly suggest you try one of them and don't bother 'answering the phone' on ""The Caller"". Zzzzzzzz.",1316044800,3,525,4.595744680851064

We never really learn how ""The Caller"" is connected to our present, but the logic is clean. I loved the ending.",1508544000,,289,4.087719298245614
