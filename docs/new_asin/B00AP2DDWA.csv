8555578,1,B00AP2DDWA,Wouldn't recommend this. Very mundane product as far as video lessons go. Used it for like 15 minutes and threw out because the instructor in the video was that annoying and monotone. Just use Youtube if looking for interesting chord tricks. Plenty of videos on there.,1380067200,4,268,4.8478260869565215
