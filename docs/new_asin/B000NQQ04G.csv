A tacks a poster about Doc Shaw who can cure the ills of people, like rheumatism. A truck speeds to get across the county line. The Sheriff tries to pull the truck back, but a shot breaks the rope. That cowboy is looking for work and is hired as a marksman. Three men to a bank, two try to open the safe. The lawmen shoot to stop them. Tex Ross chases one rider, Tex Weaver, who is an undercover agent. They talk about old times. The Bank Examiner talks to the Sheriff about this crime. In Clearwater Brayden operates the Lucky Spade saloon. Brayden talks about the failed robbery. One man got away.

Doc Shaw comes to town to provide a free show. Tim meets Tex and Goldie in the saloon. Runnyian talks to Goldie and asks her to find out about Missoura. Two men tie up the Sheriff and free his prisoners. Tim Ross follows one man to a cabin in the country. A Mexican offers money to buy rifles and ammunition. He has a guard with a rifle, Tim talks to him. Doc Shaw gives his speech. The freed prisoners says Tex Weaver must be a G-Man and suspect Missoura too. Goldie warns Tex. Doc Shaw speaks about the expertise of American shooters. Missoura shoots out six candles in three seconds! The trick shot is fired, Weaver falls. But Braydens men did it and try to blame Missoura!

Goldie finds the silver dollar with a hole in the center, Missoura didn't miss. Tim Ross sends the news from Bordertown California to the Southwest Division of the Department of Justice. Tim Ross tells the bank officers they know about the gun running plan. Who betrayed this plan? Tim mentions the names Taggart and Brayden. The former is the Territorial bank examiner. Goldie knows Runnyian killed Tex. Jos talks to Goldie about sharing a bottle of wine. Runnyian objects, there is a fight; Runnyian loses. Goldie tells Jos she knows a lot. Jos is taken to see Taggart. Taggart gives orders for the bank robbery after the money was deposited. But this is a trap, the gang is ambushed by the law! Those who weren't shot are captured. Will Tim and Goldie have a future?

This has an interesting plot where a crooked bank examiner gives information to a gang of bank robbers when a bank gets a large deposit. The Government uses undercover agents to infiltrate the gang so they can be caught in the act instead of chasing after them. Tim McCoy had an interesting career. Ralph Byrd is best known for playing Dick Tracy in movies and serials. Arizona was a territory before becoming a state in 1912. The sale of weapons to a Mexican echoes the turmoil in that era.",1508284800,,2570,4.485042735042735

The story line and plot, our hero 'Steely Eyed' Tim McCoy is in another poverty row quickie western --- Tim Ross (Tim McCoy) gets a job in a traveling medicine show with Doc Shaw (Earle Hodgins) who runs it and skirts the law at the opening reel --- Becoming involved in helping to try to bust a series of bank robberies in the region --- His past friend is a G-Man who has infiltrated the group is soon found out and dealt with --- Is our hero next on the list? --- The direction is extremely gripping and involving, with action vigorously staged with lots of extras and an unusually dark atmosphere deftly, realistically created --- McCoy, who had joined Puritan in 1935 after leaving Columbia Pictures, would make ten B-Westerns for the little company, all of them above average oaters considering their limited budgets of only 10,000 dollars a picture --- Watch for Ralph Byrd who would later play in the Dick Tracy Series --- Some great badmen appear Ted Adams, John Merton, Jack Evans, Art Dillard and Al Taylor -- and my all time favorite B-Western character actor Earle Hodgins make this an oater to watch and enjoy.
