8764947,4,B01HC418CA,"A real B movie and Baltimore legend, George Stover is an interesting guy.  Given his big break by  the legendary John Waters, George continues appearing in just about every movie made in Baltimore to this day.  Kudos to Director Jeff Herberger for putting this tribute together.",1523318400,,278,5.0
8764948,5,B01HC418CA,"No Stopping the Stover is an engaging and heartfelt documentary about one of Baltimore's most loved cult b-movie stars. With an almost 2 hour running time the documentary highlights the greatest moments of Stover's expansive career while also making time for many of the lesser known contributions to cinema and publishing. Director and editor Jeff Herberger does a masterful job at weaving Stover's life narrative together without ever letting the film drag. By telling Stover's story the film also manages to expand the narratives of John Waters and Don Dohler's careers, which were both close friends to Stover. The documentary also achieves at grabbing the viewer emotionally with a very intense and disturbing home invasion story where George was almost murdered. The moment in the film where a voice message that George left the director of a production he was supposed to act for that night but couldn't because of his injuries had me spellbound and speechless. You will walk away from the documentary absolutely in love with Stover and his amazing career. If you're into documentaries, b-movies, baltimore films or already a fan of Stover, Dohler or John Waters, you should absolutely get this movie.",1470096000,3,1208,5.168367346938775
