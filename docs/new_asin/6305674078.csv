1063655,4,6305674078,"Warren Miller has to be the most influential (downhill) ski film maker in history.  What they do, they do well and it shows in ""fifty."" But too much of the same good thing has become repetitive. There is more to skiing that just getting pulled downhill by gravity. Besides, there are a dozen people producing the same films. Great video, now it is time to broaden the scope.",974851200,,374,4.5
1063656,4,6305674078,"Well, I've seen the films from the last few years and this flick does a nice job in condensing the those and other stories over the last Fifty years. Music soundtrack was good and there were some fun parts. Good for  all round viewing. Planning to order a copy.",962236800,2,261,4.326530612244898
1063657,5,6305674078,Soundtrack for this video was phemomenal wish I could buy it.  If you don't want to hit the slopes after watching the movie you must be dead.  Pure Adrenaline Rush.  I can't wait for next year!,956102400,4,193,4.305555555555555
1063658,3,6305674078,"This vid is pretty tame, even compaired to Freeriders.  Bad music and boring skiing (for the most part) -> GET GLOBAL STORMING IF YOU WANT A REAL SKI MOVIE!",951436800,,156,4.379310344827586
1063659,5,6305674078,"This has got to be the best snowboarding/ski video i've ever seen, Warren Miller is THE best film producer. He takes it to the extreme in this movie, i couldn't stop watching it and rewinding it so i wouldnt miss anything.  Excellent Film.",949795200,3,239,4.558139534883721
1063660,5,6305674078,"You can not lose with a Warren Miller movie. He has come out with another masterpiece. I saw this year's movie in one of its showings in Seattle and it rocked. These movies seem like they get better every year. It has the  steeps, cool new tricks and a trip to  my local hill Crystal Mountain.  Everyone, the powder sucks there so just don't go and leave it all to me.  Anyway, Warren Miller scores again with another of his amazing movies!",945993600,4,440,4.329268292682927

7893506,2,6305674078,I enjoyed the skiing and jumping but the music is questionable and the random pictures of women half clothed do not make it appropriate for the classroom. Too bad. It has some fun scenes to watch if it was more tastefully done.,1391990400,,227,4.428571428571429
7893507,4,6305674078,"I bought this for my husband who used to ski with Warren Miller. Alas it didn't have any footage of him on this item. The good news is that now he can watch Miller's old movies in the middle of the night and catch the footage I was looking for. Millers old films are always entertaining, this was a great compilation of the old boys...",1356566400,,335,4.1692307692307695
7893508,3,6305674078,"I'd heard about Warren Miller's films and this is the first one I tried. It won't be the last, but overall the movie was pretty disappointing. It could be this isn't holding up well with the passage of time. The comedy is cornball stuff. The ski/board runs are a bit tame. The narration is largely on the dull side. Some of the music is good but otherwise I didn't find much particularly noteworthy.",1323216000,,399,4.47945205479452
7893509,5,6305674078,"I love this movie! Warren Miller at his best!!  My kids and family love it.
The movie has a great snapshot of the events of the last 50 years that have parralelled Warrens films. Included are bits and pieces of his 50 years of movie making and lots of new footage of the north western mountians, British Columbia and Alaska.
One of my new favorites!",1293062400,,349,4.369230769230769
7893510,5,6305674078,"As usual, from the ski movie master Warren Miller, a great skiing movie, with lots of incredible scenes and acrobatics. It just gets you ready fo the ski season and shows those who don't ski how awesome this sport can be. Great fun overall.",1012953600,6,240,4.4772727272727275
