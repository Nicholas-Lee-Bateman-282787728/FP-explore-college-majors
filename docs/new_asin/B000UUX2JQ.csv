2925252,5,B000UUX2JQ,"One of the things I love about this program is that it has five different 10 minute segments that all focus on different body parts (upper body, lower body, etc) - one of the segments is cardio/fat burning - so it's a really well-rounded workout. The segments are great because if you only have 20 minutes, just do 2 of the segments and choose the body parts you want to work most. Days when you have more time you can do 30 or 40 or all 50 minutes. It's flexible and I love that! Great total body sculpting program that works - and Cindy Whitmarsh is really great!",1193529600,21,565,4.2407407407407405

8214897,5,B000UUX2JQ,This dvd really gets your heart rate going its something you can really enjoy doing and will see results its convenient and moderately useful.,1373414400,,142,4.958333333333333
8214898,5,B000UUX2JQ,"I have other dvd's of Cindy and I liked them, so I figured I would try this one. I also like this one. I would recommend it to others.",1367452800,,134,3.6551724137931036
8214899,3,B000UUX2JQ,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

Production quality is still poor but not as bad as the Fat Blasting Bootcamp in this series (that one had volume trouble on top of everything else.)  For this one, cameras are still rather blurry/too close/jarring transition with oversaturated color.  Music is random and not used for timing the moves.

Still, I think the instructor did ok in this one and I liked the simplicity of the moves but it was a miss for my target heart rate zone and I did not get a good workout.  That said, I would recommend it for beginners who like this instructor (and would not mind somewhat poor video quality.)",1304035200,,652,4.586206896551724
8214900,1,B000UUX2JQ,"If you love Cindy as much as I do, get her videos produced by 10 Minute Solution instead. You'll find the production quality and sound to be much better, and you'll use it more often.",1266969600,3,183,4.257142857142857
8214901,1,B000UUX2JQ,"I do not recommend this workout.  The production quality is pretty poor, and the music level is so low you cannot hear it.  Those 2 things alone killed my interest before I even got to the workout.  The workout is very repetitive and basic - you may get results, but you'll be so bored that you'll likely not return to the workout.

Save your money.  If you need an intermediate workout, I'd recommend some of the 10 min solutions videos, especially the ones with Amy Bento as the lead.

8214902,1,B000UUX2JQ,"Agree with previous reviewer; as a fitness pro myself, I find her weight-lifting speed dangerous and ineffective (too fast and thus uses momentum to lift), and in the cardio portion, she's not even with the beat, which is very annoying. Big disappointment.",1209772800,2,256,5.119047619047619
8214903,1,B000UUX2JQ,"I don't understand the good reviews for this workout.  The DVD quality is awful, the DVD case is cheap(the DVD won't stay locked in the case and was loose when it arrived in the mail), the music is so faint and uninspiring it's like working out without music, the instructor cues bad and doesn't explain proper form and she flies through the workout so fast you can't use weights heavy enough to make a difference.  Don't waste your time or money.",1204675200,4,447,4.506172839506172
8214904,4,B000UUX2JQ,"I debated on wether to give this 4 or five stars. I settled at 4. The main reason is because when you opt for the total body sculpt at the main menu of the dvd it skips over the lower body portion. Antoher reason for the rating is because another set of repitions or more reps would of made the dvd more effective. Overall this is a goood dvd. The upper body portion is first. Hammer curls, triceps extensions,rows, and chest presess are the main exercises. The lower body portion is supposed to be second since it was skipped when I opted for the play all option I did it after all the others segments. This is the segment that is lacking in reps. Some exercises you only do 12 reps which is not enough. So I suggest you do this segment before hitting the play all and possible do it twice. This section consists of a side lunges, a variation of a dead lift, leg extensions, and leg raises. The next segment is the abs most of the work is done on the floor on your hands and knees. There are the killer side planks with a twist where you will really feel a burn. The cardio section is a brief 10 mintues it did not do much to get my heart rate up but you could do the moves faster. The section consits of step touch,leaps, kicks, repeaters, and jumping rope in place. The last segment is the stretch and sulpt section. As far as stretching goes it does not do much for me I opted to stretch some more after the dvd. There were some pilates moves in this section too. Overall the stretch and sculpt section is a bit of a letdown I did not really feel any stretch or a burn from the sculpting exercises. I like Cindy Whitmarsh she is a good instructor and her dvd's are pretty good. The exercises in this dvd are effective and can be preformed by any fitness level. If your looking for more intesity I suggest you repeat the desired segment and increase your weight. This is good for maintaining weight and toning up.",1201651200,10,1916,4.237704918032787
8214905,5,B000UUX2JQ,The workout segments are great for people like myself that have 2 young kids to take care of.  It gets you excited and you can feel your muscles tension.,1195171200,6,153,4.275862068965517
