172410,5,0964083817,"Steve Prefontaine was the most charismatic distance runner this country has yet produced[and probably its best]He brought mythic proportions to the track,enlivining a sport that was limited to agate type in major newspapers and the track and field news. This documentary is by far the best presentation of his short,brilliant life. He ran,as someone once said, like an oregon timber fire,and this documentary shows it. Fromhis early success at oregon under bill bowerman,to the 72 trials held in eugene, to the illfated race against finnish policeman Lasse Viren in Munich,1972,held a couple of days afetr the massacre there,this documenray covers it all very,very well. The narration by ken kesey is surprising;y good, the interviews weaved throught are seamless and cogent/Wonderful footage,lovely words of a man who inspired many, who NIKE shoes were founded upon,literally{the first shoes ever made were done from lasts of his},who ran through the running landscape, and died too damn soon.",974937600,24,994,5.461038961038961

172413,5,0964083817,"I have seen two other movies about running legend Steve Prefontaine - ""Without Limits"" and ""Prefontaine"".  This movie ranks right up there with those two, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The difference with this movie is that, instead of actors, it films the actual people and fellow runners who were close to him - including Raymond and Elfriede Prefontaine (his parents), his sister, Frank Shorter, Bill Bowerman.  The wonderful separate ""bonus"" DVD includes wonderful and insightful interviews with Frank Shorter, Dana Carvey (a top cross-country and track runner himself during his high school years), Kenny Moore, Phil Knight, and Mac Wilkins.",1380672000,,645,5.43

There aren't a lot of track documentaries out there so there isn't much to compare it to; this is one of the best. If you have seen the two theatrical movies about Prefontaine first, you will be amazed how well they captured the look and mannerisms of the real people.

I have watched Without Limits many times, but this movie really dwells more into who he is on the track.  This movie does lack personal information on Pre off the track, but that's just who he was.

It's inspiring as well as it contains interviews from many of the former Olympians who competed with Pre.

Note: It's only 1 hour long.",1271980800,,284,4.4423076923076925
172430,4,0964083817,"This work is about one hour long.  The product now on sale also includes a second DVD of extras.  Some reviews indicate that an earlier product included only the main feature and I would agree that was somewhat skimpy at the price.  On the other hand this is a limited audience product (and limited budget) whose costs cannot be spread out over millions of copies as with major cinematic features.  I don't know about the production issues around this but it seems to me that Nike could have easily financed the acquisition of any needed footage and it would be very appropriate that they do so.  It is a very good production for what might be a ""labor of love"".

Strengths.
1. Extensive set of substantial interviews with people who knew Prefontaine both in the feature and on the extra disc.
  I especially liked getting Bowerman and Dellinger after being exposed to two movie portrayals and
  Ian Stewart's reflections on the Munich 5000 before, during and after.

2. A well assembled biography including his fight with the AAU and role in the success of Nike.

3. The bio information that accompanies the interview segments on the extras DVD.

4. A fairly realistic assessment of Prefontaine's actual accomplishments and ability with a minimum of fan hype.
  In particular I appreciate the realistic review of the Munich race.  As good as he was it was unlikely that he could win it
  even if it came down to a ""guts race"" (and for him it did) and even if the pace had been brisk from the start.
  (A faster race would have probably preserved a medal for him with more distance back to the pack but one must seriously
  question if Pre was capable of lowering his U.S. trials 13:22PR sufficiently to match what Viren had done (13:19.0 in July 1972) or what he could do in that faster race considering that only four days after the Munich final Viren lowered the WR to 13:16.3.  It would appear that Viren had advantage to spare in any tactical scenario.)

  Stewart makes this point well, everything Pre could threaten (like a sub 4:00 final 1600),
  was within the reach of 3 or 4 others who would likely be in the race and with better finishing speed to boot.

  Viren in particular had no reason to fear Pre as all his best times were substantially
  superior to Prefontaine's including the world record 10K final he had run at Munich event
  showing he was in top form at Munich and a 13:19.0 5K run July 1972 at Helsinki.

  Viren had far more reason to be concerned with others in the field such as:

  - Gammoudi, who had risen to the occasion in 1964 and 1968 to acquire a complete set of medals.

  - 3000m WR holder Puttemans (record set in 1972) who would later in 1972 lower Viren's new WR by three seconds.

  - Ian Stewart whose PR at the time was equivalent to Prefontaine's and thus could hang onto a pace
  but also had the potential to finish the last lap under 55 seconds off a fast pace.

  At Munich it is fair to say that Viren had Pre coming and going in the absence of a prodigious career breakthrough at age 21.  In an article by Kenny Moore I found online it is clear that this was not a secret to Pre or his coaches and teammates before the race after they saw Viren set the 10K record on his way to a gold medal after falling down in mid-race.  Their only hope was that it might have tired him a bit.  What hope that gave was dashed by the delay caused by the Palestinian terror episode in which all the Israeli hostages were killed, that also provided Viren with ample rest.  All I get from the post-mortem analyses of the race by various Oregon experts (Bowerman, Moore, Dellinger etc) in print is that had he run the last two laps differently, he might have held on to a medal but do not convince me that he had a real shot at the gold.

  Prefontaine ruled U.S. running and records in his events with an iron fist.  But at no time was he demonstrably superior to the
  whole world in peak form.  He held all the American records, a bit soft by world standards, but never held or seriously threatened a world record.

  He never dominated top non-Americans on the international circuit.
  The final race with Norpoth comes to mind. But perhaps Norpoth did have to bleed since to win Norpoth set his own PR 13:20.6, about two seconds ahead of Pre's best time to date. and retired shortly thereafter.  Pre never promised to win every race, only that anyone who beat him would have to bleed to do it.

  All that might have been just around the corner as the documentary suggests but it
  never happened in the tangible reality of major international races won or a world record set or even a near miss. (Still, consider that while hardly a near miss on the clock, his 27:43 10K AR under the conditions it was run (cold, windy, and solo) was at least equivalent to the Viren/Clarke 27:39 level or even the Bedford 27:30.8WR of the time. The conditions, as described in Kenny Moore's book, Bowerman and the Men of Oregon, might well account for the roughly .5 sec per lap difference with the Bedford WR.  In the 10K at least he can be said to have been finally knocking loudly on the WR door.)

6. It delivers a balanced portrayal and appreciation of a great athletic presence, rarely equaled competitive spirit,
  and (is there a argument here?) the greatest U.S. born distance runner of all time.

Weakness.

Too short and bit superficial on the sport itself.  Very little in the way of extended coverage of full events.  The event coverage is extremely weak and running footage is mostly used to highlight the discussion or interview background.  This is good for a general audience documentary but more should be done with the extras disc.

Considering the Prefontaine video I have found on You-Tube I think the (or another) extra DVD should have assembled many more complete races (or at least final several laps) with top competitors and with better video quality than You-Tube.
In particular:
 The 1972 Olympic trials race against George Young with splits shown to compare with the presentation in Without Limits.
 The 1972 Olympic final (there was enough in this DVD to see the critical fight before the finish however)
 Some of his mile races in particular, the 3:54.6 race with Wottle, the indoor events on You-Tube.
 Some of his wins in major U.S. events such as the NCCA or AAU, American record setting events etc.
 Some of his three mile wins, especially under 13:00 which was not common at the time.
  (I would like to see the real race portrayed in Without Limits, I think I found the time
  but that race was against WSU not Stanford as portrayed in order to have Kardong in the race.
  If someone can clear up this point I would appreciate it. I doubt there is footage for a regular season college meet.
  I recall seeing Pre out-run Don Kardong in a Pac 8 final on TV at the time of the event.)
 The HS two mile record.
 American records at various distances or any really well contested races.
 The 1973 race with Norpoth.
 Actually, the more the better as far as I am concerned.

Given a choice, the record preserved by the interviews is more important, so the producers have done well.
Still I hope someone is working on preserving the archive footage of races.

====================================================================================

Quibble:
The extra disc entry on Pre's personal records makes a point of stating that Pre's collegiate records for the 3 mile (12:53.4) and 6 mile (27:09.4) still stand.  Anyone who knows anything knows that this is only because these distances are no longer contested and apparently no one is taking split times in the current 5K and 10K events.  It does not take much arithmetic to realize that Rono's 5K 13:08.4 (a WR at the time incidentally at a mere dual meet) (or even Bill McChesney's ""U.S. born"" collegiate record of 13:15.8) are substantially superior to the 3 mile mark and that Kamau's 27:36.2 10K (and Ed Eyestone's ""U.S. born"" 27:41.5) are also comfortably ahead of the 6 mile mark.  It is a disservice to a viewer who does not follow the sport to leave the impression that any of Pre's major records are really still standing (leaving out school records, meet records, stadium records etc.  It will be quite a day in Coos Bay when anyone breaks the Marshfield HS records).

Questions:
Did Bowerman really run off 12:36 during the memorial service to represent a 63 second lap three mile as shown in Without Limits?  (Yes. It is described in Bowerman and the Men of Oregon by Kenny Moore.  12:36.4 to be exact.)

There were so many lines from this that were still in my head after all this years, like when the sportscaster says Pre was running against ""the very big boys"" and would have to wait until 1976 to win his medal. Or when the bronze medalist from the '72 Olympic 5000 meter race, the UK's Ian Stewart who passed Pre in the closing yards of the race, talked about Pre not being aware of how many the European runners could match Pre's pre-race plan of running the last mile in 4:00. The black and white footage of Pre powering down and then up a hill during one of his college cross country races was great, it was stuck in my mind during my runs for the next week.

I even cut out a picture of him in a magazine and put it over my bed as an inspiration before every track meet I competed in. This documentary must be real good!! It's a must for any track enthusiast, runner, or any Pre fans. He was an inspiration. If he had lived he probably would have been one of the greatest track coaches of all time like Bill Bowerman was. He's in my top 10 of one of the greatest track stars of all time! What A Runner!!! Thanks.",1073260800,4,568,4.172727272727273
172457,5,0964083817,"I remember watching Prefontaine doing his practice runs around the fields at North Bay Junior High School in Hauser, Oregon when I was a student there. I was aware of his achievements and was in awe of him. It was such a thrill to be able to watch him practice. His is a truly inspirational story. I went on to run long distance myself at his rival school in North Bend, OR. I would have given anything to have half his natural talent. I also watched him in the 1972 Olympics on television and still remember the emotions involved. I will always admire Prefontaine and wonder about the greatness that would have been. Someday Hollywood will do his story right.",1056412800,7,660,4.508333333333334

Those who saw him run, met him, or have recently been introduced to the ""Legend of Oregon"" would get tremendous value from this 58 minute video.  Excellent footage of Pre's races, interviews, and comments about his views on the need for change towards athlete's in the 70's.  I watch this for motivation and inspiration.

The highlight, in my opinion, is the footage of the 1972 Olympic 5000M Final. I have watched this portion of the video literally hundreds of times. Narration throughout the video is exceptional. Appearances by Ian Stewart and Kenny Moore are wonderful. Mac Wilkins' memories of Pre are particularly moving.  A must see.",994982400,9,448,4.818181818181818
7793729,5,0964083817,I've owned this dvd for many years but can't find my copy. I've loaned it out many times and I suspect it didn't make it home the last time. I wanted to buy another one but I see the price has shot up now that they are no longer available at retail. Someone has to get a message to Nike (or Phil Knight himself) to get moving on a second release of this great documentary. Steve deserves nothing less. Aaron Jones,1466467200,3,413,4.111111111111111
