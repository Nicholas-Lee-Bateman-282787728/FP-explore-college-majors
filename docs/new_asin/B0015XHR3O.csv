8260189,4,B0015XHR3O,"These are four films that are certainly a very mixed bag from the perspective of the age ranges they are aimed at, but that seems to be mostly a good thing in a blend like this.

The HG Wells Universe is much more adult oriented, it's got reasonable screenplay, decent acting and a couple of above average storylines in it. For me it was pleasant escapism, it still works for the family as there's no specific blood or language issues.

Voyage of the Unicorn, based upon the novel Voyage of the Beagle was cute. It was certainly more than acceptable for stimulating younger imaginations ""what's medusa?, What's a troll? Do they really live on an island etc"". Many questions I'm not equipped to answer. Screenplay and acting with storyline was certainly what you'd expect for a film aimed at the younger set.

Merlin's Apprentice was a halfway house between Voyage and Wells, its good entertainment, the storyline and acting are better than Voyage and it went down very well with the younger set.

Canterville Ghost was probably the best of the group, Patrick Stewart does a nice job, and although its certainly not the best version of the classic, for a made for TV affair its exceptionally good.

Overall these were an excellent buy at Amazon's price point. If you've got little ones to pre-teen it's unlikely you'll be disappointed. If you just enjoy a bit of escapism as I often do, it's still worth the investment.",1329868800,6,1418,4.724696356275303
