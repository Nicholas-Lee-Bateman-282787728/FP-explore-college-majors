this couldn't have come out at a worse time.
Several major religions have programs of food
storage for emergencies.
Making fun of human fears isn't a real good thing;
having lived through the bomb shelter era of the 50's
I have to say that atomic war isn't something that is easy for
people to be comfortable with.
There are cities all over America with 1950's
bomb shelters.
I'm sure this fellow thought this was comedy, but it is just
poor taste? The Bush administration
like the Eisenhower one before has feed on our fears,
but they are real fears that we have to deal with.",1225497600,2,613,4.482142857142857

8308404,5,B001HB1K0U,"This was a very good movie that had some very true points. People should take notice of having a emergency back up plain, so much is taken for granted. And  the fact how much he love his wife was really awsome. She really pissed me off not trusting in him until it was to late.",1371081600,2,277,4.036363636363636
8308405,5,B001HB1K0U,I am a huge Hill Harper fan but was still very hesitant to purchase such a low budget film with this title and the price that Amazon had listed.  I brought myself to buy it (because of Harper ) and  was pleasantly surprised at how the film handled this topic.  The film was easy to watch and very funny. I rarely find a film that I feel to watch again and again but I saw this already 3 times and enjoyed it each time because of how it really captures the fear some people had. This movie is interesting but still very funny and entertaining. I saved money by not going out to the movie theater the weeks I watched it so it was worth it.,1237420800,4,637,4.0396825396825395
8308406,5,B001HB1K0U,"A wonderful and very funny film by the brilliant Chris Angel.  Tom Arnold is hilarious.  Hill Harper and Robinne Lee simply shine.  A must-see for Tom Arnold, Hill Harper and Robinne Lee fans.  Also a must-see for anyone who is looking for a smart, funny film.  Absolutely delightful.",1233619200,4,284,4.833333333333333
8308407,4,B001HB1K0U,"We need more movies like this.  Please support this film.  This is true independent cinema, not the stuff at Sundance, which has become a de facto studio flea market.  The writer-director of This Is Not a Test financed this movie partly out of his own pocket, hustled to get the cast and crew, and did the legwork on his own to find distribution.  He earned it all, and rightly so - this story merits being seen.
  Remember in the days shortly after 9/11 when they were saying irony was dead?  That obviously didn't happened.  There seems to be more cynicism than ever.  The sincerity and thoughtfulness of This Is Not a Test is a real breath of fresh air.  Writer-director Chris Angel tackles the pervasiveness of fear in our everyday lives with wit and humor, but though the main character's fear is the very end of the world, Angel rarely resorts to easy and obvious black humor.  In fact, he has a refreshingly light touch and focuses more on the characters.  He gets terrific performances out of lead actor Hill Harper, who gets to show a side of himself fans of CSI: New York will want to see more of; and he also draws out a performance from Tom Arnold that will remind people that the guy nearly stole True Lies right out from under Arnold Schwarzenegger and all those explosions!
  This is the kind of movie where at the end you will find yourself wondering why Hollywood doesn't make more like them.  Well, if you support filmmakers like Mr. Angel, maybe they will.

(In the interest of full disclosure: yes, I do know Chris Angel; no, I did not work on the movie; and yes, I stand by my review - this is a quality piece of work that compares favorably to 99% of the stuff that is released into movie theaters every weekend.)",1233446400,4,1735,4.4603174603174605
8308408,5,B001HB1K0U,"I'm guessing that the reviewer who thinks the film is ""making fun of human fears"" hasn't seen the movie. He might want to watch it, or see it again. It would probably help him cope with the very real fears he mentions. After all, it depicts Hill Harper's character coping with those fears, trying to protect his family and friends in a world where any protection is uncertain.  If, like his character, you've ever wondered whether to build a bomb shelter, flee the country, or avoid bringing children into this world, watch  this movie.

PS--At the moment  Amazon has this film linked with THE STONED AGE in one of its ""bargain packages"" which, as usual, won't save you a cent over buying DVDs separately. I haven't seen the other movie, but it's description suggests a film that is very different in tone from THIS IS NOT A TEST.",1232496000,3,830,4.587837837837838
8308409,5,B001HB1K0U,"""This is Not A Test"" is a cute story about how crazy modern society can drive anyone a little bit crazy.  Tom Arnold (as himself) plays a wonderful role as a citizen of LA who isn't quite sure how to cope with the fear of the unknown.  And Hill Harper (CSI:NY) is so desperate to protect the family that he loves that he joins Arnold in his strange quest.

Deep down, it's a redeeming story about love in the nuclear age.  It's a reminder that, no matter what happens, love will survive.  You won't be disappointed.",1229212800,5,515,4.322916666666667
