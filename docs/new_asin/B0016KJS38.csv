8262942,1,B0016KJS38,"I bought this because I was expecting Jeff and the gang. It isnt. It is Bill Engvall with some people I have never heard of. I chuckled maybe a total of five times through the entire show. The rest was not funny, upsetting or just plain offensive. I am ashamed to own this and am removing it immediatly from my Amazon Cloud. Wht this was produced is beyond me.",1375574400,,360,4.231884057971015

8262944,5,B0016KJS38,"These guys are not Larry, Bill, Jeff or Ron but they are funny new guys on the stage.  Looking foward to more.",1277942400,2,110,4.0
8262945,1,B0016KJS38,"It's not blue collar comedy.  There were four gentlemen.  It just lacks something.  Hard to put my finger on it.  When I purchased it, I thought it was the four original men from blue collar comedy.  If this is the next generation, the line should be stopped",1252540800,3,258,4.404255319148936
8262946,2,B0016KJS38,"i bought the DVD because i though they wouldn't just give the blue collar name to anyone... turns out they did.
Caparulo was okay but the other 3 guys were not as good as i would have hoped. I think maybe i have been spoiled by the likes of bill, ron, jeff and larry.",1251072000,5,267,3.962962962962963
8262947,5,B0016KJS38,It is well worth it just for Cap. He is funny as H#$%.  The others are good too but I find myself watching Cap over and over.,1217203200,,125,3.6296296296296298
8262948,1,B0016KJS38,"Bill Engvall hosts this show and says he might be out of a job now that these guys are around. Your job is very, very safe Bill. Aside from Reno Collier, the last comic on this DVD there is not a lot of good comedy here. In a few years, most of these guys will still be the middle act in a club somewhere.",1213315200,4,305,3.78125
