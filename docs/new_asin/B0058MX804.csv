The acting is superb and the story is vastly interesting. Although is is ultimately a love story, it isn't what I would call a 'chick flick'. My fire chief loved the film, too.

If you like indie films, you'll be glad you saw this!",1314662400,22,313,4.2
4599955,5,B0058MX804,"Just saw this movie at The Little Theater in Rochester NY. Fascinating story, with lives interwoven and a bittersweet but happy ending. Very uplifting, that people with their secrets and history can love, forgive, and survive.",1310860800,26,226,5.305555555555555
4599956,5,B0058MX804,"I just saw this movie at the Paris theater in NYC tonight and I was enthralled I actually went to catch the St Laurent film L'amour Fou and it was gone and this movie was in its place.

Knowing nothing about the movie but loving Dutch films I bought the ticket.  What a treat.  it is a beautifully shot film of four main characters, three women who go to get married and one man who affects their lives in one way or another, you will have to see it I""m not giving the plot away.

The performances are delicate, gutsy and sexy.  The leading male character is a hunk (just the way I like em).
the story is heart rendering with being sappy.  It has none of the fake Hollywood bag of tricks and all of the character that Euro movies do so well.

Go see it and ask for it in your home town.  And please release this on DVD asap. This one is going to my library.",1307923200,4,857,4.029585798816568
4599957,5,B0058MX804,"I saw this movie through a cinema club in Westchester ,NY. It has been released in the Netherlands but the DVD has been produced in only a non USA format and thus has never had any visibility in the USA.  WHAT A SHAME!
This movie is a real treat-exciting,compelling,riveting, poignant and thought provoking. It recounts the emigration to New Zealend of four people in the 1950's from The Netherlands which had just experienced severe floods and resulting  horrible economic conditions. These 4 young adults essentially meet on the plane ride and their stories become intertwined in ways that keep you totally engrossed in their separate new lives in New Zealand. The plot is continually engaging and the lead actor and especially the lead actresses are wonderful and fully  photogenic.  If this movie were ever released here in a USA format, I suspect word of mouth and that of reviewers would eventually  make this unknown movie a rental favorite here.",1301011200,12,953,4.968553459119497
4599958,5,B0058MX804,"Saw this movie tonight at The Contra Costa Jewish Film Festival. The audience of about 850 people sat there spellbound after the ending. See no point in making a long review, as you will never see it here in the USA. For anyone else in Europe, it should be essential viewing. Just great!",1299369600,3,287,4.433962264150943

4599980,2,B0058MX804,"Although the scenery is very well pictured, the story line is very complicated to follow, maybe because the events are taken to a very long extent to explain, therefor loosing the viewers attention. With the first 20 minutes of the movie, you can basically guess how the whole movie will develop. If you are on a very cold, rainy and boring Sunday I encourage you to watch it if not abstain.",1406937600,,391,4.52112676056338

ways. I was totally engrossed while learning about a post World War II slice of life in

The women to start new lives as brides, and the man, whose life is gradually revealed to begin again. They are appealing characters and their stories are well told against New Zealand's beautiful landscape.  Occasionally the story hovers on the edge of melodrama, but the quality of the acting of the troupe kept me deeply engaged.",1394582400,,458,4.506024096385542

4599985,5,B0058MX804,Recommend this movie to all the romantics.  It is a story of people and how they react to what life deals to them.  It reflects that love lasts a lifetime with some people.  Those people NEVER lose the loves of their life.,1393459200,,222,4.238095238095238
4599986,5,B0058MX804,"The acting in this is excellent, it made me feel like I was there.  The story is wonderful too-and usually I dislike films that jump between the present and the past, but this was done so well, that it was truly woven, and not just an excuse for the jumping.

Do not miss this wonderful film, subtitles or not, there is English in the movie, but depending on the situation they will slip into dutch.  Beautiful film, a pleasant surprise on Prime and I am so glad I saw it.

4599992,4,B0058MX804,"I read the book a few years ago in Dutch and enjoyed it tremendously.  I was pleasantly surprised to come across the movie and could not wait to see it.  Having read the book first, it filled in the gaps that the movie did not show such as the dynamics and abuse between Ada and her husband.  The movie was enjoyable and reflected the different backgrounds of the immigrants as described in the book.",1390521600,,400,4.378378378378378

Beautifully told, the emotional bonds between mothers and children, lovers and friends, involve deep secrets and shadowy pasts.
Time reveals  the kindness and strength of basic human values and teaches each of them, that life is not always what it seems.

4599995,3,B0058MX804,Good story- good acting but a little sappy. I thought lead actor was adorable and female actresses all very competent. Story revolves around main guy who three women have had contact with in some way or another,1389225600,,210,4.702702702702703

4599997,4,B0058MX804,This movie was a very sweet love story. I tended to lose track on a few things because I didn't get the backstory of the movie beforehand. Otherwise it was a great movie,1387756800,,169,4.151515151515151

4600000,4,B0058MX804,"Liked this movie. From post war. Even though it is sub-titled, it is well done, and a good story. Very likely
true story by some mean. Here again, we see how the woman was suppressed during those times. Only the very strong
ones were able to do what they wanted with their lives. That was the only bad thing to watch in this movie. Overall a good
movie. And well made.",1381795200,,368,4.197183098591549

4600002,5,B0058MX804,I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.  The description sounded like the film had possibilities as light entertainment of a non- Hollywood variety.  But this girl really swept in my wife and me.  We enjoyed it.,1381190400,,209,4.75
4600003,5,B0058MX804,"I'm not a big fan of ""cheesy,"" formula romance stories in either book or movie form. This is a love story that, like life, is messy, complicated, and bittersweet. There is some nudity and sex, but it isn't gratuitous. Much of the dialogue is foreign with English subtitles, but that honestly wasn't a distraction. The setting is lovely, the acting top notch. I found myself sadly wishing for a happy ending. I highly recommend to adults with a taste for post WWII historical fiction.",1380931200,,483,4.761904761904762
4600004,5,B0058MX804,"Bride Flight is a wonderful movie.  I don't usually enjoy love stories, but this one was great.  The cast was well-chosen and the acting was excellent.  Each character had their own unique story which kept the movie moving and held my interest.  I have always enjoyed Rutger Hauer and believe his part could have been longer.  The screen play was well written.  I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys a good love story and for those who simply like a well written, high quality script with good characters.",1380412800,,512,4.696629213483146

4600006,5,B0058MX804,"This film was very beautiful & so true to life in its plot. In real life, we don't have all things perfectly happy. A well-matched couple terrified of the skeleton in their closet, two lovers doomed to never be together and one woman nursing unrequited love & the pain of a decision that costs her too much. Ada's story makes me so determined to wait until I find my match. It's so horrible to be tied to the wrong someone for the rest of your days. This film has graphic nude & sex scenes, so it is definitely for adults only. The backdrop of New Zealand in the film left me feeling quite poignant. Please watch this film (Ladies, have your tissues at hand for this one! lol).",1378339200,,677,4.296875
4600007,4,B0058MX804,"Liked the movie. Interesting post WWII story, involving the result of three women and a young man sharing a flight to Australia to start new lives after the war.

4600011,5,B0058MX804,"This movie weaves an intertwining, post war story about three different women, all leaving their home country to marry men they do not know. During their flight, dubbed  the ""Bride Flight,"" they form a friendship with each other and with a handsome man-also striking out on his own adventure.  The scenes on the plane provide the viewer with lots of groundwork about each character and shows us glimpses of their reasons for leaving behind the life they had. When they arrive in New Zealand the story continues and takes on qualities that all endearing love stories deliver.

Character and story development are done using flashbacks and strong acting.  Sometimes with so many prime characters flashbacks can be confusing, however in this film they fit seamlessly and build a rich story. I found it to be one of the best subtitled movies that I have watched. The acting is very strong, the casting was spot on and really transcended the subtitles. The chemistry between the characters contributes to a lovely movie.",1374364800,2,1015,4.952941176470588

4600014,5,B0058MX804,"Well assembled cast with good chemistry and an intriguing, thoroughly captivating story.  The acting was wonderful though the cast is not exactly well-known, here in the USA anyway.  Karina Smulders and Waldemar Torenstra were superb and convincing in their thoughtful portrayals.  The story shines a light on a little known event, or series of events, following World War II, as New Zealand opened its gates to european immigrants in order to re-vitalize their post-war economy.  One of the means of accomplishing this was through marriage-by-proxie arrangements, often with prospective husbands in New Zealand never having met the women they had contracted to marry.  The women came, though, seeking the opportunity to build a new life, in a thriving, new land.  This story mainly focuses on three young women: Ada, Marjorie and Esther, with Esther's resourceful but drastic solution to her dilemma destined to impact profoundly the lives of the others, even including the next generation.

The film through flashbacks tells how their lives intertwined and how they adapted to life in a totally new environment.  The movie quickly draws you in to care about the characters and the problems they face in their new life.  It does an interesting and entertaining job in following the twists and turns in adjusting to a new existence.  Eventually, all come to grips with the arch of their lives, but in the process you come to care about them, their problems, joys, and disappointments.",1368835200,,641,4.587719298245614

4600041,4,B0058MX804,"This  is the story  of four individuals who meet on a plane and their lives become entwined.  They are all escaping Holland in the post war years of 1953.  Three of the women are meeting up with soon to be husbands who have come ahead and are looking for opportunities in the new world of New Zealand.  Frank, the lone man in the group becomes acquainted with the women in ways that become apparent as the story unfolds.  Ada, the young farm girl's husband is a very strict Mennonite guy who is not only cold to her but makes her ride in the back of a pickup for five hours while the minister sits in the front seat.  The home he provides for her is well, that's one of the surprises! Marjorie has a happy reunion with her mate and having great hopes for happiness and a large family is soon faced with tragedy.  Esther, a beautiful fashion designer has escaped the holocaust which claimed the rest of her family.  Her espoused is a strict Orthodox Jew who wants her to be the same way, and given Esther's recent loss she does not embrace this idea at all.  Frank, the lone male in this group becomes involved with both Ada and Esther because he sees that they are unhappy with their decisions.  As the movie progresses we see just how intense Frank is and how this all plays out in everybody's lives. I really liked the cinemetography in this movie as it really showed the starkness as well as the beauty of the different parts of New Zealand.  The film is in Dutch with English subtitles, but further along in the movie there will be English speaking as well, and mostly on the part of Esther as she becomes more involved in the fashion world. The man who plays Frank is an absolutely gorgeous looking man, and the older version of Frank is played by the ever talented Rutger Hauer.

I also was so delighted by this movie that i ordered the book to read. Due be prepared that if you get this movie-you must pay attention because it is a foreign film so some parts are subtitled! This is a story of a secret pact and the choices 3 women made in 1953. Also note: nudity and one pretty detailed sex scene is in it! Though these scenes did not bother me it shows how this character went from a husband that was overly religious and just wanted his 10 minutes in bed with her to her doing things she never did before. Scenery in the movie is beautiful. My favorite character was Ester! Strong but vulernable!

I also remember the 1953 air race (The Bride Flight being the KLM DC 6 entry) that finished in my city, Christchurch. I rode my bicycle to the airport to see the visiting aircraft. I enjoyed the movie and its attempt to record the introduction of Dutch culture (sometimes uncompromising) into New Zealand's relaxed lifestyle. The Dutch got off side occasionally owing to them being diligent workers. The story also represents the early days of New Zealand's successful viticulture industry. Pinot noir certainly became a pleasing drop. The movie follows the book's storyline closely and the characters,Lady Esther, Ada and Marjorie, come over convincingly. But I question changing the locations: Oamaru instead of Christchurch and spectacular Queenstown instead of Martinborough for Frank's flamboyant winery. In a sense it is a sad story with only one of the marriages resulting from the Bride Flight being a success albeit marginally. Following the story in the movie can be complicated for anyone not having read the book. I recommend both. Bride flight on DVD is a good choice for any movie connoisseur's collection.

This movie is a drama that follows a group of 4, who travel from Holland to beautiful New Zealand to start new lives following WWII and a big flood in Holland.  They meet on the long flight and begin friendships with each other that will last many decades.

MARJORIE:  is meeting her fiance who had gone ahead of her to get things set up to start their life together there, planning to marry and raise a big family

ESTHER:  is meeting a man she barely met but they both lost all their families in the war and had that in common to start a marriage on. Fortunately before they're wed she discovers his vision of their marriage was way different than hers so she calls it off and follows her professional talent of clothes designing and living on her own terms.

ADA:  is a sweet girl who was married by proxy to a man she had barely known and was flying out to meet him (after he got things set up for them). When she originally met him he was grieving/crying and she offered him comfort, which ended up with sex and she ended up knocked up - hence the hasty marriage by proxy.

FRANK (played by Waldemar Torenstra, and Rutger Hauer as the older version):  is single, handsome, charismatic and not at all shy with the ladies.  Frank is heading to New Zealand to start a vineyard.

The movie opens with the older Frank in present day at his vineyard.  He dies and the 3 women each receive a notice in the mail and travel to attend his funeral. The movie hops back and forth from present day to their past, telling their intertwining stories and ending with Frank's funeral.

4600067,5,B0058MX804,"Explores the deepest core of love and the heart of friendship; of the passage of fifty years and the lives we lead in those decades. And interestingly, delves into one country's cultural heritage and addresses another's guilt.

'Bride' tells the story of three young Dutch women who share one moment in history, a journey from post-war Holland to the cold beauty of 1950's New Zealand as war brides. Until this film, I associated this term with soldiers who fell in love with women from other countries and brought them home. But I see now it can also be defined as women who want to leave their own war shattering experiences behind - starting life anew someplace else.

In the film we follow the lives of Ada, Marjorie and Esther. How vastly dissimilar their journeys were despite beginning from a common starting point: Each one signing a marriage contract after meeting prospective grooms from the faraway island nation. But choices made in the spirit and heat of the moment come back to haunt them. One as her body unexpectedly fails her - the other two as they learn their chosen mates unintentionally obscured an important personality trait that they discover only after leaving everything behind.

Thankfully, the filmmakers and cast avoid pathetically obvious plot devices. None of the men are physically abusive or demented sexual freaks; neither are they criminals on the run or obnoxious gas bags. No, these are essentially good men, in their own way. But men who have complex character issues. And it's these issues that makes this so much more than a run-of-the-mill Oxygen or Lifetime flick.

Fairly or unfairly, the story of Ada is the primary tale. Especially given that her choice was not really her choice at all. In the 1950's a woman could not be pregnant and unmarried. To say the two concepts were incompatible in this period of history would be an understatement. So a moment of pity and kindness turns into a lifetime of dreariness with a man who I would describe as a 'monster' of sorts. No, he doesn't beat her. But he's incredibly detached, emotionally and sexually. A fundamental religious person, who is also fanatically frugal, only adds to the general disregard that I feel toward this fellow dude. He's the worst kind of automaton - a zealot. Can you imagine fifty years stuck with someone like that? Note: I'm not opposed to a life of austerity and religious piety. But Ada was not allowed to make a fully disclosed choice; her contract was, in many ways, a lie. And I detest lying on principal, but especially as a form of indentured servitude. So I truly feel and sympathize with Ada's plight.

Esther's story is probably the most intriguing of the three. An aspect of The Netherlands that many would prefer forgotten was the acquiescence of the Dutch people to social fascism. The willingness to identify, categorize, hunt down and deliver their Jewish population to the German 'Die Endlsung' - The Final Solution. Esther's entire family is murdered in the Holocaust. Sadly, why and how she survived is not explained by the filmmakers, although she alludes to an eerily similar fate shared by Anne Frank.

Determined and focused, Esther moves herself 10,000 miles and three continents away in order to forget. She will not play the role of victim, nor savior to her genetic past. For her, life is a fresh start, and one she will take on her terms alone. So when she gets pregnant, her choice is both pragmatic and so terribly soul-crushing. I truly wish there were more of her, a backstory and fuller presentation of her life. But three leads was the choice of writer Marieke van der Pol, so three it is.

And finally the story of Marjorie. Hers is the best match, the most promising. Her husband is a decent guy, talented and on his way up. Their pairing is very good and the love they feel for one another genuine. Their combined dream: Raise a big family. It's obvious that this film is about twisted fate and lost dreams, so you know what happens next.

These friends, their intersecting lives, and their often heart-breaking choices make for an intimate look into the very heart of one's true love, life friendships, and ultimately, forgiveness and acceptance.

'Bride' is a quiet retrospective film that, like the wonderful US production '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avalon/dp/B000056HP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avalon</a>', completely develops and delivers in two all-too-brief hours one nation's sense of self, while also spotlighting another nation's sense of dishonor and regret.

Personal Notes:

- I'm a huge fan of Rutger Hauer, and was completely stunned to see him in this production. Happily so.

- I'm straight, but if I played for the other team, I can see where Waldemar Torenstra would make me swoon. In college he's the kind of guy we used to call a ""Magnet"". The dude is flat out gorgeous; a more approachable Brad Pitt in his prime. Dang, I wish I looked like him. Can only imagine the copious amounts of tail he gets. <g>",1317945600,33,5027,4.908127208480566
