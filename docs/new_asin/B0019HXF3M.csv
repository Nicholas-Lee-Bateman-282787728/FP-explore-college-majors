What is really notable about this film is the exuberance and stoke that all the surfers show. Whether in the water, being interviewed at home, or padding about in the ubiquitous pink bunny slippers- everyone looks like they are having a really good time. Good humor is front and center in every segment. This is pretty unusual in contemporary surf cinema, there is not a scowl in the bunch. It reminds me of the fun surf movies of the '60. The use of 80's heavy metal in the soundtrack works is an unexpected treat. One shining moment of Antics has Santa Cruz tattoo artist Woody Robinson surfing very creatively in a very serious crowd to Motorhead's ""Ace of Spades"". Just great!
Well paced, well edited, fun and funny, Antics is worth seeing. When you put in the movie be sure to turn it up! This film go to 11!",1212364800,2,936,4.416184971098266
