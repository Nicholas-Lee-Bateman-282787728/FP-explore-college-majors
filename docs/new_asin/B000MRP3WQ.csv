2746414,4,B000MRP3WQ,I am always surprised by the good stories and acting in these movies. The occasional music and dancing can be a little corny but enjoyable. I love being taken to a different culture to see their morals and values. As always there is a twist.,1445644800,,241,4.377777777777778
2746415,5,B000MRP3WQ,"Dealt with the sensitive issue of widowhood in India. I loved it, because Amit Bachchan did a masterful job discussing the need for widows being allowed to live normal lives and remarrying if they wanted to.  My mother was born in a time when some widows were burned on the funeral pyre with their husbands, and I could never understand what justified that, so I was thrilled to see a movie that openly discussed these issues.",1444608000,4,426,4.605263157894737
2746416,4,B000MRP3WQ,"One of the better Bollywood movies. I watch these things because I'm sick of the sex, trash talk and violence on our movie screens so usually it's all song and dance and sweetie romance. In this one they spend the time to really make you care about the characters then pouf the male lead dies and a new guy comes into the picture. The Indian culture is interesting with the arranged marriages and such but I would think it's like American movies - mostly gloss and the way they want you to see things rather than the way things are.

The only real downer in the movie is Mr. Amitabh Bachchan""s horrible wig, he wears the same version of this road kill on his head in every movie.. geez. He chews up the screen to the point of going over the top however the rest of the actors do a good job.",1444348800,,790,4.197368421052632

2746440,4,B000MRP3WQ,"""Baabul"" stars iconic Bollywood film star Amitabh Bachchan as a progressive father-in-law who displays true love and understanding towards his widowed daughter-in-law {Rani Mukherjee] after his son [Salman Khan] is killed in a car crash. Despite societal conventions that typically dictate a widow is to spend the rest of her natural life in mourning for her dead husband, a society that disdains the idea of remarriage [yes, even in contemporary society], this father-in-law tries to get his daughter-in-law a new lease on life by encouraging her to love again , in the form of John Abraham, her old friend who has loved her for years.

The part that did annoy me [and hence only 4 instead of 5 stars] was the way the movie portrayed men making important decisions, irrespective of what the women thought or desired - the mother-in-law in the movie [played by Hema Malini] is against her daughter-in-law's remarrying, and Rani Mukherjee who plays the role of the daughter-in-law is hardly consulted by the men as to what she really wants. Hence, though the movie tries hard to put forth ideas of women being liberated by the shackles of tradition and out-dated conventions, some parts don't quite gel together.

On the whole though, I really liked this movie, mostly because of the stellar cast and credible acting by the leads. I do get tired by the same old commercial Bollywood movies with the typical dance and music routines, and Baabul at least tries to offer something different. The theme may not be new or unique, but the acting makes it credible and engaging. Recommended!",1246924800,4,1583,4.925093632958801
2746441,5,B000MRP3WQ,"It's hard to review this without giving the story away too much. It is a story about love and relationships: not just romantic relationships but between parents and children. It has its light romantic side in among that.
However it also has deeper messages for Indian traditionalists. I gather that traditionally many Indian women do not remarry when they are widowed but are condemned to live a perpetual bereavment with their in-laws.
The movie challenges traditional values and looks to a higher wisdom and greater heart as relevant principles when this happens. So it is also a compassionate movie. It is also about putting ones own ego aside for the sake of others happiness and coming from love instead.
Amitabh Bachchan plays a man of great wisdom, heart and integrity and anchors the movie. It is a moving performance. The other actors similarly do a solid job. A lot is asked of Rani Mukerjee and she rises to it with a breadth of acting and response.
Her 2 love interests to some extent are secondary to the main story but both do well and whether you like them may depend to a large extent on whether you are generally fans.
With my foray into Bollywood it's the first time I've seen John Abraham as other than a muscle bound 'hunk' (not my usual taste in males anyway!) This time he plays a gentler romantic hero and, while that took a bit of adjusting to, he did it well.
I see from other reviewers that Salmon Khan brings a mixed response in people. In this movie I thought he was fine and did what was required.
This movie is about wisdom, integrity and heart and it left me moved. To me that's a very desirable mix.
While it's called a drama and has very dark, serious pictures on the cover it isn't a bleak movie and does have a lot of lightness in it but it does have themes of grief as well.",1229299200,8,1810,4.454819277108434

8171533,5,B000MRP3WQ,"Avi (Salman Khan) falls instantly in love with Millie (Rani Mukerji), and after much wooing and a little trouble, wins her.  She is welcomed by his parents, Balraj (Amitabh Bachchan) and Shobhna (Hema Malini) as if she were their natural daughter.  She and Avi experience years of happiness, and then a life-changing tragedy occurs.  Balraj shows his great love for Millie as he defies traditions to make her happy again.

The first half of this is a delightful romance following the happy life of Avi and Millie.  Mukerji and Khan have good chemistry and played lovers well.  After the tragedy, the film looses it's light-heartedness.  Mukerji and Bachchan both gave excellent emotional performances.  The supporting cast, John Abraham in particular, were quite good.  There was some lovely music, and nice choreography as well.  The plot was strong and well written, as well as well-executed.  This is a wonderful film overall.",1506902400,,929,5.126666666666667
