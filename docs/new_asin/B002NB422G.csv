8502925,5,B002NB422G,"This movie is not for everyone as it is psychologically creepy. However,one of the points is how loneliness can drive some bad behaviors. This movie achieves that message. It is a great psychological thriller. The main character development is pretty good. The cinematic quality is not as good as a mainstream film but decent for an independent film.",1380844800,,350,5.051724137931035
