1776804,2,B00006IKBO,"While this video is informative and a good source of information for older children, I do NOT recommend it for kids under 3 or 4.  My daughter is 2 and loves Elmo's World (we have several other videos) so I figured this would be okay.  WRONG!  She is now having nightmares and will not be left alone in the dark because she is afraid of fire.  She even shakes with fear the way Elmo does at one point during the film.  I think the subject matter is too advanced for her and better suited for older children.",1037318400,7,507,4.185567010309279
1776805,5,B00006IKBO,All of the Elmo videos are a hit at our house and when I saw this one in the store I knew it wouldn't be an exception. This video combines two of my three year old daughters great loves Elmo and fire trucks! A can't miss combination. The video starts with a fire at my Mr. Hooppers store. The fire fighters come to put the fire out and everything is fine but the fire makes Elmo sad and worried. I watched this part with my daughter the first few times. She tends to get upset if she sees Elmo upset but she was fine when she got to see that everything turns out okay. To help Elmo conquer his fear the fire fighters invite Elmo to the station to see what they do. The video is packed with great fire safety tips the most important being that if there is a fire your child should not be sacred of the firefighter and should run towards them. It may seem simple advice but it was something I hadn't ever thought to talk to my daughter about. This video can spark important fire safety discussions with your child. The video continues with a firefighter episode of Elmo's world. There is also a segment of Baby Bear's Hero Guy. The fire fighters used in this video are ones from New York City. I always get a little teary eyed when I see them in this video. I can't help but think of September 11th and how three hundred and thirty four fire fighters heroically gave their lives. I find the scene where Elmo asks them if they ever get scared especially poignant. Thankfully my daughter is too young to understand the horror of September 11th and she justs enjoys this videos with the innocence of a child. This is a wonderful video and a great tribute to fire fighters. May god bless and protect the firefighters everywhere.,1033516800,8,1722,4.317901234567901
1776806,3,B00006IKBO,"We are huge fans of Elmo in this family. My 2 yr old niece and 8 mo old daughter love the Elmo's World Series. However, this DVD is probably intended for kids that are a little older than 3 and can understand more complex subject matter than the usual Elmo's World format. One thing we love about the ""usual"" Elmo format is that any age can enjoy and really learn. Especially for us with kids under 2. This Firehouse series takes this subject very seriously. I am not saying we should not take fire's serious however, this is Elmo! Thank God that in the middle of this DVD there was the Elmo's World format that we are familar with...but at the beginning, you have a very serious incident with Hooper's Store and a fire. The music in the background was very foreboding as well..I could not tell if we were watching Elmo or an after-school special. I also felt that we were dupped by the producers use of a ""filler"" at the end of the DVD---Hero Guy. IF we wanted to watch ""Hero Guy"" we would of purchased that. Please don't place that on our beloved Elmo DVD's! Instead, the Elmo's World that we love is probably only about 18 min on this DVD...the rest is for older kids or just filler. I would buy other Elmo DVD's before this one if you have children under 3.",1033430400,2,1261,4.324894514767933
1776808,4,B00006IKBO,My son loves Elmo. He kept asking for this video because he saw it on our prime tv recommended list. I kept making him watch the trailer but he wouldn't stop asking for it. After I paid for the video and played it for him he absolutely loved it. He still won't stop talking about this video!

1776811,4,B00006IKBO,"I would give 5 stars, but it's not available to buy via Amazon Prime...it's only available to rent. Since my son has asked to watch this video approximately 1 million times, the rental fees are getting a bit high! Wish we could buy it. Adults will think this cheesy, but it is a really great way for children to start learning about fire safety from familiar, friendly faces. Be warned: You will have ""Get out, stay out, dontcha go back in"" stuck in your head for the rest.of.your.life. :) :)",1460332800,,492,4.477777777777778

1776826,4,B00006IKBO,"Takes some scenes from the TV show, but overall a great way to learn about Fire Safety for the little Sesame Street fan. My toddler loves firefighters and firetrucks.",1414195200,,166,4.758620689655173
1776827,2,B00006IKBO,Skipped the first time I got it out of the box. Very disapointed because it was my favorite movie as a child and I wanted my son to watch it.,1413417600,,141,3.7333333333333334
1776828,5,B00006IKBO,"My daughter enjoys this.  Gives a not so scary realistic situation where a fire breaks out at Hooper's store, but all you can see is smoke and no one gets hurt.  Makes my daughter want to visit the firehouse herself!",1405382400,,216,4.375
1776829,5,B00006IKBO,"This is both educational and entertaining for small children. I really like that it goes over what children should do in case of a fire--both in terms of staying low and getting out, as well as not being afraid of firemen in their scary suits. It shows that it's okay to be afraid and I really like how they show Elmo getting over his fear. I don't mind watching it over and over again...as long as my 3 year old is getting something out of it.",1403222400,,444,4.174418604651163
1776830,4,B00006IKBO,"This is one of my son's favorite Elmo DVDs; he requests to watch it pretty much everyday :)
It is educational (but still fun) and teaches toddlers very important information regarding fire safety. It also gives a great opportunity to talk to your little one about how Elmo is feeling (he is scared in the beginning) and how to address those feelings. Also - what is cooler to a 2-year-old than Firefighters and Firetrucks?! He absolutely loves it.

The only downfall I see is that there are two animated shorts in the middle of the show and a Baby Bear short at the end that my son always makes me skip over - probably because they don't have anything to do with Elmo and are not part of the ""normal"" Elmo's World that he is obsessed with. But I guess I just have a picky two-year-old on my hands!",1402876800,,797,4.348993288590604
1776831,4,B00006IKBO,This one is fun.  Again not the most educational but its good.  My 2 year old liked it for a week.,1399507200,,98,3.619047619047619
1776832,5,B00006IKBO,My 2 year old nephew's 2 things are fire trucks and Elmo so he absolutely loves this video. He wants to watch it constantly and this is one kid's video that I don't mind watching more than once a day.,1392940800,,200,4.025
1776833,5,B00006IKBO,Our toddler loves this DVD about the firehouse.  It is a good teaching tool for children.  I am glad I purchased it.,1390089600,,116,4.2272727272727275
1776834,5,B00006IKBO,Great learning tool for what to do in case of a fire.  Also entertaining.  My 3 year old loves to watch this.  He knows that if he sees smoke to get low and go outside.,1387152000,,168,3.742857142857143
1776835,4,B00006IKBO,"The children seemed entranced by this movie. I think it really helped them understand how scarey a fire can be and also gave insight into firefighters lives.  Could have taught about fire hazards too.  In addition to this movie I used a downloaded  DVD of the Disney movie ""I'M No Fool with Fire"" and ""Uncle Donald's Fire Escape Plan"";that I purchased.  These gave more content.",1372377600,,378,4.769230769230769
1776836,3,B00006IKBO,"I would recommend this for a 3 to 4 yr old, there is too much talking in the beginning. Yes it is educational for children and your feelings after a fire, and what to do but it is to much for younger then 3 which is most of Sesame Streets kid audience. I have a 2 yr old and 11 month old twin boys, and they walk away and space out. Want a Sesame Street DVD that will entertain while cooking? Choose Guess that Shape and Color or Dinosaurs. Both by Sesame. Kids won't get bored.",1368144000,,478,3.9895833333333335
1776837,5,B00006IKBO,"Whether you like Elmo or not as a parent, most kids find him irresistible. My toddler can't get enough of this episode and for now she has a life-long dream to become a firefighter. It engages her every time she watches it, and I think she is starting to grasp the fundamentals of fire safety. Too bad there wasn't something like this when I was a young child, that was not too scary to watch but still fun and educational. Even if you don't like Sesame Street or Elmo, this is a great fire safety video for young children. They're never to young to learn!",1362787200,,556,4.304761904761905
1776848,2,B00006IKBO,"The ""on-demand"" Amazon Instant Video version of this video has serious image quality issues.  In summary, overblown brightness and skipping frames.  To be more precise, the image appears as though it was overmodulated, then clipped by some crude analog process.  The frame rate seems to be misinterpreted with a hold, skip cadence.  For example, 1:1:freeze:skip.  It is a shame since I'm sure a lot of good production value was thrown out the window by poor encoding done on the cheap.  Is there no QC process for Amazon Instant Video?  Obviously not.  This video is the old 1.33 aspect ratio.

As far as the content, it is dated... but acceptable.  If you are a helicopter parent who carries hand sanitizer with you at all times, then this may not be the video for you.  If you believe that your child should be aware of the world that surrounds them, and be able to deal with any situation, should they find themselves in one, then I would recommend this video.",1361491200,,963,4.6726190476190474

1776851,5,B00006IKBO,"When my granddaughter was small, she loved this video and squealed with delight when the fire truck drove out of the Fire House.  Alas, she grew up. My grandson is now 2, and I may have bought this prematurely for him.  He loves Elmo, so I know he will eventually get into this video.  Video also includes some good information as to how to act if there is a fire in your home.  Very instructive for small children.",1357948800,,415,4.282051282051282

1776853,5,B00006IKBO,My 2 year-old grandson loves fire trucks and stations so of course this Elmo video is a giant hit with him.  I like the fact that they take the time to teach Elmo that he should not be afraid of what happened in Hooper's store.

1776857,5,B00006IKBO,"I'll admit I almost didn't buy this for my then 2 year old son because of some of the comments about Elmo being too scared.  I'm so glad I didn't listen and bought it anyway!  My husband is a firefighter and EMT and my son is enchanted with anything firefighters.  The video does a great job of teaching children what to do when there is a fire without being too preachy.  Yes, Elmo is scared at the beginning--he was in a very scary situation, but the adults and firefighters are there to make him feel better and by the end he is the happy Elmo we all know.  I watched it with my son the first time, and he was not scared at all.  He is almost 4 now and this is still one of his favorite DVD's.  The lessons are timeless and the video does a great job of showing the kids all about firefighters and how to stay safe when there is a fire.  My husband uses clips of it when he goes into schools during Fire Prevention Week.  I am a teacher, but I teach Middle School, so this video is not appropriate.  However, if I taught younger kids I would definately use it.",1282694400,,1063,4.091787439613527

I watched it with him the first time to see what the FRIGHTENED ELMO deal was about and couldn't believe how much people overreacted. Elmo appears scared & timid but definitely not traumatized! My son wasn't frightened in the least bit and it's good that he learns fires are scary. I'm not trying to raise a sissy.",1276214400,,419,4.526315789473684

It is a little scary whenever there is a fire in Sesame Street, but he learns that as long as you do what you need to do, you'll be fine.

This can be a difficult topic for younger children to understand and this movie does a great job at introducing the topic and reinforcing what you are teaching them.  Children under age 5 are twice as likely to die in a fire - so it is crucial that we do all that we can to reinforce the importance of fire safety.

It's a great way to teach little Elmo Lovers about fire safety and to help them become LESS fearful. Yes, it does show Elmo afraid because a fire in Hooper's store (all they show is smoke coming from the back room due to a small grease fire). He's three years old, of course he's scared! BUT, that's the whole point of the DVD. After the fire, Elmo is invited to and visits the fire station where he talks to and learns about fire fighters, gets a tour of the fire station and learns what to do in case of a fire, and by the end of the DVD he's not scared anymore. It shows that fires don't need to be a scary thing as long as you know what to do. Has catchy songs that teach fire safety, and Elmo does a great job in showing other children that they don't need to be afraid if they know what to do. I think it does a GREAT job at teaching little ones fire safety!",1168214400,,966,3.984536082474227

1776893,5,B00006IKBO,"What is up with some of you people going on about how awful it is that Elmo is scared in this DVD.  Yeah, he should be.  He is in a restaurant when a FIRE starts.  That is the whole idea here.  Kids should know FIRES are dangerous.  My 3 year old loves firefighters. He has 5 fire trucks, a firefighter outfit, a hose, 3 hats and lots of video/DVDs about firefighters.  He is a firefighteroholic but, he also appreciates that FIRE is very dangerous and not something that's fun and yippee!  On the first viewing of this DVD he turns to me and says, ""Papa, Elmo Scared"", and I tell him, ""Yes he is son because, he is in a restaurant that has a lot of smoke coming out of the kitchen.  And he is not sure what is going on"". On the arrival of FDNY Elmo, still shaking, is slowly reassured that it is ok to be scared about FIRE and that it is also understandable that the firefighters in all their uniforms can be scary as well.  Elmo is then invited back to the firehouse to see what a firefighter does and look at all the gear they need. At the end of the firehouse tour Elmo is no longer scared.  So, if you want a good DVD about the dangers of FIRE and what a child should do when a FIRE starts in their presence this is a great DVD to purchase but, if you want your child to live in a dream world where everything is fun and sweet and good enough to eat, stay away from this DVD.",1128643200,18,1380,4.021978021978022

He begs for me to put this in every day. He was not afraid at all in the beginning when Elmo shakes. They do show Elmo very afraid, but the adults in the DVD really do everything to make him feel better and let him explain his feelings. There are catchy songs and good fire safety information. You should preview this DVD and judge for yourself if your child is to sensitive for the part where Elmo shakes in the beginning. If you feel that part is to scary for your child then skip to the next chapter of the DVD. It's a small part of the DVD and the rest of the DVD has so much educational material. I highly recommend this DVD.",1126224000,2,774,4.166666666666667
1776896,4,B00006IKBO,"I enjoy this dvd for several reasons; real footage of firefighters, firetrucks and firehouses. Children try on fire uniforms, fun cartoons followed by your typical ""Elmo's World"" with a fire theme. Lots of sirens, blinking lights and information. Yes, in the beginning of the show Elmo does get scared, god forbid he reflect real feelings. Do we need to protect our children THAT much? I think with Elmo showing he is scared, they are invited to share their scared feelings. Its brief and once Elmo starts meeting more firemen and seeing the firehouse he begins to feel better. It's a great springboard for talking about other feelings besides happy happy joy joy- AND a great start to talking about serious situations. Just as entertaining as other Elmo videos and quite possibly less annoying, than others, for adults. (I don't care for the voice of 'waddle waddle hop hop' and 'itsy bitsy spider')",1122768000,4,900,4.927631578947368
1776897,5,B00006IKBO,"We checked this dvd out from the library a couple of months before our son's second birthday, and we knew right away we would have to buy one for our home.  He would wake up in the morning and beg, ""Elmo Firetruck House?""  He learned all about firefighters and firetrucks.  We bought him a firetruck and hat for his birthday and he plays with them while watching this dvd.  The firefighters in the video are actual firefighters, and they did a great job of teaching what to do in a fire.  We all love this one!",1076803200,9,510,4.270833333333333
1776898,4,B00006IKBO,"This is a very well done educational (IMHO) DVD.  Elmo DOES become scarted, and your child might be scared a bit while watching it, but fire is scarey and it isn't a bad thing to see Elmo scared.  Maria is there with him all along, and mom or dad should be with the child when first viewing this DVD...we used this as a spring board to talk about good fires (to cook with, fireplaces etc) and bad fires.  Kids even in day cares have fire drills, so they aren't as sheltered as most parents think when it comes to fire. But, having a plan in YOUR home is something that everyone should TAKE time to make.  This DVD helps open the door to conversation, and helps kids not be afraid of the firefighter suits.  A good point is made, the firefighter tells Elmo even if the firefighter looks scarey, he is there to help, and if in a fire go to the firefighter not away. I also like the ""get low and go"" tag line it helps us all remember to Get low and Go!",1072656000,6,949,4.108108108108108
1776899,5,B00006IKBO,"My son is two years old, and He loves this dvd. He requests it by name, and I always sit and watch it with him.  He loves Elmo, the firefighters, and even the ""fillers"" that other reviewers aren't too pleased with.
This dvd is for the entire family -- we can all learn something here. While some reviewers think that 2 yrs. old is far too young, I disagree. With repeat viewings, and there have been many of them, my son, realizes that with fire comes the fire fighters who will keep us all safe, warm, and fuzzy -- Sort of like Elmo.
Elmo is very scared after the grease fire at Hooper's store. His raw emotion of fear truly chokes me up. Never before has a muppet had such an impact on me or my son.  Frankie, my son, always points out to me, ""he's scared"".  So, not only is he learning fire safety, but he learning emotion and how to figure out how someone is feeling.
Then after Firefighter Bill takes Elmo around the firehouse, Frankie is relieved to see Elmo back to his usual cute self, playing with the firetrucks like any other kid.
NYFD does an outstanding job helping Sesame Street viewers and residents how to handle the situation should a fire happen.  They were very reassuring and were genuinely concerned about Elmo.
I think this is a perfect addition to fans of Elmo, and fans of Fightfighters.  There is a sequence of ""elmo's World"", some other little cartoons and a video with the 3 little pigs and the big bad wolf called, ""get out stay out don't you go back in!""  and little ones get their turn to show us what firefighters wear and how they feel about them.  Mr. Noodles sister comes for a silly visit and figures out what the fighter of the flames must wear to be safe.  Also, a beautiful girl and close friend of Elmo's, Sabrina, shows us all her family's plan in case of fire.
My son adores the whole dvd, even the silly Baby bear ""hero Guy"" that the movie ends with.",1045526400,3,1892,4.324858757062147
1776900,5,B00006IKBO,"We got this DVD for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it - sometimes loses interest in other Sesame Street videos, but she sits through this one over and over and ... We bought her the Fisher Price Little People firetruck and rescue set, and she plays with them while watching the video.  She was not frightened by this video in the least and chooses it from her many video options to watch regularly.",1044748800,,405,4.45945945945946
1776901,4,B00006IKBO,It took a few times watching it for my son to get over Elmo being scared-and a lot of explaining by me.  But once that was done he really enjoys all the different fire trucks!!  Good video and very information.,1044057600,,210,4.225
1776902,5,B00006IKBO,"As others have indicated this is a great video, and has very quickly become one of my 20 month old son's favorites. He loves the fire trucks and the scene with the fireman's pole. He's also very concerned when Elmo is scared, but seems immediately reassured when Fireman Bill explains all of his equipment.
However the DVD seems to have a very minor incompatibility with my older Sony DVP-S530D DVD player. After hitting play from the main menu we are treated to a blank screen unless we hit fast forward briefly to get it back on track. From then on it's flawless.",1042416000,,565,4.549019607843137
1776903,5,B00006IKBO,"My 2-year old grandson is completely mesmerized by this video.  He wants to watch it all the time - and asks for it by name.
There are so many good lessons to be learned from this production about what to do in case of a fire - and it is directed to the toddler in such a way that not only does it grab his/her attention - but the message that the video intends to convey is done quite well - with subliminal tones.
Be prepared for a different format - an actual trip to the firehouse and a sampling of the life of firefighters with on-camera interviews and interactions.  I categorize it as being more educational than pure entertainment - but what a lesson it brings to the little ones!
I shared this video with the day-care that my grandson attends - and all of the little ones (toddlers) were taken with it.  The mix of real life and regular Sesame Street life is just right for their level of attention and comprehension.
As a grandparent of a young child - I highly recommend it as a holiday stocking stuffer.  It is well worth the cost in terms of life lessons and is certainly appropriate in today's world.",1037750400,6,1114,4.315789473684211
1776904,5,B00006IKBO,"The initial story segment where Elmo experiences a fire at Mr Hoopers store, is scary, and you should definitely watch it with your child.  The rest of the video does a wonderful job of reassuring and teaching your toddler, and my 28 mo old son who is into anything with wheels just loves the video overall.  He does get pretty upset when Elmo is scared initially, but since we never let him watch TV alone, this is not a problem for us.  Incredibly educational about fire safety, and scary situations in general.  I picked it up on tape and regret the necessity for endless rewinds... So do go for the DVD version.",1037491200,10,615,4.464285714285714
