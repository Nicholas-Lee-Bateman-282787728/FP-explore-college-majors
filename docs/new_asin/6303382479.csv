8309917,5,6303382479,"This is a short, fun workout that is great for people not interested in complex choreography. The warm-up section was a little slow and basic for my taste but the faster paced kicking/punching sections were especially fun. I also liked that the program was essentially low impact. I would rate this at an intermediate level, though a beginner could modify and have room to grow. The instructor is a little stoic in her attempt to be professional but that's a refreshing change from chirpy hollering/cheesy grins. The set is plain and non-distracting. If you're not going for fancy or complicated and you like fun moves that don't require a dance degree, this is a decent workout. All in all, a nice ""older gem"".",1158019200,2,711,4.788617886178862
