8609587,5,B003YHB7LW,"Managers of bars and restaurants are busy so providing quarterly training on alcohol sales can be a burden. This DVD makes a great tool to show to all employees every quarter as an excellent refresher regarding responsible alcohol sales. Just make sure to document every time an employee watches the DVD and you have met your requirement for quarterly training.

I also believe that showing this DVD every quarter gives employees consistent information and keeps it fresh in their minds compared to a quick overview given verbally by a manager or trainer. With the DVD you KNOW what information they have received every 3 months so there is no question on whether or not the employee was made aware of the law and skills needed to sell alcohol in a responsible manner.",1320710400,2,768,4.818181818181818
