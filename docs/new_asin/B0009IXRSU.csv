I read about this movie on a listserv I belong to. I couldn't find it locally, so bought it here at a fair price (same as going out to a movie on Friday night).  It was entertaining... pretty funny. I enjoyed it enough to watch again. (I lent it to a friend who teaches French to use with her class).",1209772800,,321,4.015625
