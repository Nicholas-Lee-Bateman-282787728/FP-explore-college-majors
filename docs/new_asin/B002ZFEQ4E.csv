4018205,5,B002ZFEQ4E,"The next volume in The Real Ghostbusters is just as great as the first! As a child I loved The Real Ghostbusters and watch the show today brings back fond memories of watching the show before school and on Saturday mornings! The first vol contains the episodes with the Bogeyman and Samhain but this set also contains some truly well written adventures. Some of my favorite episodes on this vol include:

The Devil in the Deep- Peter basically has to rescue his fellow Ghostbusters after a sea monster swallow them whole!

The Thing in Mrs. Faversham's Attic- The Ghostbusters get a call from an old woman to bust some ghosts that have forced her from going into her attic for thirty years!

The Collect Call of Cathulhu- When the Necronomico is stolen from the public library, the Ghostbusters find themselves battling sewer creature and chasing after cults to solve this mystery!

In the end The Real Ghostbusters is a gem in cartoon history that shouldn't be missed by either fans or today's youth! Stop watching Dragon Ball whatever and put on some good old American cartoons!",1289952000,8,1080,4.790322580645161
4018206,4,B002ZFEQ4E,"Volume 2 has some of the classic episodes of the series (Ragnarok and Roll, The Collect Call of Cathulu, The Bird of Kildarby, Masquerade, Janine's Day Off, etc) but most of the episodes here are just average at best. Some episodes obviously hold up better than others after all these years, but that was to be expected. Some of my major concerns, however, were the great differences in audio/video quality between one episode and the next. Some episodes look and sound great, and some of them look and sound a little muddy -- as if they weren't remastered (or remastered well). This does not affect enjoyability of the series, though, especially if you're a fan like me who has been waiting for this series to be released on DVD for many years.",1286409600,3,745,4.651515151515151
4018207,5,B002ZFEQ4E,"The second volume is just as good as the first, with monsters, vampires, werewolves and a demon in an old lady's attic, vol. 2 gives us variety of things they have not delt with and things they used too. One of the best cartoon series of 80's. Worth picking up.",1270944000,,261,4.24
4018208,5,B002ZFEQ4E,"I was very excited when I received this awesome DVD set. This Cartoon is very awesome and timeless,just like the wonderful and awesome funny Movies. Lots of great episodes are on this DVD set as well as a show that talks about how they made the Cartoon. This is a great DVD set that goes along great with any Cartoon DVD set big time!!",1268697600,,335,4.25
4018209,5,B002ZFEQ4E,"Not much is there to say other than this volume had some awesome episodes and leaves me wanting more.  Please, don't take a long time to release the rest of the volumes.  I can not wait for the next set of real ghostbusters episodes.",1268611200,,233,4.2727272727272725
4018210,5,B002ZFEQ4E,"Although initially disappointed that Volume 2 did not include a metallic cover like Volume 1, I'm still pleased with the release, and am anxious to see the release of Volume 3.

The 31 episodes contained in this set all come from Season 2 of ""The Real Ghostbusters"", but even with the season 2 episodes also included in Volume 1, there's still a few more from season 2 to be released.

The humor in this series, although 80's dated in some areas, still translates easily to today's audiences, and in many cases, leaves one gasping for air from laughing so hard! Many of them also offer fascinating insights into classic legends from various cultures, including the Greek pantheon, with a little Ghostbusters twist.

Voice artists Arsenio Hall and Lorenzo Music continue with their great performances as Winston and Egon, while the amazing Frank Welker continues primarily as Slimer, and other characters.

I'm not including an episode-by-episode review, because I don't want to ruin the set for anyone, except that for me, it was a great investment. I'm already impatient for the next set! Bring it on! :-D",1268611200,2,1106,4.93010752688172
4018211,5,B002ZFEQ4E,Love this show! The humor is so beyond what you usually got with Sat. morning cartoons. Waiting for Vol. 3!,1267660800,,107,4.4
4018212,4,B002ZFEQ4E,"All I can say is if you expect to get a nice steel box like the first vol.....This is not for you! After that being said,I love the Real Ghostbusters and I would purchase these dvds individually, but I want to be offered the same thing as the complete collection. I do not want a dvd in a plastic keepsake with a cardboard slip cover! This is an insult! Thanks TimeLife! If you love the Real Ghostbusters and do not want to spend 140,150,170 dollars on a complete collection then buy this and try to be happy. At least you can own the Ghostbusters at an affordable price. You get 5 discs with the episode guide booklet minus the steel box. Other than the fact that I dislke not getting the steel box, I'd recommend this box set for everyone that loved the show.",1265846400,15,761,4.291666666666667

This set really contains some of the best episodes of the show, from the famous Cthulhu episode, to the one parodying Citizen Kane, the one with the battle between werewolves and vampires, to my personal favorite of the show, the one were a guy plots to bring about Ragnarok because he got dumped by his girlfriend.",1312070400,4,477,4.482758620689655

8384768,3,B002ZFEQ4E,"'Please note that this is a review of the recent 2016 release, not the previous set from Sony/Time Life'.

Not a bad release. The episodes are of very decent quality. They are missing their episode title cards (but all the episodes on these releases seem to have that issue), instead a quick flash of subtitles on the title screen let you know the episode name and the writer.

So why does this release only get 3 stars.....Sony goofed!

There are supposed to be 13 episodes on this DVD, but they skipped one; 'Adventures in Slime and Space', I just checked Volume 3 (which I brought earlier) and it didn't have it on there. Now if you buy this volume online (through Amazon Video's streaming service etc.) surprise, surprise 'Adventures in Slime and Space' is there. So it's on the digital release, but not the DVD?!

OK, I can understand that you can only have a certain number of episodes on a disc fair enough, but they should have known better. The later volumes have only about 11 episodes, where there should have been 12 like the others, but they are not, I just mentioned the missing episode is not on Volume 3 (DVD or digitally), because it's not supposed to be there, at least not at this point in the Syndicated season, unless Sony jumbled up some episodes, but apart from 'Adventures in Slime and Space' they have been consistent on when and where they're supposed to be to when they were originally broadcasted.

Oh and the episode 'Knock, Knock' is the version with the Ghostbusters theme playing, instead of Tahiti's song 'The Boogeyman', but that's a very minor gripe compared to a missing episode. (I also fear Volume 1 has a similar issue), Sony should have really known better.",1479427200,,1697,4.6433333333333335
8384769,4,B002ZFEQ4E,"Great show! Not many examples of live action films spawning directly translative cartoon shows that succeed, but this is one of the best of them. If you liked the ghostbusters films, you can't help but be made to smile by this gem!",1479168000,,231,4.523809523809524
