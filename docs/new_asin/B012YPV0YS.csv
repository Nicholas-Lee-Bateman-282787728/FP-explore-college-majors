I returned it and got a replacement, only to discover the exact same issue. I was finally able to find the episode that wasn't working on the library's copy, so the issue was some problem with the production run. Something about how the discs were burned makes the DVD player crash a few minutes into Episode 25 ""Good 'Quil Hunting.""",1499212800,2,477,4.759036144578313

I do have every episode recorded on VHS (when it aired) but it's great to have the official box set. A few things keep it from being perfect:

The interlacing is bad--but just on the openings and closings. The logo is so jagged that it looks like it was downloaded off the internet with high compression. I'm not sure if 4Kids did something when they edited the original or if someone else got the wrong tape down the line. If anything, it looks enhanced by something digital by how large the jaggies are. The episodes themselves do not suffer the same amount of interlacing artifacts as the openers and appear equal to earlier seasons. When comparing it to the Indigo League, the compression was about the same, which is quite high but understandable given that there are 10 episodes on a disc. Included a snapshot of the opening logo and a title card from an episode of this season and a card from the Indigo League.

No episode lists. I know the repackaged versions of Indigo and Orange Islands got rid of these but there really should be a list included. There are a lot of episodes and it's hard to keep track of them all.

They do include the featured song at the end of each episode! Menus are also nice. I did notice that the sound levels are much quieter compared to the previous seasons. Again, not sure if 4Kids used different methods for mixing/dubbing or if someone did something to it later.

Overall, this will help fill that missing void of season 3.",1459296000,2,1895,5.546712802768166

If you're a fan of the original seasons (Indigo League - Advanced Battle), then this is definitely worth buying",1458604800,,229,4.871794871794871
7359354,1,B012YPV0YS,"First off, to all the people complaining about it only going to the 2nd gym badge...well, of course. That is season three. The other three gym badges are in Johto League Champions, which is season four. This is the complete third season, Johto Journeys, which only cover the first two badges.  Keep in mind the Johto league wasn't one season like the original arc before Orange Islands. The fourth season will be released in May.

That said. The aspect ration sucks. It's only 4:3 and doesn't fully spread out on my tv. There are no subtitles, which is critical for disabled consumers. I've emailed The Pokemon Company and they've refused to give a response to this accessibility fail - I'm taking it to Viz Media next as they currently handle the license. I am pissed off that a DVD released in 2015 lacks something that is a glaring accessibity issue. The older and newer seasons on Netflix and Hulu are subtitled and my older VHS tapes have closed captions. There is no excuse.

This is flimsy and poorly produced. I checked it out from the library instead of buying and I'm glad. The packaging from what I've seen is flimsy.

This isn't worth $30. This saddens me. You can do better, Pokemon. This is one of my favourite arcs and my second favourite theme.",1458172800,6,1260,4.611607142857143

7359368,5,B012YPV0YS,"At long, long, LONG last... we finally have all these rare episodes available in one lovely package. And I can die happy.

I was what we today might call a ""tween"" when the earliest Pokemon games and cartoons first came out all the way back in September of 1998. I don't want to say I grew up on them, because I was already past the most impressionable ages, but the point is, I followed them for *years.* I bought all the VHS tapes. I played every game. When DVD firmly took hold in the early 2000's, I went back and repurchased all of the original DVD formats, with a meager 3 episodes per disc (something like 54 minutes in total). I actually still have all of my original DVD's of this season - across something like 13 discs, which is decidedly cumbersome by modern standards - but those originals have been out of print now for more than a decade. You....likely don't want to know to what lengths I had to go to get some of them....

When I happened to see this on the shelf at Target the other day as I was walking by the DVD section on my way to buy a new phone charger (I haven't been paying close attention to new Pokemon releases these past several years), my heart skipped a beat and I actually dropped my hand cart. (Let me back up a moment, and mention that both the Johto episodes and games were far and away my favorite of the actual game-inspired storylines - the Orange Islands remain my clear cartoon favorite, but had no basis in the video game series.) Could it be? After all these 15 long years? I knew they had re-released the Indigo League and Orange Islands episodes...but these? Sure enough! Now any modern Pokemon fan can actually watch the episodes of the show corresponding with the re-releases of Gold & Silver as ""HeartGold"" & ""SoulSilver"" from a few years back.

Sure, there's really nothing in the way of special features, and the menu package is rather less than robust, but we've been through enough of these TV box sets by now to know not to expect anything much on either count except from the full-length films. I'm just immensely happy that these exist at all.",1449187200,2,2099,4.4186046511627906

7359371,5,B012YPV0YS,"After 15 years, Pokmon: The Johto Journeys has been released on one DVD box set. Containing all the episodes of this season of the hit show (including the long-since out of print ""Psychic Sidekicks"" and ""Fortune Hunters""); the set has hours of fun for young children and fans of the franchise. The picture and sound quality are terrific; and many can relive their favorite adventures from this season as a result. No Pokmon DVD collection should be without this set. Despite some criticism leveled against Viz's previous DVD releases (which omitted certain episodes and left unsightly gaps in the sets as a result); the company has learned from their mistakes by including the bulk of the season on this set. I would definitely recommend picking it up.",1447977600,,752,4.929133858267717
7359372,5,B012YPV0YS,"I'm writing a 2 star review because there are 4 discs. I'm almost done with the 3rd disc and Ash doesn't have the second badge yet so I'm doubting this is even half the series. This is sad because the quality of these episodes are great! I just find it disrespectful to lie and false advertise.

** my update is a apology really. I change my review to a 5 star rating because I was unaware that they split the whole Johto region into like 3 seasons. So every episode is accounted for and in amazing quality. Please buy this. Just be aware that this is not all 8 badges and just the first 2. ",1447977600,3,591,4.130434782608695

The DVD menus have somehow been programmed in such a way that they lock out all button presses, leaving me no way to progress past the initial splash screen.  The only work around that I can find is to press stop, which backs out of the entire dvd, and then press play again, which will launch into the first episode of the disk. After that all navigation between episodes has to be done using the scene skip function.",1447545600,,542,4.41
7359375,5,B012YPV0YS,"Super excited to finally be able to have this season on DVD! :) This season is one of my favourites! I love the Pokmon Kareokmon at the end of each episode! Before this release, it was very hard to find copies of this season and whenever I could find any, they were really expensive. Glad they finally released this on a complete DVD set! Hopefully they will release the other seasons on complete DVD sets!",1447372800,,406,4.426666666666667
7359376,4,B012YPV0YS,"Excited that they made the box set! In giving it 4 star because when I received it, one of the dvds was lose and was dirty on the back. It's not scratched but I wasn't impressed about that. It came a week early though! :)",1447372800,,221,3.933333333333333

The four dvds  only go as far as two badges",1447286400,,78,3.875
7359379,5,B012YPV0YS,"FINALLY we get the complete 3rd season here in a complete box set! Is it really well done as compared to some imports...no, but at least we get them all in one set rather than individual dvds which are far too expensive and are out of print. I was worried that this would be missing episodes like the re-releases of (thinner packaged) Season 1 (Indigo League) and (thinner packaged) Season 2 (Orange Islands). This indeed has all 41 episodes from season 3, The Johto Journeys! 10 episodes on each disc with the last one having 11.

So here is what I THINK Viz will do next:
The Johto League Champions The Complete Collection
re-release (thinner packaged) Master Quest The Complete Collection
re-release (thinner packaged) Advanced The Complete Collection
Advanced Challenge The Complete Collection
Advanced Battle The Complete Collection
re-release (thinner packaged) Battle Frontier The Complete Collection
re-release (thinner packaged) Diamond and Pearl The Complete Collection
re-release (thinner packaged) DP Battle Dimension The Complete Collection
re-release (thinner packaged) DP Galactic Battle The Complete Collection
re-release (thinner packaged) DP Sinnoh League Victors The Complete Collection

Possibly
re-release (thinner packaged) Black & White The Complete Collection
re-release (thinner packaged) BW Rival Destinies The Complete Collection

BW Adventures in Unova and BW Adventures in Unova and Beyond are already in their slimist release so I think Viz won't bother. They may start doing X&Y complete some day as well. Who knows. But regardless, I hope Viz continues and with no more missing episodes like seasons 1 and 2.",1447113600,8,1640,5.448818897637795

So I decided to look up to buy season 3 and what better timing to have this be available :) I can't wait!! I'm a 90's baby and Pokemon was my childhood and nothing is better than reliving your childhood favorites!!",1444608000,,386,4.375

7359382,5,B012YPV0YS,"Four stars sight unseen.  But I am excited for the two extra episodes, first time on DVD, hopefully.  I haven't seen the listing of episodes yet, but the original 13 DVDs each had three episodes.  That's 39 episodes and this set says it has 41.  So here's hoping for ""Psychic Sidekicks"" and ""Fortune Hunters""!

EDIT: I received my set yesterday and I can confirm the two episodes ""Psychic Sidekicks"" and ""Fortune Hunters"" are indeed included in this set!  And they also have the ""Who's that pokemon?"" section in the middle of the episode.  It even has a ""Pokemon Karaoke"" at the end of the episode.  I can also comment on the visual quality, which is great!  It's in line with all the other early DVD releases and matches the quality of the individual Johto DVD releases.  Raising my review to five stars.

Thank you Viz Media!

EDIT2: I spent some time with the set this weekend observing closely the visual quality.  I ripped the video and inspected it frame by frame on my PC.  The video is as you'd expect from any DVD release - 720x480, 4x3, interlaced, 30fps (actually 29.97fps).  I used an AviSynth decomb filter to make it progressive again.  This is the usual for these Pokemon episodes.  The pulldown pattern does not match up to the usual 3:2, so I have to use the auto decomb filter.  I can safely report that the visual quality is outstanding, and at least as good as the individual episode discs... with one exception.  One episode, ""Forest Grumps"", was not so good.  It looked blurry with blended frames and such.  I compared it to the same episode from the Johto Journeys Vol. 51 ""Ursaring Rampage"" disc expecting to see the same problems.  I did not.  That episode on was problem free on the original release.  So aside from that one episode, I have no issues whatsoever with this being a four disc release.

Here is a list of episodes included with this set:

Don't Touch That 'dile
The Double Trouble Header
A Sappy Ending

We want quality anime! They are becoming like the Malaysian knock-off DVDs and cramming a season on 3 or 4 DVDs. I recently purchased the Malaysian knock-offs of this season (4DVDs) for $13 dollars. It saved me money and I bet the quality is going to be the same as this newly-crammed set.",1438646400,3,453,4.341176470588235

I hope the other seasons will follow this trend. It would be nice to have Johto League Champions and Master Quest as well! :)

Edit: This is a bit late, but I received my copy a few weeks ago. The quality of the DVDs is fantastic! There's nothing wrong at all! Every episode in Season 3 is also present! I'm very happy with this purchase! The only thing I don't really like about this set is the fact that there's no episode guide to see which episodes are on each disc, but that's not much of a problem. I still give this a 5 star rating! I also recommend this set to anyone who's a fan of Pokemon (especially Johto Journeys). You won't be disappointed!",1438473600,23,822,4.269230769230769
