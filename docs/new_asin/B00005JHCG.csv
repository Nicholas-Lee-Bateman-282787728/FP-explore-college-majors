1466194,3,B00005JHCG,DCI Tanner is a man who needs no help to crack the toughest cases.  On his most recent murder he is assigned a new assistant who is looking to use this case to clear her sullied reputation.  When Tanner's eyesight begins to fail he decides to brazen it out and conceal his disability.  When detective Tully finds out the truth she offers to strike a deal with Tanner and serve as his eyes in exchange for his pushing her career along.  The case allows them both to gain respect for each other and to learn that a sharp mind is more important than sharp eyes in police work.,1021939200,3,573,4.277777777777778
1466195,5,B00005JHCG,"Fans of the art house cult hit CROUPIER will delight in this first entry in yet another first-rate British mystery series.  Clive Owen, who made Jack Manfred a classic antihero in CROUPIER, fleshes out a fascinating character in DCI Ross Tanner as the SECOND SIGHT series begins with this two-tape set.  Tanner is a divorced (aren't they always?) workaholic with an ambitious ex-wife and an adoring young son who seems to double as Tanner's only real friend.  In this go-round, Tanner is beginning to lose his eyesight to a rare disease for which there stands no present cure.  Hiding his condition and his terror is not going to be easy, however.  The fadeouts are unpredictable and often frightening and his new partner, Catherine Tully, is on to him.  Equally ambitious, and out to correct an old wrong, Tully offers to be Tanner's eyes if he will give her a crack at their new case--the death of a young university student in his own backyard while no one in the family seemed to notice.
Claire Skinner is, as always, expert and enjoyable to watch but its Clive Owen's show all the way.  His unconventional good looks and rugged exterior share space with a tender, devoted father and a fair-minded, ingenious detective but Owen also gives Ross Tanner something else, that rarest of things in movie characters--the suggestion of an inner life which is every bit as fascinating as his day-to-day crime solving.  Great production values and fine supporting performances (especially from Stuart Wilson and Phoebe Nicholls) make SECOND SIGHT a must for any British mystery video library.",1002672000,39,1586,4.93609022556391

1466334,5,B00005JHCG,"Clive Owen was brilliant as D.C.I. Tanner.  He gave the role a great deal of feeling and yet was still the STRONG, SILENT INSPECTOR.

1466396,4,B00005JHCG,Enjoyable enough although not the best from the BBC.  I found the premise a bit hard to believe but do like Clive Owen.

1466484,5,B00005JHCG,"With all the class that the British are noted for in the production of television series for the export trade, Second Sight is a police procedural that grips one from beginning to end. With his sight endangered, the head of an elite ""Murder Squad"" has to find a way to play his professional role while he awaits the verdict on the outcome of his illness. Both in the role of police officer and divorced father, as commander and lover, he must find a way to fulfill his obligations while trying to cope with an increasingly crippling personal disaster. One  of the strengths of the production is its ability to show the officers emotional stress without sinking into bathos and overwrought emotionalism. Another strength is that the cases themselves are interesting quite apart from the problems of the chief  officer. The plots are strong, the scenic design supportive, the acting consistent with the tradition of quality. All in all, a series many will enjoy.",1352505600,,960,4.883435582822086
1466485,3,B00005JHCG,"""Second Sight, Season 1."" (1999-2001) is a British-made television series, a police procedural/ British mystery/thriller. It was made jointly by the British Broadcasting Corporation, and WGBH, Boston flagship station of the American public broadcasting network.  This first series concerns just the one murder; the episodes have been cut so as to give the viewer a continuous narrative. In it, British detective DCI Ross Tanner must change his approach to investigating crimes in the middle of a murder case when he finds he has developed an obscure eye disorder (AZOOR) that causes spells of blindness and hallucinations. He chooses to try to hide the problem from his colleagues, as it is grounds for dismissal from the job.  He therefore strikes a deal with his beautiful blond second in command DCI Catherine Tully.  If she will cover his back, he will share any eventual glory with her.  Tanner, whom we understand lives for his work, desperately tries to continue his investigations; he eventually realizes that solving crimes is as much about what's not visible as what is.

A young, charismatic, rough-hewn Clive Owen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Men/dp/B000QGAU4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Men</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-Man/dp/B000ICXQHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside Man</a>) plays Tanner. Claire Skinner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Dance-to-the-Music-of-Time/dp/B000QXDCWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Dance to the Music of Time</a>) who doesn't look much like a copper, and must then have been beautiful blond of the week, plays Tully.  The case involves the brutal murder of a young man, son of Judith Bendrix (Phoebe Nicholls,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brideshead-Revisited-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B005GP7ELW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brideshead Revisited: 30th Anniversary Edition</a>) and Adam Bendrix, (Stuart Wilson,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fascination/dp/B001NQHNGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fascination</a>&nbsp;) who also plays Adam's identical twin, Jack Kenworthy.

Owen, who can project tough vulnerability, does not make Tanner a loveable man.  He's a drunk, a womanizer, neglectful of his family, and a tough boss - but he gets the job done.  The crime drama is interesting in its portrayal of Tanner's impaired vision, with flashes of light, and other graphic effects onscreen.  It is dark, thoughtful and suspenseful: the ambiance of London, and of the cop shop, is well-portrayed.  It's intense, and gripping - would have to be with Owen on hand.  The series was created by Paula Milne, one of Britain's leading screenwriters, who left school just before her fifteenth birthday, without academic qualifications, and pretty much began her TV career as the tea girl.  She broke in as a script writer at CORONATION STREET, did some RUTH RENDELL MYSTERIES, also penned I DREAMED OF AFRICA, and THE VIRGIN QUEEN.

I can remember loving and looking forward to this series as it was broadcast in the United States on BBCAmerica:  I'm always a sucker for intensity and ambiance.  Of course, in those days, BBCAmerica broadcast many fine British mysteries; now they broadcast supernatural crap.  More critically, I could hear it back then; make out what people were saying, whereas now, although I could follow the basic plot, the dialog of the blond, and the cockneys in the cop shop, went right by me.  So far as I know, neither the BBC nor WGBH is short of finance, so I don't know why they would have chosen to limit the audience that can enjoy this fine, cerebral film in this penny-wise, pound-foolish way.  A very good film, if you can follow it.",1328572800,6,3844,6.1247672253258845
1466486,5,B00005JHCG,"The premise of this superior British police thriller is that the brilliant young investigator Ross Tanner, compelling played by Clive Owen, is going blind. As his sight deteriorates due to a rare virus, he literally sees stars -- and sometimes he sees things which aren't there. The acting is enhanced by wonderful camera work and an unusually perceptive script.
Tanner, aided by a young, up and coming female investigator played by Claire Skinner, is trying to solve the mysterious murder of a 19-year-old student. He tries to hide his worsening blindness but she catches on and makes a deal: she'll be his eyes if she can share credit for solving the murder and put her career back on track.
There are plenty of backstories, well-developed, and a good supporting cast, but the chemistry between the two leads is what makes this mini-series compelling.
The plot itself uses Tanner's blindness and his ""visions"" of things that are not there as a metaphor. Of course, nothing is what it seems. The dead boy's step-father, his long-lost uncle, his mother, his girlfriend, all have their particular view of the murder and the victim -- but each one is looking from a particular angle through their own blinkers -- or in one case their own, elaborately-constructed fiction.
It all makes for a satisfying, complex brew with many different flavors going into the mix. And it works on many levels, as a human drama, a straight police investigation and a metaphorical probe into what is, and what merely appears to be.",1290643200,6,1510,4.90234375

1466489,5,B00005JHCG,We really enjoyed this collection (Second Sight).  It was fascinating watching this detective deal with his every decreasing vision.  We were sorry when it was over!,1270425600,,165,5.3076923076923075
1466490,5,B00005JHCG,"Second Sight premiered in America on PBS' Mystery.  For most American's this was their introduction to Clive Owen.

Clive Owen stars as DCI Ross Tanner, the head of the Elite Murder Unit. Like the other great British police detectives of the time, Ross Tanner had an issue that he had to contend with.  But unlike the others, this cannot be cured.  He has a rare eye disease and is slowly loosing his sight.  The only person who knows his secret is DI Catherine Tully.  Like most British shows, this focuses on quality over quantity.  Therefore, there are only five two hour episodes.

The following are the episodes:

Second Sight Pilot: Tanner discovers he is losing his sight but has been made the head of an elite murder unit.  The first case has a number of suspects including Tanner's stepfather.

Hide and Seek: Vicki Inghram has been brutally murdered.  Tanner wants to recreate the scene but the use of Vicki's son causes more issues than tanner expected.

Parasomnia: A man is bludgeoned to death after his stag party.  His fiance wakes up covered in blood but has no recollection of the murder.  Tanner starts having hallucinations due to his losing his sight.

Kingdom of the Blind: Tanner is investigating a hate crime.  Everything points to retired gangster, Harold King.  The only this is King is blind.  But while Tanner uses his blindness to seek the truth, King has let his fester his hate.

While Owen's Ross Tanner does not compare to Helen Mirren's Jane Tennison or Clive Owen's Dave Creegan, these five episodes show are still better than most American detective shows of the time.  Kingdom of the Blind is by far the best of the lot.  It is too bad that it stopped there.

For Clive Owen fans, this is an insight to his early career.  For everyone else, this is a great detective series.",1263686400,8,1810,4.673015873015873
1466491,4,B00005JHCG,"I just rewatched this series again after several years and am dismayed to find it unavailable except through private sellers.  Since this is the 10th anniversary of the first airing of Set 1, perhaps they are planning a rerelease edition.  Any way you can get your hands on a copy of this BBC series first aired in America on PBS Mystery! you won't regret it.  At the time, Owen was well-known in his native Britain from other TV projects, but it would be a few more years before he hit the consciousness of American film viewers with roles in ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""King Arthur"".  Owen looks like a young pup here, his frame lankier and his face not yet filled out to its current proportions.  His DCI Ross Tanner is impulsive, rough around the edges and a bit of a prick, both to the underlings on his squad and to his ex-wife.  He's an erratic father to his 9-year-old son Sam, who idolizes him.  In fact, when we first meet Tanner, he's cancelling a scheduled visit with his boy so he can stay at the pub and hit on the barmaid.  He's got the infuriating habit of hanging up on people and refusing to explain where he's going and what he's thinking.  He smokes and drinks and cats around way too much, all in the best noir detective tradition.  While his interpersonal skills may be lacking, Tanner is a brilliant copper who gets results, so his egotistical management style is tolerated in more or less good humor by his subordinates and his bosses.  Tanner is a high-flyer . . . until one morning when he wakes up and discovers that he's losing his eyesight.  In the midst of trying to run an investigation into the murder of a high-profile businessman's son, and manage a new colleague (Claire Skinner), who's as ambitious for career advancement as she is attracted to her new boss, Tanner has to slip away to see doctors without drawing attention to his 'problem'.  How long he will be able to cover his increasing disability and still do his job becomes the focus of the rest of the series.  The first set, a two-part episode featuring a tour-de-force performance by one of the guest actors in a dual role, is compelling and sets a high bar for the rest of the series.  Set 2 is comprised of three two-part episodes, none of which are as strong as the first case, particularly after Skinner departs the series halfway into the first episode.  But the pleasure here is in watching Owen and the rest of the squad ply their craft.  Even when you know the outcome of all these cases, the acting and production design remain top-drawer and a pleasure to watch.  All of the actors in the ensemble cast deserve kudos for their creation of a realistic working murder squad.

Owen's trademark self-containment as an actor is is evidence here, and one muses that he would have been a smashing Bond, albeit one with completely different physicality than Daniel Craig.  Sometimes Owen's facial resemblance to a young Sean Connery is unmistakable.  What Owen and Craig share as actors is a cool detachment and complete self-possession that make them the masters of their cinematic universe.  Owen has made some interesting choices since this project, some artistically successful (Closer; Children of Men; Duplicity), some not (Derailed; The International).  Seems that he's trying to find a way to navigate being ""Hollywood"" without completely selling out and finding the path not so smooth.  But he seems completely at home as DCI Ross Tanner, and makes us sorry that the series was so short-lived.  For Owen fans, this is a don't miss, and points to the kind of quality work he is capable of, when he has a project to match his talents.",1256774400,,3639,4.6484375
1466492,5,B00005JHCG,"I reviewed this series two years ago, under a different nickname. However, after completing a Second Sight ""marathon"" last weekend, I felt compelled to share my thoughts once again with fellow Second Sight enthusiasts. The series has aged SO WELL, viewing it remains a joy. It proves just how much the American cinema has underutilized the great acting talent of Mr Owen's... Here is my original review, as true today, as it was two years ago (though Bean's latest Sharpe episode was not so good, I'm affraid):

""Why is it that British TV can be sooo grand at times? I rushed out to buy Second Sight after catching a glimps of the series on a public TV chanel. What is right about it? Everything: original plot, charismatic lead (I am not a fan of Clive Owen's, EXCEPT in this performance), well chosen supporting cast, quality production. You yearn for another installment of the series, though with Clive Owen gaining popularity in the US, that does not seem likely (can he take a lesson from Sean Bean, who did not forget his roots, and recently returned, for a brief moment, to the TV series ""Sharpe"" that had ""made him""?). There is nothing on American TV that compares well to the sofistication of this product. Buy it, watch it, share it!""

PS: The set contains all four episodes, each one slightly over two hours long.",1251331200,,1325,4.682403433476395
1466532,5,B00005JHCG,"I would highly recommend this DVD set!  It's wonderfully written, acted and directed.  I originally bought this set because of Clive Owen.  It's a set of Mystery! episodes that is delicious in it's intricacy and multi-layered plot.  The main character is endearingly human many faults and illness, coupled with his on-going family problems.  Clive Owen is fantastic in this series and his acting is impeccable!  The supporting actors are terrific, as well.

This DVD set is well worth the price.",1204761600,,495,5.1125

1466534,4,B00005JHCG,"This enjoyable mystery's strengths are commented on quite ably by the reader reviews on this site.

Permit me to point out two minor complaints which have not been brought up:

1.) Clive Owen's character suffers from a vision impairment. So why, oh why, do we also get subjected to auditory hallucinations as well? Are the filmmakers just trying to use every trick in their bag to heighten suspense? This happened so frequently, I got a bit annoyed.

2.) Why must every mystery end with the villain toying with the  hero and explaining in full every last detail of any plot developments that are still murky? This was a tired ploy in every Scoobie Doo episode I ever watched, and I was saddened to see it employed here as well.",1187395200,4,727,4.612403100775194
1466535,4,B00005JHCG,"I was pleasantly surprised at how well Clive Owen acted in this series.  In some of his movies he seems a little too stiff, however, in this series he is warm and believable.  This is the story of a detective on the fast track who is losing his sight.  Reading the synopsis you may think that ""Second Sight"" is referring to being able to see into the future/past; however that is not the case.  He is losing his sight due to a viral infection that is uncurable.  He is unable to hide this condition from his most able coworkers (they are detectives after all), and has to lean on a few of them which is something he hates to do.  This series would have been better has the intro been deleted off of it, but the show was very good and the last show of the series had a wonderful and satisfying ending.",1179187200,5,800,4.196078431372549
1466536,5,B00005JHCG,"DVD or Video--This is an engrossing 2-part detective movie PBS (or BBC?)about a detective who is losing his sight after an accident. He tries to hide the fact from his police force, while solving a case. Great plot and acting.

NOTE TO AMAZON: Can Amazon Note in their product description when a DVD or Video (like Second Sight) offers DVS--Descriptive Video Service, an audio descripton option for viewers with visual impairment--low vision or blindness?

Same way you may list when a product offers CC --Closed Captioning for viewers with hearing impairment--deaf, hard of hearing, etc.

For those who have visual impairment, this DVD/video/TV movie offers the option of Descriptive Audio, a quiet voice that describes key visual scenes (e.g., ""The man slips into the room and hides a key under the phone."") To use this, check SECOND SIGHT video menu for additional features.  On regular TV, you click the MTS or SAP button on your TV remote and highlight MTS or SAP-- when a program has it, a subtle voice describes all the video action.  The voice in no way interferes with the video voice--in fact, it helps the viewer.

My husband is blind, and this way we can both watch DVD. (If the program does not have it, clicking SAP or MTS will play classical music or Spanish translation).

I'm sighted, but I love Descriptive Audio for when I'm tired, too--I never miss a trick this way!

We urge ALL DVD/video makers to add descriptive video---PBS tv stations offer a great many programs with DV (e.g., Masterpiece Theatre, series, etc.)--some networks--NBC, CBS, ABC--must also, by law--look oline on tv schedule to see if DA or DV appears (where the initials CC, for ""Closed Captions"" for deaf viewers, normally appears).",1178496000,8,1723,4.917241379310345

Ever since then I've been a fan. After checking out his movies on amazon I came across ""Second Sight"".  It sounded pretty interesting- Clive Owen plays a police detective who is losing his sight. He has to deal with temporary blindness and hallucinations- not to mention solving the case.

I've never purchased a British television show before so I was a bit apprehensive. I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to understand some of the accents, or even the terms. Overall though, I was able to understand it very well. I can only remember one time where I rewound two or three times before giving up on that one phrase because I had no idea what they said.

Clive was fabulous. He plays the tough detective (Ross Tanner) so well, but was also able to show that he was a loving father to his son. His difficulty in accepting that he had a problem was hard to watch. Claire Skinner costars as his partner (Catherine Tully).  It was interesting to watch her mind work, whether it was figuring out the crime, or noticing her partner had a problem.

I thoroughly recommend this series to anyone who loves mysteries or detective stories. Or if you're a Clive Owen fan like me.  Buy ""Second Sight Vol. 1 & 2"". There's only four episodes total, but they are each two parts due to the length.  I was sorry to see them end!",1169078400,17,1527,5.007905138339921
1466539,5,B00005JHCG,"Have only watched the first two episodes so far, but am greatly enjoying the show.  It is alot of fun and I enjoy seeing some recognizable British actors with smaller parts.

1466540,5,B00005JHCG,"If you are looking for a completely logical, no-loose-ends mystery, this will not work. But if you are looking for a psychological mystery this is engrossing and rings true. Anyone who has ever been to a doctor's office and gotten news that will change your life for the worse, and then has to learn to accept it will appreciate the development of this character over the course of the series. While each episode stands alone, it is the series as a whole that really makes these mysteries different from most. Tanner's blindness is not a ""gimmick"" it is a real catalyst for change in his thinking. Clive Owen is really outstanding, and I love Claire Skinner as DI Tully. She is a very delicate looking person, whose character is really very tough, smart, somewhat standoffish, yet also deeply compassionate. I might add that the initial visit to the doctor who drops the bad news on Tanner was absolutely typical of the experience of being with a doctor who is a coward when it comes to dealing with his patients.",1168041600,14,1013,4.664804469273743
1466541,5,B00005JHCG,I simply adored Clive as a TV Det...this whole series was wonderful all because of him. Every story line was well thought out and the journey we take along with him as he loses his eye sight is sweet and tragic. I sure would have helped him! I also bought the entire series!!!!,1164153600,7,277,4.245283018867925
1466586,5,B00005JHCG,"Why is it that British TV can be sooo grand at times? I rushed out to buy Second Sight after catching a glimps of the series on a public TV chanel. What is right about it? Everything: original plot, charismatic lead (I am not a fan of Clive Owen's, EXCEPT in this performance), well chosen supporting cast, quality production. You yearn for another installment of the series, though with Clive Owen gaining popularity in the US, that does not seem likely (can he take a lesson from Sean Bean, who did not forget his roots, and recently returned, for a brief moment, to the TV series ""Sharpe"" that had ""made him""?). There is nothing on American TV that compares well to the sofistication of this product. Buy it, watch it, share it!",1159920000,8,731,4.545454545454546
1466587,5,B00005JHCG,"This is a two part mystery show.  Clive is head of the investigation of a murder.  He is losing his sight and has to depend on his female partner to help him solve the crime.

He does not want to have to depend on her for anything but as his sight fails he is forced to depend on her as she leads him around trying to not have anyone notice that he is going blind.

Clive is fantastic in almost every movie that he makes and this is no exception. He has such charisma and personality and good looks.  He is one of my favorite actors.

This is well worth watching more than once.

1466588,5,B00005JHCG,"All of the good things have been said:  nuanced performance by Clive Owen and Claire Skinner, riveting mystery, charismatic and now rising star in USA, interesting rhythm and plot, similar tenor to Prime Suspect.  I would add that it is ophthalmologically correct.  I transcribed over 10,000 ophthalmic visit letters and never came up with AZOOR because I did minimal retinology.  Found it in the Ophthalmic dictionary.  These writers got one over on me.",1139097600,3,454,5.164383561643835

1466591,5,B00005JHCG,"This is a remarkable series, richly dramatic and with one of those ""twists"" that lends an added element to each of the stories.  Clive Owen's is powerful character as Ross Tanner, a hard drinking, hard boiled detective with a knack for solving some of the most difficult crimes.  Unfortunately, he's cursed with a rare disorder causing him to go permanently blind.  We watch Tanner's painful struggle as he attempts to keep this news to himself, relying ever higher on his other senses compensating for his loss of vision.  He keeps everyone at bay, including his ex-wife and partners.  Eventually, of course, those closest to him are onto the situation but everyone plays along as best they can - at least for as long as they can.

Owen's is one of those ""must see"" performances and he makes Tanner a character both irascible and likeable - not an easy accomplishment.

The mysteries of the crimes are fairly standard British ""Mystery"" which means they are always a notch or two above American crime dramas.  In addition to the mystery aspect, we get to know and like (or loathe) a number of fascinating characters that make up the cast.

Second Sight is a worthy series that didn't get enough attention Stateside, but makes for some highly watchable television.",1106870400,40,1263,4.837209302325581
1466592,2,B00005JHCG,"There is something about this guy I cannot put my finger on.  He is not as pretty as Ewan McGregor or Jude Law but definitely more versatile than both combined.  From Croupier to I'll Sleep When I'm Dead, he looks different in each role.  Some of his characters are more repulsive than attractive, but still he never lost my interest.",1092873600,4,334,4.533333333333333

I didn't know what day it played, or at first what channel it was on, so I found myself staying up, flipping channels to find it.  After that I realized it might be better to use the TV Guide.  This is a wonderful show.  It's star is arresting, both vulnerable and strong at the same time.  I try to avoid watching anything that doesn't catch my creative eye, and this did, completely.  Such a show you would normally assume to be firmly within the usual ""detective show"" genre.  It wasn't.  It was wonderful.  Creative, imaginative, touching and appealing.  Beginning to end it was awesome.",1085097600,16,648,4.461538461538462
1466594,4,B00005JHCG,"This is an outstanding detective story, combining very contemporary elements with the taut, unrelenting pacing that traditionally characterizes the best British mysteries. Clive Owens' performance is superb, and shows unmistakably his potential for far meatier roles: Gosford Park finally gave him a major vehicle, but he could do even more. Claire Skinner is beautifully matched with him, and their dramatic interplay allows them to develop as real personalities, not just puppets to move the plot along. It would be good to see them together again.",1043280000,4,550,5.482352941176471

7939510,2,B00005JHCG,"2/19/18 - I like Clive Owens' acting, so I thought this would be good.  No one's acting is bad here, but there is no story, really.  We just keep seeing blurred scenes and watch him smoke.  In one scene is on the roof his building, drinking and smoking and decides to dance on the ledge.  Is this a policy story or a documentary on macular degeneration?  How many episodes does it take for him to come to terms with his condition?  If he is so smart that he is in charge of 20 people, he shouldn't be running around hiding the inevitable - he should have the gumption to face up to things.

On the other hand, the tricky photography was not only annoying to watch but muddied up the stories.  I was grateful that they ended the series with a proper conclusion and didn't just drop the story.  I found the cases interesting and not obvious, at least not to me.
