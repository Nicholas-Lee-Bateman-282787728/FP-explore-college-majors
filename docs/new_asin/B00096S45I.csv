2268256,5,B00096S45I,"I may be somewhat biased in my review, having a husband in Iraq. I know that I saw the trailers and looked so forward to it, I marked it on my calendar. My friend and I, who both have husbands in Iraq, were curious to see the day to day happenings.

The things they don't feel the need to discuss with us, because to them it isn't news. I figured if my husband won't tell me I might find it in this movie.

I am sure I caught a glimpse of the macabre humor that he and I have always shared. If you joke about it enough you can get through it. If you are looking for Platoon, this is not the film for you. If you are looking for uncomfortable reality, this is it. This isn't Hollywood, and that was my favorite thing about it. There is no message, there is no happy ending. Tom Hanks doesn't die in the end or walk off into the sunset. It doesn't really end. It goes on still. There is no neat and tidy tie up at the end when all the subplots come together. This is Life. This is reality for countless men and women. This is not eating bugs or jumping a car off a ramp, this is the real Fear Factor. See how they deal with it. See the look in their eyes.

I loved every minute of it. I loved it's humor and it's stark reality. Mostly I loved Wilf.",1118275200,36,1246,3.9365079365079363

Mike Tucker gives us a glimpse into the reality of life--and death--as it is for our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters, our friends and lovers...the next generation of PTSD survivors...if they survive.

The film doesn't take a ""position"" on ""the war,"" but the only position possible is starkly evident in the faces and voices of these young people sent off to die for a cause beyond their comprehension.

Low-budget, plain and simple, a troubling look at troubling times.  See it.",1113955200,17,768,4.930232558139535
2268259,5,B00096S45I,"I have seen Gunner Palace and must admit that prior to seeing this movie I had not given much thought to the war in Iraq.

When I saw Gunner Palace, I tried to view the movie as a major Hollywood production and maintain distance from the ""actors"". Somewhere in the middle of the movie, I realized that the director, Michael Tucker, was holding the camera, riding with the troops and putting his own life at risk to show people like me, safe in the US, safe in our jobs what our employees and neighbors were experiencing in Iraq.

When the director shared with us the death of Ben Colgan, this hit home and I was jolted back to the reality that these young men and women are not actors. I appreciate that Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein had the courage to show us the reality of this war. Gunner Palace gives us permission to talk about our own fears and axieties about this war without being told what to think.  Our soldiers deserve our support as I am sure they would support people viewing and buying this movie.

Congratulations to the Directors (Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein) for having the courage to create this movie.",1113955200,19,1134,4.517073170731707
2268260,5,B00096S45I,"I have seen Gunner Palace twice. Each time a different experience. It's a stunning film, you really feel the grit and heat of the sand. You feel the tension of a war that fights an unseen enemy. As the troops go from house to house in the dead of night looking for insurgents, you feel the tension the fear. I wonder how scared the women and children must be?  How would I feel standing in my jammies looking down the barrel of a gun pointed at me, with men yelling at me in a strange language? How scared would I be if I were a soldier riding in an open truck? What the terror must feel like day to day, not knowing if today is your last day alive, away from your loved ones. The sad result of war is a lot of damaged human beings on both sides of it. This is not a film made by a big corporate film company. This is one guy who cared enough about what is really going on in Iraq to risk his life and show us. To show us the dirt, the grit, the boredom and the non hollywood version of this kind of war.  War is not pretty, not romantic  and certainly not fun! Through his lens we get to walk a mile in the shoes of our young women and men risking their lives every day in Irag.

2268261,5,B00096S45I,"Viewing Gunner Palace was a powerful experience for me. I feel it gave me an understanding of the reality of this war that I haven't gotten from any other source, certainly not from the news. I came away with a deepened appreciation of what is required of our soldiers - we ask much more of them than most realize. Although I oppose the war and the way it was sold to us, I honor those who are willing to sacrifice so much on our behalf. And I honor Michael Tucker's courage and commitment that allowed him to make this film.",1113955200,6,525,4.26

I was surprised to find delightful warm spots in the film as well as moments when you see the impact on local Iraqis and children. The film is so real and immediate that I felt I was there. It is important for those of us who do not serve to bear witness to those who do. The country is still at war but the story has left the front page.

2268267,1,B00096S45I,"I found it a waste of money. It tries to be like a modern day ""Apocalypse Now"" and it falls way short. The narration needs to be louder for starters. The black soldiers cant say anything unless they are rapping to some made up ""song"" (all the time). That gets annoying - real fast.

2268268,3,B00096S45I,"It's valuable to ""experience"" the war via video like this.
However it's apparent that the final goal of the filmmakers is against America's efforts in Iraq and not responsible to the sacrifices made. The final words are from the very young soldiers, basically crying that ""nothing good ever came from someone being killed"", which is just not true, unless you are completely naive and ignorant of reality and history.
So it's unfortunate that this movie has been tainted by the Liberal Agenda.
I prefer ""Lima Company"" , ""Restrepo"", and ""Generation Kill"".
Of course, serving in a military situation is not pleasant and war is always messed up.
That is the nature of war. However, the USA sacrifices innumerable soldiers just to protect possible civilian injury or ""collateral damage"". There are liberal whackjobs who sit around crying about Hiroshima, but guess what!?
The freedom that they squander was paid for by the lives of soldiers fighting wars very similar to the one in Iraq. It's fought for a reason.
It's America's war and if they can't hack it, they ought to move to the Sudan and start kissing up to an imam.",1295740800,,1119,4.863874345549738

2268270,4,B00096S45I,"War has been described as ""hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror"" but nothing much happens in this documentary.  I assume the producer had only limited time, maybe 3-4 days, to shadow the troops he was filming and during that time, essentially, nothing happened.  The titles on-screen tell us that a couple weeks later so-and-so was killed, and across town an IED exploded, but on-camera all we get is the daily routine of these fresh-faced high-school kids, 19- and 20-years old, going out on patrols in their Humvees.

During the day they're holed up in Uday Hussein's old palace (not a very good image for U.S. troops), while at night they careen through Baghdad streets blasting ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" from the stereo (a la ""Apocalypse Now"" - even worse publicity).  They raid the homes of suspected ""bad guys"" (from what intelligence we're not told, but their raids mostly come up empty), banging down doors in the dead of night and shouting incoherent instructions in English to the terrified families in their beds.  Meanwhile Donald Rumsfeld drones on and on in radio broadcasts about progress being made in ""winning the war.""

we see all the daily aspects of life for the soldiers currently in Iraq. Be it relaxing in one of Saddam's former palaces' pool, interacting with the local Iraqi citizens, to going on a nighttime raid for suspected terrorists. A viewer experiences for 90 minutes the horror, satisfaction, courage, confusion, grievance & uneasiness that our men and women in uniform confront everyday in Iraq and similarly in combat areas throughout the world. Regularly omitted from the nightly newscasts, the interviews featured in the film provide insight and reflection from the common soldier serving his/her country in War on Terror. Well worth the money and your time, ""Gunner Palace"" captures on film the drama and turmoil our soldiers struggle with and endure during combat in defense of his/her country.

With so much emphasis on debating the US's role and direction to take in Iraq, it is invaluable the average citizen can witness what really is and has been transpiring behind the jargon and political spin.

Despite what aspirations of aversions of war in general the filmmakers had originally intended to convey, the film really brings to the viewer a sense of profound appreciation for the job our troops are doing.",1180224000,,1299,5.122641509433962

Seeing these guys on film was just like seeing them again in the desert.  My Military Police platoon and I worked with these men for about two and a half months (June to mid-August) being their laison for evidence custody and apprehensions.  What we all did in terms of rapping, singing and playing guitars was a way for us to keep some sort of normalcy that were were used to having in a country that wanted us there at first and then wanted us out quickly.  What you saw on DVD is what happened on a day to day basis.  There was no embellishing of the soldiers; no one acted any different in front of the camera.  The soldiers of the 2/3 FA are the real deal.

2268280,5,B00096S45I,"You want to know what's going on in Iraq? What the soldiers' feelings are about being over there doing what they're doing? The only way to truely know is to go there and experience it yourself. To truely put it into words or even onscreen I think isn't possible. Every soldier is going to have a different opinion about being there and doing what he's doing which I don't think they can even share with someone else who hasn't been there. It is very difficult. Listen to the raps. Those are ways of expressing how they feel about being there. It's an outlet for them like writing in a journal for some people. They aren't just in the movie because the director likes rap. I really enjoyed this documentary and can relate to a lot of it even though I haven't been there yet myself. I hope to catch one of the next tours over even if I have to volunteer to find out for myself what it truely is and what it is all about to be there.

2268281,5,B00096S45I,"This is truly a great, entertaining documentary of what's going on in Iraq from the point of view of the American Soldier.  It follows several soldiers from the 2/3 Field Artillery, or ""The Gunners"", including the ever entertaining Spc. Stuart Wilf, on their exploits in Baghdad while staying in one of Saddam Hussein's palaces.  Between night raids, morter attacks, avoiding IEDs, and taking an ocasional dip in Sadam's private pool or a put or two on his private green, you get the real, seldom cut, and exciting story of Iraq first hand from the troops.

2268285,4,B00096S45I,"I think this is a good film for anyone trying to understand what life is like for a soldier in Iraq.  They did the best job they could, showing what they could, about every day life.  I know this because I lived it for a year.",1140566400,3,226,3.891304347826087
2268286,1,B00096S45I,"Let me preface my comments by saying that I'm a liberal who supported the idea of the war - in the Thomas Friedman sense that I hoped forging a stable democracy in the Middle East would serve as a tipping point for other autocratic regimes in the region.  Of course, I also expected that someone in this lousy administration had thought about who was going to keep things under control after the fall of Baghdad.  I was certainly wrong on the latter.  I think our soldiers are in a bad spot now and I don't pretend to know what the right answer is to get us out of this morass.

I saw Gunner Palace when it first came out in NYC, so it's not that fresh in my mind.  That said, I do vividly remember the disappointment I felt when I walked out of the the theater.  I felt this was a completely wasted opportunity by the filmmaker.  I was interested to see the film because I had just seen the extraordinary Frontline (PBS) piece, ""A Company of Soldiers"", which followed 8th Cav's Dog Company.  That piece was absolutely fascinating - managing to be honest about the devastating impact of the war on Iraqis while showing an appropriate level of sensitivity to the sometimes brutal, often surprisingly compassionate American soldiers who are struggling with grim doubts about their mission and uncertaintly about our goals in Iraq as their friends die around them.  I highly recommend watching it, even online at PBS.org if you can't find it on DVD (Amazon doesn't appear to have it).

This film, on the other hand, is trash.  The DVD cover says it all - this is a trite and cynical depiction of the guys in Iraq as a bunch of listless teenage misfits.  So much of the film takes place in this microcosm of a palace compound - where staving off boredom punctuated by mortar attacks seems to be the biggest concern.  I'd imagine that significantly increases the amount of stupid things these guys (and girls) do.  I have no doubt that a good amount of the soldiers over there are idiots and jerks - having a uniform and a gun doesn't make you smart or compassionate in my experience.  But showing these guys in this context is a total ploy to make out Americans as cartoonish buffoons.  Viewed in isolation, the film begs the question, as I'm sure the filmmaker intended, ""who have we sent to Iraq and why did we expect these idiots to get the job done, especially without pissing off the Iraqis?""

I didn't have as much problem with the rap as some other reviewers.  But I felt those scenes, which could have been used to speak about class and race issues in the military, instead focused on the disconnect between these soldiers and their environment.  While the dominant theme of the movie was to show the dichotomy between what went on within those palace walls and the chaos outside, I saw so little of the outside that the whole thing just seemed like a documentary of a freestyle rap club/frat party.

The other significant impression I took from the film was the level of the filmmaker's narcissism.  This guy seemed obsessed with showing how much in touch with everyone he was and how important he was to the story, alternating between friendship and contempt for the subjects of the film.  His self-serving narrative and the interlude with his family in Germany were designed, in my opinion, to provide a counterpoint between him, a ""compassionate"" journalist (""see how I suffer to tell their story?"") truly ""risking"" something in Iraq (""see my poor wife and kid?""), with most of the 19-year old soldiers he focused on, who had no greater goals than getting out of the country and no family counting on them to come home with a paycheck.

To wrap up my rant, rent it if you must, but don't buy this junk.  Its a lousy, dishonest movie.",1139097600,11,3741,4.574212893553224

2268288,5,B00096S45I,"Yes, this is styled as a documentry but it was done in such a way that keeps your interest.  I had heard of troops living in a palace and other Iraqi buildings but it was awesome to actually see such a place as the palace they were staying in.  I liked how the journalist let you get to know some of the individuals, US military and also Iraqis.

This journalist obviously got close to many of the individuals.  I came to the conclusion that he had a good friendship with Wilf.  Wilf's a character.  I think most of us know someone like Wilf.  I do but he was in the Marines.  It was great that Wilf learned to play the Star Spangled Banner on his electric guitar.  However, I could have done with a little less of his playing after a while.

Definately check out the extras on the DVD.  Oh, and the website is a great companion to the movie.  Take the time to read it too.  The diary goes into some extra depth that was left out of the movie.

I agree that this movie should have been rated R.  Obviously they're in a war zone so there's danger, killing, injuries, etc.  Most of the troops are very young (17 to mid 20's) and male so the F bomb was dropped A LOT.  However, with that in mind, I would suggest this for anyone that is considering going into the military.  I would even suggest it for younger teens that are curious about military life in a combat zone.  I have never been in the military but I think that this movie has to be a little more realistic than many of the war movies that are out, even if they are based on true stories.

""Gunner's Palace"" is more a playground for aspiring rappers than a look at the battlefield and is dearly in need of a focus and some scissor action in the editing room - CNN coverage is more interesting. In sporadic instances, a soldier divulges something profound, as if it was an accident, like a monkey at a keyboard accidentally pecking out lines from Shakespeare.

The people in this movie seem to be very comfortable with incessant complaining and conceiving of the soldier as basically a new victim group who should have his or her share of the general liberal whining.  No, I'm not in the military, I'm not a congressman or POTUS or FLOTUS but if you are able to stand around in front of a camera complaining about poor you then life isn't all that bad.  However the black soldiers seem to have invented a new style of rap: whining victim rap.  The combat's so heavy that they've got time to sit around carefully crafting their grievance lyrics.

2268292,5,B00096S45I,"If you believe the media, you would think that US troops are stormtroopers who torture everybody and shoot prisoners.  Gunner Palace does a great job of countering the near-daily slander of service personnel overseas by providing an unbiased, unvarnished slice of their lives.  The documentary isn't a puff-piece or rah-rah propaganda.  The film operates by letting the soldiers be themselves and express themselves as they see fit. What emerges is a glimpse of the unique and diverse individuals who comprise the Gunners, all attempting to survive and perform their mission.  This diversity of character is the most striking and refreshing aspect of the film.  The Gunners come from every background -- economic, racial, ethnic, geographic -- and yet, through shared experience, have learned to get along.  Not ""get along"" in the sense of a politically-correct, multi-culti ""celebration of differences"", but in the real sense of men and women in mortal danger with a job to do.

In addition to facing anonymous gunfire, IED's, language barriers, double-loyalties among ""informants"", the soldiers must contend with misperceptions back home.  The soldiers see themselves portrayed on CNN and in Time, which fuels a sense of isolation and disconnect from the nation they serve.

Gunner Palace is at once deadly serious and at the same time often very funny.  The soldiers ham it up for the cameras and don't shy away from needling each other or, for that matter, Donald Rumsfeld and the military.  It is these daily, ""un-newsworthy"" interactions that evoke, above-all, the human face of military life in Iraq.",1133222400,3,1607,5.23828125
2268293,4,B00096S45I,"""Gunner Palace"" is a documentary by Michael Tucker which attempts to show the reality of life in Iraq from the perspective of the soldiers of the 2/3 Field Artillery unit. They live in the bombed out palace of Saddam's spoiled son, Uday, and experience fear and laughter, exhiliration and boredom, as they go about their daily lives as troops.

I think it's interesting that there have been many both  positive and negative reviews of the film by soldiers currently stationed in Iraq. I say this because I believe the soldiers portrayed in this movie, with a few exceptions, come across as very confused and immature young men who really have no sense of purpose about being in Iraq and are mostly just anxious to return home as soon as possible. Most of the soldiers are very honest about the fact that they are there only out of financial necessity or a misguided search for adventure. Even the ones who joined the military out of patriotism seem thoroughly disillusioned about the war itself and the fact that most Iraqs see them as invaders rather than defenders. I have no idea what Tucker's motives were for making this film. But it is definitely more effective as an anti-war movie than the clearly biased ""Farenheit 9/11"" ever was.

Even more disturbed by the soldier's behavior was my wife, who grew up in the country of Ecuador. She is not really a politically-minded person. But I think what provoked her strong reaction was the mistreatment of certain Iraqs by some of the soldiers. Iraq is a totally different culture than Ecuador and is also a United States ally. But she didn't like seeing the bullying of other brown-skinned people, ""abuse of power"" is what she kept yelling at the screen. This is perhaps also due to the long history of U.S. military intervention in Latin America and our support for numerous corrupt and murderous dictators there such as Augusto Pinochet in Chile and the Somoza family in Nicaragua.

Overall, I think this movie does a decent job of conveying what is really going on in Iraq. But I might not be too happy about its portrayal of the soldiers if I was in the military myself.",1132963200,2,2125,4.704301075268817

2268295,3,B00096S45I,"GUNNER PALACE is a good look at soldiering in Iraq. But it's not a great documentary.

Since I'm an optomist, though, I'll start with the positives of the film ...

GUNNER PALACE is a startling look inside the Iraq war. But it's not told from the documentary maker's standpoint; it's told from the men and women who are there, everyday, fighting to just stay alive and, sometimes, fighting off boredom.

Music permeates the film as Vietnam era songs (FLIGHT OF THE VALKYRIE, etc.) mix with rap songs performed and created by the soldiers themselves. It's as if there's a connection being made between that lost war of the 60s and 70s and that which our young fighters are going through in the deserts and city streets of Iraq. I found this intriguing and pretty insightful into the minds of our Armed Forces.

Contrary to some other reviewers here, I found that the documentary maker (Mike Tucker) DID ask pertinent questions (""Do you feel you're doing a good job?"" ""What do you think the people back home think about what you're doing over here?"" etc.) These are excellent questions to ask and allows the viewer a peek into the soldiers' minds.

I could also feel some of the tension the men and women go through as they describe cringing at a piece of trash alongside the road, wondering if its an IED (Improvised Explosive Device) waiting to destroy their vehicle as they pass.

Where the documentary fell apart a bit was the overall flow of the story. There isn't one. The herky-jerky movement from place to place and person to person allowed for minimal immersion into various aspects of the war and these soldiers' experiences. Although some of this information came across, it should've been in a much smoother fashion.

Let me end this review by saying that I respect what our Armed Forces are doing in Iraq. Although I don't agree with our current U.S. government administration and how this war came to be, I'm humbled by how dedicated our young men and women soldiers are ""over there.""",1132358400,,1996,4.718390804597701

""While Gunner Palace is a good documentary of the 1st Armored Division's ""Gunners"", it ignores nearly all of the negative aspects of their deployment. For instance, the ""gunners"" did not capture that sector of Aadhamiya they patrolled: the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force did, and then turned it over to 101st Airborne, and then to the Florida Army National Guard's Warrior battalion (who can be heard on the radio throughout the movie).

I was stationed less than 500 meters away from Gunner Main, as we called it. They were by far the most screwed up unit in the entire first armored division. The documentary fails to mention the 25 minute long firefight that 1-36 IN, also stationed at Gunner Main, had.........with themselves. It was all friendly fire.

It also fails to mention that the Gunner's on guard duty, shot up our sniper teams from Warrior Battalion, nearly every day, because the gunner's were untrained and unskilled in their professions. They were engineers, and should have stuck doing engineer jobs.

The documentary fails to mention any of this. What it DOES do though, is give a great sense of what Aadhamiya was like. You graphically see the discrepancies between Uday and Qusay's palaces, and the slums around the soccer stadium and on River Road. You get a great idea of what the streets were like, how the people reacted, and such. I saw many familiar faces from the streets of Maghrib and Aadhamiya, in Baghdad. So yes, while it's overly preachy towards the troops, and covers their blemishes, it's definately a good documentary....for what it's worth.""

OK first off, this guy is a clown.... I never knew of a movie in which negative aspects are part of a movie. CLOWN!! for 1 the movie was designed to show the people of the civilian world ...That MICHAEL MOORE does not know what he was talking about, Michael Tucker made it evident that the war needed to be expressed by the Soldiers and not the anti-war CLOWNS OF TH US.

 2ND, 1-36 was never stationed at ""GUNNER MAIN"", they were almost 10 to 15 miles down to the west end of SLAYK, thats over by the WATER PLANT that myself and the rest of AZTEC 2/3 FA secured.

 3rd, watch the DOCUMENTARY before you label our MOS, WE are Artillerymen not Engineers.

You say you were 500 meters from the Palace, WHERE? because 500 meters would have made that in the same hood that we lost two soldiers at, where you all doing your jobs or too busy worried about ours?

ANYWAYS, this Documentary is what it is, BY US, FOR US,

THANK YOU MICHAEL TUCKER",1129248000,13,2608,4.682713347921226
2268307,4,B00096S45I,"Before I get into the review, I just gotta point out that the music in the film has become an issue by other reviewers, that the RAP MUSIC is not appropriate for the film. Did it not occur to the reviewers who had issue to this that the RAP MUSIC is original stuff from soldiers featured in the documentary? (You can see some of them perform it for you on camera. It isn't P-Diddy or Snoop Dogg or Dr. Dre...Its our own US Troops!) I'd say its appropriate enough, wouldn't you? Yes, they curse and use the N word, but i'd say they have the right to say whatever they want, wouldn't you? Or is it that those people don't like RAP MUSIC for whatever reason? (The guitar music heard in the film was also played by one of the troops, SPC Wilf to be exact.)

Anyways, I agree with other reviewers that it could've been better, the film didn't really flow and was somewhat disorganized, that being the fault of the director.  But otherwise, we get to see what this particular unit goes through for a couple of months, which is something you don't see on CNN. You get insight on what the soldiers are feeling and going through.  They show the interaction with some of the pro-US Iraqis helping catch insurgents. It then resembles a COPS episode when they investigate possible insurgent houses and weapons caches. And I'm glad there was minimal combat seen on the film, as some reviewers were disappointed with. I know its going on over there on a daily basis, but i don't enjoy seeing footage of our troops getting killed.

I especially liked the part when they pointed out the customized armor on one of their Humvees, showing that the soldier that brought up that point to Rumsfeld a while back really wasn't BS like some White House reps have pointed out.  This is not a political film, pro-war or anti-war, although some of the soldiers interviewed don't believe in the war.  Overall, a very good documentary.  And people, don't judge it for its music, especially the RAP MUSIC.",1127692800,9,1975,4.530898876404494
2268308,4,B00096S45I,"I don't necessarily see this as a political movie, but more as a look at the surreal life of soldiers.  Surreal because those of us that haven't been in the military and haven't had to live with imminent violence from all directions don't always comprehend what it must be like.  Gunner Palace gives a dramatic and respectful look into that world.

The soldiers tell you about life in post-Sadaam Iraq, how they cope with dark humor and raps while being face with IEDs (improvised explosive devices), RPGs (rocket propelled grenades), mortar rounds and untold other threats day after day, week after week.  The language is raw and uncensored, possibly offensive to some, but given the context it's natural.  In fact, with most of the actual violence and blood occurring off camera, the language is the harshest part of the film.  These are young men and women living in an alien world, trying to do the job they've been assigned and make the best of it.

It's not exactly recruiting film stuff, but then again this film does nothing to dishonor the soldiers either.  It portrays them as professionals that cope with a very difficult assignment.  It's an assignment that will take some of the lives of them, a reality that adds considerable poignancy to the conversations captured on film.

The troops that the filmmakers worked with are/were quartered in a palace built and decorated by Sadaam's son Uday.  Supposedly this was one of the places where he hosted his wild parties, that gives a kernel of truth to the rather titillating references to it being a ""pleasure palace"" in promotional pieces and some reviews.  There is a pool though, and somehow some of the soldiers managed to bring along some musical instruments that lighten the mood at times.

Overall, it's a good film, that provides a healthy dose of reality for both the right and the left.",1126828800,8,1855,4.813880126182966

It is honest and candid and plays like a home movie.  You feel what these men are going through day in and day out without even a hint of Mr Tuckers personal views and opinions. I laughed until I cried and I cried until my eyes stung... To see our young soliders over there smiling and laughing amist what is going on all around them gave me a HUGE sense of relief...

2268314,5,B00096S45I,"I found this documentary poignant and deserving of much wider audience than its rather limited distribution received. It's an effort to fill a void of missing coverage of what is happening in Iraq -- the lack of ground reporting by mainstream media, or the otherwise 'embedded' style of journalism which fuels complicity in the political arena.

Unlike Farhenheit 911 the filmmaker has indeed steered clear of imbuing the narrative with politcal judgment, (perhaps as the previous commentator says with too much restraint) -- but still I found it admirable as a portrait of combat soldiers in the field, and it's easy enough to identify with, cringe at, or hold contempt for the subjects. Simply they are young men and women on a mission -- I was surprised at how most are just kids, for better or worse -- some appear to be mature, enlightened and professional, others aren't.  You get a sense of their plight and danger, and the bizarre existence they have to face each day. Since a disproportiately high percentage of the enlisted personnel come from minority backgrounds I felt the inclusion of the hip-hop poetry was entirely appropriate and compelling -- you hear them describe their situation in their own words. What they all seem to have in common is that none want to be there.

I recommend not only watching this film but discussing with others, no matter what their politcal view.",1124928000,4,1392,4.889830508474576

Fort Bragg, home of the 82nd Airborne Division and the Army Special Operations Command, is right down the road.  It is interesting to note that a few members of the audience appeared in the film.  I think the director did a great job of portraying the day to day experiences of that particular unit.  Obviously you can't tell everyone's story in a a 90 minute documentary, and that's really not what you should strive to do.  Mr. Tucker picked one group of soldiers and chose to tell their story.  I like the minimal use of narration, and the ""cinema vere te'"" (or however it's spelled) feel of this film.

I think what the filmmakers have tried to do is to bring a slice of life from Iraq. snapshots. Simply, they wanted to show us what the day to day life of a soldier is like rather than trying to build a false narrative.

What we see are the daily life and operations of a unit over a two month period. By itself, that is a worthwhile document, for now and for the future.

I must strongly object to the reviewers on this page who claim that this unit had it easy. I checked around and they lost 4 people and took at least 60 wounded. More, they spent 420 days in Iraq (as did many elements of the 1st Armored Division) and fought in both Baghdad and Najaf.

But...

As a documentary, this is pretty lame stuff. In an effort to remain politically neutral (at least, I'm guessing that's the reason...) the director refrains from saying anything at all, or from letting the soldiers say anything at all, that has any real bearing on the situation they're in. There's no context, in other words. There's no discussion of why they're in Iraq, if they're succeeding in their goals or not, what they suppose those goals to be, how they feel about being there, etc. Instead, we get a lot of footage of soldiers jumping into the swimming pool, goofing around in their off-hours, and doing raps.  Lots and lots of raps.

I'm guessing that the director is really interested in rapping. Either that, or the soldiers in Iraq really spend half their waking hours rapping to one another. Seems unlikely...

Beyond that, the chronology of the movie is confusing. About 2/3 through the film, the director leaves Iraq, with the expected cliches about ""I had mixed feelings about leaving... for me, home was only 10 hours away. For these guys, though, the war would continue."" and so on... he goes home... we see footage of his kitchen as he makes some tea (?), footage of his daughter holding a sparkler (???), and he dramatically reads aloud an email about one of the soldiers being killed shortly after he left Iraq.

So, you'd think that would be the end of the movie.

But, no. Instead, it goes on from there. So, my question is, if he's gone home... who's filming the documentary???  Why is it still going on? Shouldn't the movie have ended with him leaving Iraq???

My final criticism is that we never really get to know any of the soldiers, which should have been one of the main objectives of this documentary. Sure, we get to see them goof around a lot, but again there's no real depth to the thing. I don't know these people. I don't know how they really feel about being in Iraq.

About a dozen soldiers are followed and interviewed. The raids we see them make are usually useless - the target isn't home but they herd an old lady and little girl out of the house. Oops! They come off looking like a bunch of Keystone Cops making raids on old ladies. So in the time that the filmmaker was in Iraq, these ""raids"" are representative of the work the soldiers were doing? Or were the successful missions simply left on the cutting room floor?

The main character of this movie is SPC Stuart Wilf. Wilf is your basic cynical jerk. He's gotta make fun of or put down everything. You know the type of guy that you want with you in combat, on your team, or even in work? The kind of guy that's ""got your back""? The sort of guy that won't let you down? Well, that's NOT Wilf. He's the kind of guy you definitely don't want on your team. He's the complaining, selfish whiner. Look'n out for #1.

Granted some people might appreciate the artistic value of the camera man and director and all that, but this movie was made to show how war is to typical Americans, and now they have the wrong view.",1121990400,,638,4.213114754098361
2268355,1,B00096S45I,"After watching this movie I realized the only thing portrayed by this group of soldiers is their mealy mouthed approach to our government and foreign policy. More than once I had the impression that these soldiers hated their job and the army as well as the government they work for. Another reviewer ""Armycombatmedic"" said something about being shot at constantly and being under fire and duress. This movie showed nothing of the sort for this particular unit, instead they party by the pool all day long hitting on their ""desert queens"" with the occasional ride thru town to harrass the local populace. It trivializes everything that we are to accomplish in Iraq and shows a bunch of tough guys who probably got bullied in High School and now adopted the role of the antagonist, and ridicule and humiliate the locals for their own amusement. It gives the impression to everyone back home that we are not in real danger but rather have enough time to party poolside and act like morons while trying to rap like 50 cent or some other horrible so called musician. One soldier in particular Spc Wilfe totally butchers the National Anthem in his attempt to emulate Jimi Hendrix. It shows no aggression or any supposed acts of malice towards the soldiers which they complain about constantly. Dont get me wrong I'm not saying the soldiers over there aren't being attacked, but this movie certainly doesn't show that and begs the question ""Why are we involved"" and further emphasises the contempt directed upon the local population by the occupying force.

Now, for those of you who think I am some prickhead civilian sitting back in the states like a coward, bitching about the soldiers who give us our freedom... THINK AGAIN!!! I am a soldier in the United States Army, currently stationed in IRAQ! I am at Balad Airbase(Camp Anaconda) and the soldiers in this movie are exactly the kind of scum that we are embarassed to share the same uniform as. Most american soldier's are professionals of the highest sort.  For the producer's of this movie to use soldiers like this to portray america's finest citizen is a slap in the face to our nation. This movie creates more propoganda and anti-american sentiment than anything else. Just imagine these Iraqi's and Afghani's watching this movie, this would just make them more ticked off at us. Hell, they lob mortar's into my base every single day. After watching this movie they'll probobly start doubling their attacks. In essence, this movie put's me more in harms way. I watched this movie from Iraq,wearing the uniform and I was totally disgusted,embarrassed and ashamed of the image those soldiers conveyed.  This wasn't a movie portraying the ""real"" soldier, it portrayed a bunch of media hungry, glory hounds, posing for the camera, and using the 15 minutes of fame to land themselves a rap contract or someplace on MTV.",1121990400,10,2870,4.865030674846626

Obviously, Tarrant is not in the military, he is instead one of those losers who will barely contribute to society but with his mediocre job and movie reviews for the rest of his life.

I cannot believe I found a documentary of this niche: by the way, for any of you yet to realize... EVERY DOCUMENTARY EVER MADE is one-sided.  If ""Gunner Palace"" is indeed, one-sided, it has got to be the most neutral one-side presented with homespun grit and gumption.

Tucker and Epperlein are wise filmmakers.  Don't hold any pretense, just capture the action and any numbing bon mot these soldiers might harbor.  They get it all.  This film will make you nervous... it is balls-to-the-wall real.  From the guitar-thrashing Corporal to the GIs commending the unreal splendor of Burger King Whoppers, ""Gunner Palace"" illustrates anxious kids amongst a world of frightened men.  Not exactly the most stable or safest place to be.

They know this, and perform their nightly raids.  Targets alter between Number 89 on the Top 100 Terrorist List to random ramshackle outfits making homemade fertilizer bombs.  Every entry into a house is a will-they-or-won't-they of all returning to Gunner Palace safely.  ""GP"" tests your resolve, but above all, your nerves.

Tucker, in my opinion, is a gifted cameraman, only capturing inherent action and never instigating any.  Fly on the wall, baby, fly on the wall.  It's photographed HD Digital, yet still traps you in the confines of Fallujah and Baghdad like only 35mm could.  Their enemies disappear in the street crowds, some as young as 6 years old.  And unless they keep their eyes on them, they get stoned... or worse, grenaded.  The camera itself has many close calls.

No better way to recommend it than to watch it, absorb it, love it.  This is documentary filmmaking at its bravest and most dangerous.  Recommended to anyone thinking they have all the answers on Iraq.  Watch this, and a fount of questions will arise.

Curious for ACTUAL DATA about Iraq, people?  Tired of Murdoch's lies, and Jennings' self-debasement?  ""Gunner Palace"" is what's really happening.  You will NEVER see this coverage on American television, folks.  In this case, 85 minutes is a lifetime.

I guarantee you will never look at a discarded plastic bag the same way again.",1121817600,3,2212,5.049861495844875

2268359,1,B00096S45I,"First off, everyone calling this a straight-up look at the war in Iraq, and no politics, and such, need to get real. Everyone that says that a portion of the proceeds go to soldiers families, grow up. If you aren't on the ground, then don't take someone elses word(SOMEONE WHO MAKES MONEY OFF OF SENSATIONALISM, OR IN THIS CASE, LACK THEREOF)for what is going on ""Over There"". I am on the ground, and this is a poor example of what is going on. This movie is horrible. It is a hap-hazard thoughtless video diary which jumps around.
It is not thought provoking as was 9-11; it is just bad. With the poor narrating(he is a purposefully monotone Ted Koppel), explaining something that you just saw, it plays more like a rough resume for a news corp--more of a ""look what i can do"", than anything worth reporting. There is no sensationalism, or shocking moments, or endearing moments. The director succeeds in making his subjects one dimensional turds who invade your living room more than anything else.
It is just another way that the bleeding heart liberal can cash in off of an ""unjust war"".
It is obvious that the 2/3 FA did not want the reporters presence/interference, so they roomed him with one of the planet's more inconsequential subjects in SPC Stuart Wilf(no doubt, the future star of some MTV programming, as he has everything that MTV requires from it's stars: unattractiveness, annoyance, and the absence of ability--unless you count the TERRIBLE attempt at guitar--2 words-- air guitar-please). This guy is the reason that the public doesn't care about it's soldiers--they pray for a war; to ship off their Wilf's, and all of those dreamers who think that they can rap. Which brings me to my next point: The utter lack of discipline and professionalism-- both qualities that service members are praised for-- are curiously absent. There was enough N-word references in this movie that you would think you were in a pickup basketball game with Rasheed Wallace, and Ron Artest. The rapping, which litters the shaky camera work and shoody presentation, is typical of (an) un-educated individual(s), big words used in the wrong context when a common word would do, and in many cases speeding up the rhythm to accomodate the syllables in their ten-dollar word to maintain tempo; idiotic political statements; and no attempt to speak the language of the oppressor. Basically, all of the rappers sounded like NAS with more talent, and more honesty, but none the less, just as un-inspiring. Here is one thing that I can say with absolute certainty about this movie: IT IS UN-INSPIRED, AND THE PRODUCER HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT HE WANTED TO CONVEY, OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT 2/3 FA IS NOT HARBORING ANY TALENTED ENTERTAINERS, AND VERY FEW CHROMOSOMALLY COMPLETE HUMAN BEINGS. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS.",1121472000,2,2797,4.853556485355648
2268360,5,B00096S45I,"""For y'all this is just a show, but we live in this movie."" -- Spc. Richmond Shaw, 1st Armored Division's 2nd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, in the film ""Gunner Palace.""

One of the great ironies of 21st century international politics is that personnel trained to wage war are more often forced to play peacekeeper. This paradox is brought to life in the documentary ""Gunner Palace,"" an uncensored, unflinching, unfiltered look at the daily lives of American combat soldiers in Iraq.

Filmmakers Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein went to Iraq twice, in late 2003 and early 2004, to follow soldiers from the 1st Armored Division's 2nd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment -- nick-named ""Gunners"" -- during operations in one of the most volatile sections of Baghdad. The soldiers' barracks is a bombed-out former pleasure palace of Uday Hussein that the new tenants christen Gunner Palace.

The film captures the unvarnished reality of the soldiers' existence as they go about their mission of bringing stability to ""post-war"" Iraq. It provides a candid look at their experiences, good and bad. It shows their bravado and their anxiety, their frustration and their determination, their grim sense of humor and their dark sense of isolation. It also shows their joy of being alive -- eight of them were killed during the two months of filming.

There is riveting footage of nighttime patrols and raids on houses harboring suspected terrorists. With adrenaline pumping, the soldiers break down doors and roust terrified Iraqis out of their beds. Too often they discover their targets are not home, and they go back to Gunner Palace empty-handed.

The soldiers' mission is multi-faceted, yet ill-defined. They mediate community meetings and visit orphaned children in the hospital. They patrol the streets in the daytime as children smile and wave at them one moment, then throw rocks at them the next. They warily approach an abandoned bag along a busy street, mindful of ""improvised explosive devices,"" as nearby Iraqis laugh at them. (The bag turns out to be empty.) They act as paramedics as they pick up a stoned street kid. They arrest fugitives and transport them for interrogation.

The Gunners work hard and play hard. They unwind with pool parties and golf matches. Several of the black soldiers decompress by snarling angry rap lyrics. Spc. Stuart Wilf, the regiment's clown prince, dresses in robes to imitate a mullah. He also plays a mean electric guitar.

These soldiers cuss like sailors. They are young, proud and confident, yet also scared and lonely; they are strangers in a strange land. They feel forgotten by their country and unappreciated by the Iraqis.

The film plays like a cross between ""M*A*S*H"" and ""Apocalypse Now,"" with a little bit of the TV show ""Cops"" thrown in for good measure. There are surreal moments such as a sergeant intent upon tracking down the rat that has invaded his bedroll, seemingly oblivious to the mortar rounds bombarding the compound. In another, the soldiers raid a crowded coffee shop one night in pursuit of insurgents. Everyone is ordered to stand up with hands on their heads. After the suspects are secured and escorted away, an officer apologizes to the remaining customers and thanks them for their cooperation. The customers then calmly sit down and resume their discussions as if nothing had happened.

The culture clash between the soldiers and the Iraqis is highlighted by one memorable sequence in which Wilf plays ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" on his guitar, Jimi Hendrix-style, while standing on the roof of the palace. He is silhouetted against the setting sun as an American helicopter patrols overhead; in the background, the voice of a muezzin can be heard over a loudspeaker, calling Muslims to the mosque for evening prayers.

I do question some of the filmmakers' choices. Is the use of Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" as a patrol prepares for a raid meant as a homage to ""Apocalyps Now,"" or to draw comparisons between the war in Iraq and Vietnam? In another scene, a soldier floating on an inner tube in Uday's pool recites an entire monologue from ""Full Metal Jacket""; it's inclusion is puzzling and unnecessary.

But overall ""Gunner Palace"" is frank and honest. It is eye-opening and thought-provoking. It has a rawness and immediacy that is captivating. It provides a view of the war the Pentagon probably doesn't want you to see, and one television news won't show you. It doesn't take sides, nor does it have a political agenda. It is not targeted toward the red states or the blue states, but rather to all 50, united states. It is funny, it is sad, it is real. It is a haunting, visceral experience that everyone should have.",1121212800,9,4718,4.997452229299363
2268361,5,B00096S45I,"Unlike many other docs, Gunner's Palace is unbiased so we get a fair and balanced view of the war. I really enjoyed the music, there were so many genres that the music really drew me in along with the footage.",1121126400,4,209,4.25
2268362,4,B00096S45I,"Michael Tucker's camera takes the viewer into a combat zone, exposing the paradoxical horror and boredom of war through the words and faces of combatants.

More than one reviewer notes that Tucker doesn't create a ""focused"" documentary, that the film doesn't evolve as a work of fiction might. They  imply that it might not capture and hold the attention of all viewers.

While I agree with this, I can't dismiss the way GUNNER PALACE honors the combatants of a war that has escaped the honest scrutiny of average Americans.

Except for understandable swings at our Secretary of Defense, the film maintains gravitas.  It offers searing images of the Iraqi people, the most jarring of which is that of a young girl rushing down the staircase of a safe house in her nightgown at gunpoint. I did not find it easy or convenient to dismiss such imagery, but couldn't turn it off either.

It is no accident Tucker focuses on the kindness, patience and compassion of many soldiers, reminding his audience that real people live beneath the body armor -- if they were fortune at have received it at all.

Tucker's combat rap segments are edgy and the lyrics potent and honest.
Music plays its role here as it always has in war movies, but it is less rebellious and more angry.

The film might have been more effective if the director had followed the lives of a just a few characters over time.  I wanted to know who these men were as the film progressed, but ended up knowing much less than I'd hoped.

All this aside, GUNNER PALACE is worth your attention.  My package also indicated that a portion of proceeds will benefit families of soldiers in need, so I was more than happy to buy a copy.

These are hard times, and much in America seems overly politicized and chaotic now. But few citizens will mourn the secrets and waste of this war more than those who risked everything to fight it.",1120521600,6,1884,4.607784431137724
2268363,5,B00096S45I,"They only started the war.  Why should they go out to fight, they leave that all to the poor.""  Good ole' Ozzy Osbourne with his sagacious self.  Yep, that's what happens over and over; the poor go fight, kill and die for the interests of the rich.  This seems to be the understated theme of ""Gunner Palace,"" an intimate portrait of the young men and women, mostly minorities, all from the working or underclass, who are trying to make sense of a senseless war.

One young soldier laments that he doesn't feel like he's protecting his country and that the country has not needed protection for quite sometime.  He follows orders, because that is what a soldier does.  But he is aware of the fact that he has been sent to war for a reason other than the only one that warrants such action, that reason being an imminent threat to the U.S.

Another soldier jokes about the sub-par equipment made available to him and to his fellows.  His buddies laugh hysterically but the point is clear.  They know they're being defecated upon.  They know that their government, specifically the present administration, has contempt for them and for the strata to which they belong.

Not one important person in the Bush administration went to Vietnam or has served in any other armed conflict; not Bush, not Cheney, not Rummy...Support the Troops.  You see the ribbons on the back of all the SUV's.  We all know what it really means: Support the War.  The same neo-cons who stomp all over minorities all the time and condemn the poor on principle, have co-opted the troops - a group which consists mostly of poor minorities.  Unbelievable.

A good portion of the film's soundtrack is provided by the young black inner-city kids fighting for Haliburton and its ilk in Iraq.  The streets of Baghdad are alive with angry hip hop.  They know what's up.  I hope America is starting to figure it out.",1120521600,6,1878,4.650455927051672
