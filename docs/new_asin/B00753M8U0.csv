5055337,5,B00753M8U0,I've always enjoyed these actors in what ever they appear in.  It is about a special bond that 2 people didn't realize they needed.,1365120000,3,131,4.458333333333333
5055338,2,B00753M8U0,"From Peter Pan to a bullied outcast, Jeremy Sumpter continues to show his tremendous versatility as an actor in Death & Cremation. This cast was the whole reason I wanted to see this movie, but unfortunately it falls well short of my expectations. Stanley (Brad Dourif) is a loner and a serial killer who runs the perfect business for getting rid of evidence, a crematorium. He's a lonely man and nothing exciting happens to him until a loner named Jared (Sumpter) starts working for him. This film tries very hard to be something it's not and that's creepy. Death & Cremation isn't about blood and gore, but rather moves very slowly and methodically in order to try and freak us out, but sadly it doesn't. Stanley and Jared aren't guys you're going to be scared of, more like two guys you'd like to hang out with and that's the problem. The audience can relate to them and isn't scared of them at all. That being the case this film should have gone the other way and been extremely bloody and disturbing, but it's not that either. The story is bland and the movie is slow, but the cast is amazing. Brad Dourif plays a psychopath better than anyone and it really wouldn't surprise me if he is in fact a serial killer. Here he's teamed with one of my absolute favorite actors, who is also superb, but they're giving their all in a slow, sloppy film, that just doesn't cut it.",1361491200,2,1374,4.47808764940239
5055339,5,B00753M8U0,"it was a great movie. shows how people should be more careful on who they talk back to. i liked Jeremy Sumpter the best. From Peter Pan to a role liek this, a true artist.",1349395200,6,171,3.914285714285714
5055340,5,B00753M8U0,"Creepy, disturbing, unsettling AND well done and nicely executed.  Worth the watch!  Didn't know much about it before I saw it but it was def worth giving it a try.  It's always nice when Amazon offers rentals at different price points.

5055341,3,B00753M8U0,"Dourif and Sumpter do a good job as the creepy cremation guy who kills and cremates for no particular reason and the young teenager who is bullied at school and needs a father figure, even one who is messed up.

There is no explanation for the crematorium-crazy guy or how his own rotten childhood sent him into this obsession.",1342742400,,327,4.5423728813559325
5055342,3,B00753M8U0,"A creative (meaning not done before, at least quite like this) story of a mistreated, humiliated-at-school goth/loner teen who wouldn't mind some payback upon his tormentors. His struggling, single mom requests that he acquires an after school job (when he bothers to go to school) which ends being with a lonely grizzled crossword puzzle solving cremator (my suspicions about crossword types is now confirmed) who doesn't take kindly to unkind people thus making good use of his skills which his newly hired help is only to willing to also acquire.

Nothing too bloody, just the usual red dyed corn syrup splattered in a non-forensically accurate manner. The acting by Dourif carries the movie, but then he has had decades to hone this particular portrayal given the number of horror and crime acting jobs he's had.",1342224000,,816,5.044444444444444
5055343,4,B00753M8U0,"""Death and Creamation"" is elevated by a wonderfully textured and low-key performance from Brad Dourif, an underrated character actor who probably should be allowed to lead more often.  He brings a nice understated sophistication to his role as a killer and humanizes a character that in a lesser genre film would have been filled by a cartoon monster.

This is not brilliant film-making by any stretch, and some of the smaller roles (especially those of the police detective and the bullies) were hammy and unprofessional.  But I was struck by the interesting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-and-Maude/dp/6305882592/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold and Maude</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apt-Pupil/dp/0767821599/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apt Pupil</a>&nbsp;vibe, and the way that the story was propelled by relationships and personalties rather than--as happens too often in horror--mere events.

I will even give ""Creamation"" credit for setting up a memorable final ""line,"" the answer to a crossword puzzle clue that fits beautifully.  I'm not sure I would feel that I'd gotten good value if I'd paid more than, say, $10 for this movie, but if you can rent or stream it, you might find it suprisingly diverting and engaging.",1341964800,4,1338,6.370165745856354

5055348,5,B00753M8U0,"Certainly murder is not the answer to solving problems with people that annoy or insult you, but frankly I did not feel one iota of sympathy for the victims who perished by the hands of Stan or the boy. This film reveals the realities facing many who are tormented by bullies. It makes one wonder how much tragedy could have been avoided had there been caring and responsive people in the lives of these tormented souls.",1468972800,2,420,4.5394736842105265
5055349,4,B00753M8U0,"I started out this film with the idea that it was probably going to be a terrible black comedy of some sort. While the beginning of it hints that is the direction it is going, it is anything but. While there are tiny moments really dark humor, the film for the most part is a serious tale of a bullied young man, and an elderly serial killer that runs a crematorium. Brad Dourif, as always , plays his role to the hilt and the young actor, Jeremy Sumpter is quite convincing in his role as well. Without giving too much of it away, the two form an unlikely bond and even a deep friendship. A really decent script that is quite realistic and well done.",1468627200,4,651,4.216
5055350,4,B00753M8U0,"It's hard to believe some viewers rated this movie a ""1"". If you want non-stop action and special effects, you're not going to find it here. What you will find is outstanding acting and directing coupled with a script that explores the lasting damage of child abuse and neglect and the extreme effect it can have later in life. The relationship crematorium owner, Stanley has with his bullied, damaged young protege is so convincing that I found myself rooting for them to get away with their many crimes. Very interesting film.",1468627200,3,528,4.813186813186813

5055364,4,B00753M8U0,"How could I describe this movie? It certainly is a horror film with some very odd characters. I actually had to watch it a second time to get to know the characters more deeply. Puzzling. It is mostly about a young teen who is bullied by those around him and he joins up with the funereal director who is in charge of the local crematory. As you can guess, the funeral director ""helps"" his young friend by getting rid of his enemies by cremating them.",1468368000,2,451,4.317647058823529

5055370,4,B00753M8U0,"Stanley (Brad Dourif) likes Italian opera, does crossword puzzles,  has bad skin, and runs the neighborhood crematorium. People who insult Stan take a tour of the oven. Jarod (Jeremy Sumpter and not the Subway guy) is odd and is bullied at school. He goes to work for Stanley and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what's next.

Brad Dourif played a great Stanley, the supporting cast was fair. They seemed to have wanted this to be dark comedy, but it didn't quite make it. The film needed one to two light kill scenes as well as a scene of Stanley putting the bodies into the oven, playing his opera music. The potential was there.

5055395,5,B00753M8U0,"This is by far my favorite horror movie of all time. There have been times when movies have been close to being better, but none have surpassed this movie. Brad Dourif, most known for voicing Chucky, does an amazing job as a passive-agressive funeral home director/owner/grumpy old man. The concept of killing people/characters off because of the person/characters actions and/or interactions with the killer is always a concept visited by many horror movies, most prominently Saw. Only difference is, in this movie Stan (Brad Dourif's character) personally kills them, unlike Jigsaw. Jeremy Sumpter's character Jarod, had a somewhat dissapointing character development, but it somewhat resolves itself eventually, much to my relief. The realism from all the characters added that extra bit of dimension to it, that most modern horror films seem to lack. It's the realism that really makes the story work, such as Jarod's reaction to his first kill and his innocence towards the concept of having a dead body on your hands. At points, the plot gets a bit mangled, and some concepts such as Jarod's mothers exploits seem a bit unneeded, but everything that happens in the movie happens for a reason to lend assistance to a central conflict/thought. But, all in all this movie is a must watch/buy/covet forever.",1406505600,2,1309,5.150234741784038
5055396,4,B00753M8U0,"Enjoyable, nonetheless. A character driven flick about 2 strange birds, 1 young and 1 older, who bond over death. If you are a morbid, macabre type like me, then you'll probably enjoy this off the beaten path flick for horror fans.",1399248000,2,231,4.658536585365853
5055397,5,B00753M8U0,"A serial killer named Stan (Brad Dourif- THE EXORCIST 3, DEATH MACHINE, THE HAZING) is kept very busy, between his murdering and work at his crematorium. Providentially, a local high school outcast named Jarod (Jeremy Sumpter) needs a job. Stan reluctantly hires the kid, who is very eager to learn about the business. The two have more in common than their love of the funereal arts, as one of Stan's victims just happens to be a girl who caused major trouble for Jarod w/ some school jock-types. When Stan finds out that Jarod is being bullied, he decides to help him out. When Jarod's mum starts dating an undesirable suitor, Jarod decides to take care of the problem. Of course, this complicates things greatly, causing both Stan and Jarod to depend on each other. DEATH AND CREMATION is a wickedly bleak horror / suspense film.

5055398,5,B00753M8U0,"Death and Cremation isn't your regular horror movie, it's more frightening in the sense that people that kill walk amongst us and could target  you for some trivial transgression.

The pace for this film is a little bit slow, but the great acting makes small plot foibles forgivable. While not immensely terrifying this film did have some nice unsettling moments.

5055403,5,B00753M8U0,"This is a very under-rated film that evokes memories of Stephen King's ""Apt Pupil"" without all the character background development. In short, this is a quite creepy and somewhat surprising little thriller involving a high school kid and his ultimate revenge on his tormentors. This revenge results from his unlikely bond with a reclusive mortuary owner who has a secret and strange past. Brad Dourif's excellent characterization of the boy's boss is inspired. The film has fine production values and great cinematography. As a plus, it moves like lightning, leaving no time for wasted scenes involving the background development of Dourif's character. This is left entirely to the viewer's imagination and would, in this reviewer's opinion, likely detract form the film's rapid pace. Sumpter is also very appealing and well cast as the harassed teen who finds his chance for revenge in his new job. Another great example of Indie filmmaking. (Beware: the DVD version is listed as in 1:33 aspect ration, whereas the release print is standard 1:85 widescreen Panavision)",1368316800,,1069,5.257309941520468

Maybe we've all felt, at one time or another, that the world would be a better place if someone we encountered were not in it. Brad Dourif's character has come up with an easy solution to that situation. His crematory business makes it easy to do away with unwanted bodies. Enter the kid with black finger nails and black eye-liner who is bullied and taunted at school and unhappy at home.  These two characters are a match made in heaven or maybe hell.  I agree with another reviewer that there are some situations in the movie that beg a better explanation. How many times can a victim be clobbered and stuffed into a car without someone seeing it?  Don't neighbors notice that the crematory furnace is going but there aren't no hearses have been seen.  These are minor details, though, compared to the ethical and moral questions raised by the theme of the movie.  The last question is, how far does a mother's love go?  Will Brad and Jeremy be able to avoid future problematic people?  We'll just have to figure that out for ourselves.",1518998400,,1126,4.651515151515151
