3676428,5,B001L0KHAG,"I adored this show. I enjoy a lot of cop shows but this may be my favorite. It's hard not to feel sorry for the new guys and girls who have entered this completely different world of policing and who have plenty of awkward moments. The end of every episode has a little ""zinger"" that gets you every time. It was a superb season and I only hope that they will make more.",1252454400,2,369,4.068493150684931
3676429,5,B001L0KHAG,"Okay, how am I reviewing this DVD before its release date?

To be frank, I purchased this two disc set directly from A&E Home Video Store at a higher price about a month ago and found it to be one of the most watchable, entertaining, and fascinating looks into the true crime
genre that A&E and Discovery have been producing over the past twenty years.

You can feel the frustration, the sense of impending danger, the disappointments, and the heartfelt emotions of these young American rookie police officers as they are individually put through the paces of a patrol officer by their ""FTO's"" [field training officers].

You will find yourself laughing, cringing, and even questioning your own sensibilities as to how YOU would handle some of these everyday situations that face the everyday street cop on the beat.

Between ""Brooklyn Homicide North"", the newly released ""Crime 360"" and now this series, ""The Rookies"", these television DVD's will be long remembered as the Golden Era of True Crime documentary entertainment.",1236902400,5,1025,5.047337278106509
8316768,5,B001L0KHAG,"I love this show, and really wish there were more seasons. If you are interested in being a cop, I think this show would be enjoyable and helpful to watch. It's about several rookies on a few of the days during their probation, and not all of them make it. Not being a cop myself, I think it is very realistic. The show and the training officers address that frequently: that not everyone can do this job, and it's much more than what you think while you are in academy. It think that is helpful to see a bit if you are starting in the process, because it is A LOT of time and energy getting to this point (probation), so it's interesting that about half of the rookies featured quit. Just overall very informative I think.",1492128000,,723,4.2846715328467155

8316772,5,B001L0KHAG,Fantastic show that really shows you the FTO process inside and out. Also the dvds have some good special features with behind-the-scenes stuff and some pranks the officers played on each other. If only this show ran for more than one season.,1377043200,,242,4.785714285714286
8316773,5,B001L0KHAG,This was a great show that they need to bring back on air.  It is much better than cops any day,1376697600,,95,3.5238095238095237
8316774,5,B001L0KHAG,Saw it on Netflix and had to have it! It is very interesting to watch these rookies try and hack it!,1363305600,,100,3.8095238095238093
8316775,5,B001L0KHAG,"this is a fantastic look into the world of being a new police officer.  I wish they would make more.  The problem is, one of the rookies they followed on his first months on the job, was senselessly killed while responding to a 911 call.  They talk about it and obv all the officers involved with this rookie are very upset.  I hope they make more, but I doubt they will.",1291075200,,371,4.183098591549296
8316776,5,B001L0KHAG,"I purchased this DVD for a high school class that I'm teaching which focuses on Public Safety.  ""Rookies"" is a realistic account of what it must be like to put on that duty belt and uniform for the first time, and get in a patrol car.  The insight provided by the rookies being followed in Tampa, FL and Jefferson Parish, LA are candid, frank, and eye-opening.  The training that's discussed is helpful for anyone who knows an officer, and would like to get an idea about what new officers have to experience.  Great show.",1274918400,,522,4.5212765957446805
8316777,5,B001L0KHAG,"If you like COPS, this is right up your alley.  Exactly as it says it is.  A look at police work from the eyes of rookies.  Really shows that even with all the training, they still have to learn on the job like everyone else.  This DVD also shows a side to law enforcement you don't often see, that sometimes they screw up just like any other person, and the only difference between them and civilians, is that their job is probably a whole lot tougher.",1254182400,,453,4.232558139534884
