4698943,3,B005GYZR3U,"I can see $30 for a full season but not half-season.  This is ridiculous!  I think I will wait until the price comes down before I will buy.  Otherwise, this is a great show!  I think WB would do a better job than CBS Paramount.  Hopefully all of the original music is there and maybe see some of the Ford car ads too!  That would be a REAL bonus for me!",1322870400,,354,3.915492957746479
4698944,1,B005GYZR3U,"The price is way to high,you would think this series came out in 2011. A full season should be $30:00-35:00 dollars. They treat this like perry mason. I have bought 400 seasons from amazon of shows. good way to lose me. All most $100.00 per season they must be on crack.",1320883200,2,270,4.313725490196078
4698945,1,B005GYZR3U,"As a kid I loved this show. Now on DVD in 2 parts - what Greed.
I have Ironside 1-7 and Mannix 1-5. It's in full box set. Why
on earth can they do that and for peats sake lower the price!!.",1316649600,10,189,3.5238095238095237
4698946,5,B005GYZR3U,"Many of the reviews for this product concern the price. It seems all the Quinn Martin shows on DVD are sold in two parts, and The FBI seems to have a higher retail for both volumes. We need CBS/Paramount to realize that there is a huge market for quality television, and since most of today's shows don't qualify, we look to the past. Most shows on DVD range between 30 to 50 dollars for complete seasons. Give us complete seasons, save on packaging and pass the savings along to the consumer. That being said, I was big fan of this show, and to me, the price is worth it. But I fear many do not feel as I do and therefore will not purchase the series and discourage the studio from issuing more seasons.
If Season 1, Part 1 is any indication, the quality will be excellent on Part 2. The usual character actors of the day such as Earl Holliman, Barbara Luna, Jessica Walter, Harold Gould, etc, were guest stars. Missing at the end of each episode are the appeals by Efram Zimbalist for information on wanted criminals.",1315526400,18,1019,4.396825396825397
4698947,4,B005GYZR3U,"The FBI is back in all its clean cut, button down glory!

 However...Buyers of this series should be aware that there is no synopsis, air dates or guest stars listed for each episode. Fans would have to remember the title of their favorite episode to recognize it. You have to be pretty hard core to know the titles.  This is unusual considering the premium price. The episode guide is avalaible by Googling ""FBI season one."" There are no bonus features since everyone connected with the series is dead or 90 something and not giving interviews. The episodes are good but the later ones after season 3 were done more on location. The earlier episodes relied more on the Warner back lot. (Sort of kills the suspended disbelief.)

 If enough people hold out for the price to fall the studio may just cancel season two for lack of interest. My advice? If you are a fan, bite the bullet and purchase season one, both parts.",1315094400,5,919,4.579268292682927
4698948,1,B005GYZR3U,"During the Season 1, Part 1, review section of The FBI, I was a five-star individual. I defended the price against those who were complaining about the outrageous cost ($50.00 for a half season). But I have switched allegiances after seeing the price spikes taking place with the Season 1, Part 2 installment.
  First, the potential customer is enticed into purchasing the product by a special pre-order price of $34.99. But here it is August 31st (the item doesn't even ship out until September 16th), and the ""pre-order"" option is no longer available. The cost has now jumped to 44.99 (or something like that), which is five dollars MORE than the current listed price for Season 1, part 1!
  The reason I'm so upset is that the seller isn't responding to consumer demand for a product (i.e., the prices usually go DOWN after more of a like item are produced), but instead the seller is inflating the price to what they think they can con the consumer into paying.
  I don't play that game. I'm willing to pay a fair price for a quality product, but the manufacturer of The FBI series is quickly losing a customer (namely me!). Keep the price consistent or bring it down, but DON'T KEEP PLAYING GAMES WITH OFFERING SUPER-LOW DISCOUNTS ONE WEEK, AND THEN SPIKING THE PRICE TO ABOVE OTHER INSTALLMENTS IN THE SERIES!",1314748800,37,1315,4.695652173913044

4698956,5,B005GYZR3U,"This is one of those classic Television shows from the sixties that is non stop full of action from the beginning to the end of the DVD.
Effrem Zimblest Jr. is fantastic as the F.B. I. inspector Erskine.  He is backed up by a cast of different guest stars in each episode which were taken from official F.B. I. files.

4698959,5,B005GYZR3U,Always the FBI is portrayed clean-cut and righteous but that is how the 1960's were --J Edgar Hoover had to approve every episode before it was produced.,1389225600,,153,4.703703703703703
4698960,3,B005GYZR3U,"The FBI belongs in the collection of those who grew up watching this. The remaining seasons become refined and very interesting. The first season is very sanitised and there is nothing wrong with that; however, as the series progress, you will find that it was worth the wait. Take the time to also wait for the prices to be reduced.

This series WAS released from 1965 to 1974 and Warner Brothers can be a bit expensive KNOWING that there are so many of us who enjoy quality programming. It is dated, but as the series mature, THAT will not matter. Most of the series are based on actual case files and dramatised for the audience. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. never disappoints, Phillip Abbot gives you the atmosphere of the seriousness of The FBI organisation. It gave young audiences a desire to become G-Men.

This is when series were actually series where each package is generous in the amount of series provided.  I would suggest purchasing each series (they come in series 1&2 as there are many per season).

 SO you will have to purchase 2 sets per season. Plenty of programming and place each in your wish list to treat yourself every month. I like the relationship that he has with his daughter.

A very fine Quinn Martin Series. Warner Brothers does not disappoint. Worth the investment , but just wait for the prices to lower, I may sell my first season for 1/2 the price and purchase the remaining seasons next month. If any one is interested, let me know. They will only be watched once by our family and we take care of our collection.  We are reasonable since we have opened our brand new packaged and will only watch them once. Let us know. We are reasonable and fair.",1389139200,,1678,4.554817275747508
4698961,5,B005GYZR3U,"This completes season 1 for me. Now I go on to season 2. I grew up with this and it is so nice to see the actors that gave us such good television before cable and greed ruined everything. And seeing those old Fords again is nostalgic to say the least. If you crash one of today's cars in to one of those, the old ford will come out with a small scratch and today's car will be dissintergrated.

I'm not done with the whole set of discs (I want to savor it!), but am ready to order season 2, part 1.  Not sure why they couldn't just put all the season together in one box...guess someone is enjoying the additional $$ they are getting for dividing it up like that.  I did notice that Lynn Loring was dropped after so many episodes without an explanation...guess they felt there were too many characters in the show.

4698967,3,B005GYZR3U,"The FBI was a wonderful TV series.  As a kid, I watched it every week.  Quality scripting, quality acting, everything that you would expect with the Quinn Martin moniker.  I have probably keyed in ""FBI TV series"" on the Amazon search page about 100 times over the years.  I was surprised to see it finally made available, a split Season One.  The introductory price is too much to pay (hey, unemployment is at an all time high, disposable incomes at an all time low).  I will wait until Season One is offered at a reasonable price, for each half of the season - offered together.  Why not save us all the trouble, offer the entire series as a boxed set, in the $100 price range.  What an entertainment bonanza that would be! I have seen the price drop slightly for Season One, Part Two.  I will wait until a boxed set comes out, with the entire series.  If not, I guess I'll have to give up this bit of TV nostalgia.",1326240000,7,916,4.304093567251462

8472530,5,B005GYZR3U,"Can't get enough of this well-produced crime drama. When I was a kid, we used to argue (we had the one TV set) on Sunday nights about to watch Ed Sullivan or The FBI. I guess you know where I stood (no disrespect for the iconic TV host). Our compromise came from the logic of watching reruns (I actually wrote down the titles of episodes we watched so no one could say 'we saw this FBI already!' OK....I was nuts, but it worked.)
This first Season featured Stephen Brooks as the intelligent, compassionate agent Jim Rhodes assigned to work with Insp Erskine (the great and late Efrem Zimbalist Jr). Erskine and Rhodes would make little small talk and what there was, it usually contained their views and observations of what they had discovered and/or grasped from what info they had. Also Rhodes was engaged to marry Erskine's daughter (played by Lynn Loring in 12 Season 1 episodes), and the Rhodes character was later replaced by a less emotional agent Tom Colby, played by William Reynolds. I would have to say that the first 3 seasons presented the agents on a more personal, human level. The cases throughout the 9 seasons were always fine but lacked some of the humanity in later seasons. I am a Vic Morrow (Combat!) fan and in the event you are as well, Seasons 6 & 8 both have Vic as the guest star.",1453075200,,1308,4.5
