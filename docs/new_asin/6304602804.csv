Although the style in this concert is much more conservative than in the Royal Albert Hall concert, Vanessa-Mae still manages to take out the snotty-stereotype of  classical music with her genuine enthusiasm for playing.  Some songs such  as Carmen Fantasy can only be heard on this Video and aren't available on  CD in the USA.  Most of the concert is based on her Classical Album 1.  The  classical version of Toccata and Fugue sounds excellent with the orchestra  playing along.  This video's version of Red Hot is nice to hear as well.  She plays this song with her electric violin and is accompanied by the  orchestra.  This gives a more of an epic feel to the song.  Between the 2  videos, I'd pick the one in the Royal Albert Hall over this one.  But  that's because I like the pop-fusion stuff better.  However, I do own both  and have to say if you're a fan, to definitely buy both.  If you've never  heard her music before, then try the other video first.  It'll make you a  convert.  I guarantee it!",954288000,4,1059,4.56989247311828
