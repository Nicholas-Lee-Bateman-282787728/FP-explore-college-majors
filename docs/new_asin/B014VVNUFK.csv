8732115,5,B014VVNUFK,"Same thing happened to my graduating class of 1965.  Out of 119 high school graduates, at least 5 served in Vietnam.  What I didn't like is that they portrayed these men as not very intelligent, that they were the bottom of the barrel somehow.  That's not true those who survived are good, smart courageous family men. Still I am grateful their story is being told.",1485302400,,365,4.584615384615384
