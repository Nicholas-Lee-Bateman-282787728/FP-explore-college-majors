7370540,3,B013PZNLO8,"Really wanted this to be a better film as I struggle with Kinsey's theory on male sexuality and deep down, I believe the ""gray scale"" is an escape route for men afraid to be the man God made them...GAY. The film dilemma addresses too little too late, and if Bruno only heeded the advice I think his grandfather gifted him, the ending might have been different. But, it wasn't and I guess, true to form, everyone suffers; especially they gay lover: the punished and the victim.
Actually, the early exchanges between the two male leads are romantic, even sexy, and reminiscent if you've had these kinds of personal, nostalgic experiences. Culturally, the film's story line, in essence, does not surprise as it feeds into some fairly accepted stereotypes about a culture where men appear more comfortable dabbling in male-male sexual relations with little or no responsibility for  their consequences on others. My candor on this subject has appeared in some of my previously submitted reviews and apparently offended those naive, weak, and unexposed to life's truths.

Finally, the lead male character is ""boy next door"" beautiful... tall, possessing  a pair of extremely kissable lips, masculine and sexy hands and feet, and an impressively inviting penis. One star is solely for his physical features.

Maybe the film deserves one additional star just for its optics...",1447545600,3,1369,5.098214285714286
7370541,5,B013PZNLO8,"Beautiful movie. I loved it! The acting was brilliant. So emotional and realistic, I loved each character and how at the end they were so true to what they were feeling. Bruno's character was so complex but stuck to his true feeling and new excactly what he wanted, though it would end up costing his relationship with Fernando. One of the best movies I've seen.

7370543,4,B013PZNLO8,"Great coming of age story with good actors and a good storyline that revolves around a married man, Bruno, who is at a crossroads in his marriage and takes some time off to figure things out. He then meets Fer, a young tour guide who only sees love and relationship in black or white, and not the grey area that Bruno seems to represent.

The story is simply told and some might not like the ending, but it's fitting for the premises of the movie so I was satisfied with it despite the fact that it doesn't resolve Bruno's Dilemma.

Definitely recommend. The movie takes place in Santiago so having been there, it was nice to recognize a few places.",1446940800,7,649,4.4

7370555,5,B013PZNLO8,"Director Claudio Marcone has produced a beautiful film. The story, the cinematography, the actors, the treatment--it all is quite wonderful. Having just viewed another Chilean film Des/Esperando from director Erick Kirschausen and then seeing this film--made me wonder what the heck is going on in Chile that such fine films are finally making it to viewers. This is a multi-layered story and rich in texture and detail. Bruno (an architect) is a married man and father in crisis regarding his sexuality. After 11 years of marriage and career success, he has decided to take time away from his family and finally come to terms with his sexuality. Although he understands that perhaps he has always had an attraction to men, he is very comfortable with women also. So much so, that he marries and has a son and to all observers and to himself, appears to be happy. Then something inside him, we are not really sure what it is, neither is he, compels him to question his happiness and dig deeper into his desires to be with a man. We learn that the sublimation of his homosexual feelings is in part due to the pressures to conform and to be like everyone else. That along with his own code of conduct, i.e., to always try and do the right thing, have a plan and execute the plan with no deviation, may also have helped him bury his inner feelings and emotions. The famous/infamous Kinsey scale of sexuality, could be substituted for  the ""grayscale"" I think. As you will recall from your Psych 101 course in college, the Kinsey Scale posits the theory/descriptor of human sexuality as a continuum that may change over time. The Kinsey Scale 0-6, (0 being exclusively heterosexual and 6 being exclusively homosexual), is often used as a way to describe what Kinsey observed as the spectrum of human sexuality. Bruno is perhaps a 3 on that scale and Fernando, the tour guide and historian he meets and befriends as a part of an architectural commission he receives, is a definite 6. These two coming together at a time when Bruno is reflecting on his life, creates an unexpected opportunity for Bruno to explore and delve deeper. The camera lingers in scenes as the viewer comes to live with Bruno in his search for answers, direction and happiness. Viewers may sense (I did), Bruno's true and genuine inner conflict. Ultimately, Bruno is confronted with having to choose and it is this ""privilege"" (as Fernando calls it)  of being able to choose, that forces Bruno to decide the conflict within himself. The director and the story provides a rather unusual context and backdrop for Bruno, in that there is no right or wrong, and no judgement. Bruno's boss, his grandfather and his wife are along for the ride and amazingly give Bruno the time he needs to try and find a way to live his life, not really knowing if being with a man or being with a women will bring him happiness, peace and a sense of resolution. What we learn here is that sexuality for some, maybe most, isn't black or white (as Fernando proclaims it is for him). For some, it becomes a conflict requiring a rational, conscious choice with no certain outcome or guarantee of happiness or peace. The selection of one road or the other, provides little if any consolation or confirmation that the road chosen was as good or better than the road not taken. This is good cinema. This is life. Watch it!",1459382400,,3362,4.6677908937605395

7370571,4,B013PZNLO8,"The filmmaker did an admirable job of capturing the ""grayscale"" in which the protagonist finds himself. And, he's in no hurry to resolve his dilemma, lickety-split, which emphasizes the weight of his troubles. For us lucky people, sexuality is far more black and white -- we like what we like, and we often know this early in life before we have a chance to run away from what we need. For Bruno, the architect in search of self, sexuality is a far more confusing matter, especially since he is in no way a rebel from the mores of Latin culture. Fernando, the teacher with whom he has an affair, is not encumbered by ambiguity about his sexuality -- he tells us this -- and serves as a wonderful counterpoint, as he is uninhibited, free to express himself on many levels, and playful and fun. Bruno is none of these things -- ultra-serious, afraid of what he'll learn about himself. Even worse is his wife, who is not portrayed as much more than a caricature; yet her world, such as it is, has been turned upside down and you feel for her plight, if not her. However, she seems cold and tethered to a life that is perhaps not completely of her choosing, given the culture she is locked into. She's a lot like Bruno in that sense, but seems even more miles away from happiness, no matter what direction Bruno is heading. Does she even want Bruno, except as a security blanket? Much is made of her jilting him before their marriage. I also liked how the filmmaker ended the film. In another day, Bruno would have been hit by a truck or a lightning bolt because gay or sexually ambiguous characters weren't allowed to live before ""the Enlightenment."" Check out ""The Celluloid Closet"" for more details on the history of gay characters in cinema. Yes, Bruno is gay. That's not really in the grayscale. By the way, does anyone know the name of the singer and the wonderful song that opens and closes this film? Wish there were a soundtrack. It's terrific and perfect for this movie.",1453507200,,1976,4.522346368715084

7370576,4,B013PZNLO8,"Just finished watching ""in the gray scale"" by TanTan Films, released by Wolfe Video.
""in the gray scale"" chronicles a young 30-something's early mid-life crisis as he attempts to put distance between his wife and 10-year-old son, along with his work and friends in an attempt to discover who he is and what he wants out of life.
Bruno though isn't going to get that distance he's seeking - despite having moved into a a cluttered storage room inside his grandfather's vast workshop.  His former boss hires him on a free lance basis to design - Bruno is an architect - a public monument that will bring all people in the city together.  To further this aim, Bruno's boss hires Fernando (Fer), who is a tour guide, to take Bruno all around the city in order to get ideas for a unique project.
As Bruno and Fer ride their bicycles all over the city, the two men bond and Fer attempts to seduce Bruno and fails twice at the attempt.
Spoiler Alert - In a rather graphic sex scene that almost rivals gay porn, Fer does seduce a rather, by now willing Bruno.
As their romance blossoms, complications arise for Bruno when his son over hears a friend's mother saying that she saw Bruno kissing a man.  Bruno is now outed to his family and he doesn't handle the situation very well.  He pushes everyone away - including Fer, who ultimately walks away from him because Bruno can't choose what he wants.
Bruno makes his own hell because he can't choose.  He wants to do only what everyone expects him to do.
""in the gray scale"" is a compelling drama about the messiness of life and how the choices a person makes because he wants do to what everyone expects him to do leads to heart breaking consequences that require moving on.
Now, as readers of reviews know, I usually deduct two stars for graphic sex scenes, but I'm only going to deduct one star because this is a foreign movie and the standards for sex scenes are a bit different in other countries.  Do NOT watch this movie if you are a PRUDE and are easily offended by full frontal male nudity.
Compelling story of self destruction and possible redemption.
Highly Recommended!

7370577,5,B013PZNLO8,"What a brilliant movie, in all respects. The actors give a very naturalistic performance, and the ending is free of any fantasy. In other words, the movie is realistic without ever being overly sentimental. The cinematography is artistic, in keeping with the characters' professions: guide/historian, and architect. I almost glossed over seeing this film because so many of these gay love stories are so poorly done, but this one is a real gem.

He's massively confused, scared of what everyone else thinks, has no backbone, and ends up being an a-hole to both his wife and the guy he has an affair with. He runs hot and cold and is cruelly insensitive. He can't figure out what he wants and is essentially unhappy in either scenario and miserable at the end. I got very annoyed with his idiocy, frankly.
