directed by Ho Meng Hua. Starring David Chiang,Norman Chu,Lily Li,Lo Lieh

David Chiang plays a monk like Gordon Liu in 36th Chamber and must protect the temple against other dynasty warriors and Pai Mei. After a shaolin temple has been destroyed he seeks refuge and recruits a group of rebels to help him restore shaolin and their country. Shaolin Abbot has more action than story promising you a great martial arts flick. Once again David Chiang and Norman Chu team up vs Lo Lieh,Chan Sen,and Kong Do(who plays a menacing Tibetian monk).

Shaolin Abbot has not been released in the US as a region 1 dvd yet,but good news is that Shaolin Abbot is available on I tunes for less than $10. I have personally bought my HD version there and it brings subtitles and English Dub language",1394150400,,795,4.664285714285715
