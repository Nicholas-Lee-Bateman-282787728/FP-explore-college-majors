8219317,1,B000VLOKT0,What good is it if it won't play on dvd players here in USA.  It didn't mention that on the description that it won't play here due to the encoding or whatever they call it.  That stinks.,1404864000,,187,4.027027027027027

8219319,4,B000VLOKT0,"This is a pretty amazing movie for its prescience.

It about this Italian girl who runs afoul of US intelligence and is in danger of being assassinated.  This inside guy in the NSA sees she is in danger and contacts her.  A chase ensues ala Jason Bourne with NSA hot on her trail via their technical-hacking methods.  The inside guy determines that the only way to get her out of danger is to expose the NSA and its capabilities to the world.  It's so amazing because it was made in 2007, six years before Snowden dropped a dime on the NSA.  All the things we've learned in the past year about the NSA from the likes of Snowden are laid out in this movie.

Having said that, it has pretty low budget with actors you never heard of with chase scenes that aren't that compelling.  It went straight to video and It's not even listed on IMDB.  A lot of this has to do with the nature of the technology they're depicting.  It's just hard to get excited about two parties staring at computer screens yelling about highly technical things.  example: ""oh no! they've detected our intrusion into their network, we've gotta run!""  and so on.  Still, amazing for its careful explanation of NSA methods and capabilities.  Just to think, if some investigative journalist had got a hold of this movie when it came out and taken it seriously, Snowden's expose woulda amounted to, ""tell us something we don't know.""",1396656000,,1399,4.544
8219320,5,B000VLOKT0,"Ok, maybe not the big budget movie but the plot is amazing and scary at the same time. Very scary to think this technology exists and what is it used for really.",1345852800,,161,4.0625
8219321,3,B000VLOKT0,"The other four 5-star reviews derive from the personal political views of the reviewers: three of them are concerned about NSA's capabilities of spying on citizens, while the fourth is happy that Big Brother is listening us all, so we should not be afraid of terrorists. (We take notice: three pinkos and one neoCon. Interesting, but hardly a cinematic fact.)
The film has good photography (it doesn't take much to get breathtaking panoramas from snowy peaks, anyway) and the idea is intriguing, but characters display a less than average intelligence. For example, the Italian lady gets a ""stop listening, we are about to burn you"" warning from a reliable source, but she just stays there listening so, lo and behold, she and the equipment are espectacularly fried. (By the way: is it possible to transmit so much power over the air? Hmmm)
Next, against Parks character's advice, the Iranian bearded fellow transmits their position to the enemy, so the bad guys come to kill them all. Now, Parks has to give his life to cover the escape of the other three. While escaping, they don't carefully step over each other's footsteps but go side by side, thus leaving three nice rows of footsteps, thereby indicating their number and improving the target area for the pursuing snipers.
But don't worry: The snipers also seem to be of the retarded persuasion, as they are fooled by false foot tracks made by Parks with a pair of makeshift wooden legs. (Did you ever tried that and managed to leave anything remotely ressembling real feet? And; how and when did Parks build them?)
The Iranian guy betrayed their position on the grounds that, since their equipment was destroyed, ""we are not going anywhere unless they come for us"". However, in a hurry and under much worse conditions, later three of them do escape by foot, anyway.
And to mention intelligent but ""enfant terriblish"" Tarantino: Michael Parks might be the best living actor, provided you get rid of Brannagh, De Niro, Pacino, Hoffman, Harris, Norton, Caine, Downey Jr, Penn, etc, and if and only he takes quite a few classes of English diction, so we could understand him.",1249689600,2,2129,4.867768595041323
8219322,5,B000VLOKT0,"This is really a great movie.  I sleep well at night knowing that our Government is protecting us.  No matter what people think about our Government, many men and women put their lives on the line for us.  On a lighter note, really enjoyed this movie.  Thanks.",1226102400,,260,4.468085106382978
8219323,5,B000VLOKT0,"Intriguing movie based on the realities of US spying technology and what it could mean for all of us.
A superb cast headed by Michael Parks (From Dusk to Dawn, Kill Bill, Vol I and Death Proof) who is 'frequently cited by longtime fan Quentin Tarantino as the world's greatest living actor' - he does the quote justice.
The story is about one man's struggle to protect an innocent woman from retributions, as she unknowingly becomes embroiled in the sinister world of international espionage, big business and the NSA. Overall very entertaining, a definate one to watch!",1197849600,10,570,4.88659793814433
8219324,5,B000VLOKT0,"I hadn't heard about this movie, but I'm glad I saw it.  The NSA can listen to us, even if our cell phones are off?  Yikes!  Apparently this movie is based on fact!  And it's a really good film.  Visually, it looks great.  And the story is captivating.",1196812800,5,252,4.145833333333333
8219325,5,B000VLOKT0,Michael Parks is amazing in this great movie. The technology in the movie is real. Its scary what the NSA uses to spy on us.,1196726400,5,124,4.0
