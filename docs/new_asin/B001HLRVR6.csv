It's just simply too good. Even if you're not a fan of Joe Satriani you will learn some awesome licks and tricks from this one that will take your playing to a much higher level. Danny Gill will show you 3 guitar solos and then teach you each lick that makes up the solos. The solos are made up of pentatonic, tapping and legato licks as well as whammy bar tricks and harmonics. If you want to become a super guitarist then you said study this DVD.",1510185600,,606,4.1440677966101696

8308911,4,B001HLRVR6,"I bought this DVD a while back and enjoyed learning the licks. As usual, Danny Gill does a phenomenal job at breaking down the licks and going over the theory. What I also liked about this is the section that breaks down the jam track chord for chord and Danny goes over some of the different keys that go with them. The licks in this DVD are somewhat intermediate to advanced and involve a lot of sliding which can be hard to get used. Also, some of the legato phrases will take some serious practice as well. Overall, I gave this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel that maybe too many ideas were shoved in the same DVD. Melodically, (to me) it was like a roller coaster. I'd really like some parts and hate others...In any case, I still feel that it was worth it and enjoyed learning the material. You really shouldn't expect to learn all styles of Joe Satriani in one DVD.",1239926400,2,880,4.275449101796407
