8000274,1,B0000D9YFM,"I had seen snippets of this DVD before I bought it on youtube, I knew I would enjoy the video itself. However I got hit with region code restriction like others.
Dismissing some PSA's from other non verified purchase reviewers that miss the point, this is a one star because the seller should make the buyer more aware upfront. We are not all going to scroll down to reviews to discover region codes, I wasn't aware of region codes existing in DVDs until today. I just saw the title and bought the item, like a normal person would.
They should put ""only plays on UK dvd players"" in the description in all caps or even the ""(only UK)"" in title of this product. Or try selling this only in amazon.co.uk .
I wish I could rip the video out of this DVD and make a US compatible copy.
I will probably return it as a broken product since it doesn't play",1511568000,,846,4.260869565217392
8000275,5,B0000D9YFM,"This is one of a number of Ricky Gervais live DVD's out on the market.

This particular product won't play on all DVD players however due to region coding. Please don't join the queue of morons who buy it and then act stunned that something clearly marked as not compatible with all DVD players isn't - gasp - compatible with all DVD players.

Having made that public service announcement I can continue on to say that this produce shows Gervais at his wonderfully understated best, weaving a gentle tale of gags that run the gamut from observational, satirical to slapstick. The show is not overlong but there is a lot of material in it. The man is obviously playing to an adoring audience in his home country. There is swearing in this DVD but it's not thrown about like confetti as per someone like Billy Connolly and in fact there is probably less of it than in 1990's era Ben Elton.

The DVD has a few extras which are OK, they do add to the value though aren't earth shattering.

Excellent stand up comedy by someone who is obviously quite intelligent and who doesn't need to reduce everything to its base element to get a laugh.",1488499200,,1135,4.495145631067961
8000276,1,B0000D9YFM,"The disc did not work because it was from the ""wrong region.""",1462492800,,61,4.166666666666667
8000277,1,B0000D9YFM,This DVD is also not viewable in this region (I guess meaning the USA since he's a British comedian). i Have no use for this DVD either that I cannot watch.,1425168000,,156,4.064516129032258
8000278,3,B0000D9YFM,It kinda pissed me off the fact that this DVD in paticular is not compatible with all DVD players. It limited its enjoyment.,1360540800,2,124,4.434782608695652
