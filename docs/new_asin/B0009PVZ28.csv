Was very pleased.  The video itself is excellent, I bought it because I am a Pauley Perrette fan, and I wasn't dissapointed, but the rest of the movie kept me captivated.",1250380800,,339,4.711864406779661
8065270,3,B0009PVZ28,"I was expecting to dislike this film (I usually hate indie dramas), but a friend of mine said it was worth watching. I was surprised by it. It's no masterpiece, but it has excellent performances. There isn't one bad performance in the whole film, which is rare for a low budget film like this. The best performances here go to Giancarlo Esposito as a street poet, and it's always lovely to see Janeane Garofalo, who gives a nice performance as a woman who hasn't left her apartment since 9/11.

The film, however, isn't perfect. The script is a little too pat, and it almost feels like a Lifetime TV approach, where there are ridiculous coincidences, silly comic relief, and everything is wrapped up too neatly at the end.  The music of the film is really over the top at times, especially near the end.  Sometimes it's a distraction from the drama on screen.  The lesbian couple love story is silly and unbelievable, and seems to be thrown in for titillation.  Janeane's character is underwritten, and is the weakest story in the film.  But, as usual, Janeane makes the character worth watching because of her incredible presence and talent.

All in all it's a decent little film, nothing to write home about, but filled with good, believable performances.",1218067200,3,1257,4.764976958525345
8065271,3,B0009PVZ28,"A well thought script with actors, for the most part, that can pull it off.  If you like the kind of story that moves from three separate people/couples than you will definitely like this one.  A bit mushy at the end but held together.",1190764800,,235,4.318181818181818
8065272,5,B0009PVZ28,"Janeane Garofalo as one of the stars attracted me to this obscure little art-house film and, as she usually always does, Janeane proves herself to be one of the most compelling women in American cinema.

But this movie surprises on many levels. All of the performances are very strong. Nikki Hansen and Tony Spiridakis are excellent. Giancarlo Esposito is transcendent as the street poet Karl.  All of the characters are people that you find yourself interested in and pulling for.

I highly recommend this fine ensemble piece. Expect yourself to be pleasantly surprised.",1168732800,3,571,5.118279569892473
