A famous singer is brought in by the military to a small town for a celebration of some sort.  He is befriended by a gregarious boxer also brought in for the fiesta.  The singer is almost beaten up when he refuses to sign for an autograph while guns are displayed nearby.  The singer is ordered to leave town when certain military types think he is an extremist.  He starts to leave town but finds out that his boxer friend is being setup as a fall guy during a boxing match the next day.  He risks his life ( and ultimately that of his hobo guide ) to return to town and warn the boxer of his fate.  Looks like 1984 movie.  Another good movie warning of what towns become when run by the military.
