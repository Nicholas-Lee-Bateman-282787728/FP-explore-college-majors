8447423,5,B004XS8EUS,"Fairy Tail is an amazing anime, tons of action, good storylines. Some older anime can be hard to get into, but this is pretty new and has a great feel all the way through.

As for the set itself, this is 72 episodes on 18 discs. No frills on the extras but that's still many hours of good content just getting through the series.

This package is actually 3 boxed sets of 6 discs (24 episodes) each. The next 24 episodes (73 to 96) just aren't out yet.

The subtitles are well done, unfortunately there is no English Dub available, but than this is an imported title that has only been released over seas so I don't know when an English dub is going to be available.",1303603200,9,666,4.228346456692913
