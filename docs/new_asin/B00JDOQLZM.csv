8649999,4,B00JDOQLZM,"Over 70 minutes of Wakefield Poole's unique visionary erotic sexual talent. A trip inside the ultra-art house colorful and twisted mind of a sexual gay porn pioneer. Poole brings forth a twisted tale of lust and pounding sensuality. Part art and part exploration and all erotic gay porn.
This is an adult gay feature film brought back from the 70's to a new modern generation. Bijou has a 70's feel yet is nicely restored by Vinegar Syndrome with this new clean up and restoration job, which showcases the beauty of forgotten sexual cinema.

What's so uniquely interesting and gives an awesome weird experience is this movie is filmed with a psychedelic atmosphere, mirrors, darkness, shadows, neon lights and sex. Lustful rough raw sex. Your main star moves through the many realms of Bijou fulfilling all exploration of his sexual lust and darkened desire.

Bijou has an underground art-house type feel. It showcases the stunning colors and visionary imagery that you would see in such films like a David Lynch movie. Wakefield Poole was truly a unique and interesting visionary talent. Most people would say its just porn but in reality its so much more. Its a statement in lustful glamour. There is a surrealism to the feature. When the Construction worker enters the Bijou it's almost like he is entering a piece of moving cinematic art or an erotic dream come to life.

Bijou stars Ronnie Shark aka Bill Harrison. He was a gay porn actor that had a really big penis and he knew how to use it. Sadly he died at a very young age of 43 but his extremely large talent graces the imagination in the films he starred in, including this retro classic of Gay Porn. He also directed gay porn. I am surprised he doesn't trip over his own penis it's so huge. I don't know how he sits with that thing.

This also stars Peter Schneckenburger aka Peter Fisk. Peter was a stable in Wakefield's movies also gracing the iconic gay porn film Boys in the Sand and 74's Moving!

I am a fanatic and obsessed and a lover of Wakefield Poole's cinema. He is a master at capturing his unique brand of imagery and capturing his unique perspective for the makeup of the human body. I am a fan when directors go above and beyond the norm and captures what they wish to express.

8650000,5,B00JDOQLZM,"In Bijou, Wakefield Pooles gay, experimental art/porn classic, a man crosses a threshold from gritty, sordid reality to a sensuously shifting netherworld of fleshly delights that may or may not exist outside his own mind. Filmed in 1972, Bijou (along with Pooles Boys in the Sand) helped usher in the age of Porno Chic, a period that saw a decisive upgrade in the quality adult films and made them accessible to a wider audience. Though filmed on a limited budget, Bijou benefits from director Pooles taste and intelligence (the fact that Poole is a former dancer with the Ballet Russes couldn't have hurt); with the exception of the opening scenes, the movie looks beautiful and mysterious, with vivid colors enhancing the charged, highly sexualized atmosphere.

Although there is hardly any dialogue in the film, there is a plot of sorts. An unnamed construction worker leaving the jobsite witnesses a woman being struck by a car. Her handbag flies across the road and lands in front of him. Without so much as a blink, the man picks up the bag, stuffs it into his coat and hurries away, leaving the unconscious woman to the ministrations of the cars driver and, presumably, the ambulance, whose siren we hear in the background. A less than heroic action on the part of our protagonist, who finally arrives at his tiny apartment and proceeds to dump the contents of the handbag onto his bed. Among the womans belongings is an invitation to Bijou at 7:00 that night and a tube of lipstick. The construction worker licks the tube of lipstick and fantasizes about various T&A scenarios, leading to a solo scene of him getting jiggy in the shower. Dude, what? Didnt you just steal the purse of an injured woman who might still be laying in the street? No, not creepy at all, eh? Anyhow, the guy gets dressed and shows up at the address for Bijou at the appointed time. Walking up a narrow flight of stairs he finds a positively Fellini-esque looking woman in a box office eating an orange. She directs him through a door into a dark room where he is instructed by a flashing neon sign to get undressed. He does, and from there on, all the films previous ugliness dissipates, as the man moves from one sexual encounter to another, amidst looming, vaguely erotic shapes that could be  body sculptures (or maybe an oversize orange), while classical music, strangely apropos, plays on the soundtrack. It has a bit of an Alice in Wonderland by-way-of-David Lynch quality, if Alice and the Wonderland inhabitants were naked and uninhibited gay males. The sex in Bijou, while explicit, seems somehow less of the porno variety and more of the artistic sort, though there are many who would disagree.

The anti-hero construction worker, played without dialogue by the prodigiously blessed Bill Harrison, looks the part of a construction worker (a good looking construction worker) and conveys his thoughts and emotion through nuance and expression (his eyes reflect the calculated coldness with which he snatches up the injured womans purse, and its disturbing).  His nameless, equally mute sexual conquests move with a certain element of grace and elegance, suggesting an avant garde dance performance.

Im not sure if Harrisons character learns anything while in the sexual maze of Bijou, or if learning anything is even the point (although I think it is). At the beginning of the film, hes got Playboy pinups tacked up on the wall and he fantasizes about women; by the end, hes had sex with half a dozen men of various types, and it seems that his coldness has melted away. Indeed, his huge smile upon leaving the Bijou building suggests that in entering Bijou he was able to find himself.

Enigmatic and elusive, Bijou is a pre-condom classic that should be seen more than once by open-minded audiences.",1420675200,21,3796,4.8503086419753085
