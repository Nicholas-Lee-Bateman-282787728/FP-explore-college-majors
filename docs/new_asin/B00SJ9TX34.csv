6987763,4,B00SJ9TX34,"If you're hoping for an Ong Bak like movie, stop now and look elsewhere. Panna Rittikrai moves away from the bare bones, simple stories of Ong Bak or Tom Yum Goong. In this offering, the story pacing is choppy at best with the narrative kind of jumping over plot holes, glossing over back story and character development. A lot of information is either left for the viewer to figure out or just guess at or is kind of dumped into a scene through a load of exposition.

Okay, critical stuff out of the way. What about the action? In a word, outstanding! This movie manages to out-cheese most 80's/90's action flicks and even manages to enter the realm of Michael Bay level explosions. And I say that with gleeful admiration. If you're just here for action set pieces, you've come to the right place. Story? You mean that thing that gets in the way of the fights? If you're already familiar with Panna Rittikrai's style, then you'll see his fingerprints all over this.

I recommend you treat this movie like an updated homage to the over the top, cheesy action flicks from 1987 to 1996. Watch it with friends who will enjoy it for the flaws as much as the precision of the fights.",1431302400,2,1178,4.5

6987765,3,B00SJ9TX34,"Good fights, terrible story without any character development and very bad acting. I have an impression that this movie is filmed by a student,  who needed to submit this project before a final exam. I tired to count inconsistencies. The villain female fighter was like a hulk spinning her opponent in the air, then this weird fight with a chicken bone, then this always alive  main hero, who was shot, exploded,  wounded through the chest,  car hit, and still breathing. My favourite omg was collision of the helicopter with the train.

Anyway we may endlessly continue grump about imperfections, but I must admit,  Thai fights are the most impressive one to watch on screen.",1429488000,3,676,4.885964912280702
6987766,4,B00SJ9TX34,"In the world of action flicks, it is becoming harder and harder to find originality.  Too many times, action directors repeat themselves and even borrow from other directors in order to spit out a film just for the sake of making money.  Director Panna Rittikrai certainly does not fall into this category, and Im very thankful to say his final film (before his death), VENGEANCE OF AN ASSASSIN, even brings a few new moves to the table.  And while this film is not perfect, it is a blast nonetheless and very entertaining to watch.

Rittikrai should definitely go down in cinema history as one of the men who redefined action.  He directed titles like the ONG BAK trilogy, BORN TO FIGHT, and THE BODYGUARD, but then also did the action sequences and stunt work for films like THE PROTECTOR (once again working with the talented Tony Jaa), CHOCOLATE, and RAGING PHOENIX.  He always pushed the limits of action, and as a result, the films on which he worked were always fast-paced and adrenaline-fueled.

VENGEANCE OF AN ASSASSIN is shot well and looks good from a production standpoint.  The budget looks fairly high, and no expense was spared on squibs for sure; there are tons of chest-popping bursts throughout the film, so many that I thought I was watching a John Woo film!  This is certainly not a negative, eitherthey are well done and look great, even in slow motion.

The acting is average, typical for an action film of this nature.  Some of it is overdone, and some of it is just plain badbut the drama is not what drives films like this.  Its the action, pure and simple.

And speaking of action, the fight scenes in VENGEANCE OF AN ASSASSIN are amazing.  Rittikrai and his team have put together some amazing fight choreography.  I have yet to see one of his films that didn't astound me in regard to its intensity and acrobatic brutality.  Skulls are crushed, legs and smashed, and one character is even run over with a variety of cars multiple times.  I cant put into words how much I enjoyed the fighting this film, but I will say it is the highlight of the whole movie.

Which brings me to the negatives.  Unfortunately, there are a couple.  First and foremost is the convoluted plotline.  Theres so much going on at certain points that its hard to follow.  And much of it doesnt even make sense, even when you can figure out whats happening.  I think I see where Rittikrai was trying to go, but the storyline never really comes together.  This actually didn't hinder me much from watching the film, because I was focusing more on the ass-kicking.

Secondly, the computer effects used towards the end are terrible.  The helicopter and much of the train were rendered using computer imagery, but the quality is reminiscent of mid-90s video game technology.  Again, this didn't detract from my movie-watching experience too much, but it certainly stuck out to me.

Overall, however, VENGEANCE OF AN ASSASSIN is a fun film chocked full of body-crushing action and intensity.  I recommend giving this one a look, particularly for nothing else but the fighting.  It is available now in a variety of formats, so give it a look.",1429056000,5,3138,4.694139194139194

6987775,5,B00SJ9TX34,"This is graphically violent, but if you can stomach Ong-Bak, you can stomach this too.

The story is a very simple (?) revenge plot centering around official corruption.  You know, kids avenging their parents, etc.  It moves nicely and the martial arts are excellent.

It suffers a little at the end.  Obviously Panna Rittikrai never saw 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', which if anything teaches us 'When you have to shoot, shoot;  don't talk' (Eli Wallach as Tuco).

It's unclear who survives at the end.  Of the 3 protagonists, only the uncle is dead for sure.  Of course, since this is a vengeance film, all the bad guys die quite violently.",1432425600,,646,4.646017699115045
6987776,4,B00SJ9TX34,"Top notch martial arts, gunplay and stunt film. The story is a mess, but the action is original and more than makes up for the film's short comings. It reminded me a lot of the action films from Hong Kong in the late '80s. Lots of bloody squibs and CGI is kept to a minimum except for one ludicrous scene.  If you are a fan of these types of films , this is well worth a watch.",1432339200,2,377,3.896103896103896
