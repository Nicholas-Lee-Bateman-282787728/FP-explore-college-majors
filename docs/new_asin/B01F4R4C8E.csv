8760117,2,B01F4R4C8E,"This is a documentary of Eric Wright, aka Easy-E a ""street pharmacist"" who formed N.W.A. and then died from AIDS in 1995.

The documentary was not very professionally done from graphics to soundtrack. It consists of a bunch old footage as people talk about Eric's love of kids, rap, drugs, and guns. The film is divided into chapters as we discover Compton had drugs in chapter one and in chapter two they talk about music style of the 80's but never played any of it. Yes, it appears the documentary was so low budget they didn't buy the rights to any music. So while we have a documentary about Easy E who is solely famous because of his music, we don't get to hear any of it. It reminded of that Jimi Hendrix biopic where they didn't have the rights to his music.

The film is almost entirely of interviews of people talking about Easy. They could have done better but wanted a cheap product to get out quickly riding on the heels of the success of ""Straight Otta Compton"".
