Meanwhile, the older brother of one of the kids decides to gather his friends (and lots of beer, and pizza), and have a seance in an old abandoned house. Of course, the real demon is conjured, leading to many grisly deaths. SOUL OF THE DEMON is extremely cheap-looking, but isn't altogether awful. It makes the best of its microscopic budget, taking a cue from 80s trash horror like NIGHT OF THE DEMONS. Worth a look if you can get past the bargain-basement production values. Gorehundts will love the gooshy guts and dismemberment!...",1360540800,,634,4.7207207207207205
