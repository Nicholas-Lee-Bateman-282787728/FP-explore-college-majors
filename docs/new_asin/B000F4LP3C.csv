8117491,1,B000F4LP3C,"This is one of the worst movies ever.  I bought it b/c I grew up in Astoria.  Really simplistic plot and bad acting.  If you want to see Astoria, the neighborhood, in a movie, see Used People, filmed on 34th Street off of 30th Ave. (I know b/c I lived on that block) or A Bronx Tale (filmed further up on 30th Avenue), or Goodfellas (also in the same area) or, even, Queens Logic, which is pretty bad but will give you lots of the neighborhood as well as Kevin Bacon, which is never a bad thing.  There's a big movie studio in Astoria (aside from Silvercup in LIC) so you'll see Astoria as a stand-in for other NYC neighborhoods.",1212796800,,629,4.216666666666667
