8676995,1,B00NARLTOG,"Looking for some holiday horror? Then steer clear of this train wreck, which features three crumby films with ZERO CONNECTION TO CHRISTMAS. Not a Santa in sight, not a rambunctious reindeer, not single snowflake.

What you do get is some tripe about a killer clown with a decent-but-padded ending; a crappy movie about, well, crap; and what boils down to softcore pornography.

Blatant false advertising. Not worth your time or money.",1439769600,,434,5.098591549295775

SLOPPY The Psychotic-Pretty amazing segment,Yes,Its mostly a Horror effort,But,There is humor-Black Humor.
The lead is a birthday party clown,Whose had better days and this would be one of the worst.
Really good script,Witty situations,Unique Kills,Believable lead.
IN the middle,Thank Gawd,Not at END 

I.B.S. -Okay,The title is for shock value,I get that. The lead actor has a John Candy innocence  haven't seen in awhile. The deaths are funny in a inventive way, No less. Oh,That Musical MontageLOL !

The Experiment- So,The final flick is scary & sexy. The lead scream has to be a stripper,practice on the pole and loses everything and then make money as a drug tester while being filmed without her knowledge,Actress is awesome and has to carry the flick while ALL the actors are mean and self centered and things end badly,But with some Redemption.",1417392000,3,903,5.157534246575342
