8229522,2,B000XSKDNI,"Like most Retro-Seduction releases, I was thoroughly disappointed by this 'newly recovered' rarity from the mid-60's shot in B&W and primarily narrated  waste of film and time. It's so awful it makes a David F. Friedman or Doris Wishman 60's flick look like a sexual 'Gone With The Wind' in its scope, plot and budget. A total waste of time and cash to anyone less than 60 years of age, and would probably suffice only to put Grandpa to sleep. There's a hint of a plot regarding two actresses who come to New York to find fame and fortune and how far one will go obligingly while the other must be coerced, but both end up in the same sewage regardless.

There's nary a bit of skin on display - let's remember this is allegedly a sexploitation flick - and the downtime here dominates the dimwitted dialogue/narration to the point where you'll be fast-forwarding through 's of this dungheap till the end credits roll, and you'll wonder if you forwarded too quickly and might have missed some skin. Nope. At a mere 70 minutes, you won't know whether to feel cheated or relieved. This is when you really come to appreciate 'Something Weird Video' releases - they rarely disappoint when it comes to time-honored retro releases chock full o' skin and degeneracy, god love 'em.

Oh yeah, there's a second disc of more stuff you could do without, but at least here you get the ample nudity you were deprived of in the main feature. And their 'Trailer Vault' is usually the highlight of their releases, that's how weak most of their catalog is, IMHO. Avoid this turkey altogether and seek out something worthwhile from 'Something Weird' instead. Take this advise from a 'Sexpert'.",1290211200,3,1672,4.680272108843537
8229523,4,B000XSKDNI,"Being a fan of 1960s pre-MPAA Adults Only/sexploitation films I had to snap this up. While not in the same league with my favorites (Sin in the Suburbs, Help Wanted Female, Satan in High Heels, etc.) in terms of entertainment value, I was never really bored, although those looking for a serious sex film with plenty of skin on display will probably be disappointed. Produced by exploitation vet William Mishkin, this movie was considered lost until recently when RetroSeduction Cinema located a B&W interpositive (minus its color inserts) and restored and released it on this DVD. The ""plot"" concerns two aspiring actresses (Lana Lynn and ex-David Friedman starlet Rusty Allen) in New York City who get involved with various theater types as they try to land parts in a play. The film employs an odd framing device, introducing us at the beginning to the supposed producer, director, and writer of the very film we are watching, and cutting back to them periodically to listen to them discuss how they want to advance the plot, which sometimes causes changes to on-screen events. There are only snippets of (post-dubbed) dialogue throughout, the majority of it narrated off-screen. Those unfamiliar with this type of movie may be put off by this but, having suffered through far deadlier films of its ilk, I had no problem with it and was pretty consistently amused if not wowed throughout its 71-minute running time. There is also very little nudity, in fact much less than I would have expected; I'm not really sure how they sold this to the raincoat crowd. Fortunately, the narration leans toward the snide and sarcastic (a la A Sweet Sickness) and is the chief source of entertainment, along with the many outdoor scenes of NYC circa 1965. Some of the narrator's comments, particularly those concerning a powerful stage director's has-been, alcoholic ex-girlfriend, are hilarious. Madame Olga herself, Audrey Campbell, also appears in a bit near the end as a partygoer who does a short striptease dance (sadly only to her undies). There were originally several color insert sequences (the narrator specifically mentions them) that are still considered lost, which have been ""approximated"" by snippets of color peep loops of the era. Unless you're really into this stuff this is not a must-have release but still makes a nice addition to any 1960s sexploitation collection.
The image is quite clean, with little in the way of speckling, dirt, or damage, and boasts nice rich blacks and grayscale. You really couldn't ask for better from a formerly ""lost"" sexploitation title. Extras include a handful of color peep loops, parts of which were used to complete the feature, and a collection of three vintage NYC TV commercials featuring Audrey Campbell, one with her Olga and Sin in the Suburbs co-star Woody Parker, that for me are the real gems of the set. If you've seen Sin or the Olga movies you'll get a kick out of Miss Campbell worrying about her leaky basement, floor wax, and upholstery, and New Yorkers may wax nostalgic at the mention of the now-defunct Gimbels department store. The package also includes a second disc of peep loops called Naughty Nudes `65 for those who require ""the full Monty"", and was no doubt included to beef up the salability of the admittedly rather mild, second-string feature. Plenty of hyper-pneumatic babes and full frontal nudity here for the aficionado of same. There is also a slim booklet with informative liner notes by Michael Bowen. While the outer slipcase features smut-paperback art similar to RetroSeduction's releases of Hideout in the Sun and Moonlighting Wives, the inner DVD case features a nice reproduction of the (full-color!) one-sheet from the original Mishkin release, and some ""hotter"" photos on the back than those featured on the slipcase. All in all a very respectable release geared toward the 1960s sexploitation devotee. With Something Weird Video's contract with Image Entertainment a thing of the past, it's nice to see that RetroSeduction has stepped into the breach with some long-awaited and, dare I say it, classy sexploitation DVD releases. I'm almost ready to forgive them for foisting those cheesy direct-to-video Misty Mundae pornos on the world.",1202083200,10,4228,5.067431850789096
