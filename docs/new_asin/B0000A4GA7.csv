8158614,5,B0000A4GA7,"While I suggest that you get the Special Edition which includes another full DVD of Angel Cassidy and friends, this a great softcore dvd and I usually don't go for these. You don't have to play it at Halloween either lol. The girls knock on your door and you have to choose what to give them and then you get your treat if you choose right but even if you get it wrong you still get two other chances to get it right.",1201132800,2,417,4.036144578313253
8158615,3,B0000A4GA7,"Soft-core interactive dvd where you (the audience) knocks on the door.  A different beautiful woman answers each time and asks you a question.  If you answer correctly, she dances/strips for you.

I thought the concept was pretty unique and fun, but after about 3 or 4 ""door knocks"" I grew bored with the interactive part. I believe there is an option to bypass that section on the dvd.  Some of the wrong answers were funnier than the right ones.

A few of the ladies were stunning and quite the seductive little dancers, but there were others who either seemed nervous/camera shy or inexperienced.  That kind of ruined it.

This dvd is the kind of thing you want to play on an October night with a good group of people....probably during some drunken festivities.

Overall I'd give it a 3.5",1152403200,10,792,4.64748201438849
