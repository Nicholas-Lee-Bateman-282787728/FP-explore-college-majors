5129276,5,B0083VOYUA,"I very much enjoyed this film. I found the acting to be excellent. The cinematography was beautiful and well done with an eye to detail and accuracy. Soaring and enjoyable musical score. A really good story all around.

I recommend this for everyone.

I also have a comment about some of the reviewers who don't seem to know the difference between reviewing a movie and snotty cynicism. These seem to fall into two categories. 1. I didn't like the plot. Did you miss the part about how it was a true story? 2. It's not how I would have done it, therefore it is bad. If you were any good you'd be making them and not just seeking attention through your long winded and poorly written movie reviews. Seriously, some people and their inflated egos and sense of self worth.

There are always many ways to tell the same story. BBC chose this way and this production. It is, in my humble opinion, well done and worth your time to watch it. I base this, not on any sort of ""special coolness"" factor or ""so above it all"" attitude but on the fact that those of us sitting together and watching this really enjoyed it and we would all recommend it. We would watch it again. In the end, that's all a good story telling needs to do.",1353196800,2,1220,4.342105263157895
5129277,3,B0083VOYUA,"""Going for gold"" takes place in at 1948 Olympics in London and is a story of one of the three gold medals won by the British.  Six weeks before the games the British sculling was burning with the desire to win a gold medal and did not think any of the current teams could do it. They put together a new team of two men who from different worlds - a boat builder's son Bert Bushnell and Oxford educated Richard Burnell. They had different approaching to sculling strategy and life which they had to overcome to win a gold a medal.

I enjoy watching sports and the premise of the movie sounded interesting to me. I found the movie to be Okay (not bad, but not something I would watch again). I did not find it as compelling as Chariots of Fire which has a similar story line. The conflicts in this story were simple, predicable in both content and resolution. I never felt fully connected and vested in the characters. On the positive side I enjoy watching Olympics and knowing that it is based on a true story made this story more interesting.

The DVD comes with the feature film as well as 1948 Olympics Trivia Game, which I really enjoyed even though it ranked me as ""Rubbish"". It was quite educational and the ranking trully reflected my lack of knowledge of Olympic history of that period.  The movie runs approximately 90 minutes and has optional English subtitles.

I received a review copy of the DVD to write an honest and unbiased review and this review reflects both both pluses and minuses of my experience watching this movie.

Ali Julia review",1350777600,,1556,4.5
5129278,5,B0083VOYUA,"Mr. Bert Bushnell (Matt Smith) is trying out for the Olympic team. He competes in the one man sculling events and lately he has lost his edge.  He is having difficulty balancing his life with a full time job, a girlfriend, training and racing.

England is staging the games in 1948 and they are cash poor and working on a shoestring budget.  They need the games to stimulate tourism and help the struggling economy. England has no money to spend for the games or on their athletes but they want to make a good showing as they are the host country.  Jack Beresford (James Frain) is the man who will train and help select the British Olympic sculling teams and Jack is looking at some unusual ways to pick Olympians. He wants to pick the best talent but perhaps shuffle them into different positions.

Jack picks Bert and a partner, Richard (Dickie) Burnell (Sam Hoare), to row as a team in the two man sculling event.  Bert is mad as he sees himself as a single man sculler but Jack warns him that he walks away from this opportunity he will not get to participate in the Olympics.  Dickie had to give up his other partner as they were just not good enough as a team to win.  The two young men do not get along as they are from different spectrums of British society. Bert is working middle class and Dickie is an Oxford graduate who comes from money and works at the London Times as a writer.

The team doesn't form right away and they try brute strength and fast pace to get the best practice times.  The results are good but more of a competition between the two men than real coordinated team effort. Bert thinks the boat needs to be modified and Dickie is mad but whatever is wrong is killing his back every day.  Dickie finally understands Bert's logic and they modify the boat and begin respecting each other and working as a team.  The results are outstanding as they begin to gel and understand each other's strengths and weakness.

They also realize that they are not so much different as they both have highly competitive and domineering fathers and face the same stresses in their young lives.  They both want to win for themselves but also for their families and especially their fathers.  In six weeks they have to train together and go to the Olympics and win the gold metal.  It is a daunting and challenging task.....

I really enjoyed this movie and I found it inspiring and entertaining.  It was interesting how the two young men learned to work together, respect each other and mature as a team in just six weeks.  This movie was made by the BBC and is sold on DVD by BBC Home Entertainment.  I recommend this movie to you as very entertaining and motivating.  I actually got emotionally involved in the movie and to me that is what made it enjoyable.  Knowing that it is based on a true story makes it all the more inspirational.

I was sent a sample of the DVD and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.",1349481600,,2933,4.420856610800745
5129279,5,B0083VOYUA,"I love inspirational stories and this credible portrayal of real-life events was an engaging watch. The drama focuses on the true story of Bert Bushnell (Matt Smith) and Richard ""Dickie"" Burnell (Sam Hoare), British sportsmen who became partners in the double sculling event at the 1948 Olympic Games. The backdrop is post-war Britain, a country and nation that had suffered much devastation. I found it interesting that in the drama, it is insinuated that the Americans were eager to help out England by hosting the games, but the powers that be in the British government decided to go ahead and host the Games, even at great cost because the bureaucrats and politicians believed the Games could bring in much needed revenue for the country's rebuilding efforts.

At heart though the story is about two young men, both from very different backgrounds. Bert is a boatbuilder's son, and finds himself under pressure from his father to qualify for the Olympics. Once Bert accomplishes this, the pressure only gets worse, with his father going so far as to meddle in his private affairs, frowning upon Bert's relationship with a sweet young woman whom the father feels is nothing but a distraction.

Then there's Richard who is an Oxford-educated journalist and who also happens to have a demanding father. Richard and Burnell Sr. appear to have a very formal and awkward relationship, and initially I could not even believe they were related! Their interactions are always stilted and it is apparent that Richard feels he can never measure up to his father's high expectations.

Both Bert and Richard are brought together by a former Olympic champion (many times over) turned coach and they find they need to get their act together within six weeks. Driven by sheer grit and determination, the pair soon find themselves overcoming their differences, working diligently, training hard, and sacrificing their personal lives in order to achieve glory. The story is fast paced and at around 90 minutes, the action keeps moving along. There's plenty of rowing action, but this is effectively balanced by the human drama. It is not just a sports story, but also it explores the relationship and bonds between fathers and sons. The drama credibly balances both and the result is a highly engaging story that should appeal to sports-obsessed fans as well as those who like a well-told story.
The DVD comes with the feature film as well as special features in the form of a 1948 Olympics Trivia Game, a photo gallery, and a trailer for the movie. It is in color and runs approximately 90 minutes, with the option of English subtitles.",1347235200,10,2623,4.956818181818182
5129280,5,B0083VOYUA,"This bright and shining little film was made by BBC as a docudrama of sorts, likely produced to gain the attention of a story from England's history with the Olympic Games: it is a true story of an event form the 1948 Olympic Games but it is far more than that, and as such it deserves wide audience recognition as an exceptional, touching film about sportsmanship, friends, commitment, and father and son relationships. As written by William Ivory and directed by David Blair, this little BBC special, known in England by the title BERT & DICKIE, is a quiet homage to all that is good about human interaction.

The time is postwar 1948 London where despite lingering rationing and austerity measures the first Olympic Games after the war is to be held. The members of England's government quibble about not having sufficient funds to host the event while the treasury's public relations officers see the Games as a potential source of tourist income and a chance to demonstrate to the world (especially to the Yanks!) that England is still a significant power.  Areas for the various aspects of the games are quickly assembled with meager funds, the athletes are given jerseys with the country's emblem, but they must supply their own shorts, and categories such as Etching competition are added to beef up the agenda. The working class son of a boat builder and slightly-built, Bert Bushnell (Matt Smith) knows he's got what it takes to represent his country in the single sculls and is upset when former Olympian medalist and innovative organizer Jack Beresford (James Frain) pairs him with journalist Dickie Burnell (Sam Hoare), whose privileged background he despises. Their initial poor performance sees them at odds but, after Bert has convinced Dickie that their boat needs alterations, their prowess and mutual respect increases. On the eve of the games a nervous Dickie is given confidence by Bert's father (Douglas Hodge) and applies a little of his own cunning to ensure a path to the finals. Ultimately Bert also seeks reassurance from Dickie's father (Geoffrey Palmer), both elders having Olympic secrets of their own, and the pair go on to beat the favored Danish duo and win the Olympic gold medal for duo skulls. It is a story of the disparity of the classes in England and the miscommunication between fathers and sons that is healed by overcoming differences and working together to resolve histories that are changing with the post war world.

The supporting cast is superb with Anastasia Hille as Bert's opera loving, non-interfering mother, Sara Vickers as Bert's girlfriend Margaret, Nathan Wiley as the Yank sportsman Jack Kelly, and others. Yes, it is a strong film about the history of the Olympic Games and their importance in international camaraderie, but it is even stronger as a story of how men - sons and fathers can come together despite the moat of pride that initially surrounds them.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, August 12",1345852800,,2964,4.967741935483871
5129281,5,B0083VOYUA,"Just in time for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London comes this beautifully done new film about a pair of scullers (two man rowing teams) who - as the title says - are ""going for (the) gold"" medal at the 1948 Olympics. Honestly, I think BBC Home Video should have released it a few weeks BEFORE the 7/16/2012 Opening of the games (rather than during them when folks will be glued to their TVs - or iPads or smartphones - watching the 2012 games. But I hope it will still find an audience.

The 1948 Olympics were special for a number of reasons: It was the second time that England was the host country (2012 sets a record by making it three). There had not been an Olympics for 12 years prior because of World War II. And Britain was virtually broke and could hardly feed its own citizens, let alone host an Olympics. The above gives a nice ""back story"" to that of the two young men (each a single rower) who are thrown together to win their even as a pair. Each man has a father who wants something different for their son. And, then is, of course, the relationships these guys have with their girl friends. It all mixes together into a 90-minute film that was made for BBC TV (and I'm sure aired on the BBC America cable channel.). And it is - as they say - ""Based on a true story"".

You know going in that the climax will be the big race and yet the direction is such that you are drawn into the story and held there till the end, cheering for these guys.

None of the British actors were familiar to me which made it even more interesting as I wasn't trying to recognize anyone.

The DVD includes three ""Special Features"". First is the requisite ""trailer"". Then comes the photo gallery - nothing special. The last SF is a ""1948 Olympics Trivia"" Quiz, which is cleverly done. Many - but not all - of the answers can be found by watching the film.

If you loved the 1981 film ""Chariots of Fire"" (about competing track stars at the 1924 Summer Olympics, you'll want to see this. But anyone interested in sports films should like it as well. I know one thing: I did.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8524852,2,B0083VOYUA,"I wanted so much to like this film, especially since I enjoy most of the British dramas and comedies on film and tv. Its a pale variation on Chariots of Fire, which is far superior in every way. The characters consist of every imaginable caricature of British class types. And one of the main incongruities is hearing Maria Callas scream her way through arias that have absolutely nothing to do with the story (and those arias were recorded after 1953; they didn't exist on records in 1948 when the story unfolds). The performances by Matt Smith and Sam Hoare were fine, but the movie is a mess.",1516233600,,595,4.570093457943925

8524857,4,B0083VOYUA,"First of all, I would buy it again, but it didn't have the dynamics of Chariots of Fire or The Boy in Blue.  It did have a good teaching behind it, for not only was it about Olympics' training, but about two young men from different social circles and how they overcame the status separation which was very prevalent at that time.",1442793600,,330,4.32258064516129

8524861,4,B0083VOYUA,"As I live in New Zealand and have an all regions DVD player I have the choice of buying from Amazon.com or Amazon.co.uk depending on how the exchange rate works out in NZ dollars. I usually prefer Amazon.co.uk as their postage rates are cheaper and DVDs arrive within ten days whereas from America it is more like 20-30 days. But I was surprised to see this little gem is not avaliable in the UK even though it is BBC so was glad to be able to get it from Amazon.com as the depiction of England struggling to put on the Olympics so soon after the war with bomb damage and food rationing was very telling. I particularly enjoyed Geoffrey Palmer as Dicky's grumpy stiff upper lip father with a heart of gold, Just one query. Did the BBC concert programme always have opera on the radio every day precisely at the time  when the double sculls were competing?",1393718400,,855,4.4113924050632916
