8354333,2,B0027A00WE,I thought this dvd was in English. I don't know if that was included in the description but I am very displeased...Without the subtitles (which distract from actually seeing the movie) I would not have known what was going on.,1438905600,,226,4.675
8354334,5,B0027A00WE,Great family drama that everyone can have a moment to relate to.  The situations are real life and the best part is watching Sticky Fingaz speak in Hindi lol,1386028800,,157,4.413793103448276
8354335,3,B0027A00WE,"So I received the DVD in the mail and watched it right away because I love Sushmita Sen. I read reviews on the movie from other people who complained that the acting was horrible, the production was cheap and I wanted to see for myself, and this is what I came up with.

  The acting isn't that bad. I believe that since English is probably not the entire casts first language and/or the dominant language that they speak on a daily bases or act in, causes the speech to be a little hesitant. Like when you have a conversation with someone who has been speaking English long enough to understand you, but has a difficult time replying in the same native-like-flow as Native Speakers. Also, the accents might count for why some people think that the acting was horrible. It does at time take away from what they are saying when the pronunciation on certain words are off. This goes for Naomi Campbell's English accent too. I have seen plenty of Sushmita Sen's work to know that she is a phenomenal actress, but does need work in acting in English. Trust me, as someone who has acted in English and Spanish (Spanish not my first language) there is a difference. HOWEVER, Naomi Campbell can't act and watching her attempt was painful.

  The plot was consistent though there were times where it ventured off into ""What the hell does this have to do with the movie"" territory. The only complaint that I have, is, that it makes 3 races look bad. The stereotypical portrayal of White Southerners is just shameful, the Black ""gangsta""  rapper living next door made me shake my head in disappointment, and they made even Indians seem pretty racist too. Also the inconsistencies with the minor characters were awful: first the rapper is hard and has a 'I don't give a f**k' attitude, then he is all crying and B.S. because they framed him, then he's hard again and then at the end he speaks Hindi. WTF?

  Any hoodles in the end I am happy I got this movie for 10 bucks!",1275696000,,1961,4.5141242937853105
