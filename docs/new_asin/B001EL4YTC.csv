After watching it and trying the projects you'll be amazed at how well your work turns out and that it was way more simpler than you thought. You'll be amazed at your potential in painting and want to learn more. His style of teaching is straight forward, easy to follow, but laid back. It's great to see him at work and wanting to share his style with the world. The episodes contain one project each and are about 45 mins in duration. I look forward to picking up series II. 3 dvd's  in the series that contain 13 projects. They are a pleasure to watch and well worth there MSRP - bonus if you find it for less. If you are looking to paint marine life - this is a great start in helping to achieve some effects and techniques that look hard but can be amazingly simple. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to do Wyland style, learn some new techniques, or learn pointers on marine life painting.",1235433600,19,1016,4.319371727748691
