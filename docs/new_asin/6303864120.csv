7854401,3,6303864120,Another holiday that no one really gets into - but it's Peanuts.,1410393600,,64,4.416666666666667
7854402,4,6303864120,"Recently purchased the DVD of It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown, and saw this as a bonus special. It's a rather interesting,  yet unheard of Penauts special (to me, at least).  I had never heard of, nor seen this special until now. I laughed at the crazy antics of the Peanuts gang, and thought it did a good job covering information about a holiday not celebrated by many people in the country. If you own a copy of the aforementioned DVD, check this special out. It's worth watching, even if you don't celebrate Arbor Day.",1397865600,,528,4.5473684210526315
7854403,5,6303864120,A must have for every Snoopy fan's collection! a funny and charming Charlie Brown tale that can teach viewers of all ages about a Holiday that many of them might not know about before watching this video.,1373328000,,204,4.54054054054054
7854404,3,6303864120,The product was fine for the price I paid.  The video case was in poor condition--but I wasn't expecting brand new.,1243814400,,115,4.476190476190476
7854405,5,6303864120,I was pleasantly surprise with this video. I used it in my kindergarten class. It held the students attention plus had some very informative facts. The pictures are darling and appealed to both the girls and the boys !,1243209600,,218,4.615384615384615
7854406,5,6303864120,"I remember being inspired by the awesome garden the gang made of Charlie Brown's baseball diamond as a little kid, that I wanted to grow one as big as it was!  As previous reviews have said, a cool factor in this lesser-known gem is that it teaches people about Arbor Day and planting without them even realizing it.  Definately one to see and have in your collection if you haven't already!",1176940800,,391,4.492957746478873
7854407,5,6303864120,"Although not as well known as some of the other Peanuts classics, this one stands up with the rest of them, and surpasses many. The full cast is there, along with Vince Guaraldi's final musical score (he died right after completion of this project).",1015804800,5,249,4.681818181818182
7854408,5,6303864120,"I cannot remember ever seeing this Peanuts video as a kid, but since my son is now thoroughly enjoying his discovery of the Peanuts gang, I purchased this for him to watch. I find that it's now one of my all-time favorite Peanuts videos, a very close second to ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" (the sentimental favorite). Your kids won't even realize that they are learning about Arbor Day or helping preserve green space because the message is so seamlessly integrated into the fun. The plot is simple: the gang decides to turn Charlie Brown's baseball field into a park in honor of Arbor Day. There are so many priceless moments: when Snoopy gets ejected from the library for laughing too hard at doggie obedience texts; Snoopy's fight with the creeping vine; Peppermint Patty's attempt to get Charlie Brown to explain love to her; Lucy's first home run; Patty trying to pitch around a tree that has been planted on the pitcher's mound; Sally's mistaken pronouncement that Arbor Day is ""when all the ships come into the Arbor."" Buy it, watch it, then go out and plant a tree with your kids!",983404800,11,1087,4.696335078534031
7854409,5,6303864120,"I remember when this 1st came out- at 9 years old, I had no idea what Arbor Day was all about (no, it's not ""the day all the ships come sailing into the arbor"", as Sally Brown guesses in class and gets  laughed at!).  Peppermint Patty challenges old Chuck to a game at his new  field, which looks more like a garden than a baseball field (not exactly  Peppermint Patty's idea of a perfect field)!  Lucy makes poor Schroeder  promise her a kiss if she hits a home run!  Note: this was Vince Guaraldi's  final Peanuts score as he would pass away the following year.",958780800,9,563,4.295238095238095
