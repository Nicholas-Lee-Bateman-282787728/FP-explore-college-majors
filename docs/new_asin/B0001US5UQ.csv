8016230,5,B0001US5UQ,"It is probably coincidental that the episodes one any given DVD of a series seem thematically related on other than the most global level. But if I were to name a theme for volume three of Kino's adventures it would be the powers and dangers of imagination. Kino and Hermes serve once again as both observers and occasional actors in the dramas that unfold around them, but this time we will get just a few short glimpses into Kino's own past.

Land of the Wizards is an unusually upbeat tale (for this series) about a young woman who is determined to create a flying machine, Kino lends a hand with the results. The real lesson, though, is embedded in the attitudes of the townsfolk toward the inventor. She goes from 'crackpot' to 'wizard' in their minds, but it never occurs to them that she and they are the same, but that they have accepted limitations she has not.

Continuing this emphasis on imagination, and a corollary concern with judgment, Kino's next trip is to The Land of Books, where you can find all the books that the critics think are 'safe' to read. The culture is oppressive, but even the revolutionaries that Kino joins in with are flawed. The story is haunting, and uncomfortably inconclusive.

The final story ""Tale of the Mechanical Dolls"" is the most piquant. The story uses layers of fantasy to blend a story about robots with a study of the importance of human relationships and the desire to feel needed. The interesting parallels between a partially automated family and Kino's own relationship with Hermes have to make the viewer wonder about the significance of the young girl's journey.

As usual, the episodes are think pieces rather than action adventures. This is an unusual pace of anime, and demonstrates that not every creative urge in the genre is focused on giant robots, magical girls and beautiful boys. Difficult themes can also be approached with the clarity of the serendipitous viewer, inviting us to wonder if we too aren't also Kino.",1103932800,2,1982,4.769679300291545
8016231,3,B0001US5UQ,"The problem with Kino's Journey is that you get one great episode and 2 fair ones on each volume. The quality of writing varies too much. It would be nice if all the episodes could be great. Volume 3 is no exception to this failing.

 In ""Land of Wizards"" Kino and Hermes meet a young woman whose goal in life is to construct a flying machine. All of the townspeople see her as foolish and her ambitions as useless. Their work ethic revolves around farming and anything that does not relate to that is useless. Even her fiance wants her to give up on her dreams and become a normal wife. Kino might be able to help her get her dreams off the ground!

 Kino is told of a ""Land of Books"" by a stranger she helps in a desert and is told that this country holds all the written knowledge of the world. You can only borrow a book from their library if you give them a book of your own in exchange. Kino is surprised when she arrives at the library because it is very small and doesn't have a lot of holdings. She learns that in the Castle above the town, critics decide which books are ""safe"" and which are ""unsafe"" and thereby dangerous. These unsafe books are closeted in the Castle and are not allowed to be read. Kino soon becomes involved in a resistance movement, a band of amateur revolutionaries who wish to change things.

 The last episode, ""A Tale of Mechanical Dolls"" is the great episode on this volume. While wandering in the forest, Kino and Hermes are invited to the home of a mechanical android who looks for all the world like an ancient old lady. The android serves a husband and wife and their child as their maid. Kino begins to wonder what the truth of things are when she notices that the family doesn't eat food, but just throws it away, and seem to repeat stock phrases. It was a great Twilight Zone-like episode that had some eerieness to it and raised some interesting questions about life.

 I enjoyed the last episode the most. While the other two episodes were fair, they seemed to me a little contrived and cliched. They preached their message a little too much. The ""Dolls"" episode, on the other hand, raised its issues with story instead of edicts. Still, overall, the series is good and raises some deeper issues than most anime.

 If you like this series I would recommend The Wild One with Marlon Brando, also the story of a rebel and a motorcycle. Golden Boy is another anime about a young guy travelling around on his bike, having adventures. It is a strictly R-rated viewing experience.",1090540800,,2578,4.476495726495727
8016232,5,B0001US5UQ,"The third installment of the Kino's Journey DVDs does not disappoint. We begin with a story about a young girl with a dream, one that has captivated humanity since its very birth, the dream of flight. But she lives in a country where nothing is deemed of worth unless it helps enhance crop yield. This story is told through the girl's point of view, and Kino's involvement is miniscule. This episode is about the indomitable nature of the human spirit, and dreams that won't die. It also lets us know a bit about the world Kino lives in. From the first episode, we'd seen that Kino lived in a world with technological marvels, and yet, we also learn that in this alternate world, flight had not yet been developed.
The second episode is about a country where censorship is law. Books are limited to children's stories and technical manuals. Stories with ""Dangerous ideas"" are forbidden. And stories with interesting characters aren't allowed either, for fear that people will waste their lives pining for fictional characters. Or is it that the critics are locked away to protect the public from their self-important need to rend asunder that which others poured their hearts into? Or is it really that life is a blank book, and we're free to write what we want?
The final episode is somewhat reminiscent of Ray Bradbury's ""I Sing the Body Electric."" Kino and Hermes encounter a woman who claims to be a mechanical doll (robot), and she takes them to her home to meet her ""masters"". It becomes clear quickly to Kino that the masters are the dolls, and the woman is a human. What unfolds is a sad, somber story of love, loss, and a life of service in the name of fullfilment.",1089849600,2,1674,4.63973063973064
8016233,5,B0001US5UQ,"This volume of Kino's Journey borrows slightly from Western-style SF, particularly in the narrative style of Ray Bradbury.  The writers do their usual excellent job, not leaning too hard on their style and letting the stories unfold as they will.
The first episode veers from the usual perspective by giving the first-person narrative to a guest character-- but for this story, it's a plus.  The plot resembles Bradbury's ""The Flying Machine"", in places, but ends somewhat differently.  I've got to say, though, that the character of the town's Chief is a bit too stereotypical and hard-nosed to be realistic.
The second story recalls pieces of Fahrenheit 451, but with the expected twists that are typical of this series.  Incidentally, a piece of Kino's personal history is (possibly) revealed here.
Finally, the last story examines humanity from a nonhuman perspective, in the vein of Bradbury's ""I Sing the Body Electric"" or ""Marionettes Inc."".  I feel that this is probably the weakest of the three on this disc, but we're still talking about Kino's Journey, so the disappointment is minimal.",1088380800,3,1097,5.140449438202247
8016234,5,B0001US5UQ,"Ok, for a Kino's Journey compilation, this isn't the greatest DVD set... but since it IS Kino's Journey, with everything that that implies, I'd give it more of a 4.5 than a 5.
There are three episodes on this disc, none of them much better than mediocre for the series. In the first episode, the entire story is related from someone else's POV, which is a little unusual, but it fits with the story that's being told. There's also the unusual twist of a truly happy ending... not something that happens too often in this show.
The second episode easily had the best concept, dealing with ideas that made novels like Farenheit 451 and 1984 famous -- the idea of censorship for one's own good. However, at the end, the story loses any form of coherence. In it's defence, there a few really deep segments in this episode, most of them coming as individual ""stories"" that somehow connect to the plot. My fave one involved a tank.. but you'll have to watch it!! *wink*
The third episode is the best of the three, regaining some of the promise of the first two Discs of the series. An interesting story, with a subtle twist and a melancholy sort of ending, the formula we've come to know and love!
If you're a fan of Kino's journey, than you'll want to buy this disc, for it's only a slight low point in an otherwise excellent series. If you happened to HATE the first two discs, well you suck. Kidding... but don't try and continue with this one. Looking forward to the next disc now......... and some plot resolution!",1086393600,,1513,4.505454545454546
