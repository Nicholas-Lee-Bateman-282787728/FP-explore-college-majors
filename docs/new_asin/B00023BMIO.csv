8021186,3,B00023BMIO,"Dear Sir:

Pleased to hear you are asking for my comment re my recent purchase from
Amazon. Wish to let you know that one of your DVDs which is a double sided DVD had LOS CHARROS DE ORO and also TU Y LAS NUBES.

LOS CAHRROS DE ORO had Miguel Aceves Mejia and Jorge Negrete, sorry to say Miguel Aceves Mejia does appear in this DVD, only Jorge Negrete. On the flipside of this same DVD is TU Y LAS NUBES, starring Miguel Aceves Mejia. It would have been alright if I did not include TU Y LAS NUBES in this purchase. What has happened now, I have got two (2) DVDs of TU Y LAS NUBES. Please check my list.

Would you be able rectify this error? Kindly let me know.

My comments re the reproduction of the film is more than satisfactory jugding from age of the film.

Best regards,
Jess de Sequera",1217376000,,793,4.090322580645161
8021187,5,B00023BMIO,"Miguel Aceves Mejia and Lola Flores make an incongruous pair in this film that essentially has no plot, other than situations that facilitate a song and a dance to take place. Gervasio (Fernando Soto) loves Rosita (Carmen Flores) who loves Don Miguel (Miguel Aceves Mejia) who loves Dolores (Lola Flores), and Dolores isn't sure who she loves until the last song has been sung. Directed by Miguel Morayta, it has lovely Victor Herrera cinematography of Don Miguel's huge ranch, and there is a scene in a palenque that the squeamish should be warned has a cockfight between song numbers. The film is in quite good condition despite its age (some of the audio is a little deteriorated, but doesn't affect the enjoyment of it) and no subtitles are available.

Miguel Aceves Mejia was one of the great interpreters of ranchera music and was renown for his fabulous falsetto, and though he was never a great actor or riveting screen presence like some of his other singer/actor contemporaries, he made over fifty films in his long career, and passed on to his heavenly reward nine days before his 91st birthday in 2006. Lola Flores gets top billing in this film, and was an international superstar in the 1950's, traveling the world with her flamenco group, and dazzling her audiences with her fiery personality, flashing eyes, and throaty voice (I was fortunate to see her perform in Buenos Aires, and years later in New York City). Her presence is almost too big to be held in by the screen, and in contrast to Mejia, she overpowers the film medium. ""Limosna de Amor"" is riveting. 100% pure gypsy fire, the way flamenco used to be, not the refined stuff of today, and it's worth the price of the film.

The wonderful music of these two legendary stars is what this film is about, and the song list is:
Sung by Miguel Aceves Mejia (with the Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan):
1: ""El Aguacero""
2: ""La Verdolaga""
3: ""Cielito Lindo""
4: ""Un Mundo Raro""
5: ""Tu y las Nubes""
By Lola Flores:
1: ""Coplillas""
2: ""Soleares""
3: ""Espinita""
4: ""Sevillanas"" danced by flamenco group
5: ""Limosna de Amor""",1177632000,4,2082,4.732782369146006
