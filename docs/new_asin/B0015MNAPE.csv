8259092,4,B0015MNAPE,THIS IS A VERY GOOD AND ENTERTAINING MOVIE. THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST VERY  DELIGHTIFUL TO WATCH. AND I REALLY LIKED IT...,1363651200,,121,4.761904761904762
8259093,4,B0015MNAPE,"The appropriatly named 'Kamikaze' was Pride's last and final event. During the Monson/Fujita bout, the announcer stated that this ""Pride v UFC will probably be one in many more to come""..the irony of that statement. Overall the card was fairly entertaining with some quick knockouts and surprise submissions.

The extra's on the DVD include a 'Fighter Photo Montage' which runs about 3mins. There's also a 'Pride Retrospective' which is slightly over 2mins. The two bonus bouts include Butterbean vs Zulu and Edson Draggo vs Yoshihiro 'Kiss' Nakao.",1275436800,,548,5.2988505747126435
8259094,2,B0015MNAPE,"Pride 34 is Prides Last Event, sadly. What is also sad is the event itself. It was put together really quickly (as Pride was gasping for it's last breath) and it was a scramble to find fighters to take part. Great fights were rumored to be on the card before it was actually announced but those fights didn't materialize. As far as the fights go, the Soko fight vs Arona is good and the Thompson v Frye fight is entertaining but that's about it. If it was priced at $9.99, I would say buy it(if you are a Pride fanatic and collect them all)But, if you are an mma fan looking for a dvd of great fights, don't waste your money on this one. It is not worth $17.99. R.I.P Pride FC, thanks for the wonderful memories.",1266364800,,712,4.204379562043796
8259095,3,B0015MNAPE,"I know retail DVD releases are normally edited from original broadcasts but this DVD is extremely different from the original PPV broadcast I watched. It's obvious that Zuffa who purchased Pride just didn't care about releasing the footage of Pride's great send off because they really cut out just about all the footage aside from the actual fights.

The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the main event between Kazuyuki Fujita and Jeff Monson isn't bad and the fight with James Thompson vs. Don Frye maybe a nightmare as far as technical fighting skills go it's certainly entertaining. Also includes Sokoudjou's 2nd big upset in a row.

If you have a video store where you can rent this DVD it's worth it to see some decent fights but I wouldn't recommend buying this.
The only real reason I could think of anyone purchasing this DVD is because it was the last Pride event ever.",1243036800,,887,4.643312101910828
8259096,3,B0015MNAPE,"Pride 34 consisted of 8 fights all ending in the first round! Like the other reviewer, I don't get why they just didn't put all 8 matches in the main show instead of removing 2 and putting them in the special features. The 6 fight event equals a total of 52 minutes!(Wow thats short compared to the other Pride events) With the other 2 matches, it reached 71 minutes. I believe this has to be one of the shortest Pride events ever. Don't let it fool you though, the pace is set extremely high for every fight and we got to witness the biggest upset of the night and an all out brawl between Thompson and Frye. Reason I gave this dvd 3 stars is because it lacks everything the previous Pride dvd's had(exclude Shockwave 2006) like interviews, fighter entrance highlights and all that good stuff. Its still worth picking up if you are a diehard MMA fan.

8259097,4,B0015MNAPE,"Once again, we have a new PRIDE FC DVD released with numerous errors that should have been caught in the early stages of production.  Check my review of PRIDE FC Shockwave 2006 to see those errors.  Many of the same errors have happened once again as well as ones that are even worse.

The PRIDE 34 show itself is entertaining, but not one of the best ones out there.  I wouldn't recommend the event to casual MMA fans, and would only expect hardcore MMA or PRIDE FC fans to pick this one up.

Now we come to the mistakes:

1. Once again, instead of just putting all 8 fights together, they put two of them away in the ""Special Features"" section of the DVD.  It's not that big of a deal, but it's still a whole lot nicer to hit ""Play Event"" and watch all the fights instead of 6 of them.  I still just don't understand the reason to remove matches to a different part of the DVD.  They also list one of the two matches put in the ""Special Features"" on the Fightcard lineup on the back cover and insert.  Why is one listed, but not the other?

2. They have miss-spelled TWO fighter's names this time.  The first one is very obvious, and is on the back cover as well as the insert.  Edson Drago has his name spelled correctly in the Fightcard lineup, but they miss-spell it as ""Draggo"" in the Special Features.  I also believe they miss-spelled it the same way when playing the DVD.  The second fighter to have his name miss-spelled is Zelg Galesic.  They replace the ""L"" in his first name with an ""I"" on the back cover and the insert.  It isn't very obvious as some L's can look like I's.  His name is correct on the DVD.

3. Why are they listing a match that isn't on the card?  Wagner De Conciecao Martins Vs. Kazuhiro Nakamura are listed on the back cover and insert, yet that fight was never on PRIDE 34.  In fact, that fight has never happened.  Wagner De Conciecao Martins is also known as Zuluzinho which is usually shortened to Zulu.  Zulu faced Butterbean who's real name is Eric Esch.  Zakuhiro Nakamura isn't on the card and doesn't go by any other names, so why is he listed as facing Zulu?  Butterbean Vs. Zuluzinho is listed under the ""Special Features"" so why couldn't they get that correct on the Fightcard lineup?

NOTE: Kazuhiro Nakamura is also listed as an actor in Amazon's product listing for this item.

4. The insert seems to be where most of the mistakes occur.  Most have been mentioned previously.  This is where two of the most blatant errors occur.  The first is a complete line of text.  It's easier to just type it up as it appears.

""This is Shockwave 2006! Featuring top-rated fighters fedor emelianenko, Takanori Gomi, mauricio 'shogun' rua and the highly-anticipated rematch between josh barnett and antonio rodrigo nogueira.""

Yes, you read that right!  This is not Shockwave 2006, and none of those fighters are even on PRIDE 34.  Did you noticed that the names are not capitalized?

5. The second blatant error on the insert is that they list a PRIDE Heavyweight Championship Bout between the champion, Kazuyuki Fujita and the challenger, Jeff Monson.  Granted, these two men did fight in the main event, but it was not a PRIDE Heavyweight Championship bout and Kazuyuki Fujita is not the champion.

The big question is who is editing these DVDs?  Seriously?!  How can there be so many mistakes?  I almost feel like these are intentionally done because mistakes like these don't happen twice.  I can only hope that the release of PRIDE 33 in July will not have these mistakes as well, but the third time's a charm, right?

At least the event itself, the most important part of the DVD, is intact.  That is why people will choose to buy this DVD, with or without the mistakes.",1212192000,3,3712,4.484304932735426
8259098,4,B0015MNAPE,"PRIDE 34: KAMIKAZE was PRIDE's bow-out as one of the premier MMA organizations in the world. Recently bought out by the rival UFC, its best fighters have been cherry-picked by that organization, its website is now a shill for UFC/WEC propaganda, and it may never host another event. However, during its glory days it was (for my money) the best mixed martial arts organization in the world, and while this was far from its best card, it featured some very entertaining bouts. The lineup was:

Yoshiro Nakao vs. Edson Drago
Butterbean vs. Zuluzhino
Makoto Mahimota vs. Zelg Galesic
Gilbert Yvel vs. Akira Shoji
Don ""the Predator"" Frye vs. James Thompson
Shinya Aoki vs Brian Lo-A-Njoe
Ricardo Arona vs Sokoudjou
Kazuyuki Fujita vs Jeff Monson

Some people criticized the card as lacking in big names. Not sure what the hell they're talking about, because Gilbert Yvel, Don Frye, James Thompson, Ricardo Arona, Sokoudjou, Fujita and Monson are all either world-class or in the general vicinity thereof. It's true Frye, a former UFC champion, is long in the tooth, but he and fellow tough-b*stard Thompson conspired to put on the best fight of the night, a brutal slugfest that started during the staredown and went full-speed until the stoppage conclusion.

I hope PRIDE oneday manages to re-emerge in something resembling its old form, but if it doesn't, wars like the afformentioned Frye - Thompson and knockouts like the one that ended Arona - Sokoudjou will make me remember it fondly.",1210291200,4,1487,4.987903225806452
