3035724,3,B000YV1Q2G,"Griffin Dunne was nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Action Short for ""Duke of Groove"" in 1995.  Whether it's a screenplay that bounces like a ping-pong ball or the direction, the film seems to be trying to make the connection that even wealthy families have similarities to primitive civilizations.  Brutality is an aspect of human nature would also sum up much of the film.  The story seems quite unreal and nebulously defined as in the relationship of Donald Sutherland's Ogden C. Osbourne & Diane Lane.  The plot is a cousin to the television series ""Dirty Sexy Money"" in which Sutherland also appeared as a wealthy patriarch.

Anton Yelchin who starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hearts-in-Atlantis/dp/B00005UQ9V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hearts in Atlantis</a>&nbsp;with Anthony Hopkins and ""Charlie Bartlett"" is one of the best things about the film.  His character Finn Earl seems like a teen who is always going to land on his feet and adapt to the many curves life throws at him.  The violation of the boy is so charged that it makes what seemed like a romantic comedy suddenly dark and sinister.  Chris Evans starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cellular-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B0006D3HGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cellular (New Line Platinum Series)</a>, ""The Fantastic Four"" and this year in ""Street Kings.""  His character seems warm and happy-go-lucky until we come to see the darker side.  Evans never fully took me to the dark side or made me believe he was capable of the acts on which the film hinges.  He was much better in the comic romantic aspect of the film.  Diane Lane is so beautiful and natural as an actress, but again her casting as a boozy lush never really was believable.  She never took us completely to the dark side.  This is part of the major problem with the film, combining such disparate elements, but not convincingly.

Kristen Stewart who starred with Jodie Foster in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panic-Room/dp/B000XZ5TJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panic Room</a>&nbsp;plays Maya, Osbourne's granddaughter.  She comes across very well in the film as an iconoclast, unimpressed by her family's wealth.  As Finn's summer romance, she seemed quite tender and sincere.  Elizabeth Perkins from TV's ""Weeds"" puts in a good appearance as the wealthy daughter.  The film is interesting.  Donald Sutherland, Diane Lane, Anton Yelchin & Kristen Stewart's performances are worth the rental.  Enjoy!",1213056000,27,2583,5.908355795148248
3035725,2,B000YV1Q2G,"If they gave an Oscar for most contrived story, this film would be a nominee.  The film opens with Finn (Anton Yelchin), the teenage protagonist and narrator, viewing a copy of his father's documentary of a primitive South American tribe whose name translates ""fierce people.""  Finn's father is a noted anthropologist who, after discovering the fierce people, returned to to the States just long enough to deliver a few lectures and impregnate Finn's mother (Diane Lane), then a college student, before returning to the jungles of South America.  Although he never married Finn's mother, Dad has kept in touch with his son, and he has given him the next best thing to a live-in father: a copy of his documentary.  I have read that the book on which this is based puts the story in the late-`70s, which, apparently, accounts for the documentary being in the form of a 16-mm film.  Finn drags documentary and his trusty 16-mm projector with him through the film, drawing upon the documentary for wisdom and strength, or, perhaps, watching it simply because he's as bored with the goings-on around him as I was.  We, too, get to watch stretches of the documentary. The parallels between the primitive fierce people of the documentary and the rich depicted in this film being obvious to anyone with an IQ above 80.

How do Finn and his mother find themselves living among the family of Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland), the seventh richest man in the United States?  Apparently, on the strength of Finn's mother, a masseuse, having worked her magic on Mr. Osborne (or, perhaps, she has her own 16-mm film of those sessions). At any rate, it requires only a phone call from Finn's mother for Mr. Osborne to intercede in a legal problem confronting Finn, and then to whisk mother and son away and ensconce them in an enchanting cottage on his estate.  There, Finn comes among the family Osborne, a cast of characters designed to put an exclamation mark to F.  Scott Fitzgerald's observation that the rich are different.  In the course of all this, Finn encounters romance, sex, and a lot of strange hokem in the woods of the estate (which even at night are extraordinarily well lit); learns the Osborne family's secret; and is sodomized by a mystery assailant whose identity is apparent long before the writers intend it.  Thanks to these experiences, and to the insight gained from watching Dad's documentary, it is a wiser Finn who, with his mother and an escort of the South American fierce people (really!), leaves the Osborne estate at film's end. I didn't believe a minute of it.

I give the film two stars because of Donald Sutherland's presence.  The role of Ogden Osborne doesn't require much of Mr. Sutherland, but watching him on cruise control is more interesting than watching most other actors in overdrive.  I've never been impressed by Diane Lane's performances or with the films in which she has had major roles.  Using Amazon's rating system, I would give her career to date three stars.  Fortunately for her, a three-star actress is an asset in this film.",1212883200,4,3069,4.826335877862595
3035726,2,B000YV1Q2G,"Basically, this movie depicts rich people as incredibly selfish and horrible human beings.  The movie parallels the society of the priveledged to an indigenous tribe (I forget the parallel)... maybe survival of the fittest or something of that nature.  There's drugs, sex (with adults and teenagers), murder, self-mutilation and sodomy of a teenage boy,.... need I say more.  This was a story of a summer vacation gone horribly wrong....why did the family stay?  As soon as this movie was over (I watched the entire film for some reason), I popped in a feel good movie:  ""P.S I Love You"" (which was a much better movie, BTW)",1210550400,5,624,4.849056603773585
3035727,2,B000YV1Q2G,"There was much potential with this cast.  Chris Evans was biggest disappointment, and only reason I bought the DVD.  He should only act with his shirt off, as he did in CELLULAR, wherein his initial shirtlessness and the appearance of Jason Statham carried the rest of the movie.

Not so in FIERCE PEOPLE.  Story meanders and gets lost after pivotal event mid-screenplay.  Ending sucks.",1204588800,6,386,4.96875
3035728,1,B000YV1Q2G,"This movie was awful. The acting was mediocre and there was essentially no plot. It didn't give any real insights into the lives of the rich or the conflict between rich and poor. It did not even work as a believable ""coming of age"" story. The director threw in some some gratuitous drug use and violence, but that was hardly enough to keep my interest. I was glad when the credits started rolling on this one.",1204416000,8,410,4.407894736842105
3035729,2,B000YV1Q2G,Although this movie has some great actors (Sutherland and Diane Lane) it was hard to follow and at times did not make sense.  It was hard to sit thru and times due to it being slow and I had to advance chapters a few times to try and figure out what is going on. My advice is --rent it but do not buy it.  I do not see this as a B movie but not anything more than a C movie. Disappointing dispite the cast.,1203033600,7,406,3.764705882352941
3035730,4,B000YV1Q2G,"From the opening scenes of FIERCE PEOPLE (an interplay of tribal customs as photographed by the anthropologist father of the young narrator Finn Earl, demonstrating why this South American tribe of Ishkanani is so fierce) the direction of the film is nebulous: are we watching a dark comedy about comparing life in the New York streets to uncivilized peoples, or is this a message film of a more serious intent?  But as the story develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear.  Griffin Dunne's direction of Dirk Wittenborn's adaptation of his novel may be a bit careless at times as it strays from rational plot development, but in the end there is a strong enough final impact to patch up the holes he created.

Our narrator Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives with his coke-addicted masseuse/sexually obsessed mother Liz (Diane Lane) in New York, waiting for the summer when he is to join his anthropologist father on a field trip to South America (a father he knows only from letters and videos), when a drug bust abruptly changes their lives: one of Liz's wealthy clients Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland) rescues the down and out family and moves them to his ten acre estate, the epitome of wealth and power. In exchange for being Osborne's private masseuse, Liz and Finn can live in the mansion with the 'filthy rich' Osbornes - daughter Mrs. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and grandchildren Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his physician lead Liz on the drying out path and Finn bonds with Osborne and his grandchildren, and despite the disparity in poor versus wealthy, the living situation works - for a while.  Incidents occur to alter feelings and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked assailant, a turning point for the film and Finn's view of the Osborne family.  Osborne reveals his past to Finn and together they manage to discover the truth about Finn's troubling incident - and also about the fierce disease of the wealthy class.

The film uses many clips of tribal activity during the film, drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the more challenging scenes. For this viewer that works well, but when the director elects to place tribal individuals in full regalia within the context of the Osborne estate, the concept feel contrived, as though the audience has to be forced to 'get it'. The various subplots between maid Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and Finn and the introduction of an obese retarded chalk artist Whitney (Branden Williams) push the credibility edge of emphasizing the line between the wealthy and the 'lower class', but the performances by Sutherland, Lane, and Yelchin are strong enough to make us forgive the film's lapses.  Not a great film but one with a lot of worthy ideas splashed around on the screen of a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction.

3035841,5,B000YV1Q2G,"I enjoyed Fierce People. The film has an impressive cast and it quickly grabs your attention. The film's characters are smart and articulate and the story doesn't stick to the usual Hollywood rules. The main protagonist is Finn, a precocious, but underprivileged 15 year old who spends his summer with the Osbourne family. Donald Sutherland plays the patriarch, Ogden C. Osborne, the seventh richest man in America. Diane Lane plays Finn's mother, a friend of Ogden who is also a habitual cocaine user and a slut. The Osbournes own a large estate and seems to live by their own rules. At first they seem charming and sophisticated but the film implies that the super-rich are different. They are used to getting their own way.

The film is enjoyable mainly because it has crisp intelligent dialog, superb acting and a story which takes unexpected turns. It is also an R rated movie, so it's not wholesome. Anton Yelchin is believable and sympathetic in the demanding role of Finn. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. Chris Evans is impressive as Osbourne's duplicitous and devious grandson.

Why does FIERCE PEOPLE keep drawing me back? Like the bulls-eye target of a man just learning to shootthe entire surface (except for dead center) riddled with holesthe film is everywhere riddled with glitches you would not believe. Almost every fault a film can have, this one has. As one reviewer, Grady Harp, observed, the film is a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction.

Oh, a romantic comedy. No, this is a coming-of-age story. The unexpected violence is shocking, and suddenly you are lost and afraid in something dark and deep.

The acting is superb. How this talented cast managed it, in circumstances that must have been supremely challenging, Ill never know: the stunning work of Donald Sutherland and Diane Lane, the brilliant performance of Anton Yelchin (still a teenager when this film was made in 2008), flawless characterizations by Chris Evans, Kristen Stewart, Paz de la Huerta, Blu Mankuma, Elizabeth Perkins.

In FIERCE PEOPLE, there is much to see, to sort out, to admire, to hate, to ridicule, to rail at, to think about. It is like a broken kaleidoscope, held up to the sun, the colors jumbled and wild. No symmetrical pattern could ever appear, but still you keep twisting and turning the tube, because",1384905600,,1585,4.666666666666667

Fine acting by Sutherland, Lane and Yelchin and Stewart, as well as many others.
This boy turning into man, and his messed up mother who pulls herself together under strange circumstances, are uplifting for me.
Not that I share(d) their personal experiences in this movie, but that they portrayed them SO well, you got the lessons - right in your face - and just had to deal with them.
Seems to me that is the only way I have truly ever learned anything.  The hard way.  So, for that - and several other reasons - I highly recommend this movie.
It IS an adult movie, I would think, regardless of the youth of some of the characters.  It isn't all about rich vs poor either.
It is about Life, and how we cope, how we learn, and how we move on from tragedy or unhappy circumstances.

I would like to be a more erudite reviewer, but I'm just me ...  Give this movie a chance.  With good fortune, you will learn something also.

3035893,5,B000YV1Q2G,"Kristen Stewart appears in one of her earlier roles in this riveting drama about the price of wealth that also features Donald Sutherland in one of his finest performances.

The story revolves around the son of an anthropologists who rather than spending time with his father in South America doing anthropological study of the Ishkanani tribe, which was what he wanted, being coerced by his mother to spend time with a wealthy businessman who owns a private island and was her client when she was providing physical therapy through the use of massage.

Her son reaches the conclusion that his mother is being paid to engage in sexual intercourse with her wealthy patron, and that he has intentions towards his mother until he drops his pants before the masseuse's son and explains to him that after he had his balls surgical removed in an operation, he attempted to commit suicide given the fact that he had lost his manhood, and that his masseuse had treated him to such a heavenly massage that he had regain an interest in life. And, to evade the punishment his mother had established for him by way of chores, he approaches the multi-millionaire to secure a job, which he succeeds in doing, and, in so doing, develops a close relationship with his mother's patron, who chooses him to participate in a balloon race as his partner - a role which has traditionally been allocated for the millionaire's grandson, thereby, inducing a sense of jealousy and incurring the wrath of his mother's patron's son. The latter, then, forcefully sodomizes him in an act of revenge that leaves him deeply humiliated and bent on revenge, in the same manner that the tribe of Ishkanani, also known as the ""Fierce People"" in the movie, would when some has stolen their spirit, almost emptying a gun point blank at the heir of the his mother's patron before changing his mind and hurling the gun away.

The main theme of the movie is the price of wealth and how the ruthless pursuit of wealth has its price and corrupting influence.

It was clear to me when the native guy who appeared in Finn's dreams was speaking tagalog, I'm filipino so I would have noticed.

3035906,4,B000YV1Q2G,"A professionally trained, very presentable massage therapist (Diane Lane) is raising a son (Anton Yelchin) in New York City. Unfortunately, she also has a bit of a cocaine habit, in addition to a general inability to create a stable environment.

The morning prior to her son's departure to spend summer vacation with his award-winning anthropologist biological father in the depths of the Amazon, she sends him to fetch a recreational amount of her favorite drug. Inconveniently, he gets busted.

To save him from the NYC court system, she calls in a favor from a multi-billionaire client (Donald Sutherland) who makes the charges 'go away' in exchange for becoming his live-in massuese [1]. Now her son will now find anthropological inspiration among a tribe of decadent one-percenters, instead of a tribe of head-hunters. He will discover many similarities. . .

Donald Sutherland plays his role as the warm and approachable control-freak patriarch of 'VlyValle' with precision. Anton Yelchin handles his fairly difficult role with competence.

Diane Lane's performance struck me as tragic. Not because I didn't like it - because I did - but because she seems to be as talented at making any role look good, as she is at finding good projects that release at bad times [2]. I wonder how the film might have fared if it had been released in 2010 or '11? A story about a mother and son losing the thread of civilization & struggling to find it again, on a billionaire's estate might have been recieved better.

[1] It's interesting that many reviewers have no problem with ridiculously corrupt details like this, yet bristle and whine about portraying the rich as anything less than saintly... 'Stockholm Syndrome' anyone?

I will be honest with you...I didn't think I liked it at first. The movie in its entirety isn't exactly my cup of tea. But for me, it's really about the moments and relationships within the story that make it or break it.

I do pay attention to detail, but in order for me to really feel the personality of a film, I rediscover it a few times. Upon viewing it a second time, I grew quite fond of Kristen Stewart's character. There is a realness and attractiveness about her that I find intriguing.

There is a rape scene, which is painful to watch, as are all rape scenes, however it is not distasteful or too graphic.

3035914,3,B000YV1Q2G,"This film fails to live up to its potential.  In the beginning, you see a vivid portrait of a life unravelling in addiction and emotional neglect.  The son, Finn, was planing to work with his father (whose only contact with him is through the films he made) in the Amazon rain forest, with the ""fierce people"" of the title.  Unfortunately, while scoring coke for his mom, he is busted and cannot go.  This is a shock to his mother,  who decides to turn her life around and become a better mother.

They wind up, improbably, in the massive estate of Osborne, many of whose children and grandchildren have the run of his 10-mile square New Jersey estate.  Beyond the mother's sobering up and quitting coke, played wonderfully by Lane, there are some very interesting subplots:  Finn develops a wonderfully believable relationship with Osborne, who mentors him in some vital life lessons.  Sutherland was never better, as a quirky and warm man who cares and yet is also very tough.  Ruler of the roost, he hopes to create a better world somehow, in his private kingdom.  Finn also studies his father's films, which provide a wonderful sub-narrative to his observations of the huge family culture he is observing.  Finally, he mingles with the locals and to a degree is accepted by them, though remains fully aware that he can never be one of them.

Unfortunately, the film unravels with Finn's relationships with Osborne's grandchildren.  He finds a beautiful, sensitive girl of course, and their path is ridiculously predictable, if occasionally poignant.  While Kristen Stewart succeeds in evoking some of the psychological trouble that underlies her character, the character is essentially a cute stick figure.  Finn also becomes friends with the outgoing though mysterious grandson, whose evolution is also a bit far fetched and laughably melodramatic.  Then the plot thickens in a ruinous direction, which I do not want to spoil for others, and ends sentimentally if tragically.  If the film had ended 2/3 of the way through, it would easily have gotten 5 stars.

Recommended with these caveats.  The acting in my viewing is far better than average, but the script in the end is weak.",1251244800,3,2186,4.936986301369863
3035915,5,B000YV1Q2G,"It is easy not to like ""Fierce People"". For starters, it doesn't know what it wants to be. The first 3/5 are some sort of a ""Coming of Age story meets Robert Altman"" kind of deal, and then it gets dark, really dark, and turns into a very dark Coming of Age story. The movie is unsure which one it really wishes to be, and none of those themes are fully realized.

And yet the five stars, yes. There are two reasons for this.

The first one is that ""Fierce People"" doesn't deserve a three-star rating. It deserves at least four.

The second are the leading cast. Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland are superb, even if they don't really have much to play. Anton Yelchin is the true star of the movie and - just like anything else he's been in - he does a wonderful job. His character Finn is smart and naive, lively and contemplative, and also sort of dense. That is, until he is forced to grow up fast and deal with a trauma that could haunt him for life if he lets it. Yelchin has some really tough dramatic moments to pull through, and he is brilliant in them.

There is a certain subtlety in the movie. You can't really say it tries to *tell* you anything, but it is not empty either. This is where the ""Robert Altman"" part kicks in, and even if ""Fierce People"" is not on this level, it still manages to speak without saying things outright. It has its flaws, and this lack of clarity is a deffinite one in the end, but it's far from stupid. Like I said at the beginning, the movie is unsure of what it is trying to be, but what it ends up being, is good enough, and the acting is amazing.

If that is enough for you, go ahead.

Oh, and the cover is ridiculous. It makes ""Fierce People"" look like a romantic comedy. It's not. It's anything but romantic comedy.",1244851200,17,1760,4.207715133531157

3035917,2,B000YV1Q2G,"This is an uneven film.  The first half is pleasant enough, but the plot develops so slowly as to go virtually nowhere.  Then the movie takes a sudden dark turn, and though it held my attention from here out, it seemed too different, almost like watching a separate movie.  The film has some fine moments of insights and sentiments, and it also contains moments that feel contrived and forced.  High caliber actors did their usual fine job, but most of the characters are presented superficially.  The attempt to draw parallels to an indigenous South American tribe with the assembled characters is marginal at best.  This is a mixed movie for me; two and a half stars right down the middle, but not a twinkle more; they could have and should have done a better job.",1237852800,3,766,4.637037037037037
3035918,4,B000YV1Q2G,"I quite liked this movie about a young boy and his drug addict mother who are befriended by one of the seven wealthiest men in the nation (Donald Sutherland). Finn (Anton Yelchin, a wonderful actor who I've loved in everything that I've ever seen him in, starting with Huff and moving on to House of D) and his mother, played by Diane Lane, leave the jungle of New York to go to the seeming tranquility of a massive palatial estate in New Jersey for the summer.

Initially, Finn is disappointed because he had wanted to spend the summer with his elusive father, an anthropologist studying tribal behavior in South America, whom Finn has never met.  But he soon warms to the scenery when he meets young Maya, the granddaughter of the multi billionaire patriarch.

Basically, the movie draws a parallel between the tribe that Finn's father has studied and the actions of the rich and callous.  In polite society, it's hard for Finn to know who his friends really are, and one person is as vicious and savage as one could possibly imagine.

It's some of those particularly brutal scenes that I found implausible based on the simple story of poor boy meets rich girl.  However, the acting by Sutherland and Yelchin is great and I liked the movie altogether, although it was a bit disjointed, hard to follow at times and the ending was predictable.",1230249600,6,1343,4.669491525423729
3270221,3,B000YV1Q2G,"Griffin Dunne was nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Action Short for ""Duke of Groove"" in 1995.  Whether it's a screenplay that bounces like a ping-pong ball or the direction, the film seems to be trying to make the connection that even wealthy families have similarities to primitive civilizations.  Brutality is an aspect of human nature would also sum up much of the film.  The story seems quite unreal and nebulously defined as in the relationship of Donald Sutherland's Ogden C. Osbourne & Diane Lane.  The plot is a cousin to the television series ""Dirty Sexy Money"" in which Sutherland also appeared as a wealthy patriarch.

Anton Yelchin who starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hearts-in-Atlantis/dp/B00005UQ9V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hearts in Atlantis</a>&nbsp;with Anthony Hopkins and ""Charlie Bartlett"" is one of the best things about the film.  His character Finn Earl seems like a teen who is always going to land on his feet and adapt to the many curves life throws at him.  The violation of the boy is so charged that it makes what seemed like a romantic comedy suddenly dark and sinister.  Chris Evans starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cellular-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B0006D3HGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cellular (New Line Platinum Series)</a>, ""The Fantastic Four"" and this year in ""Street Kings.""  His character seems warm and happy-go-lucky until we come to see the darker side.  Evans never fully took me to the dark side or made me believe he was capable of the acts on which the film hinges.  He was much better in the comic romantic aspect of the film.  Diane Lane is so beautiful and natural as an actress, but again her casting as a boozy lush never really was believable.  She never took us completely to the dark side.  This is part of the major problem with the film, combining such disparate elements, but not convincingly.

Kristen Stewart who starred with Jodie Foster in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panic-Room/dp/B000XZ5TJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panic Room</a>&nbsp;plays Maya, Osbourne's granddaughter.  She comes across very well in the film as an iconoclast, unimpressed by her family's wealth.  As Finn's summer romance, she seemed quite tender and sincere.  Elizabeth Perkins from TV's ""Weeds"" puts in a good appearance as the wealthy daughter.  The film is interesting.  Donald Sutherland, Diane Lane, Anton Yelchin & Kristen Stewart's performances are worth the rental.  Enjoy!",1213056000,27,2583,5.908355795148248
3270222,2,B000YV1Q2G,"If they gave an Oscar for most contrived story, this film would be a nominee.  The film opens with Finn (Anton Yelchin), the teenage protagonist and narrator, viewing a copy of his father's documentary of a primitive South American tribe whose name translates ""fierce people.""  Finn's father is a noted anthropologist who, after discovering the fierce people, returned to to the States just long enough to deliver a few lectures and impregnate Finn's mother (Diane Lane), then a college student, before returning to the jungles of South America.  Although he never married Finn's mother, Dad has kept in touch with his son, and he has given him the next best thing to a live-in father: a copy of his documentary.  I have read that the book on which this is based puts the story in the late-`70s, which, apparently, accounts for the documentary being in the form of a 16-mm film.  Finn drags documentary and his trusty 16-mm projector with him through the film, drawing upon the documentary for wisdom and strength, or, perhaps, watching it simply because he's as bored with the goings-on around him as I was.  We, too, get to watch stretches of the documentary. The parallels between the primitive fierce people of the documentary and the rich depicted in this film being obvious to anyone with an IQ above 80.

How do Finn and his mother find themselves living among the family of Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland), the seventh richest man in the United States?  Apparently, on the strength of Finn's mother, a masseuse, having worked her magic on Mr. Osborne (or, perhaps, she has her own 16-mm film of those sessions). At any rate, it requires only a phone call from Finn's mother for Mr. Osborne to intercede in a legal problem confronting Finn, and then to whisk mother and son away and ensconce them in an enchanting cottage on his estate.  There, Finn comes among the family Osborne, a cast of characters designed to put an exclamation mark to F.  Scott Fitzgerald's observation that the rich are different.  In the course of all this, Finn encounters romance, sex, and a lot of strange hokem in the woods of the estate (which even at night are extraordinarily well lit); learns the Osborne family's secret; and is sodomized by a mystery assailant whose identity is apparent long before the writers intend it.  Thanks to these experiences, and to the insight gained from watching Dad's documentary, it is a wiser Finn who, with his mother and an escort of the South American fierce people (really!), leaves the Osborne estate at film's end. I didn't believe a minute of it.

I give the film two stars because of Donald Sutherland's presence.  The role of Ogden Osborne doesn't require much of Mr. Sutherland, but watching him on cruise control is more interesting than watching most other actors in overdrive.  I've never been impressed by Diane Lane's performances or with the films in which she has had major roles.  Using Amazon's rating system, I would give her career to date three stars.  Fortunately for her, a three-star actress is an asset in this film.",1212883200,4,3069,4.826335877862595
3270223,2,B000YV1Q2G,"Basically, this movie depicts rich people as incredibly selfish and horrible human beings.

This was a story of a summer vacation gone horribly wrong....why did the family stay?

3270227,4,B000YV1Q2G,"From the opening scenes of FIERCE PEOPLE (an interplay of tribal customs as photographed by the anthropologist father of the young narrator Finn Earl, demonstrating why this South American tribe of Ishkanani is so fierce) the direction of the film is nebulous: are we watching a dark comedy about comparing life in the New York streets to uncivilized peoples, or is this a message film of a more serious intent?  But as the story develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear.  Griffin Dunne's direction of Dirk Wittenborn's adaptation of his novel may be a bit careless at times as it strays from rational plot development, but in the end there is a strong enough final impact to patch up the holes he created.

Our narrator Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives with his coke-addicted masseuse/sexually obsessed mother Liz (Diane Lane) in New York, waiting for the summer when he is to join his anthropologist father on a field trip to South America (a father he knows only from letters and videos), when a drug bust abruptly changes their lives: one of Liz's wealthy clients Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland) rescues the down and out family and moves them to his ten acre estate, the epitome of wealth and power. In exchange for being Osborne's private masseuse, Liz and Finn can live in the mansion with the 'filthy rich' Osbornes - daughter Mrs. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and grandchildren Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his physician lead Liz on the drying out path and Finn bonds with Osborne and his grandchildren, and despite the disparity in poor versus wealthy, the living situation works - for a while.  Incidents occur to alter feelings and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked assailant, a turning point for the film and Finn's view of the Osborne family.  Osborne reveals his past to Finn and together they manage to discover the truth about Finn's troubling incident - and also about the fierce disease of the wealthy class.

The film uses many clips of tribal activity during the film, drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the more challenging scenes. For this viewer that works well, but when the director elects to place tribal individuals in full regalia within the context of the Osborne estate, the concept feel contrived, as though the audience has to be forced to 'get it'. The various subplots between maid Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and Finn and the introduction of an obese retarded chalk artist Whitney (Branden Williams) push the credibility edge of emphasizing the line between the wealthy and the 'lower class', but the performances by Sutherland, Lane, and Yelchin are strong enough to make us forgive the film's lapses.  Not a great film but one with a lot of worthy ideas splashed around on the screen of a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction.

3270338,5,B000YV1Q2G,"I enjoyed Fierce People. The film has an impressive cast and it quickly grabs your attention. The film's characters are smart and articulate and the story doesn't stick to the usual Hollywood rules. The main protagonist is Finn, a precocious, but underprivileged 15 year old who spends his summer with the Osbourne family. Donald Sutherland plays the patriarch, Ogden C. Osborne, the seventh richest man in America. Diane Lane plays Finn's mother, a friend of Ogden who is also a habitual cocaine user and a slut. The Osbournes own a large estate and seems to live by their own rules. At first they seem charming and sophisticated but the film implies that the super-rich are different. They are used to getting their own way.

The film is enjoyable mainly because it has crisp intelligent dialog, superb acting and a story which takes unexpected turns. It is also an R rated movie, so it's not wholesome. Anton Yelchin is believable and sympathetic in the demanding role of Finn. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. Chris Evans is impressive as Osbourne's duplicitous and devious grandson. Kristen Stewart is good as the pretty grand daughter. High quality movie.",1426896000,,1178,4.979695431472082

The third viewing came as a surprise to merarely do I see a film three times. Then four, five. Ive seen the film at least a dozen times, and I will see it again.

Why does FIERCE PEOPLE keep drawing me back? Like the bulls-eye target of a man just learning to shootthe entire surface (except for dead center) riddled with holesthe film is everywhere riddled with glitches you would not believe. Almost every fault a film can have, this one has. As one reviewer, Grady Harp, observed, the film is a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction.

Oh, a romantic comedy. No, this is a coming-of-age story. The unexpected violence is shocking, and suddenly you are lost and afraid in something dark and deep.

The acting is superb. How this talented cast managed it, in circumstances that must have been supremely challenging, Ill never know: the stunning work of Donald Sutherland and Diane Lane, the brilliant performance of Anton Yelchin (still a teenager when this film was made in 2008), flawless characterizations by Chris Evans, Kristen Stewart, Paz de la Huerta, Blu Mankuma, Elizabeth Perkins.

In FIERCE PEOPLE, there is much to see, to sort out, to admire, to hate, to ridicule, to rail at, to think about. It is like a broken kaleidoscope, held up to the sun, the colors jumbled and wild. No symmetrical pattern could ever appear, but still you keep twisting and turning the tube, because",1384905600,,1585,4.666666666666667

Fine acting by Sutherland, Lane and Yelchin and Stewart, as well as many others.
This boy turning into man, and his messed up mother who pulls herself together under strange circumstances, are uplifting for me.
Not that I share(d) their personal experiences in this movie, but that they portrayed them SO well, you got the lessons - right in your face - and just had to deal with them.
Seems to me that is the only way I have truly ever learned anything.  The hard way.  So, for that - and several other reasons - I highly recommend this movie.
It IS an adult movie, I would think, regardless of the youth of some of the characters.  It isn't all about rich vs poor either.
It is about Life, and how we cope, how we learn, and how we move on from tragedy or unhappy circumstances.

I would like to be a more erudite reviewer, but I'm just me ...  Give this movie a chance.  With good fortune, you will learn something also.

3270390,5,B000YV1Q2G,"Kristen Stewart appears in one of her earlier roles in this riveting drama about the price of wealth that also features Donald Sutherland in one of his finest performances.

The story revolves around the son of an anthropologists who rather than spending time with his father in South America doing anthropological study of the Ishkanani tribe, which was what he wanted, being coerced by his mother to spend time with a wealthy businessman who owns a private island and was her client when she was providing physical therapy through the use of massage.

Her son reaches the conclusion that his mother is being paid to engage in sexual intercourse with her wealthy patron, and that he has intentions towards his mother until he drops his pants before the masseuse's son and explains to him that after he had his balls surgical removed in an operation, he attempted to commit suicide given the fact that he had lost his manhood, and that his masseuse had treated him to such a heavenly massage that he had regain an interest in life. And, to evade the punishment his mother had established for him by way of chores, he approaches the multi-millionaire to secure a job, which he succeeds in doing, and, in so doing, develops a close relationship with his mother's patron, who chooses him to participate in a balloon race as his partner - a role which has traditionally been allocated for the millionaire's grandson, thereby, inducing a sense of jealousy and incurring the wrath of his mother's patron's son. The latter, then, forcefully sodomizes him in an act of revenge that leaves him deeply humiliated and bent on revenge, in the same manner that the tribe of Ishkanani, also known as the ""Fierce People"" in the movie, would when some has stolen their spirit, almost emptying a gun point blank at the heir of the his mother's patron before changing his mind and hurling the gun away.

The main theme of the movie is the price of wealth and how the ruthless pursuit of wealth has its price and corrupting influence.

The morning prior to her son's departure to spend summer vacation with his award-winning anthropologist biological father in the depths of the Amazon, she sends him to fetch a recreational amount of her favorite drug. Inconveniently, he gets busted.

To save him from the NYC court system, she calls in a favor from a multi-billionaire client (Donald Sutherland) who makes the charges 'go away' in exchange for becoming his live-in massuese [1]. Now her son will now find anthropological inspiration among a tribe of decadent one-percenters, instead of a tribe of head-hunters. He will discover many similarities. . .

Donald Sutherland plays his role as the warm and approachable control-freak patriarch of 'VlyValle' with precision. Anton Yelchin handles his fairly difficult role with competence.

Diane Lane's performance struck me as tragic. Not because I didn't like it - because I did - but because she seems to be as talented at making any role look good, as she is at finding good projects that release at bad times [2]. I wonder how the film might have fared if it had been released in 2010 or '11? A story about a mother and son losing the thread of civilization & struggling to find it again, on a billionaire's estate might have been recieved better.

[1] It's interesting that many reviewers have no problem with ridiculously corrupt details like this, yet bristle and whine about portraying the rich as anything less than saintly... 'Stockholm Syndrome' anyone?

3270406,3,B000YV1Q2G,"Every now and then, I come across a movie that I must watch at least twice before I can determine where I stand with it. This is one of those films.

I will be honest with you...I didn't think I liked it at first. The movie in its entirety isn't exactly my cup of tea. But for me, it's really about the moments and relationships within the story that make it or break it.

I do pay attention to detail, but in order for me to really feel the personality of a film, I rediscover it a few times. Upon viewing it a second time, I grew quite fond of Kristen Stewart's character. There is a realness and attractiveness about her that I find intriguing.

Although I may not be too engrossed in the overall story of the film, I find myself still watching in hopes of seeing her again. I might go so far as to say that if it weren't for her character and her impact on the film, I would not be interested in this movie.",1282262400,4,911,4.078212290502793

3270408,5,B000YV1Q2G,"This movie struck me from the first time I saw it, as being a cut above.  The actors are beautiful to watch, the scenery as well is lush and mesmerizing.  I liked the story of the not so well off mother and son spending the summer with the fabulously wealthy on a 10 square mile estate, and the twists and turns keep you guessing.  There is a rape scene, which is painful to watch, as are all rape scenes, however it is not distasteful or too graphic.  Also, any movie where Billie Holiday is mentioned has a special place in my heart.  A little coming of age, a little look into the divide between the rich and poor which blurs but is still there in personal and intimate relationships, entertaining, harsh, and real.",1279497600,3,718,4.368421052631579

I recommend it if you want to lose yourself in a rather small movie with a big message.",1253404800,3,348,4.132352941176471
3270411,3,B000YV1Q2G,"This film fails to live up to its potential.  In the beginning, you see a vivid portrait of a life unravelling in addiction and emotional neglect.  The son, Finn, was planing to work with his father (whose only contact with him is through the films he made) in the Amazon rain forest, with the ""fierce people"" of the title.  Unfortunately, while scoring coke for his mom, he is busted and cannot go.  This is a shock to his mother,  who decides to turn her life around and become a better mother.

They wind up, improbably, in the massive estate of Osborne, many of whose children and grandchildren have the run of his 10-mile square New Jersey estate.  Beyond the mother's sobering up and quitting coke, played wonderfully by Lane, there are some very interesting subplots:  Finn develops a wonderfully believable relationship with Osborne, who mentors him in some vital life lessons.  Sutherland was never better, as a quirky and warm man who cares and yet is also very tough.  Ruler of the roost, he hopes to create a better world somehow, in his private kingdom.  Finn also studies his father's films, which provide a wonderful sub-narrative to his observations of the huge family culture he is observing.  Finally, he mingles with the locals and to a degree is accepted by them, though remains fully aware that he can never be one of them.

Unfortunately, the film unravels with Finn's relationships with Osborne's grandchildren.  He finds a beautiful, sensitive girl of course, and their path is ridiculously predictable, if occasionally poignant.  While Kristen Stewart succeeds in evoking some of the psychological trouble that underlies her character, the character is essentially a cute stick figure.  Finn also becomes friends with the outgoing though mysterious grandson, whose evolution is also a bit far fetched and laughably melodramatic.  Then the plot thickens in a ruinous direction, which I do not want to spoil for others, and ends sentimentally if tragically.  If the film had ended 2/3 of the way through, it would easily have gotten 5 stars.

Recommended with these caveats.  The acting in my viewing is far better than average, but the script in the end is weak.",1251244800,3,2186,4.936986301369863
3270412,5,B000YV1Q2G,"It is easy not to like ""Fierce People"". For starters, it doesn't know what it wants to be. The first 3/5 are some sort of a ""Coming of Age story meets Robert Altman"" kind of deal, and then it gets dark, really dark, and turns into a very dark Coming of Age story. The movie is unsure which one it really wishes to be, and none of those themes are fully realized.

And yet the five stars, yes. There are two reasons for this.

The first one is that ""Fierce People"" doesn't deserve a three-star rating. It deserves at least four.

The second are the leading cast. Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland are superb, even if they don't really have much to play. Anton Yelchin is the true star of the movie and - just like anything else he's been in - he does a wonderful job. His character Finn is smart and naive, lively and contemplative, and also sort of dense. That is, until he is forced to grow up fast and deal with a trauma that could haunt him for life if he lets it. Yelchin has some really tough dramatic moments to pull through, and he is brilliant in them.

There is a certain subtlety in the movie. You can't really say it tries to *tell* you anything, but it is not empty either. This is where the ""Robert Altman"" part kicks in, and even if ""Fierce People"" is not on this level, it still manages to speak without saying things outright. It has its flaws, and this lack of clarity is a deffinite one in the end, but it's far from stupid. Like I said at the beginning, the movie is unsure of what it is trying to be, but what it ends up being, is good enough, and the acting is amazing.

If that is enough for you, go ahead.

Oh, and the cover is ridiculous. It makes ""Fierce People"" look like a romantic comedy. It's not. It's anything but romantic comedy.",1244851200,17,1760,4.207715133531157

3270414,2,B000YV1Q2G,"This is an uneven film.  The first half is pleasant enough, but the plot develops so slowly as to go virtually nowhere.  Then the movie takes a sudden dark turn, and though it held my attention from here out, it seemed too different, almost like watching a separate movie.  The film has some fine moments of insights and sentiments, and it also contains moments that feel contrived and forced.  High caliber actors did their usual fine job, but most of the characters are presented superficially.  The attempt to draw parallels to an indigenous South American tribe with the assembled characters is marginal at best.  This is a mixed movie for me; two and a half stars right down the middle, but not a twinkle more; they could have and should have done a better job.",1237852800,3,766,4.637037037037037
3270415,4,B000YV1Q2G,"I quite liked this movie about a young boy and his drug addict mother who are befriended by one of the seven wealthiest men in the nation (Donald Sutherland). Finn (Anton Yelchin, a wonderful actor who I've loved in everything that I've ever seen him in, starting with Huff and moving on to House of D) and his mother, played by Diane Lane, leave the jungle of New York to go to the seeming tranquility of a massive palatial estate in New Jersey for the summer.

Initially, Finn is disappointed because he had wanted to spend the summer with his elusive father, an anthropologist studying tribal behavior in South America, whom Finn has never met.  But he soon warms to the scenery when he meets young Maya, the granddaughter of the multi billionaire patriarch.

Basically, the movie draws a parallel between the tribe that Finn's father has studied and the actions of the rich and callous.  In polite society, it's hard for Finn to know who his friends really are, and one person is as vicious and savage as one could possibly imagine.

It's some of those particularly brutal scenes that I found implausible based on the simple story of poor boy meets rich girl.  However, the acting by Sutherland and Yelchin is great and I liked the movie altogether, although it was a bit disjointed, hard to follow at times and the ending was predictable.",1230249600,6,1343,4.669491525423729
