238422,5,6300213803,What a great movie!!!! I have not been a huge Star Trek fan but a friend recommended this movie as one of the better sci fi movies. It did not disappoint. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves action adventure movies. The Wrath of Khan holds up.,1513296000,,250,4.229166666666667
238423,5,6300213803,"Based on a continuing plot from one of the episodes when ST was originally on TV, the movie shows the aftermath of choices Kirk made decades ago. It leaves you in suspense and sucks you in to their world. Kirk deals with a lot of moral questions concerning his past, and choices he made that come back to haunt him in this movie. It's a great connection to the past that stands almost like a ""final ending"" to issues faced in the series. The other ST movies engage new enemies or missions. This one considers the series and ties some loose ends on a marvelous way.

This movie may be a curse to the ST movies, and one of the reasons the ST movies have let fans down in the past. Everyone wants another Wrath of Khan!",1512432000,,716,4.226277372262774
238424,5,6300213803,"I was a small boy when I first saw this film in the local cinema way back in the 80's. I loved this film then and to this day (Nearly 40 years later) I still love this film. The best Star Trek film ever produced. The sets, characters etc are just perfectly filmed and the story is superb. Ricardo Montalban steals the show. If your a fan of Star Trek and for some reason you haven't seen this film watch it! If your not a fan but like SciFi watch it! Just watch it!",1510704000,,465,3.9574468085106385
238425,4,6300213803,Loved this movie when it first came out. But it looks a little dated by today's standard. Still..all in all... this was the Star Trek movie that fans wanted to see in the 1980s.,1510531200,,177,4.235294117647059
238426,5,6300213803,"From hells heart, I stab at thee, for hates sake I spit my last breath at thee! ~ Khan

Khhaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!! ~ Captain James T. Kirk.

(As Spock is slumping against a transparent sealant barrier, skin and lungs burned by intense radiation, his body about to give out as Jim is just on the other side of the barrier, locked out--)
Spock: Dont grieve, Admiral. It is logical. The needs of the many outweigh
Kirk: .the needs of the few.
Spock: .Or the one. I never took the Kobayashi Maru test until now. What do you think of my solution?
Kirk: (stifling hot tears) Spock
Spock: (with great and pained effort to Jim) I have beenand always will beyour friend.
Spock: (just prior to collapsing to the floor in death) Live longand prosper.

Kirks greatest challenge and deepest familial developments and closet of skeletons laid bare. Spocks most emotional sacrifice. Khans best poetic and fiery speeches. The enigma of the Kobayashi Maru solved. Star Treks best cinematic moments. Star Treks best film. Oh, and yeah, one of the best scripts of any science fiction film, ever.",1509062400,,1088,4.870270270270271
238427,5,6300213803,I would criticize over the filming of the time but honestly the ending redeems anything so paltry.,1507939200,,98,4.823529411764706

238430,5,6300213803,Best STar Trek movie of them all!,1505088000,,33,3.857142857142857
238431,5,6300213803,"To fully appreciate ""The Wrath of Khan', you'd have to already be plugged into the friendships between Spock, Kirk, and McCoy -- especially to enjoy McCoy ragging on Spock and Kirk like Stella Mudd, and the depths of Spock's soft spot for Kirk.  To me, it's endearing and hilarious.  And of course, the ending is still a knockout, even knowing that Spock will be resurrected.

Very good direction from Nicholas Meyer as Kirk and Spock move out to investigate really without a clue.  The best sequence in the film starts with the mysterious jammed message from Dr. Marcus to the first space battle with Khan. These directors are all Spielberg students at this time, and they know how to move plot elements like chess pieces into a powerful and suspenseful combination.

It really hit me watching 'Wrath' this time how good Kirstie Alley is, to step in to this ensemble of legendary stars and more than hold her own.  She's great!  I love her flirty Vulcan-to-Vulcan bit with Spock:  ""You lied!""  ""No I didn't, I exaggerated!""",1504828800,2,1024,4.7727272727272725

238486,5,6300213803,"The other original cast Star Trek movies feel and ""read"" like episodes with poor writing and thin plot lines but Wrath of Khan is the exception to them all. It has both continuity and continuation into the next movie (albeit a much weaker movie; The Search for Spock), as well as tight story lines and well paced action. The interplay between the protagonist (Kirk), his antagonist (Khan), and his foil (Spock) is very well written and acted.  Then again, I think Shatner is actually kind of underrated. He doesn't seem terribly subtle at first glance but if you really watch, he kind of is. Same with Nimoy.

In any case, it's an excellent movie.",1501372800,,647,4.666666666666667

The computer charts the course but delivers them to the closest planet it can find, hoping that no one will notice, i guess. For the grand finale a genius super human who can pilot space ships with ease isn't paying attention to the fact that space is 3 dimensional... and thus Kirk saves the universe once again.

I want to suspend belief and get pulled into the story as much as the next guy, but really?
Vintage Star Trek and still, despite the stupidity, the Best of all the movies.
Ricardo Montalban and Shanter really saved this one.",1487203200,2,722,4.553846153846154

238699,5,6300213803,"Quite possibly the best of all Star Trek movies, with IV and VIII close on its heels. Bring back one of the coolest villains of the original series, give him a personal vendetta against Kirk and a powerful doomsday weapon that is also a creator of life, and its just a recipe for a great sci fi movie. Add too that, a theme of growing old and coming to terms with a changing of the guard and another of self sacrifice, not to mention one of the best death scenes in cinematic history, this isn't just a great Star Trek movie, its a pretty great movie period.",1482969600,,558,4.224299065420561

Some (because Star Trek nerds are infamous for internecine warfare among themselves) may say ""The Voyage Home"" and others ""First Contact"", but in my opinion Wrath of Khan beats all of them hands down. It completes the Khan story begun in the original series episode ""Space Seed"" and the whole cast does a remarkable job. This is the Star Trek move against which all others are compared.

This version of The Wrath of Khan is a great transfer...though not perfect. There are still some artifacts from the film and some slight graininess to it, but it is very clean otherwise. This being the Director's Version of ""KHAN"" is why I gave it the 5 stars. Not only does it have the Director's Cut, but it also contains the Theatrical release.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: As its title suggests, STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN has a much stronger plot than its predecessor Sci-Fi film. That helps, but it's not the only improvement. This film also has the gamesmanship that the first one lacked, a quality that helped win the ''Star Trek'' television series and its amazingly devoted Trekkie fans. Maybe it's just that there are more and brighter blinking lights on the control panels of the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise this time, or that the costumes are so much cleverer, or that the special effects are so good they don't call undue attention to themselves. Perhaps it's the directorial switch from director Robert Wise with the first STAR TREK film to the brilliant director Nicholas Meyer has brought the material more pep and a breath of fresh air. In any case, this time something has mostly assuredly got it right, but despite this I still loved the first STAR TREK film.

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, reads Admiral James T. Kirk [William Shatner] from the book A Tale of Two Cities that [Spock [Leonard Nimoy] gives as a birthday gift. How appropriate that Dr. McCoy [DeForest Kelley] gives Admiral James T. Kirk a pair of antique reading glasses. Both gifts sends Admiral James T. Kirk into a ruminative state, forcing him to consider his life, his age and impending death, and how he wants to continue go on living. Fortunately, STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, which as we all know is widely regarded as the best of the entire STAR TREK film franchise, allows Admiral James T. Kirk to work out his existential crisis. This thoughtful and exciting picture from 1982 happily revitalises the STAR TREK spirit established originally by Gene Roddenberrys pivotal science fiction television series, emphasizing the undertone space-buccaneer themes to create a full-fledged swashbuckler in the stars. Incorporating adventure and humour, and stressing the character dynamics that would accompany future films, for loyalists of the Starship U.S.S. Enterprises original crew, this  sequel is the bible against which all other STAR TREK films would be judged by.

It is the 23rd century. Admiral James T. Kirk is feeling old; the prospect of accompanying his old ship the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise, which is now a Starfleet Academy training ship on a two-week cadet cruise, is not making him feel any younger. But the training cruise becomes a deadly serious mission when Khan appears after years of exile and holding the power of creation itself...

Its an idea touched on many times during the films first act, as Admiral James T. Kirk oversees a training simulation gone awry and then hands the captains chair to Lieutenant Saavik, a Vulcan who is expected guide the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise through a three-week training voyage with her new crew. Admiral James T. Kirk is accompanied by Spock, Dr. McCoy, Uhura, Scotty, and Sulu, and when his old nemesis Khan makes his entrance, Admiral James T. Kirk is forced to assume command of the ship and rely on some help from his old crew and friends to save the day.

Admiral James T. Kirk is also forced to deal with the appearance of his son, David, who has been working on a secret project called the Project Genesis device with his mother, Dr. Carol Marcus, Admiral James T. Kirks ex-lover. In the meantime Khan has stolen the Project Genesis device and commandeered the Reliant, a ship where Chekov, another of Admiral James T. Kirks old crew members, has been serving as a science officer. Khan takes Chekhov and another Reliant crew member along for the ride, and the story becomes an intense battle between the two Starfleet ships during acts two and three. As Nicholas Meyer notes in the new interview, he saw the climactic battle inside a nebula as something akin to duelling naval subs during World War II.

STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN has been released on Blu-ray before, but now Paramount Pictures UK has brought out this beautiful exclusive Limited Edition 50th Anniversary SteelBook as part of a collection of the Ten STAR TREK Sci-Fi films, and the video quality has been vastly improved over the previous Blu-ray releases, and this Blu-ray disc also features the high-definition release of Nicholas Meyers Directors Cut, which was previously available only on an inferior DVD. While the four minutes of footage added to STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN is a vast improvement, which of course gives you a much more insight into a few things, such as establishing a dead crew member as Scottys nephew. If you are paying close attention, youll probably notice that two lines of dialogue were actually removed from the earlier version of the Directors Cut which was released in 2002, at Nicholas Meyers behest. Its an exchange in which Admiral James T. Kirk tells Spock that David is Admiral James T. Kirks son, to which the half-Vulcan replies, Fascinating, which of course us the audience already knew this information, so slightly confused why Nicholas Meyer wanted this deleted.

With an original film score by the brilliant composer James Horner and an impressive array of visual effects showcasing what sort of eye popping things can be done entirely with models, and STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN is a visual and aural feast. Phasers flash throughout the cosmos and torpedoes flare in what can only be described as the ultimate duel of wits and intelligence. James Horners film music score is totally awesome and dramatic with just the right touch of lightness necessary for any humorous twitches involving pointed ears that might pop up here and there.

In addition to bringing back Ricardo Montalban's over the top Khan, which is a great fun performance to watch, principally because it's so camp, STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN introduces three significant new characters. The first is Saavik [Kirstie Alley], the sexy, half-Vulcan protg of Mr. Spock. Then there are a couple of figures from Admiral James T. Kirk's past, a son he did not know about and an ex-lover.

STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN is a top-notch, fast-paced adventure that can be enjoyed equally by fans of the series and those who have never seen an episode. There are several tense, well-executed battle sequences that feature impressive special effects and a soaring score by James Horner. The ending, which I won't reveal, which all STAR TREK fans already knows it by now, is very tender and poignant, proof that STAR TREK can still touch the heart. STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN shows the potential inherent in the STAR TREK franchise concept as applied to the big screen. It's unfortunate that none of the other films in this long-running series have come close to the level achieved by this marvellous example of brilliant entertainment.

STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN has never been so alive or looks as good as it is here in the capable hands of director Nicholas Meyer. Gene Roddenberrys vision has never been so clear, so gripping, so mind blowing, truly cinematic experience. STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN is a Sci-Fi film that transcends its genre, its format, its STAR TREK fan base to really get inside the hearts and heads of people across all barriers the world over. This is the way to make STAR TREK films look so RIGHT and even today the folks at Paramount Pictures are today trying to slowly help to recapture the magic of the original Sci-Fi films and of course you now have a new set of audiences. At the centre of the most successful Science Fiction franchise in history is the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise and her noble crew. At the centre of this Sci-Fi film, to STAR TREK film Trekkie fans it is a universe that is one fantastic experience called STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN which will also be loved by another set of new audiences to enjoy and preserved on this new remastered Blu-ray discs. STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN takes a natural progression forward, easing the viewer into the filmic medium by embracing the sheer entertainment value of Gene Roddenberrys original creation. Doubtless this is why so many Trekkies ignore the existence of STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE altogether and why many of the subsequent entries in the STAR TREK series naturally became films worthy of cinematic merit. STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN does something that Sci-Fi films based on television shows have tried to do, but have often failed to accomplish, whereas the STAR TREK Sci-Fi film  elevates the material from TV to film with appropriate gravitas. Nicholas Meyer embraces the shows mildly campy quality at times, but he also elevates the material for later films to build upon to great effect.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Paramount Pictures UK has pulled out all the stops and brought us this 50th Anniversary Blu-ray release with two versions of the film and delivered a new and stunning ""digitally remastered"" 1080p transfer, which you would think it was a new film that is outstanding with the quality and an equally impressive 2.35:1 Panavision aspect ratio that holds up very well. Trouble now is that you see Spock and Khans heavy make-up, which adds to the realistic image we view and gives a very filmic look. Surrounding textures don't really leap off the screen, but general definition is solid. Surface details around the different ships, whether it is the worn and battered derelict Botany Bay or the cleaner pre-attack lines and surface areas on the Reliant and Enterprise, almost always satisfy. Little touches on the button clusters on consoles or less immediately obvious, but very much appreciated, details like surface scuffs, and  material details on the silver plates seen at the beginning of a scene in which Admiral James T. Kirk and Saavik discuss her regulation hairstyle and the Kobayashi Maru test, are very impressive. Colours are particularly punchy, but there is certainly a broad consistency to them. The primary colours come from the red Starfleet uniforms and the deep blues and purples within the Mutara Nebula. The blue text of the opening credits is gorgeous, with good defining vibrancy. For fun, try and find the curvature of the planetarium ceiling onto which the star field was projected and filmed. Black levels are excellent, yielding positive depth and shadow detail. Details are maybe a hair sharper across the board. Again, those red Starfleet tops are amongst the best example with a finer, though by no means intricate, appearance, improving on a comparatively smoother look on the old image on the earlier video releases. By the way, the intimate Vulcan talk between Saavik and Spock is the only subtitles you get to see in the film and they are very clear white lettering. So overall this is a massive improvement on all levels and well done Paramount Pictures UK.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Paramount Pictures UK has pulled out all the stops and brought us the 50th Anniversary Blu-ray release with and amazing 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Surround that really enhances the audio experience, as the soundtrack is very solid. The opening theme sounds of James Horners score are very clear and truly effective to really enhance the film and really set the scene for the rest of the film you are about to experience. The music score has good stereo separation and the sense of musical instruments stand out for me. Dialogue is also very good via the front speakers and you can really hear all the words. Surround usage is limited, especially during the massive battle action scenes, especially with the explosions on the ships and seem to me remixed more aggressively. Phaser and transporter effects sound really crisp and clear, and certain high-pitched sounds are well delivered. The sound design makes very effective use of silence in the final battle scene. Fidelity is really great for a 1982 Sci-Fi film remastered, and sounds even better than when the first film when it was released. So once again, thank you Paramount Pictures UK for a really professional job.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Directors Cut and Theatrical Version of the Feature Film.

Audio Commentary by Director Nicholas Meyer [Directors Cut]: Here Nicholas Meyer introduces himself and states the obvious that you are watching STAR TREK II:THE WRATH OF KHAN with him and informs us that since the age of five he has been writing from that early age and also informs us that he is foremost a storyteller first and a filmmaker second. Nicholas also informs us that he has written several novels, especially when the Writers Guild of America went on strike originally in 1972, and in that time he produced several screenplays. Nicholas also informs us how he eventually got to direct STAR TREK II and of course goes into great detail of how STAR TREK II evolved throughout the whole production, and especially how the Trekkie fans also got involved and of course were totally outraged at hearing at the end of the film that Spock dies, and Nicholas got so much abusive E-mails and correspondence. We also get tons of information about technical details about why certain shots were attained and why. Nicholas also gives great praise about the actor Ricardo Montalban and how professional he was in knowing his lines so perfectly. Even though Nicholas viewed some STAT TREK TV episode and the first STAR TREK film, but he felt most of it was very pompous and felt that because he was not a fan of STAR TREK, he felt his film should give a much more objective view of the STAR TREK lore and genre and also felt his film should have much more input of word play scenario. Because Nicholas was so dedicated in getting STAR TREK II right, that sometimes he never saw daylight, especially arriving at the studio before the sunrise and going home very late at night, plus always checking that days shooting and also going to the cutting room to make sure he was getting the results he wanted for STAR TREK II just right. Nicholas tells us that he had a big battle with the Paramount Pictures Executives in wanting to spend more money on the special effects, especially in the cave of the planetoid of Regula, as he felt it looked false, especially when the Executives turn round and complain it does not look real. On top of all that the Executives wanted Nicholas to shoot the film in 49 days, whereas Nicholas demanded that he would need at least 53 days to finish the film. So ends another interesting audio commentary and Nicholas Meyer hope you also enjoyed the audio journey with him viewing STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN and also says he really enjoyed making the film.

Audio Commentary by Director Nicholas Meyer and Manny Coto [Theatrical Version]: Just as we get past the Titles at the start of the film Manny Coto, who is an American writer, director and producer of films and television programmes introduces himself after Director Nicholas Meyer did his introduction and of course both of them are sitting in the viewing room watching and doing the audio commentary to STAR TREK II, which both proclaim is one of their favourite STAR TREK film. What inspired Nicholas Meyer to work on this film was seeing at the cinema START TREK I: THE MOTION PICTURE, which despite getting loads of negative comments, but for both of them they really liked the film and thought the director Robert Wise did a brilliant job. Nicholas also heaps great praise on the very professional editing by William Paul Dornisch and tells us he was a really wonderful man who really knew his craft. This was a very enjoyable experience.

Special Feature: Text Commentary by Michael Okuda and Denise Lynn Okuda [Directors Cut] Here you get to view a panel at the bottom of the screen describing lots of relevant and very informative information and especially relating different information about hidden aspects of what you view in the film that you night not of noticed. It is also very helpful that you have a choice of four languages, which are English, French, Spanish and Portuguse. You also get lots of information on all technical aspects of how the special effects were produced and the information is so informative and fascinating. Denise Lynn Okuda is also co-authored of the 1996 Paperback STAR TREK Chronology: The History of the Future.

Special Feature: Library Computer [Theatrical Version] The Library Computer is an interactive experience that allows you to access information about People, Technology, Locations and more, at the moment each item appears in the film. Switch to Index Mode to scan the entire database and jumps directly to the items of interest. All content is divided into the following categories: Culture; Science & Medicine; Starfleet Ops; Miscellaneous; Life Forms; Planets & Location; People; Technology and Ships.

Special Feature: The Genesis Effect: Engineering The Wrath of Khan [2016] [1080p] 1.78:1] [28:20] This newly-Produced documentary for the Blu-ray of STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, where director Nicholas Meyer offers an in-depth exploration on the development, production, and release of the film as well as its impact and enduring legacy. Topics discussed include an overview of how the project came together, working with the stars, and on top of all that Nicholas Meyer claims that William Shatner had no ego but a lot of vanity, the themes of the film, but hated the script, and Gene Roddenberry's total displeasure with the movement towards militarism in the STAR TREK Sci-Fi film franchise. All in all this is a really wonderful insightful documentary.

Special Feature: Production: Here you get a selection of five different features and they are as follows: 01. Captains Logo [2009] [1080p [1.78:1] [27:20] A very good special feature about the Genesis Project and the story behind it, and especially choosing the TV Episode 'Space Seed' as the basis of the plot. The director asserts emphatically that those were indeed Ricardo Montalban's real pecs. 02. Designing Khan [2009] [1080p [1.78:1] [23:55] This is a an in-depth look at the production and costume design, the efforts to differentiate the Reliant from the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise, and Nicholas Meyer's intent to bring a more nautical theme to the Sci-Fi film. 03. Original interviews with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley and Ricardo Montalban [1982] [480i] [1.33:1] [10:57] This is a vintage promotional interviews and were shot in 1982 to promote STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN on its initial release. At the end you get some really nice black-and-white and colour promotional rare photographs. 04. Where No Man Has Gone Before: The Visual Effects of STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN [2009] [1080p [1.78:1] [18:15] Industrial Light & Magic staff discuss the use of early CGI, building the models, and the fun of blowing stuff up. 05. James Horner: Composing Genesis [2009] [1080p [1.78:1] [9:33] Here we have this brand new interview with the late great film music composer, who we get a very up close and personal interview about developing the musical themes and motifs for the scoring the STAR TREK film. At the start we get a surprising confession, that when he was asked to compose the music score James he did not know much about STAR TREK. But in the process he met Jerry Goldsmith and John Williams who help James out a great deal and saw how these masters of composed film music taught him that you have to match what you see on the screen. Despite being very short, it was still fascinating in hearing James Horners way of working to produce the composed music for STAR TREK II.

Special Feature: The STAR TREK Universe: Here you have three separate categories that have to be viewed separately and they are as follows: 01. Collecting STAR TREKs Movie Relics [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [11:00] Here we get to meet several Trekkie nerd collectors who boastfully show off their favourite props and costumes, including some from the aborted Phase II project. We also get contributors from Alec Peters [C.E.O. Propworx] who talks about the 1,000s of STAR TREK memorabilia that were auctioned by Christies Auction House. 02. A Novel Approach [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [28:56] Here we get to meet two more over the top so called ""professional Trekkie"" creepy and unsettling nerds, who shamelessly plug their lame STAR TREK tie-in novels and they are Greg Cox who is an American writer of science fiction, including works that are media tie-ins and lives in Oxford, Pennsylvania and Julia Ecklar who is a John W. Campbell Award winning science fiction author including the novels Minus Ten and Counting, Horse-Tamer's Daughter, and Genesis. 03. Starfleet Academy SCISEC Brief 002: Mystery behind Ceti Alpha VI [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:07] This is the second in a series of plot recaps hosted as though they were Starfleet instructional videos at the Starfleet Academy, Ex Astris, Scientia, San Francisco MMCLXI. In this episode, Starfleet Science Officer [Sarah Backhouse] from the 24th century briefing the audience from the Admiral James T. Kirk Lecture Hall at Starfleet Academy and the female host is basically giving us a Starfleet instructional video. In this video, an unnamed Starfleet Science Officer examines events that happened in STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN and particularly the damage to the planet Ceti Alpha VI.

Special Feature: Farewell: A Tribute to Ricardo Montalban [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:43] Here we get a very personal tribute to the actor Ricardo Montalban by writer/director Nicholas Meyer and delivers some really nice praise for the late actor. Nicholas Meyer also talks about the love of films in general and also seeing films of Ricardo Montalban in his different characters and also opposite his leading ladies like Lana Turner.

Special Feature: Storyboards [2002] [1080p] [1.78:1] You have thirteen separate categories that can only be viewed individually and they are as follows: Main Title Concept; Kobayashi Maru; CETI ALPHA V; Regula I; Chekov and Terrell find Khan; Admirals Inspection; Khans revenge; Kirk Strikes Back; Finding the Genesis cave; The Mutara Nebula; Sneak Attacks, Genesis and Honored Dead.

Theatrical Trailer [1982] [1080i] [1.78:1] [2:21] This is the original Theatrical Trailer for the film STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, that gives you a tantalising flavour of what to expect when you get to finally get to view this particular STAR TREK Sci-Fi film.

Finally, STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN is a really tremendous motion picture, a classic within the Science Fiction genre, and with the added bonus with this Exclusive UK Blu-ray release of having both the Directors Cut at 116 minutes and the Theatrical Version at 113 minutes. Fans who haven't upgraded to a high-definition version of STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN will find this new 50th Anniversary SteelBook release a great excuse to do so. Very Highly Recommended!

They're mostly small character moments that add depth to the movie. I'd argue that they should have never been cut, but I don't make movies, either.

It's a little predatory of Paramount to even release the theatrical release in HD, but maybe that's overly cynical.",1473206400,,411,4.708333333333333

240763,4,6300213803,"As an original Star Trek fan, who had to argue and hope for the ability to see the episodes, instead of ""Lost In Space,"" in the living room of my boarding school, I was thrilled when the movies came out. I actually saw this movie before seeing ""TMP."" These many years later, after just viewing it here on Amazon again, I have increased my rating - up from 2 stars. Some over-acting early on from the main characters, a mediocre musical score (compared to the original series) and inconsistencies such as Chekov not being in the first season and the 22nd vs 23rd Century detract from this one, but the real reason for my past lower rating is, simply, Spock's death. I remember walking out of the theater in 1982 feeling disgusted, thinking ""If what they have to do to out-do TOS is to kill Spock, they're not very good...""

Reading in these trivia notes that Leonard Nimoy was only going to do this movie if a death scene was in it (and a real exit, at that!), and that Shatner had to call and talk George Takei into coming back (these two later becoming, well, less-than-friends) - these put some objections into perspective. The character depth (missing from ST-TMP) Ricardo Montalban's strong performance, and the simple fact that 3 of these wonderful people are no longer with us, all boost this movie's standing IMHO. I only wish the streaming Prime version was the extended cut. ST IV remains my favorite, followed by III (the depth of characters can't be beat in III - AND, they brought back Spock!!). I rank VI next, followed by this one, TMP, and V, of course, last. Enjoy!",1468972800,4,1581,4.566901408450704

A buffed out Ricardo Montalban plays the ""title role"" of Khan.  Scorned by James Tiberius Kirk years earlier, Khan spends his time plotting a suitable revenge.  To say what what is would be to spoil the movie for those five or six people who've never seen it before.

S.S. Enterprise.
'Captain Terrell' accompanied by 'Chekov' of the Federation Star-Ship 'S.S.
Reliant' are on a reconnaissance mission on 'Alpha' '5' they come across
a module that appears to still be in use, 'Chekov' notices a item with the
name of a long since forgotten craft, the 'S.S. Botany Bay' he immediately
recognises the significance, and with 'Captain Terrell' try's to leave the
module as fast as they could, however the occupants were now outside the
module.
'Chekov' recognises 'Khan' instantly, 'Khan Noonien Singh' a enemy of earth
had with his crew been sentenced to exist on the planet years earlier with no
escape route, left there in fact by 'Captain James T Kirk'
'Khan' has always wanted revenge for his long imprisonment, now he has
a ship, he also learns of the 'Creative' powers of 'Project Genesis'
He now controls both 'Chekov' and 'Terrell' and intends to use them to obtain
the 'Genesis Module' and lure 'Kirk' to exact his revenge.
'Chekov' contacts 'Carol' and 'David Marcus' (Mother and Son) who had lead
the invention of the 'Genesis Poject' telling them he'd had orders from 'Kirk'
to deploy the device.
'Obviously' when told 'Admiral Kirk' and his crew are on the way to confront
the old nemesis.
After a battle between the two ships 'Kirk' 'Bones' and 'Vulcan' Lieutenant Saavik'
seemingly become trapped along with 'Carol' 'David' and 'Chekov' on a desolate
planet, 'Spock' has apparently been told to leave the scene on 'Enterprise' now
'Khan' believes he has done to his old enemy what had been done to him years
before, he also has the 'Genesis' device (only 'Kirk' doesn't play by the rules)
Another exciting 'Out of this World Adventure' which see's our heroes pit their
wits against the vengeful 'Khan'
'Captain James Kirk' has to seemingly face life without his 'Colleague and Friend 'Spock'
after an act of self sacrifice to save both crew and ship.

241060,5,6300213803,"Star Trek 2 the Wrath of Kahn is widely regarded as the best of the original 6 Star Trek movies featuring the original cast.  The movie had a riveting story with a great villain played by Ricardo Montalban who had one of the best performances in movie history as the vengeful Kahn.  There is not a lot to add to that has not already been said about the movie.  James Horners musical score was outstanding and really helped pace the movie along.  It was fun watching the veterans teach a rookie crew how it is done.  Kirstie Alley was definitely a babe back in the day.  The movie just seemed to work on all fronts the concept of dealing with aging, creation of life, revenge, self sacrifice, true friendship.  Lots of great ideas put into this little action adventure film.  The film holds up remarkable well for its age.  The early computer generated graphics look great and the film has a lot of suspense and action unlike Star Trek the Motion Picture.  Overall I would rate this a 5 star film especially when you consider what a turn around this was for the first movie which was a real bore.",1458518400,,1095,4.43

241126,5,6300213803,"In my opinion, the Star Trek films are passable as parts of a good franchise but aren't good movies in and of themselves.  This film is an exception.  It's well acted, particularly for a cast (William Shatner) famous for overacting.  Ricardo Montalban is incredible as a brilliant villain half-mad with a rather justified obsession with revenge.  William Shatner does well in playing an older character facing the consequences of a rules-don't-apply-to-me attitude and of everything he did as a young hotshot type in the series.

A nice touch, particularly in a revenge story, is how visceral this film is.  An early scene shortly after Montalban is introduced would feel perfectly at home in a horror film (not gory, but very terrifying and handled well).  The usual ""clean"" space battles of Star Trek where ships chip away at each other shields are absent.  Both sides lose their shields immediately and then keep fighting, resulting in visible damage and heavy losses.

The Blu-ray edition doesn't add much, so there's no reason to buy this if you have the DVD.",1454457600,11,1064,4.966101694915254
241127,5,6300213803,"I consider myself relatively new to HD digital downloads and Blu-ray and this review is for the Blu-ray version of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. For a long time, I held off on getting the Blu-ray version of this movie or older movies in general because I usually imagined that the increased quality of the picture and sound would make this classic seem dated by exposing the flaws in the older film prints.
The movie sees the big screen return of Admiral James T. Kirk and the Enterprise crew as the admiral oversees the Kobayashi Maru simulator session which features a no-win scenario to test Starfleet officers character. Meanwhile, the USS Reliant is searching for the Genesis Device. Two of its officers are captured by recurring villain Khan, whom is seeking revenge against Kirk. Without spoiling the movie too much, Kirk assumes command of the Enterprise once again to find the Genesis Device before Khan does in this sci-fi classic.
I was pretty surprised with how the movie looks on Blu-ray, which is to say it looks spectacular. Its not perfect as the age of this film shows during more darkly lit scenes such as when the USS Enterprise goes into red alert, but as a whole this version is much nicer looking than the DVD version of this movie. The upgrade is definitely worth it if you happen to have a Blu-ray player. The digital noise reduction used in this version film doesnt really bother me, I barely seemed to notice it at all to be perfectly honest.
Overall, Wrath of Khan is a great movie and it looks just as good, if not better than I remember it looking from when I saw it on VHS as a kid with my father. The movie is overall cleaner than previous versions of the movie, and it shows on Blu-ray and HD downloads of the film. I was worried that it would look dated the way Die Hard did, and Im glad to be wrong on this one. I would even say that Wrath of Khan on Blu-ray looks better than movies shot recently such as Fargo or Man of Steel.",1454371200,,1965,4.415977961432507

241435,5,6300213803,"After the long-dormant Star Trek franchise was revived with Robert Wise's widely anticipated but often slow-paced ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Motion-Picture/dp/6300216802/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Motion Picture</a>,"" a film that had a ""sex with a computer"" premise, everything was put right with this sterling follow-up effort.

In PARAMOUNT's second Star Trek film THE WRATH OF KHAN (directed by Nicholas Meyer), the decades seem to drop away and we're right back amidst those vintage Trek TV shows, thanks in great part to a spot on script and Ricardo Montalban's magnificent reprise of the evil superhuman of the ""Space Seed"" episode, marooned so long ago with 80 of his followers on Ceti Alpha V by Capt. (now Admiral) James T. Kirk.

Furthering the illusion of time stood still in this swashbuckling sci-fi adventure is Leonard Nimoy's recital of a revamped ""Space... the final frontier"" opening speech, also a self-admittedly aging Kirk's assignment to the equally high-mileage original USS Enterprise (NCC-1701), which has been reduced to an outmoded training ship.

Kirk and his crew of newbies, among them Vulcan/Romulan designated commander Lt. Saavik (Alley) are on a two-week milk run that includes the infamous Kobayashi Maru simulation, when barrel-chested Khan Noonien Singh and 15 other genetically engineered survivors take control of the USS Reliant and its commander, Pavel Chekov.

Khan and Reliant attack Space Station Regula 1, where Kirk's lover and adult son are developing a Genesis Device. After receiving Regula 1's SOS, Kirk relieves Saakik of command and warp speeds toward the station. While enroute, a surprise attack from Reliant cripples Enterprise and kills many of its green crew. Next comes a cat-and-mouse war sequence inspired by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-ENEMY-BELOW/dp/6301662954/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE ENEMY BELOW</a>&nbsp;(1957), a battle of wits between two old adversaries in which only one will survive.

241489,5,6300213803,"If you are a trekker, you've probably already seen this movie 900 times, you probably love it, and you probably still get choked up at the end every single time you watch it. Who knew that someone saying ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" could make a person cry? This particular DVD edition includes some deleted scenes. I'm not sure they add a lot of value.
If you're not a trekker, there are a few things you should know: First, you don't need to see the Star Trek: The Motion Picture before you see this. In fact, unless you have three hours you were planning to spend watching paint dry, just skip the first movie. Second, this movie is a follow-up to an episode of the original Star Trek series. You don't need to have seen it. The movie will do enough audience exposition to get you caught up. Finally, if you're not a Trekker, I'm pretty sure you won't like this movie very well. However, if you decide to watch it, you'll likely find yourself thinking one or more of the following as you watch the movie:
""The cast of the reboot looks nothing like the people in this movie.""
""Holy crap, is that Kirstie Alley playing a pointy-eared alien?""
""Oh look, it's that gay asian guy who posts hilarious stuff on Twitter.""
""Who's the guy with the awesome pecs? Wasn't he on the Love Boat or something back in the day?""
""Seriously, Kirk has an adult son he knew about but has never met, and he doesn't look like he's going to have a heart attack upon meeting him?""
""For reals, we're going to spend twelve minutes in near silence in a nebula? Is this supposed to be suspenseful or something? Also, how come nobody just looks out a window? Maybe they would be able to see the other ship.""
And finally: ""I think they just major-character-death'ed us. I think I should be upset, but since I'm not a Trekker, I don't feel emotionally invested in any of these characters.""",1439683200,,1883,4.4293948126801155

241535,5,6300213803,"STAR TREK PORTRAYS AN OPTIMISTIC FUTURE WHERE MANKIND CAN PUT ASIDE ALL DIFFERENCES AND HAVE A UNITED EARTH, AND ALL VIEWPOINTS THAT RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE'S GOD GIVEN RIGHTS ARE ENCOURAGED.  STAR TREK'S SUCCESS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT EPISODES ARE RELEVANT TO TODAY BECAUSE THEY ARE MORALITY PLAYS THAT TEACH WATCHERS GREAT VALUES AND CAUSE THEM TO BE EXITED TO WORK FOR THE BETTER FUTURE OF THE STAR TREK UNIVERSE!
THE EXCELLENT MOVIE STAR TREK 2: THE WRATH OF KHAN, IS TECHNICALLY A SEQUEL TO STAR TREK TOS (THE ORIGINAL SERIES) EPISODE CALLED SPACE SEED, IN WHICH THE ENTERPRISE CREW DISCOVERS KHAN AND CREW IN DEEP SPACE IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION SINCE 1996 AND REVIVES THEM.  DURING HIS HIBERNATION SICKNESS RECUPERATION, KHAN IS SHOWN EXTRAORDINARY KINDNESS BY CAPTAIN KIRK, EVEN GIVING HIM FULL ACCESS TO THE FEDERATION LIBRARY WHICH KHAN UTILIZES FOR EVIL.  HE TAKES CONTROL OF THE ENTERPRISE AND TRIES TO KILL CAPTAIN KIRK.  CAPTAIN KIRK IS RESCUED AND AT KHAN'S TRIAL MERCIFULLY ALLOWS KHAN AND THE ENTERPRISE'S HISTORIAN MARLA, WHO FALLS IN LOVE WITH KHAN, TO HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER AN UNINHABITED CLASS M PLANET.
WITH A HAPPY ENDING FOR ALL, KIRK MOVES ON TO HIS FURTHER MISSIONS OF A VERY BUSY CAREER, RARELY ABLE TO GO BACK TO THE PLANETS HE HAS HELPED.  FURTHER VISITS OF COURSE ARE USUALLY THE JOB OF NONSTARFLEET BRANCHES OF THE FEDERATION.
UNFORTUNATELY, KHAN'S PLANET HAS A GEOLOGICAL DISASTER, UNBEKNOWNST TO THE FEDERATION, THAT NEARLY RENDERS THE PLANET UNINHABITABLE AND CAUSES SOME DEATHS, MOST NOTABLE MARLA, KHAN'S BELOVED WIFE.  KHAN BLAMES KIRK FOR ALL THAT GOES WRONG, JUST AS HIS LITERARY HERO CAPTAIN AHAB BLAMES MOBY DICK.  THE RESULT IN BOTH CASES IS OBSESSIVE VENGEANCE REGARDLESS OF THE COST.  WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT KHAN TOTALLY MISSED THE POINT OF THE MELVILLE BOOK?
THE GOD THAT CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH HAS DECREED THAT HE WILL JUDGE ALL FOR THE GOOD OR EVIL THAT WE DO IN THE FLESH AND THAT VENGEANCE IS FOR HIM ALONE TO TAKE.  HE FURTHER COMMANDS THAT WHEN THERE IS A SERIOUS ISSUE WITH ANOTHER, THAT YOU COMMUNICATE IT GENTLY AND PRIVATELY WITH THE PERSON YOU HAVE ISSUE WITH.  IF THE PERSON WILL NOT CEASE A DELIBERATE OFFENSE, YOU ARE TO SEPARATE FROM THEM UNTIL THEY DO, NEVER RETURNING EVIL FOR EVIL.
CAPTAIN TERREL AND CHEKOV MISTAKENLY DISCOVERED KHAN WHILE INVESTIGATING WHY THERE WERE WEAK LIFEFORM READINGS ON A PLANET THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN CATAGORIZED AS LIFELESS AND HAD BEEN SELECTED TO LAUNCH A TERRAFORMING TORPEDO. THE GEOLOGICAL DISASTER HAD SHIFTED THE ORBIT SO THEY CHECKED THE WRONG PLANET.
IN THIS STAR TREK 2 ""EPISODE"" WE HAVE ANOTHER OF MANY AMAZING EMOTION VS LOGIC DEBATES BETWEEN DR MCCOY AND SPOCK, WHICH HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OF GREAT HELP TO KIRK IN ANY DECISIONS THAT HE HAS TO MAKE AND IS THE KEY TO MANY OF HIS LEGENDARY SUCCESSES!  WE ALL STRUGGLE WITH THE BALANCE BETWEEN EMOTION AND LOGIC.  TO CONTINUE, SPOCK SAID THAT THE TORPEDO WOULD ELIMINATE PREEXISTING LIFE IN FAVOR OF IT'S NEW MATRIX.  MCCOY CALLED THIS UNIVERSAL ARMAGEDDON, OBVIOUSLY FEARING THAT THIS ""GENESIS"" INVENTION INTENDED TO HELP IN OVERPOPULATION AND STARVATION PROBLEMS WOULD INSTEAD BE USED FOR A WEAPON, WHICH IS PRECISELY WHAT DROVE SOME KLINGONS TO ATTACK IN THE NEXT MOVIE. ALSO MCCOY ADDRESSED THE HUBRIS OF MAN PLAYING GOD, NOT SAYING BUT SUGGESTING PREVIOUS HUBRIS EFFORTS SUCH AS THE TOWER OF BABEL OR THE TITANIC.
WARNING:  DO NOT READ FURTHER UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE SEEN STAR TREK 2,3, AND 4!
WHAT IF KHAN ACCEPTED A TRANSPLANT TO A BETTER PLANET FOR HIS PEOPLE WITH SOME EMERGENCY SUPPLIES INSTEAD OF USING THE CETI EELS FOR TORTURE?  IT WAS THE CETI EELS WHICH CAUSED HIM TO GET THE GENESIS INFO AND ULTIMATELY THE DEVICE ITSELF.  IF HE HAD WORKED WITH TERRELL AND CHEKOV PER GOD'S GOLDEN RULE (LUKE6:31), THE FOLLOWING SUFFERINGS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED: NO DEATHS IN TERRELLS CREW, NO DEATHS OF THE GENESIS SCIENTISTS INCLUDING KIRK'S SON IN THE NEXT MOVIE, NO DEATHS OF THE TRAINEE CHILDREN ON BOARD THE ENTERPRISE INCLUDING MR SCOTT'S GIFTED NEPHEW, NO DEATHS OF KHANS CREW AND CHILDREN, NO AGAPE SACRIFICE BY SPOCK IN ORDER TO SAVE EVERYONE ELSE ON BOARD THE ENTERPRISE, AND IN STAR TREK3, NO UNLAWFUL YET AGAPE ACTIVITY BY KIRK AND CREW TO SAVE SPOCK'S KATRA (SOUL), AND NO KLINGON INVASION THAT DESTROYED THE USS GRISSOM AND ENTERPRISE AT THE GENESIS WORLD AND KILLED ALL BUT ONE OF THE INVADING KLINGON BIRDOFPREY CREW!  IF THE GENESIS TORPEDO HAD BEEN SET OFF AS PLANNED, THE FEDERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN READY WITH A SUFFICIENT FORCE OF SHIPS IN THE AREA TO PREVENT PIRACY AND OPPORTUNISTS SUCH AS THE INVADING CAPTAIN KRUGE'S BIRDOFPREY.
WOULD KIRK STILL HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAVE EARTH IN STAR TREK 4 FROM AN ANGRY WHALE PROBE?  OF COURSE AND GEORGE AND GRACY WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE ENTERPRISES LARGE SHUTTLE BAY THAN ON A CAPTURED AND STINKY KLINGON BIRDOFPRAY!
SPOCKS AGAPE (IE SACRIFICIAL LOVE) SACRIFICE AND KIRK AND CREWS AGAPE RISKS ARE GREAT EXAMPLES OF THE ACTS 5:29 COMMANDMENT TO OBEY GOD OVER MAN WHEN MAN ORDERS YOU TO DO SOMETHING AGAINST THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION'S BIBLICAL TEACHINGS!  THE LOVE AND THE SACRIFICES THESE FUTURE FICTITIOUS PEOPLE MAKE IS AN INSPIRATION TO US ALL!
THE CAST, CREW, AND WRITING OF STAR TREK 2 AND THE OTHER 2 MOVIES IN THIS TRILOGY IS STAR TREK IS ITS VERY FINEST!  AND TRULY WE FIND OUT THAT VENGEANCE BENEFITS ABSOLUTELY NO ONE, ACTUALLY HURTING EVERYONE INVOLVED.  ""LIKE A POOR MARKSMAN YOU KEEP MISSING THE TARGET""
REMEMBER THAT IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK AND ACT IN COMPLIANCE TO GOD'S COMMANDMENTS!  MY STAR TREK HERO'S DEFINITELY KNOW OF GOD'S ""AMAZING GRACE.""  AND MR SCOTT LOVES TO PLAY THIS MOST BEAUTIFUL OF CHRISTIAN ANTHEMS ON HIS BAGPIPES.  HOW EMOTIONALLY POWERFUL AND HOW APPROPRIATE TO HEAR ""AMAZING GRACE"" AT SPOCK'S MEMORIAL.

The presentation via Amazon FireStick is clear, it's bright, and the sound is great. This really improves the total viewing experience.

The plot is potentially interestingKhan attempts revenge on Kirkbut the plot pacing is glacially slow. The side-plot of Kirk's ex-wife and son is a caricature of a good-relationship-gone-bad.

This movie is also a huge upgrade from the bore fest of its predecessor Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Amazing visuals. A great villain. The best Star Trek villain here and Ricardo Montalban is the best Khan. so much better than the Benedict Cumberbatch version of Khan in the overrated Star Trek Into Darkness. he is Khan in name only in that mess of a movie. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is amazing all the way around.

242647,4,6300213803,"In a virtual sea of confusion, (between DVD and Blu-ray editions of films) I hope you find my brief review helpful. This review is for the Blu-ray edition of Star Trek II.

 For those unfamiliar with this film, it's the Trek film I have recommended to non-Trek fans over the years with almost unanimously positive results. It's a film that one would not necessarily need much familiarity with The Star Trek Franchise to enjoy. Star Trek II is one of the first movies I remember seeing in a movie theater at the tender age of four and a half, and I usually watch it once a month on home video. I cannot say enough positive things about the film; it simply is a well-scripted, well-directed, and well-acted motion picture.

 Now then, as for the Blu-ray edition itself... first of all, it is not the director's cut of the film. It is the original 1982 theatrical version. Nothing at all wrong with that, but I do find myself missing some of the additional explanatory dialogue and scenes I had come to know and love from the director's cut. I don't want to list them and inadvertently spoil anything for anyone who has never seen the film.

 The special features are pretty good. There is a good commentary track with director Nicholas Meyer, and some features previously available on The Two-Disc DVD edition. There is a worthwhile new feature with the film's composer James Horner, as well as a nice tribute to actor Ricardo Montalban. The only feature I wasn't crazy about was the interactive Library Computer- I found it initially difficult to use, and I don't feel it enhanced my enjoyment of the film all that much.

 Bottom line, whether you're a fan or a novice, if you've owned the film on VHS, DVD or neither, this Blu-ray edition is a pretty good justification to spend thirteen dollars or so. Enjoy!",1424563200,2,1809,4.63125

242690,4,6300213803,There's nothing in the Director's Cut that detracts from nor enhances the original. It does have an extra bit that explains why Scotty is so upset with the death of the young space cadet. I always did think Scotty's near collapse seemed out of place in the original. Now I know why.,1422748800,,282,4.4423076923076925
242691,5,6300213803,"The best in the entire Star Trek franchise series, including anything made in TNG, DS9, or these new films.

 I have a feeling that these actors, some of them now departed from this world, really enjoyed working in the Star Trek franchise with paramount and the late Gene Rodenbury because one can see the joy in their act and reading of the dialogue.

 The late Recardo Montobahn, who was a fine & high class Mexican gentleman actor, really defines the evil character of Khan and his despotic ""Hitler"" or ""Saddam Hussein"" like schemes to conquer and destroy all in his way.  Shatner's Captain James T. Kirk is the only swashbuckling hero who can stop him, & the now late Leonard Nimoy's Spock demonstrates the sacrifice soldiers make for their fellow comrades.

 Gene Roddenbury's original plot and stupid ""Klingons alter JFK"" screenplay was thankfully completely rejected (again Roddenbury's creation gained momentum with others at the helm and not him), and instead the executives at Paramount wisely created a much better yarn taking Captain Kirk (Shatner) in the role of a naval ""Master and Commander"" theme on an galactic scale against a character brought back from the 60's tv series.

 Previously before reviewing this film after not seeing it for many years, I had watched the TOS episode ""Space Seed"" to get a better understanding of the background between these two rivals.  And what I can state is in this sequel Paramount and Rodenberry made some major changes for the film version including even their costumes, but still kept the primary theme the elemental core of the plot.

 Deforest Kelly, Nimoy, and James Doohan are brilliant portraying the roles we all know well and love.

 I also notice a real difference in attitude and character behavior portrayals between the 60's TV show and the 80's movies, Mr. Spock strikes me as remaining computer like and scientific but he seems much more mellow in this movie verses the struggles he went through on the show.

 Shatner and Bones seem to really enjoy their older age military officer roles, poking fun at the new recruits and toying a bit with the young female Lieutenant who is trying to prove herself in her space age naval career.

This recent DVD and blue ray was done well.  Maybe they will do a ""Special Addition"" George Lucas style one day to this but so far it seems to transition well into modern media.

  This plot was well written, with dynamic and action filled science fiction tied with the ""thinking man's"" elemental moral and scientific concepts ""Star Trek"" has always been known for until these recent movie remake monstrosities came out that in my view have turned Star Trek into Star Wars with absolutely stupid side plots such as Spock having a romance with Uhura!!! The new films are nothing compared with the older ones.

  If you want real science fiction action adventure, then you need to see the original series, with these awesome films.  Five stars for ""The Wrath of Khan"", one of my favorite films of all time.",1421884800,3,3007,4.826171875

242792,5,6300213803,"I won't get into the actual film premise since this is more of a review based on the new HD restoration.

Obviously the picture quality is much improved, though it doesn't quite have the 1080p pop I expected, perhaps it is restored more to a 1080i or 720p format?  But what is vastly improved is the color saturation.  In the scene where the Enterprise is first hit by reliant, the bridge goes to red alert and the effect is chilling and much more eye opening in the HD.

Sound is VASTLY superior to the DVD version (I mean - that's why Blu-Ray really rocks isn't it?).  The ambient effects, the explosions, the dialogue - all are crystal clear.  This isn't a modern action film where there are explosions every 3 seconds, so the actual noise of battle is much more raw in it's clarity and the fact that it is much less common than in the modern Star Trek films.

I did end up double dipping - owning a copy on DVD already.  But I think it was worth the $6.99 that I paid purchasing from Amazon directly (not 3rd party) w/Prime shipping (currently it is selling for $13).  It is a classic science fiction film, and possibly the best Star Trek film ever made (in my opinion it is the best!).

It is a gripping, dramatic, skillfully directed (by Nicholas Meyer) feature with an engrossing plot and a memorably exciting (and heartbreaking) climax. In this ""trek"", a villain from an episode of STAR TREK, the super-human criminal Khan (the late Ricardo Montalban, in a memorably scene-chomping performance--although William Shatner's Kirk does get to do one overacted scream of ""KAHN!"" midway through the film), returns from five years of exile to exact revenge on Admiral Kirk and the Enterprise. Some parts of the film may be too intense or grisly, notably one sequence where Khan places disgusting eels in two officer's ears, but at the same time, the ""shock"" value of that moment gives a gritty edge to THE WRATH OF KHAN. The special effects are provided by George Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic, and are a huge stepup from those of THE MOTION PICTURE. James Horner's thrilling score is also a fitting compliment. Considered by fans to be the best of the STAR TREK movies (although I will debate that point since I've enjoyed III and IV -- which happen to form a long arc equivalent to a trilogy -- as well as VI), this is a great place to start if you're not familiar with STAR TREK.",1412208000,,1374,4.7053941908713695

242831,1,6300213803,"All the Star Trek movies (except the first) suffer from a fatal flaw that keeps it from being a great film. In this film, Kirk's failure to raise shields at the approach of a Starfleet vessel not responding to repeated hailings is the fatal flaw and is a result of sloppy writing. If Kirk hadn't been able to communicate with a friendly ship, he would be far too seasoned to take offense if they raised their shields. And working years for the U.S. Navy, I can say someone who screwed up that badly would be held responsible before a military court. And look how many lives were lost because of that one mistake. Yes, including Spock. So one star for pathetic writing.",1411430400,,668,4.483606557377049
242832,5,6300213803,"In this sequel to ST the Motion Picture, Nicholas Meyer takes the ageing Enterprise crew on another space adventure where they meet an old foe, face death and yet come to new life and a new beginning.

Although now very dated for various reasons (the effects are laughable by contemporary standards) this movie is certainly the best in all the ST franchises, whether the TOS movies, the TNG movies, and the reboot series.  While none of the Trek movies are complete flops (though ST 5 comes close at times with its wishy-washy New Age mix of religion and science fiction) this one does stand the test of time.  Why?

The essence of ST II actually goes back to Herman Melville - a deranged egomaniac and psychopath bent on revenge after many years in space chases the Enterprise and will stop at nothing to get his vengeance.  While this trope of SF has been done so many times it is a clich, it is done effectively in this movie.  Actor Ricardo Montalban (reprising his role as Khan from the Original Series) does a surprisingly good job of depicting an insane psychopath from the 20th century who has only one mission - to destroy Kirk and the Enterprise, even besides the relatively hammy performance by Shatner in this film.

The film is violently brutal and effective in its action sequences and psychological games, from the merciless surprise attack by Khan on a hapless science base to the Enterprise itself, to the brutal final battle between the two equally matched ships (done in the surprisingly well-depicted Mutara Nebula) which requires a terrible sacrifice from the Enterprise crew in order to escape.

The film is not top of the self Sci-Fi, yet it handles a wide number of themes competently - Kirk's sense of a mid-life crisis and the inevitable decline of age, Spock's struggle between his logic and his humanity, Khan's ruthless brutality vs friendship, compassion and sanity, and the horrors of violent conflict.  The senseless destruction that comes at the hands of pursuing an unattainable goal is perhaps one of the best handled parts of the film.

Ultimately despite some second-rate acting and mediocre special effects, Meyer's well-written and scripted movie manages to pull off the best movie in the franchise.",1410739200,,2238,4.881266490765172

Khan has long been hailed as the best ST villain; in fact, the only other that measures up is Chang from ST6.  Again, there are some pretty significant flaws; such as the Enterprise crew allowing another Federation starship to fly right up and alongside without a word and tear into the Enterprise, or having no security around a device as powerful as Genesis.  But, these can easily be forgiven when the story as a whole is taken into consideration; Kirk meeting the son he never knew existed, the dynamics between the characters as they learn about and cope with the realities of old age and death, and, of course, Spock's sacrifice for the needs of the many.

I have watched the episodes a hundred times, but to watch one of them again, with someone who has never seen it before, is ""PRICELESS""... I recommend this movie and all the previous ones as well.

243230,5,6300213803,"I saw this in the theater in 1982 as an 11 year old boy. Even then, I understood from Meyer's dialogue and visuals as well as Horner's music that they were trying to say something deeper. By my mid 20's (after a few readings of The New Testament) I had figured it out. Sacrifice. Love. Compassion.

There is one thing I have noticed over the years about this movie: It is NOT Kirk and Khan being contrasted...is Spock and Khan. Serious. Kirk provides the plot motion and the gravitas and the chutzpah. But, it is Spock, the child of Surak who provides the true counter-point to the vicious, ego-maniacal, selfish and twisted Khan Noonien Singh.

Think on it: Kirk comes to Spock's quarters after the distress call arrives. Spock is meditating. He immediately divines Kirk's need and the fear Kirk has of seeming to undermine Spock by taking command. Spock is unselfish and gives command up freely, and takes the time to sooth the emotions of his human friend. It is Spock who makes the ship ready for battle again. It is Spock who gives the key bit of advice on how to provoke the ego-driven Khan to chase them into the Mutara Nebula. His counsel is always sound and based on both logic and the compassion for all living things that Surak taught. Finally, Spock gives the last and most valued possession he has to save the lives of his friends and crew mates.

Khan is the foil to all that. Khan spends the lives of friends and foes as though they were subway tokens. Khan cannot step away from hurt pride and obsession. Khan will literally go to the end of the Cosmos to cut Kirk's throat if possible. Khan will use Genesis to burn the whole galaxy down if need be. Finally, after he kills innocents and allies alike in a blood-soaked spree of selfish vengeance, he throws his own miserable life onto the pyre, hoping to kill Kirk (and everyone around him) once and for all.

Maybe I am too Catholic, but this stuff jumps off the screen at me these days. On other points: Dialogue, Music, Visuals and everything else were a quantum leap beyond the well-intentioned but motionless ""ST:TMP"". Five stars. Best in the series.",1395705600,11,2122,4.561679790026247

The movie is well paced and moves quickly.  The side story is interesting as it makes you think about creating new worlds and do we have the right to.

Since this one picked up one of the best storylines from the original (in my opinion) it was a stroke of genius. This one also set up the next couple of movies in the original series so it was a must have for that as well.

(All those detractors out there who mock the ""KHAN!!!!!!!"" scene are full of horse plop.)  The only element of this DVD which disappoints me is the complete lack of extras....not even a theatrical trailer is included.

Better special effects. Better dialogue. I hadn't remembered how stilted the dialogue was in this. More of a space opera than sic-fi adventure. I couldn't help but laugh at Khan's goons. They looked like hippies play-acting as gypsies.

All in all a bit of a farce when compared to more modern, and better written, movies. But, aside from the one episode in the series,  this is where Khan started. And after watching the new Star Trek Into Darkness, I like what he became.",1382054400,,641,4.423728813559322

243825,5,6300213803,"Even after 32 years, it's everything Into Darkness desperately tried to be and so much more. Wrath is the standard by which all else Star Trek has and always will be measured. It was so foolish of Darkness' producer to flatter himself with the notion he could rebake Khan - astonishingly foolish. It was skaky enough just to try to re do TOS, but Khan? Watching both films back to back, there is no comparison. Darkness' producer, cast, costume designers, makeup artists, set designers, ""actors"", and crew should just go home. What a joke compared to WOK. Look at the other reviews for both and you'll see the consensus.

WOK is timeless. It's production, its soundtrack, even its special effects have withstood the test of time and still aren't cheesy today. By contrast, the special effects of Into Darkness were cheesy on day one. If you want to watch a Star Trek Khan movie, watch this one and by all means steer clear of Into Darkness unless you're morbidly curious or are in want of parody, because that is all ID will ever be - a hollow caricature of this great film. Wrath of Khan is what every sci-fi film wishes it could be.",1378944000,,1134,4.5588235294117645

I get that starting with The Wrath of Khan means I miss out on some references and nuances that veterans enjoy. However, this is a goof first foray for newbies.

The movie does an excellent job of establishing roles and relationships in meaningful ways. It has a compelling story. The cast give great performances.

But more importantly, it leaves me wanting more. Star Trek III is up next immediately. Then maybe I can visit the original series.

I can't offer a suggestion of The Wrath of Kahn's ranking in the series, but I can attest to its effectiveness both as a standalone film and a launching off point for those of us new to the series.",1377820800,,797,4.631205673758865

All of the original series characters were portrayed by the original actors in excellent form and the story and action was far more like what we all came to enjoy and appreciate in the TV series. Captain (pardon me, ADMIRAL) Kirk was his old self and so were Spock, et al. The confrontation with his old enemy Kahn (portrayed by Ricardo Montalban) was classic Star Trek and kept the viewer's interest right through to the tragic ending. Spock revealed his most ""human"" heart when he sacrificed himself for the life of his shipmates. William Shatner never was an Academy Award level of actor  (the only reason the film doesn't rate 5 stars) but he does perform quite well and delivers his best in this role. A good two popcorn bag movie which should entertain just about anybody (not only ""trekkies"").",1372550400,,937,4.63855421686747

In PARAMOUNT's second Star Trek film THE WRATH OF KHAN (directed by Nicholas Meyer), the decades seem to drop away and we're right back amidst those vintage Trek TV shows, thanks in great part to a spot on script and Ricardo Montalban's magnificent reprise of the evil superhuman of the ""Space Seed"" episode, marooned so long ago with 80 of his followers on Ceti Alpha V by Capt. (now Admiral) James T. Kirk.

Furthering the illusion of time stood still in this swashbuckling sci-fi adventure is Leonard Nimoy's recital of a revamped ""Space... the final frontier"" opening speech, also a self-admittedly aging Kirk's assignment to the equally high-mileage original USS Enterprise (NCC-1701), which has been reduced to an outmoded training ship.

Kirk and his crew of newbies, among them Vulcan/Romulan designated commander Lt. Saavik (Alley) are on a two-week milk run that includes the infamous Kobayashi Maru simulation, when barrel-chested Khan Noonien Singh and 15 other genetically engineered survivors take control of the USS Reliant and its commander, Pavel Chekov.

Khan and Reliant attack Space Station Regula 1, where Kirk's lover and adult son are developing a Genesis Device. After receiving Regula 1's SOS, Kirk relieves Saakik of command and warp speeds toward the station. While enroute, a surprise attack from Reliant cripples Enterprise and kills many of its green crew. Next comes a cat-and-mouse war sequence inspired by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-ENEMY-BELOW/dp/6301662954/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE ENEMY BELOW</a>&nbsp;(1957), a battle of wits between two old adversaries in which only one will survive.

I was really excited to see it because when I heard that they were going to start making Star Trek movies I immediately thought (like probably many other Star Trek fans) that they should bring back Khan who I hated in the original series episode Space Seed, I loved it when Capt. Kirk beat him to the ground in the engineering room. That said I had high hopes for The Wrath of Khan movie I was disappointed when I saw it because I was looking for the old original cast camaraderie from the original series which I thought they got back with the next movie Star Trek III: Search for Spock. I decided to watch it again after seeing the new Star Trek: Into Darkness movie and after this viewing it has become one of my favorite Star Trek movies, I even now think it is a better movie than Search for Spock which I still love, The Wrath of Khan is a more solid movie, it is very well written and I have always loved the iconic death scene at the end between Spock and Kirk the acting is very touching. I guess I can know appreciate it looking at it through mature eyes and not the eyes of a teenager looking for the same feelings that I get when I watch the original 60s series. I leave you with three iconic lines from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan: ""Khannnnn!"", ""Remember"", ""He's dead already"".",1371081600,,1445,4.182795698924731

244612,5,6300213803,"This is one of my personal favorites of the Star Trek big-screen productions.  It highlighted to a new level the friendship of the main characters and Ricardo Montalban was deliciously evil, reprising his role of ""Khan"" from the 1960's TV episode, ""Space Seed.""",1369008000,,261,5.069767441860465
244613,5,6300213803,"After 1979's Star Trek: The Motion Picture, despite financial success, was tepidly received by both critics and the audience, Paramount Pictures wrestled creative control of the Trek film series away from Gene Roddenberry and gave it to television producer Harve Bennett along with a drastically-reduced budget. After familiarizing himself with the original television series, Bennett zeroed in on a single episode, ""Space Seed,"" as holding the most story potential for his sequel, and he hired a young up-and-coming writer/director named Nicholas Meyer to helm the project. The rest, as they say, is history.

Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is by nearly every standard the crown jewel of the Star Trek franchise, the standard against which everything else will be judged. It is a pop culture milestone, the film that truly announced that Star Trek was back and it was going to stay that way. Despite some poorly aged production design (honestly, who thought oval-shaped screens on square boxes was a good idea?) the film still holds up quite well due to the excellent storytelling. Character, not spectacle, is paramount here; the cast's age is made an asset, not a disadvantage, to explore themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and coming to grips with one's mortality. Director Meyer's influence forced a more formal, naval appearance to the Starfleet uniforms, bringing a more seafaring, adventurous sensibility to the filmic universe, peppering the script with quotes from Shakespeare, Dickens, and Melville that inform the narrative, and despite the heavy subject matter being mindful to include a dollop of wit every so often to keep the film from sinking under the weight of melancholy. From Ricardo Montalban's operatic performance, Shatner's immortal cry of ""KHAAAAAAAN!"", the battle in the magenta hues of the Mutara Nebula, and what is easily the most emotional of all Trek finales, the film is littered with memorable moments.

When Paramount Pictures prepared the original Trek films for Blu-ray release in 2009, The Wrath of Khan was the only one in the batch to receive a full restoration, and the proof is in the pudding -- this is a gorgeous, filmic transfer with rich colors and a significant boost in detail; I had never noticed the numbers on U.S.S. Reliant's shuttle bays until viewing this Blu-ray. Sound is also excellent, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Horner-s-rousing-score/dp/B002IAPHK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Horner's rousing score</a>&nbsp;sounding better than ever.

Unlike the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/two-disc-DVD-special-edition/dp/B0000683DH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">two-disc DVD special edition</a>, the Blu-ray contains the original theatrical cut of the film instead of Nicholas Meyer's director's cut; most viewers (including myself) won't really notice as these are only minor trims, but it would have been nice if Paramount had taken advantage of seamless branching to offer both versions. Extras are all replicated, including Meyer's original commentary, along with a new commentary featuring Meyer and Manny Coto and a nice new interview with James Horner about his experience on the film, which was his big break into mainstream film scoring.

For Trekkies, for sci-fi geeks, for film lovers, this disc has my highest recommendation.",1369008000,4,3387,5.781563126252505

The colors of the Mutara Nebula are much more magical too and there was some good clean up was done of the Genesis cave.  It still looks like a glorified matte painting but now it has a depth of field that it never had before.

In PARAMOUNT's second Star Trek film THE WRATH OF KHAN (directed by Nicholas Meyer), the decades seem to drop away and we're right back amidst those vintage Trek TV shows, thanks in great part to a spot on script and Ricardo Montalban's magnificent reprise of the evil superhuman of the ""Space Seed"" episode, marooned so long ago with 80 of his followers on Ceti Alpha V by Capt. (now Admiral) James T. Kirk.

Furthering the illusion of time stood still in this swashbuckling sci-fi adventure is Leonard Nimoy's recital of a revamped ""Space... the final frontier"" opening speech, also a self-admittedly aging Kirk's assignment to the equally high-mileage original USS Enterprise (NCC-1701), which has been reduced to an outmoded training ship.

Kirk and his crew of newbies, among them Vulcan/Romulan designated commander Lt. Saavik (Alley) are on a two-week milk run that includes the infamous Kobayashi Maru simulation, when barrel-chested Khan Noonien Singh and 15 other genetically engineered survivors take control of the USS Reliant and its commander, Pavel Chekov.

Khan and Reliant attack Space Station Regula 1, where Kirk's lover and adult son are developing a Genesis Device. After receiving Regula 1's SOS, Kirk relieves Saakik of command and warp speeds toward the station. While enroute, a surprise attack from Reliant cripples Enterprise and kills many of its green crew.

245158,3,6300213803,"Scientists like to forget that it was Darwin's theory of evolution that led to the scientific racism of the early 20th Century and attendant atrocities, including eugenics and racial/ethnic genocide.

In this film it is proposed that Captain Kirk's ex-lover, along with his illegitimate son, have invented a technology with the power to reshape all matter in the universe into something delightful, like a giant Garden of Eden. The germ for this story-line probably began in the imaginative works of slightly off-balance Gene Roddenberry who consulted on this production. I imagine his thinking went something like this:

The Big Bang resulted in an orderly universe, so why can't sentient beings someday create  a technology that improves on the Big Bang?

If agnostic Roddenberry had taken a few minutes to think things through he might have concluded thus:

The Big Bang created a universe so vast, it boggles the mind. Despite all our probing we have yet to detect the slightest clue of life, or even suitable conditions for life anywhere else in the universe. Moreover, what we do know about other planets is they are staggeringly harsh environments; Earth is the only true oasis we know of formed from all the vast matter of the universe. Therefore, if man did someday harness the ability to rearrange matter on a galactic scale what is the probability that said rearrangement would result in anything more than more cold, forbidding, lifeless planets, asteroids, and the like? No, I think a better plot for a film would be for Kirk to take the Enterprise to the farthest reaches of the universe only to discover that Creator God, who fashioned oasis Earth, is near to every man, and every heart, if only they open themselves up to Him. Yes, that is the film I'll make.",1355529600,,1775,4.903333333333333

245255,5,6300213803,"Star Trek has had its high points and its low points over the years.  There have been some tremendous storys told, and some...  lackluster?...  ones, and some just terrible ones.

Note that I grew up with the original series.  Yes, there have been additional spin-off type series, supposedly set in the same universe, and they can be treated individually, but as far as I'm concerned, ""Star Trek"" is the original TV series and the movies based upon that, not ""The Next Generation"" or ""Voyager"" or ""Deep Space Nine"" or ""Enterprise"" or the new ""reboot movie"" done by JJ Abrams a couple of years ago.  Those are all largely separate enntities, all of which (yes, including the new flick) have different characters, different situations, different storytelling techhniques, and so forth.  This doesn't NECESSARIlY make those other spin-off ideas worse, or better, just different.  You can make your own calls about the quality of each individual spin-off.  In other words, I'm just defining my terms here.

That said, we can easily put the severan TNG-era movies into the comparison, as this movie far eclipses those as well.

In 1979, ""Star Trek - The Motion Picture"" came out.  It was the big-screen continuation of the original Star Trek TV show, supposedly ""updated.""  The quality of the visual effects was spectacular, and the new ship (it's not the same ship, it just happens to have the same name and the same general configuration) was pretty to look at.  The same actors were playing the same roles.

But... the FEEL was all wrong.  It lacked the real, HUMAN, interactions which were at the core of the original series' best storytelling.  So we had a ship which felt dreary, depressing, and dehumanizing inside.  We had costuming which might have been comfortable, but was visually dull and drab.  We had dialog which occasionally ""hinted"" at the close ""just like us"" human interaction which the original series was so successful for using, but mostly, it was actors staring at pretty lights with badly-acted ""awestruck looks"" on their faces.

SO...  despite being a technical masterpiece (for the most part), this first movie was not considered the sort of blockbuster which would have been required to make additional movies.

Fortunately, someone at Paramount realized that it wasn't the fault of the cast, or of the overall concept, but rather of the leadership for the production, which led to the storytelling failures of this film.  And they realized that they had a lot of property, built for that first film, which would be able to be re-used at very little cost for additional films.

SO...  they dumped the production team (including Star Trek's creator, Gene Roddenberry, who at this point had lost track of what he'd originally known so well when creating the original series!) and hired an entirely new production team.  A team who had no attachments to Star Trek whatsoever.

They hired a well-known TV line-producer, Harve Bennett, as the executive producer (taking over from ROddenberry).  Bennett was someone who understood budgeting, scheduling, and the proper way to ""hire the right people and then get out of their way,"" all areas in which Roddenberry had failed, very badly, in while making TMP.  Bennett held sway over the majority of the remaining original-series films, with just a couple of exceptions, and much of the success of the films he led can be laid directly at his feet.

They hired a really good director, who understood what the director of ""The Motion Picture"" had failed to grasp... science fiction is just set-dressing, and the storytelling must be about PEOPLE, not about ""fantastic special effects"" or ""high-concepts"" even if you're wrapped up in those things.  All the ""science fiction"" trappings of the story are there for is to open up possible HUMAN storytelling which might not be practical in ""real world"" situations.  Nicholas Meyer got that, and got it very, very well.  He, frankly, didn't care at all about the ""space"" elements of this, but he clearly understood the CHARACTERS.

The budget was reduced, dramatically, from what was available in the first film.  Nevertheless, they had enough budget to create a new ship (the Reliant, a sister ship to the Enterprise) to make new uniforms (which seemed more real, and were much more visually appealing, patterned in large part upon real-world military uniforms).  They re-used quite a bit from the first movie (the two of the new sets... the space station transporter room and the Enterprise torpedo bay...  were both repaints of portions of a set... the Klingon bridge... from the first movie, for example), they raided ""stock prop"" warehouses for set-dressing (the same ""scifi set dressing"" bits seen in this film were seen in dozens and dozens of other 1970s, 1980s and 1990s TV shows), and so forth.  Heck, they made new ""communicators"" from found equipment from the local Home Depot!

They did hire Lucas's special effects house, ""Industrial Light and Magic,"" to do the visual effects, and they did a fine job,  Again, to save money, they re-used some shots from the first film, so while the model of the Enterprise did get a new paint job or this film, it still has the original paint job in quite a few shots.

My point is simple...  they were FRUGAL in this film.  Instead of planning out science-fictiony spectacle, as the first movie did, they focused almost entirely on the human storytelling.  The other stuff was, as it should be, all ""set dressing"" to help the audience forget that they're watching actors on a soundstage.  And it worked...  magnificently.  (A lesson which J.J. Abrams seems to have failed on, in my judgement, in his reboot movie.)

The storytelling in this film is what makes it rise head and shoulders above any other Star Trek film, and over most non-Star Trek films for that matter.  We get characters who we can imagine actually knowing, and liking, in real life (something we had in the best examples of the original series as well, but lacked, entirely, in the first movie).  We got drama from situations which, while wrapped in science-fiction trappings, were really about the most fundamental human emotions...  a villain who has (understandable, if irrational) rage issues directed against the hero, and a hero who feels that his life is ""winding down"" and sees all the lost opportunities and mistakes behind him.

It's a trope that ""Captain Kirk slept with every girl he met"" in the original series (it's not really true, by the way, but it's a trope nevertheless).  This movie showed the ""leading man romantic"" role he often filled in a very different light, by introducing the great love of his life, the ""little blonde lab tech"" he was mentioned as having ""almost married"" in the very first appearance of Kirk in the original series, and it turns out that he also has a son...  a son who doesn't know that Kirk is his father.  It actually explains quite a bit, and shows that there are consequences we all have to deal with for our choices.  And, thankfully, this turns out OK in the end (at least in this film!)

The dialog is written so well, even with somewhat different visuals, there's no question but that these are the same characters we know and love from the original series.  It's dramatic, when appropriate, funny (in a realistic way, not a slapstick way) when appropriate, and just COMFORTABLE all the rest of the time.  No stilted ""science-fictiony"" dialog, just normal people having normal conversations about imporant things in their lives.

The acting also reflects the pinnacle of the Star Trek films, and is a key element to the above.  Nick Meyer did a terrific turn as director, and as a result even some of the more lackluster actors turn in terrific performances.  I'm not a huge George Takei fan overall (""Sulu""), and I never really liked the Chekov character (though I grew to love Walter Koenig, the actor who played him, through watching Babylon 5) but this film shows both of these guys at their best.  Nichele Nichols, as Uhura, does a good job, but she's probably the most underutilized original-series actor in this film (a sad but necessary requirement of reasonable storytelling (the comms officer is seldom going to be a major player in real-life events, and in this film, the storytelling tool priority over ""giving everyone their moment""...  something later films ended up trying, way too hard at times, to do)  James Doohan's turn as Scotty in this film was also ""lightly written"" but had some really good moments.  But, as with the original series, this movie was built around the ""big three trio,"" Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.

One of the things that made the original series work so well was that the big-three characters sort of grew into psychological archetypes...  Kirk as the ""superego"" (The psychology term for the part which makes decisions, based upon the input of the other two elements), the ""ego"" (the logical, rational side of our mind), through Spock, and the ID (the emotional, feelings-based side of our minds) which obviously was McCoy.  This is very clearly played out in a sequence in this film, set in Kirk's cabin, where they discuss the concept of ""Genesis"" in this film.

Finally, this film did something I LOVED.  It took risks, and make ""permanent"" changes to the status-quo, in universe.  (I put ""permanent"" in quotes because, unfortunately, some of these ""permanent"" changes got reversed later...  so the brave choices made in this film largely got erased in later films, putting us back into the ""status quo,"" which was just a horrible mistake as far as I'm concerned!)

The best films, but best TV shows, the best storytelling in general, must involve REAL GROWTH AND CHANGE.  This is part of why Babylon 5 remains my all-time favorite TV series...  and why, from a pure storytelling perspective, Deep Space Nine may in fact be the best drama told in the Star Trek universe.  You have to have real jeaopardy, real risk.  Characters... BELOVED characters...  need to be at real risk, and occasionally may need to die... and STAY THAT WAY.

Otherwise, none of the storytelling ends up having any real impact.

This film made real changes.  It introduced two three major new characters, all of whom should have become part of the ""recurring cast"" for future films (but one of whom was never seen again, one of whom was later removed entirely, and one of whom was badly recast... no offense to the replacement, but this character ceased to be the same character!)

The situation at the end of the film isn't the same as we saw during the original TV series, or at the beginning of the film.  Characters have changed, new relationships are being formed...  and new character dynamics would likely be present in future films.  It was...  perfect.  It just works.  Beautifully.

Later Star Trek movies were still fairly good, to varying degrees, but they lost sight of the ""story first, above all"" on occasion...  needing to give every actor their ""moment"" in each film (even if it doesn't really serve the storytelling), or drawing back from taking big risks, or (worst of all) REVERSING the ""changes"" which this film gave us, instead putting us back into the ""same thing, with no changes, but with older actors"" situation.

The last ""Original series"" film was also the second best...  ""The Undiscovered Country.""  It's no shock that this film was also helmed by Nick Meyer, and while a bit lesser than this film, it's a fine film as well.  And it also deals with real change, albeit in different ways.

While Kirk, the chronic ""cheater"" of death, must finally face the consequences of his past in the revelation of his lost son, and in Khan. The final battle-scene of the film plays out spectacularly as a classic submarine-movie type hunt, while the wise and loyal Spock must sacrifice himself to save his friends. Redeemed by Spock's death, Kirk gains new wisdom into our frail and mortal human condition, and gains new life in the ""humanity"" of Spock. You need not love Star Trek to find this movie great. Check out Star Trek OS episode ""Space Seed"" for the back-story of Khan and to marvel further at Ricardo Montalban's physique.",1346889600,,1124,4.710659898477157

245340,2,6300213803,"Star Trek: II The Wrath Of Khan is easily the most over-rated of all the Trek movies.  Ricardo Montalban replaces the frightening believability of his Khan in the Space Seed TV episode, all restrained intellectual and physical energy, with hammy, scenery chewing bravado.  Instead of the majestic and ambitious 2001-esque Star Trek: The Motion Picture, with it's so Roddenberry-esque tale of different life forms communicating, understanding and actually combining, we have big spaceships firing laser weapons at each other and plenty of boring running, jumping and falling down - if TMP had the ambition to take Kubrick as it's model, WOK settled for the considerably inferior Lucas.  Even the - admittedly VERY moving - Spock death scene means absolutely nothing, because he's back in the next one.

If you prefer George Lucas to Stanley Kubrick, you'll love it.

Mind you, compared to the horror that was JJ Abrams' movie, it's a masterpiece.  But then again, so are most movies.",1345593600,5,982,5.144654088050315

245342,5,6300213803,"By far the best ""Trek"" movie! Inspired by what is probably the best installment of the 1960's TV series, ""Space Seed."" Ricardo Montalban as ""Khan,"" is one of the greatest protagonists in Sci-Fi motion picture history! His portraying of Khan, is just a magnificent brooding performance of single minded revenge! The scene where Chekov realizes he has landed on the planet they left Khan on, raises my neck hairs every time I see it!

The ending battle & Spock's death were truly of epic proportion. I not afraid to say, I shed a tear every time I see Spock's death scene. The bond between him & Kirk & the rest of the crew as they watch his death is heart breaking. It's if my long time best friend had died, even though I know Spock comes back from the dead, & what can you say about the funeral at space? Truly heart rendering, even Saavik is shedding tears.

Masterful film making!

As is always true, skip the Director's Cut. Editors are well paid to do their job, and this movie is no exception. As if the film weren't great enough on its own, it makes a terrific sequel to the Space Seed episode from the original series, with Montalban playing the same role in both shows.

245345,4,6300213803,"I like this one better than the first one, although I'm not sure my reasons are fair ones. When the first movie was made, they did not know how the public was going to react. By the time they got to this one, they'd already had millions of fans screaming ""More! More!"" and they knew it would sell. So they could afford to spend a bigger budget, including for script writers.

Ricardo Montalban is Muy Macho as Khan, a criminal who had been been born in the 20th century, was frozen for long enough to emerge in the 23rd century with his band of genetically altered hippies (OK, maybe they are not quite like hippies, but that's what I kept seeing). Fifteen years ago, by Federation time, Kirk had pronounced sentence on him and marooned him (with adequate supplies) and his crew on an apparently barren planet. [Anyone remember the episode? Can you write the title and a brief synopsis in the comments?]

Meanwhile, Spock is in command of the Enterprise, and out on a training mission with a bunch of inexperienced recruits, including an attractive female Vulcan who, for some reason, is consistently referred to as Mister. But when word comes that Space Station Regula One, which is commanded by an old girlfriend of Admiral Kirk's, is in trouble and they need to respond, Kirk takes over as commander of the ship and Spock goes back to being science officer.

Meanwhile, Chekhov has been assigned to another ship, apparently second in command to an elegant black captain whose name I unfortunately cannot recall. Their ship is captured by Khan, who takes them over as puppets with the aid of the larval form of ""the only natural life form"" on the planet. A nasty thing, it enters through the ear and renders the victim a puppet to be controlled by Khan. So they are running the other ship for Khan, and of course Kirk trusts Chekhov and so believes what he says in communication.

That's the set-up; just in case you haven't seen it, I won't give anything much away. Suffice it to say that you should keep your eye on the chief scientist's son.",1337126400,,2046,4.597260273972603
245346,4,6300213803,"It's been touted as the best Star Trek movie of all time, and I'd be hard to dispute that.  I'm a huge Trek fan, and love the parables presented by the characters and stories, as well as just the flavor of the franchise itself.  Trek brings me back to a time in the late 60s and early 70s when it was cool to be a sci-fi geek among sci-fi geeks.  We had or own clique, and welcomed everyone who was willing to share in a hopeful future where the bad guys weren't ourselves, but the mysteries we had yet to unfold and uncover.  Well, that, and occasional Klingon or Romulan.

ST2 hearkens back to the first season of the original 1960s TV series, and reintroduces a classic villain.  We are given a taste of the past by remolding it in the future for a new challenge.  Shatner, Nimoy, et al, as well as Ricardo Montablan and Judson Scott who, when asked why his name didn't appear on the credits, told us in the audience ""You know, I could've sworn I did this movie..."" then quipped about a question of why he smoked, to which he replied ""Well, it was either these or Chicken McNuggets...""  Whatever.  Personally I think the guy may have been embarrassed to appear in a ST film, even though it's the most popular one to this day.

But, to the film; it's really good, but I think the director's cut is weighed down by insertion of extended cuts and scenes that hold back a tighter film; the one that I saw in the theatre on opening day.  I guess if I were still in my fandom heyday, then I would appreciate the longer version.  But, as a film maker, I do critique it as being over indulgent and catering to the hard core fanbase.  But hey, it's all about marketing in the end, and if the fans like it, then who are we to complain?

I titled this review ""A bit dated..."" because it is.  We see regular TVs mounted for a world that would surely by now have something beyond flat screen TVs.  The blue screen work is respectable, but the print shows some of the imperfections of the matte work.  Not a big deal, but it's there for the more critical eye to catch, and possibly contemplate.  The ""futuristic"" CGI looks like CGI from the era, because hey, it is.  But for the time that was state of the art cutting edge computer graphics' technology being showcased in a major sci-fi release.  Impressive for the time, but again, dated.

The gem of this film is that it was made.  And, get this, made on a TV shooting schedule.  The shots are tight and basic, and the cuts are few, which means this film's story and actors had to carry the film, because the cinematography sure wasn't going to do it (however respectable the spaceship shots are).  Shooting like a movie of the week makes for an infinitely stronger film with the material at hand.  And the film was probably brought in close to budget.

There are, of course, the dramatics that occur in the story.  They are powerful to the classic dyed in the wool Star Trek fan.  They hit some heavier than others, but always garnish a reaction.

Well written, well acted, well shot in spite of the production restrictions, this film shows how you can crank out first class material on a limited budget, make back your negative cost, and still please the fans.

Definitely not one to miss.",1335398400,2,3232,4.374161073825503
245347,5,6300213803,"While fans may still (and likely always will) quibble about which of the franchise films is the best, the choices usually come down to three: the second, fourth, and sixth installments.  (Though I do think that part III is sometimes unfairly maligned.)

""Wrath of Khan"" gets my vote.  To my mind, ""Wrath of Khan"" contains nearly all of the best elements of `Star Trek': a perfectly balanced combination of adventure, wit, and drama.

The interplay between the regular characters is spot-on here (chiefly between the lead trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, although Scotty and Chekov also get some pretty good screen time), and for one of the first times, the franchise characters are allowed a fuller humanity.  The subplots surrounding Kirk's estranged family, advancing age, and stalled career aspirations (highlighted in a marvelous early dialogue scene between Kirk and McCoy) help to root the drama in a genuine human story.  This is important, as the villain (and his story) is so operatic.

That last note - my use of the term `operatic' to describe Khan - isn't a criticism.  Ricardo Montalban imbues the role with enormous degrees of passion and theatricality.  Another performer might have come across as over the top or cartoonish, but Montalban somehow manages to avoid that trap, making Khan a passionate, human character.  A villain, certainly, but an interesting one, and one whose motives are worthy of driving the movie.

There is a wonderful scene - and one moment, in particular - that unfolds about 2/3 of the way through the film, and it clearly displays the film's primary charms.  It's the scene set in the Genesis cave.  Kirk and a significant female character share a genuinely human conversation about the challenges of middle-age - something almost unthinkable in the old series.  It's a fine scene that accentuates the original series' emphasis on character interplay.  And then, a few minutes later, comes that moment: an exchange between Kirk and Khan - Khan on his spaceship, and Kirk still in the Genesis cave. (Fans of the movie will likely know precisely which moment I'm alluding to.)  Montalban and Shatner both play the scene with passion; but then Shatner takes it up a notch, in a moment of deliriously entertaining, Shatner-esque passion that encapsulates the genuinely sincere, occasionally cheesy charms of this series at its best.

Note: if you get a chance, watch the Director's Cut.  There's not a huge difference between the two versions (and alas, the Director's Cut isn't available on Blu-Ray), but the few added minutes do help to flesh out and explain a subplot involving Scotty.",1334016000,,2626,5.02540415704388

No spoilers from me: The story starts with the search for a suitable planet to test an new Federation funded science experiment entitled ""Genesis"" that ends up encountering the survivors of the ""Botany Bay"", lead by Khan(Ricardo Montalbn) who was (in the ""Space Seed"" episode) marooned by Kirk. While this was happening, Admiral Kirk was helping to train a new crew of mostly cadets on the Enterprise and, as fate\writers would have it, happened to be in the area when Khan takes an interest in the Genesis project. From there we learn more about Kirk's past, get introduced to new characters (Lt. Saavik), here Kirk yell ""KHHAAAAAAANNN"" (love that), and get the plot device to make the next movie.

Despite several liberties taken with the previous story line, like Chekov being recognized by Khan when he was not cast in ""Space Seed"", this gets most important elements right and is a good representation of the Star Trek franchise.

245447,5,6300213803,"In fact, one of the best SF movies they've ever made.

Very few people are fans equally of Star Trek and Star Wars.  You may like both, but at some point you prefer one over the other.  This is movie is so good that, if you're one of the Star Wars partisans, you'll consider converting.

Brilliant pacing, brilliant script, brilliant villain, brilliant ending.  I love to complain about movies but am drawing a blank on this one:  what's not to like?

As just one example of how good the script is:  the movie starts off with the vaunted Admiral Kirk effin' up.  And it's a royal f-up, too.  You just wanna smack him, but that's what makes the script so excellent.  If he had put those shields up as per Starfleet regulations, he would have been boring and predictable, like Aeneas.  As it is, he's human and believable, and that failing draws you into the film.  Definitely the best moment in a movie filled with great moments:  when Kirk fails to say ""shields up"".

245449,3,6300213803,"The movie itself, if you didn't already know, is far and away the best Trek film they ever made. Nuff said.

The blu ray is a mixed bag. Certain scenes are incredibly crisp and clear - you couldn't ask for much more from a 30 year old film. Other scenes are actually blurry. I think this has to do with how the film was originally shot. Where it is most noticeable are scenes with Ricardo Montalban or Shatner. They seem almost out of focus. This is evident in certain background elements in these shots as well. I read somewhere that certain actors were shot in very soft focus to mask their age. If this is so it's pretty ridiculous. Esp when you cut between Shatner (blurry) and Nimoy or Kelly (very clear).  So there's a good chance the picture flaws have nothing to do with the transfer, and everything to do with the egos of a few aging actors.

The sound is not so great. Sound effects are booming and fill the room impressively, but dialogue can easily get lost, even with DAC cranked up. Some dialogue sounds clipped, and others (esp, again, Shatner) are mumbly and unclear.

Although I point out the flaws, this is still a very serviceable print of a great film. If you can pick it up on the cheap like I did, it is a definite upgrade over the DVD version.",1311292800,,1266,4.351694915254237
245510,5,6300213803,"Star Trek: The Motion Picture(1979) was a minor success at the box office. The studio was willing to green light a sequel with a lower budget of $11 million and most of the creative control was given to writer/producer Harve Bennett. Gene Roddenberry had an idea for Star Trek II where Klingons would go back in time and prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy, but the movie studio didn't give approval. In Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan(1982), Khan(Ricardo Montalban) and his followers escape from a planet colony and steal the Starship Reliant. Khan Noonien Singh was the bad guy in the Star Trek episode 'Space Seed'. Khan also steals the Genesis Torpedo; it's a terraforming device that can be used as a weapon. Admiral Kirk(William Shatner) takes command of the Enterprise when Space Station Regula doesn't respond. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is dark and violent, but it's also action-packed and thrilling. It was well-made considering the limited budget. Director Nicholas Meyer(Time After Time) adds a swashbuckling sense of adventure into the film. The late Merritt Butrick is quite good as Kirk's son, David. He gives an earnest performance and doesn't ""phone in"" the role. This film has the famous catchphrase yelled by Kirk, ""KHAAAAAAAN! KHAAAAAAAAAN!"" James Horner(Aliens, Wolfen) wrote a good music score for Star Trek II and III.
Star Trek II started a story arc that completes itself in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home(1986). This film has an unpleasant scene where Khan puts a Ceti Alpha eel in Chekov's ear! Some clever stop motion, animation, and cloud tanks were used to keep the special effects budget under control. The models for the USS Enterprise and the USS Reliant were filmed with VistaVision and Dykstraflex Cameras. Some early computer animation was used for the Genesis Torpedo video. The Starfleet Uniforms were redesigned to look more like naval uniforms. They were made with red/burgundy cloth. The critical and box office success helped to renew interest in Star Trek in 1982.

Despite a myriad of technical blunders (what the heck is an energizer, anyway?), occasionally hackneyed dialogue, and characterization that occasionally missed the mark (the Spock-McCoy arguments struck me as a bit too vicious), ST II continues to be an entertaining romp with characters we know better than our own families.

Granted, the uniforms were a bit jarring at first, but after a while, they kind of grow on you.

Bottom line: As a movie, it's a great action-adventure romp, with great characters, from the familiar Enterprise crew and the now revenge-driven Khan to everyone's favorite Vulcan-Romulan junior officer, Lt. Saavik (Kirstie Alley had just enough of that Romulan passion to show everyone ""I'm not a Spock clone in drag!""

The actors, including those from the original TV show and those like Ricardo Montalban and Kirstie Alley will be appreciated, especially if you grew up in the 1980's.

For the latter; this version of the movie, the ""Director's Cut"" is, as far as this 40+ year old's memory can remember, identical to the original movie with the exception of two things.  One, they have added in several deleted scenes (I seem to remember these from the ""Deleted Scenes"" on older Star Trek II DVD's).  Two, the audio gets better at times - sometimes during the deleted scenes and sometimes during the regular scenes where I'm 99% sure they had to re-dub some of the dialog.  Yet, all in all, these changes freshen it up a hair for those of us who have seen this movie 200 times! ;-)

All in all, especially in HD, this was fun to watch - a nice couple of hours of entertainment as well as a nice ""blast from the past"" for this Trekkie.",1296345600,,1340,4.332

245516,5,6300213803,"There are only two space battles in this film: the brief, vicious exchange of fire when the Enterprise first engages the Reliant, and the more drawn-out sequence in the nebula at the end. Only a few shots are fired in each battle. Most of the time is spent explaining the strategy of the opponents. The pacing in The Wrath Of Khan is masterful. Especially when compared to the horrible&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/new/dp/B002HWRYJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">new</a>&nbsp;Trek film, which contains so many cuts that it is impossible to process what is going on in each shot.

When the starships do fire on each other, a single shot inflicts a lot of damage. This is the only Star Trek film where starships look convincingly dangerous. Later films have a video-game quality in which ships can take many direct hits and still remain more or less fully operational. However, in the short first skirmish of The Wrath Of Khan, both ships are nearly crippled. Because of this, they have to spend the rest of the film warily circling around each other. There is a sense that their captains are thinking hard. Cunning replaces firepower. Of course, this adds to the suspense.

There are also no fist-fights. Kirk and Khan never meet face-to-face. This is perfect. Shatner was already too old here to punch people in the face convincingly anymore. But as a starship captain, he's terrific. During the first encounter with Khan, you can feel that Kirk's mind is racing to try to get ahead of Khan, as Kirk charmingly stalls for time.

Khan himself is the best of all Star Trek villains, and that's a list that includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malcolm-McDowell/dp/B000UJ48T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malcolm McDowell</a>, David Warner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/F-Murray-Abraham/dp/B00006DEFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">F. Murray Abraham</a>&nbsp;and Marc Alaimo. Ricardo Montalban adopts an old-fashioned style of acting, with obviously theatrical diction and intonation, as well as aristocratic mannerisms. But, fake though this style may be, it is riveting -- it is the style of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Greek-tragedy/dp/1580495931/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Greek tragedy</a>. Around the time this film was made, the Star Trek franchise became the only remaining popular outlet for this old-fashioned style, and so Star Trek attracted the style's best actors. In my opinion, that's the best thing about the first six Trek films.

Even aside from Khan's performance, there is a certain old-fashioned strain running through the film -- it is clear that it was written by people who at least knew how to steal from the best. The first half boasts elegant, distinctive writing reminiscent of an older generation of Hollywood films (""Prayer, Mr. Saavik -- Klingons don't take prisoners,"" ""except, of course, happy birthday, surely the best of times,"" ""do you remember the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?"" and so on). Even the uniforms are sly throwbacks, designed to give just a hint of historical romance, a subliminal association with adventure stories about life on the high seas. No wonder this proved to be Trek's most enduring and popular uniform design.

The subplot with Kirk's midlife crisis is well-drawn. They say that Shatner is a bad actor, but in fact, he is an excellent actor, it's just that he's only capable of playing a single role. But in that one role, he is perfect. Here he poignantly shows his character's feelings of loneliness and regret over the fact that his heroic career caused him to pass up a chance for a normal family life. The film ends on a note of touching optimism; it is shown that, although Kirk will probably never settle down, at least he has a family waiting for him somewhere, similar to Odysseus. (Too bad&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-III/dp/B00006G8HX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek III</a>&nbsp;trampled all over that message.) Kirk is also given a jolt when his willful negligence of regulations leads to a severe miscalculation that claims the lives of many crew members. His ensuing regret is palpable.

Meanwhile, Spock completes his transformation into a very human, if very reserved figure. His tone in the conversation when he surrenders his command to Kirk -- not what he says, but his voice itself -- reveals how well they know each other and how comfortable they are talking together. As for McCoy, he usually doesn't get much to do in Trek films, but he is fairly prominent here. He gets a few good moments with Kirk in the beginning, showing that his friendship with Kirk is just as deep, and maybe closer, than Kirk's friendship with Spock. The conflict gives him a few opportunities (especially on the station) to show his selfless nature and willingness to risk his life to save somebody else.

The minor characters pretty much just do their usual duties (and Chekov gets hurt, yet again), but the original series was never an ensemble show. It's all about the friendship between Kirk, Spock and McCoy. That theme comes through here, although McCoy is a bit too harsh when he snaps at Spock. It would have been fine if they had other scenes together, but they don't. The new character, Saavik, has a small but memorable role, though it becomes more memorable once you've seen her whole character arc through Star Trek IV.

There are other great Star Trek films -- personally, I'd even give a slight edge to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-VI/dp/B0000UJL96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek VI</a>. But in terms of pure storytelling, The Wrath Of Khan is brilliant. The phaser beams might look a bit simplistic now, but the film's taut, gripping tension still makes it vastly superior to any present-day special effects extravaganza.

Many of the scenes even appear almost out of focus. Something either went wrong during transfer or they did not use a proper, original source. And I've seen too many much older movies on Blu-ray that look like they were filmed yesterday for anyone to tell me that the problem here is the fact that it's an older movie. Hogwash.

I don't care about how much they clean up the sound and remix it, or if it sounds better in Dolby Digital or DTS, or if the picture looks grainy or what not ( as long as it looks good ), and God knows what else.  I go the movie theaters to sit down for 2 hours, watch an enjoyable film and then I pass judgement on it and if I enjoy it or not I will remember it.  Being a long-time fan of the Star Trek series I recently watched this film on Netflix after not having seen it in over 10 years, and I think this Star Trek flim, the best of the series, only gets better with age.  Nothing about this flim could be better insofar as the Star Trek universe is concerned, and of course the late great Ibero-Latino actor Ricardo Montalban was the standout.  So on to my review, and this is just a character study, and I won't give away the film to those who HAVEN""T seen it:

  After spending more than 15 years in exile on a planet known as Seti-Alpha 5, the great "" gentically modified Superman from the late 20th century "", a former warlord and prince of late 20th century Earth, the villanous Khan ( played by the late great superbly famous and well-respected Ricardo Montalban, God please preserve him and keep his soul safe ) is able to extract revenge upon the hero of the Star Trek universe, the legendary revered and lauded greatest Captian of the United federation of Planets, Captain James T. ( Tiberius ) kirk.  He, of course, does not succeed but this film emphasises and illustrates the great havoc and tragedy the great sin "" wrath "" can wreak upon a person's soul and the people it is directed at.

  Khan, a megalomanical madman who was a lesser version of Adolf Hitler in his own time, was awakened out of his cryogenic bedchamber along with members of the crew of ship 15 years earlier by Captian Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise, all of whom are in this movie.  Through the course of that episode of the origial "" Star Trek "" series, which I can recall bits and pieces of, Khan tried to commandeer the Enterprise and kill the crew but was stopped and ultimately defeated.  Kirk, being a just man and not prone to the violent and sadistic tendencies of a man like Khan, chose to exile him and his crew on a lush, green, fertile planet known as Seti-Alpha 5 and thought that that was the last he would ever hear of him.  Since Seti-Alpha 5 had so much going for it as a planet, Khan accepted, brought along his crew and also brought along his girlfriend, a very beautiful crewmember of the Enterprise, who had fallen in love with him and most likely later became his wife ( to whom he was referring to early in the movie, which was most likely the key component fueling his hatred towards Captian Kirk ).

  15 years later Khan was discovered BY ACCIDENT on planet thought to be Seti-Alpha 6 by a Federation vessel and that's when Khan's wrath broke loose.  The ensuing cat-and-mouse game was a true game of human chess to watch unfold on the screen and Khan's venemous hatred could be felt even across the screen ( the mark of a truly great actor, the ability to elicit emotions in the crowd.  Actors who have perfected their craft are able to do such things well, they are like charges of electricity.  Some are more intense than others, some you don't feel at all.  Ricardo Montalban was a great actor. )

  Captian Kirk, belng a wily and crafty man, was trying desperetely to keep up with his opponent and was doing well, but he was aided in great part by his best friend, occasional opponent, mentor and almost half-brother the alien from the planet Vulcan, Spock ( played by Leonard Nimoy ).  Without Spock's guidance it would be easy to surmise that the games between Kirk and Khan would have reached a fever pitch and the ensuing clash would have resulted in the destruction of many lives, but the sacrifices we make "" are for the good of the many "".  And thus, tragedy ensued and carried over into the next 2 Star Trek flims.  Star Trek 2:  The Warth of Khan was really the first part of a 3-story arc that culminated in Star Trek 4.  You cannot watch this film and not watch the other 2 because they are bital in knowing how this story reached it's culmination.

  Star Trek is an institution that has inspired generations of people to look beyond the limits of the Earth and themselves and ask themselves questions about their lives, the Earth, the world around them, and ultimately what it heams to be alive, and more specifically, human.  Forget the negative connotations people have about Star Trek fans, the much ridculted and lampooned "" Trekkies "", becauae those are the people who have true enlightenment and will look forward to the cosmos and keep the shining light of the human race burning forever, if we can learn to get along like the citizens of the United Federation of Planets do.  We don't have to be friends, one big happy family, or even like each other, but like the Star Trek universe the world is large and everybody can prosper in their own natural environments if they don't have the constraints that people who would like to oppress others, such as Khan, would like to impose upon others.  that's why the United States of America should NEVER, EVER ABANDON IT'S SPACE PROGRAM AND LET IT BE DEVELOPED BY NATIONS THAT ARE NOT OUR FRIENDS.  SUPPORT OUR AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AND KEEP AMERICA STRONG AND ALWAYS LOOKING SKYWARD INTO THE HEAVENS.

Sadly, I was tragically disappointed when I finally saw it.  The grain is abysmal.  I don't understand how anyone can say this picture is great.  I understand that the movie was made in the early 80s, but Bladerunner doesn't look nearly as bad.  Not nearly.

I can only assume that the folks raving about the great picture on this disc are actually studio plants sent here to deceive people into buying this, or they're undiscerning viewers watching on some portable hand-held blu-ray player or a similar substandard playback device.  Star Trek 2009 has a great picture.  The Dark Knight has a great picture.  Bladerunner has a good picture.  The picture on this disc is poor in comparison.

If you love the Wrath of Khan, buy the movie.  Despite my disappointment, I don't REGRET buying it as it is better looking (more detailed) than the DVD.  But if you have a quality 1080P monitor, then you should temper your expectations, as this won't compare favorably to any of the truly high quality blu-ray releases out there.  Hopefully, Paramount will give us a better, cleaner high-def transfer in the future.

The picture was beautiful, practically flawless.  None of that ugly video noise I saw on my computer screen was visible here.  If I hadn't seen it myself, I wouldn't have believed that there would be such a huge difference in picture quality between two setups. I can only assume that my computer was exposing shortcomings in the transfer that my PS3 and lower resolution HDTV are not capable of revealing.

I really liked how Kahn's need for revenge is his down fall.  When Chekov is in the Botany Bay, you see that on the shelf are a lot of book. One book that really stands out is Moby Dick, kind of forshadows what's going to happen to him.

With all of this is doing on, it seems that some scientists have created something called, ""Genesis"". Genesis can literally create life from nothing. However for this to happen, it has to destroy whatever life in on a planet or moon for this to work. In the wrong hands, it can be a weapon.

So I was pleasantly surprised when ""Wrath of Khan"" ended up looking, to me, rather good on Blu-ray. It's by no means a perfect print; for example, there's usually some fuzz (or whatever the technical term is) visible on scenes with dark lighting, such as when the Enterprise bridge goes to red alert. But by and large, this print is much nicer than the previous DVD versions.

I compared some DVD scenes to Blu-ray ones to determine whether the upgrade was worth it, and I think it was. Check out the scene when Spock gives Kirk his birthday present; on Blu-ray, you can see all the fine details on that giant globe they're standing next to, whereas on the DVD print it just looks like some glass blob. Similarly, the nebula scenes look much clearer on the Blu-ray.

Some fans seem annoyed that ""digital noise reduction"" has been applied to the Star Trek movies. Again, I'm no technical expert, but I believe this means that the artifacting/fuzz/whatever-you-call-it has been digitally ""painted out"" to give the film a cleaner look. This has led some fans to complain that the ST films now look artificially painted over, or waxy, or whatever. I sympathize with this complaint, but I think there's a tough choice to be made here; either studios can digitally ""paint out"" flaws, resulting in a slightly artificial look, or they can leave the flaws in, resulting in a distracting grainy look. Based on my Blu-ray experiences so far, I favor the noise reduction; for example, the Star Trek Blu-rays look much nicer to me than Fargo, which looks like it was shot through a layer of gauze.

The only real disappointment is that ""Wrath of Khan"" is only available in its theatrical cut, not the (slightly) better extended cut. It's a shame that Paramount doesn't give you a choice between the two versions; for ""Khan,"" I'd pick the extended cut, and for ""Undiscovered Country"" I'd go with the theatrical one, but so far Paramount has not released versions that offer the option of switching.

245684,5,6300213803,"This movie flat out rocks.  I mean it is awesome.  Star Trek the Motion Picture was a critical failure, garbage pile that it was, but a financial success.  The studio decided to try making one more movie, with a much lower budget.  They didn't let Gene Roddenberry have much involvement with this project, which is probably a good thing.  They hired Nicholas Meyer to direct this movie, who had no knowledge of Star Trek.  He watched the entire original series, and particularly liked the episode ""Space Seed.""  This episode features the first appearance of Khan Nooien Singh, and is one of the only episodes of the series that I liked.  He decided to make Khan the primary villian of the sequel.  When the film was released, it was a huge success, critically and financially.  It is still considered by some to be the best Star Trek movie of all time, even better than the 2009 reboot.

Kirk is longing for the days of years past when he was captain, and is getting depressed in his old age.

He captures Chekov and the captain of Reliant, and sets out to obtain Genesis.  He also wants to find and kill Kirk, who he blames for the death of his wife.  Marla Mcgivens, the dumb chick from Space Seed, who fell in love with Khan.  Khan attacks and severly criples Enterprise, but they are able to fight him off.  Then Kirk and a few others beam to the Genesis space station.  They discover Carol Marcus, Kirk's old girlfriend, and their son, David.  Khan tries again to kill Kirk, but is unsuccessful.  He decides to leave Kirk on the planet to die.  However, Enterprise beams them back on board.  They engage Reliant in a spectacular battle, and Enterprise gets the upper hand.  However, Khan sets off the Genesis torpedo, crazed in his attempt to kill Kirk.  Enterprise's warp drive is busted, so Spock goes into a room with radiation in it and fixes the problem.  He sacrifices himself to save the Enterprise, which is able to escape just in time.  Although Khan is dead, he had inadvertantly succeeded in hurting Kirk by killing his friend  The torpedo creates a luscious, livable planet out of the dead moon by the station.  Kirk loads Spock's body into a torpedo tube and shoots him out onto the Genesis planet.  He then contemplates that if Genesis is capable of producing life, then maybe it can revive Spock.
 Again, this movie is awesome.  It has one of the best villians in the Star Trek cannon, (I don't want to say best, because I've heard that the bad guy on Deep Space Nine is the best) it has visuals which were pretty good for the 1980s, and it set the stage for much more Star Trek.  With the success of this movie, they made more sequels, and eventually four more Star Trek television shows.  If they hadn't done such an outstanding job on this movie, Star Trek would probably have ended back then.  If you have never seen this movie, or you've never seen Star Trek at all, buy this movie anyway.  It's that good.

I'm not buying it.  Hold out for the Director's Cut, which is a more complete film and more deserving of the Blu-Ray treatment, especially in light of Nicholas Meyer's new book about the making of the film.

The original series Star Trek films were an interesting study in what fans wanted versus what the directors wanted to produce.  Some were banal, some were exciting, and some were cursed.  Wrath of Khan is seen as one of the more exciting space adventures of Kirk and crew.

As in the first film, ""The Motion Picture"", the script is based on an earlier episode of the original Trek, except ""Wrath"" could be called a sequel of sorts.

The new USS Enterprise is going through its shake-down and Kirk, looking like he is destined for a desk job, takes a visit to ""his"" Enterprise.  Meantime, the Reliant is doing some exploring in the same area of space where Khan was exiled by Kirk many years ago (back in the Sixties don'tcha know).  Khan, expertly played in a reprisal role by Ricardo Montalban (Fantasy Island, etc)., still wants his revenge.  When the Reliant beam down a shore party, Khan recognizes Chekov and proceeds to take over the Reliant as a tool to find and kill Kirk.

It's an interesting scene where Chekov is recognized by Khan, when Chekov was not in the earlier Sixties episode.  Oops.

Not only do we have the cat & mouse game between Kirk and Khan, but another part of the plot gets into Kirk's lost love, a love child of sorts and a secret weapon that Khan wishes to unleash upon the universe.  This is important, as it then spawns three more Trek films!

Kirstie Alley (Cheers) is competently playing a Vulcan in this one, and is somewhat coy, but I was hoping for some kinda love mix-up with Kirk.  Oh well, can't have everything.  This film was her film debut.  A lot slimmer here, too.

245760,5,6300213803,"If Star Trek: The Motion Picture was the Star Trek film based more on the original TV series philosophical side, then the second would, perhaps, be considered the Star Trek film more in line with the action oriented side of the series. Yet while seeming to be action based, Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan would also have some of the series most dramatic moments as well. The result of this, in the hands of director Nicholas Meyer would be the best of the Star Trek films.

To begin with the acting is pretty solid. The performances from the original series cast members are all well done especially int he cases of William Shatner, Loenard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly. In particular Shatner and Nimor get some fantastic scenes together including one of the best staged and moving farewell death scenes in film history (even if it is only temporary). Also of special mention is the performance of James Doohan whose performance gets some additional (and excellent) material in the director's edition DVD version. Plus there are also good performances from other cast members including Kirstie Alley in her film debut and Bibi Besch amongst others. Then there is the villain...

Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan, in my opinion anyway, is one of the all time great film villain performances. While Montalban had made quite an impact with the character int he original 1967 TV episode that performance was just the tip of what this film would reveal to the character. It's a layered performance with echoes, both in writing and in performance, to characters like King Lear and Capatin Ahab as Khan is revealed to be more then a genetically engineered superman in exile but a man driven to vengeance at any cost (hence the title). Khan's face-off's with Kirk are pieces of acting that focus your attention onto him which is even more incredible considering that the two characters (and presumably the actors as well) never come face to face int he film but spend the entire film facing off against each other via screens and communicators. It speaks to the power of a performance when despite that fact, the villain comes across as a real and imposing threat to the film's other characters.

The film's special effects also remain top notch. This film remains a prime example of the power of pre-CGI visual effects not only with ships in flight but with the still visually striking battle sequences and things like the Mutara Nebula sequence and the formation of the Genesis Planet. The film also makes nice reuses of some of the effects footage from the first Star Trek film as well which, for once in a case of footage reuse, doesn't make the film look cheap at all. All in all it's rather impressive material coming out of a film that is fast approaching its third decade of existence.

If the success of this film can really be credited to any single person it would be Nicholas Meyer. Despite Jack B. Sowards and executive producer Harve Bennett being credited as the writers of Star Trek II it was Meyer who did the (uncredited) massive re-write that brought together the film as it is. Whiel the script is firm in placing the film into being a science fiction action film, the film also a philosophical side as well. yet unlike its predecessor, the second Star Trek film is philosophical not about what's out there but about the human condition as it covers (without hopefully sounding clich) the full range of the human condition including the emotional need for revenge, youth, knowledge vs experience, aging, morality, regrets and, most famously, death. Perhpaos the greatest example of this is the films use of the opening and closing liens from Dickens A Tale Of Two Cities as effective bookends to the film. Meyer also makes use of the film's rather limited budget to effectively create a vision of life in the 23rd century and the result is that this film, perhaps more then any other of the Star Trek film, seems to occupy a real world thanks to Meyer's direction of people ranging from cinematographer Gayne Rescher to costume designer Robert Fletcher and the set designs of Joseph R. Jennings. Meyer proves that it is story, not just good effects, that makes good science fiction work.

There is also the film's score. Then newcomer James Horner faced quite a challenge in trying to create a score that followed on from Jerry Goldsmith's masterpiece for Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Yet Horner proved up to the task with pieces such as his main title music, the theme of the Enterprising leaving space dock (which reused the same footage that Goldsmith had scored to in Star Trek: The Motion Picture), the battle in the Mutara Nebula and the film's emotional finale. Whiel ti may lack the sound of the size of orchestra that Goldsmtih had Horner's score still has the power to add great emotion and tension to any scene it accompany. Indoing so, Horner kicked off a career that continues to this very day.

Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan is the best of the Star Trek films. Why you may ask? Well with fine performances, a great villain, impressive special effects, a nice script, the direction of Nicholas Meyer and a score by James Horner it what every Trek film has had to live up to. It is a film that is as much about the human condition as it is about action and is all the better for it. That's why it is.",1249862400,2,5332,4.697326203208556
245761,5,6300213803,"I've watched this so many times that I think I've memorized it.  And why not?  It's always entertaining.  You can't beat Montalban hissing and threatening as the insanely vengeful Khan, Shatner in a controlled performance as the aging Kirk who finds out about a relative he didn't know he had and also loses someone close to him, Bibi Besch as the lovely and sensitive Carol Marcus, Nimoy and Kelley maintaining the right balance for Shatner, Nimoy giving a very moving performance towards the end, and Koenig and Winfield suffering very palpably under the influence of those nasty little Ceti eels!

The director's cut mainly provides some extended footage and a few more lines of dialogue here and there.  Of course, it's also a better resolution than before.  I did not watch the extra features but they sound good.

245762,5,6300213803,"The Wrath of Khan has the reputation of being not just the best Star Trek movie, but also one of the best SF movies of its age. Unfortunately, in recent years it has perhaps become better known for the numerous parodies of a certain seminal William Shatner moment roughly halfway through the film, although in-context it works a lot better.

There are several factors which combine to make The Wrath of Khan such a good movie. First off, it has an extremely well-drawn villain played by a good actor. Khan having previously appeared in the classic Star Trek series (in the first season episode Space Seed) gave him a decent backstory and rationale for wanting vengeance against Kirk without getting bogged down in continuity. It was many years after I first saw the movie as a kid before I saw the episode, and really all you need to know is that Kirk dumped Khan on a planet as a gesture of supposed mercy which ended up killing Khan's wife and several of his shipmates. RicardoMontalban plays Khan with a certain theatrical malevolence which treads a razor's edge between high camp and genuine evil. He also gets some ripe lines which he manages to dignify through totally believing in them. Seriously, who else could pull off, ""Revenge is a dish best served cold, and it is very cold...in space""?

The second factor is that the script plays to the strengths of the individual actors and gives most of the Enterprise crew their own stories to follow (although Nichelle Nichols' Uhura and George Takei's Sulu are not as well-served as others) . Chekov, notably under-used in the actual series, turns up as the first officer of the Reliant who is captured by Khan early on and eventually ends up back on the Enterprise. There is a tragic subplot for Scotty, who gets his nephew a job as a trainee in the Enterprise's engineering department, whilst McCoy spends most of the movie trying to pull Kirk out of his brooding depression at turning 49. There's also the new character ofSaavik, Spock's protege who is angling for her own command. Effectively played by Kirstie Alley, Saavik serves as a viewpoint character for those viewers unfamiliar with the series. Oddly, a line referencing the fact that Saavik is actually half-Romulan , half-Vulcan was cut from the movie, whilst a later joke by McCoy referring to this fact is left in, somewhat confusingly. Spock only seems to have a minor subplot at the start referring to Kirk's guilt when he takes command of the ship from him, only to disappear in the middle third of the movie whilst Kirk,Saavik and McCoy travel to Regula. Of course, this was only to set up the unexpected ending.

The movie was also made on a crushingly small budget less than one-quarter of that assigned to its forebear, The Motion Picture. The crew had to work with their backs to the wall with only a limited number of sets, miniatures and effects shot available. Some shots from the preceding movie were re-used, whilst two-thirds of the movie took place on the same set, the Enterprise bridge which was redressed to serve as as the bridge of the Reliant. This saved enough money so that the final, iconic battle sequence - the Enterprise and Reliant playing cat-and-mouse in the Mutara Nebula - could be rendered as impressively as possible. The battle scenes in the movie are superb, with the ships acting less likeoversized fighters (a common complaint levelled against later movies and episodes) and more like the lumbering battleships they're supposed to be, dishing out and taking enormous amounts of punishment. The battle is also tremendously visceral, with decks collapsing and crewmen getting crushed, burned or subjected to lethal radiation in a manner that hadn't been seen previously on Trek (and led to the movie getting a hitherto unthinkable '15' certificate in the UK). Additionally, there's a small piece of history in the movie in the Genesis Device training movie, which is the first-ever 100% computer-generated sequence in the history of film.

Particularly worthy of mention is James Horner's score, which re-uses a few elements from his earlier movies (particularly Battle for the Planets) but mostly consists of new material. His new overture, used for flybys of the Enterprise and the main title theme, is instantly classic.

Of course, what really got people talking when the movie was released was the jaw-dropping ending, which in the pre-Internet age had successfully been kept secret in a manner unlikely to be replicated today. It's still an emotionally powerful moment played by the actors in a convincing and almost poetic manner (the oft-mockedShatner is on top form throughout this movie and its sequel). In fact, despite the sometimes hokey dialogue as related above, the movie has a number of iconic lines and quotes (mostly from A Tale of Two Cities and Moby Dick) which help give the movie a thematically satisfying through-line. This is a movie about not just revenge, but age, finding your right place in the world and the fact that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few (or indeed, the one). There's also satisfying attention paid to not copping out on the story. The writers couldn't conceive of a way that Khan and Kirk could meet without Kirk being killed, so they simply don't meet. And whilst victory is eventually won, it is only at a hard cost.

Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (*****) is a great film because it doesn't go overboard on the gimmicks or macguffins (the Genesis Device - which doesn't really do much - aside) and simply has two enemies on two equally-matched ships slugging it out and one winning through the use of his wits. With strong thematic underpinnings, endlessly quotable dialogue, a score to die for, great effects and some solid acting, the movie overcomes a few cheesy lines, a couple of continuity gaffes and some 80s hairstyles to retain its place as not just the best Star Trek movie, but an entertaining and breathlessly exciting SF movie in its own right.",1244332800,4,5979,4.839687194525904
245763,5,6300213803,Great movie.  Awesome battle scenes and strategy.  Surely one of the greatest films of all time.,1244073600,,96,4.9375
245764,5,6300213803,"So I originally posted this review with 3 stars, going into great detail and complaining about how incompetent a villain Khan was.  And then it took some time and thinking to realize the film isn't about Khan---it's about revelation and realization, that terrible sensation that is a common trope in any adventure series featuring close friends: the moment where one realizes that they are not invincible.

Admiral Kirk has gone through the vast majority of his career smoothly, a stalwart hero as likely to resolve a conflict with words as with fists, and always able to rely on his trusty friends.

And he's bored.  He's old, he's bored, and he can't stand it.

His career-long invincibility was actually a crutch to him, as he had glided through for so long, always having an escape plan or a secret option to escape from defeat.  The Kobayashi Maru ""no-win scenario"" running plot-MacGuffin is in no way a Red Herring---it comes back around and smashes Kirk in the face when he realizes his refusal to accept a no-win scenario worked for him in the past, but it will never truly work out in the end.

Spock dies.  That's not a spoiler; it's a forgone conclusion.  Spock's death isn't just a tacked-on ""SHOCKING SWERVE~!"" thing I had originally called it in my review.  Spock's death was in no way something to justify Khan being considered such a fiendish villain.

Spock's death was that moment, that revelation.  It was the moment Kirk realized there IS no cunning solution to the Kobayashi Maru.  It was the moment Kirk realized he is NOT invincible.  Indeed, Khan (at least until movie three) did exactly what he wanted to do to Kirk---he hurt him.  And he made sure Kirk would go on hurting, for a long while.

Kirk himself states at the end that he ""feels young"".  In fact, he does.  Having lost his best and closest friend, he is suddenly shown that he is not immortal, and he cannot loll through missions and commands expecting everything to work out in the end because it's ""Star Trek"".  He has cheated death all his life through all his missions, and death finally strikes him, not where it could do the most damage, but where it could HURT him most significantly.

Khan is still a lackluster villain to me.  Ricardo Montalban is magic with his acting talent, and brings an epic, operatic quality to Khan Noonien Singh.  But that's about it.  There's a huge multitude of parallels with Khan, the character and the movie, involving ""Moby Dick"" and ""Hamlet"" and ""King Lear"", and spectacularly executed with Khan's mirroring of Captain Ahab, blindly chasing his quarry, to the death and destruction of himself.

Above all, it's worth mentioning this is NOT an action movie.  It's an insult to this movie and it's dramatic, operatic quality to call it as such, especially when comparing it to ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"".  It's a common barb of fans of The Motion Picture to claim people like Wrath of Khan more because it's more action-packed.

No, it's not.  People like Wrath of Khan more because of the STORY and the depth and skill by which it is told, with deep themes on weighty issues such as death, aging, rebirth, and revenge, that resonate through all time, and are handled in a highly complex manner which most people would completely miss from their first viewing of the film, likely due to the stigma of ""geekiness"" and ""goofy garbage"" that Star Trek has.

""The Motion Picture"" was an adaptation of a failed TV series pilot featuring the original crew.  It involved a 30 minute story dragged out to nearly 2 hours, with blatant padding all around, from a FOUR MINUTE UNCUT sequence of just Kirk and Scott looking at the Enterprise while SLOWLY flying around it in a transport pod, to EVEN MORE SEQUENCES EVEN LONGER of the crew just staring into V'Ger's cloud, and arbitrarily cutting back to people's faces as they stare out the window.  ""2001"" Star Gate sequence this ain't.

The Motion Picture was full of long periods of nothing, and a very powerful theme of obsession---that of Kirk with command of the Enterprise---that was childishly ""resolved"" not by any character development or revelation, but by having the one person opposing his command (Decker) conveniently exit the picture without really dying, but more or less dying.

Wrath of Khan does not avoid any weighty issues or themes.  There is no quickfix solution to anything.  Kirk can't just have Khan's ship explode, then shield the Enterprise in some kind of Nebular vacuum spot where he can survive the Genesis explosion.  Kirk can't just blast Khan out of the sky and fly home victorious.

In some way, Kirk has earned redemption in this film for all the swaggering and slickness of his days of youth in The Original Series.  He is hurting, and he will go on hurting...

245808,5,6300213803,"Strange to think of it now. But when Star Trek II was originally released it was a huge shock to fans. Although a minor spoiler now, the death of Spock was as much of a blow as Darth Vader being Luke's father. And that was what makes the movie all the more compelling. Although it retains the feeling of the original series, it made very bold and risky choices in story telling.

The plot is pretty straight forward. During a training mission overseen by now Admiral James T Kirk, the crew of the Enterprise are confronted with an enemy from the past. Kahn, played with exceptional brevado by Ricardo Mantalban, is seeking revenge against Kirk for being deserted on a doomed planet. When a Federation science team mistakes Kahn's planet for a potential sight for an experiment, Kahn over takes the ship and hijacks the project in an attempt to lure Kirk into a trap.

What makes the film so good is how it both embraces and departs from the series roots. The chemistry between the core group of actors is better then ever, leaving the slightly stale feeling of Star Trek The Motion picture behind. But series fans are thrown for a loop by how things don't run as smoothly for the Enterprise crew. People are injured and killed throughout the film, throughing Kirk out of his usual comfort zone. In one scene Kirk watches as a young trainee dies in the wake of Kirks own negligence. The point is, things go very wrong and no amount of techno wizardry can fix it. It all culminates in a climax that demands the ultimate sacrifice to save the day.

245809,5,6300213803,"One thing that many serials use to great effect, but is surprisingly missing in the original series of Star Trek, is the recurring villain. They had a sense of that with the recurring Klingons and Romulans, but we never got to see the same people playing the roles in more than one episode. The only antagonist that ever recurred throughout the entire three year run was Harcourt Fenton ""Harry"" Mudd, and he was a bit of a joke at best.

However, as much as you may want to laugh at the idea of Mudd as a ""villain"", the recurring role allowed the character to become more real. Thus his problems and motivations were more real to us.

On the heals of the commercial success of the critically decried ""Star Trek: The Almost-No-Motion Picture"", director Nicholas Meyer was determined to prove that Star Trek could be a successful and well reviewed movie franchise. Herein came the great idea: use a villain that the audience already knows.

Like all original series villains, Khan Noonian Singh was in only one episode. Yet brilliant writing and Montalban's portrayal of the genetically engineered superhuman created one of the greatest episodes of the entire series. By bringing him in to the story, they not only firmly establish that these movies are the continuing voyages of the crew that started out in the sixties, but the audience could now see the results of one of their most favorite episodes ever. Rarely do we get the rest of the story. Here we see it in larger-than-life effects and played out superbly by the inimitable Ricardo Montalban.

His hatred of Kirk was believable before he ever mentioned the (then) Admiral's name. There was a terrifying restraint to his deliberate actions, but his eyes always told us that there was much more power and emotion than we were being allowed to see. Shatner gave a wonderful performance in this showdown with a foe he thought to have left behind, but it was Montalban who truly shone through.

In the beginning, Captain Spock and his cadets, were in a bridge simulator in preparation for a training cruise on the Enterprise. Admiral James Kirk would be evaluating crew performance during the cruise. The movie seen the introduction of a new character, Lieutenant Saavik. Kirstie Alley did good job in portraying the character. Robin Curtis would do a better job during Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and during her brief appearance in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. In original storyline, Saavik was to be half Vulcan, half Romulan. When her character was introduced in the movie, Saavik was a full Vulcan.
The main part of the story takes place in the Ceti Alpha star system. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, is a continuation of the Star Trek episode ""The Space Seed"" The late Ricardo Montalban, reprised his role as Khan in the movie and turned in an outstanding performance. In this part of the movie, the Reliant is on orbital approach to what they believe to be Ceti Alpha 6. Reliant was part of the Genesis Project. In this part of the movie, we were introduced to Kirk's past. The affair he had with Dr. Carol Marcus and the birth of their son David. By mutual agreement, Kirk agreed to stay away. David grows up to be scientist and a research partner with his mother. While growing up, David was never informed, Captain James T. Kirk, was his father. After landing, Chekov and Terrell,are captured by Khan and his people. This is when Chekov and Terrell find out,they're on Ceti Alpha 5. In the series, Khan and his people, were sent into exile on Ceti Alpha 5, rather than face charges of hijacking the Enterprise. Six months into their exile, the orbit of Ceti Alpha 5 was shifted when Ceti Alpha 6 exploded. Over the course of time, Khan was hoping to seek revenge on Kirk and the Enterprise. With the arrival of the Reliant, gives Khan the opportunity he was hoping for. While waiting for Reliant to be transporter range, Khan learns about the Genesis Project. Kirk is alerted of possible trouble, when Dr. Marcus attempts to contact him on the Enterprise, requesting verification of an order of Starfleet taking procession of Genesis, only to find out, their communications were being jammed. With the Enterprise, the only ship in the area, they're ordered to active duty. Kirk's concern, is for the training crew on the Enterprise. They were being placed in a threat situation before they were ready.

The rest of the movie, was a fight for survival. Khan ambushes the Enterprise and disables her. The ace up Kirk's sleeve, was the Prefix Code. After making whatever repairs they could, Kirk's concern was for Dr. Marcus and the Genesis Project. Upon arrival at the Regula I station, Kirk finds the aftermath of Khan's anger. After finding Chekov and Terrell, Kirk makes a coded message to the Enterprise. Upon transporting inside the Regula 1 planetoid, Kirk finds Dr. Marcus, his son and the Genesis Device, only to find out, they walked into a trap. After taking Genesis, Khan was under the impression, Kirk was going to be marooned inside a dead planet. Khan was unaware of the coded message. The Enterprise was in hiding and was able to restore partial main power. Two hours later, Kirk and his party, were transported to the Enterprise.
This is where the fight for survival, get intense. Kirk knows the only way to even the fight, is to play hide & seek inside the Mutara Nebula. During their battles, both the Enterprise and the Reliant were heavily damaged. In his last attempt to destroy the Enterprise, Khan activates the Genesis device. What Khan was not aware of, Dr. David Marcus was on the bridge of the Enterprise and seen the sensor display from Spock's science console. With Warp drive unavailable, the Enterprise tried to get away from the Reliant at best possible speed before the Genesis Device detonates. Knowing they are facing certain destruction, Spock makes the ultimate sacrifice when he makes repairs to the Warp Drive. With seconds to spare,the Enterprise escapes destruction. After knowing his wife and son are safe, Kirk has to endure the ultimate pain of losing his best friend.
The funeral ceremony was a fitting close. The special touch is when Scotty was playing Amazing Grace on the bag pipes. Their window of opportunity for the next movie, is when Spock's burial tube passed through what remains of the Genesis Wave Radiation. During some quiet time in his quarters to grief over Spock's death, David acknowledges that Admiral James T. Kirk, is his father and very proud of him.

Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan, is the best of the action based movies of the Star Trek movie series involving the original crew. This was the first Star Trek movie to use George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic to provide the special effects for the movie. Ricardo Montalban was outstanding in reprising his role as Khan. He was being considered for the Academy Award. However, he did not make the final cut. In the Special Collector's Edition, the edited scenes were restored to this version, including the introduction of Scotty's nephew, Peter Preston and the scenes in Sick Bay where Scotty loses his nephew and scene between Kirk and McCoy asking the question, ""How did Khan find out about Genesis?"" The restored scenes, added to the storyline.
Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan - The Director's Cut, would be an excellent edition to anyones DVD collection. The movie is a continuation of an episode that appeared during the original series!",1232409600,,5746,4.814777327935222
245812,5,6300213803,"First off, im not a hard, hard core Trekkie, but As a lifelong fan of Star Trek, ive seen almost all the series' in the mythology (except Deep Space Nine), and ive seen most of the films, and i have to say....ill always love the original, hands down. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, all the original crew members, to me, nothing ever beats the feeling of adventure and heroism one experiences when one watches the original crew in action...i know some fans debate whos a better captain, or which series was better or worse, to me, the original started it all, and when it comes to comfortability, thats what ill take. The second film in the big screen series, ""The Wrath of Khan"", demonstrates the best of what the legend of Trek is about....people. Sure, don't get me wrong, i love the spaceships, the epic battles, the alien races the crew encounter...but most of all, at its best, Star Trek is about people, and emotions, and the sense of human unity. This is what Gene Roddenbury strived for when he first thought of the idea of the saga. Essentially, its a continuation of the 1967 original series episode ""Space Seed"", in which Kirk and crew meet Khan, a genetically engineered superhuman/conqueror from Earth's past. In the film,which takes place 15 yrs later, Khan is seeking vengeance against Kirk for sending him and his followers into exile following an attempted coup against the Enterprise crew. This film was and is always one of my personal favorites due to the fact it touched on human frailty, humanity, the lust for vengeance and the sin of such lust, and most of all, the value of all against the need of just one or a few ( a bit of paraphrasing of an old Spock saying...youll know it when you hear it). The dvd itself contains lots of great features: extended director commentary, a look at the visual effects used in the film, interviews with cast and crew, etc, etc....overall, an amazing piece of pop entertainment that doesnt insult its fans, but embraces them and their love for that entertainment.",1229990400,,2012,4.686440677966102

*Excellent action and some gorgeous special effects (including a very early example of CGI effects).
*Filming style is great and very original.
*Production design is a vast improvement over the first ""Star Trek"" film.
*Sound design is splendid too.
*The storyline is great.  It takes after the episode ""Space Seed"" in the original series, but it's not entirely necessary to watch it in order to understand the movie.
*The characters are awesome.  Kahn (Ricardo Montalban) is one of the best bad guys ever, and his performance is so dramatic.  Kirk is very compassionate.  Everybody else is good; great acting.
*Good writing.  Lots of memorable lines.
*Strong themes about life and death, birth and rebirth, and growing old.
*Good music.

The Bad Things
*A few bloody bits (mostly involving alien bugs that burrow into people's ears); probably not for young kids or the extremely squeamish.

Definately the best of the ""Star Trek"" film saga.  It does away with the dull space-opera elements of the first film and provides a smashing extravaganza of space battles, epic story-telling, and intense character conflicts.  The writing is totally awesome, and presents loads of great lines and dramatic acting.  It's a classic in every sense.

245816,5,6300213803,"Take a classic television series with a dedicated fanbase, insert one of its most popular villains and toss a major motion picture budget at it and what do you get:  ""Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan.""

Perhaps the closest film in the ""Star Trek"" catalogue to the original televison series, ""Khan"" finds Kirk as the admiral in charge of assessing a green crew on routine training maneuvers.  They happen to be aboard his old ship, the Enterprise, and the crew includes most of his key past crewmates.  In another part of the galaxy, former crewman Chekov and his new captain are investigating a planet that may be used for Project Genesis, a device that could literally give new life to a planet.  What Chekov and his captain actually find is a man hungry for revenge:  Khan.

Having been exiled years ago and blaming Kirk for the death of his wife, Khan puts a plan into action to bring Kirk back into his clutches in order to get revenge.

Falling for Khan's trickery and with an inexperienced crew in tow, Kirk takes the Enterprise to Regula One, home of Project Genesis.  He hopes to find out who used his name in order to get their hands on Genesis.  Instead, he finds an ex-wife, an estranged son and one of his greatest enemies waiting to strike.  What happens next is, simply put, a wonderful blend of drama, suspense and humor as Kirk and Khan battle each other to the death.

For a film released in 1982, ""Khan"" has excellent special effects.  Granted, there are a few miscues, but the story more than makes up for them.  Director Nicholas Meyer paces the film with perfection, utilizing the musical score and the individual performances of the players in order to build tension on the screen.  He guides the games between Kirk and Khan with precision.  All of the original crew do superb jobs, but I must point out that William Shatner gives his best performance ever.  Ricardo Montalban's over-the-top performance as Khan makes this film worthy of five stars.  Kirstie Alley makes her first big screen appearance and adds quite a bit of sex appeal to the film as Lt. Saavik.  That's a tough job for a person playing an emotionless Vulcan to do.

As for the DVD, this two disc set makes up in quality what it lacks in quantity.  The digital transfer of the film is excellent.  It's one of the best transfers of a film including the original cast.  Only ""Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country"" has a crisper looking transfer.  The sound is also very good.  There aren't as many special features included with this set when compared to the other films in this series, but they are some of the best extras you'll find.  Highlights include original interviews with DeForest Kelley, Leonard Nimoy, Shatner and Montalban as well as new interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, Meyer and executive producer Harve Bennett.  There's also an interesting segment involving ""Star Trek"" authors Julia Ecklar and Greg Cox.

Fans of ""Star Trek"" have most likely viewed this film already.  For those folks who haven't or for people who aren't fans of science fiction, I highly recommend ""Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan"" for its drama, wonderful suspense and overall story.  For fans of military films, the calculated tactics of both Kirk and Khan should keep them interested.  These are just a few of the reasons that have made this film one of the most popular of the ""Star Trek"" pictures.",1216425600,,3391,4.691525423728813

245867,5,6300213803,"I'm not a Trekkie or a Trekker.

My interest in things Star Trek is take it or leave it.  There's been tons of schlock in the original series, the spin-offs, and the movies.

Wrath of Khan is the best of the Star trek movies because like the best of the series, it focuses on the relationships between the principals.

The script is really quite moving, dealing with Kirk's aging, encountering a son he hasn't had any relationship with, and that son's mother.  And we have Spock's death, one of the best death scenes in cinema.

We're supplied with a credible bad guy, Ricardo Montalban, chewing scenery, quoting Milton (all the while in an unfortunate mullet, I'm afraid).

And we have Kirsty Alley, stealing scenes in a very early role, as Spock's Vulcan protege.

Everyone is chasing after an interesting mcguffin, the Genesis device, which brings dead planets to life.

The backstory was that after the bloated mess of the first Star Trek movie, with its cost overruns and generally middling reviews, this was planned as a TV movie, possibly as a relaunch of the TV series.

By the time they were in post-production, they wisely realized that the movie would probably do okay in theatres.  So this movie was made on a TV-movie budget (the tiniest of any Trek film by far), and made tons of bucks.

The special effects are mostly okay; penny-elegant and effective but not over the top.  The nebula is very pretty; later Trek series would reuse the shots endlessly.

It's all about a clan of genetically superior super-humans, led by a man with a Bonepartist attitude, (Kahn), who were once placed on a planet by Captain Kirk, to resolve the takeover of the Starship Enterprise by that group. There, they were expected to survive and create a new civilization.

However, no one checked on their progress and things didn't go precisely as planned!

The second plot is that a former lover of Captain Kirk's, (Kirk's illegitimate son is introduced to us!), a brilliant scientist, who has invented a device for ""creating life"" on barren planets, ""The Genesis Project"". The problem is, this device can also be used for planentary destruction because it obliterates any existing life where it is utilized.

Kahn seizes upon a chance to escape the torment of his now barren world and seeks to steal the Genesis device and to get even with Kirk in the process. I'll have to stop there to avoid any major spoilers but, for fans of the original series, there is one heckuva MAJOR INCIDENT near the end.

-- Kirk's bantering with Peter Preston in the engineering room.
-- McCoy's dialog with Kirk after Preston dies.
-- The human ego comment by Spock.

245872,5,6300213803,"Star Trek: The Motion Picture was the first time Star Trek hit the big screen.  The movie was a visual feast (for its time) and was a success at the box office.  But when it came down to it, it lacked a certain punch and was labeled as ""just boring and too long"".  Plans continued for a sequal, and director Nicholas Meyer was brought on board for Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan.  He was one of the many who agreed that The Motion Picture was lacking and was boring.  He had a new vision, and created a very different Star Trek movie.  The Wrath of Khan worked off a much smaller budget, but in return, gambled the Trek franchise with a very dark approach and cetainly a strong punch.

One of the great things about The Wrath of Khan is that its a story that continues from an early TOS episode titled ""Space Seed"", where a gentically engineered superhuman from the 1990's named Khan failed in attempt to capture the Enterprise.  He and his men were sent to a planet known as Ceti Alpha V to begin their own desired life.  In the Wrath of Khan, we learn that the planet has nearly been destroyed, and Khan's people barely survived.  Khan blames Captin Kirk for not checking on their progress, and has a heart filled with hatred and revenge for the good Captain.  Certainly, seeing Space Seed will allow this move to make more sense, but honestly I saw this first as a kid and I still loved it.

Khan is the main villain and the center of the plot, but there are various subplots in the film that keep the interest at high levels throughout the story.  There is a device known as Genesis that can practically create life onto dead planets.  A controversial matter is the least to worry about, since Khan is interested in obtaining this device - in addition to obtaining the life of Captain Kirk.  There is another subplot of the character development of Kirk.  He is an admiral, and is uncomfortable with the position.  It makes him feel old and worn out.  Kirk is looking for something to give him refeshment again.  Then there's Spock, who claims the good of the many outweighs the good of the one, and folows up on that with action in the film's conclusion that is shocking and moving.

Wrath of Khan is different than the Motion Picture in every way possible.  Overall, the film has a dark tone, and that is justified with lighting and camera work.  Even the uniforms and bridge have obtained a more refined look.  There is actually some violence this time, and a creepy scene with critters known as Ceti-Eels driving themselves into human ears.  The Enterprise gets blasted like never before in spectacular space battles throughout the film against the USS Reliant (which Khan and crew have taken over).

Just when the franchise was in trouble, a risk was taken with the production of this film, and it was a tremendous success.  Obviously, since another 8 movies have folled (and another one in production today) and another 4 television series.  Wrath of Khan shows a darker side of Trek, yet still keeping the classic feel there in the mix.  And in the end, Khan is arguably one of the finest Star Trek villains ever to hit the screen, with a must see performance by the extremely underrated Ricardo Montalban.

This director's cut includes deleted/extended/redone scenes that were not included in the original.  Trek fans will want to makes sure they own a copy of this for the distinct differences.

It does help if you know where the hate began between Kirk and Khan, but it isn't really necessary, all you need to know is that there is some serious bad blood between these two, plus Khan explains it all in a perfectly done scene where he finds Chekov on his ship (or whats left of it) FYI, Chekov wasn't on the Enterprise when Khan made his original appearance on Star Trek way back when, but let's not get into that.
To see the Enterprise finally take a beating was spectacular, so far this ship had taken many lickings but never looked any worse, this time it gets it's butt whooped. The conflict between Khan's intelligence and Kirk's instincts and experience as a starship captain is what makes this movie so interesting.

The run time is slightly longer, due to a few seconds of extra footage inserted, and for some of the scenes, different takes are used. Some of it will be familiar to fans as extra or alternate footage seen on ABC-TV broadcasts of the film; some of it should be new.

245908,5,6300213803,"After a sluggish, bloated first ""Star Trek"" movie, director Meyer steers the franchise back to more familiar and exciting territory with this entry. The gang's all here, and Shatner's particularly good as a more seasoned, philosophical Kirk. Montalban seems to enjoy playing the venomous Khan as much as we do watching him. Hit warp speed, and catch this lively, family-friendly science fiction adventure.",1183939200,,405,5.444444444444445
245909,5,6300213803,"Right from a beginning that is as tense and shocking as ever there was in sci fi, to an ending that keeps you guessing while both pleasing and dismaying loyal Star Trek Fans, this movie was and IS an accomplishment to be celebrated.

Star Trek the Motion Picture (movie one) was a less than pleasing transition from the small screen to the big screen. Wrath of Khan is not just a STEP up, it is a LEAP up.... it is LEAPS AND BOUNDS above its predecessor and dare I say the movies that followed.

None of the series of movies had this level of conflict, tension and emotion. None had this amount of action and NONE... NOT ONE of them... had Ricardo Montalban!",1183680000,,658,4.341463414634147
245910,4,6300213803,"After being dissapointed with the first Star Trek motion picture, I was greatly surprised with Star Trek II. The original crew appear to be back in pretty much top form. I felt they were a bit rusty in the first film as far as acting together as a group. There are also some key new characters added that bring a whole lot to the film as well. The overall plot is much better than that of the first film too. It was brilliant to bring back a character from an episode of the orginal series, Khan, and really make it work. If you're just a casual fan of the Star Trek series and haven't watched many of the original episodes, you might want to get your hands on the ""Space Seed"" episode. You, by no means, NEED to watch this episode before viewing this film to understand it, but it might make you aprreciate it a little more in the long run. But if you're a fan to begin with, its basically like watching one of your favorite Star Trek episodes, except on a greater scale. In my opinion, if you're looking for the definitive Star Trek movie, this is it.",1179964800,,1053,4.243781094527363
245911,5,6300213803,"This one was the first Star Trek movie that I ever watched in 1986 when I was 7 years old... I REMEBER I LOVED IT, even more than Star Wars, the Enterprise it looks so cool, the uniforms, the story, the action, the special effects, but overall I never forget that I felt that those people are really friends, and I felt so sad when, well u know, after the sacrifice of one of the crew members

In fact, I bought 2 copies of this movie, this one it is my favorite movie ever, and the special edition is plenty of really nice stuff, so, If you want to buy one of the better sci fi movie ever, you MUST BUY this one Star Trek movie, I know you will like it!!!!",1177977600,,657,3.977272727272727
245912,5,6300213803,"Now 25 years old, this movie still holds up very well.  I remember how delighted we fans were when we heard that Star Trek was going to be made into a movie.  The first film was mixed for most fans.  We were glad to see the characters on the screen, but the feel of the film was too big and the story was off somehow.  This movie was the second film and everyone cheered because it was a Star Trek story through and through, with even some of the characteristic inconsistencies (Khan remembering Chekov when he wasn't even part of the crew in the TV episode), the just in time miracles, and much more.

Ricardo Montalban is spectacular as the genetically altered Khan Noonien Singh that Kirk had left on a lush planet fifteen years before.  Kirk is now an admiral who is uncomfortable with old age and leaving his starship, a new crew is being trained to take over the Enterprise, and Chekov is on an expedition on the Reliant with Captain Clark Terrell (well played by Paul Winfield).  Terrell and Chekov set down on a waste planet and discover evidence of Khan's existence on this planet and try to flee, but it is too late.

The rest of the film is Khan drawing Kirk into an obsessed confrontation much like Ahab and Moby Dick.  You can pretty much guess that it is just as unlikely to end well for Khan.  It is the path the confrontation takes that is so interesting for Trek fans.  And the famous denouement is either quite moving or an impossible hoot, depending on how seriously you take these stories.  I was moved by the way they played it.  It was the next movie that we all had to swallow hard to believe, but it got us back to where we needed the story to be.

Hey, at least they didn't make it a dream or something from an autistic child, right?

We watched this with my teenage son last night, and he enjoyed it a great deal, so new generations continue to become fans of this series.  As well they should.",1172361600,,1920,4.32122905027933
245913,5,6300213803,"I thought ""Star Trek:  The Movie"" was an extra-long, expensive TV episode.  ""The Wrath of Khan"" is actually a movie, starring the Star Trek characters.

Ricardo Montalban was even better here than in the original ST episode ""Space Seed"" (and he was good in the original).  He made an excellent villain here.

A couple of side comments.  When Khan was introducing the surviving creature of the planet, his voice made me think of Rourke on Fantasy Island.  The other comment is something I'm sure all Trekkies caught when seeing the movie:  Khan told Chekov he never forgot a face.  Yet Chekov did not show up until the second season, while ""Space Seed"" was from the first season.

Those who have read my other reviews may be aware of my division between true science fiction, science fantasy, and science horror.  The Star Trek franchise has dabbled in all three.  This story, though, falls into the true science fiction category.  The speculation is on science being able to create life.  Yes, this movie is more of an adventure than anything else, but the futuristic side is based on possibilities.

My wife thought it was too violent; this movie may have received a PG-13 rating if that rating existed.  But I found this to be an awesome movie.",1168732800,,1246,4.725581395348837
245914,5,6300213803,"Forget ""one of the best"", This is THE best Star Trek movie EVER.  While I like all of them because I am such a Star Trek fan, This is the one movie I could watch over and over.  The Director's cut is the one to own if you can't get enough and want all the extras.",1167696000,,263,3.6785714285714284
245915,4,6300213803,"I'm foremost a Star Wars fan, with the Star Trek universe being very foreign to me. But this movie (along with Search for Spock and Voyage Home, which form the trilogy) came highly recommended by a friend, so I gave them a spin. Plus its absolutely essential for any movie buff to see Shatner's now-legendary scream of ""Khaaannnn!!!""

I liked this one. Not being a Trek fan a few small details were lost on me, but overall the movie does well referencing the episode on which it was based without being slaved to it. The Genesis Project creates a lot of moral and ethical questions with its science, exactly the type of sci-fi that Trek is best known for. Good special effects, and good acting - it's telling that the conflict between Kirk and Khan feels real despite the fact they never meet in person. ""Khaaannnn!!!"" drew me in. The touching finale sold me. Good stuff.

Solid dvd, with lots of good information. Some of the bonus features come off a little dry, as they're nothing but ""talking head"" interviews for the most part. But again, they show you just how much more of the Trek universe was apparantly established with this film.

So I wouldn't count myself as a Trek fan yet, but Khan definitely made me excited to check out more Trek adventures. And that works for me.",1167436800,2,1281,4.560869565217391
245936,5,6300213803,"Nick Meyer did a great job at his first directorial debut for the Star Trek franchise. I liked the much more navy~ish feel and the more military style with clear cut ranks and the like. That is one reason I think that has attracted people to this movie. The effects used in the movie were good for the budget and ILM did good for what little money they were given (I think they were were also working on Jedi at the time as well, which has more budget for effects). Definetly get this for your collection.",1164758400,,505,4.270833333333333
245937,5,6300213803,This is a great Star Trek...If you know the original series then you will know that Kirk is going up against a enemy from the past...And the end of the movie is the lead in for Star Trek Three the Search for Spock.....You will love this if you are a Trekkie...,1163116800,,260,4.117647058823529
245938,5,6300213803,This is an awesome movie.  Much better than Start Trek 1.  Too bad they could not make it a 4 hour 2 part move with Recardo in both movies.  Good special effects showing damage against the hull without shields.,1163030400,,210,4.333333333333333
245939,5,6300213803,"C'mon! It's TREK plus the smooth Corinthian Leather of Khan. Top five best lines:

5. This is Centi Alpha Five's last... indigenous...species.

4. Of Course! We're One. Big. Happy Fleet!

3. Let them eat STATIC.

2. And I want to go on hurting you. I leave you as you left me... buried alive...

1. (all that MOBY DICK stuff aside) Yours is the SUPERIOR Intellect...(croak)",1162598400,2,373,4.676923076923077
245940,5,6300213803,"Movie viewers interested in watching an intelligent space adventure must take a chance with ""Khan."" (Do not worry about being labeled a 'Trekkie.' Those steriotypical, dateless recluses who, at age 36, live with their mothers don't exist anymore, like they did in the 80's; welfare reform got passed in the 90's.)

Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" is the ""Star Wars: Episode IV"" of the Star Trek saga. Like the original Star Wars movie, ""The Wrath of Khan"" was made with a very tight budget. But low budgets inspired director Nicholas Myers to make a superior space opera, like George Lucas did in 1977. Much like the first Star Wars movie, the characters in Star Trek II are well developed, and the special effects are superb!

After watching this special 2 Disc set, movie viewers can appreciate why Director Nicholas Myers should be knighted 'Father of Modern Star Trek.' His influence on this movie's dynamic spaceship battles, uniforms, and navy-style culture set a successful precedent for the proceeding movies (III, IV, V, VI, Generations, First Contact, Insurrection, Nemesis) and many TV shows (Next Generation, Deep Space 9, Voyager, Enterprise). With these DVDs movie goers will appreciate how Myers bailed out the franchise in the early 1980's, after it vomited out the unimaginative nightmare, ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture.""

The Wrath of Khan is not just a dramatic tale about two spaceships battling each other. It is about personable characters fighting an underdog war. Kirk, the cowboy hero, captains an Enterprise crew of young, inexperienced trainees against a genetically superior enemy, Khan. Not only are Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and Scotty caught off-guard, but their merciless enemy is armed with a doomsday weapon. This adventure is full of depth, epitomized by the heroic, ""logical"" sacrafice by a beloved, Star Trek character.

After adding ""Khan"" to your DVD collection, you can enjoy investing in these other quality Star Trek movies that are second and third in the Genesis Trilogy:

""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock""

""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home""

To watch an adventurous conclusion for the original cast, please get:

""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country."" (also directed by Nicholas Myers!)

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! For another great Star Trek trilogy in the 10 move saga, watch:

""Star Trek: First Contact"" (a.k.a. 'Picard and Data vs. the Borg')

""Star Trek: Insurrection"" (a.k.a 'Picard and Data vs. Aliens with Wrinkle Problems')

""Star Trek: Nemesis"" (a.k.a. 'Attack of the Picard and Data Clones')

  WORDS OF ENTERTAINMENT CAUTION!

1. Remember to never ruin your positive view of Star Trek movies by watching ""The Motion Picture.""

2. Don't bother with ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"" (a.k.a. 'The Search for God.') It is unimaginative, only slightly better than the first motion picture.

3. Don't bother with ""Star Trek Generations,"" either. It ranks as a made-for-TV movie

--Live long and Prosper!",1162339200,,2953,5.153039832285115
245941,5,6300213803,"Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan in Star Trek II is nothing short of marvelous. It really deals with Khan's reclusive nature after being stranded on Seti Alpha V by Capt. Kirk in ""Space Seed"", and leaves to door wide open to Khan's obsession growing to the point where his own men are concerned. Kirk conversely is dealing with the fact that he is not the young adventurer he used to be and I must say seems to capture some actual feeling of gloom as he considers retirement or taking back his command. Suspicious though is the opinion of Bones. You might remember in the first film, McCoy was very much against Kirk getting the ship back and now supports his friend on this mission. As for Kirk, the approach to old age in ""Khan"" definitely is the more genuine between the two films, which says a lot for the acting of William Shatner. The only true constant is of course Spock. Although never face to face, both Spock and McCoy agree Kirk should have remained a captain. You still get a lot of classic Trek moments such as a scene in Kirk's quarters where he has to referee a philosophical argument between his two old friends.

Star Trek II is also the beginning of casting top notch actors as villains, a trend that lasted until Nemesis. (the role of captain wasn't as diverse until passed to Patrick Stewart either.) Khan is definitely a classic film. Blending together humor, drama and very important sub-plots that carry through to this day. Wether you're a Trek fan or not, buy this one.",1162166400,,1502,4.58364312267658
245942,5,6300213803,"I can and have watched this movie time and time again since its theatrical release in 1982. I have seen it so many times, in fact, I practically can recite all the dialog along with the characters. The Director's Edition provides additional scenes for me to memorize. It is an excellent follow up to the Space Seed episode on the original TV series. The battle of wits between Admiral Kirk and Khan provides lots of 'final frontier' action. A young Kirstie Alley, in her first role, is very convincing as a Vulcan StarFleet officer under the tutelage of Captain Spock.  Although, I know the outcome, the climax saddens me each time I watch it. The final scene, however,  lets us know that all is well.  Highly recommended for any Star Trek fan or anyone who enjoys good sci-fi action.",1156809600,,784,4.625899280575539
245943,5,6300213803,"'The Wrath of Khan' is arguably the most famous out of all of the Star Trek movies to date. Ricardo Montalban returns once again to reprise his role as Khan, the villain from the original series episode ""Space Seed"". As expected, Montalban exceeds in this role that he has established as one of the greatest villains of the Trek universe. He looks different, a little buffer and more grey, but he is still the same evil character we have all come to hate.

This movie features a lot of interesting and very famous moments. This was also the first film appearance of Kirstie Alley. The story is very compelling and the characters/actors work so well together, you can feel their friendships and hatreds between each other. If you notice during the movie, they do give hints by things they say and do of how the movie will end. The script is well written and has me in tears every time, no matter how many times it is watched. This is a must have for lovers of Trek and sci-fi, you have to see this movie at least once in your life time. After that, you will want to see it again and again. It is just that good.",1156723200,,1110,4.336538461538462

  Stardate 8130.43: Spock (Leonard Nimoy) is now the Captain of the Enterprise.  James T. Kirk (William Shatner) is now Admiral and it is his birthday.  Kirk is beginning to feel his age at 51, but what he really wants to do is helm the Enterprise again.
  Having been transported down from the NCC 1804 Reliant, Captain Terrell (Paul Winfield) and Commander Chekov (Walter Koenig) scout around on what they think is Ceti Alpha 6. It is an especially windy barren desert.  They find a cargo ship and inspect it inside.  Chekov (Walter Koenig) begins to remember a few items when suddenly he recalls Botany Bay.  He quickly warns Captain Terrell that they must leave now.  They are captured by a crew.  The leader unveils his face protection.  It is Khan! Khan (Ricardo Montalban) recognizes Chekov and decides to hold both men hostage.  Khan explains that their were 70 of his crew on Ceti Alpha 5, but when Alpha 6 exploded, it sent Ceti Alpha 5 off course shifting its orbit and making it a desert waste, six months after Khan and his crew arrived on the class M planet in exile.  Kirk never bothered to check on Khan's progress.  Khan shows the men an overgrown eel that killed his wife and other crew members.  He puts an indigenous creature into Chekov and Terrell's ear. They wrap around inside to grow causing excruciating pain and madness.  Khan demands to know how to find James T. Kirk.  Khan wants revenge.
  Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch) who is creating a new planet surface called, Genesis, also has another surprise for her former boyfriend of 20 years ago...Kirk's son, David (Merritt Butrick).

Update: Star Trek 14. As of April 2018, Paramount has chosen female director S. J. Clarkson for the first time. In a time travel story, Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) will meet his father, George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth). No production date nor release date yet.

 The film afterwards:
 Paramount is looking at Quentin Tarantino's  story idea with screenwriter Mark L. Smith. He wants the movie to be Rated R. William Shatner, Patrick Stewart and John Cho have shown interest.
  Simon Pegg is also writing a sequel script of his own.",1154390400,,7210,6.45615866388309
245945,5,6300213803,"I just got around to seeing this movie again recently. NO, I have not always been a fan of Star Trek. I have watched many episodes of 'The Next Generation' and a few of the 'Original Series', but I didn't really and truly begin to appreciate them for what they were until I watched a July 4th marathon on television. At that point, I had to watch the movies again: because I was once more a fan.

Sequels rarely are better than the predecessor. But in this case, it was so. I did not like Star Trek: the Motion Picture very much... it was long and drawn out. But I knew I would like this one. I liked it a few years back, when I saw it on VHS. But now that I have seen it on DVD, I realized just how great this movie actually is.

You might remember the episode in the original series where the character of Khan is introduced after the crew of the Enterprise find his ship floating in space. Khan turns out to be a powerful and manipulative foe for Captain Kirk... and the resolution is that he gets banished to a wild planet that is scarcely inhabited by anything but strange creatures and thick forests. ""It is better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven.""

Well, Khan makes a come-back into the storyline. And this time, he proves that he is even more powerful of a foe than we first thought. He's much older and tired, but his determination for revenge against Kirk has never been stronger. The plot and action of this movie are strong, and there is never a dull moment(unlike the Motion Picture.)

If you really like the Star Trek franchise, then I definitely suggest this DVD for you. It has some bonus features and commentary that are worth checking into, and the visual quality is top-notch. And then, I suggest buying 'Search for Spock', which is very closely connected with this movie.

I give it five stars because that's what it deserves: It is perfect!",1154390400,,1866,4.36599423631124
245975,5,6300213803,"this is the one,the one that saved the series and made the other shows possible.

  after the boxoffice hit of the first one,they roled out this second,and much cheeper budgeted second one and hit gold!

  acting like the first one never happened,this one starts with cadets training to take over the ship and kirk is going on the training run with them. enter khan(ricardo montalban as the villian he played on the original show) a superman from the past that kirk beat and left on a far off world. it seems that starfleet has a new weapon,the genesis weapon,it turns dead planets into live ones,killing everything to make the world able to suport life. the planet khan is on is to be used as a test site.khan takes control of the ship sent for the test and goes after the bomb and kirk! the action comes fast and gets better as the movie goes on.

  the dvd is great and has all the extras you could want. a great set,beam it up!!!",1151020800,,933,4.377906976744186
245976,5,6300213803,"After the thoroughly unegaging original movie ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" succeeded at the box office, though it still blows my mind how it achieved so much money, people must have seen a different movie than me, I wasn't surprised that Paramount was keen for a sequel.  Even though I hated the first movie, I am thankful that it did well at the box office, because thanks to its success movie audiences were treated to the cinematic goodness that is ""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan"".  Fans of the original series were ecstatic to learn that the genetically engineered superhuman known as Khan, that last appeared in the original TV series during the episode ""Space Seed"", would be returning to cause trouble for Captain Kirk and company after his exile at the hands of Kirk.  Though the level of hype surrounding this sequel was incredibly high, one still had to wonder about a few things regarding the movie.  One, can ""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan"" truly capture the spirit of adventure that was found throughout the TV series, yet was lacking in the first movie.  Second, would the story of Khan's return be engaging enough to carry a feature film, and how could Khan return due to his exile on a deserted planet with the rest of his genetic superhumans.  And third, can Ricardo Montalban still carry the malice required to ensure that Khan is still one to be feared (this worry was due to Montalban's recurring role on the TV series ""Fantasy Island).  So, did the movie achieve box office glory and lay all fears to rest, or did it fall victim to its own hype?  Read on through the movie synopsis to find out for sure.

15 years after being exiled on a deserted planet by Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and the rest of the crew of the Federation starship Enterprise, genetic superhuman Khan (Ricardo Montalban) is seeking a means to escape the planet so that he may exact his revenge on the despised Captain.  After a mishap lands members of the Federation on the planet Khan and his superhumans are inhabiting, Khan commandeers the starship and by controlling the minds of the crew makes contact with a Federation science vessel that is housing a machine known as the Genesis device, whose sole purpose is to rejuvenate dead planets making them viable for living beings again.  Khan knows that with this device at his command he can take over the universe, though the device creates life, if used upon a planet that already is thriving with life, it would effectively kill anything alive in order to start things over anew.  When word of Khan's attack on the science vessel reaches Starfleet, the powers that be, bring newly promoted Admiral Kirk back to action to face his old nemesis, but Kirk can't stop him alone, he'll need his entire crew back for this mission, along with his old ship that just so happens to be under the command of Kirk's former science officer the Vulcan known as Spock (Leonard Nimoy).  With the crew of the Enterprise reassembled and time quickly running out, Kirk and company head off to do battle with the most cunning and powerful enemy they have ever faced, and this time there will be dire consequences for the Enterprise and her crew.

So, in response to the question I posed prior to the movie synopsis, did the movie achieve box office glory and lay all the doubts and fears to rest?  The answer would have to be a resounding ""YES!""  With the release of ""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan"" it was clear that the creative minds behind this franchise were clearly firing on all cylinders, and that the fiasco of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" could be overcome.  This movie featured everything the first film should have had, from gripping drama involving all of the characters, special effects work that was astounding back in the day, but still holds up fairly well even now, an excellent villain with Khan, and plenty of humor, suspense, and action to please even the most jaded of fans.  Written perfectly by Harve Bennett, this movie pleased fans of the genre on so many levels, and the ending was so crafty and shocking that it left you begging for more, as any good movie should.

As I said before, I absolutely hated ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"", and I know that many hard-core 'Trekkies' would love to string me up for that statement, but I offer this peace offering, as much as I hated the first film, I loved ""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan"" to the same degree.  If you were, or still are, a fan of 'Star Trek' whether it be the various TV series' or whatever, but was turned off to the series because of the first film, please do yourself the favor and watch the sequels, you won't be disappointed..

245977,5,6300213803,"One of the great idealist themes of the Star Trek series is that in times of crisis, your friends will stand by you and believe in you when all appearances are against you.  Any teenage social outcast growing up in the 1970s & 80s could tune in to their local UHF channel running classic Star Trek reruns on weekday afternoons (when we only had about 5 total channels on TV) and immerse ourselves in this fantasy.  Star Trek II is the quintessential melodrama for this theme.  ""It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times"" is a theme in the movie.  And in the Star Trek universe, in the worst of times, your trusted friends will step up to assist you.

The movie asks the following question repeatedly.  What would you do if faced with a no-win situation?  A Kobayashi Maru?  Do you concede the loss?  Do you redefine the rules?  Do you cheat?  Or do you sacrifice?  What steps do you take to protect yourself & your allies?

In the real world, we rarely find friends that will stay around during hard times.  That ideal exists more in the world of fiction.  But if you find a friend who sticks by you during genuinely difficult times and who stands by you when most others step away, then treasure them, because they are one of the rarest assets you will ever encounter.

When faced with a no win situation, Lt. Saavik fights fair and loses.  Captain Kirk cheats and wins.  Spock redefines the terms and sacrifices.

Spock doesn't talk about all he would sacrifice for his friends.  He doesn't say one thing and do another.  The fact that Spock directs his chosen fate at the end of the film is not primarily what makes us cry.  What makes us cry is that we knew his quality of character all along, yet we didn't appreciate it until it was fully realized and he was gone.  He was uncharismatic, logical, insensitive at times, & frank - not particularly endearing qualities.  But to those who knew him well, Kirk's farewell words break our hearts, ""Of my friend I can only say this, of all the souls that I have encountered in my travels, his was the most . . . human.""

245978,5,6300213803,"I saw this movie when it made it's original theater run and I enjoyed watching it two days ago on this DVD as much as back in the theater.  This particular Trek movie has a great story and perfect pacing.  The story moves along quicly enough to keep the viewer's interest (unlike the first Trek movie) while allowing time for a lot of dialogue and character development.

The soundtrack is beautiful. The starship dogfight is about the best space battle scene I can think of.  And, now that I'm approaching the age Kirk was in the movie, I see it all in a very different light than I did twenty four years ago.  It hits a lot closer to home.

Finally, the best thing I can write about this movie is that people who aren't necessarily into Trek or sci-fi so much still enjoy it.  It's just a well done movie.  And, the wealth of bonus features just make it a slam dunk decision to buy this DVD.",1141084800,3,893,4.273809523809524
245979,5,6300213803,"When ""Star Trek: the Motion Picture"" was released, fan reaction was mixed. Although eagerly awaited by Trekkies, the results were mediocre; the special effects seemed to be the true star, not the crew of the Enterprise. Nevertheless, the initial film did incredibly well, offset by the fact everyone were just plain happy to see the return of Kirk, Spock & Co.

But no one was satisfied; not cast or crew or fans. Enter writer/producer Harve Bennett. He wanted to ""build a better beast"". And so, he got back to the original series' roots, screening all the old episodes. No ideas, that is, until he came across ""Space Seed"". Then he said, ""That's it! We're bringing back Khan!"" And that's how ""Star Trek II"" was born.

TWOK (The Wrath of Khan) brings the Trek saga back to story & characterization, with a smattering of morality. The film explores the passage of time: growing old while still playing a ""young man's game""; the contrast between seasoned crew members and their young trainees; sacrifice, death and hope; and how vengeance can be all-consuming.

The latter statement, of course, refers to Khan, reprised with delicious zeal and double-dyed villiany by Ricardo Montalban. If done wrong, his role could have come off as laughable (his wig and garb make him look like an aging 80's metal rocker!). But instead, Montalban turns in an amazing performance, portraying a tyrant seething with rage and revenge for the past 15 years. An opportunity lands in his lap to exact revenge on Kirk, and he does not hesitate to take it.

Most controversial was the demise of Trek's beloved Vulcan, Spock. The death scene is played beautifully between Nimoy and Shatner, and the eulogy is very touching: ""..Of all the souls I've encountered in my travels, his was the most..human..of all.""

The dogfight inside the nebula, in which both ships ""fly blind"" with no sensors or shields, was well-staged and exciting.

Fine supporting turns from Bibi Besch (Kirk's former lover, Carol Marcus), Kirstie Alley (Lt. Saavik, Alley's first film role), and Merritt Butrick (Kirk's son, David; sadly, Butrick died young in 1989), as well as the original crew.

""The Motion Picture"" may have been their first screen adventure, but TWOK is definitely the best; for it set the legend on the right course and cast the mold for future films.",1139529600,3,2320,4.918158567774936
245980,5,6300213803,"I love the colorful, navel ""look"" this film introduced, as opposed  to the ""sterile"" long john uniforms of the original film. This Enterprise is a battleship, and it's crew are prepared by combat scenarios.

The characters are fleshed out beautifully, as they banter with each other. They hold both deep affection and annoyance with each other... much like a real family.

The humor is good... especially the moments were Kirk in his mid life crisis is forced to wear bifocals!

The battles are thrilling, and Kahn is an over-the-top madman with operatic themes. His quoting from ""Moby Dick"" was brilliant.

A few inconsistencies and weaknesses do occur. Kirk's eulogy claimed that Spock ""gave his life"" to ""protect"" the genesis planet. No, he didn't... he gave his life to save the Enterprise... the planet wasn't formed until after the ship escaped Kahn's explosion and Spock was near death.

What a cliche', having McCoy state ""... he's really not dead... as long as we remember him."" Even Hallmark would be embarrassed by this sentiment.

Despite some cliches, this film is well made and thoroughly entertaining.

245981,5,6300213803,"Oddly enough I have not seen a single original series Star Trek episode. I've heard the classic Kirk vs. Spock music and know the character names but never actually watched an episode. Same thing with the other series although I have watched all the Next Generation films. So on a whim and since everyone says II is the best, I blind bought and it was a good purchase.

Apparently(like I said, didn't watch original series), Captain Kirk banished genetically engineered Khan to a desolate planet for 15 years. A little snafu accident with Chekov and his new ship's captain finds himself face to face with Khan. His plan? Why revenge of course. Using mind control bugs he takes over the ship and surprise attacks the Enterprise leaving it a bit crippled.

Turns out there's another thing Khan wants: the Genesis program, which can actually create life on lifeless planets. It has the reverse effect on life already there: it destroys it so the new life can thrive. Perfect annihilation weapon, no? So Captain Kirk and his crew, including new recruit Saavik(and also film newcomer Kirstie Alley of Cheers fame).

What makes II work is that it's quite action packed. It builds up slowly until Khan takes over the ship then the fight begins. It's the 80's so everything was pre CG with motion control shots and cloud tank effects for the nebula at the end but you wouldn't care anyways. Also a quite significant event happens at the end and it's handled particularly well.

As for acting, everyone is of course top notch in their character. No Oscar caliber but come on, we're just happy Spock acts like Spock right? Known for...his...overracting...and...pause-y speech, William Shatner is quite a surprise on here especially his infamous ""KHHHAANNN!"".

I'm kind of torn between this film and First Contact as the best Star Trek(Granted I've only seen 7-10 and this) but so far it's definately up there as the best Trek adventure.",1134604800,,1926,4.859756097560975

I will not bore you with my ""review"" of the film itself (you have 300-plus other people here to do that for you!) but I will add that this is one of the best theater experiences I've ever had period.  The movie is just thrilling to see with an audience.  You forget how some of the lines are extremely funny or extremely cheesy, and how timeless a joy it is to watch the Original Star Trek crew do their thing.  SPOILER ALERT (if you really have been living in a cave)- Spock's death scene literally silenced the house.  No one dared to make a peep.  When Spock says to Jim Kirk ""I have been and always shall be... your friend."" I heard people weeping behind me.

The movie cooks... it moves at a breakneck speed and by the time you get to the end you want to get on for another ride.  This movie is fun all the way.

246017,5,6300213803,"After the special effects showcase that was Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Wrath of Khan was ready to film with a lower budget and a less-known director. However, this installment helped to shape Star Trek for years to come.

In TMP, they attempted to make the cast look younger, like very little time had passed. However in this one, Kirk is having a midlife crisis on his fiftieth birthday. There is much more focus on the characters in this one, and the special effects are there for the story. Also, gone are the space pyjamas from TMP, replaced with red, militarisitc uniforms, which would be the standard for the rest of the original series movies.

The character Khan from the original series episode Space Seed returns. We find that after he was exiled, the lush planet he was set down on suffered from the explosion of a nearby planet. Few of his crew survived, and his wife was one of the people to die. For all this, he blames Kirk, and when Chekov and his captain, Terrel arrive on the planet, Khan forces them to take him up to their ship.

This movie also introduced Saavik, a female Vulcan cadet who would appear for the next few films. We also see Kirk's ex, and he meets his son, David Marcus.

I know that this movie is great for Trek fans, but a friend who never saw Star Trek liked it, so I would say that anybody should give this movie a chance.",1127520000,3,1366,4.408730158730159

I had the Starfleet jacket (that I snagged on barbed wire the FIRST DAY I wore it).  I still have the Enterprise blueprints in the original package.

It was a glorious time to be alive and be a sci-fi nerd, my friends.

But STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE came out in '79...and I almost fell asleep.  It was almost as if they were afraid to cut loose and let these characters go.  Or they figured if they could cram a ton of SFX and the legions of sci-fi nerds would be happily hypnotized.

Thank God for STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN.

I was in college by then and had started drifting away from sci-fi, instead choosing headier movies like ALTERED STATES and BLADE RUNNER.

But KHAN came along and restored my faith in the possibilities of Star Trek.  Even my college roommate, easily the most mocking cynical person I've ever met, got off on KHAN.  When he got drunk after seeing it, he'd lay on the floor and bellow over and over again, ""KKKHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!""

So here I am, over 20 years later, and I just watched it on cable TV.  And it's still the best Trek they've ever made.  I loved those guys.  Kirk dealing with age and a son who despised him.  Spock still stiffly trying to be a human friend to his human friends.  Bones getting crankier, Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, Scotty.

I wish I still had that jacket.

246019,5,6300213803,"In short, STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, was the best of all the Star Trek movies.  More importantly, WRATH OF KHAN was a vast improvement over its predacessor STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE.  MOTION PICTURE was eagerly awaited by fans.  The camera work and special affects were works of art.  In fact, many reviews commented that STTMP was a beautiful film with a lame plot.

WRATH OF KHAN corrected the shortcomings of the first film.  The interior of the Enterprise, which was white and sterile in the first movie, took on a little more contrast in KHAN. Star Fleet uniforms definitely improved moving from the STTMP's pajamas to something more military. We also were able to see phasers, photon torpedoes (only one was fired in STTMP), and transporters.

More importantly, WRATH OF KHAN is a combat story with lots of action.  Actor Ricardo Montalban reprised his 1960s role as the genetically improved warrior Khan.  Not only is it good to see an additional familiar face from the classic Trek years, Khan is a unique character in that although he is Kirk's nemesis, he could quite as easily have been his best friend.

The DVD director's edition of WRATH OF KHAN is vastly superior to the previous VHS releases.  Additionally, this version contains footage that has not been seen since WRATH OF KHAN premiered on the ABC Sunday Night Movie in the mid 1980s.  The restored sound and James Horner music is terrific.

Special features also include interviews with Nicholas Meyer, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and Ricardo Montalban.  None of the features include any interviews with Kirstie Alley -- even though this was the film that introduced her to movie audiences.  Quite possibly there are still some hard feelings with Kirstie's salary demand -- denied, of course -- during negotiations for Star Trek III.

Also interesting is a DVD chapter devoted to the special effects.  WRATH OF KHAN benefited greatly from lessons learned during STAR WARS: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. On the other hand, some of the special effects were pathetically elementary.

Great to see WRATH OF KHAN in widescreen.  This a film that cannot be fully enjoyed on a 13-inch television screen.  Go for 27-inch or larger to get the full effect of the battle scene.  On the other hand, you could simply move closer to the TV screen.",1123027200,4,2313,4.864450127877238

This is about the improved sequel, The Wrath of Khan.  And so begins the curse of the Star Trek movies.  The Curse--as everybody knows--is that only the even-numbered Star Trek movies are good ones.

  Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan shows no signs of the previous movie.  It has colorful uniforms and a good villain.  And it has William Shantner's ""KHAAAANN!"" yell.

  It's the 23rd century, and Kirk is now an Admiral.  An old enemy of his comes back for revenge.  Khan, a superhuman from the 1990's, is angry with Kirk for leaving him on a planet.  Of course, Kirk defeats Khan, but Spock dies at the end...or does he?",1119830400,2,766,4.449275362318841
246021,5,6300213803,"Why is this the best Star Trek movie? There are many reasons and I'll cover them, but the number one reason is Lt. Saavik. Kirstie Alley is the greatest Star Trek character of all time. It is unfortunate that she did not continue with the series, but then again maybe she could not have had the time to be Rebecca Howe on Cheers, and that would have been a real tragedy.

So aside from the sexy Vulcan played by Kirstie, this movie also boasts the acting talants of William Shatner at his best. You can tell in this movie he's going all out and wants to prove himself once and for all. His Oscar worthy performance is topped off when he screams ""Kahn!!!!"" into the comm-link. Pure acting genious.

Not to be outdone by Shatner, Ricardo Montalban matches him line for line as Kahn. From hell's heart he stabs at Kirk, because revenge is best served cold. Playing Kahn is one of the highlights of Ricardo's career.

Also there's some nonsense about a Genisis project. It's not that important. The important parts of this film are the characters. The old Spock and Bones ribbing is here, Scotty is still kicking butt in the engine room, and Uhura is still the sexiest communications officer.

If I had any complaint about this movie, it's that the original short-skirt uniforms were gone. Uhura and Saavik's thighs would have made this movie that much better.

246022,4,6300213803,"""The Wrath of Khan"" was the second of the Star Trek movies and focuses on the crew of the original television series. Directed by Nicholas Meyer, who also made a significant but uncredited contribution to the screenplay, it hit the movie screens in 1982.

The film opens in 2285 during a 'Kobayashi Maru' simulation at Starfleet Academy - this is a no-win situation, designed to test the character and resolve of Starfleet's prospective command officers. Many, though not all, of the trainees are cadets - for this simulation, for example, a Vulcan Lieutenant called Saavik is in the captain's chair. Several senior officers have roles to play, including Spock, Sulu, Uhura and McCoy. Admiral Kirk, meanwhile, is the assessing officer. The final stage of training is a three-week training mission on a real starship - in this case, the Enterprise. Officially, Captain Spock will be in command, though Kirk will also be onboard to continue assessing the trainees.

Chekov, meanwhile, has been assigned to the USS Reliant as first officer. Commanded by Captain Terrell, it has been ordered to find a lifeless planet in the Mutara Sector for use in the Genesis Project. This top-secret program  is led by Dr. Carol Marcus, one of the Federation's leading molecular biologists. Her team has developed the Genesis Device - an item that can reorganise a planet's structure at the subatomic level, changing a dead planet into one capable of supporting life. Carol Marcus' son, David, has also contributed greatly to the project - though, unlike his mother, he doesn't have much time for Starfleet. He particularly doesn't like an officer his mother was once acquainted with : an 'overgrown boy-scout' called James Kirk. Unfortunately, that overgrown boy-scout is his father...and (whoops !) his mother just hasn't got round to telling him yet.

The movie's villain is Khan Noonien Singh, one of a group of genetically engineered humans whose treatment of the 'ordinary' human population led to the Eugenic Wars. A group of roughly eighty subsequently escaped Earth on a 'sleeper' ship, travelling in suspended animation. Kirk, while captain on the Enterprise, discovered their ship and subsequently marooned the on Ceti Alpha V - this encounter was covered in ""Space Seed"", an episode on the original series. However, when a neighbouring planet exploded a few years later the side effects changed the orbits of Khan's new home and left it a barren wasteland. When Chekov, looking for a lifeless planet, arrives with his new commanding officer he initially doesn't realise where they are due to these changes. Unfortunately, they are captured by Khan - who having spent the years blaming Kirk for his plight, now plans to take control of the Reliant and exact his revenge.

A great deal of credit for ""The Wrath of Khan"" must go to Nicholas Meyer - he directed the film and was an uncredited contributor to the screenplay. (He was also involved with the funniest Trek movie, ""The Voyage Home"", and my own favorite, ""The Undiscovered Country""). Meyer, who'd never previously watched the show, was delighted when he was shown the ""Space Seed"" episode and immediately identified Khan as his vengeful villain - a role that Ricardo Montalban returns to. Kirstie Alley, taking a break from serving beer to Norm Petersen, makes her debut as Saavik - a role she was to reprise in the next two films. As for David Marcus - with a libido like Kirk's, it was only a matter of time before he bumped into his offspring. Merritt Butrick also reprised this role in the following movie, and later appeared in a TNG episode called ""Symbiosis"". For many, ""The Wrath of Khan"" is the best of the Star Trek movies - there's plenty of action, it has a huge climax and is definitely recommended.",1119657600,2,3764,4.958795562599049

What happened to the ""Star Trek"" saga, well Nicholas Meyer directed only a few of the ""Star Trek"" films, and maybe thats why some of these film are horrible. I hate ""Star Trek"" now, they replaced Admiral James t. Kirk(yes I said his full name) with Patrick Stewart, who plays a different captain, what were these guy's thinking(I think it maybe Patrick Stewart, I haven't kept up). ""The Wrath Of Khan"" quotes the most famous line of them all,""Revenge is a dish best served cold."" I love that line, it should be in the hall of fame of famous lines, like that line in ""Titanic"" ""I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD.""

THE PLOT

It is the 23rd century. The Federation Starship U.S.S. Enterprise is on a routine training and Admiral James Kirk(William Shatner) seems resigned to the fact that this may well be his last mission of his career. But Khan is back.

This is a very good film, but it doesn't even compare to ""The Search for Spock"", that is my favorite ""Star Trek"" film.",1093910400,,1094,4.4874371859296485
246072,5,6300213803,"A good rule to remember with the Star Trek motion pictures is to watch only the even numbered ones (2, 4, and 6) and avoid the odd numbered ones (1, 3, and 5.) Taken all together, this is the best Star Trek to be released on motion picture. It offers a pleasant recap of unfinished business presented in the original TV series and, it has all the requirements for a great film in terms of direction, script, and cinematography.

  The film addresses the uncertain fate of Kahn (Ricardo Montalban) and his minions who first appeared in the original episode titled 'Space Seed.' Kahn is a product of the past when the Earth was embroyled in a eugenic war. Kahn and his followers were banished from Earth and sent to roam empty space in their ship, The Botany Bay, in cryogenic freeze. After running into the Enterprise and coming out of his slumber, Kahn sought to take over Kirk's ship but his plot was foiled: Kahn and his crew were placed on the uninhabited planet of City Alpha 5 to spend the rest of their days in exile. The film starts at a much later period where Federation men accidentally run into Kahn's colony. Kahn escapes and seeks vengeance on Kirk for having abandoned him on a desolate planet. With guile and cruelty, Kahn seizes a new machine that can be transformed into the most destructive weapon the Federation has ever seen. Will Kirk and his crew stop him in time?

  Ricardo Montalban is definitely the shining star in this movie. His expressions of rage and obsession are quite impressive. The rest of the cast (Shatner, Kelley, Nimoy, etc.) perform their usual Enterprise routine pretty well. The film has a fast-moving plot with a good script and great special effects. This is truly the gem of all Star Trek motion picture films.",1091577600,2,1756,4.630225080385852

Anyway, this is Nicholas Meyer second film.  The first is the time travel classic; Time After Time.  It's obvious why fans love his Star Trek films.  It's the storytelling!  He's great with material.  And getting an extended edition of The Wrath of Khan isn't a bad idea either . . .",1090972800,,508,4.566666666666666
246074,5,6300213803,"Back when ""The Wrath of Khan"" first hit the theaters, I remember thinking that Khan now ranks with the best movie bad guys of all time.  I think Ricardo Montalban may have turned out the best performance of his career by bringing complexity, passion, pathos, and humanity all at once to the role of Khan.  I'll never be able to read Moby Dick the same way ever again - ""He tasks me, and I shall have him... I'll chase him 'round the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares Maelstrom, and 'round perdition's flames before I give him up!""  Sure, I'm an avowed lifelong trek fan, but I don't think I'm exagggerating this by much.
On a more objective note, the movie works very well at multiple levels...
The soundtrack itself is exceptional and, at the time, somewhat ground-breaking for the movie industry.  This is evidenced by the fact that subsequent soundtracks in the sci-fi genre seem to have borrowed from Horner's original score.  I think it was a shame that ""Khan"" was not nominated for an Oscar in the original score category.
The visual effects, which were state of the art at the time, still hold up over twenty years later.  It serves as a good example and reminder that movies used to have good special effects even in the pre-computer era.
The acting was also superior.  I already mentioned that Montalban may have given the performance of his life as ""Khan"", but I don't think it ends there.  William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley also recaptured the feel of the cameraderie from the original series.  I am aware that Shatner is often criticized for being overly-dramatic, but my opinion is that this may also rank among the top two or three performance of Shatner's career as well (including the TV show).  One of the more memorable moments came following Khan's failed attempt to have Chekov and Terrell kill Kirk: [Kirk to Khan] ""You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman you keep missing the mark."", which was, of course, followed by Kirk's timeless ""KHAAAANNNN!!!"" exclamatory.  The acting was so good, IMHO, that the audience doesn't really notice that Kirk and Khan never really meet face-to-face, and the movie doesn't suffer because of it.
The Director's Edition DVD comes with a well-produced disc of supplementary material (interviews, commentaries, etc.) as well.  I particularly liked the recent interviews with the actors on their recollections from when the movie was being produced.  My favorite interview was Ricardo Montalban telling how horrified he was upon realizing how much he sounded like Mr. Roarke from Fantasy Island when he started reading his lines for the first time - ""This is going to be a disaster!  The audience is going to laugh at me!""  He then tells of how he fixed the problem by requesting a copy of the original TV show ""Space Seed"" where the crew of the Enterprise first encountered Khan, and watching it over and over again until he began to recall his original work with the character.  Shatner also delivers a pretty good interview as he describes how he'll one day make Nimoy and Harve Bennett pay for not letting him in on the secret that by the time  the movie had been shot that they already had plans to bring Spock back.  Whether or not Shatner really knew is irrelevant - the interview is delivered w/ a deadpan that leaves the viewer in stitches.  There is also a good piece about how the visual effects were accomplished.
Overall, I rate ""The Wrath of Khan"" as the best movie in the entire series of Star Trek theatrical releases, and one of the better movies ever produced in the sci-fi genre as a whole.",1090022400,2,3616,4.720190779014309

- Captain Spock says goodbye to his close friend while Admiral Kirk honors the fallen in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"".

After 22 summers (to the day) ""Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan"" is still the movie that ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" wanted to be and after ten films in the ""Star Trek"" saga, ""II"" is still the film that all other ""Trek"" films are measured up to (for me personally, this one is tied for first with ""Star Trek: First Contact"").

Admiral Kirk and the crew of The Enterprise face an old enemy (Khan Noonian Singh) from the television series (see the episode entitled ""Space Seed"").

Simplistic plot, but, what makes the film work so well is:

1. - The crew act there age & try not to be the young crew they tried to be in ""The Motion Picture"".

2. - Admiral Kirk has a mid-life crisis as his past catches up with him in the form of the son he hardly knows.

3. - Khan seeks revenge for the death of his wife (the Enterprise historian from the T.V. episode). Wouldn't you?

4. - Aside from the senior staff, The Enterprise crew is made of cadets, giving the film an extra element of danger(the plotpoint w/ Scotty's cadet nephew is one of the extended scenes in the film).

5. - The senior staff, unlike in the T.V. series, is expendable (Scotty gets a bout of radation poisining, Checkov becomes Khan's hostage, and Spock, ..., well you know. I won't give that away for the 2 people who haven't watched the film).

6. - The Genesis Project is one of the most dangerous of all ""Trek"" weapons, yet, it was never meant to be one.

7. - The battle in the Mutara Nebula is classic ""Star Trek"" all the way (the Nebula is featured again in one of the episodes from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". I think, it might be The Best of Both Worlds Part I).

8. - Cherish what you have before its gone and a renewed sense of purpose is never a bad thing.

Quite a lot of detail was put into this film.
Gone are the disco style uniforms from the previous film. In its place, are the now classic, military/naval style uniforms complete with rank pips and badges.
The effects are a lot better than in ""TMP"". The first digital effects featured in a film are of the Genesis Proposal and were made by Pixar (the company would go on to super success with, the 1995 film, ""Toy Story"").

Origianlly titled the ""Undiscovered Country"", but, was replaced by the title ""Vengeance of Khan"". It was retitled to ""The Wrath of Khan"" when Paramount found out that the last ""Star Wars"" film would be titled ""Revenge of The Jedi"" (that would be changed to ""Return of The Jedi"").

This 2 disc extended edition of ""Star Trek II"" has everything but the kitchen sink thrown in (its lightyears ahead of the drab first DVD release). What I like most about these special releases is the triva track option that can run at the bottom of the screen without blocking out any of the screen itself.

This version of ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"", is a 2 disc set that will live long & prosper. Steady as she goes, Mr. Sulu.",1086307200,3,3195,4.316053511705686
246117,3,6300213803,"When I was young 'un (back when I was about 8 or so), The Wrath of Khan was actually my least favorite Star Trek film to date. Having seen it again on TNN recently, I'm not sure why I disliked it so much, and while I won't call it the best Star Trek film (that honor lies with First Contact), it's an entertaining adventure highlighted by good performances, memorable special effects, and two tense, if also somewhat underwhelming, space battles.
The Wrath of Khan is a sequel to the episode, ""Space Seed"", where evil genius Khan and his gang were exiled on a planet. Khan and his group escape, hijack a starship, and plans vengeance upon Kirk. Then there's the genesis device, a machine capable of creating new life, but also has the potential to destroy those the living. It all leads to a tense showdown between the two biggest egos in the universe.
There are a lot of things about The Wrath of Khan that still bug me. For one, there's the slow as snails pacing.  Director Nicholas Meyer often said this film was inspired by the nautical adventures of Horatio Hornblower, but I distinctly remember two things that place such works (as seen in, say, the recent Master and Commander) above Wrath of Khan: 1) watching two big spaceships blasting away at each other isn't nearly as fun as seeing two big 19th century warships firing cannonballs upon each other on the high seas and 2) Hornblower often boarded enemy ships, but seeing as this never happens in Wrath of Khan, we're back to the concept of watching two spaceships duking it out.
I can't really quite begin to emphasize how small-scale space battles aren't my cup of tea. Not helping that problem is the fact that the Enterprise never actually feels like it's in any genuine danger, not necessarily because you expect that most of the crew will make it through the situation alive, but because it just seems like a far more powerful ship than the Khan-controlled Reliant.
Then there's Khan and his gang of marauders themselves, who look more like rejects from a He-man audition than genuinely menacing villains. Matter of fact, most of Khan's men do little more than stand around and ""pose.""  They also look a little young for a group that's been marooned for fifteen years, but maybe that's just the side effect of genetic tampering.  This, however, still doesn't explain why Khan himself looks particularly aged from his last encounter with Kirk, and I don't think something as simple as stress caused by survival responsibilities could explain it.  He may be the leader, but if everyone is also as potentially strong and as intelligent as he is, I see no reason why they couldn't care for themselves.
The plot generally lacks any sense of urgency.  Even in the thick of the action or in apparently dire situations, the film does little to generate any building suspense.  The Wrath of Khan simply doesn't find the right balance between action, science fiction, and characters.  The only genuine sci-fi on hand (aside from all the space travel and the like) is the Genesis project, and even that takes a backseat to the Kirk/Khan rivalry.
Other complaints:  though certain tracks of Horner's score (especially the ""prepping for battle"" scene) are rousing, too much of the music is just grating and certainly can't hold a candle to Jerry Goldsmith's famed Trek score.  Meyer's camerawork is also rather flat, lacking a sense of true rhythm or energy.  Even Robert Wise's direction in The Motion Picture felt slicker than this.
With those criticisms out of the way, there was some stuff I enjoyed about the film. William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban make for an effective protagonist/antagonist duo, with the former delivering a genuinely good performance and the latter chewing the scenery with aplomb. Leonard Nimoy is excellent as Spock, as always.
The most memorable scene of the whole film is the emotional climax, which features the death of a major character. This represented the first time that Star Trek could not only engage the mind and rattle the nerves, but also touch the heart (and put a lump in your throat). The Wrath of Khan appears to be the series fan-favorite, and I can see why, but too much of it doesn't click with me. Still, it's somewhat recommended to those looking for a space opera with the occasional dose of action and pathos.",1085184000,4,4320,4.778820375335121
246118,5,6300213803,"""Star Trek"" has legions of fans, spawned numerous television incarnations, and inspired ten feature length movies.  It even is responsible for adding the word `trekker' (which, obviously, refers to fans of Star Trek) to the official English language, courtesy of the Oxford English Dictionary.  It is not hyperbole to say that ""Star Trek"" is a true cultural phenomenon that has reached into many corners of society.  The second full-length feature film ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" may be more responsible than any other production (television or film) for the series' widespread popularity.  To call it only a science-fiction movie would not do it justice.  After a dull predecessor that tried to hard to be like ""2001"" and appealed only to die-hard Trek fans, ""...Wrath of Khan"" reintroduced fans, new and old, to the great space opera that is Star Trek.  What enabled to transcend its genre and reach mainstream audiences was that it contained elements that spoke to most movie goers.  It is a tale of revenge in the same vein as ""Moby Dick""; a tale of dealing with growing old and trying to recapture youth; it is part ""Star Wars"" and part ""Run Silent, Run Deep""; and, most of all, it is a tale of supreme sacrifice.  All of those elements combined to make this the most successful ""Star Trek"" movie to date (both critically and at the box office) and enables the power of this film to resonate more than 20 years after it first premiered.

After suffering the effects of a stiff story and sluggish fan reception for ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"", producer Harve Bennett went back though all the old episodes of the original series to search for a storyline that would be most worthy of a sequel.  An episode called ""Space Seed"" which introduced audiences to the genetically enhanced super villain, Khan Noonian Singh, or more simply `KHAN!' (as Captain Kirk so eloquently put it in this film).  That choice produced one of the finest science fiction films to grace the silver screen.  In addition, the producers also did away with the clinical sets and pastel uniforms in favor of a cozier Enterprise bridge and uniforms more befitting a space navy.

Khan (played with delicious melodrama by Ricardo Montalban) was a character that would have special reason to seek revenge against Captain (now Admiral) Kirk (William Shatner) and the crew of the Enterprise.  After defeated by Kirk at the end of the ""Space Seed"" episode, Khan and his cadre of genetic super humans were exiled to a planet that soon became an ecological wasteland, killing much of the crew (including Khan's wife).  Fast forward 15 years and Khan is presented with a golden opportunity to exact revenge when an ill-fated scientific mission by the USS Reliant stumbles upon his planet in an attempt to find a lifeless planet to test the Genesis Project, a new experiment that can produce life from lifelessness.  Khan manages to capture the investigative team (which happened to be the ship's Captain and its first officer, Chekov, from the original series) and use mind controlling parasites to take command of the Reliant.  Once in possession of his own starship and free from exile, Khan begins his quest to exact revenge upon Kirk while also seeking to possess the dangerous power of Genesis.

""The Wrath of Khan"" provides some of the most gripping moments of drama this genre has to offer.  The twists and crests in action are frequent, natural, and spectacular.  It's fascinating to watch the horror Kirk's face when he realizes that the man behind the surprise attack on the Enterprise is Khan.  When Kirk, and the damaged enterprise, abruptly turn the tables on Khan as he prepares to finish them off, a rush of adrenaline courses through the veins of all who are watching.  The cat and mouse battle in the Mutara Nebula reminds many of the submarine warfare from ""Run Silent, Run Deep"".  Then, there is the tragic sacrifice at the very end.  All of this made this film such a spectacular mainstream success in 1982 and continues to give it amazing strength today.

The Special Edition Director's Cut restores a few scenes that have been absent from most of the past video versions, most notably two scenes that show what the connection is between Scotty and the young midshipman who dies during Khan's first attack.  In addition, the special features disc provides insightful interviews with cast members that shows the creative process and inspiration that brought ""The Wrath of Khan"" to existence.",1085011200,,4486,4.885224274406332

246120,5,6300213803,"While most of the Trek films have met with varying degrees of success, THIS one is easily the best, and arguably the most successful of the bunch, being culled from one of the most rivetting episodes of the TV series - Space Seed.
As is often true of Trek stories, you can find almost everything here: humor, pathos, drama, excitement. This movie offers all these in spades, relying on many of the old series' tried-and-tested formulas: Bones and Spock in their famous debates; Kirk's think-on-your-toes, save the ship military genius; Kirk dealing with the inevitability of aging; terrific special effects, and of course the magnificent Ricardo Montalban as perhaps Kirk's most dangerous foe ever, the psychotically brilliant Khan Noonian Singh, alive and kicking after a 15 year exile on a barren planet where he lost most of his crew, including his beloved wife. This loss is the fuel for vengence as he sets out on a seek-and-destroy mission to annihilate the Enterprise. Both Kirk and Khan are excellent  strategists and the film pits them against each other in what is perhaps the greatest intergalactic chess game ever.
Shatner's acting may be a bit over-the-top in some scenes but he gives perhaps one of his best performances, as do all the cast. In my opinion though, it is Ricardo Montalban who steals the show with an absolutely rivetting performance that gives the film it's edge-of-your-seat excitement.",1082937600,,1417,5.029787234042553
246121,4,6300213803,"I can remember being slightly disappointed when the first Star Trek movie came out in the theatre, thinking it lacked the television series' ""the Enterprise takes a hit and everyone goes flying around the bridge, everything's blowing up and Mr. Scott has ten seconds to fix it or else...""
Well, I wasn't disappointed with Star Trek II.  It recalls the best of the original TV series: lots of action, an interesting story, the classic character interaction between Kirk, Spock and McCoy.  The claustrophobic feel of the movie works well within the story framework as the crew of the Enterprise are being hunted by their long ago nemesis, Khan Noonian Singh.  Star Trek II does right by its villian, Khan.  He's the bad guy, a genetically engineered superman from the 20th Century, but he's a well rounded character unlike the cardboard cutouts of evil that we are treated to in so many lesser movies.  And he's an able villian, his starship can shoot straight (except in the nebula when neither ship has particularly good aim), and good people need to make the ultimate sacrifice to ensure he is defeated in the end.
I think the reason this movie, out of all the Star Trek movies, works because it not only celebrates the TV past of the Star Trek show, but adds to the canon.  Things happen in this movie, characters change, characters besides ""Ensign Smith"" die.  Good TV results in the same characters and the same situations week after week.  Good movies result in characters developing over the course of the movie.  This is a good movie.
Now, to what's not so good.  For the most part, the special effects are quite good, especially when you take into consideration this movie came out in 1982.  However, the underground Genesis world just looks bad.  It looked bad in 1982 and it still looks bad.  Considering how much the first Star Trek movie was redone for the DVD release, you'd think Nick Meyer might have got some extra money to clean those shots up, maybe with a nice realistic looking cavern.  Oh well.  The Directors' Cut isn't all that much different from the theatrical version: just an addition here and there to add maybe two minutes total of dialogue.
The extras aren't all that impressive.  Almost all of it is interviews and snippets made for the DVD release.  I think William Shatner is trying to be funny with the whole ""Spock dying conspiracy to get more money"", but I would have rather heard real information about the movie.  And didn't anyone bother to shoot any documentary footage when the movie was being made?  No offense, but I am more interested in extras that provide insight to the movie, either physically (show the effects being made, the scenes being directed, etc.) or critically (talk about the drafts and revisions of the story, etc.).
I recommend the DVD as it is nice and clean, the sound is tremendous.  Watch the extras once and forget them, but come back to watch the movie again and again.(...)",1082505600,,2941,4.729411764705882

So let's start with the speculation: ""What if someone was able to create a device that could transform any planet into one that supports life, but would destroy anything that was living there in the process?"" Then we get the story: ""Suppose that someone who has hated you for 15 years manages to get hold of this device and run amok?"" These, then, are the elements that make up The Wrath of Khan. But like so much good science fiction (and Trek), this film manages to be much more.
In the midst of this technological crisis, we find a restless, deskbound Admiral Kirk bumping up against middle age. He has discovered that one of his past liaisons produced an illegitimate son and his eyes are failing on him. Put Kirk's mid-life crisis aboard a starship full of young cadets, and you find our gallant hero up against something he never considered before: his own mortality. James T. Kirk is finally forced to grow up, and William Shatner does some of his best acting in this film.
Ricardo Montalban is also excellent as the proud, driven, and fearsome Khan Noonian Singh, a genetic superman from our(!) century. Montalban had played the character in the original series; Khan was exiled to a barren planet in that episode (""The Space Seed""), and has hated Kirk since then. He is fond of quoting Milton and Melville. He's not your mother's Mr. Roarke.
Cinematically speaking, things look a lot better in ST2 than in the first film. The Starfleet uniforms are a rich, burgundy red and look like something out of Horatio Hornblower. There are more colored lights in and around the hallways. Kirk's quarters are not nearly as austere as they were in STTMP. The lighting of the sets (which are the same) manages to make the Enterprise look more inviting and more warshiplike as well.
There are a couple of down sides. Kirk's son, David Marcus, is a whining preppy, right down to the sweater tied around his neck. Chekov, while promoted to first officer on another ship, is reduced to screaming again when something yucky crawls into his ear. Scotty is starting to chunk out here, though the mustache he appeared with in STTMP still looks good. Uhura is back to her old job of saying, ""Hailing frequencies open.""
Oddly enough, this was my first exposure to Star Trek. I'd never seen an episode until this film. All things considered, this was a terrific introduction to the Star Trek universe.

And after just getting the sixth movie, it seems like Paramount is running out of bonus material.  Maybe they should dig out that soundbyte of Bill Shatner's Strawberry Fields forever.
Great transfer, the picture is crisp and the sound is full.  I remember this movie when it first aired on TV.  That's the VHS version I've been watching all these years!!!  It looks like other people agree about the picture/sound quality.  Well worth it.

246195,5,6300213803,"The success of Wrath of Khan caught Paramount by surprise. The budget was scaled down after the expensive ST:TMP and expectations were down as well. Nicholas Meyer and Harve Bennett made the right move; they went after a classic Trek episode (Gene Coon's ""Space Seed"")and recognized a great villian to play against Kirk in Khan.
Admiral Kirk has stepped down from ""the chair"" yet again and is involved in Star Fleet's Academy training. Captain Spock's latest class will be training on the Enterprise and Kirk's going along for the ride along with McCoy and the core of his seasoned crew.
Meanwhile, on planet Seti 5 Chekov has transported down to a barren, desolate world racked by sand storms strong enough to strip skin from bone. He and the captain of a Federation science vessel are checking for life on the planet. It seems that Kirk's ex Carol Marcus and her son David have designed a terraforming ""bomb"" that literally creates life from destruction; it changes any planet it strikes into a thriving planet with living plants within a matter of days. This revoltionary approach has drawbacks; any planet ""Genesis"" strikes will produce life but it will destroy any pre-existing life forms. So Chekov and his captain are forced to investigate the planet to rule out any chance that there is life.
Unfortunately, the only life forms on Seti Alpha 5 are ghosts from Kirk's past. Khan, the genetically engineered superhuman Kirk encounter twenty some years before, was deposited on the planet with his followers. Evidently, Seti-Alpha 6 the planet they were marooned on by Kirk was thrown into a new orbit when one of the other planets exploded. It changed the atmosphere from paradise to poison. Khan's ticked off and wants revenge. He sees ""Genesis"" as a means to an end--it will be bait to lure Kirk to him and allow him to kill his enemy at the same time.
While traveling with Spock on the cadet training mission, Kirk gets a desperate call  Carol Marcus. Marcus received a message from Chekov that Star Fleet intended to take Genesis away from Marcus and her research team before they've had a chance to try it on a planet wide scale. She had been told this was done at Kirk's command. Kirk, perplexed, tries to reason with her but communication is lost. Suddenly, the Enterprise and her crew are going to be thrown into harm's way with a madman waiting for them.
Meyer's only previous movie was the strong time travel film Time After Time. He wasn't familiar with Trek. That was his advantage. His take on Trek was Hortiao Hornblower in outer space. Meyer, Bennett and screenwriter Jack Soward moved action back into the Trek universe with a tale of revenge and rivalry. Wrath of Khan stands as one of the best Trek  films produced.
This Director's Special Edition features the extended version that Meyer had wanted to release originally. It includes many new scenes and a couple of minor subplots (such as Scotty's nephew surviving on the Enterprise which gives a new meaning to one particular shot near the end)restored to the film. The beautifully transferred DVD is in anamorphic widescreen (which basically means that the way it was transferred allows for more resolution and better clarity particularly for progressive scan DVD players and widescreen televisions). There's very few problems with the picture and the sound is stunning particularly when compared to the earlier laserdisc and DVD versions. The first disc also includes a fascinating running commentary from Meyer and Trek factoids that appear on screen. They range from interesting to funny as heck. The text display is particularly interesting after you've watched the movie the first time to capture all the action. They provide interesting tidbits about the production of the film itself as well.
The second disc features all the extras with the exception of Meyer's commentary track. There's a number of great featurettes that provide a wealth of background on how the film came to be, Meyer's involvement and the cast & crew's take on the finished product. There's also a section devoted to the ILM optical effects, publicity materials and trailers.
There's also a booklet listing the chapters, special features and a nice picture of the original cast included (something Paramount neglected to include for Star Trek VI--shame on you Paramount!). Although there are some minor science errors, they're easy to overlook as the action and entertainment value of the film exceptional. Highly recommended!",1076630400,3,4483,4.991978609625669

Ricardo Montalban returns as Khan who is hell bent on getting revenge on Kirk for the death of his wife.  William Shatner gives his best performance in this film as does Montalban and Nimoy.

The special effects are truly spectacular.  You almost feel like you're there.  The footage also looks better than it did on the single disk release.

The Director's Edition adds about 4-Minutes of footage to the film that was not seen in the theatrical release (The same version shown on ABC in the mid-80's).  The special features are nice and explore the evolution of the film.  A feature on special effects takes you back to how they developed the Mutara Nebula sequence and how the ships attacked each other and how they made it look real.  Plus many more specials.

246197,5,6300213803,"Director Nicholas Meyer puts this age-old question to rest in the spiffy director's commentary included with the Director's release.  My family already owned the entire movie series (up through First Contact) on VHS widescreen, however, as with most DVDs Paramount has given considerable thought to extras (see Product Details).  The interveiws with the principal cast members are both bizzare and funny.
There are also extended scenes that longtime fans will recognize are often only included when TBS makes their tri-annual showing of this film. Some would argue they are still unnecessary and slow the film down, but I am thankful that they were restored for this edition.
This release had a new transfer that was just as good as, if not better than, the last DVD release of the film in 2000.  For a film of this age (and the fact that no one is about to go ""Lucas"" on it), colors are pretty favorable, even with the heave use of reds in the action sequences, uniforms, and its effect on fleshtones. Black levels seem pretty solid, but grain and dirt are a bit more detectable the now old effects sequences (the Mutara Nebula sequence seems to suffer the most).
Audio is Dolby 5.1 surroud -- the same used in the 2000 release (except for the new footage added, of course).  Don't expect to give your surround system a workout.  Fortunately, James Horner's score is still very enjoyable.
Star Trek fans: get it & you won't regret it.
Newcomers: A good introduction into the movie series that include the original, principal cast, though I would highly suggest you watch ""Space Seed"" from the original TV series (as so many others have said) first in order for you to understand Khan (and why it's so funny when Khan says he remember's Checov).  By watching Wrath of Khan, you will avoid the disco fever that plagued the first Motion Picture, and the following movies will make more sense (except for ST V: The Final Frontier).

246198,5,6300213803,"The ""Star Trek"" movies were all originally released on DVD with only the bare-minimum treatment- the ""special features"" were theatrical trailers and widescreen options.  This upset me, especially since the second ""Star Trek"" film- ""The Wrath of Khan""- is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Finally in late 2002, ""The Wrath of Khan"" was given the treatment it deserved, and was fully loaded with special features.  These further enhanced a film that actually didn't need them too much anyways, because it was so good.
""The Wrath of Khan"" is my favorite ""Star Trek"" film, and is arguably the best film that the ""Star Trek"" franchise could ever be expected to deliver.  It isn't a perfect film, but I still give it five stars because of how enjoyable it is.  William Shatner- whose acting has never exactly been heralded- gives his best performance here, showing the right amount of leadership, arrogance, and tenderness.  I won't say much about Ricardo Montalban's performace, since it can just be summed up as the best ""Star Trek"" villain ever.  He hams it up like there's no tomorrow, and he's terrific to watch every step of the way.  The returning ""Star Trek"" regulars all fit into their roles comfortably.  Director Nicholas Meyer injected some much needed life into the series with this entry, as he added the right amount of humor, action, and emotional bonding.  The ending when a major character dies is surprisingly wrenching, even over 20 years later.  The only part where the film missteps is with Merritt Butrick's performance as David- he's really not very good (he would improve in the next entry).  Other than that, this is one ""Star Trek"" film that will appeal to all sci-fi fans, not just Trekkies.
Ironically, this was easily the cheapest ""Star Trek"" film made, even when adjusted for inflation.  The special effects do look somewhat dated now, and some people may object to the film's occasionally hokey tone.  However, I think that this is simply a wonderful viewing experience, and was the peak of the ""Star Trek"" franchise.  If you want to see just how the ""Star Trek"" magic works on its fans, look no further than ""The Wrath of Khan"".",1074556800,2,2161,4.834239130434782
246199,5,6300213803,"Being a huge Trekker, I'm an enourmous fan of the original series and the Next Generation.
When the first Trek film came out, it was a milion miles from the fast fun action of the original show. It was slow and maybe even boring, and not like the series at all.
The second Trek film put right where the first film went wrong and put the original series on the big screen brilliantly. Maybe it was becuase it was made by people who weren't really fans of the show, but it was much darker, faster and more like the show than any of the other films. Not only was the film very well taken by Trekkers and ordinary filmgoers, it still remains the most popular and one of the most successful of all the Trek films. It was virtually remade 20 years later as the enjoyable but nowhere near as good Nemesis.
The film is a sequel to an episode of the original series (Space Seed). In that episode, Khan-a brilliant leader and ruthless criminal played with campy melodrama by Ricardo Montalban (The plane!) was sent to an inhospitable planet with his followers. In the film, Khan is 15 years older an a crazed maniac, obsessed with getting revenge aginst Kirk and Spock.
Star Trek II has a great story, brilliant acting, is thought provoking and the ending is moving and still gives a lump in the throat. There are a couple of things that don't quite click i.e. how does Khan know Chekov, and why doesn't Chekov beam back to the Reliant from inside Khan's home. There's also no face-to-face punch up between Kirk and Khan and why isn't Space Seed in the extras? It would have been perfect if it had been.
The DVD is very good. The film has about 5 minutes restored to it, and has a few brilliant docs, storyboards, trailers, interviews etc.

The Good:
It adds a lot of little scenes that explain small gaps in the storyline.  The digital sound and quality of the DVD are better than the original.  I enjoyed the extras with included interviews.  This is a very nice 2 DVD set.
The Bad:
I found the original cut to be more fast paced and entertaining than the director's cut.  Don't get me wrong, based on my rating it's obvious this is still a good movie, but those scenes were removed for a good reason, they slow the movie down or add unnecessary campiness.  One example is during the famous engine room inspection.  Kirk refers to a crewman (related to Scottie) as a tiger.  Come on...that sounds so out of character.  I've enjoyed the television show and movies for years, but calling a cewman a tiger?  This is along the same line as the scene where Kirk discloses to Spock how he told David about being his father.  Spock's reaction is definitely out of character.

246248,5,6300213803,"To this day, ""Star Trek ll: The Wrath of Khan"" is still the best Star Trek movie ever made, thanks to superb direction by Nicholas Meyer, Richard Montalban's masterful performance as the revenge-filled Khan and a script that is intellectual, but never delves into the world of dweebiness.
Director Meyer had to win over a lot of jaded trekkies after the first Star Trek movie sharply divided them into two camps: those that liked the movie and those that did not.  However, Meyer fought through the muck not only to reunite the trekkies, but also impress and win-over many non-treksters as well with a mix of imaginative special effects, gripping suspense while never losing people with over-elaborate dialouge or indulging in techno-dweeb fascinations.  All this works to move an intricate plot, which in a nutshell is a being with superior intelligence named Khan (An inspired, gleefully maniacal Richard Montalban who gives the movies' best performance) who was imprisoned by Captain Kirk (William Shatner) years ago on a desolate, deserted planet.  Khan escapes seeking revenge on Kirk as well as getting his hands on the Genesis device, a machine that can basically turn lifeless matter in to something that can sustain life (imagine a moon and turning into a living planet).  Kirk runs across Khan while training a new crew for the Enterprise and their battle of wits and weaponry insues. Caught in the middle between Kirk and Khan is the team that created Genesis, which includes Kirk's son and former lover.  Meyer skillfully builds the movie to its unbearably suspenseful climax in which Khan and Kirk are hunting each other in a nebula, blinded by the forces within the nebula itself.
A skillful blend of action, suspense and tragedy, ""Star Trek ll: The Wrath of Khan"" is an amazing cinematic milestone.  Not only is it easily one of the best science-fiction films ever made, it deserves to be on the same bench as ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy and ""The Matrix.""",1056758400,,2008,4.943620178041543

What it did not have is the sense of wonder that came with the fascinating story in Star Trek I. Add to that the incredibly cheesy acting (especially Ricardo Montalban's performance who has mastered the art of the big sigh as an acting tool.

Ok, so I am in the minority here probably with this opinion, but hey I'm used to that.

246251,5,6300213803,"""Now, this is more like it!""
So wrote film critic Janet Maslin in June of 1982 when Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan opened nationwide.
 You see, even though millions of Star Trek fans had flocked to see Star Trek: The Motion Picture in December of 1979, the reaction was, shall we say, mixed. Oh, sure, fans were happy to see Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest of the crew back in action. Yes, the redesigned USS Enterprise was impressive, as were all the visuals. And that Jerry Goldsmith score was just fabulous.
 Yet, for all that, Star Trek I was also a big letdown. And even though the attempt of the producers to make an intelligent, non-Star Wars science fiction story was laudable, the first of the 10 feature films did not fire up the imagination. Wags, according to David Gerrold in his book The World of Star Trek, dubbed it Star Trek: The Motionless Picture and Spockalypse Now.
 However, Paramount's accountants and executives did see good, if not Star Wars-sized, box office rentals, and they decided to give the franchise another chance. So they called in Harve Bennett, a well-known television producer, and asked him to take over from Gene Roddenberry as executive producer for the next Star Trek feature film.
 Bennett took a look at most of the 79 Star Trek television episodes, seeking the formula that would make a second Star Trek movie soar and take audiences where ""no one had gone before."" Yet, ironically, the concept Bennett and co-writer Jack Sowards came up with was to make a sequel not to the first film, but to an episode which aired in 1967 ""Space Seed.""
 In another brilliant stroke, Nicholas Meyer was hired to direct. New to the Star Trek universe, Meyer decided to start over almost as if the first feature did not exist. Although he would use stock footage from Star Trek I (which saved the studio tons of money), there would be new costumes, a new approach, and even a new score by James Horner.
 Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (originally titled The Undiscovered Country, a Shakespearean reference to death) is a Horatio Hornblower-like story of Admiral Kirk's midlife crisis - at 52, he is now a flag officer and faculty member at Starfleet Academy in 23rd Century San Francisco. Unhappy at his desk job, he longs for command of a starship. His former ship, the Enterprise, is now a training ship commanded by his former first officer, Captain Spock.
 It is also the story of Khan Noonian Singh, a tyrant from the late 20th Century who fled from Earth in the year 1996 after the Eugenics Wars (funny, we must have missed those on Fox or MSNBC) and was found by Kirk and Co. in the 2260s aboard SS Botany Bay, a sleeper ship. Revived - in one of those well-meant gestures by our heroes, Khan reverted to type and tried to take over the Enterprise. Only the triumvirate of Kirk, Spock and McCoy enabled the Enterprise to resist Khan and his followers, and he - along with Lt. Marla McGivers and his band of ""supermen"" - was exiled on Ceti Alpha VI.
 Alas! For one of the neighboring planets exploded six months after Khan's exile, and the result was catastrophic. Khan's world was laid waste, and many of his people, including Lt. McGivers, died. And for 15 years, Khan bided his time, until a Federation starship on an unrelated mission arrives.
 Star Trek II then becomes a classic revenge tale as Khan takes over the USS Reliant and battles Kirk for possession of the Genesis Device, a missile which can reconfigure entire planets. Starships duel, explosions flare up on screen, chaos ensues. Khan, of course, is thwarted, but not without great cost.
 Of course, 21 years after the fact, we know Spock gets killed. We know, also, that this movie started a story arc that continued with The Search for Spock and The Voyage Home and that, at least for Spock, death is only temporary.
 The Director's Edition of Star Trek II is subtly different from the theatrical and first - barebones - DVD versions. The story is the same....but this is the slightly longer edition seen originally in its ABC-TV network broadcast premiere in 1984. In this version we find out that the engineering cadet Peter Preston is Scotty's nephew. There are also bits of dialogue that are changed slightly, and some shots presented differently. There is also a great Director's commentary from Nick Meyer. He is a great speaker and very witty, at that. The text commentary by Mike and Denise Okuda is also informative and sometimes even funny. As in all DVDs with extra features discs, there are trailers, featurettes, and interviews with cast and crew.",1054425600,,4565,4.686641697877653
246252,4,6300213803,"I'll admit right now that I'm writing this review as a fan of the series and movies.  That being said, let's talk about this movie.
Star Trek II is a continuation of a Star Trek original series episode titled ""Space Seed"" which introduced us to the villian Khan (Khan Noonian Singh played by Ricardo Mantalban).  Having seen this episode of the series is not a prerequisite for understanding the movie, but would probably make seeing the movie a little more enjoyable.
The basic premise is that Khan was beaten by Kirk 15 years ago and now he's after revenge.  Since Star Trek is about space travel you can bet that this time the two won't be slugging it out like Foreman and Ali which means fierce space battles.
A sub-plot is that Kirk comes face-to-face with his son he hasn't seen since his birth (presumably - I'm not sure they mention it) and the mother of his child who wanted Kirk to stay away.  This plays along with Kirk's uncertainty about his place in life and the way his life could have been.
The production included on this DVD is likely different from what you will recall seeing in the theaters or on video.  It has some slight scene alterations and a few extras that were only shown in the past on television.
Technically speaking the movie employed special effects that were state-of-the-art during production.  However the movie was released in 1982 so don't expect your socks to be knocked off, although the effects are far from lacking.  For a film that is over 20 years old the picture quality is quite good.  And if you have a suitable surroud sound system then you'll find the intense sound effects drawing you in.
This DVD is a cut above the original DVD release (which I purchased before I knew the collector's edition was even in the works).  This one includes an audio commentary by director Nick Meyers as well as a text commentary by Michael Okuda (which focuses on the more technical aspects).
A second DVD included contains numerous cast interviews and production information as well as the trailer.

It may not have new effects shots, but it has interesting extended scenes that had some sort of substance, especially the relationship between Scotty (James Doohan) and Midshipman Peter Preston.

KHAAAAAN!!! notwithstanding); in fact I recite 98% of Khan's lines by heart.  Nicholas Meyer really did inject juice to this revenge story with an unexpecting ending.

The special effects were way ahead of their time, the acting is fantastic (Montalban especially), and the battles between starships epic, most of which are thanks to director Nicholas Meyer who would play a much larger hand in the future of the Star Trek universe.

This Director's Edition DVD is worth noting as well; it is beyond everything Paramount's original full list price DVD had in terms of extras (in the latter's case, zilch), and, just like the rest of the Director's Edition films in the Trek series, is more than worth owning if you've ever considered yourself a Trek fan.",1050364800,,1208,4.844660194174757
246295,5,6300213803,"After the mixed reactions by Star Trek fans and critics alike about the first Star Trek movie, Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan was released in 1982. It instantly became a huge hit, not only with devoted fans and critics but also with people who weren't fans, and for good reason. Khan is back to seek revenge on Kirk and an incredible battle insues between the two ""old friends"". The part where the Enterprise and Khan's ship playing cat and mouse in a nebula was full of suspense and it was brilliant. This movie has everything that makes up a good film. Action, drama, suspense, emotion and great music. The ending was a complete shock to fans and it was indeed heartwrenching to see a beloved character die. But it was not to be, fortunatly. Many fans thought this was going to be the last Trek movie and here we are over 20 years later with now 10 movies made. Without a shadow of a doubt, Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan remains the most thrilling Trek film to date and most likely will be for a good long while.",1048550400,,1015,4.291666666666667
246296,2,6300213803,"I know that this is a very popular entry in the Star Trek movie series and that it did well at the box office, better than the original movie anyway but I found this one slow and monotonous. It dragged on and on and I couldn't wait until it ended. Paramount re-released this sci-fi dog again as a Director's Edition and at a lower price. I haven't even looked at the extras on disc 2 yet because the movie just turned me off. MY friend paid for this as part of a Christmas present and I am glad that I didn't waste my money on it. It is only good if you want to own it as part of the Star Trek movies set.
The story is basically the sequel and conclusion to the Star Trek Original Series episode Space Seed which is one of the best episodes of the series.
Khan, is very angry at Kirk for having been banished to a planet where it is no secret that survival would be very hard. Kirk could have had him punished possibly worse for Khan taking over his ship and attempting to make mutineers out of the Enterprise's crew.
Star Trek 1 and 2 are boring, Trek 3 is a slight improvement, 4 is great, 5 is average but better than 2 and part 6 is great.
I give this DVD two stars. 1 for the movie and 1 for the extra features disc.

An evolution beyond most of the one dimensional villans, he adds a sophistication to the plot that most ST films don't touch.  What's more the main cast is together and in classic form.  No hamming it up in this one.  And who could forget the end: Spock's apparent ultimate sacrifice.......truely touching!  A strong four stars.",1047513600,,542,5.149425287356322
246298,4,6300213803,"The crew of the Enterprise is back, and they seem much more lively this time around, even though they are growing old.  This is part of the story, though, Kirk realizes he's getting old, especially when he receives a pair of eyeglasses as a birthday gift from Bones.  Story: Chekov has been reassigned to the U.S.S. Reliant which is searching for a barren planet to test out the Genesis device, a device which can create a planet out of a lifeless mass, or any mass for that matter.  Chekov and Captain Terrel, the captain of the Reliant, venture down to Ceti Alpha VI to inverstigate the planet to make sure that it could be used as a host for the Genesis device.  While there, they discover Khan and his cohorts, genetically enhanced humans from the twentieth century.  Khan takes over the Reliant and is bent on killing Kirk for abondoning him on Ceti Alpha, as displayed in the TOS episode ""Space Seed.""  Khan and Kirk then begin a game of cat and mouse that lasts until the end of the film, to which Khan acquires the Genesis device, which he intends to use to destroy Kirk and crew.  Spock sacrifices himself, in the end, to repair the war drive so that the Enterprise can escape from the Genesis explosion.  While I do think this is a great film, I feel it is ofter severely overated by fans, hailing it as superior to all other Trek films.
The ups: great direction by Nicholas Meyer, superb special effects by George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic, great acting (especially Ricardo Montalban as Khan), a great score by composer James Horner (who would later do such great scores as that of ""Braveheart"").
The downs: Rehashed images: the Kobayashi Maru sequence uses the same images of Klingon cruisers from Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and the Enterprise approach in the pod is also recycled from ST: TMP.  Also, it seems sill that the Enterprise is sent on a mission with a training crew aboard and that it is the only ship in range to respond to a potentially dangerous situation (wasn't the Enterprise the only ship in range in ST: TMP?  Is the Enterprise like the only ship in Starfleet at this point????).  Also it seems silly to me that Starfleet's stellar cartographers had no idea that Ceti Alpha VI was actually Ceti Alpha V; the Federation would have quarantined the world too if Kirk had perhaps told somebody that someone dangerous was on the planet.",1047340800,,2375,4.617577197149644
246299,5,6300213803,"The Star Trek films are among my top favorites in the science fiction genre, and the Director's Edition release of The Wrath of Khan tops my list as my favorite Trek film of all time.  Conceived as a sequel to the Original Series episode ""Space Seed"", The Wrath of Khan is a story about the adventures of Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and the rest of the Enterprise crew as they attempt to stop genetically engineered 20th-Century madman Khan (played by the ever-delightful Ricardo Montalban) from using a stolen top-secret device called Project Genesis to ignite universal Armageddon in his quest for revenge against Kirk.
The thing I enjoyed most about the Director's Edition was the inclusion of several scenes that had been filmed for the movie, but which were cut in the theatrical release.  One of these is a scene between Kirk and Peter Preston (Ike Eisenmann) that serves to define the relationship between Preston and Scotty (James Doohan).  While it was ultimately deemed unnecessary to the plot, it helped clarify certain reactions from Scotty later in the film.  There are also some extended scenes with Dr. Carol Marcus (played by the late Bibi Besch), her son David (the late Merritt Butrick), and the crew of Space Station Regula One which serve a similar purpose.
I also liked the fact that the Director's Edition had enough extras to warrant the inclusion of a second disc, which is a rarity from Paramount.  The Feature disc has a spoken commentary by director Nicholas Meyer (while I'm not normally a fan of these types of commentaries because they distract me, I enjoyed hearing what Meyer had to say about the film) and a text commentary by Star Trek Encyclopedia author Michael Okuda.  The Special Features disc includes some very insightful interviews with Meyer, Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, and writer/Executive Producer Harve Bennett, as well as two featurettes (Designing Khan and The Visual Effects of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan), original interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, and the late DeForest Kelley, and plenty more.  For those who have enjoyed Star Trek as long as I have, this DVD set is definitely a keeper.",1046131200,3,2195,4.98087431693989
246300,5,6300213803,"So, round two of my quest to watch all of the Star Trek movies in order from the beginning:  The Wrath of Khan.  Often touted as the best of the ST movies, Star Trek II involves the villainous Khan (ruthlessly portrayed by Ricardo Montalban), a criminal, genetically-advanced human, exiled to a barren planet forever...until now.
By chance, Federation ship Reliant unknowingly explores the planet on which he is held captive, and Khan's visitors soon find themselves trapped...coerced to serve his evil deeds under the influence of an indigenous brain parasite.  Of course, Khan's plan is to find his original captor (Captain turned Admiral James T. Kirk, played by William Shatner) and avenge the death of his wife as well as his exile to a dead planet.
The movie follows Khan's pursuit of Kirk and escalates to a battle of proportions only Star Trek could deliver.  Montalban gives an excellent performance of Khan, although his psychotic vengeance too often seems to override his allegedly ""superior intellect.""  Making her movie debut, Kirstie Alley (aka Rebecca Howe from tv's ""Cheers"") portrays the stoic ""by the book"" cadet Saavic....oddly enough, she makes a great Vulcan.  Although I hardly understand how her long flowing mane of brown hair could possibly pass Federation regulations (just watch the movie, you'll see what I mean).
As the ultimate blow to the film, Spock comes to his ultimate demise in this movie.  However, those familiar with the entire series of movies will know that this is indeed not the end (vis a vis ST III:  The Search for Spock), and that the dramatic send-off of his character in Wrath of Khan is one of the most poignant (and controversial) in ST history.
To sum it up, ST II is great fun!  Even if you're a Star Trek peon like me, you'll find it quite entertaining!  :)",1045353600,,1811,4.869706840390879
246301,5,6300213803,"Of the original ""Classic Star Trek"" movies made, Star Trek II has got to be number two on my all-time favorites (with ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"" being number 1).  Originally slated as a two hour movie of the week, ST II is a fast paced, action oriented adventure that will hold your attention completely.
Montalban reprises his role from the original series as the genetically enhanced Khan.  In his original encounter with Kirk, he was a formidable advisary; by the time the events of ST II take place, his brilliance is tinged with the madness of a man bent on revenge.  Montalban brings his full talent as an actor to bear in his portrayal of Khan, making you draw back each time he appears on screen.
The original cast members reprise their various roles and each contribute to the progression of the story.  Shatner, Kelly and Nimoy garner the majority of the screen time; interestingly, this is Kirstie Alley's first break out role.
Holding true to the new ""director's edition"" DVD moniker, director Meyer has included several special features with this updated release.  Most notable among the features is the addition of the extra footage he added when ST II was rebroadcast on ABC's Movie of the Week during the mid 1980s.  While not showstopper sequences, they do add a more rounded perspective to an already finely detailed movie.  There are additional period interviews with Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley, as well as an in-depth look at how Industrial Light & Magic created some of the key special effects sequences for the film.  The ILM footage is remarkable in many aspects, most particularly as there has never been a comprehensive ""behind the scenes"" look at how the Star Trek universe is created.",1045267200,,1715,4.829351535836177

246368,5,6300213803,"[THIS CAN BE DEBATED, SO PLEASE VOTE POSITIVELY.]
After Gene Roddenberry's removal from the producer position because of the debacle regarding TMP, Paramount turned to television producer Harve Bennett, famed producer of nostalgia shows like ""The Sixth Million Dollar Man"" and ""The Bionic Woman.""  Bennett obviously did his homework on what Star Trek was all about and even original writers Samuel A. Peeples and Judy Burns contributed to the script's execution.  But the man that would make this the best Star Trek film would ultimately play the role of unaccredited screenwriter and director: Nicholas Meyer.
For those of you who hated Shatner, I find his acting much better here.  In fact, there are no slackers in this cast at all.  But the actor to be most commended here is Ricardo Montalban (reprising his role as Khan from the TV episode ""Space Seed""), who acts with angst and malevolence as he relentlessly pursues Admiral Kirk in pure Captain Ahab style.  The special effects are also good (some were lifted from TMP because of time constraints) and James Horner provides one of his best scores in his career.  Spock's death is also handled in an emotional fashion, as he Kirk must deal with his death even though the two cannot embrace because of the glass containment room keep them from doing so.
Nicholas Meyer told a story that is phenomenal in essence that it is several things at once: Shakesperian, Sci-Fi (obviously), a strong relation to the story Moby Dick, and submarine thriller (as the two ships battle each other in the Mutara Nebula).  All in all, a GREAT story.
Don't like Star Trek?  Watch this film.  It has many qualities that makes it seem different and yet a part of Roddenberry's legacy.  Get past the Trekkies and the hype of today's shows... WATCH this masterpiece.  It's a cinematic marvel.",1044835200,,1826,4.896103896103896
246369,5,6300213803,"Wrath of Khan is still a great movie, no matter what. Chances are you already own this if you like Star Trek. If not, you might as well click the Buy Now button. Trust me. It's that good.
THE STORY:
The story is top notch, with Kirk facing off against his Arch-Enemy Khan who he defeated and marooned back in the Original Episode 'Space Seed.' Well, Khan is back, and that's good for us. I won't do into too much deatil, on the off chance you haven't seen it before, but trust me, it's a great story, and the movie is still very visually appealing, despite the fact that it's now over 20 years old. Even if you aren't a fan of Star Trek, you'll find yourself enjoying this movie. It's one of the best Sci-Fi movies, ranking up there with Bladerunner, Star Wars, etc.
THE DVD:
This DVD cleans up the footage, which is great because the previous non DE cut looked... well, not bad, but not all that great either. This one shows a remarkable improvement. It's not the greatest transfer you've ever seen, and you'll notice a bit of graininess on 52"" HDTV's and the like, but the color and clarity is a much welcome improvement overall. The colors in particular look much better. Khan boasts a lot of 'Red Alert' scenes, and sometimes you'd wish someone had told the director to tone down the use of that color, but it's too late now, I guess. The added scenes are nice, but one doesn't really work. In the scene where Kirk is showing Spock and Bones the Genesis Project video, they added a small scene. Listen closely. It's pretty noticable where they added in the new stuff. The rest of the new scenes work well, though there aren't as many as in ST:TMP DE. Speaking of the sound: It's great. They did a amazing job on WoK, and it shows... well, you know what I mean... The commentary by Director Nicholas Meyer is insightful, and Micheal Okula once again provides a text commentary, also insightful if you don't have the entire history of Star Trek commited to memory. (Beleive it or not, some of us DON'T.)
THE EXTRAS:
The bonus disk has a nice amount of interviews with the director, the stars and the crew. Mostly new stuff, but also some promo interviews from when the movie was released with Shatner, Deforest, Nimoy and Montalban. When you finish those, you'll find two behind the scenes features designing Khan and the visual effects and there is a feature on two of the writers of the Star Trek novels that tie in with the film. And, of course, the film trailer and a storyboard archive.

Ricardo Montalban (famous for Fantasy Island and driving a Volare) does a great job reprising his role from the television series as Khan. I wish the producers would have found a way to work in his sidekick and real-life comrade Tattoo into the movie as some kind of miniature henchman.  It would have been fun to see him match wits with Spock.  Montalban really shows off his acting chops here, chewing up the scenery like it was bubble-gum.  Hopefully Shatner took notes on being a ham with class.  Also, it is an unexpected treat to look back and see the young Kirstie Alley (as Lt. Saavik, Spocks mentee) before the ravages of fame and Ted Danson reduced her to peddling wicker for Crate and Barrel.  My sources tell me that Montalban is interested in playing Khan one last time.  Check him out in Spy Kids II, he hasn't lost a step!  All in all, too much violence and no Wookies make this a three star film.",1042070400,3,977,4.449438202247191
246371,5,6300213803,"""The Wrath of Kahn"" is considered to be the best of the now 10-entry ""Star Trek"" film series, and for good reason.  The film successfully takes the most important and lasting aspects of the 1960's TV series and lovingly and carefully adepts them to the big screen.
Although a critical flow, ""ST: The Motion Picture"" made boffo box office bucks, and it's open-ended finale left room for a whole franchise.  But what has become clear after more than two decades is that if the second film flopped, ""Star Trek"" would have died.  Thankfully, it didn't, as the films gave birth to the superior ""ST: The Next Generation"".  Gene Roddenberry was moved to consultant status for the second film, and a new producer, Harve Bennett, took over.  Bennett and Co. crafted a script that was a sequel to the 1967 TV Episode ""Space Seed"", about the 20th-century, genetically engineered warlord Kahn.  The script has all the flourishes of what made the series so compelling: Sci-fi action that was really a human story at heart.  A story about revenge, aging, loss, and hope in the face of unrelenting evil.
To direct and help polish the script, Producer Bennett hired Nicolas Meyer, a virtually unknown director who was known more for writing one of the better non-Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes Stories(The Sever-Per-cent-Solution), than anything else.  Meyer had never seen Star Trek before, but he quickly took to it, and the movie went into production.  The budget was not as lavish as ""TMP"", but the way this is handled is brilliant, as Meyer took the space opera of Trek and turned it into a naval excersize set in space.
The plot is well known-Admiral Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise are taking the ship on a training voyage filled with cadets.  Kirk is feeling old and lost as a Starfleet Adminstrator, and while he longs to return to the adventure of space, he seems resigned to the fact that his time in the Final Frontier is at an end.  Meanwhile, a survey mission sent to find a suitable planet on which to test the Genesis Device(A science experiement that can rebuild a desolate, lifeless world into a lush Eden)stumbles accross Kahn, still stranded 15 years after Kirk left him to forage for himself on the previously healthy world of Ceti Alpha V.  However, ecological disaster turned teh planet into a wasteland, killing many of Kahn's crew and his wife, all of which he holds Kirk responsible for.  Learning of Genesis and it's potential as a weapon, Kahn hijacks the starship Reliant and sets out to avenge himself on Kirk.
What follows is perhaps one of the greatest Sci-Fi Genre films ever made.  Kahn is played with remarkable ferocity by Ricardo Montalban, driven to madness by his desire for revenge.  Shatner gives his greatest performance ever as Kirk, tortured by his age and his growing sense of helplessness.  Nimoy is also excellent here, coming back to the better portrait of the Half Human/Half Vulcan Spock than he showed in his stiff performance in ""TMP"".  DeForrest Kelley and Kristy Alley also have great moments in this film, as Dr. McCoy and Vulcan Lt. Savvick, a protege of Spocks, respectively.  We all know what happens at the end, and it it powerful stuff.  Well-written and performed, the ending packs an emotional punch you rarely get in a Sci-Fi film.  Real feelings are on display, and the final scenes are touching and hopeful.
Regarding Meyer's decision to turn the film into Horatio Hornblower in space, this can only be regarded as genius.  The space battle scenes have a definite naval quality to them, and a claustrophobic, submarine-like quality is found in the final showdown.  The effects wizards at ILM did a superb job on their budget, and showed real care for the subject, and that comes through in one of the excellent special features on this DVD.  Also impressive is the story of how the film was made, from pre-script to post-production.  A final note on the score:  It's by James Horner, and it is fantastic.  Horner is of course best known for Titanic, but here he creates a very martial score, echoing Meyer's change in tone from exploration to Naval.  Jerry Goldsmith's score in ""TMP"" is an excellent exploration score, and he found the right themes for that film.  Here, Horner finds the right grove for this movie.  It is a terrific accompaniment to what is happening onscreen, and Horner deserves praise for his efforts.
Overall, this DVD is a must-own for any serious Sci-Fi fan.  It is accessible to those unfamiliar with the series but interested in the genre, and it is of course welcome in any Star Trek fan's collection.  No other film in the series comes as close to capturing the ideals of the TV series than this one.  It is a fine achievement, and I give it a full recommendation.",1042070400,2,4749,4.760683760683761
246372,5,6300213803,"Star Trek II, III, IV are the strongest in the series of original cast movies. VI is a finely done ending, but these three ""treks"" support each other. Since the day of Melville's ""Moby Dick"", there hasn't been a classic, simple, and enganging story of revenge and hatred. Nick Meyer's directorial takeover from Robert Wise (ST:TMP), was a good choice since Meyer likes to lay back on his classic-story roots. He portrays the characters, for the first time, as human...not forever youthful heroes. The Kirk-Khan rivalry take the vengeance scenario to new heights as past and present come together. ST II is about the acceptance of loss, the past that comes full circle, and the bystanding people who get caught in the middle. The Wrath of Khan remains, by far, the best in the series...and a chilling awakening of a realistic storyline. It may be sci-fi, but you can be assured the tale hits home...

Always ahead of their time, groundbreakers I.L.M. created some rather amazing battles that scar the newly refitted U.S.S. Enterprise.
Ricardo Montalbon was great.  Reprising the role of ""Khan"" from the original series, Mr. Montalbon was the ultimate arch enemy.  The story was pretty good and was a vast improvement over Star Trek: The Motion Picture.

There are a few new scenes in the movie, which only someone who's seen in a billion times can pick out, but add to the movie I think.

246421,3,6300213803,"The makers of Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan remembered something that seemed to be almost completely lost upon the creators of the first Trek film: one of the main reasons Trekkies loved the original  Star Trek was that it was FUNNY. As has been said many times before, TWOK is much more in tune with the sensibility of the original series than its predecesor, which plays more like Stanley Kubrick's 2001 than anything from the original series. TWOK's got it all, friends: tight direction by Nicholas Meyer, nifty special effects, and (of course) big laffs.
This (single-disc) DVD, unfortunately, is nothing special - widescreen transfer, 5.1 surround sound, theatrical trailer... and that's about it (though I see that there's a 2-disc Director's Edition out which looks pretty kewl).

246422,5,6300213803,"Everyone knows the curse of Star Trek movies that started with this sequel to the sci-fi pajama time known as Star Trek: The Motion Picture. With Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, this series of movies has been effected by the even-odd curse that makes all the even ones good and all of the odd one's blow. While a true fan, I don't believe any of them ""blow"" (sans Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, what the hell were they thinking), I do think that the odd numbered ones were not up to par with the rest of the series. After the long, drawn-out Star Trek: The Motion Picture the team returned to the series in 1982 and put together what is universally known as the best Star Trek movie ever. It has everything you could want from a movie, emotion, action, violence, and more. This makes up for the odd movies, and then some.
Star Trek II begins with the Enterprise leaving on a training mission full of new recruits, many who are experiencing their first time in space. What Admiral Kirk and the rest of the crew don't know is the USS Reliant has stumbled upon the marooned Botany Bay and remains of Khan's followers exiled from earth in 1996. The center of the plot is a device called Genesis that reorganizes dead matter and brings life where there is none. Khan wants it as the ultimate weapon, Kirk is trying to prevent the destruction of the Federation at the hands of a vengeful foe, and the rest of the crew is caught in the crossfire.
This movie is filled with some excellent space shots of the Enterprise in battle with the Reliant near the end of the movie. As you will see in some of the following screens there are some really neat camera angles, especially the one of the camera mounted on the nacelle of the Enterprise. While the special effects are very 80s and the new uniforms still aren't up to the one's seen in Star Trek: First Contact, this movie stands out as a Trekkie's favorite and any movie buffs favorite Sci-Fi film.
Video
Video quality is what you would expect from a twenty year old film. While for the most part everything looks good, you can see some shimmering in the print (especially during the opening Paramount logo). The colors seemed to have been preserved well on this digital transfer and they are much cleaner and brighter than the original Star Trek II DVD that was released in the film box set a few years ago. While no one generally likes to see a double-dip, if they improve the print this much, it is definitely worth the extra money.
Sound
Star Trek II is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1, and while I still prefer DTS over Dolby it is understandable to not have it on a disc that was made before the audio format's introduction. Sound is generally good, and your subwoofer gets ample work from the low hum of the warp engines throughout the movie. Positional audio is right on and all channels seemed to be moderately well. At some part during the movie I felt that the speech was a big hollow, maybe suffering from audio compression to fit on the DVD, but besides those few moments (Kirk talking to Savvik on the Simulator Bridge and Kirk screaming in the Genesis cave are two examples) the audio is great.
Extras
Paramount went all out with this DVD and it features interviews with the original cast at the time of the original movie as well as updated interviews with the surviving members of the crew. It was nice to hear what DeForest Kelley thought of the movie and while I would have loved to hear what he had to say today, I know it can't happen. The movie itself features four additional minutes, including the oft-neglected scene where Scotty tells Kirk that a young crewman is his youngest nephew, so the emotional reaction when he is killed in the initial attack is understood more by the audience. There are featurettes on the special effects and the movie disc features commentary by the director Nicholas Meyer as well as members of the cast and crew. All in all the second disc is packed with about five hours worth of new content.
Summation
Star Trek II is one of my favorite Star Trek movies, it actually comes in a close second behind Star Trek: First Contact. While most fans can't wait to see Star Trek: Nemesis this December, picking up this DVD and seeing how it was done 20 years ago is a great way to pass the time. There are rumors of the Star Trek III: The Search for Spock Director's Cut to be released shortly before the 10th movie, but until then, enjoy this disc...P>-- Erich Becker is a die-hard Trekkie.",1037145600,3,4483,4.46829268292683
246423,5,6300213803,"Certainly the best of the original cast Trek movies, Wrath of Khan the Director's Cut is augmented by fun features. Notably, Mike Okuda's ""text commentary"" reveals unique production tidbits that even ardent Non-Trekers will find interesting. A delight for any student of film as well. Throw in a fine audio commentary track from the director, a disk of featurettes, and the discovery that the longer version of Kahn is actually better, and you have a decent product for any film fan, and a must have collection for Trek fans (of any level).",1036886400,,540,4.880434782608695
246424,5,6300213803,"As a viewer that prefers the original cast films (and TV shows), I am unapologetic about calling Star Trek II the greatest Trek film, and with the passing of Deforest Kelly, it will remain the greatest.  It has everything Trek fans could want: a great villain, space battles, morality conflicts, humour, and, of course, William Shatner chewing up the scenery.
The best ""Original Series"" shows contained a mixture of philosophy and action, both of which are readily apparent here.  The story: The exiled Khan escapes by hijacking a starship, then sets out to revenge himself on Kirk.  Along the way he learns of the Genesis Project, basically a super-fast terraforming process that would render lifeless worlds habitable in mere days.  The problem - if used where life already exists, it would wipe out that life and rearrange it to fit its new pattern (this is why the Klingons come after it in ST III).  The action follows Khan's parallel schemes to kill Kirk while stealing the Genesis device.  The philosophy arises from Spock and McCoy's debates on the merits of the Genesis Project, as well as Kirk coming to terms with aging (he gets reading glasses and meets his now-adult son who hates him).
The acting is what you'd expect from the likes of Ricardo Montalbahn and William Shatner - emoting galore!  But it works because director Meyer has arranged the film as a melodramatic space opera.  Meyer also includes some nice touches, such as piping aboard flag officers, standardised uniforms, and other naval touches.  Curiously, the two antagonists never meet in the flesh (and therefore the actors never worked together); perhaps this is more realistic: after all, Villeneuve and Nelson never went 1-on-1 at Trafalger.  Thus, Meyer's fusion of age-of-sail naval fighting with science fiction has a neat feel of authenticity.  Finally, the score is probably the best of the ST films.
This DVD edition is certainly worthy of the quality of the film.  There are numerous extras, from documentaries on the effects and set designs, to the fascinating text commentary by Jan Okuda.  Meyer lends some nice insight in his audio commentary as well, although he sounds more like a scriptwriter (which he also does, but not on this film) than a director.  With a cost that is little more than a normal DVD, it's also great value.  But the absolute highlight is the suit that Leonard Nimoy is wearing in the extra ""Original Cast Interviews.""  It has to be seen to be believed!",1036540800,,2470,4.9014423076923075
246425,5,6300213803,The dvd is packed with great material.  The old interviews of the stars are great.  The movie itself is in my opinion the best Star Trek flick. It is a good continuation of the series.  Extenede directors edition does not have much movie film. Overall a must have and joins The Motion Picture as a classic.  Cannot wait to see the new edition of Search for Spock,1036368000,,362,4.358208955223881
246426,4,6300213803,"I am one of the 3% of the US population who happens to believe that ""Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan"" is inferior in quality to its predecessor, ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"".  The first Star Trek film had been a unique achievement in sci-fi, one which matched a brilliant score to absolutely stunning visual effects and a highly cerebral plot that was undoubtedly over the heads of the masses of moviegoers with short attention spans.  As a result, it is repeatedly slammed as ""boring"" (a highly subjective term, when you consider the film's pivotal importance in the development of Kirk's and Spock's characters, and the mature and sophisticated acting displayed by Shatner and Nimoy),
while ""The Wrath Of Khan"" is to this day revered as one of the finest of the ST film series for being its action-packed antidote.
There is no doubt that ""The Wrath Of Khan"" is the tighter paced, tighter edited and more action-packed film of the two.  It also features a powerful, almost-iconic performance by Montalban as Khan and elements of humor which keep the tone light on its feet.
Its parallels to ""Moby Dick"", its themes of revenge and self-sacrifice, and of course Spock's final death scene are appealing and well-executed.  It is never less than enjoyable.  However, to these eyes it is actually *less* of a Star Trek movie than the first film.  Its brand of shoot-em-up battle pyrotechnics and over-the-top spectacle seems more influenced by the ""Star Wars"" blockbuster mentality than the quiet, graceful subtleties and artistic beauty of ""The Motion Picture"".  The themes of artificial intelligence, exploration and most of the character portrayals in ""The Motion Picture"" all smack of Roddenberry's original vision, whereas ""Wrath Of Khan"" gives one easier, more simplistic payoffs that remind one of the kind of formula television Harve Bennett cut his teeth in.  To be sure, Bennett saved the franchise--he brought the film in under budget and made Star Trek a success with the mass audience blockbuster mentality.  And it is a fun movie; it is not my intention to change anybody's mind with this review (by now, 99% of all Star Trek fans have their minds firmly made up regarding their opinions of all nine films).  However, I simply prefer the careful details, deliberate pacing and complex themes of the debut film, and have never found them ""boring"", ""silly"" or ""pretentious"".  I have never figured out how the film which played such an important role in the maturation of Spock's character could be so panned by audiences; by contrast, all he does in ""Wrath Of Khan"" is sacrifice himself for the ship, something we saw him do many times over in the original series.
Anyways, this new director's edition adds two or three extra minutes dealing with Scotty's nephew which are OK but not essential (there's nothing as radical as the major SFX rehaul or edits found for ""The Motion Picture""); on the other hand, the picture and sound quality are perfect.  The special features on disc two are all interesting and worthwhile, especially the interviews with the cast and crew.  As a whole, the new editions of both the first two Star Trek films are up to a very high standard, and I look forward to seeing the rest in this manner.",1035676800,,3234,4.868852459016393
246477,5,6300213803,"I've put off buying the STII DVD for some time because I was waiting for a special edition.  It was worth the wait.  And for those of you who couldn't wait, it's worth a double dip.  This is an excellent edition of Star Trek II.
First, the print looks beautiful.  The previous DVD had a terrible transfer (I never knew that space was green, for example).  This looks great.  The picture is clear, clean and the colors are perfect.  The sound is excellent, even on a simple stereo TV.
The extras are good but not oustanding.  The director's commentary is entertaining.  The 2nd disk leaves a little to be desired (like the ST1 Director's cut) but is worth your time.
The additions to the movie for the director's cut are mostly minor and add very little.  There are a few alternate takes of scenes which are slightly inferior to the original, but only if, like me, you know the dialogue by heart, even to the cadence of the actor's voices (yes, I know, I know).  There is also a little bit of extra dialogue in some scenes.  Nothign to write home about, but interesting nonetheless.
Of course, the main reason I give this DVD 5 stars is the movie, which many feel is the best of the series.  It is, as the director envisioned, Horatio Hornblower in Space -- complete with exciting battles and compelling characters.  While the movie is a sequel to an episode of the classic TV series, you will not be lost if you haven't seen it.  I hadn't when I first saw Kahn in 1982 and I had no problem following the plot.
In short, the extras and new scenes would not make this DVD worth your money.  But the dramatic improvement in image and sound quality demands you purchase this version if you love Wrath of Kahn as much as I do.",1033948800,4,1721,4.381703470031546
246478,4,6300213803,"This is more like it!
While the DVD for ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" was just fine, the extras were, for the most part, overladen with the all too typical Paramount marketeering. The interviews played more like infomercials for Trek merchandise than legit extras about that least understood or appreciated Trek film. No so here, with the brand-spanking new edition of ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan""! The interviews on this disc are (mostly) exactly what they ought to be; informative, and giving the viewer/fan a new perspective on the film and the classic Trek show and cast.
While the extras are extensive and overall fairly well-done, the best part of this new director's cut is the return of missing scenes. Most of these are emotional scenes with Scotty that we're all aware of, but there are other things as well.
Most notable of these restored scenes is the quiet moment when Kirk confesses to McCoy that they were still alive after a Khan attack because Kirk knew a secret about the ships that Khan didn't. A great Kirk moment that should never have been cut, just like the Scotty scenes. With the added bits restored, the movie plays so much better you can't help but feel it.
The special effects shot where the ship leaves dry dock is the same cut from the original version of ST:TMP, where the black special effects armature is still visible on the secondary hull. Why they didn't splice in the updated cut from the ST:TMP director's cut is a mystery. But that's part of what made ST:TWOK so much of an improvement over ST:TMP; new effects and radical re-editing were not needed in order to spruce up the ""Khan"" film, even twenty years later.
The only real downer here has to be the interview with Greg Cox, included in the extras on Disc 2. This segment plays more like a mockumentary than anything else, and Mr. Cox (author of a Khan revisionist history), was a poor subject to interview. He comes off as the stereotypical ""Trekkie"", the unfair and unkind nerd image that so plagues the entire spectrum of sci-fi fandom. The whole segment was played for laughs at Mr. Cox's expense, and at the expense of the ""Trekkie"" group of Trek fans. An unfortunate and puzzling inclusion in an otherwise excellent disc (I had to take at least one star off for this).
Despite any minor quibbles, this is the best Trek movie so far, and looks fantastic on this DVD. If you like Trek, you'll want this disc, even if you currently own the pared-down standard version that was previously released.

246479,5,6300213803,"Though THE MOTION PICTURE began the Trek movie endeavors, it was STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN that really brought out the best for Trek fans everywhere. With magnificent battles, thrilling special effects, and the superb acting of Ricardo Montablan, THE WRATH OF KHAN is a thrill-ride from start to finish. I also liked seeing Kirstey Alley as Lt. Saavik, and she does a surprisingly nice job as the curious and charming Saavik. And Berritt Mutrick does a splendid job as the son of Kirk.
THE WRATH OF KHAN deals with the story of Khan's return, and his plans to snag his hands on the Genesis Project for his own deadly plans, and when he hijacks the USS Reliant and its crew, Kirk and the crew must stop him before it's too late. The battle scenes, especially in the Motara Nebula, are brilliant, and well done. You'll find yourself satisfied after you watch this movie, and left with a feeling that it got more than just it's job done for all the Trek fans.
THE WRATH OF KHAN also concludes with the ""temporary"" death of Spock, who gave his marbles to McCoy so that it would be possible to revive him in the next movie, THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK. Exhilirating, fast-paced, and with great savvy intelligence, this is one Trek you'll want to watch again and again! Highly recommended!",1033776000,,1282,4.578260869565217

Like father,like daughter and like how Star Wars was to him back in 1977,that's how ST2 was to me. That scene when the Enterprise left the spacedock(which was way better in this then in the first Trek movie)was like the stardestoryer comming out of the side of the screen in Star Wars. ST2 is a sequel(or kind of)of an episode of the original series called Space Seed,with the character of Khan(played wonderfully by Ricardo Montalban)stealing the USS Reliant,to find and destory Kirk for what he did 15 years earlier. The DVD was great,the new scenes were cool and I loved the trailer which was so campy. ST2 is a very beautifully made picture which outdoes the first Trek movie. One of my favourite scenes is the first battle between the Reliant and our beloved Enterprise. I believe it was the energtic and beautiful score by James Horner,brillient characters and a great story to go with it makes ST2 The Wrath Of Khan one of the best of the Star Trek movies.

Also, the special effects are very good, I don't care what era you're in. Khan is a great enemy, Spock dies, Kirk meets his son. All emotional stuff on so many levels. The extras are quite appropriate, except for a overlong feature on some Star Trek novel writers. The Director's commentary is as Spock would say it, ""fascinating"", and it explains a lot. It also touches on the family that the actors have become, whether they like it or not. It's also probably the first commentary where I felt like I was holding back the tears. Check it Out, like now!

Now of course Motion Picture is far away the best with the new effects and editing but Wrath of Kahn is still second best. Two BIG problems with Wrath of Kahn which seem totally inexcusable since this movie is a sequel to the original episode Space Seed from the T.V. series. In Wrath during the Kobayashi Maru test it is said that the event takes place in the Klingon/Federation neutral zone. There is no Klingon/Federation neutral zone, it is and has always been a Romulan/Federation neutral zone, and even more dumb is Kahn remembering Chekhov when he sees him again. Hello Paramount, Kahn never met Chekhov, Chekhov was not in the episode Space Seed, he never met Kahn and Kahn could not remember someone he never met! Do you guys even watch the original series before you start writing stories that make no sense? Geez, really.

246556,5,6300213803,"In the wake of Robert Wise's ""director's edition"" of STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, it was only a matter of time before Nicholas Meyer's STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN was awarded the same treatment. Half a year later, KHAN does indeed get the royal treatment with a 2-disc set loaded with extras and fan tidbits galore. The package includes a slightly extended ""director's cut"" of KHAN that restores a critical plot point (namely, the young cadet who dies in Scotty's arms is actually Scotty's nephew) and a few brief clippings of dialogue (mostly back-and-forth exchanges among the main cast); a commentary by Meyer in which he discusses both the film and his approaches to filmmaking; a text commentary by STAR TREK's long-time technical point man Michael Okuda that's packed with more fanboy knowledge than a game of Trivial Pursuit; cast interviews from 1982 (in which Leonard Nimoy wears a pink and white striped suit that makes him look like a pimp); three documentaries covering the making of the film; ""A Novel Approach,"" a documentary where TREK authors Julia Ecklar and Greg Cox discuss how KHAN's plot elements spun off into the TREK novels; the film's FX storyboards; and of course, the theatrical trailer. Let's look at each of these:
THE DIRECTOR'S CUT OF KHAN - the film makes a bit more sense now that the scenes establishing the doomed cadet as Scotty's nephew have been restored, and the restored dialogue adds a little extra kick to the proceedings (it's especially funny to hear Spock respond to Kirk's telling him about his son with a disinterested ""Fascinating""). But the film is still as tightly structured and fast-paced as it's ever been; the added footage does nothing to slow the film down or to harm the story (although some nit-pickers will make the hilarious claim that the whopping THREE minutes restored to the film ""butcher"" it and ruin the pace-how can this be when the added three minutes are spread out over the whole film?). Rather, it gives it a bit more punch. As for the look of the film, it's certainly a lot cleaner and brighter than most other prints, but even with the digital re-mastering, there's still a lot of visible film grain. Like STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE before it, KHAN looks its age regardless of the print quality. But this is a minor detail. Overall the film looks pretty good.
COMMENTARIES - both interesting and enjoyable. Meyer's regular guy vibe and insights into the making of the film are engaging, and Okuda's trivia-heavy text comments are a joy for anyone who thrives on knowing useless fanboy tidbits.
CAST INTERVIEWS - a unusual time capsule in which the film's leads plug the film. But let's face it; the coolest thing about this insert is seeing Leonard Nimoy dressed like a pimp. Spock in a pink suit is perhaps the greatest source of laughs you'll ever find.
DOCUMENTARIES - by far, the coolest of these is ""Where No Man Has Gone Before,"" which covers the stylish FX work ILM did on the film. The giddiness with which the film's FX  crew recalls their work on the film is enormously contagious. ""Designing KHAN,"" about the film's costume and set designs, is pretty good, too. ""Captain's Log,"" about the overall making of the film, is uneven though. Where Meyer, producer Harve Bennett, and Ricardo Montalban are discussing what went into the making of the film, William Shatner spends his time being a total wiseacre, either mercilessly razzing his pal Nimoy (""I think the death scene would have been better if we DIDN'T see him thru the glass!"" and ""Oh, he knew he was coming back, he set me up to think he was leaving...I'll get him one day!"") or joking about how he used women's cosmetics to look younger. And Nimoy is no better, cracking wise about how much older Shatner is than he. (For those of you wondering, this is how they act around each other all the time.) The insight/clowning-around mixture simply doesn't jell. But to be fair, at least Nicholas Meyer is finally acknowledged as the author of KHAN's shooting script, not Jack Sowards as has been erroneously credited. ""A Novel Approach"" is interesting, but dry; it bogs down when the authors recite passages from the novels. The moments where they discuss how KHAN formed the backbone of their work and display their fan knowledge are the most enjoyable, even if the supertitles used during the film clips steer too much into jokiness.
STORYBOARDS - mind-blowing. We're treated to the conceptual sketches of the film's FX shots (including the combat sequences, which match those in the finished film almost exactly), as well as some terrific concepts for the opening title sequence and the ""Spock monologue"" finale that really should have been used in the film. Illustrated by the late Mike Minor, these storyboards read like a really good comic book.
THEATRICAL TRAILER - pretty dramatic for a teaser, and it gives a good idea of what the film was going to be.
Despite a couple of rocky patches, the ""director's edition"" of STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN is a worthy package to a really good film. Highly recommended.",1030406400,49,5064,4.8006872852233675

Khan wants revenge on Kirk for banishing him and his people to a waste land that no life and was not habitable.  This is a great sequel for Star Trek fans!

246558,4,6300213803,"Of all the movies to pick to write a final paper about, I chose Star Trek II. The best of the Trek films (I'd put VI in second place), I was stunned to find that this movie I watched over and over growing up had an incredibly moving and thoughtful subtext when I watched it again in college.
ST II has some of the best moments in the long history of Star Trek, including what I feel to be Kirk's two greatest moments in his two confrontations with Khan. But the strategies and explosions aside (and those are great in this flick), it goes much deeper.
I invite everyone to rewatch The Wrath of Khan purely for the parable about aging, death, and rebirth. Kirk's final words (which I won't reveal here) on the bridge of the Enterprise bring the parable full circle. The film is remarkably deep, I continue to be surprised.
Finally, a quick note about the Director's Cut DVD -- it is a gem. The video and audio transfers are great, and definitely take advantage of 5.1 digital surround at a few points in the movie. The picture quality is quite good, and improves by leaps and bounds over that widescreen VHS and the early DVD. The extras are interesting to a point -- the old trailer is hilariously bad, but I could easily do without the ""Hi, I'm a professional Trekkie"" short film. It felt like being cornered for 20 minutes by the guy wearing Spock ears at a Trek convention.
Overall, I am pleased to recommend this new packaging of Star Trek II on DVD. I think you will be pleased and, when you look a bit deeper into the film, moved.",1029974400,3,1536,4.355400696864112

246560,5,6300213803,"Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan succeeds because it strikes the perfect balance of drama, action, humor, pathos, and depth. After the critical failure of the first Star Trek movie (which hit movie theaters before being properly completed), the producers took the trouble to view every episode of the original series to figure out what made it enduring.  They replicated it successfully in The Wrath of Khan. Unlike the first film, the plot is driven by the actions and motivations of the characters. This is not a story about spatial anomalies or an excuse for technobabble and flashy special effects. This story is about the classic themes which have served drama well since ancient Greek theater: the quest for vengeance; lost loves; the alienation, anger and reconciliation of fathers and sons; and the realization of mortality. Of the many science fiction films I have seen, few have tugged at the heartstrings as deeply as The Wrath of Khan. The most powerful moments are the bittersweet reunion between Kirk and Carol Marcus, the death of Spock and Kirk's eulogy, and the long delayed embrace between Kirk and his estranged son David. These moments are so universal that any ""science fiction"" label for this film seems limiting.
The script is helped by what is undoubtedly William Shatner's finest performance as James T. Kirk. Shatner brings the perfect balance of bluster, brio, and vulnerability to the aging Admiral. Toward the end of the movie, Kirk, shattered by Spock's death, tears down his defenses and allows us to see the human being behind the uniform. Ricardo Montalban, in a blood thirsty, Ahab-like performance, proves that there is much more to his acting than what was seen on Fantasy Island.
The special effects, which are entirely at the service of the story, for the most part hold up remarkably well--two exceptions are the Ceti Eels and the Genesis Cave Waterfall, which look rather primitive by today's CGI standards. James Horner's crisp, vibrant score hints at the great things which were to follow from him--it's a pity he has not been used in more recent Star Trek fare.
This Director's Edition contains some additional footage which was not in the theatrical release.  Among this are scenes which reveal why Scotty was so upset over the death of the Cadet in Engineering, as well as some minor additions.  Unlike the DVD release of the first Star Trek movie, there have been no enhancements to the few dated visual effects, such as the Genesis Cave Waterfall.  The bonus material features interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, and Bennett, as well as several behind the scenes looks at the visual effects (this was the first film to make use of computer graphics) and production design. Less interesting is an extended look at the Trek universe as seen through various novelizations (which, as every Trekker knows, are not considered ""canon."")
The picture and sound quality are identical to the earlier DVD release, a definite improvement over VHS and laserdisc, but not spectacular by DVD standards.",1029888000,11,3038,5.00990099009901

No other movie has ever duplicated the issues of growing old, dealing with death and life...it will be on American Movie Classics if it's not already.

And after years of waiting, a director's cut that does the film justice. This two-disc set is packed with great features including a documentary about the film's special effects. The FX may seem seem outdated, but, in fact, they marked a milestone in filmmaking. Star Trek II featured the first 3-D computer graphic imagery (CGI) ever used in a motion picture to create ts ""Genesis Effect"". video scene. Best of all, the widescreen movie features numerous scenes that were cut (why?) from the home video and original DVD release. The last time many of these scenes have been seen was when the film aired on television about 12 years ago. Among the new storylines re-inserted are the dialogue introducing Scotty's nephew. The added scenes aren't much, maybe only 3 minutes of footage total. But they add so much to the story, the film becomes even more emotional.

Regrettably, the emotional power of the film's climax has been dampened and cheapened by numerous sequels.
This two-disc DVD edition finally gives _Star Trek II_ the royal treatment fans have clamored for.  For my part, I wish the theatrical cut of this film had been included alongside the new ""director's cut.""  The extra scenes, totaling about four minutes in length, are mostly bits of unnecessary exposition, and they merely bog down the story at crucial moments.
Audio and textual commentaries provide an encyclopedic overview of the film's creation.  Because of producer Harve Bennett's incessant penny pinching (none of which is visible onscreen), the behind-the-scenes anecdotes are much more interesting than one might expect.

246607,5,6300213803,"Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Kahn (Directors Cut) this is a fantastic DVD. Thanks to the genius that is Nicholas Meyer. He took the time to make a really great commentary and it is not your normal commentary either. He speaks of working with various types of actors, he speak with reverence at those who have established careers and he also gives praise to his technical wizards that made this film possible. Director Meyer is a very smart and obvious talented man.
The movie itself is my second favorite of all the Star Trek Movies. (Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is my favorite.) And the best one for watching adventure. (The Voyage Home has the better story and a lot of humor - by the way Nicholas Meyer also is credited as one of the co-writers on that film too!)
Meyer will tell you himself that being a `story teller' is a big responsibility and he wanted to bring, reality, color, detail and a sense of humanity to this story. Also credit is due to Producer Harve Bennet for picking the story and getting the cast together to do this film. Most weren't interested in doing another due to the first film being not so critical success - although it was a big financial success.
Kahn was marooned on a planet back when the original series aired. He is back with a vengeance in this one. And he is mean. I won't tell you much more. Let's just say Kirk, Spock and McCoy have their hands full. There final battle scene is the best I have ever seen and the innate humor very real. This edition also contains many scenes that were not in the original.
Other extras on this DVD include interviews with the cast and crew and they are very specific, detailed and funny. There are even interviews that were done in 1982 when the movie was actually made. Also the screen menus are some of the best I have every seen. The only thing that is a little boring is the Star Trek Fan Writers - although noteworthy - not something I would have put on the disc.
This is a must for every sci-fi fan and a MUST for every Star Trek fan. This is two DVD's too! I hope they do this for the rest of the TEN films. Write me and let me know what you think!  (8-12-02)",1029196800,,2143,4.278325123152709
246608,5,6300213803,"After receiving The Director's Edition of TMP for Christmas, I was hoping that the series would continue.  Pleasantly, I was not disappointed.  Nor am I disappointed with this remarkable DVD.  All of the material which was added for the film's network showings are here - some of which I remember vividly, others I did not remember.  TWOK has always been my favorite Original Series film, not because of the fantastic battle sequences and plot, but for one of the underlying themes of the film:  Is a victory (or sucess) really a victory if it means sacrificing a beloved friend and comrade?
As for the second disc which contains all of the bonus material, the interviews (past and present) had me totally engrossed.  Yet, Shatner, Nimoy, and Montalban are showing their age.  It was fun seeing De Kelley in the retro interview section.  It is unfortunate that he is no longer with us to see the franchise continue to flourish.  I think someone should be commissioned to give Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy the send off he so richly deserves.  I absolutely loved this DVD and eagerly await the same treatmentfor Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.",1029196800,,1143,4.785714285714286
246609,5,6300213803,"The cognoscenti agree, this was the best Star Trek movie ever!  Only the truest fanatics (a small but vociferous group), were enthusiastic, after the somnambulistic  S.T.: The Motion Picture.  At the time, there had only been the series a tepid Saturday morning cartoon, and the even worse first movie.
But this film changed all that.  It was the follow up to a singularly popular episode from the television show, Space Seed, with Ricardo Montalban as the eugenics war creation Kahn Nonnien Singh.  Kirk , Spock. McCoy and the entire crew of the Enterprise stumble upon the man they had exiled more than a decade before and his small, aggressive crew.
Kirk vs. Kahn is the vehicle; revenge on Kahn's part is facilitated by the ability to take yet another ultimate weapon, called The Genesis device.  Genesis, as one would expect, can create life (so it seems) from inanimate matter, or, as Kahn seems intuitively to know, can replace (i.e. destroy)life where it may be found.  Coincidently, this project was created by genius Dr. Carol Marcus, who happens to be the mother of Kirk's now-adult and terribly embittered son.
Combat of course ensues (though not between the two primary antagonists).  They battle through space, and via starships chase one another through the galaxy in scenes reminiscent of classic World War Two submarine movies.  The climactic battle comes and then goes, with yet one more crisis supplanting the fight between these two.
As another said, this was the characterization for which true fanatics as well as casual fans were waiting.  A brilliantly written script indicates an incredible amount of work. The quotes transform the obsessed Kahn, turning him back several centuries into an fanatical  Captain Ahab, as he seeks to deliver the coup de grace to Kirk and his crew just as Ahab did the white whale.
The re-introduction of characters familiar and beloved for a series no one ever expected to be as enduring as it was.  Two hours of action.  Humor, suspense and amazing effects.  Tons of special features on the special  DVD edition.  Hard to beat this one!",1029110400,,2092,4.951289398280802

246611,5,6300213803,"I know that ""director's editions"" of films are really nothing more than a clever ploy to get you to buy the same [darn] film over and over again (case in point: I have all of the Trek films on both VHS and DVD already), but I just couldn't contain myself when I heard the ""director's edition"" of _Wrath of Khan_ was coming out. This version of _Khan_ clears up the whole question of Scotty's concern for ""Engineer's Mate, Peter Preston"" (what: I'm the only person who was bothered by it!?) with extra footage that was left out of the theatrical release: Peter was Scotty's sister's youngest son (which makes him Scotty's nephew, right?)!
The addition of more personal loss involving someone besides Spock or Kirk or McCoy (even though it is quickly forgotten among Kirk's family issues) makes the series come even more alive for me than before (and also adds some poignancy to Scotty's sympathetic distance in III when David is killed by those ""Klingon bastards."")
Even though the ""director's edition"" only amounts to a few extra minutes of (all-be-it important) dialogue, when teamed with Michael Okuda's text commentary (funny and insightful ""Trek nerd stuff"" if ever I've read it!) and the second disc's wonderful interviews and material surrounding the ascendency of Khan in our imaginations, it becomes well worth the money.

This is a great version.  Interestingly, only about 5 minutes of footage were re-included (which somehow made it onto the TV version but never the feature film) and they don't change anything, they simply add a little more spice to some scenes and clear up the reason for the interest in that one particular young engineer who died after the attack.
One great thing however was the Director's commentary of the film.  Often these tend to lag a bit for me, they get these old actors and directors who are struggling to remember who they were playing or what they were trying to say 30 years ago and many of them simply sound like they're doing it for the money.  Nick Meyer entertains throughout, telling stories about the shoot, the actors, the lore of Star Trek, and his philosophy of directing as if he just made the movie.  His insights are sharp and to me actually contributed much to the film.  And for those of you who are worried that he just goes on and on, don't.  Meyer seems to pause at all the right times to just let us soak in the film for a moment before going back to his discussion.  Worth it for this alone (I can hardly wait for the director's edition of Star Trek VI, Meyers other Star Trek film)!
So if you are the sort who involuntarily scream ""KHAN"" at people who annoy you, you must get this version of the film!  And if you don't understand what I just said with that last sentence then just pass it by.",1029110400,,1621,4.305921052631579
246613,5,6300213803,"The most important Star Trek film to own on any media.  The one that sums up Star Trek in 2 hours.  This DVD edition just kicks it up a few hundred notches.
As a 2nd generation Star Trek fan, I was just a small child when Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan was originally released.  Of course I enjoyed the battle scenes (the most of any Star Trek movie) and stuff blowing up and raising the shields, blah blah blah.  I was shocked when Spock died at the end and of course being so young had not understood the whole idea of ""anything can happen ... just wait for the sequel.""
When I grew up, I bought the original movie VHS set that originally included the first five motion pictures.  Of course ""Khan"" was the one I kept digging out and watching again and again.
After the Next Generation had their success both on television and on the big screen, I admit I hadn't watched this movie in years ... until this DVD came out.
Not only is the audio cleaned up, the video excellent and several scenes added in (it's a Director's Edition of course) but it has several hours of additional interviews and other goodies.  Even if you don't see the need to repurchase this movie as you have it on VHS, I would buy it anyway just for that.
Just being told that several cast members didn't even want to make another movie after the first one but made this one anyway is a tribute to how good the project was/is.  It wasn't about money.  It was about making something they could believe in.
I never understood the significance of ""Khan"" on every future Star Trek project until I watched this DVD.  It indeed is amazing how it nearly resurrected Star Trek and set the tone for now 2 decades of Star Trek goodness.
So not only is it the coolest, most action packed of all Star Trek movies but it has stood the test of time, as it included everything we started watching Star Trek in the first place for.
If you're a Star Trek fan, go buy it NOW.  If you're not a Star Trek fan and never understood why so many people think it's such a big deal, buy it anyway.  If you rent it first, you'll just be wasting your money.

246674,5,6300213803,"If you're a Star Trek fan, you're probably familiar with the Even Number rule. That Trek films with even numbers (II, IV, VI and First Contact) are better than the odd-numbered films. Well, I don't think the quality of the film has anything to do with the numbering.
  This movie has things that few other Trek films do. First, a great villain. Khan is smart, deadly and insane. He's a superbly threatening foe. Kirk has to work hard to defeat him, and even then there's a terrible price to pay.
  The first Star Trek film ended with the line ""The Human Adventure is just beginning."" And this is the most human of the Trek films. Kirk has to come to terms with his age, his past mistakes and death. There's a very strong focus on the characters. And the Spock/McCoy banter has never been better.
  And with the terraforming Genesis device, there's a scientific element that's pretty interesting. Mind you, it's only a minor part of the film, but still it's always nice to see a bit of science in Trek.
  The Director's Edition DVD restores a few minutes of footage which doesn't hurt the film, but I think helps it more in theory than practice. I do like the added element of Preston being Scotty's nephew.
  As for extras, there's a philosophical commentary track by director Nicholas Meyer, a geeky text commentary by Mike Okuda, some great interviews about the making of the film (isn't Shatner a delightful egotist?), archival interviews, and a filler doc on some fans turned Trek novelists. All in all, a nice assortment of features.

As the crew of the Enterprise face an uncertain future together and career-wise, they find out about an even bigger problem than all of that.  An old enemy, a former tyrannt named Khan, has managed to launch an attack against the Enterprise during a rather routine training voyage with a crew of cadets.  What follows is a tense cat-and-mouse game between two adversaries that will ultimately end in sacrifice and death.  Setting the seeds for future installments of the series, ""Khan"" still works as a solid piece of sci-fi entertainment.

Finally, here it is, with all the dialogue reincorporated into it, even if it doesn't have the alternating camera shots between Kirk and Saavik's faces in the turbolift.  It's quite pleasing.  Now, all we need is for the respective companies to put the deleted scenes from movies like ""Firebirds"" back into them on their own DVD releases.",1028592000,,589,4.86
246680,5,6300213803,"""The Wrath of Kahn"" is by far one of the best ""Star Trek"" films ever made.
The film begins at Star Fleet Academy where a young Vulcan officer, Lt. Saavik, undergoes the no-win ""Kobiyashi Maru"" test. As expected, she fails the test, but learns (over the course of the film) the meaning of the test. She also finds out that Kirk is the only Star Fleet graduate that ever won the no-win scenario.
The film progresses to the planet Seti-Alpha 6 (or so they thought) where Chekov & Capt. Terrell from the starship Reliant are investigating the possibility of using the planet for the ""Genesis Project"". To their dismay, they find that they are on the wrong planet when they come across the survivors of the genetically-enhanced super-humans who had been marooned there by Kirk years earlier. Their leader, Khan Noonien Singh, wants revenge on Kirk.
Kahn and his followers capture the starship Reliant so that Kahn can find and destory Kirk. Kahn also wants all information and materials for the ""Genesis Project"". He attacks the space station whose commander was a former lover of Kirk--Dr. Carol Marcus. Their son, Dr. David Marcus, is also involved.
The U.S.S. Enterprise, under the command of Capt. Spock, is on a training mission. When the space station is attacked, it is the closest starship to the station. Admiral Kirk assumes command to find out who attacked the space station. When he arrives, he is in for a very big surprise!
The fighting between Kirk and Kahn is intense and results in the death of a very major ""Star Trek"" character.
This film is a must have for any ""Star Trek"" fan!
The second DVD included with the Director's Cut contains interviews with original cast members (Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley) as well as Gene Roddenberry and other people that contributed directly to the Star Trek's on-going legacy.  Again, it's a very worthwhile item that any Star Trek fan will enjoy having for years to come!",1028592000,,1915,4.803030303030303

246682,5,6300213803,"The Wrath of Khan is, thus far, the single best movie viewing experience of my life.  It did everything right.  Since the characters were ones I (and everyone else) were familiar with it could get right into the story, no tedious introductions, even Savak fits in seemlessly to the overall story.
And the story is so clean, so basic.  Revenge, madmen, old sins coming back to haunt you.  It was a giant tale, with giant characters.  At twelve years old I was astounded.  The music was incredible, the interactions were incredible, and the special effects were phenomonal.
It was a great movie going experience because I was still young and was niave enough to wonder, not how the good guys would escape, but IF they would escape.  And what a price they pay for their victory.  Radiation poisoning, Scotty keeping complete panic from overtaking the engineering section one minute before caving in himself the next.  Khan holding all the cards, only to have them slip away.  A federation captian gnawing at a communicator like an animal!  Enterprise cremmembers burning to death!
Wow.
Other movie experiences have come close.  The opening scene of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the big 'waking up' scene in THE MATRIX, the final gun battle in JOHNNY HANDSOME, but no movie has ever been as cool, consistant, and complete, start to finish, as WRATH OF KHAN.",1028160000,,1345,4.850877192982456
246683,5,6300213803,The Wrath of khan is definetly one of the best Star Trek movies to date.  Bringing back Khan and adding several different movie themes was a great idea.  The space battle at the end is marvalous not a Star Wars knock off of any kind.  The story and action all together make this a great Star Trek movie.,1028073600,,303,4.189655172413793
246723,5,6300213803,"I just bought this DVD..., and the verdict is in: It's a blast!!!
THE MOVIE: Certanily one of the best Star Trek movies. Although the main plot about revenge is a bit too basic, the sub-plots, including the addition of Kirk's ex-wife and son, makes the movie better. The action is well paced and the special effects are marevelous. Also, the ""expanded director's edition"" featured on this DVD adds about 5 extra minutes to the movie. The added footage does little to help the plot, but does a great deal to flesh out more of the minor characters, such as Kirk's son and Lt. Saavik. Also, the last 15 minutes of the film (some added dialogue was put in there to have a little bit more emotional impact at the end of the film) made me jump the grade of the film from a ""B"" to an ""A+.""
THE DVD: In addition to having a crisp, clear picture transfer of the film with oustanding sound, the first disc has a nice audio commentary from the director and an even nicer text commentary from Michael Okuda, co-author of the Star Trek Encyclopedia. (That guy knows EVERY SINGLE LITTLE DETAIL THAT OTHER PEOPLE WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW A THING ABOUT that regards to Star Trek.) The second disc contains the following:
1) The Captain's Log: A 27-minute documentary featuring brand new interviews with Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner, director Nicholas Meyer, Ricardo Montalban, and others. They talk about how they originally intended to put the film together, how they eventually ended up completing that task, and other things.
2) Designing Khan: A 23-minute documentary that features interviews with director Nicholas Meyers, the costume designer, and the production designer. They discuss the transitions they made in costume and production design from the ST:TMP to ST2:TWOK.
3) Visual Effects: An 18-minute featurette that has interviews with the FX crew. They explain how they executed and completed the FX shots. (Big surprise there)
4) The Star Trek Universe: A 28-minute documetary that features interviews with two Star Trek novel writers. They discuss how they fill in the gaps between the movies with their books and where they get their ideas.
5) Original Interviews: Basically 10 minutes of interviews (from 1982) featuring William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Ricardo Montalban, and Deforest Kelley.
6) Archives: The archives feature 10 original storyboard sequences. (That sure beats the storyboard archives on the ST:TMP DVD, which features a mere 3 storyboard sequences.) There is also a thatrical trailer.
So, there you have it. A great movie with a packed DVD equals a great purchase. Buy as soon as possible.
1982; 116 minutes; Rated PG for mild obscenity, some sequences of sc-fi action/violence, and brief shots of the aftermaths of brutal murders.

246724,5,6300213803,"Just in time for the films 20th anniversary, Paramount Pictures has released the Directors Edition of ""Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan"" in a two-disc set. The film picks up the story of the legendary crew of the Enterprise as they begin to prepare a new crew to crew the ship for its continued mission of exploration.
Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), is overseeing his good friend, Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy), training of the new crew, while secretly pining over becoming an administrator who is stuck flying a desk rather than exploring the cosmos. As Kirk, Spock, and the veteran crew of the Enterprise prepare for what may be their last mission with one another, the veteran crew views the pending training cruise as a nostalgic but bittersweet event that will culminate their historic careers with one another before they head off to other assignments in Starfleet.
Fate however has different plans, as the training mission soon becomes a life and death struggle that will test the mettle of the new crew, and drive Kirk to the depths of personal turmoil and pain. Unbeknownst to Kirk and his crew, the genetically enhanced Khan, (Ricardo Montalban), has escaped from the exile Kirk assigned him, and is determined to seek revenge on Kirk at all costs. As if this is not problem enough, Kirks ex-lover Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch), comes back into his life as she believes Kirk is taking away her life's work; a project named Genesis that reanimates life in dead planets and allows for desolate planets to be terraformed in less than a day. The truth is that Khan has learned of the plan and uses the project as a chance to lure Kirk to the research station so that he may steal the project and exact his deadly vengeance on Kirk. What follows is a deadly game of cat and mouse as Kirk and Khan square off in a series of battles that force Kirk to use every ounce of his experience to save his ship and crew. The supporting cast is great and fans will note Kirstie Alley in an early role as Lt Saavik and the late Merritt Butrick is solid as Kirk's estranged son David. The directing of then second time director Nicholas Myers is solid and his commentaries on the films soundtrack are very informative and insightful. The effects from ILM are first rate and the pacing of the film is easily the best of any Trek outing as the skillful mix of action, humor, and emotion makes this not only the most diverse of the Trek films but also the most in-depth and human. This is a thinking mans Trek as you do not have to be a fan of the series to appreciate this film. The mature themes presented of aging, love, loss, and revenge lead to elements of good drama and Myers gets easily the best performance of Shatner's tenure as Kirk from the role, as Kirk is still the strong leader that fans have known, but we see a frail side to him, and learn of the sadness and sacrifices that eat at him, as well as his struggle to balance the ramifications of decisions he made years ago. The second disc is stuffed with features and interviews including Deforest Kelley (McCoy), Shatner, Nimoy, and Montalban as well as Director Myers, Producer Harve Bennett, and the writers all make this a collection well worth owning.
Star Trek II is widely regarded by fans as the best film in the series and with this fantastic collection, the best just got better.

246725,5,6300213803,"FINALLY, THIS FILM GETS THE DVD TREATMENT IS DESERVES!!!!!!!!!!As an avid lover of sci-fi classic films, I give this one of my all-time highest ratings. I saw this film on HBO when I was about 6 years old, and although I had no idea what ""Star Trek"" was, I instanly was drawn into the complex and emotional world that is the ""Wrath of Khan."" For those of you who don't follow ""Star Trek,"" this is the perfect starting point. I would not recommend the first film for those unaware of the genre. This film packs it all: scf-fi, action, humor, drama and horrendous tragedy. The plot centers around the not-so-nice villian Khan Noonan Sing(SP?) who wants nothing more than to blow James T. Kirk into space dust. To do so, Khan initiates one of the greatest cat & mouse games ever caught on film. A science vessel, the U.S.S. Relient comes across the barren planet City Alpha 6 to begin research on the testing of a new Starfleet device that can make planets out of space rock. Unfortunately, they stumble across Khan, and are subjected to one of the coolest forms of torture that I have ever seen in a sci-fi film. Khan then steals the Relient and the Genesis device bent on being naughty.  The crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise, which is on a training voyage, is dispatched to investigate, only to run into Khan and his new armed-to-the-teeth starship. And so begins the fantastic space battles and witty one-up manship that is the relationship of Kirk & Khan. The entire Mutara Nebulla sequence ranks second, only to the incredible Battle of Hoth in ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" among my all-time favorite sci-fi movie moments. ""Star Trek"" or not, this film is one of Hollywood's best space operas and ranks with such films as ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Blade Runner,"" and ""Tron"" as being one of the 1980's best sci-fi films.
Interesting side note: This film is actually just act one of a great 3 part sci-fi saga that continues the same story line in ""Star Trek III,"" and ""Star Trek IV."" These three films can be viewed back to back much like the original ""Star Wars"" films. Here's hoping that ""Search For Spock"" and ""Voayge Home"" get the ole 'Director's Cut' treatment as well!!!!!

Digging Khan Singh out of the classic Trek catacombs was a masterstroke, and Ricardo Montalban's performance as the revenge-crazed renegade is splendid.  Many fans also remember this film as Kirstie Alley's debut feature, and with good reason--her Saavik is an enchanting combination of elfin beauty and barely restrained Romulan fire.  Naturally, the cast of Trek familiars all perform admirably, and the special effects bring the myriad fantasy sequences (including alien brain eels and brilliant starship duels) to pyrotechnic reality, all the more effective because they highlight so many dramatic characterizations.  And James Horner's score is the best of any Trek film so far.  Parallel to the main revenge plot are two well-handled subtexts:  age and mortality.  On top of it all, Captain Kirk is reunited with an old flame and meets the son he has never known, only to suffer the heart-wrenching loss of his closest friend.  Well-conceived, written, and directed, Star Trek II is a relentlessly suspenseful and engaging sci-fi extravaganza, and clearly the standard against which all other Star Trek features must be measured.",1025827200,2,1313,5.4236453201970445

246730,5,6300213803,"Movie Review:
After all these years, this is still the strongest of the Trek movies.  A solid story, a strong villain, and the return of that ""Trekish"" atmosphere between the regulars that was so absent in the first film.  Underneath it all, the theme of age is woven, not as an overall driving force but as a texture.
The effects look OK; they've aged about as well as most early 80's SF effects have.  The action sequences are good and never run too long, and the subplots fit in well.  The movie is tight and does not feel too long, unlike the first which could stand to lose 45 minutes or so.  And I suppose I am the only one who likes the James Horner music, but I think it fits PERFECTLY.
Even though Shatner and Montalbon drift over the top at times, we don't care because by then we're wrapped up in the adventure.  That the drama of the ending -- which was very well done -- is undone by the next movie is not this movie's fault.  This movie is better standalone than paired with its weak successor, and the originator of the even-numbered-good odd-numbered-bad rule of Trek films that persists to this day.  Definitely a winner.

It's horrible.  A lousy transfer, and no extras at all beyond a cruddy trailer.  There's a new ""Director's Edition"" coming out soon, and it should be better.  Hold out for that.",1024272000,2,1328,4.446280991735537

Filled with action, adventure and darma. All perfomances, even William Statner's were incredible. Spock and McCoy were finally Spock and McCoy. The Enterprise finally had color and lights and the unforms were more space fairing then the pajamas in the first one.
Nicholas Meyer, who I met shortly after this production in the 80's, described this as an adventure will characters moving the story and drama not the special effects. There's energy, humor, drama and even death.
The Genesis Device proves to be an icon for the whole underling story. And, as far as special effects go, in 1982 - they were the best. Visual candy for the eye.
Cudos to the supporting cast (espeically Deforest ""McCoy"" Kelly and James ""Scotty"" Doohan) and of corse Ricardo ""Kahn"" Mauntalban - there's an actors, actor. Even the Goodbye scene for Shatner and Nimoy (Spock) was heartfelt and real.

Star Trek II has been considered by Star Trek fans to be one of the best Star Trek films ever.  However, I'm impartial to Star Trek VI myself.  But that being said, Star Trek II had some very memorable scenes and plot lines.  The basic plot is a genetically enhanced superhuman from the late 20th Century has been found after exile from the original Star Trek episode ""Space Seed"" by the name of Khan.  He has commondeered the Federation Miranda-class starship Reliant and steals a new Federation experiment known as the Genesis Torpedo.  The Genesis Torpedo is a device that can terraform a dead planet into a living and breathing planet.  However his ultimate mission is to exact revenge against Cpt. (now Admiral) James T. Kirk for abandoning him on the planet Ceti Alpha V.  Khan pursues Kirk and the Enterprise around the system in some very exciting ship to ship combat akin to 18th Century naval warfare.  The battle ends in a climatic battle in the Mutara Nebula.  However when the battle ends, the Genesis Torpedo ignites and creates a planet out of the nebula.  Something that it wasn't supposed to be able to do.  And then we see the result of that in Star Trek III.
Nicholas Meyer was given the reigns of Star Trek II, and he wanted to transform the look of the Star Trek franchise.  Instead of the pajama style uniforms from TMP, he gave them Red Jackets with an open-fly type collar and Black Trousers and Boots.  This style of uniform remained with the series all the way through Star Trek The Next Generation in the episode ""Cause and Effect"" where the Enterprise D encounters an old Miranda class ship from Kirk's time.
But as for future Star Trek films in Director's Editions, Star Trek III is supposedly soon to follow.  Possibily before the end of the year, however I wouldn't hold my breath, being that it's taken almost a year to get this one out after TMP:DE.",1021680000,3,3100,4.909961685823755

In Star Trek II, the remains of Botany Bay are found on a desolate planet, Ceti Alpha V, along with its contents....Khan and his fellow comrades.  Khan takes control of a Miranda-class cruiser called the USS Reliant.  He uses this cruiser to exact revenge upon Admiral Kirk who had left the Botany Bay abandoned on Ceti Alpha V.  He pursues the Enterprise to a Science Station called Regula One of which them a battle ensues.  Later the battle carries into a nebula, the Mutaris Nebula, in which sensors and weapons locks are useless.

It is a very well-done film from good acting, to great action and special effects, to the whole idea of bringing back one of Trek's greatest villains, Khan Noonian Singh.  There is always something occuring in this movie that will keep you on your toes, from Kirk dealing with the unexpected return of his old nemesis, Khan, the battle scenes between the Enterprise and the Reliant, the quarreling over a new experiment- the genesis device (which can turn a desloate moon into a pradise), to the surprising death of Spock that left fans in awe at the theaters.

246768,5,6300213803,"Hailed by many as one of the best Star Trek movies, if not THE best one, ""Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan"" contains all the elements that made the series so successful. While most Star Trek feature films, especially the latest ones, appear like over-length episodes of the series, ""The Wrath Of Khan"" has qualities that put it in a league of its own in the overall universe of the series. With high production values, a stunning look and a great script, this movie contains everything a fan's heart could ask for.

Some time has passed since we last visited the Federation starship U.S.S. Enterprise and the familiar assembly of faces. James T. Kirk( William Shatner) has been promoted to Admiral and is facing a serious midlife crisis. He is no longer serving active duty, while Spock (Leonard Nimoy) is coaching trainees in simulations and small missions on the Enterprise. One day Kirk is coming on board the U.S.S. Enterprise for an inspection where he meets most of the original crew members, as well as an array of new faces.
In the meanwhile Checkov (Walter Koenig) is working on another mission, supporting a scientific project called ""Genesis."" On the outlook for a perfect planet to test Genesis, he and his ship end up on Ceti Alpha V by mistake, a prison planet, and before they realize their mistake, Kirk's nemesis Khan and his exiled band of genetic supermen take over the crew and ship. After all these years on the desolate planet, Khan has only one burning desire - to kill Kirk and to destroy the Enterprise. He forges a plan and then lures Kirk and his crew of trainees into a deadly trap.

""Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan"" is an energetic movie that contains a number of great twists along the way and a surprise ending. With high production values and a scope that feels larger than the stories told in the TV episodes, this is one of the few feature film installments in the franchise that actually had to be realized as a feature film in order to be adequately told.

While we find our usual suspects in the film in their well-known parts, it is noticeable that especially William Shatner blooms under the direction of Nicholas Meyer. Much less over-acting than in the TV series or the first Star Trek motion picture, for the first time we see his character Kirk as a real human being. With subtle nuances and facets, Shatner manages to finally bring to life Kirk in a manner that is realistic and down-to-earth. But in the face of such a formidable adversary as Khan, he'd better be. Played by Ricardo Montalban, Khan is evil to the bone and his stature commands respect in every single shot that we see him in. His voice, his mannerisms steal the show and like the bad guys in the Bond movies, Khan is the catalyst for this movie that ultimately makes it such a memorable film.

Paramount Home Video's release of ""Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan"" is a beautiful version of the movie. Presented in a 16x9 enhanced widescreen transfer that is highly detailed, the film is clean and mostly without blemishes, which is a significant improvement over the other, spotty video versions that have been released in the past. Boldly colorful the transfer conjures up images of galaxies far beyond that are both beautiful and lethal. Color delineation is very good, reproducing even the most subtle hues without distortion or over-saturation. Scenes like the showdown in the Nebula are gorgeous to look at with its vibrant tinges and fine hues. The transfer also has a very good black level, producing deep shadows that never lose their definition. Always pronounced, yet naturally rendered, the highlights in the image create a distinctive look for the film that is very different from the look of the series, yet entirely authentic and true to the series' original intentions. Together with the highly detailed production design that is perfectly reproduced in this anamorphic transfer, the video presentation on this DVD leaves a good impression.

The DVD also contains a 5.1 channel Dolby Digital audio track that has been created from the original 6-channel elements of the film. However, the mix is not very aggressive and makes only infrequently real use of the surround channels. There are a number of scenes during which sound effects are integrated to make use of the spatial possibilities of the discrete surround channels, but for the most part, surround usage is limited to low-level ambient effects and early reflections of the score, to give the music more depth. The low end is unexaggerated and the LFE channel is engaged only on occasion.

Dialogues are generally understandable, carefully balanced with the overall sound field, but the original dialogue recordings are sometimes a bit muddy and overly ambient. A lot of ADR produced dialogue has been edited into the film and the differences in quality are extremely noticeable in this film, as the ADR elements are much clearer and virtually free of the ambient reverberations and resonance that plague the live recorded dialogues. Hover, the age of the elements is audible, especially in the dialogues, as the frequency response is narrow, giving the dialogues a rather harsh quality that sounds unnatural at times.

This is a beautiful presentation of the movie on this DVD, although it also shows clearly the weaknesses and limitations of the movie's original production - which have nothing to do with the DVD presentation. Fortunately the film itself is so engrossing and captivating that for the most part you won't even notice them, as you are absorbed in the fantastic story, the dramatic development and the action packed battles. To me, ""Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan"" is one of the best feature films from the Star Trek series, and it was great to re-experience it after all these years on this great DVD.

The special effects and costuming neither overwhelmed the film (as in Star Trek 1) nor were they lacking in any way.  The acting was subdued when it needed to be, and over the top (Khan) when it had to be. It even managed to avoid being cutesy or self-conscious the way later Treks seemed to be.

246771,5,6300213803,"Seinfeld was right! While the first Trek movie, IMNSHO, was underrated for leading the others in sci-fi value, this first sequel tops in sheer entertainment. In ""Khan"", Kirk must confront his most implacable adversary - the evil Khan Nonnian Singh. A product of late 20th century eugenics, Khan and his followers briefly seized unparalleled power in our times, only to vanish before being defeated. Years later (on the episode ""Space Seed"") Khan and his followers were found by the crew of the USS Enterprise in a derelict vessel in suspended animation. Rather than kill Khan after he tries to seize the Enterprise, Kirk maroons him and his followers on Ceti Alpha V (big mistake) and forgets about him. Years later, surveying supposedly lifeless worlds as part of a secret Starfleet experiment, Commander Checkov accidentally lands on Khan's world, thinking it to be his neighbor Ceti Alpha VI. (The real Ceti Alpha VI exploded shortly after Khan's arrival on the neighboring world; the cataclysm turned his new home planet into virtually uninhabitable sand-ball; with the planet's only other surviving life-forms being large parasitic insects that eat their way through the brains of Khan's men, Khan himself has become quite ornery in his old age, and no-less bitter at Captain Kirk.) With his brilliance and ambition (and some of those bugs), Khan and company seize Checkov's ship and are free to wreak havoc on the galaxy. Two things hold Khan back - discovery that Checkov's mission involved an invention called ""Genesis"", a revolutionary device with a potentially dark side; but it is the possibility of revenge against Captain Kirk that keep shim from simply running. Meanwhile, Kirk has no command, merely supervises other cadets while the Enterprise is under command of (now Captain) Spock. On a training run with Kirk merely ""observing"", the Enterprise is ambushed by Khan and, largely crewed by cadets, nearly devastated. Thus begins a series of interstellar battles between the wounded Enterprise and Khan's renegade starship, partly over Genesis, but mostly over revenge. Complicating things for Kirk are the green crew, but also the presence of Genesis's developers, Carole Marcus and her son David - an old flame and the son they almost shared. Thinking Kirk responsible for an attack by Khan, and not quite big on military types in general, David becomes almost as vindictive towards Kirk as Khan.
This flick will be 20 years old this summer, and it's one more sign that Classic Trek endures over that ""Next Generation"" stuff. In every way, this entry is a gem in the Trek franchise - the special effects (now handled by ILM) are gorgeous, mixing with a great soundtrack by James Horner, and an underappreciated script that's light years above the newer brands of Trek. The characters lightly parody themselves - they're virtually retirees, too old to gallivant across space (but wisely not letting them come across as too friendly either). The script keeps to a few set themes (you're only as old as you feel; nobody dies if you can remember them; it's better to have hope for the future than harbor a thirst for revenge; an impossible challenge is something everybody must face; ""Moby Dick"" was a really cool book) frequently adding surprises. This film, more than the others, contributed to Trek's lore - the Kobayashi Maru; Romulan ale; starship prefix codes - with mixed results. (Kirk uses prefix codes on Khan's ship to briefly weaken it; though acknowledging it was a small trick rather than a master strategy he can feel proud of, latter incarnations of Trek have characters patting themselves on the back for relying on that trick). There's also a climactic space battle set within a nebula (a sort of planet-sized lightning cloud in space) that's a nod to a climactic submarine battle in ""Run Silent, Run Deep"".  (That film was directed by Robert Wise who helmned the first Trek movie).  Even if you think the effects (circa 1982) are dated, you'll still get a top-notch script full of great lines. Kirk and McCoy, finding Doctor Marcus's space station deserted, opt to use her transporter to beam towards its last used destination, thinking that they are following the Doctor's trail. ""What if they went nowehere?"" McCoy asks. Kirk answers ""Then this will be your chance to get away from it all."" This flick is your chance to get away from all that tired ""Next Generation"" Trek, with its reliance on techno-babble and anglo-accents.",1013904000,,4461,5.01889338731444

As Kirk says to his trainees, ""We have been though death and life together."" You will go through the range of emotions while viewing this movie. And if you fallow up this film with a healthy dose of ""Star Trek III the Search for Spock"" the story will come full circle. Space opera at its' very best.",1013817600,,569,4.419047619047619
246773,2,6300213803,"What a disappointment! I like the first Star Trek series, so I was favorably disposed to like this film.  Nonetheless, this movie is too self-conscious and cutesy, exaggerating all of the characters' traits to the point of caricature. (Scotty even plays the bagpipes in one scene -- after all, he's Scottish!) The dialog is stiff and unconvincing when it tries to recreate the magic of the old crew being together by having the predictable fight between Bones and Spock, the predictable medical advice by Bones to Kirk, etc. Even worse, one almost feels sorry for the actors when they have to deliver such lines such as, ""There's an old Klingon saying that...."" or ""Mmmm, is that Romulan wine?"" all the while wearing their absurd-looking costumes. (The TV series' costumes look better than the film's late 70s / early 80s ""space age"" sensibility.)
William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban compete for the ""campiest performance of the year"" Oscar. The acting of most of the rest of the old Star Trek crew is so bad that you can see why they never could establish acting careers outside of the Star Trek franchise. Checkov's entranced episodes are particularly laughable. About the only crew member who makes it out with his dignity intact is Leonard Nimoy.
Speaking of Spock, the film can't even come by its pathos honestly. After trying to wring emotion out of his ""death"" in this movie, he ends up returning alive in subsequent films.
The plot is rather unsuspenseful and uninteresting, without any swashbuckling pizzaz. It's no wonder that one person watching the film with me fell asleep.
At a technical level, the film is merely competent, with average special effects for the time and uninspired cinemaphotography. The musical score unsuccessfully reaches for grandeur.

Nick Meyer's directorial takeover from Robert Wise (ST:TMP), was a good choice since Meyer likes to lay back on his classic-story roots. He portrays the characters, for the first time, as human...not forever youthful heroes. The Kirk-Khan rivalry take the vengeance scenario to new heights as past and present come together. ST II is about the acceptance of loss, the past that comes full circle, and the bystanding people who get caught in the middle.

246798,5,6300213803,"This entry in the TREK film series is basically a sequel to an episode of the classic STAR TREK TV series entitled ""Space Seed."" In that episode, a group of genetically engineered supermen and superwomen are unwittingly awakened from their cryogenic deep-sleep by Captain Kirk and crew, after which a struggle for control of the Enterprise ensues.  Kirk and company emerge as victors, of course, but the genetic superfolks are allowed to live in exile on a harsh-but-habitable out-of-the-way planet.
In this feature-length sequel, Ricardo Montalban (of FANTASY ISLAND fame) is wonderfully over-the-top as he reprises the role of Captain Kirk's nemesis Khan Noonien Singh, leader of the aforementioned genetically superior exiles.  Having found a way off the prison planet, Khan leads his fellows on a quest to exact revenge on those who were responsible for their banishment--namely, Kirk and crew.
Arguably one of the best of the TREK flicks, the story is tight and exciting, the special FX are top-notch, and the acting is excellent.  (One notable performance is that of actress Kirstie Alley, who here makes her film debut as a Vulcan Starfleet officer.)  It's true that die-hard Trekkers will have fun picking apart some of the TREK continuity errors--e.g., why does Chekov recognize Kahn when the Chekov character was not yet a part of the show in the original episode?--but casual TREK fans and aficionados alike will find this entry both entertaining and ""genetically superior"" to the previous TREK film (i.e., STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE).",1009670400,4,1549,5.208835341365462

246867,4,6300213803,"Star Trek has great potential to be stuck in the hokey-schlok-weird-alien-meets-handsome-human-explorer rut.  Although the franchise still occasionally visits this pit, more often than not it avoids the fall.  Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan works the best out of all the classic Trek movies (ending with The Undiscovered Country) because of its superior story and action, its special effects (which still look pretty good today) and direction.  Wrath of Khan also caters two strengths Star Trek that have made the franchise so enduring: character and theme.  There are universal themes throughout the movie that make this sci-fi world applicable to our own; aging, facing and confronting death, the value of life, etc.  The themes are  subtly woven into the text and character interaction so that they're not didactic bombardment, but rather thoughts to be examined later.  Another great part of this movie is that this was the first time that you saw your favorite Trek characters and its beloved ship actually wounded to a severe extent, physically and emotionally, by an unexpected, malevolent force.  The stakes had never been this high before.  This was a true crises and its wonderful to see the shock, the response, and the ultimate price.  This review has a 4.5 star rating actually, and the only downgrade is for the low, occasionally rotten, acting.  Most of the time the cast sticks to their roles admirably, but some lines (particularly by Shatner and Montalban) are either grossly underdone or laughably overdone.  Nevertheless, the script (by long-time Trek writer Harve Bennett) and solid direction of Nicholas Meyer move the story at just the right pace.  Plus, they manage to create a truly honest, tender moment between Kirk (Shatner) and his son, David.  With a notoriously over the top actor like Shatner, creating that kind of moment is a true accomplishment.  Don't let the acting fool you.

The characters had matured and you felt genuine reactions to thier trials.
Ricardo's Kahn was perfect, expanding on his role from 'Space Seed' to the extent that we saw someone who felt a little less superior after losing his wife and living with both failure and the desire for revenge for so long. This is a villian who didn't just want Kirk dead; he wanted him to suffer.

The return of series' villain Khan Noonian Singh, consumed by his obsession to exact revenge on Admiral Kirk for the death of his wife, resulted in a TREK that was bolder and more dramatic than ever before, (or since -- take note, Rick Berman!) Key to the rebirth was the hiring of director Nicholas Meyer, an admitted novice to the STAR TREK phenomenon who nonetheless drew an astounding, best-ever performance from Shatner and created a taut, tightly-paced adventure in the tradition of the series' finest episodes. As usual, DeForest Kelley steals scene after scene.
From the very beginning, Paramount has lead the charge in packing their DVD's with supplementary materials, and this disc doesn't disappoint. For starters, there are two VERY cool behind-the-scenes documentaries: STAR TREK: RECAPTURING THE MAGIC explores the effort that went into ensuring the film FELT like STAR TREK, while the second documentary, IKE EISENMANN: FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN TO THE MILKY WAY, examines in exhausting detail how the actor went from child star at Disney to his tour of duty aboard the Enterprise in KHAN. Both shorts are interesting and informative, and above all, fun. But the studio didn't stop there; in addition to the documentaries, we get a pristine transfer of the film's original theatrical trailer, a generous collection of TV spots, and a rare, seldom seen teaser trailer created expressly for the Polish market. But the real jewel of the extras is the inclusion of an entire taping of The Merv Griffin Show from 1982 featuring Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley, just prior to the release of the film. That alone would have been sufficient to make the disc a must-buy, but Paramount ups the ante by giving us not one, not two, but 25 audio commentaries!!!

Here, the Enterprise is a training vessel for new cadets with Mr. Spock as their captain/teacher. Captain now Admiral Kirk is merely along for the ride when news reaches them that a new threat is underway, and the fledging crew is the only Starfleet ship in the vicinity. Plenty of drama as the innocents and the Old Pros take on danger.
""Wrath of Khan"" succeeded where ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" had failed to capture the hearts of Trek fans, and ensured the dynasty of films to follow.
There's a few things I like about this film: 1. Ricardo Montalban as Khan. RM reprises his TV series episode role as Khan, an evil genius, the leader of superhuman, superstrength musclemen. He used to be smug, but since our last encounter, he has become embittered and extremely hell-bent on vengeance against Kirk personally. Of course, he's willing to destroy humanity if that stands in his way too.
2. The subplot about getting older. This theme got touched on again in ""ST: Insurrection"", but it is far better treated here. That's because there is no remedy for it, except ultimate resignation to the fact, as we see here. So, Kirk in ""WofK"" must come to terms with mortality in a very special way. By the way, the movie outdoes the show here, because there is no such thing as ""dead but brought back to life"" which always removed dramatic tension in the series. Here, reality is reality. ""WofK"" would not be out of place as a tool in bereavement groups, because we see that like in the epic of Gilgamesh, even heroes cannot control life and death. When I saw as a college student this the day it premiered in NYC , I actually cried at the end! Wouldn't do that for many movies, and none of the ST movies to follow.

The actors ages are acknowledged and William Shatner gives a good performance. The film starts with a young officer commanding the Enterprise to rescue a ship on the Klingon side of the neutral zone, which is not to be crossed. The Enterprise is defeated by the Klingons, then we learn it is a simulated exercise. The young officer is Lt. Saavik (Kirsty Alley), a Vulcan. Admiral Kirk (Shatner) is the only person to win this no-win scenario. The Enterprise launches as a training cruise for new officers, with Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy) in command. The starship Reliant is searching for suitable lifeless planet for the Genesis Project, a device that creates life from lifelessness. They find a planet with only small life signs. Captain Terrell (Paul Wingfield) and Commander Chekov (Walter Koenig) beam down to search. They find the remnants of Kahn and his people, stranded there 15 years before (Star Trek episode: Space Seed). Kahn inserts mind altering creatures in them and takes over their ship. Kahn wants revenge because his wife (who joined him in the episode) died on the planet. When he learns of Genesis he goes to Regula Station to get it. The lead scientist, Carroll Marcus and her son with Kirk, David send a message to Kirk wanting answers about Reliant coming to get Genesis. Because of this and an unclear signal, Admiral Kirk takes command and The Enterprise goes to investigate. They find Reliant there, not responding to signals. The Enterprise is fired upon in crucial points on the ship. Kirk raises shields and returns fire too late, Kahn has the upper hand. Kahn wants Genesis and Kirk. Kirk pretends to retrieve all the Genesis files, while actually looking up command codes for Reliant. Kirk's puts down Reliant's shields and does heavy damage. Both Ships retreat to different sides of Regula. Kirk and a team go to Regula Station. Kahn has killed the stations crew and Genesis is gone. The team finds Capt. Terrell and Chekov, who tell what Kahn did and where that the crew of Reliant were left on Ceti Alpha. They find the transporters used and beam to the same place the others had gone. They find Dr. Marcus, her son and Genesis. Once they locate Genesis, Terrell and Chekov give Kahn the location, the device is then beamed out. The creature removes its self from Chekov and Terrell kills himself. The team returns to Enterprise and Kahn continues to attack Enterprise, thinking she is in worse shape than she is. The Enterprise defeats the ship, but Kahn uses Genesis. The Enterprise is damaged to the point that it can't escape the blast. Spock, with his superior Vulcan physiology, withstands radiation to repair the warp core. The Enterprise escapes but Spock dies, which if you didn't before, the sequels tell you anyway. Genesis is a success and the Enterprise mourns its loses.",996969600,,2950,4.85515873015873
246918,5,6300213803,"""The Wrath of Khan"" remains the best of the Star Trek movies. Yes, ""The Voyage Home"" was more fun, but the franchise is never going to be able to top the emotional impact of Spock's death. ""The Wrath of Khan"" is what we would have called a first-rate ""B"" movie in the old days. This is William Shatner's finest performance, helped by the fact that there is a telling subplot about Kirk worrying that he is growing old. Consequently, the character is given some significant depth whether he is dealing with having to put his spectacles on in front of the bridge crew or trying to come to terms with suddenly confronting a son who wants nothing to do with him. I also think Shatner's performance is helped by the fact that Kirk has to solve problems by thinking rather than by slugging anyone. In fact, Shatner won the Saturn Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA for his performance (director Nicholas Meyer won as well).
The emotional impact of the death of Spock is something that was set up from early on in the Star Trek television series where it became clear that despite their vast differences the Captain and his First Officer had become friends. This is a theme that has been touched upon by various television episodes as well as in some of the better Star Trek novels that have dealt with the formation of that friendship. The symbolism of the plastic shielding that separates them at the end, a physical manifestation of the psychological barriers required by the Vulcan part of Spock, is certainly not lost on us. With all the ""Buddy"" movies Hollywood has produced, I cannot think of a more emotional declaration that ""I have been and always shall be your friend."" Yes, it was something that was so well understood that it never needed to be said, but it was still worth hearing.
Both the direction and the score are first rate and I am especially fond of the sequences where the bridge crew is waiting helplessly for Genesis to detonate. The camera moves in on each character as they discuss their impending deaths and the music matches the pace only to turn ominously when the scene cuts back to the dying Khan. However, I must note that director Nicholas Meyer used the same series of jump cuts to pull away from the Reliant before Genesis detonates that he did with Kansas City when the nuclear missiles hit in ""The Day After."" I also think composer James Horner deserves credit for setting the tone with the marvelous opening fanfare and heroic theme. Even before we get to the Kobayashi Maru sequence, you know this is going to be a good flick.
The only thing that really bugs me about this movie is that Khan keeps quoting Ahab. Obviously his obsession is reminiscent of ""Moby Dick,"" but if you were a super genius would you really want to have Ahab as your role model? I understand how the allusion fits from the perspective of the director/writer/audience, but not from the perspective of Khan's character. Then again, besides ""Moby Dick"" one of the other books that Khan had on Ceti Alpha VI was ""King Lear,"" which also features a main character with mental problems. Remember, this is a guy who quoted Milton at the end of ""Space Seed,"" so I do not think he should suddenly be going off the deep end with his literary references. Ricardo Montalban's flamboyant performance as Khan not only works as he chews up the scenery with such delight, but because I think it is another significant reason that Shatner toned down his performance, thereby creating a nice contrast between the two characters.
With regards to the disappointing DVD version, which contains nothing extra besides the trailer despite the fact ""The Wrath of Khan"" aired on ABC with additional footage (e.g., establishing Preston as Scotty's nephew). I believe we are being sandbagged and that once they sell out on this initial run of Star Trek films on DVD we will suddenly get Director's Cuts or Special Editions that will suddenly provide all of the things Paramount should have put on these DVDs in the first place.

The tete-a-tete between Montalban and Shatner is truly wonderful, although there is one unintentionally funny element as Shatner is yelling ""Khan!"" into his comlink.  Even as a kid, I thought his facial expression (trying to depict true rage) was kind of funny.
Aside from that, it's a story that doesn't waste its time and the action was great!  The final scene with Spock's death was especially heart-wrenching playing beautifully into themes established early in the film

Montalban's great performance, I felt, helped push the other lead actors to perform to their fullest potential.

Shatner did a great job even though, he actually never acted in the same room with Momtalban. It was his best performance of all the Star Trek films.

The dialogue between all the characters, especially all the classic literature quotes, was written and performed beautifully. ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"", an amazing line and delivered beautifully by Moltalban as he blasts the Enterprise with phasers.

The death of a prominent Star Trek character at the end of the film was definitely a surprise when the film first aired. It added a lot to the feel of the story.

Short Review: 4.5/5 Captain Kirk takes on archenemy Khan, the superhuman maniac of ""Space Seed"" fame. Ship hijacking, betrayal, and bloodlust. All this plus the creation of a new world... and the death of a legend. An exciting and dramatic piece with enough kick for anyone.
Acting: 4/5 The Star Trek cast play it a bit smoother in this, their second film. Shatner walks alone most of the time, though he and Nimoy share some good dramatic moments in the end. Alley and Nimoy enjoy fun but chemistry-free screen time together as the Vulcan pair. The supporting cast gets so-so airtime. Koenig gets to be first officer on the Reliant after a tiny part in the first film. Doohan has a dramatic moment, that was reportedly cut down significantly. Kelley has probably the strongest lines in the entire picture, but little screen time. Nichols and Takei take a back seat to the rest of the crew, but come back firing strong in the next film.  The supporting cast is pretty darn good too. Montalban turns an explosive and surprisingly sinister performance as Khan. Besch and Butrick are entirely believable as Kirk's estranged family, and just prickly enough too. Alley is acceptable as the off-kilter Vulcan sidekick for Spock (Alley left the franchise and was replaced by the better Robin Curtis in Star Trek III: The Search For Spock). Winfield turns a brief performance as Terrel, but would return to Star Trek later (on ""Darmok"" in Star Trek: The Next Generation).
Directing: 4/5 Nicolas Meyer was given the task of constructing a cheaper and slicker sequel to Robert Wise's first Star Trek film. He took the task and ran with it. The film has an ""alive"" feel that never really returned to the franchise until the next time he helmed a film, in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.
Special and Visual Effects: 4.5/5 On-stage effects are good, but were restricted a bit due to budget constraints. The cavernous sets of the first film were scaled down to provide a grittier Enterprise under attack. Explosions were the big effects, as the ship is pummeled by the Reliant.
Visual effects are quite good. ILM took on a Star Trek film for the first time here. (They would be involved in the third, fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth films as well, though with decreasing involvement as time went on). Although the model and planet shots are all well executed, it is the computer generated ""Genesis Device"" scene that bowled audiences over. Although today the scene looks a bit antiquated, it holds up astoundingly well considering it was generated nearly twenty years ago.
(To be fair, I should note that a number of shots from the first film were re-used. The Klingons in the simulation were from the beginning of the first film, as were the spacedock and plain-star warping sequences. Paramount had spent so much on the first film's effects that this just seemed like a good idea. This does not in any way detract from the film... the effects were well done!)
Picture: 4.5/5 The picture is very clear. Artifacts are nonexistent in all but a few screens.
Sound: 4.5/5 James Horner's music just sounds superb. Dialog tracking is a bit lacking, but sound effects are quite good.

246980,5,6300213803,"This is a review of the DVD version.  Unfortunately, as with the whole collection of the Star Trek DVDs, Paramount has done us a disservice by not adding anything extra to the movies, except for a trailer, and a French language audio-track and English and French subtitles.  No commentaries by Harve Bennett, Leonard Nimoy, or any other directors, composers, special effects people, actors - nothing. Nada.  If it wasn't for the better picture quality of DVD, I'd stick with the VHS version.  I am very disappointed in this, and all Star Trek movies, as a DVD.  Please, Paramount, show some respect for the fans of Star Trek who have earned you untold billions of dollars, and give us a decent DVD offering of the movies we love so much.
In terms of the movie itself, what can I say? This is great film-making, and great script-writing. People who don't like Star Trek might dismiss it out of hand, but I would suggest this one (and also Star Trek IV) as movies the non-trekkie, even the non-science-fiction fan, will likely enjoy.  Of all the Star Trek movies, this one is the most mythic - using mythic in its proper sense, of characters who are beyond human, stretching in to the realm of true archetypes.  Think Greek epic writing, and you'll get the idea.  Khan as blind vengeance personified; Kirk as unstoppable but fallible hero; the meeting of Kirk with his unknown son; and Spock, the non-human, teaching us how to be human by sacrificing his life for the crew.  It also has so much in it about death and life, and how we deal with situations that are no-win (such as Spock sacrificing himself). Great stuff.  If you want to know about the plot of the movie, or more beyond that, you can read the other many reviews here.  I only wanted to mention this is a great story, to watch and enjoy, and also something that could be used in a literature class in high school or college.  The filing is beautiful, the soundtrack is phenomenal (ranks right up there with Conan the Barbarian and Star Wars for perfectly meshed film-and-music).
Also, if you do get the DVD, you must watch the movie with the French audio on, because none of the French actors they used to do the voices is appropriate, and it's simply hilarious.  I don't know where thy found the actors to do the voices, but Khan sounds like a weenie, Kirk sounds like an accountant, and the others have no emotion or acting skill at all.  Truly a bad voice-over, but, as I said, utterly hilarious.  When Khan utters his ""revenge is a dish best served cold"" and in French he ends with ""Foie"", he says it with such a silly emphasis, I about rolled off my couch to hear it, and played it over and over before going on with the rest of the movie.
Great, wonderful, exciting and well-written Star Trek/adventure/science-fiction movie, my favorite of the Star Trek series, and the DVD is wonderfully clear and crisp, but offers nothing for which the DVD format is designed.",984700800,7,2932,4.579349904397706

This is not the fault of the crew who upgraded the soundtrack but rather it is this way because of the age of the movie.  The soundeffects for the lasers and photon torpedoes emphasized treble rather than base, and for most of the movie Horner's score surpasses the sound effects.

247032,3,6300213803,"This movie has a great reputation, and I can understand that.  The conflict between Khan and Kirk is probably the most compelling one the movie series has had to offer, with the possible exception of Kirk against the Klingon conspiracy in Star Trek VI.  The character relationships between Spock, Kirk and McCoy are drawn exceptionally well, and Kirstie Alley's Saavik made a nice addition to the crew.
So what's the problem?  The movie rests on a series of coincidences and plot contrivances that are ultimately too frustrating to overlook, most of them centering around the first battle between the Enterprise and Khan aboard the Reliant.  Khan is able to inflict massive damage to Kirk's ship, and kill many crew members, because Kirk didn't follow regulations and had his shields down -- even AFTER another officer reminded him of the regulations.  That kind of sloppy thinking should lead to an investigation and a court martial, at the least.  Then, to get out of the predicament that Kirk's arrogance/ignorance has gotten them into, they use a code that lets them take over the enemy ship -- and after they fire a few shots, they let the ship get away, repair itself, and resume the battle.  It's a deus ex machina in the middle of the movie, for crying out loud, and then it gets ignored.
I'm not saying this is a terrible movie.  If you like fun SF, you'll probably enjoy it.  But it is an extremely flawed movie, and I find it hard to justify calling it the best of the series, as many have done.

Just rent ""Battleground,"" and then watch ""Wrath of Kahn"" to bookend an underrated performer's career.

Montalban's Kahn is powerful in his vengeance and hatred for Capt. Kirk, but also wounded and sympathetic. This, as much as anything, makes the second ""Star Trek"" film an enjoyable, old-fashioned yarn in the manner of ""Capt. Horatio Hornblower.""

Anyway, this movie has charms for even the non-Trek fan. The performances are solid. Aside from Montalban's excellent portrayal, William Shatner is surprisingly subtle and warm here, until the story actually calls for over-emoting (and any film with a subtext so based on Herman Melville's ""Moby Dick"" is going to call for some grand gestures eventually). Also up to the task are Leonard Nimoy, who manages to find Spock's ""humanity"" (in a half-alien character known for his emotionless logic), and the always-delightful DeForrest Kelley as the very humane and human Dr. McCoy.

In cinematic history, the ""Star Trek"" movie series probably will never be seen as fine art, but if a non-fan approaches this particular one with an open-mind and leaves behind the baggage of what is and isn't ""nerdy"" or ""geeky,"" he or she will find a fine adventure story which echoes great sea tales as much as it does the better episodes from the television series.

While the first movie seemed desperate and unending (and downright stupid at times) ST II was a joy to behold. The plot was solid, it had the best villian, and the special effects were wonderful by 1980's standards.
The story is basically a sequel from an old Star Trek TV episode called Space Seed. In it Khan (played magnificently by Ricardo Montalban) is a leader of a small genetically engineered group of ""super-beings"" who had been left in hibernation for 200 years drifting in space. After trying and failing to take over the Enterprize he and his group are left on a deserted planet to build anew. The movie starts 15 years into the future. The planet had experienced an enviorement disaster, causing all life to perish. All that is left is Khan and his dwindling group barely surviving. By sheer luck they are liberated by a starship, which they take over, and Khan is unleashed to seek his revenge. The film plays out almost like a chess match. The battle of wits between Kirk and Khan goes back and forth, leading Khan deeper and deeper into madness.
The highlight of this movie is quite simply: the cast. Of course all your favorite Star Trek crew members are here.

Well I almost skipped 'The Wrath of Kahn' altogether, but boy was I glad I went to see it opening night!  This started the whole craze of 'Only the even numbered Trek films are good'.
What a GREAT idea to take a snippet from an earlier original episode and I believe they chose very well when they made 'Space Seed' the one they went with.  I have to admit, Ricardo has held up well over the years, and his acting and madness is well portrayed as Kahn.  From the best special effects (I believe) in the Trek films (yes, even the newer ones aren't any better) to a slam-bam plot that moves at warp speed, 'Kahn' is arguably the best of the Trek movies.  Despite the death of Spock, which is dealt with in Trek III (so so in the Trek world of theatrical movies) my ONLY gripe with this movie (and see if you don't agree) is in the final moments before the Genesis Device goes off in the Nebula, the ONLY thing I wish HAD happened that DIDN'T was Kahn died believing that the explosion would at least kill Kirk...wouldn't it have been great to see Kahn's reaction when the Enterprise goes to warp JUST BEFORE the device detonated? Aside from that minor complaint, this is definitely one of the all-time great Sci-Fi movies and like I said, arguably the best Trek film-to-date (with Trek VI coming in a close 2nd).

What's special about it is the way the characters are presented.
Kirk, Spock and company are years older than they were on the series and they are well into middle age.  With this graduation they are presented with much more wisdom than before, even Kirk.  The characters in this installment haven't been given such noble traits since the ""City on the Edge of Forever"" episode in 1967.

There are subtleties in this performance that make it a joy to watch repeatedly...his expressive, beautiful hands, his amazing voice...""Let them eat static !"".

I must add a personal anecdote about the man behind this marvelous villain. Mr. Montalban is the kindest, most giving soul I have ever met.

Discerning DVD purchasers will appreciate  the new (finally!) letterbox format of this version, and the restored  life-like flesh tones [compared to the sepia toned VHS edition] and overall  improvement in color.
But the lack of extra scenes in this (and Star  Trek III) make it a don't buy in my opinion.  Gone are the alternative, and  deleted scenes aired on ABC.  There is no interview with cast, crew,  directors or even the 'making of' documentary.  The controversy regarding  the death of Spock, the leaking of this information in the press, and the  inclusion of the 'mock-Spock-death' in the first scenes as a result aren't  mentioned.  There is no background, no mention of the change of uniform  styles from the gray-uni-tunics in ""Star Trek: The Motion  Sickness""...
Director Nicholas Meyer (The Seven Percent Solution,  Star Trek VI) punched up the action, and returned to the roots of human  life in the 23rd century.  This epic tale of good guy Kirk and crew vs.  megalomaniacal Khan and crew has problems with pacing, but overall is a  great story for Star Trek fans who were disappointed with the first  theatrical outing.

I am all in favor of added footage,  deleted scenes, and director's cuts; but NOT at the expense of the original  film that I saw in the theater.  This cut is still the best, in my  opinion.
That said, all that additional footage is totally absent from  this DVD, as is just about any other special feature you could name.  The  one trailer included is all you get, and it's not even the best of the  teasers and trailers that this film spawned.

There are plenty of LFE opportunities in the movie, but the only time it  ever came through was in the drydock scene.  I got much better sound  effects for the explosions and battle scenes by switching off the 5.1 and  turning up the subwoofer sensitivity under straight stereo.  Disappointing  for a 5.1 DVD.

'Khan' became the template by which all good  Star Trek films and television would forever be judged. Shatner and  especially Montalban turn in fine performances but you have to watch them,  I think, with the realisation that some of the dialogue drips with almost  tongue-in-cheek, black humor. But that's okay, this is Space Opera. This  film also contains my favorite portrayal of Spock. Nimoy imbues him with  such grace, sly humor and courage we truly are devastated by Spock's death  scene. For a character who prided himself on the control of emotions, we  lose control of ours as we watch his (that word again) operatic demise. And  like true opera, sometimes death is not final. My major beef? The silly,  pseudo-scientific, virtually fantasy magick of the 'Genesis Device'. Even  by Star Trek standards it was very far fetched.",966729600,,1162,4.862244897959184

The powers that be behind Star Trek II made a masterful decision  by tying into one of the original Star Trek episodes for the premis of this  movie.  They brought original Star Trek fans back to the theater, and  created a new set of fans at the same time.
This film is a pleasure to  watch.  Ricardo does a great job as the anti-hero -- you may actually find  yourself secretly rooting for him.

William Shatner gives his best performance as Kirk, and Ricardo Montalban is incredible as the  revenge obsessed Khan.  The story is excellent and well paced, mixing small  doses of humor in just the right places.  The special effects are the best  of the series up to INSURRECTION, and Nicholas Meyer's direction is  excellent on all levels. The DVD transfer of the film is beautiful - by far  the best version of the film visually.  Sadly, however, the only extra we  get is the original theatrical trailer (and it's not exactly a spectacular  trailer - I seem to remember another trailer that was better...).  They  should have restored the film to include the footage seen on ABC when they  broadcast the movie back in the 80's.  That version has several extended  scenes that help make certain angles in the story make more sense.  They  also should have done a documentary on the making of the film, like the  documentaries on the James Bond DVD's.  All that may yet happen, but until  then this is still an excellent transfer of the original film, in it's  original theatrical form.  STAR TREK: THE WRATH OF KHAN is still most  die-hard Trek fans' pick as best Trek film, and I would agree with that  sentiment.  Even though the lack of extras is disappointing, I would  recommend this DVD to both Trek fans and non-Trek fans alike.  One of the  best Science Fiction films of all time.

Originally conceived as STAR TREK: THE  UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY (a tip to Spock's death -- the undiscovered country is  the place where no traveler returns from -- and a title Meyer liked enough  to resurrect for the sixth (and final) original cast Trek installment), the  film had just about everything going for it: plot, acting (yes, I said  acting), special effects, and an incredible sweeping musical score by James  Horner.
The DVD is pretty much perfect, with some caveats. I agree with  another reviewer about the lack of additional scenes on the DVD. What  happened, Paramount? We know these additional scenes to exist (via network  screenings of the film). One should note, however, the sound quality. It's  stunning, especially in surround. Almost worth it for that alone.

Khan in my opinion is one of Trek's greatest villains; he's out for revenge on Kirk after a freak accident in  the system he was placed on rendered his world a barren wasteland. This is  one cool thing right here: He doesn't want galactic conquest, he doesn't  want another world to settle on (despite Joachim's suggestion that they use  the Reliant to settle on another world), he wants only revenge on Kirk.  He's more imbalanced than Matt Decker was in TOS's ""The Doomsday  Machine,"" IMHO.
As for the DVD. Sure it only has a theatrical  trailer as an extra feature, but the 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen re-master  is excellent, and it's been re-done; the colors are so much sharper.

Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan strikes the perfect balance of drama, action, humor, pathos, and depth.  After the critical failure of the  first Star Trek movie, the producers took the trouble to view every episode  of the original series to figure out what made it special--they replicated  it successfully in The Wrath of Khan.  The plot is driven by the actions  and motivations of the characters, not the other way around.  This is not a  story about spatial anomolies or an excuse for technobabble and flashy  special effects.  This story is about the classic themes which have served  drama well since ancient Greek theatre: the quest for vengeance; lost  loves; the alienation, anger and reconciliation of fathers and sons; and  the realization of mortality.  Of the many science fiction films I have  seen, few have tugged at the heartstrings as deeply as The Wrath of Khan.  The most powerfull moments are the bittersweet reunion between Kirk and  Carol Marcus, the death of Spock and Kirk's eulogy, and the long delayed  embrace between Kirk and his estranged son David.  These moments are so  universal that any ""science fiction"" label for this film seems  limiting.
The script is helped by what is undoubtedly William Shatner's  finest performance as James T. Kirk.  Shatner brings the perfect balance of  bluster, brio, and vulnerability to the aging Admiral.  Toward the end of  the movie, Kirk, shattered by Spock's death, tears down his defenses and  allows us to see the human being behind the uniform.  Ricardo Montalban, in  a blood thirsty, Ahab-like performance, proves there is more to his acting  than what was seen on Fantasy Island.
The special effects, which are  entirely at the service of the story, for the most part hold up remarkably  well--one exception is the Ceti Eels, which look rather primitive by  today's CGI standards.  James Horner's crisp, vibrant score hints at the  great things which were to follow from him--it's a pity he has not been  used in more recent Star Trek fare.
Paramount's transfer is good, but  not quite on the same level visually as the other entries in the series.  The print, in a few places, shown signs of wear.  The sound is very well  balanced, with plenty of impact during explosions.  The theatrical trailer  is included.",963532800,2,2352,4.892857142857143

The triumph of the human spirit against all odds, the perils of manipulating nature, are just some  of the ideas presented in this exquisite feature length episode.
Star  Trek the Motion Picture was grandiose in scope and visuals, but Wrath of  Khan is true perfection. It is the perfect balance of story, visuals,  music, and everything else Star Trek is wonderful at. James Horner  (Titanic) adapts Jerry Goldsmith's original score from 1 and turns it into  his own personal masterpiece, especially noteworthy is Spock's theme.
The wonderful music rounds out what is probably the greatest Star Trek  episode, appealing to both fans and those who have never cared for Star  Trek.

And in some respects, why should they -- after all, we're just  dumb Star Trek fans who will buy whatever they put out, regardless of the  quality.
I had hoped that for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn, perhaps  the best of all the Star Trek movies, and certainly the most exciting and  visually stimulating, Paramount would have looked beyond the balance sheet  and issued something that they could be proud of and fans would snatch  up.
But I guess since this is the best of all the Star Trek movies, they  felt even less reason to give us something extra.  Thanks for nothing  Paramount -- great way to engender bad feelings towards a movie studio.",963273600,5,808,4.5874125874125875
247271,5,6300213803,"""The Wrath of Khan"", which was made for a fraction of what its' predecessor (""The Motion Picture"") cost, is a far better film in every respect. In fact, it's the best Trek film of all time, hands  down.
""Khan"" is packed with fast-paced action, terrific visual  effects, good humor, and one of the best sci-fi villians of all time.
Where do you start? William Shatner has his histrionics down to a  science as Kirk (""KHAAAAAN! KHAAAAAAN!), and the interplay between him  and the other members of the ""Trek trio"" - McCoy and Spock - is  nothing short of delightful. But Shatner gets to play a rare scene that  doesn't involve overacting in the ""Spock death"" sequence, which  is actually quite touching, especially to Trekkers.
But the scene stealer  in ""Khan"" is none other than Ricardo Montalban. His over-the-top  turn as the genetically-enhanced, Melville-quoting, super-intelligent,  certifiably loony Khan is terrific - so good, in fact, that Khan remains a  touchstone sci-fi villain to this day.
The film does have flaws. While  the ""exterior"" special effects are outstanding, some of the  interior sets are incredibly cheesy - particularly the ""chamber""  where Spock dies, which features multi-colored disco lights in the ceiling  and floor. And I always found myself wondering why Kirk couldn't just blow  up the Reliant to stop the Genesis device - is it impervious to photon  torpedoes?
Those nitpicks aside, ""Khan"" is a terrific film and  it's great fun. If you're new to the Trek universe, make this your first  home video purchase. You will not be disappointed.",963273600,2,1573,5.0271317829457365

247275,5,6300213803,"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - This movie is the second best movie of all time, just barely behind Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. It is full of humor, action, and has a human angle, unlike the previous  film.
This film definitely goes back to the ""action-flick""  genre of the TV series with a story (obviously) continuing from one of the  first-season episodes, ""Space Seed"". In that episode, Kirk  marooned Khan Noonien Singh, a genetically-engineered superhuman who tried  to take over the Enterprise, on a distant planet, rather than take him back  in custody. In the movie, that planet takes a turn for the worse soon  afterward and a lot of Khan's party die. Khan lives for revenge on Captain  (now Admiral) Kirk. In the movie, Khan manages to hijack a science vessel,  the Reliant, and comes after Kirk. The movie plot is a lot more detailed  and exciting, but that is the main idea.
Perhaps what makes this movie so  good is the fact that a new director was at the helm, without previous Trek  experience. He tried to get the ""feel"" of the TV episodes, and it  worked wonderfully. Some people say that this film relies too much on  action, but, watching the finale, this is not the case. Having Spock  sacrifice himself to save the ship sounds like a strange idea, but it  really works in the film.
This film is MUCH darker than the previous one  and almost any of the newer Treks, also. It is probably the most violent,  as well, and would DEFINITELY get a PG-13 now. The worst things are maybe  those ""vile little creatures"" that go in people's ears. Be  forwarned, this may turn you away from it, so you might want to hit the  fast-forward. Violence aside, this is a perfect movie. It is one every  science-fiction fan should see.",962236800,2,1752,4.548076923076923

Y'see, there's this new thing the Federation is working on called the  Genesis Project.  It lands on a dead planet or moon and turns it into a  planet-sized garden of Eden.  But what happens when you launch it at a  planet that's already got life?  Well, that's what Khan intends to find out  just as soon as he's done making Kirk and his Enterprise full of cadets and  original cast members completely miserable and then just dead if he can  manage.

Admiral James T. Kirk: Khan, you bloodsucker! You're gonna  have to do your own dirty work now, do you hear me? Do you? Khan: Kirk!  You're still alive, old friend! Admiral James T.

247415,5,6300213803,"Star Trek II succeeds because, unlike the earlier Star Trek TMP, it goes back to the strengths of the original TV series.  Star Trek has never been ""hard"" Sci-fi; it has always been at its best when it focuses on  an attractive group of characters--Kirk, Spock, McCoy et al.
If you  haven't seen it yet, Star Trek II builds on an episode from the TV series  entitled ""Space Seed,"" in which Kirk encounters a former dictator  of Earth named Khan, defeats his attempt to hijack the Enterprise, and  maroons him on a deserted planet.  Some 15 years later, Khan escapes, gains  control of another starship, the Reliant, and learns about the film's  MacGuffin, the ""Genesis"" device, potentially a lethal  superweapon.  Once again, the Enterprise is ""the only ship in the  quadrant"" available to deal with the crisis.  Along the way Kirk  discovers he has a son, and we also meet Lt. Saavik, a half-Vulcan protege  of Spock's.
But the plotline is almost secondary.  Star Trek II is really  about how the characters, primarily Kirk and Spock, deal with growing old,  and with ""no-win"" situations, and eventually with death.  I've  sometimes thought of it as sort of an outer space counterpart to  Peckinpagh's ""Ride the High Country.""
The cast is great,  especially Shatner and Nimoy, but also including Ricardo Montalban as Khan  (reprising his guest role in the TV series) and Kirstie Alley making an  impressive debut as Saavik.  Nicholas Meyer directs ably, and James  Horner's score is excellent.

7805676,3,6300213803,I am not a big Star Trek fan.  A few of my friends are Trekkies.  And I think they keep making all these movies with different cast members.  And I quit watching them after about the first four I think.  Any way this is by far and away the best one I have seen and my favorite one.  And also the only one I ever bothered to buy.  It plays more like an extended version of the t.v. show.  Which I didn't watch that much either.  Maybe if more of the movies were made like this one.  I would be more into it.,1520640000,,506,3.8349514563106797

7805680,5,6300213803,Great film. A real movie which can maintain viewer attention unlike some of the other Star Trek films which feel more like a protracted tv episode than a movie. I especially like DeForest Kelley's work in this.,1516320000,,210,4.702702702702703
