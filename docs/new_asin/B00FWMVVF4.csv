6034295,5,B00FWMVVF4,I was Wally's age when this show ran......so I didn't watch it because we started a band.,1408320000,2,89,4.294117647058823
6034296,5,B00FWMVVF4,Bought as gift for my mother. Love that they came out with the first and second season on single sided dvds. The pictures is very  nice for its age. Clear and crisp without that blur that is apparent from so many older shows. Plus you get almost 40 episodes! Hours of relaxing and well crafted entertainment.,1406764800,6,308,4.5
6034297,5,B00FWMVVF4,"Are these stories perfect? No, there are a lot of stereotypes. But considering when they were produced, they are amazingly well done. Many are quite humorous and most contain wisdom and/or illustrate lessons about human interaction and life's problems.
While simplistic in some ways, even adults and teens could gain some insight from most of these episodes. I liked it enough to purchase season two.",1399075200,5,400,5.1692307692307695
6034298,4,B00FWMVVF4,"Leave it to Beaver is rather a simple show, but does that mean it isn't worthy of watching? In the delightful film ""Pleasantville"" the characters travel back in time and become characters in a 1950s era TV show that carries the same name as the film. That show is fictional, of course and so is Leave it to Beaver, but what happens in each is often amusing and easy to watch. And even if the scenarios in Leave it to Beaver are too ordered and/or too perfect in their outcomes sometimes it still remains amusing television for the most part. Besides, it is one of the several 1950s era family-style shows that people still watch.

This season's 39 episodes: ""Beaver Gets 'Spelled,'"" ""Captain Jack,"" ""The Black Eye,"" ""The Haircut,"" ""New neighbors,"" ""Brotherly Love,"" ""Beaver's Crush,"" ""The Clubhouse,"" """"Wally's Girl Trouble,"" ""Beaver's Short Pants,"" ""The Perfect Salesmen,"" """"Voodoo Magic,"" ""Part Time genius,"" ""Party Invitation,"" """"Lumpy Rutherford,"" ""The Paper Route,"" ""Child Care,"" ""The Bank Account,"" """"Lonesome Beaver,"" ""Cleaning up Beaver,"" ""The Perfect Father,"" """"Beaver and Poncho,"" """"The State vs. Beaver,"" ""The Broken Window,"" ""Train Trip,"" ""My Brother's Girl,"" ""Next Door Indians,"" ""Tenting Tonight,"" ""Music Lesson,"" ""New Doctor,"" ""Beaver's Old Friend,"" ""Wally's Job,"" ""Beaver's Bad Day,"" ""Boarding School,"" ""Beaver and Henry,"" ""Beaver Runs Away,"" ""Beaver's Guest,"" and ""Cat out of the Bag.""",1384300800,10,1402,5.401826484018265

6034305,5,B00FWMVVF4,Disks played perfect. Great show that really shows how far the wrong direction this country has gone. Where are the values and morals people had then? Kids born in the 50's & 60's that were raised this way are the ones to blame for not instilling these values in there own children which now have children of there own that have zero values,1446163200,5,340,4.412698412698413
