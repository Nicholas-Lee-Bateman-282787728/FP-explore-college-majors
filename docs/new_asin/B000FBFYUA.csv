8119947,4,B000FBFYUA,"You should know that I've always been a little interested in history. Saw this on tv first and liked it . It references an achaeological excation, the relationship between stone and timber castles, a little information on timber castles' purposes and links them to a popular historical event. And there are a few other things here and there that make sense out of timber castles. There are a few hosts not including the narrator that add to the show. I can't remember what I paid for it but I might would have paid 30 dollars to get it.",1301788800,2,536,4.479591836734694
8119948,4,B000FBFYUA,"Well, what can I say about this film?
If you're interested in castles then this is a good place to start.
A good souce of info.
The documentary isn't too short or too long.
It gives just enough info to keep your attention without getting bogged down in the usual boredom that plagues many documentaries.
Wooden castles, stone castles.
Your either interested or your not.
For those that are, this particular documentary comes...
Highly recommended.
Not too deep or too shallow, just perfect for those just getting into the subject.",1283731200,4,530,4.9
8119949,4,B000FBFYUA,"While the price is undoubtedly high for a 50 min. documentary, it is very hard to find anything about timber castles. As anyone who loves history will know, most programs on castles spend the majority of their time on the idiocy of ""knights in shining armor"" and dungeons. This one does not!

It begins with a fairly simple explaination of the beginning of castles (quite rudimentary to any but a beginner), but then progresses to useful information of timber castles, their construction, being replaced by stone ones, an even being painted to look as if they were stone.

As I said, very expensive for a 50 min. show, but still worth it to those who love the history of castles and want something beyond the usual dreck that is offered.",1183593600,15,737,4.661538461538462
