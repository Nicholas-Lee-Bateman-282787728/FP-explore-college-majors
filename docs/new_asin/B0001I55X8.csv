Then, I finally saw this on the Disney Channel and loved the score, story, the scenery and the characters.

2005518,4,B0001I55X8,"I notice a few reviewers think that younger people would be bored by this movie.  I just watched it with my eleven year old and he liked a lot.  He said at first that it looked dull but then sat down and got sucked into it, especially the racing scenes.  The acting is good and the story moves along.

I only give it four stars though, because it is only about 50% like the book that I enjoyed so much as a child.  The book was really good--I don't know why they didn't stick to it.",1162771200,8,482,3.9791666666666665

I saw it once nearly 30 years ago and I loved it and felt the need to buy it just to see it again when it was released on DVD. I found myself remembering certain parts of it and images in an uncanny sort of way.

The story is a bit simplistic, but the scenery is interesting and there is a surreal little dream sequence which is great, though not brilliant. Overall, I got out of it what I wanted and would gladly share this movie with other young people...though I'm not sure how much of their attention it would hold in this modern age...?",1095292800,24,609,4.161016949152542
2005523,5,B0001I55X8,"This movie was filmed for the Disney anthology TV series ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World Of Color"" (also known as ""The Wonderful World Of Color"") and was shown in two parts on January 7 & 14, 1962. The film was released theatrically outside the United States in 1964. I consider this film among Disney's best live-action films of its time.

 The film is based on Mary Mapes Dodge's classic 1865 book of the same title. It is a shame that the book and film are both unknown by most people, because both are very special.

 The story has everything I want in a film - characters I can admire and care about, who overcome numerous hardships and earn their happy ending.

 The scenery is beautiful - filmed in the Zuider Zee area of Holland near the scenic communities of Comperduin and Volendam, as well as at Rembrandt's home in Amsterdam. The winter scenes for the skating races were filmed in Sweden.

 The basic plot is of a brother and sister trying to win a skating race for money for their father's operation. He needs an operation due to brain damage from a head injury. The family is also desperately poor, because only the father knows where their savings are hidden - and he cannot remember. The story is full of adventure, hardship, mystery, and the love of a family for each other.

 I first remember this film from seeing it on the Disney Channel in the mid 1980s. I have enjoyed watching the film numerous times over the years and am thrilled to finally have a chance to buy it on DVD.",1091318400,91,1496,4.487084870848708

2005564,5,B0001I55X8,What a great kid's movie.  I gave my granddaughters Barbie dolls of the world; among them Dutch Barbie.  I always try to find books and films for children that will give them additional background on whatever country their dolls are from.  They thoroughly enjoyed this great old Disney Film which teaches familial love and compassion as well as self sacrifice.  The countryside was just beautiful and the village was so authentic looking with the fishing boats. Costumes were very authentic....one expects that from Disney.  The reclamation of the land from the sea was in the introduction to the film and was so well explained.  References are made to the many famous Dutch painters.  Of course the book it was based on is a classic. Disney didn't let me down.  The plot moved right along and the acting was solid.  Definitely for the young....and very well done.  A very nice oldie but goodie.,1411257600,,895,4.828947368421052

I am pleased to see it holds up well, benefiting from location filming in Holland and Sweden, and earnest performances from the local European cast. The occasional visual distraction (such as a sleek modern electric streetlamp in 1860s Amsterdam) doesn't detract from what remains an enjoyable family film that never descends into the saccharine.

Hans is poor. The girl he loves is wealthy. The girl's father wants her to date only wealthy boys. The wealthy rival gives Hans trouble.

Half of Holland was once ocean; made into dry farmland, by building dikes / dams, and draining the water by windmill-driven-pumps into canals. One city in Holland reaches 23-feet below sea-level.

They may not be ""normal"" Hollywood performances (obnoxious precocious child actors), but (perhaps) the innocence and honesty they convey is just what this film needed. Rony Zeaner is excellent as Hans Brinker. I tried but could find no mention of his name anywhere online except with this production. He may have felt he gave his best performance and simply walked away from it all. People have discredited this movie because it did not follow the book. Okay, go read the book, if you like. If everyone avoided movies that didn't follow a book's storyline, then a lot of very good movies (including many classics) would fall into that catagory.

2005599,5,B0001I55X8,"BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: Shot on location in Amsterdam, and the towns of Camperduin and Volendam.  The ice skating races on the frozen lake and river were shot in Sweden according to the Disney film book by Harry Tytle. Harry was the European Disney Representative overseeing film project s for many years. Like many of the films made in Europe under Walt Disney's guidance, this film was made with local actors and crew with the exception of a few administrative special positions. The art director, cameramen, wardrobe, sound, lights, and set construction was all provided by local talent. The very capable acting was all local talent as well. The film was directed by Norman Foster and he also acted as the local associate producer, (Walt's name always appeared as producer), and had previously directed some of the episodes of Davy Crockett, Zorro, and Elfego Baca shows for Disney. He also makes an appearance in the October 27, 1954 show The Disneyland Story"". Mr. Foster also wrote the screenplay for this film based upon the classic book of the same name by Mary Maples Dodge. A co-director from the region worked with Foster on the set. The music was by one of the long-time Disney Studio staff composers, Oliver Wallace who won an Academy Award  for his work on Dumbo, as well as working on scores for Cinderella, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, and Lady and the Tramp. The artwork that Hans sketches throughout the film was created by an artist hired for the film, Joshua Meador.

The film was made for the television show ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" as a two episode movie airing January 7 & 14, 1962. It aired three years later on April 18 & 25, 1965.  The episodes were edited together for European theatrical release as a movie in 1963. Unlike many Disney films, this one had not been released to the VHS rental market in the 1980's and so this is the first release for the U.S.A. home market. The new DVD was released on September 7, 2004. The picture and sound were clear and bright. The aspect ratio is 1.33:1. Total length is 90 minutes.

This films works in a big part because Walt Disney allowed his producers to go to Europe and film on location with local acting talent, scenery, and a local film crew for authenticity. No backlot recreations of Dutch villages, or dubious Dutch period costumes would do, he strove for authenticity and it shows. Leonard Maltin calls this film, ""First Rate"" and I heartily agree. The exciting story, cast, costumes, culture and scenery all come together  just right in a quickly paced film. This is a great family film, and the way the family comes together to help each other is a great role model for any family.

THE STORY:  This highly recommended period film is about the lives of the Brinker family who lives in a rural Dutch village near the Zuider Zee. The father Raff, is a fisherman and although the family is poor they are a very close and happy family.  His teenage son Hans is a budding artist who helps his family, but would like to go to school to become a professional artist. His father not only supports this, but has been saving money towards his education.  Teenage daughter Gretel helps at home and is very talented with her own skills in making lace.  Mother Hilda keeps them all together, but when tragedy strikes the family when Raff is injured they are challenged. Hans and his sister quickly chip in to find inventive ways to earn income to eat and afford their fathers medical care. When Hans and Gretel learn of a big ice skating race with a cash prize race, they decide to join in. There is some romance as Hans and a girl fall in love, but her wealthy father will not allow her to see someone of that is not in the upper class.",1211587200,14,3729,4.592481203007519
2005600,4,B0001I55X8,"Hans Brinker or the Silver Skates is truly the quintessential family film.  Having grown up watching the Wonderful World of Disney, I have fond memories watching the ""Wonderful World of Color.""  It is still a delight to see Mary Mapes Dodge's nineteenth century story come alive of Hans (Rony Zeaner) and his sister, Gretel (Carin Rossby), keep the family together as they attempt to win the winter ice skating race in order to pay for their father's head operation.  The film carries three themes, which consists of the family, pursuing one's dream, and kindness.

But in every story, there are obstacles.  Hans works odd jobs from selling wood to local merchants to drawing pencil sketches in order to put food on the table for his father, mother, brother, sister, and for himself.  Hans and Gretel leave their home in Holland and travel to Amsterdam to find a doctor who specializes in head injuries, and in the interim, Hans comes across an art dealer who takes in his sketches.  In addition, he takes a liking towards Hilda Van Glick (Gunilla Gelf), and tries to win her heart and impress her father by painting her portrait.  However, Hans is scrutinized by one of his peers and rival, Ludwig Schimmel (Lennart Klefbom), who spreads rumors and lies about Hans and Hans's father (Eric Strandmark), whom he cruelly refers to as the village idiot.  Regardless of the bullying, Hans prevails.

Disney churns out another timeless classics that can be enjoyed by the entire family.  And for every film, there is always a moral to the story, which is that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.  Indeed, this rang true for Hans Brinker.",1203292800,4,1644,4.770318021201414

The story is a homely family tale of poor versus rich and how poor is actually wealthier than some of the wealthy snobs in the movie. It is a perfect holiday and winter film and honestly great during the hot months of summertime to help cool your days. Kids as well as adults will love this tale based on the Mary Mapes novel of the 1800's about Hans Brinker who is a real Dutch character. Seeing Richard Basehart in this flick as the eccentric doctor searching for a lost son, the warmth of Amsterdam, the home and the boys, and of course the ice skating all add up to a top notch flick that not only is engrossing and enjoyable, but will leave you feeling great to.

And a beautiful touch: The narrator seems to presume in the film's viewers a knowledge of old Dutch masters, and talks without condescension or a dumbing-down of vocabulary about the history of the Dutch and their precarious land.",1486512000,,453,4.6625
