1425393,1,B00005CCDG,This is poorly put together. There are too many shots of the crowd and then they spliced performances of the same song together. I think this fails b/c you don't get a chance to experience the performance. The 'tour' itself becomes the showcase and I think R Lester missed out on a great opportunity to capture a Paul and his solid band.,999043200,6,337,4.451612903225806
1425394,5,B00005CCDG,"If you haven't experienced Paul McCartney Live, then Get Back Live is the ultimate experience.  Hear a collection of Beatles and McCartney solo work encompassing almost 30 years of musical genius.  A must addition for any McCartney fan.  I owned the VHS and had to purchase the DVD.",995241600,2,282,4.833333333333333
1425395,5,B00005CCDG,"If you grew up with this music like I did,  than some of the tunes are likely to draw out some memories and possibly along with a tear.  The DVD and performance just gets better as you go.  Of course I would love to have 20 more songs and 2 more hours,  but this is a great DVD.  I was at the show in Dallas, TX in 1989 and it was great.  There are moments that you think Paul is 28 again on some of the songs. The old Beatle classics just reminds me of how huge of an icon this man is and what an incredible talent.  And of course the fab four classics are the highlights here but put it there is really a nice piece.  This is just a great release for any Beatle or Paul McCartney fan.  For the budget conscious its a bit pricey and takes a while to get,  but if you can foot it,  grab one and hold on.  The memories will last for a long time.",992563200,8,844,3.7873563218390807
1425396,4,B00005CCDG,"I was at Maracana, Rio de Janeiro, where Paul broke the record of attendance on a single artist show, and it was really awsome and no words can describe that show. This DVD is only one piece of the full lenght show but it is really one of the best tours that Paul McCartney has ever made. The sound on DVD is very good and I believe it worth any cent you spend to buy it. I've got mine here in Brazil a few weeks ago and i am still watching on the screen to remind that day. I think the only think they missed it was the lack of the documentary about the tour which was released after the VHS was done and so this is why I gave four stars to this title. I now is only waiting for the release of the Cavern Club show on DVD to complete my colection.",988761600,4,748,3.8636363636363638
1425397,5,B00005CCDG,"Everyone who loves Paul is waiting for the Paul's DVD. The World Tonight and Standing Stone are not enough. Music for Montserrat is only a bit of the Big Mac's live perfomnaces. Get Back is a good start but... the ""Beatles Anthology"" on DVD??????",987379200,2,246,4.613636363636363
7938040,3,B00005CCDG,The quality was ordinary. There was ghosting across the screen.,1424736000,,63,5.4
7938041,5,B00005CCDG,"I was 12 when the Beatles hit the charts.  This dvd to me was excellent!  The songs and the flashback pictures were great for the die hard fan. I did not care for the political flashes during the song, ""Live and Let Die"" but most musicians have their own views on the world anyway.  The music is excellent no matter what and the early photos were a treat! I would recommend this to the devoted fan of the Beatles!",1145318400,,413,4.2025316455696204
7938042,4,B00005CCDG,"This is a DVD of Paul McCartney's 1989-90 world tour.  Twenty tracks were selected and accompanied by enjoyable, but unnecessary, extra footage of the Beatles and the '60s.  The concert is filmed very well, and Paul plays some of his best material.  From the minute he kicks off ""Band on the Run"" to the moment he ends the beautiful Abbey Road medley, he never ceases to come through strong.  Other highlights include ""Put it There,"" ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" ""Back in the USSR"" and ""Let it Be.""  Paul, to me, is not 48 years old in this film.  He still rocks as hard as he did at 22.  Good work, Paul.",1094515200,2,604,4.339285714285714
7938043,5,B00005CCDG,"I got the VHS version for this concert almost two years ago and it is great!!!, sound and image quality is excellent even given the fact that it is tape.
  You might think that there are songs missing or interviews but the songs included are worth what you pay for it. Also, scenes that show audience enjoying the show makes you feel like if you were there too.
  I like specially the way ""Coming Up"" is performed and the way old concert scenes are mixed in some songs, like for example, ""Can't buy me love"".
  Hope to get the DVD version soon.
Regards.",1067990400,,553,4.320388349514563
7938044,4,B00005CCDG,"This film of Paul's 1989/1990 has great moments but it has a few flaws. Only 20 of the 30+ songs are performed and some of Richard Lester's footage take away much of a song's worth. However, some of his little bits of footage work quite nice. Overall, the performances, color, sound, and filming is done quite well. The film is shot better than ""Rock Show"" but ""Paul Is Live In The New World"" is slighly better. To sum it up, a can't miss for Paul Mcartney/Beatles' fan.",1016064000,2,470,4.413793103448276
7938045,1,B00005CCDG,"The song Long And Winding Road is entirely a documentary about the Vietnam war, instead of seeing Paul sing. I bought this DVD in order to let my mum see Paul sing this song. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING.",1015632000,,197,4.5
7938046,2,B00005CCDG,"Ouch!  Such a pricey dvd.  I sure wish it were better.  Given the greatness of the music and performances, it's a little puzzling why the film is so distractingly bad--but bad it certainly is.
The blame probably goes in a number of directions.  One is that it's not apparent that McCartney really thought through the visual aspect of this concert (the sets, lighting, and back-projections are very 70s).  This is no surprise.  McCartney is massively charming, as everyone knows, but it's also true that his visual imagination doesn't really work in terms of motion picture.  So, he paints surprisingly well and takes a beautiful photo, but he can't really conceive of images extended through time, the way, say, David Byrne or Laurie Anderson do so well.
More importantly, however, I think McCartney is seriously let down by the filmmakers.  The film stock selected is jaw-droppingly bad for these night concerts, the editing is lazy, the direction is plainly uninspired, the cameramen are too obviously flirting with audience-members, the interpolated 60s footage is ill-advised and in poor taste (I mean, is Long and Winding Road really about the napalm girl?).  You almost wonder whether the filmmakers were *trying* to make a great concert into a dull one.  The transfer on dvd is minimally adequate.
In short, any of the other McCartney videos are preferable to this one.
I might add that while the Tripping the Light Fantastic 2CD has a nice mix of classics and selections from McCartney's superb Flowers in the Dirt album, the concert here is short (is the dvd even shorter than the VHS?) and consists almost exclusively of Beatles/Wings oldies.  As a consequence, we get to see Paul do the songs he nearly always does, and the video here has less to offer the Paul collector.  Yesterday anyone?",1015200000,4,1802,4.95016611295681
7938047,5,B00005CCDG,"I was only 9 when I saw Paul for the first time. My dad took me to see him in New York city on December 9th,1989. I still have lots of feelings for this concert and it will never be forgoten in my mind. This Dvd brings back memories for me of when I was a kid. I hope others feel the same for this Dvd as I do as it is the best live show McCarney has ever done.",1005004800,,361,3.525

7938049,1,B00005CCDG,"Like the other reviewers, I couldn't agree more. I went to the concert when he came down here to New Zealand, and the concert still stands as one of the best concerts I have ever been to, and believe me, I have been to a lot!!
So I was very keen to have a record of this great concert but this was total [hogwash]. Not the show!! The visual presentation of the show. I can't even watch it, its done so badly. Here's a tip Mr Director, just point the camera towards the stage area - and walk away!! Believe me it would have been better if he did.
See if you can rent it first before you buy it.",1002585600,16,593,3.95
