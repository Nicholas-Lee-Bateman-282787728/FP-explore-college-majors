8394826,5,B003DKT7RG,"I watched this several years ago and was impressed with Perry Stone's knowledge and understanding of the Bible and of Hell. His explanations are easy to understand and very interesting. He discusses the connection of the Dead Sea as the main entrance to Hell, and also where other entrances are probably located. A must view for skeptics and believers alike. The following is the description as written on Perry Stone's website: This is powerful teaching that explains where Sinners will spend Eternity. Five types of chambers are located under the earth. Their entrances are under the seas. Preached on location in Israel, journey with Perry as he unlocks astonishing insight into where sinners go after death. Hear how the famous Dead Sea may be the future site of the lake of fire!",1296172800,3,784,4.946969696969697
