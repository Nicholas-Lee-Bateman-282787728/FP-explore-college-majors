People had no jobs and not future if we are to assume the documentary footage here is accurate. It's very depressing, to coin a phrase.

Clip after clip shows people trying to get work or being in breadlines. It's sad, but I couldn't stop watching because I had no idea it was this rough.

It's really interesting to see what things were like then and how much better we have it now.",1146787200,2,466,4.213483146067416
