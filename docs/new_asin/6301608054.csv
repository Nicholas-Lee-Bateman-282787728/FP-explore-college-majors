337497,4,6301608054,"Although this is an English-Italian movie and made in English, this might as well be considered a ""foreign film"" to us in North America because it certainly has the feel of it. The dialog, the mood and actions of the people are like films from France or Italy. For me, that's fine as I enjoy their good storytelling and the fascinating photography.

There is action in the first 10 minutes but not that much afterward. About halfway through this 112-minute film, it begins to bog down, but I still rate this movie with four stars almost strictly on the cinematography which is excellent, especially in that first half. The little boy and hi his dad are fun to watch.

****spoilers****  Storywise, I did not understand the card game near the end and did not agree with the ending where the ""good guys"" cheat to get their goods back. I just never subscribed to the message that ""two wrongs make a right.""

I would like to this film again, and with a nice DVD transfer. Like others here, I'm wondering if this will ever come out on DVD.",1239580800,,1033,4.508021390374331
337498,5,6301608054,"It is rare to find a film that can make you laugh out loud and then move you to tears. It is rarer to find a film that lingers with you for days and even years afterwards. ""Queen of Hearts"" is such a movie. The scene in which the narrator's grandfather dies (I don't want to give it away) would go onto my short list for the most moving scene in any movie. The wedding scene is one of the funniest. The way this film deals with marriage, children, jealousy, and death is an inspiration. An English language film set in London, the movie nevertheless has all the richness we expect of the best Italian cinema. It is long overdue for DVD release. Full of drama, but never taking itself too seriously, ""Queen of Hearts"" is an utter delight.",1172275200,5,737,4.309352517985611
337499,5,6301608054,"A strange and magical movie, full of wonder. At its bare bones it's about an Italian family who runs a coffee shop in London. But it's so much more than that. In a magnificent opening sequence, our hero (Joseph Long) and heroine (Anita Zagaria) elope in Italy by leaping from a church tower onto a haywagon. By eloping Zagaria has broken her engagement to another man, who swears revenge. They go to London, set up their little coffee shop, have a bunch of kids (one of them is the narrator of the movie) - and must confront the jilted man in the end. The movie unfolds masterfully, with many different plot lines meshing together, but never obscuring the main story. It's a total joy to watch: funny, warm, and delightful. Definitely worth a watch.",1135900800,9,749,4.597014925373134
337500,5,6301608054,"This is such a beautfiul movie. my only complaint is that it has not come out on DVD (sigh). It got short shift in the theaters because it was overshadowed by Cinema Paradiso, to which it bears some sweet similaritiesl. It is just such a moving film about family and the immigrant experience.",1111190400,8,292,4.528301886792453
337501,4,6301608054,"The story begins in Italy and centers around Rosa (Anita Zagaria) and Danilo (Joseph Long) who love each other. Unfortunately, her mother, Mama Sibilla (Eileen Way), has arranged for Rosa to marry the butcher's son, Barbariccia (Vittorio Amendola). Meanwhile, Danilo's father, Nonno (Vittorio Duse), has barricaded Danilo in the house to keep him away from the soon to be married Rosa. True love, however, cannot be kept waiting, and Rosa and Danilo manage to escape their erstwhile jailers. In a madcap dash for freedom, they make one of the most breathtaking and daring escapes, as they jump off a rooftop. How they are saved makes for great cinema.
They run off to England, taking disgruntled Mama Sibilla with them. They marry and begin the life so often the lot of immigrants, hard work, long hours. Danilo, working as a waiter, has a surreal vision one night of a talking pig's head, while at work. He follows its advice and wins the stake for his own business, a little Italian style cafe that he opens and runs with his and Rosa's ever growing family.
All is well with the world. The business, while never a big money maker, manages to feed and clothe the family. It is at the center of their lives. Years go by. His father, Nonno, now aging, comes from Italy to live with them. The children are growing up. Life changes. One day, Barbariccia shows up in England, never having forgotten Rosa. Even though twenty years have passed, he has not forgotten that Danilo took Rosa away from him. Rosa is truly the Queen of Hearts.
The coming of Barbariccia sets into motion a series of events that will see Rosa and Danilo's family and business begin to disintergrate. Barbariccia will stop at nothing to get Rosa. Yet, the core of Rosa's and Danilo's lives are so intertwined that they manage to rise from the ashes, as they still believe in miracles. They live as they love, deeply and steadfastedly. In the end, they manage to triumph, despite the adversity with which they were beset. This is a story of love, family, faith, and the every day vicissitudes of life. The story of Rosa, Danilo, and their family is brought to life by an engaging cast. It is Eileen Way, however, who, as Mama Sibilla, steals the show with a caustic and wry performance. This is a truly a film worth watching.",1023494400,6,2293,4.664197530864198

337503,5,6301608054,"Queen of Hearts chronicles an Italian couple who move to Britian in the 1960s and raise their family there.  It is a delightful story that mixes elements of drama, comedy, melodrama, fantasy, and suspense.  The basic plot concerns what happens when an old rival from Italy moves into the family's neighborhood and begins to cause trouble.  The family begins to break apart, but the youngest son, Eddie, plots to bring them back together.  The ways in which the family's loyalties and affections are tested, and then triumph, are superb and heart-warming.  I highly recommend this movie and have seen it numerous times.",1012521600,5,618,5.019607843137255
337504,5,6301608054,"QUEEN OF HEARTS. One of the most charming films of the 80's. It's a happy, sad, tragic, comic and glorious film about an Italian immigrant family living in England, filled with the kind of characters that used to be so common in 30's and 40's films when we had character actors who played outrageous, over-the-top parts.
The story opens in Italy where Danilo steals Rosa away on her wedding day from the man her mother had chosen for her. Their escape plays with the action of a Republic serial but with a totally unexpected comic ending. The two flee to London where Danilo is given the secret to winning at cards from a talking stuffed pig on a meat platter. But his success is short lived and he and his family soon turn to running a coffee shop that is only marginally successful.
The rest of the film is taken up with marriage and family and the adventures of life that happened while they wait for that lucky break-----------and it happens with an extraordinary event that pulls joy from tragedy. I'll only tell you that for the men in her life, Rosa remains the Queen of Hearts.
The film has all the sweetness and heartache of FORREST GUMP------------and all the love and inspiration, too--------backed my lush romantic music that parallels the emotion of the characters.
If you buy only one film from the MGM Vault Classics, I'd recommend this one.",983664000,17,1356,4.654166666666667

7812957,5,6301608054,"A beautiful film, a must-see for film enthusiasts... I remember renting this movie in the 80's and being so awestruck by it.  I have always kept it in mind, but it has only recently been released on DVD.  It stands the test of time.  It is full of the exquisite details that draw you in like a passionate lover against whom you have no control.  The acting is top-notch, from the beloved Nonna to little Eddie Luca, who tells the story.  It is a story of an Italian couple who marry against everyone's wishes, for love.  It makes you laugh and cry, and you feel as though you know these characters.  Family.  Love.  Despair.  Hope.  Luck.  It is all there, and you will not be disappointed.  A lot of ground is covered here, in just under two hours.  There is a good bit of Italian spoken, but the acting is so lovely, that you don't need to know a word, to understand perfectly all that is happening.  Please see it.",1329350400,,917,4.311764705882353

7812959,5,6301608054,"A very sweet, odd, fable-like tale of Italian family surviving in 1950s London, running a little cafe;.
Wonderful performances by a cast of unknowns, and deft, surprising directorial touches.  A bit sappy
in spots, the very ending doesn't quite work for me, and the score, while intentionally over-the-top,
can be grating at times, but those few minor carps aside this is a terrific film that has a rare
sense of magic about it.

Finally released as a DVD-R with quite nice picture quality and in the correct aspect ratio.  Not
quite the full release one would wish for, but still very worth having.",1284681600,,599,4.796116504854369
