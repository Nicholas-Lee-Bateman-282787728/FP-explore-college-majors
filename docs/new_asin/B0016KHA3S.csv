3158768,5,B0016KHA3S,I loved this movie so much and I am glad I had the chance to buy this dvd.,1280793600,,74,3.1666666666666665
3158769,4,B0016KHA3S,"So since this movie doesn't really have any reviews from people who weren't involved in making it at the moment, I figured I would give my two cents. So I hadn't heard much on this movie and frankly expected crap so I must say that I was pretty pleasantly surprised. The movie does get off to a slow start, but the bulk of it is paced very well. The story is derivative of many survival horror flicks that preceded it but it still manages to be entertaining and does add a unique angle to the happenings that works very well. I don't want to say too much because it would reveal too much. The acting is pretty good, but there is a lack of nudity and bloodshed, which didn't hurt the movie too badly, but some gore would have been nice. The Lodge is a pretty solid horror flick that may not tread much new ground, but packs a rather large entertainment factor.",1269734400,21,859,4.276073619631902

3158771,5,B0016KHA3S,Great film....beautifully shot!  Very good indie movie.  Would recommend to anyone wanting something new!,1230249600,,105,6.428571428571429
3158772,2,B0016KHA3S,"With a thin story, The Lodge (2007) is a low budget suspense thriller that doesn't have very much going for it, as a couple who arrive at a ranch retreat for a romantic getaway, cross paths with serial killers.  Some spoilers follow.

The film opens with a short scene inside a house, where several people have apparently been murdered.  Moving on, we see that Michael (Owen Szabo) has arranged a stay at this isolated lodge, where he intends to propose to his girlfriend Julia (Elizabeth Kell).  Creepy caretaker Henry (Kevin McClatchy), seems unaware that they were coming, and big surprise, after some lengthy build up, the couple is abducted by Henry and his twisted daughter (Mandi Kreisher).

Having a young girl as a threat is unusual, but she doesn't really add much, to what is a very familiar tale.  Henry is so cartoonish, it's hard to believe that he's been successful at killing anyone.  Struggling to do anything intelligent, the victims are not a pair who are easy to get behind.

While The Lodge has decent enough production values, the screenplay just doesn't have much substance or originality.  If you're a casual horror fan, the film might provide a few thrills, but most horror buffs have probably seen this done much better.",1401494400,,1246,4.839622641509434

3158774,1,B0016KHA3S,"I couldn't even finish this movie, thankfully it was free with my Prime account. This was seriously one of the worst flicks I've ever seen and that's saying a LOT! This young couple, yet old enough to know better (one would think) arrive at a very expensive 10 room rental cabin only to discover the kitchen a complete mess with food splattered everywhere, food left half prepared but not cooked, a huge mess and they don't find it odd? They don't even appear upset that this expensive rental isn't not only ready for guests but a huge mess? Then of course the very strange cabin owner appears and almost immediately the boyfriend starts telling this complete stranger how great his girlfriend is in bed. What man over the age of 17 does that? (I hope not many) Then while the boyfriend is bragging yet again about how hot in the sack the girlfriend is she appears on the deck next to them in only a towel, and instead of simply turning around and going back in before she's noticed she instead makes a point to draw their attention to her just so she can say ""Oh, I shouldn't be standing out here in just a towel!"" and goes back inside. Duh! The acting is horrible, the dialogue lame to the extreme, and of course all of the obvious plot lines are there. Cell phone missing, house phone doesn't work, car won't start, etc. etc.. Oh, and when you rent a cabin you usually have it to yourself, this 'owner' seems to be there almost constantly. Who would put up with that? I'm a fan of thrillers, horror movies, etc., but this fell flat. I actually started hoping they would get killed off. I don't know if they are or not as I turned it off before I could find out. Don't waste your money renting or buying this and if you get it free, don't waste your time. Life is too short. There's even more I could tell you about how bad this movie is but hopefully you already get the idea. Move on, find another that's worth your time. There are plenty out there.",1396396800,3,1953,4.353424657534247

I am very tolerant of even bad horror and suspense movies because I can at least find something redeeming, but not in this movie.  Brutal for job apparent reason and boring.",1395705600,,253,4.555555555555555
3158776,2,B0016KHA3S,"The movie was somewhat suspenseful, but was a little too predictable.  Just trying to fill the word requirement, but have nothing more to say.",1394496000,,142,4.916666666666667
3158777,2,B0016KHA3S,"I'll start with what I liked about the movie... It was nice to see a cabin like this. We've stayed in similar cabins when vacationing and they are wonderful. I was expecting to see more cabins in the area and maybe a tourist oriented downtown shopping area with markets and such - maybe more recreation opportunities with rental boats and fishing gear. We've not stayed in cabins that were outfitted with fishing gear, boats, etc. that belonged to the same property. Usually such things are locked up for the owner to use. In that sense, it didn't seem very realistic. It was too isolated, which made it obvious that something horrific was going to happen.

I chose this rating because I simply didn't like all the gore at the end. The beginning seemed like a wheel spinning in the mud - wasn't getting anywhere. There were tiny hints that something wasn't quite right - eventually they added up and the viewer was able to figure out what happened - once the plot came to light, the whole movie crashes. All of the blood and gore comes out. I'm not a professional movie director or story developer but I am an avid fan of good stories - written or filmed. I saw that the movie was too slow in its development of the story and then crashes too quickly once the conflict is revealed. The rest of the movie becomes chase and slash - which I hate. Another problem was that I tend to be a fan of supernatural, not slasher movies. This wasn't supernatural at all. That was a disappointment.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone I know. Someone who likes slash and gore movies might like this one but I don't know anyone like that.",1393718400,,1630,4.484848484848484
3158778,1,B0016KHA3S,"This seems to be a well established trend at this point in American horror films.  Create a strong/smart/hip/tough female lead that turns the tables on a sadistic, misogynistic bad guy, while at the same time rescuing any inept, beta male, losers in the vicinity.  In one scene, the female lead doubts her decision to skip her kick boxing class, as her decidedly love struck boyfriend tries awkwardly to prove his worth(again) to her.  From the lame ""cat and mouse"" scenes to the torture lair, complete with chainsaw and blood spattered walls, this pile stunk.  This movie did help to improve my multi tasking.  I was able to make a snack, check the weather for next week, take a bathroom break, and do some light reading, all without losing sight of where this heap of film wreckage would come to rest! I noticed one of the reviewers was the director.  He gave the movie a modest 5 stars.

3158781,1,B0016KHA3S,"To save you some time, let me put this movie in a sentence. It is two idiots who go to stay in a cabin and are confronted with two idiot killers. The lines are corny, the acting is positively bad, and the script is rather dry. Most of the time you are watching them walk around the house, but its all just filler. They could have probably saved some time and made this 30 minutes long.",1384041600,5,385,4.078947368421052

3158783,2,B0016KHA3S,"For what it is this wasn't completely terrible.  It seemed more polished than some similar movies of this type.  Having said that, I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone and probably wouldn't watch it again.  There wasn't much suspense:  I was waiting for what I expected to happen to happen, and it took a long time for anything to happen.  I do want to say that the acting was not terrible.  I think all of the actors did a decent job with the script they were given but I thought the dialogue was a little weak and seemed at times contrived.

Yeah. That's about how creepy the entire movie feels, like a well lit room in the middle of the day.

3158796,2,B0016KHA3S,"This is another worn out ""been there done that"" a million times before story that needs to be laid to rest! There is not much of a story or plot to The Lodge just the ever so basic couple in a lodge in the woods fighting for survival from ??? The acting, direction and story are so...so. but the limited landscape shots are a nice break in this slow and uneven paced movie. Some of the production values were good like the camera work, image quality and the landscape shots. The cast members playing the couple are likeable as well as believable and the ??? do a fair job too.  There is a twist or two to the story, but it is not near enough to raise this movie out of its dormant slumber or to raise your pulse rate above resting. There is a scene of rape that cuts away after some physcial abuse and leaves the viewer to fill in the blanks and there are other violent scenes with a younger person that are are cut in the simular manner . There is a limited amount of gore used in a few scenes and the violence is not over the top nor is it non stop. This is just another blah-blah-blah-blah oh, so transparent and predictable of a story that I am falling asleep writing this review. Was this worth the time? No, but the mountain scenery was nice to see. 1.8 stars

3158798,1,B0016KHA3S,Let me save you some time. Absolutely nothing happens from the ten minute mark to the 43 minute mark. This might be acceptable if the dialogue or plot were clever or even half way decent... but they're not. The attempts at character development are extremely contrived. I am almost positive this movie was written by someone that was high as balls because that's the only way this movie could be scary or that the plot could have any semblance of being interesting. That or if you were a nine year old girl. Based on the lack of acting skills I get the impression that playing a screw-up whose father is disappointed in him wasn't much of a stretch for the male protagonist. The only decent piece of acting in this movie was the scene where the antagonist was slapping female protagonist around and I'm guessing that's only because he was just as sick of her terrible acting as I was. I kept waiting for it to get better. It did not.,1372550400,,933,4.461988304093567
3158799,1,B0016KHA3S,"The Lodge is one more film about being trapped in a remote location with a psychopath. When you are going to do a movie that has been done before--a thousand times--you have to have something special. The Lodge really does not. The two heroes of the film are pretty run of the mill: a wannabe musician and his buxom girlfriend. Even amidst the slow, paused beginning half of the movie, these two characters don't build a connection with the viewer. Instead, they are pretty much the type of character that you would expect to be the first victims in a horror film (the ones no one cares about). While most horror movies are predictable, this one is especially so. There is not a single moment in the movie that you did not expect. I think there is one element of the story that was supposed to come as a surprise, but it really doesn't. Overall, it's too bland to be a horror film and too slow and predictable to be a thriller.",1371859200,,927,4.395348837209302

3158801,1,B0016KHA3S,"The movie has a very slow pace throughout.  I found myself bored but kept hoping it would pick up.  The actors didn't seem very scared, happy, or much of anything....they seemed bored.  When the ""bad guy"" was revealed...he was rather boring.  Considering all the psycho/sociopathic killers featured in movies this one was very bland.  His looks (no mask made of human flesh) and his actions (no derranged orphan who killed off everyone) were very vanilla.  The bad guy even died very easily, no tense, end of your seat, struggle to the death fight.  The only interesting point in the movie was the girl with the bad guy; but the movie never gave much information about her.",1291420800,5,673,4.75

There wasn't much suspense:  I was waiting for what I expected to happen to happen, and it took a long time for anything to happen.  I do want to say that the acting was not terrible.  I think all of the actors did a decent job with the script they were given but I thought the dialogue was a little weak and seemed at times contrived.

There is not much of a story or plot to The Lodge just the ever so basic couple in a lodge in the woods fighting for survival from ??? The acting, direction and story are so...so. but the limited landscape shots are a nice break in this slow and uneven paced movie. Some of the production values were good like the camera work, image quality and the landscape shots. The cast members playing the couple are likeable as well as believable and the ??? do a fair job too.  There is a twist or two to the story, but it is not near enough to raise this movie out of its dormant slumber or to raise your pulse rate above resting. There is a scene of rape that cuts away after some physcial abuse and leaves the viewer to fill in the blanks and there are other violent scenes with a younger person that are are cut in the simular manner . There is a limited amount of gore used in a few scenes and the violence is not over the top nor is it non stop. This is just another blah-blah-blah-blah oh, so transparent and predictable of a story that I am falling asleep writing this review. Was this worth the time? No, but the mountain scenery was nice to see. 1.8 stars

3393295,1,B0016KHA3S,Let me save you some time. Absolutely nothing happens from the ten minute mark to the 43 minute mark. This might be acceptable if the dialogue or plot were clever or even half way decent... but they're not. The attempts at character development are extremely contrived. I am almost positive this movie was written by someone that was high as balls because that's the only way this movie could be scary or that the plot could have any semblance of being interesting. That or if you were a nine year old girl. Based on the lack of acting skills I get the impression that playing a screw-up whose father is disappointed in him wasn't much of a stretch for the male protagonist. The only decent piece of acting in this movie was the scene where the antagonist was slapping female protagonist around and I'm guessing that's only because he was just as sick of her terrible acting as I was. I kept waiting for it to get better. It did not.,1372550400,,933,4.461988304093567
3393296,1,B0016KHA3S,"The Lodge is one more film about being trapped in a remote location with a psychopath. When you are going to do a movie that has been done before--a thousand times--you have to have something special. The Lodge really does not. The two heroes of the film are pretty run of the mill: a wannabe musician and his buxom girlfriend. Even amidst the slow, paused beginning half of the movie, these two characters don't build a connection with the viewer. Instead, they are pretty much the type of character that you would expect to be the first victims in a horror film (the ones no one cares about). While most horror movies are predictable, this one is especially so. There is not a single moment in the movie that you did not expect. I think there is one element of the story that was supposed to come as a surprise, but it really doesn't. Overall, it's too bland to be a horror film and too slow and predictable to be a thriller.",1371859200,,927,4.395348837209302

3393298,1,B0016KHA3S,"The movie has a very slow pace throughout.  I found myself bored but kept hoping it would pick up.  The actors didn't seem very scared, happy, or much of anything....they seemed bored.  When the ""bad guy"" was revealed...he was rather boring.  Considering all the psycho/sociopathic killers featured in movies this one was very bland.  His looks (no mask made of human flesh) and his actions (no derranged orphan who killed off everyone) were very vanilla.  The bad guy even died very easily, no tense, end of your seat, struggle to the death fight.  The only interesting point in the movie was the girl with the bad guy; but the movie never gave much information about her.",1291420800,5,673,4.75

It was nearly like trying to watch something with blurred vision, and was occasionally outright pixelated. I tested various possible causes, including simply playing a different movie from Amazon. When that movie looked fine, I realized it must just be The Lodge. So I decided to try it in HD. There was absolutely NO difference in the quality. So I'm very disappointed that I wasted money trying to watch something that isn't worth watching, not because of the movie itself, but because of the lack of visual quality.",1430611200,,656,4.7631578947368425
