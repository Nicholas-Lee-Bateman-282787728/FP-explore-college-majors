1712598,5,B000066E8E,Great video.  Follows the Taegeuk Poomses perfectly.  You will have to do a lot of rewinding because they go through the motions quickly but if you can handle that you'll learn them quickly.,1167868800,5,190,4.7272727272727275
1712599,5,B000066E8E,Both of my Children ( ages 10 & 11 ) are Red belts in Taekwondo and love to compete. This DVD provides a very clear step by step presentation of the forms that is easy to understand. They absolutely love it!,1141344000,3,207,4.073170731707317
1712600,5,B000066E8E,"This DVD has gotten me through more than one belt test. It's a great way to review each poomse at home so you don't have to spend a lot time bothering the higher ranking students in your class for help when you forget a movement. I use it to practice each new form as I learn it from my instructor and to review all of my lower belt forms for testing. The different views (front, side, rear, etc) make it easy to see the movements and Master Kim's performance is top notch. Just don't let anyone borrow your copy or you'll have to nag them to get it back.",1118880000,25,555,4.10091743119266
1712601,4,B000066E8E,"This video by Master Sang H Kim is an excellent review of the first 8 WTF forms for colored belt testing.  As such, it does not teach the basics (how to step, block, punch, etc).  Instead it gives three demonstrations on how to perform the form (at full speed) and a step by step walkthrough.  I have found it very beneficial to my review of forms, and have learned some new ones which were not included in my training. I use it on a regular basis and recommend it.

That being said, the production quality is not the highest, and it appears to have been filmed in someone's backyard (a very nice backyard, however!). However, the purpose of the video is to review forms in a concise educational manner, and I feel that an excellent job was done with this goal in mind.",1114560000,14,769,4.356643356643357
1712602,5,B000066E8E,Please note that the edited errors mentioned in earlier reviews have been corrected quite some time ago and the DVD you will receive is error free.,1088726400,8,147,4.6923076923076925
1712603,5,B000066E8E,"I had this title on video and it was one of the first DVDs I bought after getting my player for christmas. Not only is the DVD picture clearer and sharper, the audio quality is better than on the tape as well.
But the best part is the way the menu lets you jump around without spending time searching by way of fast forward or rewind. If you're reviewing for a test or need a quick refresher of the forms, you can work on #4 then jump right to #2 or #8 without having to keep stopping and checking for the form you need, like you would with a tape. I also liked the bonus footage of the applications. While we don't practice these at my school, it's nice to know what the movements are supposed to be for. A great DVD - I definitely recommend to anyone doing WTF style TKD.",1050278400,14,773,4.092105263157895
1712604,5,B000066E8E,"I got my black belt in ITF style taekwondo and have recently moved to a WTF style. I bought this DVD to learn the WTF forms to test for black belt at my new school and in less than four months, I'm up to red belt level. This is a great learning tool. I can practice at home without bothering my instrutor or the upper belts at my new school. Sang H. Kim's performance is very crisp and his instruction is detailed and goes beyond just do this move then do that move. He explains the little things that will help you make your performance above average. My instructor has complimented me more than once on my forms and I credit this DVD with helping me perfect the little things as well as the sequence of the movements.",1040860800,12,719,4.217391304347826
1712605,5,B000066E8E,"The DVD is an awesome format for martial arts instructional tapes and this DVD makes full use of the format's advantages. Each form is shown from side and front, with slow motion and step by step instructional views. The best part is, you can use the menu to go directly to the poomse you're working on without having to fast forward like you would on a tape. There is one minor production glitch - the first poomse, Taegeuk Il Jang has Taeguek Ee Jang shown in the follow along view. This shouldn't affect your use of the DVD however, because you can just as easily follow along with the instructional view, which is the same view but with a step by step instructional voice over. Overall, the best poomse reference out there, and I've seen quite a few!",1031788800,8,754,4.471014492753623
1712606,2,B000066E8E,I purchased this video for my 8 yr old who has a green belt.  The master's accent is hard to understand.  If you turn the sound off it's better.  Wish I had not bought this.  Would be good for someone oler.,1340668800,,206,3.951219512195122
1712607,5,B000066E8E,As a TaeKwonDo practioner this dvd is a great tool to keep the correct form pattern in my mind. Thanks for creating such a usefull tool.,1332374400,,136,4.269230769230769
1712608,4,B000066E8E,"I found the DVD to be very useful in reviewing forms that I know.  I would not think it would work so well for those who have not previously done the forms.  All in all, though, worth the price.  Delivered quickly and in good order.",1297987200,,232,4.111111111111111
1712609,5,B000066E8E,This DVD has been very helpful to me as I review the forms to get ready for my Black Belt test. I would highly recommend it since it give a good explanation of each form and then even shows you both a front and side view of the form.,1238284800,,233,3.7755102040816326
1712610,5,B000066E8E,"Kim goes through the forms too fast for someone who's just trying to learn each form.  I can pause and then fast forward on my DVD player, which makes the DVD play in slow motion.  If it wasn't for that, I would be very frustrated at the fast pace.  Nonetheless, I love the DVD, it's extremely helpful.",1229299200,,302,4.2631578947368425
1712611,5,B000066E8E,I bought this for my son to help review his forms for his black belt test and he has improved a lot! Even his teacher commented that the improvement in just a week was remarkable.,1225584000,,179,4.142857142857143
1712612,4,B000066E8E,"When I first found this DVD, there was not a lot of resources for learning Poomsae outside of the dojang that I knew of.  I would learn the forms in class, and just have to remember them.  I often wished for a quick review as I was preparing for a belt test.

Now that I am not actively practicing TaeKwonDo, but a different Korean Martial Art, it has still been important to demonstrate my previous knowledge of TKD forms.  This DVD makes for an excellent review, and Master Kim has excellent form that you can use to correct or alter your movements.  As has been pointed out on previous reviews, it does not teach the proper technique for different strikes, blocks and footwork/stances, it merely demonstrates them.  As such, it is not a replacement for learning the poomsae in class, but it will greatly accelerate your ability to learn and remember them  (even when you want to relearn them years later!)",1219708800,,908,4.60248447204969
1712613,4,B000066E8E,"The DVD is a great learning aid for anyone wanting to learn these basic Poomse. However, I would strongly recommend a book or another graphic form of learning aid to be used in conjunction with this DVD, as the forms are repeated 3 times in total (fast, with explanation and fast from a side view). The exact footwork, technique, chart-type movement of the form etc, are not explicitly shown, so it will be rather difficult learning these forms perfectly using only this DVD without prior knowledge of the forms. But for what the DVD is, it forms a great help in learning these forms. Definately recommended!",1209945600,,608,4.745283018867925
1712614,5,B000066E8E,"This was a indispensible resource for my husband who hates practicing forms. ( He likes sparring instead) He really needed to get them right for his testing and he found the presentation helpful, as well as the review function.",1194739200,2,227,4.846153846153846
1712615,5,B000066E8E,"This instructional DVD has got me thru all my TKD belt tests with the ROK Marines who are our instructors. That said, it will help anyone willing to study. Quality is top-notch. It first introduces each Poomse and follows by a step-by-step section and then a complete front view and then a complete side view. I've watched this DVD for my tests and before each training session. Turtlepress.com has not failed me yet!",1186790400,4,417,4.726027397260274

7962289,5,B000066E8E,one of the best Taekwondo videos out there,1428710400,,42,4.375
7962290,5,B000066E8E,"This video is incredibly helpful in learning TKD. The moves are crisp and correct. I appreciate that shoulder and hip position, footwork and balance are shown correctly! That is a rare find... Most of the preview clips in the beginning are also on Prime and there are even some good applications of some of the form movements in some of the Turtle Press videos. Poomsae is all about building body awareness and coordination. This is a great resource!",1424995200,,450,4.782051282051282
7962291,1,B000066E8E,"Disappointed. We really need a video that shows the form from rearview. It is very hard for my son to follow along when he has to move in the opposite direction. I do not understand why no one makes a video that shows that view, it drives me crazy. This one is full of previews for other videos and then it only shows the forms from front and side view, very hard to follow along and learn them correctly.",1422057600,,405,4.139240506329114
7962292,4,B000066E8E,good helped with forms,1421625600,,22,4.75
7962293,4,B000066E8E,It was easy to follow and makes it unnessary for private lessons Taekondo Teegeuk Pooms # 1-8 would highly recommend,1385337600,,116,4.85
7962294,5,B000066E8E,This DVD has helped me perfect my TKD forms.  At testing time it is a great resource.  Three More Words.,1378252800,,104,4.15
7962295,4,B000066E8E,"Even though the first 18 minutes is set aside for advertising other DVD's, I found this instruction helpful.

I have a lot of Master Kim's DVD's and they are all first rate.

On this one, as in most of his products, he goes over the forms several times so that you get it from all angles.

Highly recommended.",1371168000,3,309,4.293103448275862
7962296,5,B000066E8E,Taking my 8th in June and have really learned a lot.  If you are in to fine tuning your poomse this is a good one to watch for both a beginner and advanced.,1364169600,,156,3.727272727272727
