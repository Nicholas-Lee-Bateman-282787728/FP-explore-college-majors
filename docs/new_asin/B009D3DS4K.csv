8539889,5,B009D3DS4K,Virtual Active always offers great indoor virtual runs or in this case Spin Bike runs. I have many of these and they make indoor workouts so much more fun.,1461283200,,155,4.379310344827586
8539890,5,B009D3DS4K,"I didn't know Utah was so beautiful.  This is my favorite ride of the 4 Jim Karanas' dvds.  No one and I mean no one does a virtual ride as well as he does.  I have all four of his indoor cycling dvd's and they are top notch.  The music keeps you going.  His instruction is excellent, peppered with training information that motivates you to want to ride.  He includes information about where you are riding too.",1442102400,,412,4.285714285714286
8539891,5,B009D3DS4K,"This DVD is exactly what I was looking for.  Though other DVDs have elements I like, this one seems to have it all.

This DVD provides a solid work out.  It is geared toward intermediate spinners.  HOWEVER, if you are a beginner don't let that scare you off from buying it as you can easily adjust the resistance or speed to better match your skills.  There is a decent amount of variety to the workout with differing speeds and resistances both in and out of the saddle.

The menu allows some customization. It is broken into two 30 minute workouts with one taking place in Utah and the other Arizona.  You can choose just one of the 30 minute segments or combine them for a 60 minute workout with a 5 minute cool down.  In addition you can choose to have the instructor provide direction or you can turn off the instruction.

Visually it is stunning. I appreciate that the workout aligns with what you are seeing on the screen.  So when the voice tells you to increase the resistance and get up out of the saddle like you are going up a hill, you see a hill on the screen.  (Surprisingly, I have seen other DVDs similar to this where there is no correlation between the workout and the image on the screen).

Jim Karanas is the voice providing instruction.  Occasionally he throws in a comment about the scenery without going overboard with it.  I also like that Jim provides occasional encouragement without being hokey or trying to be pseudo spiritual like some of the DVDs by Mad Dogg athletics.

Another nice touch is the subtle blinking light with the cadence.  If you don't have a cycling computer, you can achieve the cadence the instructor provides by watching the blinking light.  If there were one change I would suggest it would be to provide more instruction around heart rate.  I recently purchased a heart rate monitor and like the DVDs that specifically tell you what % of heart rate you should be operating in.

You cant go wrong with this DVD.",1426550400,4,1962,4.5227272727272725
