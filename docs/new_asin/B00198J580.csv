3424872,3,B00198J580,"If you like many, many, many old cartoons from Hollywood's golden era drifted into ""Publicdomainland"", you will surely like this pack (I enjoyed it). But if you like to watch old cartoons in good prints, or at least in passable prints, then, though you still would like it, forget it! (There are some things in good prints, but these are the very minority)

Apart from the aforementioned, this mega-pack also contains some avoidable TV entries (1950s-80s) and many, many unclassified rarities from around the world (even not animated).",1264550400,2,535,5.079545454545454
3424873,4,B00198J580,"The pros:
This set contains an extraordinary amount of material -- more than 5 hours per DVD, and as such is an oustanding value for the price. The cartoons range in quality from execrable or grotesque all the way to breathtakingly beautiful artistic treasures. They also range in time from the 1920s to the 1950s, some possibly from the 60s. Even the poorer cartoons are interesting as illustrations of cartooning history. This is a wonderful set of cartoons!
The (only) cons:
The disks are cheaply made. Some are so poorly made that in one of my video players (a top-of-the line Pioneer stand-alone DVD burner with hard drive) the disks vibrated so much after loading that they came into contact with the optical mechanism carrier and accumulated more scratches with each loading. Not good. One disk refused to play altogether on my Pioneer machine, but did successfully load in a cheaper JVC DVD player. Ultimately, such disks would soon self-destruct from cumulative damage. This is unfortunate, as otherwise the product is attractively packaged, and even the disk labels are beautiful. The contents, as described previously, are beautiful and an oustanding value.
My suggestion is that this set is definitely worth buying, but that you should make yourself backup copies of the disks (provided that this is legal in your area) if you really wish to keep this material playable. Play the backup copies. I've never had any recordable DVDs vibrate or get scratched in any of my DVD players. A great little utility which permits making backup copies, even of copy-protected DVDs, is AnyDVD, in conjunction with a utility called CloneDVD. Both are available at a modest price from a company called slysoft. I've been using these for some years and have found them reliable and a great value. Please be aware that CloneDVD can't copy physically damaged disks, so make backups *before* your originals are damaged. Some DVD burning software (such as Record Now DX) is capable of duplicating slightly damaged disks.
Good luck and happy cartoon watching!

An update to my review: I went to Mill Creek Entertainment's web site, which listed email addresses for customers to contact, and sent an email to customer service describing the quality problems with their disks. I promptly received a very apologetic and helpful email offering to mail me replacement disks for any defective ones. They even said that I didn't have to mail them back the defective disks. They also stated that they would be contacting their manufacturer to investigate this disk quality problem.

How about that for old-fashioned customer service? Just try to get a replacement for a defective DVD from the bigger studios -- good luck; some don't even list any email address for their customers to contact them. Not only does Mill Creek produce DVD sets of cartoons and old movies, all of which are an excellent value, but they have demonstrated great respect for their customers -- all at a very modest price. In my opinion, this company really deserves our business.",1264118400,12,3036,5.00990099009901

Cartoon characters include The Little King, Felix the Cat, Toonerville Trolley, Betty Boop, Popeye, Casper, Little Lulu, Farmer Alfalfa, and Dick & Larry aka Tom & Jerry (not the cat and mouse).

3424879,4,B00198J580,I bought this dvd at wm for a little over $10. You may not know some of the cartoons. But that don't matter to my 2 yr old grandson. To me it is well worth the $10 I payed for it,1223769600,6,178,3.3658536585365852
3424880,3,B00198J580,"For anyone familiar with other Mill Creek collections, this is pretty standard. It's a collection of 600 cartoons, of frequently middling video quality and unknown provenance (i.e. you may being seeing the version originally shown, or the version edited for TV 30 years later). The collection is indiscriminate--""Destination Earth"" is a propaganda piece by the oil industry, for example--but most of them are fairly typical cartoons. If you have other cartoon collections, this probably overlaps them, if it doesn't include them. Many of these cartoons are available online from legit sources.

Being familiar with Mill Creek, my worst problem with this set was organization. There's no good reason to spread series across several disks, mixed in with other cartoons. No disk is filled by cartoons with one character or by one series, and one typical example, the Popeye cartoons, have 30 cartoons on one disk, 6 on another, and one more on its lonesome.

Is it worth it? If you have to have just about every cartoon released in these ""public domain"" cartoon collections in one neat box, then this is your box. If you don't have any ""public domain"" cartoon collections and want to see one, this will begin and just about end your collection. You might want to grab a few DVDs at a dollar store first, to see if it's to your taste. If you're looking for a decent collection of almost any of the Warner Brothers or Disney characters, then don't look here; little of their work is available here, and it's not the good shorts. If you're looking for beautifully restored film, likewise, you need to look at pricier, smaller sets; this set averages okay with some pretty bad stretches, and at no point has seen careful restoration.",1223078400,158,1726,4.887372013651877

3424895,5,B00198J580,"This set was so much fun. Me and my partner watched all 12 of the disc and didn't miss a single cartoon.

Popeye (Mostly color some Black and White)
Popeye was really fun and there was tons of it to go around (on disc 1, 5 and 8). You got to see all your favorite characters. Popeye the manly but gullible sailor, Olive Oyl who is probably the dumbest woman in cartoon history, Bluto who is just plain conniving and mean, Popeye's nephews who are always causing trouble and of course my favorite Wimpy who seems to magically pull hamburgers out of God-only-knows where and never seems to have the money to pay for them. If your a fan of Popeye get this set.

Betty Boop (Black and White)
The classic flapper girl always puts a smile on your face. This set shows her in a wide variety of situations (on disc 1 and 4). Few of her early cartooons are on here but there is tons about Pudgey who is one of the most adorable pets on television and Grampy who never fails to leave a smile on your face. For Betty Boop fans I highly recommend the episodes ""So does an Automobile"" which is just a hilarious look at the automotive industry and ""Betty Boop and Grampy"" which is all about everyone going to a giant dance party at Grampy's house and everyone leaving their very important jobs to go. You won't be disappointed. If your a fan of Betty Boop this set is for you.

Tom and Jerry (Black and White)
This is not the MGM cat and mouse you are familiar with but it is surprisingly good. These are two ridiculously funny characters who take us on some pretty wacky adventures. Including going to the swiss alps where we learn the holes in swiss cheese are caused by shotgun fire. These cartoons can be found on disc 2 and 5 and I really enjoyed this cartoon. This has quite a large portion of those shorts so if you like it you might wan't this set. There might be larger sets out there though.

Mr. Piper (Color)
Mr. Piper is a fun guy who tells you all kinds of kid's stories. This is a fairly recent cartoon compared to most on this box set. The stories were excellent and filled with good morals for children. There are great stories like Ali Baba (which is also told in a Popeye cartoon) and The Tin Soldier. The complete series is on here and it is a great show to tell your children a story to get them ready for bed. You can find it on Disc 2 and Disc 6.

The Three Stooges (Color)
Awesome. Love It. Hilariously funny. Recommend it for everybody. This is the cartoon version of your favorite slapstick stars. If you enjoy the Three Stooges cartoon this set is definitely for you.  There is even some live action parts from your favorite stars. There are great recurring characters like the bear that always stealing food, littering or refusing to take a bath and the termite that ate every tree in site. The Three Stooges can be found on disc 2, 4 and 12 and there is a ton of it to go around.

Casper (Color)
Casper is probably one of the most mature cartoons on the set. Unlike the other cartoons there is little to laugh at as a matter a fact it can be down right depressing. However the storylines are very engaging and more than other cartoons I felt very connected to the characters. The seriousness of the series was actually quite a nice change considering the comedy from the rest of the set. Just prepare with tissues for this one. There isn't a lot of Casper on the set but there are 5 episodes spread between disc 2 and 5. While I don't recommend this for Casper fans if you like other shows and also Casper you won't be disappointed.

Herman (Color)
Herman is an often-forgotten classic that when you see you'll wonder how you could forget such brilliance. This show has many catchy tunes and tons of engaging characters. If you like the MGM Tom and Jerry you will probably enjoy this show. There are 5 episodes on disc 2 and disc 9. If you like Herman the Mouse this certainly won't disappoint but there isn't alot there.

Gabby (Color)
Gabby is really fun and has an extremely catching tune. There are many adventures you won't forget including ""All's Well"" and ""Gabby Goes Fishing"". This character has been all but forgotten but I really think deserves to be rediscovered. I was laughing quite a bit at this little cartoon and think kids will love it. There are 7 episodes spread between disc 2 and 5.

Little Audrey and Little Lulu (Color)
These cartoons are about little girls and their crazy imaginations. I put these two together because if you like one you'll probably like the other as they are both about little girls who are constantly getting into mischief. There isn't much of these shows but the content that is on here is good. Little Audrey and Little Lulu can be found on disc 2 and disc 5.

Felix the Cat (Almost completely in Black and White with a couple Color episodes)
I'm going to be very frank about this. The surrealism reminds me of an acid trip such as traveling through telephone wires and turning his tail into a saxophone. Felix was tons of fun but one of the most confusing cartoons I'd ever seen. If you want to stretch your imagination don't bother with the other cartoons this has enough imagination to make Spongebob's head spin.  This is an excellent show and I do recommend it. There are 14 cartoons on this set mostly on disc 5 and 7 but with some also on disc 2 and one on disc 11. There is whole lot of Felix the cat and fans of old-school Felix won't be disappointed in the least.

Mr. Bang, Katrinka, the Skipper (Color)
This cartoon is all about a wacky trolley driver who has some pretty wacky adventures. We thought it was hilarious and wish there was more on the set. There are only 3 cartoons on disc 2 and we would recommend all of them.

Oswald Rabbit and Alice (Black and White)
These are all pre-Mickey Mouse Walt Disney cartoons. Oswald Rabbit will remind you much of Mickey Mouse and might very well be the precursor.  It seems that they share many characteristics in common and if Mickey hadn't existed Oswald Rabbit would certainly be the mascot for Disney. Alice (also known as Alice Comedies) is a semi-live action comedic romp through the world of non-sense. These cartoons will show you pre-Mickey Disney and what made Walt Disney into the mogul he is. There are 3 episodes of Oswald Rabbit on disc 5 and 9 Alice Comedies between Disc 5 and Disc 9.

Hunky and Spunky (Color)
This story follows the life of a donkey and his mother doing donkey things like learning to kick and fighting off flies. There are 6 episodes on Disc 6.  I think you will enjoy this series once you past the weird semi-human semi-donkey talk.

Calvin and the Colonel (Black and White)
Calvin and the Colonel is an invigorating cartoon about the adventures of a anthropomorphic southern bear and fox. These two always get into trouble and the best characters is probably the Colonel's sister in-law who hates just about everyone and acts as a comic relief in an already comedic show. If you enjoy Calvin and the Colonel don't hesitate. This is definitely the set for you. There are 8 episodes evenly split between disc 7 and 11.

Clutch Cargo
This show is among the most interesting on the set. Engaging serial storylines filled with as much action as a James Bond film with the wackiness of Austin Powers this show is absolutely amazing. Many people will find it difficult to get used to the animation style which is very minimalist however this has engaging storylines and characters and if you are a fan of Clutch Cargo this set is definitely for you. There are tons of episodes on Disc 7 and Disc 11 and you won't be disappointed.

Aesop's Fables and Farmer Alfalfa (Black and White)
I don't know the difference between these two cartoons but I can tell you they remind me of Felix the Cat with many odd stories and lots of animals. There is tons of this show on disc 7 and disc 9. This show can be tedious and drag on and I didn't like it as much as the others but someone will probably enjoy it.

Space Angel
This show is probably created by the same people who made Clutch Cargo considering the animation style similarities. The only sets are about a planet full of ghosts and a mischevious ghost who stowaways on the ship. This show is completely on Disc 7 and only contains one story.

Blackie the Lamb (Color)
There are two episodes on Disc 7 and they seem to be an average old cartoon about a black sheep trying to defend the other sheep from a wolf.

Snap, Crackle & Pop and Cinderella
These are both basically advertisements. One for Rice Crispies and the other for Chevrolet. There is only one each of these cartoons both on Disc 7. These are much better than most commercials and I think you'll enjoy it.

Little Gray Neck
I don't remember much about this but it seemed to be about a duck that was stuck in the forest for the winter and had to fight off predators. It was pretty good and kinda funny.

Fraidy Cat (Color)
The story revolves around a cat being chased by his past lives. They appear when he says a number between 1 and 8 and try to help him but generally make things worse. This is a great show for children and is good enough for adults to watch. When he says 9 he get chased by his current life in the form of a lightning storm. He is afraid of losing his last life. This show was a great edition to the set and although its only on  disc there is plenty of it.

Gumby
Yes! This is the 1960's classic you are all familiar with. Gumby and his trusty sidekick Pokey go on many adventures. My favorite being the one where he takes some musical notes and try's to find there home in Musicland. I also enjoyed when he used robots to try and cheat on his chores with disasterous results. Gumby can be found on disc 8 with 14 cartoons.

Hoppity Hooper
There are a whoppin 40 episodes of this great great show on this set. Made by the same people who made Rocky and Bullwinkle you are going to love this cartoon. With a frog who's fairly clueless about everything everything that's going on and a Mischievous Waldo Wigglesworth and dimwitted Filmore pretending to be his relatives this is quite the adventure. Waldo always manages to come up with some scheme that eventually backfires and Filmore is great comic relief with his bugle. I highly recommend fans of this cartoon get this set.

Wizard of Oz
This is pretty much the only way you can see this cartoon. It was okay but not my favorite.

Moonbird
This cartoon was awful. The worst on the set. I couldn't stand it. There voices gave me a headache and I couldn't make heads or tails from the storyline. If I was to rate this cartoon it would get a 1/5. I would rather fork my own eyes out than watch watch this.

Wacky and Packy
Wacky and Packy is a cartoon about a wooley mammoth and a caveman who get brought into the future where they have no idea what is going on. They are constantly looking for food and always getting in trouble. I really enjoyed this cartoon and am so glad it is on this set. Wacky and Packy can be found on Disc 9.

Colonel Bleep
Colonel Bleep was an old cartoon. One of the first on television. It's kind of a rediculous fantasy/sci-fi story about an alien. The characters themselves rarely talk but the narration makes the cartoon worth it. The narration is absolutely rediculous and reminds me of someone who shouts at the screen in a movie theater. This show can be found on Disc 10.

George Pal Puppetoons
I enjoyed this show. It would be great to help your kids get into the arts. There is only about 5 episodes on Disc 10.

Mel-o-Toons
What to say about these cartoons. So much history. Teaches you all about the history of music and has some great folk stories in it as well.

Christmas Cartoons and others
There is quite a variety of Christmas cartoons on this set. Most are enjoyable. I particularly liked The Little Match Girl and an amazing Christmas cartoon about a small donkey who devolps a relationship with a mouse. There is also a good one about a russian kid trying to deliver a Christmas Tree to Antarctica. Aside from Christmas Cartoons there are various other cartoons on the set including one each of Mighty Mouse and Woody Woodpecker and tons of screen songs the early version of the sing-a-long.

Final Notes on the set.
These cartoons are not censored they reflect values of their time and many people will find racist, sexist, homophobic and adultist content on this set. However if you are able to look past this I think just about everybody could find a reason to love this set. If you have questions about the set I'm more than willing to answer. At only $10-$14 you can't go wrong with 63 hours of excellent cartoons. Happy Viewing! Your friend, Angel",1459814400,9,12633,4.416165090283749
3424896,3,B00198J580,"Most of the cartoons in this collection are in pretty good shape.  Only one cartoon listed as included was not included (The Gay Gaucho).  However, some cartoons are mis-classified (Famous Studios listed as Fleischer and vice versa) and some of the videos included are not animated cartoons at all.  There are some puppet segments, and some live-action Christmas segments with a little stop-motion.  Most of the cartoons are from the thirties, but some from the twenties, forties, and sixties are also included.  Many of the cartoons included are very obscure, like Paul Terry's Aesop's Fables from before the Terrytoon era, and some Pat Sullivan and Ub Iwerks shorts.  The Tom and Jerry cartoons listed are not with the well-known cat and mouse, but with the earlier characters by those names.  Many cartoons are missing their credits.  (Note that a number of the Official Films shorts were made by Van Beuren, while others were created by other studios.)  Given the price and the number of cartoons on this collection, I would recommend this collection to anyone interested in the less-known animation studios.  This collection may not be suitable for children... since many Betty Boop and Three Stooges cartoons are included.  (Most of the other cartoons seem fine.)

If you're looking for a specific old cartoon, you should be able to find it here. There are hundreds of memorable and even forgettable cartoons. They don't show them on television much and it's a shame.  Television programmers have forgotten the art of programming for younger audiences today. Otherwise, younger children would never be able to enjoy them if they're not exposed to them. If I could, I would probably look for DVDs including ""The Three Stooges"" and ""Popeye"" in cartoons.",1445299200,,2553,4.955607476635514

3424911,4,B00198J580,"The biggest problem with the set is organization. I highly recommend, if you have the patience and the tech knowledge, ripping these to your computer with MakeMKV, splitting them up with mkvmerge (or those two steps at once with Handbrake if you don't mind transcoding), and then
naming and organizing the files in a more useful way. I've just finished doing exactly that, which though it took a few days, gave me a good look at what's in the set.

And boy is it an interesting selection. Pretty sure most if not all of these are in the public domain, meaning you could get them for free on Internet Archive or Youtube or elsewhere. But seems like the versions on this set are usually a little better quality, and for goodness sake it's only 10 dollars. Anyway, the 600 is about half Golden Age theatrical shorts and half later Saturday morning cartoon type stuff. I'm not so interested in the TV animation (does anyone want 50+ episodes of The New 3 Stooges?) although Gumby and Colonel Bleep are pretty fun. For shorts it is a veritable feast. There are oodles of Fleischer, Paramount/Famous/Harvey, and Van Beuren; some silent stuff like Felix the Cat and Disney's Alice series; here and there a few from Walter Lantz, Ub Iwerks, Terrytoons; stop-motion from George Pal and Ray Harryhausen; even a couple Russian things, some from Halas & Batchelor (the British studio that made ""Animal Farm""), and some artsy stuff like Rene Laloux's ""Les escargots"", Art Clokey's ""Gumbasia"", and the Oscar winner ""Moonbird"". Rounding things out are the occasional educational or industrial film and some Christmas shorts that can't properly be called animation but what are you gonna do. And surprisingly only one from MGM, ""To Spring"", and only one Warner, an early Chuck Jones called ""Joe Glow the Firefly"".

If you love old cartoons and aren't a stickler for image or audio quality, I can't imagine this not being worth the purchase. I certainly am looking forward to exploring it in all its slapdash glory.",1439337600,10,1998,4.8391812865497075

THESE CARTOONS ARE WHOLESOME!!! Some of the cartoons have classic songs where you follow the bouncing ball!

These older cartoons were made back when the artists actually put pen in hand and physically drew each frame of the cartoons by hand and then animated them without the help of computers. Not to say that today's CGI cartoons are not good because they do make use of modern day technology and make cartoons look cleaner, sharper and more polished than could be done 60+ years ago by hand but its always good to go back and visit our roots at times to really appreciate just how far we have come. Given the fact these old cartoons on these DVDs are from generations ago, don't expect them to be just as clear and sharp as today's CGI cartoons that kids are used to seeing, but they are watchable and in good shape for the most part for visual art from that period of our history. Some are better than others in terms of audio quality. I recommend this 600 cartoon collection if you can accept them for what they are- a glimpse of what animated cartooning was like in its infancy.

3424979,5,B00198J580,"This DVD set comes from Mill Creek, a company that likes to release huge box sets with films that range from downright horrible to amazingly good. This is one of those, only it's classic cartoons instead. It includes 12 discs stuffed with cartoons. Each disc comes in a cardboard slipcase and includes a list of contents. Most of the cartoons are in average condition, and I don't think any are censored or cut (not by Mill Creek, anyway.)

Some notable cartoons include:
-Walt Disney's ALICE COMEDIES - The set includes 9 of them. These are VERY old cartoons from Walt Disney, featuring a live-action girl in an animated world. They're incredibly rare and in good condition, one even includes a certificate saying that it was passed by the 1920s censors!
-CALVIN AND THE COLONEL - an old TV series. Basically an animated version of Amos and Andy. It gets a lot of negative reviews, but it's pretty funny, and some episodes include the original advertising.
-OSWALD RABBIT - Walt Disney's original animated character. Only 3 cartoons are included, but they're good ones, and you won't find them anywhere else.
-ADVENTURES OF JUNIOR RAINDROP, DESTINATION EARTH, BREAKFAST PALS, THE SHIP OF THE ETHER - these are all advertising films for Philips Radio, Rice Krispies, and other brands.

I could go on and on - IN THE MUSEUM is the first cartoon starring Toby the Pup (5 of the 12 in his series are lost.) SHEEP SHAPE and NO MUTTON FOR NUTTIN' are two rare (and not very politically correct) cartoons starring Blackie the Lamb. THE WIZARD OF OZ is an obscure cartoon from 1933, and the first film adaptation of that story.

It's an awesome set, suitable for kids and collectors alike. But a word of warning, if you haven't heard of the character, don't show it to your kids - these are from a different time, and many of them contain some material for older age groups.

P.S. 'Joe Glow the Firefly' is, for whatever reason, the only Warner Brothers cartoon on this set. So if you're looking for THOSE characters, this set isn't for you.",1363478400,,2034,4.705056179775281

And they deliver in spades with this set. It's the biggest, baddest collection of old, public domain cartoons you could buy.

If you were a child (or a parent) in the 80s, you probably remember these cheap VHS tapes full of Mighty Mouse, Betty Boop, Superman, Popeyes, Three Stooges, etc cartoons. These were not Disney, Warner Bros or MGM, but they were cheap. Well, this set pretty much has every cartoon from those sets combined in this massive 12-disc set.

Possibly worth it for The Three Stooges alone. Most of the 42 cartoons are here, and they do include the live action bits that sandwich the cartoon every episode. The stooges here are Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly-Joe DeRita as the third stooge. The stooges voice themselves in the cartoons as well as star in the live-action bits before and after the cartoon.

Definitely worth it if you want a nostalgic cartoon collection for yourself, or a cheap collection for your kids.

By the way, these are VHS transfers, and that's the best you'll ever find these cartoons. They'd otherwise be lost forever to obscurity.",1358726400,,1236,4.871428571428571

3424985,3,B00198J580,"I bought this at Toys R Us yesterday for $4.99. For that price, the content alone was worth it.

The downside, as expected, is rather poor quality. I knew going into it that they were not going to be restored and full of vibrant color. The ones I watched so far were washed out and dull, with scratchy prints. Again, that was expected though. The surprise to me was that one of the first ones I was looking for, The Golden State, had a short bit edited out of it. I've seen the complete version on youtube, but wanted a hard copy to take along with me in the car or elsewhere. If you don't know what you're looking for though, you likely won't notice the missing scene.

I haven't tried all the discs yet, so I can't yet speak to whether or not they all work (I've read some reviews here about discs not working).

Watching it sure makes me wish, though, that there were fully restored versions of these cartoons, with vibrant colors and clean prints. I'd certainly pay good money to get a set of the NTA sing along Screen Songs that are crisp, clear and colorful!",1355443200,,1064,4.31
3424986,4,B00198J580,"I got this set yesterday afternoon, and I watched some. The episodes are in between good and bad. This doesnt have the greatest quality, but my money is on Popeye and Betty Boop. The Popeye episodes are alright on some, bad on others, and the Betty Boop cartoons are about the same. I give a grade of B on this set.",1354492800,,315,4.180327868852459
3424987,5,B00198J580,"You won't believe the amount of cartoons that this pack contains until you get it and open it up. I have found cartoons in this pack that I didn't know existed, did anyone know there was a Tom & Jerry before the cat and mouse!? Of course you have your usual Popeye, Little Lulu, Woody Woodpecker, Felix The Cat, so on and so on. Video quality isn't bad, isn't great either. For the price, you can't beat the amount of cartoons that are in these package, I highly recommend this for anyone who loves cartoons.",1340841600,2,508,4.3578947368421055
3424988,5,B00198J580,"I personally really like this set. I remember about half of the cartoons from the morning and afternoon cartoon shows in the 70's. The quality of picture and sound is rough on some, better on others. You just have to take in to account that they are 50+ years old.

I'm not a fan of the new aged cartoons, so I wanted to let the children watch some older cartoons. The menus were simple and easy to understand and the cartoons were all classic shows.

3425002,5,B00198J580,"Cartoon loving children (and what child doesn't) and CGA's (Cartoon Geeks of America) rejoice! This is right up your alley.

Collectors and fans of rare cartoons will particularly enjoy this. Forgotten classics such as CALVIN & THE COLONEL (1961-62) and HOPPITY HOOPER (1964-65) appear. CALVIN is essetially the cartoon version of the late radio and TV eps of AMOS & ANDY (with Freeman Gisden and Charles Correll again providing the voices). These are some fairly amusing tales of a fox and bear that are quite amusing, but the humor probably went over the heads of most kids at the time. HOPPITY HOOPER, from the folks that brought you BULLWINKLE & ROCKY (who get occasional reference in these toons) is a clever and imaginative series about a con-fox named Waldo Wigglestaff and his dumb bugle blowing bear partner Fillmore (note-Fillmore is voiced in the first two episodes by Alan Freed-the voice of Fred Flintstone, and later by Bullwinkle voice and Kurtis Blow soundalike Bill Scott). These two crooks hide out from the law with a frog named Hoppity, whom Waldo somehow convinces is his long lost ""Uncle Waldo"" (which explains the use of this moniker in the remainder of the series). I did not see either show as a child, but their imagination and humor grew on me and I found them most enjoyable. Hopefully, this will hopefully lead to DVDs of these full series out in the future.

A large number of old-time silents are here too. The original FELIX THE CAT toons from the 1920s by Pat Sullivan are here along with some later color and sound toons (no, not the 60s versions of Felix with Pointdexter and Rock Bottom). We also have the early pre-Mickey Walt Disney in a few of the ALICE COMEDIES (1923-27) and a few OSWALD THE LUCKY RABBIT toons. The former is well repesented, especially ALICE'S EGG PLANT (1925). This wacky and clever tale has a communist chicken named Little Red Henski agitating the chickens to go on strike and stop laying eggs! Oswald's GREAT GUNS is an excellent WW1 parody with the planes slapping each other by the wings.

Lots of other good stuff here too. A George Pal puppetoon DATE WITH THE DUKE has some puppets interacting with jazz legend Duke Ellington. DESTINATION EARTH is a 1956 toon about a Mars under dicatorial rule. A fact finder visits the earth and observes the USsystem of competition and capitalism. The martians then see the light and overhthrow the dictator. HAPPY DAYS (1936) is a delightful but obvious Our Gang influenced tale about a group of kids who pool their money to buy a used auto-with predictedble and laughable results. SOMEWHERE IN DREAMLAND is  a Max Fleischer classic about poor kids who dream of a land where they have everything to eat. Popeye's classic Arabian Nights trilogy (ALADDIN with the classic politically incorrect line ""Salami salami baloney,"" SINBAD, and ALI BABA) are poorly mastered, but still enjoyable if you can overlook this detail. (Surprisingly, while Betty Boop is aboard, the classic Fleischer SUPERMAN cartoons of 1941-44 are not included here).

However, there is some junk in this trunk. Goshawful series such as COL. BLEEP, a 1950s sci-fi cartoon of extereme low budget that would only appeal as nostalgia for boomers who saw this as children (as is the case with the GUMBY claymation cartoons that are also included here). The hideous CLUTCH CARGO (which consists of poorly drawn static cartoons with superimposed human mouths speaking being the only motion) and its poor sister SPACE ANGEL are here for some unknown reason. Baby-boom age comedians have deservedly mocked these terrible cartoons. From the 1975 bad kids show parody UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK (Charles Nelson Reilly as an alligator-suit wearing kiddie show host-I remember seeing this mess when I was ten) are two animated abominations: WACKY & PACKY (a caveman and his elephant friend are transported to the present with woefully unfunny results-the elephant has one of the most annoying voices in cartoon history-Paul Puma on helium-EEEEWWWWWWW!!!) and the grim and pathetic FRAIDY CAT, a pitiful and victimized feline who lives in fear that his 9th life will soon be lost. YECCCHHH!!! Some lost cartoons need to stay lost.

On the whole, the viewer can, as Whodini said in the song ""5 minutes of Funk,"" ""separate the good stuff from the junk."" There are enough great and in some cases, historically important cartoons to give animation aficinados of all ages endless pleasure.",1287964800,6,4435,4.946308724832215

3425004,4,B00198J580,"This 12 DVD set is a treasure chest of cartoons from some famous and not so famous animation studios. Included are eight episodes of Calvin and the Colonel from the early 1960s. Based on the old Amos 'n' Andy Show, CATC even used the voices of Freeman F. Gosden and Charles J. Correll for its lead characters; the very shady Colonel Montogomery J. Klaxon and his naive but conniving friend Calvin Burnside. The laughs come quickly as the show was produced and often written by Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher of The Munsters fame. Picture and audio quality for these eight black and white episodes is fairly good.

As for the DVD set generally, some of what I have to say has been noted by other reviewers. This set appears to be a combination of Mill Creek's Amazing 300 and Super 300 cartoon collections. The picture and audio quality ranges from very good to sometimes quite ordinary. Remember these cartoons have been remastered onto DVD but not restored. On the up side, these are single sided discs and there are cartoon characters and themes to keep almost everyone interested. There's lots of Popeye, Betty Boop, Gumby, Three Stooges; and for lovers of late '50s sci-fi, Colonel Bleep. There's also a number of Christmas themed cartoons, a Noah's Ark cartoon, and even a Howdy Doody piece of film.

Also, Tom & Jerry here is not the cat and mouse T&J most of us would be familiar with; Felix the Cat is some very early stuff from the 1920s and 1930s; haven't viewed every disc yet but it seems only one Woody Woodpecker and one Mighty Mouse cartoon are on the set - I say 'seems' because some cartoon characters appear on more than one disc and the disc sleeves don't always list cartoon titles in their correct order.

Overall, this is a good value DVD set (I was lucky enough to purchase mine when it was discounted down to the price of a 300 cartoon set) just so as long as you are not expecting polished cartoons from Disney, Hanna Barbera and Warner Bros.
PS - Pick up the Super 300 Cartoon Collection if you only want Calvin and the Colonel. I believe all eight episodes appear on this smaller DVD set.",1275091200,7,2112,4.5380577427821525

Like one of those carved wood Russian toys where a large doll-shaped object contains a smaller one and a tinier version is inside of that and so on, the 300 cartoon packs were created by combining 150 boxes.

I own THE AMAZING 300 etc. This remains two separate 150 packs with different menu systems for this half compared to that half and a tendency with the second 150 titles to group them by character, that is, all the Popeyes together and so on.

Most troublesome was the number of defective discs in my 300 pack. Some would only play a few cartoons, others wouldn't load at all. The manufacturer helped me out with a replacement pack, and even that one had non-functioning DVDs in it. Fortunately for me, between the two boxes I was able to assemble one complete working set.

When the SUPER 300 CARTOON COLLECTION appeared I just didn't want to go through the same hassles, so I never bought it. Thus for the reason stated above, I cannot recommended this re-issue of 300 packs, as the tin can that houses these repackaged discs very well may be a can of worms.

3425006,5,B00198J580,"Love love love this exhaustive collection of memories and fabulous animation! I bought this recently when i was out of town at a Cracker Barrel, and knew it was for me right away! And at 600 toons to the tune of $15.00, you can't beat it! I love old and public domain cartoons, almost 2 year's worth of watching if you watch one a day! This brings back many wonderful memories, as well as ""new"" discoveries that i probably saw at one time or another. I'm the odd man (girl) out here, but i definitely believe them when they say digitally remastered, sure they still have their cracks and pops (which makes them nostalgic, there's only so much you can do with old film), but i owned some of these, like Little LuLu on Video as a kid, and can definitely tell the difference. The quality is sensational on my portable DVD player, picture as well as sound wise. Even the b&w's are crystal clear.

But what can i say- what a collection! It's great to have so many memories on DVD's that i don't have to transfer from video. The packaging and content reminded me very much of a ""big cartoon"" video collection my grandparents gave us for Christmas many years ago (and we thought 26 cartoons was a big set!!!) While of course there isn't Looney Tunes or Disney, there's many ""in betweens"" cartoons that were featured on Bugs Bunny cartoon sets.  And yes, i love the fact that public domain collections are not edited for political correctness, reflecting the values and concerns of the times. Great for historical as well as just entertainment purposes. Regardless of your viewpoints, when you edit for political correctness, you lose a part of history. Btw, there are knock-off Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunnyish looking characters if it interest any of you. And speaking of history, there is a vocal version of the WW1 anthem, ""We're in the Army Now"" sung on ""A Close Call"" on Aesop's Fables on Disc 7. As a music freak i know a vocal version of this is almost impossible to find.

I have heard the old tired attack on cartoons from some people that they are violent for kids, etc. Anybody with half a brain knows the difference between real and pretend ""violence."" I've never heard of a kid going postal after watching Wile E. drop a bomb on the Road Runner. I even heard a grown woman say the Looney Tunes were scary to her. Therapy. It truly breaks my heart that there can be hate in the world for something as genius and harmless as a cartoon. No doubt it would be the kids that were DEPRIVED of the joy of cartoons who would grow up to be the mass murderers of this world, and i am so glad they are preserved in this collection. I hope to share these with my loved ones and own kids in the future. Another reason i suspect things like this are so bugetly priced, as they may be of no interest to the extremely offended.

While i'm usually about me some organization, it's neat that the cartoons are all mixed up, it's like a treasure hunt and gives variety to each disc.

All the favorites are here - Little LuLu, Betty Boop, Casper, Felix, Three Stooges, Brementown Musicians, Molly Moo Cow and the Butterflies. The Popeyes i have gotten in to so far are black and white. The historical timeline of animation and cartooning styles in itself make it worth buying. Great for ""kids"" of all ages from 1-92! Sure to please any youngster you may be buying this for. Luckily, kids (as well as many adults) do not care about perfect quality films, i am just pleased that this has been released to the public in one compact and handy collection. It sure saves the work of transferring, hunting, buying, and researching for cartoon buffs. This collection is a very apt tribute to the classic cartooning of various animators and production companies.

Love all the new discoveries as well, that might be more familiar to the older set than me- like a Snap Crackle and Pop short- must have been a promo for Rice Krispies. Was this on TV or in the movies?

Big kudos to Mill Creek Ent for providing such an outstanding and affordable collection of treasured memories! You made this gal very happy!!!",1272240000,,4082,4.508108108108108
3425007,1,B00198J580,"The mix of cartoons here is vast.  Which I why I purchased the set.

Re-mastered is the keyword that fooled me.  These are very poor transfers from bad source material.
The quality is bad.  Read the rest of the reviews.  Everyone says the quality is bad.
The only way to fully describe is to imagine watching them back in the old days, with poor fuzzy reception on your TV due to your antenna based TV.
Description should read.  24 VHS tapes rescued from flood transferred to DVD.
That's the quality you will see.

Another gripe I have is that there are 12 disks of content and I bet that no one who owns this set can tell me what disk is their favorite.  Why? The good stuff (minimal) is scattered across all the disks making it impossible to sit through an entire disk without losing the interest of the child or adult who is stick watching it.

Don't get me wrong, Under $10 for a set of 12 themed coasters is a deal.  Just don't use your coasters as TV entertainment.",1271030400,16,971,4.314917127071824

3425009,5,B00198J580,"Anyone can complain about the quality on this set but we all forget how old these Golden Treasures are too. Yes, they are VHS recordings, and now they are all on DVD format which (in my opinion) is awesome! Many of the animations have never even seen the light of day until the release of this set. I'm very impressed that they did little to no restoration on these shorts and episodes because when watching, it would take most of the dated time away from the films. Tampering may also even damage the original prints/recordings and/or just take away the simple things that made them so memorable in the first place. I'm very happy the way they are! The randomness and categorization on each disk gives all disks worth a look and full of many suprises. Its nice to see a lot of animations exclusively only on this set (such as Felix The Cat, where many of his cartoons are only on this set).

THIS COLLECTION IS SO LEGENDARY THAT THEY EVEN UPGRADED IT INTO A TIN-CASE, INCLUDING A T-SHIRT!
PLEASE MAKE MORE! THANKS AGAIN!",1265932800,3,1021,4.518918918918919

8272499,3,B00198J580,"The dvds were fine, they had some gems of animation like Popeye, Betty Boop, Felix The Cat, Woody Woodpecker, and Mighty Mouse. However, the remaining portion of the 12 dvds (thats right, TWELVE.) was recycled pieces of Hollywood garbage smashed into the cartoon pack. The quality (if you can even call it that) was below average, but I give them credit for trying to enhance cartoons that were almost a century old.

The packaging was damaged, but then again I did buy it used and the packaging was made of legit PAPER. The cases for the discs were so horribly put together, that I had no idea how bad the set was at this point.

But know this, all dvd sets marketed by Mill Creek come in the little cardboard cases and usually have poor dvd quality, along with the completely useless idea that they have to smash as much as they can into one set.

Overall this gets three stars because I can admire the fact that they TRIED, and that the item had a very low price along with a good value for what you get, even if some of the cartoons are bad.",1515024000,,1045,4.321428571428571

Makes long trips go by much easier.  The culture of these older cartoons is so much more innocent of modern propaganda. Simplicity, compared to 21st century special effects extravaganzas in animation!  Good to have on hand for variety and reminders of the evolution of media.
