7900395,4,7885727114,"There is a Criterion release of this film, which is an amazing transfer with some excellent special features, so I'd look to that first, unless you can get an amazing price on this Hong Kong transfer.

Touching, simple story of how a young girl's summer romance with a sweet, modest young man, changes a her adult life as a ballet dancer forever.

Told in flashback, beautifully shot, and mostly well (if not quite brilliantly) acted, this lovely film could have been even stronger if the two leads both didn't look and feel much too old for their roles, making their naivet and innocence feel a bit forced.

But there's much that's moving and insightful here about youthful idealism versus life's hard realities.",1453593600,,713,4.827868852459017
