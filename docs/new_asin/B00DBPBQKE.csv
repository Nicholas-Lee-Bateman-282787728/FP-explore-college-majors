5787436,5,B00DBPBQKE,cm punk vs brock lesnar is the main reason im buying this dvd..all the matches were good..except the divas...by the way...who's john cena?,1378684800,,138,5.043478260869565
5787437,4,B00DBPBQKE,"A couple of notes here in the The Miz hosted this years event but kept having to deal with Fandango throughout the night & JoJo from ""Total Divas"" sang the National Anthem at the start of the show.

Ring Of Fire Match: Kane vs. Brad Wyat - This is the match that was formerly known as the ""Inferno Match"" where ringside is surrounded by fire to keep the participants inside & any other associates out except this match could end by pinfall or submission instead of setting the other on fire.  The flames on the outside shot up high whenever a big move was delivered such as Kane's chokeslams & sidewalk slam or Wyat's running forearm while Wyat's associates on the outside kept attempting to get involved trying to toss in weapons or putting the fire out to no avail throughout the match.  While the visual of the men wrestling around the flames was quite the sight, the match itself wasn't much but did it's job in establishing Brad Wyat.

Cody Rhodes vs. Damien Sandow - The former partners started out trading shots in the corner with Sandow being able to take control working over Rhodes' back with forearms & ramming it into the apron & stretches including a variation of a standing texas cloverleaf before Rhodes was able to catch Sandow delivering the musclebuster & a springboard missle dropkick followed by his disaster kick.  This was a good back & forth match between both men.

World Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. Christian - Del Rio came out very aggressive with a headlock that he refused to let go of & began focusing on his previously injured arm such a hammerlock shove into the barricade while pulling & wrapping the arm into the ropes but Christian was able to keep mounting some aerial offense such as a top rope dive to the outside & flying crossbody & missile dropkick while later executing a flying elbow & frankensteiner off the top rope only for Del Rio to bring the fight as well with a backstabber with Christian on the ropes & low headbutt as both men were exchanging kicks & near falls before one man delivered a move that hurt himself more than other which was his downfall.  Both men gave one of the best World Championship matches this year.

Natayla vs. Bree Bella - Natayla had the Funkadactyls in her corner while Bree had her sister Nikki & Eva Marie in her's as both girls started out trading slaps with Natayla taking Bree down causing her associates to get involved allowing Bree to take advantage with legdrops & kept working her over with a chinlock armbar stretch while Natayla kept attempting to apply the sharpshooter while we had the obvious fight on the outside between all the other divas.  While I'm happy that Natayla has some spotlight on her after being so underutilized for years now, this match was pretty much like the previous WrestleMania/Playboy matches where it's just here to promote the ""Total Divas"" show & nothing much past that to the point where you just heard the crowd turn on this match & trying to entertain themselves with various chants but it was watchable & not bad.

No Disqualification Match: C.M. Punk vs. Brock Lesnar - ""The Best vs. The Beast"" started off strong with Brock powering Punk into the corner with strong shoulder drives & kept easily tossing him around before Punk was able to take Brock down & to the outside followed by a suicide dive & attempted to use the steel steps only for Brock to forcefully power through knocking the steps back onto Punk as both men traded momentum on the outside with Punk dropping down clotheslines & double axe handles while Brock kept tossing him over announce tables & breaking pieces of it over his body.  Brock was able to keep stopping Punk's momentum with one power hit after another focusing on his ribs & back to the point where he kept telling Punk to ""STAY DOWN!"" causing Punk to get desperate taking a page out of Mike Tyson's past & started building momentum with punches & kicks eventually taking Brock down & keeping him down with roundhouse kicks & the Savage Elbow before both men was able to counter each other's signature holds such as the G.T.S. into Kimora Lock into a triangle choke into a running powerbomb while later a F5 countered in a way we hadn't seen before with a chair came into play along with Paul Heyman constantly becoming a difference maker throughout the match.  Michael Cole said it best, ""What an incredible fight"" while Shawn Michaels later echoed everyone's sentiments, ""C.M. Punk & Brock Lesnar...Thank You Very Much!""

Dolph Ziggler & Kaityln vs. Big E Langston & A.J. Lee - Big E showcased his dominate power early as tossing Dolph around with a suplex & showing athleticism himself getting some air with a leaping elbow while also allowing A.J. to get a slap in before the divas came in fighting with Kaityln delivering a backbreaker & A.J. with multiple neckbreakers followed by the men trading moves from 10 straight elbow drops to a backbreaker drop over the knee while the divas got involved in the match & with each other on the outside.  Short but fun match.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Daniel Bryan - Triple H was the special referee for this match while Cena was coming into the match with an elbow injury which Bryan targeted right away causing Cena to go to the outside to try to regroup & took control with the headlock takedown & a running forearm that knocked Bryan off the apron into the announce table but Bryan came back tossing Cena into the steps only for Cena to retaliate with a suplex off the steps.  Bryan took back control in the ring with a running clothesline & kicks to the chest while Cena had his trademark shoulderblocks & side slam only for Bryan to be able to have counters to a five knuckle shuffle & A.A. on more than one occasion & even put Cena in his own STF as both men traded momentum back & forth hitting big moves like the superplex & top rope legdrop & diving headbutt while blocking & countering each other's holds such as the suicide dive & top rope head scissors & trading slaps as both men were just exhausted to the point where they were leaning on each other just to stay up.  This was very similar to Cena's series of matches with Punk where Bryan was able to pull it out of Cena & this was definitely a highlight in both men's WWE careers but stay tuned after as what everyone was expecting to happen did (hell, WWE teased it for weeks coming into this match) but nobody expected HOW it happened.

This was a very solid SummerSlam from start to finish as the main events were definitely modern day classics while other matches on the undercard were from very good to solid as there really wasn't a bad match on here making this one of the best PPV's this year that I recommend.",1377648000,,6690,4.556203164029975
5787438,5,B00DBPBQKE,"I wasn honored the privllage to attend this years summerslam not only as my first wwe event but as my first PPV event as well. It was an awesome card with jam packed action. The crowd in LA was on fire for one of the most epic nights in WWE as of recent time. Brock lesnar vs CM Punk was a great match with tons of action and exciment. The rest if the card was solid awesome as well. But the match of the night was Daniel Bryan vs John cena as Daniel Bryan took John cena to the limit to capture his first WWE Championship, but that was short lived as the viper strikes with the help of his former buddy triple H to leave the entire staple center in awe.",1377129600,,654,3.962121212121212
5787439,4,B00DBPBQKE,"SummerSlam, the second biggest event of WWE's fiscal year, took place (for the 5th straight year) from the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. Here is a quick rundown (without much to do in terms of spoilers) of the matches at hand:

Rob Van Dam vs. Dean Ambrose for the United States Championship (Pre-Show): With the battlegrounds even, the clash of styles work until the end. **1/2
Kane vs. Bray Wyatt in a Ring of Fire: Inferno Matches were never classics, but it sure is a spectacle for the buzzards. *1/2
Damien Sandow vs. Cody Rhodes: Best friends turned bitter enemies with some entertaining jousting (both verbal and physical). **1/2
Brie Bella vs. Natalya: Exactly what you expect, but nothing offensive. *1/2
Christian vs. Alberto Del Rio for the World Heavyweight Championship: Brutal match to watch with a couple of nice teases. ***1/2
Brock Lesnar vs. CM Punk in a No Disqualification Match: Both men earn their keep in this well-done clash of the brutes. ****1/4
Dolph Ziggler & Kaitlyn vs. AJ Lee & Big E. Langston: A ""cool-down"" match in every sense of the term. Ziggler should have been in the WHC match. *1/2
Daniel Bryan vs. John Cena for the WWE Championship: Four faces (including ref Triple H and Randy Orton) enter themselves into the match. Two stay good, two turn bad. In the fracas, a really good match happens! ****1/4 And a cash-in (no rating).

Expect the DVD extra to be the pre-show match while some Blu-ray exclusives will be announced later. Expect those to be promos and the like.

Overall this event was executed well. Not much to do in the way of filler (mixed tag aside). The things that needed to be accomplished were accomplished here with various amounts of fan appreciation. To see where the WWE Championship angle goes from here will make for interesting television. Unlike a lot of posters you'll see, I generally rate PPV's on how they were executed, not exactly how great each individual match did. From my own feel, this was definitely a 4 star PPV worthy of several rewatches, particularly for the end!",1376870400,,2057,4.788732394366197
5787440,4,B00DBPBQKE,"After last years disappointing ""Summerslam,"" WWE rebounds nicely at this event. The the double main event feuds were very compelling in their own way and the under card was pretty solid as well. This event took me for an interesting ride.

United States Championship
Dean Ambrose (Champion) vs. RVD
While this wasn't as good as I hoped it would be, it continued the hot streak for WWE's pre-show matches. There was nothing spectacular about the match but these two looked fluid in the ring and Ambrose definitely held his own. This match was all apart of another story though, as Mark Henry & Big Show look to take on the other two members of the Shield, Roman Reigns & Seth Rollins. I'm looking forward to seeing what these two can do given more time and an actual finish. ***

Ring of Fire Match
Kane vs. Bray Wyatt
The fact that the this was the first Inferno (Ring of Fire) Match since 2006 made me very excited as a fan. I've loved the Wyatt Family and the Kane story line, but this match did it no justice. Considering WWE is still PG television, they could only do so much with a concept like this. The flames were very small and only shot up when either man performed an impact move. The action in the ring was decent, it just had a lot of things missing. The ending was logical as it put the Wyatt's over and will eventually revamp Kane's character. *

Cody Rhodes vs. Damien Sandow
Both of these guys are very talented and it showed in the ring, even with the short amount of time they were given. They got a raw deal here as this only went around seven minutes, but they made the most of it with every move. The muscle buster off the top rope was a great spot and these two proved they are rising stars in the business. I don't see the feud being over yet, as Rhodes will most likely be the next contender for the World Heavyweight Championship; and Sandow will always be lurking with his MITB contract. ***

World Heavyweight Championship
Alberto Del Rio (Champion) vs. Christian
This feud was based around Christian finally getting his ""one more match"" for the Heavyweight title, going up against the stale Champion Del Rio. As much as I don't like the guy, he can put on a good match when it counts. Just as he & Ziggler had chemistry in the ring, these two brought it just as much. The false finishes near the end turned the match up a notch, but this felt a little too much like their previous encounters. This will probably be Christian's last title shot; if it is, he put on a nice finale. Del Rio gets the CLEAN win. Shocking. ***

Natalya vs. Brie Bella
I wonder if the Bella Twins are mad that I didn't put their name first. Jokes aside, this simply a promotional match for WWE's ""hit"" reality show Total Divas. The match was pretty basic, as the only thing significant was Natalya finally winning a match; over the Bella's of all people! Maybe she will be next in line for a title shot. Let this sink in, this was a divas match promoting a divas show and it went on after Del Rio & Christian. *

No Disqualification Match
CM Punk vs. Brock Lesnar
This was billed as the ""The Best"" (CM Punk) vs. ""The Beast"" (Brock Lesnar) and man, did this ever live up to its name. This feud was beyond personal, as Punk & Heyman had bad blood which brought Lesnar into the equation. It's a given that CM Punk is going to give you a great performance and Lesnar was on a whole different level here. His power and dominance meshed so well with Punk's wrestling skills and this reminded me of how good a wrestler Lesnar still is too. This was 50/50 the whole way, with Punk even matching Lesnar's physicality at times. The No Disqualification stipulation added more to the match and they were able to tell the story perfectly. The Heyman interference was kept to a minimum and it was a crowd pleaser to see Punk finally get his hands on him; although it ended in The Beast's favor as he connected with an F5 to a distracted Punk on the steel chair which was a perfect, brutal ending. This was Lesnar's best match since coming back to the WWE and this is without question the match of the year thus far, just above Undertaker/Punk. I hope these two square off again in the future. ****

Mixed Tag Team Match
Dolph Ziggler & Kaitlyn vs. Big E & AJ Lee
This had the unfortunate task of going after Punk/Lesnar and before Cena/Bryan. The match was decent for what it was, but the crowd seemed uninterested and worn down; I can't really blame them. This was the big payoff for each separate feud and hopefully these four move on to different things. **

WWE Championship (Special Guest Referee: Triple H)
John Cena (Champion) vs. Daniel Bryan
The build up to this match was faltered at first with Cena just simply picking Bryan, but it eventually picked up and became very intense. Of course, Triple H has to get involved in order to get this whole McMahon angle started; all complaints aside, I was happy to see this two put on a clinic. Bryan is the most over guy in the WWE right now and it shows in every arena he steps foot into. The crowd was solidly behind him from beginning to finish, although Cena deserves his props too. These two matched each other step by step as Bryan is a prime example of a guy that Cena is motivated to work with and actually wrestle against. Despite this match being a bit sloppy at times, it had its fair share of great spots including Bryan suplexing Cena off the top rope but no selling his impact. It was a great moment to see the underdog Bryan win his well deserved first WWE Championship by pinning Cena cleanly. This couldn't top Punk/Lesnar but was a great main event in its own right and was a very memorable moment. The night was far from over though. ****

WWE Championship
Daniel Bryan (Champion) vs. Randy Orton
I was really on the edge of my seat as Bryan won, because I kept thinking back and forth whether Orton would cash in or not. As the confetti reigned down and Bryan was celebrating, Orton came out to cash in and as he became a distraction, Triple H goes full heel mode for the first time in seven/eight years as he pedigrees Bryan. Orton then took advantage and cashed in the contract to win his first WWE Championship since 2010; as well as finally turning heel again along with The Game. This was smart booking, as Triple H & Orton give us a nice Evolution throwback and it sets up a title chase where fans will be anxiously awaiting for Daniel Bryan to regain what he was robbed of, the WWE Championship. (NR)

As far as I'm concerned, this is WWE's big event for this year because it easily topped an underwhelming ""WrestleMania"" 29. This was a fantastic ""Summerslam"" and one of the best in recent memory. This was on the same level as ""Money in the Bank"" and it sets up some new, interesting feuds to look forward to. The double main events delivered big time and the show ended with a bang.",1376870400,9,6855,4.390551181102362
5787441,4,B00DBPBQKE,"The United States Championship match between Rob Van Dam & Dean Ambrose was an average match that never really kicked into gear. The Ring of Fire match between Kane & Bray Wyatt was not great but pretty good. The Cody Rhodes-Damien Shadow match was a fast-paced and good bout. The World's Heavyweight Championship match between Alberto Del Rio & Christian was a phenomenal example of old-school wrestling at its finest and the finish was a good example of in-ring psychology and continuously as one could imagine. The Natalya-Brie Bella match was unspectacular yet solid. The No-DQ match between Brock Lesnar & CM Punk was a hardcore,smash-mouth,vicious brawl. The Mixed Tag Team match between Dolph Ziggler & Kaitlyn against Big E Langston & AJ Lee was a fast-paced,interesting & entertaining bout. The WWE Championship match between John Cena & Daniel Bryan(With Triple H as the Guest Referee) was a phenomenal,back-and-forth bout.

  Brock Lesnar vs CM Punk in a No DQ match: In a grueling match, Punk almost won with the Go To Sleep but Heyman broke it up. Punk snapped, got the Anaconda Device on Heyman, Lesnar broke it up and hit the F5 for the win.
  Kaitlyn and Ziggler vs AJ Lee and Big E. Langston: All I remember is Big E. went for his finiser but Ziggler reversed it with the Zig Zag for the win.
  Daniel Bryan vs John Cena (WWE Champilnship): I am not a Cena fan at all and am tired of him, but I admit this was one of the funnest matches I've seen in awhile. He even put over Bryan clean when Bryan hit a running kick to the head. Yes! Bryan won and he deserved it!
  No! The WWE couldn't let us or him enjoy a long reign. Orton comes out, teases cashing in, fakes leaving, HHH then turned on Bryan and hit him with the Pedigree. Orton who doesn't deserve to be champion over Bryan at all, then made the pin for the win. Way to ""F"" up a great moment WWE.
  Cena and Orton are the WWE's comfort zone as WWE champion. They bury anyone else who deserves it. I predict Bryan feuds with Orton and loses every match to him. Cena then returns and beats Orton for the title. Bryan is fresh and over, way to blow it WWE!",1376784000,,1684,4.0823170731707314

SUMMERSLAM 2013

1.[RING OF FIRE MATCH]KANE VS BRAY WYATT-possibly the match I was most looking forward to and it was the one straight out the gate. This was basically an inferno match except you won by pinfall or submission. Bray looked good here but it was mostly Kane in control which had the Wyatt family on the outside going crazy. As Kane landed sidewalk slams and chokeslams they finally made their way in after laying a mat across the flames. Once inside they lay Kane out which allows Bray to get the win. Afterwards they smash Kanes head in-between the steel steps and walk off with him.

2. CODY RHODES VS DAMIEN SANDOW-this was the battle of former tag partners with Cody as a face now. These two still work well together giving us a good match with a quick pace. The back and forth action is great with Sandow controlling early but Cody coming back to pick up the win.

3.[WORLD TITLE]ALBERTO DEL RIO VS CHRISTIAN-one of the absolute best matches of the night and possibly my favorite. These two put on a great match with their performances here. There were many near finishes in this match on both ends as the match was back and forth. This was great contest by two of WWEs best.

4. NATALYA VS BREE BELLA-this was a better match then it gets credit for. The fans were funny during this with their chants but the match was good. Of course I love Natalya so I knew it would be good with her in it. She ends up getting the win in a Total Divas match.

5.[NO DQ]CM PUNK VS BROCK LESNAR-this was an excellent fight right here between the Paul Heyman Guys. Great pace with Brock looking huge and Punk looking like he can go toe to toe [like HBK used to do] with the monster he was facing. Heyman gets involved of course and chairs make a difference in this match. Lesnar hit the F-5 for the win but this was a great battle.

6. DOLPH ZIGGLER & KAITLYN VS BIG E LANGSTON & AJ LEE-another good match with this one being a mixed tag match. Ziggler is always excellent and he did well here with Big E. The ladies of course got into it including a great moment on the outside of the ring. In the end Ziggler lands the Zig Zag for the win

7.[WWE TITLE]JOHN CENA VS DANIEL BRYAN-this was a great match and a good main event as Bryan is one of those guys that pulls out the best in Cena. Both trade offense throughout the match with Cena more so the brawler although looking good in pure wrestling. Bryan on the other hand did everything we are used to seeing him do plus more. He goes on to defeat Cena only to have special referee Triple H attack afterwards and allow Randy Orton to cash in his MITB case and take the belt away.

BONUS

1.[US TITLE]DEAN AMBROSE VS RVD-this was a good match that I wish would have been on the PPV with more time. Can you imagine if these two were given time to work with each other. The quick match they have here is good with RVD controlling and battling The Shield. He ends up with the DQ win.",1390435200,3,2936,4.266187050359712

5787463,4,B00DBPBQKE,"Thanks to 3 outstanding wrestling matches, Summerslam 2013 is the finest WWE PPV in many years. This is the show that made me realize, with utter shock, that WWE had suddenly undergone a philosophy change. After disdaining the term 'pro wrestling' in favor of 'sports entertainment' for decades, the elements that owner Vince McMahon felt put the 'entertainment' into his product (bad comedy, nonsensical matchups, a ""punch/kick"" ring style) are mercifully absent here. A full month after this show, WWE resembled nothing but a pro wrestling organization. Let's hope it stays that way awhile.
  1)US title: Champion Dean Ambrose vs Rob Van Dam-The future vs the past. According to those in the know, WWE management considers Ambrose a future WWE champion. Having made his bones on the rough n ready indie circuit under the moniker Jon Moxley, Ambrose entered WWE ready for a push, and he's getting it. RVD, although no longer the athletic cyclone from a decade ago, is clearly motivated to be out of TNA. ***
  2)Ring of Fire match: Kane vs Bray Wyatt-15 years after a Kane-Undertaker snoozer with the same gimmick, the 'Ring of Fire' is back, for some reason. Thanks to that gimmick, and the all-too-familiar mediocrity of Kane, this is a plodding affair. Not even those drawbacks can totally hide the promise and charisma of Bray Wyatt (aka Windham Rotunda, son of ""I.R.S."" Mike Rotundo). *
  3)Cody Rhodes vs Damien Sandow-Designed as a showcase for Rhodes' improving skills (and thanks to management allowing guys to actually wrestle rather than punch), Cody resembles nothing more than a minor league A.J. Styles, and that's a compliment. Great reaction for Rhodes, a true star on the rise. ***
  4)World title: Champion Alberto Del Rio vs Christian-What would have been a bathroom break a year ago winds up being a showstopper. Christian, clearly inspired by the success of technically based main eventers Daniel Bryan and CM Punk, wrestles a brilliant, stiff match, and Del Rio raises his game dramatically in order to keep up. Just an excellent professional wrestling match, hard-hitting and perfectly booked. **** and 1/4
  5)Natalya vs Brie Bella-Despite working an unforgiving spot on the card, these Divas refuse to deliver a Kelly Kelly-Candice Michelle horror show. As inspired as the men, the women do what they can given the time allotted. *
  6)No disqualifications: CM Punk vs Brock Lesnar (w/Paul Heyman)-Was there any doubt that, given the new company devotion to ring performance, and despite the no blading handicap, these 2 would deliver a genuinely brutal bout? Not only are both men at the top of their games, but the booking and production are first rate. A very rare match of the year candidate from WWE. **** and 1/2
  7)Dolph Ziggler/Kaitlyn vs Big E Langston/AJ Lee-Making the earlier Divas match seem like a showcase, this one is strictly designed as a fan breather between the two big main events. But anytime you get to watch Ziggler and the smokin' AJ, it's a treat. * and 1/2
  8)WWE Title: Champion John Cena vs Daniel Bryan-When WWE signed brilliant Bryan Danielson from the Ring of Honor promotion, fans of the sweet science everywhere wept. ""Oh well"", most of us thought, ""it'll only take a year or 2 for Danielson to wash out in Vince's Land Of Giants, then he'll be back in the indies where he belongs."". If you had told any one of us that, in 4 years, the newly-christened Daniel Bryan would be headlining the company's 2nd or 3rd biggest show of the year, challenging company figurehead John Cena for the strap, no less...well, we would've wondred how you could have possibly gotten that information, and what you were smoking. No matter what WWE ends up doing to Bryan, his fans will always have these amazing memories. And in this, the biggest match of his career by far, Bryan delivers in a big way. Kudos are also due to Cena, who gives his best for the full 30 minutes. Despite a legit elbow injury, and his lofty and untouchable status within the organization, Cena unselfishly caters to Bryan's style, and in the process helps make Bryan a top star to WWE fans previously unconvinced. Both men are at their peak, and the shocking pinfall resulting in the title change is truly exhilirating. **** and 1/2
  9)WWE title: Champion Daniel Bryan vs Randy Orton-The events that led to this impromptu Money in the Bank cash-in by Orton is well known by now. Some criticized the angle, looking at it as just a way to shortchange Bryan. I on the other hand, just thought it was a great, old-fashioned rasslin' swerve, perfectly exectued by the combatants as well as special ref Triple H. This is the way it was done in the good ol days, folks.",1381276800,2,4684,4.841051314142678
5787464,5,B00DBPBQKE,"Haven't a Summerslam this good in its entirety since 2009. Worth the price for the two main matches, Punk vs Lesnar and Daniel Bryan vs John Cena.

RVD vs Dean Ambrose - U.S. Title (Summerslam Kickoff)
This really should've been part of the main PPV. But I believe the pre-show is something people get for free whether you ordered the PPV or not. If that's the case, I guess I can understand why this was here. If I didn't order the show, I'd still love to see RVD and Ambrose myself. RVD wins by DQ as the other Shield members interfered, which brought out a now Cry Baby Big Show and a now injured Mark Henry. This was done to set-up Show/Henry vs The Shield which was scheduled to take place before Henry went out with yet another injury. RVD and Ambrose meshed well enough for me here to make me wanna see them face each other again, but in a longer match than the pre-show can provide and with a clean as in no interference, non-DQ/count-out finish.

Kane vs Bray Wyatt - Ring Of Fire
As another user noted, the Inferno match here was limited due to WWE's PG rating. I still liked it though. Ending was predictable, but good as it elevated The Wyatts while giving Kane time off for resting from the grid of WWE's schedule, filming See No Evil and engaging in his political interests. He's the only full-time wrestler left from the Attitude Era who hardly ever gets injured and never took time off for injury till this angle far as I can tell.

Cody Rhodes vs Damien Sandow
Rhodes won. Logical because in the end, Sandow still has the MITB briefcase so losing to Cody here didn't really hurt him. Loving this ongoing Rhodes angle. Have a feeling it'll lead to a Title match between Rhodes and Sandow.

Christian vs Del Rio - WHC
LOVED this. With each pin Christian made and whenever he tried to escape a submission, it got emotion out of me and I kept chanting for him loudly as if I were in the arena! That's a sign of a great match. Del Rio's very good. But Christian made him better here. I was so upset Christian lost after his performance.

Natalya (with The Funkadactyls (Cameron and Naomi) vs Brie Bella (with Eva Marie and Nikki Bella)
Didn't really care enough to watch this so I used this to take a break from staring a TV screen.

CM Punk vs Brock Lesnar - No DQ ""The Best Vs The Beast"" match
Loved up to the hype? I'd make an argument that it surpassed the hype. Making it a No DQ match made it all the more better. I have yet to see a bad CM Punk match. Meanwhile, Lesnar was in another gear here. One of the reasons to buy this blu ray.

Dolph Ziggle/Kaitlyn defeated Big E Langston/AJ Lee
Not great. But not bad. Big E was the only downside of this match. Thankfully it was short. The ending is worth watching. But that's it.

Daniel Bryan vs John Cena - WWE Title
The other reason to buy this blu ray. I credit both men here, yes even Cena. Here's the thing I noticed about Cena which no one really mentions: He needs the right guy/opponent to get the greatest performance he has in him to come out. Bryan is one of those guys and it clearly showed here. Like Punk, never saw a bad Bryan match.

Orton cashes in MITB leading to....Orton vs Bryan - WWE Title
Orton cashing in and turning heel was predictable. But HHH's heel turn was a nice swerve by WWE as no one knew or expected he'd turn here. People say Orton being Champion again is bad. I disagree as it has led to great TV and led to people talking. And in the end when he finally recaptures the WWE TItle, BRyan will be even more over and that is the real payoff that's worth waiting for.

5787465,5,B00DBPBQKE,"WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH *MAIN EVENT*
- John Cena(c) vs. Daniel Bryan
4.5/5 stars. Daniel Bryan picks up the victory after a sick knee to the face. It was a great title match, a lot better main event then last years. After the match was crazy. Of course everyone predicted Orton to cash in, but the way that he did. Awesome. Gonna make for a great storyline. Triple H and Randy Orton as heels is great.

THE BEST VERSUS THE BEAST *NO DQ*
- CM Punk vs. Brock Lesnar (w/Heyman)
5/5 stars. For me, this match just stole the show. Fantastic. A lot better than I thought and actually a match that lived up to the hype. Freaking brutal. I loved it. Lesnar picks up a win after a crazy F-5 on a chair.

WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
- ADR(c) vs. Christian
4/5 stars. Another suprisingly really good match up! Both delivered. ADR gets the win by submission.

PRE-SHOW: UNITED STATES CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH
-Dean Ambrose(c)vs. RVD
3.5/5 stars. Really good for a preshow match. RVD gets the win by DQ. Big Show, Henry, and the rest of The Shield interfere.

- Cody Rhodes vs. Damien Sandow
3.5/5 stars. Rhodes picks up the win after a Cross Rhodes. Good match here. Glad Cody got the win, both are future world champions.

RING OF FIRE MATCH
- Bray Wyatt vs. Kane
2/5 stars. Decent opener, Wyatt gets the win after interference from his family. Match did its job and the beat down gives Kane time for his moive. Maybe a return at Hell in a Cell? In a HIAC match? Wonder how that would go.

MIXED TAG TEAM MATCH
- Big E & AJ Lee vs. Ziggler & Kaitlyn
2.5/5 stars. Basically a filler, but it did its job! Ziggler is so good in the ring. And Big E is a good big man. Ziggler gets the win after a ZigZag.

-Natayla vs. Brie
no.

5787466,2,B00DBPBQKE,"Although it was filled with some pretty good matches, the 1 minute Daniel Bryan held the title left a bad taste in my mouth. The ""swerve"" has been called brilliant by some but I feel it really took the steam out of DBryan. I've lost a lot of interest in the product due to this one event. Maybe years down the road, it won't seem so bad b/c Punk/Lesnar was easily one of the best matches this year. But not giving the fans what they had waited for was a horrible move especially since they did it to Ziggler just a couple of months earlier. Now look where he's at, basically a jobber, stuck in the midcard once again. I'll be very surprised if Bryan survives this run with fanbase intact.",1379030400,,688,4.259541984732825

8591388,4,B00DBPBQKE,"WWE came into SummerSlam with two big questions on the card: could Daniel Bryan become the top guy and whether CM Punk and Brock Lesnar could have the sort of transcendent performance that would solidify their places in the WWE forever. It was a night where there was a genuine sense of anticipation... Was the WWE going to pass the torch?

Not Worth Watching: Bray Wyatt debuted against Kane in a mediocre Ring of Fire Match, the women's match was more about hyping the Total Divas reality show, and the inter gender tag team match--while not bad--was little more than a cool down between main events.

Worth Watching: Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow had a short but solid match, Alberto Del Rio defended his World Title against Christian in a very good match, and Daniel Bryan captured the WWE Title after a sensational match with John Cena.

Match of the Night: CM Punk and Brock Lesnar showed everyone else how to have a grudge match. There have been very few matches that successfully communicate a sense of animosity like these two were able to do here. This is one of the very best matches in SummerSlam history, even surpassing Shawn and Triple H from 2002.

While the card as a whole had its share of dead weight, three great matches buoy this edition of SummerSlam and make it a worthwhile show.",1408492800,,1303,4.627705627705628
