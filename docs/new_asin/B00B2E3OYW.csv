8561398,5,B00B2E3OYW,I like the mention by Karen to be sure to eat right.  The Firm has a reputation to guarantee results in 10 workouts.  You can trust this.,1400371200,3,137,4.037037037037037
8561399,5,B00B2E3OYW,"I really like this workout. It is a compilation of clips from previous Firm workouts with mostly lower impact floor and step cardio with the traditional Firm style four limb weighted moves blended in as well. It is 40 min total with the w/u and c/d, and is a good lower impact aero-tone workout. This would be especially good for those wanting to try the Firm but are not quite up to their intensity level yet, this will help you get there. I always like how you can use a variety of weight levels depending on your level of fitness to make the Firm workouts harder or easier, and this is no exception. You will work all major upper body muscles and do some lower body work as well via lunges/squats. The transitions are seamless thanks to excellent editing and the use of between clip set ups with the ""instructor"" that introduces the workout but doesn't actually lead any of the segments. Great workout!",1365379200,4,905,4.524390243902439
