1012588,3,6305337144,"This movie is so weird that I don't even know what to think of it. I question whether it is a truly Surrealist film - it's certainly a very _strange_ film, but ""surreal"" does not mean ""strange"", and it's time we buried that misconception once and for all - but it will likely appeal to fans of Surrealism and other avant-garde art.
The film follows about half a dozen characters through the machinations of their utterly bizarre fetishes - a woman who gets off by stuffing bread balls up her nose, a man who delights in the texture of live fish, and - well, I'm not even going to try to describe the chicken guy. Though the characters don't always realize it, their secret pursuits are linked by a web of tangents and coincidence.
Though the characters are ostensibly pursuing _sexual_ fetishes, there is very little about this movie that seems sexual. Real fetishes usually involve playing with power or social roles, but these people just like really specific (and really strange) inanimate objects. Their perversions seem to be more about the ritual than anything else.
Though the movie is mostly live-action, there are some of Svankmajer's trademark stop-motion sequences, such as the chicken man's rampage through the forest. Also, there is zero dialogue throughout the entire film, which actually works quite well, forcing the viewer to engage the unfolding events more directly, and contributing to the overall feeling of ""what the [heck]are they doing?!""
Maybe this film is just the product of sheer self-indulgence on the part of Svankmajer, but it will certainly challenge you to think. I'm giving it the median rating of 3 stars not because it's a bad film (or because it's a _good_ film), but because it doesn't even exist on that continuum. It is what it is. You'll have to see it for yourself.",1061424000,8,1807,4.832258064516129
1012589,5,6305337144,"Having seen Jan Svankmajer's Alice (1987) and Faust (1994), I was not completely unprepared for this surreal sideshow from the Czech film maker/animator. Still, it defied any expectation with its unexpected turns and creepy absurd scenarios. Six lonely people are united by the unspoken conspiracy of the title. Secret rituals, fetishes, objectification of the mundane. . .Through the use of frequent tight close ups, minimal panning of the camera, sound (no dialogue!) and, of course, Svankmajer's inimitable stop motion animation, the viewer is drawn into the conspiracy as well. Or just weirded out.",1047427200,2,602,5.483870967741935
1012590,1,6305337144,"Weird, weird, weird, can I say it again, this was an odd one.  I love Jan and all of his eccentricities but this went a little too far.  People are [different] that's nothing new.  To what extremes they will go to is nothing new either.  His visual representation is exceptional and the ability to direct the viewer's thoughts and ideas through his tale are what make him a master.  How ever I didn't find this very entertaining.  In fact I found it a little on the boring freakish side.  That's not bad, but I was not interested in the least. Nor did I care about any of the characters.  What make's the move worth it is the main character and his ""fowl"" demise.  The rest of the movie kinda stunk.  Don't get me wrong, I am an avid fan of Svankmajer's work and have been watching his progress for years.  I just didn't think this was one of his better movies.  I also found the audio tracks to be more intrusive than supportive.  But that's just me being picky.  Buy Jan's work, just get to know him a little better before you try this one out.",1020038400,9,1046,4.270408163265306
1012591,5,6305337144,"Imagine Ophuls' 'La Ronde' remade by a Czech Surrealist, with 'professional expertise' (as the end credits state) from Sacher-Masoch, de Sade, Freud, Bunuel, Ernst and Brauk.  After an opening credits montage of 18th century erotic prints, scored to a lovely, kitschy waltz, 'Conspirators of Pleasure' follows five fetishists whose narratives interlock in bizarre ways.  The first is an unshaven young man who enters an adult shop to buy an adult magazine.  Examining his purchase in his tenement apartment, he spills beer all over the centrefold, in an early example of the film's outrageous visual punning.  He enters his closet for certain private activity (having first checked posters of James Dean and a male bodybuilder, as if he's socially in the closet too), before being interrupted by the doorbell.  The registered letter, written in cut-and-paste newspaper print, notifies 'Sunday'.  He gets to work - asks his blowsy neighbour to decapitate his rooster, modelled on which he builds a papier-mache mask, glueing the girlie pictures to its surface, and then covering it with the real rooster's feathers.
The shopowner, meanwhile, has built a contraption that enables him to 'enjoy' sexual relations with a TV newsreader.  This latter, who finds novel use for fish, peeps at her mad husband, who builds strange gadgets of arousal from items he steals during the day (contraceptives, fur from women's stoles etc.).  The postal worker obsessively hollows loaves of break, making little balls she inserts into cranial orifices.  The neighbour, who leaves used sanitary towels around the house for her cat, keeps a body in her closet and pilfers straw from dustbins.
The sexual needs underlying these acts undergo increasingly eccentric permutations as the film continues, often of a ritualistic or hermetic nature, taking place in bombed out churches, for instance, or a shed.  The film's movement is primarily visual, the patterned images emphasising orifices, phalluses, fluids, hair etc., classic Freudian sybmols pushed to absurd signifying limits.  The film's repetitive logic is that of the archetypal dream, proceeding by transference, displacement, condensation and interruption.
But 'Conspirators' is more than a mere illusitration of ideas from Svankmajer's heroes - the Prague setting is characteristically concrete, entering into a dramatic conflict with the surreal events and Svankmajer's style, relentlessly closing in on objects and parts of the body.  Although there is very little puppetry in the film - Svankmajer, as if to demonstrate his theme, teases us by providing materials and set-ups for his familiar art, but delaying the animation - all the characters are substitutes for the director, artists-manque who use objects from the everyday world to create new, startling, living arragnements.  The film's surreal view of sexual relations and the police is as sharp and funny as Bunuel's 'Un Chien Andoulu', with Svankmajer repeating Bunuel's method of musical leitmotifs for satiric effect.",1017705600,37,3021,5.470967741935484
1012592,4,6305337144,"I make no bones about it, I love Jan Svankmajer.  _Conspiritors of Pleasure_ was a delightful film; it dragged in places, and some segments worked better than others (hence only 4 stars), but it was poingiant, sensitive, and sometimes hysterically funny.
Svankmajer's storytelling does for cinema what Czech writers like Hrbal, Hasek and Kundera have done for traditional print literature.  The Brothers Quay are grimmer, grittier and lack the subtle humor, warmth and humanism of Svankmajer...a side of the filmmaker that shines thru especially in THIS film.",977529600,11,559,5.413793103448276
1012593,5,6305337144,"Jan Svankmajer, whose name is almost always mentioned in the same breath as the Brothers Quay, is an animator with a deeply philosophical, psychological bent whose mode de employ is the infinite variety of the grotesque. If you appreciate Joel-Peter Whitkin's stills, you will love Svankmajers films. Objects animated are people, tubers, taxidermilogical failures, etc.  Svankmayer takes a thousand separate, shocking little pieces and combines them into a sublimely shocking whole. The end product is always bafflingly surreal and so over the top as to be beatific. His filmography is made up mostly of shorts, and two other feature length films, Alice (1988) and Faust (1996), all would be worth some footwork to catch a glimpse of his intricately wrought madness.
 Conspirators is a cohesive series of vignettes about obsessive-compulsive fetishists whose paths cross, in so doing sparking a series of respective erotic destinies that are fulfilled via a spiraling puzzle like path. The movie itself defines fetishism, turning the everyday object or occurrence into a meaning laden ritual; in these cases lives are compelled by a collection of huge fetish projects: the porno stand engineer who is so in love with images that he constructs a television that can be made to love him back; the mail carrier who maniacally turns loaves of bread into compact little balls that she delivers to the news anchor who feeds them to carp who live in a bucket under her desk and get her off on camera (as part of the engineer's project); her husband who hears symphonies in pursuit of junk he later constructs tools that de Sade would have cried over; and a pair of neighbors who obsess over each other's murders, whose will finds a magical way. This film is a must-see just for the exquisite detail with which the nameless protagonist constructs the piece de triumph of all fetish objects- it cannot be hinted at in less than a volume.  These frames speak volumes, a wordless cacophony.  Conspirators could be seen as a sort of ""The Making Of"" a Jan Svankmajer animation- the sympathetic voodoo magic worked by a team of discreet players so intense that genius is sparked and makes vital and gorgeous the previously inert and obscene.  I'd give this film one star for each story's achievement, plus one for the opening sequence of *truly* bizarre 17th Century porno woodcuts. A must see.",964310400,18,2380,4.984886649874055
1012594,5,6305337144,"Master animator Jan Svankmajer delivers another masterpiece with this feature-length effort, following the routines and rituals of a half dozen everyday folks (a man who keeps to himself; a woman across the hall from him; a newscaster and her husband; a mailwoman; and a magazine storekeeper). While still incorporating some very impressive stop-motion segments, this film is primarily live action and amazingly uses no spoken dialogue (so there aren't any subtitles or alternate audio tracks on the disc). Each character is represented with their own background music, and their paths cross interestingly as the events unfold. Examining the hidden desires and fetishistic nature of us all, Svankmajer has his subjects walking in and out of closets both literally and metaphorically. The imagery, as always, is equally fascinating and disturbing. His short film, ""Food,"" is also included on this disc. The three segments (""Breakfast,""""Lunch"" and ""Dinner"") make some surreal statements about the way we all eat. If you enjoyed his mind-blowing ""Alice"" and ""Faust,"" you owe it to yourself to experience this DVD.",951350400,15,1110,5.459302325581396

The movie has music but no spoken words... but don't let that deter you- actions speak louder then words. There is one character in the movie whose sexually deviant actions are highlighted by dramatic opera music- which makes it hilarious.

7888100,4,6305337144,"Svankmajer's feature-length film does what Svankmajer does so well. It baffles the viewer with a breakdown of the wall between literal movie making and stop animation. It creates a bizarre language of visual symbol, draws tantalizing visual alliterations between phrases in this language, creates a syntax of actors and actions, then leaves us without a vocabulary in which it all makes sense. It makes the ordinary extraordinary - the quiet man at the corner, the mousy woman delivering mail, or the majestic woman delivering the nightly news. It shows that the creative urge serves more primal urges, no matter how great or small the creativity of the person urged. Then, towards the end, the bizarre creations cross over between creators, as one person's fantasies come to life in another person's world.

This isn't Svankmajer at his most approachable. It takes contradictory empathy and detachment to explore this movie-world's contradictions. The short add-on, ""Food,"" places itself even farther from literal reality, so is easier to take in many ways. But, if you want your mind to simmer in a spicy broth of imagery and imagination, you'll warm it over the flickering images on Svankmajer's screen.

7888101,5,6305337144,"In his most original (at least from what I've seen), very different from his other films, most disturbing yet most hilarious film, the great magician Jan Svankmajer, animator-surrealist from Prague, makes his modern-day city the setting for the story of six ordinary people with extraordinary fantasies. The film that acknowledges as inspirations Sigmund Freud, Max Ernst, Luis Bunuel (the admitted fetishist himself) and the Marquis De Sade (all of them I am sure would love it) portrays the strange world of hidden fetishes that can be found in the most unexpected places. Three men and three women encounter one another through the day and exchange the knowing glances even though some of them don't even know each other but there is a certain connection and they feel it. They all are ""conspirators of pleasure"" who spend the most part of the film meticulously, painstakingly and creatively inventing methods, tools and constructions for fulfilling their bizarre fantasies. We will observe chicken suit with the wings made of umbrellas. There is a woman-post worker with a fetish for bread. She rolls up balls of bread and sucks them up her nose through a straw (honestly, not my idea of fun but hey, you should see the look at her face). There are unusual brushes made up of rolling pins, pan lids, and stolen pieces of fur that one man, the detective rubs over his body while his wife, the TV news-person feels neglected and buys some live carp that she strokes and feeds them the bread balls which were delivered by the post worker. The TV lady has no idea that she's been an object of a newsagent- guy's desire. He constructed the machine that consisted of several mechanic arms which can hug, stroke, rub, pull...gently while he watches her on TV and reaches his climax at the same time as she does helped by her carps but I am going to stop right here and only add that ""some of our most exciting sexual experiences take place entirely within the minds of other people."" (Roger Ebert - not about ""Conspirators of Pleasure"" but I thought it'd fit perfectly here)

What can I say? The film is a satire on human perversion but what makes it unique, its style. It has no dialog whatsoever but it is not needed, really. The lust and desires don't need words, they speak for themselves. There are the moments in the film when you'd look in total disbelieve at the weird characters and their bizzar objects of longing but you just cant help smiling. It's been over the year since I discovered Svankmajer and I've been trying to see anything that he's made. He's never disappointed me. He looks inside my mind, takes the the hidden desires and weird fetishes that I would never want to be uncovered and I would only admit to myself I have, turns them into the images hellishly disturbing but mesmerizing and hilarious and threw them back at me using his unmatched and brilliant combination of live action film-making, special effects, and his deservingly celebrated animations techniques.

Masterpiece of perversion, the fetish movie to end all fetishes.

Long Live Jan Svankmajer!",1151539200,3,3083,4.813207547169811
7888102,4,6305337144,"Excellent! What a storyteller! I had only seen Jan's short ""Food"" before this, and so had a predisposition to see this film in a mirthful light. I agree with the Surrealist classification, in that it reminds me of Bunuel's ""L'Age Dor""; long introductory scenes that achieve the necessary mundane boredom to launch the ensuing bizareness. A man kissing a tv and spitting out water; Yeah!

I particularly enjoyed the gorgeous arthouse shots peppered throughout; candles reflected in a tub of water, a sudden closeup of a chicken's ass.

The director's method of engaging the viewer is so masterful, that by the end you've become a bit of a detective puzzling out  the connections. Let me get this straight; the mailcarrier delivered the letter that told him Sunday was the day, she made fish food for the anchor woman's fish, and delivered straw to the trash bin for the dominatrix. Do her x-ray eyed looks at each customer mean she knows, or is engineering this whole thing? A mailcarrier's phantasy, perhaps? The blurring of reality was rather intriguing too. When several characters ""achieve"" their enjoyment, ""reality"" seems to stay slightly kinked; is the newscaster really orgasming on tv, did she really give that guy a knowing look, and (like ""Food"") haven't they just switched fetishes now?

A wonderful romp through the adult equivalent of childhood fantasy play. Definitely recommended; if nothing else, the characterization of the detective is priceless! Stealing and molesting passers-by clothing to satisfy himself, Yeah!",1143936000,2,1533,5.194331983805668

7888104,4,6305337144,"Life has its unique peculiarities, as individuals seek privacy and personal satisfaction when societal situations usher them into intimate seclusion.  Jan Svankmajer illustrates these peculiarities through six different city residents that in their own privacy fulfill personal void through their most intimate and personal desires.  Expressed in the most bizarre, surreal, and peculiar manner, the audience secretively gets to experience these desires, as the six characters close the doors while entering a very personal place where only they are aware of what they are doing.

Much of the film plays with social symbolism and human interaction reflected through the character's intimate and personal moments, which are highlighted through clever editing and figurative camerawork.  Nothing is said, only images present the mannerisms of the characters, as the interaction between the characters such as looks and assumptions drive them further into their own sexual obsessions.  These obsessions are all surreal and bizarre.  Some examples are a man building some form of robot that can connect with an attractive news anchor, a man constructing a bird-like head for some personal erotic revenge, and a woman who brings home live fish as a substitute to her absent husband.

The opening credits accompany a number of erotic prints that remove the allusions and directly display what is to come in the film, as the film depicts the unusual fetishes.  These fetishes display bizarrely amusing moments that seem inflated into absurd proportion, yet the human behaviors appear authentic in the moment.  Underneath the surrealism, the audience can reach a repressed and personal side of the characters, as they act out their fantasies in the most outlandish manners.

Jan Svankmajer is known for his often bizarre imagery while using puppetry, stop-motion animation, and other creative visualizations.  Conspirators of Pleasure follows the same trend with the use of strange and outlandish creations through the intimate personal life of six city tenants.  Stop-motion, editing, puppetry, and efficient camerawork brings the audience a truly harrowing surreal study of human interaction found in the subconscious, as elements resembling voodoo, fetishes, and chickens concoct an unpleasant atmosphere.  Svankmajer's cinematic mixture eventually blends into an intelligent philosophical and psychological study of people and their peculiarities.",1112832000,4,2442,5.712707182320442
