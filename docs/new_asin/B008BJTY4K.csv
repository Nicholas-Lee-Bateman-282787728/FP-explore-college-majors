5146106,5,B008BJTY4K,"History Detectives is a fun and educational program. Not only do you learn about the artifact being investigated, but you learn about events and the time period surrounding it. Often there are surprises along the way that make the investigation even more interesting. The producers do a great job of picking items that can be researched in depth and often times seem impossible to track. Yet, the detectives leave no stone unturned and find out more than one could imagine at the outset.",1363737600,,487,4.879518072289157

I looked forward to  watching the program on OPB (Oregon Public Broadcasting)  and now I can watch a little of it through Amazon. Would love to see more seasons of the program. Think this series would appeal to all ages. History Detectives take family heirlooms and research their history to reveal if they really played a part in history or not.
