2752975,1,B000N2HDEG,"Really, this has been a very lazy year for WWE PPVS. A lot of spectation for a match like Shawn Michales vs Randy Orton, for it to end a silly way.  I think people who pay $50 for a PPV deserve at least something more, this isn't RAW or Smackdown, were your get 3 minute main events.

On the other hand, the match between Batista vs Undertaker, was good, also Triple H did his thing.

The rest of the PPV is NOT worth Watching.",1195084800,,427,4.059523809523809

1. Rey Mysterio vs. Finlay in a stretcher match- This was a great choice to kick off the show. There match last ppv at no mercy was really good till the no contest and they out did there match last month. This was only given about 10 minutes but with non stop action this match was very watch able. There were some high flying moves by rey onto finally on the stretcher and just a very fun match to kick off the show. Winner Rey Mysterio. Match Rating 8/10.
2. C.M.P. vs. The miz for the ECW title- This was a good choice by the fans for the ECW title match. A fresh new challenger for punk. Miz was a lot better at wrestling than I thought he was going to be as he put on a very solid wrestling match. There were even a couple times during the match were I thought that The Miz was going to win the title. I would love to see a rematch between these two and great job by both men. Winner and still ECW Champ CMP. Match Rating 7/10.
3. Jeff Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy- This was added to the ppv as a filler but not a bad one at that. It was a good choice by the fans to have these two square off. A big push is still on the way for kennedy as we see in this match but both men busted there buts including Jeff Hardy. Just a solid wrestling match but kennedey takes advantage as Hardy hits his head hard on the mat and takes him out of the game and lets Kennedy get the pin. Winner Mr. Kennedy. Match Rating 7/10.
4. M.V.P. vs. Kane for the U.S. Title- Going into this match I had high hopes. I knew that Kane's matches had not been as good lately and I thought he would step it up. Kane did a good job and step it up here but the booking was what ruined this match in my opinion.  I don't understand why they had to go with a count out cause it just ruins the end of the match. I did not like the booking here but not much you can do. Winner and still U.S. Champ M.V.P. Match Rating 3/10.
5. Randy Orton vs. Shawn Michaels for the WWE Title- This match was one I was really looking forward to. It was a really solid match all the way through. There were some slow spots by orton with sleeper holds but for the most part a fast paced match. This in my opinion was a better match than the one that they had at unforgiven in 2003. The problem with this match once again is the DQ ending. This is two matches in a row were nothing got a clean finish. Like I said a great match by Michaels and Orton but the Dq just ruins it to a certain extant. Winner by DQ Shawn Michaels but still WWE Champ Randy Orton. Match Rating 7.5/10.
6. HHH vs. Umaga in a street fight- This was a great match and made you forget about the two bad endings in a row. These two men worked really well together and I was really happy with the fact that they chose the street fight instead of the cage because you get to us more weapons in the street fight. Non-stop action from the begging with HHH spearing Umaga through the staging area. This match had a lot of weapons to including chairs tables trash cans and sledgehammers. There was a sweet spot were Umaga ran from table to table and hit a big splash on HHH which sent him through the table. A sick sledgehammer shot by HHH after a lot of near falls to put away Umaga. Winner HHH. Match Rating 9/10.
7. Batistia vs. Undertaker for the WHT- What a great way to close off the show. These two have had so many great matches with each other I did not know if they would be able to keep me interested. There was just solid wrestling in the beginning but the final 7 minutes were non stop keep you on your feet near falls. Just a great effort put on between these two and it would be nice to see them hook up again. Winner and still WHC Batistia. Match Rating 10/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give Cyber Sunday 2007 a grade of 51.5/70 which is a 74% which means this is an awesome ppv. I would say that's right. This ppv had two great matches and other very solid matches. The only one I did not like was the mvp kane match. You should pick this dvd up when it comes out as it surprised me and I really enjoyed it. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not ZI would appreciate that.

2752977,4,B000N2HDEG,"Today all of the WWE fans vote for the match you want to watch. Tonight is your night.

Stretcher match
Rey Mysterio vs Finlay

These two put on a great opener. The fought a while before Finlay slided Rey onto the stretcher. Then both of them try to go for the Shelliegh  on the pole. Then Rey does a inventive 619 to Finlay . Then he does a terrific planca  to Finlay. It was a sort match but it was really good. Overall 7.5/10
CM Punk vs The Mizz
ECW Championship match

First off what is The Mizz doing here in a championship match. Any way, These guys start off real slow. The Washington crowd didn't like The Mizz at all while saying ""you can't wrestle"". They do some mat wrestling and reverses. Punk does some very nice chops. Punk tries to do the GTS the first time but The Mizz reversed but Punk reversed again into another GTS to win. Overall 6/10
Mr. Kennedy vs Jeff Hardy

Both of them looked pissed off for not winning enough votes. They really didn't get into any good wrestling until the end. Jeff does a nice whisper in the wind to Kennedy but then tries to kick him in the face in the corner but he moved and Hardy landed on the back of his head giving Kennedy the win. Overall 7/10

MVP vs Kane
WWE United States Championship match

A bonus match that was bad. It was bad because thru out the match both of them worked on each others ribs. Plus it ended in a count out witched sucked. Overall 5/10

Randy Orton vs Shawn Micheals
WWE Championship match

The crowd is into Shawn in this one. Shawn does a nice planca to Randy to the outside. Plus Randy does a back drop to him on the barricade. Randy works on his back thru out the match. Shawn tries to go for a flying elbow for the first time but missed. Shawn worked on his arm thru the match also. Shawn goes for the elbow the second time and hits it. Then strikes up the band 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, goes for it but Randy ducks and low blows him dqing himself. He tries to attack Shawn but he gave him sweet chin music. Overall 8/10
Street Fight
Triple H vs Umaga

H goes for Umaga thru the entrance way but he counters with a headbutt. It looked like they were going in the back but H spears him thru the computer stand. They fight thru the crowd before the head to the ring. H gets a garbage can and nailed him with it really hard. Umaga does this very nice splash to H while he was on one announce table and he was running on the other tables to splash him. Then H gets his trusty Sledgehammer and hit him with it and pedigreed him to win. Overall 9/10

Special Referee: Stone Cold Steve Austin
Batista vs The Undertaker
World Heavyweight Championship match

I never thought but it happened, Batista beat Undertaker. It was nothing like there wrestlemania  match but it was okay. Undertaker does some submissions on Batista and every time Undertaker tries to do something he would counter it. Last time he countered a move he hit two Batista bombs for the win over the Undertaker. Overall 7/10

Its to bad Undertaker lost tonight but this was a great ppv tonight",1193529600,7,3029,4.234375

Stretcher Match: Finlay vs. Rey Mysterio
A great opener, though it wasn't nearly as brutal as other matches like this type have been in the past. Mysterio and Finlay used the stretcher nicely, with both men falling on their backs onto the stretcher. In the ring, the action was a bit slow, but Mysterio hit a few hard shots on Finlay. A nice head scissors by Mysterio was impressive, and then the shillelagh was brought into play (one of the possible match types was a Shillelagh on a Pole Match). Both Finlay and Mysterio took some shots by the shillelagh, but a sweet spot was when Mysterio hit the 619 on Finlay going under the bottom rope and ring apron on the outside. When Mysterio nearly rolled Finlay over the tape, a cord got caught on the wheel, and Finlay managed to get off the stretcher. He took the padding off the stretcher and smashed Mysterio's face into the steel. He went to hit Mysterio with the shillelagh, but Mysterio dodged the strike, hit a flapjack on Finlay on the steel, and then used the momentum to roll Finlay over the tape. Winner: Rey Mysterio. Match Rating: 4/5

ECW Championship Match: CM Punk (Champion) vs. The Miz
This was a messy and just plain sloppy match throughout the entirety, with only a few good parts. Most of the match was a grapple fest, which really doesn't play on the strengths of either competitor. Miz's wrestling abilities still needed serious honing at this point, and he definitely wasn't ready for a Championship match so early in his career. Punk no-selled some of Miz's most powerful attacks, but the end came when Miz countered the Go To Sleep, missed the Reality Check, and then Punk hit the Go To Sleep for the win. There were a few botched moves, including a messed up flying crossbody, and this was just a poor showing overall. Winner: CM Punk. Match Rating: 2/5

Jeff Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy
Wow, another bad match. Once again, it was a grapple fest that nearly bored me to tears, with some interesting spots, with Hardy really giving the match a bit too much. The ending was terrible, with Hardy missing his mule kick in the corner and Kennedy quickly taking the cover and winning the match. This was a stupid match, but it's got its moments, and at least it's not as sloppy as the previous match-up. Winner: Mr. Kennedy. Match Rating: 2/5

United States Championship Match: MVP (Champion) vs. Kane
THREE bad matches right in a row. Yet again, two performers who are usually very entertaining provide a plain bad match. And yet again, it was a grapple fest. The beginning of the match was MVP beating up Kane after MVP knocked Kane off the turnbuckle, but then Kane mounted offense and started beating up on MVP. The match ended after Kane stretched MVP out on the ring post, in a pretty scary position I have to say, and then the match ended in a count-out. What the hell? Winner: Kane. Match Rating: 2/5

WWE Championship Match: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels
Well, we had a great opening match, followed by three crappy matches, so they must have been saving something good for the WWE Championship Match. Nope. Admittedly, this match is better than the last three crapfests, but it still only manages to be average. Michaels and Orton deicde to make this match...filled with boring submissions and grapples. Michaels worked on Orton's arm and Orton worked on, you guessed it, Michaels's back. Some cool spots were when Michael hit a hammerlock back suplex that looked like it hurt Orton pretty damn bad, and Orton hitting a back suplex on Michaels on the security barricade. Things got exciting towards the end when Michaels countered the RKO into a backslide and hit a ton of offense that included his usual stuff, including a flurry of scoop slams and the Flying Elbow Drop. However, Orton countered the Sweet Chin Music by hitting Michaels in the groin. Another TERRIBLE finish to a match that was boring up until the final moments. Winner: Shawn Michaels. Match Rating: 3/5

Street Fight Match: Triple H vs. Umaga
Now THIS is a match! Both Triple H and Umaga are right at home in this kind of match, and it showed with how well it is, and how much BETTER it is in comparison to pretty much everything else on the card. The fight started on the rampway as Triple H attacked Umaga. They then fought on the stage for a bit in a confrontation that ended with Triple H SPEARING Umaga through part of the set!!! Triple H and Umaga then brawled through the crowd, but ended up back at ringside when Triple H dodged a Spear by Umaga that sent Umaga right over the barricade! There was great psychology here, and that's what a lot of people that diss hardcore matches like this don't understand, and that's there needs to be psychology for these kinds of matches to work. Anyway, Triple H remembered he didn't need to use his fists as he pounded on Umaga, and decided to grab a trashcan out from under the ring. He SMASHED the trashcan on Umaga's head in a glorious fashion. The match continued this way, though Umaga ended up gaining the advantage on Triple H and splashing him through an announce table!!! Triple H kicked out and Umaga became frustrated and decided to use a steel chair. Triple H hit Umaga in the groin to block the chair shot and then followed this up by hitting Umaga in the groin with the chair! A DDT on the chair was almost the end to the match, but Umaga ended up kicking out. Triple H brought his sledgehammer into the mix eventually, though Umaga blocked the sledgehammer shot and tried to hit the Samoan Spike. Triple H dodged the attack, hit the Pedigree, and got the pinfal!!! Awesome match with lots of hardcore action and plenty of highlight reel moments. This is what a pay-per-view is all about! Winner: Triple H. Match Rating: 5/5

Special Guest Referee World Heavyweight Championship Match: Batista (Champion) vs. The Undertaker (with Special Guest Referee Stone Cold Steve Austin)
This could have been better, but considering we've already seen these two go at it like a hundred times, we all knew what to expect. A large portion of the opening parts of the match was a boring brawl fest that we're used to seeing, followed with the usual Undertaker spots. Now, this wasn't a bad match by any means, and it's practically Benoit/Angle at Royal Rumble 2003 compared to most of the rest of the card, it just wasn't what you'd expect from a main event. There were still some sweet spots, like Batista missing a Spear in the corner and smashing his shoulder EXTREMELY hard on the ring post. Undertaker's Old School was countered into a Spinebuster, but Undertaker managed to counter the Batista Bomb not once but twice. Batista countered the Chokeslam, but Undertaker managed to lock on the Triangle Choke not once but twice. Batista powered out both times, only to eventually eat the Last Ride. Not surprisingly, Batista kicked out, though Undertaker kicked out of a Spear and a Batista Bomb!!! Admittedly, I wasn't really expecting Undertaker to kick out of that. However, another Batista Bomb right after that ended the match. Winner: Batista. Match Rating: 4/5

BACKSTAGE SHENANIGANS
It's a little sad when the backstage shenanigans are better than over 75% of the matches. The Diva Halloween Costume Contest was surprisingly interesting, with my favorite costume being Victoria dressed up like Yokozuna and some guy whose name escapes me dressed like Mr. Fuji. Shawn Michaels delivered a POWERFUL Sweet Chin Music following his match with Orton, and there was some humorous scenes with Mick Foley talking to cardboard cut-outs of Batista and Undertaker. JBL also aired a commercial campaigning for his spot as Special Guest Referee. Stone Cold delivered both JBL and Foley Stone Cold Stunners, and we actually got to see Stone Cold wrestle a bit, which was really refreshing. Rating: 5/5

EXTRAS
There's a little battle royal to enjoy involving the Divas dressed in their Halloween costumes which is fun but not much else. JBL reacting backstage is pretty hilarious, and JBL is great with a mic. It's a shame he was kept away from it during most of his time as a face with the APA. Rating: 4/5

OVERALL EVENT
Very disappointing. Most of the matches are complete duds with terrible finishes. The backstage shenanigans were entertaining and the Extras were satisfying, if not a step down from what the DVDs usually provide. The main event wasn't really main event material, but the Street Fight is definitely worth watching. Cyber Sunday 2007 proved that maybe the fans shouldn't get to decide things...because the card ends up to be largely bad or merely average.",1248307200,,8594,4.723333333333334
8174202,3,B000N2HDEG,"I have been a wrestling fan since 1996 and have watched all kinds of wrestling. I have a wrestling DVD/VHS collection spanning over 70 all together. This is the most complete and accurate review of this DVD you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

WWE Cyber Sunday 2007
Cyber Sunday, previously known as Taboo Tuesday has always been one of my favorite events. It is not one of my favorites because it of the good matches, or lack thereof. Cyber Sunday allows WWE fans to choose stipulations, opponents, and other aspects of a match. You could go online to vote for each of these matches. This year's Cyber Sunday, while fun as usual, is nothing spectacular. There are a few good matches, with a batch of average ones. Cyber Sunday 2007 is an easy pass.

Stretcher Match (Other Choices- No Disqualification, Shillelagh on a Pole)
Rey Mysterio VS Finlay
Cyber Sunday started with a fun match. An opener defines how an entire wrestling event will play out. Events with solid openers, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SummerSlam-2002/dp/B00006LPHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SummerSlam 2002</a>, have been known to go on and have fantastic shows. This opener is no Angle/Mysterio, but it is a fun encounter. There is some interesting use of the stretcher. Finlay and Mysterio did not just lie on the stretcher like a lifeless corpse; they shifted around and got off quickly. The finish is screwed up due to a camera cord catching the stretchers wheel. Mysterio and Finlay do a good job of covering up and finishing the match.
RATING- 7.5/10

At this point in Cyber Sunday, they begin the Diva Halloween Costume Contest. This series of segments that saw our favorite divas dressed up for Halloween. The fans would vote throughout the night to decide who dressed the best. This segment featured Maria dressed as a Cat. Maria had one of the better costumes of the night. Victoria sported a Sumo Wrestler suit here as well.

Fans Choose the Opponent (Other Choices- John Morrison, Big Daddy V)
ECW Championship
CM Punk(c) VS The Miz
The fans actually decided to choose The Miz. I was a bit surprised, until I worked through the logic. Morrison had been feuding with Punk for months and they were sick of that battle. Big Daddy V is a slow wrestler that is rarely entertaining. The Miz had a clean slate and that is why he was voted in. Miz and Punk put on a good match. There is nothing groundbreaking, but this is still a solid match.
RATING- 6.5/10

After this match, we saw another Diva Costume segment. Mickie James is dressed as an Indian Warrior Princess and Torrie Wilson is dressed as a Washington Redskins football player. Mickie is nice, but Torrie is nothing special.

Mr. Kennedy VS Jeff Hardy
These two men were choices to face Randy Orton later in the night for the WWE Championship. After losing the poll, Raw GM William Regal put them in a match against each other. This is match carries a Monday Night Raw atmosphere, which is not a good thing considering this is Pay-Per-View. I am a bit surprised by the ending, considering how weak it is.
RATING- 6/10

Another Diva Costume appears here. I am sure you are sick of reading about it, but it is not that bad actually viewing these shirt segments. Michelle McCool is dressed as Eve, as in Adam and Eve. McCool does not look that great in my opinion. Melina is dressed as a Vegas Showgirl. Melina is my favorite from this entire series of segments.

Fans Choose the Opponent (Other Choices- Great Khali, Mark Henry)
United States Championship
MVP(c) VS Kane
Matt Hardy had been scheduled to face MVP tonight, but Hardy got a sick injury on the previous Smackdown. Kane was the obvious choice, for the simple fact that he can move a bit. These two actually put on an entertaining match. MVP tries to work over the ribs of Kane, which had been injured by on ECW. Kane turns it around and begins working over the ribs of MVP. This match features another weak ending.
RATING- 6.5/10

Yes my friends, this is another Diva segment. Layla is dressed up as a bad cop. Kelly Kelly is attempting to be a ""gangsta."" These are not anything special. Kelly Kelly does not even look like a ""gangsta.""

Fans Choose the Opponent (Other Choices- Jeff Hardy, Mr. Kennedy)
WWE Championship
Randy Orton(c) VS Shawn Michaels
This is the third time Michaels has been in the poll for a World Title, and this is the third time he has one. Orton and Michaels have always been known to clash very well together. This match is no exception. Michaels has been adding more and more submission offence to his arsenal, and it keeps the match interesting. Orton works over the back of Michaels, which includes a devastating back suplex on the guardrail. The ending hurts this match drastically. These two would have a much better match next month at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Survivor-Series-2007/dp/B000N2HDEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Survivor Series 2007</a>.
RATING- 8/10

We can make it through this, I promise. Brooke is dressed as a Jungle girl. Jillian is dressed up as Brittany Spears, complete with babies to drop. J.R. makes a statement complaining about these segments. I am not kidding either.

Street Fight (Other Choices- First Blood, Steel Cage)
Triple H VS Umaga
This is the first year that a Steel Cage match was not chosen by the fans. This works to my delight though as Umaga is a well-proven machine in Street Fight environments. Triple H and Umaga brawl all over the outside of the ring. There are not many weapons used, but the ones that are used are used well. Umaga hits a sick splash through the announce table. The ending to this match is the first good one in three matches.
RATING- 8.5/10

Finally, it is over. Todd Grisham announces the winner of the Diva Costume Contest. I personally did not like the winner. She was one of the better costumes, but only one due to her popularity.

Special Referee- Stone Cold Steve Austin (Other Choices- Mick Foley, JBL) (Match of the DVD)
World Heavyweight Championship
Batista(c) VS Undertaker
Anyone that did not realize Austin was going to win is a fool. After coming out and stunning JBL and Foley, Austin only functions as a referee. You will sometimes even forget it is Austin playing the referee. This match is great. This is the fourth match in their series. Both men go back and forth before a well-done finish. This match clearly takes Match of the Night for me.
RATING- 8.5/10

-Extras-
Halloween Costume Diva Battle Royal (Raw, 10/29/07)
This match features all the contestants from the Diva Costume contest. There are a few funny moments. Maria has her tale tied to the ropes. Victoria has her Sumo body thrown over the top rope by a couple of the women. This match is nothing special though.
RATING- 5/10

8174203,4,B000N2HDEG,"Cyber Sunday was known as Taboo Tuesday but they changed it to Cyber Sunday in 2006. Cyber Sunday is a ppv concept of letting us the fans to choose and vote for different match stipulations and opponents. This year the fans chosed very good and all the matches were good for the most part as well.

1. Stretcher Match
Finlay vs. Rey Mysterio
I felt this was a good choice for an opener but I wished the fans would have picked the no dq match but I was happy with the stretcher match. Finlay was more of the brawler in this match and using the stretcher to toy with rey. Rey was working with his high flying style to counter and use the stretcher against finlay. A decent opener but I felt the no dq rule would have fitted in better with these two. 3/5

At this point in the ppv, the divas start sharing with everybody their Halloween costumes and this will continue throughout the night. I felt Jillian had the best, entertaining, and amusing one out of the bunch by being Britney Spears. I thought she was the most entertaining and funny one.

2. Ecw World Title
The Miz vs. Cm Punk
I was happy that the miz was voted in for this match. We haven't seen a lot of tying up between punk and miz. The miz really impressed me here, he actually looked pretty good in the ring. The miz applied some nice wrestling holds on punk and there was a couple of nice offensive exchanges between the two. A good match, I liked this one. 4/5

3. Mr. Kennedy vs. Jeff Hardy
Kennedy and Hardy were the two who was left out after HBK won the votes to face Orton later in the ppv. This was another match that was very good. Kennedy and Hardy wrestled a nice match up and they both added a little brawling here and there. Hardy was at his usual with his unorthodoxed and high flying offense while Kennedy tryed to wear down Hardy with holds and other wreslting moves. This was a good match and I felt Kennedy deserved this one. 4.25/5

4. United States Title
MVP vs. Kane
These two had way better matches in the past. Mvp was focusing on the ribs of Kane for the majority and tryed to injured them more. Kane turned the tables on mvp and he too worked on the ribs of mvp. It got dissappointing once it became a count out. This match could have been better. 2.5/5

5. WWE Title
Shawn Michaels vs. Randy Orton
This was a very good title match but it was more of a revenge match for HBK for when Orton took him out earlier in the year at Judgment Day. It mostly stayed a wrestling match in the ring but it got more physical once the match went outside. Orton tryed to cease and target the mid-section of HBK after suplexing him on the guard rail. This too became disappointing after the dq but it had a good after match segment with HBK delivering sweet chin music. Pretty good match for the championship. 4.5/5

6. Street Fight
Triple H vs. Umaga
I was so glad that the fans voted for the street fight and not the cage match. These two men just brawled the hell out of each other early in the match on the outside where they would even crash through a wall around the enterance area. Once they made their way back to the ring, only more brawling and physicality would take place. HHH really gets his mid-section and ribs worked on here by Umaga. The match had a good table spot with Umaga splashing HHH through it. It had a good finish with the sledgehammer shot and the pedigree. An excellent street fight. 5/5

7. World Heavyweight Championship with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the Special Referee
Undertaker vs. Batista
Before the match got underway, JBL addressed the crowd which would lead to Mick Foley to come out. JBL and Foley would have a mix up until the texas rattlesnake made his enterance. Austin came out, stunned Foley right of the box, and then had a little brawl with JBL. A pretty good segment before the match started.

Once the match started, it was nothing but a fight and a slugfest. Austin just stood back and just let Taker and Batista brawl the hell out of each other. The match had some very good counters and hard impactive moves. An awesome match and this was a fantastic choice to close out the show. Great title match from smackdown. 5/5

I recommend yall on purchasing Cyber Sunday 2007. It had a pretty good card. A very good ppv from Washington DC.",1223683200,,4258,4.324561403508772

Stretcher Match:
Rey Mysterio V. Finlay
Great match here great spots and a botched finish due to a tv cable!!! Pretty funny. Rey wins. Great stuff here. ***3/4

ECW Championship:
CM Punk (Champion) V. The Miz
ok match here. Punk is trying to carry the Miz but just couldn't. Punk retains. ** I have a question. How can someone give Rey/Finaly 2.5 out of 5 and give this match a 4 out of 5!!! Is this kid watching the same PPV I am? More on that later.

Jeff Hardy V. Mr Kennedy
Good match here that could have been better. Butis what it is. The right person won this match and his name is Mr. Kennedy....Kennedy. ***1/4 What?

WWE United States Championship:
MVP (Champion) V. Kane
ok match that was just what I expected. Kane wins by countout and kane beats the hell out of MVP. **

WWE Championship:
Randy Orton (Champion) V. Shawn Michaels
Awesome. Just awesome. The cheap ending is to set up another match between the two. people just don't really get that do they? Awesome wrestling and storytelling and the ending fit perfectly witht the storyline. Michaels wins..DAMN...by DQ. YES!! That means Orton is STILL THE WWE CHAMPION!!! Sorry, I got a little carried way. ****1/4

Street Fight:
Triple H V. Umaga
very good match. Good spots here and there. Not really that many weapons which works well here. Triple H wins. ***1/2...Not as Good and people give it credit for but still solid and entertaining.

World Heavyweight Championship:
Batista (Champion) V. Undertaker
Awesome World title match that may have been better than their WrestleMania 23 match. Awesome with Batista retaining in a war. ****1/2

Overall, a great show what was a hell of alot better than what I thought it would have been. However, I have been reading some reviews and how can you justify Punk V. Miz better than or equal to Rey/Finlay, Hardy/Kennedy, and Orton/Michaels. I just don't get it. I know it's a matter of opinion, but come on. Punk is a great wrestler, but his match wasn't as good as the other three matches I named. My mouth was opened when I saw that. Learn how to review Pal!!!!!!!",1215388800,,2144,4.6534391534391535

8174206,4,B000N2HDEG,"Stretcher Match: Rey Mysterio vs. Finlay - 2 stretcher matches in a year?  That must be a record.  Eventhough it was a stretcher match, you could tell they had a plan set up no matter what the match was since they're all no disqualification as they used the sheiligh (sp?) on the pole anyways.  This was a nice opener as Mysterio was bounced on the stretch various times & used kicks that were straight out of Tajiri's old playbook.  Good opener.

ECW Champion CM Punk vs. The Miz - You can tell this was the shock of the night for everyone as very few expected this guy to get picked.  You can tell they were off at times such as when Punk did a move off the ropes but Miz wasn't in position to be hit.  The match for just average (the dead crowd didn't help either) for the most part but Punk made it a better match than you would expect from someone like Miz.

Jeff Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy - Since these two lost the main event vote (who didn't expect that though), they fought each other in a non-title match.  The story behind this match was Kennedy grounding Hardy & not allowing him to do his daredevil offense.  Nice match with good storytelling by Kennedy & selling by Hardy.

United States Champion MVP vs. Kane - Since Hardy got injured earlier in the week, Kane was picked as the replacement over Great Khali & Mark Henry.  This match lasted less than 10 mins. & was mostly MVP working on Kane's rib injury before Kane rebounded & delivered twice the punishment on MVP's ribs with punches, kicks, and power moves to his ribs before MVP eventually got counted out.  This match wasn't much at all but I'll give them credit for the storytelling & selling they did in their short time.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Shawn Michaels - For WWE not knowing who was going to be picked, they sure did put together that Orton/Michaels history package together pretty quickly.  This was a solid encounter as HBK kept working & beating on Orton's left arm thoughout the bout while Orton targeted HBK's back.  Just like the previous match, the ending was disappointing but it opened the door for a rematch which nobody should object to after seeing this encounter.  Great match.

Street Fight Match: Triple H vs. Umaga - I guess people were upset that they didn't get the cage match since you heard some boos after the results were announced.  From the start, these two were tossing each other around & just beating each other down...and even went though the set wall within first 3 mins.  This wasn't a non-stop weapons fest as the weapons were used to make the moves more impactful like Triple H's DDT onto the chair.  Umaga targeted Triple H's ribs & gut at various times thoughtout this high impact non-stop action match.  Great street fight.

World Champion Batista vs. Undertaker with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special referee - Before this match even begins, we got a fights between J.B.L., Foley, and Austin that end with Austin stunning both men.  Once that got out the way, Undertaker brought out the type of performance from Batista that he needed after that godawful series of matches with Khali.  Just like their previous trilogy of matches, this was a awesome match from start to finish that had you on the edge.  Match of the night, no questions asked.

Also throughout the night, each diva would show off their halloween costumes in various segments with the highlight for me being Victoria (and Kenny's) costumes of a former WWE Champion & Hall Of Famer.  Also thoughout the night, you would see J.B.L. campaigning for votes whenever he had the chance...complete with a promotion video.

DVD extras include a backstage interview with J.B.L. after the event & the divas battle royal from the next night on RAW.

Bottom line is that after a bad year for WWE that heavily effected their talent, they started to really rebound here as not only did the main events deliver but the midcard was solid as well from top to bottom with only one exception (MVP/Kane).  I recommend this PPV.",1199318400,5,3997,4.587323943661972
