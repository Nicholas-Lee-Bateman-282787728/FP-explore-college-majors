1419904,5,B00005B20D,"This is truly one sick messed up movie..and it was GREAT!!!..The story is about a fictional Candadian ""punk"" band reuniting for a short tour across Canada..telling lies to the public that a punk legend had his leg's shot off to fuel their concert attendance. If any character in the movie carries a punk attitude it's Joe Dick , a snotty jerk with a bad mohawk . The rest of the band is Billy Tallent who unbeknowest to the rest of the band is planning on playing with another band Jennifer rather than continuing with the tour, a 80's metal head who belongs better in Motely Crue , and a psychotic bass player who slowly looses his mind through the course of the film. The film is an unpleasant sick look at the self destruction of a band , and the grim dirty side of rock n' roll. Made as a mockumentary it captures ugly clubs , alcohol and drug abuse , and nihilism. This film can be funny , sick , shocking , disturbing , and bleak. The ending will leave you speechless..see it
Punk purest don't get too upset...just enjoy!",1009756800,2,1027,4.382198952879581

1419906,4,B00005B20D,"""This is Spinal Tap"" created the mockumentary genre in film with brilliant caricatures of washed-up rockers, and a sly wit that often slipped past on the first viewing.  Bruce McDonald has upped the ante with ""Hard Core Logo,"" his mockumentary about a defunct band of punk rockers who come together for a charity show, stay together for a short tour, and implode rather spectacularly on the road from obscurity to nowhere.
Yes, it's funny.  It's monumentally funny in a nasty, painful way.  You can't like these people, but you can come to love them, unloveable as they are, because they are so completely human and messed up.  Though you know there is no way on earth the band can hold  together you'll find yourself wanting them to succeed.  The performances are amazing; there is not a false note in the whole film.  Particularly fine are John Pyper-Ferguson as John Oxenberger, Julian Richings as Bucky Haight, and Hugh Dillon who gives a brilliant performance as Joe Dick.  There's even a cameo by the late Joey Ramone.

After watching the film i am disappointed. Joe Dick and Billy Talent pull off the punk attitude convincingly enough, but the other two members of the band are a schizophrenic hippie and an 80's era hair metal drummer.  At one point in the film the band members all drop LSD, and in some satanic/hippie orgy slaughter a goat with a chainsaw, and drink its blood. Pointless...  I bought this film expecting an accurate portrayal of punk rock history. Other than very brief appearances by Joey Ramone (R.I.P.) and D.O.A., there was nothing punk rock about this film...

Unlike Spinal Tap, director Bruce McDonald is taking this concept and using it for serious drama. I don't think you have to be in a band to really feel this movie's spirit and identify. I encourage everyone to see it, and I defy anyone to not be affected by it. It's good to see it getting the DVD treatment it deserves, and courtesy of Quentin Tarantino no less. We all know he's a man who knows great film. Hopefully, his endorsement will help get Americans to rent it (and eventually buy it).",991958400,3,631,4.310924369747899

1419910,5,B00005B20D,"""Hard Core Logo"" is about punk rock, Canada, friendship, hatred, burning out, dying young, poetry, and insanity.  And oh yeah, a whole lot more.  Actually, it's about a legendary (but fictional) Canadian punk band, reuniting after five years for one last kick at the can.  We follow them (faux-documentary style) on a tour of Western Canada, as they play shows and ruin whatever's left of their sad little lives.  It's a brilliant piece of work that, although it bears a striking cosmetic resemblance to, owes little to ""Spinal Tap"".
Director Bruce McDonald does a fine job blurring the line between fiction and reality, actor and rock star.  If you didn't know it was fake, you'd be hard-pressed to find the seams in this little make believe.  A lot of that has to do with establishing credibility in the details.  From early appearances by real Canadian punk legends D.O.A. and Art Begmann (not to mention a very confused looking Joey Ramone), to a kick-ass set list written specifically for the movie (""Who The Hell Do You Think You Are"" is a great stand-up-and-shake-your-fist punk tune), to the palpable sweat and stink of the small clubs the boys play, McDonald covers all the bases.  He even includes himself in the mix, in a great narrative conceit, as a documentary filmmaker named `Bruce McDonald', who is the repeated object of the band's barbs and spit.
But the biggest credibility coup is the casting of Hugh Dillon as the Hard Core's frontman, Joe Dick.  Dillon is a real life rock star, fronting the post-punk Canadian band `The Headstones'.  In his first beefy screen role, he acquits himself spectacularly as the angry core and creative force of the band.  He spits, he lies, he snarls, he waxes rhapsodic, and he oozes charisma like nobody's business.  His credibility does wonders in the film's final moment, which would, in the hands of a less capable actor and director, feel contrived and manipulative, but comes off totally legit here.  Coupled with Callum Keith Rennie, a fine actor who does an excellent job playing right hand man/best friend/guitar hero Billy Tallent, the two make a wonderful team.  ""I suffer for his art,"" says Tallent at one point, in a line that perfectly sums up their relationship.  Joe wants the low rent tour to go on forever, while Billy is pondering a move to the big time.  They fit in wonderfully in the history of rock and roll love/hate relationships that includes Jagger/Richard, Lennon/McCartney, and of course the Tap's St. Hubbins/Tufnel.  The rest of the band includes John Pyper-Ferguson as bassist John Oxenberger, a calm schizophrenic who loses his medication and his sanity, and Bernie Coulson as drummer Pipefitter (as ridiculous a nom de punk as I've ever heard), an overgrown child with no prospects, who's putting off ""a lifetime of collecting garbage"".  They make a fine fearsome foursome.
My one complaint with the movie is an intense, LSD-inspired scene of bacchanalia, that fits in perfectly with the narrative, but is too over the top to be interesting.  A minor complaint, that.  Otherwise, this is a well-crafted and entertaining ode to bitter nihilism and Canadiana, that I can watch over and over and over.",986342400,5,3185,4.928838951310861

It gave a good look at life in small town life and angry youth in North America as it would have looked in the 1980's before this sort of thing was commercialized and exploited by MTV, etc. It also shows some beautiful winter scenery of the more remote regions in western Canada.

1419933,5,B00005B20D,I was not disapointed at all with the purchase of this film. It had so much suspense to it and the way it ended was the most unexpecting. It was well done and the actors in it were very realistic as for a independant film.,1137283200,,222,3.9555555555555557
1419934,1,B00005B20D,"Hard Core Logo never made it off the ground.  It was a simple idea badly executed and finalized by a rushed statement about the music industry.  Director Bruce McDonald has crafted, well ... crafted is too decent of a word, he has actually jumbled together a mess of a film that attempts to give us that raw, cutting edge, emotion that demonstrates that corporations don't own the music we listen to.  Actually, I am not sure that was the point at all with this feature, in fact, I am not sure I quite understood what anyone, from the actors to the director himself, was trying to accomplish with this devastating mockumentary.  From the high-school theater acting to the rushed ending, you feel lost and used throughout the course of this entire film.  You want to witness both the high points and struggles for this band, but it is extremely hard when you care nothing about the band from the beginning.  We have seen the punk band film recreated in Hollywood over and over, and this takes no new punches.  Sure, the ""spitting"" is gross, but does that really define a character?  I wanted unique characters that brought with them a passion and a history, not just clichd moments that could be witnessed outside of every coffeehouse in America.

To begin, the story.  Where was it?  What was the central focus of this film?  It was nothing more than a rehashed version of The Blues Brothers, but instead of Jake insinuating that religion forced the band back together, we have Joe Dick demonstrating that corruption and popularity keep the world floating in a circle.  The sad part is that there is no direction.  Director Bruce McDonald tries hard to show the raw power of this band, but instead just creates cheap realism bounded by a confusing structure.  McDonald, as both the director and ""voice of God"", intervenes too often in this film giving us this fake sense of truth.  Unlike the Christopher Guest films, we are reminded often that a camera crew is following this band.  While McDonald may be attempting to make the point that punk rockers hate the publicity and media hype, it seems as if the members of ""Hard Core Logo"" want nothing more than to be ever-present on the camera.  It is a genuine slap in the face for true revelers of the punk rock genre.  I feel as if McDonald embarrassed both this genre and those punk rockers.  Either he didn't do his homework, he didn't care about the topic, or he just was trying to recreate the excitement of This is Spinal Tap, but he failed.  This film from the beginning scene never worked due in a major part to the lacking story and structure, but also because of the poor choice of actors to helm this project.

If this was to be a comedy, as boasted on the cover of the DVD, than one could safely assume that there was going to be actual bits of humor laced between the storyline.  I am here to confirm that there was nothing funny about this film at all.  I don't believe I uttered one miniscule chuckle through the entire journey.  It just wasn't funny.  I do not doubt that audiences were rolling around with laughter during the ""huge"" clich drug sequence, but to me it just seemed so forced and recycled that by that point in the film my mind was controlled by apathy.  I didn't care.  The actors were completely devoid of their characters.  When I watch a film I expect to see an actor bring something new to the table with their character, or better yet, at least bring their character to the table, but in Hard Core Logo, nobody did.  I kept seeing actors playing the part of the punk rock band members.  I witnessed no back-story dedicated to understanding these members of the band prior to this failed reunion tour.  I witnessed nothing that placed my heart with this band as they traveled through Canada searching to rebuild their status.  Thanks to the poor direction of Bruce McDonald (and the complete lack of meaty characters), nothing felt honest, real, or even emotional about these guys.

Finally, another issue with this film is that it feels dated.  I realize that with documentaries or even mocumentaries there is an understanding that perhaps years from now you will look back and laugh at how much the world has changed.  Sadly, with this film, it began in a Goodwill Store, and never quite found its historical value.  There are better films out there that depict the punk rock era than Hard Core Logo.  I was hoping to remember some of my youthful tunes and the power of disrespecting a corporate nation, but with this film I just felt cheap.  I felt dishonest about the true nature of a very innovated music movement.

Overall, I thought this was a horrible film.  Those that have quoted the ending as being fantastical, I would wonder how they were able to fully develop themselves into these characters.  The director was poor, the production was generic, and the full disrespect to the genre of punk rock was hitting me so hard in the face I nearly wanted to get angry at this film.  I guess I did have some emotion with this film, but not what McDonald wanted to convey.  I do not suggest this film, but instead think that you should go out and find your old NOFX albums or Rancid album and truly enjoy what this genre of music has to offer.

1419935,5,B00005B20D,"Hey, if you want to watch something like Spinal Tap see, Mighty Wind, Best in Show, or Waiting for Guffman. This a much more dramatic mockumentary. I'm amazed I hadn't heard of this powerful movie before now, considering it's around 10 years already.  While not a straight comedy I haven't laughed this hard in a while. The acid freak-out scene was almost too silly but the reactions once they sobered up were priceless, hysterical and believable. The sadness that runs through this film is chilling but probably familiar to anyone who has ever known someone involved with the real business of music. Having chased these dreams myself in a similar fashion I always feel somewhat lucky to have given up on the dream and this picture seems to confirm the notion that no matter how long or satisfying your 15 minutes was, there is a price.

1419937,5,B00005B20D,"If you go to Amazon's Canadian branch (at www.amazon.ca), you can order the much superior version of this classic movie. Here's what you get:

A few years ago, Miramax released a bare bones DVD of Hard Core Logo, but now Bruce McDonald has re-released his movie with a new transfer (strangely full-frame as opposed to the 1.85:1 aspect ratio of the Miramax disc) and a new and improved 5.1 surround soundtrack.

First up is the rowdy audio commentary between Bruce McDonald, actor Hugh Dillon and the screenwriter, Noel S. Baker. McDonald and Baker dominate the track at first, but then Dillon gets more vocal (or is that drunker?) as the commentary progresses. There are a lot of interesting observations from all the participants. Initially, Dillon wasn't interested in doing the movie because he felt that most rock 'n' roll films didn't get it right but McDonald convinced him that this one would be different. What makes this commentary such a treat to listen to is that it's obvious that everyone involved hasn't watched the film in years and that they're having a blast revisiting it. They are all clearly proud of the film and aren't afraid to poke fun at it and themselves.

Also included are the obligatory cast and crew biographies and the theatrical trailer that was originally on the Miramax DVD.

Another new feature are two music videos: one for Dillon's band, The Headstones and the other for Hard Core Logo, which parodies A Hard Day's Night (the band in ridiculous wigs runs away from their fans) and features clips from the movie.

Fans of Canadian music will be happy to know that the tribute CD-with actual Canadian rock bands covering the songs of Hard Core Logo-is also included. For those that think Bryan Adams, Celine Dion and Avril Lavigne sum up Canadian music, think again!

In keeping with its DIY roots, the DVD booklet is designed and written like an independent punk rock fanzine that is a nice added touch.",1091404800,16,1940,4.8108108108108105

I went in to this film thinking ""spinal tap"" and comedy and that made me initially disappointed with HCL, but if you go into it knowing what you're going to get - a story about the downfall of a band because of breakdown in relationships, drug addiction, depression, and greed with some light humor in spots - then you'll at least have a chance to appreciate it.  The acting by the two leads: Hugh Dillon (Joe Dick, vocals) & Callum Keith Rennie (Billy Talent, lead guitar) is the high point of the film.  They make the whole thing more believable.

Maybe in the United States version of the dvd it's missing, but i live in Canada and the dvd version is great! It's a two disc set and it DOES include a commentary by Hugh Dillon and Bruce MacDonald that she said  wasn't on her copy. And my version DID include the video for Cemetery, which she said was absent from her dvd. So i don't know what she's going on about. The second disc is actually a tribute cd of Hard Core Logo songs played by other artists. The only thing i'd have to say about this great movie is you shouldn't watch it expecting that it's some kind of comedy along the lines of Spinal Tap. Far from it! Although the dvd booklet gives a cynical, humorous view of the movie, especially with the ""bios"" of the band members, and there are some light moments in the movie, this movie is not a comedy. It's about the darker side of being a rock group and how the group's individual personalities clash and get along with each other as they tour. The lead singer is played by the very charismatic lead singer of The Headstones, which is probably one of the five best rock groups to come out of Canada ever. He plays a character that is very outgoing and cocky and also very obnoxious and arrogant, yet you can't help but love the guy. For all you Americans who put down Canada and Canadian talent, i'll just say this: if Quentin Tarintino himself puts his name on the coverbox in order to help get this smalltime movie noticed by Americans, then that says something right there about how important this film is. Canada rocks! The final ending, which happens seconds before the credits roll, will shock and surprise you, i guarantee it.

Last time I remember it was very hard to get the soundtrack to this movie but the hardcore edition gives you a nice new copy of the soundtrack with a booklet of the whole shibaggin history of the making of the films. I am pretty sure that Quentin Tarantino actually has nothing to do with the ACTUAL MAKING OF THE FILM! But his name is even on the HARDCORE EDITION so I'm sure he gave some help in distributing and making of the HARDCORE and DVD versions of the films and the many others that are appearing on the shelves with his name on it!(what a guy) Anyways it's a good movie and if your into a little cool collectible for your DVD collection and if your Canadian than you should definitely look this one up!,1051660800,3,1213,4.232758620689655

The fact that the word 'hilarious' is written three separate times on the cover of the DVD shows that who ever did the marketing for this movie 1) did not watch the film 2) has a poor vocabulary.
That being said, I think this movie is worth watching at least once.  (The replay value is a little low.)
Like 'This is Spinal Tap', 'Hard Core Logo' is also a mock documentary.  But instead of being so preposterous that it's funny, the characters are heartbreakingly realistic.  From the moment Joe Dick sets out on this road-trip, things begin to spiral downward, leading inevitably to the last scene.  I do not thing this movie could have ended any other way.
I did not think 'Hard Core Logo' was an easy film to watch, but it did leave me thinking about it a day later.
There were a few funny moments, but this movie was not a comedy, not even a dark comedy.  Although the characters all seem to be experiences various form of narcosis, instead of laughing, I felt pity.
This movie is about how the band members of 'Hard Core Logo' refuse to lose gracefully.  No quiet 'Crossing the Bar' for them.  And their leader, Joe Dick, would only settle for blood and flames.",1050537600,2,1290,4.390756302521009

Spinal Tap was an enjoyable mockumentary for a lot of people whether they enjoyed the music or not - the humor and the distinguishable characters were enough to drive the movie.

The film is not high budget, but it makes up for it in the intense character development.  Hugh Dillon, frontman for the Canadian Punk Band The Headstones does a great job as Joe Dick, the lead singer for Hard Core Logo, who convinces the band to go on one last tour after reuniting to support punk legend Bucky Height after an unfortunate accident.
The music is real, underground punk music the way The Headstones play it every time they hit the stage.  The music and the characters are so real that you will forget by the end that you are watching a mock-umentary.  This movie is probably one of the best movies based around the music scene and is perfect for fans of real cinema and real music!

But again, the use of substances for the time periods of each film were very much a fabrication to rock stars lives.  HCL has a raw feel to it, the grainy picture and exposure in some parts I feel don't lesson it's value only strengthen its foreshadowing.  HCL chronicles a road trip that a pseudo-rock/punk band take accross Canada performing in various pubs and concert halls.  A very surprising ending, similar to the climactic tragedy in the french film 'Hate'. The only poor extension to the plot line in Hard Core Logo was the use of travelling.  This device used in writing to push a film along and keep it going, to me is a sell-out.  'Tail Lights Fade' and 'Road Trip' are recent films that have pulled the same stunt. I understand for budget purposes the idea is fitting, it's feasable, but stylistically it could be done better.  In all Hard Core Logo uses Canada's low population and beautiful, vast diversity to accurately portray the struggles and journeys of each characters life in a realistic setting.",1014163200,,1406,4.748971193415638

This movie's just wierd, with two hippies in the band, and a flat ending that exuded no empathy; it's hard to feel for these characters.

It is a consistantly intriguing look at the comeback of a hard core punk band trying to make it big long after its heyday. The presence of Callum Keith Rennie, the Canadian actor who comes to us via England, serves to elevate the material and the acting. His style is natural and seamless. His calm belies a past history of violent behavior that he admits once ruled his on stage hard core life. There is a brilliantly subtle subtext, which I will not reveal. It causes a shock at the end that I will not spoil, but it will knock your socks off. Beware, there is a lot of loud punk rock music. I recommend it to movie fans, independent movie fans, as well as punk music fans. The acting will surprise you.

7936307,5,B00005B20D,"Hard Core Logo (Bruce MacDonald, 1996)

When I finished watching Hard Core Logo, with its insanely brilliant final shot, I realized I'd seen a pretty good movie-- a little slow to get going, and definitely marketed wrong (comparing Hard Core Logo to This Is Spinal Tap is like comparing Shoah to Life Is Beautiful). Two days later, when I was still thinking about all the subtleties of the movie, it occurred to me that I'd seen what may be the most brilliant mockumentary ever created, a movie so true to the roots of the things it fictionalizes that it may well be truer, in a sense, than many of the ""memoirs"" we've seen in the recent past.

Hard Core Logo is the story of the [punk band of the same name], who reunite for a five-date tour after five years of separation-- vocalist Joe Dick (Hugh and the Headstones singer Hugh Dillon, recently of Assault on Precinct 13), guitarist Billy Tallent (Blade: Trinity's Callum Keith Rennie), bassist John Oxenberger (Pin...'s John Pyper-Ferguson), and drummer Pipefitter (Bernie Coulson, who despite a long and prolific career will probably best be remembered for a single guest spot on an episode of The X-Files) quickly find not only that the rigors of the road still suck, but that not everyone is just in it for the love of the game...

I wish I could enumerate all the things that make this such a wonderful movie. The problem is, I'm sure I haven't found them all yet. Just while sitting here typing this it occurred to me how dead-on the dichotomy between the filmmakers' attitude towards the band and the general public's attitude towards the band is; MacDonald comes at the project, initially, through a kind of hero-worship (and again, my mind just made the parallels between the MacDonald-Dick relationship and the Dick-Bucky Haight relationship as the film progresses. Amazing stuff.), while the general public, most of whom hadn't heard of the band before, certainly couldn't give a damn about the reunion tour. Been there, done that. MacDonald nails it.

The comparisons to Spinal Tap are unwarranted mainly because where Spinal Tap is a comedy, Hard Core Logo is a tragedy. There's never a point in Spinal Tap where you don't know that there's going to be some sort of ""oh, you're HUGE in Germany!"" deus ex machina. MacDonald never even gives us the option in Hard Core Logo; it's obvious that no matter how things end up, people are going to get hurt. The self-destructive Hard Core Logo are hell-bent on imploding, and MacDonald (whom, I should mention, is playing himself; yes, this film has ""meta"" writ large all over it, which is part of the fun) is just as intent on capturing the whole thing. What starts off seeing as though it may be a mean-spirited black comedy quickly turns to uncomfortable chuckling, and by halfway through you're wondering why you ever thought there was anything funny about it.

It's been another week since I finished watching it and framed that opening paragraph in my head, and the movie is still growing in my estimation. The more I think about it, the more I realize Hard Core Logo is an incredible achievement on every level. A stunning film. **** ",1160956800,3,3149,4.758241758241758
