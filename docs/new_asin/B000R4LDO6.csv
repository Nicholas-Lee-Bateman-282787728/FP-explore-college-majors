He showed us how and then He left. and in the end, His leaving taught us something too. it is not death or injury that matters, it is living your life without fear.",1210550400,3,304,4.350877192982456
8198816,5,B000R4LDO6,"OK . . . I admit it, I was there !  I was a Member of the Council and one of Father's women . . . and yet I still enjoyed this video to no end !  I wasn't around to be interviewed when Evan traveled to Hawaii so I wasn't a part of this video, but what amazed me was that - 30 some years later, these many diverse people, with such different lives and backgrounds, interviewed separately in locations many thousands of miles apart - basically all said the same thing !

They were moved by this experience that they shared !  Many of their memories were born from those moments !  And all of them are still positive to it . . . no matter how tough it was for them then.

If you want a fun and informative 2 1/2 hour ride into unknown territory - this is it !  Then, I'm sure you will want to visit YaHoWha.org, read ""The Source"" and Liberation and listen to the music !  You won't regret it and you will learn some life-changing information.

Father always said:
""You can do ANYTHING you want to do . . . as long as you are KIND !""

HAVE FUN WITH IT !
