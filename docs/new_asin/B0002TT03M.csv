8031786,5,B0002TT03M,"A 1969 kung fu fusion movie that I love.  It a prelude to hidden dragon crouching tiger, which come to mind. Cheng Pei- Pei performance was outstanding. She continued to play expert swordswomen I ever saw.  Scenic view  were not fake or staged  mother nature at her best.  The challenge to make a movie at this time in the 60's was smart and skillful. A movie you can still watch and enjoy into the future.",1483315200,,406,4.36

8031788,4,B0002TT03M,"Typical Chinese Kung Fu film from the 70's, or in this case 1969. It's nice to see all the actors, when they were still young. Classic fake blood, classic fake stabs, classic death scenes.",1479772800,,188,4.5588235294117645

8031790,5,B0002TT03M,"I'm so glad these old Chinese movies have been made available.  The video CD format was no problem.  The restoration was great.  Beautifully filmed.  Great color.  Typical martial arts melodrama.  Cheng Pei Pei at her best.  I loved it (once again, having seen all these movies many years ago)",1389312000,,293,4.857142857142857

Jiao Lei, the Green Dragon clan leader, goes on a rampage eliminating rival clans and plundering the region with his flying daggers. He is searching for Yu Yuan, leader of Qiankun Sword clan wanting revenge for the death of his son. Yu Yuan, and family members, hide at a friend's tavern; he is recuperating from dagger wounds received in an ambush by the Green Dragons. Yang, a mysterious young man, crosses paths with both clans during his journey. He also demonstrates great skills with both sword and dagger, interceding in situations as they arise. But whose side is he on? What drives his motives? Is he a rogue or righteous hero? Here is a classic story about family ties, duty, honor and deception portrayed in a shining gem from director Chang Cheh. An oldie but a goodie.
