8733876,4,B015KOIOPI,"As a long-time American fan of 2000 AD as a whole but especially Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog and Rogue Trooper I was looking forward to this documentary.  As a whole the doc does a good job of giving a adequate overview of the history of the magazine but I felt that it was lacking in depth and definitely didn't come across with the kind of impactful intensity that the teaser trailers gave the impression of.  Naturally Dredd is covered in more depth than other topics and it was nice to hear about the Ballad of Halo Jones, but the absence of spending any measurable time on characters like the aforementioned Rogue Trooper, Strontium Dog, or even Dan Dare of D.R. and Quinch was disappointing.  The production values of the documentary is solid and the cut scenes between topics are quite good using semi-animated shots of panels form the books (nothing beats Dredd putting his fist through the face of a Dark Judge).  In all, this is a documentary that should be in any 2000 AD fans collection",1496707200,,997,4.6158192090395485
8733877,1,B015KOIOPI,This is one of *the* most boring documentaries I've ever seen.,1496534400,,62,4.7272727272727275
8733878,1,B015KOIOPI,"For something called ""The Story of 2000 AD,"" the actual history of the comic was cursory at best.  Disappointing.",1495756800,,113,4.947368421052632
8733879,3,B015KOIOPI,"Fascinating interviews from some of my comic heroes. But lack of story or drama even for a documentary, not that 2KAD didn't have it, the film failed to portray it. My main complaint though is the terrible sound mix, dialog at whisper levels, music for the chapters was deafening. Had to ride the volume the whole time. Please get your film properly mixed.",1495756800,,356,4.666666666666667
8733880,4,B015KOIOPI,"There's a moment in the documentary where someone says that the important thing about 2000 AD is that it teaches kids not to trust it's heroes too much. The documentary made on 2000 AD does not follow that line of thought. In fact, it runs from it angrily. Despite this, you still get a fun informative documentary about a shockingly influential small time comic from England.

The best thing thing about the film is the interviews with the guys that worked on the magazine. Pat Mills, John Wagner, and Alan Grant were all exactly what I expected. Those are 3 men who's personality comes straight through the page at you. Mills is almost comically energetic at all points in time never staying on topic long enough for you to get bored. Wagner is precise and consistent in his speech. It's not particularly surprising coming from the guy who supplied the raw material for the Oscar winning film A History of Violence. Grant is something a of Peter Cushing by way of Keith Richards mash up that comes off as an affable scarecrow that seems bemused that things have gotten as big as they have. You also get interviews with other super talented guys like Peter Milligan, Alex Garland, Brian Bolland, Kevin O'Neill, Dave Gibbons, and a few others.

It also turns out the interviews can really suck. Andy Diggle comes off as a jerk who seems to pass the buck constantly on his mistakes as an editor. You get interviews from Portishead and Anthrax band members that are just frustrating as they don't do much other than constantly say how awesome everything is. Other guys who worked on the mag can't quit telling you how dangerous they were even though quite clearly it's not all that dangerous, The interviews never really probe the creative teams and editors as much as I liked. It could be that since all these guys are pretty accomplished it would simply take too long. Pat Mills alone would take forever.

Overall, it's a good documentary. You get the skinny in their own words and surprisingly none of the filmmakers intrude into the film. You're treated like an adult that can form your own opinion. It's nice to get that kind of respect for a change from a film. It's definitely worth a watch.",1495238400,2,2196,4.654639175257732
8733881,5,B015KOIOPI,Love this. There are many documentaries that focus on American comics without even mentioning other companies around the world. This is a great piece that details the origins of the company as well as the intentions of the creators.,1487289600,,232,4.9743589743589745
8733882,5,B015KOIOPI,"Been wanting to see the history of 2000AD for a long time. Fun to watch, informative, and it was amazing to see all the creators, after all these years, still as passionate as ever.",1486771200,,181,4.352941176470588
8733883,4,B015KOIOPI,"I won't pretend I'm some hardcore 2000 AD fan I can only remember reading a few issues when I was a kid and being fascinated by them especially the Judge Dredd character and left it at that. When the Dredd 3D movie came out a few years ago I went and saw it at the cinema and thought it was fantastic which when I heard about the release of this documentary 'Future Shock! The Story of 2000 AD' I picked it up not just to learn about the history of the comic but in respect for what it stood for satirical very political themes wrapped inside sci-fi fantasy stories containing  brutal violence and beautiful imagery.

England in the 1970's and 80's was a very depressed and almost anarchic time that gave birth to the punk rock culture and bands like The Sex Pistols and The Clash and the rebellious comic 2000 AD. The creator of 2000 AD Pat Mills comes across as bursting with passion and enthusiasm and it's not hard to see how he would be a driving force for the comic strip. This documentary is full of interviews of those that were a part of the comic from the beginning and go on to explore how the comic lost it's way in the 90's no longer remembering who it wrote for and trying to target a new audience only to eventually realise appealing to the diehard fans of 2000 AD the world over would be the best way to continue on. It is a comic for a niche market it's not meant to be fluffy superhero fare.

Although I wasn't familiar with a lot of the people involved 'Future Shock! The Story of 2000 AD' is an interesting and engrossing watch and highly recommended not just to comic book fans but people of a political bent who question authority. Why it does it have to be this way? It doesn't.",1463270400,,1701,4.27639751552795
