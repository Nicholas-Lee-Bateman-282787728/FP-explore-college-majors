8687006,5,B00P8ZPNA4,The first movie was awesome but this one is where it really starts to take off. Also I love that a little origami gift came as well. Japanese people are so nice!,1446422400,,161,4.0625

8687008,3,B00P8ZPNA4,"This movie is available on Netflix now, or you can buy the Bluray. Only the Bluray will play on US or non Japanese DVD players, the DVD will not. I do not advise buying from Amazon as the prices are higher than retail. These movies can still be found new for around $60 on Japanese retailers that ship to the US sites, and also used. These limited editions come with cards, soundtrack, and mini art book for collectors.
This is the second part of the movie and picks up right before they meet Aegis and ends with the Shinjiro ""events"". If you're buying this, you should already know the story from playing the PS2 or PSP games -and if you haven't...stop...and go get it. It's 10 times the experience. The movie is the game minus the alternate choices you can make. It's well done, pretty true to the game. This is part 2 of 4. Which seems WAY overpriced for 1/4 of the story imo, but worth watching, if not buying.",1439683200,2,914,4.350877192982456
