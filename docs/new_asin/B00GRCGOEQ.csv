8626382,5,B00GRCGOEQ,"Yeah Boss, yeah Boss, yeeeeeeaaaah BOSS. Now if you're looking for some good Bollywood dance productions, this is the movie. The story line was okay but Ronit Roy, maaaaaan, if I could've reached through the screen and strangled him, his character, I would have. Ahhh, he was the perfect opposite for Akshay in this movie. You wanna see a bad guy, a real bad guy, see Ronit Roy in this movie. Talking about a dark, warped, methodical character, pfff. Roy .....",1443657600,,460,4.691358024691358

8626384,5,B00GRCGOEQ,"This movie is a romp and [without giving the plot away] it is about a man having great love and respect for his father and the pain it causes him when that mutual respect is jeopardized.  A great film, the dancing/choreography is wonderful and Akshay and the support ing cast are sublime.

I stringy recommend this film and this seller.",1397088000,,336,4.583333333333333
8626385,5,B00GRCGOEQ,Kumar is a great actor. Some of the scenes had younger children in them - they really did well! The empasis was on the love of father and son for each other. I really enjoyed the ending.,1392163200,,186,4.054054054054054
