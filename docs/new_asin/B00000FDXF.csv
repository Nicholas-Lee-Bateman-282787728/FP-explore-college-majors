8252976,5,B00000FDXF,"Commando Cody is in perfect form as he halts an invasion from the moon. Viewers will have to adjust to the voice of one of the bad guys--it is Clayton Moore (aka Lone Ranger), who does a good job as a perp. The cliff hanging is good here and each episode leaves you wanting more. Production seemed to be low budget, with sets few and sparse. Action is good and campiness is excellent. If you like old serials, you will love this one.",1025654400,5,433,4.228915662650603
