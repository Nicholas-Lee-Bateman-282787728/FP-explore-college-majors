I have seen Some of John Belushi's work on SNL, and in Animal house and I must say he is pretty funny. This movie has alot of funny sketches in it but, it is still lacking alot. I recently converted this movie to DVD so I can watch it on my computer and on my TV without worrying about having the VCR hooked up.

This movie is only about 60minutes long.",1091232000,,410,3.927710843373494

This is SNL from the start. 1975. Its inception. Coming in at just around an hour, you could do with more. The entertainment in this show just flies past. Soon enough, you're grabbing for the remote and winding it back to the start to watch it all over again.
The Blues Brothers are here. Belushi's mute samurai character is here. (If you're not familiar with this, here's another reason to get this). Belushi being Joe Cocker, Marlon Brando (two impersonations he excelled at) and a whole lot more.

Its nice to see a comic on the brink of super stardom coming into his own like this. (You'll also recognise Dan Ackroyd, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner among others cropping up).
Although brief, one of my favorite sketches is the 'Little Chocolate Donuts' spoof advert. That's to my taste and so is John Belushi.",1027296000,,972,4.618497109826589
