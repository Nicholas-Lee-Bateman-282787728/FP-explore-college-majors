8574449,5,B001DE9QQ6,"I purchased this dvd for my grandson. He has never been fishing and I wanted to get him something to encourage him. He has plans to go with his grandfather now.

The other episodes are great too and teach some good lessons. Would recommend this dvd for every child.",1378598400,,265,4.408163265306122
