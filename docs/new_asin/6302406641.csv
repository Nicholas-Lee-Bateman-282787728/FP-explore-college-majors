459108,3,6302406641,"To start with, with the exception of ""Le Spectre de la Rose"", Baryshnikov and Kirkland aquit themselves well on this DVD.

""Coppelia"" pas de deux is a joy, ABT's production has always been, and the pas de deux from ""Don Quixote"" is done in innimitable style.

""Vestris"", Jakobson's solo for Baryshnikov, is a wonderful work and  makes the DVD truely worth owning, if for no other reason than this ballet will never bee seen live onstage again, as only Baryshnikov has ever danced it, and it is a small jewel of virtuosity, both in dancing and acting.

""Le Spectre de la Rose"" is alas, poor. I danced it better, and so did a lot of other dancers. Being Baryshnikov does not guarentee that the ballet will be well performed - one must be intimately familiar with the style of the work, which Mischa clearly was not - that said, it was on the whole a poor and inaccurate production, and I remember my mentor, Nikolai ""Pappa"" Beriosoff, who was Fokine's assistant, lamenting this production at the time.

But the big question is: Why is ""Push Comes to Shove"" missing on this DVD? It is one of the best performed sections of the original show and the live braodcast, one which I often return to  in my library in preference to the version taped several years later in ""Baryshnikov dances Tharp"". Was it that Miss Tharp refused to grant the rights for this DVD? If so, it is a crying shame, as it is great example of her work when the performance was still new and fresh, and a rare record of several of ABT's stars.

So, if you want to see Kirkland and Baryshnikov dancing at their height, if you want to see one of the now ""lost"" ballets performed by it's originator, then please buy this, but please also mourn the missing ballet on this DVD and maybe write to the publishers and express your discontnet - even write to Miss Tharp about it. It is a small jewel and should be preserved and seen.",1145232000,22,1891,4.4479768786127165
459109,3,6302406641,"Three numbers make up this video. The first is ""Le Spectre de la Rose"", Fokin's choreographic bonbon originally created by the mythic Vaslav Nijinsky and Tamara Karsavina. Baryshnikov's dancing is academic, in the sense that he dances ""correctly"", but without emotion. His partnering is merely elegant, when it should be rapturous. There are other interpretations on video, and Nureyev's and Farukh Ruzimatov's are warmer and more passionate than Mr. Baryshnikov's. Unfortunately, the public applauds at the wrong places. About two minutes before the end there's a pause in the music - a false ""ending"", in fact - and the audience bursts in applause, so the first bars of the incoming music are lost. A pity...

""Vestris"" is a solo created by Leonid Jacobson for Baryshnikov in 1968. There's a black and white documentary showing an almost adolescent Baryshnikov getting a gold medal at an international competition in Moscow after having danced this piece. Vestris was a celebrated XVIII century dancer, and the coreography - rather ""modern"" by Soviet standards - alternates Vestris's recollections and actual solos, as he remembers his past life and career. In my opinion this is the best part of the video. Baryshnikov has to perform as a dancer, doing delicate court dances, and as an actor, conveying Vestris's inner anguishes. The two roles - dancer or actor - are separated by a pause in the music and a sort of pantomime: Mr. Baryshnikov makes a circular movement with his hand around his face, as if he were removing a mask. The audience, not understanding it, laughs...

The final number is a pas de deux from ""Coppelia"", coreographed by Arthur de Saint-L&eacute;on in 1870. It is, perhaps, Baryshnikov's best performance as a ""classical"" dancer on this video. As it is a formal pas de deux, his elegant reserve is well-suited to the choreography. His partnering is discrete in the adagio but  adequately brilliant in the male variation.

Only ""Le Spectre de la Rose"" has sets - sparse and insignificant - and costumes are quite conventional",1106092800,31,2051,5.059171597633136

459111,4,6302406641,"I remember when this was first broadcast.  It is a good overview of Baryshnikov, Gelsey, and ABT then.  But I prefer the broadcast with ""Push Comes to Shove"" the best.

FYI: ""Vestris"" was created as a solo for Baryshnikov when he was still a student at the Kirov for the IBC at Varna.  One of the requirements of the competition is that a new (or modern?) piece be performed, and so we have ""Vestris"".  ""Vestris"" was an actual person--can't remember if dancer or choreographer--from I believe the 18th century when classical ballet was first conceived (originally at court of Louis XIV.) NOT, NO WAY, NO HOW the 1400's!!!  I love the High Middle Ages, but that was never a time for classical ballet.  Please do more research before making such comments in the future.",1101081600,4,767,4.67910447761194
459112,5,6302406641,"This, one of the few taped performances of Gelsey Kirkland live, is a must for balletomanes everywhere. This performance showcases both Misha and Gelsey at the height of their fame, the mid-1970's. The technique and refinement is evident in their Don Quixote varation. Gelsey's pointework is divine, and no one quite matches the height of Misha's tours en l'air. Their popularity touched off the dance craze that carried through much of the 80's and is a nice portrait of 2 of American Ballet Theater's finest artists. If you are a dance enthusiast, you will treasure this.",1036454400,50,573,4.979166666666667
459113,5,6302406641,"""Baryshnikov at Wolf Trap"" was the very first dance video I bought.  Several years later, it is still my favorite.  It introduced me to some of Baryshnikov's greatest roles at the beginning of his career in America.  This was his first televised performance in America and it is wonderful to see how his dancing has matured since then.  A very young Marianna Tcherkassky is breathtaking, and Gelsey Kirkland holds her own.  The classical vocabulary allows us to see all these fine dancers at their best.",991612800,14,503,4.870588235294117

459308,5,6302406641,"Why Amazon fails to give top billing to Kirkland eludes me.  She is in the majority of the dances represented and is by far the better of the ballerinas.  Baryshnikov is absolutely amazing, per usual, and when paired with Kirkland he has a tender and loving quality that I don't recognize with many of his other ballerinas.  It is refreshing to see Don Q. version with Kirlkand...as it is more commonly represented with Harvey on film, even though Kirkland was the ballerina who truly made this part...",1338163200,,502,4.747126436781609
459309,4,6302406641,"Baryshnikov arrived in America with a bang.  I believe this was one of his earliest performances in the US.  He is partnered with a scary Gelsey Kirkland, deep in her anorexic period.  Although it hurts to see her so thin and shaky, Mr. Baryshnikov partners her with surety.  His last solo is a collection of comedic/dramatic character portrayals that keeps the audience thoroughly entertained.  This concert from Wolf Trap is worth watching over and over again.  (Don't miss the comments by Ms. Kirkland warning young dancers that her way was not the best way.)",1322179200,,562,4.925531914893617

459312,2,6302406641,"I was very anxious to see this, as it was the first solo performance for Misha since he arrived in the U.S.  Unfortunately, the pieces chosen did not really illustrate his great dancing abilities AND they were all done with no backdrop whatsoever, so it was more like the local ballet school's graduation recital.  I have some wonderful videos and DVDs of Baryshnikov, but this is not one of them.",1293580800,,397,4.6571428571428575
459313,5,6302406641,"I find the reviews by others who know the Dance, its techniques and comparative performances, interesting. Here I simply offer the comments of one who has enjoyed some seasons live and more through DVD. Just how one learns to perform the magic and how different companies have approached the library of choreography, is beyond my knowledge.
Speaking only as one such member of the audience to others who may be similar in approach, I can recommend what is done by Baryshnikov solo and with two different partners as first rate entertainment. In 1976 he was an experienced dancer with considerable experience in some of the best companies. What we see in these brief excerpts hits the spot. As to Kirkland who shares the spotlight with him more than the other partner, it is hard to see her as she is, rather than as we imagine she was feeling in these, her years of horror (as described in the first volume of her memoirs). To me she often seems tentative in her physical contacts with Baryshnikov and in carrying out her movements. I am happy to refer that problem to the more knowledgeable.
As I say, it is a joyful experience. On the other hand, it is a very brief one. Four short numbers, no commentary, which I clocked at about 40 minutes, the official time being 5o minutes. Whatever, at less than a bargain price, it is a comparatively expensive disc.
Note in 2015.  Five years later, remembering not at all that I had seen and reviewed it previously, I found myself prepared to make exactly the same comments. Baryshnikov is a delight, his partners quite watchable, and the disc brief but most entertaining. I remain a  pure amateur with regard to ballet, treating it no differently than in watching Astaire (and Rogers, etc. & so forth), Kelly, The Nicholas Brothers and the others live and on film who were song and dance men (and women) to the core back when I was a lot younger...and they were in their prime.",1276732800,3,1921,4.6304985337243405
459314,5,6302406641,Love this video! I got it so my granddaughter could see (IMHO) the greatest male ballet dancer of all time! It did not disappoint and now she loves him just as much as I did when I was young!,1266537600,,191,3.923076923076923

Her body was extremely thin, couldn't get past that & her illfitting costumes. Hated everything but her.

459316,5,6302406641,"Another historical gem from Kultur; this DVD features Mikhail Baryshnikov's 1976 American debut at the Wolf Trap Theatre.

Because this was 'live recording', the disc is quite short; it is only 50 minutes long. However it is filled with an exhibition of talent and grace that could only be Baryshnikov. There are four Baryshnikov pieces featured on this DVD; two Pas de Deuxs with Gesley Kirkland, one with Marianna Tcherkassky and a solo dance.

This disc features Baryshnikov at is prime, and while watching him, you begin to understand the fervor around his arrival to the west. His spins and leaps appear to happen in slow motion...virtually effortless; his 'hang-time' could easily be compared to that of basketball's Michael Jordan.

The only minor concern about this disc is from a technical point of view; age has made the film somewhat grainy and the sound is in mono. However this is a small price to pay to be able to see one of the best, at his best.

One other observations, when watching Gesley Kirkland in the two dances she performed with Mikhail I noticed two things, first, that she appeared somewhat shaky (nervous perhaps?...who could blame her) and second, how incredible thin she was (every bone, every muscle defined). Then during the credits there was a note, written by Gesley, warning young girls of the the dangers of anorexia and how it could affect their performance in ballet. I thought this was an incredibly thoughtful, honest and revealing  gesture on her part.

Conclusion:
An archival treasure... featuring Mikhail Baryshnikov's at his American debut. A must have for any ballet lover.  5 Stars",1202428800,2,1629,4.966911764705882
