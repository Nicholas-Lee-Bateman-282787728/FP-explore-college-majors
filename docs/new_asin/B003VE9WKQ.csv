8406685,4,B003VE9WKQ,"An imaginary story in an imaginary place that ends with the assurance that almost everything and everyone, except the Astrologer and the Queen of Shemakha are not real, just a dream and a delusion.  The production, by Anna Matison, is colorful and imaginative, taking you convincingly to this almost cartoonist dream, although the libretto, as well as the original Pushkins folk tale have clear mockery of authority. The sets are clearly designed for the theater. I believe some of its dreamy characteristics are lost in the video recording, which is not bad, but not amazing either, even in Blu-Ray.
The audio recording is Stereo 2.0 PCM only. Rimsky-Korsakov beautiful music and orchestration could have been much fuller in a surround recording. The outstanding voices of the cast are Aida Garifulina as the Queen, and Kira Loginova as the Golden Cockerel. The rest are OK, but nothing to marvel about.  The Oriental music of the Queen is beautifully performed, a pleasure to her and watch.  The orchestra is great, as expected, if not for the stereo recording.  It appears there were many young people at this performance, and with good reason, the music is for dreaming and the imagination.",1520726400,,1194,5.015151515151516
8406686,5,B003VE9WKQ,"There is so much to enjoy in this Mariinsky performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's magical final opera, it's hard to know where to start.

The Golden Cockerel is an absolute tour de force here. The Mariinsky gives this bewitching story a glowing, spirited presentation, with richly-hued sets and characterful staging. This has the ingenuity, delight and fancy of a Russian-style Magic Flute.

The production is the innovative brainchild of Anna Matison, an acclaimed 34-year old Siberian-born playwright, script-writer, film director and producer. Here she serves as stage director, production designer and costume designer.

Matison has created everchanging CGI (computer generated imagery) that is so picturesque and compelling - in a  '60s psychedelic manner - one wants to see more, even at the expense of occasionally watching the characters.

With richly tuneful, seductive music and a fanciful plot, one's senses had a field day. Add billowing, pear-shaped gray, yellow and black skirts, giant books, vastly oversized heads on some characters, and a largely muted yet alluring color scheme, and imagination rules.

The opera is based on an 1834 Pushkin poem, itself based on Washington Irving's The Alhambra. The Golden Cockerel is a not-so-subtle dig at war gone amok. It features an empty-headed king, his two doltish sons (replete in huge hats), vacuous bureaucrats and the king's enemy and ultimate lover, the erotic Shemakha. The 1907 work followed the dual Russian disasters of the 1905 Revolution and 1905 Russo-Japanese War, and the political implications were obvious. Production was denied by the Czarist government until 1909.

The Golden Cockerel itself - whose cries warn of imminent danger for the kingdom - is here portrayed by a bewitching young woman (an impish Kira Loginova, in fine voice ) in modern garb wearing a bird backpack. The performance begins auspiciously as she enters, looks around amazed and snaps selfies of what she sees: a huge, enticing, magic box, with a large key on top that will house the fairy tale. Get ready for a flight of fantasy.

The Russian cast features an unpretentious and wide-eyed Vladimir Feliauer as King Dodon, a cool-stepping, snappishly dressed Andrei Popov as the astrologer and an alluring Aida Garifullina as Shemakha, in ultra-long blond tresses and a fetching short red dress. The libretto frequently tickles the imagination. How can one resist such a line, from Shemakha: ""Do turquoise dragonflies kiss the rich foliage?"" This is a cocoon of magic.

The Mariinsky orchestra has this music in its bones and Gergiev leads a solid performance, albeit with a few awkward tempo changes.

Both this and Rimsky-Korsakov's other Pushkin opera, The Tale of the Tsar Saltan, show that opera, with its larger-than-life dimensions, can be a quintessential medium for fairy tales. With his vivid sense of inspiration and fun, Rimsky-Korsakov is the ideal proponent.

The Mariinsky takes precedence over two previous videos. A 1986 Armenian performance has some weak singing and a poor picture. In 2002, Kent Nagano and L'Orchestre de Paris filmed the Russian fairy tale in Japanese kabuki style. Although well done, it may be an acquired taste for some.

This is a wonderful release.",1501804800,,3236,5.286549707602339
8406687,3,B003VE9WKQ,"Stage Director and Costume Designer Anna Matison treats the work mostly as something between a fairy tale and a burlesque and a few other disconnected ideas thrown in. It works magically in act II, which has less burlesque and more magic, though I don't understand all of her ideas even in act II (where is the tent? What is there instead of a tent, that red thing? What is the meaning of the serpent tree? What is the meaning of the magic flowers, and what is their magic if any? Why is the Tsar's parrot dragged into act II wearing a jester's cap and what is going on between her (the parrot) and the she-cockerel - and on and on it goes). She also adds a subplot of a love triangle (still act II). In acts I and III she lays the farce on thick, while keeping the frame of a fairy tale, in addition to a few more deep and inexplicable ideas, like the transition of the cockerel from a modern outside observer of the fairy tale into a character in it, or the crab - what is that about? Then there are the super-huge ""funny"" hats that are stupid and in-the-way, a worn out idea. What is lost here is the subtle political sarcasm (nothing is subtle here) and the subtle cruelty. In acts I and III the bright colors of white and yellow do not come off well on my screen. More annoyingly, the camera work and in particular the editing are edgy and hyperactive in act I, cutting too often from one camera to the next and quite distracting. It's less of a problem in act III and act II is almost free from these problems. Act II is almost perfect - it seems they use different cameras or different positions for act II, the camera work and angles are actually quite exciting here, and the editing is a lot more sensible.

Aida Garifullina is stunning as Queen of Shemakha - gorgeous, sexy, seductive and in great voice - she is the major (or only) attraction here. Bass Vladimir Feliauer as Tsar Dodon is adequate. He doesn't have the low notes, nor does he try to act with the voice as has been traditionally done - Evgeny Nesterenko sang it like a semi-drunk retard, Artur Eisen like a pompous, menacing idiot - every bass brought out the theatrical aspect and gave the character a specific flavor of dumb, but Vladimir Feliauer is a no-frills Tsar Dodon. All the rest are small roles and they are done well. It all could have been so much more if Gergiev concentrated, cared and endeavored to bring out the fine points of musical phrasing that underpin the subtle humor in the outer acts, but it seems that Rimsky Korsakov doesn't challenge him here or even interest him. It matters less in act II, where Gergiev keeps things together and well paced and that's enough for the magic to work. The outer acts, however, require more attention to detail to work. Comparing Gergiev to almost any other conductor in this work (Svetlanov/Bolshoi 1988, Dmitri Kitaienko/Bolshoi 1987; Alexander Gauk's first recording from 1950 on Aquarius, even Kent Nagano on the only other blu-ray from 2002) demonstrates how Gergiev falls short here.

This was taped in Mariinsky II and body mikes were used. It sounds they did a good job, the sound is pleasant though lacking in ambiance, until you compare it to the only other blu-ray, Kent Nagano with Mariinsky forces and the Orchestre de Paris in the Chtelet in 2002. No body mics were used there, and it immediately becomes obvious that without body mics the voices have more presence, more realism, they are more exciting because they sound real in a real acoustic context. At least the Russian sound engineers of the release under review here don't have all voices come from the center like lazy Italian sound engineers of Dynamic or of DeLirica Recording Studio do, but the voices don't move on stage like they do in the Chtelet blu-ray. In fact, the Chtelet blu-ray is preferable to the current one in every way, except one major one: act II and the incomparable Aida Garifullina.",1496275200,10,3915,4.543909348441926
8406688,1,B003VE9WKQ,"I sent the first CD back as it didn't work.  I received a second CD and it didn't work either.  I tried them on three different CD players and there was never any sound.  I think these were made for European electronics rather than the US, even though it didn't say so.  It just said it would play in all regions, but didn't say where those regions were.  It was a big disappointment to think there isn't a copy that would play.",1490486400,,428,4.170731707317073

8406690,4,B003VE9WKQ,"The set was amazing.  It was complex and multidimensional.  The first act was inside the kings palace.  The 2nd act was on a battlefield and the third outside the palace.  There were lots of Russian inflected architecture in the set. The video was clear but lacked significant detail.  Every so often the camera would lose focus.  The sound was reasonable, though monophonic.  The English subtitles had some very ""interesting"" translations.  Some of the subtitle lines were blurred and could not be read -- but not enough to make them unhelpful.  I thought the singers were fine, but I have never seen this opera live nor have I listened to any other version.  Though the production was videotaped in 1986 it seems like it came from a much earlier period.",1382227200,5,755,4.782945736434108
8406691,5,B003VE9WKQ,"I bought this DVD for someone who is 85 & that saw that it was available & this is his revue of it.

I had never seen a production of ""Golden Cockerel"" as an opera, only as a ballet way back in 1939.
This opera production was wonderful to see, the costumes, scenery & singing left nothing to be desired.
top marks 5/5",1329955200,5,317,4.031746031746032
8406692,4,B003VE9WKQ,"Le Coq d'Or (as it's best known) is the last, arguably the best & unarguably the most popular (deservedly so, I think) of Rimsky-Korsakov's 12 operas.  I fell in love with it back in the '60s, when I attended a New York City Opera English-language production with Beverly Sills & Norman Treigle.  I subsequently bought an LP recording of this production, now available on CD, & now that I've become aware that this production also exists on a DVD, I'm planning to get that as well.

Meanwhile, I very much looked forward to ""seeing"" this opera again on the new VAI DVD, & I was only slightly disappointed.  Not by the ""traditional"" production, which is visually superb, with sets & costumes just right for this colorful, exotic, extravagant, off-kilter fairy tale.  And the gorgeous score is well-played & well-sung.

So why only 4 stars instead of 5? 2 reasons:
1. Ellada Chakhooyan as the Queen & Grigor Gondjian as Dodon don't have particularly attractive voices, and lack both the succulent vocal timbres & exuberant theatricality that Sills & Treigle so memorably brought to these roles;
2. the film was shot in what can only be described as ""low-definition.""

But for anyone who doesn't know this wonderful opera, with its wonderful melodies & very funny libretto, as well as for those who, like me, are already familiar with its many charms, this DVD is highly recommended.",1285718400,14,1380,4.846808510638298
