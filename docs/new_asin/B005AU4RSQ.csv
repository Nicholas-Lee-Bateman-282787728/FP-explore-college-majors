8463591,5,B005AU4RSQ,"This is a excellent action film that has fast paced stylish violence. If you like violent thillers from the early 1970's, then this one
is for you. Great screenplay, a superb musical score, and action sequences directed by the late Bob Simmons who was the action
coordinator of the early James Bond films. Unfortunately, this film is never seen on American television. Definitely worth owning
on DVD.",1365811200,,400,4.985074626865671
8463592,1,B005AU4RSQ,"I never actually got to watch the DVD I ordered since I was shipped the one for region 2 which doesn't play in the US. However, after reading the review which said they had moved the location, I don't think I will re-order it. I was very disappointed in another Maclean product that had also suffered a transatlantic shift ""The Satan Bug"". Some novels just don't transplant well. And the dialogue was the one of the best features of When Eight Bells Toll",1357862400,,454,4.481927710843373
8463593,1,B005AU4RSQ,"This is a DVD that is for European DVDs only.  Will not play on US DVDs. Waited for years to obtain this film on DVD, but when I purchased it there was no information that it was for only European viewers.  I could not view it.  Returned it to the vender, and have had no acknowledgment of receipt or refund as requested.  Very, very disappointed.  Also, Amazon has been of no assistance in obtaining a refund, although I previously rated the vender as unsatisfactory.  This a rating of the vender, not the video.  I know that the film is first rate, which is why I purchased it - I'm still waiting to view it.",1356220800,,610,4.298245614035087
8463594,4,B005AU4RSQ,"The bad news first:  for Alistair Maclean fans looking for a taut cinematic translation of his 1966 thriller ""When Eight Bells Toll"", this 1971 British effort isn't it.  Event though Maclean gets a screenplay credit, this is a pretty loose adaptation of his novel. The major story elements are recognizable, but the leading characters are played rather differently and some plot elements have been rearranged.  The hero's superb inner dialogue that drove the narrative of the original novel largely goes missing here.

The good news is that if you never read the novel, or don't really remember it, this isn't a bad little thriller.  It features a young and slim Anthony Hopkins as a British Naval officer and ruthless agent on the trail of gold bullion thieves in the rugged West Highlands of Scotland.  It includes some very decent location shooting in Scotland, along with some credible local actors.  The action sequences, including the underwater scenes, are not bad, and refreshingly, aren't larded over with special effects.  There is a bumbling senior agent and a femme fatale, and some nasty villains.  The plot is a little complicated and hard to follow, but it's all there if the viewer pays attention.  The seventies fashions, slang and music score practically make it a period piece drama.

""When Eight Bells Toll"" is cautiously recommended as an entertaining period piece of British cinema and adaptation of a bestselling novel.",1356134400,4,1442,5.093617021276596
8463595,1,B005AU4RSQ,This movie is a poor representation of the book. The story was modified so much that the characters don't have the same traits and the story line is simplistic; the music is silly Read the book; forget about the movie.,1356048000,,218,4.475
