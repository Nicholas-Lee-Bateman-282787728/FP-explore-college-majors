2836890,2,B000QF5FHW,"If you need inspirational cheerleading, this is the DVD for you.

I love the Suze Orman TV show and wait eagerly to see more, so, I ordered a few of her products. In this first to arrive DVD ""Women & Money"" Suze recounts her path into the big boy's world of financial investment and brokerage. She enthusiastically outlines an overview of characteristics and attitudes that she deems necessary to achieve and maintain control and prosperity of your money as a woman in America. For example, be happy and be able to say your name proudly, boldly, with confidence.

This type of encouragement could be labeled ""inspirational"", but, Suze could have been chatting about grocery shopping and it would be inspirational coming from her. In a DVD on the subject of women and money though I expected a portion of real meat and potatoes to put on my plate, some actual practical information and content to digest and nourish the growth of my financial autonomy. In that respect this DVD was lacking.

Back to the TV show for me.",1199923200,20,1018,4.707865168539326

8195915,5,B000QF5FHW,I just want to say this applies to everyone else as well.  First time I saw it was on PBS and decided to get the DVD eventually.  Lots valuable lessons for all of us.  Funny thing about Suze is you get to learn little bit about yourself.  Little difference between Logic and Feelings; and little self improvement in the process.,1250726400,4,328,4.416666666666667
8195916,5,B000QF5FHW,"This is the book I've been waiting for but putting off reading. Doesn't make sense, does it? I shy away from financial ""stuff."" But a few of us (women) get together (have wine) as a group and discuss the next steps. We support each other, offer help, etc. Together we are doing the monthly plans. It is terrific. This book is easy to read and understand. We are having a great time and accomplishing SO much. Things that we knew we needed to know and do but weren't organized enough (alone) to do them. I highly recommend this book to every woman out there, whether in a relationship or not. Buy it! Read it! Do it!",1236211200,3,615,4.310344827586207
8195917,3,B000QF5FHW,"I bought this for my daughter, who really lacks a lot of knowledge about money. We did teach her but when she left home for her first ""real job"" she seemed to have forgotten how to manage her money.  Most of the information presented is common sense advice about setting money aside for savings, not burying yourself in debt, etc.  It's presented in a humorous, factual, matter-of-fact way that makes the content interesting.

I did find some of the information a little condescending but mostly it's great.  I've been managing my own money for 30 years and perhaps that's why I felt this way.

This subject should be taught in middle to high school grade to every child in the US.",1233619200,,681,4.595041322314049

8195920,5,B000QF5FHW,"Suze is Direct! and she calls it as it is. If you are in debt she helps you see why you got there - because its about you - your values,perceptions and programming - of you and money. A Resource for Men & Women, Teenages, Elderly a must have if you want to learn about YOU and your money - no one will look after your money like YOU!",1212624000,3,333,3.8405797101449277
