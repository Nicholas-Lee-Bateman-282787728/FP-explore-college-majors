3048114,4,B001072DG6,"I somehow missed the Teddy Ruxpin craze when I was a kid, even though I am from that generation. I came across the first few episodes on VHS that my husbands grandmother had recorded off TV, sadly it was only the first three episodes of a continuing story, so I bought it immediately on DVD! This show is classic 80's cartoon in every way! High adventure, a message of caring for your friends and doing the right thing and other positive and general morals, without shoveling it on too thick and plenty of quick wit that doesn't treat children like idiots or make adults want to stab themselves. I particularly enjoy the verbal sparing between Tweeg and his head lackey, L.B. the bounder.",1218326400,,688,4.6016260162601625
3048115,5,B001072DG6,The first ten episodes were released a few years ago with promises for the rest of the series but FINALLY we have the full 65 episodes.  These first 20 start of the series as Teddy and Grubby explore the land of Grundo.  An absolute must have for the next generation.,1217376000,,267,4.32
3048116,5,B001072DG6,"Unlike the abortive 2007 release, this version sports twice of number of episodes per set, better quality AND is going to have the FULL series, all 65 episodes by July 22nd 2008. The first 10 episodes establish many of the characters so its pace is metered. Video quality is better in this release although it seems that these DVDs were mastered from broadcast U-Matics. A few episodes have audio warble at the beginning. Otherwise audio is clear and in `generated' Dolby 2-channel stereo, thus there isn't any audio panning of sounds or conversations. There is also red chroma bloom on a few episodes, an artifact of the videotape. Those of us with equipment to do so will want to run the video with a comb filter. The colours otherwise are properly saturated and honestly for most people these issues will be unnoticeable. That being said I'd dearly love to see a genuine DVD Blu-ray set made from a film transfer since this whole series was hand animated. Somewhere there HAS to be a film copy of this show.",1210809600,2,1010,4.679775280898877
3048117,4,B001072DG6,"Great cartoon. Good collection, especially at this price.
I was watching one episode with my 3 year old nephew and even though he could not understand one word that was said, he did love the airship.

This show is more or less timeless and can still be shown to todays youth. Might even be a pleasant change from ""wings"" & ""Bratz""",1209945600,,330,4.409836065573771
3048118,4,B001072DG6,"I got this at Wal-Mart for $5. This is a value set indeed, and yes, though the quality is hit and miss, it is an old show, more than 20 years old, and so I am  quite pleased with what is offered here. The picture is clear, a bit grainy at times, but on the whole doesn't detract from one's enjoyment of the show. This was a nostalgic buy for me, as I used to watch the show with my younger siblings back when we were kids.

3048119,4,B001072DG6,"This DVD-set brings back great childhood memories, the first episodes of this series are the best I think, I used to watch them over and over again when I was at the age of 8. The video quality isn't constant and differs from episode to episode as is the audio quality. In some episodes there are colour problems and a few audio pops here and there but hey that is to be expected from a show that aired in the early 80s. Overall I'm totally satisfied with this set and I sincerely hope that they release the whole series.",1202860800,,521,4.2727272727272725
3048120,4,B001072DG6,"For as old as this show is, it appears Mill Creek found the best quality episodes they could. The early episodes suffer a bit in quality, and there are parts that are clearly transferred from VHS, namely the next episode previews. However, by ""Grubby's Romance"", the episodes improve by leaps and bounds in quality.

One of the things no one has yet remarked on is that this show seems perfect for young viewers (4-7) with plenty of adventure and excitement without the smarminess or flippancy of modern kid's shows. Plus the continuous plot is a real plus in this show - the further you go in the show, the more you want to see what happens. As opposed to the earlier review, once the gang find the crystals, things tend to get moving faster. I think we'll see more of the plot tie together in the next volume. The only thing that could really wreck the show is if the other sets are not released - with a show like TR, you need to see the show in order to unravel the mystery. Highly recommended for the young - especially since the new toys are out, with affordable multipacks of books and ""tapes"" for the new Teddy Ruxpin by Backpack Toys.. My future daughter will hopefully spend some fun hours with Teddy.",1202169600,6,1211,4.454954954954955

It arrived to their house in the shape they said it was in, has no problems playing (LOL....& Get played and watched about 6 times a day, trust us!!), and these 3 gorgeous girly girls absolutely love seeing it start and then spending time watching it! We've already gone back and bought 2 more dvd's from this vendor in fact, and give them our highest recommendation...., 10 out of 10 stars !! Thanxx!

8237324,3,B001072DG6,"My husband has 2 videos of Teddy Ruxpin leftover from his childhood, and we were so happy to finally be able to find out what happens in the rest of the series. But...We made it through maybe 3 or 4 episodes before it started skipping uncontrollably. We got so frustrated with it that we turned it off.
We have tried everything...even went out and bought a new dvd player cleaner. Nothing has worked.
The first disc has wierd shaped ""swirls"" on the shiny part. You know how you can look at the shiny side and see faint rings/grooves? Well, these are sort of oblong and odd shaped. We think it may have something to do with the skipping. But the second disc looks fine and it skips also.

I would say, you could take a risk and try this for yourself. Maybe we just got a bad set.
It is nice to be able to watch this series. And our boys find it exciting and adventurous. Our 3 year old asks about it often. So it is still relevant to today's kids.",1224806400,,946,4.197802197802198
