Being able to compare background factors of each person's take on the term was very insightful. The film captured the essence of womanhood in so many ways, even has hints of improve HUMOR through some of the interview footages. Definitely had me question my own moral and values as I watched. Very stimulating!",1506988800,,430,4.824324324324325
8576332,4,B00C1TEGBC,"This film is like no other in that it allows you to learn about stereotypes and the opinions of what a ""independent"" woman is. I would suggest watching this film with a group of people because it will definitely be a conversation starter! Miss Independent will make you question what independence is as a woman and in other women, it also discusses relationships. I would recommend this film and watch it with friends and let the discussions flow!",1369180800,,447,4.743589743589744
