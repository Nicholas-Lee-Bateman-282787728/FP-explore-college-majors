8049943,2,B0007P0YDQ,"This is the second DVD 4-event set from WEW, live from a
sports bar in Dover Delaware.

This league features a few women of great potential to be
stars in the world of women's wrestling, such as Alexis Laree,
Tai ""Killer"" Weed, and GI Ho.  Each of four events features
about 5 or 6 matches, with backstage activity, and a bit of
comedy.

However, they made some frustrating mistakes:
1. Too much talk.  Too much of the disk space is wasted on
guys in the ring yammering, and backstage non-sense.
2. Half the matches include MEN wrestling, and guess what,
whenever it's man vs. woman, the woman always wins.
3. Many of the matches are edited.  In the middle of some
good wrestling action, the match is jumped forward.
4. Poor camera work.  Too much showing drunks guys in the
crowd, and close-ups of men's rear-ends.
5. A lot of junk you want to fast-forward through, such a
match between two handicapped men, a chaotic battle royale
in which half the competitors are men, and 5-minute tirades
with the microphone before matches.

On the positive side: some of the other wrestlers worth seeing
are Sinnamon, Annie Social, Persephone, Candy, Psycho Bitch,
Prime Time Amy Lee, Simply Luscious, Missy the Schoolgirl,
Riptide, and others.  Unfortunately, Brittney the Schoolgirl
is not featured.

Also, if you like some comedy, ""The Smoke"" (a hilarious take-off
on The Rock) appears several times.  Also, if you think that
Papa Mae and the Mae family are funny (I don't) they also
appear throughout.",1118880000,26,1494,4.80078125
