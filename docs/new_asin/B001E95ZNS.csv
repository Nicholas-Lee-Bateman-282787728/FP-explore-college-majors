3547137,4,B001E95ZNS,"Sitting through a movie about sibling rivalry at a wedding, especially one starring the doe-eyed and normally facile Anne Hathaway, sounds like a potentially painful way to spend an evening. However, as directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Jenny Lumet (daughter of master filmmaker Sidney Lumet), this 2008 drama is not a lightweight star vehicle  la Julia Roberts circa 1997 but a darkly realistic look at the dysfunction within a family thrown into disarray. Using an almost cinma vrit style, Demme explores how a wedding reopens old wounds within a family in a naturalistic way made all the more palpable by the emotional acuity in Lumet's screenplay.

The focus is on Kym, a chain-smoking former model who has spent the last several months in rehab. As a substance abuser whose only armor is cutting sarcasm, she is absurdly hopeful that her sister Rachel's wedding will be a harbinger for unconditional love from her upscale Connecticut family. Therein lies the problem as her narcissism provides the catalyst for long-simmering tensions that uncork during the preparations for a lavish, Indian-themed wedding weekend (the movie's working title was ""Dancing with Shiva""). It soon becomes clear that Kym's link to a past tragedy is at the core of the unpredictable dynamics that force confrontations and regrettable actions among the four principal family members. Rachel appears to be Kym's sensible opposite, but their alternately close and contentious relationship shows how they have not fully recovered from past resentments. Their remarried father Paul is a bundle of loving support to the point of unctuous for both his girls, while their absentee mother Abby is the exact opposite - guarded and emotionally isolated until she is forced to face both her accountability and anger in one shocking moment.

Anne Hathaway is nothing short of a revelation as Kym. Instead of playing the role against the grain of her screen persona, she really shows what would happen if one of her previous characters - say, Andy Sachs in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Wears-Prada/dp/B000J103PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Wears Prada</a>&nbsp;- went another route entirely. The actress' studiousness and persistence are still very much in evidence, but the story allows her to use these traits under the guise of a self-destructive, often unlikable addict who gains attention through her outrageous self-absorption. As the put-upon title character, Rosemarie DeWitt realistically shows Rachel's sense of pain and resentment as the attention veers to Kym during plans for the most important day of her life. Bill Irwin is winning as the unapologetically grateful Paul, but it's really Debra Winger who steals her all-too-brief scenes by bringing the remote character of Abby to life. Now in her early fifties, the famously tempestuous actress seems to rein in her innate fieriness to play a woman who consciously disconnects herself from the family she raised. What remains is a crumbling faade of propriety masking this obvious gap. It's similar to Mary Tyler Moore's turn as the cold mother in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ordinary-People/dp/B000055ZFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ordinary People</a>, but casting the normally vibrant Winger (who probably would have played Kym a quarter century ago) is a masterstroke.

The film is not perfect. Demme's home-video approach, while novel at first, proves wearing over the 114-minute running time. Pacing is also a problem, especially when the focus turns to the minutiae of the wedding ceremony and reception. I wish Demme could have cut this part of the film, so we could get to the icy, unfinished resolution sooner. As a filmmaker who obviously enjoys making music concert films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stop-Making-Sense/dp/B000021Y7X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stop Making Sense</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neil-Young-Heart-of-Gold/dp/B000F48D00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neil Young - Heart of Gold</a>), there are quite a few musical performances presented in total. However, for non-aficionados, it may prove too much over time. While it's refreshing to see interracial marriages treated so casually (Lumet's grandmother is legend Lena Horne), Demme makes almost too big a point in presenting a global community though the diverse music and the wedding's multi-cultural themes. The movie starts to feel like a Putumayo collection of third-world performances. Still, Demme's intentions can't be faulted, and neither can the piercing work of Hathaway and Winger.",1223769600,77,4715,5.929411764705883

Unimportant  scenes was streeeetched out so long.  Scenes that had nothing to do with the story itself.  The wedding rehearsal dinner scene was the WORST.  It went on forever... speech after boring speech.  The music and dancing scenes went on and on and on.  Then oddly enough,  the important scenes were extremely short almost like a flash and then gone.  The scene where Hathaway's character fights with her mom and it comes to blows.  The entire scene was over in one minute.  It went from talking to yelling to hitting in sixty seconds and was over.  I finally turned it off three quarters through and didn't care how it ended.

3547231,5,B001E95ZNS,"If you like Mike Leigh movies like ""Another Year"" (and I do), then you will like this movie -- one that I like to think Leigh might have made had he been an American paying attention to rich people rather than an Englishman focusing on the lower- to middle-middle class.  I mean all of that as a compliment: this movie tells us all that we need to know about the characters and yet has the openended-ness or inconclusiveness of life itself.  The gestures that in Hollywood movies tie everything up satisfactorily are present here -- revelations, confrontations, hugs -- but they don't settle anything.  They just let us see the characters that bit more clearly but don't offer any ""happy-ever-after"" guarantees.  The character in this movie who is parallel to Mary in ""Another Year"" is Kym -- superbly played by Anne Hathaway -- the sister in rehab who is given a furlough to attend her sister Rachel's wedding.  Clearly she has been struggling for a while, and (as in ""Another Year"") the more settled characters are walking on eggs around her, especially since the wedding weekend is overflowing with alcoholic beverages.  And as the movie goes on, those settled characters -- especially Rachel and her parents and friends -- seem to reveal the strains and stresses beneath that settled exterior.  The movie is really an ensemble effort, Bill Irwin and Debra Winger (as Rachel's and Kym's divorced parents), Rosemarie Dewitt (Rachel), Mather Zickel (Kieran), Anisa George (Emma), and Tunde Adebimpbe (Sidney, the bridegroom) all very good.  If the emotional temperature is a bit higher than in ""Another Year,"" it's because this isn't any weekend.  Rachel's getting married, and everybody is going a little crazy, quite apart from Kym's presence.

The movie is also, I think, a gentle satire on a class of people -- let's call them aesthetic upper-middle-class types -- who have enough money to do what they like and don't really care about taste.  Rachel and Sidney are organizing their own wedding, and it's just terrible -- a cross-cultural, new-agey, self-indulgent mishmash, that comes near at times to being cringe-worthy, even without Kym's problems.  The speeches at the rehearsal dinner, Sidney's song at the wedding itself . . . . God Almighty!!  If we don't feel contempt for these narcissists (and, from the reviews, it's clear that a lot of people do) it's because all of them so obviously like one another and want to do the right thing by one another.  They haven't lost a basic decent-ness, despite their self-indulgence.  I'm sure that Jonathan Demme is very aware of all this, clearly liking these people but not afraid to to show us the sentimentality and self-indulgence that their wealth enables them to get away with.  So clear-sighted is his vision that (again like Mike Leigh) he is willing to take the risk of boring us by presenting people who, frankly, aren't all that interesting in themselves and who in the movie reveal an ordinariness that their wealth and ostentation can't hide.  To my mind, the satire works, and the movie isn't so long that it becomes unbearable.

The only thing that I thought implausible in the movie was a plot device -- having a worker in a beauty salon recognize Kym and reveal something that she had told an earlier rehab group that was in effect a fiction about her sister -- and now Rachel, also in salon, hears him tell it.  This has repercussions, and one feels here for Kym, for the worker, obviously an ex-addict, should know that he is violating confidentiality and that Kym's fiction (or ""lie,"" if you feel censorious) belonged to a therapeutic situation in which it was possible that it ""made sense"" or was even helpful in Kym's recovery, but which was obviously never meant to leak into ""real life.""  One effect of the revelation is to lead Kym into a confrontation with her mother (Debra Winger) that is the emotional climax of the movie -- where Kym asks her mother a question that she has every right to ask but can't ask without causing pain.  Hathaway and Winger are great in this scene, which stops on just the right side of melodrama.  Kym and mother are both closer and more apart after this scene -- and the movie as a whole has a great sense of lives pulling apart even on occasions when ""togetherness"" is being -- not totally ironically -- celebrated.  Kym and Rachel hug at the end, and the hug both is meaningful and settles nothing.  What I'm trying to suggest is that there's a lot going on in this movie.  It's very much worth seeing.",1431302400,,4518,4.776349614395887

Before that, I did skip ahead a few times only to realize that the shaky-cam footage was a curse that afflicted this movie in its entirety as opposed to only being selectively used for some specific purpose during certain scenes. I realize there's no need to hire a focus puller when there's no concern over staying in focus since this is something that is impossible to achieve when using a dancing camera lens in an attempt to capture photographed frames of light bouncing off moving or stationary objects. And no dollies would have been needed either so that would also reduce the movie's budget. But there is a plethora of good reasons why focus pullers and dollies (and similar rigs) are used by most competent movie directors whether they are rich and famous or just starting out as raw rookies exploring the world of low-budget independent cinema. It's difficult for me to fathom that the same guy who directed this movie directed ""Silence of the Lambs""! I'm certain that there are critics out there who actually did like this movie and might attempt to justify the use of the shaky-cam as being some kind of intentionally applied artistic choice that visually enhances some underlying emotional aspect of the leading lady or one of her dramatic counterparts. But by way of analogy, if someone splattered dog feces on a blank canvas and called it ""art"", I don't care if every single living person on this planet as well as any other planet hailed it as a stroke of artistic genius unparalleled in every intricate aspect of its supposedly creative attributes. To me, it is and would always be nothing more than dog sh_t going through various decompositional stages after being framed in white.",1425081600,2,1990,4.855882352941176

It is Rachael's sister, played by Anne Hathaway, whose story is being told.  Hathaway  shows us right away that her character isn't easy to like and I'm sure that people with addicts in their families flinched from deja-vu or something like that.  However, she shows that, in her own, twisted way, she is trying and perhaps is to be comended for that.

PLEASE save the 113 minutes of your valuable time. It's a chick squabble flik. Sister's fight, friends fight; all for attention at who's more popular and by trying to get the cherished ""Maid of Honor"" role. Ann's character, played very well by her, is getting a temporary release from her rehab stint. She's selfish, spoiled and demands any attention she can get through negative behavior and turning the focus on her rather than supporting her sister. After a few minutes, the unbelievable emotions and spats simply get old. You keep waiting for some redeeming quality or perhaps a situation to arise which may waken her, but it doesn't really happen. Even the horrible noise they call music is so distracting. The photography is annoyingly shaky; I guess they are trying to be ""artsy"" and cool. I wanted to try and give it a chance, but just I couldn't. Debra Winger does a good job playing her preoccupied, aloof mother. Everyone has a messed up personality. With each new character I hoped the story would come together. It seems as the director just enjoyed letting characters go wild with their melodrama instead of focus on a story that could have shown some redemption and made it worth watching.

3547316,4,B001E95ZNS,"Anne Hathaway displays some magical acting chops to make the woman she portrays someone who you hate at first but develop compassion for as the movie continues.  She is beautiful to watch on screen.  Her tragic character, Kim, on furlough from rehab for her sister's wedding, could easily be someone you know in real life: a stunning beauty wrapped up in a mostly self-inflicted horrific drama. Anne's performance is strong and believable.  She commands the big screen in every scene she is in. You forget you're watching Anne Hathaway the actress and become engrossed in the character of Kim.

There were elements I liked and disliked in the movie. It feels like you're at the wedding of someone you don't know well but were obligated to attend, and it drags on.  I did not think Rachel and the man she married made a convincing couple; there was no chemistry to that union at all.  It's not because he's black, it just wasn't the right choice of an actor. They come across as rather bland, especially compared to Kim's intensity. Then there is a scene toward the end of the reception when the mother must leave, and both daughters are upset about it. I really didn't get that part, because the mother had attended the rehearsal dinner, wedding and reception; what more did they want?

However, a powerful scene in the movie occurs when Kim privately confronts her mother about family issues. It's actually a breakthrough for Kim, to speak up and demand answers.  She's noticed through the wedding preparations that her sister Rachel is moving forward with her life, while Kim's been away at rehab.  She's trying to figure out how to move on with her own life.

Another subtle reference that Kim is changing is that she updates her look while at the hair salon. It's a known fact that women often change their outer appearance to reflect inner change.

I also liked that Kim wasn't 'saved' by a man whisking all her troubles away.  She has a dalliance with the best man at the wedding but he doesn't swoop in and fix everything.

The main core of the film, with all its side stories, is the poignant, realistic relationship of the two sisters, there for each other through thick and thin. It shows how a family can still keep the ties that bind through all that life throws at them.",1370390400,,2283,4.649253731343284

But it was not like a movie.  It was really like sneaking a peek into these people's lives as they prepared for their older daughter's wedding.  All the while this family has been destroyed by the tragic loss of a young boy because of their wayward problem child daughter's addiction.  Imagine carrying that anvil on your back for the rest of your life.

Rachel has a big enough heart to love her sister anyway and move forward with her wedding.  No shocking or surprise ending here.  It ended like a wedding would in real life.  And that's the best description of this movie.  Real life.",1369785600,,801,4.510489510489511

3547331,3,B001E95ZNS,"Who says a wedding movie has to be romantic, or funny, or heart warming?  Do all good movies with Christmas have to be joyous?  Sometimes it's the big events that set off the personal landslides that destroy families.  Life Happens.

This is a nice big well off, liberal family and one of the two daughters is getting married.  The other is on a break from rehab, and apparently the brother was killed in a car accident when the latter drove the car into a lake.  It's not a happy family, there are issues.  But they try, it's the best that can be expected from any of us.

Being a nice liberal family, in Connecticut, this is a rainbow event, where every community has an ambassador, although I didn't see anyone distinctly Muslim or gay, but I wasn't really looking...  Oddly enough, the script writers seem to have forgotten to provide lines for most of the black people marrying into the family.  Minor oversight, no?  It's mostly white people playing games and laughing and arguing, and every now and then a black person says something you might or might not be able to hear over the noise of whatever's going on.  The wedding itself is dressed in curry, although there don't seem to be any Indians (Eastern or Indigineous American) either.  It's a very American idea of diversity, where everything comes down to clothes and food and music, and the people, well, you know, we coudn't invite everybody, there was only so much food...

One reviewer, an apparent addict in recovery, says this is a movie from a recovering addicts point of view, and that may well be the case.  I agree with others that the hand held camera gets tired.  I didn't think that ""A Christmas Tale"" was THAT good, but this is yet another movie that makes the French view of dysfunctional families so much more entertaining.  Watching a group of white actors act out a film studded handsomely with non-white actors, while the non-white folks have almost no script time, became so distracting that I began to tire of what became a self righteous dirge of a film.

People are not wall paper and ornaments.  If you're going to make a film with non-white actors, use them.  If you're not going to use them, then at least be honest and make an all white movie.  Making some big serious hoot and holler film with  a UN cast, but with only the white people talking is far more than silly in this day and age.

I don't think this is peculiar to me. There are many people who fall into this family event abyss and that director jonathan demme has captured every nuance of these happenings.

The first thing that struck me is that all the old reasons for attacking one another at the wedding were no longer present.  That is that a white upper middle class Jewish PHD woman was marrying a black serviceman musician caused no angst at all in either family.  Everyone was very happy about these two getting married.  It has taken a very long time to get to this point of tolerance. At just about every point in the past there would have been warring between the two sides over religion, race, ethnicity and class level.  These people are fine with all of that and this could only happen in this century, The wedding itself becomes a musical festival of multiculturalism. When the people are letting themselves go to all of this music, there is no discord among them. i began to wonder if that is why weddings used to be very musical events, that is that everyone could disgorge energy without turning on one another.  Indeed, it is when these people talk that trouble begins.

coming as no surprise it is the upper middle class Jewish family which has all of the angst. this at first seems to be because the daughter kym, anne hathaway, is a recovering addict.  she is not very far along in her recovery either as she is released from rehab for the wedding weekend and then will go straight back into it. she is not a likable young woman.  she seems very self aborbed and has one flink after another over issues like being maid of honor.

but there is more to kym's being the way she is than appears on the surface.  enter her mother, played by debra winger (who can do no wrong on the screen), and the lesions within this family become a lot more apparent and serious.  there is a terrific scene between winger and hathaway that is absolutely brilliant.

is the movie a bit slow?  yes.  think ingmar berman like pace.  and, like bergman, demme is showing us nuance after nuance with these characters,  This is slow work and not for the faint of heart. there is not a moment of escapism in this film. if you are looking for light entertainment, this is not it. does it spend too much time on wedding rehearsal dinner speeches and musical performances?  again yes but also again we have almost a foreign film exploration of this wedding which typically means long exposition to enhance the real world feel.  i think the pace was deliberately slow to make us feel we were really at a wedding as a family member attending the whole weekend.  if you feel like you'd like to leave early, demme probably counts that as success on his part.  you feel exactly as if you are there which is what he wants.

demme has had brilliant success after success in the film industry,  he has never been one to sit on his laurels or do the same thing over and over.  he is an artist and in this later stage of his career he is going for something quite different than his SILENCE OF THE LAMB days or even his STOP MAKING SENSE, SOMETHING WILD or SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA days.

3547349,4,B001E95ZNS,"I didn't have many expectations going into this film..and coming from a dysfunctional family, I get the bickering between siblings.. Anne Hathaway (who I didn't really think was a great actress prior to this film) did a superior job with the character of Kym. She turns a self absorbed and unlikable character into someone who doesn't come across as overbearing or totally self centered.. She's just trying to move on from a tragic family accident and bad habits to find her place back in her family's circle despite the initial dismay of her sister, Rachael (Rosemarie Dewitt), who spends much of the time bickering about the past and arrogantly pointing out time and time again that it's all about HER and HER day and HER baby and HER life.. Which is why I found it easier to sympathize with Kym.

This film is not for everyone and it's definitely NOT a comedy, so those expecting something like ""Married to the Mob"" or ""Something Wild"" (two of Demme's Previous comedies) will be very disappointed. It's also not a movie most teens can relate to either.. But I get it and I thought it was a good film. The story was a bit loose around the edges, and I thought the film could have shortened the actual wedding stuff - that became a bit boring and dragged on..like a wedding reception in real life..

Ms. Hathaway portrais Kym, a recovering addict home on leave from rehab for her sister's wedding. She acts spoiled and insufferable, but you can feel her pain underneath all of that. You love her and want to smack her all at the same time. The rest of the characters are equally spoilt, whiny and pretensious, except for the dad, and I could not feel any affinity with any of them. The scene with the mom (Debra Winger) should have been more fleshed out, as it was pivotal to the great tragedy in this family's past. It shows that the mom was at least equally as culpaple as Kym, but seems to have moved on. And instead of talking to her daughter, and comforting her, she slaps her in the face. In my thoughts, the mother was really the worst offender, but Kym was the sufferer.

With her hair clumsily chopped off, her huge eyes standing out in her emaciated face, and her ungainly figure, Hathaway is a pathetic creature who not only feels unloved but is incapable of loving herself. She drops a bombshell well into the movie that explains, in part, why she is finding it so difficult to look in the mirror and like what she sees. Kym is about to attend the wedding of her sister, Rachel, who is marrying Sidney, played with sweet forbearance by Tunde Adebimpe. Poor Sidney and his family get a front row seat at the wedding rehearsal dinner when Rachel stands up and makes several embarrassing pronouncements.

While Kym's father, Paul, smothers his wayward daughter with kindness, plates of food, and cloying attentiveness, Rachel seethes with resentment. She cannot stand Kym's self-centeredness and upsetting outbursts. Although, at heart, Rachel loves Kym, there is clearly a great deal of unfinished business between the two siblings.

Unfortunately, Jonathan Demme directs Jenny Lumet's flimsy screenplay with a heavy hand. Awkward camera angles, unnecessary and overly long close-ups, and annoying transitions between scenes call too much attention to the director's efforts. This is a somewhat slow-moving character study during which family members blurt out their often profanity-laced feelings towards one another. The following themes have been presented in other films far more effectively: The family is the ultimate battleground; you must love yourself before you can love anyone else; to err is human--to forgive, very difficult.

It's good to see Bill Irwin and Debra Winger, both of whom turn in fine performances. However, the best reason for paying to see ""Rachel Getting Married"" is to observe Anne Hathaway's painful transformation from an unwanted outcast to a wounded survivor who is willing to try again, even though she has fallen on her face so many times.",1346198400,,2059,5.2522796352583585

Far from entertainment I may share with you but a genius piece of work  and performances.
Initially for Ann Hathaway performance, I would say little, because I cannot say enough ,amazing ,total acting ,wonderful, Devine ,she absolutely deserve the Oscar for this and more.
I salute to Ann ....,but Rosemarie is entangled in this masterpiece and does perform ultimately and beautiful, she is also one of the most beautiful faces on earth.
As for the film it resembles a lot of fathers and mothers experience with children going for drugs and encounter a terrible nightmare in their life , how they coop engage and disengage with the reality and day to day .
The film is excellent articulating and portraying the subject , the surrounding is terrific, part of a sister wedding.
I liked the father, I found we behaving and worrying thinking the same, I bet a lot of you out there share the same feelings.

I was feeling kind of lonely because, after getting a frontal lobotomy, it's difficult to find other people to relate to. But I could relate to every character in this film! They seemed so real to me. Like the people you see on reality TV. They were just like that. Like that Kim Kardashian. But with flaws. This entire movie was like an endless reality TV show. So real. And just as entertaining.

The acting was also incredible. Everyone was very believable. They reminded me of a senator or a president. So life-like and caring. With real emotions. This movie made me so happy, I felt like crying. I realized that having a frontal lobotomy does not mean you are alone. There are lots of people just like you in the world. In movies like this. And on reality TV. And in government. And business.

Oh, the only actor I didn't like was Debra Winger. She was not believable because she is too good of an actress. I love her deep voice and she was so good and I've missed her not making movies these past years, so I hope I never see her again in another movie like this because she ruined it and she should only make bad movies and not good movies like this.

Yeah.

So anyway, after watching this movie, I was feeling lots better. But then I kind of realized that, gee, it's only a movie. Real people like that only exist in movies and on reality TV and not in real life.

Hey, it's fiction. To me, this plays more like a somewhat tongue-in-cheek high comedy, especially the belleaguered ex-hippy dad who tries to make everyone happy all the time. The drug recovery material involving Kim, the younger daughter, is powerfully realistic, especially the Narcotics Anonymous meeting, and the love-hate dynamic that drug addicts create for those around them. So the movie veers from light to dark and back again. The sound track is fascinating. Watch the feature extra for details. It adds enormously to the atmosphere. The hand-held camera makes it seem almost like a home movie, especially when it gets right in peoples' faces.

3547395,4,B001E95ZNS,"This movie is about a dysfunctional family and a not so much the wedding. The sister of the bride, Kym, is a recovering addict. She is also personality disordered, either histrionic (loves drama) or narcissistic. Anne Hathaway does an excellent job portraying a personality disordered individual. The entire point of the movie is showing how this type of dysfunction occurs and how 'relatively' sane people try to cope with it. Rachel, Kim's sister, is the 'relatively' sane member of the family.

She is the only one in the family that has emerged from a family tragedy with her bearings still intact. Rachel's frustration of her sister's antics and her need to be the center of attention is also done in an excellent manner.

The other aspect of this movie shows how outsiders generally don't acknowledge the dysfunction. This dysfunction exists in our society and most people color it with self-generated illusions. This is exactly what the movie portrays, and it does a real good job of it. Most people watching this may not recognize what's going on in this movie. The same happens in society at all levels.

This movie may have been a little long, not filmed with the correct technique, or a tad extravagant with regard to some of the scenes, but it was real. This reality may have hit home with many viewers (and reviewers here), and some reviewers may not understand. To watch this type of movie can be difficult as it is a truer reflection of life than the 'pollyanna' type movies we are accustomed to watching.",1311465600,,1520,4.793893129770993
3547396,4,B001E95ZNS,"I came on here to write about my criticisms, but I'm surprised by all the negative reviews-- this isn't a bad movie at all.  In fact, in its style and pacing it's more realistic than 99% of the movies out there.  People stutter, interrupt, make improbable leaps of logic, and bare some real, complex, ambivalent emotion.  They're not being ""characters"", they're being people.  Just the dialogue and the family dynamics make it unique in terms of expression.  Like Catcher in the Rye, the enjoyment in the film comes when you realize that not everything has a point; it hasn't been edited to just satisfy reader (watcher) appetites, this is how life unfolds, boredom, grief, ennui and all.

My favorite part was the end-- especially the part playing over the credits.  That's how life really is.  You get past this climactic part that's supposed to be some sort of revelation, or the happiest moment in your life, or whatever (here, the wedding), and the next morning there are people packing up tents and your sister goes back to rehab and life is still pretty much the way you left it.  Apologies don't always get made--or accepted.  Efforts at reconciliation sometimes go haywire.  People don't always change.  There's not always an answer.

In a strange kind of way, it reminded me of another movie I liked quite a bit: ""Waltz with Bashir"".  One's a movie about getting married and one's about going to war in Lebanon, but in both the main character is going through a kind of surreal journey of remembrance.  They are movies about conscience.  Did I really do those things?  Was that me?  And if so, am I the one responsible for what happened-- or was there someone else who put me in that place?  Can I ever really recover?  Or is this it-- is this as good as life is ever going to be?

(I do have my criticisms.  It's a long movie (1:52), or at least it seems like a long movie.  If you wanted to, you could cut about 22 minutes out and make the same story, although maybe part of the experience is the pain of watching long vignettes and speech after speech at the wedding.  I felt myself getting bored waiting for something to happen or dialogue to end.  But hey, in the end it's a good effort and it's something new.)",1302912000,,2226,4.532663316582915

That is something I welcome, even encourage. However, what you need to understand as a filmmaker is that if you choose to go down that path, then you need someting else to keep the viewer interested. Primarily, you need characters that you actually give a dang about. I, for one, realized fairly early in the film that I really couldn't care less about what happens to these neurotic, whiny, self-important privileged white people (and by white I also include the characters whose skin happened to be black, but for all they added to the cultural depth of the film they could just as well have been white, if you catch my drift). I figured however that, although the characters were uninteresting, I might at least be entertained by how the plot unfolds. And when that wound up not happening, I just felt hugely disappointed. Granted, there were some entertaining scenes with amusing dialogue, as well as plenty of scenes of tremendous visual beauty (I am mainly referring to the wedding footage). There was also plenty of great music, although they should have put a lot more of Robyn Hitchcock in there in my opinion. Those good things aren't, however, quite enough to make it a good movie.

It's annoying - not entertaining.

As for the wedding, it has a constant aura of putting on airs.  Look how untraditional, creative and supportive we are.  Could we have at least one character acknowledge how different this wedding is, rather than everyone acting like it's the most normal thing in the world?  The film doesn't have to apologize for it, but it shouldn't pretend either.  In trying too hard not to appear self-consciously eccentric, it comes off as false.

In fact this film is more about Kym than Rachel, despite the title. I have rarely seen Anne Hathaway act better than this and she plays the narcissistic, damaged and fragile Kym perfectly. There is a real bohemian, slightly hippy feel about the film, with the jazz music, freeform wedding vows and hand held camera style of direction. This feels like a home movie in places and is all the better for it. Some scenes (like parts of the rehearsal dinner and the dancing scene at the wedding) feel like they were partially improvised and the chemistry is potent whether they were scripted or not. In the trailer this was kind of portrayed as a kooky comedy, and whilst there are some funny moments, it is a lot darker than I was expecting and had some real emotional scenes. There is tragedy here mixed in with the joy of the wedding. This was a surprising film and one that slipped under the radar when first at the cinema and whilst it may not be a barrel of laughs, it is excellently acted, written and directed and makes for just under 2 hours enjoyable viewing.

Kym (Anne Hathaway) is released from rehab for more than a few days so she can go home to attend the wedding of her sister Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt). At home, the atmosphere is strained between Kym and her family members, as they struggle to reconcile themselves with her past and her present. Kym's father shows intense concern for her well-being and whereabouts, which Kym interprets as mistrust. She also resents her sister's choice of her best friend Emma (Anisa George), rather than Kym, to be her maid of honor. Rachel, for her part, resents the attention her sister's addiction is drawing away from her wedding, a resentment that comes to a head at the rehearsal dinner, where Kym, amid toasts from friends and family, takes the microphone to offer an apology for her past actions, as part of her twelve-step program.

Underlying the family's dynamic is a tragedy that occurred many years previously, which Kym retells at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. As a teenager, Kym was responsible for the death of her young brother Ethan, who was left in her care one day despite her being high at the time. Driving home from a nearby park, Kym had lost control of the car, driving over a bridge and into a lake, where her brother drowned.

The day before the wedding, as Rachel, Kym, and the other bridesmaids are getting their hair done, Kym is approached by a man who she knew in an earlier stint in rehab. He thanks her for the strength she gave him through a story about her childhood sexual abuse at the hands of an uncle and caring for her sister, who was anorexic. Rachel, hearing this, storms out. The story, it turns out, was all a lie -- an apparent attempt by Kym to evade responsibility for her addiction. The sisters' fight comes to a head later that night, leading Kym to escape to her mother's house. However, she finds no respite there, as a fight with her mother comes to blows. She runs off again, this time intentionally crashing a car into a giant rock, and spends the night in the car.

The next morning, the day of the wedding, Kym is awoken by police. After passing a sobriety test, she gets a ride home. She makes her way to Rachel's room, as Rachel prepares for the wedding. Seeing Kym's bruised face, the anger of the previous night vanishes, and Rachel tenderly bathes and dresses Kym.

Amid a festive Indian theme, Rachel and her fianc are wed. Kym is the maid of honor, and is overcome with emotion as the couple exchange their vows. Kym tries to enjoy herself throughout the wedding reception but continues to feel out of place and is nagged by the unresolved dispute with her mother. Ultimately, her mother leaves the party early, despite Rachel's effort to bring the two together, and the gulf between Kym and her mother is left unreconciled.

The next morning, Kym must return to rehab. As she is leaving, Rachel runs out of the house to hug her, their sisterly love remaining strong despite all that has passed between them",1280016000,2,2962,4.6216730038022815

3547421,5,B001E95ZNS,"Considering the negative comments posted on Amazon, I am surprised that Rachel getting married got such a rough reception and managed to upset so many viewers. As extremely violent movies can shock thousands of people, those reviews seems to be another example that stories that present reality in a strong and honest way, such as Madame Bovary, always tend to create virulent reactions.

I mention realism for instead of following usual narratives rules, which are to make movies with likable characters, Jenny Lumet wrote a screenplay where her characters show both their strengths and their flaws. Especially those of Kym, who leaves her rehab center for three days to celebrate the wedding of her sister Rachel. And as the movie goes, thanks to Anne Hathaway's perfect acting and also the hand-held camerawork used by Jonathan Demme which show the story in a raw but honest presentation, we get to see and feel Kym's anger as she tries to get rid of her own demons, her drug addictions, but also tries to defend herself against a family and former friends whom she believes still hate her for all the trouble she did to them. Though some viewers may not be pleased to see such a direct presentation of someone's life.

Also, in her storytelling, Jenny Lumet might upset certain viewers for she doesn't try to explain all of her characters' actions. True we get to learn glimpses about Kym's past, such as her fashion career and an incident that occurred between her and her brother Ethan, but Jenny Lumet doesn't try to give all the answers. As Jonathan Demme says in the commentaries, he wants the viewer to answer by himself all the questions that are left unresolved. This might unsettle several viewers, but believe me, it makes you more active while watching a movie and it generates discussion with your fellow viewers.

Earlier ago, I mentioned Madame Bovary because it is a book that got some virulent reactions for the public, including a indecency trial, because of certain things such as its realistic tone. As in Rachel getting married, there is a wedding in Madame Bovary. And as in this movie, we also get to see everything that occurs before that wedding, the villagers who prepare themselves in the morning, the walk toward the church, and the feast that occurs until the end of the night. And this way, just like Flaubert, Jonathan Demme wants us to witness all the little incidents that occur during the ceremony not just to fill up time, but to better immerse us in his story. To see Kym and her family as real people instead of characters. But instead of presenting to us their lives, we only get to witness in this movie a slice of their life, of Kym's life, and with no definite resolution at the end.

To conclude, it is a movie that is not easy to access because of its intention to represent a true reality. But offers another way of moviemaking, different from the Hollywood mainstream cinema.",1274659200,3,2923,4.748031496062992

Hathaway plays Kym, a drug-addicted model who returns home from a 9-month stay in rehab to attend her sister's wedding.

3547424,2,B001E95ZNS,"There's a reason that reality TV tarts up the truth with contrived situations and melodramatic conflict and sentimental mush: life tends to be tedious. Alas, there's way too much ""real life"" in this film. The pacing is slack, the dialog is only occasionally interesting, the neurotic characters are little more than stereotypes, and the transparently manipulative plot goes nowhere. The herky-jerky camerawork is irritating at best and brings to mind a poorly-made home movie.

It feels like the director, Jonathan Demme, was either asleep at the switch or just too lazy to use more than an outline for the movie. The script, such as it is, was written by Jenny Lumet, a one-time actress who got a shot at success only because of her father, the great director Sidney Lumet. The last of her very minor screen roles was filmed in 1995. Not surprisingly, ""Rachel Getting Married"" is her sole writing credit.

But Demme does little with this material; he seems to be letting the actors improvise (badly) rather than directing them. The distant mother, the enabling father, the resentful sister are not simply underwritten. They are completely unlikeable, even more so than the dimwits in a bad season of ""The Real World."" (Were there any good seasons?) The remaining roles, particularly that of the sister's fiance, are but ciphers. And for all the ""reality"" supposedly present in this slice of life, the emotions on display almost never ring true.

I have to hand it to Anne Hathaway, though. She hath a way with the role of an absolutely loathsome woman, a recovering drug addict bent on drawing all attention to herself and thereby ruining her sister's wedding. The Oscar-nominated actress commits completely to her character's appalling narcissism and vicious envy and hysterical pettiness and rampant paranoia, which is why I'm awarding an overly-generous two-star rating. As for the rest of the film, ugh. It's no more diverting than watching people load a dishwasher, which is what the characters actually do for several long minutes.

Jonathan Demme has made some great movies, but this isn't one of them -- nor is it even mediocre. It's a pretentious, indulgent indie project that combines a a pathetically dysfunctional family with aggravatingly self-congratulatory multiculturalism (the wedding, for no particular reason, has an Indian theme and costumes, and then a Brazilian band and dance troupe show up out of the blue). I found myself looking at my watch and then nodding off during the interminably self-important toasts, only to be jerked awake by a scene depicting a cliched argument that involved a lot of self-absorbed screaming. Not even the revelation of a family tragedy generated any sympathy in me; I was too angry about having two hours of my time wasted.

As someone who dealt with a cousin's addictions for many years, and finally with her suicide, I cannot describe ""Rachel Getting Married"" as either realistic or therapeutic. It made me cringe and left a foul taste in my mouth. Bottom line: it's ugly and depressing -- when it's not simply boring. Please don't bother with it. Oh, and if you want to watch a similarly-themed drama that's genuinely good, check out a 2004 production from Denmark entitled ""Festen"" (in English, ""The Celebration"").",1269820800,8,3274,5.066790352504638

But all these one-star reviews?  That seems to be excessively harsh judgment.  Self-absorption is entirely the point in the case of Anne Hathaway's Kym.  Interminable and excruciating rehearsal dinners?  That's called real life.

3547426,3,B001E95ZNS,"Rachel Getting Married certainly isn't the best film I've ever seen; but it's not the worst film I've sat through, either. It's a rather average effort by the filmmakers to portray a highly dysfunctional family, including a young woman who is rather unstable, all coming together for a wedding at the family home in Connecticut. Weddings can cause enough stress with former spouses showing up, rehearsals, strangers from different backgrounds and persuasions coming together and more, but this family's pressure is especially up with the return home of the person who is essentially the black sheep of the family, Kym, Rachel's sister who has spent a great many years in and out of rehab for substance abuse.

Don't get me wrong, though. The casting is excellent and Anne Hathaway acts very convincingly as Kym, the not too happy sibling who is self-absorbed and also, at times, a gross pain in the you-know-what. Bill Irwin is just great as the father of the family and Rosemarie DeWitt does a splendid job as Rachel. Look also for a strong performance by Tunde Adebimpe as Sidney, Rachel's fianc, too. The choreography was very well done but I didn't like the way they used a hand-held camera; this usually works wonders for a film but this time it made it look a bit too unprofessional--they wanted to give this a ""home-made"" movie feel but I think they went a bit overboard on that.

When the action begins, Kym returns home just a day or two before her sister Rachel is marrying Sidney. Kym and Rachel must deal with each other; at first there are some tender moments but the tension gets thick very quickly when Kym discovers she's not the maid of honor. This leads Rachel to ask Emma (Anisa George) to please ""step down"" as maid of honor so that Kym can take her place. Ouch! In addition, long standing family secrets gradually come into play and there is a heavy emphasis on a family tragedy from several years prior.

Of course, from here the plot can continue anywhere. Look for tough to watch but memorable scenes including the one in which Kym confronts her mother about the past; and Anna Deavere Smith does a great job as Carol, the second wife of Kym and Rachel's father. I also liked Carol Jean Lewis as Sidney's mother.

The DVD comes with extras including deleted scenes and a couple of optional running commentaries.

Overall, Rachel Getting Married is best for people into drama, family drama, romance and the fans of the actors in this film. Unfortunately, however, there are individual scenes that excel while other scenes don't quite meet my expectations with overacting or that distracting emphasis on music that I'm not sure actually needed to be brought into the story.

My husband and I had a bad feeling after watching all the trailers attached prior to the movie but were hoping for the best.

Anne Hathaway is the ONLY known actress / actor in the entire movie (that I recognized at least) & I'm not sure why she took the part.

I just finished posting a warning to my Facebook friends as well. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS unless you enjoy slowly torturing yourself with no redemption in the end.",1265414400,5,586,4.168141592920354
3547430,2,B001E95ZNS,"OK, the performances were very good, but what were they thinking with the never-ending rehearsal dinner?  Please.  Like a bad home movie.  Boring, stupid, a total waste of time.  Most scenes were too long or too choppy.

Thus the 2 star rating.

If you've lived with an addict, you do get the family's turmoil and that's what makes it SOMEWHAT worth watching.  It's painful but they definitely conveyed the frustration of people putting their lives on hold, to a great extent, because of an addict's behavior (or expected, anticipated behavior) in and on their lives.

The Indian style wedding was never explained and it should have been. Bad writing, bad directing.  Boo!

I thought Anne Hathaway's performance was actually really good.  Her total self-absorption and selfishness was perfectly portrayed. The best scene was when everyone was going on about Kym's this and that and her sister announces she's pregnant.  In perfect selfish mode, Anne's character tells her, ""You can't do that!"", implying ""It's all about me and how dare you switch the focus!""  Very well done, very real.  The emotion I felt (as a viewer who's lived with addiction) was exactly right.

One part that evoked a strong feeling in me (the only thing really) was Kyn's pouty, guilt-inducing insistence that she HAD to be the Maid-of-Honor.  Like any well-performed drama, it made me want to reach through the (small) screen and slap her silly.  ""Heck, no way!  It's called Consequences, girl!""

The other thing I liked was that some of the people in this story were getting on with their lives. ""Yeah, it's a real shame you haven't gotten your act together, Kym, but we need to move forward.""  That was very real.

I totally get that addicton/alcoholism is a Disease but after that many times in Rehab, Kym, it's also a choice.  That never came up and it should have.  Some of the characters probably went to Al Anon or Narc-Anon; you could tell they paid attention or got help.  That was subtle and if you've gone through a 12 Step program, you got that.

In conclusion, I'd say don't waste your time unless you're into being depressed/frustrated.  Mostly because of never-ending scenes and generally poor direction.  I wouldn't have wanted to be the Editor, that's for sure!",1263859200,6,2253,4.860526315789474

3547432,5,B001E95ZNS,"""Rachel Getting Married"" takes patience.  A lot of patience.  It's slow, even by the standards of the genre; it's a character study filled with long takes and non-name actors (I'm even willing to bet some of these people weren't ""actors"" in the professional sense).  The story revolves around two sisters: Kim (Anne Hathaway), who has been let out of rehab to attend the wedding of her sister Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt).  Their family is anything but functional, however, and the film follows two or three days in the lives of these people who are eerily reminiscent of the individuals we see around us everyday.

This film is something of a departure for Johnathan Demme, best known, of course, for ""Silence of the Lambs.""  But, working from a stellar script by Jenny Lumet, he has crafted an intricate drama about dysfunction, love, and redemption.  The camerawork will, of course, cause some consternation among weak-stomached viewers; I don't see what all the fuss is, but I suppose, if you're not into that kind of thing (suck it up!), then you might want to avoid this particular film.  That aside, the camerawork adds that extra level of reality here that truly enhances the story, not that any enhancement was needed.

Director Jonathan Demme captures perfectly the claustrophobic atmosphere that reigns in dysfunctional families. It's no wonder many of the reviewers here found the film hard to watch. It's hard to be around the dishonesty that lurks beneath the self-consciously elitist, multicultural members of this extended clan. Bill Irwin is excellent as the ineffectual dad who is the family enabler. Anna Deavere Smith is sadly underutilized as his well-meaning but bewildered second wife. And Debra Winger aces the role of the teflon mom whose inadequate parenting ends up demonizing Kym. As an earlier reviewer here pointed out, this film is also about wealth and privilege. The film presents the family's wealth as some kind of a norm; maybe for Demme and screenwriter Jenny Lumet, this IS their world, but it certainly doesn't represent the way most Americans live. The movie goes on too long and I fast forwarded over the interminable wedding reception. During the closing credits, we see the now-married sister Rachel, happily alone after Kym goes back to rehab. Could it be that now that the disruptive Kym is gone, she and her dad can go back to their blissful state of denial? Kym's left carrying all the family's problems.",1261267200,,1369,5.061946902654867

I would hope that a review of a movie would be about reviewing the movie as a movie. That said, my two or ten cents worth follow.

1) Everyone who hated the hand-held camera work is correct. For this movie it was just an excuse to be lazy in never actually composing a shot. It doesn't help and it doesn't represent anyone's internal reality - good dialog would have done that or a better script.
2) Everyone who thought the ""multi-culturalism"" was bizarre, overblown and useless to the movie in terms of driving the story or providing context is correct. It was at the best silly and at the worst irrelevant which, for a movie, is deadly - there's only so much time and attention and wasting it is a very bad idea.
3) The idea that Kym wouldn't push past her father to confront her mother is not supportable - this is a woman who will confront her with the awful truth and slap her but won't force a conversation? C'mon now. Inconsistency in characters with no reason is not supportable either.
4) Everyone who thought there was insufficient development of any single part of the backstory is correct - the music mania is just one such element.
5) Everyone who thought the screenwriter can't write is also correct - just one of too many unresolved scenes should suffice. The one in which Rachel declares, ""I'm pregnant"", just tails off into nothing - the only good part about it from a movie/movie point of view is that it's consistent with everything else about this mess. EVERYTHING just tails off into nothing.
6) Everyone who thought the more than capable actors were wasted in this movie was correct.

3547438,1,B001E95ZNS,"Rachel Getting Married is easily one of the worst films made in a long time, and by the talented director Jonathan Demme, no less.  I saw this film based on esteemed critic Roger Ebert's four-star (out of four stars) review, and all I can think is that we didn't see the same movie.

The basic premise is simple.  Kym, a recovering addict in a treatment center is given a two-day pass to attend her sister Rachel's wedding. We follow Kym around with a shaky hand-held camera point of view, while the actors apparently improvise various wedding rehearsal scenes.  The look and feel of the film is amateurish.

There are so many problems with this film, but the biggest problem is that the main character, Kym, is insufferable and completely self-centered.  By the end of the film, I didn't care if she recovered, relapsed, or overdosed, I just wanted her to stop talking. The incredibly unlikeable character of Kym poisoned the entire film, making it nearly unwatchable.  After the first twenty minutes, I started skipping ahead about five minutes at a time, would watch 30 seconds, then skip ahead another five minutes.  I made it through the entire mess in about 40 minutes, which is about 35 minutes longer than I should have given the film.

But apart from the much of the acting and of the directing it is not.  During the entire film I kept thinking that if the Anne Hathaway character (Kym) would shut up, or if someone caring friend or family member would tell her to shut up, or at least to think before she speaks, then everyone - herself included - would be much happier. But since nothing else in the movie creates any drama other than Kym's big mouth, there would not be a story, I suppose. Because Kym is not compelling, I had difficulty feeling empathy either for her or for her angry sister Rachel, her spineless father, or her remote mother. And at the risk of being politically incorrect, what is the point of the heavy-handed multiculturalism?  Alright, its an interracial wedding.

All throughout the movie, I wanted to know what these people did for a living, but alas that wasn't really important, and anybody that critiques this film knows that to ask that question is a unpardonable sin in this world of deluded upper class entitlements.

I, for one, did not believe that Mr. Demme was trying to evoke sympathy for this family, but rather just to present a realistic portrayal of the decaying upper crust of American society.  Essentially F. Scott Fitzgerald for the 21st century with all the hubris and pathos of the Gatsbys.  There are families, like these, in America that somehow continue to exist despite providing no tangible benefit to the community.  For a nation that at one time prided itself on rugged individualism and the Protestant work ethic, this is a troubling trend indeed.  Of course, almost every character in this movie had somebody else to blame for their neuroses.  However, after seeing this family operate for the span of 48 hours, you could see how these characters evolved.  This family, at one time, could have been stable, but as this film documents, their best days are well behind them.

I'm all for multiculturalism, but not shallow contrived multiculturalism as presented in this film.  The need for every ethnicity and every type of music to be represented undercut the reality of Mr. Demme's vision.  Unfortunately, the characters in this movie are where the best and brightest in America currently find themselves: wallowing in self pity and expecting great things to come to them as a result of their self loathing.  But, on the the other hand, families are always rising in falling in America, as Hawthorne said, and this is a clear example of a family about to fall from their undeserved position of grace, and to that I say ""good riddance.""",1258848000,4,2023,4.952662721893491
3547444,4,B001E95ZNS,"I want to start by saying that Rachel Getting Married isn't a movie for the faint of heart. There is conflict and lots of it with very little in the way of resolution. Honestly, I don't quite see how anybody could *enjoy* this movie if they didn't get anything cathartic out of it; but I have a number of friends who couldn't directly relate and still appreciated what they saw. That's the first thing you need to know about Rachel Getting Married: despite its seemingly innocuous title, it is not a movie made to entertain. It's a movie made to express.

A possible side effect of this is that Rachel Getting Married isn't a movie for people looking for a strong narrative. This is an exercise in voyeurism. You get to be a fly on the wall at this wedding and the events surrounding it. You get to sit through the highs and lows the the borderline disgustingly schmaltzy ceremony. You get to be put in the almost painfully awkward scenario of a visitor sitting in a room with a fighting family -- emotionally removed from the conflict but unable to escape it and unable to not form your own sympathies.

I ought to close by saying that, if you come from a family that doesn't confront its difficulties, or if you've never been to an intensely hipster wedding; then you may, like many other reviewers, think that this movie is in no way representative of reality. Well, I've attended multiple weddings almost exactly like this one for friends of my family, and the general motion and flow of the family conflict is absolutely spot on.

It's a rather serious drama dealing with Kym's difficult transition back into the real world, and specifically, into family life. It marks something of a departure for Jonathan Demme (Silence of the Lambs) with its intimate portrayal of a family's pains, joys, and turmoils. As the film develops we learn about some of the reasons for the dynamics in this family, specifically the accidental death of Kym's brother in a car accident in which Kym was the driver. This is where a lot of Kym's guilt lies, but we also learn of another's negligence, that of the mother (Debra Winger), which was partly to blame for the boy's death. There is a lot of underlying hurt and pain that revolves around these people just as they are about to celebrate this union between Rachel and her soon to be husband. Shot with the feel of a home movie, given its jerky, hand held camera technique, this film successfully conveys the life of a family trying to cope with their tarnished history just as a new and brighter chapter is seemingly beginning for them.",1255392000,,1200,4.719047619047619

3547448,2,B001E95ZNS,"I'll start right out by saying that Jonathan Demme's vrit-for-the MTV generation RACHEL GETTING MARRIED looked for its first half at least like it was going to be the worst film of the year. I should have known better, I suppose, than to go into this with high expectations, despite the overall ability of the director.  Movies about weddings - and weddings themselves for that matter - have never been something I've particularly liked, and movies about withdrawal or rehab are not high on my list of priorities either. This is both. Kim, younger son of Rachel, gets out of rehab a couple of days before Rachel gets married and goes to join her sister and their kind of ridiculously ethnically diverse family and friends at the huge old country house in Connecticut to make an ass of herself, cry a lot, and generally disrupt everybody's good time.

This film might make a good sociological test - if an educated film-geek liberal from an upper-middle-class family (me) can be so annoyed with the characters that he supposedly should identify with, what would someone who is completely alienated from East coast liberalism feel watching this? A bunch of rich and beautiful people - honestly I don't think there is a single person in the film who isn't better looking, much better looking, than you and me - whining about their problems and not getting along, and the lead character being so petulant you want to kill her.

I know, I know, it's about someone trying to get through a difficult experience - I know drugs and feelings of low self-esteem are a toxic mix, and combine that with forcing yourself to be happy for someone who seems to have it much more together than you - I personally can identify with that - but it all seemed phony and constructed here, particularly in an absolutely atrocious scene where a hairdresser spills the beans about Kim's past in front of her sis for no apparent reason and that all leads to much more shouting and crying and Kim totaling her mother's car but apparently being forgiven by everybody the next day.

Strangely though in the last half hour I grew to tolerate it all more, maybe it all started to gel or something, perhaps the fact that against all odds including ones the movie has deliberately stacked, everybody seems to sort of get along at the end and put aside their squabbles as they are supposed to at a wedding. The cast isn't bad, but I'm not sure it's good either apart from Debra Winger as the mom who seems like she belongs in a better movie. Still on the whole this struck me as a bad blend of John Cassavetes and ""The Real World"" that ends up being more like a too-long and boring version of the latter while lacking all of the depth and soul of the former.",1253750400,5,2723,4.573770491803279

3547450,5,B001E95ZNS,"It's sad to see ""Rachel Getting Married"" such a love-it-or-hate-it reaction, because I truly believe there's something in it for everybody.  Most of the naysayers seem to attack what ""doesn't"" relate to them, rather than what does.  When did it become such a bad thing to see a loving couple get prepped for the most joyous, festive wedding?

Like most indie films, I was reluctant to throw this one into my DVD player.  And after 10 minutes, I was almost ready to turn it off.  The shaky camerawork.  The out-of-water fish character that Kym is from the getgo.  The lack of music.

But then, something really strange happened.  I didn't yawn.  I didn't slouch into my bed.  I didn't pause it for a break.  I didn't turn it off.  And about halfway through, I literally proclaimed aloud, ""Wow!  I'm really getting into this!""

I share this little story because most great movies capture your attention, and refuse to let it go.  ""Rachel Getting Married"" is a different deal, though.  It asks YOU to participate in it.  Like Kym, it asks you submerge yourself into a situation you can't understand.  It wants you to be slightly annoyed with Kym's erratic behavior, but then like her family, asks you to just give her another chance.  It asks you to endure the endless number of toasts that Rachel & Sydney are receiving, because they're so heartfelt, and the wedding couple are enjoying them.  It asks you to listen in on Kym's AA meetings, because so many diseased are bearing their souls at their most intense fear.

If this doesn't sound like a game you want to play, then don't.  There is no movie on this planet that everyone likes.  But...if this sounds like a film test you want to take, then let me share what I got from ""Rachel Getting Married"".

First off, the performances are uniformly strong, but in a different way than most award-winning roles.  In addition to Anne Hathaway's excellent performance as Kym, every actor in this movie completely embodies their roles to a tee.  You forget that their acting, which is probably why Rosemarie Dewitt, Debra Winger, & Bill Irwin weren't recognized for their excellent work as Rachel & parents.  Instead, I grew to know them as ""people"", if you can believe that.

The camerawork has been the subject of much discussion, and understandably so.  Handheld cinematography is a tricky feat, but I never found Jonathan Demme's movements to be distracting.  He wants to feel like you're in the same room from start to finish.  From the musical parties to the uncomfortable family arguments.  What's been misunderstood is that Demme doesn't use the first-person movements for the entire feature film.  There are enough distance shots to help the viewer get his/her bearings.  But when the wedding comes, let me tell you, I wouldn't have it presented any other way.

Jenny Lumet (daughter of acclaimed director Sydney Lumet) wrote the screenplay.  If it's anything like what's on the screen, I have to give her a ton of credit.  ""Rachel Getting Married"" has a traditional narrative, like 99% of dramas, but it doesn't feel like one.  Instead, the film is more of a collection of vignettes and clips.  For example, there's a seemingly pointless scene when Sidney and Paul (Rachel's father) compete in a dishloading contest.  The scene ends when Kym accidentally grabs a dish that brings great pain to Paul's memories.  Now...this scene works as well as it does because Demme (and maybe Jenny Lumet) resist the urge to get all of the actors' reaction shots when that heartbreaking dish is grabbed.  Bill Irwin's mournful face tells enough of a story that we don't need the other people's ""WTF?"" glances.

And of course, there's been much discussion about the music.  If there's a more musical wedding than in ""Rachel Getting Married"", I don't know of it.  The musicians practice and casually play in the background for much of the movie.  Some viewers have also loathed the music; even Kym snaps at one point, ""Are they going to play all day?""  Lemme tell you, if folk music isn't your thing, then this might not work for you.  I hope that the celebratory experience gives enough of a good vibe that you'll dismiss the music selection.

I haven't said much about the story, because you probably already know the basic premise.  Kym gets out of rehab to attend sister Rachel's wedding, with the expected discomfort from all sides of the wedding.  We get the confrontations, and eventually the heartwarming resolutions.  But the reason the story works is because the actors are subtle and skilled enough to give the story a fresh twist.  Plus, Lumet's writing has some remarkable scenes.  The aggressive conversation between Kym and Abby over a family tragedy takes a painful, sharp turn.

To say that ""Rachel Getting Married"" is flawed is wrong, even if you dislike the film.  Jonathan Demme, Jenny Lumet, and the cast & crew clearly made the movie they wanted to make.  If you're not into it, then it's your own taste, and you should find something that you enjoy.  But I'm glad I gave this film two hours of my time, because I wish it was actually a part of my real life.  In a way, it is.",1251331200,2,5135,4.748584371460929
3547451,5,B001E95ZNS,"""Rachel Getting Married"" is an unsparing look at what happens to a dysfunctional family (and a lot of friends) when the ""problem child"" (Kym, played by Anne Hathaway) gets a weekend pass from rehab to attend her sister Rachel's wedding.

Kym's re-entry is shaky, and this is brilliantly conveyed by hand-held camera-work, as the camera follows Kym through the hallways and rooms of her house, and the sad and horrific confrontations with her family and friends.

Kym's rambling, embarrassing ""amends"" speech at the wedding dinner is a classic: uncomfortable, revealing, impolite, wrenching.

But the real culmination comes when a fellow patient thanks Kym in public for her rehab-confessional, which turns out to be a lie and mortifies and outrages Rachel, the oh-so-sane, soon-to-be-psychologist.

This leads to a breakthrough for Kym with her mother, over the lethal event that started Kym's downward slide: Kym recognizes that she doesn't bear all the blame for all the problems in her family.

After a sad/ludicrous suicide effort (eerily similar to Kym's original ""crime""), Kym recognizes that she doesn't have to punish herself or others any more.

The film ends on an ""up"" note with everyone having fun, even Kym in her muted, depressive way.  But then she has to go back to rehab.

The moral, which Kym vaguely recognizes, is that the supposedly ""sickest"" one of a dysfunctional family is often the healthiest, because she at least acknowledges the problem.

The acting throughout is superb, the writing scary in authenticity, the filming at once beautiful and heartbreaking.

The best film I have seen in many years.",1251072000,2,1625,5.1679389312977095
3547452,4,B001E95ZNS,"As this movie begins, Kym is being released from nine months in drug rehab to return home to her elder sister's wedding. We are immediately plunged into the center of a loving but deeply riven family. The parents are divorced and remarried and the two sisters have a kind of mutual resentment that seethes just below their obvious regard for one another. As the movie progresses, we learn about the origins of the rift that broke this family so badly.
Hathaway gives a surprisingly strong performance as Kym and steals the movie. I'd previously admired her loveliness but had no idea of her acting abilities. You both love and hate her character. Kym is profoundly disturbed, also selfish and egocentric. But she's also by far the most honest, bravest character in the movie and you root for her, even though she makes you cringe.
The rest of the cast is also strong with Debra Winger providing an effortless cameo as the divorced mother. The film is also graced by an interesting sound track as various musicians trek to the wedding and contribute to the entertainment. And there is a kind of documentary quality to the rehearsal dinner with its cloying and sometimes embarrassing speeches and to the wedding itself. It almost reminded me of a Robert Altman movie, except that you could understand what everyone was saying since the actors took it in turns to speak. But there was that same painful realism at work.
I don't want to give away the plot. Suffice to say that it kept me interested for almost two hours. At the end, I felt I'd seen a pretty good film that tackled some tough questions, without really delving deep into the heart of them the way an Ingmar Bergman would have.

Near the end of Rachel Getting Married director Demme sometimes gets a bit too wrapped up in the revelry of the wedding, but this quibble aside it's a fine family drama that avoids the cliches (incest, molestation, etc) we've come to expect from such films in favor of more anguished, true scenarios; Hathaway may have gotten the only love at Oscar night but there's a lot to like about this different little film that some find boring but I find quite good.

3547457,4,B001E95ZNS,"All in all, I think this was a great film. It was extremely moving to see how crap and joy come together at such a feast like a wedding. Even though I agree with other reviewers that the portrayal of the wedding was awkward, given the flowery speeches, the politically correct celebration of multiculturalism, I did find it great to see how every family has such a lot of crap going on leading up to the wedding, and continuing afterwards, but that they somehow manage to keep it down during the celebration. As if it were the eye of a tornado. The question of whether this was a boring wedding, or whether the wedding guests were boring or annoying is not too relevant I think.

3547459,5,B001E95ZNS,"Take a look at the star ratings! I've never seen such a curve, with twice as many one-stars as any other number, and with such rhapsody versus such vehemence in the reviews. You'd think it was a book about global warming, from such agonistic writing.

I can understand both sides here. ""Rachel Getting Married"" was in no way entertainment. Even my wife, who for once didn't fall asleep in the middle of a movie she'd rented herself, said she was 'glad she'd seen it' but wouldn't assert that she liked it. She's a psychologist, by the way, and has been ""on the set"" of countless Twelve-Step meetings. She did NOT find anything in this flick unconvincing.

RGM is a two-day romp amid the wedding festivities of a filthy rich, self-consciously unconventional, hideously dysfunctional Connecticut family. The star of the film and the queen of dysfunction is the younger daughter Kym, on furlough from her latest ultra-costly rehab facility for her older sister's wedding. The groom's family seems to have unexplained musical connections; in any case, jazz, blues, rusty metal, samba, and Bollywood jam sessions swirl in the background of the wedding day and night. The whole film is shot with hand-held cameras, at odd angles, over shoulders, through doorways, giving the impression of uncut home movie footage. The groom's younger brother is shown, as if to validate the cinematographic concept, with a video camera whirring constantly. Kym is a tornado of unresolved conflicts, who cuts a swath of grief through the extravagant celebration.

So why didn't ""people"" like this movie? Most of the reasons given in the one-star reviews seem so shallow and petulant that I found myself respecting the craft of director Jonathan Demme and scriptwriter Jenny Lumet more and more as I read them. Hence my own five-star rating. Let's look at the gripes:

1. ""Kym, acted by Anne Hathaway, is a hateful spoiled brat that I couldn't feel any sympathy for.""
Well, dear critic, you got the first part right. Kym is a hard case -- narcissistic, seething with disallowed resentments and jealousies, an `actress' even in her own life story, a liar and faker whose `recovery' is only another histrionic script. She's a walking documentary for the DSN-IV, the `Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association. But who says you're supposed to like her? And who could expect her to `recover' over a weekend with such a family? Hathaway gets Kym perfectly; of course Kym botches everything, of course she returns to rehab just the same head-case she was before the camera started to roll. That's life. The several five-star reviewers who acknowledged their own addiction got it right. No sympathy? Get a heart!

2. ""Nothing happens. There's no resolution."" Exactly. If there had been some miracle of redemption and resolution in the final scenes of this film, I would have thrown my shoe at the screen. This is not a fairy tale.

3. ""Nothing is explained.""
Okay... Is that a problem for you? Can't you project some of your own experiences on it as explanations? One of the best things about this film is that there are no ""flashbacks"", no extenuating narratives. The people are who they are. No alibis.

4. ""The Dad is a wimp.""
You missed something, critic. The Dad is actually Ozzie Nelson of Ozzie and Harriet, or Mister Greenjeans, or Ernie from the Moppets. He's hopelessly conflict-avoidant and ineffective. He's just as selfish and narcissistic as his daughters, but he scripts himself as Mr. Nice. He's part of the problem, not the cure. He's addicted, also, to his own self-image and lifestyle. Actor Bill Irwin nails this role perfectly. Actress Deborah Winger also nails her role as the detached, divorced Mother, out to save herself as best she can. In fact, the whole cast of RGM is superb. Even if you hate the film, you've got to admire the acting.

5. ""I hate those people. They're spoiled, self-indulgent yuppies.""
Yup indeed. They're not ""my people"" either, but aside from their artistic trappings, they're not so removed from us, not in their family dynamics anyway. I could have been at that wedding, as one of the paid help, one of the musicians. Really, I have been. Dress them in costumes from `The Godfather' and give them Jersey accents, or in stetsons and cowboy boots and set the scene in Houston. I wonder, critic... Do you hate them because you're envious of their privilege? Just for fun, imagine yourself a slum-dweller in Tehran, watching this film. If you could follow it, what impression would you form of Americans? This is a film about self-recognition. If you can't recognize anyone in it, may be you need rehab.

6. ""It went on too long. It could have been edited.""
Yeah, yeah, I say the same thing about Wagner. But all the `slow' stuff - all the speeches at the rehearsal dinner, for instance - set us up for Kym's various crack-ups.  Once I'd given up the notion that I was watching the film for pleasure, every scene in it made embarrassing sense.

So now what?

The movies focuses on the complicated relationships of a family as they prepare for daughter Rachel's wedding. The return of younger daughter Kym, fresh from her latest stint in rehab, complicates what should be a festive occasion; Kym's return forces people to confront the emotional baggage they have been holding onto for years. The honesty and ""realness"" of the dialouge is the movie's saving grace; the actors bring a sense of humanity to the characters. Yet, by the end of the film, I felt no real emotional attachment to any of the characters. Yes, I felt sorry for Kym, but the movie was never really moving or as emotionally enagaging as I would have liked.

The plot at times is obvious (the mentions of Ethan quickly led me to believe that Kym had done something to him) and the movie has no real conclusion - it just ends. The final scenes do not tie up the loose ends nicely and leaves many questions unasnwered, which most people will not like. In fact, I am STILL wondering why Kym was going back to rehab in the end. Not to mention, there were alot of unresolved issues that needed resolution to make this a great film (such as: does Kym's mom blame Kym for Ethan's death? Does she blame herself?).

Bottomline, this movie is about the intricacies of family relationships and how hard it is to forgive the people we love the most. Yet, it seems that the only thing harder than forgiving family is turning your back on them.",1247184000,,1584,4.65

First complaint: ""The camera work was nauseating"". So? That's the best criticism you can muster? Hand held cameras are the latest filming technique in an attempt to get a realism you would not normally get with a regular camera, AND what kind of cameras are usually at weddings? Hmmm? Hmmm?

Second complaint: ""This movie is boring"". Boring for who? For Anne Hathaway fans who have dieted on the anemic ""Princess Diaries""? Suckers. You just proved that you can't handle a film with any heft or depth. Which leads to the next criticism.

Third complaint: ""This film is depressing, unreal, pretentious, who has weddings like this, unlikeable characters"". Obviously the critics who have any of these opinions like ""Leave It To Beaver"". Now that was a truly gritty show. Full of realism, and not overly long either! It had so many pertinent conversations that were handled in a very real manner. Best of all, they never dove beneath the surface--so no overly long dinner speeches or dishwasher scenes! Oh, and every character was lovable. Look, you can always watch ""Wedding Crashers"", ""The Wedding Planner"", ""The Wedding Singer"" or how about the stunningly grand ""Bride Wars"" instead.

The plain truth is that Anne Hathaway fans were shook up and whacked on the head with ""Rachel Getting Married"", and they just couldn't handle it.

But while ""Dune"" suffered through trying to adapt a mammoth, dense, incredibly popular sci-fi novel to cinematic form, ""Rachel Getting Married"" extends what should be a lark - a wedding! - into painful tedium.

The movie starts promisingly. Anne Hathaway plays Kym, who is picked up from rehab for a weekend furlough with the family.  Her sister, Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt), is getting married at the family's posh Connecticut suburban home.  The house quickly establishes Rachel's family as just falling short of Wealthy, but easily qualify as Extremely Comfortable.

The more people you meet in this movie, the more depressing it generally gets.  Everyone invited to Rachel's wedding is so replete with satisfaction at the wonderfulness of themselves and everyone around them that you want to tear your hair out.  Speeches at rehearsal dinners drag on interminably because everyone has Something Important to say.  The wedding is a bizarrely multi-cultural affair.  Rachel's fiance, Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe) is an African-American musician - for no apparent reason other than to establish how amazing Rachel is.  Their wedding, again for no apparent reason, is Indian-themed, with Indian-inspired wedding dresses and bridesmaid gowns, even down to an elephant on the wedding cake.  Everyone plays a musical instrument or sings some type of ethnic song.  An elderly friend or uncle, resplendent in his Texas line-dancing wear, uses the rehearsal-dinner toast of drunken uncles everywhere, ""May the only ups and downs you have be in the bedroom.""

Just when you think this wedding can't drag on any longer, a Carnivale band and dancers drop in from Rio for some more resplendent multiculturalism.

Only two things save this movie from the trashbin.  The first is Kym's rehab process.  Kym is damaged goods and is making only halting progress through the Twelve Steps.  Anne Hathaway, normally associated with Shiny Happy People roles, gets gritty and understated with this performance.  She plays an anti-heroine very well, always believable and both sympathetic and infuriating.

The other part of this movie that works is a subplot involving a not-so-distant family tragedy.  This tragedy explains many of the scars Kym's family tries to ignore and features a near-movie stealing performance by Debra Winger as Kym's mother, who left her family behind.  As a parent, all I can say is that this subplot was handled really, really well, pushing emotional buttons without being too heavy-handed.

But that is not enough to save this bloated film.  No movie wedding should be this long or feature a family this self-righteous unless it is an outright satire.  Roger Ebert, in his review, wishes that he could have attended a wedding like this.  All I can say is, if I were invited to attend a wedding with Rachel's family, he can go in my place any day.",1245888000,48,3364,5.076502732240437

3547470,2,B001E95ZNS,"This was Jonathan Demme's ""un-movie."" There was no plot. Kym, a young woman with various drug (and other) problems, gets out of rehab just in time to attend her sister Rachel's wedding. That's it. Demme simply follows Kym around with a camera as she goes about the business of being a self-absorbed addict.

The interesting part of the film was the degree to which it didn't feel like a film at all. You actually see the cameramen in nearly all the shots (they double as wedding guests/actors), and most of the lines appeared to be not only unrehearsed but ad-libbed. The hand-held effect combined with an utter lack of conventional plot created the illusion that we were actually a part of the wedding.

The question is, did we want to be? Although the personal drama was engaging, and the acting quite good (especially under the circumstances), the movie's lack of structure made it hard to follow and even harder to enjoy. I understand that Demme was not necessarily going for structure in this film, but without a story it was very difficult to keep my interest going. After the dramatic high point (Kym's fight with her mother and subsequent car wreck), the movie just fizzled.

There is a world of difference between the ""natural look"" and actually filming reality. (Or what passes for reality). The difference is that while the illusion of reality is engaging, a film that simply shows you bare, unaltered reality is not. Face it, most of our ""natural"" conversations are boring, and nearly all weddings are dull. For a more successful rendition of both the theme and the technique, I would suggest Pieces of April, which managed to be both realistic (in the film sense) and very enjoyable.",1244678400,6,1696,4.801369863013699

3547475,2,B001E95ZNS,"In Roger Ebert's review of ""Rachel Getting Married,"" he quotes a friend as saying something along the lines of ""Wouldn't you love to go to a wedding like that?""  Really?  I couldn't wait for it to be over.  With the black groom's family decked out in traditional African garb, the East Indian ceremony (with the bride and bridesmaids in saris), the belly dancer and the samba band, I felt like I was trapped in some pretentious, politically correct fashion week shindig produced for the United Colors of Bennetton.  Director Jonathan Demme, in the DVD extras, talks about how ""real"" this wedding is, how it reflects his circle of friends and the diverse world we've all come to live in.  What do you mean ""we,"" white man?  Perhaps if I were a rich and famous Academy Award-winning director I might go to weddings like Rachel's...perhaps.  But Ebert's friend's comment reflects how much of a fantasy the film is; no-one really goes to these types of weddings because they only exist in affected independent Art Films that purport to deal with The Meaning of Life.  (Or is it The Human Condition?)

And Life, Love, Loss, Failure, Hurt, Anger, Pain, Disappointment...they're just some of the emotions ""Rachel Getting Married"" attempts to deal with.  Unfortunately, Demme seems to have put more of his energies into the look of the film than the content.  When one is more impressed by a gorgeous wedding cake - and man, is it exquisite! - than by the scene in which a mother and daughter finally confront one another about past betrayals, you know something is terribly wrong.  To Demme and screenwriter Jenny Lumet's credit, most of this dysfunctional family's conflicts remain unresolved.  The most bitter one, however, between Rachel and her junkie sister Kym (Anne Hathaway), is swiftly and inexplicably wrapped up in an unbelievable, neat little pink bow.  (One gets the feeling that Demme didn't want the drama to get in the way of the samba band and belly dancer.)  It's probably the sourest of this film's many sour notes.

The only reason to see this film is the extraordinary performance of Anne Hathaway, who proves, with courage and fierce conviction, that she's an actress who can do anything.  She's frightening, funny, heartbreaking and passionate...in some scenes all at the same time. As reviewers have noted - and they're right - it's a career changer.  The other performances don't register much, except to annoy.  Most disappointing is Debra Winger as Hathaway's mother.  Demme (again in the DVD extras) talks about circumventing (i.e. dismissing) Winger's ""technique"" by telling her, more often than not, to ""just do the scene.""  As the director, Demme has a right to do whatever he wants...but when you're dealing with an actress who's given some of the great film performances of the past 25 years (and you're dragging her out of semi-retirement), the least you can do is meet her halfway.

The best I can say about ""Rachel Getting Married"" is that I saw it at home, which allowed me to fast-forward through it's many cringe-worthy moments.  (Particularly the groom's a cappella version of  Neil Young's ""Unknown Legend."")  I put down the remote, however, when Ms. Hathaway was onscreen.

3547479,3,B001E95ZNS,"The film caught my attention right away and held my interest for a long time, mostly because of the character, Kym, brilliantly played by Ann Hathaway.  The idea was good---the recovering drug addict going home on a weekend break from rehab for her sister's wedding only to face the demons that drove her into drugs in the first place.

Kym is the girl everyone hates..the family Bad Girl...no matter what she does to extricate herself from the role, she just digs herself in deeper.  At first I disliked her, just like everyone else (except her saintly dad) but as the film progressed she was the only one who had any credibility.  I didn't find the character of Rachel to be very sympathetic.  Yeh, it was her wedding and here was Kym trying to take over the show, but somehow I just couldn't warm up to her...maybe it was the actress, who had no looks, charm or charisma.

Where the film lost me was the really long, overly shmaltzy rehersal dinner and the equally overly long, really shmaltzy wedding.  Egad!  At first the toasts to the beloved couple were charming and the reactions of the very colorful group were sweet.  But a little of that goes a long way and this was really overdone.  We were led to believe that the couple were the most wonderful people who ever decided to get married...but we were shown nothing at all to justify all of the hyperbole.  The idea of having them be inter racial perhaps was the justification in the mind of the film maker for all the hoop-la, but I found the whole thing so overblown that it made me want to scream.  Then the wedding was done in Hindu style and then there were Polynesian belly dancers or were they Aztec?--who knows, who cares.  Oh yeah, a break dancer and don't forget the really nice Black guy with glasses who was home on leave from Iraq...But it was lovely and everyone ended up loving everyone, even the divorced parents and ....Well I could see why the poor girl took drugs in the first place.

A good idea gone awry...someone needed to pare this film down to the basics and it might have been genuinely moving.  Demme got carried away with the celebration and all the heartwarmingness....which just turned a whole lot of people off.  For a film that tries so hard to show human emotion and the power of family love, it was curiously un-moving.

I gave it three stars for the acting which was pretty good.  Besides Hathaway, Debra Winger was excellent as her mother, and Bill Irwin (whom I fell in love with as the mute mime on Northern Exposure) was wonderful.",1243555200,11,2530,4.535242290748899

Some of the characters were o-kay for stereotypes, but as genuine reflections?  Not so much.

Especially Anne Hathaway's character.

If you've EVER dealt with an addict or a recovering one (especially early on), they are no where near as 'thinking' as Hathway's character.  While she did what she could as an actress, the way this character is written is poor.

Honestly, I only really believed the father's character in the movie.

Ultimately, despite some emotionally riveting moments with the actors, this is not a film. It is a bloated, self-serving tribute to angst with little regard for dramatic structure.  If you have a dysfunctional family, just set up a video camcorder, hit play, and carry the camera around for a few days. Watch it real time, without edits, and see how much you can stand it.

It was a pleasant surprise to discover this new dimension in her performance where her good looks are incidental and not the mainstay.

The direction is superb.  One becomes a part of the family on screen and that feeling stays for quite some time even after the movie ends.  For me this is more than I can say about most movies.

Another thing I love about the movie is the mature way it embraces the multi racial, and to some extent even the multi cultural, aspects. It does it quietly, without giving it undue importance. It is just there and is a non-issue.

There was a horrible tragedy that Kym was responsible for.  That dark cloud hangs over the family and the festivities.  From some things we can never recover.
This movie does an excellent job exploring the life of a recovering addict.  Plus the elements of a dysfunctional family, interracial marriage, and sibling rivalry.  Director Demme(Silence of the Lambs) actually injects compassion into this sad tale that gives it an uncomfortable realism.

Funny thing is, I know why Demme put that violin there; from her first scene in the house, to the dish-loading scene...it keeps the tension up. You see, this whole film is from the freshly rehabed addict's point of view, and that's no fun place to be; as watching this film will show. I've been clean for 6 years now, and was shocked to find there were times I could hardly sit through the film. Demme does an amazing job of using every element at his disposal to push the envelope of the viewer's willingness to stick with this story; just as the main character is being pushed inexorably and unwillingly ahead. The celebration scene with the never-ending musical parade gets louder and amps up the energy way past when most filmmakers would cut the scene; that's absolutely true. But for me it was because we (the audience) are supposed to be in Hathaway's head; and the whole experience is just dancing on her raw nerves. This film reminded me more of PERMANENT MIDNIGHT, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, 28 DAYS or CLEAN AND SOBER than any other film with WEDDING in the title. But of those, only REQUIEM further explores every technique at the director's disposal to push the audience into the same shoes as the main characters. Every addict should see this one.

3547495,2,B001E95ZNS,"Jonathan Demme's ""Rachel Getting Married"" follows a dysfunctional family whose member Rachel is getting married. But here Rachel is not the center of the story. It is Kym, Rachel's sister, returning home from rehab for weekend.

Anne Hathaway plays Kym. I like Anne Hathaway, but I didn't like Kym. No, it's worse because I really didn't care who Kym is or what this troubled girl does. About 15 minutes in, I started to think: ""OK, her acting is not bad, but what's the point of the film anyway?""

""Rachel Getting Married"" soon becomes like someone's wedding video, which is occasionally interesting, but ultimately boring with never-ending footage of someone singing and speaking about people we are not even interested in.

Perhaps Jonathan Demme takes the easy way out - lazy filmmaking in the name of documentary style. His eternally shaky camera chases the actors pretending the wedding guests, recording their dialogues that are not particularly interesting. Today YouTube offers much better home videos that tells something about much interesting people.

Sometimes the director remembers that he has to further the thin story, so he randomly employs clich after clich - an AA meeting, a tragedy in the past, a slap in the face, a car crash, etc. The list goes on in Jenny Lumet's script, but there is nothing remotely emotional or insightful about the badly edited film.

But perhaps the tedious, rambling narrative, or my uncomfortable feeling watching uninteresting characters yelling and musing, is exactly the point the film is trying to make. Maybe we should stop complaining and watch these professional and non-professional actors (including Demme's mentor Roger Corman) doing what they can do.

They are not to be faulted - they did good job. Anne Hathaway, who is nominated for Oscar for her turn in this film, is certainly riveting though her acting tends to be one-noted. Sadly we are not allowed to learn about her character except a few obvious things. In fact I couldn't figure out why all these family members should be behaving like that, or why we should care for that matter.",1241395200,2,2102,5.008595988538682
3547496,5,B001E95ZNS,"Anne Hathaway has come a long way, baby, since The Princess Diaries. In Havoc, though not a very good movie, she really stood out, revealing a lot of... emotional depth.

She has since proved it by holding her own against a devilish Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada, Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain, and as Agent 99 in the movie based on the TV Show, Get Smart, where she showed off her considerable comedy chops.

In Rachel Getting Married she does heavy drama, with just the right light touch of humor for comic relief. She creates a great character, really annoying and unsympathetic. She would almost be likeable, with her sharp wit and good looks, were it not for the fact that she has more baggage than the luggage carousel at LAX on the day before Xmas, and her annoying little habit of making everything about her. She is released from rehab for her sister Rachel's marriage. She sees it as a great opportunity for mayhem. Oh well. At least the people from her hometown are glad to see her:

Later she finds that Kiernan is going to be the best man. She has been demoted to bridesmaid due to her unreliability, but demands that the Maid of Honor step down, because sister trumps best friend. Isn't that cute? The Best Man and Maid of Honor met at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. She quickly discerns that Kiernan is a lawyer.

-------------
Kym: You're a lawyer?
Kieran: Was. For about five minutes.
Kym: Say something Legal.
Kieran: Tort.
===================

You can bet she has a clever retort for that. But getting back to her most annoying habit, you HAVE to see her wedding toast. After a long line of really inappropriate toasts that everyone takes in stride, this being a marriage between two people whose families are involved in music and tolerant to a fault, you can hear the whole room grind to a halt while she does her stand up rehab routine. Of course she has broken the cardinal rule of toasts, that while you may recall embarrassing incidents from your collective pasts, the toasts should be about the people getting married, not just about yourself. For Kym, it is always about her. Later, she gets annoyed that her sister Rachel has ended their argument with the news that she is expecting.

-----------------------
Kym: [Upon learning her sister is pregnant]
Kym: That is so unfair!
================================

As good as Anne Hathaway is, she gets a lot of competition from Debra Winger, playing her mother, who is a bit of a diva. When Winger arrives, fashionably late, everyone holds their breath. They both adore and are exasperated by her, as she seems to hold everyone at an emotional distance. Later, it is revealed that there is a lot of guilt and stress and blame and heartache between the mother and daughter. A tragic event haunts them both. It takes a very accomplished actress to pull off the emotional centerpiece of the film, given her relatively short amount of screen time. Rosemarie DeWitt also deserves praise as Rachel, just as determined to not let Kym spoil her wedding as Kym seems determined to wreck it.

Jonathan Demme did a great job of directing this film, orchestrating the drama, letting the preparations for the wedding, the endless rehearsals by the musicians (these families really must know a lot of musicians) build, fanning the tension to a fever pitch; until the wedding, and the news of the upcoming bundle of joy brings everyone together. Demme is really immersed as much in the music world as the film world, having made films with Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, and The Talking Heads, and he really brings that experience to bear on Rachel Getting Married. The musical interludes at the wedding are a delight. The groom even sings his vows, and believe it or not, it sounded great.

3547497,2,B001E95ZNS,"""Rachel Getting Married"" is a story of masked-over family dysfunction. A young woman, Kym (Anne Hathaway) is released from Rehab to attend her sister Rachel's interracial, multi-cultural wedding, and during the course of wedding preparations, the rawness and bitterness of the family's wounds and resentments are torn open.

Anne Hathaway's stunning portrayal of a recovering drug addict responsible for her younger brother's death, is the highlight of the movie. Her luminosity jumps from the screen and who knew when she played those sweet Disney princesses that there was so much depth to her talent?  Debra Winger as her cold and isolated mother also gives a memorable performance.  But, the film itself is not memorable and at times it is irritating.

There are too many gatherings of all the wedding party, sharing lame reminisces and nervous laughter.  We are repeatedly stuck as viewers at their table or sharing their festivities and wishing that we could escape.  The hand-held camera technique is annoying; it distracts from the story with jerkiness and looks amateurish, a la Robert Altman's worst moments.  Overall disappointing, but  it serves as a surprising vehicle for wonderful performances from Anne Hathaway and Debra Winger.",1241308800,7,1245,5.348717948717948
3547498,3,B001E95ZNS,"With an affectionate nod to Robert Altman, director Jonathan Demme has crafted a leisurely paced drama of dysfunctional intimacy. Despite its handheld-camera overkill, the voyeuristic style of ""Rachel Getting Married"" works surprisingly well. Unfortunately, Anne Hathaway is miscast as a recovering addict and avowed narcissist  lacking the necessary emotional depth to pull off this complex role. (Imagine how much better the film would have been if Ellen Page had played the lead character.) The truly stellar performances belong to Rosemarie DeWitt and Debra Winger, yet they were denied the Oscar nod that Hathaway inexplicably received. An uneven family affair, ""Rachel Getting Married"" benefits from Jenny Lumet's incisive screenplay and a fine supporting cast.",1241308800,,767,5.787610619469026
3547499,4,B001E95ZNS,"I usually don't go out of my way to see a film with the word ""wedding"" in the title. I have absolutely nothing against weddings. I just don't enjoy the typical, cliched family dramas surrounding nuptials. There are exceptions. I really loved ""Four Weddings and A Funeral,"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding."" When I saw that ""Rachel's Getting Married"" had come out in rentals, I took a chance. I had heard so many good things about the film. So, I figured, why not? I must say I am not sorry at all. This is a really good, and most unconventional movie.

Yes, it involves a dysfunctional family, (don't they all?), but there's lots of edgy humor, a cast which includes people of almost every ethnicity on earth, and extraordinary music - world music, jazz, rock, heavy metal, Brazilian sambas, and a few cuts which are impossible to categorize. The eclectic musical score suits, as the bride, Rachel, (played by Rosemarie DeWitt), a Caucasian, is marrying Sidney, (Tunde Adebimpe), an African American musician and record producer, and the wedding theme is Indian, with the bride and her court dressed in saris. Jenny Lumet wrote the screenplay, and director Jonathan Demme, (""The Silence of the Lambs""), obviously encouraged his cast to be spontaneous. Apparently, he chose not to plan shots in advance to add to the spontaneity. I am sure there is much ad libbing involved, especially during scenes from the rehearsal dinner, a myriad of speeches and toasts to bride and groom, (some rather bizarre), and the dancing at the wedding reception. Cinematographer Declan Quinn effectively shoots the movie with a handheld digital camera, which bobs through the partially improvised scenes, lending a sense of chaos and the realism of a homemade movie.

Anne Hathaway, as Kym, plays a recovering addict who, after nine months in rehab, returns to her Connecticut home for her sister Rachel's wedding. Ms. Hathaway's wonderful performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. The chain-smoking, self-absorbed Kym, complains, after a few hours back in the family fold, ""Everyone in the house is looking at me like I am a sociopath!"" ""What do they expect me to do, burn the house down?"" Well yeah...maybe. Kym has a long and tragic history of unfortunate accidents while under the influence of - you name it. With her short, choppy hair cut, and black eyeliner, she throws frequent tantrums. During one, she demands that her sister's best friend step down as maid of honor and cede the place to her. Her wedding toast to the happy couple begins with: ""I'm Shiva the destroyer, and I am your harbinger of doom for the evening ...!!"" Oy!!! But, this is Rachel's time in the sun. The focus should be on the her and not the disturbed younger sister. It takes a while for the viewer to realize just how disturbed and damaged Kym is.

The sisters, who obviously love each other very much, fight over the attention of their nurturing, peacekeeping father, (Bill Irwin), and their distant mother Abby, (Debra Winger, who is outstanding in the part). There is an exceptional scene between Hathaway and Winger, which is one of the best and most explosive mother daughter interactions I have seen on film or in the theater. The parents are divorced and both have remarried, which adds more tension to the mix.

The ensemble cast gives performances of the highest caliber. The characters they play become people we care about. The viewer sees these people at their worst and at their best. This is an exceptionally good, rich family drama. A must see, especially for those who enjoy edgy Indies.

3547501,1,B001E95ZNS,"Despite the fine acting by Ann Hathaway, Jonathan Demme manages to destroy this movie ( I cannot bring myself to call it a film ) with his sad moviemaker's indulgence towards his characters and his story. His attempts to manipulate the viewer are laughably transparent and fall flat. There is a scene with the family watching a character load the dishwasher that is about as bad as a scene can be. What was Demme smoking when he made this? Bleech.",1240876800,11,447,4.6
3547502,1,B001E95ZNS,"It's boring. It's impossible to like any of the characters. But where this movie - a flick that so aims for realism - REALLY loses its way is when it makes us all sit through an absolutely excruciating wedding rehearsal dinner. Are there really rehearsal dinners, after all, at which every ANNOYING, SELF-CENTERED guest has to stand up and make a speech? Or where various guests read poems, tell jokes or play saxophones during a sort of pre-rehearsal-dinner talent show? And if there WERE such a dinner, would you ever, EVER want to be stuck for so long with such an utterly awful group of show-offs?

Even if you make it through the dinner, do real families actually stage competitions to see who can load a dishwasher the fastest? Hey, they do in Rachel's family! Then onto some more unlikable characters in unlikely situations. So it goes.

Gritty and real as it wants to be, ""Rachel Getting Married"" is packed to the gills with the kinds of events and characters that only exist in movies. Yes, it bears the Demme brand. But that only makes it a pedigreed movie, not a good one. Much like the Stanley Kubrick misfire, ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" this flick got better notices than it deserved upon its release. But don't be fooled. This is a great example of a good director making a bad movie. It will be found out.",1240790400,22,1311,4.574468085106383
3547503,4,B001E95ZNS,"With its look at a dysfunctional family of artsy ""silk stocking"" East Coast liberal types and its handheld camera work, this almost seemed like a new Woody Allen film of the Husbands and Wives variety, but there are elements of it that are thoroughly Demme, particularly the use of musicians and the multicultural wedding setpiece that ends the film. The use of deep-depth-of-field digital video really pays off during this colourful sequence. It has a nice structure, moving from the self-centredness of Kim (Anne Hathaway) to a closing shot that finally puts Rachel at the center of things, and I love how it finally suggests that what's really wrong with this family is the neglectful mother (Debra Winger), who has since moved on to a second marriage. Just like some of Woody Allen's films, it's almost shamelessly amateurish in places (the rehearsal dinner, the fight between Kim and her mom, the sketchy editing before and after Kim crashes the car, almost as if Demme hadn't really shot enough footage, etc.), but the true test of how engrossing you'll find all this is your tolerance for self-absorbed rich people. Mine's at a low ebb, but I'll give this film at extra star anyway because it elevates Anne Hathaway to the rank of real actresses. I look forward to her delivering something even better.",1240790400,,1309,4.900900900900901
3547504,1,B001E95ZNS,I can't remember seeing a movie as bad as this.  The quality of the picture and the editing was almost amateurish.  Can't believe the Oscars and Golden Globes even considered this for an award.  The only reason I gave it one star is because the web site wouldn't let this go through without a rating.  It deserves 0 or negative stars.,1240704000,12,334,4.426229508196721
3547505,3,B001E95ZNS,"After watching Kym, Ann Hathaway's character, for about half an hour I wanted to just to smack her.  A chain smoking, ex drug addict who had spent the last several months in drug rehab, Kym is so full of herself and so demanding that she always be the center of attention that it's no wonder she ended up the way she did.  She demands throughout the movie that the focus be on her rather than her sister Rachel who is getting married.

This is one of those ""slice of life"" type movies that doesn't really end up having much of a plot, but rather is more like a reality show, looking into the lives of other people as it plays out.  That's why I gave it only 3 stars, because I don't find this type of movie particularly entertaining and prefer movies as an escape from everyday life rather than looking into it.  That said, the acting and directing was superb, especially Ann Hathaway's character.  All of the character's personalities were well developed and by the end of the movie you felt that you knew them on a personal level.",1240704000,2,1032,4.405263157894737

3547507,5,B001E95ZNS,"My husband refused to watch this after the first few minutes.  He doesn't like the way the camera moves around, and assumed it was a chick flick.  After I finished watching I told him that it was wonderful, and he said he was sure it was (sarcasm here).  So I was very interested to see the high ratings with men's names, who said that at first they thought it would be a film girls would like, but that they liked it, also.  Given the part of the story that happened prior to the film, that you find out as the film progresses, it is fascinating to see how people act, and how believable it is.  And I loved all of the ""mundane"" things that went on during the preparation, rehearsal dinner and wedding.  It made it so real.  I wish I could do a better job of describing this film, because I think anyone who watches it will be very glad that they did.",1240617600,,852,4.158536585365853
3547508,1,B001E95ZNS,"This movie is a terrifying specimin of early 21st century establishment sponsored racial mind control and social engineering. Something akin to the mental climate it engineers must have occured in 1930s Gerany. It smacks of soviet agitprop. The nominal subject of the movie is conflict between a narcisistic drug addled daughter just out of rehab and her yuppie family on the day of her sister's marriage. But the dominant subtext, pounded home ad nauseam and with ever accelerating blatency,is the dynamics of the pending black/white inter racial marriage, and the miraculous new age harmony between bride, groom, and both families, presumably newly met. The bride Rachel's family are wealthy Conneticut super wasps, ""California perfect"" people, NPR clones, full of family conflict but politically correct down to their toes. The black groom's family is a collection of positive p.c. cliches not to be believed. There's the clean cut brother soldier home from the war, the hip smart sister, the long suffering all wise matriarch, several obviously well placed employed males...on and on they go. There are smart witty gays at the wedding, there are smart witty asians. everyone is wittier than thou. There are no jews that i could identify, but one jewish family is there, the Rosenblatts. We don't get to meet them, but the father of the bride does mention them as he plans to seat them at the back of the room near the kitchen. He snidely states that they are not actually friends of the family, just neighbors that they've had to suffer for 20 years. Thus one ray of authenic Connecticut waspness penetrates this pc fantacy. Oddly, it's in harmony with the BBC/ NPR's increasing hostility to Isreal as it tries to defend itself from 2 million hostile and frequently murderous Muslims. What a seamless world is the American power elete. If anyone hasn't noticed that black American males now have open access to white females, the groom corrects that by kissing and fondling his intended bride with a frequency rarely seen outside bonobo troops. Johnathan Demme directs this clap trap; that fact makes the whole thing that much scarrier as a phenominum of public mind control.

Before the pc possee saddles up to come after me, I'd just like to state that I'm a card carrying environmentalist from 1950 on, hate Bush, love Carter, fought for equal civil rights under law before there was black power, etc etc.  But i give this gobbler an F.",1240444800,3,2443,4.95609756097561
3547509,5,B001E95ZNS,"I was terribly surprised and saddened to see all of the negative reviews that have been written up for this movie. After skimming quite a few of them, I was surprised to see that some of the reviewers seemed to have missed the point of the film.

Rachel Getting Married is certainly not an action film. There are no explosions, guns, dead bodies, ghosts, or slimy monsters. Nor is it a romantic comedy. I think perhaps the attention from the academy- whose selections are often more conventional and showy- might have caused many people to have false expectations for the film. Fans of other academy favorites, like ""A Beautiful Mind,"" or ""Gladiator,"" might be disappointed with this movie. My father, for example, would probably never sit through this movie- neither would my brother, for that matter. Its just not how either of them would want to spend his Friday night. I don't think everyone should like this movie, but I think that it should be judged with appropriate expectations in mind.

I noticed that one reviewer mentioned that he/she could not enjoy the film because he/she found Anne Hathaway's character to be so unlikeable. I have to wonder if that viewer watched the movie all the way through. Rachel Getting Married is a portrait of a family faced with the seemingly insurmountable challenge of forgiveness. The director shows us who this woman is through the relationships she has, rather then through her actions. In the beginning of the film I also despised this character- she appears to be a narcissistic, selfish woman obsessed with her own flaws, greedily feeding off of the attention of everyone around her. As the movie progresses, however, the director mercilessly peels off layer after layer of the recovering addict- and as the minutes tick by, the viewers get swept up into the emotional turmoil of the film. I found myself empathizing with the character, and loving her despite her tremendous flaws. Once the film had ended, I realized why it was necessary to react violently to her in the beginning.

I believe that the director was trying to remind the audience what it truly means to be a family, and how difficult it can be to forgive someone you love, even when you know that they are still punishing themselves. Rachel Getting Married is hard to watch, perhaps because many viewers must have people in their life that they cannot bring themselves to forgive- including themselves. How many of us have had a brother, and uncle, a parent, who did something so despicable, so terrible, that we could not look at them without being reminded of it? How many of us have known addicts who have done terrible, terrible things? How many of us avoid these people, not trusting them, not trusting ourselves, because the love we feel for them is involuntary, and leaves us vulnerable to their potential future mistakes? Rachel Getting Married forces us to examine this relationship- to experience it throughout the course of Rachel's wedding.

As far as the movie being pretentious- I thought that it actually took a few shots at the pretentious, liberal, intellectual family (the unexplained cultural theme of the wedding itself, for example, I thought particularly funny). But perhaps I was only able to appreciate this because of my own experiences with privileged families (both liberal and conservative) growing up.

This film is not for everyone, but I thought it a beautiful and skillful portrait of a woman- not as an individual, but as a daughter and a sister. As a person whose actions effect those around her- as a person who desperately wants to be forgiven. The performances are especially breathtaking, and the overall message is relevant. I loved it.",1240358400,3,3691,4.908653846153846

Kym has a weekend pass from her residential rehab program, and when she comes home she ignites the flames of family dysfunctions--sarcasm and sibling rivalry, manipulation and negotiation, control and co-dependence, shame and blame, fight and flight, and most everyone spinning their best: ""Everything's going to be perfect,"" Rachel's mother Abby (Debra Winger) assures her. It's not, of course, far from it, but as the movie evolves we begin to realize that's okay. Two very long scenes add a deeply human touch to the film--the rehearsal dinner with corny jokes, heartfelt stories and well-wishing by a mix of families and friends that only a wedding can muster, and then the wedding itself on a rainy day that can't dampen the genuine celebration. Natural lighting, the absence of any music track, and hand held cameras give the film the feel of a wedding home movie that might easily be about our very own families.",1240272000,,1021,5.047337278106509

This is by far, one of the worst films I've seen in quite some time.

Through good acting, genuine emotion and unique camera shots, Demme's film convinces the viewer that the experiences Kym and her kin have could be anyone's family in the right, or wrong, circumstance. While the film is titled Rachel Getting Married, it focuses on Kym and the tension she places on her relatives.  This stress becomes evident almost immediately when she says goodbye to the nurse at rehab and gets into her father's  car.

Every once in awhile you take the camera off the tripod and zoom into close ups of the guests as they interact with one another (talking about the correct way to cook a hamburger or they play badminton). Be sure to do a lot of whip pans and jerky motions while you film it, too.

Eighty minutes of this movie is devoted to a rehearsal dinner and a wedding reception where people toast the bride and groom and dance around.  The artsy/fartsy's probably find that incredibly fascinating and an in-depth study of the human psyche...but most normal folk shrug the shoulders and wonder what is remotely entertaining about it?

I don't even know what this movie is about.  A wedding with an interracial couple and their families talking to them with a microphone and there's a pill popping character who...I don't even know.  Is she coming home to make amends for the bad things she's done in the past?  She just smokes cigarettes and feels sorry for herself, so you never really know or care why she's hanging around.

If you like movies where nothing happens at all other than dancing, speeches and a competition of how to load a dishwasher properly, buy this one.

If you like some entertainment value in your motion pictures, rent or buy something else.

I can't believe Jonathan Demme made this movie.",1239494400,16,1618,4.742857142857143

Then again, the Academy isn't always right.  To be honest, I had to shut the movie off every 10 minutes because that's all I could handle.  I wanted to smack Anne Hathaway's character when she made that heinous speech during the rehearsal dinner.  All I could think was, ""self-serving and overreaching"".  There were some genuine notes of emotion with regard to dysfunctional family dynamics but the film was not involving or emotionally moving to me.

The only character I liked was Rachael.  The actress who portrayed her should've been recognized for her performance.  Anne Hathaway's performance wasn't Oscar caliber; it was just another attempt to get her Princess Diaries past put to rest.  I think Miss Hathaway should understand that taking off her clothes, being a drug addict and being a part of gratuitous sex scenes is just trying too hard and doesn't make for a good role or good cinema.  The plodding nature of the film was surprising since Jonathan Demme directed it.  It was a disappointment because I wanted to like the film.",1239408000,8,1183,4.830845771144278

A good director tells a story thru the movie.  You do not need any camera tricks.  Those jerking around becomes a major distraction.

One way to watch this movie is to close your eyes occassionally and just listen to the dialogue... won't miss much.

Too bad with such a strong cast and good story line, what could have been a good movie was spoiled by poor camera trick.",1239235200,,642,4.521739130434782
3547521,3,B001E95ZNS,"After my sister saw RACHEL GETTING MARRIED in the theater, she called me to say she had seen the best film of the year.  I never saw the film, so I watched the DVD and tried to see what my sister loved so much.  Anne Hathaway gave a stellar performance and I see why she was nominated for various awards, but I saw nothing else in the film to make me consider it with such high regard as did my sister.  For me, the story dragged and needed tighter editing.  I wasn't too fond of the camera work, but that's my humble opinion.  When the DVD finished playing, I tried watching the special features, but after a few minutes, I ejected the DVD and went on about my business.

I'm a fan of films which concentrate on dysfunctional families.  Perhaps it makes my own family seem more normal or perhaps they give me more ammunition for taking our interactions to a new level of absurdity.  What this film lacked for me was that ammunition because there was nothing extraordinary.  In the film, we have one sister who needs to be the center of the world, or does the world simply see her as the center and everyone follows that plan?  We have a mother who is aloof, or is she simply surviving as she knows how, removed from the daily existence of those she left behind?  We have a father who only knows the path of least resistance, or is he simply being passive aggressive in order to forge ahead and keep afloat?  We have a multicultural, multiracial, multireligious gathering for a celebration that brings with it baggage of a hundred years and lives.  For Hathaway's portrayal of a young woman who is broken and unable to fix herself without bits chipping away with every move, I recommend this DVD.  That's about it for me.",1239148800,3,1721,4.4222222222222225

The film probably would have been stronger had some of the scenes not been so drawn-out.  It's not that I mind length; it's just that we don't need to see the wedding party dancers and singers going on and on. It doesn't add much of anything to the story.",1239062400,,497,4.221052631578948

It was laying on the table, so I put it on hoping that something interesting would happen.  And something really interesting did.  Now this is not light entertainment by any measure--it is really a work of art instead. The plot is well known by now and would seem a little obvious and maybe even a little trite were one to merely describe it.  But with this group of actors and musicians it becomes something far more lasting than any plot outline might lead one to suspect.  One of the real benefits of the DVD format is the features section. Jonathan Demme and his actors, musicians and crew appear in three sequences which are NOT to be ignored.  The final one is a Q& A after a screening of the film and it is simply fascinating.

3547527,3,B001E95ZNS,"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***

RACHEL GETTING MARRIED is a depressing tale of a family's dysfunction and how all of them try to come to grips with a terrible accident. Unfortunately for Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Off-the-Black/dp/B000M343CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Off the Black</a>), it's all coming to a head during her wedding. But let's back up a second.

This isn't the story of Rachel, it's the story of her sister Kym (Anne Hathaway,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becoming-Jane/dp/B000ZIZ0RU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becoming Jane</a>), a mentally screwed up young woman who finds herself released from a psychiatric hospital in order to attend her sister's wedding. The big question is ""Why is Kym so screwed up?"" This is the crux of the film and it is one of its biggest strengths that no film-time is really given over to it and only small hints dropped about what's caused so much of a rift in this unique family. Apparently Kym had serious drug issues in her youth, and one fateful day she was driving her little brother around and had a horrible accident which caused his death. Never fully recovering from this terrible incident, Kym's psychiatric recover was obviously fraught with difficulties.

We later learn that some of this blame can be firmly placed on her family. Some of it on her father (who refuses to acknowledge his family's problems), but most of it on her mother Abby (the estimable Debra Winger) who knew about Kym's drug problems but let her care of her brother anyway.

The best part of Rachel Getting Married is that it doesn't force this main issue and lets it slide into our consciousness with the creeping nature of a thriller. It was also nice to see Anne Hathaway in a not-so-nice role; her character was neither empathetic nor evil, but simply a person with huge issues who doesn't get any help from her family and isn't able to handle it herself.

Where the film falls is during the wedding's build-up (which is what surrounds these events). We never really get to know Rachel's future husband nor why Rachel's family is so into music (they just are), even though much time is given over to scenes depicting both music and Rachel's future husband's association with it. There's also a ridiculous but funny scene in which a dishwasher loading contest takes place. Okay. Funny. But what was the point?

It is strange, too, that the film is listed as a dramatic comedy, but don't be fooled. There's very little comedy to be found here. Much of it is downright depressing, if not insightful. So be prepared.",1238457600,,2662,5.2665094339622645
3547528,5,B001E95ZNS,"This was one of the finest films I've seen in a LONG time. I was on Amazon to buy something else when I noticed the average rating out of 75 reviews was only 3 stars. I thought I would take up some of my valuable time to bump that up a bit because it deserves it!!!  When I saw that 23 people only gave it 1 star, it stunned me! I guess what ""they"" say is true. We all are, truly, watching our own movie. Being a psychology major it always amazes me that you can take any number of people and get such completely different reactions. This movie is REALISTIC, HONEST, GRITTY, DEEPLY MOVING, and one of maybe 2 or 3 that I went out and bought after renting it this year. The handheld cameras that some complained about are part of what made it feel so REAL. One of the ABSOLUTE BEST AND MORE UNIQUE FILMS I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME!!! Peace, and Love, L.",1238284800,,850,4.059523809523809
3547529,4,B001E95ZNS,"This film is painfully brutal in it's honest portrayal of a family gone awry. Each character is whole and real, acting out their parts in a sick family, in which everyone is suffering. There are short moments of joy, but they are never shared by everyone, and the cloud of alcoholism, death, rejection and pain is ever present.

The hope in this film is that these family members continue moving forward trying to heal. The reality seems to be though, that after the end of the film, they will continue to hurt each other, feel misunderstood, and remain isolated with-in the family. Addiction is a disease that kills. Addiction never happens in a vacuum, and the parents of Kim and Rachel have played their toxic roles in shaping these two young women, and their lost son.

The father portrays the amorphous, co-dependent enabler, terrified that he will do the wrong thing, trying to be all things to all people, while alienating his whole family. He so wants to get it right and take care of everything, but his real motive is to selfishly avoid all conflict or unpleasant emotion.  The mother is cold, distant and hides her inability to form real relationships behind her work and 'busyness'. It is she who instigates the physical violence, while denying any responsibility for her children's neglect and her son's death.  Having worked with addicts and their families for many years, this portrayal of the sick family is real and painfully accurate.

The way that Kim approaches Step Nine, ""Made amends to all those we had harmed, except when to do so would injure them or others"", makes a mockery of the intention of this step. It is sad to believe that Kim had been in Rehab for nine months, and still had such a skewed view of this step.  Kim continues to go to meetings, and if she doesn't use or drink, she can experience the miracle of recovery too. At this point in her life, all that has changed for her is the clean urine test. I would hope that she and the family don't give up 5 minutes before their miracle happens. Jane Derry,",1238284800,2,2042,4.6115702479338845
3547530,2,B001E95ZNS,"As an addiction professional, watching this movie wasn't entertaining...it was WORK! The setting was a weekend pass from an institutional long term drug rehab to attend a family wedding. The movie accurately depicts the hurt, pain, caretaking, misunderstanding, self centeredness, brokeness, and general dysfunction of the entire family system. The family carries past hurts and lives out their dramas in spades through the intensity of coming together for a family wedding. The addict in early recovery role of Anne Hathaway demonstrates the negative impact of family entanglement on recovery. She also role models many behaviors to be avoided in recovery, and how not to 'work the steps'.
Do not expect a light comedy. There is nothing funny about addiction and its insidious and systematic destruction of family. If you want a glimpse of how families are negatively impacted by addiction, it's informative. If you are working a program of recovery and you need a reminder of pitfalls to avoid, it's a good reminder. If you are in early recovery, make sure you talk with your sponsor. There is a lot to be learned, but be careful to not make the same mistakes.

3547531,2,B001E95ZNS,"Ok, yes Hathaway did a good job with the character.  However, the movie was incredibly boring at times. 20 mins is spent on speeches at the rehearsal dinner.  Zzzzzz.  Who cares?  15 mins were spent on a dishwasher loading discussion.  Wow.  We got to watch each person at the reception dance, over and over.  The music was annoying.  The camera bounces constantly and zings back and forth from character to character making the movie feel like an amateur filmed it.

There are only moments in this movie that are ok.  Certainly not enough to make me buy it or see it again.",1238112000,8,574,4.53921568627451

This movie it's about a family trying to struggle against a tragedy that happened several years ago. And how the blame of that said tragedy lies on the shoulders of our lead character Kym, and how she seeks for attention and forgiveness the wrong way, which makes her create a catastrophe days before her sister's wedding.

This movie was written so beautifully and the way it was directed and acted make it one great journey into their world, very personal; it felt like you were just another guest feeling awkward because they were trying to fix their issues with you watching.

Last but not least, our leading lady; Anne Hathaway, God kid, way to blow people away; Anne was GREAT in this movie  and everything I hoped she would be given that when watching brokeback mountain there was many hints to future greatness.

I think she more than proved with Rachel Getting Married that she can be one of the great leading ladies of the next decade. That was not a simple performance. It was all kinds of layered, backstory suggestions, complicated mood constructions and quick wit.

Best performance of 2008 hands down; kid you got robbed this past Oscars.

I was expecting another family wedding story with maybe a little humor amidst the angst but I guess I should have known better just by looking at Anne Hathaway.  She looked like a refugee from a bad acid trip and was just about as appealing.  In fact, by the time I struggled through this conglomeration of unattractive characters of the rainbow coalition, melodramatic plot, dreadful and constant wailing, whining music and boringly Bohemian touches, I was ready to gag.  The wedding party (pre, post and during)scenes went on forever and the speeches were excrutiatingly boring, as were the people giving them.  This is a dismal film.

3547534,5,B001E95ZNS,"This is quite possibly my favorite movie of 2008. Directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Jenny Lumet (Yep that's Sidney Lumet's daughter), Rachel Getting Married is a triumphant film full of wonderful characters and performances. Anne Hathaway plays Kym, a troubled young girl returning home from rehab to attend the marriage of her sister Rachel. Kym is followed by a long history of personal tragedy which reemerges with her arrival. Demme chose to shoot the film using a handheld, home movie style which looks beautifully rich and believable (I don't agree with those saying its annoying. Its not shaky or anything, much like a documentary film, and much less distracting than the fast, over-cutting and 30 angles per shot of a movie like Slumdog Millionaire). The characters of Rachel Getting Married are highly entertaining in their own right and make for a fascinatingly diverse set of personalities. Its almost a joy to see the conflict between this family because the emotion feels so powerful and real. Much of this should be attributed to the magnificent performance given by Hathaway. It is rare that a viewer can so easily buy into character being played by such a well known actress. The supporting cast is equally fantastic as I never found myself thinking about acting or questioning the legitimacy of anyone on film. I accepted that what I was watching was a documentary of sorts about a real place and a real family. That is a very real accomplishment in this day of special effects and over budgeted Hollywood dribble. Rachel Getting Married is the kind of all around gorgeous and ultimately uplifting film that doesn't come around often but should be savored to the fullest when it appears.",1237939200,18,1712,4.947916666666667

But it failed miserably. Why were all those people making toasts at the rehearsal dinner? Hathaway's went on and on bringly and then other people got up said stuff. ENOUGH. The music and hoopla was annoying and the whole interracial thing just seemed odd and forced.

I saw Vicky Christina Barcelona the other night and wondered how Cruz could've won for best supporting actress because she was hardly in the movie that much. So when I sat down to watch Rachel Getting Married I was sure that perhaps Hathaway was robbed of the Oscar. Well, definitely NOT after watching this train wreck!",1237939200,5,759,4.622222222222222
3547536,5,B001E95ZNS,"I was hesitant to buy the movie.  I missed seeing it on the big screen.
Anne Hathaway was the main buzz about Rachel Getting Married, scoring an Academy Award nomination.  And I am a big fan of Ms. Hathaway.
As it turned out, Jonathan Demme's 'indie' movie was a huge and wonderful suprise.  And Hathaway turns in a great performance.  But it's not just her that is a relevation here - Rosemary DeWitt is her equal, as the title character, Rachel.
This slice of life story grew on me, finally totally enveloping me in it's world.
It's like listening to free form jazz...you aren't quiet sure where it's leading, but before too long, you find yourself tapping your foot to the rhythm, and marveling at the talent on display.  And it was purposeful on Demme's part, commenting that he wanted the movie to feel like we were listening to jazz.  It works completely.
The talent behind Rachel Getting Married is big studio talent - Anne Hathaway, Jonathan Demme, Jenny Lumet (screenwriter, and daughter of the great Sidney Lumet), Rosemary DeWitt, Bill Irwin.  Big studio talent that put a lot of love, and passion into this 'little' movie.

He succeeds on many levels...scenes with no point (lots of shots of the musicians that never stop playing...perhaps it is a running gag), scenes that go on for too long (rehearsal dinner scene), too many characters with whom one cannot make a connection (the ""happy couple"" had zero chemistry in my opinion), lots of handheld (intimacy and immediacy) shots like you are spying on everything.  To be sure, everyone does an excellent job of portraying someone in some stage of uncomfortableness (Hathaway excels as the consummate button pushing, attention demanding recovering addict).  As a result, the audience is uncomfortable most of the time.  If Demme had this in mind, then he succeeded in creating the ultimate home movie/documentary that everyone would go home talking about how pathetic and sad that family was...full of misery, sarcasm and self-pity.  Personally, it would take a lot of guts to show a home movie like this.  Which begs the question...why would you?  And can someone explain to me WHY a Hindu-style wedding?  Did I miss something?  And the seemingly acid trip induced post wedding dance with all the colors, sounds and cuts...interesting mixture of film styles, but certainly not indicative of a home movie.",1237852800,3,1298,5.056338028169014

Instead I was presented with a disjointed and formulaic clump of indyesque cinematic pablum. The stereotypes run amok in this multiculti trainwreck seemingly inspired by a stroll down the ethnic foods aisle at your local grocery store (what, no eskimos?!). Ms. Hathaway deserves  kudos for managing to piece together the only character with any semblance of believable back-story amongst the wafer-thin ensemble that rounds out this tedious drek.  Mr. Demme plays heavily on the hand camera motif to distract the audience from realizing how little is going on with the story.  The ""plot"" is a threaded together mishmash of forced sentimentality and pseudo-intellectual pedagogy regurgitated in a tepid, stoccato fashion. What is intended to endear instead ingratiates.

Made me wish I was part of this diverse group of people, it was just awesome to see.

For awhile I was bothered by some of the background information that was only hinted at about Kym's background but then I thought about it and decided to see the movie more as an atmospheric piece and in that sense it works, and it doesn't really matter what happened to Kym in the past, it's more about the present and her and her family getting over their past.

For being a rather serious and kind of sad movie, it left me feeling rather good, just getting a glimpse into these people's lives and meeting their group of friends and being their for Rachel's wedding.

I also really liked the special features, where the director talks about how the whole soundtrack was played live during the filming of the movie, how awesome is that!

3547545,1,B001E95ZNS,"Anne Hathaway turns in a remarkable performance. But Rachel Getting Married is one of the longest, most visually irritating movies I've seen in many years.

Some scenes (the wedding party toast scene, the after-wedding dance scene, and others) seemed to last an eternity. One, in fact (the after-wedding dancing scene) contained such bizarre colors, sounds, and quick-cut visual images that I felt nauseated. Literally.

On top of that, the movie tried so hard to offer up an assortment of rarely-seen, odd characters (black ones, white ones, Hindu ones, females, tall ones, short ones, hip musicians, Indians, drug addicts -- you name it), that the end result was absolutely implausible. And a visual nightmare. The wedding scene was so jam-packed with odd characters that it looked like the Mos Eisley Cantina scene from Star Wars.

Tell ya what, if I had a family like that, I'd have turned to drugs, too.

Nothing about Rachel Getting Married rang true, with the possible exception of Anne Hathaway's character. Despite what is obviously a nice piece of acting, I didn't really believe I wasn't seeing an actor, which may sound like an oxymoron. But consider the movie The Wrestler. Not once, with any character, did I think, ""I'm watching an actor play a role."" I never saw Mickey Rourke act for a second. I only saw Randy the Ram.

Anne Hathaway's character never became that real to me. She was too pretty, too well composed, too much the sane one amidst a bunch of loonies. Granted, that would drive anyone to a life of emotional imbalance. But I never believed Kym (Anne's character) actually existed. I always knew it was an actor playing a role.

Rachel Getting Married is a hodgepodge of sights and sounds, strange music, strange characters, and a talented actress in search of a cohesive script -- and in desperate need of an editor to trim the bloated scenes.

I wish I could recommend Rachel Getting Married. I love indie films, which are usually character-driven snapshots of life. Even though many elements of Rachel Getting Married smack of indie, the movie never rises above pretense, hokeyness, and unbelievability.

Unless you want to waste a couple hours of your life, I recommend you take a pass on this movie.",1237680000,24,2233,4.904509283819628
3547546,2,B001E95ZNS,"**1/2

Anne Hathaway comes into her own as a serious dramatic actress in ""Rachel Getting Married,"" a film by Jonathan Demme that is neither as compelling as its champions would argue nor as loathsome as its detractors might insist.

Hathaway plays Kym, a recovering drug addict who checks out of rehab to attend her sister's wedding back at the family homestead.  From the moment she hits town, this extraordinarily dysfunctional young woman manages to push the buttons of just about every single person she comes into contact with throughout the course of the weekend.

To give his film that special quality of you-are-there spontaneity, director Demme reaches for that most convenient and overused of stylistic devises - the peripatetic handheld camera that virtually every first-year film school student has employed as a shortcut to ""authenticity."" (TV's brilliant ""Friday Night Lights"" is probably the most conspicuous recent exception to that rule).  Even more problematic is the screenplay by Jenny Lumet, which, far too accurately perhaps, replicates the experience of being trapped at an actual wedding where you don't know a single soul and yet are forced to endure one boring, longwinded toast and reminiscence after another.

Unfortunately, in its treatment of the characters, the movie is often more smug and self-satisfied than it is illuminating.  Despite all the crying, hollering and high-pitched soul-baring that goes on at the gathering, we really don't learn all that much about Kym apart from the fact that she is insufferably self-absorbed and, thus, only truly happy when she is making herself the center of attention.  This leads to any number of tantrums and scenes that are as uncomfortable and embarrassing for the audience as they are for the other characters.  We would like to be able to care about her and the emotional turmoil she's going through, but the suffocating pretentiousness of the movie's ambience and style makes that next to impossible.  That's not to say that there isn't a touching moment here or a perceptive insight there, just that, as a whole, the movie is trying so hard to be clever and profound that it manages to turn its contrived artlessness into the very thing it is most desperately trying to avoid - artiness.  Thus, rather than seeming genuine and ""real,"" the whole event ironically winds up feeling manufactured and phony.

In fact, were it not for Hathaway's thoughtful and sensitive portrayal of a character who brings a whole new meaning to the term ""high maintenance,"" we'd probably leave the movie flat after the first fifteen minutes.  It is she and she alone who encourages us to hold on till the end.",1237507200,10,2669,5.066210045662101
3547547,3,B001E95ZNS,"Now there are some kind things to say about the movie ""Rachel Getting Married.""  First of all Anne Hathaway earned her Academy Award nomination as Kym, the drug addicted daughter/sister on a weekend furlough from a rehab clinic so she can attend her sister's wedding.  However, the nice surprise in the acting department comes from Debra Winger. Remember her?  She's has a small role as Kym and Rachel's mother, and it's not a flattering role, but it is well acted.

I also must say that Jonathon Demme creates an atmosphere of dread, guilt, great, and agony in what is supposed to be a happy occasion.

That being said ""Rachel Getting Married"", even though it is a well made film, is not an enjoyable one.  As stated earlier, Anne Hathaway plays Kym, a 20-something junkie who has been in and our of rehabilitation clinics since her teen years.  Kym is coming home to attend her sister's wedding and it's not pretty.

Kym is about Kym.  She, like most drug addicts, puts before everyone else despite the fact that the weekend is about Rachel, the bride to be.  Kym's not only addicted to drugs, she's addicted to attention and her behavior gets grating very quickly.  From having a tantrum for not being the lead bridesmaid to making a fool of herself at the rehearsal dinner by giving a self pitying speech to complaining how unfair it is when sister Rachel reveals some wonderful news, it's all ""me, me, me"" from Kym.

This movie may be worth watching once for the performances but it's not a keeper.  Certainly not a movie to watch more than once or twice.

3547549,2,B001E95ZNS,"""Rachel Getting Married""  features the Academy Award-nominated performance of Anne Hathaway as Kym, who returns from drug rehab for the wedding of her sister, Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt).  Kym's presence tears open old family wounds and creates tensions, resentments, and an uncomfortable atmosphere.  Although Hathaway is good, the film is a long slog through bickering, recriminations, overly dramatic pronouncements, and a collection of blankly smiling supporting characters that appear more like robots than real people.  With an abundance of loving smiles, sidelong glances, and awkward pauses, the whole undertaking seems more like an episode of ""One Life to Live"" than a feature film.
 Debra Winger as Kym and Rachel's divorced mother plays her role in a detached, underplayed style that resonates amid the hoopla of the wedding celebration.  DeWitt is effective as Rachel and is the most believable character in the movie.  Her irritation at Kym is balanced with sisterly affection that rings true.  Sometimes the ones closest to us can make us crazy.  The Blu-ray edition contains deleted scenes, filmmaker and cast commentaries, and a behind-the-scenes featurette.",1237420800,3,1172,5.576271186440678
3547550,3,B001E95ZNS,"This BD was watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 player. The picture is crisp, and sound is powerful, especially during the musical numbers, which ironically also provide a strange, ""happy"" contrast to the underlying ""repair"" occuring in Kim and everyone else's memory and present experiences of what has occurred.

Anne Hathaway's performance is a credit to her versatility. Stepping firmly out of her ""teen"" films, Anne Hathaway depicts a recovering addict's journey home, and the wasteland she left behind. There are many ""truths"" on this journey, and each character is confronted with each truth, when Kim returns home. There was a break in dealing with these demons and all of the associated hurt, while she was in rehab, and everyone was ""safe"" and in a comfortable place of ""denial"". She portrays this character's loneliness well, as she passes through the house, in a rambunctious and self-centered manner. But it is clear that even in the happiest scenes, she is deeply saddened, stalled and alone. Her addiction and struggle to rehab, and the forgiveness she needs threatens to overshadow her sister's happiness. This is a common occurrence in families where addiction is a centerpiece.

Some of the most touching moments are when Rachel is giving her sister a bath-almost like a baptism, a gesture of forgiveness, from a person whom she has so deeply hurt. The addiction has taken center stage for Kym, and has separated her from her family and their own happy moments.

The mother's character is symptomatic of the ways the family is dysfunctional. She is absent in her acceptance of Kym's addiction, and not there for her other daughter, during her own wedding. The film unfolds as a textbook case of the domino effect of addiction on families and relationships.

Unfortunately the style of the film, while likely meant to mimic real life in its lack of ""neatness"", never really shook the ""B"" movie feel for me. I have great appreciation of independent and ""out of the box"" films, but this one really never took off, despite all of the ramifications of the situation. Kym remains at the outskirts of her life, and while realistic, the characters and storylines are never really completely developed. This is often painful to watch, especially because all of the pain has overshadowed the ability of the two sisters to reconnect and express love for each other, when it counts the most.

For Anne Hathaway's performance, I'd give this film 5 stars, but for its execution a 3. If you are a fan of hers, it is definitely worth a look.",1237334400,,2550,4.907192575406032

Anne Hathaway is amazing as always playing Kym, Rachel's sister who is sprung from rehab to attend the wedding. She spends the entire movie crying out for attention and ruining her sisters wedding because she wants everyone to feel sorry for her and her addiction that ruined not only her life but the lives of everyone around her.

Here, after a short hiatus, he was asked to helm this little Indie project, and he succeeded again. It's a simple story about a wedding, and the various characters that are involved. There's no reason to go into the plot, because it's already been blabbed away by previous reviewers. I enjoyed Mr. Demme's choice to have music prevalent throughout, simple music by real players. DVD extras say a lot about this. Anne Hathaway is nothing short of magnificent in this difficult role, centered and with conviction. She succeeds brilliantly. Also fine are Rosemarie DeWitt and Debra Winger (so good to see her again). Demme was called by his friend, Sidney Lumet, about a script that his daughter wrote, and the rest is history. A fine, insightful script, sorely missing of an Oscar nomination. It's a downer of a story, but the music is used throughout not as an intrusion but as a chance to re-group. Demme brought out the best in an overall fine cast, and he should be commended for putting together this difficult story and making it presentable. Ms. Hathaway will certainly have future nominations. This was Winslet's year...regardless...",1237248000,,1271,5.0
3547553,1,B001E95ZNS,"Anne Hathaway does herself no credit whatsoever portraying the infinitely loathable Kym Buchman in ""Rachel Getting Married"".  A lifelong junkie whose been to rehab on numerous occasions, Kym gets a brief release in order to nearly destroy her elder sister's nuptials.

Rosemarie DeWitt brings one of the only sympathetic characters to the film as Rachel, whose life has been spent watching her self-destructive sibling's antics decmiate their family.  I had not noticed Ms. DeWitt's cruelly hawk-like porboscis so much in ""Mad Men"", but then the camera angles in ""R.G.M."" were rather unforgiving on just about every actor.

Effeminate father Paul (Bill Irwin, who's apparently a pioneer in contemporary American clowning---*cringe*) is remarried to Carol; delightfully distant mother, Abby (played beautifully by Debra Winger), is partnered with Andrew.  Abby has little time for her children, having attempted to move on from her dysfunctional original clan to new horizons with her second spouse.

The majority of the movie is taken up by Kym's monotonous monologues as to how no one understands the plight of the recovering junkie.  She makes an unlikely connection with Kieran (Mather Zickel), the best man at the wedding, although he can't rescue her from her obsessive need to destroy everything in her life.  Kym, who has spent a majority of the recent past either in rehab or prison, even demands that Rachel remove her best friend, Emma (Anisa George) as her maid of honor and give that position to her [Kym].  There is also a scene of mind-numbing discomfort when Kym delivers a lengthy ""toast"" at the rehearsal dinner, which quickly transmogrifies into yet another Kymmie Buchman Patented Self-Pitying Soliloquies About HOW HARD IT IS TO BE ME.

Sidney (Rachel's fiancee, then husband) is played by Tunde Adebimpe, the lead singer of the group  TV on the Radio (I liked his character, who was low-key and amusing).  The music in this film, however, is abysmal, with ridiculously extended scenes of very strange, sitar-driven orchestrations being danced to by bored-looking cast members.

The wedding itself is bizarre:  the Buchmans are Jewish and the Williamses are African-American but with no particular (or at least obvious) connection to Hinduism.  Yet the couple is married in a Hindu-esque environment (Indian music, the bride and her attendants wear saris, the wedding cake boasts a huge elephant...?!) that makes no sense whatsoever.

I couldn't have cared less about Kymmie Buchman and her angst-ridden plight of being hopelessly addicted to apparently every known amphetamine and barbituate in the world.  I did feel for Rachel, though:  a devoted and duty-driven daughter, yet forever cast aside in light of her sister's perpetual parade of drug-induced, self-loathing-riddled meltdowns.

A part of me really hoped Kym would overdose and die before the end; unfortunately that just didn't happen...

3547554,4,B001E95ZNS,"""Rachel Getting Married"" is director Jonathan Demme's first attempt at an ""independent film"", and I must say it is a self-conscious attempt, but the script by Jenny Lumet creates a strong lead character, realized by Anne Hathaway in an Oscar-nominated performance. Kym (Anne Hathaway) has been in and out of rehab for substance dependency for a decade. She gets a weekend hiatus from her current stint to attend her sister's wedding. So she arrives at her father's (Bill Irwin) Connecticut home, full of strangers who will take part in the Indian-themed wedding, wound up and on the defensive, ready to revel in the role of the family's black sheep. It doesn't take Kym long to pick a fight with sister Rachel (Rosemary DeWitt), and it looks like it will be a long weekend.

Jonathan Demme tried to cram everything he likes about independent films into one wedding weekend, and it shows. ""Rachel Getting Married"" is very talky, jumping from one tense conversation to another. The wedding guests might be the most eclectic group of people ever assembled in one room. The film is scored live by the musicians who are supposed to play at the wedding -and who rehearse in the background all weekend. And, well, rehearsal dinners and wedding festivities are as insufferable (and nearly as long) in this movie as they are in real life. But Kym is a strong character, and Anne Hathaway buries her own ego so that Kym's considerable flaws come through full force.

Kym is not one of the more sympathetic cinematic junkies I've seen. She's possessed of a forceful, unattractive personality. She's consumed with self-loathing for a terrible mistake in her past, and it has morphed into self-obsession and self-pity. She seems more addicted to being an addict than to the drugs. She embraces the role as both a self-flagellation and as anesthetic for the very pain she inflicts on herself. Kym is far too self-important to evoke my sympathy. But she has such a presence that I couldn't take my eyes off of her. Beyond the interminable wedding talk, ""Rachel Getting Married"" is difficult to watch because of the constantly moving camera that always draws attention to itself. But it is worth the trouble for Anne Hathaway's performance, as well as Debra Winger's small role as Kym's mother. And we do finally get to see the wedding.

3547556,3,B001E95ZNS,"I found the premise of this movie compelling but its execution was largely unsatisfying.  My biggest criticism was not the family dysfunction or petty squabbling, the shaky-cam (distracting and annoying), or even Anne Hathaway's behaving as a whiny, self-involved child demanding that the world revolve around her. It was the fact that the *real* story--of blame and the refusal to forgive, either oneself or another--was barely touched upon.  The bulk of the movie was spent on non-dramatic wedding festivities that did nothing to move the plot forward and was an unfortunate waste of screen time. (A wedding--like the birth of a child--is only thrilling to those directly involved.)

The film's finest moments occur during the scene directly after the rehearsal dinner--at which Kym makes an unconvincing and insipid public amends to her sister--when the real drama begins: the heated discussion exposing the worm at the rotten core that no one has been able to face.  The incendiary confrontation between Kym and her mom says it all, and the fact that it takes place this far into the movie points up to what this story could have been: a melancholy disquisition on the catastrophic chain of events set into motion by a family's tragic flaw: in this case, a mother's inability to love unconditionally, and more perhaps more disheartening, her refusal to forgive.  For those who might accuse me of reading something into this that wasn't meant, I found it interesting and highly significant that the wedding takes place at the father's house where the entire party is housed.  The mother comes late and leaves early to the arguably most important occasion of her daughter's life.  In every scene she appears like a cold, distant cousin rather than the mother of the bride.  And her treatment of Kym at the end of the wedding--as if she couldn't wait to get away from an offensive acquaintance who strained the limits of her civility--was the most devastating scene in the entire film.  It left me wondering who the real malevolent force was in this whole tragedy.

If Kym's initial behavior is childishly insufferable, her redemption comes when she implores her mother to tell her why, when she knew her daughter was a seriously disturbed drug addict, she would leave her 6-year-old son in her care.  Her mother's shocking and incriminating reply, and the terrify event that follows is the first sign that Kym is closer to understanding the bitter but liberating truth about life which is where the true heart of this movie beats: that we cannot make someone else forgive or love us, but we can forgive and love ourselves.",1236988800,3,2624,4.968036529680365
3547557,2,B001E95ZNS,"'Rachel Getting Married' is the story of Kym (played by Anne Hathaway), a dysfunctional ex-addict who returns home for her sister's wedding after receiving a weekend furlough from a rehab facility. The film is shot in the hand-held style of a 'you-are-there' documentary. Quite a bit of the dialog seems as if it was improvised.

The story unfolds slowly. We're introduced to Kym just as she returns home as the wedding preparations are under way. She's an emotional wreck, needy, angry and sometimes paranoid. She acts impulsively (immediately having sex with the groom's best man). Rachel has a 'tough love' attitude toward her sister and expects her to curtail her acting out behavior especially during the wedding festivities. Their father however is guilt-ridden over Kym's troubled past and can best be described as an 'enabler'; he argues with Rachel as he feels she's too hard on her sister. In a very long, drawn out scene, various guests toast the expectant bride and groom and Kym 'apologizes' for her past bad behavior to her sister; the speech comes off as nasty and self-indulgent which alienates Rachel's guests. The night before the wedding, Rachel and Kym's long-divorced mother (played by Debra Winger) shows up and she gets into an argument with Kym where they end up slapping each other. During this argument, a dark family secret is revealed: while high on drugs, Kym had a car accident years ago resulting in the death of their 10 year old brother.

Kym has her 'dark moment of the soul' after arguing with her mother. She gets in the family car and drives it into a wooded area and deliberately crashes it into a tree. The deployment of an air bag saves her from serious injury. She's escorted back to the house by the police where she pulls herself together enough to attend the actual wedding (since the bride and groom are an interracial couple, the merriment, including quite a bit of dancing and singing, has a decided multicultural flavor).

The day after the wedding, the mother leaves and bids Rachel a fond farewell. However, her goodbyes to Kym are much cooler and restrained. Kym's counselor picks her up to bring her back to the rehab facility where she will continue with her treatment.

The film's screenwriter, Jenny Lumet (yes you guessed it, daughter of director Sidney Lumet) tries so hard to make the principal characters sympathetic but ends up depicting them as neurotic and unlikeable. Lumet creates the cardinal sin of screen writing when her main character doesn't change throughout the story. Kym remains insufferably narcissistic and self-pitying. Either have your main character change for the better (e.g. Dorothy learning the lesson of 'home sweet home' in the Wizard of Oz) or tragically get worse and fail to learn the lesson he needs to (e.g. Al Pacino's 'shattered globe' at the end of 'Scarface', symbol of the illusory world he wished to conquer). Other neurotic one-note characters include the aforementioned father (the 'enabler'), the unforgiving mother, horny best man and petulant bridesmaid.

Rachel appears to be the most well-rounded of the characters in the film who has a strong enough ego to actually like herself. Sidney, the fianc&eacute; and subsequent groom, is nothing more than a smiling cipher. The rest of the guests are unknown entities, as the screenwriter chose not to develop them as multi-dimensional characters. The family members do a lot of toasting of one another but we never find out anything about them of any substance whatsoever.

To confess, I never thought of Jonathan Demme as one of the great directors of our era. And certainly this vanity project proves that he is not. And certainly Jenny Lumet is following in the footsteps of Sofia Coppola, a no-talent who has only succeeded in the movie business due to nepotism.

In the end, 'Rachel Getting Married' emulates the Robert Altman style of film-making--that's where you create neurotic (or in some cases unlikeable) straw men, shoot them down and then claim you're a great artist because you had the insight to see through the phony characters you created.",1236988800,10,4105,4.983941605839416
3547558,3,B001E95ZNS,"RACHEL GETTING MARRIED proved to be an entry card for Anne Hathaway's Oscar nomination, and while she turns in a strong performance, there is really very little else to recommend this film so unlike the work of Jonathan Demme. Written by Jenny Lumet,  the story of a dysfunctional family on the weekend of the marriage of daughter Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt) being upturned by the arrival of daughter Kym (Hathaway) on temporary leave from a rehab center and the clashes that occur from this planned happy event being replaced by the revelation of occult demons from the past is the nearly two hour noisy ennui that forms this film.

There are a few moments of interest (Kym's AA meeting revelations, the tragedy that drove Kym's mother -  adroitly played by Debra Winger - away in divorce, and the clash between Rachel and Kym), but the bulk of this film is noisy partying that goes on forever and adds very little to the tension that should have been the focus of the film.  For this viewer the performance (albeit brief) by Debra Winger is the reason to sit through this otherwise pretty boring film.

Disappointment does not begin to describe it.  This film was awful.  Everything about the direction and the horrible camera angles is true.  It was literally a pain to watch.  As also brought out, I could not even keep up with how many cultures they were trying to convey.  As for the storyline, there was little sympathy at all for Anne's character in spite of being so infused with personal guilt and pain she could have drained infection from her mouth with each word.  I was blown away that this lousy excuse for a movie was given such a build up.  Thank goodness I did not buy it, but rented it.  I am still tempted to write the director and demand my rental fee back on principle.  SKIP THIS ONE AND RUN!",1236902400,24,866,4.45859872611465

I think the problem is people (like me) didn't understand that this wasn't going to be a cheery wedding romp, but a downer of a story.
The dialogue is quite sharp with caustic wit.  The story is out-of-the-box and takes several leaps and sharp twist, which I found intrigueing.
Certainly, it's a story of deep anguish which not many can relate to (thankfully not me included), but I was definitely seized by the immediacy and compelling nature of the story.  Hatheway was brilliant and proved her acting chops to me.  Thumbs up.",1236902400,,600,4.805825242718447
3547562,1,B001E95ZNS,"I cannot understand the hype about this film.  I bought the DVD and I'm sorry I did.  It was a waste of money.

I've seen some bad movies in my day but this film has to rank among the top five worst. Please remember, this is just my opinion.

There is a clear lack of focus and direction here.  They shot the film with a hand held camera that makes one nauseous!!  It was all I could do to get through watching this mess.

The family scenes with everybody on the earth as ""extras"" were completely distracting.....the screeplay has absolutely no substance due to the lack of good direction, probably.

There are a few good things in this....very few.  One being Debra Winger's performance and scenes with Anne Hathaway.  Another being that it was 113 minutes long and not longer...who could take more of this muddled mess?????

And as far as Anne Hathaway???  Believe me, I like Anne Hathaway (absolutely loved her in ""Prada"" and ""Brokeback Mtn"".)  But another over-hyped performance and an annoying one at that! Shes not totally inept, but she has done better; thus, I cannot justify her Oscar nomination.

If you want to see a film shot like a home movie with a camcorder, with dozens of people spouting off dialogue that is hard to understand and all the background noises you can think of added in.....with a lot of cussing and profanity....as well as stupid sequences like the father and the groom in a dishwasher loading contest....(ugggh!!!!).....then this is the movie for you.

As for me, I'm taking this DVD to the ""Used DVD"" place to trade in for a film that's worth watching.  This one is just not my cup of tea and for those whose it is...more power to you....enjoy!!",1236816000,11,1679,4.602693602693603
3547563,4,B001E95ZNS,"Kym (Anne Hathaway) gets out of rehab and goes directly to her sister's Rachel wedding. Kym is a major mess who has spent her life inflicting pain on her family, including her little brother Ethan who drowns in his car seat after Kym drives him off a bridge when she is high.

Rachel Getting Married is TOO good drama in that you feel like you are standing in someone's living room listening to their fight. The director lets the conflict in this film boil over and fester and the viewer is left in the clouded soup. The problem with a film like this is that unless you find the protagonist relatable you don't want to be around her. What you'd really like to do is politely leave that living room-which is exactly what Kym's mother does. Kym's family reconciles with her to a certain degree because they are her family, but the script writer failed to realize that viewers are not family. We don't love Kym and have no reason to want to hang out with this mess.

The film looks like it was shot with a handheld camera  which intensifies the intimate feel, but does nothing for the viewers irritation level. Some scenes are long and grindingly tedious. Again, it makes you feel like you are right in on the action, but it gets boring.

Emotionally draining without resolution, Rachel Getting Married is like a sophisticated Jerry Springer episode without the laughs but all of the horrible human tragedy. Excellent acting, gorgeously scenery, but tedious. I wouldn't dismiss it entirely, but it wasn't one of my favorites.

I'd recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Margot-At-the-Wedding-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B001IYE8TQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Margot At the Wedding : Widescreen Edition</a>&nbsp;which does a much better job of addressing the way a narcissistic character interacts with her family. It too is intense, but it's filled with enough lightness that  you can tolerate the journey.",1236816000,2,1942,5.228295819935691
3547564,4,B001E95ZNS,"At the core of `Rachel Getting Married' is a beautifully rough portrait of family interactions and the bitter sweet reunion that comes when we all just can't seem to get along.  I feel almost torn in my review here because the more I think about the film the more I realize that it hits so close to home it's not even funny.  The character descriptions here feel like portraits out of my own photo album; from the rehab frequenting sister to the heartbroken father trying to protect the ones he loves to the jilted sibling trying to enjoy their turn in the spotlight.

Oh god, does that make me Rachel?

Okay, so all bias aside (I tend to find a warm spot for films that I can relate to) this is not a perfect film and so I can't treat it as such.  Like I said, at its core it is pure and beautiful; but the outskirts of the film could have used some trimming.

First, as an overview, I'll reign in on the films subject.  Kym is the dysfunctional family member who is taking a leave from rehab to attend her sisters wedding.  She's been sober for nine months, but the pain of seeing her family again and that feeling of isolated outcasting may very well send her back into using.  She has a lot of baggage to overcome and the problem is that this is her sister's moment and she can't help but steal it.  Her father is overly concerned, her mother isn't concerned enough and her sister is surrounded by people (not to mention memories) that make it hard for her to sympathize.  She feuds with everyone and creates more drama than necessary because its hard for her to confront the fact that this isn't about her.

I know this girl all too well.

It's funny because as I watch `Rachel Getting Married' I tend to side with Kym and secretly plead for everyone around her to cut her some slack, and then I realize that I am the male equivalent to Rachel and wholeheartedly understand when she utters the words ""I hate her"".  I get it; I've been there.  Watching Paul (their father) struggle to find that balance between caring for his `good' daughter and defending his `delinquent' daughter was like staring at my father as he tried to convince me my very own sister was `changing'.  It was such a reality check to watch him crumble and realize that my very own father went through that (and still does).

My only issue with this film is that it spends a lot of time on trivial issues.  The whole first section of the film takes a bit to get started, with the speeches that drag on and on, one after the other.  I see the connection to Kym's therapy meeting (I don't know if that was intentional, but I felt it was) but there came a point where I was like ""give Kym the mic, let her ruin everything, lets move on"".  After that scene (and actually during Kym's awkwardly amazing speech) the film picks up and keeps moving at a splendid pace until the wedding nuptials are over and the musical sequences begin, and keep going.  Again, it was just too much of something that wasn't important.

That said, when it hits it right it does it wonderfully; with a fully realized script complete with stellar character development (amongst the main family members that is) and some sublime performances.  Anne Hathaway is beyond brilliant as the confused and conflicted Kym.  I was so proud of her ability to evoke our sympathies without ever manipulating them.  We see every flaw she possesses and she has no qualms about exposing them to us.  She makes us love Kym regardless of how unlovable she is.  Rosemarie DeWitt is the epitamy of marvelous as Rachel, balancing out her unwavering love with her earned selfishness.  This is her day, her moment and she deserves to have all the attention.  Debra Winger has a stellar cameo (I just LOVE this woman) and the passion she bleeds into her scenes is undeniable.  Personally, I think best in show honors should go to Bill Irwin, who just nails Paul.  He captures every ounce of the pain and suffering that comes from being a parent.

I'm not saying children are a curse, but love is the most painful feeling known to man.

I do wish that we would have been able to know Kieran (a surprisingly warm and gentle Mather Zickel) and especially Sidney, Rachel's fianc; but the films primary focus is Kym adjustment to her family's conception of her, and with that as a focus the film excels.  So, I do highly recommend this movie.  It can be hard to take at times, especially if your family is dysfunctional, but it is worth the ride.",1236729600,,4463,4.454433497536946
3547565,3,B001E95ZNS,"I was excited to see this movie and view Anne's much talked about performance. Overall, I felt the entire cast delivered very strong performances, which is why I rated this film three stars.

I think my movie tastes are pretty eclectic- I sure watch my fair share from foreign to action adventure and everything in between. I think where this movie falls short is that it tries to be more than it is. I would categorize this film as a short story, not a fully developed movie. In comparison to other movies centered around strongly portrayed wounded female characters, like Charlize in Monster or Swank in Boys Don't Cry, Rachel Getting Married just does not measure up.

The entire movie is filmed documentary style with herky-jerky camera movement that I felt was so distracting that it disconnected me from the characters. I was constantly being reminded that I was watching a movie. I understand the choice in film style it just was not well executed. Too much artsy, too much contrasting music, too many contrasting themes, too much camera movement, and not enough story.

Bottom line, if you feel like watching a very well done home movie about a very believable family in crisis 'celebrating', then this movie is for you.

P.S. For a movie that was too much so many things, the opening credits were extremely boring and long.",1236729600,,1332,4.778260869565218
3547566,5,B001E95ZNS,It's a beautiful film about a recovering addict trying to figure out exactly where up is. Kym is a former model currently in rehab. She has been let out due to her older sister Rachel's upcoming marriage. During this happy time there are many family secrets that begin to surface and bring up the long lasting tension. I love this movie so much. It was definitely one of the best films in 2008. It's so different from what we normally see from Anne. I especially love how the film was shot in a documentary naturalistic style. It was very unique and appropriate for the mood and setting of the movie. The whole entire cast was wonderful.

3547568,3,B001E95ZNS,"Anne Hathaway is great, Debra Winger, too...and newcomer Rosemarie DeWitt, playing two sisters and their estranged mother. I wish Winger's role were larger, meatier, but good to see her again. One of the best American actresses.

This is a film to see if you not only tolerate well, but actually like, such wacky, highly educated, freewheeling and wild Connecticut families with multi-ethnic friends and eclectic tastes. Filled with fine world music, the film wraps itself in color and light, and the music flows with it all the way.

At the core is Rachel's sister Kym, home for the wedding, from rehab, and a mess of self-focus and pain. No one knows how to approach her.

In essence, this Demme film is about a searing family tragedy that's not been discussed, so as to clean all the hearts. Tragedies or secrets in families create wounds and scars that never heal. But they can be addressed, given fresh air, and treated with emotional ointments that allow all family members to begin to move forward.

The scene of bride-to-be Rachel bathing her emotionally broken sister so lovingly is beautiful. Love and forgiveness set the tone. There is not a family on earth that can't relate to some part of both the horrifying family tragedy and the blooming redemption that come as a ghostly guest to Rachel's wedding.",1236124800,,1315,4.857142857142857
3547569,5,B001E95ZNS,"Directed with utter carefree treatment and lack of pretension, but no less very candid, revelatory and sensitive, by Jonathan Demme, ""Rachel Getting Married"" is not what you expect from reading its plot summary. This is melodrama disguised as a documentary about a very cool reception party of an interracial wedding, or vice-versa. However one sees it, the film is cerebral and deconstructive by its refusal to be lumped under one category, and it is through that refusal that it greatly succeeds. It is not so much as a domestic drama as a celebration of a beautiful union, and not so much as an multicultural party with great music where everyone is invited to as about a family that is quietly trying to move on from a horrible tragedy. However one sees it, this is a film about people, projecting them in a non-judgmental manner and exploring their issues through moments that are not inherently sad, but ironically moments that are joyous and innocuous, at least on the surface. Anne Hathaway's performance is pure and unadulterated, boiling with rage, shame, and guilt under her rebellious and self-absorbed character, Kim. Great tragic drama that does not brood and sulk, this one sings and dance like no other.",1235952000,,1219,4.951219512195122

However, if you're one who is into character driven films then this one is for you.  Anne Hathaway gives the best performance of her career.  She fully embraces not playing the normal pretty girl roles that she is usually offered, instead she portrays Kym, a troubled woman who leaves rehab to attend her sister's wedding.
The film is shot in an almost documentary-style way which gives it a very raw look.  I loved the film and the performances and applaud the cast and crew for this original film.
Anne Hathaway proves she is more than just another pretty actress, I see a long career for her and while she didn't get an Oscar for this role, there's no doubt in my mind that she'll eventually bring an Academy Award home.",1235865600,3,881,4.515723270440252
3547571,1,B001E95ZNS,"What I am trying to say is that Anne Hathaway is a likeable actress.

HOLLYWOOD TODAY:  READ It's important that Americans need to be AWARE of these notes.

 I'm just saying that Hollywood is getting these good looking people to star in their movies. The next generation of people coming up are going to ruin the acting business because look at all these model actresses. They can't act worth a penny!!! It's the truth. Look at the comedies being made now a days and all these action thrillers that don`t show one`s acting ability. The comedies are being made for idiots like the movies, Clueless, He's just not in to you, confessions of a Shopahollic, Bridewars, fired up, etc. Now older movies like 70's and 80's were good. EXCELLENT. You know why? There actors were awesome and they all had a GOOD STORY, but today it is rare to find a good story in the Cinemas. They didn't worry about what you looked like back then. To tell you the truth, European movies are much better than American movies today. There child actors and adult actors are better and there are more of them over seas. They get better acting TRAINING. They have good stories. There comedies are better. Though Angelina Jolie is a superb actress and has good looks. Films are being filmed how society is like. Technology is advancing and treatments to look good is posted everywhere.

BACK TO ANNE HATHAWAY

 Now Meryl Streep, Helen Mirren, Cate Blanchett, Glen Close, Holy Hunter all have a qwurky look. They are not necassarily the model type. Anne Hathaway has a gorgeous look, but is not an outstanding actress. Sure, she cried in a few scenes, but it wasn't the real emotion, it was fake. Anne Hathaway is a likable PERSON AND ACTRESS like Drew Barrymore, Jennafer Anderson, Kristen Stewart, etc. She doesn't have the realness in her eyes. She doesn't have any qwarkes that make her stand out which is something like PRESENCE an actor should always have. You either have it or you don't. Like singing too. You have to stand out, its being Believable and you have to be interesting and of course great! Anne is also very monatone. It is true. I am 14 years old and I know what I am talking about.

You know your discretionary time has been squandered when the most interesting scene in a movie is a 10 minute segment of competitive dishwasher loading.  Since that interlude was culled from the personal life of the screenwriter (Jenny Lumet) one has to speculate on how far the supposedly creative community has sunk.

What we have here is dysfunction melded with stultification, the former exemplified by every member -past, present and potential  - of this Stamford, Connecticut clan: the reluctantly indulgent titular Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt), Kym (Anne Hathaway) the chemically dependent rehab patient sister on a weekend pass, Paul (Bill Irwin) the enabler father, Abby (Debra Winger) the emotionally distant ex-wife and mother, and let's not overlook Carol (Anna Deveare Smith) stepmom and consummate peripheral observer. If that wasn't enough, throw in the groom Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe), who had all the acting range of a guy who knows where the casting director's skeletons are buried and your journey down the highway to personal regret is in fifth gear.

The film seemed like an andro inflated homage to multiculturalism. If the director or screenwriter had thought of including a scene or two at the Mohegan Casino, no one would have been left out. But, that may have been interesting and in total contrast to the stupefying pall that permeated the film. Jonathan Demme decided to film with a hand-held camera to give it a video journal feel and he succeeded. If you have ever been held hostage obligated to politely watch a friend's home videos, the scenes of the rehearsal dinner might drive you into flashback epileptic seizures.

3547577,5,B001E95ZNS,"What an unexpectedly good film!  The title, ""Rachel Getting Married"", gave me expectations of some girlie film about marriage, etc.  How could I have been more wrong?  Rather than a formulaic chick flick, I got a gritty low budget film about a recovering drug addict dealing again with her family and the fact that her sister is marrying and Kym (the addict) will be a bridesmaid.

Anne Hathaway plays the role of the recovering junkie dealing with her demons.  Yet, Hathaway doesn't steal the show.  There is a large cast of relatively unknown actors who each play wonderful roles.  The drama is extremely plausible as are the characters.  As to plot, there really isn't much.  We are simply left as almost voyeurs to the complex interactions between the various family members.  And it is certainly fascinating interaction.

One small note is that the film has a home movie type feel.  At first, this can prove to be distracting.  However, as the film progressed it became less of an issue and, indeed, added to the overall resonance of the production.  It made the feel seem more real and less of a glossy Hollywood production that although nice on the eye fails to have cred.  Overall, it was a strong plus point for the production.

4. What the heck's up with the bridegroom (Tunde Adebimpe) and those gawd-awful glasses?  I know we're trying for ""regular"" people here, but no self-respecting brother's gonna be caught dead in those things. (And couldn't they have found an actor with a personality?)

7. ... and the multi-cultural, eclectic choice of wedding music, speaking of which ...
8. ... expect grating and annoying music for most of the movie,
9. which is shot with hand held cameras to look like an amateur home movie, and succeeds totally in looking amateur.

You know you're in trouble when one of the high points of a movie involves two men in a dishwasher loading competition that's really a long excuse for a plot device.

This movie takes the story of a young woman who has been in rehab for most of her life, and who is suffering from terrible guilt over an incident in her past, and instead of capitalizing on her struggle to lead a normal life, they water it down with over-the-top multi-cultural trappings, and bad home video.

Hathaway truly shines, given the script she's been dealt, and is the only reason to watch this movie, except for a memorable scene with Deborah Winger, who plays the girls' estranged mother.

Recommended for fans of world music, other people's home videos, wedding speeches and the scientific art of dishwasher loading.

Everything seems to have been planned without her and sparks fly as a variety of family relationships (her parents have remarried; her brother died as a youngster) come under strain.

Hathaway is superb in the the central role (I particularly enjoyed her scenes with Debra Winger as her mother), seeming to channel Winona Rider at her best. And overall this is a masterpiece of ensemble acting, almost faultless. But there are one or two dud scenes and a big puzzle for me was how underwritten the part of Rachel's husband is. He hardly says a word for the first part of the movie and as a result there is zero chemistry between him and his bride and him and his best man.

Despite the caliber of the cast, some of the plot defies logic. Rachel says to her father, can I talk to you in the kitchen? and the whole party follows them (including a balalaika player) for their ""private"" conversation.

Such strangeness threatens to sink what is otherwise an assured example of the tricky genre of romantic drama/recovery story. As someone in the audience next to me said, ""This is one weird (and very long) wedding.""",1233532800,,1224,4.657407407407407

I could not believe this movie has been touted as so exceptional. There were some clever scenes but few and far between.
We have seen this before- 20 something screwed up misunderstood waif with a heart of gold who does not take any responsibility for herself ..oh yes she is in rehab but merely uses it as an excuse for more pity. Ann Hathaway was OK, certainly better in this than she was in Brokeback Mountain or that horrid Prada movie, but this seems to be the kind of part pretty actresses get raves over- smoke, sulk, have bad hair and smeary makeup, and act out for attention. I do not think it is Oscar worthy but she is the It Girl of the Moment and will probably get the award.
Had there been more meat to the story and less blabbering toasts and scenes of partying guests dancing, had the great and underused Debra Winger been able to actually have a stronger role in this movie, especially since she was the pivotal cause of Kym's ( Ann Hathaway) pain, it would have been interesting.  The father was featured way more than necessary... he was a super co dependent which was hammered in over and over. Yea, I got it. After learning about the dad, I wanted to know more about the Debra Winger character especially given that she was so important a factor  I would have loved more scenes with her and actually less scenes with the bride Rachel.
Also, whenever Debra Winger was on the screen, man, her charisma and star power is still there, I swear! Hollywood, give that woman another movie to star in would you!?
The great stage actress Anna Devere Smith should have been given more to do than smile or get teary eyed, there could have been some deeper scenes with her, how she was fitting into this family, but we did not get deeper with her either. This was a movie that didn't know what it wanted to say beyond the cliches. And a movie that needed a lot of pruning and editing!
I will say it was fantastic to see a movie with a multicultural cast, although they were each so earnest and artsy I got the feeling the Lumet and Demme families had gathered up all their indie friends to party. Good music.
The movie  had that naturalistic style so many movies from the 70s had, I wondered if writer Jenny Lumet's dad's influenced her ( Her dad is the great Sidney Lumet, which also had me wondering if that was how such a self indulgent script got made into a movie).
A huge plus was the cinematography, each scene was completely beautiful, I will say. A visual treat. I did not know beforehand about the handheld camera work and for some reason, I did not get nauseous or dizzy, it really did not bother me, in fact I did like it-The sets were exceptionally captivating. The scenery , the houses were lovely, Connecticut looked magical. Even the gosh-awful toasts and party scenes were made watchable by the cinematography. The wedding cake was spectacular.

If she loves her daughters so much why leave the wedding first?  why come to the rehearsal dinner late? She seems to be a woman who will only give so much of herself as a mother and a wife to tragic results [revealed three-quarters of the way in the film].  Were there cut scenes with Winger?  She deserved an Oscar nom more than Hathaway.

3547583,5,B001E95ZNS,"After years of low radar documentary films, Jonathan Demme, teamed up with the daughter of Sydney Lumet, offer up this very well written and evenly balanced family drama, anchored down by some pretty great performences.

The main character of the film is recovering addict Kym, who has just been recently released from rehab to attend her sisters wedding, the title's own Rachel. Upon her arrival, it becomes immediatly obvious she is the 'black sheep' of the family and her presence stirs up a lot of tension that has been brewing in the house for years.

Talent definintly runs in the family, with Jenny Lumet crafting a very balanced screenplay that is able to be both funny and dramtic without teetering to over the edge of overdone drama and lame laughs. Demme also does a fine job directing, offering up his best film since Silence of the Lambs. If there is one critism that I can point out is that the director does seem to over indulge in certain scenes, most specifically the dinner toasts and wedding reception. But those are only minor when looking at the film as a whole.

Every performence is great, with the most obvious stand out being Anne Hathaway. Unlike everyone else, I have known for a long time that she could do a character like this. After her role in the exceptionally great Brokeback Mountain, it was only a matter of time till she burst out and became a full fledged serious actress. With razor sharp humor, jet black hair, and an almost broken down demure, she is one of the few actresses out of the whole year to dissapear into a role, where instead of saying ""oh look, its Anne Hathaway being a drug addict"", you say ""oh look, its a drug addict"". One hundred and ten percent yes that she got that Oscar nom. All thats left is for her to take it.

What was the point of having the son-in-law look and act like an African dignitary although he was supposed to be a regular African American guy?  The shots of the ""wedding"" were way too long and just not believable.  I felt bad for the actors who had to play this charade and try hard to make it look real.

From another point of view - these flaws actually made the movie somewhat fun to watch because I (and other members of the audience) had to laugh out loud during some of the more obnoxious scenes.  But I don't think this was the intention of the filmmaker.

Anne Hathaway is doing a decent job initially, but unfortunately her character remains very one-dimensional throughout the movie.  In addition, the story becomes muddled by nauseating ""look at this liberal family in this important movie"" scenes that appear to drag on forever.

If you want a good laugh at a bad movie that is trying very hard to look like Awards material - watch this mess.  Otherwise I strongly suggest to stay far away from this.",1232409600,11,1190,4.650717703349282

3547590,5,B001E95ZNS,"An illuminating sadness punctuates the pauses of a festive worldly gathering in Jonathan Demme's ""Rachel Getting Married"", a cinematic tour-De-force that throws itself into the Oscar game from far left field. It's the best and most fulfilling film I've seen at the movies this year so far.

The plot is simple. Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt), the oldest, most idolesque of the children in her family, is getting married. For the occasion her troubled younger sister Kym (Anne Hathaway) is given a weekend pass from rehab to attend the ceremony. Rachel and Kym, a former model and certified drama queen, tackle and tumble for the spotlight, only to reopen deep wounds and a tragic family history.

I know, your probably going ""I've seen it before. It was only last year. But it was called ""Margot At the Wedding"", and it really wasn't all that good!"" And you might be right about obvious plot similarities, but you'd be neglecting one fact that excludes every like minded movie done before it: this is unmistakably a Demme picture.

After a decade spent swimming around mostly in music documentaries (""Heart of Gold"", ""Storefront Hitchcock""), Demme marries his on-the-fly live-concert approach with the sharp focus on human character that's been the bold definition of his work since ""Melvin and Howard"". Scenes grab for melancholy and laughs in the same breath. Music is a counterpoint to Kym's downward spiral, and Oscar nominated legends like Debra Winger share the screen with old Demme buddies Robyn Hitchcock, Sister Carol East, and Tunde Adebimpe from TV on The Radio.

Like ""Beloved"", ""Silence of The Lambs"", and ""Philadelphia"", this film is a veritable acting powerhouse. Everything you've heard about Anne Hathaway's performance as Kym is true. Her well-crafted train wreck is heading straight for an Oscar nomination. Although Winger's screen time is short, her performance as Kym's mother, a woman grown frozen with rage and denial, deserves a supporting nom, just for a baity cat-fight scene with Hathaway alone. She brings an epic fiery resentment to the picture at just the right moment, and her aged-sexiness make her totally believable as this girl's mother.

But the film's biggest surprises are the unknowns: TV actress DeWitt and stage actor Bill Irwin, as Kym's sensitive father Paul. Both deliver subtle work, steady ballasts to the volatility of mother and black-sheep daughter. DeWitt is superb as the sibling who is willing to overlook the past if her sister might be simply willing to concede for a day (in more ways than one). Irwin is the man who's seemingly recovered, with a beautiful new wife and a home that seems to bristle with unrelenting life, but who still keeps artifacts of the dead unconsciously in full view. A scene between Irwin and Tunde, in which they have a competition to load a dishwasher (!)could be the film's most exciting and devastating moment.

Visually, ""Rachel Getting Married"" is unlike any Demme film seen before. Working with Jim Sheridan's verite'-trained cinematographer Declann Quinn, Demme constructs an intimately beautiful home video tapestry akin to the Dogme staples ""Breaking The Waves"" and ""The Celebration"", as much to the films of Robert Altman. Conversations bob and weave into one another in a sort of gritty poetic-realism where sunlight dances with unwanted shadow. And it's the most vibrant film of the year....the music never stops, as Rachel's wedding practically becomes the Jonathan Demme curated Summer Music Fest. (and we're all invited!).

Lastly, we must not forget the film's most sly, important and (seemingly) invisible element, Jenny Lumet's original screenplay. A vital new talent has been born folks, as the woman is blessed with the ear of everyday dialogue and the intrigue and nuance that underlays it. The acting is spectacular, but this script is so strong that I could envision say Natalie Portman and Elizabeth Reaser in the Kym and Rachel roles, and this film might still have equal power. It's just that good.

For my best picture of 2008, this one will be very, very hard to beat. See it while you can!

3547591,1,B001E95ZNS,"I am mystified by all the positive buzz this movie is getting.  It's rare for me to walk out on a movie but I was incredibly antsy watching the film and finally left with still 30 minutes left.  I was not antsy about the subject matter but because of the incredibly bad script, slow pace,  boring directing and editing.  The ""toast scene during the rehearsal wedding"" is a perfect example.  First we're treated to long boring toasts from miscellaneous characters that tell us little about the characters nor help bring the plot forward; you'd think this would be over after Anna Hathaway/Kym gives her longish/embarassing toast BUT NO, a few more miscellaneous guests give a few more speeches.  Then there is the scene where the father and groom have a competition to load the dishwasher... riveting drama for sure.

By the time the actual wedding ceremony occurred I was over the edge.  Have you ever been to an event where someone who can't sing very well insists on singed an entire song?  The groom decided to sign his vows and after each stanza I hoped he would be over but no... he sings the entire song.  I was like watch a video of a bad wedding you wish you did not attend let alone have to watch.

Most of the other plot points seemed contrived.  And i laughed when Anna punches an Oscar nomited actress in the third act.  And the Hindu theme of the wedding was never explained and seems like they included it just to be different or counter-culture.

Don't waste your time or money.

I don't mean to belittle Anna Hathaway herself.  I liked her on other movie but I think she's only getting the Oscar buzz because, like a long list of actors before he, she's playing an addict.",1229299200,14,1688,4.521452145214521

3547593,1,B001E95ZNS,"The hand held camera work was so overdone that the two of us got physically nauseated. This was unnecessary and frankly I felt I was being manipulated into feeling, ""you dummy, in case you don't get it this film is being artistic."" But it was faux artistic. Bergman or any good director could have made his points without nauseating his audience.

There were nice bits of world music in the background, but they wove into the emotional chaos and camera jiggles in ways such that I could not even enjoy them and they became simply annoying noise in a way. I think that added to the nausea.

So much for cinematic techniques from decades past that were overdone and not well done. How about the acting? Well my friend and I disagreed mildly. I thought it was often okay, my friend thought it was clumsy and mostly only made an impression because the emotional carnage was intense, not because there was much subtly.

How about the story itself? Dysfunctional liberal Jewish family joining with a black family and all hell breaks loose? Well all sorts of families can be dysfunctional. The strong play-up of the ethnicity of the characters did not seem essential to the story. It was a sort of cheap hook that did give atmosphere but that ended up being more a distraction than informative. Again, plenty of distractions here -- hand held camera, noisy background, ethnicity. Where is the meat? Another film about dysfunctional families and personalities.

Did we learn anything new about dysfunctional families? Some people can't get enough, and it is not bad to be reminded how messed up families can get, and how a lot of c@&%p can rise to the surface during holidays and family celebrations. Yes indeed it can! Some people do need examples to help remind them of this. Maybe this was the target audience.

Much of the emotional blood and guts did ring true, but it seemed overdone. This is not to say false exactly, but in the sense of ""if you did not get it in the last scene, I will hold your nose in it in another and another and another."" Some would say ""powerful"" but I would say ""nothing subtle.""

I guess I think that the first few films that I saw that dealt with dysfunction, drugs, etc were useful, regardless of their quality. Maybe in fairness I have just seen too many and need to see some new angle to not be bored by these time honored themes.

But in my considered opinion these themes have been and can be developed much better artistically in terms of story line, and certainly in terms of film technique. But hey! -- we are all different. I am the 6th reviewer and this film did get through to the previous 5 with high marks. I also saw 20 some positive reviews on the internet before I watched this film. Maybe this is all new for a lot of people and this film can help them to think about it. What can I say?

All I can say is that if you are one who gets sea-sick easily then be warned and take Dramamine if you are determined to watch this. If you admire the ways in which directors like Bergman, Preminger, Wilder, Lumet, Allen, or hey any number of directors have dealt with dysfunctions and addictions and recovery attempts and family events turned into carnage then be warned that this film may not add much new to these topics.

If I have warned you off of this film, well don't be sad. There are a lot of really good art films out there, as well as very entertaining cheap comedies and horror films and even many ""mainstream Hollywood films."" And if dysfunction is your thing just Google something like ""alcoholism in film"" or etc. and I think you can pick out a lot of interesting films that will not make you sea-sick and that are not cluttered and pseudo-artsy.",1226102400,15,3694,4.501492537313433
3547594,4,B001E95ZNS,"Kym (Anne Hathaway) is getting out of a lengthy stint in rehab, just in time to join up with her family, as they gather at her father's house for the wedding of older sister Rachel (Rosemarie deWitt, from MAD MEN).  Kym is angry, paranoid, nervous and worst of all, feels resentful if she is not the constant center of attention, which is tough on her because it IS her sister who is getting married, not her.  Dad (Bill Irwin) works hard to keep Kym happy, and away from the keys to the family car.  Rachel enjoys seeing her sister again for a short time...but eventually Kym becomes a toxic, demanding presence.  You can't help but feel bad for Rachel, who is having her wedding nearly ruined.

Jonathan Demme's film is half scenes of large groups of friends and family enjoying wide varieties of live music, because apparently they are just all so great loved by everyone who plays music.  While Rachel's fianc Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe, member of the band TV on The Radio) is a musician, we also see no clear reason why the rehearsal dinner, the wedding and the reception is just PACKED full of a motley crew of musicians and musical styles.  Some of the music is actually very good...and sometimes I was reminded of John Cleese's character in an old Monty Python sketch in which he finally screams ""Shut that bloody bouzouki UP!!!""  The music is non-stop.  In fact, the entire logistics of the wedding feel unreal.  The rehearsal dinner features one fantastically delivered toast after another.  This young couple's friends are just a little TOO sincere, TOO loving, TOO wise and TOO witty.  They laugh, hug, squeeze, smile and tear-up up almost constantly.  It's exhausting to watch in a way, especially with all the hand-held, digital video camera work.

Those are the primary things I dislike about the film.  But the other half simmers with well-written angst and fury.  First and foremost is Hathaway's Kym...one seriously messed-up person.  For about half the film, I well and truly hated her.  She gives a speech at the rehearsal that tops any other squirm inducing speech ever given in a film.  Kym is trying to pretend she wants to give a nice toast to her sister, but her anger and resentment is what really spews out...all over the uncomfortable guests.  I honestly thought I was going to end up hating the film for giving us a ""hero"" who was so unrepentantly nasty.  But we do finally get to see some family secrets that make Kym more understandable.  While she doesn't rise to the level of sympathy, exactly...we do see the decent human being who once dwelt in Kym's place.

Hathaway is matched by the nearly unknown Rosemarie DeWitt.  As Rachel, she is frothing with excitement over her marriage, but seething with anger over her sister.  Not just at the horrible manner in which sis acts, but they have long-term issues because Kym was always the one who got all the attention, while Rachel behaved herself and was ignored.

There are a handful of truly spectacular fight scenes between Kym, Rachel and their father that may be better written than ""normal"" people would speak, but nonetheless the reek of truthfulness.  They are raw and powerful, and for a change, the hand-held camera work actually helps the film.  These three performers give terrific work.
Into a meltdown prone situation comes the girls' mother (Debra Winger).  Long divorced, she feels left-out of the festivities, but is also clearly a refuge to Rachel, who yearns for her mother's time and affection.  Winger gives another very nice performance, and I sure wish that Winger got more work.  I know she always had a reputation for being very difficult, but her work sure seems to make the results worthwhile.

For much of the film, I felt a little bad for Sidney, the fiance.  A physically imposing figure who is also clearly just as gentle as can be, he is a quite presence in these uncomfortable scenes of confrontation.  While one could argue his role is underwritten, I believe his calm is the antidote Rachel needs to a family that clearly spends lot of time TALKING!  And Sidney gets to deliver one of the more touching cinematic wedding vows I've seen.  For a brief moment you feel like a guest at that wedding, as he moving presents his thoughts and DeWitt beams in a way that clearly shows the actress was touched herself by the moment.

I deliberately NOT giving away any more plot details, because few things really happen, and most of them are pretty important to understanding the characters...so I'll let you discover these secrets as I did.

The movie is pretty uneven at times.  As I said, the constant scenes of frolicking are just unbelievable.  Apparently these folks don't know a single uptight person.  I know Demme loves music, and loves to use it to move his movies along (as he did so well in SOMETHING WILD all those years ago)...but these scenes simply try our patience and feel like filler to make the movie just slightly over 90 minutes.  And the hand-held camera, while affording great freedom in moving amongst the people...is also sloppy at times and the film frequently could have benefitted from a more classical cinematography.

But the performances and most of the script make this film quite worthwhile to see.  Hathaway gives an unexpected performance, but there are many others in the film who should be generating Oscar buzz as well.  While the ending of the film feels a little untidy, there is a truthfulness to that as well.  After all, people may change and grow a little in one weekend...but do they transform?? At least the film knows that they don't.",1226102400,4,5585,4.752855659397715

It is beautifully shot, and the pain you can see in our main character as she suffers between her past and the possibility of losing her sister forever to her future husband Sydney. Debra Winger is also great as their mother who has divorced their father long ago. It has been awhile since I have seen her, think terms of endearment or urban cowboy. She still looks fabulous and she plays her part well. It has a great supporting cast, including a father who would rather cook and clean all day then deal with the problems that no one wants to talk about.

3547596,5,B001E95ZNS,"Kym (Ann Hathaway) seems a bit on edge as she leaves rehab for a weekend trip back home, to participate in her sister Rachel's (Rosemarie DeWitt) wedding. As soon as she gets in Dad's (Bill Irwin) car, we get a sense of her deep rooted hostility, anger and guilt. Her step-mom (Anna Deveare Smith) tries to offer encouragement, but Kym remains skeptical. As soon as they reach the large family house, nestled in an idyllic glen, the chaos of the preparations for the wedding soon overwhelm Kym and she runs to an AA meeting. There, she meets Kieran (Mather Zickel), an interesting guy who also has an addiction. When Kym returns home, she learns Kieran is the groom's (Tundee Adebimpe) best man and they quickly 'bond'. Both Kym and Rachel are eager for their semi-reclusive mom (Debra Winger) to make an appearance and are happy she and her husband show up for the rehearsal dinner. Throughout the festivities, Kym becomes more and more angry, depressed, happy and bitter about her life, forcing the family to work through these issues in a time already packed with other pressures, requirements and headaches.

Directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Jenny Lumet (director Sidney's daughter), ""Rachel Getting Married"" is a film filled with great performances helping to create real characters and it really helps to give a full picture of this entire family. But when I initially left the theater, I really disliked the experience. It was like sitting through a bad wedding. A very long, bad wedding.

But the more I thought about ""Rachel"", the more I came to understand the film and appreciate the very fact that if Demme, Lumet and their cast were able to make me feel this way, the film is, in fact, excellent.

From the moment Anne Hathaway first appears on screen as Kym, the black sheep of the family, you realize the actress is going for something different, something she has never attempted before. Long gone are ""The Princess Diaries""; Kym is a drug addict and currently housed in a rehab clinic. She is getting a weekend pass to attend the wedding of her sister, Rachel, and seems both delighted to leave the facility, but also very scared to be returning home. With short, jagged black hair, punker clothes and thick red lips, Kym is a rebel and will probably always be a little defiant to everyone and anyone she crosses paths with.

As soon as she gets in the car with her dad and step-mom, her dad tries valiantly to avoid talking about rehab and concentrating only on his older daughter's wedding. But this also seems to annoy Kym; haven't they always avoided the subject before? Haven't they always avoided talking about the issues before? Isn't that part of the problem? Part of the reason Kym is dealing with all of these problems.

As Hathaway pulls apart the layers of her character, revealing the problems Kym has suffered throughout her life, we begin to see how complicated this person really is. More importantly, we begin to forget we are watching Anne Hathaway. When Kym arrives at the family home, the chaos engulfing the house quickly becomes too much for her. She finds her sister and her best friend and quickly gets into a squabble with the best friend. And then gets in a fight with her sister. And then has to flee, to find a place that isn't so chaotic, so threatening to her sobriety. Since she has to go to a meeting anyway, she flees to that. Barely making the meeting, she finds solace there and meets Kieran.

When she returns home, she realizes Kieran is the Best Man and they quickly decide to satisfy each others needs.

As the weekend continues, Kym vacillates between happiness, normalcy and the brink so many times, we begin to wonder if she should be out of rehab. When her big secret is revealed, it provides a real emotional wallop and gives us an idea of the extent of the problem.

Debra Winger plays Abby, Kym and Rachel's semi-estranged mom. When Abby finally joins the festivities, for the rehearsal dinner, she walks forward to hug her daughters, but the expression on her face indicates she feels she is kind of obligated to do this and doesn't necessarily want to or she feels uncomfortable hugging her daughters. Throughout the story, we get a picture of the complicated relationship between Abby and her daughters.

As soon as Kym gets in the car with her dad and step-mom, step-mom (Anna Deveare Smith) gives her an update about when she can expect mom. But this doesn't happen and both Kym and Rachel are anxious for their mom to be present, to participate in the events, to be a part of their lives. When she finally does show up, many different issues seem to rise and rear their ugly heads.

It has been a long time since we have seen Winger in a role that she can really sink her teeth into and this is a welcome aspect of the film. Winger is a great actress and her absence has been sorely missed. Now, as Abby, she brings a complicated character to life. More importantly, her character helps to make Kym's character all the more real and believable, because their relationship and interactions are so real and interesting.

As Kym tries to deal with all of her conflicting emotions, she goes to her mom's house, to have a conversation, which quickly leads to a fight. Things escalate out of control, and Kym runs off, only to get into more trouble. This is a real turning point and she seems to accept she has loving people in her family, she just has to love them back.

Bill Irwin, Rosemarie Dewitt, Anna Deveare Smith and Tundee Adebimpe round out the family members and they are all good. More importantly, they are the type of cast only a handful of talented directors could assemble and make work. Jonathan Demme is such a director. He has chosen a group of actors not known for their proficiency in creating believable, dramatic characters and woven them together to create an interesting, believable ensemble cast. You quickly forget you are watching a movie and feel as though you are watching a wedding video.

I know a lot of people who dislike watching films with a lot of handheld camera work. If you feel the same way, ""Rachel Getting Married"" might be a difficult experience for you to sit through. The entire film is shot with a handheld camera. Initially, this was a bit unsettling. As soon as the film starts, and you see this, you quickly become aware that this will go on through the entire course of the film. When this realization struck, I got used to it. In a way, it helps to further give the impression of watching a wedding video, capturing all of the moments, both great and awkward.

Demme also uses an editing style serving to enhance the ""home video"" feel of the film. Every edit is abrupt and quick, giving us the impression the camera was turned on to capture a new moment, giving us the feeling we are watching the raw videotape recording the event.

""Rachel Getting Married"" is not an easy film to watch. As the camera roams across the rooms of the house, capturing all of the chaos, roaming over the faces of various guests at the rehearsal dinner, capturing the entire speech they make to the happy couple, you begin to feel like you are an active participant in this long, long celebration. The rehearsal dinner seems particularly claustrophobic, long and painful. As the dinner progresses, the camera capturing each of the speeches in painful detail, we get a sense of the small room this growing party is in, late arrivals shoe horning themselves in around an already crowded table. We get a sense of the amount of alcohol consumed as the speeches become more and more overly emotional. Some people are enjoying the dinner, but many more are in the same pain we are in. Honestly, this fifteen minute scene seemed like it lasted the length of a real rehearsal dinner. The actual wedding is almost as excruciating. After the ceremony, a seemingly endless parade of different types of musicians and dancers parade through the festivities, further enhancing the chaos. But these moments only help to enhance the authenticity of the events we are watching portrayed. Even the endless parade of very different musicians fits with Rachel and Sidney's characters; they are trying to create a wedding that fits with their style and this means a lot of different influences, styles and people. And they generally seem to enjoy all of the activities. And they seem to be the only people who understand the significance of everything planned.

""Rachel Getting Married"" is Jonathan Demme's best film in many years and this says a lot given the previous accomplishments of this director.",1224460800,3,8585,4.7057256990679095

If you have ever had any sort of addict in your family, you know about the unreliability, narcissism, and unpredictable behaviors that accompany large family events. This is a slice of that story. If you have someone in your family like the main character Kym, you'll recognize the idea in the film. I loved it.",1522108800,,479,4.647058823529412
