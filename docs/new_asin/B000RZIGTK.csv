8203293,5,B000RZIGTK,"This is actually a great collection of horror films.

""Sleepy Hollow"", a great Gothic style horror film from the always reliable collaberation of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.

""Red Eye"", is a really great thrill ride, s simple and strong story with fun suspense.

""What Lies Beneath"" is one of my personal favs. Great acting and serious white knuckle suspense.

""The Haunting"" is a more special effects driven horror film but still effective.

If you like horror films and want a ""Fright Night"", you cant go wrong.",1207699200,2,513,4.850574712643678
