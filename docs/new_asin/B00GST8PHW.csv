6108598,5,B00GST8PHW,"I watched this movie when Lifetime television first aired  the movie on television,  APPLAUSE to the casting director for casting Miss Gershon, and applause to Miss Gershon's performance as Donatella Versace ""i wrote that with an Italian accent ""They truly made her look like Donatella, but Miss Gershon brought Donatella to life.  There are movies that become a guilty pleasure, this one is mine .  I have watched it a few times and I still don't get tired of hearing the same lines !!

A great movie to watch with all the girls !!",1392422400,,532,4.617021276595745

6108679,2,B00GST8PHW,"One thing about DVD that you can consider good or bad, depending on your tastes, is that nearly everything ever made into a movie can now be found on DVD. True, there are some movies missing that deserve to be out there, but we'll just have to wait for those. On the other hand there are a number of made for TV/cable movies that make their way to DVD shortly after they play on TV. HOUSE OF VERSACE is one of those movies.

The movie tells the tale of the grand designing conglomerate Gianni Versace (Enrico Colantoni) as seen through the eyes of his sister and business partner Donatella (Gina Gershon). When the film starts both are alive and well and doing great business in the fashion world. Sure they have their little spats but they work well together, complimenting one another when the need arises. Brother Santo (Colm Feore) runs the business end of things and has a hard time keeping them in check when it comes to finances but Gianni's passion and product are the talk of the town and keep them going.

All of that changes one dark day when Gianni is shot down as he is about to enter his home. The company begins to wonder what will happen next and Donatella is hurt the most losing her best friend as well as brother. Things become worse for all when Gianni's will is read leaving everything to his niece and nothing to his brother or sister. The effects this has on his sister in particular are at the heart of the story as she turns to drink and drugs to numb herself while at the same time trying to keep the designing house alive. Her struggle is what makes the majority of this film.

As dramas go the film isn't all that bad and the performances by all involved are quite good. And yet at the same time the film has a definite made for TV feel to it, as if things were sanitized to qualify for the small screen. I'm not saying I want full blown nudity left and right but still, the story feels like it has less punch than the reality of what happened. Even so, it's not bad and enjoyable enough watch. It might not be something you'll want to add to your collection but if everything else has been rented or if it pops up on TV you'll still get a nice story and find out if the House of Versace survived all that happened to it.",1409356800,3,2249,4.274647887323944
6108680,5,B00GST8PHW,Great movie. I've watched it several times. Gina Gershon is excellent!,1407888000,,70,5.454545454545454
6108681,5,B00GST8PHW,Gina Gershon was fantastic in the role of Donnatella Versace.  I give it the highest number of stars - 5!!!,1406937600,,107,4.35
6108682,5,B00GST8PHW,I was very entranced by Gina Gershon's performance. It's not very often an actress can play a high profile icon with such meticulous focus on detail and deliverance. Gina Gershon is right on spot with every line and nuance.,1404777600,,223,4.743589743589744

8626987,1,B00GST8PHW,Gershon is the only saving grace.  I really wanted to madly love this movie but it was really corny.  It's hard to do Versace on a made for tv budget...,1458345600,,152,4.033333333333333
