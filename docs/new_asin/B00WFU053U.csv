8713267,5,B00WFU053U,"I'm so happy I finally managed to get a copy of this drama! I've been looking everywhere for it! The acting is phenomenal and the story is gripping. Even if you're not a fan of Kim Hyunjoong but enjoy action/historical pieces, you will love the fighting scenes in this series! (And there are a lot!)",1490400000,,299,4.454545454545454
8713268,5,B00WFU053U,"Wow..... Kim Hyun Joong is a great actor and this shows him off.  He was great in Boys Over Flowers and Playful Kiss, but what he does in Inspiring Generation's!  I know he is a singer, dancer and actor.  The fight scene's .......... are amazing. The moves in the sword fights, he had me on the edge of my seat. If you like some history in your movies, they have that also. Enjoyed this Korean TV series and will watch it again.....and again.",1471996800,,442,4.301204819277109
8713269,4,B00WFU053U,"Kim Hyun Joong shows that he is much more than a pretty boy singer.  He can act. This drama shows the evolution of a poverty stricken young man to the leader of a Chinese neighborhood.  Throughout all the corruption and brutality, he maintains his honesty and concern for others.  His character is admirable and strong.  The story is brutal, but most likely true to the viciousness that ruled the gangster milieu of the time.  The series averages about 5 fights per episode, and if you enjoy watching them, you will be happy.  Or you can fast forward them to get to the story.
Somehow the protagonists manages to survive every fight against anywhere between one and twenty opponents and he usually recovers with only a cut on the cheek and on the temple.  Even so, it's a great story and the acting is superb with villains who are pure evil and heroes who are the epitome of good.",1468454400,2,880,4.531645569620253
