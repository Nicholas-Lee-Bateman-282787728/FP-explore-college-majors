8246586,4,B0012KPVN8,"The short and sweet of this is: useful, but only for a starting point.

If you've got your feet firmly planted and you're already working on ""big deals"" on a regular basis then you probably won't get much if anything from this video.

On the other hand, if you need guidance, you don't know where to start, and you consider yourself a financial neophyte, then Kiyosaki's video will certainly be worth more than the price-tag. He talks about some foundational stuff that everyone should learn about, and it is all in very easy-to-understand language.

I would recommend it to a friend, but only a financially inexperienced one. It's also quite entertaining as well as funny, believe it or not!",1263772800,3,692,4.798319327731092
8246587,5,B0012KPVN8,"In a nutshell, this dvd is a taping of a live seminar.  The basics of Kiyosaki's teachings are covered.

As usual, Kiyosaki has a few good one liners.  And as usual, he gets you motivated to take action.

Overall, this is a good dvd. I have watched it several times.",1252972800,,266,4.26
