4466223,5,B004U33NHA,"Hi,

I, too, am a fan of the show, and it's nice to see others here pointing out the merits of this series, but I was hoping for more reviews of the specific ITEM being sold here, not reviews of the series per se.  What about this *item* ?  Were there any defective discs ?  Any freezing while watching ?  Does it have a good, user-friendly menu system ?  Etc.

Thanks !

(Btw, I put this comment here because I thought any comments I made -- like the one I made to one of the reviews here -- might not be seen and we'd simply get more reviews of the series, not the product.)",1313971200,5,576,3.991228070175439
4466224,5,B004U33NHA,"I was introduced to Corner Gas on an obscure cable channel late one night. Sometimes great dialogue, plenty of sarcasm, and thankfully no laugh track. Since the show seems to be off the air I bought the set. No disappointments.",1313798400,27,227,4.7
4466225,5,B004U33NHA,This show was the best on tv during its time. It is still hilarious in reruns and DVD.I never get tired of this show. This is timeless. Easy characters and true to life situations. Classic comedy!,1312243200,13,196,4.472222222222222
4466226,5,B004U33NHA,"This is not like most comedies on tv in that it isn't crass and doesn't use any vulgar language.  It's clever and enjoyable but some may find it dull.  There is no laugh track and it isn't filled with super models, just regular people in a small town in Canada.  Watch a few episodes before you buy it; if you don't get the charm after 3 episodes you never will, what you see is what you get.",1307664000,34,392,4.064935064935065
4466227,5,B004U33NHA,"First off, I did not purchase this exact packaging, but I did buy all six seasons individually-for a lot-a lot-more money. This was a great show, and it went out on top. It's a harmless, feel good situation comedy that is very character driven-think Andy Griffith type rather than Seinfeld. It's set in a mythical small town (Dog River) in the great white north of Canada, but it could easily be in the US, although there are some Canadian specific guests and jokes. The humor is well done, and it's never mean spirited. If your only exposure to this show was on WGN at 1 am or 5 am (like where I first saw it) you'll get a few more minutes in each episode here-I remember a lot of commercials on the over the air showings. I shared this show with my teenage daughter, and she really got into it too. This show gets my highest recommendation for its great comedy, consistent writing, acting and direction. You will really get to know he characters and enjoy the quirks of each, along with the wacky town, including the FOO MAR (letters fell off the sign) and the combination insurance agency/liquor store. I'll admit to owning a few mugs, keychains and even an official Corner Gas shirt just like Brent wears. The only complaint you'll have is that Dog River closed down too soon-you'll be left wanting more.",1306108800,57,1308,4.546610169491525

4466276,5,B004U33NHA,Corner Gas is my favorite show! Brent Butt is a great comedian/writer.

4466299,5,B004U33NHA,"Love love LOVE Corner Gas. So fun to watch and my entire family can enjoy it. The characters are crazy but enjoyable, and the plots are hilarious. A Canadian friend of mine, who also enjoys the show, has filled me in on some of the jokes that would be less-obvious to us Americans, like the ""smells like burn toast"" line and the following line that ""he must be about to have a seizure"" (based on a Canadian public service commercial); or the Canadian Fitness episode (she showed me a YouTube video of the real PSA and the episode became that much funnier). This boxed set is perfect. I don't recall if there are bonus features, but there are tons of episodes.

I had been keeping an eye on this boxed set, as the price kept fluctuating ridiculously, and when it went back down I snatched it up. Glad I got it! Apparently you can find the episodes on YouTube now, but I love having them and being able to just pop in a disc and binge-watch.",1468886400,,939,4.3352272727272725

The shows music can get to be a bit much if you watch too many episodes in one sitting.  But, this is a great, funny, silly, weird show with characters many of us may know in real life.  It's got to be your kind of humor, though.  If it is, I Highly Recommend Corner Gas - The Complete Box Set!",1467936000,,412,4.049382716049383
4466302,5,B004U33NHA,Great Show!  I just wish there was more than 6 seasons.  If you've never seen it before be sure to give it some time.  It gets much funnier as you get to know the characters in depth.  I've seen it many times before and my girlfriend didn't like it too much when we first started watching but the deeper she gets into it the more she loves it.  Excellent writing and acting all around.,1467072000,,385,4.148648648648648

4466305,5,B004U33NHA,"Fantastic series, very funny. Brent Butt developed a hilarious six season series here. Corner Gas was one of our favorite TV series and we're happy that it's available in this DVD set.

Corner Gas is a smart series with a homespun, quirky humor, sometimes subtle but always entertaining. This set is well put together and the cast of characters is just great, from the bumbling Hank, the bewildered cafe owner/operator Lacy, the town constable Davis, to the irrepressible curmudgeon Oscar, this is a laugh-out-loud funny series. It's set in rural Dog River on the ""mid-prairie grassland, middle-of-nowhere, farm country"" of Saskatchawan, Canada, eh!

Highly recommended viewing for those with a need for off-beat, smart humor.

Plus, the story lines are creative and presented in an entertaining way; very zany without being corny. I particularly enjoy it because its much more family oriented than a lot of shows that are on today (especially here in the U.S.). There are no explicit sexual situations or violence to cheapen the show. Its too bad that it wasn't marketed more in the United States, I would think it would be a huge hit here too (I was lucky enough to see it during its brief run on WGN).

Unlike the first Amos and Andy 44 program purchase, I am THRILLED with this experience. If you are on the fence to buy this set.....DO IT, DO IT, DO IT!!!!!!!!!!  You will not be sorry.
UPDATE OF THE BOX SET:
Now that I have used this set for a few months, I do have one negative comment.  The first 2 sets do not flow from one program to the next by itself.  In order to change from 1 to 2, to 3 etc. it has to be done manually.  Corner Gas program is one of the best sitcoms made, I'm just a bit disappointed in the quality of those disc's.  IF....you are trying to decide whether to get it or not....I repeat....DO IT, DO IT, DO IT!!!!!!!

The characters are delightfully flawed, charming people. The humor is very witty. We still find ourselves quoting Corner Gas in our every day lives.

Now my best friend is my fiance and I bought this for him as part of an engagement present because we both love this show.  I really think this is the funniest, most authentic sitcom out there.
Nothing feels forced, no laugh track, no annoying-protagonists-who-can't-commit-to-each-other yet you know they will end up together so they just spend the whole show breaking up and getting back together dramatically while taking up the show time, you know, none of the bad stuff. :)  Just amazing, amazing comedy.

Oscar has to be the best character in the show...watching him tear a TV completely apart to hook up a VCR is great...and then realizing it only needs the 3 RCA cables attached because its a ""Japanese Model"" is comedy gold.  The series looks at small town Canadian life....if you love Rush, TPB, SCTV, you will love this.  Never heard of those things? No problem...you will still love this.",1404345600,,460,4.725

4466423,5,B004U33NHA,"So I just wanted to point out how wonderful the 5.1 surround mix is for the entire series.  The dialogue is up front, center mostly, where it belongs, and the surround is panned nicely for elements such as the whip-pan sound effect, off-camera dialogue, and passing vehicles. In certain locations, however--in the Ruby or the bar at the Hotel, outside the Leroys' house or Corner Gas itself--the surround mix really places you in the scene with customer chatter and background music playing (though each setting seems to have its own same song playing each time we're there) or birds chirping.

If part of the charm of this excellent series is its sense of place--and if you need to own the DVDs, clearly a place you want to visit time and again--the audio on these discs is to be highly commended, best of any I've heard this side of ""Community.""",1394323200,,847,4.677852348993288

I searched to find the complete series based on the humor and interaction of the characters in this Canadian comedy.  Unlike most sitcoms here in the states, the situations are refreshing, not belittling to any one character as each has their endearing qualities.  Brent takes everything in stride; Hank is a bit of a loose canon but you've got to love him.  Stop by Corner Gas next time you're driving through Saskatchewan or take a gander at this series and meet the rest of the characters that make the world go around in Dog River. +++++",1392940800,,651,4.586206896551724

4466426,5,B004U33NHA,My wife and I are Canadians and unfortunately remove the way to the US and a few years later this lovely series came onto the Canadian airway. There was a few places on the East Coast the dead show that but since we are on the West Coast we had no idea of the show was on the air. As we are going to Edmonton to visit a relative we have been to say overnighter hotel and we watch this television show for the first time. We were so blown away on how great it was and how well it was written and everything to do that we love the show and luckily it was at the holding fees until they have a bit of A marathon on the TV. The bad news was that this was going to be the final year of the show and so we had pretty much a mess. But the good news was we could able to catch up on everything real quick. Until now I've been trying to find places on the Internet that show that or every time I go to Canada we watch this and I've actually happened to buy one of the season separately.  My wife knowing how much I really loved the show should try to get me to box that and she wants to for a while and she got a really great price and we both love watches most of this half of the season and we love watching behind-the-scenes all the stuff that come with it that you used to get the seat and will be watching this for years.

I come from a small farming town in the American midwest, so I was particularly amused by some of the more subtle humor. I've since turned at least two people onto this show and at least one of those has gone on to turn on a couple more.

My order was through Out of this World and I couldn't ask for more. The box set was shrink wrapped and then each individual season set was also shrink wrapped. Each disc was in perfect condition, so I'm a very happy customer.",1389571200,,620,4.12396694214876

The inside jokes and dry humor were intelligently written and pulled off better than most prime time shows.  Almost makes me want to take a trip to Canada just to see what life is really aboot up there.

I have watched all six seasons and I can say that the format never changes. If you are looking for fast pace twitchy camera-work, beautiful people talking in witty double entandres and living in 7 figure apartments while working at minimum wage jobs, then this is definitely NOT the show for you. Brett and his friends are 'regular guys' albeit with an exaggerated quirkiness. There is no harsh language, no nudity, no violence. If you are new to CG I would suggest getting the first season and giving it a look. If you don't like season 1 you won't like any of the others.

Started out by accidentally watching this thing at 3 a.m. after work one night on WGN.  Almost immediately became one of my favorite comedies.

It's kind of a combination of Seinfeld and Dick Van Dyke, if that makes any sense.  It's something the entire family can enjoy without being boring.  It's simply about a gas station in the country.  That's it.  Like any good comedy the writing has to be good of course, but the actors have to be good as well and they deliver...big time.

4466516,5,B004U33NHA,"We watched this show for years before it was taken off the tv station.  We rented the seasons to watch over and over again.  And now we own the complete set!  This is the best show that's been worth watching for many years.  The characters are so diverse and funny; the situations are side-splitting; the writing is just great.  We will enjoy ""Corner Gas"" for many years to come!",1353888000,3,379,4.434782608695652

4466519,5,B004U33NHA,"Corner Gas isn't a guilty pleasure - it's pure enjoyment. The cast of characters from a fictional small town in Saskatchewan may well represent folks from Anytown, USA. In fact, six of the actors hail from the Canadian province. No laugh track - you are the laugh track. Deadpan comedy, zingers, and making fun of everyday life are what this show is about. I guarantee viewers will recognize a character they relate to in real life.",1349136000,3,432,4.697368421052632
4466520,5,B004U33NHA,"This is a terrific comedy, very quirky.  The only problem I had is the 3rd season dvds were marred or something.  The first disc worked OK, but the 2nd one crashed my computer.  Twice.  So not a fluke.  And I couldn't the 3rd disc to play at all.  Otherwise, great fun.  I'm watching it for the 2nd time.",1346025600,,304,4.137931034482759
4466521,5,B004U33NHA,"Awesome show. Canadian television has the best shows. The first thing you notice is that there is no laugh track. And guess what, you know when to laugh! It amazes me that producers think that viewers are too stupid to know when to laugh so they put in sound tracks or live audiences that have to have laugh cue cards. There are no high priced actors or big budget sets, which is why it works. Nancy Robertson is just wonderful and Brent Butt is so lovable. The 8 main characters focus on their daily interactions in the small town of Dog River, Saskatchewan, Canada. The interaction between the characters is perfect and makes you wish your town was like that. The episodes rely on quick wit and sarcasm and not vulgar language, violence or nudity.  My favorite is character is Oscar and his catch phrases ""Jack Ass"".  This is truly an enjoyable, lovable show like Due South and Hiccups. I did buy the set in the gas can box from Amazon.com and have had no issues with any of the discs.",1343347200,11,987,4.447513812154696
4466522,5,B004U33NHA,If you like to laugh I would encourage you to give this TV show a try. Brent Butt is a comedic genius and his humor is clever and family oriented. The cast is excellent and very funny.,1342656000,7,184,4.0
4466523,5,B004U33NHA,"The amazon order couldn't have gone any better. fast shipping, great show. I agree with others here that the ""gas can"" box is kind of goofy and a waste (very thin cardboard/paper box) but at least each season's dvd case is standard-sized. And it's the show that counts, right?  Corner Gas is way better than anything that passes for tv entertainment today. Thank you VSC and CTV for making this excellent, very funny series available in a complete set of DVD's.",1341100800,6,461,4.691358024691358
4466524,5,B004U33NHA,"I got hooked on corner gas while it was being aired on WGN America, but the it was taken off the air & replaced by something dumb and mundane. I finally gave in & bought the entire series. The writing is witty, sarcastic and always funny. The characters are a bit over the top but why not, it is a small town with lots of nothing going on. It strikes me as a mix between ""Last of the Summer Wine"" & ""Fraiser"", lots of silly things going on but always clever. Congrats to Brent Butt and his team for producing a clever, entertaining show that the entire family can watch.",1339545600,3,570,4.1909090909090905
4466525,5,B004U33NHA,"I used to see this in reruns and really started getting into the series.  The characters are individually amusing, and hilarious as an ensemble.  After I could no longer find the reruns being aired in the States, I decided to take matters into my own hands and get the box set.  If you're a Seinfeld fan, then this is a rural Saskatchewan version.  It has a combination of neurotic, absent-minded, crotchety and well-meaning but misguided characters that make every episode funny and original.",1338249600,2,493,4.903614457831325
4466526,4,B004U33NHA,"This was a great product.  I have watched all discs and on only two episodes, each on seperate discs, did the episode stop like there was a scratch (there was no visible scratch).  After each pause the episode continued with nothing missed; it didn't skip ahead any (it was like the disc was paused and then un-paused).  It's true that the case itself is pretty cheap but it's not like other movie packs or show packs don't come in similar cases, so don't let that be a put off from ordering it.  It really is a fantastic deal to order the entire series in this package than to buy the seasons seperately.  The DVDs are even contained in the actual season cases that can be purchased seperatley, some series collections don't give you that.  Each has its own theme and the season booklet fits the theme in a rather clever way.  If you have seen the show and loved it enough to want the series, do yourself a favor, buy it in this compilation.  You will get everything as though you bought it seperately but save yourself a good bit of money (it's almost like getting a season free, maybe even two).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corner-Gas-The-Complete-Series-Box-Set/dp/B004U33NHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corner Gas - The Complete Series Box Set</a>",1336694400,4,1298,5.089622641509434

4466528,5,B004U33NHA,very funny series.  Lots of canadian humor I did not understand but it did not detract from the show much.

4466529,5,B004U33NHA,"i'm from Utah, so when it comes to Canadian comedy (meaning comedy as it pertains to what it's like to be Canadian), my frame of reference pretty much consists of Bob & Doug McKenzie. (not that STRANGE BREW isn't still funny.) or it did until a couple of springs ago, when i discovered that at that time, WGN was airing a sitcom from from the Great White North called CORNER GAS a couple of midnights a week. i figured that since i was already a fan of a few ""Britcoms,"" what did i have to lose?
CORNER GAS is the brainchild of a stand-up comedian named Brent Butt. (with a name like that, what else was he gonna be? a brain surgeon?) legend has it that one day Butt found himself pondering what his life might've been if he'd never gone on the road. the next thing he knew, he found himself creating, then playing, the proprietor of the sole gas station in the rural Saskatchewan provence of Dog River, which is located (literally, not figuratively) in the middle of nowhere.
Dog River is easiest to describe as Mayberry filtered through The Twilight Zone. (or is that just me and my American's-eye-view?) it's a fairly typical small town, but events and obsessions can get bizarre. let the competition worry about pregnancies, bankruptcies, the ""big"" questions. this is a series where plots hang on weightier issues like whether the police can get free coffee, one woman's determination to write her name in the fresh cement, and the quest to erect a tourist attraction: The World's Biggest Hoe.
joining Butt in his carbon-copy of his hometown are a delightfully quirky cast. a snarky Corner Gas employee who divides her time pretty much evenly between being facetious and qualifying for Mensa. a ""new"" girl in town (she inherited the cafe from her aunt) who's so busy worrying about not fitting in that she completely forgets not to fit in. a police force consisting of a dedicated, studious rookie, and a flighty, often childlike senior officer. a village idiot who makes The Three Stooges look like rocket scientists. (on one memorable occasion, he replies to every statement, including the inquiry as to whether he really understands the joke, with ""that's what she said."") and then there's Butt's parents: a father who sets a new standard for the crotchety old fart stereotype, and the most loving, devoted wife ever to come within repeated hairsbreadths of ripping her husband to shreds.
is CORNER GAS the greatest sitcom Canada has ever produced? i'm tempted to say so, but i'm not sure i'm qualified to make that call. it's the ONLY Canadian television series i've ever heard of, so i can't attest to just how stiff it's competition might've been. (indeed, i can't even testify, in a court of law, that there WAS competition.) so it would be roughly analagous to describing Satan as the greatest Prince Of Darkness of all time.
aw, heck with it. i hereby go On The Record as saying that CORNER GAS is the greatest Canadian sitcom of all time. (it is, after all, the greatest one i personally have ever seen.)",1326326400,11,3018,4.706994328922495

4466532,4,B004U33NHA,"first of all, i have a question, maybe i missed it since i marathon through it, but it seemed as if there were atleast two episodes missing, the one where the do the fake series ending where lacy is suppose to move back to toronto, and the one where karen says shes taller for a girl then davis is for a man and makes fun of him, im guessing i missed those two episodes, but just for my peace of mind can someone else confirm this.

now of the review, its a great series, has a dry humor and the character truly grow on you.  I live in america and watched this on WGN America at midnight everynight, and now i finally got to see the few episodes i missed.  if anyone wants to try a new show for a relative cheap price, i defiantly recommend this for you. at least check it out on you tube, but honestly it takes about two to three episode until you really appreciate the dialogue and overall flow of the show.

for the ppl who know the show and just want the collection.  The overall collection, design anyways, is kida cheap.  the cardboard box with a poorly designed gas can is kida stupid, and doesnt live up to the series itself.  with that said, the individual dvds are amazing in most cases.  the design both the cover, but especially the booklet inside are great.  I would say 5 out of the 6 are among my favorites of any non collectors edition dvd (thats including big budget hollywood movie).  and honestly i just don't like the 6th one for my personal taste, its still great quality.  with the exception of the first season, the production value is pretty good as far as the video quality goes.

basically i am very happy with my purchase, the overall box design sucks, but that is really the only complaint i have (other then the possible exclusion of those two episode, but like i said that may very well be me missing it, not their fault)",1324166400,,1851,4.287356321839081
4466533,5,B004U33NHA,"Canada TV delivers a very well done Sitcom, enjoyable for all ages. It is priceless in content and perfect in quirky characters, making this not only very funny, but keeps one looking for more. American TV could learn from this formula and structure its offerings on the premises of excellent writing, great characters, and clean fun language; instead of the low brow offerings we get each fall.

4466534,5,B004U33NHA,"We bought the whole series after watching seasons 3 and 4 on an online dvd rental site (don't want Amazon to bump this review by putting the name of the site in the review.) We have no regrets , not one. It's delightful entertainment, often laugh out loud, certainly plenty of chuckles. It's perfect for those of us who can't get to sleep after watching serious dramas with lots of blood, gore, and ickiness - you can have a darned nice evening of fun, and then sleep without nightmares. We love it, and even though if we'd waited, we would have spent a lot less for it, it's still been worth it. It's sort of Seinfeld on the Saskatchewan prairie. Highly recommend. Only thing I would have changed is at the end of the last season, when the futures of the characters are given (life after Corner Gas) I think Lacy and Brent should have gotten married. It would have been a marriage worthy of his parents. Makes me laugh thinking about it.",1319760000,,938,4.427745664739884

It is a show that can be watched over and over. It simply never gets old. It combines a sort of British-style humor with American influences. It is the best of both worlds.

Canada got this one right. I am sad that the show ended after 6 seasons, but at least we don't have to worry about it lasting past its shelf life.

Watch this show. Once you start, you can't stop.",1319241600,,539,4.173076923076923
