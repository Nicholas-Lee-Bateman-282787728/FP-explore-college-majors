6577891,1,B00MH8ESOM,Its missing 2 episodes and i would like to see more pokemon tv shows in these box sets,1448064000,,86,3.8333333333333335
6577892,3,B00MH8ESOM,"This re-release of the set is good, however it has a missing episode.

""Holiday Hi-Jynx"" has been omitted from this and the recent ""Complete Indigo League"" set (released in 2014), due to the ""Black Face"" controversy of Jynx's original design, before Nintendo changed it to purple. So far they haven't altered the color of Jynx's face yet (they have for the Japanese version, but not the English dub version yet), so who knows when and if such a version will be released on DVD by Viz anytime soon.

If you want that episode, you need to get the original Volume 3 release from 2009 (which has Episodes 53-79 written on the case), which has that episode, but of course, still retains Jynx's original look.

However if that doesn't bother you, then this set should suffice. :)",1424995200,8,773,4.669117647058823
6577893,4,B00MH8ESOM,"I hope the entire set isn't 3 volumes in 1 box,in a thinpack i hope they are at least in a case like Digimon from New Video. I also want them to keep up releasing the Poke'mon sets in season form from Orange Island up,but i would like strong and sturdy cases.",1414108800,,259,4.0
6577894,1,B00MH8ESOM,"The original 3rd boxset included the episode Holiday hi-Jynx, it was the only one of the original 3 to have more than 26 episodes, and since in recent months the whole Jynx blackface controversy has reared its ugly head again, it's a safe bet that's the episode that's missing.",1411603200,,277,4.673469387755102
8672311,1,B00MH8ESOM,Video is choppy and unwatchable.,1529539200,,32,5.6
8672312,5,B00MH8ESOM,"Took a risk based on the mixed reviews of the quality of the discs. Gladly, my dvd box (sealed) and discs came in perfect condition and the plays well without skips.

As many reviewers noted, there no episode numbers or anything, even in the disc menu. So you just have to keep playing and remember where you left off. My video player resumes where I left off when I turn it back on, so I have no issues there.

As far as content, some of these episodes are like filler episodes until you get to the last few, which had Ash fighting in the Indigo League competition.

As far as price, it is decent. The Target and Walmart websites also sell pokemon dvds, so compare prices if you find the sellers to be too high/variable at times.",1519257600,,730,4.313868613138686
