8164206,5,B00000F9GU,"Disorder in the Court is my all-time favorite Stooge flick. While it has constant laughs, the scene where Curly is being sworn in is the best. And I can't the number times I quoted him  saying ""I'm a victim of soycumstance.""",1084406400,5,224,4.463414634146342
8164207,5,B00000F9GU,"DISORDER IN THE COURT is in my top five favorite Curly Three Stooges films. I can't believe this wasn't nominated for an Academy Award. This has to be the most famous Three Stooges short ever made. You can't be a Three Stooges fan until you see this.
BRIDELESS GROOM was SO funny. Shemp is the funniest Stooge of all. This is possibly his best film. This deserved an award, too. I, somehow, like the remake, HUSBANDS BEWARE, better. But still an excellent short.",1011139200,6,462,4.578313253012048
