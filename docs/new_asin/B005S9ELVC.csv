4864553,4,B005S9ELVC,"Gangster Squad is Zombieland director Ruben Fleischer's first full drama film and only his third feature, but it's his best yet and ends up being one of the best gangster movies since L.A. Confidential, it's thematic cousin. The film will go down with a lingering footnote in relation to the theater shooting in Aurora, CO last July. A crucial scene involving gangsters shooting a theater audience was removed and the context was rewritten and reshot out of respect to the horrific real life events. The film was also delayed from its original September release to this Friday. Despite the unexpected changes, the film works wonderfully.

The film, based on true events, begins in 1948 Los Angeles as gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is establishing his foothold on the city and ultimately the West Coast. In the opening scene it's quite clear that Cohen will hold nothing back and that he's as ruthless as he is evil. In the next scene, we're introduced to the heroic Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) as he single-handedly beats the hell out of some of Cohen's lower level crooks. In an expertly-written (screenplay by Will Beall) introduction, we meet Sgt. Jerry Wooters (scene-stealing Ryan Gosling). Gosling absolutely steals the show in his portrayal of Wooters, which will come as no surprise to his fans of his recent roles (Drive). After struggles to stop Cohen, L.A.P.D. Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) instructs O'Mara to form a small squad to break Cohen's operation apart.

The squad is a delight to watch in action, including the minor stumbles along the way. Fleischer has a keen eye for dramatic action and even manages to bring humorous, lighthearted moments from Beall's script to life. The gangster squad is given plenty of time to develop the camaraderie and it's clear they function at their best as a crew. Grace Faraday (Emma Stone) is a fresh take on the femme fatale and Stone is great in the role. It's truly an ensemble film and the cast all deliver fantastic performances.

It's a shorter film for its type (just shy of two hours), but it has a balanced flow. Fleischer inserts his Zombieland-esque slow-motion moments, but they're used less for cool sequences and more to reinforce the view from the characters involved who are firing their guns rapid-fire, with time moving in apparent slow motion. It's also a visually beautiful film and feels entirely authentic in its time period. It's absolutely the late 40s and the time period of L.A. matches up perfectly with other dramas of the same time. Overall, it's a fun and exciting ride that really shines from the wonderful cast performances and turned out as a pleasant surprise.

Verdict: Absolutely see in theaters",1357689600,4,2689,4.929359823399558
4864604,4,B005S9ELVC,"An excellent movie. Josh Brolin, Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, and Emma Stone really sell it and the supporting cast, chalk full of ""Hey! I know that guy!"" actors is every bit as good. A semi-modern take on old LA with a great plot, action sequences, and just the right amount of mild humor. Definitely one for your collection.",1516147200,,322,4.568965517241379
4864605,5,B005S9ELVC,"Movie gets 5 stars alone due to the fact that watching Josh Brolin pummel Sean Penn is one of the most entertaining things watch.

4864608,4,B005S9ELVC,"Not even close to historically correct.  But, that's okay.  Sometimes, we just want a good old action flick.  This is what I would call a ""popcorn movie.""  Get your soda and a big bucket of popcorn and just enjoy.  The action is great, the banter is good, and the cast is superb.  If you're looking for an accurate portrayal of the real life LA Gangster Squad (yes, it was a thing), then this isn't that movie.  However, if you want a classic gangster flick complete with a femme fatal, tough-as-nails cop, and a truly vile villain, then this is the one.  I would compare it to Brian DePalma's ""Untouchables"" or one of the classic gangster films like ""Angels With Dirty Faces"" or the original 1930's ""Scarface"".",1505779200,,711,4.587301587301587

4864612,5,B005S9ELVC,"Great cinematography! Plot was great too!!! Highly recommended, if you are looking at the reviews to see why it is rated R it is because there is one sex scene (no nudity though), lots of violence, and some strong language.

4864638,4,B005S9ELVC,"Amazing cast, got to love Ryan Gosling, Anthony Mackie, Josh Brolin, Sean Penn and Emma Stone together. The film is highly stylized and almost cartoonish in appearance, which works until the very end when in the final fight the cinematography changes to hand-held closeups. The transition is a little jarring. The characters are based roughly on real people in the Los Angeles gang wars of the early 1950s; imagine a much less intricate version of a James Ellroy novel. The plot is for the most part forgettable and linear, we know how it's going to end. If you like this film, it's because you like the way it looks and you appreciate the chemistry between the actors.",1490832000,,669,4.726495726495727

4864721,1,B005S9ELVC,"With such an all-star cast, I was disappointed; this film was terrible.  Maybe it was trying to be like Kill Bill, but just couldn't lead up to those standards.

4864799,1,B005S9ELVC,LOL this movie was as bad as expected its sin city & that cheesy Dick tracy movies all in one. Its like one of those dime store magazines you always heard about growing up before comics jumped out of the dime pages & made cartoonie Who framed roger rabbit & dick tracy bubblegum babies. Gangster squad is their offspring. I kept expecting Madonna & al pacinos Big boy caprice & flattop and pruneface to join Mickey and the bad acting sean penn.

4864804,4,B005S9ELVC,"Should be THREE STARS, but falls into that rare  (for me) class of, so bad it's good. Really, the script and directing are laugh out loud awful. There's no character development and nothing but short straight lines in the plotting-- the movie you imagine two minutes in is the movie you get after it's all done. The big cartoonish acting all around makes it enjoyable. Sean Penn is the funnest scenery chewing gangster since Robert De Niro in The Untouchables, which isn't surprising, since that's who he's so obviously competing with. In fact, the whole movie was clearly pitched as  ""The Untouchables directed by John Woo!""",1470009600,,625,4.886792452830188
4864805,5,B005S9ELVC,"Gangster Squad is very underrated. Its a very well made, thrilling, fast paced and engrossing gangster movie. It's a little similar to the overrated Untouchables but blows that movie away in my opinion. The performances are excellent by a superb cast with Ryan Gosling as the standout in one of his best performances. Sean Penn is also a standout as the villain Mickey Cohen in a very threatening performance and the criminally underused Giovanni Ribisi has a nice role too. The action scenes are outstanding and intense and the movie has a great old fashioned 40s look and feel to it. My only complaint is that there are some moments of unnecessary slow motion. Other than that Gangster Squad is aces and sort of makes as a prequel to the masterpiece L.A. Confidential that is fun to watch as a double feature.",1468713600,,811,4.71830985915493

Read one of the factual books written about Mickey Cohen (it is apparent Sean Penn, et al never did, or maybe they did and just want the cash).  And then forget this movie made for morons.
The film uses real names and them distorts their characters, crimes, stories, deaths, etc. to a ridiculous  and shameful degree.  And never lets on that is does.
No actual historical character is presented truthfully.  Their characters, deaths, crimes - nothing is factual.
Written and portrayed by shameless liars for the average  American public mainly interested in and fascinated by ridiculous and impossible shooting and flash and gore.

4865182,5,B005S9ELVC,"In 1949 the citizens of Los Angeles, California didn't realize how close they came to being corrupted and inevitably destroyed as a community, until it was all over. Why and how? Because of a ruthless and vicious gangster by the name of - Mickey Cohen, and his like minded thugs. Which nearly became the cut-throat, dictator of the entire city. But, as a last ditch, desperate effort to thwart the sinister plot of a powerful and brutal crime figure like Mickey Cohen, the city's Chief of Police - Bill Pasker, calls upon a World War II hero and battle-hardened, soldier and cop: Sergeant John O'Mara. To select and form at his discretion... an undercover, vigilante group with militia style ""justice"", to counter attack the crime wave that had swept through and nearly engulfed the city. Their prime objective? Hunt down, capture and/or kill, Mickey Cohen and his cohorts. Courageous, Sgt. John O'Mara with his select, elite, crime stopper's, were given free rule and reign to take down all of the gangsters and thoroughly eradicate all of the tenacious, evil, tentacles which had been established and almost took hold of the entire city. The City of Los Angeles had become so corrupt, that the select Police/Militia Force was literally faced with overwhelming odds in it's attempts to restore decency, law, order and justice, back to the city that they once knew. This riveting depiction on the big-screen is based on a true story in Los Angeles of brave, undercover cops that banded together against the notorious underworld gangsters and their wanna be's. Who combined their efforts and talents too not only take back a city but it's very soul, as well. Actors - Josh Brolin, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte and Ryan Gosling star, within this compelling, color, motion picture that runs approximately 113-minutes on a single-disc, DVD. Cops verses robbers. The representatives of the Law verses the rebellious, law breaking, outlaws. It's all here, in this explosive, action and adventure, drama. Dynamic in content, as fists and bullets fly, a plenty. And, the climactic ending is so engaging and incredible, that it will make you want to jump into your viewing screen and join ""the fight!"" And it's all based upon actual events. That's why, the ending ""fight of fights"", is so exciting. This crime stopping film is most definitely an entertaining movie which will give you a glimpse into the history of the City of Los Angeles, as well as, insight into yet another gangster - Mickey Cohen, who got caught and was permanently put out of the crime business. And all because the GANGSTER SQUAD - brilliantly and courageously, ""nailed the coffin shut"", on the seemingly untouchable, Mickey Cohen - illegal, brutal and murderous operations and syndicate. This is an excellent film that confirms the endearing fact, that large or small, crime does not pay! Period. Way to go...,  GANGSTER SQUAD! Dear viewer, you will love the way the GANGSTER SQUAD ""...took care of business!"" An exciting and enthralling movie that's a definite keeper and makes for a great gift.

Trying too hard to force a noire atmosphere with a corny Dragnet voice-over & shallow stock characters, the film has more of a Marvel comic and perhaps even a Bugsy Malone feel than any sort of credible tale of corruption & vice in 1940's L.A. The linear and utterly predictable plot, the wooden acting, laughable shoot-outs and the lacklustre script all combine to produce a deeply unsatisfying experience.

4865390,3,B005S9ELVC,"Quick Story recap: A good cop who wants to clean up the streets of LA is tasked with stopping a crime boss from taking over by any means necessary. He assembles a team of guys to help called the Gangster Squad.

It seemed like a bad mix of The Untouchables and Dick Tracy with more violence and at times cheesy dialogue. This movie is a bumpy ride starting with the acting.  I think Josh Brolin and Giovanni Rabisi (Tech guy)  being the only two who did a decent job.  Ryan Gosling's character seemed to be ripped directly from a 50s Noir film, complete with that style of speech.  This made many of his scenes and especially his romantic scenes to fall short. There are just two scenes where I felt he was portraying a real person instead of doing an impression.  The movie never gives much time or importance to many of these characters so you don't really care for many of them or even remember their names.  I don't understand the gunslinger cowboy cop.  While his shooting was good, I liked him, his character stuck out as shouldn't really be in a mobster movie.  Also, they barely used his special skill, only two times the entire film - when the guys are practicing and the very end. Wasted character. Wasted skill.

Overall though, the movie is just ok.  It delivers well on action and that cool sense of the gangster mob movies that drove me to watch it in the first place. But it lacked in dialogue which was cheesy at times, plot holes, under developed characters, and it failed at the suspense and emotional points.  SPOILERS FOLLOWING HERE:  For example, the only moment in the movie the heroes were in real danger came in the form of the trap and it played out with Ryan Goslings character breaking up the trap well before it ever even became a viable suspense point.  The other moment the suspense fell short was when Josh Brolin's character comes home thinking his wife may have been killed.  It was so rushed, I didn't even know it was his house.  Even in slow motion as they follow the blood trail it was resolved without the emotional impact it was trying to achieve.  The boxing at the end could have also been taken out of the movie as it was stupid to think a cop with a gun would throw it down to duke it out hand to hand with a former boxing champ. There are a lot of things that didn't make sense, like how they traced the bug in Mickey Cohen's house directly to the location of Tech Guy. Why was absolutely no one at Mickey's house right after the Tech Guy's death? His house was guarded by tons of guys when Mickey wasn't home just 30 minutes earlier in the movie when they need to plant the bug. It's these moments that define the movie.  Good action but there were boneheaded things - It had potential but didn't live up  to it.",1420675200,2,2757,4.370588235294117

4865415,4,B005S9ELVC,"I loved this based-on-a-true story American good vs. evil saga. Reminiscent of The Untouchables and LA Confidential, this gritty, stylish film is more melodramatic though. This is gripping entertainment, not realism. The all-star cast is great, both the stars and the supporting characters as well. Sean Penns craggy features and real-life tough guy persona make him perfect for the role as crime boss Mickey Cohen. Josh Brolin is a good foil to Penns character and a compliment to Ryan Goslings character. Much like the characters played by Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce in LA Confidential,  the are two very different types of cops. Penns Cohen is better than even most Bond villains in his vision of domination.

Emma Stone I is certainly beautiful and a good femme fatale in this movie, torn between love and the gritty reality of the LA underworld. Robert Patrick, Michael Pena, and Haley Strode, among others, offered up memorable contributions. The squads even multi-racial! Id like to have seen more of Nick Nolte; hes fantastic in roles like this- see The Tin Red Line, Mulholland Falls, and the 2 48 hours movies. He even spoofs the type in Tropic Thunder.

Los Angeles is my fu*#in destiny roars Sean Penns Mickey Cohen, and you believe he means it. The destiny of LA is up for grabs in 1949, and no tactic is too brutal for either side to employ in this battle for supremacy. I identify with the cops, the streetwise enforcers from another era, reminiscent of Dirty Harry exclaiming, Im all broken up about his rights!

The final shootout is good, but probably not as memorable as Scarface .That film sets the standard for operatic shootout/death scenes. Recommended for action fans.",1415750400,,1694,4.9125874125874125

4865474,2,B005S9ELVC,"Gangster Squad
 What a stellar cast we have in Gangster Squad.  Sean Penn plays 1940s gangster Mickey Cohen-a murderous real life thug and ladies man whose girlfriends included Tempest Storm, Candy Bar and Beverly Hills.  In the movie his lady friend is Emma Stone who is drop dead beautiful in slinky evening gowns.  Ryan Gosling is effective in an under stated role as one of the squad members.  Josh Brolin, Michael Pena, Giovanni Ribisi and Robert Patrick are other name actors and squad members.  What a shame to have so much talent squandered on a film so lacking in dramatic interest.  It isn't a terrible movie but with such a fine cast we really expect a film to match the actors.  Other films set in post war L.A. have been done much better, see L.A. Confidential or Chinatown for comparison.
 Penn as Cohen-a notorious gangster who made headlines and had a fan base in real life-opens the film by pulling another gangster apart using cables and two cars.  This set the tone for the film.  Irrational violence is done with expert professionalism by director Ruben Fleischer.  The culminating battle has the cops of the Gangster Squad absurdly facing off against Cohens thugs with Tommy guns at a range of 40 feet.
 The romance between the gangsters moll (Stone) and the young copper (Gosling) doesnt make much sense either.  I am an Emma Stone fan boy and the more screen time she gets the better I like it but I can still recognize that the moll/cop romance is stupid.  Sometimes we suspend our disbelief, often in fact.  But we want a reward greater than stilted writing and irrational violence.  Director Rubin Fleischer also directed the very entertaining Zombieland, also with Emma Stone, so we know he can make excellent films.
 The producers must be faulted for entrusting the script to first time writer Will Beall.  With a budget of $60 million they could have afforded enough talent to make us love, like or at least be interested in the characters.  The best developed and most likeable character is the very minor character of the wife of squad leader Josh Brolin.  She has some good lines in the very few minutes she has on screen.  Sadly, she is the only one who does.
 The disappointing Gangster Squad rates a subpar two saw blades.  Fans of mediocre cops and gangsters films will still enjoy it as will Emma Stone fans.  But this is far from the best of the genre and a tragic waste of a top shelf cast.
 Gangster Squad is rated R for lots of violence, some of it pretty gross.  It has pulled in a thin $31 million so far and might struggle to get the producers money back.  That should teach them a lesson.  Make better movies.",1411257600,,2654,4.611111111111111

The characters are borderline silly and just copies of other characters in a million other bad movies.....The hard working boss, the ladies man, the tech nerd, the hard boiled chief, etc.  And not to be indiscreet but given the LAPDs history, having two minorities on this hand picked squad is pretty much just modern PC for the audience's benefit.  The only bright spot is Sean Penn.  He is perfect in this role as he was in All the Kings men.  I regret buying this but it was not for rental yet.

What is unique about the Gangster Squad is it tells the story honestly. I includes the mistakes that were made, it shows how some of their own guys got made and how if you can find the bad guys hangout...you can be damn sure they can find yours. Overall the movie was entertaining.

4865691,5,B005S9ELVC,"Gangster Squad is set in 1940s Los Angeles, CA based on a novel of the same name.  The set production team did an awesome job giving the feeling of the era with the appropriate clothing, settings and mostly automobiles.  Dirty cops, politicians and gangsters - it's what makes the city tick.

Josh Brolin as Sgt. John O'Mara, a Korean War hero turned Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detective is charged by a grizzled Nick Nolte as the LAPD's chief to take in gangster Mickey Cohen played by Sean Penn.  In my book, this was one of Penn's finest pieces of work.  He pulls off the gangster with ease.

A supporting crew of LAPD detectives and officers handpicked by O'Mara's wife, Connie O'Mara (Mireille Enos) consisted of Michael Pe&ntilde;a as Christmas/Navidad Ramirez, sidekick to the transplanted Texan cowboy cop Max Kennard wonderfully played by Robert Patrick.  Kennard (Patrick) would rather his six-shooter than any machine gun on the street.  As he said he would ""... dance with the one who brung me"".

1940s techie Conwell ""Con"" Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi), and I wondered if they intentionally named him ""Con"" as he was the conscience of the group, was the whiz-bang tech guru of the time.  Anthony Mackie played Coleman Harris, a knife throwing Harlem-type officer who often commented about dying in Burbank.

Ryan Goslin as Jerry Wooters and Emma Stone as Grace Faraday round out the excellent cast.  Once you watch this movie you'll want to see it again.  And you're like me, and again and again.",1396742400,2,1514,4.890196078431373

4865693,2,B005S9ELVC,"I love this sort of movie, which is why it gets any stars. Sean Penn was well cast and the media standing around getting photos of him provided some good comic relief. That is about it for the good points.

On the bad points, there was nothing new in the movie. The end was right out of Lethal Weapon, More came from The Untouchables and The Road to Perdition. The manner in which the Thompson machine guns was almost as absurd as Schwartzeneger in Predator. Those weapons were typically held sideways so the incredible recoil would work to spray an area. Handling them with one in each hand like a small caliber handgun in this movie was silly, but I suppose it was OK for those looking to escape into the violence of the era.

The movie started out saying ""inspired by a true story"", but the final lines claiming that such actions helped insure that LA never be infiltrated by the gangs was just ridiculous and seemed like they were trying to make it sound like the movie was ""based upon a true story,"" not inspired. However, it took very little thought to return to the fiction of the movie when I gave a bit of thought to it. The mob never got a hold of LA? I doubt that very much. Then of course, there is the truth about gang activity in the city.",1395705600,,1253,4.305084745762712

4865697,2,B005S9ELVC,"Bland. The sum it all up -- it is a soulless, bland, unfunny, uninteresting movie. I did really enjoy Josh Brolin's performance though as it was the only real hooking point for me to not turn off the movie. You can see he is really mining his character for something interesting and he succeeds. I blame the uninspired script and direction for how a movie with this much genuine talent can make such a mediocre and disappointing movie.

I hate using the word ""hammy"" but if there was anybody out there who says that Sean Penn's Mickey Cohen character was too hammy for its own good, I wouldn't argue with them at all. It wasn't a bad portrayal as it was a misguided one and one that would have been perfect in Dick Tracy.

Ryan Gosling, who was great in Drive is...absolutely terrible here.  Ryan Gosling I believe was woefully miscast here because the stuff he said and did really irked me the wrong way. He is suppose to come off as the silent but dangerous right hand man of Brolin's character but came across as someone I wanted Mickey Cohen to bury alive in some remote desert or something. He is a major reason why I didn't like this movie. He is by far the most annoying character for me.

The movie felt off from the get-go maybe because it was way too by-the-numbers gangster/cop flick and so it didn't have a real identity of its own. The best example is Guy Ritchie gangster movies and Quentin Tarrantino gangster movies. Very similar style, dialogue, music, pacing, structure, plot, and characters but despite all the major and minor similarities...they are their own movie and I enjoy both because of it.

Gangster Squad, as a whole, does not distinguish itself from others like it. It is simply nothing special and nothing you will want to revisit anytime soon.

Kind of SPOILER PARAGRAPH BELOW

Spoiler Warning:

Spoiler!!!
-----------------
I love cliche action flicks. I don't care how many times I see in movies that the bad guy kills the best friend of the protagonist. Or the protagonist falls in love with the mistreated and unloved woman of the bad guy. Or how the useless henchman can't shoot anything to save their lives (literally) when they outnumber the cops 4-1 in an ambush. The bad guy has a one on one showdown with the main protagonist.

End of Spoilers
---------------------------

It didn't go anywhere new and it definitely didn't do anything better than the previous movies it copies. Skip this movie, you will not miss anything worth experiencing.",1395014400,2,2484,4.689655172413793

4865759,2,B005S9ELVC,"Gangster Squad, 2013 film

The movie begins with the story of boxer Mickey Cohen. The narrator says Los Angeles changed after the war (the effects of prosperity?). A man from Chicago gets a message to take back. Later a man picks up a young woman at a bus station. A policeman follows her into the room. There are shots and fighting. ""Welcome to Los Angeles."" Those who resist are arrested. The judge releases them. Is Mickey Cohen protected by the Establishment? Sgt. John O'Mara returns home to his wife. When a brothel is raided the operators have to find a new location. [Shooting the scenes at night keeps expenses down.] One policeman visits a loan shark and sees who else is there.  Jerry talks to a woman at the bar. ""Who's running this town?"" Sgt. O'Mara meets Darryl Gates, the driver for Chief Bill Parker.

Chief Bill Parker talks about the soul of Los Angeles. There is a need to fight the enemy that is occupying Los Angeles. Guerilla warfare against Mickey Cohen will destroy his establishments. O'Mara talks to his wife, she is against his plans. Other candidates are investigated. One man is an expert with a pistol, another with wires. Mickey Cohen is a celebrity. Jack warns Mickey Cohen, he has friends in Chicago. Later the squad will take down a casino in Burbank: destroy the equipment, burn the money, be gone in ten minutes. But the Burbank police protect this casino! Some of the raiders are captured. [Can gambling, vice, and drugs exist without local political tolerance?]  This is news that is not fit to print.] A man with a tommy gun opens fire from the street! The prisoners in Burbank are released, just in time. The real money is in betting, says Cohen. The squad practices pistol shooting in the country. Can they plant a microphone in Cohen's house? [Using the telephone exchange avoids risks.] This microphone is planted inside.

An informant is questioned about a shipment. Can it be intercepted? There is a running gun battle on the highway. [No other traffic?] Mickey's men get an early retirement. ""It worked."" There is a penalty for failure. The squad has a barbecue. Chief Parker tells them to accelerate their schedule. Another gambling joint is raided and destroyed. The press asks who is attacking mob-run businesses? Cohen orders an all-out war on these men, their families, kids, etc. Cohen plans to monopolize all the gambling on the West Coast. Can they find the bank and destroy it in time? The gang enters a night club to search for the headquarters. The money is burned, those who resist are shot. Cohen is enraged and orders the perpetrators found. The burned money is a clue.

They hear Cohen talk about a drug shipment in Chinatown. Grace warns Jerry. Does Cohen suspect anyone? A car explodes in fire, a lot of shooting follows. Cohen talks about his past. Men is a car machine gun a house. Cohen and his boys talk to Jerry. Sgt. O'Mara seeks revenge. [Is this the end of the squad?] Chief Parker tells the bad news to O'Mara, he will be replaced by a man more amenable to Cohen. [Why does the Establishment work this way?] John is a hero, but he lost the war. Grace returns to Jerry, she is his witness. The judge signs an arrest warrant for Mickey Cohen, who is warned. Tommy guns neutralize Cohen's bodyguards. [There is enough shooting for a war movie.] Can Cohen escape? Can O'Mara catch that Packard? Is this the end of Mickey? There is last boxing match. ""Take him away."" There is a final word about the aftermath. ""The mob never had a foothold in Los Angeles""

Is this movie ""inspired by true facts"" or another Hollywood drama? When Cohen goes to prison who will fill the vacuum for gambling, vice, drugs, etc.? Was there really no organized crime there? This is really a good story unless you question some of the details.",1393545600,,3788,4.670164917541229
4865760,1,B005S9ELVC,"""Gangster Squad"" is unbelievably, insultingly crappy. There is no substance whatsoever, with flat characters, over-stylized violence, and gaping holes in the script.

4865761,1,B005S9ELVC,"I thought I was going to see something special and was I disappointed.  First of all - Sean Penn went way overboard on his overacting so much so It was cartoonish, something like Al Pacino in Dick Tracy.  In many scenes with Penn it got really funny because of his overacting.  That took away from the other actors who weren't bad.  Then every action sequence was at night - with some scenes not watchable because of it being so dark.  It's a one time watchable film and after that never again.",1393027200,,494,4.384615384615385
4865762,4,B005S9ELVC,"The opening title card announces that this film is inspired by true events.  It certainly wasn't inspired by reality or originality for that matter.  It plays like a cross between Brian De Palma's ""The Untouchables"" and Curtis Hanson's ""L.A. Confidential"" without the artistry of those films.  It serves its purpose, however, by being consistently entertaining and it is a handsome looking film expertly capturing the ambience of 1949 Los Angeles.  Standouts are Ryan Gosling as one of the group of maverick police officers recruited to bust the Mickey Cohen gang and Sean Penn does a pretty good turn as Cohen careful not to chew the scenery.  If you're not expecting a lot you won't be disappointed.",1392940800,,701,5.008620689655173
4865763,3,B005S9ELVC,"Lots of machine gun fire, as a secret, off-the-books cadre of cops led by Josh Brolin is tasked with ridding LA of gangster Mickey Cohen.  Sean Penn is miscast as Mickey Cohen, overacts, and looks ridiculous in gangster makeup.  Nick Nolte as the police chief also does his share of mugging.  Ryan Gosling plays a cop with little by way of dramatic range.  The plot is fairly predictable.  The good guys interdict and destroy some of Cohen's drug shipments and his wire service gambling operation, and put a wiretap on his place.  The art direction and action sequences are generally good.  The film culminates in a massive gun battle between a virtual army of Cohen henchmen holed up in a swanky hotel and the members of the Gangster Squad.  The script is serviceable but quite predictable, at times a bit hackneyed.  Overall, the enterprise has a sort of cops-and-robbers simplistic air about it.

First, it's a comic book flick that bears no resemblance whatever to the riveting, gritty, nonfiction book about the real gangster squad that took down Micky Cohen in L.A. If you liked the book, you'll hate the movie.

This mess was obviously designed to look like a Batman flick for 10 year old video gamers, but is so boring it's hard to imagine even a kid staying interested in it for long.

This is what happens when Hollywood panders to the lowest common denominator, dumbed-down demographic who wouldn't know a good film if they saw it. The 'characters' are cardboard cut outs with zero development. What there is of a story is strictly by the numbers and so over-baked it's totally underwhelming.

The acting was great and what you would expect from a movie based in that time period.  The mood is rough but has some heart in the few moments that require it.  The trailer had 'gangsta' music and I guess that sells to some people but don't expect the movie to have any of that.  The soundtrack is dramatic and aged appropriately.  I really enjoyed the choice of songs.  The little bit of narrative at the beginning and end gave it a touch of noir, as did the sub-plot to 'save the girl from the evil that she didn't mean to be a part of'.  The special features are entertaining and somewhat educational.  I wish I would've seen it in the theater but I'm glad to at least now own the blu-ray.",1387929600,,830,4.269230769230769

4865908,3,B005S9ELVC,"Gangster Squad is an entertaining film about an off-the-books crew of Los Angeles cops who try to take down Mickey Cohen, the baddest, most powerful gangster around. It is straightforward action with an appropriate amount of drama sprinkled throughout. If you like shoot-em-up gangster films complete with car chases, fist fights, and tommy guns, look no further. If you're looking for something original that tries to distance itself from worn out clichs, you will hate Gangster Squad.

Some examples of the clichs I'm talking about:

-Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is so brutal to his cronies it's amazing anyone wants to work for him at all.
-Sergeant O'Mara (Josh Brolin) cannot give up the bad-guy-busting lifestyle, and his wife (Mireille Enos) complains accordingly.
-Mickey's girl (Emma Stone) is actually Jerry's (Ryan Gosling) girl, but she struggles to break from Mickey and his money.
-The gangster squad begins to question the morality of its mission.
-Corrupt cops, politicians, and judges abound; they create problems every time the film needs more drama.
-Faceless bad guys go down easy, but central characters waltz through crossfire from submachine guns unscathed.

...And many more. The gangster squad itself is made up of every cop clich in film. Their leader (Brolin) is the tough, go-hung, incorruptible hero. Jerry (Gosling) is the burned out cop who doesn't think the gangster squad can make a difference. Harris (Anthony Mackie) is the token black cop who is really good with a knife. Kennard (Robert Patrick) is the weathered gunslinger who only fights with his six-gun. Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) is the tech-savvy brains of the bunch. Navidad (Michael Pena) is the tag-along who looks up to Kennard and tries to prove himself. By the end of the movie it's all quite boring, really.

While enjoyable and action-packed, there really is nothing special about Gangster Squad aside from its all-star cast. The clichs keep it from ever getting too interesting or dramatic (because we all know the movie is destined to end in a shootout where men on both sides will surely die) and really only serve to undermine a story that had potential. Don't get your hopes up for an inside look at Mickey's operation or intricate character development, either. For better or worse, this one is all action.",1387152000,,2308,5.097883597883598

And there never would have been a Black and Mexican on a special squad of Police. Mickey Cohen was a lousey Boxer losing the majority of his professional bouts four(4) by knockouts. He was sent to prison for income tax evasion twice. The last time he recieved retribution for one of his murders. he did not kill Dragna. However Dragna made several attempts on Cohen's Life without success On  February 23, 1956, Dragna died of a heart attack in Los Angeles. Street shootouts did not take place thatis a result of recent gangs in Los Angeles. The Real Cohen was nothing like that. A shrewd political calculator and sharp dresser who reportedly did not smoke or drink and held progressive racial views, Cohen endured as a force in L.A. society long after his fictional demise in this movie. These facts have been published and written about for Years. There was a much better story to be told from both sides.

However, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this film to anyone who holds filmmaking, acting, or storytelling in high regard. The movie feels like a bunch of high-caliber actors were given a really weak script, and the director, given this much talent and this flimsy of a story, really had no direction, no singular point of view. It's all very jumbled and not very compelling. The acting is bad, overacted in order to compensate for the weak material, and the dialogue is just ridiculous.

""Gangster Squad"" is violent, I'll give it that. I'm usually not that off-put by violence so long as it is in service to the story, see ""Boardwalk Empire,"" ""The Departed,"" etc. However, given that I couldn't care less about the story or the characters, the violence seemed gratuitous.

4866141,4,B005S9ELVC,"Another terrific movie that missed its audience, thanks to a studio's lousy marketing campaign I presume. The DVD had several previews apparently aimed at teenagers, one for a vampire/witch type movie, a video game, an animated movie that looked like a video game. No previews for smart, adult movies. Seems like the studio took this smart and stylish period drama and tried to make it seem like older kids would like it? When it was due to be released the first time in theaters, the Colorado mass theater murders had taken place, and Gangster Squad's release was pushed back. Not sure what happened after that, but it seemed to open and close in theaters without a peep. Many reviews here are negative. I have not read them yet. I like to write my own first.

This is a really good period action drama with lots of star power, great acting, fantastic action scenes, and a complex and interesting story. We watched the DVD last night and my husband said a couple of times, ""I love this! It moves so fast!"" (Heads up for those who do not like any violence or gore: there is quite of bit of that. It is fairly stylized and creative, but when it happens, it is gory. There are many killings...this is a movie about crime gangs.)

Gangster Squad, based on a book of the same name, and based on a true story of a real crime boss in LA, is rich in period detail, including the final credits on painted ""postcards"" evoking 1940s/1950s Los Angeles landmarks. The plot, in which chiseled-jaw leading man and stand-up guy John (Josh Brolin) decides he can't let the bad guys win, and puts together an all-star squad of law enforcers to clean up LA, reminded me a lot of The Untouchables; you just love the guys, and pull for them, cheering them on. Their intricate plan to disable the crime machine in LA reminded me at times of yet another period action drama I love, The Sting.

6.  Oh yeah, the good guy banging the bad guy's woman was warned by a friend not to but...he did anyway of course ""Gotta die of something""
7.  The bad guy is super angry and does pretty much nothing but lose his temper the whole movie

9.  The ""secret team"" is immediately tracked down by the cowboy's partner, who wasn't invited, and uses the line ""Good enough to get the drop on you guys"" and instantly is on the team.
10. A single team member dies igniting the teams collective passion
11. Protagonist is saved at the last second by dying member #2 before defeating the bad guy in fisticuffs
12. Of course there is the 5 minute part of how the team is recruited and they all got a tiny moment to be cool
13. Secret team's first mission is a disaster

15. Goodest guy quits the force after bad guy is caught
16. Second goodest guy gets the hot girl that used to be the bad guy's

4866290,3,B005S9ELVC,"Ruben Fleischer's GANGSTER SQUAD has a number of things that are appealing about it. First, it has some great actors in Sean Penn, who plays the infamous Mickey Cohen here, as well as Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Anthony Mackie, Michael Pena, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Patrick, Mirelle Enos and Nick Nolte. Second, it's set in post-WWII Los Angeles, which, since the success and greatness of Curtis Hanson's L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, has been rife for storytelling opportunites. Third, it has the classic ""small group of men take on the entire mob"" trope that's worked well for decades.

But while it has all those things, it ultimately falls too far short of being really good cinema by degenerating into a series of dull cliches, poor characterization and orgiastic, videogame-like violence. The characters are lifted from any number of previous law vs. mob films; Brolin is the stalwart, staunch, straight-laced leader, Gosling is the morally conflicted boozer and lady-killer, Mackie is the switchblade-wielding badass, Ribisi is the nerdy technical guy, Patrick is the grizzled, somewhat-racist old-timer gunslinger, Stone is the husky-voiced femme fatale, and Penn is the bat-poop crazy king of the mob. They're all tropes, which is fine, but if the actors even dared to delve outside the mold of these recycled characterizations, they might have had something special on their hands. But director Fleischer wasn't going to have any of that. This was pure, uncut Hollywood-designed filmmaking ready-made for mass consumption, which is fun enough to watch once, because it does look quite stunning, but if it somehow leaves an impression after you're done watching, you are clearly the audience this film was made for.",1377388800,,1724,5.291970802919708

It's an old fashioned black hats vs. white hats, but the white hats get dirty.  The characters are compelling, and only say as much as they need to - so listen up.  The action rolls fast and builds momentum so that the suspense is tight up to the very satisfying end.  Real romance, violence that's better left seen than read about, and characters you can believe in even if you don't want to.  Oh, and it's based on a true story.  ...Are you watching it yet?

4866501,2,B005S9ELVC,"Gangster Squad was one of those movies that didn't generate a lot of buzz on the movie circuit but had me all hyped up anyway. With a cool premise and all-star studded cast, coupled with the fact that it's supposed to be inspired by true events (a story I'm vaguely familiar with), I figured I was in it for the win. God, I hate it when I'm wrong! Movies that are ""inspired by true events"" should always be followed by a disclaimer that it will play fast and loose with both the historical accuracy and details of the actual story. In all fairness, I really should've should known better.

Basically, Gangster Squad is one of those movies that talks the talk but it doesn't walk the walkIt's superficial in that it looks the part but in no way can it run with the big boys. It's all bark and no bite, see. I think you get the point. It actually reminded me a lot of my recent Great Gatsby experience in that the focus seems to be more on the outer surface than the inner core. There's no arguing that it's a beauty to look at --- it's slick and stylised with a neo-noir sort of feel---but the violence is cartoonish, the dialogue hollow and the characters are all parodies of what mobsters and cops should be.

And I think that's the thing that surprised me most. We have this amazingly talented cast, yet no one really manages to break out of their stock gangster stereotype. It felt like they were all fighting eachother for the spotlight and the result was that not one of them managed to shine. I guess you really can't do much with a bland character thanks, in part, to poor development and writing. I'd also like to note that the Sean Penn - Emma Stone coupling really creeped me out here. Just... gross. And while we're on the subject of Sean Penn (and his character)--- he's too much. There's too much drama, too much make-up, too much of everything. Sean Penn was way over-the-top with his characterisation of Cohen and hecame off comical, not dangerous. Essentially, he was the embodiment of every stereotypical villainous trait you could think of. Controlling over his woman. Oh yeah. Former boxing champ. Yep. Maniacal laughter. Yep. Cheesy bad-guy quips. Yep. Inefficient henchmen. You betcha. It was near impossible to take him seriously! Even Gosling, who is apparently super choosy about his roles, was less than impressive. Well, as less than impressive as a specimen such as himself can possibly be.

This is one of those films you've seen before, only everyone else did it better. Don't let your expectations get the best of you like they did with me. While it's all wrapped up in shiny and pretty packaging, it's totally lacking where it counts the most. Very few movies can pull off being so high on action and artfully shot (i.e. - Drive). Gangster Squad is shooting blanks.

Food for Thought: Gangster Squad is a movie loaded with promise and potential but, unfortunately, it fails in the execution. While it's an aesthetically pleasing film to watch, it's predictible. The dialogue borders on cheesy, the characters read as inauthentic and hollow and the villainy is too over-the-top. It's a real shame, given the talent, that no one manages to break the mold. This movie, overall, is unsubstantial and wholly unsatisfying and that makes me sad.",1375660800,,3269,4.670138888888889

4866569,3,B005S9ELVC,"Based on a true story (however loosely), the movie begins in 1949 Los Angeles, with gangster Mickey Cohen (played by Sean Penn) trying to run the city with the help of his crooked cops, paid for judges and politicians and a gang of thugs willing to act as executioner on his behalf. You know, typical gangster fare. Even the introduction of the team of cops willing to take him down is pretty typical of a mob movie.

But where this movie gets a little different is the lengths the police will go to take down Mickey Cohen - almost becoming gangsters themselves as they operate outside the law - all in a bid to ultimately uphold the law.

Sergeant John O'Mara (played by Josh Brolin) heads up this team of cops. He's a former World War II soldier who wants to get rid of the mob out of LA so he can live in a peaceful city with his family (his wife is heavily pregnant throughout much of the movie).

Now I could give you a blow-by-blow (and there is lots of blowing apart in the movie) account, but if you've read my book reviews, you'll know that's not how I do things.

When I chose this movie, I chose it for my husband who, like most men, loves any movie that involves lots of fighting and lots of blood loss (there's a reason his favourite actor is Bruce Willis). I really didn't think I would like it at all, and was all prepared to zone out on my phone while he had his little testosterone fill.

And I did zone out, for the first quarter of the movie but then I found myself looking up more often, and asking lots of questions. I got the obligatory eye-roll that told me I should have been paying attention from the start, so I had to try to pick up the trail myself.

Maybe I was being a bit shallow, but my interest levels did pique when Ryan Gosling became the focal point of the movie. Hey, don't judge me. He's pretty to look at. Ryan is one of the Gangster Squad but he's having an affair with one of Mickey Cohen's girls (played by the stunning Emma Stone).

The action was a little over-the-top at times, particularly the dead-eye-dick shooting in the midst of a storm of automatic bullets. Sean Penn was a little cartoonish in his role as Mickey Cohen. I much prefer it when they show dual sides of the villain. Not everyone is all good, just as not everyone is entirely bad. We all have elements of both in us and it depends which side we feed more.

But as pure entertainment, it was quite good, as long as you suspend your belief and remember it is only `loosely' based on truth.

BUT IT'S FUN! It's not the greatest film in the world, It's not the next godfather or goodfellas, but it wasn't trying to be like those films. It was trying to be an all out good time, and by god, did it succeed. If you want ""the godfather"", Go watch ""the godfather"",but if you want true old school gangster action, go watch this film.

  Granted, I've actually never watched the godfather, or scar face, and the closest I got to watching good fellas was Animaniacs, but those are on my to watch list. In fact, the only other gangster movie I saw was ""Johnny Dangerously"", which is hilarious by the way. But still, I think that this was a good place to start.

  True, this film isn't accurate when it comes to the real life story of the ""gangster squad"" and Mickey Cohen, but it's a film. A ton of other ""Based On A True Story""  films are pure BS, so what makes this any different?

  When it comes down to it, this is a film that you just have to take it for what it is, and what it is, is entertaining as hell. Plus, this film actually makes Ryan Gosling Badass, and that is a nearly impossible task to do.

But even this concept, a one atom deep reality, gives it a bit too much gravity.  It expresses ideas, but poorly.  It staggers from place to place as if it is some sort of drunk lout.  It keels over backwards, passed out and then urinates upon itself.

This excrescence is the sort of movie one might have expected to emerge from the propaganda bureau of a police state government.  However, that said, it would not come from a sophisticated police state.  No, it could only be the result of a police state run by those sorts of policemen who bash in the heads of children in front of television cameras or who participate in murders and rapes and record it all on their phone so they can show their friends.

But Gangster Squad is far worse than just another poorly-made film. It deserves to be condemned because of its profoundly evil theme. It actively promotes police violence and extreme government authoritarianism.

The core message of Gangster Squad, repeated from beginning to end, is that sometimes police have to abandon the law and use criminal methods to fight crime, and that this is a good and heroic thing to do.

Gangster Squad celebrates and cheers on extreme police violence and murder, illegal police wiretapping, warrantless searches, and in general police lawbreaking of all kinds.

This is a vile and repugnant message that is a great danger to a free society.

Ideas have consequences. Art - even extremely bad art, like this film - can deeply influence minds. I shudder to think of police, lawmakers, and citizens watching Gangster Squad and thinking, ""Yeah, that's right, sometimes you just have to ignore the law for a greater good.""

Imagine a badly-made film that promoted rape, or racism, or murder. Most people would agree that it should be condemned. That is also the appropriate response to Gangster Squad. It is despicable trash promoting a dangerous police state agenda.",1372291200,2,1343,5.194444444444445

Movie made me think of Watchman meets Boardwalk empire TV-series. Fast action movie that moves along at a pretty moderate rate, never wasting on screen time or filling in.

The best way to describe this flick is as a bad imitation of LA Confidential.  It tries to copy the character struggles but ends up coming off as too transparent and unbelievable.  It also is highly stylized, to the point where the costume and props are distracting to the story.  But the worst part is the screenplay, which seems like it was written without the benefit of any revisions whatsoever.  Most scenes have no transitions and the characters are insultingly simple and cliched.

Its just a shame that more time wasn't spent on the screenplay becausemthe efforts of the cast were still pretty solid considering.

All in all I'm left wondering how this screenplay could have been greenlighted.  You would think there would be some kind of review process to inject some semblance of logic and realism.

Well, it wouldn't make any difference, except that the true story of Mickey Cohen and Chief Parker is far more interesting than than this simple cops and robbers story.  Parker is shown (barely) as a model of virtue and Mickey Cohen, who apparently charmed the pants off of everyone from Bugsy Segal to Billy Graham is shown as a standard movie psychopath.  Along the way, people are killed who didn't actually die and the end is more like Sands of Iwo Jima than what really happened.

Other than a lack of complexity to the characters and the overall fiction of the story, Gangster Squad is beautifully shot, well acted and occasionally cleverly written.  It is way better than Mulholland Falls which is another take on the same story but more of a downer.  As an afterthought, a true period piece would not have shown the violence so graphically but again, this is strictly a modern day retelling of a story that never happened.",1371340800,,1175,4.7772277227722775

4866942,2,B005S9ELVC,"In the first five minutes of ""Gangster Squad,"" one man is torn in half at the midsection, while another has his hand lopped off by an elevator. And that's just for starters.

Set in 1949 Los Angeles, this low-rent version of ""L.A. Confidential"" mixed with ""The Untouchables"" is based on the true-life account of Mickey Cohen, a Chicago mobster who's using prostitution, drug running and gambling as a means of building his own empire on the west coast. Trouble is, in the process, he's managed to not only alienate his former partners back in the Midwest but to fire up law enforcement in L.A. (those not already in his back pocket, that is) who feel that he will soon take over the city if he isn't stopped.

Enter homicide detective Sergeant John O'Mara, an upstanding Irish war hero who's been assigned the unenviable task of driving Cohen out of business by whatever means necessary. This involves gathering together a merry band of like-minded, trustworthy individuals (the ""gangster squad"") who'll help him do the job. But how far outside of the law are they willing to go to bring about their desired end?

As directed by Ruben Fleischer, ""Gangster Squad"" could not possibly feel more halfhearted, enervating and hackneyed at this stage in movie history. The screenplay by Will Beall is practically an encyclopedia of mob movie stereotypes and cliches, and the dialogue and voice-over narration are often jaw-dropping in their banality.

Sean Penn scowls his way through the part of Cohen, while Josh Brolin, as O'Mara, sleepwalks through his. Ditto for Ryan Gosling, Nick Nolte, Emma Stone and ""The Killing's"" Mireille Enos, whose roles here are unworthy of their not inconsiderable talents.

With so many fine crime dramas floating around, both in movies and on TV, there's really no reason to settle for so thoroughly generic an offering as ""Gangster Squad.""",1371081600,,1868,4.993569131832797

4867008,4,B005S9ELVC,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

It's 1949 and Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is running Los Angles. A man who defines the term ""crime boss"" as he's not only the top cheese in the criminal underworld, but he also has both the police and judiciary on his payroll. In an attempt to bring Cohen to justice, Bill Parker (Nick Nolte) hand picks war veteran Sgt. John O'mara (Josh Brolin) to start an operation to do whatever he feels necessary to take this man down. With the help of his wife Connie (Mireille Enos), John rounds up a group of five guys to assist him.

Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), Office Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie), Officer Conway Keeler (Giovanni Rivisi), Officer Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena), and Officer Max Kennard (Robert Patrick). These are the five men John chooses. Each with different personalities and a different set of skills. Jerry is your run-of-the-mill pretty boy who falls for Cohen's lover Grace Faraday (Emma Stone), Coleman is a good shooter who's skilled with knives, Conway is the brains, Max is a quick shot who's almost always dead-on, and Navidad is a young officer who looks up to Max. A diverse group of men which allows for some interesting banter between the six of them.

As a whole I thought the story was solid. When you go into films that are based off of a true story there's always going to be changes and fabrications so don't expect a perfect depiction of what went down. Also, because it's a gangster film things can get somewhat repetitive about halfway through, but that's to be expected. With that said, Gangster Squad is able to keep your attention because of the characters you're presented with. It may not always do a great job of fleshing out these characters (Grace & Navidad are the best examples here), but I found myself feeling for Jerry and even Conway, to some extent. Plus, even with the underdeveloped characters it's easy to fall in love with all of them due to their chemistry on screen.

Surprise surprise, Gangster Squad is filled with violence, a lot of it. Apparently this was an issue with the big reviewers, but I'm not sure what they were expecting. Either way, if you or the company you chose to watch this with aren't a fan of really violent movies then I would recommend skipping this at all cost. From start to finish the violence is non-stop as you go from firefights to fist fights to stabbings. Then you rinse and repeat. This is definitely a hard ""R"" in terms of violence, but, as I said, it's kind of expected. It's a movie about a group of cops trying to take down a notorious gangster. If you're looking for rainbows and unicorns you're looking at the wrong movie.

If watching movies is a hobby of yours then expect to recognize a few familiar faces. Chances are you've seen all six of these cops in something prior to this and Emma Stone and Sean Penn aren't strangers to the big screen either. With that said, just like the story, the performances in Gangster Squad are solid. No one really stood out or took my breath away, but at the same time no one really bombed either. The entire cast was able to give enjoyable performances that managed to keep my attention the entire way through. Even though the story follows these six cops, a lot of focus is put on John and Mickey. So most of the dialogue is coming from either Josh Brolin or Sean Penn. Thankfully both of them are able to hold their own and carry the movie for its two hour running time.

Finally, the score, provided by Steve Jablonsky, is kind of a mixed bag. At times I really loved it because it felt perfect during the scene I was currently watching, but then there were other times where it just felt so out of place. It's almost as if the intensity level of the scene wasn't matching the intensity level of the composition. Of course, intense pieces are necessary in all films, but they have to feel right for their corresponding scenes. When the music is somehow distracting you from what you're watching it's no longer serving its purpose, it's just taking you out of the experience. Sadly, I found this to be a common occurrence while watching this film and it kind of hampered my enjoyment a bit.

Overall Score: 7/10 - The problem with Gangster Squad is that, at times, it seems to take itself a bit too seriously. Some of my favorite moments from the movie were when the six officers were just joking around and enjoying each others company. Now I know that would make for a boring film if that's all that we were given, but it seems to lack a consistent flow. Also, the casting was fantastic, but by the end of it I felt like I still didn't know who most of these characters were. You had a group of extremely talented performers, but none of their characters really got fleshed out. While Gangster Squad may not be one of the best films ever made, it's enjoyable enough to warrant a viewing. So if you were eyeing it in theaters then I would suggest giving it a rental.",1370908800,,4962,4.543624161073826

You will feel you are in post WWII Los Angeles.  From the daily lifes of the cops and their families to the gun battles in the warehouses and clubs of Cohen you get a great view of what it must have been like living in LA.  Great rental and probably well worth adding to your library.

4867141,3,B005S9ELVC,"Set in 1949, Los Angeles, ""Gangster Squad"" follows the story of an off-the-book team of police detectives tasked with bringing down Mickey Cohen, a mobster who rules the city. Directed by Ruben Fleischer, best known for his joyful and unpredictable ""Zombieland,"" the crime action drama lacks originality in spite of the beautiful photography and great cast including Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Nick Nolte, Robert Patrick, Michael Pea, Sean Penn, Giovanni Ribisi and Emma Stone.

Though ""Gangster Squad"" features several real-life figures such as police sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) and a gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), the storyline and episodes are mostly fictional. Some may criticize the film for its clichd story and typecast characters, but the fast-paced film is not boring thanks to the fine performances form the cast, impressive period details and gorgeous photography by Dion Beebe (""Chicago"" ""Memoirs of a Geisha"").

What the film needs is more intense conflict between O'Mara and Cohen. Interactions between the squad members are also weak. Generally speaking, if action sequences are not very thrilling, it is because audiences just don't care what is going to happen to these uninteresting characters.

It is reported that the film was re-shot because of the 2012 Colorado shooting. But I think the re-shooting has nothing to do with the workmanlike direction and by-the-numbers storytelling.

4867168,3,B005S9ELVC,"In my opinion this movie has a few flaws.  If you would like to know
  the true story of Micky Cohan, chick his biography on Mobsters.
  Micky Cohan was subordinate  to Bugsy  while Bugsy was  in Los Angeles. He
  was very short not shown in the movie. Micky went twice to prison but not
  on Murder Chaarges but Income Tax Evasion. He was hit in the head with a
  iron pipe not by Mafia sanctioned hit  but by a crazy inmate.
  As for the technal side. The audio is bad not in a technal cause but by the
  the Actors whispering or sluriing the words. There are lots of machine gune
  scenes where the viewer has problems in knowing  who is killing who.and why.
  Finally, this is no Casino and could never compare.",1369785600,,715,4.203007518796992

Individually, I like all of the actors in this film, however, Sean Penn came across as a cartoon version of himself (think Bugsy with Madonna).  I love Emma Stone, but this was not the film for her.  It is difficult to relate to her as the love interest of Sean Penn's character.  An actress that radiates more maturity would have been more believable.",1369785600,,495,4.444444444444445

4867177,4,B005S9ELVC,"Gangster squad is a movie about a secret crew of police officers led by two determined sergeants work together in an effort to take down the ruthless mob king Mickey Cohen who runs the city.  Although this movie is loosely based on the real story of LA police's takedown of Cohen, it is nevertheless an entertaining action film.  Maybe not a classic like other mob era films, this movie if taken for what it is, an action film is a good movie to watch.  Sean Penn gives an outstanding performance as mob boss Cohen and the rest of the cast is solid as well in their roles.  The movie is at times a bit uneven in both the plot, action and character development which detracts from it being a five star movie and a movie in a class of the other classics in this genre.

4867237,1,B005S9ELVC,"Are you looking for every bad action-drama cliche ever used since the early 50s? Well my friend, look no further! Here is what this film has to offer:

1. Headstrong cop that refuses to play by the rules.
2. Histrionic mob boss who kills anyone who gives him bad news.
3. Five good guys charge fifty bad guys armed with gatling guns and, of course, win.
4. Dramatic good guy death scenes, complete with super-cheesy last words.
5. Really stupid good guys walk into a trap! Oh no!
6. Cop wife drama! Watch the pregnant wife of the dumb cop (see #1) wear your grandmother's tablecloth for a dress and get super upset at her husband for being such a reckless moron.

There are many more... the good cop who questions the harsh methods of the other good cops, the corrupt cops and judges who think that being evil is the bee's knees, etc. Pointing them all out could actually become a really fun drinking game.

Despite all the above, I think the moral of the story is that Nick Nolte will take whatever role he can because, let's be honest, he probably needs the scratch.

Overall, this is really funny film. I imagine Trey Parker and Matt Stone would enjoy it, but it isn't anything they haven't already made fun of.",1369180800,9,1214,4.454954954954955

Too bad the Academy will never recognize it because it isn't their kind of movie. I will admit, this wasn't an Academy Award winning movie, but Sean Penn was the best thing about it. He was a realistic villain. His performance was realistic and had depth. The plot was a tad thin, perhaps unoriginal, but well-done and promising for all involved. If you're not a snob, give this film a chance and enjoy. Some people can't enjoy a movie unless the critics do as well. Screw them, this was great. Enjoy.",1369180800,,614,4.6422018348623855
4867239,5,B005S9ELVC,"This movie turned out to be an excellent blend of brutal action, stylish period drama with sharp dialogue, and a little history.  The movie gives you just enough history to understand why Cohen was a big threat to California and why this tiny underdog team is basically on a suicide mission.  The protagonists are real men doing what needs to be done for no thanks, no credit, no money, no support, and no guarantee of success.  These are plain, rough, good guys facing off against a literal army of deeply scummy bad guys.

The actors are all superb.  Not one of the characters is played by a poor performer.  Even the goons on Cohen's payroll, the cops, and the minor players are faces you've seen before.  Penn is an enthralling evil and accurate gangster.  Not over-the-top, as some have complained.  He is frightening, unpredictable, and thoroughly evil.  A genuine threat at all times.  No dumby.  He's a cleverly evil guy with a big ego.  The Gangster Squad is a group of heroes, each very different from the other.  It is clear who is who and what is driving each guy.  The movie does not have one flawed actor.  Incredible performances keep you tied to the story.

The plot is full of realistic twists, character flaws, mistakes made by good guys and bad guys alike, thrilling action scenes, hit and run missions, and a final confrontation that is worth watching a few times.

Frankly, I wish we had a few Gangster Squads in America today.  This movie was a clear good versus evil flick based on reality.  The characters are all gray, yet lovable.  What an unexpectedly fun movie!  Worth a buy.",1369180800,,1603,4.629893238434164

The story line was compelling and I liked that they used the names of a couple of real police figures (Parker, & Gates) to infuse some sense of reality and relevance into the story line (well, if you are a native Angelino as I am then it provides the relevance).

The police characters are interesting and it played better for me than the Kevin Costner Untouchables movie, although, the present movie borrowed liberally from Costner's.

There is blood and gore in this movie, so the squeamish should be warned.  But, it wasn't as vile as better known mafia movies or HBO.  Emma Stone performed her role very convincingly and Brolin was surprisingly well suited for this movie too.",1369180800,,811,4.669014084507042

4867271,4,B005S9ELVC,I thought this was a nice popcorn action packed gangster flick with some pretty good actors in the lead roles. Emma Stone was way under used and same with Sean Penn because I think he could have been more sadistic at his role. Plot is pretty cut and dry with just a team of cops that don't play by the rules take on a big crime boss. You've seen all of this before and the movie is very predictable but for some reason I don't care maybe because it looks pretty while doing it because the way this movie is shot looks fantastic. Very good action scenes and pretty good acting save this everyday gangster copy from dying. I recommend it fully just for the action at least.,1368921600,2,671,4.25

Corruption was not new to City Leaders, Policemen and Union men however to step outside the law to FIGHT it was.....enter Sgt John O'Mara (Josh Brolin)--former decorated war veteran, hardened by his years in the war and a no-nonsense ethic he applies to his detective position with the LAPD; Sgt Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) content with getting along to insure a pension in 20 years, undergoing a slow realization that in order to enforce the law sometimes one must BREAK the law; Giovanni Ribisi (excellently cast) as the techno-geek officer who improvises listening devices to tap into Cohen's secret plans ; Michael Pena as a rookie cop eager to join up and be part of this team; and Robert Patrick the elder lawman who still holsters an old 6 shooter but with deadly accuracy (obviously not a fan of LAPD's snub .38 service weapon)  We now have the ingredients of Superhero Crime Fighters without the necessity of Miranandizing suspects or calling for the paddy wagon to arrest lawbreakers!

He brings on Sgt John O'Mara, played by Josh Brolin to head this secret squad. Sgt's wife played by Mirele Enos, (the US version of The Killing,star) helps him choose his squad. Ryan Gosling, is the most famous and difficult to get. Ryan is in love with Cohen's girlfriend, played by Emma Stone. That pretty much sums up the star power.

A lot of star power in ths film. A lot of guns, callous and brutal murder, violence and blood, so much blood. There is a semblance of a story, but not much of one. As I said, the best part of the film is the stars.

One of the few times when the extravagance of a film can actually bring a feel for the tenor of the times.

4867407,4,B005S9ELVC,"For all the `creative interpretations' of facts in and around the final days of Mickey Cohen, GANGSTER SQUAD proves to be a surprisingly entertaining evocation of post WW II Los Angeles - right down to the very clever use of posters and billboards used during the artistic running of the final credits! This movie captures Los Angeles better than most and in that setting it creates a credible story with a fine cast that, apart from the gore of dismembering a body attached to two opposing cars and a lot of bullets and killings, makes a case for the idea of a group of rogue cops bringing Mickey Cohen down.

In 949 Los Angeles gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) has moved in, with the intention of controlling all criminal activity in the city as well as an eye on the entire West Coast: his dream is to rid the crime world of the Chicago mobs' move to take over big crime in LA. He has bought local judges and police, and no one is willing to cross him or testify against him. Everyone except Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), a former World War II soldier, whose goal is to settle with his family in a peaceful Los Angeles. Police Chief William Parker (Nick Nolte) decides to form a special unit whose mission is to take down Cohen, and chooses O'Mara to lead the unit. O'Mara, with the help of his pregnant wife (Mireille Enos) chooses 4 cops (Anthony Mackie, Robert Patrick, Michael Pea, Giovanni Ribisi) and asks another cop and vet, pretty boy Jerry Wooters, to join him but Wooters is not interested: he incidentally is dating Cohen's current girlfriend (Emma Stone). But when he witnesses the murder of a young boy by Cohen's people, he joins them, and they decide to take apart Cohen's organization. Cohen wonders if a rival is going after him, but eventually he realizes it's the cops. The manner in which the dance between Cohen's henchmen and the gangster squad plays out is full of surprises and twist and turns and makes for solid entertainment. Based on a book by the same name by Paul Lieberman, adapted for the screen by Will Beall, and directed with skill by Ruben Fleischer, GANGSTER SQUAD may not be very close to the truth but is still is a fine movie diversion.

The premise involves a sanctioned but secret band of police officers who fight dirty to smash up a notorious and powerful gangster's seedy business. The whole adventure is actually inspired by a real life Gangster Squad whom you could guess probably were probably somewhat a little over exaggerated for this classic take on action feel. Also, this film is light on the drama, romance, and suspense but can be taken sincerely if you give it a chance.

Cohen was a scourge in LA for many years, but the creation of a special gangster squad as portrayed in the film is totally fictional. Fiction or no, the plot premise is excellent; but sadly descends into mediocrity, due to some very weak writing and poor direction by Robert Fleischer, who is mostly known for his comic films and is in over his head in this genre. That's a shame, because with the powerhouse cast it could have been so much better. Sean Penn delivers a fine performance as Cohen...few can portray a crime lord with the cold villainy of Penn and he doesn't disappoint. Other notable cast members include Josh Brolin as Sgt O'Hara; Nick Nolte as the Police Chief; Brian Gosling, Robert Patrick and Giovanni Ribisi as a key members of the squad; and Emma Stone as Cohen's moll and Gosling's love interest. Their characters are mostly undeveloped; and the beautiful and talented Stone is essentially wasted.

If you think Capone was bad, Cohen made him look like a saint.  It was his greed that did him in, and in 51 it was all over for the last great gangster. I will watch this movie again.

4867715,2,B005S9ELVC,"Wow. Truly incredible! An uncanny (and artistically disgraceful) almost-beat-for-beat transposition of De Palma's THE UNTOUCHABLES to post WWII Los Angeles. As a member of the Writers Guild, it pisses me off when an inferior derivation such as this one gets made and released, garnering a modicum of attention. I wish I could get specific without divulging spoilers--but I can't, so I won't. Suffice to say that by the time we learn what ultimately happens in the radio shack, I wanted to grab someone by the lapels and scream, ""Like we all didn't see that one coming!?"" (with apologies to Charles Martin Smith of the earlier film).
That most of the events in the third act of the film never really happened is also a bit annoying; sticking to the template of The Untouchables was, apparently, more alluring than that of reality. But, so what, right? It's just another Hollywood bio-pic, right?!",1367366400,,895,4.933774834437086

The characters all blended in well with each other. From Mickey Cohen's girlfriend to Josh Brolin's wife, the women who starred in the movie were great as well.  Sean Penn, excellent! !!!  He made you want to beat the hell out of him yourself!  The clothes were wonderful on both the male and female actors.
It is was not a modern, war of technology like most of the cops and bad guys we have today.
I would recommend this movie.",1367280000,,605,4.423423423423423
4867755,5,B005S9ELVC,I watched this movie and truly enjoyed it while it is violent gritty the acting is well done. I love the movies that are set in the 40's and 50's,1367280000,,145,3.8666666666666667
4867756,3,B005S9ELVC,"Given the acting talent, I was pretty pumped up to see this film in the build up to its release, but generally mediocre reviews kept me away from the theatre.  After getting around to seeing it now, I agree with the prevailing view that the movie is a decent piece of popcorn entertainment but that it seems content to settle for well-worn tropes and ultimately offers virtually nothing to distinguish it from a trough of other gangster films.  The plot is a formulaic 'malevolent gangster versus vigilante cops' and the dialogue is a second-rate Hammett that at times is cringe-inducing.  What makes it a worthwhile viewing experience in spite of those deficiencies are the frequent and well-executed action sequences, which, if a bit silly and over-the-top at times, are really fun to watch.  Also, the film develops a solid atmosphere through well-executed sets, music, and wardrobe.

Most of the characters are fairly one-dimensional, which does not give the actors much room for nuance.  Out of the leads, Sean Penn puts in the stand-out performance as mobster Mickey Cohen.  He seems to relish playing a truly diabolical dude.  Josh Brolin does pretty well as the simmering, itchy trigger fingered good guy, but I think Russell Crowe put in a more complex and interesting performance with a similar role in 'LA Confidential'.  With little room for exploration given the source material, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone seem content to phone in their respective roles as suave, carefree partner and femme fatale.

Overall, if you're like me and you find it intrinsically enjoyable to watch gangsters fire tommy guns at one another, you won't regret putting in the two hours to watch this movie.",1367193600,5,1695,5.0

4867760,4,B005S9ELVC,"I went in with an open mind and was entertained throughout. The movie never seems to lag and has pretty good action sequences. The acting pulls no punches and the story moves along rapidly from the start. The script isn't Goodfellas or Godfather, the directing is a bit more textbook, but that's what makes it fun. There's never a slow moment where I wish the scene was over like in many other talky movies. I would compare it to The Untouchables I guess. Again, that's not a bad thing, some movies take themselves too seriously and bore you to death with over-written scenes. The dialogue was crisp and funny as well.",1367193600,,618,4.576576576576577

4867792,5,B005S9ELVC,"Other reviewers may disagree with my review of this film but, it all depends what your likes and tastes are.  First, the film is based on a true story and gives the viewer what L.A. was like in the 40's.  Lots of neat 'period' shots and a story line that; although could have had a 'Hollywood'; ending, presents one that is based on fact, and still brings closure.  Josh Brolin does a great job, as does all the cast.  Only complaint is some of the scenes are a bit dark (underlit) and the dialog can get covered up by the background tracks.  Think of this as the prequel to L.A. Confidential.",1367193600,,593,4.306306306306307

It's and updated remake of an old Nick Nolte film called ""MULHOLLAND FALLS"" and they brought back Nick to play the Police Chief behind the squad in this one with Josh Brolin playing his old part. This has an Outstanding cast that includes, Nick Nolte, Josh Brolin, Emma Stone, Ryan Gossling, Robert Patrick, Giovanni Ribisi, & Michael Pena & the great Sean Penn as Mickey Cohen. The story is based on a real life story that occurred in 1949 in Los Angeles and although parts of it are fictionalized the action is great and doesn't dissapoint.

4867917,1,B005S9ELVC,"This was far and away the most disappointing movie I've seen in a long, long time. The final product was a slick and soulless journey to nowhere. I wanted to like it. I tried to like it. But it didn't like me back. It didn't try to like me back. It didn't make the effort for me to care about the characters or their motives. For example, (spoiler)Ryan Gosling doesn't want any part of the squad until a kid gets mowed down in the line of fire. Now this is a scene we've seen a thousand times before in thousand movies just like this one. Sometimes it works. But here, there's no relationship with the kid, we have no investment in him. The whole scene screams out at you, ""Hey, I'm in this movie to justify Gosling joining the squad."" But it has no heart. And every scene in the movie is like that. The scenes play out like concepts, like ideas of what the filmmakers want you to feel, but they never actually take you on that journey. I say ""filmmakers"" and not simply director because it's very hard to know if the director or the producer is responsible. I mean, the cast has terrific talent and something must have drawn them to the project--other than just a paycheck. But the final edit is so poor, it's hard to tell if there was any life in the screenplay to begin with. It does feel like the potential was all there, but in the end, it's just a crude mash-up of The Untouchables and LA Confidential, without taking the time to be its own thing and letting the story develop through the interaction of the characters. In summary, my experience of this movie felt less like watching a movie and more like watching a video game--a video game that someone else is playing without ever giving you a turn to interact with the world or the characters yourself.

4867996,1,B005S9ELVC,"This movie is a painful experience to sit through. Painful because it's inept and intelligence insulting to the max. It's a mess on nearly every level. Sometimes movie projects have all the right chemistry and promise on paper, but miss the mark by a great margin. Others miss the mark by leaps and bounds such as De Palma's crap ridden horrible stinker 'The black Dahlia', which is a tormenting film to sit through in every conceivable way. Then you have this movie that is so bad you have to gauge it by something much worse like the Black Dahlia in which to even measure anything good about it. How this film got 3 and 4 star reviews is anyone's geuss. I'm still scratching my head. It appears everything was in place for this to have become a big hit of the year. An A list of solid actors, an interesting true story and a good budget. But the fault clearly lays squarely upon the backs of bad planning, a terrible script and horrible direction. Nick Nolte's performance alone is worth seeing for it's unintentional comic qualities, Penn is actually quite good at times, and others seems lost and hasn't a clue what to do with the s*** script he's had to waddle through. Gosling is wooden as hell, as is Josh Brolin, who is sadly just as wooden. Everyone else is as well. So far this is the worst movie I've seen all year.

4868000,4,B005S9ELVC,"Let's get something straight here: GANGSTER SQUAD is based on a true story...very loosely based.  It's an intriguing story, one worth checking out (Paul Liberman's source book is a must-read for fans of real life noir): Jewish gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), a former boxer, has made a name for himself in 1930s Los Angeles.  He's brutal (that opening scene is a killer, followed shortly by another) and remorseless, and he wants nothing less than the possession of L.A.'s corrupt soul.

Enter the Gangster Squad.  Generaled by a grizzled Chief Parker (Nick Nolte), and captained by a tough-as-nails moralist (Josh Brolin), featuring a cowboy (Robert Patrick), a rookie (Michael Pena) a genius (Giovanni Ribisi), a hustler (Anthony Mackie, because everyone knows 1939 L.A. was racially integrated), and a bad boy with a heart of gold (Ryan Gosling), who happens to be falling for Cohen's latest dame (Emma Stone).

Sound familiar?  Well, it is.  It's a by-the-numbers production, featuring over-the-top dialogue and action sequences, a whole lot of coincidence, two-dimensional characters (for example: in reality, Chief Parker was hardly the crusading white knight he's portrayed as here), and violence for the sake of violence.  Think THE UNTOUCHABLES, but without Kevin Costner's off-putting likability.  In the leading role, Brolin is merely cruising, but he knows what to do and does it right.  Penn makes a deliciously hatable villain; his dialogue is atrocious (perhaps intentionally), but Penn digs in deep and growls out every syllable, coming off as truly menacing, in a B-movie sort of way.  The rest of the supporting cast balances their roles well; Stone, like most women in gangster films, has little to do, and there is surprisingly little chemistry between her and Gosling (who is sleepwalking even more so than Brolin).  The acting is, basically, on the level one would expect it to be, given the fact that its stellar cast is basically slumming it up.  However,  GANGSTER SQUAD looks good; it's a gorgeous production that embraces its noir roots and runs with it.  This may seem like shallow praise, but it isn't; if you lower your expectations to a realistic B-movie level, GANGSTER SQUAD is one of the more enjoyable gangster films of recent years.  It's not a classic, but it never tries to be; it's entertaining, plain and simple.  And damn, 1930s Los Angeles never looked so sexy.",1366588800,,2406,5.112531969309463

4868023,2,B005S9ELVC,"Gangster Squad (2013) - Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Emma Stone, Anthony Mackie, Giovanni Ribisi, Michael Pea, Robert Patrick.

Thoughts: Wasn't a fan. Director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) already blew my trust with 30 Minutes Or Less, so I was cautiously optimistic about Gangster Squad. Then the Aurora incident occurred and the film was forced to undergo reshoots. That awesome trailer that sells the film as a gritty flick about cops operating outside the law? Total lie. This film tonally cannot handle itself. It simultaneously attempts screwball, slapstick while taking itself too seriously. Based very loosely on a book called Tales from the Gangster Squad, it takes so many liberties that the awesome literally bleeds out leaving a hollow husk of a film. Ryan Gosling talks with an incredibly annoying and soft voice, Brolin tries to play the straight man in this farce and no one apparently told Sean Penn that he was in a comedy because he acts as if he's in a drama (his villainous turn as Mickey Cohen is the high point). Character motivations were embarrassingly sloppy (esp. in regards to Ryan Gosling's character).

Should you buy it? I'm a film buff. As such, I hated this film. I would not buy this if it was in a dollar discount bin (which it inevitably will be in a few months). Worth a view? At times it can be funny (even when it's trying to be serious), so as a comedy it could work for a rental. It's an ok bad movie, but not bad enough to be a classic (a la Troll 2 or The Room). If you want mindless fun, go for it. If you want a good gritty film, I highly recommend anything by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, Bronson, Pusher, Valhalla Rising, etc.)",1366243200,5,1695,4.6466666666666665
4868024,3,B005S9ELVC,"Los Angeles, 1949. Mobster Mickey Cohen has become the most powerful California mobster, and intends to continue spreading his influence.

Of course, there are a few uncorrupted cops who don't intend to let him do that, even if they have to step outside the law. And so we get ""Gangster Squad,"" which has a dream cast and a stylish noirish look, but also fails to really impress with storytelling or character development. It's not dreadful, but it's not as good as it should be.

Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) rules the Los Angeles underworld, with the help of corrupt cops and judges. After saving a girl from some of Cohen's thugs, Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is called in by the police chief with a very special mission: destroy Cohen's criminal empire, and send him packing from LA. O'Mara's pregnant wife Connie (Mireille Enos) isn't pleased by this.

With Connie's help, O'Mara quickly assembles his ""gangster squad"" -- a strong street detective (Anthony Mackie), a wire-tapper (Giovanni Ribisi), a gunslinger who targets gangsters (Robert Patrick) and his partner (Michael Pea). They're also joined by Wootens (Ryan Gosling), who is having a clandestine affair with Cohen's mistress/etiquette coach Grace Faraday (Emma Stone).

And after a little training, the Gangster Squad begins taking down Cohen's empire -- they attack casinos, kill Cohen's men, and basically wreck all his business. But when Cohen deduces who they are and what they're doing, he decides to strike back.

""Gangster Squad"" is a decent movie, but it should be a truly brilliant one. It has a talented all-star cast including Penn, Gosling and Brolin, a lot of flashy gangster violence and sleaze, and it's directed by the guy who brought us ""Zombieland."" But somehow... just somehow... it doesn't quite gel as a film.

Ruben Fleischer gives postwar L.A. a pulpy, glitzy look that grows more gritty and rough as the film unwinds. He also seems to be having a lot of fun with all the blasting guns, burning money and dramatic death scenes, such as when one man is thrown in a pool and shot.

But there isn't really anything memorable during the scenes of vigilante justice. The squad just bursts in and blast away unnamed mooks, then moves on to the next target. Some parts are so painfully Hollywood that it burns -- consider the ditchwater-dull relationship between Wootens and Grace, which seems to just be in the movie because we needed a romance between two hot young people.

The movie also tries to bring up the moral aspect of vigilantism (Keeler says that they're no different from Cohen) but immediately drops it without saying yea or nay. Seriously, don't do that. It just makes the story seem shallow.

Fortunately, this is somewhat compensated for by the awesome casting. Sean Penn is all wiry sneering and snarling as Mickey Cohen, a sadistic thug who believes it's his ""destiny"" to rule the western US. Penn is not in the movie very often, but he brings an electric energy to whatever scenes he is in.

Brolin is also excellent as a soldier-turned-cop who hasn't quite lost his urge to fight for what he believes in, and who wants to expunge the corruption from the City of Angels. Ryan Gosling does a passable job, even though his whole role is basically to romance Stone. And while the rest of the cast isn't fleshed out as much, we get some excellent low-key performances from Mackie, Patrick, Nick Nolte, Enos and Ribisi.

""Gangster Squad"" should really be a much better movie than it is, but the solid acting from a great cast keeps it afloat. Worth seeing, but not necessarily keeping.",1366156800,6,3581,4.854098360655738

The film is based on a group of policemen who decide to do some co-corricular work and looking for the bad guys. It is a cheesy mix because the director tried way too hard to make the film stylish but overall the impact was not even remotely felt. There are hardly any memorable scenes in the film save the ones where Sean Penn is delivering dialogs. Ryan Gosling does not come anywhere near his potential in this film and speaks dialogues with a queer italic voice.

Gangster Squad had an ok story but the camaraderie between the cops was cheesy.

Despite being a period film, it looked way too stylish, it seems in every scene the cops are posing.

The cop who's African American says only one or two dialogues. It seems the editor was over-worked. The action is very average.

Why are there so many one to five second scenes? This is not even a music video. Utter waste of beautiful sets. There were times I couldn't believe how or why the film was ever made because there were so many holes.

4868066,4,B005S9ELVC,"Warner Bros. is a studio with a long and flavorful association with the gangster genre that dates back almost to the advent of sound pictures with enduring classics such as the Public Enemy, Little Caesar, White Heat and my personal favorite the Petrified Forest, continuing up to the modern era with the seminal Bonnie and Clyde and more contemporary movies such as Goodfellas, Heat, L.A. Confidential and Martin Scorsese's  Best Picture Oscar winning the Departed. While Ruben Fleischer's Gangster Squad most likely won't be joining the immortals, it is a fun and excessively exciting throwback to days of yore when the silver screen glistened with stars who could easily be identified by single names such as Bogie, Eddie G. or Cagney.
 Set in the post-war Las Angels of 1949, with a handsome production design by Mather Ahmad and the best cinematography any pulp action movie could ask for, provided by Dion Beebe. Beebe, an Oscar winner for Memoirs of a Geisha, but also the DP on the nourish tinged Collateral, Equilibrium and the motion picture of Miami Vice, here his camerawork is thrillingly and engulfing, every review I have read singles out his splendid work with significant praise, even the negative reviews.
 Praised as well critized with equal measure for it's highly stylized, often  flamboyant style of filmmaking. The movie plays successfully as a loving homage to the gangster classics it wants to immolate. The story maybe similar in ways to Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential, but it is actually a completely different animal aiming for the more low brow visually pleasing pulp of classic Warner gangsters. As such, I feel it is very successful, as I'm sure most will as long as they go in thinking more of Dick Tracy than Don Vito Corleone, or maybe just Al Pacino as Scarface with a slightly more colorful palette. Call it cartoonish cool.
 The plot involving a magnificent group of seven L.A. cops trying to take down the racket of mobster Mickey Cohen. Will recall the Untouchables and my pick for the best movie of the last fifteen years, the already mentioned L.A. Confidential. It's not in their league, but if you are inclined for this sort of pulverize entertainment, you won't be disappointed. The screenplay by Will Beall is chocked full of ostentatious hard boiled tough guy dialogue, based on a book by Paul Lieberman, it is Beall's first filmed movie script, but he is the author of the as-yet unfilmed ""Lethal Weapon 5"" and the ""Logan's Run"" redsux, at least judging from his work here it gives high hopes for those possible future projects. Yes, the story is familiar, obvious and filled with clichs, but I am not entirely uncertain that is not it's aim.
 Director Fleischer is a great stylist if not a great moviemaker, as the director behind the excellent and cheerfully cheeky Zombieland, but also the dismal 30 Minutes or Less, Fleischer does exhibit a wonderful visual flair which he puts to good use here in this highly visual movie.
 It would be nearly impossible however not to discuss the exceptional cast of Gangster Squad. Beginning with Josh Brolin in full leading man command, a fully watch able talent and likeable movie star all before getting to the fact that he is a first rate actor. All the same praise can be heaped on Ryan Gosling ten fold, it's amazing watching him play tough because he doesn't look like a bad ass, but is able pull it off on the sheer strength of his performance. I would hate to see him bogged down in action roles as he is such a great actor, probably the best of his generation, but after the exquisite Drive and the forthcoming A Place Beyond the Pines and Only God Forgives, he seems to be choosing his roles very well even in the sometimes limited action movie genre.
 The rest of the gagster squad is fleshed out by top notch character performers such as the veteran Robert Patrick, Michael Pena coming off a star making turn in the excellent cop drama End of Watch, Giovanni Ribisi and Anthony Mackie with Nick Nolte as the chief of police.
 Nolte seems to be aging like a rock, he looks like solid brick and his rhapsitty voice is only getting deeper and more gruff, as an actor he could drive fear into your heart at 71 years old with just one scowl and when he declares that this ""isn`t a crime wave, it/`s enemy occupation"" you believe what he has to say. Patrick himself a long dependable character star, is offered his best role since his breakthrough of Terminator 2: Judgment Day some twenty-two years earlier, as an old gunslinger who prefers a six shooter to the more contemporary tommy gun.
 Emma Stone is a nice surprise, sultry and with the classic good looks meet style that recall starlets of yesteryear, particularly Lauren Bacall and other classic movie femme fatales of the silver screen past.
 However, make no mistake this is Sean Penn's movie. Giving an electrifying performance as Mickey Cohen who happily declares that this ""the wild ****ing west"""", aas the ex-boxer turned  gangster Penn gives the movie it`s meat and it`s center. It may not be a historically accurate portrayal of the man, but it is one that won't soon be forgotten. If there is anything that elevates Gangster Squad close to greatness it is Penn's performance, a richly textured evil that reminds us every time he's onscreen why this is a gangster picture and not a cop movie.
 As well known for their gangster and crime films as Universal was for their monsters and MGM for their musicals, the classic Warner Bros. tradition, unlike those others still survives and waves it's flag high and proud, and while Gangster Squad probably won't win any Oscars or be highly regarded in years to come, it is a satisfactory slice of juicy pulp fiction to sustain us until their next classic rolls out.

Confidential and Martin Scorsese's  Best Picture Oscar winning the Departed. While Ruben Fleischer's Gangster Squad most likely won't be joining the immortals, it is a fun and excessively exciting throwback to days of yore when the silver screen glistened with stars who could easily be identified by single names such as Bogie, Eddie G. or Cagney.
 Set in the post-war Las Angels of 1949, with a handsome production design by Mather Ahmad and the best cinematography any pulp action movie could ask for, provided by Dion Beebe. Beebe, an Oscar winner for Memoirs of a Geisha, but also the DP on the nourish tinged Collateral, Equilibrium and the motion picture of Miami Vice, here his camerawork is thrillingly and engulfing, every review I have read singles out his splendid work with significant praise, even the negative reviews.
 Praised as well critized with equal measure for it's highly stylized, often  flamboyant style of filmmaking. The movie plays successfully as a loving homage to the gangster classics it wants to immolate. The story maybe similar in ways to Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential, but it is actually a completely different animal aiming for the more low brow visually pleasing pulp of classic Warner gangsters. As such, I feel it is very successful, as I'm sure most will as long as they go in thinking more of Dick Tracy than Don Vito Corleone, or maybe just Al Pacino as Scarface with a slightly more colorful palette. Call it cartoonish cool.
 The plot involving a magnificent group of seven L.A. cops trying to take down the racket of mobster Mickey Cohen. Will recall the Untouchables and my pick for the best movie of the last fifteen years, the already mentioned L.A. Confidential. It's not in their league, but if you are inclined for this sort of pulverize entertainment, you won't be disappointed. The screenplay by Will Beall is chocked full of ostentatious hard boiled tough guy dialogue, based on a book by Paul Lieberman, it is Beall's first filmed movie script, but he is the author of the as-yet unfilmed ""Lethal Weapon 5"" and the ""Logan's Run"" redsux, at least judging from his work here it gives high hopes for those possible future projects. Yes, the story is familiar, obvious and filled with clich&eacute;s, but I am not entirely uncertain that is not it's aim.
 Director Fleischer is a great stylist if not a great moviemaker, as the director behind the excellent and cheerfully cheeky Zombieland, but also the dismal 30 Minutes or Less, Fleischer does exhibit a wonderful visual flair which he puts to good use here in this highly visual movie.
 It would be nearly impossible however not to discuss the exceptional cast of Gangster Squad. Beginning with Josh Brolin in full leading man command, a fully watch able talent and likeable movie star all before getting to the fact that he is a first rate actor. All the same praise can be heaped on Ryan Gosling ten fold, it's amazing watching him play tough because he doesn't look like a bad ass, but is able pull it off on the sheer strength of his performance. I would hate to see him bogged down in action roles as he is such a great actor, probably the best of his generation, but after the exquisite Drive and the forthcoming A Place Beyond the Pines and Only God Forgives, he seems to be choosing his roles very well even in the sometimes limited action movie genre.
 The rest of the gagster squad is fleshed out by top notch character performers such as the veteran Robert Patrick, Michael Pena coming off a star making turn in the excellent cop drama End of Watch, Giovanni Ribisi and Anthony Mackie with Nick Nolte as the chief of police.
 Nolte seems to be aging like a rock, he looks like solid brick and his rhapsitty voice is only getting deeper and more gruff, as an actor he could drive fear into your heart at 71 years old with just one scowl and when he declares that this ""isn`t a crime wave, it/`s enemy occupation"" you believe what he has to say. Patrick himself a long dependable character star, is offered his best role since his breakthrough of Terminator 2: Judgment Day some twenty-two years earlier, as an old gunslinger who prefers a six shooter to the more contemporary tommy gun.
 Emma Stone is a nice surprise, sultry and with the classic good looks meet style that recall starlets of yesteryear, particularly Lauren Bacall and other classic movie femme fatales of the silver screen past.
 However, make no mistake this is Sean Penn's movie. Giving an electrifying performance as Mickey Cohen who happily declares that this ""the wild ****ing west"""", aas the ex-boxer turned  gangster Penn gives the movie it`s meat and it`s center. It may not be a historically accurate portrayal of the man, but it is one that won't soon be forgotten. If there is anything that elevates Gangster Squad close to greatness it is Penn's performance, a richly textured evil that reminds us every time he's onscreen why this is a gangster picture and not a cop movie.
 As well known for their gangster and crime films as Universal was for their monsters and MGM for their musicals, the classic Warner Bros. tradition, unlike those others still survives and waves it's flag high and proud, and while Gangster Squad probably won't win any Oscars or be highly regarded in years to come, it is a satisfactory slice of juicy pulp fiction to sustain us until their next classic rolls
out.

4868069,3,B005S9ELVC,"This film has received many bad reviews, but not because it's a bad movie. The truth is it's just not what people expected it to be. When you hear about a mafia movie, you expect an epic, inside look like with Goodfellas or Casino, but Gangster Squad is from the cops point of view and more like The Untouchables. Gangster Squad is based on a novel and is about an off the books LAPD operation aimed at bringing down Micky Cohen. In the 1940s, LA had a growing mafia problem on it's hands, and Mickey Cohen was set to become the next Al Capone. Unbeknownst for decades, the LAPD sent a group of cops, who didn't play by the book, after Cohen and by going after his business interests, they attempt to destroy his growing empire. The story is a great one, well deserving of a film adaptation, but what people didn't like was how it turned into an action film. This story has all the makings of an epic mafia drama, an you will be hard pressed to find a better performance than the one Sean Penn gives as Mickey Cohen. It was somewhat disappointing that they didn't get more into Cohen and his operation, but for what it was, it was a great film. As for the cast, it features some of Hollywood's best an brightest as old school meets the up and coming stars of the big screen. Every one from the stars to the ancillary characters give Oscar worthy performances that will be sadly overlooked. because of the nature of the film. If you're looking for a classic mob drama, you're going to be disappointed, but if you want to see an action packed cop movie with a mob element, then Gangster Squad is the film for you.",1361491200,141,1611,4.337748344370861

Unable to find someone to testify against him the chief of police puts together a special unit to take him down. Lead by Sgt. John O'Mara (Brolin) he hand picks his squad and the war for LA begins. I am a huge fan of mobster/gangster type movies and was really looking forward to seeing this. I was not disappointed. I knew nothing of the real story so the entire thing was new to me and that made it an entertaining experience. The cast is perfect in this and the action and story really move along very fast and the movie feels shorter then it was. There are some very graphic scenes in this (man gets ripped in half) so if that bothers you then I would maybe avoid this. If you are into fast moving, violent, mob/police driven movies with a great cast then this is one not to miss. Overall, an extremely entertaining gangster movie that grabs you from opening scene, I highly recommend this. I give it an A.",1360022400,2,1040,4.257575757575758
4868101,2,B005S9ELVC,"A story ""inspired by true events"" about an ""off the books"" squad of LAPD officers sent to go after the gangster Mickey Cohen. The problem is that Cohen's downfall didn't come in the way that the movie shows. So GS may have more in common with ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" than with actual history. I'd accept the violence of the film if it was at least truly based on the facts. Since it was not, the ending of the film IMHO becomes silly.",1359936000,6,437,4.27710843373494

Sean Penn gave a hilarious performance as Mickey Cohen the infamous mobster,and the rest of the cast was good ,at times the movie took it self a little too serious at times to me,the scenes of brutal violence and car chases were well put together by the director,but the best parts of this movie was the Tommy gun battle at the hotel  and the fistfight at the finale absolutely well done,great popcorn flick!",1359849600,4,612,4.513513513513513
4868103,4,B005S9ELVC,"This is a fictionalized version of the story of LA gangster Mickey Cohen, excellently portrayed by Sean Penn who looks nothing like him. The action takes place in 1949/1950 and is not shot in black and white. Combat veteran Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is asked to form a squad of elite men to take down Mickey Cohen, but not as cops, but as a gangsters hitting his places one by one.

John has a pregnant wife (Mireille Enos) who would rather leave town than have her husband take on the mobster. Saddled with the fact it won't happen, she helps her husband assemble a squad which includes Jerry (Ryan Gosling) a playboy cop who is seeing Mickey's girlfriend (Emma Stone). Emma Stone has played too many down to earth women to pull off a swanky mobster girl. She looked like a kid who was playing in her mommy's make-up box. Perhaps that was the genius of the film as she was to suppose to be a small town girl out of place.

Jerry uses a pick up line from 1941 comedy ""Hold That Ghost"" when he talks about playing post office. Again, was this bad writing or would have someone used a line from a film? At times the characters acted like they came out of ""Sin City,"" stereotypes of themselves. Where do they get all these new Packards to shoot up?

The film had some good lines such as Sean Penn: ""All good things must one day be burnt to the ground for insurance money."" There is enough humor in the film to keep it from becoming dry.

Now the bad news is that Mickey Cohen was actually brought down by the IRS and not the gangster squad. His girlfriend Liz (not Grace)did three years because she wouldn't testify against him. So as far as facts go, rate this well below an Oliver Stone film. I liked the film, but not because there was any truth to it.

4868104,5,B005S9ELVC,"Gangster Squad was excessively entertaining. The best gangster movie in years. It's simplistic, retro and full tilt. Sean Penn is ruthlessly exciting. It's a plot we've all heard before, it's a movie we've all basically seen before but so much better. It's over the top in style and action. Josh Brolin is a role model and top notch in his performance. . The only downside is some way too cheesy lines, a couple fight scenes are zoomed in too closely and Ryan Gosling's voice work sounded like a prepubescent teenager besides those three things it's a nearly perfect film reminiscent of Dick Tracy-esque villains.

4868105,4,B005S9ELVC,"(A genre review, to be read `gangster style')

This is a picture that says, ""Listen, you! You'll sit there and watch if you know what's good for ya!"" Next thing you know, there's a guy getting ripped in half, just so you get the message. Mickey Cohen is the guy who sends that telegram, and he's played by Sean Penn who met `the top' one day and decided to go over it, way over it. Just so we're clear though, that's just what's needed to make Gangster Squad tick.

Cohen owns LA, but goody-two-shoes Sgt. O'Mara (Josh Brolin) has other plans for the City of Angels. He's had enough of this sucker's drug running, cop buying, and lady trafficking and looks to put an end to it. Problem is, his bird needs a husband not a hero, and what's more - she's got company on the way (baby O'Mara). Off the books, Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) says O'Mara's got to round up a squad Ocean's Eleven style complete with tough guy Rocky Washington (Anthony Mackie), tech-man Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi), sharp shooter Max Kennard (Robert Patrick), and sidekick Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena). Not to mention Wildman Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) who's ""poaching the king's deer"" in that he's got an eye on Mickey's girl Grace (Emma Stone).

What follows is a ride through the gritty, pulpy landscape of post-war LA, where knuckleheads get what's coming to them if they step out of line. Jerry's moves on Mickey's dame put O'Mara's operation in some hot water, and a cat and mouse chase commences. When it comes to Gangster Squad, you know the drill: operations go south on account that a runt up and turned rat on a guy, tensions swell when a thug drops the dime on his boss, and emotions flare every time a broad bends her arm for another gent. It ain't Chinatown, but it's got a scene that takes place there. Point is, this is entertaining and while critically it may be a bust, here's a fun ride with an expert cast that delivers the goods...with a few bumps and bruises. B+

4868106,5,B005S9ELVC,This is a phenomenal portrayal of 1940's Los Angeles. I went in not expecting much but this delivered everything. Yes it's a little slow at times lots of talking. However once the guns come out you'll be in awe. Great acting from everyone. Just a all around great movie.,1358985600,7,270,4.530612244897959
4868107,2,B005S9ELVC,"This is a violent, bloody R-rated territorial squabble set in the late 1940s between the Los Angeles Police Department and the Mickey Cohen/Bugsy Siegel East Coast Mob. This humor-laced (and bullet-ridden) outing pits East Coast gangsters against ...hmm... not really a Dirty Dozen, more like a Slightly Soiled Six-Pack, of cops who have been anonymously recruited to run organized crime out of Los Angeles.

This is a highly fictionalized story inspired by real events. We see:
  * Sean Penn (""Milk"") is Mickey Cohen, a former professional boxer with a nasty temper, brutal and merciless. I must say, Penn has become a caricature of himself....and he has NEVER learned to enunciate!
  * Nick Nolte (""Warrior"") is Police Chief Parker, the guy determined to keep Cohen and his cohorts from setting up shop in LA.
  * Josh Brolin (""W."") is Sgt. John O'Mara, an Army vet, now a cop for the LAPD. He is hand-picked for the job, and he in turn hand picks his own squad (with some help from his wife).
  * Ryan Gosling (""Drive"") is Sgt. Jerry Wooters, who first declines the ""honor"" of serving on the team, but then he gets mad... (with the Hollywoodland real estate development sign shining in the background.)
  * Emma Stone (""The Amazing Spider-Man"") is Grace, a favorite of Cohen's; Sgt. Wooters likes her, too.... Vintage clothing looks good on this gal!
  * Robert Patrick (""Trouble With the Curve"") is Max, otherwise known by this little gang as ""Hopalong"" because a six-gun is his weapon of choice.
  * Michael Pea (""End of Watch"") is Navidad, who nominates himself to join up when Max is recruited.
  * Giovanni Ribisi (""Avatar"") is Conway, a technician who is invited into the project because he understands telecommunications...and our geek accepts because he would like to be a hero to his son.
  * Anthony Mackie (""The Hurt Locker"") is Coleman, the only law in his tough neighborhood. He just wants to stay OUT of Burbank!
  * Yvette Tucker (""Me Again"") does a perfectly splendid turn as Carmen Miranda, complete with a towering headgear of fruit, singing at Slapsy Maxie's nightclub during a raid.

This shoot-em-up is almost non-stop gunfire interspersed with blowie uppie stuff. There isn't as much profanity as usual, but the vehicular mayhem is sorta fun with those big old 40s vintage cars swaying and lurching around corners.

Be sure to suspend disbelief, but be prepared to laugh more often than you might expect. Despite all the blood and gore, the screening audience was mildly entertained, and that's what it's all about, ...isn't it? ...Maybe? Amazon will notify me when this is available on DVD so I can notify my folks on JayFlix.net.",1358380800,19,2656,4.89261744966443
4868108,4,B005S9ELVC,"Okay, I'm a bit biased.  I'm partial to movies featuring trench coats, fedora, tough-talking cops, smooth-talking dames, and blazing Tommy guns.  ""Gangster Squad"" is the type of movie I go to the movies hoping to see every year, my typical fantasies transferred directly to the big screen.

Recent attempts at the genre, like Frank Miller's misguided&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spirit/dp/B001TVEW5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spirit</a>&nbsp;and Brian De Palma's overwrought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Black-Dahlia/dp/B000NCX6Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Black Dahlia</a>, have been hit-and-miss.  But ""Gangster Squad"" hits the mark, having more in common with De Palma's 1987 classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Untouchables-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00029NKU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Untouchables (Special Collector's Edition)</a>.  The premise alone bears an uncanny resemblance.  Set in 1940's L.A. instead of 1920's Chicago, the movie follows an incorruptible cop hand-picking a team of honest cops to take down a notorious gangster, this time Mickey Cohen instead of Al Capone.  But while ""The Untouchables"" required a great cast to carry Kevin Costner as its lead, Josh Brolin's acting chops are more similar to Sean Connery's.  Brolin plays Sergeant John O'Mara, a grizzled hero whose unwillingness to stay out of Mickey Cohen's way makes waves for his superiors, but Chief Bill Parker (a surprisingly dignified performance by Nick Nolte) recruits him to head a task force bent on undermining Cohen's rule.

O'Mara contrasts sharply with younger, go-with-the-flow Sgt. Wooters (Ryan Gosling), who is content to spend his nights gambling, drinking, and picking up dames at Cohen's favorite nightclub, but soon finds himself joining the team.  O'Mara recruits switchblade-wielding beat cop Anthony Mackie, old timey wild westerner Robert Patrick (complete with six-shooter and Yosemite Sam mustache), and tech whiz Giovanni Ribisi to round out the team, with Robert Patrick's Hispanic partner Michael Pena joining the party without being formally invited.

While ""The Untouchables"" boasted method actor Robert DeNiro as Al Capone, it was hard to forget he was Robert DeNiro.  By comparison, Sean Penn disappears completely into the role of infamous boxer-turned-mobster Mickey Cohen.  He's truly terrifying from the moment, barely past the studio logos, we see what he does to those who oppose or fail him.

Emma Stone, needless to say, is pretty as a pin-up as the dame, Cohen's main squeeze with red hair and redder lips.  But she's not the movie's only eye candy.  There's plenty of gorgeous cinematography of Los Angeles landmarks and glossy recreations of 40's nightclubs and casinos.  And, as much as I want to dislike Ryan Gosling, he's great as the youthful detective whose love affair with Stone's character forms a large part of the narrative.  But it's ultimately Brolin's straight-laced detective and family man who carries the movie, from the moment he punches his way into a mob-controlled hotel to save a blonde bombshell from being initiated into a brothel in his introductory scene.

While ""Gangster Squad"" has all the trademarks of the film noir genre, that's just the outward veneer of an all-out action flick, more in the vein of ""The Untouchables"" or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dick-Tracy/dp/B00005T7I1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dick Tracy</a>&nbsp;than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Maltese-Falcon/dp/B001EC0OQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Maltese Falcon</a>, with fist fights, shootouts, and a car chase (with beautiful vintage 40's vehicle, naturally) that are as bloody and brutal as anything else in movies right now. While the movie may include a few clichs too many, or Ruben Fleischer (who directed Emma Stone in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombieland/dp/B0030B624E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombieland</a>) may rely a few times too many on modern film tricks like slow motion and dizzying camera angles, ""Gangster Squad"" is the best entry in the genre in decades.",1358035200,2,4325,6.542907180385289
4868109,4,B005S9ELVC,"""Gangster Squad"" is an old-fashioned crime-fighting thriller set in the L.A. of the late 1940's, complete with period sets, a solid cast, and a suspenseful story.  It claims to be based on a true story, but the average viewer probably won't worry about the history.  The average viewer will be too busy wondering just how vicious the fight between two-fisted mobster Mickey Cohen and a group of vigilante cops is going to get, and who might get hurt in the process.

As the story opens, Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is staking out his criminal turf, while most of the police force has been paid to look the other way.  The police chief (a grizzled Nick Nolte) taps honest police sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to set up an off-the-books gangster squad.  With the help of his wife, O'Mara picks five other police officers prepared to take on Cohen and his mob.  Among them is Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), O'Mara's army buddy, who also happens to have a very dangerous thing going with Cohen's moll (Emma Stone).  The gangster squad gets to work, and Mickey Cohen soon becomes aware that his operation is being dismantled right under his nose.  Cohen will come after the gangster squad, and their friends and families, setting up a big finale at an L.A. hotel.

The pacing of the movie is perhaps a little uneven, but its best moments make up for it.  The gunfights are pretty exciting, and the movie makes the good guys worry about the collateral damage.  Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are quite good together, as in a different way are Josh Brolin and Mireille Enos, who plays his wife.  The movie has an old-fashioned ending, but that is the point.
