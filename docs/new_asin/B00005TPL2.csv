1662269,4,B00005TPL2,"Synopsis: A happily married couple with two sons and great jobs learn some shocking news, that their fellow best friends and spouses, are separating. What ensues is a look at the strength of their marriage, in comparison to the one that is disintegrating before everyone's eyes.
Review: A friend and I had a conversation about the state of Hollywood movies today. That for every Swordfish and The Grinch remake (an obnoxious film at that), a small film like Sexy Beast or another will go virtually unnoticed by the likes of big Hollywood business. In today's profit driven society, smart films are finding their home on cable. In ""Dinner With Friends"", this drama is riveting, not for any kind of suspense, but for a study of what people really are, and what they do in life. Adapted from a stage play, the words seem real right down to the very last word. As the film's writer and director bring the film's situations to your own judgment, as to who these people are and what they can be like. It's a character study that doesn't exploit people, and it lets their actions speak for themselves. Overall, a good film.",1006992000,19,1116,4.67005076142132

1662288,2,B00005TPL2,"One of the reviewers here stated that this is a movie ""we can all relate to.""

But we *can't* all relate to it.  Why?  Because it's demographically impossible for all of us to relate to it. ... We aren't all yuppies. ... We aren't all upper middle class. ... We don't all have jobs like the people in this movie.

Here's a movie that, hopefully, the filmmakers want a wide variety of economic classes to watch, and yet it's about a class of people whose lives and experiences are light years removed from the day-to-day realities of millions of Americans -- and certainly light years away from the ""felt-lives"" of millions of people throughout the world.

So how is it that the people who like this movie ""relate"" to it.  The fact is, they don't relate to it.  They suspend their disbelief by pretending that the people in this movie can actually live in our world completely unaware, completely unaffected and completley unconcerned about the social, political and economic forces that exist around them.

Of course this is not to say that Hollywood pays much attention to these powerful (perhaps deterministic) social, political and economic forces; they rarely do.  But this movie wants to take you to La-La Land and lock the door behind you.

Another reviewer claimed that this movie is about ""human nature.""  Are you serious?!  This movie's relationship to ""human nature"" is akin to learning about a culture by driving by a newsstand in a torrential rain.

Even people who fall into the socioeconomic class of the people in this movie aren't in any way enlightened by the condescending drivel that passes for dialogue.

Here's a rather telling example of what this movie is all about.

ANDIE MACDOWELL'S CHARACTER (to Greg Kinnear's character, Greg Kinnear's character having admitted he cheated on his wife): ""I mean, it's so squalid (having an affair with) -- A STEWARDESS!""

GREG KINNEAR'S CHARACTER: ""A stewardess!  Is that what she (my wife) told you?  A stewardess!  She's not a stewardess, she's a travel agent.""

Now let's stop and think about the composition of the audience watching this film. ...

No doubt the filmmakers want this movie to appeal to a wide, demographically broad-based audience. So who, pray tell, is apt to be in that multicultural audience?

Maybe some airline stewardesses.

Maybe ome people who work at MacDonald's.

Maybe a few million people who, given the realities of our ""global economy,"" have low-paying dead-end jobs.

What are the characters in this movie saying about such people?  Answer: That they're *below* them.  That having an affair with a travel agent is one thing (a rung higher up on the economic hierarchy) but A STEWARDESS?!

And what might they say about a cab driver or a hod carrier or typist or a film cutter?

It reminds me of the scene in ""Five Easy Pieces"" where Jack Nicholson, the oh-so-precious *artiste,* bawls out the waitress for not giving him precisely what he wants at the diner. ... But what about *her* dignity; what about how *her* day is going; what about *her* worth as a human being?

The movie is quite clear about the waitress.  She doesn't count.  She's just a waitress.

-- ""A STEWARDESS!""

-- ""Is that what she told you?  She's not a stewardess -- she's a travel agent!""

And it's from characters like this that you're going to learn something about human nature?  It's from characters like this that you're going to learn something about ""relationships""?  These are selfish, condescending, consumer-obsessed idiots.  The word ""idiot"" coming from the ancient Greeks and meaning people only concerned with their id drives -- the drive for food, shelter and clothing -- albeit in the case of these latte-sipping yuppies, *fancy* food, *fancy* clothes and *fancy* shelter.  Notwithstanding, idiots just the same.

Notice, too, how Denis Quaid's character is drawn by the screenwriter.  He's pussy-whipped.  ""Oh honey""-this and ""oh honey""- that.  I have the feeling the screenwriter pussy-whipped the Dennis Quaid character to immunize himself from being criticized as ""not relating to women.""  So what does he do, he p-whips one of the husbands.

Most couples who question their relationship with their mate (surprise!) also taking into account not just the relationship but everything else that's ""outside over there.""  Meaning: the social, political and economic forces that movies like this assiduously AVOID!!!

This is what Plato called ""The Big Lie,"" that is to say, ""the lie to the soul"" that movies like this trade on.

What I found offensive about this movie is how seriously it takes itself.  How it purports to advise the audience on love, marriage, sex, communication, relationships.  The list goes on and obnoxiously on.

And who are the people who made this movie?  Is their day similar to your day?  No.  Are their realities your realities?  No.

Instead, they've willfully and diligently insulated themselves from what average ordinary people experience in their lives -- and then have the nerve to turn around and tell us how we should live our lives.  About which they know or desire to know absolutely zero.

Look at the faces of these four characters.  Do they look like they've experienced the same world, the same realities you've experienced?",1257724800,4,5248,4.971231300345225
1662289,4,B00005TPL2,"Loved this movie!  A ton of great stars and terrific dialogue~

1662290,5,B00005TPL2,"A great cast, a great set of dialogs, human nature and frailties, misconceptions, what more can I say, a captivating movie worth watching over and over",1191369600,,151,4.846153846153846
1662291,3,B00005TPL2,"Intellectual and poignant, this is a film that deals with one of the most delicate relationships of all- ""couple-friends."" Most of us have, or have had, ""those friends""- they are the ""other couple,"" they got together around the same time as you, you see them almost every weekend, they watch your pets and collect your mail when you go out of town. You have similar situations(house, children, or something that equates that). You keep each other going when the other pair hits a rough patch. But how well do you really know what is going on in someone else's relationship? How much does someone else's situation affect your own?

This film poses and tackles those very questions. Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell find out that their best friends Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are getting divorced. What seemed to be a relationship very much like their own is suddenly dissolving. This dissolution calls into question their own relationship's stability, as well as their relationship with Kinnear & Collette. How well did Quaid/MacDowell really know Kinnear/Collette if they, the couple's BEST friends, did not see the true nature of their problems? What does it say about their own relationship that the couple who seemed to be in such a similar situation as theirs are deciding their problems are too deep to continue the marriage?

There is a great scene toward the end of the film where Kinnear and Quaid go out for a drink months after the divorce and Kinnear tells Quaid ""Oh, c'mon, Gabe, I know how it is- I've heard YOU complain"" and Quaid tells him ""that's what married friends do- we complain, we talk about wives- and then we go home."" This fundamental difference between the two friends, and by extension the two couuples, is something that comes up repeatedly.  Which couple was right? Is there a right and wrong choice? How does someone else's life choices affect you? Should it affect you?

Your best friends break up, and you are left somewhere in the middle. Do you take sides? What happens to the friendship when the circumstances are no longer the thing you have most in common?  Can you even stay friends?

This is a great film- one that was entirely underrated. The performances are excellent- Kinnear, Quaid, and Collette especially.

Seeing this performed on the stage would've been amazing!",1188086400,2,2315,4.875318066157761

1662293,4,B00005TPL2,"Two couples, best friends, explore the problems and possibilities of marriage and go their separate ways. Which couple chose the better path?",1169596800,2,141,5.454545454545454
1662294,4,B00005TPL2,"This is the type of four-person drama that hardly makes it to the big screen anymore, and indeed this 2001 movie originally aired as an HBO film. Adapted by Donald Margulies from his own Pulitzer Prize-winning play, the film documents the unraveling relationships among two married couples who have been best friends for twelve years - Gabe and Karen, a perceived model of professional success (as renowned food writers) and domestic stability; and the other, Tom and Beth, in a state of irreparable collapse. Veteran filmmaker Norman Jewison (whose last successful film was probably 1987's ""Moonstruck"", his Italian-American valentine to improbable romance) has a proven track record for allowing actors to inhabit characters realistically in difficult situations. This movie proves he is still in peak form in this regard.

The story begins with Beth breaking the news to Gabe and Karen that Tom has left her. Gabe and Karen immediately take sides and start to question the stability of their own relationship. In the meantime, Tom is basking in the happiness of his new relationship with a younger woman, even as his best friends have become judgmental about what they see as a vainglorious, selfish act from a husband and father of two. Beth also goes on to find a new lover but also faces similar disapproval for moving on too fast. Although the film goes into an extended flashback sequence to have us understand the genesis of their long-standing friendship, the movie pushes forward the individual revelations of each principal in superbly executed scenes driven by Marguiles' perceptive, sometimes clever dialogue. There are unexpected comedy elements as well, for example, when a post-meltdown Beth blows her nose in the expensive placemat Karen bought for her in Italy.

The actors shine most unexpectedly. I always thought of Andie MacDowell as a rather flat but obviously lucky presence on the screen. Here she finally seems closer in proximity to a real, flawed human being as Karen. Her character is the picture of image-conscious perfection unable to tolerate, much less accept, disruptions to her controlling existence. MacDowell is still not a great actress, but at least she bravely reveals the unattractive underside of a character genuinely at a loss to deal with her best friends' break-up. As usual, Toni Collette nails her part perfectly as Beth, showing dimensions of the wronged wife that are both surprising and viscerally honest. The real surprises in the cast, however, are the men. As Tom, Greg Kinnear adds substantive depth to his standard happy-go-lucky guy and does not come across as his usual likable scamp at the least. The standout may be Dennis Quaid as Gabe, an assured performance from an actor who has not shown this much introspection onscreen before. In fact, he brings an almost fey quality to the early scenes and then gains more heft as the uncomfortable situation comes closer to home.

The most affecting scenes are the ones involving two of the characters at a time in revealing exchanges - Karen and Beth discussing Beth's new lover over lunch, Tom facing Gabe's resentment and jealousy at the bar, Gabe and Karen revealing their tactics to avoid intimacy as they prepare for bed. Given that Quaid and MacDowell play diehard foodies, there are plenty of shots of luxuriant food that any lover of the Food Network will savor. The film is beautifully shot by cinematographer Roger Deakins, who uses effective burnished amber tones for the flashback sequence. This is not for everyone, but the maturity of the drama and the top-notch performances make this one most worthwhile.",1153612800,8,3625,5.0890756302521005
1662295,4,B00005TPL2,"If you are struggle to understand why some relationships work and others don't, this movie can give you some great insight.

I have looked for it to be on everyday since but it has not been so I ordered my own copy so that I can wtch it anytime that i want.  I strongly suggest that if you are in to movies that allow you to think after you have watched them instead of escape you would be very benefited by this movie.

Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning play, Dinner with Friends is an insightful drama about four longtime friends and the way they deal with the breakup of 2 of them.

A realistic, well acted portrayal of relationships (both romantic and platonic) as well as their unraveling and strengthening. with excellent performances by Quaid, McDowell, Kinnear, and Collette.

Foodies will also enjoy this film's sincere appreciation of the joys of food, cooking, and travel. If you enjoyed Woody Allen's ""Husbands and Wives"" and Tom Noonan's ""The Wife"" you will love this sadly under-appreciated film.",1091836800,,672,5.380952380952381
1662299,5,B00005TPL2,"DINNER WITH FRIENDS as a cinematic adaptation of the play of the same name by Donald Margulies succeeds on every level.  The story is an investigation, over time, of two couples and how their connectedness differs.  Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell are a happily married couple, so enjoying the married state that they introduce their best friends Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette during a summering at Martha's Vineyard.  What happens in the ensuing ten-odd years to each of these couples makes for the grist of this very conversational tale.  This is an astute study of relationships - how they develop through attraction, how they wear with time, how they succeed or fail. There is nothing new about the ideas in this engrossing film, but as directed with great sensitivity by Norman Jewison and with the inimitably fine acting by Quaid, MacDowell, Kinnear, and Collete it becomes a finely tuned psychological study.  An exceptionally fine film that grows better with each viewing.",1090886400,5,982,5.074534161490683
1662300,5,B00005TPL2,"This movie amazed me.  After the credits rolled, I sat there thinking that I should probably just start it back up and watch it again.

1662302,5,B00005TPL2,"This was a remarkable work of art.  It was quite obvious that everyone involved was emotionally invested in the project.
  First of all, kudos to the playwright; I'm always impressed when male writers can capture the female psyche with expertise and intuition and translate it to a three dimensional character.  Expect nothing less than completely truthful revelations about what women are like, or what they can become, in long-term relationships.  It may be painful for some people to watch because many of us in this society go through our relationships with blinders on; a lot of couples live in denial.  Hopefully this film will foster some degree of understanding, compassion, and discussion in its viewers.
  Secondly, the cast was nothing less than extraordinary.  Because of the rich dialogue, these actors were finally given a chance to show a great deal of range.  Dennis Quaid's performance was simply incredible; he surprises me all the time by outdoing himself with each new role.  It's a testament to how often women underestimate men and their complex needs and desires within a relationship.  A couple of the scenes involving Dennis Quaid's and Greg Kinnear's characters are the most heart-breaking because they reveal a great deal of wisdom that tragically, they cannot manage to impart with their wives.  Toni Collette and Andie MacDowell are equal to the task of playing against the two male leads.  There is a great deal of humor, warmth, and chemistry between all of the actors.
  I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in understanding the opposite sex.  There's an important lesson to be learned as well: when it comes to relationships, we are all active participants and we need to learn to take accountability for our actions.  Especially those we inflict on our loved ones.",1060732800,6,1818,5.043624161073826
1662303,4,B00005TPL2,"As an accidental rule, I love movies with 6 characters or less; the ones stripped down so that each characters personality can come through in a way that can not be enhanced by effects, special settings or other frills.
  I've watched this movie twice now and I can already say that I've picked up on several of the many, I'm sure, nuances here. Four characters, two mairrages, one divorce and each is remarkably done. I especially appreciate that none of the characters (even Kinnear's adulterous character, which he seems typecast for now) is presented as flawed, spirited and in a way, noble. Gabe (Dennis Quaid) is heartbreaking as he has taken back-seat in a mairrage to a strong woman (McDowell) who, while wanting, nay demanding, her husband talk to her more, always manages to tell him how stupid the things he says are. Also the contrast between the pairs is phenomenal. Tom is the confident divorcee, Gabe is the soft-spoken married one. Beth is the free-thinking, and maybee too free-thinking, now single, artist, and Karen is the organized and 'moralistic' married woman, trying all-too-hard too hold a friendship between the four together.
  Whether you are 21 or 71, married or single, male (well...maybe) or female (for my part, I am a 26 year old, happily single, male),  parts of this film will speak to us all. Whether it's Tom's frank talks with Gabe about his wife's refusal for even basic physical contact, Gabe's rebuttal about the joys of mairrage and growing old with a sweetheart, Karen's dream about ""the two us's"" or Beth's attempts to remain aloof and free from it all. You may laugh, you'll certainly cry, you'll probably scatch your head, you'll pick a character to hate and find out you werer wrong, and you'll pick a character to love and find out you were right.",1048032000,20,1795,4.814935064935065
1662304,4,B00005TPL2,"I loved the original play that the film was based on. I found it to be a wonderfully intelligent exploration of monogamy and marriage that put other like plays and films to shame. The movie does the play justice (although the play is still better). Be warned, this is a VERY ""talky"" piece. Not necessarily much plot action. It is mainly people sitting around talking about what is important to them. I LOVE THAT. If its not your bag -- you were warned.
Casting is just short of great. I can't remember her name, but the blonde is very good, as is Greg Kinnear as the couple who split up. Nice work all around. ... Andie MacDowell ... takes what is a very interesting character and does her usual walk around and whine while looking pretty routine. Awful awful awful. However, this is surprisingly made up for by one of the gutsiest casting choices I've seen in awhile with Dennis Quaid. Anyone who thinks Quaid can't act should see this film. This character is VERY unlike anything he's done before -- much more feminine quality than we've seen before, while remaining strong and overtly masculine. He's articulate and sensitive ....AND HE COOKS FOR A LIVING!!! Anyway, can't go into it all here, but its the best thing he's ever done with the possible exception of THE RIGHT STUFF.
The final scene, as with the play, is one of the most important scenes I've watched in a long time. Andie MacDowell even works. Its the most delicately beautiful exploration of love and marriage I've ever seen.
Want to spend a ""thinky"" evening? Watch this with some friends and then have dinner. My wife and I still talk about this film and what it means.
But watch this film. Its truly outstanding. I'd give it 5 stars except for Andie MacDowell and slightly watering down the play's original script.",1024444800,28,1784,4.630914826498422

The cast is fine with well known actors like Oscar nominee Greg Kinnear, Dennis Quaid, Andie MacDowell, and Toni Collette playing the two couples. This ninety-five minute drama focuses on two marriages. Kinnear and Quaid look more like brothers than friends.

The DVD would be useful if they had the actual play too. A behind the scenes look at the movie would have been nice. In the end, I found seeing this movie didn't aspire me to see a live performance of the play. For starters, I found both couples to be unlikable and even boring.
