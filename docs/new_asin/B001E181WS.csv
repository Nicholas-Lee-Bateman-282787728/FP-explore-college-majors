3545188,4,B001E181WS,I enjoyed this version of 'The Nutcracker' very much. The costumes and scenery and stage mechanics were very well thought out and a joy to see. The choreography was also a little different from most of the other Nutcracker DVD's I own. I particularly liked the battle between the toy soldiers and the mice. Also the 'Waltz of the Flowers' was more varied and interesting than most other versions I've seen. I think a lot of thought went into the details of this ballet and overall it has a very whimsical and lighthearted feel.,1225411200,9,527,4.617021276595745
8295942,1,B001E181WS,"If you want a good Nutcracker dvd, Do Not Buy This One! It is the cheapest, crappiest productio I ever saw. Luckily, the dvd was defective (stuck after 5 minutes), so I could return if for defective. I have seen High School productions better than this. All the curtains, stage, costumes, were dirty and awful looking. The dancers looked ematiated for any lack of nutrition. The music sound was tinny. OMG, my 3 year old was mortally afraid of the thing. Had to hit eject after the waltz of the flowers. I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea.",1514851200,2,555,4.346153846153846

8295948,5,B001E181WS,"This was a charming, sublime performance by a company who should really release more of themselves out on DVD. We have a ton of Royal Ballet DVDs for sale, but the other two famous English companies - Birmingham Royal Ballet and English National Ballet - seem shy to deal themselves out to the public via recordings.

Still, I am very happy to own this version of The Nutcracker. Sir Peter Wrights production has awesome choreography, stunning sets, and beautiful costumes that brings the whole story to life. The music and dancing is top-notch.

Joseph Cipolla is mysterious as Drosselmeyer; Sandra Madgwick is pretty and sweet as Clara; Irek Mukhamedov is charming and has a strong presence as the Nutcracker/Prince; and Miyako Yoshida stands out beautifully as the Sugar Plum Fairy.

Some highlights -

- The Battle against the Mice: really well done by everyone involved. It looked realistic and I felt tingles of fear despite the fact that I knew Clara and the Prince would survive it.

- Camera angles: superb. Magnificent. Capturing everything you want to see at the perfect moment.

- The tutus worn by the Mirlitons. I want one of them!

On a side note...I believe the Sugar Plum Fairy has become Miyako Yoshidas signature role. She has actually been recorded in the role three times on DVD (once here and twice with the Royal Ballet).",1450051200,5,1344,4.842794759825328
8295949,5,B001E181WS,"Having danced in the Nutcracker and an avid fan of experiencing it every holiday season, this is absolutely the best I have ever seen.  I have already watched it twice.  The choreography and dancing are just superb, and the costumes and staging are just exceptional.  You can't go wrong with this one.",1418947200,4,301,4.75
8295950,4,B001E181WS,Enjoyed the video but lighting is abit dark.  Strong dancers.  I would recommend this production to other Nutcracker collectors.  Enough,1389916800,,136,5.7
