8375944,2,B002OCX5WW,"Bundy: A Legacy of Evil, 2008 film

The story begins with a horrific murder, one of dozens, in a deserted area. Next Bundy is in jail on death row. He is asked for information on his victims for the benefit of their families. [To recover the remains?]. Outside people celebrate his coming execution. They start with Teds past history, family problems. Later Ted attended the University of Washington where he got a degree in psychology. Ted talks about his tough times as a youth to his girl friend: he drove a Rambler instead of a T-Bird! His girlfriend Steffanie ended their relationship with insults. Its over! Ted goes to the Records Bureau to research his birth records and learns shocking news: he is illegitimate (his older sister was really his mother).

The movies emphasis on Teds murders seems pornographic. Or are they suggesting he was insane when he committed his crimes? Ted volunteered for a Suicide Prevention Hotline. [Was he looking for victims?] Take care of yourself first! Does he have the ability to manipulate peoples thinking? It shows him offering rides to young women. Ted is involved with politics. Ted travels to San Francisco. But he leaves after proposing to Steffanie in a restaurant! [How humiliating!] They show him driving around country dirt roads. A patrolman inspects his car, then arrests him on reasonable suspicion. Ted escaped from his jail cell! He breaks into a house and bludgeons young women to death! A killing spree shows his disturbed mind. [A perfect argument for the death penalty; it deters a murderer from killing again.]

But he is caught. He will serve as his own defense lawyer (he also studied law in college). He asks a police detective to describe the murder scene at the sorority house. [Is he making it worse for himself?] It was a gruesome scene! Ted was found guilty and given the death penalty. The judge said it was a shame he chose the wrong path in life. Whose fault was it? Ted says society and pornography caused his criminal actions. But he made every choice along the way. Ted was normal, but a whiny, immature, little boy said the warden. [Nobody mentioned the effects of society on an individual.] Ted repented and took communion. Teds mother visited him to say farewell. Everything will be fine. On Friday he is awakened for his preparation and last meal. The prison guards drag him to the electric chair. Its finally over.

You will learn more about this notorious serial killer by reading a book. Ann Rule, a former deputy sheriff, wrote The Stranger Beside Me, a better story than this movie (which provides only part of the story). There are many young boys who grow up without a father, they all don't turn into serial killers (but may be handicapped without a normal family life). Few children have perfect lives, there are always problems in life that have to be overcome. Usually a family will help but there are always limits.",1468713600,,2909,4.788844621513944
8375945,1,B002OCX5WW,"To get right to the point, this is the worst rendition of the crimes of Ted Bundy as well as the story behind the serial killer.  From the ridiculously long scenes, to the equally ridiculous music that tracks most of these scenes, I found this to be a boring, slow moving and continually disjointed account of the life of Bundy.  The only thing going for this version is the fact that Corin Nemec does bear a resemblance to Ted, but that's where it ends.  Nemec's over the top rendition of Bundy, and the poor choice of girl songs and other music makes this a movie I wish I had not taken the time to watch. The movie shows no references to where Ted is at the time of killings failing to track his movements throughout Washington, Colorado, Utah and Florida, however date/year pop ups appear from time to time. I was so lost as to the timeline of the story that several times I fought off the impulse to just quit watching.  Out of nowhere Ted is arrested by some bad cop who forces Bundy to allow an examination of his car.  We have no idea where this arrest takes place, and then we're taken to a jail cell where Bundy escapes. He then lays waste to some sleeping female victims which I assume to be the sorority killings in Tallahassee, FL.  We then see ONE courtroom scene that is so obscure and meaningless, and ends with Bundy receiving his death sentence.  If you're looking for a more accurate story of Bundy's crimes and the people who helped catch him, check out ""The Deliberate Stranger,"" which buries this version of a poorly directed, written and produced story.",1356566400,4,1576,4.470383275261324
