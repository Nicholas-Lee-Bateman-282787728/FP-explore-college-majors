3792239,5,B001TK9GO6,"I am glad to have watched this movie. It was refreshing to see a real and deep story as opposed to the same plot offered by Hollywood mainstream films. The lead actress portrayed her pain and suffering in such a subtle way. She never asks for pity and even though you want to feel sorry for her, you are with her and on her side every moment of the story, rooting for her to make it. An original film that has heart. Highly recommended.",1307318400,6,436,4.2023809523809526
3792240,5,B001TK9GO6,"This movie is unflinching in its look at a very real part of our culture.  It's not a happy ending feel good kind of story.  What it is....its real, it's thought invoking, it's inspiring, and it gives one a chance to look at this lifestyle with more compassion and less judgement.  These people exist, and if you get to the heart, just like everyone else, trying to make their way in the world.
The actors in this film are phenomenal.  The directing and writing beautiful, and as good as anything Ive seen on the big screen.  This movie is storytelling at its best.",1305244800,5,565,4.446601941747573
3792241,5,B001TK9GO6,"One Hour Fantasy Girl (2009) is an artistic yet raw look at real life; this is based on a true story. The film is a poignant view at the life of Brandi (Kelly-Ann Tursi), a fantasy girl. With dreams of a better life and more money she begins working as a fantasy girl to work towards her goal of real estate investing. She will create and participate in any man's fantasy as long as she does not have to kiss or be nude. Haunted by her childhood and unable to sleep she turns to meditation and chanting with little effect but wants no pity from anyone about her situation.

On the streets of Hollywood Becky Lewis appears to be just another girl with loosely tied back hair and oversized t-shirts, but in room 102 of The California Sunshine Motel she becomes Brandi and participates in a world she knows little about. Chi (Paul D. Nguyen), her business partner, arranges everything including her first client. Roger (Jon Morgan Woodward) is a large man that never lost his baby fat and fantasies about infancy. He knows what he wants and Brandi gives it to him; a bottle filled with vodka, and rub on his head, and baby games are all part of the sessions. Being experienced with these encounters he instructs her to do more profound things in later visits testing her strength.

Bobby (Joe Luckay) has just come to town from Montana and finds himself alone. After visiting her website he calls to find out more and is immediately drawn in. He is an odd young man looking to build his discipline by lying in bed with her. Innocent and sincere with knowledge of her beliefs bring them closer than she would like. She fights to control the situation and his consistent advances but really needs a good person in her life. Bobby and Roger along with other interesting people will shape her life forever. Dianthia (Kalena Knox) works at an all night diner offering solace to Brandi during her sleepless nights but is fighting for her own survival.

9 out of 10 - This eye popping glimpse into another lifestyle turns out to be very compelling; the choices made on the path for happiness as you come into adulthood can make or break you. Mesmerizing and ravenous electronic music by Nima Fakhrara accompanies the scenes and perfectly compliments the pace of the film. The writing, direction, production, and acting are all done with passion that shines on the screen - Kelly-Ann Tursi provides a deeply emotional performance. The subject matter could have made this uncomfortable to watch, but it is so well done and does not cross the line and there is no nudity. A few scenes do have or imply some very alternative sexual activities.

3792242,5,B001TK9GO6,"I don't have a large DVD collection, but I had to purchase this movie.  I was fortunate enough to go to a screening, which was packed.  This story is so original, and had everything that I look for: entertainment, characters that are interesting and that one empathizes with, humor, and some romance.  I think many people will relate to many of the characters in the movie.  The movie is also very well edited and shot.  It's very professional for an indie movie.  I give it 5 stars!",1236211200,4,483,4.494252873563219
3792243,5,B001TK9GO6,"From the opening sequence I was fully engaged, pulled in to find out what was going on, and what would happen next. The script stays a step ahead, providing interesting and creative twists and turns. This movie is an original. I found myself really hoping things would turn out okay for the main character. The ending is thought-provoking and satisfying, and I really hope there is a sequel so I can learn what happens next.",1235433600,5,424,4.666666666666667
3792244,5,B001TK9GO6,"I saw One Hour Fantasy Girl at a Bradley University screening a few months back. OHFG is an intense ride of emotions from beginning to end, through twists and turns unseen. Becky's story clings to your heart and leaves you craving for more than just one hour of fantasy. I am proud to include this film in my collection.",1235347200,3,320,4.440677966101695
8341957,1,B001TK9GO6,"Acting especially by the lead, was unengaging. She had no personality and her ambition was lost. She literally smiled once in the entire film. This movie was filmed in a way that you felt you were watching a bad home video. Most parts made no sense. The person who wrote this, may not have been a fantasy girl... because there was zero depth to the characters. The creepy ass cafe, was just a question mark. The story line far fetched... at times I had high hopes. I do like the context... the people involved could have made a deep film with some changes. I watched the entire thing which means a lot. I hate to be so cruel, but I have to be honest.",1484352000,,650,4.25

8341966,4,B001TK9GO6,"I happened to stumble across this film completely by chance through a series of Tweets and I am so happy that I did.
Like a lot of indie films it leaves you with something to think about afterwards which I love about it but as a general whole I think this films causes you to really think, it's well scripted, well put together and if you like dark dramas that you pretty much won't find anywhere else I would highly recommend this film.
NoRestrictions seems to make a lot of thought provoking films and I love this!",1308009600,5,516,4.329896907216495
