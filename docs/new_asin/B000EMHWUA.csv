2523422,5,B000EMHWUA,this was a gift for my son. he loves these dvds . what a great deal 4 dvds for the price was incredible.,1161993600,2,104,3.5652173913043477
2523423,1,B000EMHWUA,"What a disappointment - EVERY cartoon in this collection has a BIG, UGLY yellow-orange ""MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT"" LOGO slapped on it! Adding to insult is the fact that some entries (Cobweb Hotel, for example) are so poorly recorded as to be unwatchable: blocky artifacts, flashing, focus problems and more. I threw mine in the trash and will NEVER buy a Mill Creek disc again, ever.",1147910400,88,382,4.892307692307693
2523424,5,B000EMHWUA,"For the price you really can't complain too much. There are about 2/3 of the set that I rate as good cartoons that I'd watch again. Obviously some real clunkers, like THREE STOOGES, the HOFFNUNG & the MR PIPER ones which don't appeal to me liking the bizarre 1930s ones, fortunately there are lots of those on here! Many are typical public domain quality, the worst one is the wonderful COBWEB HOTEL Fleisher Toon which is rough at the start. Some have extra noise too from worn films. 5 stars for 2/3 being good toons & the price.

There are loads of Popeye (23 of them, almost all the post Fleischer ones), just one Casper & Woody Woodpecker, which may disappoint, but the Woody one is a great early 40s one.

BEWARE buying this set if you own the 100 Cartoon collection (with the dog pen drawing on the front) and the 101 Set (from Australia) as these duplicate most of this set. The 101 set copies 75% of this set in the same order!

2523425,4,B000EMHWUA,"Let me start off by saying that this is the best bang for your buck if you want these hard to find works, and this 4 disc collection has the best versions of these toons I have yet seen, and wide variety to boot!

However, do not think you can sit the kids down unattended, this is a historical collection and contains many cartoons with stereotyped and racial characterizations.

Overall, this may be the best place to start building a collection of works from this bygone era of entertainment.",1143244800,32,495,4.550561797752809

2523437,2,B000EMHWUA,"Cartoons are much older than expected and the titles of the shows only name the title of the cartoon and not if it is Casper or Woody Wood Pecker. When skipping through it will skip several cartoons so you can't just go to the next one. Disk 1 is all black and white and Disk 2 is most all black and white. I still have not seen Chilli Willie which is the cartoon I wanted to see.  This would be great for someone in their 60's or 70's to watch but I am 40 and wanted more woody wood pecker, casper and chili willie. Disappointed.",1418601600,,530,4.0476190476190474

2523448,1,B000EMHWUA,"BEWARE: There are no woody woodpecker cartoons on these DVD's all, nor any Mighty Mouse episodes whatsoever. Why are they depicted in the DVD cover? No idea. And why the bright advertizing colors? Hmm...  Note that these are ALL EXTREMELY OLD videos and poorly done toons I have never heard of, much less seen, in my thirty-something years. Primarily very choppy black and whites that MAYBE my grandparents would recognize if it were easier to make out and hear.
Very poor quality of sound and picture on most of these clips/episodes. NOT as expected from the picture on the DVD cover. Unfortunately it is very misleading. Not the familiar, well created toons I was awaiting and anticipating seeing again, although there were MANY back to back ancient, early versions of popeye ( and he IS on the cover. ) Don't appreciate the bait and switch. Disappointed for sure.  :(",1350432000,2,870,4.832214765100671

2523451,4,B000EMHWUA,I really enjoyed these cartoon some of my favorites are the one about time and the french Escargots. and I have a question about the pied piper where did it come from if anybody knows. I love the Popeye and Betty boop is there more pied piper toons. I wish they had more of Casper Cartoons by them selves. The Lost Dream is a lot like somewhere in dreamland. Do they have anymore pied piper and the bouncing ball cartoons and melody toons,1315785600,2,438,4.289156626506024
2523452,3,B000EMHWUA,"I bought this for the 'Cobweb Hotel' and wasn't disappointed in that part of it.  My disappointment came when I was going to show the Betty Boop cartoons to my granddaughter...that disc was defective & unreadable.  It was new & sealed.

2523455,1,B000EMHWUA,"Do not buy this DVD set, as most of the cartoons are in Black & White, because they are probably very very old. The sound and video quality is atrocious and one of the DVDs did not even work properly. My kids did not like it at all.",1267315200,2,232,3.8541666666666665

2523457,5,B000EMHWUA,I have this DVD and it is a great addition to our collection.  My 4 year old daughter prefers them to anything else.  I loved them as a child and now I find myself glued to the TV when I have them on for my daughter.,1226707200,4,216,3.6739130434782608
2523458,2,B000EMHWUA,"Some of the films are watermarked with an ugly logo (imo a sacrilege). Also all films have been chopped and cropped to fit the standard 4:3 letterbox-TV.

I find the selection of films a little strange. Wasn't this supposed to be classics? Of course Betty Boop and Popye can be called classics, but there's some obscure stuff in there, including clay animations(!). Early clay animations may of course be of interest to many, but it was certainly not something I expected, and I don't think you can call the clay animations *cartoon* classics.",1217721600,2,543,4.838709677419355

Video dubs on ""150 Cartoon Classics"" vary from very good quality to barely fair. There's no evidence here of digital enhancement. Some shorts are taken from 16mm b&w prints once sold for home use, even though the originals were in color. One example is ""Jingles"" (it's actually ""Mendelssohn's Spring Song"" -- ""Jingles"" being the series name). Although b&w here, this was originally in ""Brewster Color.""  Audio is generally clear, however a few titles have unsynched sound and picture. Also, MILL CREEK flashes their logo on-screen for several seconds midway through each short.

Betty Boop is most plentiful in this collection, followed by Popeye and The New 3 Stooges. Less-common cartoons include works from Britain, France and Canada. Studios represented: AUDIO PRODUCTIONS, BREWSTER, CAMBRIA, CORNELL, FAMOUS, FLEISCHER, HALAS & BATCHELOR, JEFFERSON, LANTZ, NEW WORLD, PIED PIPER, POWERS, SOFAC, SULLIVAN, TERRYTOON, VAN BEUREN and WINKLER.

Alot of these are politically incorrect, crude by today's crystal clear 1080p cgi standards but imho had more heart than stuff i see on tv today. For the price you really can't afford not to have this archive of cartoons your children might otherwise never get to see and reminisce the past yourself. Really hard to complain about the quality of 1930's cartoons on a $5 dvd so i really don't understand some of the bad reviews here and to the person who claimed that ""EVERY TOON HAS BIG UGLY COMPANY LOGO""  i have to disagree.
