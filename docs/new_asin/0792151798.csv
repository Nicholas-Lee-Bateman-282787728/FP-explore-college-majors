7791846,3,0792151798,"A jumbled adventure movie made in Great Britain based loosely, and I mean loosely on a number of Jack Higgind Sean Dillion books.  The story line and the acting is atrocios.  Unless you are in EuroSpy movies. Don't waste you time trying to find this obscure horrid movie (or in this case, a video).",1456444800,,298,4.5
7791847,4,0792151798,Once we found we had to buy a new player (region free) we loved the movie.  First book we had read by Jack Higgins and were anxious to watch the movie.  Had never heard of the regions and Thunder Point wouldn't play on our player as it had been filmed in England.  Once we got the new player it was a very enjoyable movie.  Just couldn't get my head around Kyle McClatchin as Sean Dillon though !!!!,1352851200,,399,4.142857142857143
7791848,1,0792151798,"I have to say, I am a big Jack Higgins fan but hadn't read this book and foolishly bought the DVD first. I doubt now whether I will bother with the book. Having seen ""The Eagle has Landed"" in the cinema years ago I assumed this would be another cracker - how wrong I was, as from beginning to end it was truly awful. Hammy acting, poor plot, poor casting, too much knife violence seemingly just for the sake of it and the ending - OMG it was like they left it open to make a sequel!! Please preserve us from that.",1275350400,,513,4.03921568627451
7791849,1,0792151798,"Other than the title of the movie, and the characters names, this film bore no relation to the book.  Even minor items, such as Dillon's history was completely altered, not to mention that MacLachan was completely inappropiate for the part of a short, fair haired sardonic Irishman.
A complete waste of time.",1237334400,,308,4.923076923076923
7791850,1,0792151798,"This was a very predictable movie until the end which I will not give away, but don't expect resolution or any happy ending.",1117929600,,124,4.434782608695652
7791851,3,0792151798,"This film might have been decent if only they would have stuck to the book.  The film carried similarities to the novel but also change the setting and the characters. The movie takes place in Montreal for some reason, not the island like in the book. The relationship between Dillion and Jenny was completely different than the book but I think for the better.  The only good part about this film was the actor Kyle Mclauchlen who did a magneficient job as Dillion except for the major physical differences between him and Dillion.  See this movie if you are  a major fan but rent it first.",1057795200,,591,4.547169811320755
7791852,5,0792151798,"If you like espionage action with light humor, sexual tension and lots of high-energy tackles (on the fighting gun-toting front, anyway) you'll appreciate this movie. There actually IS a plot too!! I liked it most because I like Kyle MacLachlan. His screen presence never fails to disappoint, from ""Dune"" to ""XChange."" Check it out!!!",1054857600,2,334,5.203703703703703
7791853,1,0792151798,"I'm a big Dillon fan, so when I saw this I had to watch it. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. Many details in the story, including Dillon's looks, (He's white blonde with hard, clear eyes, not dark haired! And he's  short, too!) the heroine's character, and the eventual outcome were  completely ignored.  And I'm sorry, but that submarine looked really  crappy.  This is one of my favorite Higgins books, and I can't believe they  slaughtered it.",933552000,18,455,4.921052631578948
