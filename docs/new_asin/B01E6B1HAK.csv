7731344,4,B01E6B1HAK,"Excellent performances. I have always admired the work of Gregory Harrison, (North Beach, It's My Party, et al) and so it was good to see him, full gray head and wonderful. Tom Wopat has also been a favorite, he was very believable as the grief- stricken widower and father. Though nothing really new is presented, the treatment of familiar narratives is handled in a comparatively subtle, reasonable and intelligent manner. Just a political note: We have hopefully learned or are learning the lesson that trying to mess with a human being's genetic, social and psychological predispositions is NOT a human endeavor anyone should engage in, and certainly not under the guise of religion--religion has enough problems. Let God do his work and let humans keep the heck out if it. BTW: The actor Michael Grant, who plays James, was excellent playing the piano. Of course, as a piano prodigy (winning a Tennessee piano competition at age 6), I would expect as much, but it certainly made for great casting and quite enjoyable to hear and see the fingers move and the music sound as it should. Particularly, his Chopin Etude, The Revolutionary Etude, was so right for that moment in the film. Bravo, Mr. Grant!",1480377600,10,1205,4.882926829268293

7731361,5,B01E6B1HAK,"100% accurate and dead on.  I am a Christian, true to my faith, and yet tormented by my sexual attraction to the same sex.  This movie hit the mark!  What James went through in the movie, was very accurate.  His feelings, True feelings, from his heart, and, from his hormones.  Yet, Christian ministers that were in his life, who have no concept of what it is like to be a male attracted to males, who believe in their faith and the Word of God, trying to convince you of 'TRUTH', ignorant of the fact that their can be anything different, to the fact of a male attracted to another male, will ram their faith down your throat.  I believe in the Word of God, the Bible, 100%, yet I am attracted to the same sex.  That puts me into a delimna.  I deal with this struggle every day.  and so did the characters of this movie.  and on top of all this, the man of the family, the father, driving to pressure his son into doing what is right, or else.  Again, same struggles that I go through every day.  Movie, gets 5 stars.  100% on the mark.  Very well done.  Good acting.  by all.  Highly recommended.",1513468800,12,1098,4.2270531400966185

7731376,5,B01E6B1HAK,"Great film even though I don't understand why the deleted scenes were left out.  It can't be for time constraints because they're only about 5 minutes long in total and would fill in several of the unexplained but obvious cuts in the action.  Chemistry between Josh Green and Michael Grant superlative.  Hope to see more good heartfelt acting by Josh.  Believe it or not, Michael plays beautiful piano for real.  Not just the normal cuts from the actor's face to someone else's hands doing the playing.  The director got it right by flowing from the hands up the body to Michael's face.  He's even fingering the correct piano keys!  I was impressed to no end.  You hear two pieces by Chopin and one by Brahms.  Hoot seeing an older Tom Wopat as the confused father and Gregory Harrison as the ""evil"" converter/therapist.  And, no explosions, no killing, practically no swearing--just a beautifully filmed romance story.  I not only give it two thumbs up, but also five stars.  Enjoy it; rewatch it.

7731386,5,B01E6B1HAK,"This little movie is quite good.  Tom Wopat does a wonderful job as the farmer father who sent his son to a ""Christian"" gay reparative therapy farm.  He wants what he thinks is best for his son, but the son's dreams for this future as well as his sexual orientation are at odds with the father's vision.  Michael Grant as the son turns in a wonderful performance--as good an actor as he seems to be a pianist.  His estranged boyfriend of the past is played by the lovely Josh Green, who radiates good will and sweetness, even in the early scenes when Grant is cruel to him.  There is a wonderful mood to this film.  It's pretty and takes good advantage of the farm setting.  The big turn of events that sets the story in a new direction--all for the better--happens a bit too quickly and the final wrap up comes at a pace much faster that the first half of the film.  However, this is a small fault in an otherwise excellent story about a gay youth growing up and owning his own life despite powers against him.  So many gay films I see are trite, silly or simply badly made.  This film stands out as beautifully made with sensitivity and class.",1496016000,29,1145,4.333333333333333

7731388,4,B01E6B1HAK,"Kid and father live in what looks like a great farmhouse. There should have been at least a couple of other characters on the orchard to flesh out the background.  Grant and Green are both excellent as the boys trying to find their way back to each other after one of them undergoes psychological torture while incarcerated in a Christian gay conversion therapy operation. Wopat and Harrison do well enough with the sort of stereotypical adult characters they're given to play. Eliminate the creepy minister's daughter subplot, and trim a little of almost every other scene in the movie and this could have been even better.

(Also wanted to note the homage to a very different, much better gay coming-of-age story; the woods running scene near the end when the boys finally reunite. The scene is copied more-or-less directly from the 1996 British movie Beautiful Thing, one of the best gay movies of all time. No Cass Elliot soundtrack in Fair Haven, but otherwise it's exactly the same scene, and almost as sweet as the original.)",1495756800,18,1032,4.857954545454546

To reply to a prior comment: Mother was the evangelist and sent Mike to christian, gay-aversion therapy. Wopat, a supposedly simple apple farmer, agreed because he was shocked to discover that his son is gay and would be at a loss as to what to do. Mike was probably discovered in Charlie's arms. Mom died from some irrelevant cause. All that info can be gleaned without any specific dialogue. Dopey Suzy just didn't get the message until it was literally shoved in her face. I thought Wopat's decision to sell the farm came rather suddenly. Great eclectic music except for the vocals including Wopat's. But all's well that ends well.",1491609600,,773,4.608695652173913

7731415,2,B01E6B1HAK,"So, what is worse: a film with a terrible plot & awful acting or a movie that had potential and squandered it with bad cinematography, wooden characters, and wasted scenes. I'm going to choose the awful and state that FAIR HAVEN could have been a solid, 4-star film if the people behind the camera and the screenplay had bothered to work hard.

So, first, the camera work: rarely in the movie do we ever have two characters in a frame conversing. It's constant back and forth to a close-up shot, which was very disconcerting. Like the cliche spectators watching a tennis match, back and forth between actors, who mostly looked sullen rather than convincing any other emotion.

Some spoilers here...mild ones, but it's so predictable in many ways, I cannot imagine much is spoiled.

None of the character development reaches anything near reality. The protagonist wants to be a concert pianist but never practices, never listens to music in his spare time, doesn't even seem to have any books on the subject (in fact, his bedroom is so empty of personality, lacking in gewgaws, that it's obviously a bad set piece. The protagonist is sent off to conversation therapy...but we have no real sense of what he was caught doing. His father (Wopat, wasted and looking wasted) does not inquire at all how things went. And then never discuss anything about his son being gay, believing he is straight--no, they argue over the family farm.

The boyfriend has no real past. We have no idea why these two boys are dating other than they were in high school. Common interests? None. Hobbies for boyfriend? None. Any discussion how abandoning him made him feel? None. He's gaybashed, looks bruised and battered, but that's just a plot ploy to make the dull hero protective. No other gay bashing happens and the guys wounds heal over the course of a picnic.

A girl falls for the troubled hero instantly. She's pretty and would be popular in her clique, but for some reason she becomes bold and aggressive in wanting to date a guy that can barely finish a sentence in under five minutes and has zero personality. The kids all have cell phones that were used prior to 2010 and they never send a text message.

The ending is so obvious and so annoying. Why the father comes around seems to be almost a whim of good faith based on very little--the Hallmark commercial did everything this movie wanted and in far less time.

It's not a horrible movie. But it's also not a good movie. So much more could have been done. But the conversion therapy scenes are weak--it would have been better to make the therapist really manipulative and show how kids get brainwashed. The dad doesn't say a single word to his son's boyfriend, just remains a lump that is not caught in your throat but lower in the GI tract.",1489622400,9,2785,4.659877800407332
7731416,5,B01E6B1HAK,"It amazes me that a film like  this needs to or can be made in 2017.  Its heartbreaking to think that this kind of cruel child abuse continues  (yes, it  is  child abuse).  For the educational value,  I give this five stars instead of four.  There were some rough edges  to the film in terms of performances  and production  values, but overall  I  thought  it was sincere.  I particularly  like the performance of the boy left behind during the ""incarceration."" (NOT A SPOILER. The viewer finds out about this right away). I thought he conveyed a lot of emotion by just facial expression and tone.

Why Suzy keeps coming after James when he obviously isn't really interested. How the mother suddenly died while James was away. A couple of lines of exposition would help.

8757802,4,B01E6B1HAK,"This is not a bad movie but it's not epic.  It features someone who has just completed ex-gay (aka reparative) therapy, then runs into his old boyfriend.  Along the way he gets thrown together with the preacher's daughter at his church.  Things get modestly complicated.

As some others have noted, the scenery is nice, particularly the old farmhouse.  It's not really the season for apples, and the trees either don't have them or they're too small to really see, but the orchard has a steady supply of apples to deliver to wholesale customers--the deliveries are important; a lot of the plot weaves around them.

It's certainly not a waste of time, and it doesn't have anything too dreadful in it.  Some of the relationship developments and life changes are a little abrupt, but it ties together reasonably well in 90 minutes.",1533772800,,828,4.829787234042553
8757803,5,B01E6B1HAK,This was a great movie with a strong storyline.  It is also a prime example of how harmful conversion therapy can be.  It was acted well and the story was believable.  It proves that in the end tolerance and love wins.,1530489600,,218,4.2682926829268295

8757805,5,B01E6B1HAK,"This review goes into detail on the story with editorializing...
The actors inhabited their roles portraying their characters naturally. Excellent casting of the actors for these roles. James and his father Richard were well-written characters of a small-town farming family (theyre in Vermont). Richard was strict (but not over the top) and centered on what he thought was right, while still caring; he was a recent widower with many responsibilities, and as he said of himself he was trying to do the best he could. He wanted his son James to be realistic and be prepared to run the farm, but James did not want to run the farm; instead, he wanted to go to music school and become a professional in music.

The dynamic of the tension between duty, respect, and individual identity was realistically portrayed. James respected his father, and this came through. It was nice to see that 19-year olds latent adolescent angst did not boil over into a tired litany of disrespect toward his father. There was one exception at one point when James said some horribly harsh things to his father. I did not like how he spoke to his father in that scene at all (it was at about the 1-hour 10-minute mark); he was unnecessarily cold and mean.

And the Christian therapist seemed earnest: he was even keel (calm and nice-like) in his approach to try to encourage James to turn away from his homosexual feelings. Though, of course, his approach will be controversial depending on viewer beliefs.

The dynamic between Charlie and James had an emotional zig-zag pattern that seemed realistic, though they also seemed surprisingly mature and put together to the point where I was sort of suspicious of the writers straining the realism of the protagonists situation. For example, we never see anything of Charlies family. What are they like? Whats the dynamic there? The tension that James goes through between his feelings for Charlie and his Christian beliefs (though he seemed more culturally Christian than Christian by belief but the therapy center may have had a lot to do with that) were palpable for a short time, and then his choice made more sense later in the movie.

Reverend Thomass daughter Suzy was an interesting addition to the story. She essentially asked James out on a date and how he handled that when they went on their first date together (the realistic cringe-y scene when they were in the truck after they left the diner and its clear he is struggling with his sexual orientation and trying to do the right thing in some way to how to have an intimate relationship with a woman etc). Many of the characters were sympathetic, in my opinion, and they went through some realistic internal and interpersonal ups and downs. This was a carefully crafted script that felt genuine almost every step of the way. Although, Suzys actions seemed just a little bit contrived at times (how her character was written, not the acting). Though, I suppose I can see how she could be a realistic character in that context.

The reason that Jamess father sent him to conversion therapy was a twist of sorts, as his father wasn't a Fundamentalist, but it was more a cultural thing and he and Jamess mother were concerned and because his late wifes Christian faith was critically important to her. This was a sad situation that was turned a little bit sideways in the last scene. James explains this (reading between the lines) as he talks with Charlie later in the movie. Richard wanted the family to continue and for the farm to stay in the family; he needed James to start a family (with a woman) for that legacy to continue. That makes sense. Like he said several times, he just wanted the best for his son and he thought that a homosexual lifestyle was not the best for his son. Logical. I don't see any bad motives from Richard toward his son.

Jamess father Richard was an earnest and sympathetic character, and the decision he made at the end and his heartfelt conversation with James was extraordinary. Though, I do wonder if the writers were pushing an agenda with the neat and tidy happy ending of the last 15 minutes of the movie. I mean, James gets what he thinks he wants, but Richard is sort of left there to retireto what exactly? Richard was the courageous figure here, it seems to me, especially when he said: The farm isn't family, we are. Overall, the story was compelling. This movie was so well made with very well-crafted characters, that it would make sense to make a sequel to see what happens with James and Charlie.",1529884800,,4531,4.7146464646464645
8757806,4,B01E6B1HAK,"Wonderful low key gay romance. Every character is treated well (even though I was ready to hate the deprogrammer). Talented actors all around, and nice restrained direction. Beautiful cinematography (I love all the red, blue, and greenthe primary colors in light). Doesnt hurt at all that the two boys are gorgeous. Have fun finding errors in continuity (check the shirt James is wearing when he leaves to deliver apples to Charlies store, and the one he arrives in, for one). Michael Grant really plays the piano! If you're a sucker for romance, this is for you. James Henderson",1528070400,,579,4.918367346938775

like the father and son could have been REAL IN LIFE.  I always enjoy watching films with young men that are talented piano players.
The acting was excellent, and the story line was very sensitive and touching.  I highly recommend it.",1526947200,,369,4.462686567164179
