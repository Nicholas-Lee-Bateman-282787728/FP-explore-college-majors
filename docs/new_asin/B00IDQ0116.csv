8641300,3,B00IDQ0116,"Let me tell you something.  This album is not great.  It is simply ok.  I bought it for someone with a whole lotta issues.  It seems to help them during their constant emotional turmoil, so that's why it's 3 stars, here.  But I can tell you that the music is somewhat slight.  However, if you are in need of just *any* self-help, at all, you will likely be persuaded to no longer think about your problems for awhile - or at least for a half-hour.",1426118400,,447,4.2
