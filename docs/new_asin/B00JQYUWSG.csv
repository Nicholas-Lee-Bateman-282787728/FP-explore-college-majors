6389143,5,B00JQYUWSG,"If you're looking at this DVD set (containing all 3 seasons from TV, plus the one on Netflix), you probably already know that this is one of the best series ever so your hesitation is probably only regarding if you should buy the set. You should. This is a series that only gets better on subsequent watchings because it's full of set ups and subtle stuff that you probably missed the first or second time around. The writing is sharp and the cast is superb. Stop debating and just get it. Go on. Do it. Do it now.",1430438400,3,514,4.255102040816326
6389144,5,B00JQYUWSG,Arrested development is my favorite television show out there! The writing is incredible. I always wonder how they can be so creative with there plots with so many subplots all intertwining perfectly together. Getting ready for season 4!!!! Let the countdown begin.,1429920000,,265,5.333333333333333

6389147,5,B00JQYUWSG,"A well written comedy. Too bad it didn't run for more seasons. The special purchase price was the tremendous attraction for me. The collection arrived on time, as estimated. Good packaging, as well.  Well done. Thanks, Amazon!",1427760000,,226,5.108108108108108

6389149,2,B00JQYUWSG,"I don't believe there a single bad episode in the first 3 seasons of Arrested Development.  It is that good.  Arrested ushered in the next-generation comedy of the millennium in a way that no other shows have been able to fully replicate.  I have to be honest and say that the fourth season should not and does not belong with the first three seasons.  It is exactly like the botched retouch of the painting ""Ecce Homo"" by a nun (originally painted by El&iacute;as Garc&iacute;a Mart&iacute;nez in 1930).

Here are the reasons why:
1. Different directors - many of the original directors have moved on to bigger and better things like the Russo brothers (Community, Captain America: The Winter Soldier)
2. Different writers - same thing with the directors
3. Character centric episodes - The actors all had busy schedules so they could not be filmed together.  What made the first three seasons so funny was seeing the interactions and reactions between the characters.
4. Pacing - The original three seasons were filmed for 30 minute broadcast, so they came out to around 20-25 minutes.  The new season, because it was made for internet, stretched it to around 40 minutes.  A lot of times in the original three seasons, they would cut the scene when it stopped being funny.  In the fourth season, many jokes overstayed their welcome (at the point of unbecoming jokes).
5. Amateur sound editing - As an editor & sound editor, I'm very sensitive to the different layers of audio.  The genius of the first three seasons was that if the writers wanted to do a subtle joke, they would reduce the volume of a character's dialogue or change the left/right channels so that it wouldn't be so direct.  This would create a nice, textured sound that worked along with the show's colorful range of humor.  This is no longer the case with the fourth season.  Every single line of dialogue is both visually and audibly in your face.  There is no art of subtlety.

Netflix should have left Arrested Development alone so that it would keep it's legendary cult status.  I'll just keep imagining the fourth season never existed.",1424995200,6,2111,4.774104683195592
6389150,5,B00JQYUWSG,"An absolutely hysterical show.  The movie Frozen stole two funny lines: ""Finish each others sandwiches"" and the chicken ""dance""; too bad this show got canceled.  You pick up more of the jokes if you know the actors lives and what roles they played in before (other shows and commericials).",1424995200,7,289,4.877551020408164

8653466,4,B00JQYUWSG,"Awesome Series if you like weird goofy shows. The show follows the fictitious Bluth family, a formerly wealthy and habitually dysfunctional family. It is presented in a continuous format, incorporating handheld camera work and voice-over narration, as well as the use of occasional archival photos and historical footage. Definitely worth the purchase for all the goof balls out there.",1482969600,,385,5.5423728813559325

8653468,5,B00JQYUWSG,"One of the season 2 discs is scratched, so a couple scenes from, like two episodes on that disc are skipped over after a brief picture delay.",1465430400,,141,4.2592592592592595
8653469,5,B00JQYUWSG,"Always amusing, and often brilliantly funny, inventive, surreal series about a rich family gone terribly wrong, and the one sane one trying to hold things together.

Sort of what you might have gotten if George Bernard Shaw, Kaufman and Hart and Monty Python had teamed up to do a spin on a traditional sitcom.

The acting is terrific, from top to bottom. Even producer Ron Howard's narration is great.

Not every joke works, but as it gets weirder and weirder (and funnier and funnier), all I could think is ""how the hell did they ever get this on network TV? And thank god they did!""

On re-viewing, I found the first season a little less brilliant, a little more repetitious, but maybe that was because they had to fill 30+ episodes. The second season, with only 18 episodes, goes through the roof much more often, with more clever twists and ideas per episode, and more aggressive weirdness. And the third season is truly insane (occasionally over-the-top, but usually successfully), with the addition of elements like Scott Baio's Bob Lawbla character, and self-referential episodes like `Save Our Bluths' slyly commenting on the original series' coming cancellation - one of the worst mistakes in the history of television.

Season 4, done years after the original series had ended,  (for me) didn't quite match the brilliance of it's predecessors.  By focusing each episode on an individual character, the inherent one-joke nature of each separate character became a bit more clear and frustrating.  This seemed to work better as an ensemble piece, with just enough of each version of each character's very different insanity every episode.  Still better than almost all TV comedy, and if you're a fan you'll want to have the whole four series.  But for me the 4th 'revival' season showed just how hard it is to re-capture lightening in a bottle.",1441324800,,1853,4.929260450160772
8653470,5,B00JQYUWSG,fantastic show. witty and so funny. wish it lasted longer. dvds came on time and were exactly as advertised.,1433980800,,108,4.7368421052631575
