Its strength still lies in character, specifically Lola.

Lola, based on an alcoholic woman Inge got to know attending AA meetings for his own alcohol problem, is riven with insecurities. A premarital pregnancy, disownment by her father, a miscarried child, her husband Doc's emotionally forced marriage to her, and his subsequent embitterment at lost innocence and opportunity, manifesting in alcoholism and failure, these keep her a bundle of tormented insecurity, a victim, and a woman missing and constantly yearning for what might have been. Little Sheba, a dog she and Doc once owned but that ""Just vanished one day ... vanished into thin air"" (act 1, sc. 1), never seen but always present, serves as the grand metaphor for what both she and Doc sacrificed. And in her case, for her hope that one day perhaps they might regain a bit of what brought them together years ago. Her immediate concern, however, is a reoccurrence of Doc's binge drinking, in abeyance for a year at the opening of the play/film.

It's this sense of Lola walking on eggshells coupled with Doc's controlled and passive behavior, the feeling he is working at containing his true emotions, that provide the tension driving the entire first act, and finally released in an explosive second act.

Shirley Booth played Lola on Broadway and in the film version. She won a Tony and an Oscar for her performances.

In the second act, the true Doc reveals himself, when all the anger, resentment, and hatred he keeps bottled up spills forth. He falls off the wagon as he comes to realize that Marie, their college boarder, is not the flower of innocence he imagines her to be. Her dalliance with Turk, the young track star, stirs up his anger with Lola and what she cost him, at his own impetuousness mirrored by Turk, and by what he sees as the betrayal of her fianc Bruce that translates into Lola's betrayal of Doc's young love.

Sidney Blackmer portrayed Doc on Broadway, winning a Tony for his performance. Burt Lancaster played Doc in the film. (Though his performance tends to skew too much to passive, leaving Doc one dimensional. Also, despite some obvious makeup, he appears too young for Booth.)

Modern audiences might wonder why Lola stays with Doc, who clearly has psychologically, and probably physically, abused her, and himself, for years, and, by extension, why women abused by spouses return to their husbands. In the case of Lola and Doc, they are a couple married to the pain and failure of their lives. Doc needs Lola to care for him and Lola needs Doc to feel wanted, and both need each other to allay the loneliness and emptiness of their lives and their shared loss. For these reasons, it continues to be a story worthy of your reading and viewing time.",1428278400,,3232,5.302734375

2081525,5,B0002ERWXC,"Shirley Booth and Burt Lancaster are excellent in this film. It's the story of an alcoholic and his ""dependent personality disordered"" spouse. She lives in the past and exemplifies this by mourning the loss of her dog, ""Little Sheba"". He works hard at staying sober through AA. When a young woman takes up residence as a boarder in their home, their frail structure of self-control collapses and they revert back to the vicious cycle of drinking and spousal abuse. There is a powerful moral to this story...we all have a ""Little Sheba"" in our past. It's something that we lost or an action we deeply regret, and years later, are still trying to fix or amend. In the end, the wife sadly realizes that Little Sheba isn't coming back. They both realize it's time to move forward.

It is comparable to the emotionally stoic yet moving performances by Maria Schell in The Hanging Tree and Luise Ranier in The Good Earth. Also, Eileen Heckhart's stand-alone performance as the grieving mother in The Bad Seed compares in luminescence to Shirley Booth's (except for the adroit comic relief she infuses into her own tragedy in The Bad Seed). Burt Lancaster created excellent tension in his role as Lola's husband.  He is one of my favorite actors and this is my favorite of all his roles.",1391644800,,604,4.798076923076923

2081549,5,B0002ERWXC,"Burt Lancaster and Shirley Booth are fantastic in this movie.  Their talent shows in the raw emotion of the characters they portray.  Shirley's character ""Lola"" is married to Burt's character ""Doc.""  Lola and Doc have no children and a loveless marriage for the most part.  Lola has a dog named ""Sheba"" who is not shown because he ran away.  Hence, the title, COME BACK LITTLE SHEBA.  Doc is an alcoholic who has bouts of rage.  Lola is a house wife who is always fearful Doc will start drinking.  Doc and Lola rent a room to an attractive young woman and a personal crisis ensues.  Great performances by truly timeless actors!!!",1386115200,,629,4.6454545454545455
2081550,4,B0002ERWXC,"""Come Back, Little Sheba"" received a great deal of attention at the time it was made for the performance of Shirley Booth.  But, Burt Lancaster is equally good in bringing this dark and claustrophobic William Inge play to life.

If you are old enough to remember the 1950's, then you will recognize that Inge captured the moral climate exceptionally well.  ""Doc"" and Lola Delaney (Lancaster and Booth) are a middle-aged couple (in a time when 40 was considered ""over the hill"") and they are childless.  In the 1950's, childlessness was considered a curse, and easily became a companion condition to alcoholism.

Doc and Lola live in a pleasant neighborhood, in a college town.  But they never get out, and they have no friends.  Lola seems to have no life at all except to wait for Doc to return from work--- listening to insipid escapism on the radio.

In the very first scene of the movie, Terry Moore (Howard Hughes protege) arrives as ""Marie"", a precocious college student majoring in art, looking for a room that Lola has advertised.  In no time at all, Marie has inveigled her way into renting Lola's ""sewing room"" in the front of the house.  Marie, although engaged, is enough of a flirt to entertain a loutish athlete called ""Turk"" (Richard Jaeckel).  Marie and Turk become the stand-ins for the children Doc and Lola didn't have.  Marie and Turk play out their youthful passions in the front room, while Doc and Lola stand in the shadows in the back.  This is probably an exact adaptation of the original play's stage directions.

The generational difference is very stark.  Doc and Lola both see Marie as a connection to their youthful years, but Doc harbors some hidden, dark attitudes towards women that must have been passed to him through his parents' generation.  When he succumbs to his desire to drink, finally, the full venom of his feelings emerges in the abuse he hurls at Lola.

Though this isn't as pessimistic and dark as Eugene O'Neill's ""Long Day's Journey into Night"" or Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman"", it is definitely an exploration of the underside of 1950's society.  Lola and Doc are exposed as empty and unfulfilled people, and prisoners of the manicured, well-kept 50's type neighborhood that soon became a fixture of TV sitcoms.  Despite the somewhat upbeat ending, and the hopeful theme of Alcoholics Anonymous and its twelve-step prescriptions, at the end of the movie it is hard to make believe that Doc and Lola's sufferings are over.

Like many of the ""people down the street"", the childless couples of the Fifties, their fate is to fade into the woodwork.

This film shows the Fifties as they were, without romanticism.  That is its ultimate value.",1383868800,,2695,4.825708061002179
2081551,3,B0002ERWXC,"Well, not quite-------for awhile you offer it hope and continue hoping that you will get past this EGREGIOUS mistake, but.....alas, you finally give up, and it is the greatest reason for which the movie falls apart.
Burt Lancaster was a handsome, almost beautiful man at the time this CURIOUS, engaging and ultimately disappointing film was released in 1952. He was 39, and perhaps the word ""stud"" was not insulting in the least. He exudes sheer masculinity, and a body that was muscular and virile.
Shirley Booth was 54 at the time, and although there was much talk about the difference in age, they still went ahead and filmed it. Indeed, she won the Oscar for her performance and perhaps, only relying on her acting here, and not her competition that year, which I am not aware of, she perhaps most certainly deserved it. Her acting is compelling.

The problem of 15 years of difference in age between a romantic, or married couple is not a problem at all, if:
It is known to us that it is indeed clearly stated in the story.
OR, as it has happened countless times the couple are totally convincing as close enough in age, no matter the difference so that there is little to doubt or ""disbelieve"" in the unfolding of the story.
The third logical excuse for it is, of course, prostitution in any of the myriad ways in which it has been presented again and again in the movies, when the difference in age is vast.
And then , of course, although rarely seen in film, but leaving aside cynicism, the reality in life that indeed two people of great difference in age do find love, in whatever manifestation to carry on a beautiful relationship.
But that is not the case in this film.
Both characters are, we are told, a pair that eloped perhaps decades ago for which we are to believe that they were two young adults, the female indeed never forgiven by her father to the present day, when they are perhaps, arguably in their forties or early fifties.
Congratulations to all those who are able to get past such a profound flaw in casting, and DO suspend disbelief and carry on.
That is not possible to one who is watching, studying the scenes closely enough, and trying for awhile to BELIEVE.
The reason for that hope is that both Lancaster and Booth give excellent performances that make it all the more disappointing to deal with this impasse.

Other flaws permeate in this movie, engrossing during perhaps the first hour (out of 2) and complex in the characterization of an alcoholic who has been sober for a year, and who clearly no longer?----loves his wife.
She herself is living in the past, as he cruelly tells her repeatedly when she remembers their early love, passion, and ultimately the reason for which Lancaster ""had"" to marry her, having made her pregnant and obliged to fulfill his ""duty"" (perhaps we should be better off a society if we go back to that?)

No chance. It appears to be assumed that he has apparently never loved her, in any romantic way, and has suffered for it all these years.
SHE has clearly lived in blindness when it comes to their relationship, whatever remains of it. He treats her more like a mother----and again we are even more reminded of the flaw already discussed.
At one point, you STOP caring. A young, supposedly wholesome college girl in need of a room is taken by Booths' character and this is the ""excuse"" for which everything seems to unravel.
She is suddenly seen to be a rather ""loose"" girl, and Lancaster's character finds himself unexpectedly confronting his LUST for her.
Naturally, an alcoholic who has just celebrated his first year of sobriety at A.A. is almost certainly to be a deeply fragile human being, and fighting his emotions he reaches for ""the bottle""--------LITERALLY........
We all know that the last thing you need to have at hand when you are fighting those hideous urges that paralyze you when maintaining your sobriety is, well, should we bother to mention?
Yes, indeed, having your poison within reach.
And then you fall into MELODRAMA, because the IDIOTIC idea of having a bottle of liquor in the cupboard a few paces away from you is not something that any serious person in recovery will do------not to mention your loving wife, who goes crazy when suddenly the bottle has disappeared and she realizes that he has broken his pathetic sobriety.
REALLY???.....
Well, no, we are not idiots here, and we presume that THEY, rather intelligent people, notwithstanding their terrible inner lives, would not be either.
That puts an end to the respect we have for the film.
The end itself is totally anti-climactic. They are both children holding onto each other, and we should assume that they will try again. These last scenes, even at the end reinforce the idea of a mother-son relationship. Again, there is nothing absurd about that, in and of itself, but to go back to the beginning of my review, what we cannot forgive is the fact that ""outside"" of the ""reality"" of the movie, we have the reality of the movie's construction, so to speak. And nobody is able to convince me that this matronly woman 15 years her husband's senior is for us to be fooled by unless indeed the story offers us the fact that there was INDEED a difference in age.
Wonderful performances, mediocre plot, and DETAILS of that plot that are unimaginable to accept within the ""internal"" logic of the movie.

2081562,5,B0002ERWXC,"This movie is among my all-time favorite dramas.  The raging tangle of lust, lost youth, and heart-broken dreams of what might have been lies seething just below the surface of a seemingly ordinary middle-aged couple.  Burt Lancaster trudges through his mundane life as ""Doc"", trapped by alcoholism, disappointment, and lost reputation, ready to boil forth in a venomous eruption.  Shirley Booth putters away aimlessly as Doc's frumpish housewife, reminiscing about bygone times when her coquettish youth held the prospect of suitors and popularity; but the years have been unkind to her looks; her naivete can no longer be seen as anything but pitiable and an irritant to Doc. She often speaks sadly about her lost puppy ""Little Sheba"" = a kind of reminder of what she had once hoped for. The pair are hopelessly snared in a marriage of convenience in an era when mores required couples to stay together in spite of total seeming incompatibility.  They had wed following an unwanted pregnancy only to have lost the child, with the result that ""Doc"" dropped out of medical school to support his married life.  Their daily banter belies the desperation inside them.
The sudden arrival of attractive young co-ed Terry Moore who rents a room from the pair provides both a jolt of reality and the surfacing of long-held resentments.  Doc is torn by demons of his own youthful mistakes and by feelings of propriety and jealousy when the girl is romanced aggressively by athlete Richard Jaekle.  Shirley Booth tries to relive some of her lost feelings by providing a fine dinner party for the co-ed and her fiance; she cooks and cleans and sets out the best china.
Doc explodes in an alcoholic rage and berates Booth while smashing up the dinner remnants.  He brutally pours out his vitriol on her and leaves.  Shirley calls various people for help including Doc's AA sponsor. She calls her parents and is rejected once again by her stoic unforgiving father in a tearful sad exchange.  Doc is taken to a hospital to dry out and returns home in a sheepish downcast mood, accompanied by his sponsor. Doc and his wife chatter quietly about nothing in an unspoken acknowledgement that things are ""back to normal"".
The movie ends as Booth relates a dream about her lost dog Little Sheba - the dream and the couple agree that Sheba (and symbolically their former youth and wishes) are now never to return.",1333497600,,2393,4.857493857493857

This movie has so many spiritual connations if you really look for them.  Burt Lancaster and Shirley Booth performed these characters in such a believable manner.  This is a movie you can watch and ""dare someone"" to touch the TV.  Her dream at the end was somewhat prophetic.  The one day at a time mindset of AA or any addiction related recovery programs come to life on this film.  In fact, I've thought about it being a tool for those who struggle.

Though times have changed, the need to be loved and to be needed are still present in each of us. The end of the movie I think is the best part because Lola (Shirley Booth) and her husband (Burt Lancaster) appear to come to terms (acceptance) with the issues of the past which had been haunting them both and hindering their love for each other. We all need a fresh start and the end of this movie seems to portray that this is where this couple is headed after Burt Lancaster is released from the hospital (he had been recovering from alcoholism).

But as for the role of Doc, I believe someone else would have made this a better movie because I felt that Burt Lancaster was playing Burt Lancaster playing Doc. Opening up the film made the story and running time longer, and my attention sometimes flagged. Overall, though, it is a very good drama about people being co-dependent in a marriage going nowhere. See it as a period piece from the 1950s that still enjoys stage productions.

2081574,3,B0002ERWXC,"This dated but interesting film is another of the stage/TV to screen black-and-white melodramas that flew onto the screen in the 1950s in the wake of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"".  A great stage success for Shirley Booth, who won a Tony award for her efforts, this film is a rather uncinematic representation of the stage play with little opening-up or deviation from the original work.  That's okay.  William Inge's quirky characters and less-than-mainstream situations (for the time) draw and sustain interest.  Burt Lancaster's broodiness as the alcoholic husband has rarely been captured so effectively, and his gentle qualities as an actor were never more fully realized.  Terry Moore is actually quite right as the college girl and, if her acting is at times too superficial, she nevertheless presents a girlish innocence that leavens the heaviness of the film.  Richard Jaeckal is perfect as the burly athlete who scoffs at Lancaster and Booth but has other more nefarious things in mind for Moore.  This leaves Booth, who's character is unquestionably the centerpoint of the film.  She won an Oscar for this performance, but it simply doesn't hold up today.  Granted, Inge created a one-note character here and one waits for the big scene where Booth explodes with her own rage over life's trajectory, but it never comes.  Instead, she remains a simple, over-accomodating mass of neediness who desperately clings...to everyone, everywhere, at any time.  To make matters worse,  Booth's choices as an actress help make her character the most masochistic screen presence since Scarlett O'Hara, with none of the charismatic provocativity.  Booth is an annoying dolt from start to finish and her character generates no interest or empathy.

That anyone dared to present such surly or lost characters at the time was hardly a commercial strategy.  It certainly would have been far off the beaten path of 1950s cinema tradition (with hindsight, it's now a quintessential tradition of that era).  ""Sheba..."" remains a quirky, unexpected drama, but the eye of this storm is stillborn.",1248220800,,2082,5.207207207207207

Shirley Booth got her best actress Oscar for this role and my favorite scene is when she is reclined on the sofa jiving to ""Fifteen Minutes of Taboo,"" on the radio.  Lola loves music, rhythm and dancing.  Let us not downplay Burt's acting however.  He is dead-on as the quiet, refined, gentleman that turns into a raving maniac when on a bender.  When Doc and Lola are patching up the shambles of his latest episode, there seems to be an epithany for Lola when she realizes her little dog Sheba is never coming back.  It seems that she may be able to let go of the past into which she escapes daily from her real life.  As a recovering alcoholic myself (See my review of Lost Weekend)I appreciate the parts of the movie that deal with AA and the spirit of recovery.

2081585,4,B0002ERWXC,"Come Back, Little Sheba stands as a fine work of art by director Daniel Mann. The story takes place in the Delaney household. The Delaneys suffer relatively silently from the deep pain and despair that they feel over Mr. Delaney, or ""Doc,"" as his wife Lola calls him, never finishing medical school and Lola Delaney not being the ""model"" housewife they both wish she were. Burt Lancaster turns in a tremendous performance as ""Doc"" Delaney, the bitter medical school dropout who blames his wife for his personal failings which include alcoholism and an extremely callous personality. Moreover, there's no secret why Shirley Booth won her Oscar for Best Actress of 1952 for her role as Lola Delaney. Her performance commands your attention as she masterfully portrays the character of Lola Delaney struggling with her own issues while trying to keep their marriage as stable as possible.

Unfortunately for the Delaneys, their fragile world is turned upside down when they rent a room to young college student Marie Buckholder, who stirs feelings of true passion in Mr. Delaney and motherly feelings in Lola Delaney. Eventually the Delaneys must confront their true yet previously unacknowledged feelings not just within themselves but also to each other. They try to deal with the pain of their rather serious issues resulting in their lives not working out the way they hoped it would. Lola Delaney has the extra burden of having to accept the loss of their dog Sheba; Lola had been very attached to Sheba who represented for her the child she never had. In addition, all this takes place as Marie, the young boarder for whom ""Doc"" develops feelings, enjoys her youth as she flirts with a muscle boy and studies at a nearby university.

Will Marie and ""Doc"" Delaney ever share romantic time together? Will the Delaneys deal successfully with their problems? Can ""Doc"" Delaney stay away from drink when the going gets rough as he realizes that Marie cannot really replace his dowdy and aging wife Lola? What might happen if he did revert to drinking again? Will Sheba be found and returned to Lola Delaney? No spoilers here, folks; you'll have to watch the movie to find out!

Burt Lancaster and Shirley Booth portray Doc Delaney and Lola Delaney with a great deal of sensitivity; they throw themselves into their acting roles do deeply that you will be convinced by their acting every step of the way through the picture. Burt Lancaster's acting in particular leaves you on the edge of your seat at all the right moments during this film. Moreover, Terry Moore positively shines as the young Marie Buckholder who makes ""Doc"" Delaney (or, Mr. Delaney) experience romantic passion for the first time in many years.

The choreography exceeds my expectations with many characters moving about the screen in several scenes, all of them doing what they were directed to do so well at all times. The cinematography reflects good judgment; the camera gets moved about very deftly by Daniel Mann and his crew to portray the exact image and conjure up the precise emotions they want their audience to experience at all times.

Unfortunately, the DVD comes without any extras. The most you get is a scene selection feature which of course is standard on just about all commercially released DVDs of today. The movie stands so strong, however, that is disappointment is comparatively minor and I will only take off one star for this problem to make this a four star DVD review.

I highly recommend this film for classic movie buffs and people who enjoy superlative dramatic performances.",1177459200,,3575,4.920398009950249
2081586,5,B0002ERWXC,"This is a powerful drama.  Lancaster plays a sort of Jeckyll and Hyde character named ""Doc"":  calm and refined when sober, angry and dangerous when drunk.  The scene in which, drunk, he attacks his wife, Lola, is harrowing.  I've seen few scenes to beat it in terms of intensity and believability.  Doc buries his disappointments in drink and harbors a deep suspicion of women's sexuality.  Indeed, he is obsessed with female purity; thus the fact that Lola was pregnant before their marriage weighs heavily on him, and Doc, like Lola's father, never forgives her for this sexual ""mistake.""  Booth, as Lola, is heartbreakingly poignant.  The dominant symbol in the film, Lola's lost dog, Sheba, represents Lola's lost self:  her youth and her dreams.  Because she has no where to go when Doc becomes ""sick"" again, she is forced to resign herself to being a housewife who whitewashes her problems just like she gives her wooden ice box a fresh coat of paint.

""You're all I have,"" Lola says to Doc at the end of the film.  ""You're all I ever had.""  Booth's genius in that scene is most evident.  I once read that Inge, the author of the play on which this film is based, was an alcoholic himself and believed that each woman should always stand by her man.  But one look at Booth's performance makes it clear that Booth didn't think so.  Booth's Lola is desolate at the end of this film.  Her mother and father won't take her in and her neighbor's only advice is ""keep busy.""  This, Lola will do, as she must, as she has no choice, but at a high cost.

I always found Burt Lancaster to be a very mannered actor, and, while he doesn't hurt the film by any means, he makes me wonder what the film would have been with someone like Ralph Bellamy in the role of Doc. I understand the need for box office draw and that is an unfortunate situation in film even to this day. Shirley Booth is so good that she elevates Lancaster. Terry Moore and Richard Jaeckel lend excellent support as does everyone else in the film. This is a heartwrenching drama of sweetness and sorrow not to be missed.",1146441600,,851,4.568627450980392
2081588,4,B0002ERWXC,"The film version of William Inge's COME BACK, LITTLE SHEBA was released the year of my birth (1952)--and yes, that really was another era.  The Hayes code was still in effect, and even married couples had to sleep in twin beds.  For all that, however, a certain frankness was creeping into the American cinema.  Alcoholism, as a theme, had been already addressed successfully in LOST WEEKEND some seven years prior.  And themes of pre-marital sex and illegitimacy were at least occasionally addressed (think of Greer Garson's classic 1941 film BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST) or at least hinted at.

By today's standards, COME BACK, LITTLE SHEBA is not especially bold.  Those familiar with the stage version might also cite it as an example of the kinds of coy compromises Hollywood had to make in order to get ""serious drama"" onto film at all.  (The comparison to the stage play serves as proof positive  that ""mature drama"" onscreen was still relatively ""immature"" in comparison to the stage or to literature.  Frumpy housewife Lola Delaney (Academy Award winner Shirley Booth) was allowed to gaze a little more longingly at muscular young men in the stage version, without it necessarily marking her as the slut her husband cruelly accuses her of being in a drunken rage.

In the film version, she looks on wistfully as her young boarder Marie (Terry Moore) and her athlete boyfriend (Richard Jaeckel) flirt and kiss.  It is, at worst, a reminder of her own lost youth.  (Well, actually, Lola's reaction during the ""life drawing"" scene suggests more than a maternal interest, but the play is quite a bit more open about her flirtatious nature.)

It's hard to say though if the film would have been much better if it had been more faithful to the stage play.  As others have pointed out, enough of the original dialog and storyline is included to still make quite a powerful statement. And it IS true that most changes are relatively minor. (The screenwriters in fact wisely, after including the postman interchange, dropped a similar one with the milkman).  Perhaps the only baffling alteration is the filmmakers' decision to make Marie only a very new tenent in the Delaney household.  The play has her already established as a de facto part of the family and makes Doc Delaney's obviously complex feelings toward his young boarder (paternal protectiveness compounded with a certain erotic longing) ring all the more true.

In fact, when in the movie, the Delaney's receive a letter from the now-married Marie stating how she appreciated Doc's concern about the caddish young athlete who might have won her favor, one has to wonder when, exactly, did he ever have the chance to make those sentiments known.

Stage plays have always been one of the most difficult source materials for filmmakers to adapt.  (How do you ""open up"" the thing and get it out of those damn four walls?).  In the 50s, the process was even more complicated due to the stringent codes on the film industry.  COME BACK LITTLE SHEBA was a remarkable achievement for 1952, both in terms of its relative candor and the fact that it doesn't seem overly ""stagey.""  Add to that Shirley Booth's performance (as well as the rest of the remarkable cast, including the often underrated performance of Burt Lancaster) and you've got a period classic.  That may not be the same as a cinematic masterpiece, but they came as close as the times would permit them.",1139097600,,3416,4.8517241379310345
2081589,4,B0002ERWXC,"Very fine adaptation of the William Inge play with Shirley Booth in an Oscar winning performance as a middle-aged, childless woman, whose husband, (Burt Lancaster), is about to hop off the alcoholic's wagon. Unlike two other Hollywood filmings of Inge plays; ""Picnin"", and ""Bus Stop"", ""Come Back Little Sheba"", finds little reason to expand its horizons for film's sake, and sticks close to the drawing board, concentrating on the subtle, brewing drama that finally erupts in an angry alcoholic's rage. Lancaster's transition from devoted Alcoholics Anonymous member to raving lunatic is superb, and the two young supporting players, Terry Moore and Richard Jaeckel, are surprsingly deft and accomplished as teens in love, in contrast to the passive and hardened relationship of the middle-agers. Shirley Booth delivers a dazzling, emotionally engulfing portrait of a woman clutching love, her borderline manic character is genuinely empathetic. The only problem, and one that occurs to me every time I read the play, is the suggestion that a kitchen knife holds the answer to the fate of the missing dog, Sheba. I don't think it was the playwright's intention to envision Burt Lancaster carving up the cute little poodle, but every time he picks up that knife and lunges at his wife, I expect to find little poodle chops in the freezer.",1132272000,,1337,5.1658986175115205

It is a unbelievably moving performance, sympathetic, depressing, heart-breaking, incredible!  I have watched this film numerous times and I am moved each time.

2081592,5,B0002ERWXC,"Shirley carries this film, wonderfully! Lancaster, a great actor, was so sorely miscast, it was hard to imagine. Ms. Booth had done the role over 100 times on stage, and it's no surprise she won the Oscar in 1952, probably the worst year in Oscar history. That same year, Shirley was up against Julie Harris, who had also done ""The Member of the Wedding"" on stage and won awards. Ms. Harris has had as spotty a career on film, as did Ms. Booth. Interesting. The magnificent play of William Inge can only be another feather in his cap. His very personal plays have been presented on screen so well; most especially in ""The Dark at the Top of the Stairs"". When will that be available on DVD?Yes, 1952 was a huge Oscar mistake; Booth deserved her Oscar, Gary Cooper deserved it (for ""High Noon""), but ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" as Best Picture? Over ""The Quiet Man""? WRONG!",1103587200,,872,4.525316455696203
2081593,5,B0002ERWXC,"This is my favorite Inge play, and for many years has been one of my favorite plays altogether.  Shirley Booth was flawless perfection itself in her part, Lancaster was (as everyone has pointed out) too young for the part, but did an adequate job anyway.  The movie is almost unbearably sad, and I cried several times.  A reviewer of the original Bway production said something to the effect that in the second act, the author took his coat off.  Some of that impact was missing in the movie, Turk did not take his shirt off, and Doc's accusations of lust against Lola were diminished in the movie (as I remember the play).  I did however recognize some of my favorite lines from the original which made me glad.  It's been a while since I read the play, it might have benefited from having been shortened to the hour and 40 minutes the movie lasted.  I recently read Picnic and thought I would die of boredom, it made me angry, I've never read such aimless trivia.  I love this movie.",1095552000,,985,4.4636871508379885
2081594,5,B0002ERWXC,"Shirley Booth and Burt Lancaster are bound together by a mutual tragedy in a sad, childless marriage made worse by Lancaster's alcoholism. When they rent a room to a sexy college student (Terry Moore), everything begins to really unravel. Based on the William Inge play (which also starred Booth and won her a Tony), the film is downbeat but hypnotic thanks to the stars. Booth also won Best Actress for the film with her heartbreaking performance as the dowdy housewife struggling to cope with her husband's problems. The film depicts a somber intervention by AA for Lancaster's character and Booth calling for Sheba (their pet dog that was Booth's child substitute that has run away) as well as some other harrowing scenes that mark this film as serious drama. Booth later became part of TV history in the 60's as ""Hazel"" but it's her few ventures in films like this that need to be remembered too. She was no beauty but an exceptionally gifted actress who could tear your heart out with performances like the one in ""Come Back Little Sheba"". Lancaster is excellent as the husband who tries to love his unkempt wife but can't face the real issues.

2081596,5,B0002ERWXC,"Shirley Booth is memorable in the role of dowdy wife to alcoholic husband Burt Lancaster (equally as good).  The film is an adaptation of the William Inge play and it stands as one of the best transfers from stage to screen.  Contrary to other reviewers' opinions, Terry Moore and Richard Jaeckel are great in their supporting roles.
For those of us old and fortunate enough to remember Booth from her 60's role as TV's ""Hazel,"" this film shows that the actress was much better than the role of domestic of which she is famous.  It also shows the range of her skills.",1004140800,,567,4.53921568627451
2081597,4,B0002ERWXC,"In a magnificent showcase for her considerable acting talent, Booth is at once vulgar and heartbreaking as slovenly Lola. Booth plays Lola so realisticly that one could call her performance a lesson in screen acting; she's like a subtle 50's version of Marie Dressler. In the demanding role of Doc, 39 year old Lancaster does an admirable job doing his best, but he is betrayed by his youth and it's obvious Booth is quite a bit older than he (In an interesting revelation revealed after Booth died, it was found that the actress actually took a full nine years off her true age (which was an a major feat of acting to pull off in itself!) making her about 54 when she made this movie!) Shirley usually gave 1907 as her birthyear, but it was revealed that she was indeed born in 1898. The supporting players are merely adequate and it's solely Booth's Oscar-winning performance which stays in the memory. Fans of TV's HAZEL should take a look just to realise what a talented and versatile actress Shirley Booth really was!",958435200,,1022,4.651933701657459

While  other films of it's day, where generally light hearted and entertaining,  ""Come back little Sheba"" must have been a real surprise for movie  patrons in 1952. Even though this drama has been played out every night in  practically all our homes across America with out camera or script for  centuries, it still isn't easily recognized, and must have been a real  shocker for many.

The couple takes in a pretty young co-ed from the local university, whose relationship with a narcissistic athlete ""bothers"" Doc more than it ought.  A classic study of emotional deprivation and displaced anger, the play and movie anticipate such other Inge favorites as BUS STOP and PICNIC.

8027266,5,B0002ERWXC,"COME BACK, LITTLE SHEBA is a black and white film from 1952, starring Burt Lancaster (1913-1994), Shirley Booth (1989-1992), and Terry Moore (born 1929).  Burt Lancaster is a household word and an A-list God-of-Hollywood, and there is no need to say anything more about him, except for the fact that I absolutely adore three of his movies: (1) THE YOUNG SAVAGES; (2) RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP; and (3) THE TRAIN.  I have watched each of these movies on at least ten occasions, and there is no sign that I'll stop watching them over and over.  Shirley Booth is most known for her role in the Hazel sitcom, which ran from 1961 to 1966.  Terry Moore has been in at least 50 movies, and I suppose I shall explore more of her oevre later on.

NO DOWN PAYMENT.  Come Back, Little Sheba bears some striking similarities to No Down Payment.  My reason for mentioning No Down Payment, a black and white film from 1957, is to avoid revealing too much of the plot of Come Back, Little Sheba.  The entire plot of Come Back, Little Sheba can be described in one paragraph, and so instead of detailing this movie, I will describe it indirectly by referring to similarities with No Down Payment, and leave it up to you to read between the lines.  Anyway, No Down Payment stars Tony Randall (drunk used car salesman), Cameron Mitchell (auto mechanic who longs for the past when he was a WWII war hero), Jeffrey Hunter (colleged educated electrical engineer), and Pat Hingle (furniture store owner, and the man with the most career-stability of these men).  Come Back, Little Sheba has a very small ensemble cast, consisting mainly of a husband (Lancaster) and wife (Booth), their boarder (Terry Moore, a college student), and one of Terry Moore's boyfriends, an athlete from the college who has a healthy urge to engage in intimate congress with Terry Moore's character.  Terry Moore's character rents a room in Lancaster's house, and that's where she does her homework.

In contrast, No Down Payment has an ensemble cast that is twice as large, in that it takes the form of the four husbands plus the four respective wives.  For both movies, most of the scenes take place at home.  For both movies, the plot begins in a standard domestic plot that could have been from an episode of I Love Lucy.  And for both movies, as the minutes zip along, one gets the sense that something is not quite right.  There are parallels between both movies in what is not right.  For Come Back, Little Sheba, Burt Lancaster's character is a recovering alcoholic, but who keeps a bottle of whiskey stashed in the kitchen cabinet for guests.  And in No Down Payment, Tony Randall's character is a confirmed alcoholic who drinks hard liquor even in the daytime, and enjoys proclaiming that it is only ""medicinal.""  Another parallel, is that in Come Back, Little Sheba, Shirley Booth's character has a periodic and almost pathologic relationship with her dog (Little Sheba) who had disappeared years earlier, and who imagines that stray dogs in her neighborhood are Little Sheba, and who tells about dreams from the previous night about Little Sheba being found dead in the middle of an athletic field.  And the corresponding pathology in No Down Payment is Cameron Mitchell's character, who is hung up about the fact that he is a war hero (he keeps a little museum of his war medals in his garage) but has been passed by in a quest for more respectable employment because he has no college training.

Okay, so following the initial minutes of ordinary domestic chit-chat, the introduction of pathological aspects of the characters (alcoholism and yearning for the past), what happens next is that the skeletons start coming out of the closet.  In fact, THE SKELETON THAT COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET BELONGING TO LANCASTER AND BOOTH IS EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF SKELETON THAT COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET BELONGING TO CAMERON HUNTER AND HIS WIFE (played by Joanne Woodward).  And as if that were not enough, there is yet another parallel between both movies.  This additional parallel is that something really awful happens.  But here I will stop and will not disclose what was the really awful thing.  FIVE STARS to Come Back, Little Sheba.  Also, FIVE STARS to No Down Payment.

There is also a parallel with CITIZEN KANE a film by Orson Welles.  In Citizen Kane, the main character mumbles ""Rosebud.""  In Come Back, Little Sheba, the main character mumbles, ""Lola.""  For both movies, this mumbling is for the same reason.  The mumbled word reveals what is most important to that character, from an emotional point of view.  Any person familiar with Citizen Kane and watching the ""Lola"" mumbling scene will be pleasantly surprised.",1501632000,,4681,4.775155279503106
