8090752,1,B000BPL2K6,This is one of the great anime collection. But why would one pay $70 when you can get the same anime on here for from $7.70-$15.45???,1409529600,,133,4.153846153846154
8090753,5,B000BPL2K6,"I'm an avid anime fan and this is hands down the best fight scene/showdown anime I've ever seen.  If you like Bleach, Inuyasha, or any other sword clashing anime, peep this.  This is the story of the Mutsu clan of warriors who are considered a myth.  They fight with no weapons and must fight if challenged just because of their bloodline and honor to prove that Mutsu is the most powerful kung fu in the land.  The suspense of the fight scenes is almost unbearable it's paced so well.  And the animation is great.  I wouldn't say it's the best I've seen but it gets the job done.  I rewatched this right after I finished it.  To other anime fans looking for your next series to check.  You have found it.",1216166400,4,705,4.320610687022901
8090754,5,B000BPL2K6,"I've become an anime enthusiast no more than five months ago. Here is a list of what I've seen: Ninja Scroll (series and movie); Samurai Champloo; Mononoke - Spirited Away - Howl's Moving Castle; the entire Kenshin Himura series, OVA and Movie; and Shura no Toki.  I also watched the old Samurai series about Musashi Miyamoto. I have to say that Shura no Toki is in the same league as all the above mentioned except the three Miyazaki movies.

The story revolves around generations of fighters who practice the ""mutsu-emmei"" style. These fighters go at it bare handed without any weapons except for their bodies and still manage to kick serious butt. The story, besides having nice character development, great actions sequences and even love stories, manages to deliver the plot with great historical references and settings. I would say that if you liked Samurai Champloo and the Kenshin series, you will definitely enjoy Shura no Toki.",1153526400,10,938,4.968152866242038
8090755,5,B000BPL2K6,"This is by far one of the best anime's I've ever seen. Between the characteres that are in it and the over all fighting...holy crap. Just seeing Miamota and Jubei Yagyu in combat makes it worth it by itself. But all the others added in make it perfect. Kempo, kendo, dragonfly and other styles. This anime is more than worth the price...well in my opinion.",1138233600,8,356,4.492307692307692
