Beautiful  storyline!",1479081600,,88,6.333333333333333
8705943,5,B00UGPW23M,"This is a wonderful story of love between a man and his wife, their love for God, and brotherly love for the unlovable. There are subtitles in English, so don't concern yourself that the spoken word is Hebrew. The acting is superb and you can easily follow what is happening without reading the subtitles.",1478908800,3,305,4.666666666666667
