It would be okay except for the soundtrack, which causes me to have to skip from 14 minutes in until 25 minutes in, because the girl singer is SHRIEKING as if she's being tortured.  If I just muted it, I couldn't hear the instructors' instructions.  I wouldn't buy it again.",1436140800,,322,4.440677966101695
