4171074,4,B003QP4DRC,"I really enjoyed season 4 of Ice Road Truckers. It has some exciting scenes in it just like the other seasons. I would recommend this season but not season 1. It has repeated scenes in it and I just didn't enjoy it, maybe because it was the first season.",1348704000,,254,4.204081632653061
4171075,5,B003QP4DRC,I got this for my husband for a present and he loves it! I has all of the behind the scenes and all kinds of extras.  He loves it and so do I!,1324944000,,142,3.303030303030303
4171076,5,B003QP4DRC,"In Season 4 of Ice Road Truckers the true character of each driver shows through more than any other season.
Alex- shows true compassion and puts helping others in front of his dash for the cash.
Hugh- barrels through, load count means everything at the expense of becoming a careless driver.
Jack Jesse-- steady as can be.  Safe and sure driver. Willing to teach/advise drivers who have less experience.
Lisa- trying to drive in an occupation dominated by men. What stands out? Her determination.  New experiences for her in this season  and she did well.
Ray - the rookie driver this year. His goal? To work hard and steady to support his family - Goal achieved.
Last of all Greg-  Immature Chauvinist. Plays games with other truckers on a dangerous road, then pouts like a small child. Grow up!",1322265600,,797,4.712230215827338

4171079,5,B003QP4DRC,I tried to watch Deadliest Roads or whatever the program was with Lisa Kelly and Rick Yemm but I just couldn't.  I hope that Rick enjoys existing on the other side of the world and I can't wait to see Lisa on Season 5!,1304467200,,218,3.9545454545454546

4171115,3,B003QP4DRC,"I think the only way to buy Ice Road Truckers in on Blu-ray... since the resolution at 1080p is so beautiful and strreaming video just can't hold a candle to it in terms of quality.

3RD season is highly contrived... you can tell they make lots out of any incident or problem that Carlisle Trucking will allow them show film about.
However as far as BS goes, it is soooooooooooo entertaining BS that's worth a watching.

At $5 shipped, how could you go wrong?  I forget how many hours of viewing is on the set but it's a lot.
The scenery is stunningly beautiful and y'know... there is just something really appealing about this kind of jive!

If you want accuracy, don't look to Ice Road Truckers.  It's too much like watching the old WWF fights.
But for sheer all-around entertainment value, I don't see how you can do better!",1382659200,,827,4.486666666666666

4171119,3,B003QP4DRC,"The producer is also the narrator. He is totally redundant repeating all these disasters that could but never happen. The computer graphics are amateurism and the phoney screams of driver, supposedly plunging off cliffs or sinking into the depths of a frozen sea are quite annoying.",1376956800,,282,5.1521739130434785
4171120,5,B003QP4DRC,"Loved it, shows how great the competition between the truckers can be and just how dangerous the job of hauling valuable and much needed supplies to remote areas on this planet.",1375574400,,177,4.741935483870968

4171122,3,B003QP4DRC,"The show is extremely well done.  It's exciting at first, but does get a bit monotonous after a full season's worth of episodes.  Still, I recommend it.",1369440000,,152,4.592592592592593
4171123,4,B003QP4DRC,"Good show to watch.  Sometimes too much made-up drama.  It was great at the beginning, but it seems like some of the situations are now enhanced for tv.",1366156800,,152,4.392857142857143
