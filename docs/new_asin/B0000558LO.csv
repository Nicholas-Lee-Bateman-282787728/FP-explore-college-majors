What a fun day it was!! For the person who wants this on DVD, if you can, get a VCR/DVD dubbing recorder. They still make them, but might be hard to find. I already have one and it works great!",1381276800,,352,3.9027777777777777
8185382,5,B0000558LO,I order these tapes for my dad who will be 90 years old in August.  He and I enjoy our time together watching all these oldies.,1374710400,,127,3.8846153846153846
8185383,3,B0000558LO,"I enjoyed watching the missing songs from the dvd ""doo wop at 50"". The Platters, Johnny Maestro and The Marcels were great.
Why the songs were not added to the original dvd to make the concert ""complete"" is a mystery because they obviously had room
for it.
Also one slight problem.
The video box says the tape is 70 minutes. Not true.
It's only 43 minutes in length.",1017187200,3,366,4.397058823529412
8185384,3,B0000558LO,"I'm glad I didn't listen to the reviewer who said not to buy this. If you watch the original concert closely you can tell that it was edited and that there are missing songs. This tape completes the concert, and not only are the missing songs here, but the backstage performances that were aired but not included are also on this tape. Ironically, two of my favorite songs, ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"", by the Platters and ""Whispering Bells"" by the Del-Vikings were ommited from the original version. I am happy to have them now on this tape. My verdict; if you loved the original concert, you must buy this also. Think of it as filling the gaps and restoring the outakes, if you will. My only regret is that it is currently only available on VHS. I want my DVD!!! Gary Stewart at Rhino Records, are you listening!!!  You made a lot of my Doo-Wop dreams come true. I hope you make this one come true also. I am looking forward to ""More Doo Wop 51"" on DVD also!",999302400,16,958,4.322222222222222
