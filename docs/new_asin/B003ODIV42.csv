8497550,5,B003ODIV42,"Empyreal Doctor is the first film I saw directed by Zhu Zhaowei.  It is different than his martial arts and opera movies I have seen since then, but Empyreal Doctor is probably the reason Zhu became my favorite Chinese director.  It is a human interest story, and he was able to draw out emotions from his actors.  You are going to cry when you watch it.  Empyreal Doctor is about an older doctor who uses traditional medicine as well as modern medicine.  It is also about social justice.  He is dedicated to curing his patients, even the ones who cannot pay high fees.  He mentors young physicians to think about curing their patients rather than becoming rich.  The film does have a touch of government economic propaganda, but Zhu brings out his actors strong portrayal showing a doctor loved by all.  I recommend this film to adult Americans as a glimpse of Chinese culture we don't normally see.",1496966400,,900,4.6455696202531644
