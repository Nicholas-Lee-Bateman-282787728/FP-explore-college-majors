8276376,4,B001A8A646,"When browsing for a copy of Flatliners, I came across this double feature for roughly the same price.  I was very pleased with the price since the Hollow Man movie was basically thrown in for free. The movies are on separate discs which I prefer to the two sided ones.

I have seen Flatliners several times when it was newer, but probably not for at least a decade until I bought it.  I enjoyed Flatliners when I watched it this time and it was in no way a disappointment compared to what I had remembered.  Upon watching it I found that while I recalled the basic concept and certain scenes were familiar, I had forgotten so much about the plot that it was almost like seeing an entirely new film.  I find it to be very visually interesting and creepy but not quite scary.

Hollow Man was a movie I recalled as either being not very good or that I had never fully watched.  It has some very good CGI, but I find it to be flat.  I probably didn't pay much attention to it when it was new and I couldn't get too interested in it this time either.",1331942400,2,1045,4.19
