8149131,4,B000J3FBSE,"I watched death of Poe its a very cool dream like visual concept. Your in it with Poe trying to grasp sanity. It doesn't give a final ""He died of"" instead it shows the struggle the days leading to the death. His grief, his inability to considerate. His ultimate collapse and the theory of how he was found in the street with some one else s cloths on. Mark Redfield draws you in , you have met Poe. I liked it. I love historical fare and psychological tugs of war. In death of Poe you are tossed back and forth between his reality , his hallucinations and his memories. I very much liked this movie.",1382054400,,599,4.217391304347826
8149132,4,B000J3FBSE,"Mark Redfield is well suited for the part of the poet to which he bears resemblance. The first two-thirds of this film is not only believable, but probable. The last third is simply slow and tiresome. Certainly, as most true artists seem to experience, E A Poe struggled with his inner demons and his outer lack of appreciation. His fight to remain in this world, while his Consciousness struggles with Other Worlds, is aptly portrayed by the writers and by the extraordinary Mark Redfield quite amazingly in the first portion of this film. I'd purchase this, again, for the revelations that this segment of the production revealed. ""Eddie"" lives on...Forevermore.",1360368000,2,664,5.045454545454546
8149133,3,B000J3FBSE,"First off.....Mark Redfield is very good in this.
He has the right sense of frustration and loneliness that plagued Poe at the end,and effectively portrays a neurotic.
He even resembles Poe to a large degree.

However like most films the actor is in,he is not supported by that able of a supporting cast.
The acting ranges from mediocre to downright terrible.

Many scenes have an embarrasing quality to them,particularly his climatic run in with men from his past....
The digital production also becomes very distracting at points,and takes away from alot of the drama.

The film contains numerous special features including a typical ""pat on the back"" commentary track,a one minute documentary(!) on Baltimore,Redfield reading some Poe and two silent films.
Alpha offers two decent prints of The Avenging Conscience(1914) and The Raven(1915),which are one of the best selling points for this DVD set.

Nothing extraordinary here,but decent for the Poe fan,at least to witness Redfield's perf as the tormented writer,and to see the silent adaptions of the author's work(even though,'The Raven"" is actually about Poe's OWN life).
An interesting DVD release,nothing more.",1226448000,2,1170,5.377049180327869
8149134,4,B000J3FBSE,"The extras provided on THE DEATH OF POE (from ALPHA NEW CINEMA) outshine this 2006 ""concept"" documentary.

On disc #1, Mark Redfield (an excellent EAP lookalike) doesn't so much explore events surrounding the famous author's demise as attempt to represent visually the dementia and any thoughts that may have been going through his mind during those last days. It's a daring concept that grabs the viewer's attention at first, but ultimately this contrivance and some major assumptions simply don't hold up well.

Disc #2 fares better. D.W. Griffith's ""The Avenging Conscious"" and ""The Raven"" were both created over 90 years ago. Each has something to recommend it. ""Avenging Conscience"" is based on the poem ""Annabel Lee."" ""The Raven"" includes an optional commentary track. An added feature is the audio disc of Poe writings, as delivered by the creator of ""The Death of Poe.""

8149135,4,B000J3FBSE,"This is a fascinating dramatization of Edgar Allan Poe's final days in Baltimore, which culminated in his mysterious, possibly violent death.  No one knows what actually killed Poe and, although he lingered in hospital for several days, he was never able to tell what had happened to him.  Mark Redfield gives the first realistic, flesh and blood filmed interpretation of Poe and it is a mesmerizing performance.  The film itself, also directed by Redfield, is very cleverly written and edited, mixing the mostly black and white footage with key flashbacks in color.  Redfield is well-supported by Kevin G. Shinnick, Tony Tsendeas and Jennifer Rouse (who also composed the film's musical score).

This is another example of low-budget, independently-produced films by talented artists that deliver thoughtful and entertaining material.

We may never know what killed Poe, but this film offers a compelling look at what his final, unhappy days may have been like.",1170115200,11,962,5.296052631578948
