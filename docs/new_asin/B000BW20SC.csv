8093431,2,B000BW20SC,"I was disappointed with this video. At the beginning it jumped around on the Jesus time line and was a bit confusing as to where the movie was going.  The actor that played Jesus was not the right type and his voice was so American.  The whipping that Jesus got at the pillar did very little skin damage, not that I wanted lots of blood, but it didn't show any.  The scaring was extremely long and not like the pattern of the shroud of Turin at all where there was evidence of barbs on the whip.  When Jesus was hanging on the cross, no blood from the thorns and no cuts on his chest. It quickly jumps to the final breath of Jesus,  The actor is looking up, still looking fresh, and says ""It is finished"" and  his head goes limp.  It goes into resurrection mode and a visit to the spirit world.  It was not clear that's where He was since everyone was dressed in white.  The music is dominant throughout the video.  If you've seen Passion of the Christ you should get a full idea of what Christ went through.  Don't waste you time with this one.  Disappointing, it would have been so easy to have a better production with just a few changes.",1490140800,,1141,4.231481481481482

8093435,5,B000BW20SC,"I have watched this dvd many times and each time I am affected by the extreme cruelty Jesus Christ suffered on His last days. The film is beautifully choreographed with the Israeli country side and Jerusalem street scenes, contrasting the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and Sadducees with the innocence and glory of the Savior.  It begins with a guard waking up Pilate for this trouble maker the Jews have brought to the Roman court. The film then flashes back to the birth of Jesus then to the Garden of Gethsemanee where the film shows in dark shapes and shadow, through music and sound the agony He suffered as He took upon himself the sins of the world. Then the treachery of Judas, and the mocking, spitting, slapping interview of Jesus Christ by the Jewish council. Soon the flash back catches up with the real time of the movie.  The film suggests the unbelievable cruelty with suggestions as a rope is pulled taut and a man groans. The flogger with whips studded with nails pulls back and lets the whips fly on the back of the Savior. We do not see it but hear the crack across the skin and the startle of stabled horses. I have cried out unable to sit quietly.  The crucifixion is more hideous with heavy nails and hammer thrown down, a hand forced on the cross as a soldier raises the hammer and pounds the nail into the hand.  The mournful music intensifies the darkest hour.  Then the film shows the resurrection and with scenes of beauty, we see the Savior resurrected, the Lamb of God.  This is an excellent movie for all to ponder and learn more of this time.",1296864000,3,1570,4.491228070175438
