6398273,4,B00K19E6XW,"This movie was pretty cute and good for a few light-hearted laughs.  For parents' information, there is a bar scene and a couple of risque comments, but otherwise this is a pretty clean movie.",1407888000,2,192,4.647058823529412

6398275,5,B00K19E6XW,"There was nothing about this little gem of a movie that I didn't like : ) .  I ordered the DVD to watch with my pre-teen daughter, hoping for a sweet, fun ""chick flick"" we could both enjoy and it did not disappoint.  It is one of the best we've seen in a long time and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  A great addition to our movie collection!",1406678400,5,342,4.0
6398276,5,B00K19E6XW,"Got this movie on time. And it plays perfectly, all the way threw. Really good movie. Satisfied with my purchase.",1406592000,,113,4.7
6398277,3,B00K19E6XW,"A pretty good family friendly movie. The actors are good in their respective roles. The lead actors were well cast and the young actor playing the daughter of the male love interest is outstanding.

Some children might find the movie a little boring as almost the entire film is focused on the adults lives and the adult relationships.",1405814400,4,335,4.775862068965517
6398278,4,B00K19E6XW,"Starting slow and picking up with light comedy, lots of touching moments and characters worth caring about, this romantic comedy peacefully rolls on to a satisfactory, although, of course, predictable climax.

Kellie Martin plays a frumpy, responsible accountant, Katie, sensing her dreams have escaped her.  She lives in a pretty, lakeside small town where everyone knows each other and seems to attend the same church.  When the popular advice columnist, ""Viola"", quietly retires, Katie takes over, using her pushed aside writing skills and a knack for heartfelt but no nonsense advice.

She's an instant success, but keeps her identity secret; however, she finds herself falling more and more for a handsome widower, Jefferson Brown, whom she has been writing advice for and urging to get on with living his life even if she isn't.

The actors are good, especially, the woman that plays her closest friend(Jackie Richardson) and sings some classic Gospel songs and the child actor(Kira Gelineau) that  portrays the widower's daughter.  Filmed entirely in Ontario, it's a clean and light tale that grows on one as it mosies along.",1405036800,8,1132,5.220994475138122
6398279,5,B00K19E6XW,Finally!! A quality Hallmark movie!! It's been a long time since I've seen Kellie Martin...she was good.  The daughter was soooo cute!!,1514764800,,135,5.136363636363637
6398280,4,B00K19E6XW,"East Coast waterfront town and a love story that unfolds organically. This is an UP movie, which means church and choir is a bit of it, but not anything intrusive. Good people, cute story, low key and mellow with a heart.",1512432000,,221,4.414634146341464
6398281,5,B00K19E6XW,"This movie was so much better than expected.  I actually just borrowed it from my library.  It's a really clean romantic movie, and I'm not religious at all - but I don't mind movies with a gentle religious overtone.  This is one of those.  Most of the characters happen to go to church and sing in the choir, but the story is not about religion.

It's just a really nice movie about underdogs, and unlikely lonely people finding each other.  It's done in a very positive way, with nothing offensive.

It's really well acted and not too corny.  Kind of like the very best that Lifetime TV has to offer :-)",1506556800,,605,4.387387387387387
6398282,4,B00K19E6XW,I loved Kellie Martin as Viola.  Very cute movie.,1505260800,,49,4.444444444444445

6398284,4,B00K19E6XW,"This is the second time I tried to watch this movie. I am glad I did. I misjudged it before. My review of this movie is that it is an adult movie, not a family movie. The main gist is to be yourself and love others and love will come right to you. The characters are great. I love the singing in this movie. If you hate Church or gospel music, you probably will not like this movie. There are a few scenes of sensuality and low cut dresses. Two men in a bar. However women dress like that and act like that and people drink. These things make the story realistic. I liked this movie because the little girl was a good judge of character and the Dad comes to realize the person he needed and his daughter needed was there in front of him all along. Enjoy!!!",1504224000,,756,4.080536912751678

6398308,5,B00K19E6XW,"A sweet story and a great cast make Dear Viola an absolute gem of a film for the entire family. Honestly, it's great for date nights, family viewing, teen sleepovers, etc. Everyone will find something to love about this movie. I love the story about a writer sidetracked from her career by family responsibilities. There is a recurring theme of love, friendship, loyalty, creativity, inner beauty and more that I found ultimately satisfying and would watch again and again.

If you are searching for a rent or purchase-worthy film, I guarantee you have found it with Dear Viola. Absolutely delightful!",1443398400,4,601,5.01

6398325,2,B00K19E6XW,"It was a mildly cute story.  I think the actors were probably capable of doing better, so I'm inclined to faulty the directing for the extreme mediocrity of the stifled dialog.  It just wasn't even remotely believable--it was just so obvious that everyone was acting, everybody came off as phony.

Sorry. I can't recommend this film to anyone.",1424736000,,343,4.879310344827586
6398326,4,B00K19E6XW,"Modest girl gets her big break at writing a help column. She has a crush on a local town guy but he doesn't seem to notice her. Or maybe he does but the sparks don't fly. Then he hooks up with the new girl in town. So there is a little love drama that ensues.

I really don't know what to think of this movie. Sure it is like all the others. Perfect people. Perfect upscale homes. Simple jobs. Everyone is so soft spoken and pretty. Typical love movie formula. So over all it is OK.

However, the heroine doesn't seem to be made over by the end. She is not very ""lovable"". Not very affectionate. Not very likable even, in a way. I mean you don't hate her. I don't know. I guess the message is a force fairytale message that the good girl wins in the guy in the end. So be it. But there isn't even anything special about this girl for it to make a fairy tale. They don't make her over to she is the swan from the ugly duckling. I mean in the end she just stands there like a knot on a log while she is getting her big romantic hug and kiss. Just like . . . ""OK I'm here."" So I guess they were trying to say that simple is good, which it is. I guess they were trying to say that you shouldn't have to go through a metamorphosis to get a person to like you for you. I dunno. It was a little forced I guess. Usually when someone meets ""the one"" they do a self transformation for that person. Not this chic. She is stiff and awkward from start to finish. I guess she is the type of wife or mom that people say ""Oh that is how she is . . . . "". ""Only so and so could put up with her."" Or, ""only a relative could love her"". I dunno. I mean she isn't horrible. Like I said I really don't know how to fee about this.",1424649600,,1707,3.846590909090909

8655111,4,B00K19E6XW,"I liked this movie - the plot and clean language.  If it didn't portray going to a bar as a good place to find a mate (the movie shows the same guy comfortable in a church and in a bar, which are opposite in nature) and if the clothing on the main character had been better i.e. dresses / skirts to just above the knee rather than several inches above, and regular jean rather than skin-tight pants, I would have given it five stars.",1522540800,,433,4.154761904761905
8655112,4,B00K19E6XW,"This was an exceptionally clean movie. The daughter-daddy relationship was spot on. Kelly Martin was great, and I think portrayed the late thirties, early forties single woman very well. It does seems like it's easy for life to pass you by and the next thing you know a seriousrelationship leading to marriage has passed you by. This is definitely the case for the part Kelly Martin plays in this movie. Things I would change would be to take out or shorten the part towards the end of the movie where a character is singing and playing the piano. A good filler would have been to show the other towns people looking for the daughter. I think it would have made more since to do a small epilogue at the end of the movie as well. The only thing better than a good ending is one that is drawn out a little more. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie for a girl's movie night.",1519948800,,880,4.371951219512195

She brings her own charm to the person of Katie, a shy, unassuming young woman who takes over the advice column ""Dear Viola"" for the tiny local newspaper. Her spicy but compassionate answers make the column and newspaper explode with popularity! This is a delightful story of a small waterfront town with a lovely mix of black and white people who honestly care for each other. Great gospel music that is joyfully uplifting. Love. Laughter.
