8490633,4,B0060QEK4K,"I seen, read and heard so much of Christopher Hitchens over the years, particularly since he passed away, that I can only say that it's always a treat to see a new rendition of him talking to the public.  However, here, he's repeating a lot of his thoughts that I've come to know, and he and I are of nearly identical minds save for his socialist and communist tendencies regarding economics, but even there I think he would probably renege on his stance once he saw social progression through social programs promoted by private enterprise.

I can't say much more here because being a devout non-believer his bullet points regarding the servitude and idiocy of religion match up with mine perfectly.  If you're a devout Catholic or believer in any kind of deity, but don't mind getting your hackles in an uproar, then check this out.

Otherwise, if you're a long time fan, have read much of his material and seen many of his appearances, then you might want to reconsider this program, because it is a kind of rehash of his previous outings.  But it's still a good viewing experience for the Hitchens' aficionado.",1425081600,,1114,4.6923076923076925

8490635,5,B0060QEK4K,"Fascinating look at Hitch shortly before his death. We would have benefited a great deal from 20-30 years of additional thinking from him, but the recorded and written works will have to do. Well worth your time if you are prone to seek knowledge and an alternative view of the world. Salman Rushdie is a wonderful interviewer.",1403395200,,327,4.754385964912281
8490636,5,B0060QEK4K,"Hitchens is one famous person I would have liked to have met, or at least seen lecture in person. He was classically educated, and classically erudite. It's difficult to believe that one brain could contain so much knowledge. Some of us have deep knowledge in one or two areas; others have minds which range miles wide but not very deep. This man had both vast and profound knowledge about so many things, that I'm surprised his head didn't explode. Fortunately, we're left not only with his often brilliant writing, but his always brilliant talks, debates, and speeches.

Graydon Carter, former editor of one of the funniest and smartest magazines ever--Spy--and now editor of Vanity Fair, was a friend of Hitchens'. His education and wit just about matched Hitchens', so this is not only entertaining, it's intimate. If you're not in the mood for Hitchens the firebrand, but want to see a more intimate session, by all means buy this. To me, it's good enough to be watched every once in a while, whenever the need for higher discourse arises. I'm very happy to own it. Do not buy it, however, if you're expecting thunder and lightning. Go with one of the debates, particularly one when he's teamed up with Richard Dawkins, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Sam Harris, or Daniel Dennett, and especially if he's debating Rabbi David Wolpe, who's equally funny and very, very, smart. They make excellent sparring partners.",1399248000,4,1409,4.895397489539749
8490637,4,B0060QEK4K,"I understand what the above reviewer has written, but I liked it. It did not have the punches that Hitch threw to the mostly religious in debates, but Rushdie lets Hitch talk, and while the above reviewer says that Rushdie tries to force his views/stance (etc.) into the interview, I believe that is what he is there for. They were apparently good friends and they are two incredible people with much to say - I think it's entertaining and intelligent.",1374883200,6,452,4.6625
8490638,2,B0060QEK4K,Numerous better Hitchens videos available on youtube. Rushdie was a poor choice to lead the conversation -- was more concerned about overlaying his own views than stimulating Hitch.,1370995200,5,181,5.5
