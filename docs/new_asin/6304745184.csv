8327446,4,6304745184,"Another funny video of Ranma 1/2! Using a magic mirror from Happosai, Ranma tries to go back in time, but instead goes foward to a future where Ryoga is married to Akane!  That kind of distrubed me, especially what  happens to their kids when splashed with cold water...and the second  episode features Ukyo becoming more in touch with her feminine side! Since  Ukyo's my fav character, I really enjoyed the second ep! This is a good buy  for any Ranma fan.",962064000,2,457,4.592592592592593
8327447,4,6304745184,"Okay, I got into a BIG argument with my friend over buying THIS video or  another Ranma 1/2 Video (Marry Me Akane). Marry Me won out because it had  been my gut instinct, and now I regret it. But I've looked at this one...  and it looks VERY interesting. Ranma and Akane... *might* get closer... but  then, even when they do, doesn't someone end up getting hurt again... and  then we go back to ""uncute tomboy!"" and ""pervert!""  again. In the long run, you had to have seen another previous tape that  showed the origin of the mirror, but otherwise, great.",961804800,,555,4.435643564356436
