Here's the official Roman Catholic Exorcism text:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Roman-Ritual-Rituale-Romanum-Vol-2-Christian-Burial-Exorcism-Reserved-Blessings-etc-Latin-English/dp/B0012U5R9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Roman Ritual [Rituale Romanum]: Vol 2: Christian Burial, Exorcism, Reserved Blessings, etc [Latin/English</a>]

This movie sure is scary alright! I'm buying multiple copies of it for my collection.

I won't say too much about the synopsis of this movie as you can read it elsewhere. In summary, this movie it's about a box containing an evil spirit that was bound by Jewish binding rituals. An unsuspecting girl, Emily, opens the box and gets possessed. Strange disturbances occur in the house. The daddy grows desperate in searching for answers that leads him to a Hasidic Jewish community. Although the storyline is simple enough, the drama such is tense and scary! Watch this movie in a theater and you could be jumping out of your seat!

I'm collecting this movie because it is based on a true story, stories rather. Such things are quite common, even though they're never acknowledged by the general public.

This movie will teach everyone a lesson: do NOT ever buy ancient, antique, curious items from unknown sellers, especially those that come with unknown inscriptions that cannot be traced to a safe and reliable source.

The story in this movie is not something new to me, I've personally heard such stories from elsewhere. This is a reason why I went to watch this scary movie.

Sorry to say this, but this is also not the first time I hear of most Jews refusing to exorcise a possessed person out of fear, as seen in the movie. So, what would I advise the daddy in this movie to do? If the Jews are reluctant to deal with their own rituals, go find a real Catholic priest (not those Liberal unbelievers)! For serious cases like the one you see in this movie, it is not advisable to do the ritual on your own like what the daddy tried to do in this movie.

If victims like this Emily character is looking for a lasting solution to her afflictions, the only solution is to turn to the Catholic Church for answers. However, applying for an official exorcism in the Catholic Church could take months for formal approval as the applicant is being checked out and examines by secular medical community and then by the ecclesiastical authorities. There are many reasons for this seemingly bureaucratic process. The Church has had enough of its skeptical and time-wasting scoffers. In the majority of cases, most common applicants need not have a formal exorcism in the first place. Most afflicted applicants give up before they even begin. Compound the bureaucratic process with the fact that the current establishment is Liberal, you'd just have to find a listening ear by looking for a validly ordained Conservative or Traditional priest. There are also the informal rites that an applicant could seek out within the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church has had over 2000 years of historical experience in these things, why find your solutions elsewhere?

The Jews (among others) may bind evil spirits to objects (eg. boxes) to be discarded or buried (posing a danger to an unsuspecting finder); the Catholic Church sends these evil spirits back to Hell. Now, which solution do YOU think is safer for the victim?

5371513,4,B009XTF8JM,I didn't go into this one with high hopes. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a very good horror film and had me squirming and jumping out of my seat a few times. Excellent cast and well directed. Yes it treads familiar territory but it does so with such passion and puts a new spin on the genre you cannot but admire the it. I loved it!,1348272000,6,336,4.029850746268656
5371514,5,B009XTF8JM,I loved this movie. I cant wait for it to come out on dvd! I'll be checking often to see when they finally put out a release date for it!,1348185600,4,137,3.6
5371515,1,B009XTF8JM,"Yup, it's really that bad. Yup its the Gigli of atmospheric bile. It is that bad. I could go on with endless anecdotes and analogies like most of these dolts on Amazon. There is no saving grace. I felt awful when I saw the names scroll at the end, that they had anything to do with this mess. Please, enough already...",1348012800,5,318,4.229508196721311
5371516,3,B009XTF8JM,"As a horror fan I was really excited to see this movie as it was compared to ""The Exorcist"", and although that movie is tame by today's standards it scared the **** out of me when I saw it. So I figured with today's special effects this should be great. And to top it all off, the movie starts by saying it was based on a true story. Well, it had it's moments, but it took almost three quarters of the movie to find out what was possessing the young girl (who was great, by the way) and even then, the effects were really nothing to write home about. There was a good twist at the end - which possibly leaves an opening for a sequel, because with a little research I found that this may not have been based on a true story at all. The movie was ok, I'm glad I saw it, but the next time I'll do a little bit more research before I believe that any movie is as good as ""The Exorcist"".",1347321600,5,882,3.960674157303371
5371517,1,B009XTF8JM,"This movie was beyond terrible.  All it did was rip off scenes from the Exorcist series & the Emily Rose movie. (Which were both great)  The acting was awful and the silly music that played throughout the movie was absolutely hysterical.  I went into the movie theatre thinking that this would be at least watchable , but i was completley disappointed.  So a little girl gets possessed by a spirit living in an evil box.  Her dad does everything he can do to rid her of this being even telling the evil spirit to come into me (which is exactly what happened in the end of the Exorcist).  Throw in the bad writing and terrible acting & there you go...thats your movie.  What i would like to do is repossess my $15 that I wasted on going to see this piece of garbage.",1346976000,9,765,4.3076923076923075
5371518,3,B009XTF8JM,"This was okay.  But Raimi fans will find no Drag Me to Hell gross-out gore and generally horror fans will not see original scenes (regarding scares), provocative possession behavior, or unique plot elements.  The newer you are to the genre (or, possession or demon box movies, per se) the more you will enjoy this finely prepared, but under-seasoned meal.  While perfectly competent for a horror, let's call it the ""Diet Coke"" of exorcism; a series of missed opportunities and pulled punches.

Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick), Em[ily] (Natasha Calis) and her older sister are a family recently sundered by a rather civil divorce.  But when young Em becomes fond of an antique puzzle box she finds at a yard sale things start to get strange.  Em becomes temperamental, graduating to obsessive about the box while apathetic (even sociopathic) of the needs or wants of others.  Clyde begins to suspect a malevolent force is at work and seeks the aid of the Hasidic elders, from whom we learn about demons (or dibbuks), their specially crafted, imprisoning boxes, and exorcism.

Most truly impressive was our young Natasha Calis as Em.  She did an amazing job showing us that as the demon commanded more and more of her conscious self (to the point of entirety) that underneath she was aware of her uncharacteristic, marionetted actions.  Her expressive eyes were the key.  Somehow malevolent on the possessed outside, while only thinly veiling the sadness and desperation of the scared child trapped within behind the evil veneer.  As her desperate and fearful father, Jeffrey Dean Morgan also does a spectacular job as the serial-recipient of her cold, lifeless gazes.  But all of this amazing tone contributed to only minor tension with no real follow-through.  The scares really weren't there for me--not even a bit, short of being taken off guard by blaring loud noises which, while a classic tactic, should come with a little more than just a lone, pounding instrumental note.  I feel like they pulled too many punches--or simply didn't have the muscle to throw them in the first place.  No exorcism should be devoid of offensive material, but this movie was completely inoffensive.  This is really like an Exorcist-lite movie; the ""Diet Coke"" of exorcism movies; a series of missed opportunities or, perhaps even, a Disney-appropriate version of The Exorcist.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, however. That is, unless, you enjoy R-rated horror movies.  Some PG-13's pull it off--this one didn't.

The only truly unique moment of the film was a brief scene of moths hurricaning around Em's bedroom.  Everything else has been done before--not that I'm suggesting it's easy to produce something you've never seen in a horror flick nowadays.  The exorcism scene in the end is stunningly similar, even copied, to that of The Unborn (2008), as is the general Jewish demon premise (with a few tweaks).

To the seasoned viewer, this film might come off as at least a little bit boring when the filmmakers aren't trying to scare you with loud noises (and little clout to back them).  I kept feeling a bit of the Sam Raimi vibe, but just when I thought it would hit with something shocking, gastro-intestinally gross and gory, or totally twisted--it wouldn't happen!  Instead I just got dirty Ring-Grudge hands, a swarm zombie moths, whited-out ""possessed"" eyes, and a bunch of child-gone-wrong temper tantrums.  There were also some significant plot holes--not that that's a surprise in a horror film--which didn't even get a nod.  For example, something awful happens to Stephanie's boyfriend and he vanishes from the movie, then everyone behaves as if he was never there whereas earlier he was playing a father-replacement role much to Clyde's chagrin.  Then there was the fact that there was a horribly bandaged woman in the house where they bought the dibbuk box--ever think to go ask them about it before turning to obscure experts?  I saw the ending coming from a mile away but, as a serious horror fan, I still appreciated the oft-told ominous closing message.

In the end this was a perfectly competent, well-acted horror film with a less common spin on a quite common story.  A little too light for my taste, but heavy-handed horror and sacrilegious scenarios are not for everyone.  If you are ""not everyone"" then maybe this very PG possession movie is for you.

SIDBAR:  This movie is a slightly different take on The Unborn (2009), in which Odette Annabel/Yustman is plagued by her unborn Dibbuk demon twin--not The Unborn (1991), in which a woman has a mutant, murderous baby a la It's Alive (1974, 2008 remake).  On that note, let's just snuff out the fact that sooo many people are thrilled to see ""this new take"" on ""the first Jewish exorcism"" movie.  It's not.  It's at least the second and is basically a reboot with some scenes remade from The Unborn.  This movie is also in no way related to the ultra-weird and cerebral Possession (1981, with Sam Neil).

BIPOLAR REVIEWS:  Hop on to IMDB as scan the already numerous reviews and you'll find that everyone is loving or loathing this flick.  My guess is that the loathers have seen far more horror flicks than the lovers.",1346630400,61,5210,4.928899082568807

5371520,5,B009XTF8JM,"This horror tale is one of the most scariest movies I've ever seen. This terrifying tale of demonic possession is about a broken family,and right after a divorce, they get attacked by a supernatural entity. A young girl purchases an antique box from a yard sale, then her behavior begins to change as evil threatens to take over her body and soul. Her frantic father, who is in a state of panic, begins to realize what the demon is attempting to do to the child and tries to help. Edge-of-your-seat thrills and chills from start to finish.

The additional family tension sort of ""tightens"" things in the way tension should, and THOSE DAMN MOTHS EVERYWHERE! add some very respectably creepy, moody bits of savory horrific goodness.

If your complaint is the idea's been done before then everything produced after Shakespeare is repetition, everything's a variation on a theme, and what a variation! Acting is superb, the adults are well known but the kids are amazing, both girls, and if the kids can't cut it in horror then you've lost it. But they go above and beyond, the youngest produces a perfect balance of both her characters, demon & child, and never muddles them or seems unable to deliver (where do they find these kids?). Nice minimalist use of effects, great story, first class production. The Jewish twist (every belief has evil) is brilliant & fresh. The box is a perfect vehicle as the center of creepiness. The small but important detail of the youngest girl's tears is poignantly terrifying as it reveals, when you think its only the demon, that she is still trapped in there... that was so subtle and incredibly effective.

The latest in an endless stream of Exorcist retreads churned out since William Friedkin's 1973 masterpiece, Bornedal's dispiritingly unscary pic is a slick, efficient piece of hokum about a 10-year-old girl; a gnarly demon with gnarled fingers who has grown way too fond of her; her perennially worried, recently divorced parents; and a charming, bon mots-dispensing Hasidic-scholar-and-part-time-exorcist. Hasidic?

In a variation on a theme, the existential smackdown in The Possession isn't Catholic-flavored but Jewish. And why not? All three Abrahamic faiths have some version of the ritual. And the last noteworthy film in the genre, 2010's The Last Exorcism, featured an evangelical Protestant.

Sadly, this is the only novel aspect of Bornedal's dud.

Set in upstate New York, The Possession stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick as the divorced couple Clyde and Stephanie.

She's working hard to move on, having added to her wardrobe a psychotically chipper passive-aggressive dentist named Brett (Grant Show) who dotes on her much in the manner of a poodle.

Clyde, a manboy college basketball coach, is a melancholy fatalist, forever stuck in the past. Morgan and Sedgwick are good together, forever skirting each other in a tender, if sad and awkward dance. They clash when it comes to their two daughters, the whiny teenage rebel Hannah (Madison Davenport) and the eminently huggable Emily (Natasha Calis). Clyde spoils them, leaving Stephanie to play the disciplinarian.

The family's shattered life fragments further when Emily buys a wicked-looking (and, wicked) antique wooden box covered in foreboding patterns and inscribed with Hebrew script.

Inside the box, Emily finds a bunch of small wooden boxes filled with creepy objects - an intact molar with long, clawlike roots; a dead (or is it?), desiccated, and mummified moth; tufts of human hair. Creepier still, Emily finds these tokens of death and decay charming.

There's a whole moth subtext in the film, which features numerous scenes of a stupefied Emily surrounded by preternatural moth activity. (But why moths? Why?)

It's not long before Emily is taken over by a malevolent spirit called a dybbuk. She acquires a killer temper - and a murderous temperament.

Enter the exorcist, Tzadok, who is played with delightfully hammy lan by Hasidic hip-hop and reggae rhymester Matisyahu. He chants and incants, then chants some more incantations.

The rest, you've seen 100 times already.

The Possession has none of the suspense that made Bornedal's morgue thriller Deathwatch such shuddering good fun. And despite the absurdly overwrought Bernard Herrmann-esque score, it has very few genuine shocks.

Sure, the film is well-crafted, well-paced, well-shot, and well-acted. But it's, well, so very bland.",1474588800,2,2922,5.365426695842451

I have always been a fan of possession films. It has always been a creepy reality in my mind. This plays on the legend of the Jewish Dybbuk Box, which is a box that contains a demon, which on an interesting note you can find them on eBay. A fun simple horror film that can get under your skin.

Standard plot and slightly annoying music and sound effects. Directed well but not to perfection. All in all watchable and interesting without all the gore. The pace is slow to build but I still found myself asking ""Ok, what will happen next?"". This is what I enjoy the genre for. Albeit the payoff is not superb but it is there and this fits nicely into a good solid scare for the entire family including children down to 9 or 10 if they are mature. Some of the writing and plot holes could be a whole lot better for certain. However, I liked it and found it entertaining for the solid acting alone. I loved ""The Ring"" but found the acting horrific. Being able to make me enter the world of the characters and make me take sides is why I love movies whatever the genre. This is a movie worth seeing. I'd buy the disk used or spend no more than $7 new. This movie reminded me of the old Friday or Saturday night scare shows with movies that were just scary enough to get you blood to quicken but not so much that you ended up feeling like you visited an autopsy in progress.",1447632000,,1194,4.287610619469026

5371624,2,B009XTF8JM,"Most films dealing with demonic possession are typically of the Roman Catholic variety with a priest attempting to exorcise the evil spirit.  The Possession doesnt have a ton going for it but at least it attempts to do something a bit different with the subject.  Cylde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) are a recently divorced couple sharing custody of their two daughters Em and Hannah.  The daughters are still trying to come to grips with their parents divorce when Clyde takes them to his new house.  At a nearby yard sale Clyde buys Em an old antique wooden box that has Hebrew letters carved into it.

The box initially appears to be locked with no means of opening it but Em soon manages to find a way to get it open and reveal its strange contents including a dead moth, a tooth, and a ring which she begins to wear.  Em soon becomes distant violent, attacking a student in her class and then stabbing her father with a fork.  Soon other strange phenomena take place including Ems room being filled with moths.

As Ems behavior becomes more erratic, Clyde takes the box to a professor at the college where he coaches basketball, and its revealed that the box is a Dybbuk box, a box that holds the captured spirit of a Dybbuk, an evil spirit out of Jewish mythology.  Clyde visits a Hasidic Jewish community in New York, seeking their aid to help defeat the dybbuk that now possess his young daughter.

The Possession is an interesting slant on the genre but with a PG-13 rating it simply doesnt have enough bite to be an effective chiller.  With a miniscule budget of only $14 million, Director Ole Bornedal has to rely more on creating atmosphere than utilizing visual effects.  He pulls this off quite well for the most part but cant maintain it over the long haul.  The last 15 minutes degrades into silliness as one of the Rabbis tries to force the Dybbuk from Ems body and back into the box when she is in the hospital.  The parents run off with Em to find a private area so the Rabbi can perform his exorcism.  No problem because there is no hospital staff to be found. Horror movies are the only times you see a hospital almost completely empty.

I like both Morgan and Sedgwick but just didn't buy either of them in their roles as parents to young girls, especially Morgans role as a college basketball coach.  All in all The Possession is a forgettable diversion at best.",1438387200,,2407,4.534722222222222

Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays a workaholic coach and father of two who fights for his daughters life when he cannot separate one of his daughters from the box that controls her. Kyra Sedgwick plays the mother who at first cannot believe what she sees and then is helpless to stop the chaos.

These have been rare in recent times in favor of the other two genre styles, but I really like this type of film best when it is well done - and this one was. The only other recent film I would put on par with it is, The Woman in Black, which I also liked very much. In terms of plot and content, the closest film that compares with it is The Conjuring. The Possession does not quite come up to the level of The Conjuring on the creepiness scale, but it comes close. Worth a watch (but not alone).",1420588800,,709,4.071428571428571

5371713,1,B009XTF8JM,"It was bound to happen, and now it has.  Here we have the Jewish version of The Exorcist, oy vey. The Possession is as interesting as a stink bug on a hot summer day, and as terrifying as a lady bug.. It's rated PG-13, which means it's weak, and ""presented"" by Sam Rami; which doesn't mean anything other than he put up the money to have this disappointment made. It's far worse than any of the Exorcist sequels.

The story is not original and while it says ""based on a true story"", you could swear it feels like a bad Japanese inspired mess like The Grudge or One Missed Call, but far worse.. A gust of wind, a scary stare and a high pitched scream from a little girl, ooooh, yeah, I'm scared... ugh.

The only ones I feel badly for are Kyra Sedgwick, who deserves way better than this made for generic Lifetime Television-ish fare, and Grant Show, who is the TV version of superior actor Vigo Mortensen, and he just can't seem to catch a break with anything since the original Melrose Place ended two decades ago.",1416096000,,1015,4.35978835978836

5371717,5,B009XTF8JM,"I recently watched a different movie about an exorcism, an ecumenical exorcism no less, which I found very amusing; especially since it was suypposed tone about the birth of a  mythological Jewish demon known as a Dybuuk or something of that nature. It was like, hey everybody let's have an exorcism party, everybody's invited. very strange.

anyhow, I enjoyed The Possession but I wish their weren't so many convenient plot holes but it does work.
There are some glaring gaps in logic which I find impossible to reconcile; for instance, how is it that the evil trapped within the box can still exert itself to the outside world. In theory, the box is supposed to be a blessed, ancient Judaic holy vessel made specifically to contain the evil.
It's too bad the dentist get's killed; he and the mother were made for each other. She sounded like a real pain in the you know what. The biological father is a very likable fellow although the extent of his patience is unreal.

In the end we get a glimpse of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, the enclave of Orthodox Judaism and the scene with the elders is very believable and it makes sense.  Deciding to hold the exorcism in the physical rehab room in the hospital basement wit all that screaming and mayhem going on is a bit ridiculous, I mean the entire hospital must have known something was going on but at least in The Possession it was a Rabbi who conducted the exorcism.

The ending is an unpleasant surprise, the death of the heroic young Rabbi who follows his conscience (and finds a loophole in Rabbinical Scripture) rather than chickening out is heartbreaking, but there again is the plot hole that runs throughout the movie.",1415664000,,1676,4.687074829931973

It's creepy and scary because the plot is not one of those completely outlandish, never-could-happen scenarios. The setting is somewhat realistic (kind of like how the setting is normal and realistic in the original ""Halloween"" movie before things get out of control and Michael Myers comes along). The movie is based on some facts that occurred in the past (totally worth reading about, by the way), however, it's NOT the real-life story of a family like the one portrayed in this movie. Still, the movie is very compelling, and it unfolds in a way that increases your fear at all the right moments. I personally started watching this movie with extreme skepticism that I would like it at all. However, I was very, very pleasantly surprised. In my opinion, the actors do a fantastic job, and I personally will add this one to my ""Halloween"" movie collection to watch year after year.",1412812800,,972,4.785714285714286

The little girl called Em does her acting really well in this movie (at least for me). She becomes pretty scary.

It says based on a true story but the only ""true"" part is the wine cabinet which is a debatable ""truth"" as well.  The movie is entertaining though.  It is well casting and acting is very good.  I though the pace of the movie seemed appropriate.  It has some freaky moments.  It also has some moments that leave you with a feeling of ""Oh come on now, that's ridiculous"":  Not a movie of the year, nor will it be one you must see or must own a copy of.

During one weekend sleepover he allows his daughters to buy some items at a garage sale, one of which turns out to be a dybbuk box (a box designed to keep captive an evil spirit), and creepiness ensues!  This is a movie that has special effects but doesn't depend exclusively on them to deliver the scares.

Even 9 year old girls are portrayed as bossing their 'dad' around by telling him what he needs to buy, when, and what he needs to do....and they all do it with that stupid look on their face that reeks of arrogance and stupidity.

5371837,4,B009XTF8JM,"I won't say I'm a scholar of any kind, but I love reading up on Judaica and the history of the religion, and I had never heard of a Dibbuk box before. So it was great to see a film show and explore possession from a non-Christian point of view. Natasha Calis was a true find as a child actress, a combination of Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther from Orphan and of Daveigh Chase and Samara from The Ring. A lot of adult actors could not effortlessly flow through the range of emotions she showed, from obsessive malevolence when she's either possessed or separated from her box to horror and fear over what she is becoming. Some of the visual imagery is striking as well, the moths everywhere, the creature showing up on the scan, but especially the fingers in the throat. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick are great as well, as a man who knows something is wrong with his daughter and will go to any lengths to find out what it is and help her, and a woman who initially believes it's just the stress of the broken marriage and possible abuse of Em by her father, then suddenly comes to the realization that whatever is happening to her little girl is not earthly. The only part of the film that sort of made me pull a bit of a facepalm was the ending, I'm getting more than a little sick of the well-worn clich of divorced/separated couples who spend the entire film being fairly antagonistic towards each other, then suddenly rekindle their love through a shared crisis. We've seen it in Jurassic Park III, Twister, and several other films, it's worn out its welcome. I also felt the death of Tzadok was gratuitous, even if it was supposed to show that the evil of the box obviously hadn't been successfully ""contained"" as he and the family thought it had.

Without giving anything away it brings some real chills to the table without much gore by making use of a talented young actress, Natasha Calis, who can throw a disturbing stare with her dark eyes which foretell something bad is about to happen.  As far as the horror genre usually goes,this is rather tame and can probably be watched by families together sans any kids younger than 12 or so as it is not overly graphic and only has a couple of questionable words.

For me an added bonus was Jewish rapper Matisyahu as a young man who feels compelled to offer assistance after his Rabbi father turns the little girls father away when he desperately seeks help.

However.  Well, there's just no way to sugar coat this: Exorcisms are boring. They are just as boring when Jews perform them as they are when Catholics perform them (Hebrew or Latin, I don't care - equal opportunity yawn fest). I know I should have been expecting an exorcism from a film with ""possession"" in the title, and I guess I knew it was just a matter of time. But hasn't that cliche been thrashed to death, already?

5371910,4,B009XTF8JM,"I feel this was a great movie and very unique. Was it the exorcist, no. Was it the best movie ever, not by a long shot. But it was entertaining and the story was captivating. It was more about intrigue than scares.

Most horror movies that come out these days lack the element of story telling. In my opinion, the story is the most important factor in making a good horror film. I don't need a masked killer jumping out of nowhere wielding a machete, or guts getting ripped out to scare me. It's all been done over and over again for centuries and has become so commonplace now that it has just became a mockery.

If a story is suspensful and tells a good story at the same time, which is pretty uncommon today, you then have a recipe for a quality horror film (or any genre of film for that matter), and that's what this movie did. And the story of the dibbuk box is fascinating and persuaded me to look further into the subject.

I also was not expecting Matisyahu to be in it. Turns out he is a good actor. Apparently he wasnted to be an actor before he became a musician. As an actor, I respect him. As a person, not so much after he decided to renounce his faith in Judiasm, but continue to use the name Matisyahu instead of calling himself Matthew Miller. I feel he just sold out and is banking off of the name he made for himself as the unique reggae star that he had become.

But I digress. This is a quality movie which I'm glad is available for free on prime. If you don't have prime, it may not be worth a $20-$30 purchase, but I definitely at least reccomend renting it.",1383782400,,1582,4.194078947368421
5371911,5,B009XTF8JM,Knowing that this movie was a true story was what caught my interest. Now having seen it I'm terrified that it could happen. The added bonus was the little girls acting was highly expressive.,1383436800,,191,4.647058823529412
5371912,2,B009XTF8JM,"I'm not sure why, other than marketing, this movie was touted as being based on a true story. I've read the story of the dibbuk box (it's easy to find online) and that would have made a fine, creepy movie that perhaps someone will make someday. What we're left with is the tale of a young girl who doesn't know how to act, who happens to own a old wooden box.

If you've seen the trailers, you've likely seen the single scene in the entire movie that isn't a complete cliche - the girl, looking into the mirror, sees two fingers reaching up out of her throat. If you could somehow just focus on that image for two hours, you'll have had a more satisfying viewing experience than actually seeing the movie. Mostly, it's just a movie that desperately wants to be The Exorcist (seriously, there's even an MRI scene), but fails at even that, nevermind being a functional and enjoyable movie that can stand on its own.

I'm being charitable giving even two stars, and it earns that second one just for casting Hasidic Jewish reggae artist Matisyahu as...well, a Hasidic Jewish exorcist. Unlike so many bad horror movies, this one didn't even manage to solicit laughter from me. Mostly I just felt sorry for everyone involved.",1383436800,2,1220,4.591743119266055

5371925,3,B009XTF8JM,"""The Exorcist"" was a groundbreaking film. It wasn't just a fright fest. It had a strong socio-political subtext that gave it depth. Other than that, the only film involving possession to reach near the same level of quality is ""The Conjuring."" All others, and there are quite a few, pale by comparison. ""Possession"" is no exception.

Here's the scoop. Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) are recently divorced. He's trying to get back on the fast track as a basketball coach and she's starting up a business. Their two young girls are coping well enough with the situation. Dad takes them garage sale hunting where the younger daughter finds an antique box. She brings it to dad's new home and, little by little, she comes under the spell of said box. Now mom and dad need to get her released.

This is kind of a sucky movie. I kept seeing things that I'd seen before. As in Spielberg's ""Poltergeist"" he situates dad's new house in a new subdivision. As in ""The Exorcist"" you're dealing with a broken family. As a matter of fact there were a few elements taken from ""The Exorcist."" But this is just a sketch of a movie. There is little here with any resonance or lasting quality. There were a few good scares and a few good scenes. I like Jeffrey Dean Morgan and he's decent enough here. I like Kyra Sedgwick but her part is poorly written. I suppose the big surprise was seeing Yiddish rapper Matisyahu as the Jewish exorcist. It was shot well enough. The sound mixing was suspect and the directing was uneven. I've seen director Ole Bornedal's ""I Am Dina"" which I liked quite a bit. But he also directed ""Nightwatch"" which I hated more than I can say.

Audiences love a good, scary movie. They love being scared without an actual threat, but chances are, unless you're young, or new to the genre, there won't be much to raise the hairs on your arms here.",1380758400,,1878,4.566765578635015

I enjoyed this movie but at times it was hard for me to keep focus. I have definitely seen scarier movies, however there are definitely some very creepy scenes. I think the actress playing Emily did a very good job, as did Jeffery Dean Morgan. Kyra Sedgwick did okay but I am willing to give her performance to bad writing than just her. The overall concept is super interesting and the real life story that this is based on is super fun to read.

The pacing in this movie is okay and I think the movie's biggest fault is the writing. It is creepy at times but I never really felt scared during the movie (however if you have Mottephobia you might find this movie very scary).

I can't understand good ratings on a movie that pulled out of all it's scares to maintain a tame rating. Don't get me wrong a good horror/scary movie doesn't need to be rated r for it to be a good movie but the slow burn possession didn't make sense on a subject everyone knew the outcome to. With the sensitive subject matter such as demonic possession it should at least do the genre justice. A run of the mill get any audience in the theater type movie regardless of age is becoming the formula for these type of movies. Rather than substance or a core audience it requires no after thought or thought at all everything is spelled out and dumbed down for a general audience for the sake of easy ticket sales. Now I love a good absent minded, fun movie romp but this movie took itself to seriously to be enjoyable.

5371974,3,B009XTF8JM,"""The Possession"" is yet another supernatural horror in which a young girl starts behaving strangely because of some mysterious entity. Produced by Sam Raimi (and other fourteen producers), ""The Possession"" is a throwback to the 70's horror films including ""The Exorcist."" The film, which purports to be a character driven thriller, is not that thrilling because of the clichd storytelling and not-so-interesting characters.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Edward Blake/The Comedian of ""Watchmen"") is Clyde Brenek, a recently divorced basketball coach and father of two daughters Emily (Natasha Calis) and Hannah (Madison Davenport). However, since the day they bought an old box at a yard sale, Emily starts to act strangely,

The film's story is based on a Los Angeles Times article ""A jinx in a box?"" by Leslie Gornstein July 25, 2004, about a small wooden box - a ""dybbuk box"" - put on an online auction. I found the original article more intriguing than the film that relies on genre clichs. Also, sometimes I just couldn't know whether or not I should take the film's ""scares"" seriously, including the MRI sequence that made me scratch my head.

Directed by Ole Bornedal (""Nightwatch"" shot twice by the same director), ""The Possession"" keeps us interested throughout because of its dramatic strength, but as a horror the film just lacks originality and creativity that this story really needs.",1370995200,,1388,5.16

I won't go too much into the plot because there are plenty of places that lay it out, but I will say this - when the best actor in your movie is Matisyahu, you know you have a problem.

The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it's so bad it actually becomes hilarious. Scenes that should be scary will just leave you laughing. So if you're into really bad movies and laughing *at* them instead of *with* them, you may get some enjoyment out of this. Otherwise, just watch The Exorcist.",1369699200,,630,4.294117647058823
5371979,4,B009XTF8JM,"THE POSSESSION

This movie had two things going for to gain my interest, the first was that Sam Raimi and company produced it. Then of course there is the obvious reason which is that it is an exorcism movie. That is two reason and good enough reasons for me to this. So when I eventually got around to checking it out I have to say that I was pleased with my viewing experience.

A divorced couple is trying hard to get along and do right by their daughters, sharing custody. The father takes his daughters one day and happens upon a yard sell; the owners of the house may or may not have just been involved in something dark. While there the youngest comes across a box that catches her fancy. Of course daddy wants to make her happy so he buys it for her. Everything is fine until they get to the new house that their father has gotten. That night things start to go bump in the night and strange things happen time after time. The youngest daughter seems to be the only one affected and it is driving the family even further apart. But she may be in serious danger as something dark and old may be lurking inside her newly found box.

This film is based on a true story about a thing called the Dybbuk Box, which is a wine cabinet that supposedly houses an evil spirit. This is all based on Jewish legend which of course plays heavily in the film, refreshing new spin on the usually Catholic exorcism flick. I have heard of this before and a Dybbuk has been mention or used in films previous to this. Any way this movie is based on the box that was involved in the e-bay story. You should research this further if interested. I know that it has been the subject of a few TV shows including ""Paranormal Witness"" I believe.

I have to say that director Ole Bornedal really knows what he is doing. The atmosphere that he creates in this film is great and may be the best thing about the film. Of course the writers deserve credit here as they adapted the story of what really happened into this film. There were some big changes if you watch the special features like the real story feature or listen to the 2 great commentaries. Also I loved the performances here but the show stealer was probably Natasha Callis, the youngest of the kids. She is wonderful here but so is everyone else if that wasn't clear from my previous sentence. Also I liked musician Matisyahu here, I actually had no idea he was in it until he popped up.

This movie had some creepy moments in it but it was not over done which makes it a watchable film for younger viewers in my opinion. Also the DVD comes with those bonus features I mentioned earlier among others so it is a good purchase. I do recommend this film to any horror or exorcism movie fan. Maybe a night featuring this, ""The Innkeepers"", ""Sinister"", ""Mama"" and ""The Woman in black"" is in my near future.

An extra on the DVD, ""The Real History of the Dibbuk Box,"" is far scarier than the film itself.  Whether the real Dibbuk box actually is cursed or not is a fun discussion, however the coincidental events that transpired over the lifespan of the box definitely provides a haunting, real-world interest for me.

After a divorce the dad gets his own house while driving past some houses his youngest daughter ( Emily ) spots a garage sale his daughter reminds him that he needs dishes, they stop and while looking at things ( Emily ) see's an old wooden box with words carved into it.

After a visit to a professor for a translation then a rabi they learn that the box is actually a prison/vessel to keep a powerful and ancient female demon locked inside, in Jewish language she is named taker of children, a young rabi performs an exorcism and all hell breaks loose

The movie is a mix of drama family love and horror it feels very realistic, the actors give excellent performances and play their parts very convincingly.

5372004,4,B009XTF8JM,"The Possession follows a recently divorced couple and their kids. It mainly follows Clyde, the father, and Emily, the younger daughter, after they purchase a haunted box and release a demon. The Possession is a creepy possession film.

The story in The Possession is creepy and often unsettling; I'm a fan of possession films and haven't seen a great one in a long time, so this was a pleasant surprise. I like the approach of the film; it doesn't rely on bone-popping, excessive vulgar language, or heavy special effects. However, I wasn't a big fan of the storytelling. A lot of events in this film occur spontaneously, and end suddenly - no lead up or continuity; for example, the breakfast scene suddenly starts, then ends rapidly without much explanation before and after. This happens often, even the music starts to build up then suddenly cuts to the next scene. I liked this at first, but then it got a bit repetitive, especially since it used the same music. It has some scary moments, both with jump-scares and disturbing imagery, and it at least takes some time to develop a sweet father-daughter relationship. Although it is often somewhat disturbing, the film is very tamed and never shocking, this may be a plus or negative depending on your taste. The acting was great, I really liked Natasha Calis' performance. The music was also great and atmospheric, although repetitive.

The Blu-ray of this film has excellent picture and sound quality. However, the Blu-Ray lacks special features as it only has some audio commentary and trailers.

Overall, The Possession is a great possession film; not the best, but definitely better than recent attempts, like ""The Devil Inside"". A purchase is recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.

The Possession has some violence and blood.",1365465600,,1802,4.956953642384106

5372016,3,B009XTF8JM,"I decided to rent this. Why not, I've seen just about every exorcism movie there is.
This one brings us another little girl who is plagued by a demon via a magic Jewish box meant to imprison it.
A new twist for sure but not enough to save an otherwise mediocre movie.
Body contortions, check.
A few J horror style scares that were lifted right from The Grudge.
The mom was the only really convincing actor.
The dad was annoying as were both daughters.
I recommend a rental to exorcism completists.
For everyone else...skip it.
This movie brings nothing new worth mentioning.
Satan should fire his agent because at this rate his street cred is going downhill fast.",1364083200,,663,4.627118644067797
5372017,4,B009XTF8JM,"The Possession is a true story about a box that when open takes over the life of the person that opens it, and jeopardizes the lives of others around that person when the evil acts are released upon them a true horror flick.",1364083200,,224,4.232558139534884
5372018,4,B009XTF8JM,"I think this movie was fantastic. The slow build of what the demon was doing to Emily, the daughter, was excellently done.  She didn't open the box and automatically become possessed; it was a slow build as it would be if a real possession were occurring.  The way they made the special effects that were used with the girl's eyes were a fantastic touch.  So often in these films you see the person's eyes roll in the back of their head but this time each moved independently of each other and they were moving sideways rather than up/down which added an air of creepiness to it, I think that's a good term here.
I know some people will complain about the lack of blood & gore but personally I found the amount used in this film were perfect; after all, blood and gore doesn't make a horror movie good; it's what is left to your imagination such as when they don't show very much of what happened to Emily's teacher that makes a horror movie special.  I've seen many movies that had a ton of blood/gore and the movie was completely horrible, such as the Evil Dead movie.
In closing I'll say this; it isn't often that a horror movie or a movie in general leave me with the chills after it's done being watched but this film actually did.  The man who played the father, who also happened to play the dad in the Supernatural series, really knows how to work the facial expressions and emotions; the way he looked when his daughter was fighting the possession and when he first figured out it wasn't human it added something special to the movie; that really tugged at your heart strings & believe me, that isn't easily done; especially in this day & age with the movie industry.  I would highly recommend this movie.",1363996800,,1714,4.442675159235669
5372019,5,B009XTF8JM,"I watch a lot of horror movies.  Have for years.  I was feeling numb to them but this one got me!  Actually turned on the lights.  Really great twists.  This is not an Exorcist rip off.  This one is based on old Jewish mythology of the dibbuk.  A human who is so evil they are condemned to live as deamons for all time.  The DVD includes the story behind the story and it is facinating.

I cannot say I have seen many movies that feature religious Jews.  I am not Jewish so I am not exactly looking for them.  This one introduces a Jewish exorcism which is not like the catholic one at all.  I was facinated by that.  A glimpse into a world I never see,

I have never seen a horror movie where a religious Jew was the hero.",1363910400,32,723,4.035460992907802

5372021,5,B009XTF8JM,"This movie is in a special category. It has an excellent plot and the most awesome part about it is that there is no sexual stuff. There are a lot of horror movies that get ruined (in my opinion) with a bunch of people talking about nasty stuff and doing nasty stuff. What is the world teaching our children? You can't watch cable without hearing about erectile dysfunction! I don't want to answer that question from my 11 yr old. Ok off the subject, long story short a must see for people that like scary movies without the nastiness. Family friendly if your children like scary movies.",1363737600,8,587,4.4953271028037385

5372023,4,B009XTF8JM,"Lots of Exorcist plotline reworked with some elements from the classic Pandora's Box tale. This time a dybbuk  a malicious spirit in Jewish folklore (also spelled dibbuk) is the culprit. This movie is more of a combination of concepts from other tales nicely woven into a similar tale. There is a bunch of strings left loose and several WTF moments, but overall enjoyable.

5372026,4,B009XTF8JM,"I thought this movie was really good actually. So many horror movies nowadays are boring and lack uniqueness. I really enjoyed this movie and i saw it twice in theaters. Yes some of the scenes are corny and cheesy but some scenes are genuinely scary. Long story shot - girl finds box -box possesses girl. It sounds simple yet it is so well done. No this isn't going to compare to anything like The Shining or Nightmare on Elm Street . But compared to most horror movies coming out these days this is a really good flick. I don't like writing descriptions because i feel like it gives to much away but i would check out IMDB if you want to learn more. Some things you might come across during the film are ( bugs, runaway, hitting, sisters, garage sale, hospital, divorce, bone, yelling, teeth, dancing, etc)The acting from the kids is pretty good but the adults are much better of course.

My husband had played me some of his rap before, so it was cool to see him in this. I thought that Natasha Calis was great.

5372035,4,B009XTF8JM,I would actually rate it about 3.5 to 4 stars.  It's a great movie if you are into these types of films.  I also thought that it was interesting that the film presents the subject of possession from the aspect of the Jewish faith instead of the from the aspect of Catholicism which pretty much every other film on the topic does.  So it was unique in that regard.,1362873600,,363,4.231884057971015

5372038,4,B009XTF8JM,"Immediately, I thought that Javier Bardem was in this film as the father character.  I guess it's really Jeffrey Dean Morgan, a ""poor man's"" Bardem, although Mr. Morgan is pretty good here, at least with what he has to work with.

Why is it that nowadays, most male leads in film have to be these overly sensitive whimps?  It's actually getting a little irritating and distracting.  And this trend continues here with Mr. Morgan's character.  Yeah, he's strong I suppose when he needs to be, but for the most part, he just lays down and allows the rest of the cast -- mostly female -- to dominate the story.  I'm sure that this is the way that the director wanted it, perhaps to pull in more of a female audience, but that doesn't mean that I had to like it.  Where's Javier when we need him, the guy in ""No Country for Old Men""?  Now THAT was a strong male character.  OK, you're right; perhaps he was a little too strong.

But besides this major complaint, this film is actually pretty decent.  The possession scenes are actually pretty scary, and I jumped a few times when I expected members of the family to get whacked.  And I really liked the idea that the exorcist character was Jewish.  After all, Satan is an equal-opportunity destroyer.  Why do the Christians get to have all the fun?

What's the theme of the movie?  Well, I'm not exactly sure.  But I can give you a couple of morals.  1.  Don't put your hand in the cookie jar.  It may ruin more than just dinner.  2.  Don't dial and drive.  You might get more than just a ticket.

Probably more like a 3.5, but I'll round up today since I had a few good frights and I was mostly entertained.  But can we get some strong male leads again already?",1362700800,,1708,4.346031746031746

Her divorced parents struggle with each other while the dad seems to almost immediately dive feet first into easily believing that a demon has possessed his daughter.

I was entertained by the movie but it's not very scary and pretty predictable. The acting from Jeffrey Dean Morgan is great and the Jewish priest did an excellent job as well but every one else was mostly forgettable. The music was nothing special and there weren't that many effects to comment on or if there were they weren't impressive enough to think about.

Several scenes would build to a high point but would then suddenly cut off to a new scene. It was as though the writers had written themselves into a corner and were unsure of how to end a scene so they just didn't and began the next one.

Even though my review seems mostly negative I was interested all the way through I just had to keep stopping myself from noticing a lot of silly and easily avoidable mistakes. It's a very toned down horror flick but it's an entertaining one if you don't really think about it.

It seems that every horror film (especially those with demons in them) needs to differentiates itself from their predecessors by having at least one thing that's original or that you haven't seen before. In ""The Possession"", one scene is letting us see demonic fingers trying to climb the throat of the poor possessed girl! And one MRI from the hospital shows the demon's face roaming inside the girl's heart! There you go. Demons can physically live inside one's body. Not spiritually. Physically. Haven't seen that before, have you? I call it the ""Fright Night"" effect, in honor of the 1985 vampire flick in which you learned that crosses were only working if you had true faith.

That is the only thing to remember from this film. For a serious student of screenplay writing, I mean. If you want to write a good horror film (especially those with demons in them), try to come up with a scene or a story device that we've never seen before. The danger, though, is that by trying too hard, you might end up making your audience laugh more than anything else.

The rest of the film is just a series of clichs, one after the other. You can also learn from that. Learn what-not-to-do when writing such a film. The spanish maid (or nurse) who knows stuff?  The chilly whispers? The bugs (or moths)as a metaphor for the devil? The possessed girl with long hair and a white gown? That same girl speaking in a scary voice? The white eyes? The exorcism scene where the demon yells? The bones breaking? The distorsioned body? The elders who knows the secret? Don't do those anymore. We've seen them a zillion times.

And those are just your usual ghost-like clichs. What about your basic Hollywood clichs? The dad who promises he will be at his daughter's practice but you know he won't be there? That same dad who will be accused of being a bad dad only for every character to find at the end that he isn't? The mother and the father who are separated but will get back together at the end? I mean, one should come up with a list of what-not-to-do-that's-been-done-before prior to writing any film.

By the way, if the parents are getting back together at the end, does this mean that the possession of their daughter was the... best thing (!) that could have happen to their couple?  Because you also have your illogic story devices that always come along such demonic films. Why would the Spanish maid or nurse, in the beginning, let a little child buy the box? Didn't the attack of the possessed girl on her mother wake the entire house? What did the doctors thought of the MRI of the little possessed girl's body in which we clearly see the demon inside?  How can the family go back to a normal life after all this?

Again, for want of anything better, at least you can use such a film as an academic tool for screenplay writing 101. When writing a film, make a list of everything we've seen a zillion times before and... don't do them again! Oh and don't forget the ""Fright Night"" effect. Crosses only work when you have faith. Now you go on and try to beat that one...",1360713600,4,3086,4.516129032258065

There's the compulsory Internet Research Scene (IRS) to explain everything to the audience. There are rabbis who then fill in the gaps if you missed any part of the exposition.

It's not a complete and total stinker but it sure doesn't miss it by far.

5372093,4,B009XTF8JM,"I think I've seen it all now. Never in a million years did I anticipate it was possible to make a movie about demon possession and have it completely devoid of the utterance of the name of Jesus Christ or the symbolism of the cross. ""The Possession"" has accomplished both these tasks in the space of one film.

To say this Jewish take on ""The Exorcist"" is unique would be both true and false at the same time. It's more of the same in the fact that it tramples the frequently treaded grounds explored by ""The Last Exorcism,"" ""The Devil Inside,"" ""The Rite,"" and countless others over the years. Where it's unique is in the fact that it explores the concept from the viewpoint of the Jewish faith instead of the usual Judeo-Christian one.

In case you're not in the religious know, most Jews don't believe Jesus is the Son of God. Therefore, there's no name of Jesus or sign of the cross they can use to battle demonic forces. Although I don't share their beliefs, it's fascinating to explore the idea of possession and exorcism from a different angle.

Clyde Brenek (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) takes his daughters to an estate sale on their way home one afternoon. The youngest one, Em (Natasha Calis), is captivated by an antique wooden box with bizarre writing on it. Clyde buys it for her and they take it home. Em becomes obsessed with the box, going as far as to sleep with it and take it to school with her.

Clyde and ex-wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) become more and more concerned as Em's behavior becomes unpredictable and violent. Clyde takes the box to be examined and finds out that it is a container for an evil spirit known as a Dibbuk. Once the box is opened, it slowly and completely consumes the human it has bonded with. The two parents must get past their disbelief and find someone within the Jewish religious community who will step out in faith and help them.

Director Ole Bornedal (""Nightwatch"") is no stranger to the art of creating a suspenseful atmosphere in his films. ""The Possession"" also shows that he knows how to take what many would consider tired subject matter and breathe new life into it. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the movie doesn't have any flaws, but for the most part it's genuinely creepy and provides some frightening visuals.

I would recommend ""The Possession"" to those horror fans tired of the same old boring take on territory ""The Exorcist"" explored in 1973. Although my own beliefs are Christian, I found the Jewish take on the concept of possession to be fascinating to examine. There might be many ""dj vu"" moments, but it's light years better than other exorcism movies we've been bombarded with recently. I'm looking at you, ""The Last Exorcism"" and ""The Devil Inside!""",1359590400,,2732,4.622680412371134
5372094,1,B009XTF8JM,"That should be a warning to not buy this movie or even rent it. In fact, don't waste your time even if you can see if for free.

Husband is separated from wife. Husband gets weekend with children where the younger daughter spots a box her daddy buys for her at a yard sale. There is an ominous warning from a bandaged person in the window beyond who watches the purchase. The girl figures a way to open the box, and soon there is a voice that starts talking to the girl, who in turn, starts acting strangely. Daddy doesn't understand and mommy thinks daddy is abusing their little girl. In desperation, daddy takes the box, which incidentally had Hebraic writing carved in it, and takes it to the Hassidim Community in Brooklyn for answers and solutions.

Taking it into a temple, the other religious men in their shtreimel and rekels gasp and step back as if Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who is daddy, has just released the Bubonic Plague. The grand rebbi says he cannot help him. He pronounces it an evil box used to constrain some evil spirit that was evil in humanhood, and it will kill his daughter. But the son waiting outside says it is his obligation as a Jew to help, and the two drive back upstate to get the evil spirit that is taking over daddy's little girl. A Jewish exorcism begins.

With daughter sounding odd, rolling eyeballs, levitating, snd smacking mom and dad around a room in the basement of a hospital where the lights go on and off like some kind of light show at Studio 54, our Hassidic hero in shawl and yalmulka is bowing repeatedly saying some kind of exorcism ritual to take that evil soul out of the man's daughter. Ahhh-beeeee-zoooo, he yells continually.

The Possession might possess you in an evil sort of way. It might make you want to put this director and script writer into a little box--for eternity. If you buy it or watch if after reading this, you can only ask yourself whatever possessed you to do it?

Ths movie is yet another attempt at that.

I do give the makers of this film credit for veering away from the overdone Catholic exorcism and taking it into Judism. Unfortunately, when you fail to come up with original scenes and dialogue, it doesn't matter whether it's a priest or a rabbi, it is the same predictable story we've seen many times before.

Add to this, the most annoying, self absorbed characters anyone could create (seriously, I couldn't even feel sorry for the possessed kid) and then throw in some cheap effects to cover the fact that there is no real action, and you get a pretty dull movie.",1359504000,,817,4.73943661971831

5372100,4,B009XTF8JM,"For those who aren't familiar with the name Sam Raimi my guess is you are aware of the movies he's made. Lately he's been associated with the first Spider-man trilogy starring Tobey McGuire. But long before that Raimi was a director whose first major film of note was THE EVIL DEAD, still one of the scariest movies ever made. That being said I guess it's no wonder that Raimi got into the producing side of the business. The latest film to find him in that seat is THE POSSESSION and it's one of the scariest movies I've seen in some time.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan stars as Clyde, a basketball coach recently divorced from his wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick). The couple has two pre-teen children, Hannah (Madison Davenport) is the older of the two and of course the standard troubled pre-teen. Em (Natasha Calls) is the younger of the pair and still has high hopes of her parents reuniting.  With a new man in her life that's highly unlikely.

On a weekend when Clyde has the girls staying at his place they stop at a yard sale where Em's eye is attracted to what appears to be an antique box with some writings carved into it. Of course she's allowed to buy this and then takes it home. It seems like a puzzle box with no way of being opened, but eventually Em does get it open. And that's when things begin to happen.

Small things at first like a single moth in a room. But that escalates when during the night a bunch of these moths show up in the bathroom while Hannah is there which leads them to Em's room which is filled to the brim with them. A phone call to an exterminator and a trip him ends this visit.

As the story moves forward Em begins to show signs of becoming different. Her parents think it's nothing more than her reaction to their recent split. But there's more to it than that. A fight at school is described as more than a simple altercation with Em showing a substantial violent tendency that has he withdrawing from her friends as well.

Clyde begins to suspect it has something to do with the box and takes it to school with him to have a colleague look it over. The friend reads the inscription which is in Hebrew and says that the box contains a Dibbuk, an evil demon whose spirit is said to be contained therein. Clyde considers this the possible reason for Em's outbursts and throws it away. When Em finds out, she makes it appear he's hit her and runs to rescue the box from where Clyde threw it away. She also causes Clyde to lose any and all custody of the girls.

More strange things occur and Clyde continues to seek a way to save his little girl. With more research he travels to meet with a group of Hassidic Jews and shows them the box. They are the ones who finally give him the information he needs to know about what the box actually is. But will they help him rescue his daughter or is she condemned to whatever evil was contained inside the box?

The film could seemingly boil down to being called a Jewish EXORCIST. But it's not quite the same. How the case is handled is much different. Yes, there are some similarities but on the whole the story is handled at a slower pace with quite a bit less of the gore effects. This story is more a battle of good and evil. It also deals more with the question of how far a parent will go to fight for his or her child and just what they are willing to accept.

There isn't a bad performance in this film. I've become a big fan of Morgan since his days as the father of Sam and Dean Winchester on SUPERNATURAL. His portrayal of Clyde here shows the concern of a real parent for his child and the hopelessness he feels once he discovers what is causing the problem. Sedgwick does a great job as well although her time onscreen seems somewhat limited. What time she does have is well played. Both Davenport and Calls turn in great performances for actors so young. Calls especially stands out as Em, showing the two characters contained in one body convincingly.

It's obvious from the box art for this DVD as well as the commercials that ran when it was in theaters (the ones that showed fingers trying to work their way out of Em's throat when she looked in the mirror) that this is a movie intent on scaring the viewer. I've seen plenty of horror films and this one actually did give me a start now and then. But more than just offering a few jump scares, this movie had you in its grip from start to finish. It didn't feel like it had wasted space or time spans that made you want to reach for the fast forward button. This movie keeps your attention till the end. And if you get scared along the way on this trip, then that's just icing on the cake.",1359417600,,4636,4.300114547537228

5372104,3,B009XTF8JM,"This movie itself doesn't have too much to offer that's new. If you've seen ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemary's Baby,"" you'll probably feel you've seen most of the manifestations in this film before.

Except, instead of the exorcism being performed in the more generally familiar Roman Catholic tradition, here we see the dybuk spirit being driven out by a member of the Hassidic Jewish tradition. The performer cast to play this exorcist's role had actually been a member of the Hassidic community, lending some authenticity and unique interest to the proceedings. For the most part though, the possessing agent is a familiar character, right down to its ravening appetite for raw meat.

However, there are reasons to get this film. There are two commentaries on the disc. The one by director Ole Bornedal is hypnotic and eerie. He doesn't talk a lot about the technical aspects of making the film. No details about ""hand-held"" versus ""steady-cam."" Listening to him is like listening to a captivating storyteller around the campfire. In his softly advancing Scandinavian accent, he paces you through the film. ""And now the quiet, and now the quiet.""

Then there's a narrative from one of the film's associates about how he actually acquired a kind of dybuk (dibbuk) box, and about the frightening trail of circumstances that (coincidentally?) arose from his possession of it. This narrative is also scarier than the movie itself. It comes with warnings similar to the warnings movie producer William Castle used to tantalize his audiences with in his B-movies of the 1950's. When the dybuk box will actually be shown as part of the bonus features, a caution to the audience appears. ""For your own safety, you might want to turn away from the screen."" It's ""Homicidal"" and ""The Tingler"" all over again - not as part of the movie, but in the usually blander commentaries.

On a more realistic plane, the movie has an appealing romantic subplot and stars two handsome people - Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. So there's eye candy for both male and female viewers here. These stars portray a divorced couple drawn back together as they battle to reclaim the soul of their youngest daughter. Will they succeed? Will these beautiful people, who obviously still have so much feeling for each other, be able to sew their family back together?",1359331200,,2337,4.969309462915601

Dad finally comes to the rescue, enlisting the son of a Hassidic Rabbi to exorcise the demon.  At the climax Dad pleads with the demon to leave his daughter and enter him.  Fans of 1973's The Exorcist will recall Father Karras intoning the demon to do the same thing.  That's not the only thing borrowed from The Exorcist, a film superior in every way to The Possession.

I'm a horror movie veteran with a fondness for supernatural stories and this one bored me.  The acting was very good, and the Judaic theme was a nice variation from the overdone Catholic theme, but otherwise not worth the time or money.  I disliked every character, even though they worked so hard to make the viewer sympathize with the family's issues.

In fact, they went for a kind of monster movie ending and left the creepy part behind.  Too bad.

""The Possession""
(Lionsgate, 2013)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Note: spoilers below. Don't freak out.
---------------------------------------------------------------
This demon-possession/exorcism movie follows a conventional -- and pleasantly old-school -- narrative, with the glum young daughter of recently-divorced parents coming into ownership of a creepy wooden box which, when opened, unleashes an evil spirit that warps and ultimately consumes her. The twist, such as it is, is that this spirit isn't your run-of-the-mill Catholic-theology, Satan-affiliated demon, but rather a dybbuk, a demonic damned soul from the Jewish tradition, which pretty much acts the same way as all the other demons in movies such as ""The Exorcist,"" and ""Omen,"" but needs a Jewish cleric to expel it from its host, preferably a Hasidic rabbi with long payot and a preference for dark clothing. The film is anchored by an excellent actor, Jeffrey Dean Morgan (perhaps best known as the dying/ghost boyfriend, Denny Duquette, on TV's Grey's Anatomy) -- as the family dad here, his reactions are realistic and proportional, with Morgan doing his best with the role. Even more noteworthy are the two young actresses who play his daughters, Natasha Calis and Madison Davenport, who both deliver impressive and understated performances: I'd keep an eye on both of these kids to see where their careers go from here.

This is a pretty average demon movie, admirable for its slow pace and conscious throwback to an earlier era of psychological tension and suspense, as opposed to gratuitous gore and voluminous special effects -- this is Amityville/Omen/Shining stuff, not Freddy and his splattercore spawn. There was room for improvement -- for example, the creepy, battered old box could have looked less overtly creepy, since it doesn't make much sense that a ten-year old girly girl would have wanted it in the first place, or that her dad would have bought it for her, no matter how much he was into buying his kids whatever they wanted in order to seem like the best divorced dad ever, but whatever. It's a creepy magic box that seduces its victims, and that's that. The Jewish angle is okay, although clearly there's a Holocaust backstory waiting for a sequel (it's not in this film, but you know it's coming). While the film largely avoids overt stereotypes, the portrayal of its Jewish characters is a little eye-rolly: a secular academic that the dad goes to talks cryptically in a funny cadence, and the somber Hasidic cabal that he's sent to are otherworldly and exotic, though perhaps no more so than the shifty Catholic priests in ""The Da Vinci Code."" Hey, it's just a silly horror movie: the stereotypes could be much worse. Overall, this was a perfectly serviceable, fairly suspenseful film, derivative but with a few new chills and some very strong acting. Worth checking out.

Because one thing I *did* like was that this wasn't the same exorcism movie we've seen remade constantly since the success of the biggie in the seventies. This possession is different. It comes from the canon of a different religion, and it's brought about for different reasons from the ones we're used to seeing. As such, while it didn't entertain me per se, it *did* interest me. In fact, I found myself checking out Wikipedia during the film just to read up on the subject matter. That is way cool! :)

Also, while the film was, as I said, kind of dull, to be fair it's not the actors' fault. The acting is quite competent, particularly the gentleman who played the father. I really liked his character and felt for him.

5372138,2,B009XTF8JM,"Time seems to move at a glacial pace in Hollywood.  Somewhere, it's still shortly after ""The Ring"" was released, where that ""spooky little girl"" thing is still happening.  And somewhere, someone is trying to remind neglectful parents (lest they forget ""The Exorcist"") that their children just might get possessed and turn on them.  Such is the alternate timeline where this film came from.  It's a mind-bogglingly crazy take on the internet-born legend of the Dibbuk Box.  The true story in itself (which they go into scant detail on in the special features) is actually pretty spooky.  This film, however, is a joke.  If you've seen one sweaty little girl writhing and growling in man-voice you've seen them all.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick play the befuddled and neglectful parents who never ONCE earn our sympathies as the girl writhes around, eats raw steak on all-fours in the kitchen late at night, and vomits moths all over her sister.  It's just too much to take and not for a moment is it believable.  It also contains yet another example of the ""Let's sap all the color from every frame since it's horror"" style of film-making, a confounding trend that makes every shot look like it was filmed through a cup of fog.

Skip it.  There is one and ONLY one Exorcism movie worth seeing and that particular lightning in the bottle will never again be recaptured.

For some real scares, check out the REAL story of the Dibbuk Box which I will not link to here.  Google it.",1358812800,,1486,4.709302325581396
5372139,3,B009XTF8JM,I thought this movie was really frightening since it was based on a true story.  Entertaining with a decent storyline.,1358812800,,118,4.9
5372140,4,B009XTF8JM,"This movie was a pleasantly scary surprise.  I was expecting an over-the-top gore fest and violence-filled scream queen type of a flick.  But it turned out to be a well-acted, well-made horror movie.  Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffrey Dean Morgan head the capable cast.  But it's young Natasha Calis that gave the standout performance in the movie.  This is Natasha's movie, and it could very well propel her to stardom.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a collegiate basketball coach, and a recently-divorced father of two young girls.  As the story begins, he is trying to pick up the pieces and start a new life in his new home.  At the same time, he is also facing a career decision when he learns of a possible job opportunity to coach North Carolina.  He is currently sharing custody of the girls with his ex-wife.  One afternoon, while driving through a residential neighborhood, the girls sees a yard sale.  Needing items for his new house, the coach agrees to stop and let the girls pick out items that he might need in his new home.  The younger girl, Emily, sees an unusual wooden box.  They purchase this box, along with dishes and utensils for the house.

Emily becomes increasingly fascinated with the box.  Eventually, she manages to get it open.  From that point on, strange things begin to happen.  Swarms of insects start appearing in her room.  Her behavior starts to change.  Understandably, the adults assumed it was just a minor issue related to their separation.  But the problem continues and Emily's behavior becomes more violent.  The box is a prison for a malicious spirit called a dybbuk.  In jewish mythology, this spirit is evil and likes to possess the body of the living.  By opening the box, Emily has released the dybbuk from its prison.

The story was inspired by the events surrounding a wooden box that was auctioned off on eBay nearly ten years ago.  This box, referred to as the Dybbuk Box, was handed down the family line of a holocaust survivor.  Every one who has owned the box have made claims that strange things began to happen in their lives during their time of ownership.  In any case, several possible explanations have been given for these events.  And should you ever come across a wooden box with the Shema carved into it on eBay, I would suggest that you pass it up.  :)

Anyway, regardless of whether you believe or do not believe that these events were caused by the box, this is still a very good movie.  I highly recommend it.",1358812800,3,2465,4.6496519721577725
5372141,4,B009XTF8JM,Movie was surprisingly really good. I wouldn't expect anything less from Raimi. If you like movies in the horror genre then this movie is for you. Enjoy,1358812800,,152,4.666666666666667
5372142,4,B009XTF8JM,"Inspired by LA Times writer Leslie Gornstein's article ""A Jinx in a Box,"" this horror film from Ghost House Pictures  tells the tale of a broken family that comes under attack from a malevolent supernatural entity of Jewish folklore. Shortly after her parents (Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick) divorce, a young girl purchases an ornate antique box at a yard sale. In the weeks that follow, the young girl forms an intense fixation on the box, her behavior growing increasingly bizarre as she falls into the grip of a diabolical apparition. When the girl's father discovers that the relic is in fact a holding cell for the disconnected soul of a deceased person who has been denied entry into the afterlife and needs a human host to inhabit, he fights to rid her of the evil that threatens to consume her body and soul.

I really enjoyed this movie, it was a lot better than I expected. I thought Jeffrey Dean Morgan did a excellent job and Natasha Calis was wonderful as Em, the daughter who becomes obsessed with the box. It's not your typical ghost story and I think because Sam Raimi was one of the producers, people expected it to be really, really scary and while it was scary, it doesn't have a lot of blood and gore. It reminds me of Drag Me to Hell, which was another Sam Raimi movie that wasn't really bloody or gory but yet it was scary and really good as well. The ending makes me wonder if there will be a part 2.

Give this movie a chance, I think if you watch it with a open mind, you will be pleasantly surprised at how good it really is and it will also make you think twice about buying stuff from a yard sale!",1358726400,2,1633,4.365131578947368

5372148,2,B009XTF8JM,"This is a good RedBox rental. You won't get your $1 rental tipped off.

The review contains spoilers.

The problem I had with the movie is the contrived plot and the massive loop holes. At the beginning of the movie, they show an older woman terrified of the box and is savagely beaten and thrown about the room eventually to crash face first into a coffee table.

Later, the family has a yard sale, and sells her box. Apparently, this is weeks later form the old woman's attack, and nothing else happened to anyone who touched the box?

Later on in the movie, the box is taken from the little girl and locked at school. Her teacher is alone in the room with the box after school. She is attacked and killed. The old lady went through just as savage an attack, but she wasn't killed?

Later, the box is left in a open parking lot for quite a long period of time. At least a good ten hours plus. Right out in the middle of the lot. And no one disturbs it?

The father is trying to destroy the box. He even carries it to the Jewish people to try and help him rid him of the demon/spirit. Not a peep from the demon. The thing in the box does not attack him until towards the end of the movie.  But the thing had beat the old woman to a pulp who approached it with a hammer, and killed the teacher who did nothing towards the box other than keep it in a room. But it won't attack the dad who was the biggest threat of all?

The father only sees the girls on weekends. The girl only acts strange on his weekends? What about the other 5 days of the week? Did the mother just not pay attention?

Fans of this movie will find thin threads to sew the loop holes up. But people with common sense will scoff.",1358640000,,1697,4.102719033232629

This box has a long history and it was passed around through too many different hands. Whether or not the claims are actually true I wanted to see an interpretation of them. Instead I saw another variation of The Exorcist, a Haunting in Connecticut, and the exorcism of Emily Rose.

This unique take on the genre follows a girl who obtains a strange box. Her attachment to the box starts to cause drastic changes to a family that is already experiencing distress from a divorce. What's more is that this one has a Jewish backstory, which is rarely seen in the genre. There were some truly creepy and memorable scenes,  and the cameo by Matisyahu was awesome!

5372157,4,B009XTF8JM,"Among horror fans there are those that seek out films with a supernatural or demonic flare, and this movie fits snugly in that category, while still bringing something new to the table. The true-life events and lore of the ""box"" that this film is based upon are almost as disturbing as the film itself, and I personally think that adds to the potency of the movie experience. Some may say that this film mimics the exorsist too much and uses the ""box"" as a gimmick, but I think it definitely stands on it's own merits.",1358380800,,518,4.463157894736842

5372160,3,B009XTF8JM,"This movie had SO much potential. After Raimis work on Drag Me to Hell I was pumped to see this movie, only to be kind if let down. Its not all Raimis fault. First off he didn't direct this, he only produced it. Secondly there was something  like 14 other producers. So with that in mind you really can't lay to much blame on him. The blame, in my opinion falls on the shoulders of Ole Bornedal, who I personally have never heard of and have never seen or heard of, any of his previous movies.

The movie just seems rather slow. There are a few scares but nothing really new, though the kitchen scene with the mother and the morgue scene were intense. The actress who played the possessed girl did a wonderful job, she can show so much emotion with just her eyes, and I really wish they would of given her more to work with, because she can make herself look so evil, but at the same time you can still tell that there is this innocent young girl trapped in this body, it is really remarkable. I could just imagine what she could have done with a role like the exorcist, and I am not dishing on the exorcist, but I am saying if she would of had a role like that it could of really put her on the map. Unfortunately this movie isn't going to do that for her, but I truly believe she has enormous potential and I look forward to seeing her in the future.

Overall I say if you really have to see this rent it first. If your a person who doesn't watch many horror movies you will probably really enjoy it, but you seasoned horror movie vets, won't find anything new and fresh here.",1358380800,,1578,4.167213114754098

It gives us the usual ingredients:  an angelic looking sweet natured daughter; the estranged parents; a creepy atmosphere and the evil released demonic force.  There are some chilling scenes, especially the moth invasion.  The main drawback is the film's predictability---it's all been done before albeit the Jewish exorcism is a new slant.
Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a solid presence as the devoted father but Kyra Sedgwick isn't given a whole lot to work with as the mother.  Natalie Chalis and Madison Davenport do well as the teen daughters.

Yes, I remember mom being possessed by demons. I warned her about burning those black candles, drinking goat's blood, and opening strange ancient boxes with Hebrew letters.

After the credits, the story then moves on to Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the almost big time basketball coach, his divorced wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick), and two adorable daughters he has for the weekend in his new home on Always Dreary Lane. Em (Natasha Calis) the younger, more adorable, and better actor of his two daughters buys a box at a yard sale and the next thing you know the movie transforms itself into a mediocre Jewish exorcism film.

The highlight for me was the MRI scene. I would like to see Natasha Calis get smacked around er ah star in more horror films. You can keep the rest of that lot. I found myself getting bored during some of the better scenes. At 92 minutes, it seemed like 2 hours. Dialogue lacked decent hooks. Oh wait. That's because this was ""based on a true story.""
