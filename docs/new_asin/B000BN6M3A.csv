8089226,5,B000BN6M3A,This is a good video and is used for our dance classes. It is recommended by our instructors for practice so we are all practicing the same thing.,1525824000,,146,4.25
8089227,1,B000BN6M3A,"I bought this DVD and the Gotta Tango DVD.  So I will use that as my basis for this review.  First of all, this DVD is way over priced. Even it says Beginner/Intermediate and costs almost 40 dollars, it is only one DVD.  If the instructions are good, this could be excused. But the quality of the lessons is disappointing too.  The first lesson in the DVD is the 8 Count Basic. So it goes directly to the steps without the explaining some of the basic concepts that I consider important. For example, it helps to know how to send signals to your partner to `mark' your next move. Some concepts can be considered obvious but they still need to be pointed out. Like as a general rule, you want to have your partner dance around you. I used to send my partner to the side instead of around me when I guide her into the side step (lateral opening). The lessons cover mostly of how to do the steps with practically no tips for making them work better.  The whole thing (I have to admit I watched about 30 minutes of it and could not continue) is very mechanical, including the steps of the teachers.  I am a beginner/intermediate level Tango student and by no mean an expert in this area.  But the way they dance reminds me more of ballroom dancing instead of Argentina Tango even they demonstrate Argentina Tango steps. It does not have the easiness and sensual feel that I want my dance to look like. Maybe someone can comment on it further. The Gotta Tango is a much better DVD (with a book) with half the price.",1237507200,,1510,4.333333333333333

8089229,5,B000BN6M3A,"One should be aware that the Argentine tango has, I think, a large number of possible steps, some of which are simple while others are more complex, which are linked together in ways that are creative, personally appropriate to the music and can be selected accordint to the dancers preference and ability.  This DVD, especially in the beginning has the student learn set, basic steps, that to people who learn the dance from taking classes or in milongas, might be dismissed because the freeness of the style is not emphasized.  Knowing that we have to use what we learn from the Librero's DVD and tweak out details in milongas or from instructors,  my wife and I have found the Librero's DVD to be excellent.  At times it is a little difficult to distinguish right from left legs because of the black color of Mr. Librero's pants, but this is a small issue as you study the moves of the dance; each step is repeated from different directions to help the student understand what the step actually is.  Then the man's steps and the woman's steps are described.  In the last part of each lesson, the Librero's dance to music.  Beyond the fact that the lessons are clear, thoughtfully created and well paced, Blanche and Emilio Librero are really enjoyable to watch.  They are so fluid and graceful.  So buy it, watch it over and over, look for the subtleties - you'll see them - and get out there and dance!",1179964800,11,1406,4.592
