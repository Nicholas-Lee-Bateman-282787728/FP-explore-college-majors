959482,3,6305067317,"This movie, though scandalous in its time, was full of cheezy humor and slapstick.  I purchased this movie for my 78 year old mother who has memories of seeing it on ""the big screen"" with her mother.  All she could remember was the title and grandma, a normally conservative woman, laughed so hard she had tears rolling down her cheeks (and she was the preacher's wife!).  If you have an older family member that might enjoy a trip back in time, I would highly recommend purchasing this movie.",1251504000,,493,4.579545454545454
959483,4,6305067317,"""Up In Mabel's Room"" is based on a stage play of the same name.  Dennis O'Keefe, Marjorie Reynolds & Gail Patrick star in this bit of fluff.  O'Keefe will do anything to keep his ultra-jealous bride from discovering a frilly slip he had given to Mabel on a Mexican Holiday.  Complications ensue as others get wind of ""a"" slip in Mexico and naturally conclude our hero has made a ""false step"". O'Keefe has to keep one step ahead of his wife and two steps ahead of Mabel, who wants to bring everything out into the open before her upcoming 2nd marriage. Character actors Misha Auer, Charlotte Greenwood, Lee Bowman, John Hubbard, Janet Lambert & Binnie Barnes are also in fine form. The reparte' is quick at this winter weekend getaway. Charlotte Greenwood is the long-legged limber blond actress with some visually funny moments, you know she's the actress who can step over a fence without bending a knee.

As to the DVD quality....You will not be disappointed..The picture and sound on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a Gotham or Madacy and 5 being a new release) its a 4. There is good contrast and good definition although not crisp and sharp, but there were no artifacts or blotches.  The sound is good and even with no hissing or un-even-ness. I've watched on two different TV's and 1 computer monitor each with its own leval of clarity.  This has a bonus comedy short ""Edgar Kennedy in Rough On Rent"" this however is a poor print with poor sound. I hope this helps......",1102032000,21,1471,4.553030303030303

959823,5,6305067317,"This was one of the movies I remember from my youth. I could never place where or what it was about except for one scene.
I couldn't even remember the name. The title finally came to me what it was. I had to have it.

Like ""Getting Gertie's Garter"" this is an innocent, funny and harmless movie that anyone can see. Funny situations and crazy dialogue. Dennis O'Keefe was alway a laugh in these types of movies. It was a morale booster during WWII for everybody.",1378166400,,462,4.372093023255814

7882060,5,6305067317,"""Up in Mabel's Room"" is a stagy, zany -- absolutely adorable! -- little romp, set for the most part in a large luxury mansion, featuring a multitude of scatterbrained characters, jealously suspicious of one another, due to a barrage of misinterpreted, circumstantial scenarios.  You'll chortle with delight watching them running helter-skelter in and out of one another's bedrooms, opening doors, closing doors, spying behind doors, climbing in and out of windows, hiding in a box, crawling under a bed (sometimes one at a time...sometimes two at a time...sometimes *three* at a time) -- each one imagining...each one fearing...each one *convinced* that his (or her) beloved partner is involved romantically with one (or more) of the others.

Charlotte Greenwood delivers a memorable performance as the cool-headed matriarch of the house, who bravely ventures outside in the dark and fires a load of buckshot into greedy Boris's (Misha Auer's) tender backside, mistaking him for a vicious burglar, when, in fact, he had just scrambled frantically out of her daughter Mabel's (Gail Patrick's) bedroom window, nearly caught simply looking for the latter's sexy negligee, which Gary Ainsworth (Dennis O'Keefe) had given to Mabel as a gift down in Mexico (and had prominently monogrammed with his *own* initials) -- all this, of course, long before he'd met and married his jealous wife Geraldine (Marjorie Reynolds) -- a monogrammed negligee for which Dennis has promised to pay Boris $500 to retrieve...why? -- well, because Mabel -- absolutely certain her husband Arthur (Lee Bowman) would understand her virtuous motivation (though unaware of the ""scandalous"" negligee) -- was threatening to disclose ALL to jealous Geraldine, so that there would be no hidden secrets that might suddenly pop up and wreck her marriage to Gary.

Oh, and then there's that *other* couple: Alicia Larchmont and Jimmy Larchmont (Binnie Barnes and John Hubbard), friends of Mabel, who initially have virtually nothing to do with virtually anything -- yet who innocently and awkwardly manage to get drawn into the entanglement, simply because Alicia (in cahoots with Mabel) decides it would be in Gary's ""best interests"" to make jealous Geraldine even *more* jealous by feigning to comfort Gary's despair over his untrusting wife with a shrewd, healthy dose of seductive guile -- blithely unaware that her husband Jimmy (emerging suddenly and inauspiciously on the scene), would come upon her in such a ""distasteful,"" ""compromising"" position.

Starting to get the picture?...confused?

You won't be, if you stick it out to the very end -- when everything gets put back together in cheery, apple pie order.",1473292800,,2682,5.33096926713948

7882067,3,6305067317,"1st half was fun, quick-witted, and engaging.  Then, alas, the campy slapstick took over.  Marjorie Reynolds was under-used, though decent--we half expected her to start playing ""White Christmas""!  (See Holiday Inn, a great flick.)

Gail Patrick was superb in this, the calm in the storm, a real presence on the screen.

Check out her bio--she graduated college, became dean of women, and went to law school for a few years before landing an acting gig.  She negotiated a higher salary than was customary for the times, along with a no-cheesecake publicity photos clause according to IMDB.  She ends up leaving acting, becomes executive producer for the Perry Mason TV show for its entire run!  (She was married to the literary agent of Erle Stanley Gardner, the author of the PM books!)

One smart cookie!

(Please forgive any sexism that might lurk in that remark; the etymology of the term suggests faint hints of it, but also gender neutrality in its application.)",1453420800,2,968,4.956521739130435
