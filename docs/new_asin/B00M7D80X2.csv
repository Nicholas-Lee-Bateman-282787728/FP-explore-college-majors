6563226,3,B00M7D80X2,"Let me clear some things up. If there is a killer in a film and Eric Roberts is in it, it is not a mystery who the killer could be. If there is a bad guy and Malcolm McDowell is it.... Type casting has ruined many films. The film opens with Jane Porter (Sarah Butler) practicing kick boxing with her boyfriend (Jayson Blair). He doesn't like her billionaire boss Thaddeus Gault because he is played by McDowell. Jane goes to work and discovers that VP Michael Willbourne jumped off the roof. His office was quickly cleared out and 9 minutes into the film as Gault is making a speech, I had the whole film figured out, and most of you will too.

What can I say. You know that kick boxing thing works it way back into the script and if you read the title and look at the box you know this is about our heroine being cornered in an elevator. Not many characters and the ones they had were not overly entertaining. I personally liked Stig Svendsen 2011 ""Elevator"" more.

Guide: No sex or nudity. No swearing that I recall.  2 1/2 stars",1415404800,7,1031,4.276923076923077

6563228,4,B00M7D80X2,"Professionally, I love the fact that Sarah Butler flip the script in this film. I have seen several of her other movies. I love her performance here she displayed multi-talented skills overall. But for me she seal that deal with the fight scenes, and not to give away too much. Side Bar Review ""Loved that it was a free fall, but sure would have paid more to see it.""",1415059200,2,367,4.333333333333333
6563229,5,B00M7D80X2,"This is a fantastic, edge of your seat, suspense driven thriller! It looks and sounds amazing. Butler is in top form as the protagonist, Malcolm McDowell is a slowly calculating and terrifying presence and DB Sweeney is so menacing in his role (Halloween fans take note: there are several VERY cool nods to Michael Myers in Sweeney's character - can you spot them?) you just wouldn't want to see him ANYWHERE near you! Beautiful to look at, immersive sound and a journey with twists that satisfy! Very entertaining, and that's what we want from movies isn't it?",1414713600,2,561,4.793814432989691
6563230,1,B00M7D80X2,Very predictable movie.  Save your money and wait until it goes prime.  What a waste.,1414454400,,85,4.6
6563231,5,B00M7D80X2,"I have no problem with admitting I was biased towards FREE FALL prior to viewing it.  You see, I am a huge fan of Sarah Butler and her work, therefore I already expected to like the film.  And thankfully, I was not disappointed in the least.  This is a tension-filled thrill-ride that boasts an excellent cast and a suspenseful storyline.  You cant ask for much more out of a movie experience.

I had the pleasure of meeting Sarah Butler a few years ago, when she was promoting I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE.  She (and the rest of the cast) attended the Texas Frightmare Weekend, and I got the opportunity to visit with them one-on-one.  I have to say they were all very classy but down to earth, true professionals in every way.  After watching the film, I became fans of the whole cast; they all did a great job in the film, but Butler shined like a beacon.  As a result, I am an avid fan of her films.

FREE FALL is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production value appears high, and the attention to detail within the film does not go unnoticed.  Little things like the type of computers the executives were using (touchscreens with the latest software) help add to the realism of the high-rise setting.  I also particularly like how the location managers captured the amazing views of the Los Angeles skyline at night.

Needless to say, the acting is top-notch with Butler heading up a great cast.  I am constantly impressed with her acting talents.  She is a beauty that does not have to rely on her looks to land her roles.  But although she steals the spotlight for me, I would be remiss if I did not mention her fellow costars.  Screen legend and icon Malcolm McDowell is always a pleasure to see in a film.  And surprisingly, D.B. Sweeney does a great job as well; I thought he had fallen off the face of the earth after his popularity in the 90s, however I see from his IMDB page that he has been plenty busy.

The storyline of FREE FALL deserves a lot of credit, too.  It is intelligent and intense, with plenty of suspense to keep you riveted to your seat.  And, I can definitely say I have never wanted to see a final showdown as badly as I did in this film.

FREE FALL is a big win for me, and fans of thrillers and suspense will love it.  I highly recommend giving this one a look.  It hits store shelves tomorrow, so make a note.",1414368000,10,2345,4.323394495412844

6563259,5,B00M7D80X2,"Once this movie gets going it doesn't let up.  I've been a huge fan of D.B. Sweeney as a villain since his role on ""Jericho"" and the cold, calm demeanor he brings creates a very believable, and real (read: not hyper dramatized) antagonist.  Sarah Butler is just a joy to watch and her athleticism creates a surprisingly agile adversary.  This cat and mouse flick is worth a watch and won't make you sit through hours and hours of exposition.  It's short, sweet, and delivers a punch.",1420588800,4,483,4.5813953488372094
6563260,1,B00M7D80X2,"My comment to my wife was that I couldn't believe we actually watched the entire movie.  It was horrible.  Poor script, poor story line, poor acting.  I'd rather watch paint dry than to watch this movie ever again.",1420416000,,214,4.578947368421052
6563261,3,B00M7D80X2,This could have been better but it was still mildly entertaining. This is packaged as a female heroine film but it is really more of a female survivor film. The bad points are the mistakes which the heroine makes that put her in her situation and the entire movie was filmed in an office building. You know the classic trusting all the wrong people and failing to protect herself before engaging in a dangerous situation. Now if you can make it past those errors then she starts to use her brains to survive and the film gets to be entertaining. A little bit of action and suspense of seeing if the culprit gets caught and  if she will survive.,1420329600,,644,4.411764705882353

6563269,1,B00M7D80X2,"I was gonna 5-star this turd in a sad & juvenile ploy for attention.  It's cold, I'm old, blah blah, Give it a try, Gramps.  Don't even bother to check who's in it, just be bold, be daring.  This is what old people do for adventure.  It's brand new!  Might be something.  It aint.  Actually, maybe (in a metaphysical sense) only s****y movies can, like, Be, but Be Less Than Nothing.  Like...there's less here than meets the eye.  I could name drop, how certain Hollywood Names doom productions from the get-go.  But that's cruel.  We all need to earn a living.  A gig's a gig.  Maybe, this time, he/she will turn things around, get back the old sparkle.  But, hey:  doom's a bitch.  Anyhoo, the first (& only) 8 minutes I gave this mustard burp sparked some craw stickers,  One lead is portraying a high-line corporate dude, an 8- or 10-figure power player.  But his suit don't fit.  C'mon, man.  Getting a suit to fit well aint no big deal.  You're playing an 8- or 10-figure power player.  The real ones get their suits fitted.  You can, too.  Just (politely) ask the ladies in Costuming.  Women know how a man's suit should fit.  Most men do not.  And...if (in re a second Player in this Less Than Nothing deal) you're portraying a Killer, well, real killers can shoot good.  They don't miss from 10 feet, with a 12 round clip, in a concrete stairwell, chasing a beautiful young woman in heels (no less).  Who's (o yeah) unarmed.  I got more but, with crap like  this, that more would just become less & less & less, like an old man's hopes & dreams when he's old & it's cold & he's working a juvenile ploy.",1415836800,3,1611,4.377551020408164

8670570,4,B00M7D80X2,"The story isn't a new one: executive is killed in apparent suicide, younger associate discovers hidden computer files proving he was onto skullduggery in the company and those responsible  try to prevent her from disclosing it. The story doesn't beat around but gets right into the plot immediately.

Not as bloody or violent a film as I expected. Though the heroine is shown practicing kick-boxing at the beginning, when the moment comes, she isn't a kick-ass action heroine  but a frightened young woman utilizing a skill she's learned and gets knocked around a bit  in the process. She doesn't get herself out of hairsbreadth situations easily and that lends realism to the story.  Robert, the elevator repair main is a bit of a surprise. He looks unassuming but again, when called for, he finds reserves of bravery.  DB Sweeney as the villaln, is cold, ruthless, and seems to enjoy killing too much.

This movie was viewed as a rental and no remuneration was involveld in the writing of this review.",1464998400,,1003,4.864705882352941

8670573,2,B00M7D80X2,"While the synopsis sounds interesting, the execution is poor. The set-up takes way too long, yet strangely, it leaves out some important information. A victim of an untimely death gets the plot moving, but because we are not introduced to this person, it's impossible to care about the mourners. The acting is terrible. Lines are interpreted badly and not timed well. But then, the lines themselves aren't written well, so that doesn't help matters. Malcolm McDowell has always been a fine performer, but he's not featured prominently until the end of the film. If you're curious about the premise, do yourself a favor and skip ahead about 30 minutes to when the main character becomes trapped in the elevator. You won't miss out on anything, I promise you.",1447372800,,757,4.921875
